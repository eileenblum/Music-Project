Warrior Monks! Whitehawk! Warrior Monks!

The warrior monks are on their way
No absolution, they're gonna make you pay

Cos you've been bad and you'd better beware
If you're living sin, you'd better say your prayers

They'll take your teeth out
with a crucifix

Remove your balls and fill your sack with bricks

So stop your talking
and finish your beer
There's no escaping,
they're already here!

The Warrior Monks
of Whitehawk
Permitted to kill,
but not allowed to talk
A vow of silence
and killing for the Lord
All naughty boys and girls die by the sword

The executors
of Cardinal Sin
Drink their Bucky
and then begin

Free from the cloisters
ordained to kill
The removal of limbs
is their holy skill

Rome has decreed
you will be slain
For mead and wenches
are on your brain

There's no way out,
you will succumb
To red hot pokers
up the bum

"Brethren - we are gathered here today to take our holy vows of violence. To venture beyond the borders of darkest Whitehawk, and to prosletyse the unwashed masses of Brighthelmstone &amp; Hova. For they live by the ways of the Devil and his minions, and must be purged of this ungodly heresy, if needs be by tortuous death." 

"To war! God wills it!"

They return to the abbey
with their severed heads
Say their prayers,
climb into bed

They dream of when
they'll again be free
To preach the word of god
on a killing spree
