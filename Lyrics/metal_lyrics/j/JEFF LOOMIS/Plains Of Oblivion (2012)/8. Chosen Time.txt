Her vision only told her
She'd have to hold on tight
Let the reigns in her hands show her
Where she'd have to ride

Waiting for her chosen time
To steal the heart of her knight

She's a thief in the moonlight
She only rides the night
can't you feel her gaining?
She's riding close behind

Like a Desperado in modern times
She'll steal your heart and she'll ease your mind

She knew when she grew older
Someday she'd take that ride
Her soul could learn to fly one day
Once she found her knight

Waiting for her chosen time
To steal the heart of her knight

She's a thief in the moonlight
She only rides the night
can't you feel her gaining?
She's riding close behind

Like a Desperado in modern times
She'll steal your heart and she'll ease your mind

In the moonlight
They will ride...side by side
They'll ride...side by side
They'll ride...in the moonlight

Like a Desperado in modern times
She'll steal your heart
The perfect crime
She knew one day she would ride
Will she meet her knight tonight?
