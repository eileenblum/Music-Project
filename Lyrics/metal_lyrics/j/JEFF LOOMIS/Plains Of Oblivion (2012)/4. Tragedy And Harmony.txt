I feel the struggle inside
The battle for my mind
Is happening tonight
Which personality is driving me?
Straight to insanity...
The suspense is killing me

Which mask will I wear tonight
One that's full of darkness
Or one of blinding light

As I feel my pulse rise
Waiting for my plight
Which mask will I wear tonight?
I'm not responsible you see
For whichever one for me...abandons you

I'm not the one who gets to decide
Who's going to have the time of my life?
I'm stuck inside of my own pantomime
Who'll live out my fantasy?
The supsense is thrilling me

Which mask will I wear tonight
One that's full of darkness
Or one of blinding light

As I feel my pulse rise
Waiting for my plight
Which mask will I wear tonight?
I'm not responsible you see
For whichever one for me...abandons you
