Raging
Foaming
This sea of disillusion
Throws its blinded anger
back at the shore
Where longing eyes
Desperately seek the dawn
Yet, all is black
Nothing can defeat
This moonless night
The depths are calling
Like siren's song
A soothing whisper
The time has come
Feel the cold
Of this embrace
A leap of faith
A fall from grace
From empty lives
That feel like dying
This sinking feels
Like birds of prey in flight
And what just felt
Like ultimate defeat
Now appear like broken chains
Surrender to the night
