I caught a glimpse of you
out of the corner of my eye.
What I saw left me in awe.
(Now I see)
I saw your face and all your power.
All your glory.
You give me the power to blow this world away.

Oh my God I trust in You.
I see your strength and I feel your power.
I know you're always there for me.
You alone are the one I seek.
Oh my God!

Fill me with your power and might.
(This I pray)
I take refuge in you.
I seek you everyday
save me deliver me
from all my enemies.

Oh my God I trust in You.
I see your strength and I feel your power.
I know you're always there for me.
You alone are the one I seek
Oh my God!

I call your name:
Oh! My! God!
