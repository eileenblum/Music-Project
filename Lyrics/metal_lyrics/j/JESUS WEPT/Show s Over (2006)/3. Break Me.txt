Take You for granted everyday.
Try to remember what You say.
How soon I forget when I don't have the time.
When will I ever get out of this bind?

I'm gonna take it all from this pain.
I'm gonna break out of this misery.
Headstrong I've got to do this myself.
I won't depend on anyone else.

When I forget You please forgive me.
I'm not as strong as I want to be
it seems I only think of You when I'm down.
Bring on calamity so You'll be around.

I'm gonna take it all from this pain.
I'm gonna break out of this misery.
Headstrong I've got to do this myself.
I won't depend on anyone else.

I know that I've tried and I know that I've failed
You everyday.
I look to you for light to guide my way.

I'm gonna take it all from this pain.
I'm gonna break out of this misery.
Headstrong I've got to do this myself.
I won't depend on anyone else.
