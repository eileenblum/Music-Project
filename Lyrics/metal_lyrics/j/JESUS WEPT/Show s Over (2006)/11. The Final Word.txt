I've seen a lot.
I've seen pain
I've seen suffering.
I've felt fates cruel hand squeeze the life from me.
I'll never be the same
since You called my name.
I'll never be the same
since You called my name.

All my life.
You felt my pain.
All my life.
You've seen my shame.
All my life
You felt my pain,
All my life
you seen my shame.

All my life
You felt my pain,
Youâve seen my shame.
I'll never be the same
since You called my name.

In the end...
love will have the final word.
In the end...
love will have the final word.
Final Word!

I'll never, never, never.
I'll never be the same
since you called my name.
I'll never be the same
since you called my name.

All my life.
You felt my pain.
All my life.
You've seen my shame.
All my life.
You felt my pain.
All my life.
You've seen my shame.

In the end...
love will have the final word.
In the end...
love will have the final word.
Final Word!
