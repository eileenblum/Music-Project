Well I'm standing on my last leg.
Dejected world heed what I say.
Caught up in lies and material gain.
In given time the pleasure turns to pain.

Won't crawl on all fours for you.
I admit I've made some mistakes.
Won't believe your truth is lie.
Determination: a creed to live by.
Against the grain I try.
Again I believe the lies.
I won't cave to condescending ways.
The sands of time is more than I can take.

The war
I wage
within
myself. I must find a way.
To take
control.
Vow to never fall again.

But I'm holding, holding on to pain.
Although I know it's all mundane.
The creeper I must sow,
protecting.

Won't crawl on all fours for you.
I admit I've made some mistakes.
Won't believe your truth is lie.
Determination: a creed to live by.
Against the grain I try.
Again I believe the lies.
I won't cave to condescending ways.
The sands of time is more than I can take.

But I'm holding, holding on to pain.
Although I know it's all mundane.
The creeper I must sow,
protecting.

The war
I wage
within
myself. I must find a way.
To take
control.
Vow to never fall again.

Against the grain! [x4]
Forever against the grain
