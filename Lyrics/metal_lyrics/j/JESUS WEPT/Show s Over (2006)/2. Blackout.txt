Blackout the light
from my eyes. I try.
Unholy of holy lies.
Now I know.
Led myself to this place of
"what seems right to me"
but in the end is death.

I didn't know
I didnât know
the way.
I should have seen
I should have seen
your face.
I didn't know
I didnât know
the way.
Now I know

If I could see then I would be
alright now.
If I could breathe then I would be
alright now.

Blackout the light.
This false destiny dies
here and now.
Climb out of this misconception.
That spiritual annihilation.

I didn't know
I didnât know
the way.
I should have seen
I should have seen
your face.
I didn't know
I didnât know
the way.
Now I know

If I could see then I would be
alright now.
If I could breathe then I would be
alright now. [x5]
