You call yourself civilized.
You call yourself a martyr to the living.
Protection!
Infection!
Rejection!
Mankind skumbag we rot to the core.

Human wasteland!
Human wasteland!

Human growth (yeah right)
we are the human disaster.

Stuck in this sick city
with nothing but cold weather to keep you warm.
Thank God there's more to life than this.
One hand in either heaven or hell.

Human wasteland!
Human wasteland!

Take a look back
to see how fall we've fallen.
And I know we're all to blame
and we fall so far.
Father save us from the flame.

Is there any hope left
for this human wasteland?
Is there any hope left
for this human wasteland?
That's my hope.
