I've lived through persecution.
I've fought through pain and anger.
I've seen the execution.
I've heard my brothers scream.
Life is now!

We've lived through persecution.
We've fought through pain and anger.
We've seen the execution.
We've heard our brothers scream.
Life is now!

Dear brothers we fight so hard.
We need to stand our ground.
Stand up tall.

This is our life.
It's our fight.

This is our life.
It's our fight.

We will not die tonight.
Where blood falls down in silence.
Why is the air so cold?
We are surrounded with violence.
These are the end times
Foretold!

We've lived through persecution.
We've fought through pain and anger.
We've seen the execution.
We've heard our brothers scream.
Life is now!

Dear brothers we fight so hard.
We need to stand our ground.
Stand up tall.

This is our life.
It's our fight.

This is our life.
It's our fight.
