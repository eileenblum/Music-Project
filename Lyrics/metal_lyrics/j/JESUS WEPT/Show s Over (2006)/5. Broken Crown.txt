I never said that I could save you
from this living hell.
This place we all agreed we'd leave
and change the world.
This hell we know so well.

Together we walk.
Together we stand.
The strength is in the struggle.
Together we fight.
Together we see.
But separate we fall.
You wanted to be King.
You wanted it all.
You're willing to break me down.
You stand I fall.

I am no substitute for
seeking the truth for yourself.
Straight to the heart you go in fear
and tear down who I am.
Now who are you?
Together we walk.

Together we stand.
The strength is in the struggle.
Together we fight.
Together we see.
But separate we fall.
You wanted to be King.
You wanted it all.
You're willing to break me down.
You stand I fall.

You never admit when you're not right.
Keep pushing me away.
Your eyes so blind can't see your wasting away.

You wanted to be King.
You wanted it all.
You're willing to break me down.
You stand I fall.

You wanted to be King.
You wanted it all.
You're willing to break me down.
You stand I fall.
