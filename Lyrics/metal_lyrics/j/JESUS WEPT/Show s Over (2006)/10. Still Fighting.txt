My life is a constant struggle.
My life forever...forever a war.
I have to stay focused.
Look to your for strength because alone I fail.

This is the last time I fail...
I said that last time.
I will fight to the death no matter
no matter what the cost.

Still fighting
after all these years.
Sill fighting
Despite all my tears
Still fighting
after all these years.
Still fighting
it's my fear that breaks me down.

Kicked in the teeth again.
Black and blue from my point of view.
But I am forced to smile
to heal, conceal.
I'm always on the run.

This is the last time I fail...
I said that last time.
I will fight to the death no matter
no matter what the cost.

Still fighting
after all these years.
Sill fighting
Despite all my tears
Still fighting
after all these years.
Still fighting
it's my fear that breaks me down.

I'll leave my fear behind me.
This is the life we choose [x4]
To live!
