My city, Your city
Our sick are kissing the sick
Open your eyes, Open your mouth
And strip away the sun to see the bones
The darkness takes the worst of ourselves to give
It hurts when all is gone
It's just so hard to live

Our blood, Our veins
Our sin, Our pain [2x]

This night is ours to own
Open your eyes, Open your mouth
And get things right in this place
So wrong
This city, Sick city
What dead will bury the dead
So now lets pray away
Our sin, Our shame

Redemption can't be found
Within yourself or those around

My city, Your city
Our sick are kissing the sick
Open your eyes, Open your mouth
And strip away the sun to see the bones
The darkness takes the worst of ourselves to give
It hurts when all is gone
It's just so hard to live

Our blood, Our veins
Our sin, Our pain [2x]

My city, Your city
This is a sick city [2x]

Sick City [3x]
