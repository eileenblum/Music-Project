One hand in hell
One eye in the fire
Heal me for I have sinned
And I get what I deserve

Sick of hearing my cries
Same thing over and over
Making promises that I break
At the first sign of things going my way

How quickly I forget (I forget)
My moments of despair

One hand in hell
One eye in the fire
Heal me for I have sinned
And I get what I deserve

I am the fool
That ruins what we've got
I am the backbone
Of modern thought

One hand in hell
One eye in the fire
Heal me for I have sinned
And I get what I deserve

Let that hand burn

I get what I deserve
Let that hand burn [4x]
