This is where I'm from

Locked in a box
My patience is frozen
Bring back the feeling
My heart ice cold
I'm so numb to the pain (the pain)
These darkers days
They last forever

This is where I'm from
I cant let myself become to cold
This is where I'm from
I cant let my environment change me

The weight of the world
In these long months
Seems like it will never end
The sickness is spreading
I need to get away
You're always waiting for me to fall

This is where I'm from
I cant let myself become to cold
This is where I'm from
I cant let my environment change me

Thought you knew better
You thought you'd see us fall but now never
We're stronger than ever
We're gonna push right through this cold weather

You thought you knew us better
You thought you'd see us fall
We're stronger
We're gonna push right through this cold weather
