Can I take you back to see my old days?
When I walked alone, With my flesh and bone
Can I take you back to see my old ways?
Life so cruel, I played the fool

Father forgive me [2x]

I've lost my way
I've been lead astray
I've walked this path so many times [2x]

Can I take you back to see my old face?
Beaten and bruised, Used and abused
Can I take you back to see my old heart?
So full of hate, blood contaminate

Father forgive me [2x]

I've lost my way
I've been lead astray
I've walked this path so many times [2x]

I'm never alone
I'm coming back (I'm coming back)
I'm never alone [4x]

(in full effect)
