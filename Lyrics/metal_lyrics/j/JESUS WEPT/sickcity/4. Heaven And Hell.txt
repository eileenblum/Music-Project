Public enemy number one
Locked in chains considered insane
Judge wisely Suprisingly
They cried out for His bood

Crucify. Change of direction
Set up the Resurrection
But first the Crucifixion
Mass murderers We're to blame

It's life or death. Heaven and hell
Don't cry for me. Cry for yourself [2x]

Chosen by the world at large
Feared by the masses (a hero to some)
Guilty of the very crime
The innocent accused

Crucify. Change of direction
Set up the Resurrection
But first the Crucifixion
Mass murderers We're to blame

It's life or death. Heaven and hell
Don't cry for me. Cry for yourself [2x]
And for no one else

More than a thief
More than a blasphemous
More than a cheat
Mass murderers we all are
