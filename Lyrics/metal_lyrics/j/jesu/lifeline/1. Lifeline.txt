I don't want to question
Anything
I don't feel that it needs
Attention
Let's fear fear [3x]
Let's bring it near

I can see through your eyes
They're so clear
Through your eyes I feel it
Your naked fear
Let's fear fear [3x]
Let's bring it near

[Chorus:]
Let it go
Then you won't follow them at all anymore
What you need is not what you are
So let it go and follow yourself

I don't want to question
Anything
I don't feel that it needs
Attention
Let's fear fear [3x]
Let's bring it near

[Chorus]
