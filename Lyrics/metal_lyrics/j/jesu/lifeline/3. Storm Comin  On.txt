People yell things out in the street, listen to this
Men in their dark cars are whispering, try to entice me and such they would kill me

And don't, don't you know
What would you feel
All above you
The sky go black
The sky will break
(it's on) you gotta run now, you gotta go fast
(comin' on) storm comin' on now, you gotta past
(it's on) you gotta run now, you gotta go fast
(comin' on) storm comin' on now, you gotta go back

And don't, and don't you know
What would you feel
All above you
The sky go black
The sky will break

[x2]
You gotta run now, you gotta go fast
Storm comin' on now, you gotta get past
You gotta run now, you gotta go fast
Storm comin' on now, you gotta go back

Madness was here
Stabbing needles out this
My spine aches
And I spill myself out
How did I get to this?

[2x]
You gotta run now, you gotta go fast
Storm comin' on now, you gotta get past
You gotta run now, you gotta go fast
Storm comin' on now, you gotta go back

Go back... [12x]
