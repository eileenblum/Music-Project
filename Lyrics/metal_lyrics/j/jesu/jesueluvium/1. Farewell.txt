I just can't be it
leave me behind
I don't want to go with you
unless they go
but they won't
they're far too inwards to understand
situations out of hand
but they know
there's no answer
I can't do what they all
want you to do

so now
we'll lose
everything we start to keep
for our lives
their hands
I don't see that
they will change for you
and your good will
they take what they can
for themselves own ends
believe
a victim
a last farewell and we shall run

and we shall run
and we shall run
and we shall run
and we shall run
and we shall run
