These nights, canyon runs and weekend rides
Those nights warm with us, I feel close to take
You feel that you see the only lights
You feel that your lows are the only life
Choices left are choices that you made yourself
Plans you made, are plans that fade time after time
You feel that you've seen the only lights
You feel that your lows are the only life

You feel that you've seen the only light
You feel that your lows are the only life
You feel that you see the only light
You feel that your lows are the only life

A compilation of unreleased Jesu songs, some dating back from 2000.
