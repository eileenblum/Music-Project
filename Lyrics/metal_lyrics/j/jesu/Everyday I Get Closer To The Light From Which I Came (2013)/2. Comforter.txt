Did you wish they'd disappear
And just go to Hell
Never to return?

Did you wish the sky would open
and endless rain would come,
Wash them all away?

It's just like I do.
It's just like I feel.
It's just like I hoped.
It's just like I wished.

It's just like I do.
It's just like I feel.
It's just like I hoped.
It's just like I wished.
