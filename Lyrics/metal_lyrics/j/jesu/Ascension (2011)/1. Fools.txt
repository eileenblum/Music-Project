See these fools, that surround us
Make their rules, that define us
Seeing reds, that confound us,
Make your rules

The gates we see, are never open
For you and I, they create purpose
A sense of worth, but lost in heaven
Our only hope

They're the architects of sight
Building walls to block our light
Only in dreams we'll make it right
Only in dreams will we take flight

You'll be there at my end
Like my only friend
You know that it's true
It will only be you

You'll be there at my end
Like my only friend
You know that it's true
It can only be you
