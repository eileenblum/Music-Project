All the favours
The favours that you pull
Will be repaid
Repaid in more than full
Just close your mind
Because nothing's really worth it
Just close your mind
Does that not feel so good?

So we litter the land
What we don't need we want
You give life and then don't feed it
It's all smothered beauty
