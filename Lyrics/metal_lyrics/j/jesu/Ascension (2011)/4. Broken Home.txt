I tried to save you
I used water to keep yo alive
And cotton wool to keep your warm
And tears to feed you inside

So spread the word
All feeling is empty
So just follow the heard
In dreams are all we'll be
So spread the word

Helpless I watched you cry
Its hopeless you won't survive
It's those scars that i will never hide
And little tears and more besides
