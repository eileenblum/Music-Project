[2:22]
And all the stones I've thrown
they come back twice as strong.
And all the stones i've thrown, tell me that nothing lasts

And all stones you've thrown,
come from your highest throne.
Pass them on to me below,
they remind me nothing lasts

[4:07]
And all the stones I've thrown,
they come back twice as strong.
And all the stones I've thrown,
they tell me nothing lasts.

[4:48]
And all stones you've thrown, they come from your highest throne.
Pass them on to me below,
they remind me nothing lasts

Nothing
