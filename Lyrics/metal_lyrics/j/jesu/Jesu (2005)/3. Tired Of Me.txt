[1:15]
And I'm,
so tired of me,
withered and unclean.
I'm too blind to see,
shit that is me

[2:32]
And you're
so tired of me.
I'm too blind to see.
You don't need me.
My idle absentee

And I'm so tired of me,
withered and unclean.
I'm too blind to see,
this shit that is me.

[5:07]
And I'm so tired of me,
withered and unclean.
And I'm too blind to see,
shit that is me
