[0:23]
There's only light here
You give me reason
You destroyed my fear
I must stop breathing

[Chorus:]
The paths that we won't follow,
Give us hope
The pills that we won't swallow

[1:10]
Moods change with seasons
Colors reflect our thoughts
Others share the same shell
Lost without your answers
Hills to get lost in
Words give us reason
I still won't follow
The past gives us our hope

[Chorus]

[2:18]
There's only light here
You give me reason
[repeat]
