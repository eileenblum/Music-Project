Do you expect something from me
That closes doors
To ships that sail but don't return
To your summer shores
Father does it seem that right
When you walk away
And do you still hold your head high
Day by day
I can only disappoint you
This I know
This we know

Reissue of the Heart Ache EP and features an unreleased EP from 2003.
