You can be told it's nothing special
not quite the same now for us
Is every day so much trouble
Is there a way out so hard to reach
Water so deep it's hard to fathom
and cast the torments out of reach
for stormy skies that now surround us
what built our need for you and me.

You can be told it's nothing special [x4]
