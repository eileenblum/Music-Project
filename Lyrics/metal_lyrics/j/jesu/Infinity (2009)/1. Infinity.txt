[3:15]
All the wrongs are never right.
It's all just instinct without foresight.

[5:22]
Drown in judgements, kill the nights.
Trust within your souls, burn so bright.

[8:35]
Burn so bright. [x4]

[16:20]
How often you told me
my main trouble was years
wrapped tightly above a bottomless pit.
Centered around your weakness
your nightmares became mine.
Running with sheppards, always the fool.
Wrapped around my weakness.

[27:13]
I cried when you cried.
I'll die when you die.
You don't deserve it.
You won't deny it.

[33:35]
I cried when you cried.
I'll die when you die.
and you don't deserve it
But you won't deny it.
So I cried when you cried.
I'll die when you die.
