We burn this town while your feet trapse through the landfills, eyes blind, eyes blind.
As fallacy rules...

From caskets to cavalcades with rain-making blankets.
Trapping nerves of common coins as cars make melodies.
We bury this spear together in the sides of idles without consent following,
Stalking chalk-white outlines in the floor with your nails broken.
These streets shall forget us while they trapse through the landfills.
Eyes blind, eyes blind.

Trapping nerves of common coins, we bury this spear into the idles side.
