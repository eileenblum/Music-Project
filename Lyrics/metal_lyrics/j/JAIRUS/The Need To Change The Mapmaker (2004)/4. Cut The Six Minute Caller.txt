If I could steal you're waking, then I would hang you on the strings
You'd stay cutting all the words, making circles with your feet
Poison on top of fracture lines, passive where no one interrupts

Today we breathed in this towns air
And conjured illness to escape beaten walls

And how long will you stand aside perfecting this abandonment?
Today we breathed this towns air
And conjured illness to escape
Beaten walls and last chances
Where inide you're armoure flatlined.
