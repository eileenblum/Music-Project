[Dracula:]
Afterlife I provide, mortal soul is denied.
You can run or disguise, pathetic man I despise.

There's no pain, there are no tears when my darkness appears.
There's no heart, there's no soul, most of all there's no love.
It's a golden age so filled with rage, released and disengaged.

Walking on water, in the kingdom of the dark.
Walking on water, I wear the devils mark.

I cover unholy ground and I claim your holy ground.
Damnation for all, come hell or high water.
As the legend speaks "it's true".
I can walk on water.

I will do, do as I please, religious faith I will squeeze.
You'll go down on your knees, as I spread my decease.
It's a golden age, as I turn the page.
I fill you with my rage.

Walking on water, in the kingdom of the dark.
Walking on water, I wear the devils mark.

I cover unholy ground and I claim your holy ground.
Damnation for all, come hell or high water.
As the legend speaks "it's true".
I can walk on water.

It's a golden age, as I turn the page.
I fill you with my rage.

Walking on water, in the kingdom of the dark.
Walking on water, I bare the devils mark.

I cover unholy ground and I take your holy ground.
One nation for all, come hell or high water.
As the legend speaks "it's true".
I can walk on water.
