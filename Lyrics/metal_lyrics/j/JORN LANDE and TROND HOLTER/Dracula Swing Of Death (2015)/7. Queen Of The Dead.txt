[Dracula:]
Blue eyed dream, innocent smile.
She was a good girl just for a while.
She would never let anyone inside.
But I killed the light in her eyes.

Queen of the dead.
There is no salvation ahead.
On a one way ride straight to hell.
There's no way to erase or rewind it.
I can't let her go.
It's all in the dawn for the dead.

Look at you now, Dracula's queen.
The most beautiful dark I have ever seen.
Oh, you belong in my shadowland.
In the twilight zone waits your man.

Queen of the dead.
There is no salvation ahead.
On a one way ride straight to hell.
There's no way to erase or rewind it.
I can't let her go.
It's all in the dawn for the dead.

There's no way to erase or rewind it.
I won't let her go.
It's all in the dawn of the dead.

From the pain of the sun, to the darkness we run.
I give you oceans of time, every curse of my crime.
Let this unstoppable sin make you stronger within.
In the black night I seal your future.

Queen of the dead.
There is no salvation ahead.
On a one way ride straight to hell.
There's no way to erase or rewind it.
I can't let her go.
It's all in the dawn for the dead.

There's no way to erase or rewind it.
I won't let her go.
It's all in the dawn for the dead.
