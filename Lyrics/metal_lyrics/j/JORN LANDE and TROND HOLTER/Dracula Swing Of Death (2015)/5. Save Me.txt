[Dracula:]
I am your darkest nightmare, out from the gates of hell.
I'll be your demon lover, you my bride under my spell.
You know my darkest secrets, the taste so bitter sweet.
My love surrender to me, come my darling feed my greed.

[Mina:]
You are an ugly monster, oh god what have I done.
Lay down to rest, don't bother, on my way soon I'll be gone.
Give me some guns to carry, something to give him hell.
To learn there ain't no fairytale that he will live to tell.

Save me from this love, faith will save my soul.
To live a life in misery, a living dark eternity.

Save me from this love.

[Dracula:]
Why can't you see my bride, that we belong together.
Just die a little bit before you live forever.

[Mina:]
Don't want your kiss of death.
I think I'll tell my father.
Please take your big, bad breath and disappear forever.
Forever, forever.

I can take it, I will make it.
I will take this love and break it.

[Dracula:]
I will never let you go.

[Dracula &amp; Mina:]
Save me from this love, faith can never save your soul.
Faith will save my soul, now I'm waiting in the cold.
To live a life in misery, a living dark eternity.

Save me from this love.

Save me from this love and the wolves will follow your command.
Faith will save my soul, you'll be stronger than the life you had.
To live a life in misery, a living dark eternity.

Save me from this love.

Save me from this love, faith will save my soul.
To live a life in misery, a living dark eternity.

A living dark eternity.

Save me from...
Save me from this love.

Faith won't save your soul.

Save me from this love.
