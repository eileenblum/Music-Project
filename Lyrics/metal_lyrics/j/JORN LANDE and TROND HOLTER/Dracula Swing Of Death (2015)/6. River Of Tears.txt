[Dracula:]
Never believe in the gods above, deep in the shadow waits your love.
Oh feel the pain of a haunted man, I will make you understand.
Under the moon in the pale, dim light, I'll make you queen of the misty night.
Oh, I am the ghost inside your brain, bringer of the crying rain.

[Mina:]
Lost in a river of tears.
Lost in my fear for the state that I'm in.
Alone as the darkness appears.
I surrender to you, I surrender to your embrace.

[Dracula:]
I am the rust in your tortured mind.
My obsession I can't unwind, oh no.
I will take your heart and soul.
Soon I'm gonna drink you cold.

[Mina:]
Lost in a river of tears.
Lost in my fear for the state that I'm in.
Alone as the darkness appears.
I surrender to you, I surrender to your embrace.

[Dracula:]
Let me tell you darling, I'm a pretty, handsome Man.
Willingly you come to me, according to my plan.
Now let's get down and dirty, come and lay down on my bed.
Tomorrow when you wake up, you'll be dead.

Oh yeah, it's too late to cry... die!

[Mina:]
I surrender to you, I surrender to your embrace.

Lost in a river of tears.
Lost in my fear for the state that I'm in.
Alone as the darkness appears.
I surrender to you, I surrender to your embrace.
