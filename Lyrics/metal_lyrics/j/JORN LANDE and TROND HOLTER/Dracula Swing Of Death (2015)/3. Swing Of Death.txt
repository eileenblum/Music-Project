[Dracula:]
Please step inside this crib of mine.
We'll have a ballroom dance tonight.
An invitation that you can't deny.
No ticket sale for the ride.
I got to taste what you can give.
You're such an easy catch and so naÃ¯ve.
Like stealing candy from a kid.
The next card's out of my sleeve.

Now everybody welcome to the...

...Dance of fools.
The swing of death, devils tools.
Until your last breath you know I'm in control.
Don't care at all, ain't got no soul.

No, no I ain't got no soul.

You can't run, no you can't hide.
The doors are all closed, now you won't survive.
But on the other hand you get to join your man, infections guaranteed.
Well I brought you here from the streets of mud.
I don't need much honey, just a drop of blood.
Release your life from misery, I bring you death and insanity.

Now everybody welcome to the...

...Dance of fools.
The swing of death, devils tools.
Until your last breath you know I'm in control.
Don't care at all, ain't got no soul.

Dance of fools.
You're in my dept.
Devils tools.
Step into the grove, into the swing of death.

Dance of fools, devils tools.

I bid you welcome to the ball of the undead.
Tonight we feast, come and join this dance of death.

Dance of fools.
The swing of death, devils tools.
Until your last breath you know I'm in control.
I Don't care at all, ain't got no soul.

Dance of fools.
The swing of death, devils tools.
Until your last breath you know I'm in control.
I Don't care at all.

I'm gonna, I'm gonna be the one to kill your living spark.
I'll be the one to lead and dance you through the dark.
Ain't gonna give you up or wait another day.
Together, you and me will fly and hunt for prey.

Dance of fools, devils tools.

A swing of death.

Dance of fools, devils tools.

Swing it, baby.
