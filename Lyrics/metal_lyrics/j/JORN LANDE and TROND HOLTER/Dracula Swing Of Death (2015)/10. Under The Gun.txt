[Mina:]
You say you'll never make it, there's nowhere left to hide.
You just can't face the demons you carry deep inside.

[Dracula:]
I'm moving with my darkness, I keep away from light.
I'm doomed by my temptation, the hungry prince of night.

[Mina:]
Someday when the tides are turning, there'll still be a light that's burning.

[Dracula &amp; Mina:]
Hold on, don't let go.
This ride is an endless highway.
Don't go, turn to stone.
You'll get around it someday.
Hiding from the sun.
We are under the gun.

[Dracula:]
Sometimes it's getting heavy, so hard to play this game.
I need to feed on something, something to ease my pain.
But when the night is over, we must escape the sun.
Their holy cross and water are forcing us to run.
The future of times is turning, there'll still be the light and it's burning.

[Dracula &amp; Mina:]
Hold on, don't let go.
This ride is an endless highway.
Don't go, turn to stone.
You'll get around it someday.
Running from the sun.
Hold on, don't let go.
Oh I'm under the gun.

Under the gun.
Under the gun.
Under the gun.

[Dracula:]
We are the dead and hollow, heartless we roam the night.
Our lust for blood we follow, we steal you from the light.
This is the darkest romance, eternal is our song to the shadows we belong.

[Dracula &amp; Mina:]
Hold on, don't let go.
This ride is an endless highway.
Don't go, turn to stone.
I'm running from the sun.
Hold on, don't let go.
'Cause we are under the gun.
I'm under the gun.
'Cause now you're under the gun.

Under the gun.
Under the gun.
Under the gun.
