[Mina:]
I'm so afraid of dying, but there's no use in crying.
I got to sacrifice myself to get it done.


[Dracula:]
No drugs will cover for you.
The pain just overflows you.
No need to pray, within the hour you'll be gone.
Trails of blood trickling down your neck.

[Mina:]
Infected I'm now, just a human wreck.

Into the dark I'm calling out your name.
'Cause we will never part, forever in your pain.

[Dracula:]
Oh, you soul is what I'm taking and now your life is fading, you are on the way.

[Mina:]
Don't know to love or hate you.
Don't know what to hold on to, when you're coming and address me as your bride.

Into the dark I'm calling out your name.
'Cause we will never part, forever in your pain.
Into the dark, this world won't be the same.
'Cause we will never part, forever in my pain.

[Dracula &amp; Mina:]
Into the dark I'm calling out your name.
Calling out my name.
'cause we will never part, forever in your pain.
Forever in my pain.

Into the dark.
Into my darkness.
This world won't be the same.
You'll never be the same.
'Cause we will never part, forever in your pain.
Forever in my pain

Forever in the darkness.
