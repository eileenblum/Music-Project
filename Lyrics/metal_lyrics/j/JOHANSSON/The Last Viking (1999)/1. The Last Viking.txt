the day is coming to an end, and
darkness is my only friend, only friend

adrift in the ocean, I'm lost in emotion,
the ship is my cradle, I long for the
stars, I'll trade my life, I just want to see
the stars!

an old and tired Viking, I'm soon to join
the sea, the darkness will embrace me,
the frost will set me free
I'm burning in my broken ship, my sails
are full of sorrow,
beyond is Valhall, vast and void, where
the gods will drink with me

the moon is floating in the rain, the
gods are laughing at my pain, at my
pain

a final decision, to meet with my
makers, they clouded my vision, I look
for the stars, I'll trade my life, I just want
to see the stars!

an old and tired Viking, I'm soon to join
the sea, the darkness will embrace me,
the frost will set me free I'm burning in
my broken ship, my sails are full of
sorrow, beyond is Valhall, vast and void,
where the gods will drink with me
