all in a flash of light

the truth is deep, the grave is shallow, a
deeper mystery found, but there's no
one to follow
I see myself, a burning fire, the clock is
ticking away, but I've never been higher

beyond the sky, is something there, I'm
asking why, too much to bear, I'll find
my peace, it's in the light

in the mirror, seeing clearer, I see my
soul

a flash of light, without a warning, the
spell was broken again, with the mist of
the morning
adrift in space, just like I'm falling, I
vanish into the wall, is it Death that is
calling

in the mirror, seeing clearer, seeing
nearer, reach into the light

all in a flash of light
