they say that love will never last, i really
thought so in the past, it didn't last

I always ways the last to know, but now
I'm going with the flow, i have to know

close to you, close to you, I don't want
to think it thru
close to you, close to you, all my
dreams are coming true
close to you, close to you, all my
dreams are coming true, they're
coming true

I never used to have a doubt, nothing
was waiting to come out, but now I
doubt
they say that love is never blind, but
now i think I lost my mind, I'm going
blind
