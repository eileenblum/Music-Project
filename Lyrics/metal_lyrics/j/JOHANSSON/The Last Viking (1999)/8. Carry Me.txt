I sometimes wonder why the years go
by, and in the end we always die
but when I held you close, time almost
froze, they say it's life but no one knows

carry, me through eternity, we're
holding the key, we'll always be free
carry, me through eternity, we're
holding the key, we'll always be free

this world has so much hate, we
shouldn't wait, I feel the force of love
and fate
I know you'll be OK, don't go away, we'll
live to fight another day
