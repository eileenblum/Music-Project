you took away my sense of destiny, we
laughed away so many days
too many miles apart to keep it real, we
had to go our separate ways

fading away, fading away, we saw the
light together, but now you fade away

I thought that life is either black or
white, the truth is somewhere in
between

fading away, fading away, we saw the
light together, but now you fade away
