rainy morning, and I look into your eyes,
see in the wonder, you're an angel in
disguise
windy evening, and you tell me all your
lies, tears are falling, and the love within
me dies

without a fear I have to turn around and
run, your crazy world will still be
spinning when I'm gone
I realize I feel like breathing on my own,
and I want to be alone

I want to be alone, I want to be alone

winter coming, the flowers are dying,
snow is falling, the angels are crying

your crazy world will still be spinning
when I'm gone, I feel like all the color's
going out
without a fear I have to turn around and
run, nobody knows what is all about
