Sin o' cism breeding prisons,
All at once in indecision,
Drop your rights as we divide the future,

Wonder why

They don't want you to wonder why
Don't want to free your mind
They just want you to go on blind and
Brave unto the point you die

To wonder why
To free the mind
The point you die

To wonder why.

Well they lie to us defy the trust
The future is it's them or all of us.
