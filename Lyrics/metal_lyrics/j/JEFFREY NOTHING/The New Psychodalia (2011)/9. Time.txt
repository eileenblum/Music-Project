In time we'll find a lake,
For our soul to drown in,
In their own weight (in their own weight)

Yes, in time appreciate
Can we all know tomorrow,
Or dying today (Or dying today)
Or dying today

In time we'll find a lake,
We'll find a lake
For our soul to drown in,
In their own weight
In time to take

Yes, in time appreciate
Can we all know tomorrow (we all know tomorrow)
Or dying today
Or dying today
We'll never win (or dying today)

In time learn to give it all away?

In time we'll find a lake (we'll find a lake)
For our soul to drown in,
In their own weight

Yes, in time appreciate
Can we all know tomorrow,
Or dying today

This happens overtime I choose to wake (I choose to wake),

In time we'll find a lake (we'll find a lake)
For our soul to drown in,
In their own weight

Yes, in time appreciate
Can we all know tomorrow,
Or dying today
Or dying today

(This happens overtime I choose to wake)
(We'll find a lake)

Let's parade the pompous for the party and
Realize that it's just as well and dive in
(In time)
