Mist thru the mirror
Particles of life discovered
Is this coming clear?
You cannot quell the life you've smothered.
Let's disappear down the hole of this bottomless moat
Never uncover the words none so ever will quote
Nobody say it.

Can I believe this much now?
Keeping deceased in touch
Our wealth, our world satisfied
How do you pacify?
Your lies they feed you life

How can you breath thru you lies?
How can you breathe it?

Nobody say it

We can all feel like we're drowning
Fell like we're failure
Til' we can cherish the color
Thru new psychodalia
Swim 'cause you've got
To win 'cause it's in you
Let the cycle continue around and
Fall down and follow me now
With new psychodalia.
