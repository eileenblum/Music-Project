Just erase what you've been chasing,
Doomed to monumentary pleasure,
Cannot confiscate, deface,
Or groom a heart enough to measure

If you could get a clue,
Mountains to move,
So much to prove yourself through,
Someone else's view

What's this all about?
You had it all, lost now
Cannot figure out you had it all,
Before the fall,

How'd you make me try?

Finish what you start,
Before you start another, heart apart,
The hard part's to survive the lies,
At peace like you're some kind of prize, or parasite,
Behaved inside this pretty piece of meat you've made,

All buttoned up and down and damned depraved.

Rehearsed melodrama days,
Prescription for the pain,
Have you got another shot for me?
I'd love to feel again,
Can't believe it all?
Can't conceive your fall from grace?
Have you lost the hunger?
Have we exhausted wonder?
Can you comprehend the end with me?
For one day we all cease to be.

Rehearsed melodrama days,
Prescription for the pain,
Have you got another shot for me?
I'd love to feel again,
Can't believe it all?
Can't conceive your fall from grace?

Can't believe it all?
Can't conceive your fall from grace?
