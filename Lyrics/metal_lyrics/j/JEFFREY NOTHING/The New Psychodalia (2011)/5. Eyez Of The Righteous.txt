Bleed with me feed the free chatter,
Smash a new face on the madman splatter,
Cast away pieces of hope,
Find a new drug,
Let you cope,
Make you crave and behave,
To yourself you're just the same,
In the eyes of the righteous state,
Counting down the days,

Locked in cages philosophical,
Defacing all life possible,

Do you leave a mark like you've been here,
Act like you're saints and we're all just sinners,
believe your beliefs give you hope,
As we all dangle from demons grown from dope,
Can your God restore my faith,
Make the whole world just the same?
Tho alive your minds a maze counting down the days,

Locked in cages philosophical,
Defacing all life possible,

Bleed with me,
Feed the free chatter,
Cast away pieces of hope,
Find a new drug,
Let you cope,
Make you crave and behave,
To yourself you're just the same,
In the eyes of the righteous state,
Counting down the days
