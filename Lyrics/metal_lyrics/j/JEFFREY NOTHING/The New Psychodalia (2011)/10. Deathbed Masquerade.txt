Another demon come to feed us,
Another peace for you to pray,

Another self is so defeatist,
Day after day
Watch as they walk away and

There's a place I call home,
Anywhere I'm all alone and
There's a face I don't know,
Anymore in the mirror.

Another day off your deathbed,
It's safe to say that
There is someone in my head again,

To feed us, to free us,
To feed us life in trade of death,

Mind can't categorize the damage inside,
Time can't mend the disguise,
You're hiding behind,

Mannequin, porcelain,
Break the skin within,
Hollow eyes beyond the disguise,
Saturate,
A million minds of a million faiths,
Fed your lies,
We all lost when you won the race.

This one's so close to call,
How many more will fall
To help us grow and take our place
Here in this masquerade?
Here in this masquerade?

There's a place I call home,
Anywhere I'm all alone and
There's a face I don't know,
Anymore in the mirror.

Another day off your deathbed,
It's safe to say that
There is someone in my head again,

To feed us, to free us,
To feed us life in trade of death,

Mind can't categorize the damage inside (inside),
Time can't mend the disguise,
