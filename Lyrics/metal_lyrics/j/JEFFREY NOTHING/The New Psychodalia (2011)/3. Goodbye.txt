Your land of make believe,
So thankfully we can see,
What's wrong with us?
We're strong to us

Belong and trust and believe all the lies
'til the cold fall skies,
You never question why,
Oh, behave be a happy slave,
Until it all falls down

Without a chance to wave
Without a chance to say,
Goodbye.
