Sabotaged the peace in me
Sold me on the shit
I should believe

Salutations crumbling
Hymns of hatred planted like a seed
Cut the bullshit
Why should I
BELIEVE?

Parasite, Goliath king
What say we go out for a swing?
Dead inside, somehow alive
You parasite, cut from behind
Your damned, deprived
There's no surprise
You're just a lie
Just a lie
(Just a lie)

Who are you to say what's right?
Divinity a privilege, not a prize

You haven't heard the last of me
I hope you wake up screaming from the lies
As they erase all hope inside your mind
(Mind, mind, inside your mind)
No matter what you think your soul is
MINE

Parasite, Goliath king
What say we go out for a swing?
Dead inside, somehow alive
You parasite, cut from behind
Your damned, deprived
There's no surprise
You're just a lie
Just a lie
(Just a lie)

Parasite, Goliath king
What say we go out for a swing?
Dead inside, somehow alive
You parasite, cut from behind
Your damned, deprived
There's no surprise
You're just a lie
Just a lie
(Just a lie)
