I'll never remember
Anything being
More ever after
A thing I believe in

Move for a master
The beast were all feeding
Fucking disaster
All for I'm bleedin'

(All for I'm bleeding)

Guiding our chariot
A cast of the damaged
Doing their damnedest
To pour the raw sewage

The incarnate beverage
To grind into pebbles
All who seek leverage
To move anything

(To move anything)

So why did we come here
Breed in the first place
If not to become much more
More than just a face

From this body we're hanging high
And yet were becoming
Perfectly numb to life
Alone in this casket

Well we pretend alive
And fail at it easy

Fail at it easy
I hope your satisfied
Dead inside.

I don't care, I cannot keep my cool
Pretend a life in punishment
In wonderment.
An oversight the fool

To breathe the air as ruled
(To breathe the air as ruled)
I sacrificed.
A sacrificial tool
Intelligence can't give an answer
An answer to your clue.

I don't care, I cannot keep my cool
