[Arch]

I've been living in the past 
Trying to live without you 
I can feel your presence here 
But I just can't touch you anymore 
Memories are all I have 
And your pictures fades from the light of another day 
Can you hear me call 
Call your name 

Cheyenne, I am 
I am so far away 
Can you feel our dreams 
They are slipping away 

I've been looking to the west 
Where the silent man can hear the harmony 
Of the children's song and its sweet refrain 
I just can't hear it anymore 
Memories are all I have 
Of the sun and stars dancing endlessly 
Can you hear me call 
Call your name 

Cheyenne, I am 
I am so far away 
can you feel our dreams 
They are slipping away 
I am, Cheyenne 
I am the sky, the wind, the rain 
In my dreams, my friend 
I can see you again 

Look behind my footprints in the sand 
This moment I stop to wonder 
Why I long for yesterday 
Tomorrow pulls me under 
All the while I wallow in the mire 
The moment just passed me by 
Sunrise, will you grace my eyes 
Bless my soul, make me whole again 

The voice of reason guides me home 
To the summit in the sky 
Where amber waves and endless days 
Celestial spheres catch our gaze 
Desperate cries prayers unanswered 
Angry are the faithless 
Who are they who left us here? 
The anthem loud the question is so very clear 
We stare into the stratosphere all alone 
All alone, all alone 

I am the salt of this lonely satellite 
A grain of sand the tide has washed ashore 
All I am 
All I am, nothing more 
You quote from the book of the names 
The words don't mean a thing anymore 
Forever more 
My mind has the will of the wind 

The cross you bear 
The martyrs clever disguise 
And my testament is seen with my own eyes 
You await angels of mercy 
Descend down through the sky 
I live among the living 
I'll live till I die 

I found a piece of mystical broken heart 
It's longing of the child left behind 
Till the end of all time 
That child had the will of the wind 
We've come to a place where the road divides 
And there's no turning back, not this time 
Are we mortal men or are you divine? 

The cross you bear 
The martyrs clever disguise 
And my testament is seen with my own eyes 
You await angels of mercy 
Descend down through the sky 
I live among the living 
I'd rather dance with the wolves 
Than stare at the sun 
Hear my confession 
I am alive 

And if it gives you solace 
Then pray for me in silence 
Just please save your pity 
And seek redemption for yourself 
And if from grace I've fallen 
Won't you forgive me and make me whole again 

I hear the voice of reason 
They speak to me in silence 
I feel I can't deny you 
I will deny your likeness of man 
I see Cheyenne is mourning 
She bleeds for all humanity 

And if it gives you solace 
Then pray for me in silence 
Just please save your pity 
And seek your redemption 
You can save it all for yourself 
And if from grace I've fallen 
Won't you forgive me and make me whole again 

I've been living in the past 
Trying to live without you 
I can feel your presence here 
But I just can't touch you anymore 
Memories are all I have 
And your pictures fades from the light of another day 
Can you hear me call 
Call your name 

Cheyenne, I am 
I am so far away 
Can you feel our dreams 
They are slipping away 
I am, Cheyenne 
I am the sky, the wind, the rain 
In my dreams, my friend 
I can see you again 
My friend 
Cheyenne 
This is the end.
