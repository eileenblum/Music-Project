[Arch/Matheos]

I open my eyes, was that real or was I dreaming 
I don't hit the ground, but I'm falling forever 
I'm close to the edge and I want to just fly away 
To silence the voices, is this the only way? 

I bring you my dreams that inspire imagination 
They are nothing like yours, so I lock them away again 
I lie to myself and believe that I'm healing 
The higher I climb, the longer I fall 

Crossing over burning bridges 
There's nothing left of you inside my mind 
The hourglass is long and empty 
The time has come to break the chains of misery 
Crossing over burning bridges 
There's nothing left of you inside my mind 
The hourglass is long and empty 
The time has come to break the chains of misery 

I remember skipping rocks across still waters 
And I remember chasing colors flying through thin air 
And I remember the water shone my first reflection 
I can't forget always waiting, I was wishing you were there 
You were never, never there 

Primadonna, she was sleeping with a stranger again 
Godforsaken and the savior hanging on the bedroom wall 
Contradictions, they manifest such deep resentmens in me 
Transparent one I'm not naive and you, you're not holier than thou 
Amen 

I'm inside you, I deny you 
I surround you, I defy you 
Hear the voices, they are godless 
No forgiveness, so relentless 

In the real world you feel real pain 
A never ending war inside, again and again 
Are you who you think you are, my life runs through your veins 
Try as you will, my son, try 
But you will not break the chains of misery 

I can feel anger rising like the sun rises every day that I'm here 
Now and then you return to open the wounds again and again 
Screaming voices conspire and critique every breath I take 
I remember as a child I said I loved you 
I remember the silence was so deafening 

I'm inside you, I deny you 
I surround you, I defy you 
Hear the voices, they are godless 
No forgiveness, so relentless 

In the real world you feel real pain 
A never ending war inside again and again 
Are you who you think you are, my life runs through your veins 
Try as you will, my son, try 
But you will not break the chains 

I've been living to die, I'm dying to live 
I'm here to break the chains of misery 
Silence the voices, the critical voices 
The psyche of a child is a ravenous thing 
When nothing's ever good enough, there's so much suffering 

Why do we run, there's no place to hide 
Tangled in the strand that can bury us alive 
Yes it can 
The spiral is up and down, twisting our fate around 
The bird in the cage sings a beautiful song 
Because it's bound by the strand 

Alive in me, voices lie to me 
It's never good enough for them 
They always want more than I am 
You put your hand in the cage 
Now you're bleeding and the bird is free 
Apathetic apologies are the offerings 
As the world grows so cold suddenly 
You're just another lost soul, so join me, join me 
Cause misery loves company 

Crossing over human bridges 
A child is born, he's looking up to me 
We're skipping rocks across the waters 
That rise above the depths of woe is me 

Crossing over human bridges 
A child is born, he's looking up to me 
(Why do we run, there's no place to hide 
Tangled in the strand that can bury us...) 
We're skipping rocks across the waters 
That rise above the depths of woe is me 
(The spiral is up and down, twisting our fate around 
The bird in the cage sings a beautiful song cause it's bound...) 

Why do we run, there's no place to hide 
Tangled in the strand that can bury us alive 
Yes it can 
The spiral is up and down, twisting our fate around 
The bird in the cage sings a beautiful song 
Because it's bound by the strand.
