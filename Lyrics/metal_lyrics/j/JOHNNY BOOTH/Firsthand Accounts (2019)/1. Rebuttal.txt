Please fill me in, it's gone over my head
All the trends have gone rotten all the preachers pretend
Fake
You're a fake
When you break the skin
My hands start shaking when the words leave your mouth
Addiction becomes us when supply is running out
Constantly present we're used to the threat
I've abandoned my mission
I've been placing my bets
Fake
You're a fake
When you break the skin
My hands start shaking when the words leave your mouth
Addiction becomes us when supply is running out.
