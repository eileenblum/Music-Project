I know about all the cryptic words that they would speak
Face in her hands as the drug in her veins peak
We mourn the loss of the bridge and the distance
Cursing the name under my fucking breath
A photograph within my hand
The whole world worships a burning city
I can't keep digging holes for your loss
We now worship the burning city
Behold the seed of doubt
And may they pray before the end

The marbled eyes walk to the sight of open jaw
Answers will never be revealed
A photograph within my hand
The whole world worships a burning city
I can't keep digging holes for your loss
We now worship the burning city
I will cut it, you will watch me cut
Cut it
I will cut it, watch me cut it
Cut it
I will cut it
Watch me cut it
Watch me cut it
I'm lost inside apathy
Misplaced aggressions took me to the location
I'm lost inside apathy
This disillusion is staring at me

All eyes off
Plant your thoughts
And praise into the mouth of the pale flame
All eyes off
Plant your thoughts
And praise into the mouth of the pale flame.
