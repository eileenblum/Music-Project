Hide your voices
Headless horses
Find the fear that you breathe
Think of what's expected
The proud and soulless
They're always watching
Go and lay beside them
Kinetic whispers are set in motion
Right on time
Hide your voices
Headless horses
Find the fear that you brought to me
I always cover the footprint
I leave no trace for the thief
Right on time
The act of aggression expanding within us
I've been accused of it all
Now you're accusing us all
I watched you
Come from nothing
Live with nothing
Be the nothing
This place was built before the passion set in
When after all the definition takes the shape of what's to come
The cause
The kill
The rot inside of your home
White circles wrap around the ones that want to play the victim
Giving up the search for ghosts
It's all over
Wishing that the price on my head makes you profit
Right on time
I will be remembered
For running through all your hearts and minds with sharpened teeth
I always cover the footprint
I leave no trace for the thief.
