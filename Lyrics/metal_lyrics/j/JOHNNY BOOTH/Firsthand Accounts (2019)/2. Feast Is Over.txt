I've been living under the gun and it's taking aim

For all the hearts of the faithful, the blinded, the weakest minded, the ones who can't speak
We never knew what we were up against 'til it's too late
A restless crowd on the hunt for a victim,
A headless presence rips us open
You took the first step just to be roped in
The ship has sunk yet you still grab anchors
Citizens die with their eyes open

Restrained by our fate
This is accepted by most, desired by heartless serpents
The graves that we dug, were always way too shallow
Way too shallow
We took the first step, now find your purpose
The ship has sunk yet you still grab anchors
His eyes are fixed on curtains
Bring on the bait and switch
I see right through it
From the first, to the last, you changed the past
Our deaths creep in slowly
Divisive acts rewarded with a roaring
Send it all back
Exist in failure while they run free.
