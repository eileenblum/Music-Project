Time is just a concept
That made us believe in our destiny

But if the scriptures have ink to dry, I'm not believing
We can always try to go home,
But that doesn't mean the door will open
It's all about how you follow
People in this world but I won't follow
We washed out green shores for leaders
We carried the words of the wise
'Til the weight that our backs could hold no longer
Could hold no longer
We embrace the walls we created
Grew to love them,
Even police them
Don't tell us what we need to hear
We know the answers will never be heard

We sealed it all up
With broken bricks and crystal ashes
Take hold of our senses one at a time
It's all about how you follow people in this world
You put your praise into a symbol
Right before we lost it all

Beliefs and torture sewn together
Die sweet prince of the massacre
For their solution, we bought into excuses
Burned our rights
Mass extinction
Carry me home as you predicted
We lost ourselves in the grand scheme of all of it
Chains and ankles they march towards the surface, chains and ankles they march
I took a chance now my mind is up for sale
Business of life not my belief
This life I take to my mass grave
We are what tears ourselves apart
I'm indebted to the static voice that speaks to me
I'm indebted to the having
Wanting
Needing.
