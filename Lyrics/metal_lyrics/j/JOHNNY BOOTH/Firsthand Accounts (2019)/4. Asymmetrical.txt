I said the answers are written on my throat
And when the radiation and rubber bullets have killed
Any symptom of the sickness I call hope
There has to be a better way
We gave it all away, we gave it all
Another breath, another patient
Another book to sink us all
To sink us all
We're made of broken people,
Locked up in our own thoughts

We, we came up empty handed, week after week
How can this stress even carve out
When death hangs his head to our bones
A true sense of doubt

Inside of the our rib cage where leaders protect bank accounts
Traces of a new republic
Traces of a new republic by my own hands
We are all shells of a mountain, but we're not ready
We are all shells of a mountain, but we're not ready to be asymmetrical
So we walked past the stones, right beneath the reservation
Just to find our descent on our own
I said the answers are written on my throat
But when the radiation and rubber bullets have killed
Any symptom of the sickness I call hope

And when we buried all the scraps and the parts
I'll come to terms with what we have lost
I admit I admit I admit it
We are the parts that make up the 'cause
She's so calm and so collected with the people she's selected
She bows with perfect posture as she sees the world reflected

With my fingers now connected to the spine with punctuation
We drown the veins devoid to define emancipation
The atmosphere's collapsing on the words of lost distinction
The reason for harsh actions and the plot for our distraction
What were we thinking of
When we cast a vote just to hang our own selves
As we cringe and watch our leaders
All the whispers drain from their eyes
But it's all
It's all wrong
When you drag us to the bottom
We won't be symmetrical
We won't be symmetrical.
