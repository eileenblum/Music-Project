Strangle the life back
Into the conscious
Inside you'll find a crown tied to my waist
When you fade,
When I fall,
The mistakes become reckless
And I know what went wrong with that filthy habit
You'll find me basking in the dust of a planet
It's the cross you bear,
The thought you kneel to
All the knives came out at sunset
All the knives came out at sunset
We're counting a loss
We're facing a crisis
All the knives came out
Enemies have left it to chance,
But I traveled all the distances on my own
I'll find the meaning of value
From your last seconds on the throne
Create the language
Erase what's written

Before the righteous
Choke on your wisdom
Create the language
Erase what's written
Before the righteous
Choke on your wisdom
Creatures you are
We're stranded
When will they notice that we're slowly sinking

Facing the wells of extinction
Skies open up
Points to hell
Show yourself and be damned
Rotting out the world
Crowns sink us all.
