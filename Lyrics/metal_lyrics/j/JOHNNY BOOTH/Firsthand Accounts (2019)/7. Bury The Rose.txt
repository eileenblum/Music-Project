I said my piece
In the first place
I'm not the one
I'm the two, but I keep counting still
I broke theses roads into sections just to find the meaning for this
I danced with the thought of closure
I sacrificed my arms, my legs, of morality
But all I hear is "Fare thee well"
I'm in the presence of a pretense
I bought my ticket but there's no turning back
Never trust a man in a free fall
You had a thought but it turned into nothing
Another reason the tank is on empty

There's just no point in coming back for the same thing
You had a thought but it turned into nothing
Another reason the tank is on empty

There's just no point in coming back for the same thing
Eye of the storm

Watching the fall
Counting the crosses as they form
Eye of the storm

Watching the fall
Counting the crosses forming
And everything that came apart
We feel the silence of god
We wait for answers to fall

We are the center of the bliss that torments this
We break the mold to only find ourselves in it
I've given the best of me
Heartbreaker
You've stolen everything
Of the bliss that torments this
We break the mold to only find ourselves in it
I buried the rose on top of my head

It is the truth on trial
It feels like I've been waiting forever
It feels like I've been taking the place of the prisoner
Taking the place of the prisoner
Placing the chains around my neck
Forcing anger, they try to break
But I promise I'll make the last mistake.
