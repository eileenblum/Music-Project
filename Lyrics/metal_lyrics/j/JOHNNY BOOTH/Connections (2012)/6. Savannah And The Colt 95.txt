We're ripping out
our organs in the face of danger
we're burning Georgia
we're burning Georgia, for the lust of freedom and glory.

We have to tear it all down before we
Bring it back again.
We are the young and haggard suffering from dementia.
Young and haggard, soak me in acid
To stop the skin
From melting away
Melting away
No one has been proven guilty
But I suspect you

Your minds are made of marble
Your minds are made of marble.

Your to concerned to knowÂ [x3]
So I will take on all your heroes

Doubtful gasps of oxygen, excuse my breathÂ  Â 
Excuse my breath from her waistband.
Tightly separate these fictional fucking voices.

These fictional fucking voices [x4]
