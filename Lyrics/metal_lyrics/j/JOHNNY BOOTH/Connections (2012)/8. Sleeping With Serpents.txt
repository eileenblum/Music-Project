The crown hangs over the giant must be
Killed before crisis gets back to the queen.
Proceed with caution, the past is future.
the enemy is much closer then she appears.
The death of birth
The life of bitter men
These smoke and mirrors, dilutions of grandeur. Â 

Consume my eyes for I do not wish to see, Tragedy
Will seep through all the ashes
Tragedy will seep through all the ashes
And our happiness was found in the belly of,
Regret is what I live for now
Regret is what I live for now.

There's nothing I hate more then your affection
Destroy us and infect believers.
The crown hangs over the giant must be
Killed before crisis gets back to the queen.
God forbid royalty begins to fade
Save us from her, save us from us.

The snake reveals her self as such.
I'll fight dishonesty with my bottled revenge.
You will destroy your own self
And I will prevail
You play these head games
But it's you that wakes up alone.
I hope your faults
I hope your faults
Own you for life. Â
