Constant reminder
Presence of eyes and matching step
Presence of eyes and matching step
At my back I feel hallow winds, Lurking
Photo brigade.
Can't go back, we can't go back

Strangers peering through
Weaker traits of a ghost
Fallows me everywhere I go.
Rivers are running through me.
I'll pry these wounds open I'll pry these wounds
And I'll pry these wounds
And I'll pry these wounds.

Widows stood ten feet
Concrete walls shot passed my neck
This can't be, my battles internal
Honesty has never
Been worth any of your time.
Pale demons, Expression of a last day
This can't be, my battles internal.
Sockets,
Memories,
an emptiness
And all the transparencies,
These words have failed our kind.

Wisdom, the last conviction
A false faith cycles into oblivion
And these blue nerves will rise up
Uncover portraits.
Cancerous lions den please hang me to
Strangle this life right out of my body.
Terrible lips.
It's never been harder to wake up every morning
Always behind me, pulling the strings
Open up and bleed for me.
There willfull
Ammunition
We will strike at the hearts of mountains.

They march us into our black hole [x4]
They march
Black hole

Presence of eyes and matching step[x4]

The revolt of the damned
Save your breath, save your last breath
The revolt of the damned
Save your breath, save your last breath

This selfish mistake
Seizes my guts,
this ache in my chest
Must either break or turn into lead
Must either break or turn into lead
Must either break or turn to lead save yourself before there is nothing left.
