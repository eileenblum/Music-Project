Hack away the unessential

Giants, have revealed our true selves.
Checkerboard mistresses
Is this what you always wanted?
Phallic blades
for a new death washing away our clones.
Addressing the ones that already know.

I'm breaking out of this place
With an unwavered pressure and a world of time.
I've lost patience
This stories departure
Soft clear cuts, self-loathing will win
Crimson tumor, an abandoned dark seeded day.
You'll be hopeless.
The inevitable.

This is a glimpse of what you've become, [x2]
A blessing to puncture a lung
This is your war.

End of silent day
Just give her a moment to ruin your night-
mare's scorching I'm losing control. Absent respect
I'd rather be alone.

You wouldn't want to understand I'm locked inside a cavity.

I Just can't sit back.
The writings are encrypted, bone yards for the thirsty.
The more you try to forget
The more it seems to appear
The more you try to forget
The more it seems to appear.
Fractured the earth, with shark fins and dark clouds.

Oh the rain has never been, so acidic.
Like fists pressed along, batteries raised
From the last season.
But not forgotten
Now foaming at the mouth,
These painless substances.
Shriek down hallways
From wall to wall,
till it's on the tip of every tongue.
