[M+L: Ken Hensley]

she came to me one morning 
one lonely sunday morning 
her long hair flowing in the midwinter wind 

I know not how she found me 
for in darkness I was walking 
destruction lay around me 
from a fight I couldn't win 

oh lady lend your hand I cried 
or let me rest here at your side 
have faith and trust in me she said 
and filled my heart with life 

there is no strength in numbers 
have no such misconception 
but when you need me be assured 
I won't be far away
