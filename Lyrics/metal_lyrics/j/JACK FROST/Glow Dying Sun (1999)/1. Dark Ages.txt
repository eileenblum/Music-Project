we saw this world shining bright 
oh, days in paradise 
back to the dark ages 
where I still belong 
back to the dark ages 
where I always was 
back to the dark ages 

and the sun was shining bright 
oh, we had days in paradise 
I'm going back to the dark ages 
where I still belong 
back to the dark ages 
where I always was 
back to the dark ages
