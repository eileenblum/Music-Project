oh, you burned my soul 
oh, you did so 
all my soul is crawling back to you 

I know I hurt you 
as deep as no one could do 
no matter I apologize to you 

oh, I did so 
the worst crime I know 
no matter I apologize to you 

[Chorus:]
you find me everyday 
I'm sad in every way 
I wanted you to stay 
all my soul is crawling back to you
