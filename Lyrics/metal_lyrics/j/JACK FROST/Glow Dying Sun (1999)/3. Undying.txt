we started against the tide 
we were young and time was flying 
we came to see that we're undying 
we came to see that we're undying 

as we sleep the moon is hiding 
while we drink days are crying 
how we tried to be undying 
how we tried to be undying 

[Chorus:]

cold is the rain 

we started against the tide 
we were young and time was flying 
as we sleep the moon is hiding 
while we drink days are crying 
we came to be undying 
we came to be undying
