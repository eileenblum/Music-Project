stone cold breeze 
as I walk 
in the dawn 
eternal sleep 

walls they breathe 
as I talk 
to myself 
anguish creeps 

[Chorus:]
worship my ashes 
when I'm gone 
don't let me vanish 
into oblivion 

my senses bleed 
as I see 
my body drown in 
infinity 

stone cold breeze 
as I walk 
in the dawn 
eternal sleep
