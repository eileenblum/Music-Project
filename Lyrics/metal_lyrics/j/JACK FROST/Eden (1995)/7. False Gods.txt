day by day 
in my cold life 
I wait 
for my last ride 

emptiness 
for me to bear 
beyond 
I will be there 

it's always me to pay 
to false gods I prayed 

once again 
I entreat you 
my mind 
is looking forward to: 

it's always me to pay 
to false gods I prayed 

[Chorus:]
into the maelstrom 
fade away 
in the darkness 
sway
