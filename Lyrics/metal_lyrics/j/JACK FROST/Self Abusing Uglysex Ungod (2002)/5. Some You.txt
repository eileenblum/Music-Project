[L: PHINSTER]

I WALK IN EMPTY ROOMS 
THEY REMIND ME OF SOME YOU 
WHEN I FOUND YOUR NOTE 
LYING ON THE FLOOR 
BY THE DOOR 

[REF:]
ALL THE LEAVING TRAINS 
THEY NEVER COME AGAIN 
SHE'S LIKE THE POURING RAIN 
SHE'S SOAKING ME INSANE 
BUT I CAN LAUGH ABOUT IT 
BECAUSE IT ALWAYS MAKES ME CRY 

REMEMBER BETTER DAYS 
EVERY TIME 
SHE LEFT 
AGAIN
