[L: MORALES]

YOU SPIT YOUR MOURNFUL LIFE 
RIGHT BETWEEN MY EYES 
MY UNSEEN INSANE I 
REVEALING MY DISGUISE 

[REF:]
AND YOUR WEEPING IN THE NIGHT 
WAKES THE SLEEPING DOGS INSIDE 
SO I TAKE YOU ON A RIDE 
INTO THE ABYSS OF MY MIND 

MY UNSEEN INSANE I 
REVEALING MY DISGUISE 

[REF:]
AND YOUR WEEPING IN THE NIGHT 
WAKES THE SLEEPING DOGS INSIDE 
I TAKE YOU ON A RIDE 
INTO THE ABYSS OF MY MIND 
SCREAMIN' HELL I TAKE YOUR LIFE 
AND I'LL WEAR BLACK UNTIL I DIE
