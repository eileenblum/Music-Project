[L: ROSSOS]

DEEP IN MY INNER SELF 
BURIED IN ASHES AND STONES 
WIND AND RAIN 
IN MY SOUL 
A FALLEN FAIRY GODMOTHER 
IS WAITING FOR THE LIGHT 

[REF:]
SO RISE AGAIN 
DANCE TO A WALL OF TEARS AND PAIN 
RISE UP AGAIN 
DANCE TO THE WALL OF TEARS AND PAIN 

SHE WILL BE RELEASED 
COMING UP 
LIKE A GODDESS IN HELL 
PLEASE DON'T STOP THE DANCE 
BEFORE THE END OF MY TIME 

[REF:]
SO RISE AGAIN 
DANCE TO A WALL OF TEARS AND PAIN 
RISE UP AGAIN 
DANCE INTO MY LIFE OF TEARS AND PAIN
