[L: KEVIN RICH]

IT FEELS AS IF I'M LOSING ME 
I RUN AROUND I'VE GONE TO GROUND 
I'M NOWHERE 

THE WHOLE WORLD KNOWS EXEPT FROM ME 
THIS BLOODY THING WILL NEVER BE 
IT'S OVER 

I'M IN THE NIGHT I SEARCH FOR LIGHT 
YOU SEE THE SHADOWS THAT I FIGHT 
I'M SOBER 

I NEED A SLEEP THAT NEVER ENDS 
THIS BLOODY THING WILL NEVER BE 
IT'S OVER 

[REF:]
LIKE AN ANGEL IN DARKEST SKIES 
I FLY AWAY 
JUST BE PATIENT AND COME WITH ME 
ON A TRIP INTO DARKER SKIES 
AND YOU ARE THE MOON 
AND EVERY DAY IS A STAR 

AND I BELIEVE I'VE NEVER LIED 
I'VE KEPT MY TRUTH SO DEEP INSIDE 
I'M SOBER 

IT WAITS IN PLACES THAT I HIDE 
IT SHINES LIKE HATRED IN MY EYES 
IT'S OVER 

AND MOTHER MARY SLEEPS WITH ME 
IS WAITING THERE FOR ME 
SHE IS WAVING 

AND EVERYONE WHO EVER LIED 
TOLD BITTER TRUTH IS DYING 
AND IT'S OVER
