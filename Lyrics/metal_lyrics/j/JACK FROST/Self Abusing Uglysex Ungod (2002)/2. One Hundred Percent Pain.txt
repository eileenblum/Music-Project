[L: PHINSTER]

DREAMS BOTHER ME 
DYING WAS SO HARD 
I HEAR VOICES IN MY HEAD 
TELLING ME ALMOST EVERYTHING 

THE CLOCK UPON THE WALL 
STRIKES THE WITCHING HOUR AGAIN 
I AM AWAKE BUT I AM STILL 
IN A DREAM 

[REF:]
EVERYDAY BRINGS THE SAME OLD PAIN 
FROM MY HEART 
AND EVERY NIGHT 
IT'S JUST THE SAME 

THE CLOCK UPON THE WALL 
STRIKES THE WITCHING HOUR AGAIN 
AND LEADS ME TO A DOOR 
INTO ANOTHER WORLD 

ANOTHER SLEEPLESS NIGHT 
AND ANOTHER RAINY DAY 
IT'S DRIVING ME INSANE
