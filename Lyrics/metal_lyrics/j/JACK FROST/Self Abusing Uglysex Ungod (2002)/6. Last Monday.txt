[M: THE PRIESTS, L: HARRY HOORTIG]

MY SHIP OF LOVE IS SINKING IN THE RAIN 
THE ICY RAIN 
THE MAST IS BROKEN AND THE SAILS ARE TORN 
TORN BY NAILS 
THE CAPTAIN'S ROOM IS BURNING BRIGHT 
AND LIGHTS THE SEA 
THE CREW HAS LEFT THE DROWNING 
SHIP BEHIND 
WITHOUT ME 

AND NOW I'M DROWNING WITH THE RATS 
THE WRECK GOES DOWN AND FURTHER DOWN 
AND WHERE NO SHIPBELLS EVER RING 
NO HUMAN'S EYE WOULD SEE MY HEADSTONE 
IN THE SEA 

[REF:]
ON MONDAY LAST MONDAY 
DID YOU HEAR MY CALL 
CATCH MY FALL 
ON MONDAY LAST MONDAY 
I NEEDED YOU 
MORE THAN YOU COULD KNOW 

WHY DID I LEAVE THE HARBOUR WALLS 
OF YOUR LOVE 
AS I COULD SEE A STORM ARISE 
THE WIND SO ROUGH 
I THOUGHT MY FUTURE WOULD BE MILES AWAY 
FAR FROM YOU 
AND NOW THE FORTUNE I WAS TOLD 
HAS COME TRUE 

AND NOW I'M DROWING IN THE SEA 
THE TROUBLED WATER'S KILLING ME 
IT TAKES ME DOWN AND FURTHER DOWN 
I WISH I WOULD HAVE NEVER LEFT YOU 
LIKE A THIEF
