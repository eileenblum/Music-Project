[L: PHINSTER]

THEY WILL NEVER FIND YOU 
YOU'RE IN THE LONELY PLACE 
YOU'VE BUILT 
THEY WILL NEVER STOP YOU 
YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY TO HELL 
DRESSED TO CHILL 

THEY WILL NEVER TREAT YOU RIGHT 
WHEN THEY LOOK INTO YOUR EYES 
THEY LIVE THEIR LIVES 
THAT YOU NEVER WANT TO LIVE 
BUT HOW DOES IT FEEL 

[REF:]
TAKE A LOOK BEHIND 
ALL THE THINGS YOU'VE NEVER SEEN 
RAIN DOWN SO HARD 
THEY ALL GET REAL 

THEY WILL NEVER FIND YOU 
THEY WILL NEVER STOP YOU 
THEY WILL NEVER GET YOU 
THEY WILL NEVER CHANGE YOUR MIND 
BUT HOW DOES IT FEEL 

IT MEANS NOTHING TO ME
