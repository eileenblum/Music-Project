So are you gone now
And is this forever
Forever and ever
So are you gone now
Is it me and my drink now
And is this forever
Forever and ever

[chorus:]
Where will I find my end
Alone in the cold and winter rain
Forever and never
You know how it feels
My empty bloody life
Is ruined forever

So you are gone now
And this is forever
Forever and ever
So you are gone now
Itâs me and my drink now
This is forever
Forever and ever

[chorus:]
Where will I find my end
Alone in the cold and winter rain
Forever and never
You know how it feels
My empty bloody life
Is ruined forever
Where will I find my end
Alone in the cold and winter rain
Forever and never
I follow close behind
I will be with you soon

Or are you coming back
Iâm waiting at the bar
And I want to pay
