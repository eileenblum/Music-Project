Only me and dark and you
Let me live again
Insanity breaks loose
I canât give again

[chorus:]
Oh no no, I put my trust in you
Too long ago that I looked to you
I go the way, away
The way Iâve never seen before
And I lay me down to die

Torturing myself visions so cruel
Visions so cruel
Oh how I wish that I were you
I wish that I were you
