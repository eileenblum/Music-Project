I have to go now
And leave my life undone
I turned my head away
From the fools who still remain
Waiting for the shadow
That consumes me

[chorus:]
I know I still believe
In things I learned so long ago

What is gone is gone
Waiting for the shadow
That comes to swallow me

[chorus:]
I know I still believe
In things I learned so long ago
I am standing here alone
And I fear I have to go

And Iâm still waiting here
Where all my dreams have died
And Iâm still waiting here
Where all my dreams have died
And I fear I have to go
