far away from the mainland
there's an island of the damned
an island of the poor men
where all emotion must die

there's no way out of this exile
heaven should be my place
all I have is just the bottle
it is the only rescue

[Chorus:]
how will I sleep
will I be satisfied
how will I sleep
will I see you again

this is the time
when this world ain't mine
where everybody and everything
is wrong
and I get nothing at all
