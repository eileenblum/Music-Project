I see the sun in your eyes
when I drown in your arms
and sink in the dark
in these dead sands
of an unknown shore

I see the sun in your soul
as I die in your arms
and I see you descending
into silent suicide
on your lost shore

[Chorus:]
black sun dawning in
your soul
hollow soul

you see the sun in my eyes
when you're fucking my soul
and you stifle my life
with this shallow sands
that know nothing for sure

and I see you descending
into silent suicide
on your lost shore

[Chorus:]
black sun dawning in
your soul
hollow soul

into silent suicide
on your lost shore
