darkest night brought me
a surprise
I was beginning to
see the light
a blind man's light
may sunshine rise

when daylight fades
I have to leave
this one way street
it is a desert road

[Chorus:]
and the tears are falling
down
I shed my tears to wet
the ground
come on let it grow

but we all were sowing
bad seeds
like we always do
seeds of anger
bad seeds

[Chorus:]
and the tears are falling
down
I shed my tears to wet
 the ground
come on let it grow
