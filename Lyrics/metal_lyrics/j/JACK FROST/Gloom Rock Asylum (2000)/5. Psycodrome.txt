the days are long when I roam
still I breed my psychodrome

my wounds won't heal overnight
still I chase the moonshine bright

[Chorus:]
my whores and friends and lovers
hear my cry
give me pain and make me
feel alive

why cry over what is done
when there is nowhere left to run

screen my mind do me wrong
I will be king when you're gone
