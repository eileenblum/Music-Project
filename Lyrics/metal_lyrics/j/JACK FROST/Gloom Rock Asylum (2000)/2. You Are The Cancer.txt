how does it feel to see you
die by my hand
how will I feel when my
suffering will end

will I bleed or will I
suffocate in pride
you and me we will play
the dying-game tonight

[Chorus:]
into the abyss
down by my hatred
away from me
you are the cancer
growing inside me
get away from me

how does it feel to see you
die by my hand
how will I feel when my
suffering will end
