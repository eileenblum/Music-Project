all the leaves are brown
and the sky is grey
I've been for a walk
on a winter's day

I'd feel safe and warm
if I was in L.A.

[Chorus:]
california dreamin'
on such a winter's day

stopped into a church
I passed along the way
I got down on my knees
and I pretend to pray

you know the preacher 
likes the cold
he knows I'm gonna stay

[Chorus:]
california dreamin'
on such a winter's day

all the leaves are brown
and the sky is grey
if I didn't tell her
I could leave today
