in my four walls 
I'm alone 
all the good things 
have gone 
and I drink and dream 
I'm waiting for the nightfall 
because I'm dying 
oh I'm dying of crying 
over you 

now life has changed 
I see colours so strange 
now my life is just like hell 
a walking spirit deadly pale 

[Chorus:]
I'm waiting for the nightfall 
the end of my days 
no more tomorrow 
I've missed today 

when life makes a change 
all the people seem so strange 
now my life is just like hell 
I'm a walking spirit and I'm 
deadly pale
