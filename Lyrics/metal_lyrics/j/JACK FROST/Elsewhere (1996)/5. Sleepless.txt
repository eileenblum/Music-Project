I remember the time 
when I was an man 
feeling like born again 
a member of your game 
and now I'm dying in vain 

so silent and grey 
and my spirit passed away 
these days 
life is sad 
I feel the pain 
and all my days are filled 
with rain 

[Chorus:]
where's my sleeping past 
always with me 
night and day 
are you sleeping now 
because again 
I'm going down
