it is life's will 
things come down on me 
you know everyday 
I try to leave 

how dare you 
be part of me 
I wish you 
get rid of me 

it's my mind's dream 
to be far away 
I'm sentenced to life 
in endless grief 

[Chorus:]
the one to lose am I 
oh how I wish to die 
all your pain is mine 
until the end of my time 

how dare you 
belong to me 
I'm slave to you 
eternally
