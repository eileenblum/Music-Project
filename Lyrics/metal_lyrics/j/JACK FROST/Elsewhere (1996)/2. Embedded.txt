stormy winds blow 
inside of my head 
blackened skies show 
wherever I am 
ambitions wasted 
stranded again 
all gone but hatred 
in a weary soul 

I am but a shadow 
of my former self 

[Chorus:]
creeping on 
in gloomy rain 
in swamps of grey 

now I embrace my fear 
surrender unto pain 
agony unfolding 
and silence closing in
