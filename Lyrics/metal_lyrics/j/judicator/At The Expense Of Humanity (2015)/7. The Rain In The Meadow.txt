Rays of sunshine through the haze in these melancholy days
A mind who's blinded by the pathos til the nerve is burned and numb

Have I gone too far?
A fallen star, but did I ever really shine?
Blur the lines and pray, but not to god, I yearn the flawed embrace of man

I feel the lines have thus been blurred
The catalyst of mine occurred 
Bent the straw and broke the line
This new reality of mine
