Between rage and sorrow
We sense approaching death
The drugs put him to sleep
He's conscious less and less

He will come back to us, god will not abandon
I gave him life and I won't see my pride and joy slip away
I know that I hide alone, but I will never leave you
I wouldn't have you take this path of what I'll soon become

Please
Sitting in corners alone
Please come back to me
No
Trust in the gift of life
He will pass on in the night
Lies
I hope that I may be wrong
God will relieve those with faith
Please
I will not give up on you
I'm bracing myself for the storm

Storm! I will not yield
I know that you would pray
But no prayers will sound while that thing is still around

I just can't take it all, this constant hate and fear
Like a snake the circles round and round and feasts upon itself
I know that you two butt heads, but can't we let that rest?
My son is dying here and still you can't put differences aside?!

He
Will you consider my words?
I just want to be alone
I
How can we deal with this shit?
You've already danced with death
Then
We could go on in shifts
There's no sense dealing with him
Trust
How can I trust in you people?
It is your only choice

Madness
Can I be set free?
No more
Now show yourself
Selfish
Picking on my brother's wife
Stop now
His poor love
Cold bitch
Just leave her alone
Please, now!
Everything's ending
Snide jabs
Leave the girl alone
Michael!
It's good that my brother can't see

Now
Watching the strength in her heart
Tolerance comes to an end
So
Now you can see why I left
Stories have come to life
Yes
A glimpse into broken minds
Everyone carries burden
But
Don't let it fester in you
I know that it's my sacrifice
