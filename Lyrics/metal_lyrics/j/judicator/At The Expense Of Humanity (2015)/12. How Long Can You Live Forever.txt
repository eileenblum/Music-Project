Resting in fields of a nebula, I rise from my throne of stars
There to my right is a gaseous form, and I speak but no words come forth

Colors burn the human eye
Godlike structures etched in time
Paradox of change divine, cast from shadows
We're all one creature, life form, cell, and form divine
I am bleeding into the cup of immortality 

Mockery of human form
Spirit child, you're now reborn
Enter through these astral gates, fly beyond and seal your fate
Dreaming of you now, wondering if you're still here
Move through the arches, the dark behind the doorway now

Glitches of gold in the sky above me, wince at its light as you cry in glory
Now that you have eternity at your hands, will you find all you sought before?

Fantasy renewed yet different
Given life anew but skewed and warped  

You've made the progress and done me proud
I'll call you family and lift the shroud
Bestowed my wisdom upon the noble meek
There is reward for those who seek
I found thy wisdom, but at a price
Gave up all that I am, soon I will forget that I was once a being with everlasting hope
And yet I learned the lesson, shed the mask and coped

Pass the light, remember the fallen
I will be the King of Rome
Singing songs to honor the loved
You will be the King of Rome

Given the choice of how to live
Honor my family scarred and torn
Cancer is just a part of life
Everyone tumbles in the flames
There is no reason to explain anything by the hand or will of God

Life's a burden, love is loss
You're not a winner when you don't even play
Give it all and it's not enough
Nothing that's worthwhile comes without some pain
