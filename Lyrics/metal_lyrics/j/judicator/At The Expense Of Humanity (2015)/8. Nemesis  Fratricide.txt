Waiting for heaven to shine
Watching the life force of my brother drain away

Carried on through hellish halls; dimly lit, I hear the calls 
(You can't save me) 
I'm breaking down

Family weeps together and the presence of another man
(Michael Andrus) has just arrived

- I am the father of the man who's dying here - 
- This is my power, authority of god - 
I carried hopes with me that somehow we'd avoid these ego games and sport for your control

Life, after this life, after this death 
(You're wandering in a lucid nightmare now)
To be the wraith who wanders endlessly through space
(You're looking death in its pallid face this time)

Carry me away and split this soul apart
In this wold of mine inside my head
Carry me away and bring me to the edge
To the edge of consciousness and pride

Skies of grey and howling wind, let the combat trial begin
(Fratricidal) 
We'll spill the blood

- My son has little chance to make it through this hell -
- His guts are liquefied and chemo treatment's failed - 
I cannot say that you are wrong or you are right
But words from you are venom, no agreement is in sight

Life, ending his life, mercy disguised 
(You're withdrawing into lucid nightmares now)
He'll be the wraith who wanders endlessly through space
(You're looking into a fantasy this time)

Carry me away to dream forevermore 
In this world I'm promised to explore
Carry me away and bring me with you there
To where pain is gone and dreams are real

Dancing starlight
Dance with me
Dancing starlight

Time, time to decide, palaver's time 
(Time to decide what to do with dying men)
To be the man who holds authority of god's kind will
(This vanity illusion will decay)

When the bastard son is held into the light
Pass the light and praise the King of Rome
When the bastard son is old enough to rule
Then your reign will end by Mordred's hand
