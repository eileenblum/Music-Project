Cast aside the impulse of my fear
Leave behind the world you once held dear

I feel cursed by heaven
Cut loose my frustrations
Lead to darkest waters
Treading in the void of death

I'm ready to deny (the body of your waking life)
I'm ready to defy

Fall asleep, I'll meet you there (Burning the fray!)
Sacrifice your waking life
Count the sheep until you fade (Burning the fray!)
Then your feet will touch the shore

He gasps, raspy breathing
No more life support and 
He's swimming on his own
Circling the void he will roam

I watch my brother die 
(The mind of your waking life)
I ask the heavens, "Why?"

Fall asleep, I'll meet you there (Burning the fray!)
Swirling mist coils round your feet
Fall asleep, I'll meet you there (Burning the fray!)
Almost like a twisted dream

Nemesis starts at our hearts, again with his fights and righteous scorn
Mother is done, rebuking him, rage of paternal love divine
"Get out", she says, "leave her alone, you're heartless and vile, I want you out!"
After she's done, Jared is gone...flat-lined as if he saw it all

And now, after all
He sees his own son dead
And flees into hallways
As we're left with just a corpse

Fall asleep, I'll meet you there (Burning the fray!)
Slip your feet into the warm
Fall asleep, I'll meet you there (Burning the fray!)
Leave your mortal shell behind
