You, I demand your attention
A story would be told about a boy who's growing older now
Now's the time to dive inside your warped and tattered mind
The pieces do not fit the puzzle or your logic's path

And as I sit in the candlelight
A silhouette from behind

Failing gods
Into the shadows of my mind, mindful of the implications
Failing gods
Where was your god when brother died?
Failing gods
A cancer patient hopes he'll win
Failing gods
I'm by your side until the end

Punished by the hand of god for seizing fruit of knowledge
The metaphor made flesh, you'd carve me pound for pound

And as he rots in his death bed
I see his father with calloused eyes

There is no rhyme or reason
