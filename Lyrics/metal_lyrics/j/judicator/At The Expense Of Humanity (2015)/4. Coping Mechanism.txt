You say I'm angry, I can't deny that it's burning in my veins
But that's only the symptom
You say I'm searching, I tell you now...the things that I have seen could crush your fragile state of mind

I call it folklore

Wander the moonscape, let your spirit fly
Disguised as strength and yet I never question why
Wander the moonscape, a dreamworld farewell
Your id desires freedom, subterfuge by self

Born in my mind, a seed of misanthropic fear
I can't identify as one of you and yet I know 
It's not a phase, it's not a stretch...I'd love to rid myself this useless cage of human flesh

We call it folklore

Wander the hallways, let your spirit fly
Disguised as innocence, you never question why
Wander the hallways, a conscious farewell
Your id desires freedom, subterfuge by self

Wander the hospital, let your spirit fly
I am a lonely vessel, a candle in the night
Wander the hospital, subconscious farewell
Memories and time will fade, how long can broken ships sail?

Lies and lies from generations die
Yet I'm the only one who questions why we're here
