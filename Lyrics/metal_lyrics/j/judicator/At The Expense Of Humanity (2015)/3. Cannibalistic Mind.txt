Waste away for hours, slip away
The only way out of this cage
- you're wasting away - 
By the window watching autumn leaves
My only break from reality

He lies in his agony
He'll die, this I feel, but
But what's the purpose behind? 
He lies, shades of pink in the light
Implies terrible things will happen to all

Never had a normal life, I'm not the same
Severed ties to community
- your fears are legitimate - 
Meander through hallways day by day
Leave my mind to die by day

The mind, when unfed it
It feeds, so insatiable
It eats itself
The mind, so unnourished
It eats any idea it comes in contact with 

He lies to himself yet
He cries out for mercy, but still he keeps up his faith
He lies to the others, he cries when they ask him he's doing
I'm not
