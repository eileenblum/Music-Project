I walk alone at night, hoping that I'll find epiphany or more...a deeper understanding 

Always knew that I'd die alone, never thought that I'd find a home
Home, a different meaning, (for someone) who is solitary 
Always knew that I'd die alone, never thought that I'd find someone
Someone to be by my side, to help me find the fleeting light

Full moon shines
I'm swimming in my deepest fears
Clouded skies
I'm treading in the blackened waves
Never mind
Something is here

Crashing waves
Relentless in my throbbing ears
Flowing blood
A highway jam that's in my head
Pounding fear
Time to reveal

Feeling now that my brother's tale doesn't have a happy end
End to a broken line, this wretched soul/observer
Always knew I was special, I...I am taken back by...
By the surreal feelings here, almost like a dream world here

Glowing moon
It's almost like a lucid dream
Lurking doom
Or is it just a catalyst
Never mind
Time to go back

Gentle wind
I look up to his room alight
So exposed
I'm standing naked in the rain
Now return...to numbing death

Cancer burns families down
Rips cracks into canyon walls
Step by step up to his room
Lying there, mother beside

Fantasy is torn apart, reality is fucking stark
Stark in the face of tears, eyes that show our fears
Mom caresses his withered hands, hold on tight and pray aloud
Loud is the comfort of men, yet they're silent in their pride 

Indoor breeze
This surely cannot happen now
Earned your keys into another bleaker world
Blood and bone
You won't escape

Only smoke
Emergency to save his life
Without fire
No longer am I here alone
Earned your keys
Time to grow up
