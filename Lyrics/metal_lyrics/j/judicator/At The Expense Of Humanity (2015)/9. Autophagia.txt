"So it's clear, brother
Looking back I have regrets and 
Though I know I hurt you
Cast aside your mother and left you
Understand the pain that scarred my mind and twisted my heart
Please forgive my actions
Please allow me to die with dignity"

Wishing silently just to cry and curl up on the floor
Looking down at him, pale and sunken eyes, bony fingers and rib cage

Rage, rage in my heart, dying to kill, pull all the flesh from the bone
Sinew from bone, stabbing to death, all that's repressed and 
Rage, rage in my heart, dying to die, easy as one finger's pull
Pull the trigger, end it all now, nothing is worthwhile 

Day by day I see him fade
Day by day I want to follow him
Fading time, his mind is dulling like a blunted spear once proud
Kill the pain, benumb him
Dull his senses, just let him fade away
Sleep away to stop the pain
Pretty soon he'll fall asleep for good

Death is closer yet, no one knows when
Helplessly I go on
No one cares for you, no one dares love you
Leave your mind to itself

Rage, rage in my heart, dying to kill, pull all the flesh from the bone
Sinew from bone, stabbing to death, all that's repressed and 
Rage, rage in my heart, dying to die, easy as one finger's pull
Pull the trigger, end it all now, nothing is worthwhile 

Set me from from myself
I cannot take any more

Rage, rage in my heart, dying to kill, pulling off ears and your lips
Knife between ribs, slowing heartbeat, all that's repressed and
Rage, rage in my heart, dying to die, easy as one leap of faith
Come from nothing, end as nothing, nothing is worthwhile
