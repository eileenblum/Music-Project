Wrinkles on a young face, he went into the light
He saw the truth which meant a weight that no one can bear
No god, no higher meaning
I stress we are alone
But worry not my dear, for death will bring your sweet release

To be the wraith who wanders endlessly through space
When crowns are shattered, I will have faith
Until that day, my friends, I'll step off to the side
When crowns are shattered, I will come back to you

Set a fire, lock the door
We are together to burn forever
Feel the flames kiss your feet
Bound together to writhe forever more

Despite waves of sorrow, one must hold onto them
Through war and times of hunger, hold onto them
How curious is mankind, our capabilities to cheat and kill each other; kindness and charity

I am the guardian to the Prussian claim to life
When crowns are shattered, we'll be complete 
There is no line which separates yourself from me
When crowns are shattered, we will ascend

Thus we rose to guard all German states alike
When crowns are shattered, I will have faith
And so must all men be who wish to see a change
When crowns are shattered, there's no excuse
