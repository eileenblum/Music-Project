Life in this cage, it seems I am condemned to see right through the bars of freedom out beyond
That is the punishment, to see what you can't have
And learn obedience, to kneel as you still stand

Friedrich, dear
My love, be calm
You'll find your path in time before too long

I fear his hand
The shame carries on
A tyrant for a guide
Release is on my mind

No songs of birds, no warm embrace
Nothing more valuable than a friendly face
Only my sister and Hans von Katte 
There's no escape, make the best of what you have

You're wasting time, you worthless boy
My plans for you won't be destroyed

I fear his plans
Confined to fortress walls
The shame he puts on me
Release is on my mind

Friedrich, boy
All will be well
A chance of release from all this hell

Fight, flight, or die
I'll vanish into the night
No choice but to risk my life
My tyrant, my father and this strife
