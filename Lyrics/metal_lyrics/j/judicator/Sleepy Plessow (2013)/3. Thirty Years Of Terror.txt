Now the time to decide
Give us a choice between the hell and fire
We yield, unending strife
Catholic rage--and all for god

The Danes came into our city in peace
-There's no need for bloodshed
Then fire came from out of the western bank
-Provoked Danish fire

Chaos and bloodshed throughout the streets of Brandenburg 
Are filling with dead, the harsh cannon fire belches its horrid smoke

Pointless violence, shattered silence
Give all you have and still you'll die 
By my will we'll take what we need
Even daughters bound and gagged

Ears parted with heads
Splinters of wood in throats of old men
Burn houses and steal anything found in the rubble

Children stripped of their clothes and left to die of exposure
The common man pays a horrible price to feed other armies

Amazing, the cost of belief
And there's no relief
Imperial bloodlust
We have to reform, concentrate power
Thirty years of blood is far too much

Thirty years of terror
Thirty years of fear
And no one is safe here from Swedish or from Danes
Thirty years of hardship
The soldiers live off our land
We're just a fledgling nation
I dream of a better time

I feel enraged, there's no release
Constant pressure and agony
You want to rise? First learn to lie
You be the fox with a mask of a lion
Systems failing all around
You have no friends, you are alone
Leave me be, I can take no more
I'll set a fire and lock the door

Starlight born to a father of shame
The fox and the lion
Choose now the path which will be your guide
There's no room for mercy

Shamed and kicked in the mud, we look to the sun and dream of better times
Persistence, acceptance of loss is our creed..but never we forget
