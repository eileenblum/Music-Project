A dreary land with no real hope
Which seeks to rise from gray waters

Feel the light shine through the clouds of fear
Bring the fight, a clever fox with highest hopes

These are the prospects of our people
To free ourselves from constant shame

All eyes gaze upon the elector
-Who are you to judge me so?
A well meaning failure, "protector"
-Disregarded and mocked
All eyes gaze upon the elector
-I try my best to guide us through the fire
A poisoned and hesitant mindset
-I did my best for us all

Caught between the hammer and the anvil
Torn apart, my reputation's fate

These are the prospects of our people
To build a nation just as strong

All eyes gaze upon the elector
-The Swedish lion calls for war
A well meaning failure, "protector"
-No place for neutrality 
All eyes gaze upon the elector
-No right choice to make
A poisoned and hesitant mindset
-I'm damned no matter what I do

This poor lame man was doomed to hang
But not from rope, but from his own shame

These were my prospects and ambitions
I try so hard but always fail

All eyes gaze upon the elector
-Who are you to talk me down?
A well meaning failure, "protector"
-A lame and courageous man
All eyes gaze upon the elector
-Ich laufe nach Ducal Preussen 
Menschen koennen so gedankenlos 
-A hero who accepts unjust shame
