We have ascended to great renown
A kingdom that's respected by the seeds we've sewn
Fight wars for money and all the perks
This time it just so happens to be the French we fight

And then dark news came from the east
The Swedish armies from the north

No, no, no!
There's only one way out
That's to avenge myself upon the Swedes
Both noble and the plain, we'll kill them all
We'll purge this land of filth and bring them to the fall

This cruel betrayal, it feels the same as the thirty years of terror which left a vile stain
Never again will this come to pass
We fly for Brandenburg for vengeance now at last

They flew like specters in the night
With hearts so heavy for the dawn

No, no, no!
There's only one way out
The fox will go to war with wolves who have no doubt that we are weaker still, and stand but little chance
But now our hearts are made of fire and blood is on our minds

Silent in the rain, our passage through the night
We swept them from the stage
Brandenburg left vacant in their flight
Their expectations blocked by the marshlands not in sight

Silence at Fehrbellin 
Echoes of family long gone by 
Silence at Fehrbellin
Green fields shimmer with their blood

Despite an overwhelming tide
The rage of shame cast fear aside

Blood, blood, blood!
We have them on the run
I am the father, Friedrich Wilhelm 
The fleeing Swedes were butchered by peasants and by all
The memory of shame is sometimes quite unfair
