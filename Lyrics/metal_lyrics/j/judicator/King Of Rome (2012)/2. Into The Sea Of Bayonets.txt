Wellington is on the move (this time you may not succeed)
And I have been refused (count the cards, one joker missing)
â¨We try as in the old daysâ¨
Failure is something that you choose

â¨â¨I defy the world around me
I deny the chance is dying

â¨â¨Into the sea of bayonetsâ¨
Where I'm at home, where I belong
â¨Into the sea of bayonets
â¨I try to peacefully return

Prussians coming from the west (drive a wedge in between now)
â¨Keep the weak from growing strong (there's a chance, one chance in hell)â¨
They'll face the bravest of the brave
â¨Marshal Ney will turn the tideâ¨â¨

We hear the batteries are crashing down
â¨Push the skirmishers away and break for center

â¨(Into the dark) the second division
â¨(Into the bleak) slowing burn -- more for the slaughterâ¨â¨
And from the left Jerome is killing in the woods
â¨Before the crossroad's taken I will be the ligh
tâ¨A thunder louder than the mind can even take
â¨A shock which pierces deep into the shallow heart
