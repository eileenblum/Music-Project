See Sir Frederick Ponsonby, commander of the 12th Light Dragoons
And General Jacquinot reacts, the French can see we'll hold our own with smiles

Enter the fearsome lancersâ¨
Savage and terrifying, they pierce my flesh
â¨Wounded in both my arms and
â¨Out of control I plunge into the fray

â¨â¨Explore the limits of yourself
And ask yourself just how much can you takeâ¨
When one can take abuse with smilesâ¨
Then he in turn may lead his men as sonsâ¨â¨

When I open up my eyes and try to lift myself out of the mud
Hear, "Tu n'es pas mort, coquin?" and quickly followed by another blowâ¨â¨

I feel the steel inside me
The pain is overwhelming and blinding
â¨I taste the blood arisingâ¨
My lung is pierced and soon I slip away

â¨â¨I once again awaken
â¨So paralyzed, forsaken and alone
â¨I'm robbed in empty pocketsâ¨
A tirailleur will use me as a shieldâ¨â¨

Explore the limits of yourself
And ask yourself just how much can you takeâ¨
When one can take abuse with smiles
â¨Then he in turn may lead his men as sons
