I must inform you, the battle of Waterloo's begunâ¨
Into the old wood, an air of dirt and fear, it permeates
â¨We squeeze our rifles, it cannot be this easy, that we knowâ¨
A roar of cannons begins to tear apart our valiant ranksâ¨â¨

Bloodshed, fire, dying
â¨In woods of Hougoumontâ¨â¨

As water crashes on stoneâ¨
Dying to break them downâ¨
Like elders fight sands of timeâ¨
These walls are bought with blood

â¨â¨The ocean's swelling, it rises up against the northern wall
â¨Bring in "the Basher" to carve a path of gore and splintered wood
â¨If there was one chance, then seize it now for this is all we'll get
â¨Into the courtyard, screams of crowded bodies finally meetâ¨â¨

Bloodshed, fire, dying
â¨In woods of Hougoumontâ¨â¨

As water crashes on stoneâ¨
Dying to break them downâ¨
Like elders fight sands of timeâ¨
These walls are bought with blood
