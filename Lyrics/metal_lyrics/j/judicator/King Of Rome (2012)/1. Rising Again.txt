I deny your vile state, a leech unto our pride
We are the worthy host, the ones you hate the mostâ¨
Rise, I shall rise â never restrainedâ¨
Trust in yourself
Always behave sly and sharp, just like the fox
Embers of blue in sunset

Dying to be free, my destiny is held and barred
A bird thatâs caged and still imprisoned
I yearn to hold all that men need 

For now Iâm rising again, pride is in my eyes
And Europe fears what I am: the legend reborn

Grey, grey is the sky as we return
Join in the ranks of free men
Sly, sly and sharp, just like the fox
Now we shall see if friends remain

Soldiers listening, all waiting for my careful words
â¨If you would kill your Emperor
Then shoot him now, for here I am

I deny your knotted throne
â¨A leech unto our prideâ¨
We are the worthy hostâ¨
The ones you fear the mostâ¨

â¨Starlight in the fields, my power yields a flame of hope
I feel Iâm changing, the age is dawningâ¨Prometheus will pay for allâ¨
For now Iâm rising again, pride is in my eyes
And Europe fears what I am: the legend reborn
