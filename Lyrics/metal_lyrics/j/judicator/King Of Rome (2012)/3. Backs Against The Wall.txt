The rain, it falls like a curtainâ¨
Wolves are on our heelsâ¨
Desperate men feeling pressure, pressure to surviveâ¨

The train of men never ending, moving through the nightâ¨
Once before I have seen these lands, Waterloo is my ground

â¨â¨Look at their faces, what do you see?â¨
We must pull through for them, set the world freeâ¨â¨

Keep the pace and push through fireâ¨
Never yield the ground that's chosen
â¨Backs against the wall

The night is lit by their fires, the light of countless men
A silence reigned so profound till the downpour resumedâ¨
A present left for the morning by the fates in the night
Battle time slowly creeping, the night laughs at what it leavesâ¨

Dire moment of the century, not a moment's respite 
Two wolves chained and are waiting for their master's respiteâ¨
A wolf that's tired but collected, the other suffers but snarls
â¨When noon arrives we will ride them down
â¨Let's let slip the dogs of warâ¨

And now we stand on the corner between the fear and the rage 
It's almost time for the blood storm, pray to what god you choose
â¨The Grand Armee beats the war drum, blood is racing and Iâ¨
I can't believe this has come to pass, twenty years of war
