These are the gasping death throes now
â¨Into the final fight that I might knowâ¨

I feel a rush of blood like thunder in my veinsâ¨
The only fear that's left is left alive but maimedâ¨â¨

Rush them and fight to death
I hold my breath and pray for moreâ¨â¨

The sea of tears and tattered bannersâ¨
Just like a prophecy, a prophecy that failedâ¨
The sea of tears and tattered bannersâ¨
Our hearts cry out as one, and beat like drums of god
â¨Our elan

We all inhale the smoke and fogâ¨
My brisk and youthful self has long been goneâ¨

The song of musket fire is playing to our fearsâ¨
As silhouettes of men so suddenly appear

Pierced and shocked but I surviveâ¨
We're falling back now, like the ocean tide
â¨â¨Hearts of iron, squares of Old Guardâ¨
Fight like lions for the French retreatâ¨â¨
I will not be silenced, I will not be caged
â¨Take apart the man who built this stage 

â¨â¨Ils ne passeront pas, we shall never yield
â¨Despite the loss on the battlefieldâ¨
Je ne cedrais jemais, they shall never passâ¨
Protect the fall-back, we must make it lastâ¨
General Cambronne is captured nowâ¨
Repel their advance, show the English howâ¨
True men fight till collapse, defend their kinâ¨
The French are falling, hear the wounded cry

â¨â¨Back to home at Malmaison, 
back to the calm before my storm
â¨Fantasize of life anew, dream of life across the sea
There must be something for me there, 
science and exploration callâ¨
Could I be slightly out of mind?â¨
Surely Prometheus can't fly

â¨â¨Into my final resting place, call me general to push disgraceâ¨â¨

When springtime falls back into winterâ¨
Just like a prophecy, a prophecy that failedâ¨
Will auburn sunsets weep for me?
â¨I steel my heart and sigh, then walk into the blackâ¨
My elan
