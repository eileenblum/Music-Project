All that I've left behindâ¨
All that I've sacrificedâ¨
Never I'll fight againâ¨
Blood is too high a priceâ¨â¨

One night before, every chair in here was filledâ¨
Empty inside, staring at vacant thrones of my kin

â¨â¨Pride undoneâ¨
Battles lost, 
wars we wonâ¨
Count the cost 

Reading the list of slain, weeping in deepening dismayâ¨
There is still loss in gain, do not congratulate 

Now that we've spoken, now that we've won
Pray it's all over, peace has begunâ¨â¨

And now it's time to cast him out
The toll of our dead is on himâ¨
And in this world of gears and decayâ¨
Nobody is innocent anyway
