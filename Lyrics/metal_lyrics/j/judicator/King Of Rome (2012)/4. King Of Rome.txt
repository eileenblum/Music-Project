On the field I can see him riding inspiredâ¨
All those legends that we have heard in our youthâ¨
Now it's time to stand, measure ourselves against him

â¨â¨Back to the French lines, "Vive l'Empereur!" 
It's my desire to defend the name â¨Back to the fire, "Vive l'Empereur!" 
What I require was refused again

â¨â¨But as my thoughts return to home and what's ahead â¨
I was a slave to what my family forged 
Thoughts of my son, I will not fail him now

â¨â¨I'll pass the light, give him all the might â¨
He'll be the King of Rome
â¨I'll pass the light safely through the nightâ¨
He'll be the King of Rome

â¨â¨From the battlefield, I ride to my place of commandâ¨â¨
There at the hilltop (thinking of your son)â¨
The heir-apparent, your time will come
â¨There in my shadows (no hope you can see)
â¨I'll fight despite them, too much is at stakeâ¨â¨

But as my thoughts return to home and what's ahead â¨
I was a slave to what my family forged 
Thoughts of my son, I will not fail him now

â¨â¨I'll pass the light, give him all the might 
â¨He'll be the King of Rome
â¨I'll pass the light safely through the night
â¨He'll be the King of Rome
