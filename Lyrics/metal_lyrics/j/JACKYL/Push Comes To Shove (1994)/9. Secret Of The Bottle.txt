I feel better when I'm drinking, it just seems to ease my mind
And all my worries and troubles, they just seem to fade behind

[Chorus:]
Oh the secret of the bottle it may never be known
So I'll raise my glass and propose a toast and this one baby is for you

I start to laugh when I'm drinking, I may tell a joke or two
Sometimes I'll even pretend that I'm still in love with you

[Chorus]

And you ask me if I've felt pain
After all that I've been through
I've paid more than just my dues
I felt the pain of you

I feel the pain when I'm drinking, it just don't seem to cut as deep
And when I lay down without you it makes it easy to go to sleep

[Chorus]
