Trailer park trash
That's what I am
You don't like my ways
I don't give a damn
And I feel no need to change my stride
When you ain't got nothing there's nothing to hide

And no!
I don't have nothing better to do
And yea!
I've walked through better men than you
So before you try to change my ways
All the junk can go, but this yard dog stays

[Chorus:]
Back down in the dirt
Back down in the dirt
Where I'm supposed to be
And it's getting good to me
Back down in the dirt
Back down in the dirt
Where I'm supposed to be
And it's getting to me

Never get a leg up
Keep my feet on the ground
If you're looking for trouble
Then it's trouble you've found
Don't take no schooling to educate me
I'm all the man that I need to be

Yea!
It's easy to see where I stand
I got my bird in the hand
So make sure that you're ready to clash
Don't you write a check that your ass can't cash

[Chorus]
