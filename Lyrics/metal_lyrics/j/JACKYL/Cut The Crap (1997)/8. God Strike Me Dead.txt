As I sit here grinning like a mule eating briars
It occurs to me that I lost something that was a part of me
And it fills this empty house with a feeling
A feeling of even greater emptiness

[Chorus:]
God strike me dead if I'm never gonna see
My soul come together again
My lifeline's stretched and now it's thin
Please God strike me dead if I'm never gonna see
My soul come together again

And it's getting purt' near the point
Of feeling pretty numb as I start to think
Of all the things that I wish
That I could change and then some
And the numbness turns into pain
And underneath there shows a stain
I try me best to try to hide the things
That eat me up inside

[Chorus:]
God strike me dead if I'm never gonna see
My soul come together again
My lifeline's stretched and now it's thin
Please God strike me dead if I'm never gonna see
My soul come together again

[Bridge:]
And I know more every day
Just exactly how it came to be this way
One more chance I'd steal it
One chance to do it again, again

[Chorus:]
God strike me dead if I'm never gonna see
My soul come together again
My lifeline's stretched and now it's thin
Please God strike me dead if I'm never gonna see
My soul come together again
God strike me dead, God strike me dead
God strike me dead
