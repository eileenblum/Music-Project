There's a place inside my soul
There's a place that's not quite whole
And it seems it's here to stay
It grows a little everyday
And it's getting bigger
It's getting bigger
It's getting bigger

[Chorus:]
But let's don't go there
Let's don't go, you can't compete
Let's don't go, you lose your bet
Let's don't go, it makes you wet
And I know nobody wants to know from rain

There's a place inside my head
There's a place I go instead
And I feel the need to be
There anyway, the feeling
Grows everyday and it's getting bigger
It's getting bigger
It's getting bigger

[Chorus:]
But let's don't go there
Let's don't go, you can't compete
Let's don't go, you lose your bet
Let's don't go, it makes you wet
And I know nobody wants to know from rain
