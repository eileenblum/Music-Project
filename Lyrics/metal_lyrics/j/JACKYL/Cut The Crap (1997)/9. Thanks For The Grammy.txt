I'm never speechless
Know what I want to say
About what it took for me to get here
Where I am today
I'm not ashamed to say

[Chorus:]
Thanks for the Grammy
Who'd a thought a country boy like me
I'll cherish it forever
Garnish with tar and feather
You'll see what it means to me

I wanna thank big daddy know-it-all
Looks like he done me right
Got me records on the shelf
In the Wal-Mart, you know
They're open all night
They sell my records and my guns
I think that's out of sight

[Chorus:]
Thanks for the Grammy
Who'd a thought a country boy like me
I'll cherish it forever
Garnish with tar and feather
You'll see what it means to me

If I'm dreaming just let me be
Until I see the hypocrite faces
As they congratulate me
I don't hold a grudge
They know not what they do
They just chase the trends
Set by me and you
So I may not have won a thing
But I got peace of mind
And I'll just sing my songs
To the people who wanna
Have a good time
Have a gram on me one time

[Chorus:]
Thanks for the Grammy
Who'd a thought a country boy like me
I'll cherish it forever
Garnish with tar and feather
You'll see what it means to me
