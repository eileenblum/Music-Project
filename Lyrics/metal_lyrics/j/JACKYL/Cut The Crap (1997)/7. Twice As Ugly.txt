When you vultures finish picking skin off my face
Replace your hand that's on my back
Stab your verdict in its place
I can't fight the feeling
Gotta say what's on my mind
Why have you forsaken me, forsaken me, forsaken me
Don't forget just where you come from
Where you used to be
It all comes around
It all comes around
It all comes around

[Chorus:]
Here I am, back again
Bigger than life
To wear you thin
Twice as ugly, twice as loud
Twice as cocky, twice as proud
Here I am, back again
Bigger than life
Just watch me grin
Twice as ugly, twice as ugly
I'm back again

I offer no apologies
For things that I have done
I'll fuck and drink and smoke and cuss
Damned to have my fun
You can't fight the feeling
Gotta say what's on your mind
Why have you awakened me, awakened me, awakened me
I know you got it in you
To fuck and drink and smoke and cuss
Don't you hate it
You're just like us
Yeah, you're just like us

[Chorus:]
Here I am, back again
Bigger than life
To wear you thin
Twice as ugly, twice as loud
Twice as cocky, twice as proud
Here I am, back again
Bigger than life
Just watch me grin
Twice as ugly, twice as ugly
I'm back again

Here I am, back again
Bigger than life
To wear you thin
Twice as ugly, twice as loud
Twice as cocky, twice as proud
Here I am, back again
Bigger than life
Just watch me grin
Twice as ugly, twice as ugly
I'm back again
