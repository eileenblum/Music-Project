I'm sitting stoned all alone in a room full of friends
'Cause it lifts the world off me
Black light shining on Jimmy's face
It'll never let him be free
Oh, oh, ashes fall from the spleefs I roll
Oh, oh, burning holes in my crushed velvet soul
Oh, all I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
Is to open up and let the outside in
Open up and let it begin
Open up and let it come together
Open up and let it in
A Dodge Dart pull through the drive-through
Of the hell hole I'm standing in
Welcome to the crown of thorns, Chris Kringel
Never been my friend
Oh, oh, wishes fall from my tongue like drool
Oh, oh, the ground floor of life is cruel
Oh, oh, all I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
Come together
I see it now, I'm gonna get it
I see it, I'm gonna let it, let it, let it, let it begin
Let it begin, let it begin
Open up, open up
Open up and let the outside in
Open up and let it begin
Open up and let it come together
Open up and let it in
Open up and let the oustside in
Open up and let it begin
Open up and let it come together
Open up and let it in
Oh yeah
