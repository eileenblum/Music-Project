I'm just a dumbass country boy
I think people wanna rock but what do I know
I remember the days when men were men
If it was up to me I'd bring 'em back again
And I'd kick your candy asses up around your jaded ears

[Chorus:]
I'm just a dumbass country boy
I think people wanna rock but what do I know
I got friends with names like Slim &amp; Coy
Just a dumbass country boy
I'm just a dumbass country boy

I punch the clock for 40 'cause it's all I know
Remember the days of jammin' drugs and love
And it was cool to say yes to all the above
And I still can't find nothing wrong
With saying yes to smoking mother nature

[Chorus:]
I'm just a dumbass country boy
I think people wanna rock
But what do I know
Got friends with names like Slim &amp; Coy

Now people listen to me
I'm your social conscience
I been gone for a while
You've had to make it on your own
Now people listen to me
You got no social conscience
You gotta get up, get up &amp; get over it
That's right, I just wanna change the world
Change the world's diapers
All those tender ass sons o' bitches
Who are all these goobers who say
What's cool &amp; what's not cool
What's hip &amp; not hip
Call me a one hit wonder
Well I might be a one hit wonder
But then again it might only take me one hit
To knock your teeth down your God damn throat
It's time for me to drive this Impala
You need to be programmed
I'll program your ass
Listen to me M.F.

[Chorus:]
I'm just a dumbass country boy
I think people wanna rock
But what do I know
Got friends with names like Slim &amp; Coy
I'm just a dumbass country boy

I think people wanna rock
But what do I know
Got friends with names like Slim &amp; Coy
It's the simple things that I enjoy
With my friends that are named Slim &amp; Coy
What do I know
What do you know
What does anybody fucking know
