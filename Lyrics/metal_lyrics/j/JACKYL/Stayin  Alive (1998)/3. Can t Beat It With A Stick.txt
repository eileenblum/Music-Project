Riding down the road in a nickel black Cadillac
Reckon tomorrow I don't want my money back
If I roll then I roll
Yeah I roll down the road
I rolled this far
Don't need no high sale
No no no!

[Chorus:]
Can't beat it with a stick
Bulletproof, three feet thick
When you got it down keep beating it
Can't beat it
Can't beat it
And if you can then you beat it like this

I had a dream
Woke up in a cold cold sweat
It was one of those dreams though
That you know you'll never forget
Well there was one, no two, no three, no four
Women in the kitchen whipping me up some food
Four women dressed to the hilt
Dressed like prostitutes

[Chorus]
