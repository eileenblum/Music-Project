You want the truth!
You want the truth!
In my hands I hold a problem
It has a will
It has a mind of it's own
I got a problem (problem)
As it stands
I got a problem (problem)
In my hands

You want the truth!
You want the truth!
In my hands I hold the key to love
Out of my hands it's gonna come to me
It's on its own
I got a problem (problem)
As it stands
I got a problem (problem)
In my hands

And it the morning you just told the son
That is the way that things are done
I'll take myself into my own confidence
It won't take long in my hands

You want the truth!
You want the truth!
Out of my hands it's gonna come to me
It's on its own
I got a problem (problem)
As it stands
I got a problem (problem)
In my hands
I got a problem (problem)
As it stands
I got a problem (problem)
In my hands
In my hands
