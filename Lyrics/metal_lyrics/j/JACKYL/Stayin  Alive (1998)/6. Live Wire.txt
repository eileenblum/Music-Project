Well if you're lookin' for trouble
I'm the man to see
If you're lookin' for satisfaction
I'm satisfaction guaranteed
I'm as cool as a body on ice
Or hotter than a rollin' dice
Send you to heaven
Take you to hell
I ain't foolin'
Can't you tell

I'm a live wire
I'm a live wire
I'm a live wire
Gonna set this town on fire

Well if you need some lovin'
And if you need some man
You've got the phone and the number
And I got no future plans
Oh come on honey you got nothin' to lose
You got the thirst 'n I got the booze
Give you an inch
Take you a mile
I wanna make you smile

I'm a live wire
Live Wire!
I'm a live wire
Live wire!
I'm a live wire
Live wire!
Holy smoke and sweet desire

Like a hot rod baby?
Oh stick this in your fuse box

Cooler than a body on ice
Hotter than a rollin' dice
Wilder than a drunken fight
You're gonna burn tonight

I'm a live wire
Live wire!
I'm a live wire
Live wire!
I'm a live wire
Live wire!
And I'm gonna set this town on fire

Live wire
Live wire!
I'm a live wire
Live wire!
Well I'm a live wire
Live wire!
I'm a live wire
Live wire!
I'm gonna burn, found me guilty
Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
