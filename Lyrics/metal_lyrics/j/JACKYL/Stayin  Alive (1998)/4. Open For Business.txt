AJ drives to his general store
And for the millionth time he unlocks the door
His wife's not around, she's been dead for years
When I was a kid they used to sell me beers
Why he even bothers to open the door
The store's completely empty from ceiling to floor

Everyday open for business
Lay your hand cause the dealing's done
Life goes on and on day after day
Just like AJ, got to find you a way
To open for business

The cracks in the wall is like the lines in his face
They run deep in to show that you can never replace
All the years go by and the place that he's found
They say the shit is coming through
He said build it up around
Wonder how he managed to stay
In an old empty building
He makes it OK

Everyday open for business
Lay your hand cause the dealing's done
Life goes on and on day after day
Just like AJ, got to find you a way
To open for business

Everyday open for business
Life goes on and on and on and on

He drives his '38 Ford to the general store
And for the millionth time he unlocks the door
The gas pumps are gone from where they were before
Is this good or bad?
He's gonna do a little more

Everyday open for business
Lay your hand cause the dealing's done
Life goes on and on day after day
Just like AJ, got to find you a way to

Everyday open for business
Lay your hand cause the dealing's done
Life goes on and on and on and on
Just like AJ, got to find you a way to

Everyday open for business
Everyday open for business
