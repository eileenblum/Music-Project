The sun shines through my window today
Occurred to me the sun could go away

[Chorus]
I can't believe it, my world is tall and faster
I can't conceive it, the calm before disaster
Raining down on me
And I'm slipping deeper, deeper in darkness

Never to return, I know it's true
And I'm slipping deeper, deeper in darkness
But before I go I'll slip my disease into you
I feel the pain of having to sit next to yourself
Yesterdays tomorrow really makes me mad

[Chorus]

Never to return, I know it's true
And I'm slipping deeper, deeper in darkness
But before I go I'll slip my disease into you
Feeling down, going out of control
I can feel the life draining from my very soul
You got your hands around my neck
You're pulling me down
And you're pulling me down
Is this for real or is it a dream
Hello moviegoers, is there no shame?

[Chorus]

Never to return, I know it's true
And I'm slipping deeper, deeper in darkness
But before I go I'll slip my disease into you
Into you
Into you
Into you
Into you
