Huh, huh, huh, huh
Motherfucker say, huh, huh, huh, huh
Motherfucker say, huh, huh, huh, huh
Motherfucker say, huh, huh, huh, huh
Yeah

Well listen to the music and open up your ears
It's breaking down these walls that we built up all these years
With time there comes a freedom to open up your mind
If you can't see what's going on then man, we must be blind

United we became
Look around, it ain't the same
We won't allow your penetration
We're the music generation

Sometimes I find myself acting just like a Negro
You know the brothers are the ones that started rock and roll, yeah
The music ties it all together, here we are (here we go) here we go
(Out the door) out the door, check it out

Now deep inside my soul, well I searched and found the groove
Now bonded by the backbeat, we are the ones to prove
United we are funky and it's a funky nasty scene
All colors run together, washed here in this machine

United we became
Look around, it ain't the same
We won't allow your penetration
'Cause we're the music generation

Sometimes I find myself acting just like a Negro
You know the brothers are the ones that started rock and roll, yeah
The music ties it all together, here we are (here we go) here we go
(Out the door) out the door, check it out

Huh, huh, huh, huh
Motherfucker, huh, huh, huh, huh

Well all color, they run together
Washed in here this machine, yeah

Sometimes I find myself acting (just like a Negro)
Sometimes I find myself acting just like a Negro
You know the brothers are the ones that started rock and roll, yeah
The music ties it all together, here we are (here we go) here we go
(Out the door) out the door, out the door, yeah
Sometimes I find myself acting just like a Negro
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The music ties it all together, here we are (here we go) here we go
(Out the door) out the door, out the door, out the door

Say, huh, huh, huh, huh
Motherfucker say, huh, huh, huh, huh
Everybody say, huh, huh, huh, huh
Motherfucker say, huh, huh, huh, huh
Mother
