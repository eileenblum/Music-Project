This is a song of great political and social import
It goes like this

Oh lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?
My friends all drive Porsche's, I must make amends
I work hard all my life time with no help from my friends
Oh lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?

Oh lord, won't you buy me a color TV?
Dialing for dollars is trying to find me
I wait for delivery each day until three
Oh lord, won't you buy me a color TV?

Oh lord, won't you buy me a night on the town?
I'm counting on you lord, please don't let me down
Prove that you love me and buy the next round
Oh lord, won't you buy me a night on the town?

Everybody, oh lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?
My friends all drive Porsche's, I must make amends
I work hard all my life time with no help from my friends
Oh lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?
