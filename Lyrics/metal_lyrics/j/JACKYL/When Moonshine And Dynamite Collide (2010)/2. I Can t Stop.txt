Bring on the night and light my fuse like a stick of dynamite
Call out the girls, break out the booze to the devil's delight
You just found your remedy and it's a down and dirty
Screaming it out like a banshee, giving it up to the dirty, dirty

Give me more
Give me more
No, I can't stop

I came to raise hell
I came to free myself
I crank it to eleven
I can't stop

Wherever there is sin
That's where the night begins
I came to raise hell
I can't stop

Stick your nose in the rock n roll, touch me down baby, touch me down
Bend it over and take control, touch me down baby, touch me down
Pick up your pumps and walk with me to the down and dirty
'Cause you just found your remedy, givin' it up to the dirty, dirty

Give me more
M-m-m-m-m-more
No, I can't stop

I came to raise hell
I came to free myself
I crank it to eleven
I can't stop

Wherever there is sin
That's where the night begins
I came to raise hell
I can't stop

I can't stop
Down and dirty
Give it up

Givin' it up to the dirty, dirty
Givin' it up to the dirty, dirty
Givin' it up to the dirty, dirty
Givin' it up, givin' it up, givin' it up

I came to raise hell
I came to free myself
I crank it to eleven
I can't stop

Wherever there is sin
That's where the night begins
I came to raise hell
I can't stop

I came to raise hell
I can't stop
I came to raise hell
I can't stop

Wherever there is sin
That's where the night begins
I came to raise hell
I can't stop
I can't stop
