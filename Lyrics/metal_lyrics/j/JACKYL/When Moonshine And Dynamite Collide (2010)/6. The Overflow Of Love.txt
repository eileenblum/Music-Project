On and on and on and on we go
I got my hands on some hot mamas right after the show
We stroll on to the avenue, it's just a short, short walk
And when it's time to rock, I can't talk the talk and walk the walk

Let's rock (overflow of love) the two on one connection
Bringing to the night, the things that you been dreaming of
(Overflow of love) the two on one connection
Juices start to flow, bringing on the overflow of love

Well in the summertime, it's hot sticky sweet and it's right
Like a thief in the dark, a machine that goes bump in the night
I put my foot on the floor, but with two you can't stop on a dime
'Cause when the odds are against you, you don't know when it's quitting time

It's the (overflow of love) the two on one connection
Bringing to the night, the things that you been dreaming of
(Overflow of love) the two on one connection
Juices start to flow, bringing on the overflow of love

Bring it on down
Yeah

Yeah

It's the (overflow of love) the two on one connection
Bringing to the night, the things that you been dreaming of
(Overflow of love) the two on one connection
Juices start to flow, bringing on the overflow of love
(Overflow of love) the two on one connection
Bringing to the night, the things that you been dreaming of
(Overflow of love) the two on one connection
Juices start to flow, bringing on the overflow of love

Yeah
