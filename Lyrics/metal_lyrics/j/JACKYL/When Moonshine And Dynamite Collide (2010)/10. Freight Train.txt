Jump aboard if you're ready to rock
Got your ticket, all hell's busting loose inside
All aboard is primed and ready to roll
All aboard is crunk, they're chugging, chugging, chugging, chugging

Let's go crazy
Let's jump the track
Keep pumping, keep pumping

Pump like a freight train
Can't stop a freight train
Jump on a freight train
Pump like a freight train

Whistle blows and the smoke stack's smoking
Fired up, heavy token, all aboard can hang
Hit one stop, two stop, three stop more
Hit all aboard 'cause I'm a one man gang bang

Let's go crazy
Let's rip the night
Like an out of control locomotive

Pump like a freight train
Can't stop a freight train
Jump on a freight train
Pump like a freight train

Keep pumping like a diesel (hey)
Keep pumping, keep pumping
Keep pumping right on time (hey)
Keep pumping, keep pumping

Pump like a freight train
Can't stop a freight train
Jump on a freight train
Pump like a freight train
(Can't stop a freight train) keep pumpin'
(Can't stop a freight train) keep pumpin'
(Can't stop a freight train) keep pumpin'
(Can't stop a freight train)

Keep pumpin'
I'm a-pumpin'
Like a locomotive
