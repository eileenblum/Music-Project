Hey ya'll (what?)
Wanna hear a story? (Yeah)
Hey ya'll (what?)

Right about now I think you all should know
That in the back woods in Georgia on the side of a hill
I fired up my great grand daddy's old still
'Cause I partied New York, I partied L.A.
God bless Dixie is what I'm here to say

'Cause my moonshine kicks your cocaine's ass
My moonshine kicks your cocaine's ass
All the people down in Dixie say
My moonshine kicks your cocaine's ass
My moonshine here, c'mon, c'mon
My moonshine kicks your cocaine's ass
Get on or get the hell out of the way
My moonshine kicks your cocaine's ass
My moonshine kicks your cocaine's ass

I say he ya'll (what?)
Wanna hear a story? (Yeah)
Hey ya'll (what?)

Right about now I think you all should know
That in the back woods of Georgia sitting on my knee
A little daisy duke and she was digging on me
I broke her down like a shotgun and having some fun
And I was grinning like a mule, I was getting it done

'Cause my moonshine kicks your cocaine's ass
My moonshine kicks your cocaine's ass
All the people down in Dixie say
My moonshine kicks your cocaine's ass
My moonshine here, c'mon, c'mon
My moonshine kicks your cocaine's ass
Get on or get the hell out of the way
My moonshine kicks your cocaine's...
My moonshine kicks your cocaine's...
My moonshine kicks your cocaine's...
My moonshine kicks your cocaine's...

Hey ya'll (what?)
Spread the word, spread it all around
Hey ya'll (what?)
My moonshine, c'mon

My moonshine kicks your cocaine's ass
Now the people down in Dixie say
My moonshine kicks your cocaine's ass
My moonshine is here, c'mon, c'mon
My moonshine kicks your cocaine's ass
Get on and get the hell out of the way
My moonshine kicks your cocaine's ass
My moonshine here, c'mon, c'mon
My moonshine kicks your cocaine's ass
All the people down in Dixie say
My moonshine kicks your cocaine's ass
My moonshine kicks your cocaine's ass
All the people down in Dixie say
My moonshine kicks your cocaine's ass

My moonshine kicks your cocaine's ass
