Roll one for the road and let's roll it out
Nothing, but open road up ahead, it's what it's all about
Lord knows I've done my share of good, lord knows I've sinned
Kick 'em if you got 'em, let's put it in the wind

If I die tonight, go find love
If I die tonight then I leave you this song
And you can sing this song when you find love
Gonna light up the sky tonight
When moonshine and dynamite collide

Sweet angels lose to the demons inside my head
May I be forty days in heaven before the devil knows IÃÂ¢??m dead
'Cause when you're gone, you're gone, take it all, leave nothing behind
Let's crank some AC/DC and throw down till we're blind

If I die tonight, go find love
If I die tonight then I leave you this song
And you can sing this song when you find love
Gonna light up the sky tonight
When moonshine and dynamite collide

Oh, leave you this song
Go find love
Go find love
I'll leave you this song, yeah

I've been ridiculed for being me
I never let it bother me and if I did I wouldn't let you see
Never wasted one second of time trying to prove them wrong
'Cause all that matters is tonight, turn up the lights, everybody sing along

If I die tonight, go find love
If I die tonight then I leave you this song
And you can sing this song when you find love
Gonna light up the sky tonight, yeah, yeah
If I die tonight, go find love
If I die tonight then I leave you this song
And you can sing this song when you find love
Gonna light up the sky tonight, yeah
When moonshine and dynamite collide
