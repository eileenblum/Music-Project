Step back, look at me
A happy man you will see
I got a lady, a lady who knows
Kickin' eleven and it shows, she's my baby

Having loads and loads of fun
Loads and loads of fun
Having loads and loads of fun
Loads and loads of fun

And you know that she means it
She does everything she can
Well, I'm so glad she's my lady
And I'm so glad I'm a man, she's my baby

Loads and loads of fun
Loads and loads of fun
Having loads and loads of fun
Loads and loads of fun

She don't have to ask me twice to stay
She can take it, take it all away
Only she can make me feel this way, whoa, yeah

And you know that she means it
She does everything she can
I'm so glad she's my lady
I'm so glad I'm a man, she's my baby

Loads and loads of fun
Loads and loads of fun
Having loads and loads of fun
Loads and loads of fun, yeah

Having loads and loads of fun
Loads and loads of fun
Loads and loads of fun
Having loads and loads and loads and loads of fun, yeah, yeah, yeah
Loads and loads of fun
Loads and loads of fun (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
