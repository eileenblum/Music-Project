Shake it, shake it, shiny go-go boots and lots of hiney shaking
Shake it, shake it, shiny go-go boots and lots of hiney shaking
Shake it now, she like to shake it, shake it, back it up, she back it up
It's looking like she's gonna break it
Hey now, she such a flirty, flirty
Step into the ring, it's time to get down to the dirty, dirty
Somehow, she makes the rules she's breakin'
Shake it, shake it, shiny go-go boots and lots of hiney shaking

She's not a drug, but if she was she'd be better than cocaine
Tall drink of crazy on the rocks with a little twist of insane
She likes to go-go, rev it up and go-go
Double time in the fast lane
She's not a drug, but if she was she'd be better than cocaine

I see you peeking 'round the corner, I should turn the lights on
See you peeking 'round that corner, I see you've turned your brights on
Sneaking 'round the corner, it's where you stash your honey
What you doing 'round the corner? Now what you gonna get up on?
Turn key all be it wrong you must admit
Twist up it once more, then she long gone, lickity split

She's not a drug, but if she was she'd be better than cocaine
Tall drink of crazy on the rocks with a little twist of insane
Oh, she likes to go-go, rev it up and go-go
Double time in the fast lane
She's not a drug, but if she was she'd be better than cocaine

Shake it
Shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Shake it, shake it, shiny go-go boots and lots of hiney shaking
Shake it, shake it, shiny go-go boots and lots of hiney shaking

Puh-pow

She's not a drug, but if she was she'd be better than cocaine
Tall drink of crazy on the rocks with a little twist of insane
Oh, she likes to go-go, rev it up and go-go
Double time in the fast lane
She's not a drug, no
She's not a drug, no
But if she was she'd be better than cocaine
Tall drink of crazy on the rocks with a little twist of insane
Oh, she likes to go-go, rev it up and go-go
Double time in the fast lane
She's not a drug, but if she was she'd be better than cocaine
