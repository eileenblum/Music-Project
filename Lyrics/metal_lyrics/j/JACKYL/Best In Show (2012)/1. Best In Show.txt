Boast bad ass beat it down the mill
Got a wondered nine holding just a little bit
Times go by and the road is always dreaming the hell
No, I won't look down, very easy
Dig a... good hoe just to teach me
I'm going and slide is always screaming what the hell...

And the last man standing say she will be cause it's all that you know
Is the beer of the... approach and take that... you home
And the dead man walking there's only one place he's gotta go
While the last man standing won't be ground the best in show

Oh hell rock it feels my body
Got a trouble and a... water
Wanna power up
Who wanna blow your mind

Smack that ass took the horse on other stable
Blow the... to the wind 'cause his horse is...
... you're gonna stand...

And the last man standing say she will be cause it's all that you know
Is the beer of the... approach and take that... you home
And the dead man walking there's only one place he's gotta go
While the last man standing will be pound the best in show

There's is no... use the sign once you step inside
There is no... beat the count into his... about
They... last drop into his ground
Speed of that... and mama... is done
Oh yeah
Almost walk is done
Mama raise too... mama's is walk is done,
Mama's walk is doen

73 hundred day are smacking that horse on the ice
Got that turbo attitude slappin in subways with... yeah

... on tomorrow gonna make my own
I never... for the ones I never want up anything to

And the last man standing say she will be cause it's all that you know
Is the beer of the... approach and take that... you home
And the dead man walking there's only one place he's gotta go
While the last man standing won't be ground the best in show
