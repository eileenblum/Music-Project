All the things I see in you
All the things I know that are true
And when the light in the morning
Comes shining through

I see, I see

[CHORUS:]
I see the sun shining
Down on me
I feel the heat of love's flame
Down on me
I love the thought of you comin'
Down on me
And I'm so wet from love raining
Down on me
Down on me, down on me

All the things you mean to me
All the things I want us to be
And when the man in the moon
Looks straight at you

I see, oh I see

[CHORUS]

ANd you're a new kinda way
That's getting stranger every day
Get on the good foo and keep it on top
One thing for certain, it ain't ever gonna stop

[CHORUS]
