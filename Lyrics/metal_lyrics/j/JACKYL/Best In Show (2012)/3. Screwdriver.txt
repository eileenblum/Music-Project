Let me tell you once a story about this ladies nice caboose
When she builds a head a steam she be bustin' something loose
I need a screw driver
I want a screw driver
When she walks into the room
Feel the ground begin to shake
Forget about the richter scale
Get ready for the quake
I need a screw driver
I got a screw driver
I wanna screw driver take me home step on the gas
I wanna screw driver ah she drives it hard ain't afraid to pass
I wanna screw driver what can I do
I wanna screw driver what can I do to do it for you
I got a screw driver
The temperature is rising
Feeling it getting hot
She's turning up the heat
Giving it all she's got
I need a screw driver
I want a screw driver
She's built for pleasure and for speed
With no apologies
I think there's something loose
Screw driver please
I need a screw driver
I want a screw driver
I wanna screw driver take me home step on the gas
I wanna screw driver ah she drives it hard ain't afraid to pass
I wanna screw driver what can I do
I wanna screw driver what can I do to do it for you
I got a screw driver
