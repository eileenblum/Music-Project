Wheels low, Chicago slow
In trouble deep but I can't let go
We set it up, to burn it down
Now you got me running round
Say it's you but the eyes don't lie
Now you keeping me up at night
Looking for a light at the end of your tunnel
Reaching through the madness that pulls you in
Down on my knees till you make me struggle
Crazy I know, but you're my favorite sin, ah
Yeah all nights, at the sights
Gonna strike me the time is light
Seem surrender, what is your will
I'm on the hype till I make my thrill
Say it's you but the eyes don't lie
Now you keeping me up at night
Looking for a light at the end of your tunnel
Reaching through the madness that pulls you in
Down on my knees till you make me struggle
Crazy I know, but you're my favorite sin, ah

Then it's all coming down to a hell
Where I get you alone, oh I be wrong, d-d-d-die!
Get twisted and ride around me

Looking for a light at the end of your tunnel
Reaching through the madness that pulls you in
Down on my knees till you make me struggle
Crazy I know,
Looking for a light at the end of your tunnel
Reaching through the madness that pulls you in
Down on my knees till you make me struggle
Crazy I know, but you're my favorite sin.
