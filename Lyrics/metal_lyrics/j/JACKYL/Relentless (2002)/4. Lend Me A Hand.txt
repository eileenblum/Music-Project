Somebody just tell me how the time gets away
And where's all the things that I held so tight in my
hands just like yesterday
I look around and everything has changed
But when I look real hard it's all the same
I get the feeling that it all just stays the same
Still I feel that there's everything to reclaim

[Chorus:]
If you could say my soul then save my ass
Cause I'm losin' ground and I'm goin' down fast
If you can save my soul, lend me your hand
Lend me your hand

She hates to take the blame for her deeds
She loves it when she bleeds
Cause it reminds her that she's not the only one
It makes it easy to forget what she has done
All the while the pain is growing inside
She's crying out somebody lend me a hand

[Chorus (x2)]

Is anybody out there
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me
Can you hear me now
Is anybody out there
Can you hear me now
Can you lend me your hand
Yeah Yeah

[Chorus]
