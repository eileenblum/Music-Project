Well I've been down this road so many times before
You know it never seems to pay
Every town just another town
Just as every night turns into day
And the miles and miles they take their toll
And add up to the lines on my face
I'd sell my sole right here and now if I could only only win this race

[Chorus:]
I've been down this road before
I think I can take a little more
Just load it in and set it up
And I'll throw down one more time

I've been down this road
So many times before but as for now I feel no pain
I cross the fine between pleasure
I tipped the genius to insane

[Chorus]
