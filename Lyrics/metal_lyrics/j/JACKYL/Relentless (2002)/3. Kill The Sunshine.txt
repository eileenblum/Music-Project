Full moon rise, fear-filled skies
Delicious evil in her bloodshot eyes
Hearts beat loud, to the bone
One way ticket, never comin' home

[Chorus:]
I got to kill all the sunshine
Cause, I'm the King of the Nighttime
The Lord of your Lifeline
And darkness is divine
So kill all the sunshine

Set your clock, Start your chime
Come midnight, we'll celebrate that you're mine
Fell the fire in my touch
You're gonna get the thing that you
wanted so much

[Chorus]
