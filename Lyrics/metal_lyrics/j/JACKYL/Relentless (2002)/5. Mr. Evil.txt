Now you went and spilt your guts on the floor
About the things you think that I ignore
Can't you see I tend to your needs
That are important
You say just hold me, but that just ain't enough
I see through it when you call your own bluff
Can't you see I'm just a man that's doin' the best I can
To make you glad that you're a woman

[Chorus:]
You call me the bad guy yet
You love all the things that I do to you
Yea I'm Mr. Evil
Give the Devil his due

No deeds too small to go unnoticed
Good or bad, you must me punished
You've been a bad girl
I don't think you ever intend to change
Why should you change
And I can see you're certainly a woman

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
And all I want is for you to get what's comin' to ya
I'm Mr. Evil

[Chorus]
