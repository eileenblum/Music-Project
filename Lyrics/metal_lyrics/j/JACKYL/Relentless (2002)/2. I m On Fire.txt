Here I stand now
don't you
recognize me me
Give this Devil his due
I'm still the man and that may
surprise you
and I am far from through
I got a plan, it's not hard to see
I make my moves while you are looking at me
There's only one thing for you to understand
If there's two in the bush, then there's three in my hand

[Chorus:]
I can't stop, No I ain't a quitter
I'm on fire, ah baby I'm a home run hitter
You can turn your back on me now
And I'll still find my way
Cause the sun don't shine on the same dog's ass everyday

I crave the crunch, cause it fuels my fire
I'm like a Bon Scott, I'm a live wire
I got a bitch, I got a bitch to pitch
You just struck it rich
If you're looking for a good time
No it's not hard to see
Well if your lookin' at me
Then you can say you've seen Rock City

[Chorus]
