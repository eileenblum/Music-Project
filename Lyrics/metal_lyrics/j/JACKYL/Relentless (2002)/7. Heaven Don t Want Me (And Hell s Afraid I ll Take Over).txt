[Chorus:]
Well Heaven don't want me and Hell's afraid I'll take over
Yea, I've been known to throw a damper on a party or two
And I chewed up and swallowed my own four-leaf clover
Now Heaven don't want me and Hell's afraid I'll take over

The Twelfth of never came
And I stood the one to blame
Redheaded stepchild in the face of all that's good
And I came to understand my life's in my hands
Can't ever bear to think of givin' up control again
I'm takin' over

[Chorus]

Far from the beaten path left of the aftermath
It was never my intention to try and tow the line
Anything, all or nothin'
Justify the means at end
Seize the moment, Seize the day
You never cease to stand in my way
Now I'm takin' over

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
I came to understand my life is in my hands
Can't even bear giving up control again

[Chorus]
