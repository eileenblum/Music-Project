Well I licked her clean from head to toe
I took her down for the count
She was ready for more
And you know she's got a dirty little mind
The way she walks
The way she grooves
I have to strap her down to keep up with her moves
And you know she's got a dirty little mind

[Chorus:]
She's got a dirty
Dirty
Dirty
Dirty
Dirty little mind
Dirty little mind

Stretched out in the night
What do I feel?
I feel so good it just can't be real
And you know she's got a dirty little ind
Well she makes me smile, yeah she makes me glad
She's B.A.D.
Yeah man she's bad
And you know she's got a dirty little mind

[Chorus]

And I know what she's thinking
Yes I know what's on her mind
You've got to know, my lady's sinking into her mind
And I know she'll never let go
I've got her on a stick

[Chorus]
