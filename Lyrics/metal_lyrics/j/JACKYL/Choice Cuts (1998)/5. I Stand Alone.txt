Well everytime I move
Every step I make
You know I just can't seem to take
The right direction

I'm always wrong
I'm never right
Right or wrong
There always seems to be a correction

And I give everything I got
And they take take take
Everything I'm giving

My back is tired
My legs both ache
In this life
There is no cake
This life I'm livin'

[Chorus:]
I stand alone today
Don't ask me why I feel
I just know I feel this way
I stand alone today

Well you look at me
Shake your head
Don't like my hair
You're so misled...you do!

But the curse is more than on my head
Sometimes I think I'm better off dead
It's worse than voodoo

And I'm reaching out for help
But it's no no no no no
Until you give in

My back is tired
My legs both ache
In this life
There is no cake
This life I'm livin'

[Chorus]

They take, they take
Everything I'm givin'
It's a rough rough life
This life I'm livin'
Give me more, give me more
I take more every day
I'm gonna take it
Till they take take take take take me away

[Chorus]

I I I stand alone today
I I I stand alone today
I I I stand alone today
I I I stand alone today
I... I...
