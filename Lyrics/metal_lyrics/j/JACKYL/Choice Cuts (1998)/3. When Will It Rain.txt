When will it rain, I feel the heat burning through my shoes
Soft shoulders are getting harder adding to my blues
Can't count the days gone by, can't wish away the stain
On the life behind me from which I came

The heat is getting hotter
The day is getting longer
The sun will show no mercy, my nights are spent in vain
I chose this long road and on it I remain
When will it rain

[Chorus:]
When will it rain
Can't stand this heat from the road, can't stand the pain
When will it rain
It's burning holes in my shoes, won't you tell me
When will it rain
I think I'm going insane
When will it rain
I'm on the road that will never take me home
When will it rain

When will it rain my mouth is as dry as desert sand
And I've tried to hide in every corner of this land
You can't lose the things attached or that's what they say
Things I loved, attached or not, I've thrown away

The heat is getting hotter
The day is getting longer
The sun will show no mercy, my nights are spent in vain
I chose this long road and on it I remain
When will it rain

[Chorus]

I've walked for miles and miles in a dead man's shoes
You can walk, you can run, but can't hide from the blues
And I've felt the pain of the world falling down on me
All I need is a little cool rain to set me free

[Chorus]

When will it rain, when will it rain, when will it rain
