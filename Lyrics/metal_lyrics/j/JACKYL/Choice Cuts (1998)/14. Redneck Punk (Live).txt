I jumped straight off that trail today
Ain't nobody better get in my way no
Trail dust, sore butt, gotta get out of this 10 day rut

[Chorus:]
Whoa, gitty up and go
I'm a redneck punk
Mean, red, better off dead
I'm a redneck punk

Staring down the barrel of an old shotgun
I can tell tonight's gonna be some fun
Don't you step on my toes
And you won't find yourself with a bloody nose

[Chorus]

Hey you, long haired motherfuck
Show me how you do

I live like a gypsy, I live like a dog
Gotta hard enough time just doing without
And nobody ever better run their fucking mouth

[Chorus]
