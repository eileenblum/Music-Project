What you gonna do when the sun don't shine
And the moon don't come up right on time
What you gonna do when the storm won't break
And the whip don't crack
And the earth won't quake
What you gonna do when the knife won't cut
The blood won't flow and ya mouth run dry
What you gonna do when it crumbles in your hand
It's an eye for an eye when your high horse dies

[Chorus:]
Primed and ready
Feelin' nasty, seein' red
Locked &amp; loaded
Locked &amp; loaded
Locked &amp; loaded
Aimin' for your soul
Locked &amp; loaded

What you gonna do when the lightning flash
And ya bridges burn and ya start to crash
And a pill won't take the pain away
But it makes you feel good in a different way
Who ya gonna blame when the man calls time
And the clock runs down and your soul is mine
And how ya gonna pray when ya hands are tied
And you look in my face and you know I lied

[Chorus:]
Primed and ready
Feeling' nasty, seein' red
Locked &amp; loaded
Locked &amp; loaded
Locked &amp; loaded
Aimin' for your soul
Locked &amp; loaded

I'm your danger
Feed me with your fear
I'm your danger
Smell me drawing near

[Chorus:]
Primed and ready
Feelin' nasty, seein' red
Locked &amp; loaded
Locked &amp; loaded
Locked &amp; loaded
Aimin' for your soul
Locked &amp; loaded
