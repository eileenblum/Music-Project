See the bird on the barstool looking for a jerk
If she likes the way he looks she'll put his ass to work
And you know she's been all around the block
She's tried a doctor, lawyer, even tried a jock
But she loves my cock

[Chorus:]
Loves my cock
She loves my cock
Loves my cock
She loves my cock

Ain't no need to change it, that's just the way it is
got to find a bigger jerk, she got to have his jiz
And you know she's been around the block
She's tried a doctor, lawyer, even tried a jock
But she loves my cock

[Chorus]

There's as many hands on her as the knob on the door
She's such a pretty pretty pretty little whore
To get my cock she'd walk through the flames of hell
Cause I can always tell when she's coming
I can always tell

[Chorus]
