It's hell in the morning to look at you lying in my bed
Another morning after you know I'm wishing you were dead
Maybe hit by a truck, rammed by a train
You must be crazy 'cause you're driving me insane

[Chorus:]
I'm just like a devil
You're just like a witch
You only like me because I scratch your itch
I'm too much a bastard, you just like to bitch
I'm just like a devil, you're my witch

I drag my ass into work, I hate my job, you know my boss is gay
You wonder why I save my dough
Then wonder why you have to pay my way
I should give you up, walk away I know I should
But the fact still remains
You're finger licking good

[Chorus]

In the midnight hour the smell of love filling up the room
I keep my horns nice and sharp to keep you quick on your broom
You like to raise lots of hell
I like to lower the boom

[Chorus]
