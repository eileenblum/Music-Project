Trapped in hell, that's where I live
in an endless struggle to survive
Concrete jungle meshed with steel
Will I make it out alive?
Take a walk on the wild side
Take what you want but live in fear
Of a bullets sting or the edge of a knife
People dying ain't that nice?

Look and tell me what do you see?
Brother killing brother in the land of the free
Welcome to hell in the U.S.A.
A nightmare takes the place of the american dream

Helpless junkies burn their brains
with the magic pumping in their veins
Eye of the needle smoke of the pipe
Crack and heroin are God!
Walk the market, place of flesh
Erotic pleasure for a price
Brought down by a deadly plague
The party's over, say goodbye!

Look and tell me what do you see?
Sodom and Gamorrah in the land of the free
Where the demons of the inner sanctum
Breed to kill and bring you
down to your knees and watch as your city bleeds

The violent truth is what this is
It's an endless struggle to survive
It's time to take the hand of destiny
With the angels of the light cause we got to be free
