[The lyrics to this song are no doubt controversial, however please consider this explanation: this song deals with a character who is taken advantage of emotionally and sexually under the pretense of a romantic relationship. Scarred by betrayal this person hardens their heart and becomes a perpetrator rather than to seek healing. This is not the answer and unfortunately it is all too often repeated]

She said she loved me, she must have lied
She raped my innocence and part of me has died
I want to be your lover, I want to be your friend
But all she wanted was a cheap one night stand

So now I've decided that this will end
Cause this will never happen to me again
I make my own rules now, in this new game of sex
So look out baby!
I want a piece, I want a piece of your flesh.
I want a piece of your flesh!

Honey open wide, let the love inside
I need someone to show me I'm alive
And I'll forget my fears and I won't shed no tears
Taste the sweat and blood of passion's dance tonight

Crack the whip it's time to have some fun
A game of lust and pleasures has begun
Two hearts bleeding racing into the night
Keep it pumping honey, ride baby ride
take me to the limit! 

Never satisfied, no one sees the pain I hide
I stand alone the child inside has died, no
Dreams are swept aside by the hunger of this vice
With a heart of steel I fade into the night, oh

Slave to this vice is what I've come to be
A sickening love for immorality
Erotica comes to take my flesh again
Heaven help me from this nightmare that I'm in
Can you help me?
