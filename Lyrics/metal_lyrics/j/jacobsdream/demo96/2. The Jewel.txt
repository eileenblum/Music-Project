I see you, you're crying, you're sick and tired of trying
And I feel you, your sorrow, you're afraid to face tomorrow
Oh something's the matter, there's only tears, no laughter
And it's a razor for sadness, and pills to end the madness

Oh in the night, hear me cry, I'm calling for you
My love is free, can't you see
You're the jewel in the eye of my heart

I want you and I need you, one chance is all I'm asking 
My love is unending, my joy is everlasting
And my promise I give you that I will leave you never
And I'll hold you and keep you to be with me forever...

Oh in the night, hear me cry, I'm calling for you
My love is free, can't you see
You're the jewel in the eye of my heart

Daddy's busy, mother has no time
Sister says everything will be just fine
Where did it start, where did it begin?
But you can live, yes you can love again

Oh in the night, hear me cry, I'm calling for you
My love is free, can't you see
You're the jewel in the eye of my heart

Take my hand, a new day's dawning
Its an everlasting morning
Stand by my side and let it last forever
Take my hand, don't be afraid now
Take the love that you have longed for
Stand by my side and let me love
Love your fears away!
