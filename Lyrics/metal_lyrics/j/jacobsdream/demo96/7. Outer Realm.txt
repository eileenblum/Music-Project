I was staring out the window
My thoughts dancing on the wind
Thinking of the future
And the things that could have been
Twenty-four and all alone
In a world of pain and fear
The hands of time move slowly-quick
And the night is drawing near

Ever reaching higher
Is this my mission? It's my decision
Will is locked in motion
The wheels are turning, the fire is burning
Haunted by a vision, caught in time
The music is my mission, free your minds

I was looking back on my life
Like a thousand times before
What's the meaning of it all
And what's worth living for?
Love and passion, truth and glory
An endless quest for dreams
Yet my heart beats in frustration
Crying for these things

Ever reaching higher
Is this my mission? It's my decision
Will is locked in motion
The wheels are turning, the fire is burning
Haunted by a vision, caught in time
The music is my mission, free your minds

Standing at the crossroads
But I think I know the way
Just let this music take me:
Let my heart and soul engage
And take me to dimensions
That my eyes have never seen
Just let this music take me
To the outer realm of dreams, dreams
Let the music take me
Take me to the outer realm of dreams
