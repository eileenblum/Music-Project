Life is a journey that you must take my son
Take care and live it well because there's only one
Remember there's a purpose that you were meant to be
You have a heart, you have a mind, you are humanity
Listen!
Challenges will come
Storms will rage against your heart
Face them and be strong
Face them and be strong!

A lifetime of learning is what I give you
When you make a choice in life, be sure to think it through
Wisdom holds a treasure of knowledge in her hands
Take care and love her well, you'll be a better man
Listen!
Learn to understand
Use the gifts that you possess
Find your destiny
Dare to live your dreams
Challenges will come
Storms will rage against your heart
Face them and be strong
Face them and be strong!

Watch your back, protect your mind
Always keep your objectives clear till the day you die
Find your destiny
Dare to live your dreams

Pain will come, tears will fall
Guard your heart, keep your vision clear, rise above it all
Find your destiny
Dare to live your dreams
Find your destiny

Can't you feel the hunger that's growing in your heart?
Let your gifts consume you, let them tear your fears apart
Hear the voice of reason that's calling from the sky
Face the winds of future with a fire in your eyes
