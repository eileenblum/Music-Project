I guess I'll walk alone in the pouring rain
I hold this candle that burns in your name
With every teardrop that falls from my eyes
I can't forget you, your memory never dies
But I can't help a feeling that I've been betrayed
'cause I'm the one that's left out here in the pouring rain
I feel the touch of a hand that's so familiar
How I long for yesterday, I long for yesterday!

Pain is so real
it's a shame that a heart must feel such a loss
In this world that is cruel, full of storm and ocean
I lost your love when I let you go
I wish that you could have stayed with me
And now you've turned and said goodbye
It's raining tears and my heart is breaking
Something inside me has died
Now that you're gone from my side
And all that is left are these damned memories
Of lost love and gained sorrow

Love is so real... it's a God that is never changing 
And love shall remain in my heart as I keep on living
I lost your love, but I'll let you go
I wish that you could have stayed with me
And even though you've said goodbye
It took some time but my heart is mending
Something inside me's alive
It seems that my soul has survived
Tomorrow will come and I will be free
To love someone, to love another
