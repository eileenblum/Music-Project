Itâs my eyes that tell me to believe again
It's my mind that tells me to give up
âCos Iâll never know what change may come along
But I donât wanna give it up

Itâs just an eye for an eye
Not worth another try

Losing my innocence
Canât make it stay, it slowly fades away
Losing my innocence
Day by cay, it slowly fades away

Isnât it funny, my dreams still last
It could be so nice, itâs not under my control

I feel a fire inside, yet you canât see it on the surface
It heats up my heart and one day I will drown in flames

It's the way I feel, all is black and white
No colour lies between, the contrast blinds my sight

Losing my innocence
Canât make it stay, it slowly fades away
Losing my innocence
Day by cay, it slowly fades away

Isnât it funny, my dreams still last
It could be so nice, itâs not under my control

Once I thought, we are good by nature
Iâm no longer sure

But it's the doubt that keeps me working
Itâs the doubt that tells me to go on
