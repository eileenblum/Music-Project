As I m looking out into the night
And count the stars all shining brightly
I donât know were I am and were Iâm going

Sometimes it seems Iâve lived before
And I can see beyond the door
But itâs just a notion I leave showing

I might wake up young again
With feelings of a new day
But itâs leaving
Youth is leaving me

Iâm looking back and see 10 years have gone
Nothingâs happened and nothingâs done
A few more scares is all I have at last

Sometimes I wish I could turn back the time
Iâve done so much without reason or rhyme
But itâs too late to change the way I choose

I might wake up young again
With feelings of a new day
But itâs leaving
Youth is leaving me
