Weâre not informed, manipulated by well selected truth
We shouldnât see, shouldnât hear it, it might disturb our sleep
Theyâre casting TV-games, live is but a game-show
Daily lullabies, the newest one's called desert hunt

Letâs see if we can beat the high-score bonus points for every thousand dead shot Arabs
Paralized, we donât know whatâs going on
Paralized we canât change it anyway

Clear the news so we can see the world thought your eyes
Clean and brave, in your war's no place for dying

Paralized, we donât know whatâs going on
Paralized we canât change it anyway

He was good enough to act as your catâs-paw
In his fratricidal war, just a means to an end
Now it's too late, you fought fire with fire
And you still feed the flames.
Ainât you scared to burn yourself?
