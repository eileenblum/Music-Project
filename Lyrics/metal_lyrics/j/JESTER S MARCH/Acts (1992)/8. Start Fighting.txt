Iâm looking around, donât like what I see
All the doors have been closed as the night draws near
I feel the suspense, it clings in the air
Takes only a spark to rouse the people out there

No, you can't imprison a whole nation day by day
No, you can't treat them, can't treatâem this way

Start fighting for your lives
Just take what you deserve
Start fighting for your lives
And donât give in

Nom youâre trapped again, in chains of gold
They sparkle and shine,
They wonât set you free

Youâre wrong to believe, in all that was told
Hold on to your dreams, donât ever give in

No, you can't imprison a whole nation day by day
No, you can't treat them, can't treatâem this way

Start fighting for your lives
Just take what you deserve
Start fighting for your lives
And donât give in
