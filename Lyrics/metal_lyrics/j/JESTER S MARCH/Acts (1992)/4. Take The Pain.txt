Sheâs sitting alone in her bedroom
Not for the first time
Heâs sleeping next door
She wonât cry
She touches her cheek that is bleeding
Not for the first time
And no one believes her
She dares to sigh

How can he do so?
She loves him so

How can she take the pain?
No one out there'd believe her
How can she take the pain?
There's no one to cry to

He's coming home late at night
He's drunk again
She has to be careful
Heâs dangerous
Not even her mother can help her
Heâs out of control
They know his bad temper
Untamable

How can he do so?
She loves him so

How can she take the pain?
No one out there'd believe her
How can she take the pain?
There's no one to cry to
