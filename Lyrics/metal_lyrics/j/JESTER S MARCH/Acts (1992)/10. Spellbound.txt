Weâre walking at night
In neon light
And weâre bound
Weâre bound by spell
Our victims await
And we donât hesitate
We donât causeâem no pain
We gotta do it again now

You keep me spellbound
Forever young
You keep me spellbound
Forever young

You told me to believe
But you let me down
Feel my pain
Canât you help me again?
I fall to decay
Before your eyes
I know how you feel
No need to pretend now

You keep me spellbound
Forever young
You keep me spellbound
Forever young
