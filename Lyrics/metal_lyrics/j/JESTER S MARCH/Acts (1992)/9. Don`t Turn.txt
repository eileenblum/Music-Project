Lifeâs passing fast this side of paradise
Iâm watching days follow days
Faster it goes the longer you stay
Itâs running away in a blink of your eye

We canât escape the times me live in
Must play our part while our time runs off

But I ainât gonna cry a tear
Itâs the way itâs meant to be
No, I ainât gonna cry a tear
No time to waste

Donât turn around,
Donât try to hide in memories
Donât turn around,
Look ahead and find a new horizon

But I ainât gonna cry a tear
Itâs the way itâs meant to be
No, I ainât gonna cry a tear
No time to waste

Donât turn around,
Donât try to hide in memories
Donât turn around,
Look ahead and find a new horizon

Look inside your heart
And youâll know the way
Look inside your heart
Let it lead you
