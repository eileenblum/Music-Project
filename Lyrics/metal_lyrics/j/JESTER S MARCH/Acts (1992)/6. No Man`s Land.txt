Out in the streets on the pavement
Alone in the creeping night
No one's there to care about
All their fears in the fading light

No school to go to, no education
No chance to leave this misery someday
All hopes and fears are to find a few bucks
Theyâd make'em kings for a day

Theyâre living in the no man's land
Theyâre living on the edge of tomorrow
Theyâre living in the no man's land
Their lives are nothing but sorrow

Wasted days, wasted childhood
Thereâs no way to be a child today
Just having fun on the playground
Carelessly running with the wind, one day

Theyâre living in the no man's land
Theyâre living on the edge of tomorrow
Theyâre living in the no man's land
Their lives are nothing but sorrow
