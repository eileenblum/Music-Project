This is your fate so dare to look through the fire
Cross the water and step through the gate
Time holds your key to the future
Don't turn, past might be hard on you
So get on your feet and run for your life
This is your fate

Memories guide my way through all this emptiness
No time to lose no thoughts to spend
I have to find my way through all this loneliness
Follow the signs that they have send

I could not face the truth
I'm on my way into the void
And all life drifts through my hands
Into the void

Look at the light can't you see the sorrow
Follow the light it could seal your destiny
So get up to a silver lining, and step out
Oh step out

Memories guide my way through all this emptiness
No time to lose no thoughts to spend
I have to find my way through all this loneliness
Follow the signs that they have send

Dreams wonât be lying
I canât wait till I sleep tonight
And when I call the masters voice tonight
Oh, oh I fear to hear
And someone answers all the lies
That disappear

Look at the light can't you see the sorrow
Follow the light it could seal your destiny
So get up to a silver lining, and step out
Oh step out

I could not face the truth
I'm on my way into the void
And all life drifts through my hands
Into the void
