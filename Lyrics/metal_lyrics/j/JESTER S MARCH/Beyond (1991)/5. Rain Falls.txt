I'm looking out of the window
And there ain't no trace of poison lying there
But itâs all around us
And every step we take brings us closer to our end
I can see the end
And every bite I'm taking
Is bringing back a fear I canât define
I canât define, no

Rain falls, rain falls, rain falls
And youâd better close your eyes
And what about our children
Will they be able to enjoy their life like we do today?

Rain falls, rain falls, rain falls
And youâd better close your eyes

And it's poisoning my dreams
Nothing's like it seems
And when I frighten up by night
I start to cry'

Rain falls, rain falls, rain falls
And youâd better close your eyes
