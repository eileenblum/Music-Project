He looks around but something's missing
Where did they go, was there a reason to leave him alone?
He doesn't know what is happening
Just realizes that he's now on his own

He only sees a face covered with steel
No, no, it canât be true

Heâs been so blind to believe him
But all his friends will come they won't ever let him fall
He's so sure they will save him
But no one comes around to free him at all

And all he used to hear all he used to know
Falsehood and deceit, their rhapsody in lies

The jester came alone and stole all he used to have
Took away his dignity and took away the crown
Now he is all alone and thinks about what he did wrong
No comfort is in sight and he is on his own

And the jester is still smiling sitting on the throne
Satisfied he's laughing as he puts on the crown

And all he used to hear all he used to know
Falsehood and deceit, their rhapsody in lies
