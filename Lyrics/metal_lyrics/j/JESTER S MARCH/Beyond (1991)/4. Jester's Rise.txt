He was a crippled kid, got no one at his side
âCos he looked so deformed he avoided the daylight
He didn't believe in childhood, hadnât seen it yet
Never felt the loving touch of a motherâs hand

Still he never felt a thirst for revenge
His fate was to live all alone
But he saw whatâs going on all around
They starved in the name of thee crown
They died for the crown

He only knew a change has to come
Stood innocent in front of the sin
Accused the king of being cruel and false
He was sentenced to wear a mask of steel

So come on watch the jesterâs rise
He's calling your name in the dead of the night
So come on watch the jesterâs rise
He's calling your name in the dead of the night

After the execution the pain didnât stop
But after a while he knew he could stand up
The king wanted to see him to feast his eyes
On a stigmatized crawling down on the ground

Now a jester he entertained the king
By and by he relied on him
He carefully began to tell him lies
Influenced the king by and by

So come on watch the jesterâs rise
He's calling your name in the dead of the night
So come on watch the jesterâs rise
He's calling your name in the dead of the night

Oh, thank the Lord that I'm still alive
Behind this mask of steel
I'll taste sweet revenge
For the pain I had to feel
He's poisoned by my lies
And he's too blind to see
But I have to be so careful
I mustn't lose my head in the end

He's got what he wanted the king's caught in his trap
Captured in a net of lies so delicate and thin

So come on watch the jesterâs rise
He's calling your name in the dead of the night
So come on watch the jesterâs rise
He's calling your name in the dead of the night
