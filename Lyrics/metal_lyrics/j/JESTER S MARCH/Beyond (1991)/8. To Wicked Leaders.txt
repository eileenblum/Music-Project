Youâre rich and you got all
I can only dream of
The holy dollar rules your life
Your greed of profit makes you blind

You see them starving, watch them dying
Out in the cold
Make a donation, have a clean slate
Your eyewash wins
The image is restored

Knock them out again, it won't be the last time
But do the innocent and you'll get through

Buy and sell, itâs never enough
Take as much as you can get, no matter whoâs dying
Sell your soul at any price, itâs never enough
Make a bargain but youâll see, itâs never enough

You are never satisfied. No cure for your disease
One day you'll wake up .at the end of your way
There wonât be no helping hand, no helping hand in sight

Buy and sell, itâs never enough
Take as much as you can get, no matter whoâs dying
Sell your soul at any price, itâs never enough
Make a bargain but youâll see, itâs never enough

But one day we'll be dying, no matter if weâre rich or poor
That's the only justice even you can't change
