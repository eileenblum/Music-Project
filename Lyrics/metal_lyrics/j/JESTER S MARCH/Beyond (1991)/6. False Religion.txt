Never use a rubber or you'll burn in hell
Says the holy man and he must know it well
Everything's forbidden that you might enjoy
Never touch yourself or you must apologize

Don't you think it's wrong?

The altar waits for another sacrifice
What is it now virginity has got it's price

I have a vision of my life
But in your eyes Iâm living ion sin
All my life

Itâs your false religion, controlling your mind
Itâs your false religion, blinding your heart

Father forgive them, they know what theyâre doing
Persisting in yesterdays lies
They donât know whatâs really happening
Have no slightest idea
And theyâre praying all day for remission
But they'll never forgive all your sins
No chance for a sinner

You promise heaven will one day return
But in the meantime shall I sit and wait?
Just tomorrow, you're great in promises
But I'm afraid tomorrowâs much too late

I have a vision of my life
But in your eyes Iâm living ion sin
All my life

Itâs your false religion, controlling your mind
Itâs your false religion, blinding your heart
