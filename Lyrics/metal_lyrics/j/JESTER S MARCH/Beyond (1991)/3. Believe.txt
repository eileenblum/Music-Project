Just broken people, not welcome anywhere
You're always on the run and never find a place to rest
Nowhere at home, no, not in your real estate
And no one gives a damn so you try to reach the west

You know a lot of pain could be waiting
Just a little chance to get to the land of promise
You're on your way now so you have to keep on running
Just to arrive and to be driven back again

We're making progress, not in humanity
The century of refugees don't seem to find its end
Home for the homeless, I guess wi'll never be
We only close our eyes, don't want to understand

You know a lot of pain could be waiting
Just a little chance to get to the land of promise
You're on your way now so you have to keep on running
Just to arrive and to be driven back again

But believe in your dreams, believe in your dreams
Youâve got nothing to lose at all
So take your chance right now
