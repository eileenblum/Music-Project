Dreaming of a place so clean and fine
But I don't think that I will find it anywhere
I'm searching on and on again
But my time is wasted. I can't find it nowhere

See the dream, face the facts, can't you see the difference?
All was clear, it's turbid now, what have we done?

I hope we'll never reach the point of no return
I'm afraid we've shut the door

Changing times
I guess weâre living in the middle of madness
Changing times, letâs start again

And I take a look around
Itâs a view in bitterness
We must stop and turn, canât you see it now
Put an end to madness

See the dream, face the facts, can't you see the difference?
All was clear, it's turbid now, what have we done?

Watch the sunlight, it burns your skin
I hope we'll never reach the point of no return
I'm afraid we've shut the door

Changing times
I guess weâre living in the middle of madness
Changing times, letâs start again

And when I look around and face the world like it is
It's still a place I'd like to live in
Still I hope this Earth will be one day a place of bliss
And the cradle for our children
But my hope is fading, the time's running out

Changing times
I guess weâre living in the middle of madness
Changing times, letâs start again
