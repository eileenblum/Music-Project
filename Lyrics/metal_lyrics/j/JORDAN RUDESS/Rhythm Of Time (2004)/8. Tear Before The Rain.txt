There in the afterglow
My solo world in view
A glimpse beyond the world I know
An open door that I walk through?

And falling from the sky,
a tear before the rain.
But it will pass me by -
holding back again...

A man possessed wings to fly
beyond this space and time
The rhythm of this heart of mine
Is beating like a battle cry

And if I let it go
Will strength provide relief
from fearful winds that blow -
only disbelief

Tears falling
I'm calling
out into the air
My sun is rising where I stand - (I know)

One day I wake up
and suddenly I'm found
High flying man has been unbound (and so)

the hourglass is winding down
as all becomes so clear

now tears that fall are all around
and rainbows in the sky appear

Tears falling
I'm calling
out into the air
My sun is rising where I stand - (I know)

One day I wake up
and suddenly I'm found
High flying man has been unbound (and so)

And here I am once more
I'm standing in the light
much stronger than before

A tear before the rain one tear before the rain.
