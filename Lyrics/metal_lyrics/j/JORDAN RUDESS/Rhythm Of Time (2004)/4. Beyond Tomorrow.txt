I remember only yesterday
Seems like not so long ago
Moving sideways on a shifting stage
Don't know where time seems to go.

I watch myself turn away
all in a memory
rewinding just a single page
Now it's all coming back to me...

There's a young man in an endless dream
projecting through a world of sound
fingers fly and then a silent scream
always high above the ground

I'm living - this moment
Through all the years
Illusion - in my mind
washing out the fears

One day I'll be far from here
A star beyond tomorrow
and distance beyond this sphere
will lead me on!
