[Lyrics: Danne]

In the tower of darkness
In the land of ice
A faceless man laughs at our pain
He reigns in sorrow, reigns in blood
Hatred flows through his veins and his immortal soul

Tides of darkness sweeps through the world
Like a cold wind from the north
It's the dawn of the dark, the age of the damned
As the ancient empire arises again

The sounds of battle fills the air
Fields covered in blood
And the ashes spreads with the wind
Only darkness remains
Pain haunts the world tonight
Fields covered in blood
And the mourning people walks
Like shadows in the night

Suffering their loss
Digging shallow graves
As the tides of dankness drains
Their weakened souls

On a mountainside a monument still stand
It's the monument of pain and despair
It will stand until the end until nothing remains
Until the hammer shall fall
Until the immortal dies
Our fate is sealed and my sorrow turn to hate
The entire kingdom dies from within
Turns into dust, disappears with the wind
Like shades from the past, lost in the eternal void

The wilderness calls my name
It speaks through the wind and rain
As I walk through filth and gore
Only darkness remains
Pain haunts the world tonight
Fields covered in fire
And the mourning people walks
Like shadows in the night
Suffering their loss
Digging shallow graves
As the tides of darkness drains
Their weakened souls

Voices appears in my head
Voices of death are gathered inside
Eating my mind and conquers my soul
Another breed shall be born

It's calling...

On a mountainside a monument still stand
It's the monument of pain and despair
It will stand until the end until nothing remains
Until the hammer shall fall
Until the immortal dies
Our fate is sealed and my sorrow turn to hate
The entire kingdom dies from within
Turns into dust, disappears with the wind
Like shades from the past, lost in the eternal void

Only darkness remains...
