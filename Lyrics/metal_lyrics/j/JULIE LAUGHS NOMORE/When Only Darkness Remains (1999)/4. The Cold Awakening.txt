[Lyrics: Danne]

A shade of death appears at the horizon
With a cold embrace arrive the angels of darkness
From a rip in the sky, the portal of madness
A furious dawn, the dawn of destruction

A violent holocaust - inevitable, fate is calling
Ancient rage - reveals the lack of faith
The art of suffering - infernal pain, eternal twilight
Seals the sense - now dethrone the king with the crown of thorns
The lord of emptiness - in covenant with the lord of hatred

On the eve of life - and the serpent rises from the lake of fire
A violent holocaust - submit to death, submit to darkness
Vanquish faith - obliterate the human race
Open the halls of might

Behold the dragon of light, the defender of life
Raise the banner of the sun, unite the Templar's of the ancient realm
And the knights of the crown adore the gods of the sun

Pitiless, invincible

Solemn rites upon the altar
Solemn rites on the glowing altar, enthrone the emperor
Bring the storm, the storm of sorrow
The storm of flames, salvation in fire - the art of suffering
Ancient rites, the words of power
Carved in stone, unseals the tower - behold the altar of death

Pain strikes me down to the sour ground
A mighty pain, deep down inside
And my valour turns to fear
But my vocation remains
I stare at the wasteland of the damned
Not far away I rise again
Must ignore the infernal pain
My vocation remains

Bow for the emperor - the superior, the dominator
Subdue the world - conquer the sacred grounds
A cold awakening - to the sound of drums the drums of power
Steel meets steel - on the field of war where there's no more honor

Open the halls of might
Behold the dragon of light, the defender of life
Raise the banner of the sun, unite the Templar's of the ancient realm
And the knights of the crown adore the gods of the sun
Find the river of blood, seek enlightenment in the world beyond
Seal the source of the damned, the curse of the land

Pitiless, invincible
