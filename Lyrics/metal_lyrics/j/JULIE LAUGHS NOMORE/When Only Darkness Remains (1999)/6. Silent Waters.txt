[Lyrics: Danne]

On silent waters, I travel through the night
A silent warning, the dawn of no sun

A shadow guides my way
Through the dying landscape
Through the shades of gray
I crave the light

Gods in rage
Darkness will rise
The eternal dies
On the throne of life

In the temple of the dead
On the mount of sorrow
I've seen the fate of life
I've heard the cries from the pit of fear

By the altar of death
A man stands alone
Raising his arms to the sky
Sorrow calls
From the mountain of skulls
From the castle of pain
The altar of death shines again

Tears - tears of rage, tears of sadness
Fear - fear of death, fear of life

I stand on the edge of the world (absorbing the last of light)
I stand in the cold (from where shadows are born)
Dark clouds now covers the sun (eternity fades away)
As faith turns to stone (now enter the dark)

Enter the cold, enter the dark
Enter the cold, enter the dark

Still an army stands against the hordes of night
On wings of fury they ride
As demons rise from their dark domains
A rain of fire falls from the sky

Like tears of rage, tears of sadness
Fear - fear of death, fear of life
Hear - hear the cries, hear the mourning
Behold the souls of death, of emptiness

By the altar of death
A man stands alone
Raising his arms to the sky
Sorrow calls
From the mountain of skulls
From the castle of pain
The altar of death shines again
