[Lyrics: Danne]

The full moon shines from above
The children of the night
Hides in the shadows, pale as cold moon light
They rise now from beyond death

Voices whispers to me
Join us you mortal slave
Open the gates of fury
Enter the halls of the damned

I'm falling into the domains of madness
Darkness all around
Sadness stands besides me
No faith am I a living dead

Alone and resigned resurrection denied
I feel the cold embrace of a semblance in black
My failure is my fate, I'm a slave of the gods
In the parade of the undead underneath the black sun

I'm safe deep within in my fortress I reign
I'm a god in my fortress of fallen pride
I kneel to my pain, I'm safe deep within
As the cold winds sweeps across the world

The serpent rise from beneath the waves
He who reigns in fury, he who speaks through pain
Rises from his ancient tomb

Voices whispers to me
Enter oblivion
Rest now rest forever
Die now you mortal slave

Your fate is now, you shall never die
Your body falls, and your spirit shall rise
Give into hate, your true nature calls
Your fate is now, in the ashes of life

Open up your soul, and your weakness will be gone
Join us in the cold, and your pain will be gone
Open up your mind, and you shall suffer nomore
Join us in the hall, feel the endless flow

I'm safe deep within in my fortress I reign
I'm a god in my fortress of fallen pride
I kneel to my pain, I'm safe deep within
As the cold winds sweeps across the world
