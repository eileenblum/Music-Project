[Lyrics: Babbaen]

"It's when the day erase the night and the light will last forever,
the evil seek its shelter inside the dark dwell of a human heart.
Twisting the mind with desire and a never-ending hunger.
In the ashes of the midnight sun your soul will die and I will come alive"

Morning air and you suffer
Do you remember?
Wipe the blood from your hands
What have you done?
See the reflections of terror
You're not alone inside
Your mortal corpse is my mask
A dwell of evil

Under the sky, where the angels cry
The urge for blood, is tearing
Die! In the need of life
When the hunger ablaze your soul

Possessed by terror
Inside your haunted mind
Awakes the seed of madness and I rise
Desire, the never-ending hunger (the ever burning flame)
Blood desire a venomous disease
The rage grow strong
In the ashes of the midnight sun
Awakes the cold dark inside
The desire a never-ending hunger (an ever lasting need)
Blood desire and the venom run inside
The burning veins of mine

Stare into the fire of madness
Your mind is numb and you're shattered inside
And I feel the taste and smell the desire
You're down on your knees and I'm crawling inside of you

Tormented, denied
Hollow inside
The sweetness of pain
You are lost forever

Feed, you're trapped in this night and soon I'll be born
Unleashed, in a wicked mind
Face, your face is my mask and you can't hide
Can't hide cause I'm inside

When mortals die, under the sky
I'll come alive, inside of you
Die! In the need of life
When the hunger ablaze your soul

Possessed by terror
Inside your haunted mind
Awakes the seed of madness and I rise
Desire, the never-ending hunger (the ever burning flame)
Blood desire a venomous disease
The rage grow strong
In the ashes of the midnight sun
Awakes the cold dark inside
The desire a never-ending hunger (an ever lasting need)
Blood desire and the venom run inside
The burning veins of mine
