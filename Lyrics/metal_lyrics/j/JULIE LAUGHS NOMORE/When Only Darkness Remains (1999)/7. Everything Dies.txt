[Lyrics: Danne]

The full moon shines upon the fields ahead
And something's howling from far away
The soldiers of the night has awakened
Hatred shall prevail, everything dies

Slow pain, slow death, deep grief, shallow mind
The preacher of the night has awakened
The realm of darkness lives, everything dies

The end of time is near it's almost within reach
Getting closer every day, moving faster now
It travels with the wind, now hear its words
Cause it speaks to you again

Life is old, life is dying, pain is strong, pain is mortal
Life is old, life is dying, pain is strong, pain is mortal
Beneath the remains I hide from the hordes of night
Seeking shelter in the forbidden land

Old, it's so old, it's so old, it's so dead

I rise once again I must walk to the land of the dead
The dragon is calling my name as he's dying in pain
He suffer the eternal dies
Rise once again I must walk to the river of blood
In a quest for the source of this pain and
The source of our fate
I suffer the eternal dies

Behold the crown of tears
Hidden for a thousand years
Now recovered once again
Just waiting for the king

Eternal pain surrounds me it shapes me it's so cold
It flows through the river of souls
An endless gray swallows the sun and my faith
I mourn as everything dies
