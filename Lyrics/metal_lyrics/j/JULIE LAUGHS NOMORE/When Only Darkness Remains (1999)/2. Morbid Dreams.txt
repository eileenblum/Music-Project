[Lyrics: Julie Laughs Nomore]

If I feel pain, I know I'm alive
Morbid visions, morbid dreams
A demons winter, I sense the cold

Am I worthy
The sun shall never shine upon the souls of mortality
Immortal as I am, I wish upon death
Release me, release me, release
I'm repulsed by light, and I feel condemned by you, by all

Am I a god, am I chosen
Am I human
Am I a Christ, am I a god
Am I chosen, am I a Christ

I stand on the edge of life
My suffering you feel, loneliness tortures me
As I stand before the icon of death
Torn between pain, relief- pain or death

Underneath the sun
I suffer in the shelter of faith
I kneel before the icon of death
My visions turns to ashes as I cry for your help
A test of power
A decisive phase
The final hour
End of pain

Broad daylight, turns into darkness
The color of your icon blurs before me
The blessing you gave, turned to a curse
The color of you icon blurs before me

Am I a god, am I human
Am I a Christ

I stand on the edge of life
My suffering you feel loneliness tortures me
As I stand before the icon of death
Torn between pain, relief- pain or death

If I feel pain, I know I'm alive
