[Lyrics: Danne]

I hear the wind it's calling my name day and night
It whispers about power and might
It grabs me it haunts me from inside
A whispering wind claims my life

I'm wondering around in the mist of the night
And I don't know where I am
I see visions of blood visions of death and despair
I'm falling, I'm falling towards a black hole deep inside
I look down on my grave look down on my self as I rise

I hear them suffer, I hear them dying

I can feel the power, the power of death
As it strikes me to the ground
I'm lost on the edge, my mind is in rage
Resigned I look up to the sky with a desperate vary
Trembling by the pain, abandoned by life surrounded by death

Now rise you mortal rise see the death of your paradise

Ride like the wind, fear the crown and the king
Fear the voices within, fear the fire beneath you
So ride until the end until the sun rise again
I will see you again, when the fire is dying
And my powers are falling again

I stand on the field of the damned
I see my fate ahead
So close to the end, my soul is drained
Life fading away, desperation calls
My fate lies ahead, I must die again
I hear the wind calls my name
As I stand in flames
So close to the end, my fate is now
I rise one more time, but I fall again
My powers are gone, will I see you again

Open the gate, open the gate to the palace of death
I am home again after 200 years, but I will resurrect again, some day

Arise from the depths of the grave to the palace of death
See the throne of the king, surrounded by flames,
Surrounded by death and despair
Now sit on the throne you king of the dead,
Raise the crown to you head
He's back again let us hail the king

Now rise you mortal rise see the death of your paradise

Ride like the wind, fear the crown and the king
Fear the voices within, fear the fire beneath you
So ride until the end until the sun rise again
I will see you again, when the fire is dying
And my powers are falling again
