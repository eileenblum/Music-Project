[Lyrics: Danne]

I am the lord of shadows
I'm the eternal twilight
The god of gods, the sovereign of all (I own you)

I am the great defender
I am the cold avenger
I am the sea, the sky (I am your master)

I am the sword of fury
I am the shield of mercy
I am your pain, your fate, your greed (Your shadow)

I am the endless winter
I'm the infernal fire
I feed your hate, your pride (I am your madness)

And I see the kingdom beyond the sky
As I open up my eyes
Drifting in a sea of fire
It never die
It feed, it grows so far away
As I open up my eyes
Drifting in a sea of fire
It can never die

A furious storm, rides the sky
Like a guest from eternity
Desperate cries, silent moans
Can be heard through the wind and I
Fear it's strength, I fear the one
The bringer of misery
Drains our souls, burns the sky
The sovereign of the world is so alone

I feel, the cold, I fear that that the winter never dies
I fall, again, I rise, my strength is so far away
I feel, the cold, I fear that life is almost gone
I raise, my hands, towards the murderer above

And I see the kingdom beyond the sky
As I open up my eyes
Drifting in a sea of fire
It never die
It feeds, it grows so far away
As I open up my eyes
Drifting in a sea of fire
It can never die
