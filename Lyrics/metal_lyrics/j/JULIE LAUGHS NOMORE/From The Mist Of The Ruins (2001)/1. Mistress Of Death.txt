[Lyrics: JLN]

Her search for life has just begun

Marching on the devils own
Marching on towards the moonlight throne
Driven by her morbid lust
Seeks for pleasure in virgin blood

She's the evil one - for centuries she's lived alone
With vicious eyes - she casts the spells of black
The queen of the night - a beautiful beast that seduces all the shattered minds

She craves your soul - from the depths of your inner void
Mistress of death - in the hall of the moonlight throne
Queen of the night - from the land of the twilight gate the ruins of future she holds

The bringer of centuries of pain
With a venomous desire
See the bringer of everlasting pain
She the goddess of the flames
She glows, she feeds

She speaks inside my mind - awakes my dark desires
Angel of sin - controls my inner fire
Am I the one - to give her the strength to survive one more furious night

Embraced by darkness
Embraced by she who claims my

Life - I'll find no shelter
Drown - in eyes so black as night
Night - I feel her anger
Why - am I a chosen one
One - I'll find no shelter
Drown - in eyes so black as night
Night - I feel her anger
Why - am I a chosen one

Trapped in a darkened place - I can hear the endless moans
A cold embrace - An erotic sense of pain
Am I the one - to give her the strength to survive one more furious night

Dead stars guides my way (I burn I flames)
Enslaved by her eyes
Life fades away (I die in fire)
Dead stars above, on dead ground I walk

I resist the fire
I resist desire
I resist the pain
I will die with you, I

Embraced by darkness
Embraced by she who claim my

Life - I'll find no shelter
Drown - in eyes so black as night
Night - I feel her anger
Why - am I a chosen one
One- I'll find no shelter
Drown - in eyes so black as night
Night - I feel her anger
Why - am I a chosen one
One - there will be no sorrow
Die - I'll slowly fade away
Away - won't see tomorrow
Die - I'll slowly fade away
