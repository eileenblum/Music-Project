[Lyrics: JLN]

The eve of life - the gods in anger
A dying light - the last defender
Embrace me now - the wind gets colder
I hide inside my shattered mind

Chaos grows - the end comes closer
Roaring storms - the hordes of darkness
Marching on - the sky is bleeding
No way to escape the power unknown

All strength is gone
All hope is lost
All the lights are gone
See the dragon rise
Towards the sky
The age of the damned
Feel the demonic rage that will conquer all

Death, feeds, life, life seeks death

Life starts to fade away
Life dies in flames

I saw it come, I saw that deadly sign
I'm not afraid, I feel no more fear, no more pain
A century of flames, I need it now
I need it to die to be free

Through the furious flames
Pain craves life

Through blazing skies - through endless winter
On the throne of life - dies the last defender
The dragon cries - the wind gets colder
I hide inside my shattered mind

A blast of rage - it lives for your pain
On dying ground - I walk one last time
My time has come - my soul is dying
No way to escape the power unknown

Watch the children of the empty cross
Cry in fear for the wrath of angels
Blessed are thee, who eternally bleed
Watch the bleed, watch the sinister bleed
Souls burning in furious flames
The sun, the moon in vicious games
Heavens laughter, the devils greed
Watch them bleed, watch the sinister bleed
Watch them bleed, watch them, watch them die

All strength is gone
All hope is lost
All the lights are gone
See the dragon rise
Towards the sky
The age of the damned
Feel the demonic rage that will conquer all

Death, feeds, life, life seeks death

Life starts to fade away
Life dies in flames

I saw it come, I saw that deadly sign
I'm not afraid, I feel no more fear, no more pain
A century of flames, I need it now
I need it to die to be free

Through the furious flames
Pain craves life
Life starts to fade away
Life dies in flames
