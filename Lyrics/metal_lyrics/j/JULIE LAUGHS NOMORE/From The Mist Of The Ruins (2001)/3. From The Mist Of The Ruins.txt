[Lyrics: JLN]

I see a semblance rise
Though the cold and stormy night
And it calls my name

A bloodred light - from a black horizon
Cries - From the wilderness ahead
A mighty pain - Strikes from deep within me
fire - that burns inside my soul
On wings of death - I travel through the night

Through the fire, through the cold, through the dark
No more dreams, no more hope, no more cries
No more fear, no more, pain no more life
Eternity fades and dies
Through the burning horizons of life
Through the furious blackness of death
No more fear, no more pain, no more life
I see everything die

Save me now - release my demons
Die - and let me live again
My time on earth - has passed me by
Free . let me be forever more
I who will not be - seeks for

Life, life - am I a devil in your eyes
Eyes am I a devil in your eyes

I see a semblance rise - From the mist of ruins to the open sky
I see a light so bright - that will lead me on towards the other side
I see a semblance rise - From the mist of ruins to the open sky
Another world that dies - that will take me further to the other side

I am - the fire, the cold
I am - your dreams your hope now
I am - your fear your pain, I'm the furious one
I see - the fear in your eyes
You'll feel - the evil inside you
I see - everything die

Seven seals, they have opened the all
Screams of fear, the demon calls, seven angels in hatred crawl

Master oh master, I beg you please help me
My mind is a slaughters, but my eyes still can see
My soul is bleeding, I want you to judge me
Clean me in fire, set my soul free

Take me oh take me from this death and destruction
My name has been carved into the corpse that I've taken
Master oh master I want you to judge me clean me in fire
Set my soul free, now, free, die, now

Through the fire, through the cold, through the dark
No more dreams, no more hope, no more cries
No more fear, no more, pain no more life
Eternity fades and dies
Through the burning horizons of life
Through the furious blackness of death
No more fear, no more pain, no more life
I see everything

Die, Die - am I a devil in your eyes
Eyes, am I a devil in your eyes

I see a semblance rise - From the mist of ruins to the open sky
I see a light so bright - that will lead me on towards the other side
I see a semblance rise - From the mist of ruins to the open sky
Another world that dies - that will take me further to the other side
I saw a semblance rise - from the mist of ruins to the other side
I saw a light so bright - from the morning stars to the darkest night

I saw my face in your eyes, and now you're gone
You'll feel no more pain
You'll feel no more pain
