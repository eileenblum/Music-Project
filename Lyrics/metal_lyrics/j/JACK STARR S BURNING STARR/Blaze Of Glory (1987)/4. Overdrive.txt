I like the sound of a 100 watt stack ringing in my ears
I wanna hear the beat of pounding drums,
It gets me out on the floor
Screaming vocals cut like a knife
Shattering everything in sight
Booming bass coming through the floor
I just can't stand it, I gotta have more

Overdrive, I wanna hear it loud
Overdrive, I'll never turn it down
Overdrive, don't want no alibi
If you think it's too loud then you're just too old!

Well it's twelve o'clock and I'm ready to go
It's time to start the show
When me and the boys get on that stage
You know we're gonna rock and roll
Heavy metal is in our veins
Maybe we're a little insane
You can say we're out of control
But we can't stop now 'cos we're on a roll

Overdrive, I wanna hear it loud
Overdrive, I'll never turn it down
Overdrive, don't want no alibi
If you think it's too loud then you're just too old!
