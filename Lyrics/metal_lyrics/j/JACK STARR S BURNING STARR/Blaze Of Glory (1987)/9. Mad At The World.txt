Don't try to keep me down
Cos I've got something to say
We might not live tomorrow
So we got to live today
You talk about the reasons
Why you think that I'm insane
You think that I'm a fool
But I'm too smart for your game

Cos I'm mad, I'm mad
Yeah, I'm mad, fighting mad, mad at the world

Don't tell me to be satisfied
When nothing's going right
There's children out there dyin'
'Cos no one gives a damn
The city is on fire
And it's not a pretty sight
I'm sick and tired of living
In this dirty no man's land

Cos I'm mad, I'm mad
Yeah, I'm mad, fighting mad, mad at the world

I'm mad at the pushers
Mad at the pimps
Mad at the yuppies
Mad at the wimps
Mad at the businessmen on the make
Man at the judges on the take
Mad at the leaders who build more bombs
Mad at the DJs who don't play our songs
Mad at myself for going along!
