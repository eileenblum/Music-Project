We were born to be free
Loud and fast our destiny
Heavy Metal is the only way to go
We are loud and we are proud
We grow stronger everyday
We are here to stay
And we will never go away

We're the metal generation
Cold blue steel runs in our veins
We're the metal generation
Don't fuck with us cos we're insane

If we have to, we will fight
We'll take the world and make it right
We are strong we will survive
Raise your fist up in the air
Hold your banners way up high
Heavy Metal will never die

We're the metal generation
Cold blue steel runs in our veins
We're the metal generation
Don't fuck with us cos we're insane
