Standing in the shadows
Waiting in the dark
His mind is filled with hatred
There's anger in his heart

Your number's up, he's on his way
You got no hope so get down and pray

Don't you know he's a killer
Don't you know he wants your life
Don't you know he's a killer
Don't you know he wants your life

Hiding in the hallway
All alone in the dark
His eyes are burning bright
In his hands he hold the knife

Your number's up, he's on his way
You got no hope so get down and pray

Don't you know he's a killer
Don't you know he wants your life
Don't you know he's a killer
Mercy killer don't take my life
