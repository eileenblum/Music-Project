I see faces of the children of the bomb
I hear the cries of unknown victims of the storm
There's panic in the streets, fear thru out the land
Now that the button's pushed It's time to make our stand

I'm going out in a blaze of glory
Burn my name across the sky
Going out in a blaze of glory
Never stop until I die

I see the cities crumbling right before my eyes
I hear the sound of dying, fire fill the sky
But I won't run away, there's no place anyway
I'll crank up my guitar and blast the world away

I'm going out in a blaze of glory
Burn my name across the sky
Going out in a blaze of glory
Never stop until I die
