Don't take no shit from no one
Don't let them tell you how to run your life
You're free to do whatever you want to
Don't say you can't till you give a try

The world is fill with broken down losers
They'll try to bring you down
You get one shot so try not to blow it
This is your life, it's time for a showdown

Stand up, stand up and fight
Don't be afraid, you've got nothing to lose
Tonight's the night now it's time to break loose

We're taking over, when the world has you down
And there's no one around
When there's danger knocking at your door
And everybody wants more

The world is fill with broken down losers
They'll try to bring you down
You get one shot so try not to blow it
This is your life, it's time for a showdown

Stand up, stand up and fight
Don't be afraid, you've got nothing to lose
Tonight's the night now it's time to break loose

When the night is closing in
And there's nowhere to hide
Evil shadows in the streets looking for same meat
A wall of fire is no disguise
They steal your heart and twist your mind
But you got to stand tall and look them in the eye

Stand up, stand up and fight
Don't be afraid, you've got nothing to lose
Tonight's the night now it's time to break loose
