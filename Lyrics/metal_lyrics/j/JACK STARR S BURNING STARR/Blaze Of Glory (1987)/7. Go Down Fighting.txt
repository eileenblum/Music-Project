Out in the streets you fight to survive
Cause no one cares, no one cares if you live or die
Walking alone in the heart of the city
Never give in to the beasts that roam

If you gotta go, if you gotta go,
Go down fighting, go down fighting

Your money plus your life,
That's what they want
But you'll never get, never get me without a fight
I get knocked down
But I keep coming up
And I'll get back to you, a night attack
I'll make you have a heart attack, right now

If you gotta go, if you gotta go,
Go down fighting, go down fighting

And when your back's against the wall
And there's no escape at all
Take your aim and make your stand
You've gotta take it like a man!

If you gotta go, if you gotta go,
Go down fighting, go down fighting
'Cause it's the only way to die.
