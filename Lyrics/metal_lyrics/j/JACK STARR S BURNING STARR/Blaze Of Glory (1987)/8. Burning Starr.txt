Leaving a trail that no one escape
Burning Starr lights up the sky
Slicing a path of power and might
Burning Starr rips up the night

Sail away on wings of twilight
Catch a ride on a flash of white light
Never forget who you are, Burning Starr!

When you were young did you have a dream
Did you wish upon a star
Dreams can happen no matter who you are
If you believe what's in your heart

Sail away on wings of twilight
Catch a ride on a flash of white light
Never forget who you are, Burning Starr!
