OUT IN THE STREETS LOOKING FOR ACTION
I'M ON THE RUN I'M ON THE RUN
I'M RACING MY ENGINES, BURNING MY WHEELS
I'M JUST HAVING FUN
PEOPLE SAY I'M NO GOOD BUT I DON'T GIVE A DAMN
GOTTA KEEP RUNNING CAUSE IT'S TOO LATE TO STOP

I'M, AH AH, A ROAD WARRIOR
I'M, AH AH, A ROAD WARRIOR
I'M, AH AH, A ROAD WARRIOR
I'M, AH AH, A ROAD WARRIOR

WHEN YOU SEE ME YOU BETTER RUN
'CAUSE YOU'RE UNDER MY GUN
I LIKE TO DESTROY, I LIKE TO BURN
I'M THE SPEED DEMON, YOU'LL HAVE TO LEARN

PEOPLE SAY I'M NO GOOD BUT I DON'T GIVE A DAMN
GOTTA KEEP RUNNING CAUSE IT'S TOO LATE TO STOP

I'M, AH AH, A ROAD WARRIOR
I'M, AH AH, A ROAD WARRIOR
I'M, AH AH, A ROAD WARRIOR
I'M, AH AH, A ROAD WARRIOR
