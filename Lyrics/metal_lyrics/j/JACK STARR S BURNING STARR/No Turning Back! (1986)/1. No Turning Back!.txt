YOU LIVE ALONE, THAT'S THE WAYIT'S GOT TO BE
YOU SING YOUR SONG BUT NO ONE EVER SING ALONG
THEY TRY TO TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME
BUT SOMETHING INSIDE OF YOU SAYS GIVE IT ONE MORE TRY

NO TURNING BACK FROM THE LIFE THAT I CHOOSE
NO TURNING BACK, I'VE GOT NOTHING TO LOSE
I WILL KEEP THE FLAME ALIVE

THEY TRY TO BRING YOU DOWN AND MAKE YOU TRIP AND FALL
TELL YOU YOUR LIFE IS A WASTE AND MAKE YOU FEEL REAL SMALL
THEY TRY TO TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME
BUT SOMETHING INSIDE OF YOU SAYS GIVE IT ONE MORE TRY

NO TURNING BACK FROM THE LIFE THAT I CHOOSE
NO TURNING BACK, I'VE GOT NOTHING TO LOSE
I WILL KEEP THE FLAME ALIVE

'CAUSE THERE'S A LIGHT SOMEWHERE IN THE NIGHT
WHERE ALL YOUR DREAMS WILL SOMEHOW TURN OUT RIGHT
IF YOU BELIEVE WITH ALL OF YOUR MIGHT
YOU'VE GOT TO SHOW THE WORLD
YOU'LL NEVER GIVE UP FIGHT

NO TURNING BACK FROM THE LIFE THAT I CHOOSE
NO TURNING BACK, I'VE GOT NOTHING TO LOSE
I WILL KEEP THE FLAME ALIVE
NO TURNING BACK!
