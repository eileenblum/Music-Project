HEAR THE THUNDER, SEE THE FLAMES
WATCH THE FIRE FILL THE SKY
SMOKING ASHES, BURNING RAIN
NOW THERE'S NO ONE LEFT ALIVE

NO MORE DAY NO MORE NIGHT
NO MORE BLACK NO MORE WHITE
THE GAME IS OVER WE HAVE LOST
NOBODY WINS IN A NUCLEAR FIGHT

WE'RE ON A TRAIN GOING NOWHERE
WE'RE ON THE PATH OF DESTRUCTION
WE'RE ON A TRAIN GOING NOWHERE
WE'RE ON THE PATH OF DESTRUCTION

CRIES OF PAIN, FLASHING LIGHTS, WARMING SIGNS ARE EVERYWHERE
SIRENS RINGING IN THE NIGHT, IT'S TOO LATE TO STOP THE FIGHT
LIGHTS COME UP IN MY REARVIEW MIRROR, I CAN SEE, I CAN FEEL
I CAN KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE

WE'RE ON A TRAIN GOING NOWHERE
WE'RE ON THE PATH OF DESTRUCTION
WE'RE ON A TRAIN GOING NOWHERE
WE'RE ON THE PATH OF DESTRUCTION
