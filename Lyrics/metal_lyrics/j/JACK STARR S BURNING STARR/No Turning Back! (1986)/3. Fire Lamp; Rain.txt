JUST YESTERDAY MORNING THEY LET ME KNOW YOU WERE GONE
SUZANNE THE PLANS THEY MADE PUT AN END TO YOU
I WALKED OUT THIS MORNING AND I WROTE DOWN THIS SONG
I JUST CAN'T REMEMBER WHO TO SEND IT TO

I'VE SEEN FIRE AND I'VE SEEN RAIN
I'VE SEEN SUNNY DAYS THAT I THOUGHT WOULD NEVER END
I'VE SEEN LONELY TIMES WHEN I COULD NOT FIND A FRIEND
BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT I'D SEE YOU AGAIN

WON'T YOU LOOK DOWN ON ME JESUS
YOU'VE GOT TO HELP ME MAKE A STAND
JUST GOT TO SEE ME THRU ANOTHER DAY
MY BODY'S ACHING AND MY TIME IS AT HAND
I WON'T MAKE IT ANY OTHER WAY

I'VE SEEN FIRE AND I'VE SEEN RAIN
I'VE SEEN SUNNY DAYS THAT I THOUGHT WOULD NEVER END
I'VE SEEN LONELY TIMES WHEN I COULD NOT FIND A FRIEND
BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT I'D SEE YOU AGAIN
