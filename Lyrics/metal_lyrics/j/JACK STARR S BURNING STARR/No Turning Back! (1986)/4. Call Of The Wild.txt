ALWAYS ALONE, ALWAYS ON THE RUN
SAVAGE BEAST, THEY SAY YOU SHOULD BE SHOT
IF THEY CATCH YOU THEY'LL TEAR YOU LIMB BY LIMB
JUST BECAUSE YOUR LIFE'S A SIN

CAN'T YOU HEAR THE CALL OF THE WILD
IT'S CALLING OUT TO YOU
CAN'T YOU HEAR THE CALL OF THE WILD
IT'S CALLING OUT TO YOU

STANDING TALL LIKE A SAVAGE BEAST
WILL YOU BE ABLE TO STAND THE HEAT
MANY HAVE TRIED TO TRAP AND PUT HIM DOWN
NOW THEY'RE ALL BURIED IN THE GROUND

DON'T THEY HEAR THE CALL OF THE WILD
IT'S CALLING OUT TO YOU
DON'T THEY HEAR THE CALL OF THE WILD
IT'S CALLING OUT TO YOU
