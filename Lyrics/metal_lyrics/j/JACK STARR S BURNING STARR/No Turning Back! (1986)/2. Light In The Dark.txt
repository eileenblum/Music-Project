EVER SINCE THE WORLD BEGAN
FEAR AND DARKNESS RULE THE LAND
IS THERE ANY HOPE FOR MAN
OUT IN THE DISTANCE WE CAN HEAR
THE SOUND OF ARMIES MARCHING NEAR
NOW IT'S TIME TO MAKE OUR STAND

THERE'S A LIGHT IN THE DARK
WHERE SHADOWS FEAR TO TREAD
WHEN YOU WISH UPON A STAR
THAT'S WHEN YOU'LL FIND IT
A LIGHT IN THE DARK

ON AND ON THE STORY GOES
THOUGH YOU'VE BEEN TOLD A THOUSAND TIMES
NOW THERE IS NO GOING BACK
IF YOU FOLLOW WHAT'S IN YOUR HEART
YOU CAN NEVER BE DECEIVED
YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP ON BELIEVING

THERE'S A LIGHT IN THE DARK
WHERE SHADOWS FEAR TO TREAD
WHEN YOU WISH UPON A STAR
THAT'S WHEN YOU'LL FIND IT
A LIGHT IN THE DARK
