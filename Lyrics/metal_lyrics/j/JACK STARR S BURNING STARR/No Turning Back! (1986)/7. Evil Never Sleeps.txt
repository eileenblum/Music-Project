FLASHING LIGHTS, THE SOUND OF RAGE
ANGUSH AND HATE FILL THE AIR
A VICIOUS CIRCLE A DEADLY MAZE
ENTER THE WEB IF YOU DARE

BUT THERE IS NO ESCAPE FOR THOSE WHO TEMPT FATE
AND YOU'LL NEVER KNOW WHAT HORROR AWAITS
A NIGHT ON THE RACK A STAB IN THE BACK
NO ONE IS SAFE

EVIL EVER  SLEEPS

A QUIET NIGHT ON AN EMPTY STREET
A MADMAN WALKS OUT ON HIS BEAT
A LITTLE GIRL IN A PRETTY WHITE DRESS
BEHIND HER BACK IS THE KILLING KNIFE

BUT THERE IS NO ESCAPE FOR THOSE WHO TEMPT FATE
AND YOU'LL NEVER KNOW WHAT HORROR AWAITS
A NIGHT ON THE RACK A STAB IN THE BACK
NO ONE IS SAFE

EVIL EVER  SLEEPS
