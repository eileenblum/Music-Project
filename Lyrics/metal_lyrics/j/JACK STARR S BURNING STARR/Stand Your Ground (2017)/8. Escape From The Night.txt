Rise to your feet
Through the raging storm
Rise to the calling
Hear the cry of today and beyond
Waking up from a dream
I've seen this place before
Shadows fallen over me
Leaving their chill, but now they're all gone

When the shadows fall
Your backs against the wall
You must rise above it all
Escape from the night

See the burning skies
Feel the power inside
Only the strong will survive

There's no respite
No time to catch your breath
They wield the power
We hold our hopes and dreams for ever
As free as the wind
We'll ride through blackened skies
To the end of the earth
We'll march until the rain stops falling

When the shadows fall
Your backs against the wall
You must rise above it all
Escape from the night

See the burning skies
Feel the power inside
Only the strong will survive

A story left untold
Memories from days of old
And up from the ashes
We'll rise again and live forever
Darker days are in the past
Another page has turned at last
And at the end of the rainbow
Is it gold or just another lost soul

When the shadows fall
Your backs against the wall
You must rise above it all
Escape from the night

See the burning skies
Feel the power inside
Only the strong will survive
