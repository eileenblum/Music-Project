Into this world, we are born
From shelter and warmth, we are torn
We ask for love, in a world of hate
Moving blindly toward our final fate

All that has lived also must die
The flesh will perish, but the spirit survives
We have the key that unlocks time
If you believe then you'll see the sign
You'll see the sign

Walk with me across the sea
To a place only we can see
Open the gates to a secret place
Where only you can see your destiny

The chance has been taken
The die has been cast
The path has been chosen
There is no way back

So don't look away
From the face in the mirror
We all become
Just what we deserve

We'll climb the mountains
We'll part the seas
We'll do whatever it takes to be free
And in the end what will be will be
We all must face our destiny
Destiny

Walk with me across the sea
To a place only we can see
Open the gates to a secret place
Where only you can see your destiny
Destiny

Fading embers
Of the life we knew
The flame still burns and it burns for you
Open the door
That unlocks time
And look beyond the walls of your mind

We'll climb the mountains
We'll part the seas
We'll do whatever it takes to be free
And in the end what will be will be
We all must face our destiny
Destiny

Walk with me across the sea
To a place only we can see
Open the gates to a secret place
Where only you can see
Walk with me across the sea
To a place only we can see
Open the gates to a secret place
Where only you can see your destiny
Destiny
