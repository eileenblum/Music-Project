In the darkest night
Where there is no sound
Only the silent tears
That fall to the ground

There is no force
That can calm the sea
There is no voice
That brings harmony

To the ends of the Earth
'Til my last dying breath
'Til the stars cease to shine
'Til the end of time
To the ends of the Earth
'Til the last rays of light
'Til the oceans are dry
When our world has died
I will come for you

When the desert winds
Burn through the sky
And the last rose of summer
Has wilted and died

When the new city crumbles
Returns to sand
All the people will perish
Before the promised land

To the ends of the Earth
'Til my last dying breath
'Til the stars cease to shine
'Til the end of time
To the ends of the Earth
'Til the last rays of light
'Til the oceans are dry
When our world has died
I will come for you

Let the cold winds blow
Let the oceans roar
Let the storm clouds gather
As the flames grow higher
Let the thunder roar
Let the lightning strike
Let the angels cry
They call your name
To the ends of the Earth
'Til my last dying breath
'Til the stars cease to shine
'Til the end of time
To the ends of the Earth
'Til the last rays of light
'Til the oceans are dry
When our world has died

Let the cold winds blow
Let the oceans roar
Let the storm clouds gather
As the flames grow higher
Let the thunder roar
Let the lightning strike
Let the angels cry
They call your name
