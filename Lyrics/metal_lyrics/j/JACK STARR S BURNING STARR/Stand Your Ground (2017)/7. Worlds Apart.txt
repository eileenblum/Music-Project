Sometimes I feel like everything has changed
Time passes by and nothing stays the same
We were so close
But now so far away

We have become
Worlds apart
When darkness hides the sun
Worlds apart
When all is said and done
When all that we believe
Turns out to be lies
Nothing can survive
When you're worlds apart

I must find a way
To bring back yesterday
In my darkest hours
Silent tears fall like rain
They fill me with the pain
And haunt me once again

We have become
Worlds apart
When darkness hides the sun
Worlds apart
When all is said and done
When all that we believe
Turns out to be lies
Nothing can survive
When you're worlds apart

It's too late to find
The dreams that we left behind
Secrets of another time
Shadows remain
Of hopes that have come and gone
Never to return again
Never will they return again

We have become
Worlds apart
When darkness hides the sun
Worlds apart
When all is said and done
When all that we believe
Turns out to be lies
Nothing can survive

We have become
Worlds apart
When darkness hides the sun
Worlds apart
When all is said and done
When all that we believe
Turns out to be lies
Nothing can survive
When you're worlds apart

So many worlds apart
I just can't go on another day
So many worlds apart
We have become
We have become
