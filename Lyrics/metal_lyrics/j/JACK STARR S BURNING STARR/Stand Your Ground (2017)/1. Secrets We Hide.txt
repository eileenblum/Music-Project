You wake up at night, you can't hear a sound
In silence you sweat, to silence your bound
The secrets you keep, are breaking you down
A trail of destruction will one day be found

You stand at the gates, with stories untold
You've fought for your freedom, they've taken your soul
You've turned a new page and there's no turning back
They don't need a reason, there on the attack

We hold the secrets for life
We are the ones they will sacrifice
We hold the secrets through time
We will forever be tied â to the secrets we hide
The secrets we hide

You stand at the edge, you've lost all control
The fingers are pointing, the bodies are cold
They don't need a key, to unlock your door
Your faith will be shaken like never before

We hold the secrets for life
We are the ones they will sacrifice
We hold the secret through time
We will forever be tied â to the secrets we hide
The secrets we hide
Secrets we hide
The secrets we hide

It's on the wall in writing
There is no use in hiding
You'll answer to the master
There is no ever after
The allegiance defied
No way to leave it behind

You're gasping for breath now, the faster you run
With dogs on their leashes, they're firing their guns
It's now open season, they're hunting you down
The truth you once fought for is what you have found

We hold the secrets for life
We are the ones they will sacrifice
We hold the secrets through time
We will forever be tied â to the secrets we hide
The secrets we hide
Secrets we hide
The secrets we hide
