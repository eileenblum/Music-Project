They sail on ships across the water
Marching in time straight across the sand
Rise to the call some die with honor
They fight for our freedom, the promised land

We see the signs we fear disaster
All hope for the future is in their hands
The land of the free forever after
Our fate could be sealed by their last command

We hail the righteous king of kings
We fly through the sky on broken wings
We dare to climb the highest peaks
But there's nowhere to hide
From the hell that's unleashed

The enemy walks, the enemy breathes
The enemy steals every one of your dreams
The enemy stalks, the enemy leers
The enemy feeds every one of your fears
The enemy's here

Forever believe we'll rise to glory
Forever we'll seek to make our stand
The lessons we've learned are silent warnings
The lessons they teach have forced our hand

We hail the righteous king of kings
We fly through the sky on broken wings
We dare to climb the highest peaks
But there's nowhere to hide
From the hell that's unleashed

The enemy walks, the enemy breathes
The enemy steals every one of your dreams
The enemy stalks, the enemy leers
The enemy feeds every one of your fears
The enemy's here

Like a thief in the night
With no fear in our eyes
We will fight to the death
We will survive
The time has come
And every battle must be won
We will ride into the sun
Until the next time we fly

See the lights, hear the sound
Feel the fire of every round
Show no mercy, show your faith
We're caught in the crossfire
The whole human race

We hail the righteous king of kings
We fly through the sky on broken wings
We dare to climb the highest peaks
But there's nowhere to hide
From the hell that's unleashed

The enemy walks, the enemy breathes
The enemy steals every one of your dreams
The enemy stalks, the enemy leers
The enemy feeds every one of your fears
The enemy walks, the enemy breathes
The enemy steals every one of your dreams
The enemy stalks, the enemy leers
The enemy feeds every one of your fears
The enemy's here

They rise, they fall
We survive through it all
It starts again
