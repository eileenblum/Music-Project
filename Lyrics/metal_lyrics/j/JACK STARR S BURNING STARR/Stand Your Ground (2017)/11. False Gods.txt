Bow down to the gods of money
The power and fame you so crave
Give praise to your cherished idols
Selling your soul for fools gold

One day you will finally find
The treasures that lie deep inside
Say goodbye to your shallow life
Turn away from the valley of death

Beware of the lies they speak
Beware of the signs
Temptation takes hold of the weak
Beware the false gods

Look in the mirror and see your face
Vanity, your fall from grace
Greed and lust have driven you mad
When will you see you've been had

[2x]
Beware of the lies they speak
Beware of the signs
Temptation takes hold of the weak
Beware the false gods

Liar
Deceiver
Liar
False gods bring you down

Bow down to the gods of money
But what will you take to the grave
Your day of judgement is at hand
No one cares how much you saved

Beware of the lies they speak
Beware of the signs
Temptation takes hold of the weak
Beware the false gods

Beware of the lies they speak
(helping your rise)
Beware of the signs
(to the ... heights)
Temptation takes hold of the weak
(they bring you down)
Beware the false gods

Beware of the lies they speak
(helping your rise)
Beware of the signs
(to the ... heights)
Temptation takes hold of the weak
(they bring you down)
Beware the false gods

Liar
Deceiver
Liar
False gods bring you down
