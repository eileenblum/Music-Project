Waiting for the answers that never come
Crying when your world has come undone
Lying to yourself and to those left behind

There is no reason and no rhyme
Are we just voyageurs in time
Looking for an end in sight
The darkness blinds the light

Don't wait so long
Farewell
The sky is falling
Wait so long
Farewell
The sky is falling down
And I don't care

Fighting for a cause doesn't make it right
Changing is the world right before our eyes

There is no reason and no rhyme
Are we just voyageurs in time
Looking for an end in sight
The darkness blinds the light

Don't wait so long
Farewell
The sky is falling
Wait so long
Farewell
The sky is falling down
And I don't care

No one can help you
There's no one to save you
You dug your own grave
Now you must pay

The sky is falling
And I hear the calling
Is there nothing we can do

If we believe
We can touch the sky
This is our sign
Now is the time

Hatred for the ones that you don't understand
Sacred is the life that we hold in our hand

There is no reason and no rhyme
Are we just voyageurs in time
Looking for an end in sight
The darkness blinds the light

Don't wait so long
Farewell
The sky is falling
Wait so long
Farewell
The sky is falling

Wait so long
Farewell
The sky is falling
Wait so long
Farewell
The sky is falling down
And I don't care

The sky is falling down
But I don't care

But I don't care
