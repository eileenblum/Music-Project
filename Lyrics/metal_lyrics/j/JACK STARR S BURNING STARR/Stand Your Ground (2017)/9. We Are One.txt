In the blink of an eye
We are frozen in time
We leave this dark world behind
In the garden of souls
The shadows rise bold
As memories fade, becoming cold

Underneath the blood red skies
Far away from the probing eyes
I come to you
To make all your dreams come true

I've been here once before
I have looked behind the door
Now I've come back
To set you free, just follow me

We are here, we are one
Never will we be apart again
When we hear the call
That's when we will come
Never will we fall
We are here, we are one
Never will we be apart again
When we hear the call
That's when we will come
Never will we fall
And together, hand in hand
We will walk this barren land
And once again
We'll build our life on ruins of the past

So it was and so it shall be
We can't live and not be free
Now is the time
And this is our sign, follow me

We are here, we are one
Never will we be apart again
When we hear the call
That's when we will come
Never will we fall
We are here, we are one
Never will we be apart again
When we hear the call
That's when we will come
Never will we fall

If by chance, we meet again
On a cold black rainy night
Without a star
We'll find a way to keep our dreams alive

We are here, we are one
Standing tall, until the end
We are here, we are one
We'll return to fight once again
Once again

We are here, we are one
Never will we be apart again
When we hear the call
That's when we will come
Never will we fall
We are here, we are one
Never will we be apart again
When we hear the call
That's when we will come
Never will we fall
