They're in for the kill, run for your life
We hide from the truth every day
We live for the thrill, with demons they fight
And dragons still have to be slayed

Forget all the promises, all that has changed
Our will to survive will always remain

They're fighting in the streets
Spreading the disease
Our fate has long been sealed
The danger now is real
It's anger that you feel
Stronger than steel
Stronger, stronger than steel
We must be stronger, stronger than steel

Together we stand, divided we fall
Must rise to the challenge ahead
So don't fool yourself, they bark and they bite
There's always a price to be paid

The forces of evil are lying in wait
It's time to stand up before it's too late

They're fighting in the streets
Spreading the disease
Our fate has long been sealed
The danger now is real
It's anger that you feel
Stronger than steel
Stronger, stronger than steel
We must be stronger, stronger than steel

Why can't you see the light
In the fires of hell you are burning
In the grave with the souls who are turning
Basking in your pain

Why can't you hear the sound
Survivors of those who are crying
Their hopes and their dreams they are dying
As faith in humanity wanes

Time heals the wounds with a prayer
And the words that are spoken
Our spirit is bruised once again
But will never be broken

Remember the promises that once were made
Our will to survive will always remain

They're fighting in the streets
Spreading the disease
Our fate has long been sealed
The danger now is real
It's anger that you feel
Stronger than steel
Stronger, stronger than steel
We must be stronger, stronger than steel

Steel
Stronger than steel
Stronger than steel
