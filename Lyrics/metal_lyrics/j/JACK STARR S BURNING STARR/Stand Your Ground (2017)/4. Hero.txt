You feel the winds blow toward west now Hero
From a distant shore
And in the ivory tower where you live
It's not secure

Once upon a time your fate
Was all you had to fear
But if the axe comes down the fallout
Far beyond your years

Black clouds are rising in your wake
Now heed the warning

Will you be the hero
Will you be the savior of our plight
Will you be the hero
Will you be too late
Don't wait for the hammer to strike

Waves crash on the shore line
As the seas are rising higher
And as the clouds of death besiege us
A beast with eyes of fire

Black clouds are rising in your wake
Now heed the warning

Will you be the hero
Will you be the savior of our plight
Will you be the hero
Will you be prepared to sacrifice
Will you be the hero
Will you be the savior of our plight
Will you be the hero
Will you be too late
Don't wait for the hammer to strike

We turn our eyes up to the sky
Waiting for some kind of sign
A coward dies a thousand times
But a hero will always get by
In the darkness of the night
They will rise once again

To brave the heat we soon will need
To plot for our escape
It is no use to turn our backs
On the challenges we face
For those who fail to recognize
The fate that soon could come
Open up your blinded eyes
For the battle has begun

Black clouds are rising in your wake
Now heed the warning

Will you be the hero
Will you be the savior of our plight
Will you be the hero
Will you be prepared to sacrifice
Will you be the hero
Will you be the savior of our plight
Will you be the hero
Will you be too late
Don't wait for the hammer
Wait for the hammer
Wait for the hammer to strike
