Brothers can you hear me
I am calling out to you
It's the day of reckoning
This is the moment of truth

The enemy surrounds us
And he's out for your blood
The false ones have risen
Now's the time that you must choose
You must choose

Stand tall, stand proud
The storm is coming
Stand your ground
Stand tall, stand proud
The storm is coming
Stand your ground

In a distant time
We were strong and we were free
But now things have changed
And a tyrant rules the land

The will to live
Is something that comes from within
There's a voice inside that tells you
You must never give in, never give in

Stand tall, stand proud
The storm is coming
Stand your ground
Stand tall, stand proud
The storm is coming
Stand your ground

And if I die tonight
Answering freedom's call
I know my life was not
Given in vain
There's still some time
To do what must be done
We've got to stand together
And take back our land
Take back our land

You thought it was just a lie
You thought no one would ever die
Your eyes were so blind
But now the time has come

Brothers can you hear me
I am calling out to you
It's the day of reckoning
This is the moment of truth

The enemy surrounds us
And he's out for your blood
The false ones have risen
Now's the time that you must choose
You must choose

Stand tall, stand proud
The storm is coming
Stand your ground
Stand tall, stand proud
The storm is coming
Stand your ground

Don't cry, don't say goodbye
The storm is coming
But we will survive

Don't cry
Don't shed a tear
There's nothing left
Nothing to fear

Don't cry
When it's time to say goodbye
The storm is coming
But we will survive
