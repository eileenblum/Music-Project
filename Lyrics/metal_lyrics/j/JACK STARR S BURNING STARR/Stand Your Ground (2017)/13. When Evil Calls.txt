I hear the thunder as it crashes down from the sky
I see the lightning as it strikes another man down
I look to the heavens to see if anyone's there
Unanswered prayers, does anyone really care

When evil calls
I will not answer
I bow to no one
I serve no master
No demon in hell
Can break this spell
When evil calls
I will not answer
When evil calls

I walk the streets of a city that's dying
Between the shadows and the wind keeps howling
The sky is red and the moon is as black as the night
The book is open, the darkness has begun

When evil calls
I will not answer
I bow to no one
I serve no master
No demon in hell
Can break this spell

Cries of fear
So many silent tears
Endless time
Still searching for any sign
Stand together as one
Look to the skies and see
We will come together
Don't listen to the lies of the prophets of doom

When evil calls

He's been alive for many thousands of years
The living source of all your hate and fear
He is the one that never will be true
Don't be deceived by all his lies as he calls on you

When evil calls
I will not answer
I bow to no one
I serve no master
No demon in hell
Can break this spell

Cries of fear
So many silent tears
Endless time
Still searching for any sign
Stand together as one
Look to the skies and see
We will come together
Don't listen to the lies of the prophets of doom
When evil calls
