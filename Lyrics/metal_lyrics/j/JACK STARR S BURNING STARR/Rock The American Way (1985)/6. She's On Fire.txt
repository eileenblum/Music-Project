WHEN I SEE HER WALKING DOWN THE STREET
I FEEL SO WEAK THAT I JUST CAN'T SPEAK
COS SHE LOOKS SO HOT IN HER SKIN TIGHT SLACKS
HEAVY METAL ANGEL FROM ACROSS THE TRACKS

THE GIRL IS ON FIRE
SHE'S TOO HOT TO HOLD
SHE'S ON FIRE
BURNING OUT OF CONTROL

SHE'S ON FIRE
SHE'S ON FIRE
SHE'S ON FIRE
AND SHE'S GONNA TAKE YOU HIGHER

WELL SHE CAME ONE NIGHT JUST TO SEE THE SHOW
PLAYING IMAGINARY GUITAR IN THE SECOND ROW
WHEN SHE SMILED AT ME FROM ACROSS THE STAGE
I FELT SO GOOD I WAS IN A DAZE

COS THE GIRL IS ON FIRE
SHE'S TOO HOT TO HOLD
SHE'S ON FIRE
BURNING OUT OF CONTROL

SHE'S ON FIRE
SHE'S ON FIRE
SHE'S ON FIRE
AND SHE'S GONNA TAKE YOU HIGHER
