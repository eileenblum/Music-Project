WHEN I'M FEELING DOWN
I JUMP INTO MY CAR AND RIDE
I LIKE TO HIT THE STREETS
IN SEARCH OF SOME OTHER SOUND
AND NO ONE CAN SAY
THAT I'M TOO YOUNG TO ROCK
GOTTA ROCK, I KNOW WHAT IT TAKES
I'M GOING ALL THE WAY TONIGHT

LET'S LIVE FAST ROCK HARD
NEVER SAY DIE
LIVE FAST ROCK HARD
NEVER SAY DIE

NOW THE TIME IS RIGHT
I'M GONNA BE WITH YOU TONIGHT
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY
I'M GONNA GET YOU ANYWAY
COS I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU
AND I KNOW THAT YOU WANT ME TOO
THERE'S NO TIME TO WASTE
LET'S GET IT ON BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE

(WE GOT TO) LIVE FAST ROCK HARD
NEVER SAY DIE
LIVE FAST ROCK HARD
NEVER SAY DIE
