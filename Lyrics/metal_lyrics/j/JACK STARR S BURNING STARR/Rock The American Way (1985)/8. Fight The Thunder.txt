I'VE GOT A FUNNY FEELING
I0VE GOT SOMETHING TO SAY
I MIGHT NOT TO SEE TOMORROW
SO I'VE GOTTA LIVE TODAY
DON'T TELL ME ALL THE REASONS
WHY I'VE GOT TO PLAY THE CAME
THEY'LL TELL YOU THAT IT'S DIFFERENT
BUT IT'S REALLY ALL THE SAME...

YOU'VE GOTTA FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT
FIGHT THE THUNDER
YOU'VE GOTTA FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT
FIGHT THE THUNDER

DON'T THINK ABOUT TOMORROW
COS WE'VE ONLY GOT TODAY
I KNOW ABOUT YOUR REASONS
I REFUSE TO PLAY YOUR GAME
NEVER GIVE IN TO WHAT YOU FEEL IS WRONG
DON'T LET ANY ONE TELL YOU HOW TO SING YOUR SONG

YOU'VE GOTTA FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT
FIGHT THE THUNDER
YOU'VE GOTTA FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT
FIGHT THE THUNDER
