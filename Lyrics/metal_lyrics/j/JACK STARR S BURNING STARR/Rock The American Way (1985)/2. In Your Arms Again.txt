I LOVE YOU SO MUCH GIRL
I COULD NEVER HURT YOU
I WANT YOU SO MUCH GIRL
I'VE JUST GOT TO LET YOU KNOW

THIS LIFE'S KILLING ME
AND THERE'S NO PLACE I'D RATHER BE BUT

IN YOUR ARMS AGAIN
THAT'S WHERE I WANT TO BE
IN YOUR ARMS AGAIN
I'LL COME BACK TO LOVE YOU IF YOU GIVE ME A CHANCE

LIVING ON THE ROAD MAKES ME LONELY
CAUSE YOU'RE NOT AROUND
AND I WISH I COULD SEE YOU
WHEN I'M FEELING DOWN
BUT I KNOW I'VE GOT TO PLAY THIS SONG
JUST ONE MORE TOWN AND I'LL BE BACK,
I'LL BE BACK

IN YOUR ARMS AGAIN
THAT'S WHERE I WANT TO BE
IN YOUR ARMS AGAIN
I'LL COME BACK TO LOVE YOU IF YOU GIVE ME A CHANCE
