PEOPLE TALKING BUT THEY JUST DON'T KNOW
HOW I FEEL ABOUT ROCK'N'ROLL

IT MAKES MY LIFE FEEL SO COMPLETE
WHEN I'M DOWN IT'S GET ME HIGH
IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I'LL NEVER DIE
NOW I DON'T CARE WHAT PEOPLE SAY
NO ONE CAN TAKE MY ROCK AWAY

HEY HEY HEY
ROCK'N'ROLL IS THE AMERICAN WAY
HEY HEY HEY
ROCK'N'ROLL IS THE AMERICAN WAY
HEY HEY HEY
ROCK'N'ROLL IS THE AMERICAN WAY
FOR YOU AND ME...

HOT LIGHTS, STAGE RIGHT WE'RE PUTTING ON A SHOW TONITE
IF YOU'RE READY COME ALONG WITH ME
WE'RE GONNA SHOW HOW TO BE FREE
LET'S GET TOGETHER START A PARTY
WE'RE GONNA ROCK TIL THE VERY END
TURN UP THE VOLUME, CRANK IT ON TEN
ROCK'N'ROLL IS ON THE MOVE AGAIN

HEY HEY HEY
ROCK'N'ROLL IS THE AMERICAN WAY
HEY HEY HEY
