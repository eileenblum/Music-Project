EVER SINCE I REMEMBER I WAS A BAD BAD BOY
I BROKE ALL THE RULES WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL
THE TEACHER CALLED ME FOOL
NOW I'VE TURNED TWENTY TWO
I AIN'T GOT NOTHING TO LOSE
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING I LOVE TO DO

COS I WAS BORN TO ROCK
AND I'LL NEVER EVER STOP
BORN, BORN TO ROCK
AND I'LL NEVER EVER STOP
WE WERE BORN TO ROCK

IF YOU'RE FEELING DOWN AND OUT
AND YOU CAN'T SEE NO WAY OUT
DON'T WORRY DON'T YOU FRET
COS YOU AIN'T SEEN NOTHING YET
DIG OUT THOSE RECORDS CRANK UP THE STEREO
WE'RE GONNA PARTY TILL THE SUN COMES UP

COS I WAS BORN TO ROCK
AND I'LL NEVER EVER STOP
BORN, BORN TO ROCK
AND I'LL NEVER EVER STOP
WE WERE BORN TO ROCK
