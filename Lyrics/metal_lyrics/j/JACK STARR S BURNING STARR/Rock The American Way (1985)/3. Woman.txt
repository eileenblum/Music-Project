WOMAN YOU TAKE MY BREATH AWAY
I SAID WOMAN I CAN'T LET YOU GET AWAY

YOU MAKE ME HIGH, YOU MAKE ME CRY
AND ALL THE TIME I DON'T KNOW WHY
HURT ME ONCE I WON'T MIND
HURT ME TWICE AND YOU'LL PAY THE PRICE

WOMAN YOU TAKE MY BREATH AWAY
I SAID WOMAN I CAN'T LET YOU GET AWAY

YOU'RE SO WILD, LIKE A CHILD
YOU MAKE ME COME ALIVE
WHEN WE KISS I'M ON FIRE
MAKING LOVE IS MY ONE DESIRE

COS WOMAN YOU TAKE MY BREATH AWAY
I SAID WOMAN I CAN'T LET YOU GET AWAY

WOMAN I WANT YOU
WOMAN I LOVE YOU
WOMAN I WANT YOU BE MY
