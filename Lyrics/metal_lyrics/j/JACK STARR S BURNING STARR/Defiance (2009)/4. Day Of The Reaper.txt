You better beware, you better take care
there is no escape from the cold hands of fate
If you've been bad and I know that you have
the time has come to plead for your life

It's the day of the reaper, it's the end of your life
It's the day of the reaper, face the light
It's the day of the reaper, it's the end of your life
It's the day of the reaper, face the light

Don't look in his eyes for he's not alive
He will not answer as you plead for your life
You may possess wealth, you may possess fame
but in the end there's a price to be paid

It's the day of the reaper, it's the end of your life
It's the day of the reaper, face the light
It's the day of the reaper, it's the end of your life
It's the day of the reaper, face the light

You better beware, you better take care
there is no escape from the cold hands of fate
If you've been bad and I know that you have
the time has come to plead for your life

It's the day of the reaper, it's the end of your life
It's the day of the reaper, face the light
It's the day of the reaper, it's the end of your life
It's the day of the reaper, face the light
