Spirits of the wind guide my arrows
Spirits of the sun light my way
We are strong, we are brave
Let us live to fight another day

Stand with courage, stand with pride
rise all warriors, prepare to die
When the battle is over, smoke will rise
the blood that's spilled will not be mine

Indian nation, Indian nation, one day we'll be free
Indian nation, Indian nation, to live in harmony

White man came with guns and swords
Women and children taken by force
Took our land, but not our pride
No remorse, only lies

Indian nation, Indian nation, one day we'll be free
Indian nation, Indian nation, to live in harmony

Spirits of the wind, spirits of the sun
Spirits of the land, guide my arrows

Indian nation, Indian nation, one day we'll be free
Indian nation, Indian nation, to live in harmony
