In the midst of the never ending darkness
I stand and wait, watch the sun begin to fade
An evil place where hope is slowly dying
A sleepy village where fear and hatred reign

I've been waiting and I've been trying
There's no time to escape
From the black clouds of Thanos
There is no escape
Black clouds of Thanos
The death toll awaits
Black clouds of Thanos
Scenes flashing by
Black clouds of Thanos
It's your turn to die

He comes before you like an ordinary man
Hiding the truth and the nature of his plans
Look in the mirror, you'll see he's not aliveâ
And if you question it will be your turn to Die

I've been waiting and I've been trying
There's no time to escape
From the black clouds of Thanos
There is no escape
Black clouds of Thanos
The death toll awaits
Black clouds of Thanos
Scenes flashing by
Black clouds of Thanos
It's your turn to die

Look in the sky, see the night surround the sun
The end of days has finally arrived
Look in your heart and see the pain you've made
Maybe there's time for you to be saved

I've been waiting and I've been trying
There's no time to escape
From the black clouds of Thanos
There is no escape
Black clouds of Thanos
The death toll awaits
Black clouds of Thanos
Scenes flashing by
Black clouds of Thanos
It's your turn to die

The blackened skies
scream out your name
The heaven's cry
like and endless rain

What has begun
can never be changed
What has not died
will forever remain

And in the end
when all is gone
All that survives
will never die

What has begun
can never be changed
What has not died
will forever remain
