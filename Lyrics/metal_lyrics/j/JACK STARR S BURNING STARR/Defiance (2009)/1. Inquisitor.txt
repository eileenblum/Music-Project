In fourteen ninety two, Columbus sailed the ocean blue
But the hills in Spain were drenched in blood and holy pain
Torquemada led the fray, made sure he had his way
Infidels and non-believers like cattle he did slay

Down in the dungeons there'll be whippin' tonight
Accept Jesus and you'll be saved
Down in the dungeons there'll be whippin' tonight
Accept Jesus and you'll be saved

Inquisitor, what god did you serve
Inquisitor, what did you learn
Inquisitor, what did you say
when it was your turn to pay

Queen Isabella stood silent,
Priests and monks tortured and maimed
For the glory of God, the glory of God's good name
Madrid burned them at the stake,
All done for the church's sake
Confess your sins, or you'll burn in the fiery lake

Down in the dungeons there'll be whippin' tonight
Accept Jesus and you'll be saved
Down in the dungeons there'll be whippin' tonight
Accept Jesus and you'll be saved

Inquisitor, what god did you serve
Inquisitor, what did you learn
Inquisitor, what did you say
when it was your turn to pay

Down in the dungeons there'll be whippin' tonight
Accept Jesus and you'll be saved
Down in the dungeons there'll be whippin' tonight
Accept Jesus and you'll be saved

Inquisitor, what god did you serve
Inquisitor, what did you learn
Inquisitor, what did you say
when it was your turn to pay
