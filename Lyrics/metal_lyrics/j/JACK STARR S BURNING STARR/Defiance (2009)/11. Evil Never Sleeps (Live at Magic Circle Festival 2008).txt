Flashing lights the sound of rage
Anguish and Hate fill the air
A vicious circle a deadly maze
Enter the web if you dare

But there is no escape
For those who tempt fate
And you'll never know what
What Horror Awaits
A night on the Rack
A stab in the Back
No One is Safe

Evil Never Sleeps
Woe oh Evil Never Sleeps

A quiet Night, on an empty street
A madman walks out on his beat
A little girl in a pretty white dress
Behind her back the killing knife!

â But there is no escape for those who tempt fate
And you'll never know what horror awaits
A Night on the Rack
A stab in the Back
No One is safe
Evil Never Sleeps
woe woe Evil Never Sleeps
