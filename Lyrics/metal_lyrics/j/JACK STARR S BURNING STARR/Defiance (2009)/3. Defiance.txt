When the world has grown cold
and all have forsaken me
I will not falter, nor stray
I'll fight 'til the end
I'll never give in
as long as I live and I breathe
For I shall remain defiant
Defiant I will remain

When there's darkness around
no friends to be found
I will fight and I'll win
Like a night without end
steel does not bend
I will deliver us from evil

Oh oh let the cold wind blow
oh let the thunder roar
Oh oh let the cold wind glow
Oh let the thunder roar
I'll be defiant to the end
Until the day that I die

I'd rather fight than live on my knees
Now is my time to be free
Let them all stand aside
It's time that they learn
learn that the king has returned
Let the sword be my guide
to light up my way
this time they'll all have to pay

Oh oh let the cold wind blow
oh let the thunder roar
Oh oh let the cold wind glow
Oh let the thunder roar
I'll be defiant to the end
Until the day that I die

When there's darkness around
no friends to be found
I will fight and I'll win
Like a night without end
steel will not bend
I will deliver us from evil

Oh oh let the cold wind blow
oh let the thunder roar
Oh oh let the cold wind glow
Oh let the thunder roar
I'll be defiant to the end
Until the day that I die
