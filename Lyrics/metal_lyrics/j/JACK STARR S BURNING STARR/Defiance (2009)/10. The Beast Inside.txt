All my life I've been afraid
This thing burns inside
Lurking beneath my skin
Waiting for my strength to give in

Now the battle lines are drawn
The battle rages on
I'll fight until I die
or kill the beast inside

It's a curse I have to live with
Evil thing haunts my mind
Stripped away my defenses
No escape, it's there all the time

Now the battle lines are drawn
The battle rages on
I'll fight until I die
or kill the beast inside

A toxic poison that invades my thoughts
I cannot live with this beast inside
The time has come to end this nightmare
No matter what, the best will die
