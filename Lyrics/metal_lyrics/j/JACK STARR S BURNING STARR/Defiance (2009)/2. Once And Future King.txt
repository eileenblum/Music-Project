Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, as it is in heaven
The battles won, thy chosen son, lives on forever

We call upon the throne
the once and future king
The battles fought are known
and victories are owned

Across the sea I sail
my vow I will fulfill
Dreams I have forsaken
to find the lost throne

I can not, I will not, give up the right to be the king
I can not, I will not, forsake the crown that bears my name

There lies the castle
My lady of the lake
I'll have no other
until she is awake

I can not, I will not, give up the right to be the king
I can not, I will not, forsake the crown that bears my name

Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, as it is in heaven
The battles won, thy chosen son, lives on forever

Something stirs in the east
an evil heart that beats
A man born of satan
he fell into the heat

I can not, I will not, give up the right to be the king
I can not, I will not, forsake the crown that bears my name
