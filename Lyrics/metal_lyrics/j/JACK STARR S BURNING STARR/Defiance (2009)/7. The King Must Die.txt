The king is sitting on his throne
counting all his gold
unaware of danger nearby
The lord of the manor
sitting by his side
evil plans on his mind

And the ladies in waiting will wait forever more
Treason buried in lies
And all is not quiet on this dark unholy night
Tonight the king must die

The jester and the servants
conspire, plot and lie
At midnight one of them will try
The queen and her lover
meet like thieves in the night
waiting for the clock to strike

And the ladies in waiting will wait forever more
Treason buried in lies
And all is not quiet on this dark unholy night
Tonight the king must die

The king is sitting on his throne
counting all his gold
unaware of danger nearby
The lord of the manor
sitting by his side
evil plans on his mind

And the ladies in waiting will wait forever more
Treason buried in lies
And all is not quiet on this dark unholy night
Tonight the king must die
