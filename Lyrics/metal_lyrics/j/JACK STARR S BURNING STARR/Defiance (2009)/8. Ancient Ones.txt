Sit by my side, tell you a story
story of the ancient ones
Sit by the fire, listen to the tale
tale of the ancient ones

From an ancient time, a line divine
ruled the warrior kings
Blood and steel, a kingdom wrought
forged with honor and pride

With a chalice made of gold, crown upon their thrown
hail the mighty kings of old
The castle gates now closed, winds of fate blow cold
the legend lives as once foretold

Ancient ones, oh sacred ones, give us strength to carry on
Ancient ones, oh sacred ones, give us strength to carry on and on

Brothers in arms, sword and shield
defending the royal crown
Sworn to an oath, victory or death
save the helpless ones

Discipline, strength, honor and pride
the code of the ancient ones
Buried in time, the fight's not lost
their spirits live on

With a chalice made of gold, crown upon their thrown
hail the mighty kings of old
The castle gates now closed, winds of fate blow cold
the legend lives as once foretold

Ancient ones, oh sacred ones, give us strength to carry on
Ancient ones, oh sacred ones, give us strength to carry on and on
