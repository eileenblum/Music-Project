Looking deep into the love
Serenity is forever lost
Gazing deep into the flames
Burning triangles reign
Innocence is the sin of illusion
As nothing is what it seems
Blindindg clouds now move aside
I was only passing through

Now I see the ghosts of time
To where the stars fell
To where my Father dwells
To where my heart tells

Arise! The Serpent of power
Transform this hollow soul
Ascending secret fires
Let this kingdom come

Mother! Nothing I ask of you
My soul was never mine to keep
Destroy this life that I despise
I throw it all away

Mother! Born from your fires
Thundering forth illumination
Shining golden spheres of being
The road to perception

Breathing in the embers glow
Ride the tiger through the tides of blood
Eclipse the sun with my hands
See the world in its primal state

Conquering the world of senses
A dreamless sleep to see beyond this world
Secrets within the wailing moon
White faces there waiting for me
Silhouettes from the Great Abyss
Whispering unto me, whispering unto me

In chaos, endlessly spiralling
Words of love echo forever
Cosmic sky, crippled and falling
Always about to die

Mother! My soul is on fire
Blood inside my tears
In death, in blood, in dreams
The edge of time I see

Mother! My soul is on fire
Blood inside my tears
In death, in blood, in dreams
The edge of time I see

Mother! The worlds is on fire
Your voice shall sound the end
In death, in blood, in dreams
The face of love I see
