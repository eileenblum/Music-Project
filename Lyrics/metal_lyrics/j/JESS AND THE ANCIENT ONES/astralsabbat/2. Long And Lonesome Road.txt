[originally by Shocking Blue]On a Sunday night while driving my car
In the sky a fallin' star
Tellin' myself I don't go too far
And trust by the sound of the rain

[REFRAIN:]
Well I wonder, well I wonder where I am
'Cos there's a long and lonesome road
That will find our world of you &amp; me babe
There's a long and lonesome road
That will find our world like it used to be babe

Somebody there to show me the way
Yes, I'm willin' to pay
And this dear old man can tell me any day
Know what happens to me

[REFRAIN]
