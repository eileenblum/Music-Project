Oh, I have seen you before, youâve been wailing outside my door
Oh, I have seen you before, riding down on a lightning storm

Serpents dancing, they celebrate my death
The devil knocks upon my door,
I am no one, no need for a name
Offer me shelter from the rain

Howling death kept coming back
Gonna drag me through the fires

Hope and love still burn behind my eyes
Only misery I bring
Standing by you, drawn towards you dark
I feel my heart soon will drown

A graveyard kiss upon your lips, gonna drag me through the fires

Show me the worlds of freedom, the burning temples of will
Where all the flowers born to poison the poets mind
Your name is carved upon my skin, your voice burns inside my mind
And I am bleeding for your hands, bleeding for your love

Howling death please take me back, Iâm addicted to your fires
I want to kiss your graveyard lips, once more for the road
I am leaving before the dawn, so hold me for so long
I will disappear within the cosmic smoke

Teach me the worlds of freedom, spoken through our ages
Sing me your darkest melodies, come to me, come to me
Show me that all men must die, one thousand deaths
As they are bleeding for your hands, bleeding for your love

Howling death please take me back, Iâm addicted to your fires
I want to kiss your graveyard lips, once more for the road
I am leaving before the dawn, so hold me for so long
I will disappear within the cosmic smoke

Oh, I am going home, from the crossroads into the storm
Oh, I have been here before, I am gonna burn, burn, burn.
