Of death and hippie dreams, Hoffman's medicine
Your lingering acid tongue, keeps screaming unto me
And I know it's a wild ride, surf the veils of coloured death
When all the lights they call me home, the truth I know

This is a separate reality
A strangest kind of tomorrow
The face I wear is not my own
Howling, like the wolves inside my head

Loving stabbing hands, the carving knives of doom
Macabre femme fatale, the eyes of liquid smoke
Born of flowers and rainbows, a western cult of death
Radio Aquarius transcending all to see

This is a separate reality
A strangest kind of tomorrow
The face I wear is not my own
Howling, like the wolves inside my head

I will taste my mind's hysteria
I am tuning in and dropping out
I touch the hands of true inertia
I am the lost, I am to be found

This is a separate reality
A strangest kind of tomorrow
The face I wear is not my own
Howling, like the wolves inside my head

Oh Charlie darling
What have you done
