The Equinox death trip eats your mind
The Equinox death trip eats your mind
All things you must leave behind
All things you must leave behind

It burns like love that lives inside
An age old dream now canonized

The Equinox death trip haunts your mind
The Equinox death trip haunts your mind
All the things you fear await inside
All the things you fear await inside

Murder and chaos you will find
A total freedom of other kind
The fortune teller I have seen
At every crossroad I have been

The Equinox death trip burns your mind

The Equinox death trip fucks your mind
The Equinox death trip fucks your mind
All the things you love die inside
All the things you love die inside
