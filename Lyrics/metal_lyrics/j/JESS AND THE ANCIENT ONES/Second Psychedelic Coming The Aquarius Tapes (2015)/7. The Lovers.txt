I've got a secret to tell, I'm gonna share it with you and only you
Come say goodbye and I whisper it to you
You're all dead, you're all dead so deep inside,
And the words you spread, all are lies.

I am a river
A flowing stream of burning love

I give you all my heart, I share my shining inner self
Come wave goodbye and I remember you
Yes I'll be there, I'll be there where all others fade
Through this acid maze, I drag us out.

Let there be no love lost in loving arms
Let all the things I do grow unto you
Let there be on lies within the lovers eye
Let all the things I say explode in your heart.

Don't look back, don't look back we'll turn to stone
Burning red, burning red the screaming death
No love lost, no love lost, a paradise
Don't look back, don't look back we'll turn to stone.

Let there be no love lost in loving arms
Let all things I do grow unto you
Let there be no lies within the lovers eyes
Let all the things I say explode in your heart.

Let all the things I say explode inside your burning heart!
