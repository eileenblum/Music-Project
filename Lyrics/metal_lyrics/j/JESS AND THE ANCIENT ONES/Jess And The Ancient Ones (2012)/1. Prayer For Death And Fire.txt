Hear me, oh lord of the grave mounds
Your voice is chaos and cosmic fire
These buried dreams are calling on
From eternityâs infinity manifest

Gates of sleep now rust away
Break the mirrors that led astray

Lightnings bring memories
What was will always be

Oh hear my prayer for death and fire
Love, lust and desire
Oh burning black sonic fire
Love, lust and desire

See me, oh shadows of Cain
Your eyes burn through my soul
Turn these dreams into flesh
From the abyss, now manifest

Oh hear my prayer for death and fire
Love, lust and desire
Oh burning black sonic fire
Love, lust and desire

Gates of sleep now rust away
Break the mirrors that led astray

I remember the gardens of blazing fires
Seven sermons for the dead
I remember the shining flowers of gold
No secrets in the house of souls

I remember the silence so deep
Seven prayers for the dead
I remember, oh I remember now
No secrets in the house of souls

Oh hear my prayer for death and fire
Love, lust and desire
Oh burning black sonic fire
Love, lust and desire
