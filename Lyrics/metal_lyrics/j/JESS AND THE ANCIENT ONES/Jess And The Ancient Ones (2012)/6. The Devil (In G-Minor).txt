Burning heat, burning low
Fires burning within my soul
I crossed them roads, oh I crossed them roads

Shadows in the wind, shadows on the wall
The Devil I cry, the Devil I call
I close my eyes, oh I close my eyes

The Devil I see
The Devil I know
Seven are we
The Devil we see
The Devil I see
The Devil I know
Seven are we and the Devil we see

Burning heat, burning low
Fires raging within my soul
Forever I wait, forever I cry

The Devil I see
The Devil I know
Seven are we
The Devil we see
The Devil I see
The Devil I know
Seven are we and the Devil we see
