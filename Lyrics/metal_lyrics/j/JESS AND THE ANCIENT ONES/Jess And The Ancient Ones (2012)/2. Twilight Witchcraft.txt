Hear this call of mine
Echo through space and time
Oh Reaper, the grim king
Sinister powers bring

Spread wings black as night
Darken this journey, black alchemy
Like fallen angels, you and I
One day we will fly above the lonely skies

Oh Lord Death
Release my soul
Show me the aeons
Only you know

Oh Lord Death
Release my soul
Together with twilight shadows
From your cold grip never let me go

Angel by my side
Always by my side
Black angel by my side
Always by my side

Oh Lord Death
Release my soul
Show me the aeons
Only you know

Oh Lord Death
Release my soul
Together with twilight shadows
From your cold grip never let me go

One day you'll take my hand
And whisper your name to me, I'll understand
How I long to meet the end
To start anew with my mysterious friend

An angel by my side
Always by my side
Black angel by my side
Always by my side

Oh Angel
Guide my soul
Take me to aeons
Only you know

Oh Angel
Take my soul
Beyond this life's shadows we'll go

When your scythe cuts loose
This body from the soul
The wandering spirit shall remain
With you I'll journey so far away
