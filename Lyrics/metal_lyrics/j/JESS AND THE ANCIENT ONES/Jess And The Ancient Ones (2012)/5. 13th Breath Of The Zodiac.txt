Ascending house of the Serpent's Holder
a beginning in the end of the time

Far beyond you reach your arms
Stand upon the tail of Scorpius
Stellar winds carry Thy call
Across the planes forever more

Dire burning eyes lit up in flames
a total eclipse of the stars
Subconscious daemons entwine
With and without, together as one

From the shadows you have come
To stand across the path of the Sun
Everlasting secrets that you keep
Revealed for those with the will to seek

Embrace the loving kiss
A cosmic breath of resurrection
Reach the dead in their tombs
Invite them back to your womb

From the shadows you have come
To stand across the path of the sun
Everlasting secrets that you keep
Revealed for those who dare to seek

In the gardens of dark matter
The serpents coil and twist
As they bind their tails
Around the eternal pillars

From the shadows you have come
To stand across the path of the sun
Everlasting secrets that you keep
Revealed for those who dare to seek
