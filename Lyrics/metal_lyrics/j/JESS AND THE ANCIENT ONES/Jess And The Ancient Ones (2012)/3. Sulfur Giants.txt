I can't see the light
I can't see the morning bright never again, oh no
Only shadows in the soul caravan, travelling astral
From this waste that I created again, and again, and again
From this waste I throw myself away

Oh I wish I'd never been born
Never been taken away
I will find my place
Sulfur Giants lead the way

The touch of their lips
Lifts me above the blind and the weak when everything falls
The sound of their voice
Thunderous like a thousand lightnings

Oh I wish I'd never been born
Never been taken away
I will find my place
Sulfur Giants lead the way

I hold my heart in my hands
As they wash me with their burning fires

Oh I wish I'd never been born
Never been taken away
I will find my place
Sulfur Giants lead the way

Into the twilights unknown

Awake me from this sleep
This sleep is rapture where the divine fade away
Where you and I will be laid to a waste again and again
Break this cycle when I drown myself in your embrace
Take my heart and drown me in your arms

Oh I wish I'd never been born
Never been taken away
I hold my heart in my hands
Sulfur Giants understand

Oh I wish I'd never been born
Never been taken away
Life I once dreamed before
Sulfur Giants forevermore

Into the twilights unknown
