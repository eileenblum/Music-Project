Come dawn of the flames
Ghost riders, we await
Come, ride through the gates
Ghost riders, we await

Through the gates of the silver key
These words turn into darkest dreams
Black revelations, the face of god
Where have all the ghost riders gone

In the gnostic fires you burn and are reborn
We are gonna miss you all, eternally

A thousand eyes will open again, infinity
Through the gates of the golden key

Come dawn of the flames
Ghost riders, we await
Come, ride through the gates
Ghost riders, we await

In the gnostic fires you burn and are reborn
We are gonna miss you all, eternally

A vision brighter than a thousand stars
Dancing ghosts within the cosmic flood
Reflecting the shadows of demigod

Tides of catharsis coming forth
Esoteric gnosis, Telos within

Come dawn of the flames
Ghost riders, we await
Come, ride through the gates
Ghost riders, we await
