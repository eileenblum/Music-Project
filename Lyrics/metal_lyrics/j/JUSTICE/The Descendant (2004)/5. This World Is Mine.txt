Strong metal that surrounds me
A thousand feet down below
Brilliant brains in strategic games
And I am the host of the show

Rise the curtain sing my song
And dance to my cruel melody
The call for peace is the hymn of the weak
Miserable tunes in my ears

You're deaf, dumb, blind
You waste my time
Cause I decide
I won't wait no more so

Raise your fist to heaven
You are marching off to die
War's the only way to peace
This life is yours but this world - is mine
This world is mine

After this bittersweet taste of my might
There's only silence around
Don't you dare to say any word
Just got permission to think what you want

My life's too short to reach for the stars
I know some day my time will come
Still I reign my democratic dictatorship
For this time history will be done

You're deaf, dumb, blind
You waste my time
Cause i decide
I won't wait no more so

Raise your fist to heaven
You are marching off to war
Praise my name and play my game
And those who do not follow i ignore
Forget what you've been taught
Cause i'm the one who's right
War's the only way to peace
This life is yours but this world - is mine

This world is mine
This fuckin' world is mine
Only mine
