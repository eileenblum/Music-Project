Pure black surrounding me, my eyes opened wide
The time has come to leave this ordinary life
Your call from down below, thy will shall be done
Young blood to reign in fear, like father like son

Hear my call, pass the gates
Feel my warm embrace, take your father's place
Leave the world, you will learn
Merciless regime, honor to redeem

Darkest visions, coming true
Eternal plagues wait for you
A voice in my mind, imagination or real
(The descendant) 
Something inside confusing my conciousness
You're the descendant
Heir to the throne, receiving the burning crown
(The descendant) 
The future of hades
You're the descendant

The heritage of hell, the fallen angel's son
Two thousand years of doom, I will overcome
My father, you're too weak, now I'm in command
The emperor of hate, they'll suffer until the end

Leave the world, you will learn
Merciless regime, honor to redeem
Hear my call, pass the gates
Take your father's place, receive your father's mace

Darkest visions, coming true
Eternal plagues wait for you

A voice in my mind, imagination or real
(The descendant) 
Something inside confusing my conciousness
You're the descendant
Heir to the throne, receiving the burning crown
(The descendant) 
The future of hades, black hope of all non-believers
You're the descendant
