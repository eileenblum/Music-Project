I can't believe all the things that you do
Don't start living
Turn on the TV, await something new
Give it to me
Switch off your brain, let the pictures flow on
Hypnotizing
Flickering reality
While your own life is left undone

[CHORUS:]
YOU HEAR, YOU FEEL, 
YOU SMELL, YOU SEE, 
YOU TALK, YOU THINK
MY FRIEND, YOU DIE YOUR LIFE

I can't believe all the things that you say
Don't start stumbling
Got no intention or sense anyway
Fool on duty
Degenerated disciples of lies
Don't ask questions
Keep on believing
What you see is always true and right

[CHORUS]

You die your life
Manipulated, poor existence with no aim
You die your life
Isolated mass, obedient and tame
You die your life
The ultimate religion spreading true belief
You die your life
A slave to media, the makers leave you blinded and deceived
