Start up the engines when the sun goes down
Still feel the heat around
A perfect fusion made of man and machine
All systems checked, the orders clear
At last all doubts have disappeared
Among the smell of sweat and gasoline

In here to be, just you and me
Together we will fight the abstract enemy

I draw the lines into the sky
With best regards, it's time to die
So get prepared and kiss your ass goodbye

[CHORUS:]
Eyes of the world - follow the action
Watch every move - war tv
Out in the fields - be my companion
Whipe out them all - war tv

My missiles hit the target, exactly done my work
Mission accomplished as the fires blaze
No fake, it's life what you have seen
Now pan the camera right to me
So that the world can see the smile on my face

Gunfire, we're hit, pure blood i spit
The bastards cracked us up, we're going down

They drew a line into the sky
With best regards, it's time to die
I get prepared and kiss my ass goodbye

[CHORUS]

Hello, it's me back on the screen, do you remember me
They broke my will, i'm not the heroe anymore
Whatever they will do to me, they're gonna do it slowly
This ain't the picture you've been waiting for

Down on my knees, your gun released
World's on location when they blow away my head

With best regards, it's time to die
Stay tuned and see another try
Of entertainment on your war tv

[CHORUS]
