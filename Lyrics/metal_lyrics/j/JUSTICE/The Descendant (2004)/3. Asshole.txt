Friendship seems to be a foreign word for you
Every second somebody gets hurt
You rape their feelings every time you're around
You make a hush of every smile next to you

Because you're an asshole, so don't waste my time
You're just an asshole, you don't change my mind

Pray for salvation on earth 
Admit the mistakes you made 
And then show remorse
Pray for salvation but redemption is far 
This is a warning, don't forget who you are

You've got a violent temper, wailing about your life
Every time it's the others fault
When you are screaming your inner self appears
You're just jealous of the others' pride

Because you're an asshole, so don't waste my time
You're just an asshole, you don't change my mind

You can't change my mind
