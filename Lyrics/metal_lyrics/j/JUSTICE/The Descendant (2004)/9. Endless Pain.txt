I am the one who's near beside you
When night devoures day
Just wait a few more hours
Your life will fade away
You thought that life could last forever
What a fatal fallacy
Confronted with your unknown inner self
I lead you to your destiny

I'm closer than your skin, the enemy within
Flowing through your veins into your brain
Devastating all I get you under my control
I will cause you sneaking endless pain
Endless pain

What would you pay to sleep just for a moment
To get a rest from being scared
I will not leave, I blur your every senses
I hit you when you're unprepared
When I behold the fear within your eyes
It fills my soul with lust
I know the pounding of your poor heart
Is gonna end up in the dust

I'm closer than your skin, the enemy within
Flowing through your veins into your brain
Devastating all I get you under my control
I will cause you sneaking endless pain
Endless pain

Now that your pulse is growing faster
You feel that I'm so close
That rushing in your ears, I love it
Adrenaline overdose
Your shivering body, your staring eyes
Sweat running down your spine
To realize that you are me
Total collapse of your mind

I'm closer than your skin, the enemy within
Flowing through your veins into your brain
Devastating all you're getting just out of control
Together we enjoy your endless pain
Endless pain
