Up from the ashes we're rising, we're back on our feet
Menacing thunders are roaring, we're roaming the streets
The new experience you made is digging your mind
Surrender to us, leave the past behind

[CHORUS:]
Here's the New Machine
We are your machine

Doomsday is near, there's no place to run or hide
We're devastating, got no glory, got no pride
Blasting through your ears with power and might
No reason to defend, just join our fight

[CHORUS]

Back on the streets, running out of control
Mind eating beats will conquer your soul

Up from the ashes and back on the feet
The thunder is roaring, we're roaming the streets 
Don't take us too serious, we don't even do
The power is with us, but we're never true... 

[CHORUS]
