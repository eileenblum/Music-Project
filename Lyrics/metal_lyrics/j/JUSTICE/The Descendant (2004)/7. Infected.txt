Take the cattle, chicken, pigs
Feed them with a bonemeal mix
How wonderful their eyes begin to roll
Bizarre dance on the funny farm
Hole brained beef won't do no harm
What does a cow a brain need for at all

You are the top of everything, the crown of evolution
You call yourself the masterplan, but mankind is pollution
It's funny how you always try to keep yourself protected
I start the epidemic, now and get the whole wide world
Infected! 

Take the incomplete creation
Eliminate abomination
You are perfect and so the world should be
You tinker at what you don't like
To solve what's hidden deep inside
A hail to cosmetic surgery

You are the top of everything, the crown of evolution
You call yourself the masterplan, but mankind is pollution
It's funny how you always try to keep yourself protected
I start the epidemic, now and get the whole wide world
Infected! 

Take off, make the space your own
Calculate your way back home
Through the journey I'll be by your side
And if you dare to find a place
To haunt and finally to waste
I start the epidemic then
And get the whole wide universe
Infected!!!
