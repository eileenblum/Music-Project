Dwelling on memories 
Drowning in sorrow, bothering you 
From inside they're crawling 
(The) Anger you can't hide 

Pale-faced mindclones 

Imprisoned dignity 
Infected sanity 

Rotten egos 
Rotten to the core 

Cold isolation 
The last resort that keeps you breathing 
Just guided by instincts 
Aware of cunning penetration 

No one's servant 

Solid dignity 
Healed insanity
