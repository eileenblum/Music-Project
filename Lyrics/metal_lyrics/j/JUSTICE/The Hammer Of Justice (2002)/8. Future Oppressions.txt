My life is changing so fast, I can't explain 
I know what it's all about, nothing seems the same 
A look at my past life, than drying all my tears 
Passing the gate, this is the hour of our fears 

Waiting my whole life, why should I take care 
No one is waiting, do I have to be there ? 
Leaders of our time, just standing behind 
Fighting a war, I can't ignore 

Future oppressions 

Forgotten, displaced, designed from a thought 
Now my last hope, I'm praying to god 
What is behind this imaginary wall ? 
What is behind it ? I don't know at all 

Future oppressions becoming more clear 
This is a warning, so you must take heed 
Watching and waiting, how deep I descend 
Is there deliverance in the end?
