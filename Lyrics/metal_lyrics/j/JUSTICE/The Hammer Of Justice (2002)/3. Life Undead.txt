Welcome to a beautiful nightmare 
You can't escape, 'cause it's reality 
Marching through a wasted land 
Dead bodies pave the way you walk 

Seeking the unknown 
Once again you kill the nameless one 
Waiting for the next command 
Just another bloody massacre 

I once was your victim 
You splattered my brain 
With violent oppression 
I now will return 

Back from the grave 
Live undead 
Evil reborn 
Live undead 

Meet me in a moonless night 
I suck your blood and eat your entrails 
Feasting on your lifeless corpse 
I gnaw the meat off the god damn bones 

Though it may seem a little late 
I enjoy the bitter sweet taste 
Of dissipated revenge
