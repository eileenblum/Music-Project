Another usual day in your life 
There you sit and wait to finish work 
Imaginations of subhuman kind 
But no one sees through you and your secret within 

As you knock on the door 
Your blood starts to boil 
Enjoy the pain, you want more 
And you will never recoil 

Bow down, now 
Obey 
Show obsequiousness 

Remote controlled you stalk through the streets 
As you know your aim, and your aim is the pain 
Bondage gear and the lady in black 
And when you feel the whip, it's like heaven on earth 

As you knock on the door 
Your blood starts to boil 
Enjoy the pain, you want more 
And you will never recoil 

Bow down, now 
Obey 
Show obsequiousness
