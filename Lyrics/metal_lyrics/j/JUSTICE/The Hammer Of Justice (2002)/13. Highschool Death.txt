Get up at the usual time 
Packed bag in the corner of the room 
Breakfast - the day`s starting well 
Rushing in by the ringing of the bell 

Now my time has come 
And my job has to be done 
Don`t move, it won`t help you anyway 
Get ready for my judgement day 

Highschool death 

Bullets flying through the classroom 
Ripping virginal flesh from the bone 
Blood spills from the teacher`s head 
He tortured me and now he`s dead 

Outside the parents cry 
Cops are waiting to come in 
Kids are screaming, trying to run away 
This is my private judgement day 

Highschool death
