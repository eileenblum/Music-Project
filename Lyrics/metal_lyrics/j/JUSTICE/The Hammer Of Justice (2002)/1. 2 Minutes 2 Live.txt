Leaving the club, 8 beers swallowed 
Staggering straight to your car 
Don't waste no thought on your recklessness 
Knowing your home is not far 

Starting the engine, shift to first gear 
Invulnerable you are 
Gaining speed with every second 
You are the highway star 

Run - faster 

Taking the corner devil-style 
Finally risking it all 
Tires are losing the grip on wet leaf 
Clenching the wheel as you skid 

The engine's roaring one last time 
You're watching the tree coming near 
Never been afraid of dying 
Pain is your only fear 

As the blood runs 
Out of your countless wounds 
You realize, you'll die 

Live fast 
Die young 
You just got 2 minutes to live 

Cut off leg, broken arms 
Trapped in your wrecked pile of steel 
Percieving that you are unable to move 
Pinned behind the wheel 

Still conscious, massive pain 
Watching your live passing by 
Even if help comes, it will be too late 
Make yourself ready to die
