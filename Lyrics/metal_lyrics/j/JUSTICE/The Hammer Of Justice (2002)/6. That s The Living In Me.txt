Suddenly, I found myself 
Running out of lies, running out of excuses 
Here I stand, no apologies 
What else can I give 
To cover the betrayal 

That's the living in me 

Suddenly the truth is staring 
At my face, your face, his face 
Can't go on with this shit 
Running out of time, 
Got no time to lose 

Here I'm standing, got no ideas 
The truth, they say, will never come 
Here I'm standing, got no stories 
The fairy tale has just begun 

I leave you now, with another lie 
As I always pretend, I am here 
Right back to where it all began 
Another circle ends 
Another broken heart
