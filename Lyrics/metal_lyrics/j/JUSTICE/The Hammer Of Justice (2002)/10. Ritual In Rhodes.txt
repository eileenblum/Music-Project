Thursday morning 6 a.m. 
Waiting for the only train 
For my girl a kiss-goodbye 
Tell her there`s no need to cry 

Get off the train, into the plane 
Flying to the sun 
Hot like hell, great hotel 
Longing for some fun 

Primal mission pool-bar-check 
Alcohol shall break the neck 
Both barmen look like suckers 
Just one word: motherfuckers 

Madness surrounds, 
hitting the town 
Just some tourist stores 
Back to the hotel, 
a few more drinks 
Next days will bring more 

Poolbar drinks for free 
Sunna macht mi hie 
Morning fart shall blow 
Ritual in Rhodes 

Wake up with the morning shine 
Just to miss the breakfast time 
Sandwiches and coffee, white 
All inclusive - that`s alright 

Down on the beach, 
sun is unleashed 
Skin is turning red 
Back to the poolbar, a lot of drinks 
Make us sleep like dead 

Poolbar free drinks kick 
Sun just makes me sick 
Morning fart still blows 
Ritual in Rhodes 

Rent some Harleys hit the road 
Cruising all along the coast 
Sun is burning from above 
All that`s left is one red scarf 

Center-court calls, just some old balls 
Afternoon sun on our skin 
Jump in the pool, 
swim around the bar 
Having a few more drinks 

Poolbar-keepers suck 
Never playing rock 
Hate inside us grows 
Ritual in Rhodes 

Disco overdose 
Ritual in Rhodes 
Morning fart still blows 
Ritual in Rhodes
