I found myself today 
Trapped in this bed 
My hands tied, feet tied 
A hole in my head 

Nothing left inside my brain 
I don't even know my name 

I feel, I see, I smell 
This is my living hell 
What did I do, why am I here 
No answers 

What would you do, 
When all you knew is dead and gone? 
You look around 
What you see makes no sense 
Feeling strange 
You realize, you had a total blackout! 

I am still lying on this plank bed here 
My inner self filled up with fear 

A spark of memories 
Becomes a flame 
A syringe needle in my vein 

Three tubes - liquid - that hose 
The end seems very close 

I woke up for my own execution 

I can't believe that 
I will soon be dead and gone 
The drugs work, make me weak 
Make me dead 
Feeling tired 
I realize, I'll have a total blackout!
