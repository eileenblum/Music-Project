Lines in the sand
Evoking the ego
Obey and
Surrender to your king

Under this land
Now naked you go
Leave your withstanding
Ears to hear your king

Old ancient beliefs, dominations
Fulfilled being, egocentric fascination
You need their admiration
I'm Ra your God.
The behavior exhibition
That's the way when you rule your nation
Moving people in this incarnation
Indestructible, Ra, your God.

I'm the source of
All your life
Ruling you from
From the sky
The beginning
Of all existence.

Akers guarding
Sunrise and sunset
When I'm traveling
Across the sky

The trust in yourself, the causation
You Sun's son you are the inspiration
For all of us in this creation
I'm Ra your God.
To these people, you are their adoration
Reflecting splendor in ovation
Magnificence in acclamation
Indestructible, Ra, your God.

I'm the source of
All your life
Ruling you from
From the sky
The beginning
Of all existence.

I am power, I am will
I'm the voice that makes you thrill
I'm your hero, fighting every day.
