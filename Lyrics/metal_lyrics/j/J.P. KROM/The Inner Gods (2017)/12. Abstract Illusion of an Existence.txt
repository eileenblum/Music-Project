Never easy to understand
Enchanted by an illusion
Pacific now here you stand
'Til insanity comes again

Unreal, brought not from this land
Nothingness in this confusion
Endlessly united you stand
Perceived in this everything

Touching
Feeling
Coming
Arriving when I die

Trusting
Feeling
Nothing
Arriving from the sky
The soul when I die

A charming woman, angel face
With her art all made of thoughts
Lost in intellectual space
And she feels there's something else

Intuition is your trace
This reality, just a part
Moved to leave this cold place
This is not real as you say

Touching
Feeling
Coming
Arriving when I die

Trusting
Feeling
Nothing
Arriving from the sky
The soul when I die

A fantasy that never dies
A perception you can't feel
Coming through these deep sea eyes
Not here, not there, not now
