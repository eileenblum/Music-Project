Mars feeds my soul
A constant, rebellious fan, daily bloody war
Rising from deep hell
Slaying forever more
A broken red gun, silence in this world
Rig out, there's peace no more

Inside of every heart
Enslaved to this fight
Senses torn apart
Maniac staring sight

Arts of the sword
Red power in the core
Seek for your own lord
You'll find the peace no more

No more! No more!

Bleed for me when you fight against this world
When you give your life for a true belief
Bleed for me with your thousand tears of blood
When you give yourself a true option of life

March twelfth dies hard
Almost kills the heart
Ruled from the start
Since it made the scar

More spilled blood
Arriving from above
Regret nothing at all
You'll find peace no more

Sacrificing against your will
Making you blind, dumb
Telling what you feel
They won't destroy me at all
