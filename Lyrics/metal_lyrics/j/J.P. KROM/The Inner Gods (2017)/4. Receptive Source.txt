Mother now I'm part
Of what you are
On awakening
Not reasoning

Mother's transcendence
Of what I am
On deepening
Not fleeting

Came from this warm container
And care has been taken
Nothing as this love of mother
Created in haven

Empathize and understand
Realize of importance
Of passivity and stand
Won't you feel it?

Take me to the land
Where you are
All my childhood is
There right now
Renewing strength
Passing by
Emotions for life

Mother you're my source
Of happiness
Omnipresent
Not unpleasant

Mother our home
Of memories
Overjoyed
Nonce enjoyed

Load from this warm container
It's care has been taken
Love of mother, like no other
In our haven

Empathize and understand
Realize of importance
Of passivity and stand
Won't you feel it?

When you cry alone at night
When you feel you lost this fight
Feel her arms, they're holding you
With eternal love, forever
