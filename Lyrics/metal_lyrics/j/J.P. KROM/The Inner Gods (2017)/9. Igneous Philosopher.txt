Searching for the answers
A philosopher arrives
Goes praying and looking
In the very depths of life

Talking about expression in
This repressed relief
A hermit priest for your
Rusted spiritual beliefs

I love my freedom
Usually restricted
Souls of my freedom
Joyous

Universal knowledge
Predicted, resisted
In depth analyzed
To the core

Enter the ambivalence
Ruled by these two natives
Going through ambivalence
Or the expansion of the psyche

So do you need to be free?
Or just to be adapted?
Possibly is your
High ego
Indeed
Attracted
