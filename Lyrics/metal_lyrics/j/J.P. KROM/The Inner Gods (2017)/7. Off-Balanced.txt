Lady all the time
I was here with you
Bed of thorns in this
Remiss relationship

Again all the time
Vowing here with you
Enemy of bliss
Nowadays is what you are

Umbrage and our intolerance
Same face for everyone
Are you looking for a new balance?
You're my enemy and my friend

Satisfying two or more
Opposing opinions
You are avoiding conflict
In each relationship

Lover of beautiful things
That you can feel
Initiate things that they
Think they already did

Umbrage and â¦

And it is obvious that you will
Feel frustration and pain
If you don't renounce to your will
A person can be all for the other

You need the other to understand yourself
So you know what kind of person you are
You live close to this plastic material world
Are you able to cherish a painful art?

Umbrage and our intolerance
Same face for everyone
Are you looking for a new balance?
We're the couple off- balanced!
