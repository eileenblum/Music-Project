Poison from her sharp tongue
Languid your will goes on and on

Uncensored perverted thoughts in his
Tempted mind, she knows your bloody thoughts

Ongoing silent messages
Sexual torture, sweating blood

Captive of her mysterious look
Obscure eyes that read your mind and soul

Raw power inside your head
Penetrating your being 'til death
I will serve
Orgasm from your pain
