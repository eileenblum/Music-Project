Venus calling from above
Endless daydream
Nothing wrong
Ubiquitous woman dress this song
Strengthening erotic
Taurus love

A sexy muse dancing in the hall
Unison with the music's my soul
Rhythms from many pleasures crawl
Underneath her clothes
Soaring I'm going to lose control, oh no

Knock me again
Artifice of sex, forever
Re-educate my sense

Lipstick red I'm fain
Abate my thirst wherever
Know I've got no defense

Rocket my queen, my brain
Once your sensual reign
Moves my suspense

Killing my pain
Abstain do never ever
Keep out common sense
Goddess Aphrodite

Aphrodite, Goddess mighty
Drug my psyche, take me highly

So female and so strong erotic energy,
Mesmerize me over and over again,
The smell I like on your skin is following me everywhere
My deepest libidinous dreams are yoursâ¦
