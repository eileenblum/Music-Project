Vassal of details stop thinking
Inside your head positivism
Realm of criticizing
Get a good new filtering

Obey my efficiency
Can't be deficiency
Heal this soul wounded
I'm ill 'til my death
Realizes

On your caution learned before
Not a good boss of your chore
So self-demanding you bore
As you do with all of yours

Obey my efficiency
Can't be deficiency
Heal this soul wounded
I'm ill 'til my death
Realizes

I'm ill 'til my
'Til my death realizes

You never fake what you are
You never live as a star
Self-criticism stop
Your self-analysis has no top

Critical mind, does the perfection exist?
As you know, all in this world tend
To infinite chaos
As you do
