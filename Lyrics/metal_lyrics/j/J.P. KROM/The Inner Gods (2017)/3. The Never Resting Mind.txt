Mind why don't you give me some time?
Emptiness is what I need
Restless brain this is a crime
Careworn I am going to bleed

Urge on your
Mind, you are useful, never blind
Roaming without a thorned creed
Your knowledge, there's nothing behind
Give me back my wings and

Enlighten me first
Move your static mind
Intelligence dispersed
Nothing new within
Inner noise thirst
Here I feel the grind
Empower your soul first

Roaming world
Moving fast
Excellent
Saying words

Mind why don't you give me any time?
Erase yourself one moment now
Reminiscences undefined
Cut across, don't cover all I know

Uptime thinking exceeded fest
Ruthless demanding psyche sow
You're going to kill me, my guest
Give me back my wings and
Enlighten me first
Move your static mind
Intelligence dispersed
Nothing new within
Inner noise thirst
Here I feel the grind
Empower your soul first

Roaming world
Moving fast
Excellent
Saying words

Hermes running fast as light
Entrance to many knowledge
Roan horse free without a knight
Mad when he's on the last hard edge
ER filled with endless nights
Soaring thinking leaving through my eyes

When the mutable being feels
When the Kerykeion travels
Mercury's here with new deals
Is the air atheist positive?

Mind why don't you give me some time?
Why don't you give me some rest?
Is this abstract level a climb?
Through my swiftness there's no
Time why are you always in my mind?
Restrain these thoughts and realign
Intellectual research is your sign
I am a changing being and

Enlighten me firstâ¦
