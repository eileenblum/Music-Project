In this place I live
Photograph reality,
Dragging through my black'n'white existence.

I stay deaf to the shit
Things you say I melt in heat
I can show my ultimate resistance to this world.

I ain't no joke, no fake
I'm here to put your life at stake
Your god has never been more pitiless.
I ain't no fake, no joke
So many souls were baked and smoked
And the nature's aspiration
Drowns in my chemicals

Light up
My deadly pipe
Puff a cloud
Discharge the poison into
Sky, ground,
Into your wounds,
Into blood, into heart,
Into exterior

Right into you

Intoxicated ages through
Mephitic stench
Exuded up to heaven too.
Mankind escaped the nether world.
It will retrace its steps
I have no doubts
The threat to the
Universe
Dangerous, continuous
We won't ever
Save ourselves.
So much effort
Was wasted away

Light up
My deadly pipe
Puff a cloud
Discharge the poison into
Sky, ground,
Into your wounds,
Into blood, into heart,
Into exterior

I came to demolish, to alterâ¦
I came to demolish, to alterâ¦

I don't need to live in diversity
I just wanna grab what you've got for me
In this inside argosy
I don't need to live in diversity
I just wanna grab what you've got for me
In this inside argosy
I don't need to live in diversity
I just wanna grab what you've got for me

I drain this world to the bone
It doesn't mean anything at allâ¦
I drain this world to the bone
It doesn't mean anything at allâ¦
I drain this world to the bone
It doesn't mean anything at allâ¦
I drain this world to the bone
