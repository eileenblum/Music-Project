[Verse]
We do what we have been trained to
Hopeless beggars, dance to this beatific flute
If there's a Lord out there, he's just a guest
Under this dome of ignorance
Our boat is called Apocalypse
Who's in front of us we cut them deep
Yet untold, still unheard
We cherished lives to the underworld

[Chorus]
King of everything
King of everything
King of everything
Who's your king of everything?
King of everything
King of everything
King of everything
Who's your king of everything?
Who's your king of everything?
Oh, king, king of everything, yeah

[Outro]
Da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da
Mmm da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-di
Da-da-da-da-da, ooh
King, king of everything
Hopeless beggars, dance to this beatific flute, oh
