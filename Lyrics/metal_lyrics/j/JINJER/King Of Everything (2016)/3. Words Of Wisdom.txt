[Verse 1 â Tatiana]
Word is a gift
Word is a sword
Word is a gun always ready for war
Mistakenly taken, gracefully faken
A hill of shit is played off as a stack of gold
Filtered through restrictions
Destilled passive perception
My words of wisdom
Go in one ear and out the other

[Chorus]
Yet untold, still unheard
A shield built against warning and alert
Yet untold, still unheard
A shield built against warning and alert
[Bridge]
For consciousness never bothered
For the minds never taught to listen
My words of wisdom
Go in one ear and out the other

[Verse 2 â Tatiana]
Like cattle chew your grass
Of recreating advertising
Ears are deaf, not customized
To what is meaningful and wise
Sleeping notion lies unconscious under absurd lullaby
It's time I wake it up with a bullet of
Words of wisdom in my mind

[Chorus]
Yet untold, still unheard
A shield built against warning and alert
Yet untold, still unheard
A shield built against warning and alert

[Bridge]
For consciousness never bothered
For the minds never taught to listen
My words of wisdom
Go in one ear and out the other
