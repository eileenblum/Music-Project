[Verse 1]
Under this dome of ignorance
Men shalt all live as one
Wisdom lost its significance
For the sake of the holy scum
Joyfully Plebs wish for his bliss
That blindness, that barbarity
The empty idol will grin and hiss
Knee down free your insanity

[Chorus]
Bury the sparkle of thought
Submerge in the oblivion
Abandon all knowledge to rot
Accept my dominion
A new era of lies has begun
Listen, the bell tolls
Fake messiahs to come
So eagerly crowd calls
Under this dome of Indolence
Sloth infecting the mind
No one will show their dissidence
These fetters they cannot unwind
Childhood begins with conversion
Young scions are given no will
Their roots set deep in perversion
Of truth from this false beacon hill

[Verse 2]
Under this dome of stupidity
Cassocks teach to forgive
With hearts full of rigidity
Hoods only aim to deceive
These malevolent cowls
Red of blood and filth
There's no compassion, no truth
When empty idols urge to kill

[Chorus]
Bury the sparkle of thought
Submerge in the oblivion
Abandon all knowledge to rot
Accept my dominion
A new era of lies has begun
Listen, the bell tolls
Fake messiahs to come
So eagerly crowd calls

Under this dome of Indolence
Sloth infecting the mind
No one will show their dissidence
These fetters they cannot unwind
Childhood begins with conversion
Young scions are given no will
Their roots set deep in perversion
Of truth from this false beacon hill
