[Verse 1]
We do what we have been trained to
Hopeless beggars, dance to this beatific flute
If there's a Lord out there, he's just a guest
Under this dome of ignorance
Our boat is called Apocalypse
Who's in front of us we cut them deep
Yet untold, still unheard
We cherished lives to the underworld

[Chorus]
King of everything
King of everything
King of everything
King of everything

[Verse 2]
We do what we have been trained to
Hopeless beggars, dance to this beatific flute
If there's Lord out there, he's just a guest
Under this dome of ignorance

[Chorus]
King of everything
King of everything
King of everything
King of everything
