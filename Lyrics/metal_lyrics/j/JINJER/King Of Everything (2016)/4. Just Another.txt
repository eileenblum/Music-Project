[Chorus]
Just another bruise earned
One more lesson learned
Just another kick from behind
Just another punch in the eye
Another broken tooth
Against the bitter truth
Over and over again
I say, "No pain â no gain."

[Chorus]
I've never though
This nostalgia, this ache could be everlasting
Who's in front of me
I'll cut you deep like once you did
For the first and the last time

[Verse]
Past in a trash bag, no need to take it back
Keep my heart spare
Reanimated from despair
Another bee-sting, another fall from a swing
Over and over again
I've got myself obtained

[Chorus]
I've never though
This nostalgia, this ache could be everlasting
Who's in front of me
I'll cut you deep like once you did
For the first and the last time

This nostalgia, this ache could be everlasting
Who's in front of me
I'll cut you deep like once you did
For the first and the last time

[Instrumental]

No! No pain no gain! [2x]

[Bridge]
I'll cut you deep with forgiveness
My pain transformed into your sickness

[Chorus]
I've never though
This nostalgia, this ache could be everlasting
Who's in front of me
I'll cut you deep like once you did
For the first and the last time

This nostalgia, this ache could be everlasting
Who's in front of me
I'll cut you deep like once you did
For the first and the last time
