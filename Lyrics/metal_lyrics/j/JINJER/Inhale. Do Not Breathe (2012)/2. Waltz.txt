When I hold you in my arms
I can feel! I hear you cry!
There is no reason to decide
Whether to stay with you or not...

We burn! We cry! We crawl to the sky!
Speaking the words but they won't come out!
Pray to devil, curse the god!
Wash our hands in holy blood

Suffering! Knives tear us apart
Pain cuts right up to the heart!
Bleeding! Choking! Smothering my throat!

I will never bleed for you!
I have never promised to
We are only flesh and bones,
We are just a paragon!

When I hold you in my arms
I can feel! I hear you cry!
There is no reason to decide
Whether to stay with you or not...

Suffering! Knives tear us apart
Pain cuts right up to the heart!
Bleeding! Choking! Smothering my throat!
We are the ones who stay strong!
Fight with a wind, struggle the fire storm
We are the ones who stay strong!
Fight with a wind, struggle the fire storm.
