Let's go!

Steady your nerves now
Enjoy this world that grows around
May be it's nasty
No reason to waste your time in those endless cries

Your tears are reaching ground
Like they are falling from the clouds
Each time you cry you make me feel like I wanna die
It's like

Your tears are reaching ground
Like they are falling from the clouds
Each time you cry you make me feel like I wanna die
It's like

Listen, it's not the lesson, just want to ask you
Do me a favor if you will
Try not to mess with far-fetched depression
Deeply distressed you say you feel

Your tears are reaching ground
Like they are falling from the clouds
Each time you cry you make me feel like I wanna die
It's like

Your tears are reaching ground
Like they are falling from the clouds
Each time you cry you make me feel like I wanna die
It's like

Scissors inside of me, operating on my bleeding heart
Darkness invading, your insanity is tearing me apart
Scissors inside of me, operating on my bleeding heart
Darkness invading, your insanity is tearing me apart

Let's go!

Treasure what's given
Pieces build whole new life
Tender and innocent butterfly wings
Can cause the tornado sometimes

Tears are reaching ground like they are falling from the clouds

Scissors inside of me, operating on my bleeding heart
Darkness invading, your insanity is tearing me apart
Scissors inside of me, operating on my bleeding heart
Darkness invading, your insanity is tearing me apart

There's no other life
There's no other life
There's no other life without you anyway, don't say
There's no other life
