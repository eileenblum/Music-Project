Since the world goes round
Through the age of lies
We've been hiding our trust
Under tons of dust (under tons of dust)!

We're expecting a stab
In a back from a friend
We're all to attack
But never know how to defend
It's easy to believe
In something you can't see
While deceiving all your life
You catch me out in a lie

â¦downright
Monstrous, barefaced, outrageous

Monstrousâ¦ outrageous

Can't you see it is so downright?
Set me free for it holds me tight
I wanna feel that bitter taste
Set me free; now tell the truth to me
(please, tell me!)

Will you speak the truth?
Liberate me from the noose
I've been tied down for so long
Take us to a new stage
Turn another page,
Where we're not suspected anymore.

Trapped like a fly
In the tissue of lies,
I rot in delusion and trickery
Fuck all your deceptions!
Fuck your mesmerism!
Fuck the bullshit you've been feeding us with
(you've been feeding us with!)

Will you speak the truth?
Liberate me from the noose
I've been tied down for so long
Take us to a new stage
Turn another page,
Where we're not suspected anymore.
