When the final illusion falls apart
When the world's at the end
And sent back to the start!
I'll be right where you need me.

You say you're trapped and it seems there is no way out
You've lost your will to live and found new doubts
I will bleed for you if I have to
This is my choice I'm willing to help you

[Chorus:]
Never say always!
All shall come to pass!
Never say always!
Beauty never lasts!

You don't know what's in my soul
And you can't hear what's in my head
I'll hold on to what's my own
Until the end, until I'm dead

When the final illusion falls apart
I'll be right where you need me!

I know our roads separated us
I know you hurt but this pain won't last
I can die for you if I have to
This is my price I'm willing to pay it

[Chorus:]
Never say always!
All shall come to pass!
Never say always!
Beauty never lasts!

[Bridge 2x:]
No! I will never die!
No! I will never die

You hold on to what's your own! x2
And you can't hear what's in my head

[Bridge 2x:]
No! I will never die!
No! I will never die
