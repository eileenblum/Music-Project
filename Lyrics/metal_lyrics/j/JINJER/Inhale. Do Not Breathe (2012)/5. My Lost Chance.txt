You're circling down on me like a vulture.
From afar I can smell your stink.
I ain't your prey, so hold back the rapture.
I was dying, but I ain't dead yet.

[Chorus:]
And this is my last stand,
I cannot be broken,
while keeping memories of my lost chance.
This is my last stand,
I cannot be broken,
while keeping memories of my lost chance.

[Bridge:]
I gave you everything, everything and more!
I gave you everything and now it's your turn!

I'm walking tall against mental breakdown
Ignoring pain and fracture of my spine
My smirk will not be shadowed by your frown
As long as I'm alive i will be just fine.

[Chorus:]
And this is my last stand,
I cannot be broken,
while keeping memories of my lost chance.
This is my last stand,
I cannot be broken,
while keeping memories of my lost chance.

[Bridge:]
I gave you everything, everything and more!
I gave you everything and now it's your turn!
