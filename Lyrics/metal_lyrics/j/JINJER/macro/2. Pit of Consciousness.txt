I keep on loosing the keys
From reality
An now I'm passing on the wheel
To insanity.
In a secluded corner
Waiting for my time to come,
Waiting for the bedlam
To be pacified.

I am climbing hand over fist
And I scratch concrete.
Shine in the end...
My mistake it's not there.
The air is terribly heavy here
It settles inside
And I suffer burn after burn
From the dark.

Burn

In a pit of consciousness
Squeal is bleeding
So I feel there was someone else
Before me.
Eyes are changing colors.
A stranger knocks on my mind.
I became a foreigner
To myself!

Myself

Stillness stuns.
Wish I'd run
Creeped away to the light.
In my head someone else
Setting snares
For my soul.

In the darkest place
What was once named "consciousness"
I'm a miniature,
I'm a sketch forfeiting outlines.

Irrelevant entity to sanity,
A hive for nonsense,
For multiple selves
Resonating, but never compromising.

Stillness stuns.
Wish I'd run
Creeped away to the light.
In my head someone else
Setting snares
For my soul.
For my soul...

Waiting for my mind to be pacified
