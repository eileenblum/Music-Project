We came from the lands
Where kindness equals weakness
Feelings are conditional
And help is something supernatural

Your judgments sign your own punishment
Your judgments sign your own punishment

Yes, it is what it is
I know you're pissed off
Narrow minds cannot believe
What they hear

An individual with bitter inner world
Is a cause of deficiency of goodness and love
Of goodness and love
(Hm)
All your good intentions are muted and disabled
(Booyah!)
Tell me what you're gonna bring to the table?
Do you know we're gonna eat at the same table?

This is what it is!
I know you're pissed off
Narrow minds cannot believe
In what they hear
Their system of beliefs experiences stress
Mental impenitence put into the test

So if you are here
To bring the atmosphere of fear
Don't bother, brother
Don't bother, brother

The power of speech is idled away
Poison is spilled, dirty moths sting
Sting

Don't bother, brother
We've seen things that can't be unseen
Don't bother, brother
That's exactly what makes us go even farther

This is what it is
I know you're pissed off
Narrow minds cannot believe
In what they hear
Their system of beliefs experiences stress
Mental impenitence put into the test
Your judgments sign your own punishment
Your judgment, your punishment
