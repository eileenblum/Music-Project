Unsatisfied need makes you push forward
Greed, striving for its reward
Like a racer on the mark, you burn your rubber
Like a starving shark looking for its supper
You run, run, run, run, run
Until it makes no sense
Your feet are sore but you're still running
For accomplishment
In this eternal marathon for success
Another day, another dollar, undying motto of progress

Slowly to the top
Is it lonely on the top?

Is it lonely on the top?
Ah, tell me is there anyone for you?
For you, for you
Is it lonely on the top?
Ah, tell me is there anyone for you?
For you, for you

The lane is overcrowded
But the top is just for one
While the one is climbing
The rest are falling down
You climb, climb, climb, climb, climb
But the top is rising too
The track is getting longer
And it's leading to your tomb
You're not afraid to lose your mind
In the name of profit
Red ribbon is the finish
And the finish in the coffin

Is it lonely on the top?
Ah, tell me is there anyone for you?
For you, for you
Is it lonely on the top?
Ah, tell me is there anyone for you?
For you, for you

Who ran beside is left behind
Begging for help on his knees
Begging for help in tears
He whom you've started with, oh

The weak stepped aside, losers are crying

The weak stepped aside, losers are crying
The defeated will live in pain
You hit the top

No surprise!
But who will give you the prize?

It's a race against yourself
Nobody else will meet you there, yeah
