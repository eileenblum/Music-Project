...And the next day nobody died
Although nobody really lived.
Philosophers opened the disputes:
Is the mystery a mercy or catastrophe?

So all the people in this world want to have a holiday
A break from their monotonous everyday rituals.
Thus, the immortality is the greatest of God's alms.
But the festival of sudden eternity
Became a tragedy of their lives.

We want to live forever
And fear to never die
We hope to live forever
And fear to never die

Laboring from unbearable permanence
They travel to the edge to see if death still works there.
The half-dead are burden for the living man.
Half-death is a drawback for existence!
A half-dead man is buried
On the stranger's side.

We hope to live forever
And fear to never die
We turn to cemetery
For the alive.

She resumes her operation after vacation.
Newly the chain reaction launched
But this time backwards.
Yesterday they complained
About their athanasy
Now they ring a bell
About death penalty.

One day, if you're lucky, if she'll let you
You'll know her
One day, if you're lucky, if she'll let you
You'll know her
One day you'll know her
The Death with the capital!

You will understand the true difference
Between absolute and relative,
Between full and empty,
Between "there's some more" and
"There is no and never will be".
There is no and never will be!

For if we don't begin to die
Of future we are deprived
For if we don't begin to die
Of future we are deprived
