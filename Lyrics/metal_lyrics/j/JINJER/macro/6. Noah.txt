Haunted by the nature's fury as the legend reads
You set off to search for a new land as your master pleads.
Wood and nails, they create the masterpiece.

The Ark is gliding
Upon the flooded surface.
The wind is welcoming
And pushing it forward.

The Ark is on the tide. The tide is high.
Keep it safe and sound what you have inside.
What is meant to be let it be.
A blessing is a shield in your time of need.

The Ark is gliding
Upon the ocean.
A placid giant
On a mission.
The wholesome deed is transition
Of living creatures to the other side.
To find a mountain
The giant glides.

Noah!
Something went wrong, huh?
I can hear the animals moaning,
Dogs are howling in their roomless cage.
Why are you standing frozen with fear?
Staying on the boat for weeks
Where the sea and the air are still.
You sent a dove to find a seed.
You sent a dove but it will not return.

What is meant to be let it be.
Keep it safe and sound what you have inside.

The Ark is imprisoned
By the ocean.
A placid giant
Failed the mission.
Horizon bends over
Hiding dry land.
The giant surrenders
The quest for a mountain.

Skies are falling, Noah!
This woe just can't be gone!
The horizon is bending over
And now it's upside down...
