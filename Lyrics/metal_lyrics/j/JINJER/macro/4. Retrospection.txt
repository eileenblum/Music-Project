Slip up and fall straight into the arms of my mother
Break down and go right into the healing hands of my father.

It's been a while since I came home.
My heart is elsewhere as I roam and roam...
Until I find myself alone.
"Childhood of misery
Is lifelong injury."
No, it's not for me.
What I've always had
Father's love and mother's hand.

Nobody has ever seen a bird crawl back to its eggshell.
Follow by the bygone scenes
It makes me wanna get through them again!

I retrace my steps
To fall back into my nest.
In a minute eyes are closed
Just to feel where I'm supposed to be.

Is that what they call "homesick"?
Am I chasing the past?
Does my mind play insidious tricks?
'Cause the present moves too fast.

Straight into the arms...
Straight into the arms...
(ÐÑÐ¾ ÑÐµÐ±Ñ Ð²ÑÑÐ°Ð¶Ð¸Ð²Ð°Ð»?)
Straight into the arms...
(ÐÑÑÑÑÑ Ð»ÑÐ±Ð¾Ð²ÑÑ ÑÐºÑÐ°ÑÐ¸Ð²Ð°Ð»?)
Straight into the arms...
Falling back into my nest
Right into your arms.
