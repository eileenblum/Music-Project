What is this?!
What is this mess?!
What's that noise?
Is this a death sentence?
Terrifying silhouettes
Rising over the motherland.

Are those the fireworks?
No. It's a military quirk.
Is it a mermaid singing?
No. It's a siren screaming.

Is it an angel watching over us?
It's an air-fighter making a fuss.
Is it a unicorn galloping down the street?
No! These are soldiers' boots marching to the beat!

Marching to the beat!

Is it an angel watching over us?
Is it an air-fighter making a fuss?
Why is this party looking so bizarre?
A party? No! This is W-A-R!

My darling, did we wake up like this?
Isolated bodies in a boudoir of helplessness.
A bullet is an early bird, a midnight owl.
Morning greetings of a rooster are replaced
With "Fire in a hole".
"Fire in a hole".
My dear, do we have to go to sleep like that?
With a soothing cocktail and the hundredth cigarette.
Morning greetings of a rooster are replace
With "Fire in a hole!"

Our beds are cold,
As cold as basement floor.
Our beds are cold,
As cold as basement floor.
This house is not our shelter anymore.
This house is not our shelter anymore.
This house is not our shelter anymore.
Anymore, blyeh!

Home is not a building,
Home is liberty.
A place where memories live
In prosperity and peace.
I came back home so I want my home back.
I came back home so I want my home back.
Don't you leave us homeless!
Don't you leave us homeless!
Homeless!
Homeless!
