Wake up! Don't be afraid of knowledge!

Even without the events of 40 years ago
I think man would still be a creature that fears the dark
He doesn't face that fear
he averts his eyes from it
and acts as if he never had any memories of his past

40
years can be both a brief time
and yet, a long time
Man's fear has withered
and even time tries to wither the desire to know the truth

Is it a crime to try and learn the truth?
Is it a sin to search for those things which you fear?

My purpose in this world is knowledge
and the dissemination of it

And it is I who is to restore the fruits of my labors to the entire world
Fear... It is something vital to us puny creatures

The instant man stops fearing
is the instant the species will reach a dead end
only to sink to pitiable lows
only to sit and wait apathetically for extinction

Wake up! Don't be afraid of knowledge!

Humans who lose the capacity to think
become creatures whose existence has no value
Think, you humans who are split into two worlds
unless you want the gulf between humans to expand into oblivion

Think! You must think! Wake up!
