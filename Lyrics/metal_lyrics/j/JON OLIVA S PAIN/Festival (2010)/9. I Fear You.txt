I, I do surrender,
A waiting payment for my sins.
I, I can't remember...
Where the story ends or where it begins.

I've been living a lie,
Life on the line.
Now I realize...
Deep inside, I fear you, I fear you.

I can't hide...
All the souls I've taken for a ride,
Signs I cast aside...
Should have read the words between the lines.

I've been living a lie,
Life on the line.
Now I realize...
Deep inside, I fear you, I fear you!

Now I stand here facing you,
Blood on my hands what can I do.
Drop down to my knee's and pray,
I will see another day.

I've been living a lie,
Life on the line.
Now I realize...
Deep inside, I fear you, I fear you, I fear you, I fear you!
