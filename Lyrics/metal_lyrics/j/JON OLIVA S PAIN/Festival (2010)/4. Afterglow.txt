It's a cold hard pain, deep down inside,
Shared by the lonely, the evil, the holy.
It chooses no sides...
And it's hard... it's hard... hard...

In the dead of night, in the dark we know,
What we try to hide, seems to always show.
This eternal pain, that we keep inside,
It's the afterglow of the crucified.

In the darkness of night, there is no where to hide,
In the afterglow,
Let the torment begin, as you twist and you bend,
In the afterglow,
You run for your life, from the demons that hide,
In the afterglow,
Never heard, never seen as you cry and you scream,
In the afterglow.

I can't understand, what I'm feeling inside.
Desperate and lonely,
I feel like the only person alive,
And it's hard... it's hard... hard...

In the dead of night, in the dark we know,
What we try to hide, seems to always show.
This eternal pain, that we keep inside,
It's the afterglow of the crucified.

Oh you gotta believe me,
Oh listen to me.

Oh,
In the darkness of night, there is no where to hide,
In the afterglow,
Let the torment begin, as you twist and you bend,
In the afterglow,
You run for your life, from the demons that hide,
In the afterglow,
Never heard, never seen as you cry and you scream,
In the afterglow, yeah yeah.
