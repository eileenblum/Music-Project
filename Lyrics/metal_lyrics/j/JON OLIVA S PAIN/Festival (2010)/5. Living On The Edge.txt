Live you're life the only way you know,
About a thousand miles left to go.
Moving faster, towards disaster,
Oh the lines in the road got your eyes in a hold.

Still push onward,
The quicker the pace.
It's the trill that you chase,
Lost, you wonder.

You've been living to fast...
Since it all began,
Like you're nailed to the cross,
By your feet and hands.

Living on the edge of time...
You, living on the edge of time,
Living on the edge of time...
You, living on the edge of time.

Can't stop because it's to late now,
Hit the pedal, your throwing down.
Road starts winding, while lines blinding,
The road never ends.

It's just twist and it bends,
Nothing stops you.
The fog and the haze,
Has got your mind in a daze.

Try to break through...
You've been living to fast...
Since it all began,
Like you're nailed to the cross,
By your feet and hands.

Living on the edge of time...
You, living on the edge of time,
Living on the edge of time...
You, living on the edge of time.

You blink your eye.
There's a dead end sign,
Now you're at the end of the line.

Time to wake from this crazy dream,
Hit the breaks.
You start to scream,
Moving faster towards disaster...

Still push onward,
Lost, you wonder.
Nothing stops you.
Try to break through...
