Caught in the middle,
Looking for nothing.
Taking in what's around,
Time doesn't matter.
Life's gonna happen,
It keeps rolling on...

Like the wind through the tree's.
A cool misty breeze.
Against my face,
The warmth of the sun...
Got to learn to walk before you run,
Can't go through life always under the gun.
