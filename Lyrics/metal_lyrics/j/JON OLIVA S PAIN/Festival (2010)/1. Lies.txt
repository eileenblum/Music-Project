There's no truth in what you say,
The story, it constantly strays.
Oh yeah

Just falsehoods and alibis,
You can't even look in my eyes.
Oh no

Lies, tell me lies, always lies,
All I ever hear from you...
Lies, tell me lies, always lies
All I ever hear from you...
All I ever hear from you...

You want to keep control,
Tear me down, make me old.
Hold me still in your chains,
Cause me sorrow, cause me pain.

Learned all the tricks of the trade,
Always changing the rules of the game.
Oh no
A master of disguise,
The mask that you hide behind.
Oh no

Lies, tell me lies, always lies,
All I ever hear from you...
Lies, tell me lies, always lies
All I ever hear from you...
All I ever hear from you...

You want to keep control,
Tear me down, make me old.
Hold me still in your chains,
Cause me sorrow, cause me pain.

Tell me why you gotta treat me this way,
I'm the puppet and you're pulling the strings.
Keep me hidden like a jack-in-the-box,
Find a weakness and pick your spot.

You hold the key at it's starting to turn,
What a lesson I finally learned.
What your doing is no surprise,
I can see it in you eyes, yeah.

Why do you always keep me down,
Disrespect me and kicked me around.
When I die your gonna dance on my grave,
At least for now I'll be saved.

Safe from all you vicious lies,
Safe from false tears you've cry,
Safe from all the games you played,
Some things never change.
