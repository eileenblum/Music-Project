Late at night just thinking of you,
Wishing you were here to talk to, now, oh no.
At times I feel so all alone,
Travelling down this long and winding road.

I know that you'll be waiting for me,
I wish that I was with you,
Now, now.

I can't wait to see your face again,
But I'm so far away.
With every city I count the days...
Oh, the days.

Another lonely hotel room,
I know that I'll be with you soon,
I know, I know
Another show, another place.
Caught inside this same old race.

I know
I know that you'll be waiting for me,
I wish that I was with you,
Now, now.

I can't wait to see your face again,
But I'm so far away.
With every city I count the days...
Oh, the days.
