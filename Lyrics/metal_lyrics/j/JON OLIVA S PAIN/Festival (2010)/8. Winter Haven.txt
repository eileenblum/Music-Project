Beneath my feet a fresh fallen snow,
Miles and miles and miles to go.
A north wind blows cold today,
Makes it hard to find my way.
To the sanctuary I seek,
Lies beyond this mountain peak.
Winter's moon lights the snow.
Showing me the way to go.

I must move onward
I must move onward
I must move onward

And all around I hear the sounds,
Voices calling to me.
They lead the way to the place,
I so desperately seek.
I wearing down, the cold surrounds
It's weakening me
It's weakening me

Then I see past frozen trees,
Distant light glowing hopelessly.
Has my journey reached it end,
I'm so tired, cold and spent.
I'm in need of rest and peace,
A winter haven tranquility.
A place to lay my head,
Eternity, enough's been said.

I must move onward
I must move onward
I must move onward

And all around I hear the sounds,
Voices calling to me.
They lead the way to the place,
I so desperately seek.
I wearing down, the cold surrounds
It's weakening me
It's weakening me

The light that I put before you, was an illusion,
I cast the flame away.
I am here to destroy you,
I'm your master, you are my slave.
Christ can't save you now,
Under my power.
I squeeze the life out of your precious soul,
Now it's mine, for all of time, it's this world I control.
Now that you're mine for all the time,
The blood leaks from your eyes.
I'll squeeze you till your dry.

Should not have entered the circle,
Should not have followed the visions displayed.
The way I played you was perfect, it lead you to me,
I cast your soul away.

Christ can't save you now,
Under my power.
I squeeze the life out of your precious soul,
Now it's mine, for all of time, it's this world I control.
Now that you're mine for all the time,
The blood leaks from your eyes.
I'll squeeze you till your dry...

I must move onward
I must move onward...
