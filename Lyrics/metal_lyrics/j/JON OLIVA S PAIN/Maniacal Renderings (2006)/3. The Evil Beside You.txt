When we were young but never told
How the world could be so cold
As we change from young to old
The night takes us away
The night takes us away
As the day falls to the night
Then we take the stage
Play the game of life
Where everyone's just trying to succeed
At dawn as the day begins
To weave our way through a world of sin
Temptation only leads to agony
And I can feel your tired, starving
Try to break through
Feel the weight of the world upon you
There's nothing but Evil beside you
Watch out cause they're coming to get you
Another day just trying to get through
Live, love at times we grieve
But there's so much more that we really need
Seems all there is are sketchy prophecies
Scratch, claw just to survive
Have to fight our way through this world of lies
Just so we can feed our families
And I can feel your tired, starving
Try to break through
Feel the weight of the world upon you
There's nothing but Evil beside you
Watch out cause they're coming to get you
Another day just trying to get through
