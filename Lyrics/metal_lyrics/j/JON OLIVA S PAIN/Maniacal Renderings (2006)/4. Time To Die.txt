You have crossed the line
Your suicide, the final ride
You ignored the signs
A helpless fight it ends tonight
Your souls traveling on
All the twisted things you've done
You thought you had the master plan
Now it's all caught up to you
And still you wonder why
I can see right through you brother
You're not fooling anyone
Now you pay the final price
It's time for you to die
Time is all but out
Death calls for you, what can you do
Try to form a lie to buy some time
So you can run and hide
And beg and plead before the lord
You'll be on your knees
All the twisted things you've done
You thought you had the master plan
Now it's all caught up to you
And still you wonder why
I can see right through you brother
You're not fooling anyone
Now you pay the final price
It's time for you to die
It's time for you to die
All the twisted things you've done
You thought you had the master plan
Now it's all caught up to you
And still you wonder why
I can see right through you brother
You're not fooling anyone
Now you pay the final price
It's time for you to die
All the twisted things you've done
You thought you had the master plan
Now it's all caught up to you
And still you wonder why
I can see right through you brother
You're not fooling anyone
Now you pay the final price
It's time for you to die
It's time for you to die
It's time for you to die
