And in the dark I look for you
I'd expect you'd be there
With every show I run this through
It all seems so unfair
How you lose the ones you love
That you need to be there
You know life isn't perfect now all I do is reflect
Still I pray for you now
Still I pray for you now
Everyday I think of you
Someday I'll meet you there
Maybe you can show me through
Through the heavens we'll share
Till then I'll just say goodnight
And leave you with this prayer
I hope in peace you do rest
Forever you will be missed
Ah, still I pray for you now
Still I pray for you now
Still I pray for you now
Still I pray for you now
Still I pray for you now
