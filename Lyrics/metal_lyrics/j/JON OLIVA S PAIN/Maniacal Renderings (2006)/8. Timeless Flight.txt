Father as I kneel and pray
To the Lord above, can he save the day
Or will he just turn away
From my heart I say
I long to change this lonely life
I say a prayer every night
That the world will survive
Just souls on a timeless flight
Different cultures, different ways
Father time moves on
We all must turn the page
To a chapter that fades
Down the roads we pave
I long to change this lonely life
I say a prayer every night
That the world will survive
Just souls on a timeless flight
And so my friends I've got to say
I wish to thank you all
Before I go away
In my heart you'll remain for all eternity
The love you gave, what more can I say
You all helped change this lonely life
Welcome to this world of pain
News media fills our brains
War, hate all we dread
Continuous lies we are fed
Cities are burning, ruins remain
Terrorist cells of the insane
Innocent victims of political chess
Stolen lives we'll never forget
Welcome to this world of pain
News media fills our brains
War, hate all we dread
Continuous lies we are fed
Cities are burning, ruins remain
Terrorist cells of the insane
Innocent victims of political chess
Stolen lives we'll never forget
Take me to the promise land
Take me to the promise land
Reaching outward save their precious lives
Take me to the promise land
Take me to the promise land
Reaching outward save their precious lives
