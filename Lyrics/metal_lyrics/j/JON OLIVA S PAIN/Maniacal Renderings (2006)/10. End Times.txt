And I know, yeah I know
So many times they've knocked upon my door

Don't believe all that you see
People are actively
Trying to deceive
You with their lies

They approach you like they care
I'm telling you to beware
Evil has no cares
Just alibis

So you open your door
And they put on a show,
Can't you see they're just pretending

Speak the words of the lord
His name that they scorn
It's lives they're collecting

Thriving in the end times
Trying hard to steal another life
Looking for a good sign
But they've lost them all I'm sure

See they prey upon the weak
Just like the snake they creep
Ever so cautiously
Into your life

Told you lived a life of sin
And if you don't give in
To what they're preaching
It's hell when you die

Then I just slam the door
I can't take anymore
The story's always changing

And I just cannot wait
Till they come face to face
With the God that
They're disgracing

Thriving in the end times
Trying hard to steal another life
Looking for a good sign
But they've lost them all I'm sure
