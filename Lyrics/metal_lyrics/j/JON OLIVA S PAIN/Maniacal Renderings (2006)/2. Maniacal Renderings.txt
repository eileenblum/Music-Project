I don't see things quite the same
Pictures inside my brain
Twisted visions they get scattered
I just move further away
From life's reality
Like a painting that scarred and tattered
Can you feel me deeply breathing in your dreams where
I show you pictures only you and I can see
I'm just paving the way
I'm in total control
I don't hear what you say
I am running the show
I know soon you'll awake
But before I go
I want to have a part of you to take with me
Maniacal renderings of TWISTED VISIONS SHOWING HELL
Maniacal renderings of TWISTED VISIONS SHOWING HELL
I just wanna touch you all
And smile as I watch you fall
I just don't know right from wrong
Or where these memories belong
They are specters shadow dancing
I tell it all black and white
I use no colors to hide
All the things that are grey and blackened
Can you feel me deeply breathing in your dreams where
I show you pictures only you and I can see
I'm just paving the way
I'm in total control
I don't hear what you say
I'm still running the show
I know soon you'll awake
But before I go
I want to have a part of you to take with me
Maniacal renderings of TWISTED VISIONS SHOWING HELL
Maniacal renderings of TWISTED VISIONS SHOWING HELL
I just wanna touch you all
Smile as I watch you fall
Now I will soon set you free
No more will you have to see
These visions that we have offered
Now you may choose your own
Be sure you never betray
The pictured lives we have ordered
Can you feel me deeply breathing in your dreams where
I show you pictures only you and I can see
I'm just paving the way
I'm in total control
I don't hear what you say
I'm still running the show
I know soon you'll awake
But before I go
I want to have a part of you to take with me
Maniacal renderings of TWISTED VISIONS SHOWING HELL
Maniacal renderings of TWISTED VISIONS SHOWING HELL
I just wanna touch you all
And smile as I watch you fall
