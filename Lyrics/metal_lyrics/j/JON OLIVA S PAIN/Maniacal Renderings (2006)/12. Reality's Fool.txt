[bonus track]

And in the dark I look for you
But you don't seem to be there
Oh could it be I'm just too much for you
Too much for you to still care.

Now I live my life inside this bottle
And I pray I live to see tomorrow
It's so sad but it's true
I'm reality's fool

And every night I think of you
While in the hands of despair
You know just another drink might just get me through
The fact that you're just not there

No I'm slowly slipping off to nowhere
Maybe someday I'll find you somewhere
It's so sad but it's true
I'm reality's fool

So I guess you found maybe someone new
Someone to lead you down there
You know just about everything about you is breaking news
You must be the perfect affair

So I live my life inside this bottle
And I pray I live to see tomorrow
It's so sad but it's true
I'm reality's fool
