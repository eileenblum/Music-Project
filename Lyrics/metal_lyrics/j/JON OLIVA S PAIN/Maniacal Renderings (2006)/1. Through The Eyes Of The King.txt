What is this he sees
All through history
He has been watching over the lands
Now he just sees tragedy
All the world's misery
Are as plain as the lines on his hands
What's this I see
Through the eyes of the King
Still sits upon his throne
Guarded by walls of stone
Through the years he surely has grieved
Look at what the world has done
We have poisoned everyone
Now he sees things he just can't believe
What's this I see
Through the eyes of the King
He looks for reason why
Pain fills his eyes
Run, we can't hide from our destiny
Now we face judgment day
Have we doomed humanity
Is there time for us all to be saved
What's this I see
Through the eyes of the King
