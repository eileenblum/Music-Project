You, looking out of holes
Tell me what you see
Just pain and agony
So this is holy war
The people who live free
Are now your enemy
And I want to know
Is it worth it all?
There's so much waiting out there
Open your eyes and you will see
Or you'll just keep on hanging
Like puppets on a string
You are the living dead
Your life's been thrown away
You're counting down the days
So you're answering his call
To live your life this way
As nothing but his slave
And I want to know
Is it worth it all?
There's so much waiting out there
Open your eyes and you will see
Or you'll just keep on hanging
Like puppets on a string
There's so much waiting out there
Open your eyes and you will see
Or you'll just keep on hanging
