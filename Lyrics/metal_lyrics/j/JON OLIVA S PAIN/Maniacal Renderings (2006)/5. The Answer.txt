There's something in the night air
Cool breeze make me shutter
How strange is the calm before the storm
Another day of news breaks
A world now in hear ache
Sometimes I feel I just got to let go
And why, why can't we all love
Why does it hurt so, maybe tomorrow
I'm here, I'm free, look up, tell me

And Jesus show me the answers
Your picture is faded, your image is gone, gone
And people can you hear what I'm saying
You'd better start praying
We could all soon be gone

Time it keeps on passing you
Lives caught in a maze
World she's living on borrowed time
Now it's all up to you
As another night grows cold
Lord heal my soul

Have we lost our way
God knows it
Can we change the world
Please show us

And Jesus show me the answers
Your picture is faded, your image is gone, gone
And people can you hear what I'm saying
We'd better start praying
We could all soon be gone

Have we lost our way
God knows it
Can we change the world
Please show us

And Jesus show me the answers
Your picture is faded, your image is gone, gone
And people can you hear what I'm saying
We'd better start praying
We could all soon be gone,gone

Oh yeah
Have we lost our way
God knows it
Can we change the world
