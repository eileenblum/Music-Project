[bonus track]

How could you let me go
After all that we've been through
I can't live without you

I had so much to give
And this I know is true
Now I face a life of solitude

Only you
Only you
Only you

I just can't seem to find
Quite the words to say
I'll just dream through these lonely days

And if you make a new start
Hope you find a love that's true
Happiness is all I want for you

Only you
Only you
Only you
