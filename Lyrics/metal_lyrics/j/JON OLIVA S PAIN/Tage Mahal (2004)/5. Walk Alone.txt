How can you walk alone child
How can you walk alone
How can you walk alone child
How can you walk alone
Everytime I look into your eyes
I feel the pain inside
How can you walk alone child
How can you walk alone

I feel it, I feel it, down inside yes
I see it, I see it all the time yes
I'm bleeding, I'm bleeding from inside
Can Christ see it
Someone heal me
Before my time's up

Why can't I sleep at night dear
Why can't I sleep at night
Why can't I sleep at night dear
Why can't I sleep at night
Everytime I try to close my eyes
The nightmares arrive
Why can't I sleep at night dear
I just can't sleep at night

I feel it, I feel it, down inside yes
I see it, I see it all the time yes
I'm bleeding, I'm bleeding from inside
Can Christ see it
Someone heal me
Before my time's up

I'm telling you, better listen to me
This is what it's gonna take for your soul to be free
If you feel like pushing to the edge
Better take a step back, find a friend
Or something you can hold on to
That'll make you feel better, that'll make you cool
And if you got one, give it to me so
I can finally be set free

How do you walk alone child
