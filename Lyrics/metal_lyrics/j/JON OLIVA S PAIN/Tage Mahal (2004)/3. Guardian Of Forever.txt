[Written by Jon Oliva]

The silent night begins to call
He listens for the voices from the crumbling walls
And through the mist beneath the sky
He watches as the seconds of your life go by

I see sorrows, laughter, fear from the other side
Rainbows blackened, innocence fractured
And left to die
And if I could change the world
I'd stop just watching
Time, as she unfurls
All the lives still searching

Searching for the light of day
He always sees the dark this way
He sits here helplessly watching time
It's beginning to fade
See it's not in his control
All the lives bought and sold
Nothing there to grasp or hold
Watching your soul fly away
Fly away

I've seen chapters, world disasters
Nearing genocide
Schizophrenia, megalomania
Mass suicide
And if I could change the world
I'd stop just watching
Time, as she unfurls
All the lives still searching

Searching for the light of day
He always sees the dark this way
He sits here helplessly watching time
It's beginning to fade
See it's not in his control
All the lives bought and sold
He sits there helplessly watching time
It's beginning to fade
