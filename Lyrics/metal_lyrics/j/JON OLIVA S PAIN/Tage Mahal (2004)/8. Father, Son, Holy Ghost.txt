[Written by Jon Oliva]

Oh, our world how it's changed
Nothing's the same, I don't think it could ever be

Life, life rearranged
Body insane, what the hell do you want from me

With every second surrounding you
You just can't think when you're scared
And is the end really approaching you
Why can't we run away to another time
Another place where your soul is safe

Complications in your life
They say only the strong survive
Revolution coast to coast
Father, Son, Holy Ghost

Watch, watch the deranged
It rattles my brain, I just cannot comprehend

Things, things that I see on my TV
When will all this madness end

When every waking hour is engulfing you
It's just so hard to think when you're scared
And is the end really approaching you
Why can't we fly away to another time
Another place where your soul is safe

Complications in your life
They say only the strong survive
Revolution coast to coast
Father, Son, Holy Ghost

With every second surrounding you
It's just so hard to think when you're scared
And is the end really approaching you
Why can't we dream away to another time
Another place where your soul is safe

Complications in your life
They say only the strong survive
Revolution coast to coast
Father, Son, Holy Ghost
