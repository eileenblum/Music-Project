[Written by Jon Oliva]

As I walk in the shadows of darkness
Without a place to hide
You know I can't help but look over my shoulder
I'm waiting for the knife to arrive

And I know I might seem a little bit paranoid
You know, it's just my way
Sometimes I get the feeling I'm on borrowed time
Anyway, that's what most of us say

Something's taking over me
I don't know just what could it be
Feels strange, like a kind of glow
What it is I don't want to know

And in another life I swear I've heard it all before
And in the dead of night
It sits just outside the door

I believe that tonight I'll be wasted
Can't stop me when I'm out on the town

You know, I wake dreaming about tomorrow
And what it may all bring to light
You know, I believe all men were created equal
Red, yellow, black or white

Something's taking over me
I don't know just what could it be
Feels strange, like a kind of glow
What it is I don't want to know

And in another life I swear I've heard it all before
And in the dead of night
It sits just outside the door

I believe that tonight I'll be wasted
Can't stop me when I'm out on the town
I can feel it, I can taste it
Can't stop me when I'm out on the town
