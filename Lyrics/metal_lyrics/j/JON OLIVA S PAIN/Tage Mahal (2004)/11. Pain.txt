[Written by Jon Oliva]

You cannot run or hide
From the pain that lives inside
Taking everything you own
As we speak itâs taking your soul
It will never wait
It anticipates
Every move you make
Sends you out of control

Now...
The rage inside, you can feel it grow
The knife in your heart, it begins to show
You run and you run but canât get away
From the agony of the pain

You cannot stop it now
Every nerve in your body growls
Mind craves spirit unrest
Hereâs to the curse that now lay at rest

It will never wait
It anticipates
Every move you make
Sends you out of control

Now...
The rage inside, you can feel it grow
A knife in the heart, it begins to show
I run and I run but canât get away
From the agony of the pain
