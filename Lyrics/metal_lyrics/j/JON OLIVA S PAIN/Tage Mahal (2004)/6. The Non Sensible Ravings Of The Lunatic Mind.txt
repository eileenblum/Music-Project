[Written by Jon Oliva]

Thoughts once flourished, now twisting, curving
Around his head, all his nerves are burning
Tormented spirits with angry demons
They dance through his mind
With no apparent reason

Something inside the mind is twisting
Slightly deranged, there's something missing
Something inside the mind is twisting
Slightly deranged, there's something missing
Lost in confusion, there is no solution
For his life of crime

Walks the night with the neon children
His strange delights, they've all been written
Controls the cities of desire, now touch him
Feel him, he's hell on fire

Something inside the mind is twisting
Slightly deranged, there's something missing
Something inside the mind is twisting
Slightly deranged, there's something missing
Lost in confusion, there is no solution
For his life of crime

Moving faster, towards disaster, let's his life go
Beyond distinction, the only kingpin
He's running the show

He cheats and steals and he lies with reason
Your precious life is his open season
He's the ruler of the twisted
Like sheep they follow, there's no resisting

Something inside the mind is twisting
Slightly deranged, there's something missing
Something inside the mind is twisting
Slightly deranged, there's something missing
Lost in confusion, there is no solution
For his life of crime
