[Written by Jon Oliva]

How do you feel about life
Are you tired of trying
How do you feel about gods
Do you think they were lying
How do you feel about peace
And the wars we keep fighting
In a world divided

They know something we donât know
Not much time here left to go
Nowhere to run, nowhere to run
They just keep denying
We know theyâre all lying
Soon it will show, soon it will show

How do you feel about war
And the thousands left dying
Can you see through their eyes
Politicians conniving
Terrorism, disease and the suicide bombings
No oneâs disarming

They know something we donât know
Not much time here left to go
Nowhere to run, nowhere to run
They just keep denying
We know theyâre all lying
Soon it will show, soon it will show

Whatâs left for me to say
We are all headed for judgement day

They know something we donât know
Not much time here left to go
Nowhere to run, nowhere to run
They just keep denying
We know theyâre all lying
Soon it will show, soon it will show
