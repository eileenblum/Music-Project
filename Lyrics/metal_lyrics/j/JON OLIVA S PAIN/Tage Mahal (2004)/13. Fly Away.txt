[Written by Jon Oliva]

Long ago, oh so long ago
How time passed slowly by

And the days seem like years
Never a thought or a fear
Ever really mattered to me

Now I stand here today just trying to make my way
Nothing's getting through to me
I'll fly away

Had to look, you just had to look
At the signs that passed us by

I've got one thing to say
Judge each of your days by the light you see
Cause time she goes by like a bird in the sky
Till there's nothing left to see
I'll fly away

All this time spinning round, holding on to nothing I can feel
Reaching out, full of doubt, twist and turn
But I'm always falling down
Time to free your soul:

I'll fly away
