[Written by Jon Oliva]

I can only stare and wonder
Dreams and visions
That I ponder, so clearly now
There before me, figure in darkness
Rage and anger, cold and heartless
He wants to take me back somehow

I can't take it no more
Tempting fate, my soul awaits it's crucifixion
I can't take it no more
The influence imprisons me
With it's intrigue, as you can see
A punishment I live out all the time

Something inside me wants to break out
Lies with conviction, leaving no doubt
He's waiting there
Looks for weakness, tries to persuade me
His certain ending is all that I see
He wants to take me back somehow

I can't take it no more
Tempting fate, my soul awaits it's crucifixion
I can't take it no more
The influence imprisons me
With it's intrigue, as you can see
A punishment I live out all the time
