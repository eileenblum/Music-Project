[Written by Jon Oliva]

The smoke from my last cigarette
Disappears into the lights
Waiting on something to make this feeling right
I twist and moan, and turn the other cheek
I wait for my moment to be free
I'm not alone
I'm not alone

The night is black it twists and turns
Inside it's agony
It waits for you, it waits for me, in all its majesty
I can feel it, I can hear it, I can see it
Slowly coming closer to me now
It's breathing, heart is beating, thoughts misleading
Reality has somehow broken down
Slowly slips away, slips into the grave
I don't think I'll ever, ever, ever get away
Somehow save our souls, as the darkness calls,
From beyond these walls
I feel something's going wrong

The dark descends upon this
World of anger, hate and greed
Surrounding you, engulfing me
Now all that we can see
Lying, cheating, children bleeding
Mothers pleading
Will you stop it, will you stop it now
Can you feel it, do you hear it
It's so near, it's coming closer, coming closer now

Tell me what you see
Tell me what you know
Tell me can we ever really ever get away
Try to save our souls as the dark unfolds
All that's still untold
I feel something's going wrong

And as the dark begins to die into another day
And fate is testing once again all we can do is pray
To sweet Jesus, will you lead us, do you hear us
Calling to you, calling to you now
We're praying, contemplating, situations
That can fall before us even know

Tell us what you need, tell us what you want
As the hands of time have all but exited the play
Tell us what's in store, fall all that stand before
As the dark unfolds:
I feel something's going wrong
