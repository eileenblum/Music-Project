[Written by Jon Oliva]

I told you about the sirens
And the hunger for flesh
I showed you the dungeons
Beneath the city's unrest
Feel the power of the night
Make the legions strong
And by the grace of the witch
I bring to you this song: hear the people say

Hear the people say: hear the people say
Hear the people say, just gimme some hell

We enter the halls of the mountain king
Beyond the doors of the dark
Flying on strange wings
From the streets to the gutter
In a summer's rain
Do you hear the hounds they call
And tonight he grins again: hear the people say

Hear the people say: hear the people say
Hear the people say, just gimme some hell

Somewhere in time I believe
Visions off in a dream
Start as nothing turn to something

Look to the morning sun
Through the hourglass
One child turns to me
And says: Take a chance

Hear the people say: hear the people say
Hear the people say, just gimme some hell

Somewhere in time I believe
Visions off in a dream
Start as nothing turn to something
