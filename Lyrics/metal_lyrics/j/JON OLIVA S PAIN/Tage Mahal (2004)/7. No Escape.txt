[Written by Jon Oliva]

Let's go into the darkness surrounding you
Mind goes, it's the first step to breaking you

Chase the wind as you twist and spin and you
Wanna hide, wanna die
To everything that they did or bring, and you
Wanna hide, wanna die

I know it's too late to save your soul
Mind games, they cut you like the bitter cold

Sucks you into this life of sin and you
Wanna hide, wanna die
No escape from this world you made and you
Wanna hide, wanna die

All emotions now turning to stone
Icy fingers gripping your soul
No escape from the fears that you've shown
It's all you have in this world of your own

Don't wait, you must discard what's poisoned you
It's okay, I know one day we'll find the truth

Chase the wind as you twist and spin and you
Wanna hide, wanna die
No escape from the dreams you've made and you
Wanna hide, wanna die
