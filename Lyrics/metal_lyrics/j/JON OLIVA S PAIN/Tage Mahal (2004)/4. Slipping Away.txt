[Written by Jon Oliva]

Bridges burn, the lessons learned
Often slip the mind
Complicate the life we live
With answers we can't find
And it's true, yeah

And all that we plan everyday
And all that we have is slipping away

Set apart a timeless flight
In search of destiny
Visions twisting through the night
Are shadows we now see
And it's true, yeah

And all that we plan everyday
And all that we have is slipping away

Chase our dreams endlessly
To see what we can find
With everyday a part of us
Is left to ponder time
And it's true, yeah

And all that we plan everyday
And all that we have is slipping away
