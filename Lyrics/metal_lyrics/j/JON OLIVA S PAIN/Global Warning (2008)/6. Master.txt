I'm the computer
I'm running your life
I know all you do... your pleasures-delights

All you desire, all that you need
I give to you with insanity
So many visions to you I have shown
Caught in my web, forever you'll roam

I knew I would catch you, it's me that you need
I will command you to do what I please
I taunt you, and tease you
Then leave you alone
To deal with temptations that I have known

I'm the computer
I call all the shots
I am your god
It's your life I've got

To play with forever, I'll never let go
You see... you amuse me, the star of my show
I am your master, a devil you see
You've been infected with my disease

I control all that you hear and you see
I am the one who will tend to your needs
I'll take you to places that you'd never go
I'll fill your soul... with all that I know
