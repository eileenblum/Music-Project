You, now you're gone
You're not here anymore
It seems so wrong
Life, so unclear
You were always there
Now you've disappeared

I've been waiting for a sign
I hope you left behind
I feel it deep inside
I feeling I can't hide

So, life goes on
Though your picture fades
Your light shines on
Beyond what we can see
Now heaven waits for you and me

Now a star to light the night
And all you left behind
Has truly touched my life
My friend I say goodbye
