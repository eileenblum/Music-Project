It's a scene you won't believe
All the things you can see
Many places you can go
Close your eyes now, start the show

Here no rules apply
Reach out touch the sky
Beware as darkness starts calling

Follow me, sample many a pleasure
That up above, you can't even mention
I see a soul; it's mine for the taking
Follow me... it's time for your to take a ride

Not a movie, not T.V.
Motivation, wondering
All your secrets, watch them unfold
Like your dreams, like your goals

Can't you see they're coming to get you
Lost, alone, no one to protect you
Whatever you do they'll always resent you

Time to decide, where to go
Start your journey, to the unknown
