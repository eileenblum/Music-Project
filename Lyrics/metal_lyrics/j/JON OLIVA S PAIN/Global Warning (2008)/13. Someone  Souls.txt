On and on... and on and on
Down this round I'm traveling on
I don't want to go... I don't want to go
I don't want to go... But I must
Try to touch someone

Everybody, everybody's telling me so
Telling me which way I should go
I don't really care... I don't really care
I don't really care... I'm still alone
Then I find a way to laughing inside
Just doing time... doing time... doing time
The only way I will go... I will go... I will go
Is when it's time for me to fly

Always someone's talking
Always someone's walking
Turn their backs to it all
Someone is mistaken
Someone's slowly breaking
Got your back against the wall

So once again I'm left to hide another
Day of cuts and scars
I've been saving through time
Now it's time for me to go
Time for me to go
Time for me to go
Time for me to fly
