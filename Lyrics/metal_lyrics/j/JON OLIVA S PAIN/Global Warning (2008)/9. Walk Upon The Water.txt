This is the strangest place
Seems like endless space
I can't see so well
Is it heaven, is it hell
What am I gonna find

Have I been here before
Am I forever more
I look for something real
Something I can touch and feel

What am I gonna find... what am I

Someone out there that can show me the way
Nothing here seems real, am I going insane
Am I caught in a dream or locked behind the door

And as I walk upon the water
Not knowing where I stand
Is this for me what God has ordered
I'm just trying to understand

I see faces in a haze
Are they ghosts of yesterdays
They seem to know me well
The stories that they tell
What am I gonna find

All I can say, trying to find my way
It's gonna be alright, I'm gonna be alright
Life is a game... A game we all must play
It's gonna be alright... you're gonna be alright

And as I walk upon the water
Not knowing where I stand
Is this for me what God has ordered
I'm just trying to understand

If I open my eyes, will this all disappear
Should I follow the light, or should I remain here
If I follow my heart, will it show me the way
Past the twists and the turns that await me on this day
