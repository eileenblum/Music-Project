I am trying to look past the lying
That is forced upon me everyday and night
They play the game of life and death
Millions they have spent
On useless war machines
The cause of what we see

Liars, liars... Liars, liars

We are adding the cost
We are adding the cost
We are adding the cost
We are adding the cost

Thousands die each day of hunger and disease
Open up your eyes, see the wasted lives
That once was precious caught in circumstances
Now with death they're dancing, searing desperate glances

Crying, crying... Dying, dying

We are adding the cost
We are adding the cost
We are adding the cost
We are adding the cost

So what's the answer to the world's dilemma
If you ask me questions I will show you figures
That will stagger; rock you... that will truly shock you
Bring you to your knees, watch you beg and plead
But they will not listen 'cause their souls are missing
They're just mindless specters looking like court jesters

We are adding the cost
We are adding the cost
We are adding the cost
We are adding the cost
