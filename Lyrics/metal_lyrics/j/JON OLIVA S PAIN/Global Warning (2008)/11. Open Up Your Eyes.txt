I've got a lot to say
But there is just so little time
Some of what I say
Will cross lines

And I want to know
A direction we can go
A road we all can follow

I've got to, I've got to, I've got to
Open up your eyes

With our lives they play
'Til the mind just twists inside
Got to run away
Leave it all behind

And I want to know
Will you let it go
The nightmares never over

I've got to, I've got to, I've got to
Open up your eyes
