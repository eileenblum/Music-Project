Living in disguise
I'm sure they have arrived
Strange race seeking power
Countdown designated hour
Really want to know
Are they friend or foe
Or just a cast of lunatics

Oh... you never know
Oh no... you never know

They're here amongst us all
They seek the west to fall
Evil souls, twisted minds
Just waiting for a sign
Inside their hatred grows
From the lies they've been told
Who's the loser in the end

Oh... you never know
Oh no... you never know

Everywhere sleeper cells
Standing at the gates of hell
Satan smiles with delight
Soon to feed his appetite
Do you want to know
What he has in store
For you the pain
Will never end
