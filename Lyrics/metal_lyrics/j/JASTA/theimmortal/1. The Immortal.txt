I am the immortal
All thatâs born of sacrifice
I am the immortal
Persistence personified

Dwelling in every possibility
Knowing my deeds will get their chance to speak
Days are drawing closer
My emotions running colder
Grateful in every step I take
Temperance keeps me sane

Stop trying to find yourself
and start defining yourself.
You canât crush the limits without pushing them
Iâve taken the bad with the worse
Iâve seen the gifts I lift the curse
Rip the roots of doubt from the ground
Take whatâs mine the time is now

[Lyrics by Jamey Jasta]
