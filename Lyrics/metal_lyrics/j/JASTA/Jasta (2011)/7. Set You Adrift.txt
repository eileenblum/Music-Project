Stolen she wept, sworn to secrecy
Fighting the current, lying to forget
Feeling so gone, now the silence swells
Beauty betrays, writing the last farewell

Set you adrift you're on your own
Disbelief leaves me numb, paralyzed by what I've done
Words fail to heal again,

Withered each day, shattered spirits shed
Septic in thoughts heart and mind impose
Violent in dreams Self defeating grip
Speechless again, upon a single tear

Set you adrift you're on your own, you're on your own
Disbelief leaves me numb, it leaves me numb
Paralyzed by what I've done, by what I've done
Words fail to heal again

And words fail to transcend
Now words fall like a single tear
I fail to find the words again
Now I fall to find the words for you

Tears fill an ocean of despair, dreams crashing down
Fears form a web of desrepair, we've been torn apart
Caught in the traps of our own doomed certainty
This is a call to dissolve all the apathy

Set you adrift you're on your own, you're on your own
Disbelief leaves me numb, it leaves me numb
Paralyzed by what I've done, by what I've done
Words fail to heal again

Tears fill an ocean of despair, dreams crashing down
Fears form a web of desrepair, we've been torn apart
Caught in the traps of our own doomed certainty
This is a call to dissolve all the apathy
