The truth is the first casualty in every war
Damage done, endless tragedy
Doomed to just speak words of before

We are nothing, we are nothing
We are nothing they say we are
We are nothing, we are nothing
We are nothing they say we are

Now it has come to this again
Prejudged and misinformed
No way to find a common ground
No way to right the wrongs of old

We are nothing, we are nothing
We are nothing they say we are
We are nothing, we are nothing
We are nothing they say we are

We are nothing, we are nothing
We are nothing they say we are
We are nothing, we are nothing
We are nothing they say we are

We are nothing, we are nothing
We are nothing they say we are
We are nothing, we are nothing
We are nothing they say we are

We are nothing, we are nothing
We are nothing they say we are
We are nothing, we are nothing
We are nothing they say we are

We are nothing that they say we are
