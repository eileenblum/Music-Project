I fight for freedom
live free or die for those who sacrifice
I fight for freedom
this is the anthem of the freedom fighter

With inflaming rage, volcanic revenge
Yearning blood for land and home this fight has just begun
To subdue the impossible and weaken enemies
Climb over mountains with the strongest will

Under storming skies
Trails by flame and merciless winds
For the peoples determination
In a hostile land of strife

This is my home and this is my fire
This is true vengeance, the ultimate resistance
Now ask yourself before you judge
What is it you fight for? Are you willing to bleed?

Because I fight for freedom
live free or die for those who sacrifice
I fight for freedom
this is the anthem of the freedom fighter

Revolution is in the hands of those who aren't afraid to fight
Vowing the oath beneath the shade of the flag, for the land
For the people of all colors and creeds
If resistance must survive, confrontation must proceed

Now ask yourself before you judge
What is it you fight for? Are you willing to bleed?

Because I fight for freedom
live free or die for those who sacrifice
I fight for freedom
this is the anthem of the freedom fighter

I fight for freedom, I fight for freedom
I fight for freedom, I fight for freedom
This is the anthem of the freedom fighter

I fight for freedom
live free or die for those who sacrifice
I fight for freedom
this is the anthem of the freedom fighter

I fight for freedom, I fight for freedom
I fight for freedom
This is the anthem of the freedom fighter
