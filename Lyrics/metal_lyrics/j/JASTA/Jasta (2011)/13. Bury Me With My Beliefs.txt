When the grim promise must be fulfilled
Iâll look back with no regrets in sight
My time will have pass but not my dreams
Because when that day comes
Iâll be at peace
Bury me with my beliefs

They can bury my hands
But not the efforts
Or the triumphs that I strived to achieve
They can bury my shoulders
And the weight of the countless burdens in life Iâve carried

When that days comes
Iâll be at peace
Donât weep for me
Bury me with my beliefs

They can bury my heart
But not love I Bled
Or the moments Iâve shared through the pain
They will bury my eyes
But not the visions that I followed into victory

When that days comes
My life will cease
Donât weep for me
Bury me with my beliefs

Bury me with my beliefs
Bury me with my beliefs
When that day comes
My life will cease
Bury me with my beliefs

Let the message be clear when all is said and done
Carry on with no pain inside
My body my be gone but my words will live on
So take this to heart donât drown in grief
KNOW I CHERISHED MY BELIEFS

Bury my weakness (but not my strength)
Bury my anguish (but not my faith)
Bury my envy (but not my trust)
Bury my failures (but not resolve)

When that days comes
Iâll be at peace
Donât weep for me
Bury me with my beliefs
When that days comes
My life will cease
Donât weep for me
Bury me with my beliefs

Bury me with my beliefs
Bury me with my beliefs
When that day comes
My life will cease
Bury me with my beliefs
Bury me with my beliefs
Bury me with my beliefs
When that day comes
My life will cease
Bury me with my beliefs
