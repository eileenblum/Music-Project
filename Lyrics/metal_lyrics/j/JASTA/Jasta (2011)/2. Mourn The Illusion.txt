Without fall, no soul, here they choose to consume and the fear out
To cease, our world, final glimpse of the tragedy here now
Our ghost's just drifting through the call
Rise on the horizons as it falls
I have become one with the way of the cross at the crossroad
My past, disdain for the secrets I save from denial

Now I mourn the illusion
Our ghost's just drifting through the call
I saw the horizon as it falls, alone, go as it falls
I feel the scourge, torn deep to the bone
I am the scorn, now i mourn the illusion

I gouge my eyes from the inside, I was never alone
I gouge my eyes from the inside, I was never alone
I gouge my eyes from the inside, I was never alone
I gouge my eyes from the inside, I was never alive

Our ghost's just drifting through the call
I saw the horizon as it falls, alone, go as it falls
I feel the scourge, deep to the bone
I am the scorn, so now i mourn the illusion.
