Iâve got the fists of a fighter
Heart of a warrior
Scars of a soldier
And the hands of a working man
Iâve got the fists of a fighter
Heart of a warrior
Scars of a soldier
And the hands of a working man

Thereâs something to be said of the gutter
Thereâs something to be said of the grave
Thereâs something to be said for the better
Iâm just trying to find my fucking way
Iâve never been perfect
But who the fuck are you to judge
This is how I release my rage
I give absolutely no fucks

Iâve got the fists of a fighter
Heart of a warrior
Scars of a soldier
And the hands of a working man

You still question my choices
Always talking but have nothing to say
You kept taking the worst and the best out of me
When the tide wasnât turning my way
If I was homeless
If I was dead or in a fucking cell
You wouldnât shed one fucking tear
I know the story all to well

Iâve got the fists of a fighter
Heart of a warrior
Scars of a soldier
And the hands of a working man
Iâve got the fists of a fighter
Heart of a warrior
Scars of a soldier
And the hands of a working man

Iâve got the fists of a fighter
Heart of a warrior
Scars of a soldier
And the hands of a working man
