Itâs Starting again
Itâs so vivid
Same disdain
Same results
You expect different
Itâs a weakness
Now the mirrors deceptive

Condemned to live
Horror Lies Within
In the end
You walk that Path alone
FUCK

Take the deepest look into your eyes
You think Iâll stand above your grave and cry?
This life is for the living
And now I choose to survive

Condemned to live
Horror Lies Within
In the end
You walk that path
You walk that path
You walk that path alone

YOU WALK THAT PATH ALONE

Alone in the womb
Alone in the world
Alone in the grave
In your fucking grave
Alone in the womb
Alone in the world
Alone in the grave
In your grave
Alone
You walk that path alone
FUCK
