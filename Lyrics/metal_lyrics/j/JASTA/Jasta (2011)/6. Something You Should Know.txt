[feat. Phil Labonte]Now I say all my goodbyes,
Sever one more time, moments can't define
Seize just what tomorrow holds
Patience touches grace, anger must escape

There's just something you should know (you should know)
What you've said brought me to the end of my rope
There's just something you should know (you should know)
Not once more will you strangle all my hope

If you let resentment rise,
You shut off from hope, life just cannot grow
Know your enemies for sure
Know the blame you place, is it in good faith

Do you wish another 100 days of sorrow,
When you look back inside I know you feel hollow
Haunting, so real, such an apathetic outlook
Just one second of your life can change the future

There's just something you should know (you should know)
What you've said brought me to the end of my rope
There's just something you should know (you should know)
Not once more will you strangle all my hope

There's just something you should know (you should know)
What you've said brought me to the end of my rope
There's just something you should know (you should know)
Not once more will you strangle all my hope
