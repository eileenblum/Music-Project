Another fallen angel
Headed toward a violent end
The mirror only showing
Hypocrisy as it appears
Begging for a death
That will will come to those in vain
Welcome the abyss again
Broken vows and mothers tears

Death bestowed
Death bestowed

So many spoke
So many feared
That this would come to pass
Burning the hands that give you life
Taking the voice of what was left
Of everything that they heard
The truth now is much much worse
A victimâs coward and a vermin's rat
A scapegoat for the curse

Death bestowed
Upon the heretic
Death bestowed
Upon hypocrisy
Death bestowed
Upon the innocent

There one lies, unconfined
There only one lies
Free and unconfined
Death has been bestowed
Upon what the mirror shows

Death bestowed
