It never ends,
I hear their whispers.
I feel the stares Iâve seen the reaction.
I let it go, I know the consequence.
Their reasons are just full of fucking ignorance.

If weak minds are filled with judgement,
Itâs out of our control.
We know that they will not accept us,
the fearless must endure.

They say we're reckless, we act in haste.
We have bitter minds, but they think they hate.
They say weâre senseless, and self-obsessed.
In their own reflection is the thing they detest.

If weak minds are filled with judgment,
Itâs out of our control.
We know that they will not accept us,
the fearless must endure.
And when we try to reach for something,
beyond all that is known.
They hate that we continue forward,
they surrendered long ago.

If fear is for people who try to change for the dreamer,
then the fearless spirit will always find a way.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Who's walking fearless?

If weak minds are filled with judgment,
Itâs out of our control.
We know that they will not accept us,
the fearless must endure.
If weak minds are filled with judgment,
Itâs out of our control.
We know that they will not accept us,
the fearless must endure.
And then we try to reach for something,
beyond all that is known.
They hate that we continue forward,
they surrendered long ago.
