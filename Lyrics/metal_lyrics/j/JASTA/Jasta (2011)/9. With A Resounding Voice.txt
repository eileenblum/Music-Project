DISTANCE

Closing paths from the mind
There is no coincidence
Shadows stranded in the night
Sudden fate playâs a hidden hand

Condemned, you see the world
Youâre heartless by choice

With a resounding voice
Behold what you can become
Now take beneath the earth
And leave what you trust is wrong
With a resounding voice
Behold what must become
Now take beneath the earth
Deny the desolation

Align yourself with something more
Expose your light beyond the deepest woes
Come from a place of abundant strength
Yours is the blood of courage now

DISTANCE
Closing paths to the mind

With a resounding voice (voices)
Behold what you can become
Now take beneath the earth (taken)
And leave what you trust is wrong
With a resounding voice (voices)
Behold what you must become
Now take beneath the earth (taken)
Deny the desolation

Condemned, you see the world
Youâre heartless by choice

I unite myself with grace beyond your desolation
Put aside the woes of the world to revel in the glory of your own
