Last night I went where dreams go to die
And I set it ablaze
The coldest thing I ever realised
That this was almost never ment to be

With every peice of my desperation
I'm drawn into the endless divide
And when i dwelt beneath the shadows
I prayed your heartache would survive

The one thing on which i rely
is the thing i would deny
Now that place is taken
You used my trust to mortify

Screams from the sanctuary
embody the deadliest sins
Believe when i stand before you
Now pray into the empty night

I prayed your heartache would survive
Survive forever
I prayed your heartache would survive
Survive forever beneath me

Stare into a blessed time
Of perfection and disgrace
Now that place is taken
Feel every peice of my desperation

Screams from the sanctuary
embody the deadliest sins
Believe when i stand before you
Now pray into the empty night

Screams from the sanctuary
embody the deadliest sins
Believe when i stand before you
Now pray into the empty night

I prayed your heartache would survive
Survive forever
I prayed your heartache would survive
Survive forever beneath me

Last night I went where dreams go to die
And I set it ablaze
The coldest thing I ever realised
That this was almost never ment to be

I prayed for your heartache to survive forever
I prayed for your heartache to survive forever
