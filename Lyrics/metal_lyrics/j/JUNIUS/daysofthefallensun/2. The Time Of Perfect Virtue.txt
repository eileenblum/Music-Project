We are followers of the law of one, unite
Waiting for the days of the fallen sun to return the fire
We'll accept our fate when the glory comes to wipe us out

You will see the fear inside both you and me
We will flee into the darkest corners to dissolve

Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
We will repeat, we will repeat, we will
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
We will repeat, we will, we will repeat

It's time for a rebirth in fire
The end is near

We are the great divide in the form of a heart and the first mistake
Don't deny the light that was formed in the fire
Keep your eyes open

There is nothing we can do
God is in everything
Breathing in you, breathing in me
I'm waiting for everyone else to see what we are

You will see the fear inside both you and me
Embrace defeat when we will fall to our knees and scream

Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
We will repeat, we will repeat, we will
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
We will repeat, we will, we will repeat
