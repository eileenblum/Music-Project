We've burned up all the choirs that sang for our hearts and souls
The shadow owns the sun and the dark is coming to crawl upon us all
We don't have the right to call out for help this time
We will have to hide to come out alive

We will writhe, endless night, pray for sunlight
We divide over signs, breakdown your life

You fall upon your knees and scream for release
Calling out for hours
No one hears a sound
Calm yourself to hold on
Hurt yourself to wake up

We will writhe, endless night, pray for sunlight
We divide over signs, breakdown all night

We all fear, going blind
We're all fearless when we're not alone

We will writhe, endless night, pray for sunlight
We divide over signs, breakdown your life
