Our days of Gods are in the past,
We're roaming through the fire,
We're feeding off each other,
The strong survive.

They say the Sun will return
And bring back all the life
We're feeding off the herd
I want to die.

The Eye of God was all ours
We bathed in light
You showed us how to love
And then you took all our lives [3x]

The turning of tides
You took our shorelines
I curse the divine
And then you took all our lives

If I'm the one you want
I'll be your sacrifice
I'll kneel before the gods
And burn alive

The flames start to rise
I've never own my life
But this pain is all mine

All rise
I'm burning for you now

And then you took all our lives

We are the dreams of gods
We are the lights that followed
We have embraced the dark
We hold the light, we are the fire
