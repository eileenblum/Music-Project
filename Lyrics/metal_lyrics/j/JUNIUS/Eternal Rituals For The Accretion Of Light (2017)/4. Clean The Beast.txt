Tend the spirit, take from the innocent
Measure the heart, by the weight of its contents
Bend the coil, break down the objects
Feather and soul are lost in the process

Were the sun on the rise, shine our light in you
We devote, we devote, we devour all you
Break... I'm beloved
Burn... I'm the one
Bleed... with the knife
Bloomâ¦ in you

A cleanser, a shaman will read from their tomes
The scarabs will burrow through the eye of a weak skull

Devotion through silence, a strong back provides
The wheat from the chaff, the pain to purify

Gather the monochrome light
A great flower unfolds
Process, the eight tones ignite
At the feet of the pharaohs

Can you feel it?
Can you go?
Can you feel it?
Can you give up?

That which bends, break it down
That which breaks, burn it down
That which bends, break it down
That which withers, seal its tomb

Were the sun on the rise, shine our light in you
We devote, we devote, we devour all you
Break... I'm beloved
Burn... I'm the one
Bleed... with the knife
Bloomâ¦ in you

A sacred invite, an all-knowing eye
A sanctified life, will burn just fine
Your safety relies on self-control
Your pineal flowers when you let go
(Bend. Break. Burn. In bloom. Tend. Take. Turn. Entomb.)

The sacred in violence, an all-knowing life
A sanctified crime devours on sight
You safety defies the self's desires
Your pineal cowers when you confide
