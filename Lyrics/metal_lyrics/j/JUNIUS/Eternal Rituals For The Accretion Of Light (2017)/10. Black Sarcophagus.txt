Seal the room, light the fire
Burning clothes, the energy starts to flow

I am what I've learned, I meditate
My body shakes, the room starts to glow

Pouring over me, high frequencies
The final hour, oh the pain, I'm devoured

The bearer of light, the primal tones
Take my flesh and let me go

The final march, the seventh step
The death of this dream has come

All I have loved, all I have held
Has led to the sea of one
All I have loved, all I have held
Has led to the song of souls

Send me up now
Send me up now
Send me up now
I'm ready for time to die
I'm ready for infinite eyes
