Once we hid in the night
Now our time has come
Flames fall all around
Let them sift through our love

Brave young, they will burn the night
Brave lies, they have found us out
Brave young, we are trapped alive
Brave love, won't you spare us?

From room to room, we try and flee
Our end is close...

Brave young, they will burn the night
Brave lies, they have found us out
Brave young, we are trapped alive
Brave love, won't you spare her now?
