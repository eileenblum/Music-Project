All my life I've begged for this
And now my name is on your lips
Hand me hell and let me in
A serpent's touch from end to end

Can you fill the void with all of your light?
Can you bring the sound of love?

We will fill your silence with our timeless sateless truth
We will fill your silence while we bind ourselves to you

Just say to me, we're the one true love
Just say to me, I'm the one you want

I have to face the knout, the pyre
My life is yours, I'm ready to break out

I am the son of no one
I am in search of meaning
I am the last to suffer
I am the fear in healing
