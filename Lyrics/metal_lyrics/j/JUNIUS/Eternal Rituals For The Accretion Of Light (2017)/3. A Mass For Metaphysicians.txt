Pray for our love, heal thyself
Holes for our eyes, we are bound

Analyze, sacrifice, live forever
We begin again bound
Idolize, magnify, fall in the black
Unbind
Analyze, sacrifice, live forever
We have become bound
Idolize, magnify, fall in the black

You have to feed us to see the beast (lost in the lie)
You have to give up and be the feast (lost in the lie)

Lost in life, we blind to see
All we know will set you free

I want blood on my hands, a violence to face
I need you to wash me away, gouge my eyes

Take me farther down the corridors through every chamber,
At the centers of absolute power
I will course through the veins of the other
Should it tear me apart, take me over
I will reverse the forces of nature
I will turn every thought towards surrender
I will burn with the flames of the alter
I will become the starlight
