You can't explain why your whole life
is lying down on this shoreline
You feel no pain
Just float above

All live and let go
See from above
We all shall float as one

You don't have that hole in your heart
It was a dream
It haunted you
It's haunting me
Fall out of harm

I can't explain why your whole life
decided to fall before my eyes
Now the pain remains
as you drift away
I know I'll get through
you feel so far
I know I'll see you again

Wait! Oh! Wait now!
