Leaving life behind
Drawn into the night
We've known unrest
One life left undone
will cling to fear
No release
No hope, controls
Break through to finalize

We are afraid to embrace the change
that we are falling toward
We have to face our fear of pain, then
we will be reborn
We fall across the void
Return the soul reborn

Warmth from life
entranced by the night
Return me to this love
I want truth
Show in me
There was always love
I'll divide into the prime
Take my life
