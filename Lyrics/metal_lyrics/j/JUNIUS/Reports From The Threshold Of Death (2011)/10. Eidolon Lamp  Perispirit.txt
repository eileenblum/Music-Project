Once you're numb
I will see you through the night
I will come
So follow me into the deepest hues
and all I know is yours

Just bring me into your love
Just bring me into your night
Just bring me into your light

Its better than you know
We're ready for you now

Don't hide
Just bring me into your love
Just bring me into your night
Just bring me into your light
Just bring me into you

Thanks to unmourned for sending track #5 lyrics.
