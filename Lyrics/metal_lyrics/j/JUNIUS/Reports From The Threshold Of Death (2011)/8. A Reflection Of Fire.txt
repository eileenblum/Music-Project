A fire's design calms me down
with guiding light
I can see
all my desires
I'm devoured
We all atone

A fire's design calls me out
with blinding light
I can see
all of the lies
I've inspired
We all atone

Pray for fire
Dark lives
We have to fall
Love lost
Pray for night
One spark
Bring your light
Save us all

We are the lost
starving hearts
We all fall
Just get up and get out
Call the fire

You've done it before
Climb the pyre
On all fours

One
last
cold
night
