Wait and you'll find us
The comfort of ghosts
Time unites all

Go where the haunted bloom
Rejoin and re-flower
Go where there's only truth
Rejoice in the spires

All we've known is finite
Don't sell your soul for time
As we show all what we've loved
We'll climb the light

And you'll hold the ones you've lost
In time
We all survive
