Everyone holds on
Everyone calls out the same way
It's time to shed life
You have arrived, welcome to the divide
We fade out
You have arrived, welcome to your design
We're the ones you seek

Crawl up to me
We've seen you bleed
You've hated yourself
Created your hell
It's over you'll see

You have arrived, welcome to the divide
Wade out
You have arrived, welcome to your design
Wade out

We've watched you love
We've caught you enough
We've watched you fall
We want you with us
Save yourself
Leave your hell
It's over you'll see

You're on the rise
and you're bleeding out
You are the one
and you forgave everyone.
