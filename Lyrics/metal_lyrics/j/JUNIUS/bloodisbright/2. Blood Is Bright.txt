I take the light and break through
I'm a million years and you're new
It's common place for them to
Control our discourse
Without a voice or figure
I appear to the weak and obscure
It's a war with what we've known
It's the coming clouds and the places we can't go

Wake up all the feelings that you hold inside
About those fallen lives that call to all of us
Forget all the fighting and the focused lies
It's about the brilliant lights that follow all of us

I breed in all the darkest places
Control all the foul and faceless
While the blood is bright the form
And silence the conscious
I appear in the palest moonlight
I'm a part of the fallen night sky
It's a war with what we've known
It's the violent times and the faces we can't know

Wake up all the feelings that you hold inside
About those fallen lives that call to all of us
Forget all the findings on your photographs
It's about the brilliant guise that troubles all of us

Wake up all the feelings that you hold inside
You know what we are
Born forlorn

Forget all the baiting and the brilliant lights
You know what you are
Born forlorn
