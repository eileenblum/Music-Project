Prepare yourself to face the coming change!
Wake up defiant and warn the others

Wake up the fire inside your voices!
We are defined by what we inspire...

Remembering the end of the world... brings me restless nights
Calling me from above, a choir recites: "Change is coming!"

And I awaken the fire inside my voice
I tremble and shake as it fills the void
The day turns into night... I am catastrophe

We are fire in form, and I want to wake myself, make myself
Rise up, rise up to fall...
Why don't you lay it down, lay it down on the line
And then we will rise!

Living in the dirt, breathing in my worth
Make no mistake, this is my rebirth

Before the days of the cataclysm, we obeyed the law of one
We just wanted to breath, we wanted to be...

We are the sons of war, married to a past so violently ignores
(So I) Face my imperfect desires, waiting for the age to expire

We are fire in form, and I want to wake myself, make myself
Rise up, rise up to fall...
Why don't you lay it down, lay it down on the line
And then we will rise!

"The story of human memory of catastrophes that took place in historical times, strangely-despite the fact that they were described in so many sources- is as if non-existent for the scientific world..."
