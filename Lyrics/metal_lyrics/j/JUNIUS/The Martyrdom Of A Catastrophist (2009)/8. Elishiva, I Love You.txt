On the night that we met, the feelings of dread...
We knew it'd be hard, god I love the regret
My work is all I know, I swear when I am done
Out life can be as one, but we just have to...

Wait, for the time when we're right
I can feel it inside
My god we've waited so long
This time we took, we'll go far

We're born to follow with heart and soul
And so we're torn and it's so hard to hold
Now we're scared to find out the heights of love
Because it's so high and we're so far up

the patience we have shown
No others can fare
Our story is the one only few can compare
We will both exchange a smile
When we tell the kids our trials
this is what we have inspired

No matter what our fate
I will always be yours
On those days I turned away
You were always my world

Wait, for the time when we're right
I can feel it inside
My god we've waited so long
This time we will go far
