Why don't you come home?
Why don't you come alone?
Why don't you try...

How'd you get lost? I want you to know
I will always decide, to be by your side
Wait now... We wanted to find out why you won't...

Wake up, wake up, dear sir! (You're ready to go...)
Wake up, wake up, it's done!
Go home tonight! (She's waiting there, all alone...)

I don't want to give up on life
So I'm spending my time in patient isolation

I've fallen so hard, left the one I care about in the dark
It's nothing more than a selfish pain
I've kept for too long, it's time to let go
I'm on my way home...
to get back what we've lost
Wait for me now... Waiting all night
