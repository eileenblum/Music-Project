I've waited to face the world on a stage
My time is now... I answer to Sariel
The Order attacks at will, there's blood to spill

Wage war!
Lay down your life, to the night sky
They're waiting for just one world

They're digging my grave, while I stare away
As the starlit sky... I answer to Sariel
They hold me under the ground, as I'm screaming out

Please help me through this time...
Please give me one more sign
How can you deny?
When I gave my life!

All of my life, I've waited to rise
They hold my heart, for sacrifice
So I call out to...
