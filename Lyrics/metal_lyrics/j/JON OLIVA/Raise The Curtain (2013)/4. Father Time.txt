I am the father
I am the keeper of time
I live inside of you
My hands you don't need to wind

I am the father of time
Call me the father of time

I watch the clocks for you
I put the lines on your face
I'm moving quickly
You try to slow down my pace

I am the father of time

Father time
Watch the skies
Father time
Never ever lies
As your years fly by

I am the father
I am the father of time
I twist your souls around
I control all of your lives

I am the father of time
Call me the father...

Father time
Watch the skies
Father time
Never ever lies
As your years fly by
