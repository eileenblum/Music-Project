I can't lie, I see why you are this way
Your feelings released, now you're blinded by hate
I don't know if you'll change, that's just your way
Unbearable existence, life in chains

Looking through despair and pain - can't you see, can't you see
Looking through your eyes again - you're so blind, so blind
Looking through despair and pain - can't you see, can't you see
Looking through your eyes again - you're so blind, so blind

You divide, deep inside, living in vain
You rationalize and you believe all your lies
How can you feel what it's like inside your cage
Unbearable existence, life in chains

Looking through despair and pain - can't you see, can't you see
Looking through your eyes again - you're so blind, so blind
Looking through despair and pain - can't you see, can't you see
Looking through your eyes again - you're so blind

It wasn't me, still reflecting the walls
It got me going when distant mirrors bent the angled halls

So who's judgement is right...
With which excuse am I selling tonight?

The more I seem to know, judge and jury
The less my image grows
I may have caught a glimpse of myself in error
Or was it your reflection

Well, that's what I think
That's what I said
That's what I meant
So get over it

You beg to differ
So make your case and make it now
The truth is not our own
To twist and spin around

I want to learn from my own reflections
I need to know it's not obscured with your intensions
Not even for a moment

Well, that's what I think
That's what I said
That's what I meant
So get over it

I can't lie, I see why you are this way
Your feelings released, now you're blinded by hate
I don't know if you'll change, that's just your way
Unbearable existence, life in chains

Looking through despair and pain - can't you see, can't you see
Looking through your eyes again - you're so blind, so blind
Looking through despair and pain - can't you see, can't you see
Looking through your eyes again - you're so blind
