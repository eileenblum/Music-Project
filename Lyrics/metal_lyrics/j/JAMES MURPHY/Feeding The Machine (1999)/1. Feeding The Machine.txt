An overwhelming thing that couldn't be
That could be this voice, controlling me
I'll sit alone, not without company
Thoughts that don't pass they reside inside

Can it be the voice inside me
Taking control of all that will and will not be
Hopes will be feeding the machine

Always fighting through the days
To make the chance that I must take
Don't live back in yesterdays
For time won't wait to lead us the way

I'm choking on thought, it flows without sympathy
Driving force from within, no stop
I cannot deny this thing that's a part of me
So I work for the cause, it just must be

Always fighting through the days
To make the chance that I must take
Don't live back in yesterdays
For time won't wait to lead us the way

As I look back upon all this in front of me
I understand why it made my mind
