After all these years discovery's not blind
Unsubstantial fears twisted in my mind
In my mind...

Through my darkest hour, spectral plane empowered
Incandescent light... astral beams at night

They want to take you - and try to break you - examinate you

Visitors in the darkness
Carry me into the light
Visitors always around us
Have they invaded our lives
Our lives

After all these years discovery's not blind
Incandescent light... astral beams at night

They want to take me - they try to break me - examine, rape me

Visitors in the darkness
Carry me into the light
Visitors always around us
Have they invaded our lives
Our lives

Through my darkest hour, spectral plane empowered
Incandescent light... astral beams at night

They want to take you - and try to break you - examinate you

Visitors in the darkness
Carry me into the light
Visitors always around us
Have they invaded our lives
