Lost - a life that's lost beyond the hope of turning back
Fate - you chose your fate when you walked blindly down that path
Never heed the voice of reason ringing in your ears
Cost - you'll pay the cost when the reckoning draws near

Never listen to the truth that stares you in your face
You look and you don't see, but we'll soon see who's laughing last
Always make the same mistakes
The crime is self deceit, you learned no lessons from your past

Blind - you never see the truth before your eyes
Fear - you'll feel the fear that keeps you running for your life
Never faced reality but now you're gonna see
Hate - you breed the hate that slowly brings you to your knees

Never listen to the truth that stares you in your face
You look and you don't see, but we'll soon see who's laughing last
Always make the same mistakes
The crime is self deceit, you learned no lessons from your past

No one knows what you believe
No one can tell you what to see
No one knows your mind like you
No one can tell you

Lost - a life that's lost beyond the hope of turning back
Fate - you chose your fate when you walked blindly down that path
Never heed the voice of reason ringing in your ears
Cost - you'll pay the cost when the reckoning draws near

Never listen to the truth that stares you in your face
You look and you don't see, but we'll soon see who's laughing last

Never faced reality but now you're gonna see
Hate - you breed the hate that slowly brings you to your knees

Never listen to the truth that stares you in your face
You look and you don't see, but I'm the one who's laughing last
Always make the same mistakes
The crime is self deceit, you learned no lessons from your past

No one knows what you believe
No one can tell you what to see
No one knows your mind like you
No one can tell you
No one knows what you believe
No one can tell you what to see
No one knows your mind like you
No one can tell you
