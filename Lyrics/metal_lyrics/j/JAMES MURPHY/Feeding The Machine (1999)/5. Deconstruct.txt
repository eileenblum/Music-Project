Been least 40 days and 40 nights since I've been found
A dark and empty place that holds one thing and it's me
Held up in this frozen state, I'm stuck and I won't move
I think but don't think anymore, not anymore

Recently I've fallen
To my knees I'm falling

Deconstructing everything that would become of me
Killing any chance that I might have
A chance that I will be the one, the only one to stand
To stand atop my destiny, come laugh with me

Recently I've fallen
To my knees I'm stalling

Deconstruct this life
Broken dream is mine
Deconstruct this life
Broken dream is mine

Recently I've fallen to my knees, I'm stalling
Taste the fear, it's calling out to me, I'm wanted
Recently I've fallen to my knees, I'm stalling
Taste the fear, it's calling out to me, I'm wanted

Been least 40 days and 40 nights since I've been found
A dark and empty place that holds one thing and it's me
Held up in this frozen state, I'm stuck and I won't move
I think but don't think anymore, not anymore

Recently I've fallen to my knees, I'm stalling
Taste the fear, it's calling out to me, I'm wanted

Deconstruct this life
Broken dream is mine
Deconstruct this life
Broken dream is mine
