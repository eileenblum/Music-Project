This life, and all the things I'd known
Turned away, and left behind
The truth was buried long ago
Memories fade in passing time

For years, I felt my solitude
Never seemed to leave my side
My way was lost forever then
All my dreams were cast aside

I turn away but the vision of truth stains my eyes
I try to run but the image cuts through my disguise

Beneath the emptiness, reveals my bitterness
I cannot soon forget, this dream's not over yet
In the land of my birth, I am still touching the earth

The fears that kept me far away
Slowly die and draw me near
The past I sought to bury deep
Comes again to fill my need

I cast away all the stones that carried me down
I will return to the life that my past tried to drown

Beneath the emptiness, reveals my bitterness
I cannot soon forget, this dream's not over yet
In the land of my birth, I am still touching the earth
