Where do I go from here
My thoughts are stuck within my ears

I can count on my mind
To let me down

Deeper within
The voices sound

Where do I crawl to now
My tongue betrays my mind somehow

I can count on my mind
To let me down

Deeper within
The voices sound

Can you...see my being
When you...look at me
Man you...twisted kind
Why I...see so blind

What do I want to be
Traded my legs for fruitless seeds

I can count on my mind
To let me down

Deeper within
The voices sound
