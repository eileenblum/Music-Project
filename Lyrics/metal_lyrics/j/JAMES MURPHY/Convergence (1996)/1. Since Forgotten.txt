It's not an ego
I'm not trying to mess you up
I just want to be where
Soon is never quick enough

So I'm feeling what I feel
(But maybe that's because I'm just a...)
just a little tired of being used
(You get it? You hearing me when I say...)

Hey now you losers
What's in this for me?
I'm only after what I feel should be mine anyway

So cut it, cut it...(you keep the cut, you keep...)
Cutting, cutting...(can't cut the noise that keeps...)
Coming, coming...(because it won't stop...)
Running, running...(it will never stop...)

Because every time I open myself to a friend
I always leave my trust to take
But now I swear to you that this will never happen again
And to myself... I'm sorry for it all
