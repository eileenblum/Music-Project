I fail to be (what you need from me)
I fail to see (what I fail to be)

I don't need your help
or need your sympathy
...I think it's time you found somebody else

When everybody's gone
You'd best be moving on
...I think it's time you found somebody else

I'll fail to be (what you need from me)
I'll never see (what you need to see)

It never shall refrain
It always comes again
It's nice to know you're easily entertained

I'm glad to treat you right
comfort in the night
It's good to see you're easily entertained

Why does this always happen?
I never meant to be a social call
Whatever happened to everybody else?
Sometimes I feel like the last one...

You don't like what I do? Then keep me away
This little contribution won't make a difference to me anyway
So don't push me, I've got nothing to lose

Cut it to the bone
I'll spend my time alone
I've found a way and now I'm going home

So don't try to make me be
What you can never be
I've found a way and now I'm going home...
