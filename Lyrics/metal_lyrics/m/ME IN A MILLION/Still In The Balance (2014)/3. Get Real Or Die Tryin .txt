[Chorus:]
I'm tryin'
I'm tryin' to get done again
I'm tryin'
But it's not as easy
As it seemed to be

Maybe it's time to get off the stick
Get your shit straight
Or it's over, that's it
Push yourself to the limit and
Don't just force to lose the day

Are you condemned to failure?

Are you condemned to failure or
Born to be great
Are you the chosen one
Or are you just another fake
Are you just another fake?

[Chorus:]
I'm tryin'
I'm tryin' to get done again
I'm tryin'
But it's not as easy
As it seemed to be

It's not as easy
As it seemed to be

What you wish to kindle in others
Must burn within yourself

So show me what you're made of
And don't start to panic
Show me what you're made of
Dedigitate

You still can sort out the mess
Dedigitate

[Chorus 2x:]
I'm tryin'
I'm tryin' to get done again
I'm tryin'
But it's not as easy
As it seemed to be
