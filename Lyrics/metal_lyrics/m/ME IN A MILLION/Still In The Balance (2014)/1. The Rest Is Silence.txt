(I'm beggin' to be heard)

Endless falling on deaf ears
Day after day
And all I'm trying to do
Is to be heard
Why don't you hear me out?
At least you should give it a try
Or am I speechless?
Is it really my fault
That you just refuse to listen to me?

[Chorus:]
I'm beggin' to be heard
Out, but you never listen
Though it's not
Supposed to be like that
But the unheard words I said
Are still locked inside my head
Searching for a sympathetic ear

By ignoring all of them
Stubborn as a mule
And you will never make them
Meaningless
(And still)

All I get is ignorance
Do I really deserve this?
Or is it just a bad thing nowadays
To seek happiness

Cause it's only the things that I say
The problems I bring up
You just don't wanna grapple with
It's much easier than
Taking over responsibility

[Chorus:]
I'm beggin' to be heard
Out, but you never listen
Though it's not
Supposed to be like that
But the unheard words I said
Are still locked inside my head
Searching for a sympathetic ear

Still I'm falling on deaf ears
Day after day
And all I'm trying to do
Is to be heard
Why don't you hear me out
At least you should give it a try
(Psst, silence)
Is it really my fault
That you just refuse to listen to me?

All you care about is you
You don't listen to me
All you care about is you
I'm sick of this shit

You piece of shit
