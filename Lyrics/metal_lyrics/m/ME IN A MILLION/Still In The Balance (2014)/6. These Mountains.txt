[Additional vocals by Tyler Carter of Issues]

Never lose faith
It doesn't matter who tells you
That you are not meant to be where you are
It makes no difference
Cause they are just cowards
Who don't understand what your purpose is

But you will prove them wrong
But you will prove them wrong
Don't lose your heart
This is the vision and you are a part of it

And I can be more that this
Even if you still don't have faith in me
I can move these mountains
I don't need your help with this
It's hard enough to realize
That the ones who should trust in you
Will never believe, will never believe,
In your capabilities

This is just like they are
Hypocrites everywhere
Blowing smoke up your ass
While stabbing you in the back

Lately I've been thinking: why am I still doing this to myself?

Block out what they say
It's unrefined talk, anyway
Block out what they say
They don't know shit about me

Don't give a fuck what they say

Every single word you say
Every single word you say
Is an insult to all that I stand for

To be honest I never really gave a shit 'bout you anyway
So why don't you save your breath
I block out what you say
Block out what you say

If this is what we've become
And this is how chapter one ends
The I'll be damned if I turn another page in this book
Don't wanna be your lover
I don't wanna be friends
It's hard enough to realize
That I can move these mountains
With or without you but I will
