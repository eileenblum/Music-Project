This is stretching me out to the limit
I am at risk to break
Under the weight of this
Help me out
Be my tower of strength

In a world that is all about
Taking care of yourself, I doubt
That a single one can make a difference without selling out
And still you're nothing without results
To be someone
You have to stand out of the crowd

In view of the big picture
I'm only a small cog in a big wheel
So how can an individual effect a miracle
Or make a difference at all
Go do the math
Learn to know yourself
Don't bail out
You are designed to succeed in this
Succeed in this!

Now the ball is in your court
Do the math
Don't be pathetic
Show what you're made of

Go ahead
It's your move
Now
Show what you're made of
