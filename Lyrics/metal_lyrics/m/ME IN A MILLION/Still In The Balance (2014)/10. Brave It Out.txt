This is a fleecy step
On our long-winded avenue to fame
So we don't regret
Receiving one set-back after another
We might be allowed
To smile back at our sheltered lives

A hundred percent are now badly needed
To give your right arm is the name of the game
Brave it out!
We just need to focus
Cause all our dreams are now within our reach

Not leaving this to chance

Decisions are made
And there is no going back
It's anyone's guess
If we make it or not
It's still in the balance
We'll try to fulfill our dreams
And no one will break our will

Don't listen to reason
It will be worth the time
(it will be worth it's while)

Before you can say knife
Brave it out

Together we have to set the hare running
To finally top-out a building
Obeying the voices of our hearts
A new chapter opened we walk this path

We've learned to walk it's time to run
We've learned to walk now it's time to run

Life is what you make it
May no one prove you wrong

Don't leave it to chance
