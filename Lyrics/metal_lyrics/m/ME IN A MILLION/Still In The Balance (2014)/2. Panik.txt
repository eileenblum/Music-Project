Is it the choices that we make?
Or is it just our abilities
That make us who we are?
That make us who the fuck we are
Though you might despise me
I am the one who shoulders the blame

[Chorus:]
For countless times we tried
The countless times we kept on
Eluding what is right
Gave us a hard time
And finally forced me to decide
We are searching for solutions
Where nothing can be found at all
Through those rose-tinted glasses
That made us see a lie

This is what we get from being naive
All the effort we spent
Is gone with the wind
Eeyo
There's no point in proceeding
No light at the end
No point in proceeding
No fight for the end

[Chorus:]
For countless times we tried
The countless times we kept on
Eluding what is right
Gave us a hard time
And finally forced me to decide
We are searching for solutions
Where nothing can be found at all
Through those rose-tinted glasses
That made us see a lie

And we're finally at the point again
Where this is slipping through our hands
So hard I try

[Chorus:]
For countless times we tried
The countless times we kept on
Eluding what is right
Gave us a hard time
And finally forced me to decide

Panik

It's the choices that we make
Not our abilities
