Today I had this vision on my mind of you
And me staring at the sun
And I, I'm pretty sure that all of our dreams are about to
Disappear as if they've never been there

How do you even know how I feel when you never let me in
You don't know what you did to me
And how could you? How should you?

Let me tell you once again
This is not the end
I'm just getting started
I won't tell you this again
Cause it's just the end
Of you and me

Tell me what you want from me now
Cause it's time to get real
You know I've had enough
I don't think you've realized the fact that
Nothing will ever be the same again
Cause you're already too far from me
And I'm already too far away from you

And every picture that reminds me of the things we did
Might disappear with every day you're out of sight, you're out of mind.
And all the memories we shared will never fade away.
