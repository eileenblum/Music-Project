Wake me up right now
Tell me it's not a dream
I want to believe
But it still feels unreal to me
I can't describe what it is
But it's stuck in my head
Like a record on repeat
That's too good to be true
And not longer just about me and you

[Chorus:]
Some things are so unreal
They're gonna hit you like a hurricane
(Hit you like a hurricane)
Not on your mind
They've been there all the time
They just used to be kept concealed
So never let your fears
Become your entity
Don't let them tell you to believe
That none of your dreams exist
That none of your dreams exist
That none of your dreams exist

Breathe
Collect yourself
Realize it's the truth
And you're wide awake
Face the fact
It's the next step you gotta take
You can be all that you wanted to be
So be what you want to be

[Chorus:]
Some things are so unreal
They're gonna hit you like a hurricane
(Hit you like a hurricane)
Not on your mind
They've been there all the time
They just used to be kept concealed
So never let your fears
Become your entity
Don't let them tell you to believe
That none of your dreams exist
That none of your dreams exist
That none of your dreams exist

They say hard work pays off
Which is how it's supposed to be
Right now I am about to overcome my fears
Remove the doubts that kept me down
I break these chains
I'm finally free
I'll never lose faith again
Never lose faith in myself

I used to hold so much doubt
That I thought I would never get out
My insecurities got the best of me
And I think I finally figured it out
Cause when the future seems uncertain
And your dreams you want to desert them
Believe in yourself
Hold your head up tall
Cause giving up now's the only way you'll fall

I won't feel unconfident
Never again
I'm so over it
I won't feel unconfident
