[Additional vocals by Shawn Christmas and Jeffrey Wellfare of Capture The Crown]

This might not be a wonder
To anyone else but us
From the moment we signed up for this
We knew it would be tough

This might not be a wonder
To everyone else outside
But the last time we checked we were at the wrong end of the line
But we can make it happen
Cause this time we're not alone
And we're not going back
And we're not going back to the point where we came from

This might not be a wonder
To those who believed in us
When I'm thinking of all the other ones
It only makes me laugh
And I'll never stop

We're never going back to the point where we came from!
