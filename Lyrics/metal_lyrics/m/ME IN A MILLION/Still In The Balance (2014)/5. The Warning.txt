Every now and then,
You wake up and you know that you gotta move
So please don't get me wrong
After every trade-off it's time to play by my rules

And I won't let you decide what to aim for
Or what to disregard
This ain't none of your beeswax!
Not a scrap!
If fact your ignorance won't even change a thing
It only makes me motivate myself from deep inside
Instead of hindering me, by mistake you make me rise
I can be king of the world

If you really think, that I would leave here without what I came for...
(I came here to go for the win)
...then I'm afraid I'll have to tell you again:
I won't bury my head in the sand
I would do anything, I would do anything
So please don't offer things that don't mean shit to me
No, you won't break me down
Not for the life of me, not for the life of me

Not for love, nor cash, I'd let you pull the strings
Cause when it comes to dreams I never fool around
You can scratch, you can bite, you can whine like a child
But you won't convince me to give in

Just cause you're loud doesn't mean that you're right
In the end it is still your priority not mine
Your priority not mine

Though I should be the only who knows
I may not be the one to know what's right for me
But every time you tell me not to try
I'm always doing better that I ever did
Seems like I am the only one who cares
Even if it's not the two of us against the world
So if you think that all is said and done
I rather wouldn't have you fighting here with me

This is the time to try
And this ain't the time for a compromise
I'm really begging you
I never wanted anything more than this
I never wanted, I never wanted
Anything more than this
And I would give my heart,
My soul, my everything
