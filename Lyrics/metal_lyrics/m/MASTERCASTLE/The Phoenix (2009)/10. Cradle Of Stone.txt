Autumn's fire is came
Burning on trees with dry voice
Red leafs fall down on (the) ground
I hear the voice of the stone 
Of the stone 

Water is falling 
From a leaden sky 
Wood tales are learning
Wild spirit of life
Swallows are flying 
From that metal sky 
Away to the sun 

(the) voice of the wind is loud
Hear it on (the) wings of storms
Forest's voice is alone
We sleep into a cradle of stone

Water is falling 
From a leaden sky 
Wood tales are learning
Wild spirit of life
Swallows are flying 
From that metal sky 
Away to the sun
