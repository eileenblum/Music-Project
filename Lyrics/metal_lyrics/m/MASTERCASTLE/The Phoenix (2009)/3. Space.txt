Don't you tell that you can understand
Let me walk this road of mystery 
Don't you tell that you can understand
I just want to cross this lonely land again 

I'm free to run so fast 
I'm free to breath again 
(at) the other side of the border

This land,i'will see it in my dreams
You will see it in your dreams
We will cross this mistery
Into the space
A new sun will light the way 
A free mind don't loose the flame
Are you ready for the game
Into the space

There's no time to loose you have to run 
Sand of time has changed our destiny 
Let's go far away from earth and war
I just want to cross this lonely land again
