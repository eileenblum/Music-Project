The evening comes on your efforts
Malice and spites
Won't pull you down
No more no more

My arms are strong my love is warm
The sleep comes to shelter you
So slow so slow

Your eyes are closing 
On the deep
Your lips are smiling
To mistery

I sing a noir lull
Over (the) clouds and the storm
I sing a noir lull
From the abyss to the sky 
Sleep no more fears
Will come to hurt you 
I'm here to hold you

The night is come 
The silence grows
Envy and cold 
Won't pull you down 
No more no more
