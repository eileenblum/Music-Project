Rain falls so deep
We're running to the hill
Hold me close 
Hand in hand 
We are blowing away
Oh we are riding the night

By our minds
I was just a child
Wild as my life
We own those hight hills
Hidden by dark fog
Crossed by black oacks

Swear we'll be united forever
You always told me
I kiss your words on your lips
Swear you'll let nobody kills
Any your dreams
Don't be afraid

Rain falls so deep
Now on the hill 
The dawn comes 
Hand in hand 
We are blowing away
Oh we run through the night

By our minds
I was just a child
Wild as my life 
I'm looking for that hill
Hidden by dark fog
Crossed by black oacks

Swear we'll be united forever
You always told me
I kept my promise alive
Swear you'll let nobody kills
Any your dreams
Don't be afraid

Rain falls so deep 
We're running to hill 
Hold me close 
Hand in hand
We are blowing away
Oh we run through the night 

Rain falls so deep 
We're running to the hill 
Hold me close
Hand in hand 
We are blowing away 
Oh we run through the night
