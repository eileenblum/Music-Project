There's a fire burnin' in me 
There's a mistery 
In the dark side of my soul 

Don't you tell me how to move 
How to leave and sting 
I'm so tired of pretensions 

Holdin on 

Uh my sweet lonelyness 
Will ever be
My sweet lonelyness the darkest cage
Going up again i feel stronger thought the night
And i walk alone 

You never want to trust in me 
Never let me be 
You never care about you words

Uh my sweet lonelyness
Will never be
My sweet lonelyness the darkest cage 
Going up again i feel stronger than you tonight 
And i walk alone
