Looking for a world of silent and speels
Coming from a crazy world of misery

Looking for a world of silent and speels 
Coming from a crazy world of misery

The night will come on broken dreams 
But the way you walk is 
On the voice of the wind,
It takes you away

The phoenix is growing

Waiting for the byte of viper
To born again 
Without the chains of history 

The night will come on broken dreams
But the way you walk is 
On the voice of the wind,it takes you away

The phoenix is growing
On ashes
