Cry for the princess of love 
Cause she's burning 

Flying on the wings of my spell 
Paradise and dreams are not 
So far away
Some witches are dancing under me
The secret seems to break the
Rules again while fire is burning 

Cry for the princess of love 
Cause she's burning
And she rides the wind 

Now the dark teaches me what's the
Right way and passion makes me strong 
And hold to fly again 
I know the ground is hard and grief 
The secret is to break the rules 
Again while fire is burning

Cry for the princess of love 
Cause she's burning
And she rides the wind

Cry for the witch of your love
Cause you're burning
And you ride the wind
