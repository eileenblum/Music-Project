I've been to heaven with you
I've known hell with you

God I'm living on this world
But I feel all the pressure of a wild
Sensual dream

Too much of nothing around
The music plays aloud

But the silence that grows ever more
Deafening in my memories

We are fallin' under the spell of life and death

But in the darkness I feel you
I hear your voice from the past
Forgotten tales from the dust
But the sun always shines
And in the darkness I feel you
I feel only you
Inside my heart

Too many words to write
Too many words to hide

Sometimes I feel like an actress
In a suburb theatrical show
A show full of ghosts
Our time is running out
Like rain on the ground

We all just need more faith and a moonlight
Shining on our dark, lonely road

We are fallin' under the spell of life and death
