A dream always burns into my heart but
I walk alone along the canals
The sunset shines as a rich mask
On the lagoon

Shadows fall behind the corner
Elegance decay everywhere

People haunts me
I've got no peace
I just want to set my poor soul free

I feel lost and alone
In Venice there's dark and I'm cold
I'm just looking for a spark of hope

Red curtains hide my face from the light
In the hall of hotel (I'm) drinking adios
Wasting time, wearing another
Rich mask with an idiot

People haunts me
I've got no peace
I just want to set my poor soul free

I feel lost and alone
In Venice there's dark and I'm cold
I'm just looking for a spark of hope
