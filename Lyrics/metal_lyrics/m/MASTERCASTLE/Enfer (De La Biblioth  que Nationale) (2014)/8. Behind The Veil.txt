Your eyes are miles and miles away
Your smile is slowly fadin' away
I'm fallin' I lost the way
Cause you are miles away

Your eyes are miles and miles away
Your smile is slowly fadin' away
I'm fallin' but I realize
I will never forget
Your eyes and the way you laughed
When we were children

My eyes still see you everywhere
My mind don't understand the way
You're falling behind the veil
To reach and go nowhere

Life is a hard game to play
When love seems so far away
But we have the time to play
And to smile
Before turning off the light
And stop this fight

My eyes still see you everywhere
My mind don't understand the way
You're falling behind the veil
To reach and go nowhere

Life is a hard game to play
When love seems so far away
But we have the time to play
And to smile
Before turning off the light
And stop this fight
