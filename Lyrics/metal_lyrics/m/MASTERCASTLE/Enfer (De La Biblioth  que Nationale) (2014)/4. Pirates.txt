Summer sunsets burned
On my childhood bay
We walked on hot stones
We flew over the sea
The power of being kids
The world was a big ship
That crossed the deepest sea
We're pirates

A flower on my long dark hair
Your blue deep eyes shine
Now from so long
In memories

We've built a new home
With mud and dried leaves
Seated on the floor

We flew over the sea
The power of being kids
The world was a big ship
That crossed the deepest sea
We're pirates

A flower on my long dark hair
Your blue deep eyes shine
Now from so long
In memories
