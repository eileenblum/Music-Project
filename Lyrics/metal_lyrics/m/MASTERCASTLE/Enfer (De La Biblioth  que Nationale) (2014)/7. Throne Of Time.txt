Don't waste your time
'cause life is a thunder
Don't crash your dreams
Just to say yes

The princess is grown yeah
When she learn to say no
To build, to live my dream

Don't be afraid to face the night
It's worse to please and lost fight

The princess is grown yeah
When she learn to say no
To build, to live my dream
