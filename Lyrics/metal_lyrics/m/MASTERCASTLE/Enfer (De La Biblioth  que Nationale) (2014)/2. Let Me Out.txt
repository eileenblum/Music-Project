Trying to hold a cloud in the fist yeah it's hard
Powerlessness hate and lies all around
Dazzling false smiles as gloves on my skin
Feel like they bind arms and mind as
Just cannot touch (you)

Rage like sparks of a hidden fire
(I feel like) a wild wounded child
In the heat of the night
Come, save myself from this rage now
You got to let me out, let me out

Into the anger room (where)
You can't see any stars
There are loneliness malice
On the white walls around
(Mmm) poison at lunch scratches bleeding inside
Purple curtains to hide all trash they want hide

Rage like sparks of a hidden fire
(I feel like) a wild wounded child
In the heat of the night
Come, save myself from this rage now
You got to let me out, let me out
