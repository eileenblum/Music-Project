Into my cellar I breath
Scents of the past, a smell of the dust
But from that dust I grow
I paint my fears I draw my love, my love

With my paintbrush
I express parts of me
Shadow and light, in the canvas of my soul

Ashes oil coffee leaves
Inspiration calls the heat goes on
No pretty card no pink
The passion digs straight to the bone

With my paintbrush
I express parts of me
Shadow and light, in the canvas of my soul

Inspiration calls
And heat goes on
Inspiration calls
Straight to the bone

Inspiration calls
And heat goes on
Inspiration calls
Straight to the bone
Straight to the bone

With my paintbrush
I express parts of me
Shadow and light, in the canvas of my soul

Straight to the bone
Straight to
