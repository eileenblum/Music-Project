Follow the light
Don't be scared now
You will taste the paradise
The door is open
Smell of sour cream
Leave your human doubts outside
Come here and breath on me
Surrender to your shivers

Naked we can fly in a rainstorm
And I feel the beat so real the beat
On me we can fly
Touch on freedom (yearning)
Waiting

Let your hair down
Look inside me
It's a mystic sensual dream
Silk on the floor
Sweet and spicy
Don't forget to close your eyes
Oh come here and breath on me
Pleasure is a choosy teacher

Naked we can fly in a rainstorm
And I feel the beat so real the beat
On me we can fly
Touch on freedom
