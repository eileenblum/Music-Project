Take me with you
Into your castle, inside
I've seen a flame into your eyes
Take me with you and I will save you
From falling
I think that I hear you calling
Stones are like angels protect us
From sunrays
Shadows will take us straight
Straight to hell and to paradise

You will never be alone again
Cause I will hold your hand
We into the castle shade
Dark and lights are our stronger spell

Take me with you
Into your castle inside
I've heard you sing and cry
Take me with you

I will dry all your tears
With my lips, now I'm here

Stones are like angels protect us
From sunrays
Shadows will take us straight
Straight to hell and to paradise
