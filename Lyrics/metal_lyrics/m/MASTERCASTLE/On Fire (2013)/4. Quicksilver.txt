God of speed and mobility
Quick silver first in alchemy
Droops of grey earth and heaven
Life and death me and you

Toxic liquid poison of my soul
You're the planet closer to the sun
The snake that eats its head
Cause one is all
You're the mind
You're the speed

You unify duality
Toxic liquid poison of my soul
You're the planet closer to the sun
The snake that eats its head
Cause one is all
God of speed and mobility
