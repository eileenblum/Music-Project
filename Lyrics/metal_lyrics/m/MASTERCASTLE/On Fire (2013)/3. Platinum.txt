[feat. Roberto Tiranti]Why don't you see
Why don't you seen my light
Leaving all troubles behind
Why don't you come
Don't you come to me now
Look the horizon too far

Stop running around
As a crazy wild ghost
Life is a lipstick on glass

And I'm here
Hard as a smile
I seem so weak
But I have light and resistance
Look into my eyes
I'm platinum
Calling your name with a silent scream

Why don't you hear
Why don't you hear my voice
Letting all flowers get dried
Why don't you look
Don't you look into my eyes
Full of darkness and fire

Why don't you take
Why don't you take my hand
Into my arms you'll be safe

And I'm here
Singing to you
Hard as a smile
Passion flows quickly into my veins
Don't lose your time
I'm platinum
Calling your name with a silent scream

And I'm here
Hard as a smile
I seem so weak
But I have light and resistance
Look into my eyes
I'm platinum
Calling your name with a silent scream
