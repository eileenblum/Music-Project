Got you in my heart
The heat goes on when you're next to me
Lookin' into your eyes I loose
Connection with reality
'Cause you're fire burning me burning me down
And I'm lost but I feel but I feel wild

Chains
I feel into my heart iron of love
Don't leave me in the crowd
I want your touch
So cold and so proud
Your chains moving on all my skin
Iron and love we are locked up
High tension get it on
The chains of love
Don't you loose my bound
We are locked up the iron of love

Boots on the sand my steps sound
As a slowly wave today
Clouds on the sun
I hate to take off my glass anyway
I think of you burning me burning me inside
I am the sea I'm so rough shining down

Chains
I feel into my heart iron of love
Don't leave me in the crowd
I want your touch
So cold and so proud
Your chains moving on all my skin
Iron and love we are locked up
High tension get it on
The chains of love
Don't you loose my bound
We are locked up the iron of love
