There's a world into your eyes
There is the sun to light your way
All for you each day
There's a star in the darkest night
A drop of gold to make you smile
All for you tonight

When I'm with you baby
When I'm with you baby

I feel nothing else matter
I touch the moon and I feel
Nothing else matter
There are towns and cities around
Wind and rain to make you play
Just for you each day
There's the autumn with its gray
Silent snow on the way
Just for you each night

When I'm with you baby
When I'm with you baby

I feel nothing else matter
I touch the moon and I feel
Nothing else matter
I touch the moon
