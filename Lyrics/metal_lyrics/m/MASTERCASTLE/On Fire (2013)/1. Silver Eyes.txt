Wild she moves into the wood
It's too dark it's too dark
She has gold wild hair and a brave heart inside
With silver tears that she can't control

Rolling down to her cheeks
Sliding down to her lips
Dry on their own again
Dry without any helping hand
Silver eyes

The moon is rising over the threetops
Shines on shines on
The emotions flow as a river of time
Silver rays shine on her skin

Try to forget any hurting hand
Breaking any cold chain
Chase away any bad spell
Crush down any fucked wall
Silver eyes
Silver eyes

Rolling down to her cheeks
Sliding down to her lips
Dry on their own again
Dry without any helping hand
Silver eyes
