Everyday on the highway I bite all of my time
Going there coming here driving around and around
Into my car I let the dreams grows
Think of what it will be
While the sunset lights my windscreen
Uh this light dazzles my eyes

I lead my heart on leaden roads
Think of what I've lost
I hear your voice on radio
Warming my mind
Pass beyond countries and fields
But my thoughts are lost
(In)to another world

When the darkness come
(There're) blue trees all around
I still hear your voice flowing into my veins
What I've done and who I've known now
Seems so far from here
I forget any their word
Uh... take my hand and we'll reach for the sky

Lead my voice on silver roads
For sure what I've lost don't touch my soul
You warm my mind
(The) dreams are come the light is up
With this strength I know
We will born again
Lead my voice on silver roads
For sure what I've lost don't touch my soul
You warm my mind
(The) dreams are come the light is up
With this strength I know
We will born again
