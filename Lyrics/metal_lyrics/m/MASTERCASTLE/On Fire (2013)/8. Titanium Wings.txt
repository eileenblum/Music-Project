I feel I have to live home
I've got to paint all my hands
To paint all my skin
To paint all my breath

I walk all over your shows
I have to sing all my strength
The one way I know
Is to touch your wings

I fall in love once again
I don't need your titanium ring
I fall in love with your bites
I want your titanium wings

Don't matter where I am now
Don't matter which word I say
I don't give a shit there's no one but you

Even when I'm in the crowd
And when I feel so alone
You're under my skin
With all your scent

I fall in love once again
I don't need your titanium ring
I fall in love with your eyes
I want your titanium wings
