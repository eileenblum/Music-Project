Everything's burning but you 
You've never be defeated

It's the cruelty of the war 
Everything is lost 
There's dust everywhere 
But the sun always shines 
In a bloody sky

Bold lady 
With green eyes 
You just want to go back home

In your heart there is fear 
The dread to be seen

This doesn't seem your land

But the sun always shines 
On a bloody ground

The defeat of a war brings 
Hunger suppression and the 
Death of the past

The love you need is not here now 
The safe is all in your own hand 
Go on 
Go on

Bold lady 
With green eyes 
You just want to go back home 
In your heart there is fear 
The dread to be seen

As god is my withness 
They are not going to defeat me 
I'm going to live through this 
And when it's over 
I'll never be hungry again
