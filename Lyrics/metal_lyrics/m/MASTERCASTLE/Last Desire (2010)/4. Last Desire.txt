Your lips on my skin shivers are flowin' slowly into this shelter of silence 
I can feel your breath hot

Candles are burnin' when 
You hold me tight 
Passion is growing and 
Burns any lies 
Desire is moving
Your heartbeats tonight
The power of love and
I feel it inside

Dark eyes in a bright soul 
You're fire and i want you 
So please come into my shelter 
I can feel your breath hot

Candles are burnin' when 
You hold me tight 
Passion is growing and 
Burns any lies 
Desire is moving
Our heartbeats tonight
The power of love and i feel it inside
