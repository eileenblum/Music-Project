I'm here again on my own 
Alone in the night 
I've got cold sand in my hands
The sea wind makes free my mind
Ice fire brightens gloomy clouds 
Ice fire and love on the ground

Waiting for one dream 
Waiting for an objective wild spell 
Waiting for a new love 
Waiting for the unknown wild spell

How many troubles i faced 
I burn out my past 
There's one new dream in my head 
Wild spell of primitive life
