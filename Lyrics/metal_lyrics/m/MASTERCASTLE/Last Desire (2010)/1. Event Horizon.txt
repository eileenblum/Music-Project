Dark energy expands 
In universe 
So many galaxies 
Are far light years away 
Far away

Time delates 
On the event horizon 
It's too late 
Too late 
Too late

Cosmology declares 
There is no way 
The magnetism is too strong 
I fight this strength in vain 
It's in vain

I'm reaching now 
The event horizon 
This attraction 
To the event horizon 
It's too late 
Too late 
Too late
