Through dangerous forests 
Wet by dirty rain 
Burned by treacherous sun 
Sweaty and tired 
I left to the vultures 
All my strengths 
Dark and light again 
Cruelty and goodness 
It seemed like water 
On decaying leaves 
Green shadows 
On my steps 
Moss and marble 
Inside my heart

Here she comes 
The jade star 
To wipe my face and 
Glue any piece of 
My broken life

Here she comes 
The jade star 
To give a rest to my 
Breathless body and 
Complex mind

Slipping on shaky ice 
No one can catch me 
And anyone can hurt me 
So they do 
Green shadows 
On my steps 
Moss and marble 
Inside my heart

Here she comes 
The jade star 
To give a rest to my 
Breathless body and 
Complex mind 
Slipping on shaky ice 
No one can catch me 
And anyone can hurt me 
So they do
