Away from this earth 
You've gone away 
My tears fall down on (the) ground 
And summer is dying out

I walk alone 
No one can hear 
This weeping, weep in my soul

(I) hear you laughing
When spring is near well 
You say life is a journey 
It's the only chance 
(I) hear you crying
When winter's closing 
Its doors to flowers 
Alive flowers in your heart

Away from this sky 
You've gone away 
My tears dry now in (the) air 
Season's flowing again 
I dream alone 
No one can feel 
The emptyness that's in my soul 

(I) hear you laughing
When spring is near well 
You say life is a journey 
It's the only chance 
(I) hear you crying
When winter's closing 
Its doors to flowers 
Alive flowers in your heart
