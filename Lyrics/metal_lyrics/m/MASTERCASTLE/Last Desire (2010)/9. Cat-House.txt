I hear you boy comes down i'm here a heart of stone 
I'm waiting for the sun, a sun

I dance all alone 
With my heart of stone 
I dream a new dawn, a dawn

You can take me as you want 
I'm a breathless dirty doll 
Yes i am 
What you want 
Come and take me as you want 
Night and day i'll be your doll 
Yes i am what you want

Another man comes down
But i still dance alone
And i dream a new sun - the sun

You can take me as you want 
I'm a breathless dirty doll 
Yes i am 
What you want

Come and take me as you want 
Night and day i'll be your doll 
Yes i am what you want

I hear you boy comes down 
I'm here a heart of stone 
I'm waiting for the sun, a sun
