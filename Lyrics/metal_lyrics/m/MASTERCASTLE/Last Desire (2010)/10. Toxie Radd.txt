Breathing the tension is too strong 
Feeling the danger in this place 
Vengeance rebellion despair 
You've got to escape from these pains

Toxie radd 
Toxie radd 
In your head 
Toxie radd

Toxie radd 
In your head 
Toxie radd

Riot suspicion and hate 
Ihe black door is locked with blood 
You've got to escape from these pains 
Fight to be free once again

Toxie radd 
Toxie radd 
In your head 
Toxie radd
