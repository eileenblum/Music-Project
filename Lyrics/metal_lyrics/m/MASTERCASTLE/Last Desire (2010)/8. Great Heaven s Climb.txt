Waiting for her 
Another battle is lost 
Fighting for her 
Another battle is lost 
On the river

Fighting for her 
And the battle is lost 
No way 
Death is coming to me 
There's no return

Her eyes shine down 
On my last breath 
The stream's voice will guide 
My steps to dark

Her smile is such 
A stolen wing 
Cold flesh on ground
Great heaven's climb

Darkness is looking for me 
On the river 
Turn down the light of my life 
And she's so far away 
Learning to fly 
On the bank of the river 
Loosing my breath 
Cos' the battle is lost 
No return

Her eyes shine down 
On my last breath 
The stream's voice will guide 
My steps to dark

Her smile is such 
A stolen wing 
Cold flesh on ground 
Great heaven's climb
