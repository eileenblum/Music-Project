The train is moving
Leaving Paris
Too slowly
The girl is waiting
In the empty wagon
Waiting for

He enters now
Smile on her
Shy lips
It's time for lovers

Strong
While the train is running
Slow
They are just out of this world
Cause their eyes shine
Through the dark of time

The train is reaching
Berlin is the next stop don't stop
They are close but
She must get off get off

The time is up
Tears on his lips
Time for lovers

Strong
While the train is running
Slow
They are just out of this world
Cause their eyes shine
Through the dark of time

Strong
While the train is running
Slow
They are just out of this world
Cause their eyes shine
Through the dark of time
