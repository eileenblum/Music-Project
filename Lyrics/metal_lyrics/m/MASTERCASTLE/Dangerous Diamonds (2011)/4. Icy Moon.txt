Shit, there's wind today
Cold and the taste of salt
On my lips

Better move my ass
Better cast the nets for the fish

My father told me so:
Clear moon frost soon
Sunrise is coming
While I dream of June

But there, on the lines of horizon
There the flight of freedom
Where nature reigns

The sea has no prayer to say
We are the guests
On his wild surface

Silence the voice of waves
Only the scream of a seagull

My mother woke up with me everynight
She gave me the will and the strength to survive

But there on the lines of horizon
There I learn the freedom
But there on the lines of horizon

But there on the lines of horizon
There I learn the freedom
But there on the lines of horizon
