Images and thoughts
The scream of your art
You painted all your life
Dark style, your brush

Windows on reality
Your mind is a bird
That fly against the wind
Freedom don't come easily
For who fight
For his family

Painting the rage and the lands
Where you've been in your fantasy
Money don't come easily
For who lives with honesty

Ou painter your world
That flows through your brush
A great rebel mind
It's a dark style your hush

Images and thoughts
The scream of your art
You painted all your life
Dark style, your brush
