Red light are sparkling
Breaking the dark of the night
The city is hot and it's
Ready to bite the time

Naked concrete seems so deep
I'm just as a leaf, carried by the wind
Naked your soul seems so free
Big apple can taste
Bitter &amp; sweet

Electric rainbow is
Lightning the dark of the night
Fashion and hell are attracting
Free spirits online

Naked concrete seems so deep
I'm just as a leaf, carried by the wind
Naked your soul seems so free
Big apple can taste
Bitter &amp; sweet

Bitter &amp; sweet...

World seems so small
And you are everywhere
World is calling me
Well I'm not scared
World has no boundaries
If your mind has no limits
