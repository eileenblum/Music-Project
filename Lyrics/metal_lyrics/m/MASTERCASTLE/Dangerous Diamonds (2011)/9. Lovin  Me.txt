Each morning I wake up in my own skin
Sometime it's easy, sometimes it's so hard
I love the child survivor in me
Full of naivety and unconsciousness
I've done mistakes but I
Forgive myself everytime

Loving me
I don't need any other thing but to be free
Loving me inside
Hearth is in myself there's no other place I want to be
When no one is around
I'm not alone

Each night I dreamt
Each night I've found another bed
Whenever I fell I always rised up again
Inside of me I find
The world I looked for outside

Loving me
I don't need any other thing but to be free
Loving me inside
I'm not alone

Each morning I wake up in my own skin
Sometime it's easy, sometimes it's so hard
