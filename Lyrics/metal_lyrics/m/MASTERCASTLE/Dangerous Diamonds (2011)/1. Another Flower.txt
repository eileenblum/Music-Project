I've tried for so long
To steal all your love
Now you are gone too far
And I'm feeling down
Why am I losing my mind?

A dream can kill
If there's only one kiss
Keeping the hope
There is nothing to steal
But the love

I've tried for so long, oh so long
To have all your love
You have another flower, yes I know
To warm with your fire
Why am I losing my mind?

A dream can kill
When there's only one will
A dream can kill
If there's only one kiss
Keeping the hope
There is nothing to steal
But the love

A dream can kill
When there's only one will
A dream can kill
If there's only one kiss
Keeping the hope
There is nothing to steal
But the love
