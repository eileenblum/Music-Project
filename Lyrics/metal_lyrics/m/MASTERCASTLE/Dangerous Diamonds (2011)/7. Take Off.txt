Airports take off landing
On white wings of steal
Sidney the dreamtime
Niger en sy kinders

Highlands &amp; Quirang
Strange rocks of a wild Skye

Suitcases and dust
On the road but it's time to go on

Kazan &amp; Khanov
Rio sand and passion
Amado writes your Bahia
Sangue &amp; Moquecas

World seems so small
And you are everywhere
World is calling me
Well I'm not scared
World has no boundaries
If your mind has no limits
