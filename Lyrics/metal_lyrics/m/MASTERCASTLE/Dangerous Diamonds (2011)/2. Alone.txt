The night seems so near
The sky seems so far from me
Steps by steps why
The road is so long for me?

Alone I walk
And the rain is falling down
On (this) reality
Alone I walk in the night
Of my future the world is
So far from here
And from me

Maybe the sun
Is rising on the mountains
I see it again
Step by step
Why (does) the road is too long for me

Alone I walk
And the rain is falling down
On (this) reality
Alone I walk in the night
Of my future the world is
So far from here
And from me
