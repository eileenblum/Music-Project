Seasons circle with no chance to mend
Feel the breast of nature come to an end
See the soil sift through my hands as I cry and is stripped bare I do not know why
Set in motion cold seasons will pass us by
Set in motion cold seasons will pass us by
Comes a person, through a dream is (this) the key
Effects that are altered, be..... as it may
We as people, might not be here to stay
Set in motion cold seasons will pass us by
Set in motion cold seasons will pass us by
All good things must come from within, not outside
