We came upon this rose
Standing alone
It fades to black and dies
This was a sign to me
I should have known
It then became so clear
To find a dying rose
THAT WE COULD SEE SO RED
To find it on our own
It was so hard to break so hard to take
All alone we stand
Tonight we say goodbye
Tonight we say goodbye
Tonight we say goodbye
Tonight, time to say goodbye
To you, to our love, is this wrong?
THIS POINT I NEED TO MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND
THIS MISSION SENT TO ME
Forever more our trust goes hand in hand
Tell me how can we move along
THERE HAS TO BE SOME WAY WE CAN WORK IT OUT
HOW CAN WE MOVE ALONG?
Believe with me in hope....
JUST TO SAY IT HURTS
I will be all alone
It was so hard to break so hard to take all alone we stand goodbye
