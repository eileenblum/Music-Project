Everything must happen for a reason
"of the selfish lies"
Everyone will use thier evil being
"for your own damn lives"
And Technical situations, they are so well defined
So when will you see the wisdom
That I have shown you throughout time
One time when you look in the mirror
Facing.... internal fears with pride (inside)
Next time when you look in the mirror
Will this then eat.... you up inside?
Air is a logic, that will show just one side
Air, It will keep me alive
And you struggle to find something that you know will protect you
The philosophy it is devine
Everything will happen in dimension
Everyone must use their best intention
Without communication, it won't be so well definedWhen will they see the wisdom?
That I have shown you throughout time
Mid: Look for the signs
To keep you alive
