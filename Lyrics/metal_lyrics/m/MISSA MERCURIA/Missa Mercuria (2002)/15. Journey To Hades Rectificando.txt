Crawling slowly on my knees
People watching see us bleed
The silence will cast a cloud to dispell
Wash the pain soaked ground so well
Everything I do it, all for truth so blindly
Everything surrounds me
Everything surrounds you always
Don't cry!
When the silence screams for someone
Don't cry!
When the silence screams it fills a whole
Don't cry!
When the silence screams for someone
Don't cry When the silence screams it makes me groan
Ride I'm taking for my needs
Feels of darkness part(s) from thee
The road that winds, through clouds of suspicion
Wash the pain soaked ground beneath me.
Everything I do it all for you so blindly
Everyone surrounds me veryone surrounds you always
With the darkness gone
Will there be just one
Who will share the only true source of our lives
At the waters edge
The lake is mirrored by the dawn than the moon that shines invites her to appear
Turn the light off...
Must quickly change design...
Will suddenly be out of line by....
