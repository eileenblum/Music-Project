The king called on his sons one day
Orders them, they must obey If they confront their fears
By the water near will they understand the visions of their soul?
Go on and reach your aim, so they can all complain
Of the jealous ones, who stand there terrified
Whispers in their minds are saying that it must confine
And whatever they have done til now, will surely change design
Shut the light off (light off)
The light up in the sky
Shut the light off (light off)
The light up in the sky
That makes me blind
