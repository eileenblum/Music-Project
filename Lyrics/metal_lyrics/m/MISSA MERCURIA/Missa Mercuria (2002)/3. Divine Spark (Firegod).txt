I am the sun, I am the fire inside
An energy brought by the lust of mankind
Don't look at me now, if I was one to blame
It was not I, not the god with the flame
Don't fight, the spiritsin all of living things
Energy is happening, it's awakening
Even though your standing with the god of fire
You, its all there inside
Yes you, denying some simple dangers
You, should take every step... and accept what you want, fulfill desire
I'm so much more than your mind will command
You will reduce to what you understand
In case you don't know, your aggression might kill
This is the one point, this is not my will...
You, it's all there insideYes you, denying some simple dangers
You should take any steps, accept what you want, fulfill desire
In passion theres hope, contentment and peace
The laughter can circle and make your heart free if you trust in this strength,
And live how you feel your dreams will come true and your life will be real
