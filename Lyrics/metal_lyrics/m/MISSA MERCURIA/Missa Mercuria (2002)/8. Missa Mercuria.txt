Should I take on this mission?
That's asked of meI still trust in all the humans
It can be done
There is so much to achieve
I must prevail
I stand here with all I believe in
I'm the only one
When I find a way that shows the people how it's done....
I will put my faith in them!
Missa Mercuria, the message that is so divine
Missa Mercuria, the message that changes their mind
They can be saved, they can be saved
All of mankind can be saved, knowing that no one can ever be chained
Lead them through all their dark... fears... they stand beside themselves
Seeing the mortals appear... leaving only souls
Thru time and space the ego exist... solution's how to persist
Though I will lead my people.... and leave my life
Now I've found the way that shows them all just how it's done......
Yes I do believe in them
Missa Mercuria, the message that is so devine
Missa Mercuria, the message that will change all times
They will be saved, they will be saved
All of mankind.... will be saved
Knowing that no one can ever be blamed
Missa Mercuria the message that is so devine
Missa Mercuria
The message that changes all times
They will be saved, they will be saved, all of mankind will be saved
Knowing that each soul knows the way to break free!
