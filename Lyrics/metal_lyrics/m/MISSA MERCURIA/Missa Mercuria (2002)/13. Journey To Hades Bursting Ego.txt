If it works against your soul (religion, laws or code)
Will you ever find control (information overload)
Breaking through the walls
Tearing down the walls Your wish is master and is king
A golden cage is where we live

[Chorus]
Freedom for all
Go your own way...
Will come some day..
Go your own way

Poisoned feelings hearts and minds
Damage has been done
Destroy your prisons and you'll find
Life can still be won
Fight for freedom, love and hate these emotions all relate
Feel your skin crawl inside out
What you want will leave a doubt
Here's the journey we must take
The Question posed
He begins the quest
Aware of all at stake
Paradise he'll make
Journey to Hades
