[Music: P. Johansson / P. Kim December '93 - Poetry: P. Kim December '93]

Carried far faraway
On the wings of gold
Ride - ride the wind
I'm the wild one
Forever in the eternity lies the truth
Inside I'll burn with my own sorrows

In your dreaming eyes
I swear I saw the kingdom rise
Where the rainbow ends
My love for you will remain
In the fire of Armageddon
Our wishes come true

Lonely cries echos through the night
My mind was filled with memories of you

But I have to rise - rise again
From the ashes of my own burning hell

Like the ashes in the wind
I will fade away

When thunder and lightning broke the silence
And the rain comes whipping
My beauty of naked lusts
Forbidden desire - saves me

[Lead: P. Kim]

"Like the ashes in the wind
I will fade away"

In your dreaming sad eyes
I swear I saw your own misery rise
Where the rainbow ends
My love for you will remain
In the fire of Armageddon
Our wishes will finally come true

But I have to rise - rise again
From the ashes of my own burning hell

My beauty of naked lusts
Forbidden desire - saves me
