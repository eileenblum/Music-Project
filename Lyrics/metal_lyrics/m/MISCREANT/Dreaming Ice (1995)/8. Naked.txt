[Music: P. Jansson January '94 - Poetry: P. Jansson February '94]

I feel naked

The darkest of clouds
binds mountain with sea
cause - still your face is torturing me
The harmony seduction shattering my head
Please, enter the light don't be afraid

"Why can't my conscience leave me behind
what must I do to proof my regret?"

Sweet child, I'll see illusions of you
dancing over the fields
Be mine, before you must turn back to your
beauty sleep

Can you forgive me for my mistake
Time is floating through my veins,
can't let you fade away
Your face's still whirling in my mind,
drives me to insanity
Sanity, it really makes me bleed,
what can I do?
You tell me

Honestly, I pray for you in my dreams
but my dreams are twisted towards reality
As I cannot clear it out,
in my deepest thoughts
why I took your life with this knife of mine

"Through the sky my spirit will arrive"

Sweet child, I'll see illusions of you
dancing over the fields
Be mine, before you must turn back to your
beauty sleep

I wish to dry your tears one last time
Time is floating through my veins,
can't let you fade away
Your face's still whirling in my mind,
drives me to insanity

Which evil curse are controlling my soul?
That makes me breathe these violent breeds
I'll try to stay in calm, being selfrestrained
When my abnormal feelings arise and carry me
far away

[Lead: P. Jansson]

As I see you far away
Your shadow in the light
Now, when you finally have returned
I realize the world is ours

Finally, the world is ours
I realize, the world is ours
