[Music: P. Kim March '93 - Poetry: P. Kim / P. Johansson April '93]

Now I'm tired of all the years
That gone by my strength slowly fades
As I lay down my horrified life
Flashed before my eyes

I hungered for insanity
Illusions infinity

"I trusted and God except myself"

With the silence of grief
The wind whispers your name
The gates lie wide open filled with secrets
Treasures you can't imagine
Through the stream of insanity
I'll lie awake

As I lay down my horrified life
Flashed before my eyes

I hungered for insanity
Illusions infinity

The God of lies superstitious nonsense
Blinding religion
Fools enslaved under the cross
No God as strong as I am
See our salvation rot away

Live in your illusion
Die in your illusion

"I trusted any God except myself"

Through the stream of insanity
I'll lie awake
Waiting for my ship to take my soul home
To the golden shore of everlasting sleep

Illusion infinity
