I stand in the middle of the circle
The circle the strong attraction
I smell the taste of dishonest
Dishonest like a burning flame

Listen to their sad symphonies
Fear my soul

The eternal way to disaster
The freezing garden - I bleed
Throw your veil away
In the river of proudness

Listen to their sad symphonies
Fear my soul

For thousand years I've wander
When the blood drops from your feet
You'll spill it on your dying shadow

For thousand years I've wander
When the blood drops from your feet
You'll spill it on your dying shadow

Forever not to be
Forever you'll plead to me

Your beautiful breath
The mind filled with fools
Your lovely soul
I can lead you to the dead

Listen to their sad symphonies
Fear my soul

This pain shines as a star
Your heart dreaming ice
Your flesh burning passion
Your sins will never be forgotten

Listen to their sad symphonies
Fear my soul

For thousand years I've wander
When the blood drops from your feet
You'll spill it on your dying shadow

Forever not to be
Forever you'll plead to me

This pain shines as a star
Your heart dreaming ice
Your flesh burning passion
Your sins will never be forgotten

Listen to my sad song
Listen my sad symphony

Forever not to be
Forever you'll plead to me
Forever, forever, forever not to be
