[Music: P. Kim / P. Johansson / M. Ek May '93 - Poetry: P. Kim June '93]

I gazed at the healing horizon
In the dawn of the dead
"Beauty of divinity"
Beauty of divinity
"Show me the way"
Lead me into your light

"As long as I live
No heaven no salvation"

As the sun climbs higher
and the shadows get shorter
And the drinks get longer
That's when I will face my destiny, destiny

The sun rose for the last time
An angel descended in the bloodred sky
His light will show the way
Through the colonnades in white

Paralysed by your revelations
"Visions seemed so real"
I drifted back in time and mind
I'll remember the smell of innocence
But time passed by passed by

I will walk alone with my shadow
as my only true friend
Anger - rage
Let my glorious soul be free

The sun rose for the last time
An angel descended in the bloodred sky
His light will show the way
Through the colonnades in white

As the sun climbs higher
and the shadows get shorter
And the drinks get longer
That's when I will face my destiny

"As long as I live my heaven will be
your own hell"
