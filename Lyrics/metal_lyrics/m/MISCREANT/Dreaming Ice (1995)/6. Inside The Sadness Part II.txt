[Music: P. Kim January '93 - Poetry: P. Kim December '92]

I entered the gate of rage
To my own moonlight funeral
I was your truth and your fate

Inside the circle of time
A tunnel of madness
Spreading the fear
I shall arise

Your innocent young face
Twisted in sadness and sorrows
I won't fall from grace

Inside the circle of time
A tunnel of madness
Spreading the fear
I shall arise

The wind blew cold and icy
as you sent a rose into my grave

Inside the hands of time
I shall arise

[Lead: P. Kim]

And forever you shall remember

I will be inside of your soul
I'm your truth and your faith
Inside of you I will remain
