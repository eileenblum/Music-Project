[Music: P. Kim August '93 - Poetry: P. Kim September '93]

I stared out in my emptiness
Loneliness surrounds my bleeding soul
Summer turns into autumn
Cold winds blew in my innerself
Master I swear the day I'm strong
I'll have my revenge

"Long cold winter
winter is here to stay"

The requiem called my great name
I stepped through the dimensions
and deeper into the abyss I slipped

I slipped into the abyss

I saw visions I felt pain so heavenly
My silhouette fell

Into the valley of naked shadows

Sad shadows danced with my dying soul
They gave me blood and satisfaction
beyond all dimensions

Master I swear I'll have my revenge

"Long cold winter
winter is here to stay"

Flames of forbidden desires
Took me to place I never been
I will be the thunder and lightning

Under the cross
I raised my wings and flew far away
into your dreams
Your misery will be my treasures
And my name will be outspoken loud
I'm your holy God - save your tears

Sad shadows danced with my dying soul
They gave me blood and satisfaction
beyond all dimensions

Master I swear I'll have my revenge

Twilight shadows danced with my soul
and winter was here to stay
