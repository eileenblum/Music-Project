[Music: P. Kim / P. Johansson April '93 - Poetry: P. Kim March '93]

[Lead: P. Kim]

Endless river
water made from thousands of tears
Farewell to misery
Saviour of agony tears and the fear

I prayed but I bleed
You tore my soul apart

The face I saw on the water surface
Told me what I am and what to be

[Lead: P. Kim]

My blood holy spirit will live in eternity
Taste my blood
Drink the water
"Drink the water"

I fell into the river with grace
and proudness that you'll never gonna see

[Lead: P. Kim]

"I'm surrounded by light and honour
Raised to the skies of heaven
In the name of glory and pride"

Feel my presence breath the air
"Breath the air"
I'm everything "Everything"
I'm everywhere "Everywhere"

I prayed but I bleed
You tore my soul apart

I fell into the river with grace
and proudness that you'll never gonna see

[Lead: P. Kim]

"One in a million I stood
at the horizon of dreams"
