Again I see the twilight sky over my land
Alive to fight another day
Again I'm here facing the legions of death
The gods of war shall decide our fate

Fighting on for glory and honour
For the sunrise of tomorrow
For the right to live free and in peace

To break the chains-liberty
And never kneeling down
Bleeding together brothers in arms

A red sunrise the colours of dawn paint the sky
The day of reckoning arrives
The tide of war has covered all of the land
No surrender liberty or death

Marching proud under our colours
One by one defending while falling
Trading our blood for glory

Outnumbered still fighting brave
The mighty lions final roar
A glory chapter in the book of wars

Fight and die reach eternity
Our blood in the sand
Wasnât spilled in vain

Fight and die reach eternity
Raise our flags to the sky
We are one with our land forevermore
