The sun has come, gone is the night
Another day to stand and fight
Another mile, this brutal march
Another day to kill and die

The glory cause
Defend our home
Soldier boys
With old men souls
Spears and flags
A clash at dawn
Outnumbered standing proud

[Bridge]
Facing the fire
Facing death with open eyes
Soldiers of flesh with iron hearts

Go my son
A motherÂ´s pray
The nation calls you to protect
Go and fight and if you die
I swear your soul I will requite

We shall never surrender
Our life given away
United standing proud
War children
Lions of war

Facing the fire
Facing death with sword in hand
Soldiers of flesh with iron hearts

The time has come the charge begins - death awaits
Our chests shall be the walls
The blood in our swords
The red from our flag
Proud in battle falling for the cause

I feel this cool blade as I plummet to the ground facing up above
I shall leave my brethren whilst I hear the War Gods horn
I part with a grin, knowing they stand strong still
Our time will come to rise once more
My brothers, their pride, and their blood, the blood of heroes,
Never forgot

The sun has gone, the night arose
The fields were burned none survived
The glorious ones
The nationÂ´s pride
Children with a lion heart

The blood has been spilled
Our boys are gone
A page of glory written in blood
We're one with our land to win or die
The brave one's sacrifice

Facing the fire
Facing the death with open eyes
Soldiers of flesh with iron hearts
Iron hearts!!!
