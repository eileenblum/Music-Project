Surrounded by madness
And possessed by war
Loud and proud
But empty hearted and

Blind they are marching
Straight into our flames
Heading to
The point of no return

[Bridge]
As they enter no man's land
Thousands of soul to sacrifice

Charging our walls
Spreading their blood
Feeling the flames
While marching to hell

[Chorus]
Madness and fire
Gunpowder and spears
Merciless against the alliance of hell

Waving our colours
Victorious we stand
We could go
Forevermore

Outnumbered we are fighting
Surrounded by death
Raining lea d
Sheepâs heading to the wolf

[Bridge]
Iron cannons spitting death
A battlefield covers in blood
