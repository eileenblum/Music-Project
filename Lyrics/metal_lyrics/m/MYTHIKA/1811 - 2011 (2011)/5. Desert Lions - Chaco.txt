Roaring are the lions!!!
Roaring are the lions
Itâs time to fight
The storm is closing in
The storm is closing in
On us all

War is raging once again
We have to defend
Our glorious land

On the north the skies turn black
Proud we are marching back
Where our chests will build up the walls

[Chorus]
Lions we are the lions
The roaring lions
Standing bold

Lions we are the lions
The roaring lions
Standing bold in our ground
Facing the hordes to give them hell

[Bridge]
Family and home left behind
Heading to the front
Flags of glory

Thirst and bullets taking lives
Heroes standing tall
Warriors outnumbered blood on the sand
