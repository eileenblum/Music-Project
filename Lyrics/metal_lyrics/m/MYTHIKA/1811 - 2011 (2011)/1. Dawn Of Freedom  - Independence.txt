Bowing our heads for much too long
We now search our place under the sun
Living like slaves in our own homes
We come to fight or to fall

We have served the crown
We have fought the wars
We have proven ourselves
Now we shall lead our own way

[Bridge]
Freedom was burning inside the hearts
Challenging the powers
The voice of the crowd echoing the walls
Speaking out loud
The right time has come to break down the yoke
The freedom bell tolls

[Chorus]
Breaking the chains, breaking away
We are breaking the chains, breaking away
Go now, from this dawn till forevermore

Marching on
A thousand strong

In dark alleys in the dead of the night
We count the hours we are ready to fight
Now or never we await the call
Prepared to kill and prepared to die

Before the sunrise we shall seal our fate
Conquering the night to be born with the day
Gathered round the fire under the moon of May
Dying for freedom living for today

[Bridge]
The red of the dawn breaking through the dark
The day of reckoning finally arrives
We shall break the chains
We shall be free again
Or we'll die like warriors with our swords in our hands
