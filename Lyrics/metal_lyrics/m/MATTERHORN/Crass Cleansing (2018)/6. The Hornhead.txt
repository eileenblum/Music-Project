[Morbidâ/ Nekrokingâ/ Tot]

Hornhead, standalone!
Behead the holy glorious corpse
The unvital one â the rearing mourns
Hornhead, exalted soul

Spirit loosens in morbid reveries
Of such potency â he it is and therein
You may be fulfilled forever
Resets this new mode of being
Inhales and resets again

Enlivened as any soul's successor
Witness and holy man
Ahead the glorious corpses
The new bloodless wounds of men

Life: a prosthetic performance
Draped our night-ripped presence
Prolific where all gods ceased
Reset this new state of being

Draped â our night-ripped presence!

Visions near the changeless power
As fear and hate alights
Unction from above
Assist by nature frail
Life has failed me, go forth in flesh
Go forth in flesh, renew!
Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away

Misrule leads to lost fear of trying
Where havens of balance existed
The rearing mourns, sowed in frame
Hornheads as any soul's successors

Deathlike ideograph, eternal progress
Unction from above
Deathlike ideograph, predefined and moribund
A crass cleansing fire

Yet his hand's still upraised
An infinite performance
Encased in frames
Access in concurrent worlds

Yet his hand's still upraised!
