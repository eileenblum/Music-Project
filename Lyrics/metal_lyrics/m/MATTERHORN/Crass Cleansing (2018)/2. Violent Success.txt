[Morbidâ/ Nekrokingâ/ Tot]

First and last sighs likewise
Outact what was, the changeless power
Still ongoing â violent success
(for it is) the nature of the beast
The way men's hearts beat

Death impelled!
A proven endorsement
The time ruled judgement
Violent successor!

The jargon of time, learned on purpose
Yet to oust all conducts and beliefs
Renew their own free will
Violent success â the nature of the beast

Death impels!
A proving endorsement
In sanctimonious ease
Violent successor!

The first's and last's eyes
And everlasting and likewise
Will build up on (the) same ground
The way of all endings
A pogrom against all flesh
In obscure star shine
Death is our progress!
The time rules on secular courts
Hindsight the light
A never-ending oppression

Violent success!
