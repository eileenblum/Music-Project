[Morbidâ/ Nekrokingâ/ Tot]

Waiting for anything to arise
Vision the feel of a near thought
Praying for someone to appear
Adorn a time yet to come

Promote the masks of misrule
Over-newsed still uninformed
Terror fills the state of being voided
Obsessive, proclaims, acting random
For a fulfilled life?
Repressing existence
They live as good as they can

Promote demasked and misruled
Over-newsed still uninformed
Restricted to existence
They live as good as they can
Just not nothing yet
Only not nothing yet!

Everyone wills to be
None wants to become
Led into oneness forever
Only not nothing yet!

Demoting following generations
Bear the ruins of the elder race
Decline and deprave a new world
Restricted to existence
They live as good as they can
I foresee the shimmering end
Only not nothing yet!

Everyone wills to be
None wants to become
Bridges burnt behind those eyes
Clearance's lost
Life, a performance to be done
Crass twist to be mirrored justly
But they miss the breaking
Forever prevent â remains
Unaborted for total submission
Encounter delusive impression
Like wrongdoing vives 'em

Rites! Solemnized ceremonial state
Lights! Only shines on their bare hands
Years of questions, years of answers:
"Life's considered done for free!"
