[Morbidâ/ Nekrokingâ/ Tot]

Serene whispers, feel the freeze
Attracted by those that are lost to the world
Startled by nature's great scream
No longer our parents' sons
Immoral will, lurking in the woods
The perverted pack out for a mortal thrill

Fascinated by what lies
Beyond earthly delights
Initiated, only bystanders
Of our predetermined lives

Night by night we parade with hell
Brothers in darkness, the inner circle
Never were such words shared
Words of mortals, words of doom

We were â teenage emperors!

Erect our thrones, rush of death
Showing of the winged figure
Proponent and ringleader
Protect our arcane secret

Understood by whom understands
The world is like we believe it to be
Torn out of life by wisdom
In such a shameful way

"All that is necessary for the triumph of evil
Is that good men do nothing."

Enlightened by self-preservation
The demoniac fire of puberty
Revealing our true nature
The mortal appearance of death

Tragic guidance, our youth is stolen
Lost the virgin holiness
Spirit killing fantasies
Will we ever conquer again?
