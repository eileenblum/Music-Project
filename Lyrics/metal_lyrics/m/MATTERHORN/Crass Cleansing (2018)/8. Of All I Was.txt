[Morbidâ/ Nekrokingâ/ Tot]

There where all the veils raise
And all answers (are) already found

Paradisial night revels
Separate me from the pallid soil
Cleansed after the sound
A young man's necrologue

Of the dormant death in me
Of the infinite return
Another skin to feel restored
Necrologue of all I was

Youth's happiness has incompleted me
Fandom of the vulgar tone
Death enthroned in the kingdom of Argus
The figure and its shadow swap over!

Of the dormant death
Of the infinite return
Another skin to feel restored
Necrologue of all I was

So the veils raised, the answer is here
A crass release from an unborn morn
My name cleansed, mute and unmade
Let it be so and make my corpse a relic
Prosthetic performance
Whence I've been released from
Bounded by the unvital one
Escaping the tyranny of eternal performance
The necrologue of all I was

Veils raised, the answer's here, crass release
Unborn morn, escaping the tyranny
Acrimony, necrologue of all I was
