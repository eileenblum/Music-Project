[Morbidâ/ Nekrokingâ/ Tot]

Now the wind turns, blows from far away
Carrying the howl of nurtured hordes
Outnumbering human flood
Few narrow lands, tainted tongues
Last day comes, the tower will burst

Retold stories, the night forbids the noise
Reoccurring renaissance, chaos evokes
Progress a tainted virtue,
Burned out and culturally collapsed
Where did we come from, where do we go?
An addiction to death!
(to the death)

Decline the empty empires
Occidental fear
Return from the orient
To conquer their origin

True words of culture unheard
Unspeakable by descendants
Noble principles, disabled wisdom
Forbidden and to be lost
(to be lost)

From bronze age to virtuality
Erectors prostrate
Drawling, down towards the void
Precarious measure, decades of crusades

Flaming rush of information
No more connections, beliefs divide
Reconquest old meanings
An imploring appeal, confound our tongues

Our tongues confound
Tongues of babel!

Now the wind turnsâ¦
