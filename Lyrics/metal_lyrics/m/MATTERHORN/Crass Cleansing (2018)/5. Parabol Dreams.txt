[Morbidâ/ Nekrokingâ/ Tot]

Remote insight
A living dead corpse
I live in your wasting flesh

Parabol dreams
Begotten corpses
Unified masses (are)
Condemned to lies

Tirades of hate
To coexist within death
Curtains are drawn
For distraction is high-end
Parabol dreams
In plastic forged
An ark in darkness
Condemned to life

The deceit you stream will caress my mind
We're objects given by the framer of our will
These memories I remember are not mine
And the vision temptingly wraps around me

Life's too much for one alone
Debtors of flesh, reflectors of life
Life turns into dreams
As the signal redeems
I will what you want, as echolon commands!

Set to receive!

Parabol dreams
Servants of dawn
Life is delusion
Ripe for consumption

Outbreak, immersion, to insight, reflect me!

Shall I rise
As if you are my tomb?
And everyone shall suffer all our pain!

Attack!
