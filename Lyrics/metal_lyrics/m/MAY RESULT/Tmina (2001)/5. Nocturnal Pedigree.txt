[Kozeljnik]

Nourish The Beast 
By The Wandering Lucid Sky 
Invoking The System 

Slavery Citadelled Heart 
In Armaggeddon-Like Dimension 
Neutralized in Molecular Dark 
Nocturnal Shade Beyond The Life 

Spectral Crystal Darkness 
Mournful Cave a Wisdom Play 
Poet Blasphemy, Alchemy 
The Black Crystal Pedigree 

Journey Into Heaven's Jest 
Gloating by The Jingle's Hell 
Reached Crystal,Power-Death 
The Blood Bounds near to Devil's Aim 

It Breaks The System 
By The Nocturnal, Flicker Star 
And Breeds The Pedigree 
By The Dimension of Glowing Sign 

Ravens: Grant 'Em to Grasp 
Ravens: Grant 'Em to Grasp 

Captured Wisdom Holy Soiled 
By The Black Eyes 
Which are like a Crystal 
In Thy Flesh Nocturnal
