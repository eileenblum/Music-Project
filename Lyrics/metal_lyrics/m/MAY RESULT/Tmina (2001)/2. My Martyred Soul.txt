[Glad]

Cold, Inprisoned by Thoughts 
Awakeness grips, falling down 
I feel the Flames of Hell 
how did I end like this? 
Once I was bold and now 
I've Lost My Martyred Soul 

So Deep, my pain remains unchanged 
I want to feel the Delightful Taste of Blood 
Come forth Lord Lucifer 
Take My Martyred Soul 

Down I go to forget 
Flesh and Blood 
I give to Foe, Master Satan 
Welcome My Martyred Soul 

Warmness surrounds me 
In this place most obscene 
I kneel before Duke Astaroth 
Can thee feel My Martyred Soul? 

Inside, alone, my hate will grow 
Greater towards the day 
Gods Slay me Martyr 
Slay My Martyred Soul 

Grow Wrath Grow 
See that Doom I will show 
To the world that does not 
Recall My Martyred Soul
