[Glad]

Where Cold Winds Blow Forever 
Their Screams towards The Frozen Sun 
Slowly Dying in it's silent Tomb 
Behind The Horizon of Flame-Red Clouds 
The Lonley Trees Reveal Their Wisdom 

Meaning Forged Through Times Creation 
Carried By This Realm of Token 
Alas, Now I Know Life's True Meaning 
I've come to an end of Inevitable Journey 
I Grieve Not for Natures Endless Circle 
It Brings The Purest Essence to my Knowledge 

Meaning Lost Through Times Creation 
Carried By This Realm of Token 

For I Am One with The Flickering Stars 
Naked as a Life Newborn 

Where The Cold Winds Blow 
I Left My Ashes Covered By Snow 
My Soul Reborn and Strong 
To Father Stribog I now Belong 

I Hear The Gospel of Abandoned Mountains 
Through Vastiness I Wander Free 
I Feel The Endless Cry of Crystal Rivers 
And I have heard Tranquility Speak 
When i have Sunk with The Coldest Wind 
That Called for my Presence 

I Saw The Agonies of Tormented Plains 
So I Caressed Them with my touch 
When I Have Sunk with The Oldest Wind 
Shall I Outlive Eternity 
That Called for my Presence 
To The Coldwind Dominion
