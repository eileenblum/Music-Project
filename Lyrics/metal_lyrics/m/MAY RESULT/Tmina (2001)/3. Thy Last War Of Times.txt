[Kozeljnik &amp; Glad]

Standing on Raven's Throneside 
With Eyes opened Black 
And Hordes from Heaven's Fall 
Feast upon Damnation 

And Mountains so near to the Land 
of Black Covered Hearts 
Tamed in Devastation 
By The Shadows of Satan 

[Darkwings:]
Return from it's Battle Horizon 
Sheer Melted Hearts 
Wrapped in Honour of Wisdom Gloomed 
And with Mortal Bills 
Blooded 

Standing on Raven Throneside 
With Eyes opened Black... 

Dark Wariors sealed with Night's Aura 
Open Their Wings for the Great Times 
For This Last War 

For Thy Last War of Times 
For Thy Last War of Times
