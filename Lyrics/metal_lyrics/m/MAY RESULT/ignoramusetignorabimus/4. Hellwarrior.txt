He's back to our lives facing the beast 
With aggression in vains and blood 
God of hatred in his soul 
Evil master in his eyes 

Hell warrior 
Devil obsession 
Totally kills 
In massacre passion 

His weapon is a sword of destiny 
With an axe in chopped scull 
Plucked out tongue should spoil your face 
Making very frustrated scars 

Hell warrior 
Devil obsession 
Totally kills 
In massacre passion 

Faded eyes sinkin' in black 
Spreading the stench of rotten flesh 
Satan sent him to destroy poor humans 
And to rape the animals 

Age of darkness has just begun 
Distorted creatin shall only survive 
Hell warrior 
Is there to rule and just to kill you 

Hell warrior 
Devil obsession 
Totally kills 
In massacre passion
