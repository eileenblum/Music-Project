"Allmighty and allpowerful Seth 
Father of Darkness,King of Death 
I pledge this knife to thee 
To do thy work and to serve thee 

The bride of chaos 
The riders upon the beast 
Blood I give to you with this knife 
Which is thy life" 

In need of your soul,you 
Suck my solemn sword 
And the blazing axe is 
Right above your neck 

For the glory of the sky 
You must bleed instead of me 
Now,child is mine and 
It will serve in the darkland 

Fall on your knees and die 
You poor orphan 
Pray for the mercy 
And get ready for the blessed Death!
