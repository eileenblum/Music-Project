On the battle ground of important historical events 
Some stranglers of free human thought banished the intelligence 
So far away, away from our sphere 

In the fright and stopped the natural progress 
Bringing the constant horror into the depth of our souls 
Couriers of knowledge were driven down in dark cells 
The stake had expected them, they who stood behind the truth 

Fell into disfavour of asylum ignorantie 
But their dead pride had tried to escape 

On the battle ground of important historical events 
Some stranglers of free human thought banished the intelligence 
So far away, away from our sphere...... 
......in the fright
