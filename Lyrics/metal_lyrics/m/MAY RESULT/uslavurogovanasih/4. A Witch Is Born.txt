In a crooked house as old as the forest
A child was born in fire
Her hellish voice, her furious screams
In my crystal that night I could hear
Ten thousand childrean: The dau she was born
Suffered and died in their crypts
A witch is born
With eyes of lightning, raven black hair
She was a beauty
She came here to rule us all
With her cruelty
I admire her beauty, and
The madness that she brings
Singing in awe
Hail o new born witch
