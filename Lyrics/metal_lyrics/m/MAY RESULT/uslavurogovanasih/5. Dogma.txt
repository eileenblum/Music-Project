Selfconscious you are born 
Like individue controlled 
Too potent empty shell 
Feeling damage of my own personality 

I suffer in a field of control 

However,walls have fallen but in whose yield? 

Strange voices hidden jealousy 
The beginning of sad destiny 
Strangled in a courtesy 
Truth please show to me
