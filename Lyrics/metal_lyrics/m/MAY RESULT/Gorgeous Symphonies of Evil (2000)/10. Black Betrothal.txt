[Lyrics by Kozeljnik 1996]

Blood into my eyes
Shows you the flight of a Raven
At the midnight sky
Kiss me goodbye from heaven

Palms,unite your palms
and your heart is mine forever
The power of my Black Ring
Shows you that God was created
Invention from nothingness

Pure in Darkness,i'm burning
With your heart,with your soul
In my bloody Revenge
from Eternity,Immortality
You will burn with me in Hell

See,see the colour of my Life
and the colour of my Night
and the Hate in my eyes....
