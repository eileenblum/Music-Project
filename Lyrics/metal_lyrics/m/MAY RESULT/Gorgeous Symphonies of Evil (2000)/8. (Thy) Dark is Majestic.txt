[Lyrics by Kozeljnik 1996]

Dawns light had risen from her eyes
and became weak like candle's flame
'cause my Darkness - The Master of mine
and you'll never going to swallow that

Dark had hidden in my heart
and it locked it forever
with his Secret of the Dawn
The power of "HIS" Crown

The Artist by the Night
Majestic of thy Dark

"Erotically covered pulse fired me off
and my Vivid Nightmare became a Dream
of The Stars.There was a Dark hole
between her droughty legs,and my
Greedy Mouth had been waiting
for The Mouthfull......"

Darkness is Burning and Stinging me off
Gilds my Majestic Sword
Inside the Dark of The Glorious Moon
Seductions of mine are blacking your light

Moon sombred the night
and cursed your sickening lewd
with pain which you were enthroned
I embrace the light Devourer

(Thy) Dark is so Majestic!
(Thy) Dark is so Majestic!
(Thy) Dark is so Majestic!
(Thy) Dark is so Majestic!

Down Darkness rose from her eyes
and became The Power of Blackened Flame
'cause thy Darkness - The Master of mine
and for Eternity you shall swallow that!
