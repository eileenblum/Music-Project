Early summer morning
One man on his way
Out to play god
With his Ak
He started firing
And kept shooting
Until the clip was empty
He made the fuckers pay
Military madman
Out of control
Urban hunter
One man patrol
Mentally unstable
Going over the edge
Never to return
To the world of sanity
Life has left your body
Eyes once bright now has faded
Bloodred dawn
Lying dead and coldLifeless victims
Face down on the concrete
Seven wounded and one lay dead
My mission is complete
