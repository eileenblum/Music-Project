Terrorstruck 
Look deep into those fearful eyes
I suck in the fear
That seep out through every pore
Sick mind at work
Bewildered and in trance
Reach for your insides
To touch to feel and tear your soul apart
Bleed with you as I
Push the knife through your ribcage and in your heart
Lust and fulfillment
Warmth of your blood as it runs down on me
My hunger satisfied
When you scream and squirm in pain 
Knowing that you?ll die
Unsane insane and mentally deranged
Deep inside of me
Your soul will live on
Forever together
Entangled in the mysteries of afterlife
Bleed with you as I
Push the knife through your ribcage and into your heart
Lust and fulfillment
Warmth of your blood as it runs down on me
My hunger satisfied
When you scream and squirm in pain 
Knowing that you?ll die
Unsane insane and mentally deranged
