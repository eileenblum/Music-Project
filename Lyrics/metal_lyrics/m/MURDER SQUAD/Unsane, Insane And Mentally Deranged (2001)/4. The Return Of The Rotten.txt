I rise from my grave
A hunger rages deep inside
Awaken from my sleep
To feast on rotten flesh
Hear the call of my master satan
Obey without hesitation
Consume rot for purification
Set me free from this zombiefication
Centuries of slumber
Has come to end at last
Relieve my frustration
As I fuck the rotten flesh
I am a maggot colony
Pus seeping from my eyes
Return of the living dead
Smell the putrid stench
Hear the call of my master satan
Obey without hesitation
Consume flesh for purification
Set me free from this zombiefication
