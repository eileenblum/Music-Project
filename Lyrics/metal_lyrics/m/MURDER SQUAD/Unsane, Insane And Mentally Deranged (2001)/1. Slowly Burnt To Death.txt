Vile smell of burning flesh
Twisted corpses everywhere
Licked by flamer fire
Slowly burnt to death
Eyes melted in their sockets
Screaming as they died
Flesh fell from their bones
While they still were alive
Slowly burnt to death
Blood boiling in their veins
Flames consuming tender flesh
Slowly burnt to death
Mummyfied pygmefied
Reduced to infant size
Twisted tortured human features
Pain is their final deathmask
Slowly burnt to death
Slowly burnt to death
