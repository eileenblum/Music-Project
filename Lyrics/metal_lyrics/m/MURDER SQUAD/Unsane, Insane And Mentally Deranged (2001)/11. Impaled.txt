Anally impaled on a ten foot pole
Raised to the skies as a trophy
Praing for my blessed death
Pain tears my ravaged body
Vultures gather to hack out my eyes
Mind is fading as my body dies
I am the anal Christ
Hanging limp and close to death
Inhaling my last pained breath
Vision fades from red to black
As someone nibbles my ball sack
Humiliated and no manly pride
Father why has thou ass fucked me
I am the anal Christ
