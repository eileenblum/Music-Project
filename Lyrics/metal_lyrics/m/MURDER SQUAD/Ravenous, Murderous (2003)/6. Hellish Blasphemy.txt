Hellish blasphemy
Defiling of the church
Forces of darkness
And the inverted cross
Bloodred ritual
Desecrations
Vile canra; sacrifice
On altar torment

Pagan perversities
On holy soil
Feeds my hunger
Leaving me yearning for more
Cult of the dead bring me hell
Ritual orgies dance of the damned
Flames arice, flames of doom

Stripping skin removing flesh
Rusty blade cuts to the bone

"The sacrifice bleeds like a weakened lamb
Consciousness fades damned to fire
Boiling blood from Christian veins
Arteries all emptied
Trade salvation for pain
Satanized shitsoaked robes
The worst is yet to come"
