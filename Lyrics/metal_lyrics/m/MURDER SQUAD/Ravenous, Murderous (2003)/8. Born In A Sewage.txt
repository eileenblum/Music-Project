Bastard child of darkness, fire
Cold and cannibalism
I sit upon my throne of bone
While nuns devour my jism

Squads of murderous and blackened empty souls
Penetrate your mind and violate your holes

Born in sewage, bred in bile
And raised on tainted flesh
Teeth arot with epidermal
Victims banned to death

Your limbs are torn in two
Your brains are ground to stew
I feed upon your fear
You pray, your ass I spear

Lust engulf my bloodies eyes
And drives my quest to kill
My skin it crawls with mottled mites
My screams of torture shrill
