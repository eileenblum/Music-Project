I am the syringe in your eye
Injecting poison into your brain
I am the noose around your neck
That takes your breath away
I am the razorblade
Dancing across your wrists
I am the maggot devouring your flesh
When you are dead and buried

I follow you through life
From birth to the bitter end
Unseen yet always present
I am eternal, I am death

I am the blood red tide
Flowing from 1000 wounds
I am the pain you experience
As your soul tears apart
I am the torch that lights the stake
When you are burned alive
I am the horror in your heart
When you realise the end draws near

I am the darkness
Where you spend forevermore
I am eternal
I am death
