Eating on my rotting flesh
In theory I wouldn't be alive

Worms are crawling
Out of my wounds
I'm carving and cutting
Trying to dig them out
Eating, feasting
Consuming my flesh
My bones stripped bare
I'm being eaten alive

Ravaging my body
Stripping down my flesh
The enemy...
Army of worms

Death squad colony
They crawl up my ass
Feasting on rotting flesh
Hunger remains unsatisfied
Army of maggots
Gnawing and chewing
Tearing down the structures
A part of the decay

The process is nearly done
It's almost over
They're fucking with my head
