I've been saving my medication
And nobody has noticed
The nurse don't care
The doctors are oblivious
I've saved up a pile of multicolored pills
Today I took them all at once
And now I need to kill

Urging at my fellow patients
Foaming at the mouth
Eyes exploding from my head
All in this asylum soon will be dead
I'm disturbing the freaks
Yes, I'm disturbing the freaks

On a bloody rampage
I take down a whore
A vicious blow now she's
Even crazier than she was before

I stole a pair of scissors
And disemboweled a mute
I butchered up a basket case
Now I'll taste the blade too

Stabbing myself in the face
Puncturing my guts
Brutal slashes down both arms
Lying dying face down in my blood
