I hear voices deep within me
Finding out I'm not so strong
Sometimes I don't think so clearly
Get the feeling something's wrong

Wrong
Got it wrong
Always wrong
Something's wrong

Infectious
A scab unto the world
Seems that my whole life's been a farce
Wishing on the stars
I'm just a poster for what we shouldn't be
I put your whole world in a noose

On the surface I seem normal
Everything's as it should be
Farther down though I'm so ugly
Something you wont ever see

Wrong
Got it wrong
Always wrong
Something's wrong

Infectious
A scab unto the world
Seems that my whole life's been a farce
Wishing on the stars
I'm just a poster for what you shouldn't be
I put the whole world in a noose

Plagued with sickness
Stained from the inside out

Lately I don't feel so healthy
Get the feeling something's wrong

Wrong
Got it wrong
Always wrong
Something's wrong

Infectious
A scab unto the world
It seems that my whole life's been a farce
Wishing on the stars
You're just a poster for what I shouldn't be
You put this whole world in a noose
