Mixed agendas
You've got the right to remain defenseless
Trained not to think
Patriotic
Gun and a badge, now you've got a fascist
Slaves to the kings
Wave your flag now
Everyone swears that they stand for something
I'll never see
All your lying
You think by simply hiding it changes
I've reached my brink

'No' is the word you understand
'No' is the word you fear
'No' is the word you comprehend
So 'no' is the word you'll hear
I never really needed
I never really cared
I never really trusted
No one was fucking there
Everyone can see
Everyone, but me

Shadow boxing
You bite the hands that buy you your finance
Numbers and ink
Politicians
Backing the top percent of the nation
You're not in sync

'No' is the word you understand
'No' is the word you fear
'No' is the word you comprehend
So 'no' is the word you'll hear
I never really needed
I never really cared
I never really trusted
No one was fucking there
Everyone can see
Everyone, but me

Propaganda
The truth has emerged, the lies are retracting
Your time is done
Compensation
Don't wanna change, but we're gonna change it
Under the gun

'No' is the word you understand
'No' is the word you fear
'No' is the word you comprehend
So 'no' is the word you'll hear
I never really needed
I never really cared
I never really trusted
No one was fucking there
