Get Back
Never gonna corner me
Fuck tact
So tired of everybody
You got that?
Never gonna give an inch
And your opinion's absolutely shit

Mother told me
Never forget
Where you started from
All these years
I've lost my way and
Time has made me numb

Get Back
Never gonna corner me
Fuck tact
So sick of everybody
You got that?
Never gonna give an inch
And you and me is absolutely shit

As long as you are safe
And as long as you can hide
I'll never be the same
And that's fine

Cause I never gave enough to anyone
Never gave enough not to anything
Never gave enough not to anyone
Never gave a fuck

Get Back
Never wanna corner me
Fuck tact
So tired of everybody
You got that?
Never gonna give an inch
And you to me is absolutely shit

Mother told me
Never forget
Where you started from
Through these years
I've lost my way and
Time has made me numb

Get Back
Never gonna corner me
Fuck tact
So sick of everybody
You got that?
Never gonna give an inch
Cause your opinion's absolutely shit

As long as you are safe
And as long as you can hide
I'll never be the same
And that's fine

Cause I never gave enough to anyone
Never gave enough not to anyone

Get back
