Why is a scientist in a lab
To try to destroy all meaning of this life
Ripping from our man
Killing while you can
Murderer of this land
Breeding to destroy
Concepts that deploy fear in our eyes

They don't ever live to die
Only live to fight, fight, fight
They don't ever live to die
Only live to fight, fight, fight

Why do they play with strands of life today
To build clones from human DNA
Fighting for your life
Killing while you die
Your life's in their hands
Breeding to destroy
Concepts that deploy fear in our eyes

They don't ever live to die
Only live to fight, fight, fight
They don't ever live to die
Only live to fight, fight, fight

Why are we dying from within
The lie
We've been fed this cancer all our lives
Right out of the can
Injected again
Your life's in my hands
Breeding to destroy
Concepts that deploy fear in our eyes

They don't ever live to die
Only live to fight, fight, fight
They don't ever live to die
Only live to fight, fight, fight
