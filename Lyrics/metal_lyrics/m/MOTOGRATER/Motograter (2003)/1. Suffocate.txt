What's to say, heard you got roughed up
Once again you get left behind
Check yourself, don't get it twisted
Write yourself a formal good-bye

Fuck yourself, don't get it talked up
Got no qualms with taking your life
Quick to judge, quick to get tossed up
Dig yourself a formal good-bye

Suffocate, you're nothing to no one
Suffocate, you're living a lie

Suffocate, now you get nothing
No one left to help for you life
Got no love, get no love for you
No respect for you or your kind

Subjugate, now you got nothing
No one left to help you get by
Strap yourself, don't get it twisted
Kill yourself and that's how you die

Suffocate, you're nothing to no one
Suffocate, you're living a lie
Suffocate, you're nothing to no one
Suffocate, and that's how you die

I'm wasting precious moments trying not to suffocate
Some things aren't meant to be easy
Every muscle pulls the weight

Your face, empty, emotionless and ugly
Stamping, my hope, every single lie
You know, I can't, pull you above the storm
Everything, you got, you're just not who you pretend to be

Fuck yourself, don't get it tossed up
Got no qualms with taking your life
Fuck yourself, don't get it twisted
Dig yourself a formal good-bye

I'm wasting precious moments trying not to suffocate
Some things are meant to be easy
Every muscle pulls the weight

Suffocate
Suffocate
Suffocate
