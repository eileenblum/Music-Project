In the valley of light, there's dust
In the glory of pain, there's life
In the bellies of pigs, we rot
In the gullet of worms, we die

The engines turning and salvations growing dimm
And all I see, and all I see is red
My stomachs burning and the venoms soaking in
And it's all I feel, and all I feel is red

In the stories of time, we're lost
In the glories of rage, we fly
On the shackles that bind, there's rust
In the echoes of hell, we fly

The engines turning and salvations growing dimm
And all I see, and all I see is red
My stomachs burning and the knifes just digging in
And it's all I know, and all I know is red

Red

Needles and pins, needles and pins
Needles and pins, needles and pins
Needles and pins, needles and pins
Needles and pins

The engines turning and salvations growing dimm
And all I see and all I see is red
My stomachs burning and the venoms soaking in
And it's all I know, and all I'll know is red

Red
It's all red
Red
