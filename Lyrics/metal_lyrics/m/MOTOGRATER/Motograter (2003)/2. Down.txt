We're falling throughout eternity
The clock is ticking and your still counting sheep
You're still half asleep

There's no one coming (There's no one coming)
And there's no way out (And there's no way out)
I've been falling (Well I've been falling)
And it's so far down

Shrouded beneath a veil of tragedy
When death comes calling
Who will you believe?
Tell me who will you believe
When it's down to you and me
Will you still stay on your knees?

(Who will you believe?)
(When it's down to you and me)

There's no one coming (There's no one coming)
And there's no way out (And there's no way out)
I've been falling (Well I've been falling)
And it's so far down (And it's so far down)
There's no one coming (There's no one coming)
And there's no way out
There's no way out
No way out

Pushing me down
Breaking me down
There's always something pushing me down
Breaking me down

Pushing me down
Breaking me down
There's always something pushing you down
Breaking me down

Pushing me down
Breaking me down
There's always something pushing you down
Breaking you down

Pushing me down
Breaking you down
There's always something pushing you back,
Pushing you back

Rise

I'm pushing you back, I'm pushing you back, rise
I'm pushing you back, I'm pushing you back, rise
I'm pushing you back, I'm pushing you back

There's no one coming
And there's no way out
Well I've been falling
And it's a long way down

Down
