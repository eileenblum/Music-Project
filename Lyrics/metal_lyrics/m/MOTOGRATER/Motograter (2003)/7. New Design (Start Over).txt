I woke up today
Didn't feel like I had slept at all
Just another restless night
Such a reckless life
I wish that I could take it slow
Live it simple day by day
But there's always something new
Something in the way

Id like to change the hands of time
Start over, someone hit rewind
Break ground and build a new design
Start over, leave this all behind

Thumbing through the paper
It's the same old black and white
One man gets to live
And a dozen have to die
The reality that we create
We cross the lines we love to hate
Something we see everyday
But we always choose to look away

I'd like to change the hands of time
Start over, someone hit rewind
Break ground and build a new design
Start over, leave this all behind

The times have changed
But were still the same
The cycle just repeats itself
It goes on and on
The times have changed
But were still the same
The cycle just repeats itself
It goes on and on and on
On and on and on

Creeping down the boulevard
Among the walking dead
They're numb to nearly everything
Accepting what they're fed

I'd like to change the hands of time
Start over, someone hit rewind
Break ground and build a new design
Start over, leave this all behind

The times have changed
But were still the same
The cycle just repeats itself
It goes on and on
The times have changed
But were still the same
The cycle just repeats itself
It goes on and on and on
