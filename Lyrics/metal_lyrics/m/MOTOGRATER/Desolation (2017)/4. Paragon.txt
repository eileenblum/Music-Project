I have taken all that I can stand
No more sinking in the quicksand
You cannot distance yourself
Your hands are stained with blame
Incriminating yourself, so damn obscene
So sick of deception, I have come undone
This is the anthem for what we've become

And I will bury you alive
I will bury you
Inside a sarcophagus of my design
This is my design

You say, you're a paragon of virtue
You claim that I am nothing without you
You care of the talents of the ones you used
And now I'm taking back what's mine

And I will bury you alive
I will bury you
Inside a sarcophagus of my design
This is my design (my design)

Choking on your own lies, sweet Judas
No one leaves here alive, sweet Judas

And I will bury you alive
I will bury you
Inside a sarcophagus of my design
This is my design
And I will bury you alive
I will bury you
Inside a sarcophagus of my design
This is my design
