As I awaken to the storm
Sorrow raining down on me
So hollow and alone
You were never there for me

I'll see you once again
When the darkness comes for me

I am haunted by the ghost of you
Tried to save myself
But the memory keeps bleeding through

As the shadows start to fall
Reaching deep inside of me
Taking everything away
Lost for all eternity

I am haunted by the ghost of you
Tried to save myself
But the memory keeps bleeding through
Bleeding through
Bleeding through
Bleeding through
All the memories keep bleeding through

I'll see you once again
When the darkness comes for me

I am haunted by the ghost of you
Tried to save myself
But the memory keeps bleeding
I am haunted by the ghost of you
Tried to save myself
But the memory keeps bleeding through
Bleeding through
Bleeding through
Bleeding through
All the memories keep bleeding through
