This form is just a passing phase
Nothing can last forever
Corrosion closing in on me
It's over
Feeling the curse of vanity
This painful memory mocks me
A visage of steady decline
Atrophy

Hopeless

I will fade away
Become nothing
A ghost of who I used to be
I will just decay
This is my fate
A ghost of who I used to be

I see the bloom of new decay
A vision of my future
Grieving for what is left of me
I'm fading
Buried beneath the sands of time
We're only born to suffer
Longing for the impossible
Forever

Hopeless

I will fade away
Become nothing
A ghost of who I used to be
I will just decay
This is my fate
A ghost of who I used to be

Consumed by a sense of longing
As I become nothing at all

I will fade away
Become nothing
A ghost of who I used to be
I will just decay
This is my fate
A ghost of who I used to be

I will fade away (fade away)
Become nothing
A ghost of who I used to be (used to be)
I will just decay (just decay)
This is my fate
A ghost of who I used to be (used to be)
