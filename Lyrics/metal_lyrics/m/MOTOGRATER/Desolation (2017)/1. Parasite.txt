You feed upon the soft of heart
Seeking solace in their sympathy
Parasite
Your person mask is slipping now
Face it motherfucker you are dead to me

I can see right through your lies
I can see right through your lies
And I know just what you are
And I know just what you are

You're everything that I have grown to hate
So save your lies your words mean nothing to me

You are a plague all consuming
Darkness hiding deep within your heart
Your tainted touch is pestilence
This is the addiction that tears you apart

I can see right through your lies
I can see right through your lies
And I know just what you are
And I know just what you are

You're everything, that I have grown to hate
So save your lies, your words mean nothing to me

And who's to blame
No resolve or conviction
It's all the same
Time to down the dying sun
You're as hollow
As the bottle that you clutch
The time has come
To face the monster you've become

You're everything that I have grown to hate
So save your lies your words mean nothing to me
You're everything that I have grown to hate
So save your lies your words mean nothing to me

Nothing to me!
