There's a place in the shadows
Deep inside me where hatred grows
And if you would just let go
I would show you what lies below

I'll never be like them
They'll always call us strange
Their hypocritic ways
Are driving me insane
I'd rather end it all
Than have to live this way
Just let me be myself
Or stay out of my way

Stay out of my way

Shaking with anger
There's no forgiveness
It's never ending
I'm so fucking sick of this

Say goodbye to the judgment
And just let go of all you know
You belong on the outside
They will hate what they can't control

They think they're so perfect
Looking down on the strange
Sitting upon their thrones
I'll take it all away
I felt a hate again
Erupting out of me
I want to make them pay
And feel my agony

Feel my agony

Filling with hatred
Straight out of the abyss
There will be bloodshed
I'm so fucking sick of this

Misanthropical
I'm so fucking sick of this
Misanthropical
I'm so fucking sick of this

I think I'm going insane
I think I'm going insane
I think I'm going insane
I think I'm going insane

I think I'm going insane
I think I'm going insane
I think I'm going insane
I'm so fucking sick of this

Misanthropical
I'm so fucking sick of this
Misanthropical
I'm so fucking sick of this
Misanthropical
I'm so fucking sick of this
Misanthropical

Misanthropical
