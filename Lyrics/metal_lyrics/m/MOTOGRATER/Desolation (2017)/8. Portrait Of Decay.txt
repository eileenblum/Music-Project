There is no light at the end of the tunnel
There is only pain and suffering
On hands and knees we crawl through broken dreams
Always trying to become something

A shadow hangs over us all
Consuming everything in its wake
So drained of every ounce of hope
That we keep making the same fucking mistakes

Under the weight of the crashing waves
There is no hope, it's all been washed away
So beaten down and so thrown away
I am broken, a portrait of decay

The taste of failure
Still lingers in my mouth
Slowly becoming part of me
I am a nightmare
Blackened to my core
And happiness was never meant for me

Collapsing beneath the crushing weight
Taking all the air out of me
The sun may never rise again
And you and I were never meant to be

Under the weight of the crashing waves
There is no hope, it's all been washed away
So beaten down and so thrown away
I am broken, a portrait of decay

I've got nothing left to lose
I've got nothing left to lose
I've got nothing left to lose
I've got nothing left to lose

Under the weight of the crashing waves
There is no hope, it's all been washed away
So beaten down and so thrown away
I am broken, a portrait of decay

A portrait of decay
