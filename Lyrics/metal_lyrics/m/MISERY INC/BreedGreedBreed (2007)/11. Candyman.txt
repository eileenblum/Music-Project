Blessed are those, who don't feel the same. I'm a living freak, can't wash away my stain.
Devil is laughing in front of my face. This is my own nightmare, evil rat race.
I can't help myself doing these things. Someone else is pulling my strings!

Snow, white, skin, young, flesh is my sin. Judge me!

How could I laugh, I can't even smile. Welcome aboard, this is my death style.
Sweet child of mine, in the arms of a swine!
I've got it all, I am twisted, I am cancer!
I'm here for all you freaks, I'm the devil's answer!

Snow, white, skin, young, flesh is my sin. Judge me!
I have passed the point of return.
Snow, white, skin, young, flesh is my sin. Judge me!
I have learnt, I will never learn...
