Closing your eyes won't offer solution.
I'm king of the hill, I am cream of the cream!
After all this, there's one conclusion.
I'm living in sin, but I'm living my dream!

No room for loser! No room for loser!

She's got a ticket, but no ride! (Last train left and whistled "You'll Die")
Left in the dark, shouting goodbye. (No one's out there by her side)
She's got a ticket, but no ride! (Last train left and whistled "You'll Die")
There's no way out this night, and no one's out there by her side!

I accuse you and I'm waiting for your answer.
I throw it back, opinions based on facts!
Can't you see our future killed by the cancer?
That's far away, and I'm not even coming back!

You don't give a shit, if there is no tomorrow.
You exhale too much, your next breath you'll borrow!

(Mutual respect, we're heading towards a dead end. Late regrets before mother's revenge!)

She's got a ticket, but no ride! (Last train left and whistled "You'll Die")
Left in the dark, shouting goodbye. (No one's out there by her side)
She's got a ticket, but no ride! (Last train left and whistled "You'll Die")
There's no way out this night, and no one's out there by her side!
