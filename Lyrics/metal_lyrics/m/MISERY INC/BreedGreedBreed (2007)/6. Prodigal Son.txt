Follow the lead clown here. Burn your eyes with a pile of lies.
Turn the wheels of fear. Mindless saviour in disguise.
Hooray for the foray. Together or alone, they should be at home.
I can't believe my eyes. Burn your eyes with a pile of lies.

No boundaries for stupidity!
Hollow stare, we all should beware.
Pointing fingers, pointing guns!
OK for him, forbidden for us.

Red carpet for the prodigal son, red carpet!

How you run, how you run,
now look what you have done!
I wish I could follow blindly smiling,
follow blindly smiling the prodigal son.

Prepare yourself once again.
Stifle your cry, repressed anger.
Wipe out, destroy and win!
Weep for joy. Welcome manic vulgar.
Vote, use your voice, it's a choice.
Respect the rest of your humanity.
Fuck the failed system!
One way ticket to insanity!
