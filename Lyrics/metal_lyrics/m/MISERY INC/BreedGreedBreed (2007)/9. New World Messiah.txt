Minute after minute, slave after slave, hour after hour, grave after grave!
Day after day, they cut out my tongue. Year after year, there's still no one!

Try to carve truth out of a lie! Wordless speech, all we buy. Clock is ticking for saviour!
Follow the leader, follow the ghost, sure we all listen, and love our host! Clock is ticking for saviour!

New world messiah, lay down your mercy hand.
New world messiah, and save this poor land.

Mirror, mirror on the wall, whose head it is to fall?

Truth or dare, which one is best?
Give up, or take a bullet to your chest.
Clock is ticking for saviour!

Breathe - Life will change.
Sleep - Life will change.
Dream on - Life will change!
