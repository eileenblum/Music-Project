No escape from unwelcome memory. This time it's really, really haunting me.
Which way to go? Which one is real? What can I take? What can I steal?
Is it worth trying at all? We're living in peace, this is not war!

Someone help me with my obsession. I'm so close to giving up!
I seize to wonder. Don't follow me, I'm going under.

Fool them once, fool them twice, with smile on my face I swallow their lies.
I refuse to be one of you!

Someone help me with my obsession. I'm so close to giving up!
I seize to wonder. Don't follow me, I'm going under.
Breaking point of my self-deception, somehow I'm running out!
My conscience slumbers. Don't follow me, I'm going under.
