My turn now, finally it's payback time, my turn now!
Eye for an eye, systematic violence, eye for an eye!

Inch by inch, break your every fucking bone!
Give one excuse I have nothing to lose,
Turn bitch and run I shoot to kill with this gun!

Eat you alive, do you really know my name, eat you alive!
Now it's real, I decide who survives, now it's real!

Bone by bone, break your every fragile bone!
Give one excuse I have nothing to lose
Turn bitch and run I shoot to kill with this gun
Just for fun!

I was never enough, silence can kill.
Still your looks and expressions tell me that I'm just a fucking nil!

I am after you! I want your blood, I'll get it soon!
Your head on a plate! face my fury, face my hate!
My 15 minutes of fame! you got it now, this is not a game!
Worthless to beg now, I'm here to kill!
Still your looks and expressions tell me that I'm just a fucking nil!

Give one excuse I have nothing to lose
Turn, turn bitch and run I shoot to kill with this gun
Just for fun!!
