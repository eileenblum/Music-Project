Like father, like son in war we ride.
I'm the chosen one god on my side.
We'll multiply, never-ending line.
Heretics will die, blood flows like wine.

Swallow a lie, you'll like the taste.
Modern day human waste!
Like sipping wound, you can never stop us!
Prepare yourself for the end of your days,
modern day human waste!

I look to the west and all I see is red! West, and all I see is Red!
Only the dead have seen the end of the war. No one ever came back through the door!

Reach for the sky, reborn again!
Vengeance is mine, reborn again!
