You don't fit in, you're not welcome anymore, you're vanished.
You don't exist, you're a number fade to slumber,
you're vanished, disappeared.
You don't fit in! You don't exist!

Your life is not real. I wanna see you suffer begging for mercy.
You should beware!

Thirty years, bitter tears, pages turn.
Thirty years, bitter tears, no one learns.

They all will get what they deserve!
Fury keeps me going, trying, breathing, walking, fighting, everything!

Hours, years, tons of time,
seconds, days, wasted life.

Late, far too late.
It's the end of your precious time.
Hate, just pure hate! I'm asking you to die.

Thirty years, bitter tears, pages turn.
Thirty years, bitter tears, no one learns.

They all will get what they deserve!
Fury keeps me going, trying, breathing, walking, fighting, everything!

Thirty years, my best years, I gave away,
Like they're nothing for you today.
