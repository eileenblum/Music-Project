What the hell I'm standing here? Faceless people everywhere.
Should I feel lucky? Happy?
Thanks for nothing again! I call you liar!

Certain things I can never forgive; cutting the rope twice and let you live!
There will be no time to forget.

Fall of the idol - authority. Hardest way to find mortality.
Liquid life runs down too fast. Every weekend drives me further!

Gather your sheep before evil arrives. Turn your seat, there's no need to deny.

Can't find a shadow without light.
So there is still some hope, still some hope left.
You keep on calling this a child's life.
Is there still some hope, still some hope?

Avoid addiction, avoid the past, change the pattern, make it last.
Should I feel pride? Thanks for nothing again!
I call you liar!

Save me from your pathetic lies!
No need kneel before your name.

Can't find a shadow without light.
So there is still some hope, still some hope left.
You keep on calling this a child's life.
Is there still some hope, still some hope?
Swore I'd never be the same.
Drink by drink you drown, hit the ground!
