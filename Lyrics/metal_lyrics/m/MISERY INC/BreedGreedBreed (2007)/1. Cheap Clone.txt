I don't give a shit, what you're whining!
You can stick your head to, where sun's not shining!
Run, run while you can. If you stay I'll smash you!
Run, run for your life, or I'll kill you, all!

Easy to judge but where's your credits, sir?
Without a name, you point your finger on me.
Easy to hide but where's your credits, sir?
Without a face, you point your finger on me.

I could not care less, what you are writing!
I can only smile and see you dying!
Courage, have you heard? Face to face war!
Listen, listen well! You message board whore!

24/7 alone, you're a cheap clone
No potential at all, how low you can fall
24/7 alone, we're all cheap clones
No potential at all, how low we can fall

Speak, tell the world, I'm no replacer!
Shout, let the world know I'm a motherfucking eraser!

24/7 alone, you're a cheap clone
No potential at all, how low you fall
24/7 alone, we're cheap clones
No potential at all, how low we fall
No potential at all
Finally you'll find yourself crawling, it's you who falls!
