There is no man beyond redemption. No act can undo the will of heaven.

Iâve never met an evil man or a woman who has devil eyes.
Iâve never touched a demon child or an angelâs hand, to my knowledge.
And I beg to differ with those who count me fortunate. For the matter I might tempt my fate.

But now that Iâm numb again, my sanity speaks of things that I cannot ignore.
Inasmuch as I dismiss the helpless, loneliness creeps up on me.

Iâve seen villains become of men, the polluted minds of scheming women.
Mere children born to living hell, a place so far outside of heaven.
Brothers and sisters seperated at birth, suffering at the hands of barbarians.

But now that Iâm numb again, my sanity speaks of things that I cannot ignore.
Inasmuch as I dismiss the helpless, loneliness creeps up on me.

Iâve walked the beautiful fields of Armageddon and trembled before the holocaust gates.
I lost my breath somewhere inbetween and found myself no longer fearing for my safety.
