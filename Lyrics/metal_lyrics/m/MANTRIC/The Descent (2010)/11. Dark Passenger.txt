[feat. guest vocals by Ilkka Viitasalo of Benea Reach / ex-Selfmindead]Vast is the emptiness growing inside, like a black hole sucking me in.
A hollow casket buried deep, no ruin to cling onto.
A destitute room without the comfort of despair, bleaker than the face of a demon.

Dark is the shadowside, weary and cold.
A haunted place where hopelessness grows.
Out of its own accord the earth runs to dust - to dust through my hand.

Iâm lost in a haze, found in perpetual sleep.
A near mortal sting, deadlier than a voodoo snake, sings me lullaby.
In this deserted place I welcome you... I welcome you.

Iâm lost in a haze, found in perpetual sleep. A near mortal sting sings me lullaby.

A vehicle broken and restored by unconditional love, the body is a vessel of Godâs glory.

As if by a chemical trick, Iâm sedated with imagery. An elusion of truth and desire.
Incidents I cannot recall, drowned in motion circular.
A familiar dullness, the wheel of the wasteland.
