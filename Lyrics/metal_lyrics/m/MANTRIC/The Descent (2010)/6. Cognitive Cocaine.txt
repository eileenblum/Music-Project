My dear friend, once again I seek your heart. You know I hated you right from the start.
Iâm so glad you listened when I told you that itâs up to you to find your own truth.

Years have passed, the poison from my fruit of pride fades,
so now the time is ripe for another bite.

Please remember that youâll bow to no one, no oneâs got the right to say youâre wrong.
What you think is right for you is right, and what you consider white is truly white.

Take these few silver coins, sparkling like stars.
You have them all deserved, keep them close now.

And when the quiet voice inside starts asking "What if youâre wrong?",
please turn up the volume on this song.

You have grown in my eyes, you have shown strength.
Donât you feel great and proud? You can do all...
