Thereâs a bullet in mid-air, I felt it run by my head.
And as it passed I heard it call out a name.
And I turned to see if my time had come to fall around dead.

In the line of fire, blood ânâ rain falls on all men alike. All fall on desperate days.

Listen to the sound of life over death, ringing in my ear.
An invasion of the brain, an intrusion of the heart.
The hand that reaches out for he who cries for help.

In the line of fire, blood ânâ rain falls on all men alike. All fall on desperate days.

Thereâs no hiding, no saying when destiny will point and strike her hand.

We all fall short on desperate days.

In the line of fire, blood ânâ rain falls on all men alike. All fall on desperate days.
In the line of fire, blood ânâ rain falls on all men alike.

Lightning strikes in a split second. Earth shakes and feets tremble.
Now is the time. In the waking hour He will come like a thief in the night.

We all live in desperate times. Blood and rain.
