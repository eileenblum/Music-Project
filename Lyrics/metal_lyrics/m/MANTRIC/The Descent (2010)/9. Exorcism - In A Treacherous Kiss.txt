Filth crawls near, but Iâll kick it off my feets. (Liar, Liar)
I wonât go down. No, I wonât drown. (Beware, Beware)

I will turn the light around and illuminate the pestilent dirt.
I will change the uniform infamy and unmask that leprous crowd.

Then when I curse the brainless thieves and bring them down onto their knees...
Iâll feed them their lies, serve freedom undisguised, display truth,
rob them blind, strip them of their tolerance crown.

So in the name of independence, let the revolution begin with the parrots.
