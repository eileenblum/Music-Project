[feat. guest vocals by Ilkka Viitasalo of Benea Reach / ex-Selfmindead]The dream came to me by will written blood.

A vision handed down. A white unicorn. Desire and love. The one horn.
The written word speaks of this. Confessions and promises.

Morning rise oh fabulous, donât leave me in the evening.
Meet me on the mountain in person by your willing.

The dream came to me by will written blood.
The ancient prophecy bound in all eternity.

A vision handed down. A white unicorn. Desire and love. The one horn.
The written word speaks of this. Confessions and promises.

Morning rise oh fabulous, donât leave me in the evening.
Meet me on the mountain in person by your willing.

The light is mine to keep and it cannot be stolen.
For I have seen it once and itâs all I need here on earth. The fire from the heavens.

A vision handed down. A white unicorn. Desire and love. The one horn.
The written word speaks of this. Confessions and promises.
