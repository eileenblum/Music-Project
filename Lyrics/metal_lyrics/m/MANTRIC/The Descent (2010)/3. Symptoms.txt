Breathe in the air that we breathe out, filled with sweet smoke, to sedate your spirit.
Youâve got our word you will feel better. And we all know thatâs what itâs all about.

We are the enlightened, high above doctrines, morally independent, liberated from history.

We took the liberty to replace glass with mirrors.
Trust us - soon you will forget about the concept of windows.

Deep down you will miss the view, but you will never know,
as you will be kept busy trying to look like one of us.

Donât mind meaning, just lift your skirt and entertain us until our eyes hurt.
Escaping silence is what we need, so sing us songs until our ears bleed.

We are the privileged, miserable elite, happily bound with our shackles of choices.
So donât bother trying to open our eyes, we donât really want to see it.
Weâve got nothing to say, still youâll never get away from the noise of our voices.

Donât mind meaning, just lift your skirt and entertain us until our eyes hurt.
Escaping silence is what we need, so sing us songs until our ears bleed.

We rule the cultures of insight and strength, blinding our children with needles of pleasure.
An era of greatness and wisdom and wealth will soon reach its highlight with egos exploding.

We took the liberty to replace glass with mirrors.
Trust us - soon you will forget about the concept of windows.
