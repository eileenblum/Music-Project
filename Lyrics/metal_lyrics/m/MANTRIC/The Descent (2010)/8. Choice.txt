Welcome into rest for souls. Let go of your false control.

Resist the lethal lies of fear, please dare to dream.

Lay down your strife and gain life.

Resist the lethal lies of fear, please dare to dream.
Hold on to hope you once received, before you were deceived.

If you donât grasp this straw, youâll remain a slave under the law.
If you donât cease this grace, youâll remain a shadow of your true self.
If you never dare to stop listening to lies, youâll never really...never really live before you die.
Your accuser will never give up on his goal - imprisoning your soul. Now, letâs shut him up.

Youâre found worthy of being loved... Plead "not guilty....anymore"!
