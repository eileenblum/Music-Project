Heâs more visible now than ever. As of fire Iâm kindled anew.
By Spirit driven in the wind, free and to someplace new.
Let the past be past through forgiveness and learning not to forget.

Save for me and my friend, thereâs no one who comes by this way.
Sure, Iâve had the company of family, friends and female.
Both true love and disguised villain, day in day out like the clock in my hand.
But no one travels along this road no more, except for me and my dear friend Jesus.

âCause though we part and fall apart and sometimes die even, the journey goes on the same.
And as I always say, this oneâs only just begun. And as I always say, this oneâs only just begun.

My carriage is old and heavy, majestic like the mother of ships.
Summoned by Father in heaven, my chest carries treasure to His kingdom.
But the weight that I drag will go overboard, my pocket of pennies gives way for salt.
I desire to hit port in a burning passion, inflamed with thirst for living water.

The wheels turn round and run feverish with fire.
I canât bear the dust plains no more. All I need is water. I see that now.
