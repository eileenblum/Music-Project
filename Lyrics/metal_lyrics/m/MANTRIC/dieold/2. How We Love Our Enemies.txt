Addicted to distractions, we're terrified by peace.
Oh, how we love our enemies.
Where would we be without them? Trembling, on our knees.
Skip the facts and prepare for the counter-attack.
Oh, how we love our enemies. Without them, we'd be lost at sea.
Dear enemies, come help us find a direction, somewhere to point our hatred at. The bigger the imaginary threat, the tighter we bond and the closer we get.
Addicted to distractions, we're terrified by peace.
Oh, how we love our enemies. Where would we be without them?
So come on, give us some Arabs, Jews or Christians,
condemning, mean Conservatives or simply a few godless Liberals,
the young ignorants or the arrogant old.
Whosoever, as long as they are useful to maintain this imagined war that brings purpose to our lives, as we may see ourselves as soldiers of good.
Whosoever, as long as they are useful to maintain this imagined war that gives meaning to our lives, as we may see ourselves as part of something greater.
We'll do anything to hide our own sin.
Oh, how we love our enemies. Oh, how we love our enemies.
Where would we be?
