These days, I must admit I feel invincible
But all it'd take to make me fall, would be a small infection
And you'd see me crawl, as helpless as an infant
Yet more whiny and complaining, and a lot less entertaining
As I'd curse my fate, who took away
My strength, my plans and precious pride
- Rightfully mine, I'd say, convinced that I had somehow earned them
But if the only other option here, would be a life in fear to activate my fantasy
- Find every might-be-tragedy and every possibility, disasters would occur
I think I'd rather stay right here.
- I'd stick to naivity, my childlike positivity
An arrogant approach to this miraculous, great mystery
This gift that has been given me without me even asking
