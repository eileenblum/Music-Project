Dead, all dead. Lying there on the ground
That's how I found them, in piles
They must have starved to death. Dying by inches
I find there's a funeral in my garden
A lonely prayer for silent souls
Crows are gathering. I feel like killing them
To stop them from screaming
Looking into the mirror of opposites
I find my wry face, inside a sunken skull
Blank, oblivion eyes. Hollowed out and stolen
I'm trapped in a thousand-yard stare
If I could save but one, it would change the world
If I could reverse time, it would make no difference
There's no undoing the past, and there's no redoing the future
