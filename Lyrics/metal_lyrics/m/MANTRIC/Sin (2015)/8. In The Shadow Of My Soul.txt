The world pulls me in. With its beauty and poison
It's and attraction. More than a distraction
I'm dangling. My head can barely hold my feet
The world pollutes my soul. I wear its clothes
I am its mold. Then it leaves me
Cold, unwhole and utterly alone
I am of this world. Disposed to its charms
And ways of redemption. But in the end
Spiritual darkness. I choose entirely on my own
I set up my mind a long time ago. To follow Jesus
And let everything else go
