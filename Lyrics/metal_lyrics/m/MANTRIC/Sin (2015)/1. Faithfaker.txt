Depression then submission, exhausting, life is at war
- A gentle heartbeat waking the giant, more complex than I've imagined
Insane rather than deadly. And it made me burst
Enthralled by the swoon, captivated way too soon
The panic changed the game, Hosanna You're still that beautiful flame
The fever kept me sane. Hosanna, the calmness had Your name
Strayed from the path, gave the devil a laugh
Submission, repossession. Haunting, light up the shores
The panic changed the game. Hosanna You're still that beautiful flame
The fever kept me sane. Hosanna, the calmess had Your name
Luminous love. Bowed down in dark times. And felt lost in white crimes
Tried to hide in your shade. Tried to be unafraid.
The panic changed the game. Hosanna You're still that beautiful flame
The fever kept me sane. Hosanna, the calmess had Your name.
Tried to hide in your shade. Tried to be unafraid
