Lord have mercy upon me. Spare me from damnation
Have mercy Lord. Spare me from the sword
Release me from the chains. Wake me from my slumber
Look upon me and remember. In the name of the Son
Lower the Spirit. Lower the rope
Shield me from evil. Spread wings of holy over me
Send your guardian angels. Let them speak in heavenly tongues
Come o Lord. Please come rescue me
Deliver me from myself. Search my spirit and heal my soul
Rinse out my ears and spring my eyes open
When I stray show me wisdom and insight
Lead me always on the path of the righteous
Bless this house with the Lord
Maranatha
