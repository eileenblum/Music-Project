Rather than kingdoms, give me eyes who see the blessings
That surround me from when I wake up, 'til I smile myself to sleep
Rather than might, give me eyes. Who see worth beyond a prize
In every single one of those annoying souls I now despise
Rather than kingdoms, give me eyes who see the blessings
That surround me from when I wake up, 'til I smile myself to sleep
Rather than might, give me eyes. Who see worth beyond a prize
In every single one of those, annoying souls I now despise
Rather than approval, give me ears to hear the music that surrounds me
Made by waves and wind and wagtails, and the heartbeats I pass by
Rather than success, I long for lack of emptiness
Something solid in my life, eternal truth, and nothing less
Rather than approval, give me ears to hear the music that surrounds me
Made by waves and wind and wagtails, and the heartbeats I pass by
Rather than success, I long for lack of emptiness
Something solid in my life, eternal truth, and nothing less
