Artists all around. Work so hard to avoid happiness
Oh, how deep you sound, but I'm not impressed
What's so wise about narcissistic whimpering, nihilistic failure?
It sure beats me. But you won't wipe this smile off my face
I'll think of sun when days are cloudy. I'll squeeze as much joy out of
Every given day that I am a man for. Don't get in my way
'Cause you won't wipe this smile off my face
Won't close my eyes to the deeds of cruelty
But what I'll choose to embrace is beauty
And I'll stick to my plan - to die old with a smile upon my lips
