You can't get a job
Living on a relief and a faked. works
It's hard
The promise
Still we're hanging on 
We are living in our ghetto
Like a rats
There's a place
Future's the night
Nothing to lose and the money is gone
Trying to survive and we're trying to forget
Where's a land were future's the past
Tomorrow just got promise

Our dreams went up in ashes
A fucking situation
Hopeless plight
A poverty in fucking dirty land
Still we are hanging on
Down in stinking section
We are living in the system of death
There is no good for you and me
Ashes of dreams all that I see
Trying to survive and we're trying to forget
Where is a land where future's the past
Valer can't get a job
