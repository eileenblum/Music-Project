It doesn't matter what you say
You always look so perfect
You never listen and never look
You cover soul hide feelings
To wipe all sorrows from your mind
The blind man kissing hand of baseness
I see your face like a stone
Your eyes of ice and heart so deaf

A fire zone
In our land
A centre of gloom
A creeping pain
A rotting zone
In our place
A heart of dankness
Can't turn back

Your life so simple you don't feel pain
An addiction to duplicities
Stains on the memory 
Stains on the hands
I hear your scoffing laughter
Burned by fire the flame of greed
Full of kindness truths compassion
The emptiness is filling you
You push your life but it's too late

It doesn't matter what you reach
You always look majestic
You never listen and never look
I hear your scoffing laughter
Burned by fire the flame of hate
Full of kindness truths compassion
I see your face like a stone
You eyes of ice
