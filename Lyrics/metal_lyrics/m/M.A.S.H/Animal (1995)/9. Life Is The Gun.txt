Just try and cross the line
Don't bother me don't waste my time
Look at yourself
Beaten lost
In a state of prostration no good for you
Inherit strength
Squash the meek
You gotta continue to look for the power of life
Life that's within you
Discard the fears
You gotta continue to look for a new way a spirit
Time to choose
No more cry no more wail no fucking cry
Don't escape
You'd better change your mind
With this hope with this faith
In these days
Self confidence and persistence

Learn to be like me
But maybe you ain't never gotta feel this way
It's time to rise
Take this or live it
You're a bullet life is the gun

Little boy a coward inside
Your submission killed your light
The light in hour head
Strength the right way human pride
The will to be out of control that's free
All your frustration lives under skin
Leave it behind
Look for dignity
Let's stop pretending and justifying
