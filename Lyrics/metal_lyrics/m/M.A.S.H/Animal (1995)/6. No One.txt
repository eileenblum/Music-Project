I don't forget
When I grow up
I was a prisoner in my hell
We are hated for anything
Infected ground
We are living in our shells
Missed it right
You turned down hand
It swells my hatred under my skin
Do you want this rage
Missed It right
My strength is inside me
You see us coming with your sins

We stand tall
You're dying
Lonely without friends
They forget they are forgotten 
Written on your grave

I don't regret
I was rebel fight now
I am trampling hard on this trail
Whatever feelings
Left behind me

Toy broken toy
Fucked up spit on not again
Missed it right
You turned down hand
It swells my hatred under my skin
Do you want this rage
Missed it tight
My strength is inside me
You see us coming with your sins
No one can piss on my decision
I don't want to be you
My strength is inside me
Spank me kick me
You want to destroy me
But you can only suck my balls
You can see
Nobody'll touch us
Can't lock me can't break me
Who says I ain't right
My world of one speak up the good things
Get out
I keep deep inside me
Can't bring the hammer down
