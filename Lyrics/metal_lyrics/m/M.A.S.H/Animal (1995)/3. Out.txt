From our lives beginning on
We are pushed in little forms
No one asks us how we like to be
In school they teach you what to thing
But everyone says different things
But they're all convinced that
They're the ones to see
Pushing til there's nothing more to hear

Leave me I want be to live my life and to be free
Leave me I want be alone to do things on my own
