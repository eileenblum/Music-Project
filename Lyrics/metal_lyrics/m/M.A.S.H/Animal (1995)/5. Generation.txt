There's no time to keep it low
Small creature you are
It's all the same in the end
No hesitation victim die

Generation
Leper from inside
Generation
I'll die in this sick world of mine
Generation
They spit on me
Generation
In my home land
In my mouth
Dirt

What the hell am I
Hate to see
Hate to feel
I want to taste suicide
Down in a hole my peace
My way
I had dream last night I was blind
