In falling rain bloody drops
Bloody tears from the sky
See the victims of the hate
We see love worn away
Beaten and torn child without a name
The next child has lost the race
Prostitution for the meals,
Money, drugs and liberty
In the wind
We hear our screams
You must cry without weeping
To scream without raising your voice
Fear is your home
