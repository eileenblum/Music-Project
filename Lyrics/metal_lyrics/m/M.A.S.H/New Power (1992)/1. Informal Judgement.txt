Darkness from rulers to ingenious pawns
No limits to nonsense
It's being born in minds
Emptiness, stupidity that tears apart
An idea about tomorrow
Suspenses arise
Killing hope
Killing calm 
the avalanche is starting deeply in my soul
Vileness of the world you just can't see
Your common fashion
Irritation, isolation, nothing more to add
Boredom is killing joy of life
In society
No one cares
Lifeless logic
Love was born in the hearts
For destruction, for what tears apart
For what's bestial, for what's trashy
Generation is divided
Irritation, isolation, nothing more to add
