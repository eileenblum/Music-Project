The brain reels with pain
Immobilized,laying in wait
Entranced by what you feel
Sent forward to uphold hate
Feel to urge exasperation
Do you suffer are you crazy now
Heavy breathing craving hunger
Dispense pain disciple of abhorrence
To feel nothing abstain from any love
To kill all life you live to abhor
To kill end life for spite
Hate fuels your vexation
Growing inside you
Swelling beyond control
Emanate your sickness
To dark takes its toll
Living for nothing more that hate
Your life committed ensures its fate
Miscreant living out your dream
Ending life with all its misery
A force you have created from
The ashes of your mind
Feel it taking over as it grinds your soul
Never escape its anguished blow
Lifelong curse silenced with death
How you long to crush out life
Satisfaction with your every act
