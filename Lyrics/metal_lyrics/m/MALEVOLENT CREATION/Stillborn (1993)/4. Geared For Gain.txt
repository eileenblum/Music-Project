Intrusion,truth twisted,accepting
Degraded,up-ended,Besieged lie
Gratified,careless dying,powertrip
No obstruction,guiltlessness,consious dead
Geared for gain
Hoarding everything you want
Nothing in your way
Squandering everything your soul
Remains empty
Hoarding everything you want
Nothing in your way
Squandering everything your soul
Geared for gain
Breaking souls
Selfishness feeds your head,fills your need
Tormenting,soul-breaking acquired gain
Everything has a price,including life
Passed down,generation explotation
Gain,gain
Breaking lives,breaking souls
Taking pleasure,in acquiring all
Garnish fool,knows no wrong
Amused by suffering,explicated sin
Inside the brain,undisciplined
Drawn to pain,geared for gain
