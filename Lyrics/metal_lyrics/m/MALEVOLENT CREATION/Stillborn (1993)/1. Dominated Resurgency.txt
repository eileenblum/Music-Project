Lust,lust,lust
Lust,lust,lust
No fear of touch
In its sadistic array
Anticipate the stroke
Of equal pain,pain !
Bred to please,single goal achieved
Dominated through life
Ecstatic release,well worth the price
Enslaved birth rite
Limbs twisting out thier passionate embrace
Blood gorging the veins,the veins
Swelling of the flesh,uncontrollable rise
To suffice the urge,of their calling's entice
No fear of pain,only excitement of fear
Drined and raw you scream,continue to endure
Dominated resurgency
No fear of flesh
No fear of domination
Restrained limbs mesh
No fear of pain,only excitement of fear
Drined and raw you scream,continue to endure
Bonded on tile,collared,alive
Next realm achieved,orgasms cry
Dominate,dominating,dominated,dominating
Dominated resurgency
