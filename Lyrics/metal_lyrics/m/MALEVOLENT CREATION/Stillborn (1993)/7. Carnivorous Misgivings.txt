Taste of blood spurns the life
Sent of death drives it on
Live for the hunt,to dominate
Its instinct and desire
Tooth and talon dig at flesh
Snapping tendon and bone
Gorging on the freshly killed
Triumphant stand alone
Carnivorous
Misgivings of a God that is gone
Era shut
Never to rule again
Rule
Live for the hunt dialed in
Predator above the rest
Seeking blood,its only religion
Alive to kill,wickedly blessed
No satisfaction in acquiring prey
Never receives its fill
Born for the purpose to constantly slay
To achieve an infinite kill
Tooth and talon ripping flesh
The snap of tendon and bone
Gorging on the freshly killed
Triumphant stand alone
 Once walked the world a king
Nothing could stand before it
Hostile with purpose
Stalking the warm cruor
Constant hunt taking prey
Never receives its fill
Born with instinct to slay
To achieve endless kills
Power behind imagination
No throne could garnish it
Only to fall into extinction
Natural selection to blame
