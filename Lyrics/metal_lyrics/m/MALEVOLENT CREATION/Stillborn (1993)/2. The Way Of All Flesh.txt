Naive victims fall easy game
No volue of life on earth
Cries for help go unheard
Will there be a rebirth
Rotten corpse satisfies
Immortality
Hunger for black gratified
Abhorent death reality
Expression of art,killing machine
Spreading shock and dread
Sinister cackleof a razor shear
Compose the works of red
Unable to comprehend the stroke
Just strike out in pain
Hunger for black finally quenched
Set out to achieve and gained
Exposing the flesh that can never be
Feel it burn and die
Warped mind,endlessly search within
Senseless slaying buying time
Naive victims fall easy game
No volue of life on earth
Cries for help go unheard
Abort the hope of rebirth
Follow on trail of ruin
Gorging endlessly
Escape the torture of your being
Sanity never restored
It's the way of all flesh
It's the way of all flesh
Soon to join your ancestors
The way it's always been
Never to cheat the creator
Into the earth you've sent
And gained
And gained
