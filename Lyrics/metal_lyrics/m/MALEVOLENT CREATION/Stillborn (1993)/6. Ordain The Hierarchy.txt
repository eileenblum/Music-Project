Disease-ridden inhabitants
Radiate through the rest
Healing mechanism triggered
Genocide of the human pest
Lives extinguished
Disaster encountered
World's repossession
Natural healing process
Annihilate the living scourge
There is no coincidence
Cataclismic result
Final stage commencement
Return to dust
No-more-flesh
The fate instilled
Sealed with death
Ordain the hierarchy
Proper power is reclaimed
A world-evolved mind of its own
Not far from being done
Dug our grave,now we must lie in it
Reach out for reprisal
Cannot grip,can never grasp
Order of man
Now threatened existence
Feeble lives lie shattered
Power will disenchant
