Substantiate the right to hate
Violent shape takes on meaning
Passed down through the ages
Genetic spiral mutates
Growing affliction slices fate
One need,one soul,out of control
Wanders the world in search of hate
Genetic spiral mutates
Violence instilled
Aberated need to kill
No rational reason
To explain your bleeding,bleeding
Bleed
Rise,anxiety grows in me
Alive,emotional pittance of life
Unleash,torn from the womb to bleed
Condemned,wreaking murder floods my sight
Letting of blood,evolved through time
Eventual demise,obsession of the crime
Cantankerous objective
Carnal thoughts guide the mind
Step inside this soul
Blood of others,your only find
Growing epidemic swells
Means of killing forever grow
Life has no meaning or cause
Feeling blood's valve flow
Violence never ceases
Entrapped by tis pull
Normal life is fleeting
Genetical affliction
Caught up in the demon race
To conquer all of life
Anxious sweat falls from the face
Genetical affliction
Neverending
Generations continue to explode
Violence mutating
Afflication overflows
Genetic affliction
