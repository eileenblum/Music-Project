Mindless souls gathered in
Life is taken away
One man ruler of their world
Live in agony
Grabbing wealth,hypocrite
The wandering get a home
Taste of anguish of the loss
Well cleansed brain,easier to mold
Locked youself inside of a dream
Mental pain venomous verse
Pawn instilled into a game
Faith will follow in traverse
Live the lies
Domination of terror
One man's hell
Union of your despair
Stocpiling arms for the end
Amassing food accumulation
Fortifying the shield of God
Silent wait for armageddon
Twisted minds forms this race
Into his shell,you've gathered in
Brain left to rot,gray matter waste
Aquired to complete his sin
Domination of terror
Mindless souls gathered in
Life is taken away
One man ruler of thier world
Exist in agony
Plays on emotions of guilt
Sucked into suffer
Church of your God always filled
Wealth is well ensured
