[Music:Phil Fasciana / Lyrics:Brett Hoffman]

Pile up the masses
Ready to make our strike
Try to play us
Raise up itâs now our time

Put down to long
As we lay in wait
Gather the many
Onward now we slay

Maybe now theyâll notice
This is for real
Minions will assemble
Sound starts to tremble
Strength in numbers
[x2]

Pile up the masses
Ready to make our strike
Try to play us
Raise up itâs now our time

Put down to long
As we lay in wait
Gather the many
Onward now we slay
Rise

Waiting for our call
As one standing tall
Our strength in numbers
Will rise
[x4]

Rise!

Waiting for our call
As one standing tall
Our strength in numbers
Will rise
[x2]
