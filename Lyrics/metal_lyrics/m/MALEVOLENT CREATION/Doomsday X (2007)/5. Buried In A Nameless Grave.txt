[Music and Lyrics: J. Black]

Mind distraught, conquered thought
Canât believe that this is real
No one cares, no one hears
Incomplete, I am dead

Rotting flesh, maggots infest
Decayed in my darkened hall
Name unknown, darkness flows
Life declined, death my home

Blood decreased, insects feast
Trapped inside this nameless tomb
Prayerless slave, cannot be saved
No religion for this grave

Silently
Death is real, cannot feel
Horrified, mortify, canât accept this fate
Unmarked frame, judgment day
Buried in a nameless grave

[All x2]
