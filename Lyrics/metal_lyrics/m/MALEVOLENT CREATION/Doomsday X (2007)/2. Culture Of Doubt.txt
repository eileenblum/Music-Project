[Music:Phil Fasciana / Lyrics:Brett Hoffman]

Everything and everyone
Is all wasted shit
So much useless sacrifice
For a cause that is unfit

Everything you are not
Just another sniveling snot
Culture of doubt
Afraid to take it on

Everything you are not
Idle stance or take your shot
Culture of doubt
Bring the system down

Everything and everyone
Is all wasted shit
Take it hard in the ass
Or rise up contrast

Everything you are not
Just another sniveling snot
Culture of doubt
Bring the system down

Failing lies
Trapped by disguise
Wake up and see
You are never free

Failing lies
Trapped by disguise
Wake up and see
You are neverâ¦ FREEEE!!!

Always they play us
Why do we give in
Why donât we stand up
Maybe finally win

I cannot fail
Except this I will not
No one will tell me
My mind is not free
