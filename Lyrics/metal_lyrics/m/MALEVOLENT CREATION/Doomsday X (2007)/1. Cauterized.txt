[Music:Phil Fasciana / Lyrics:Brett Hoffman]

All shuffled in
Cattle to fucking kill
Your so called crime
Cells they must fill

Human now gone
All trapped in stone
Living is done
You die alone

Blood flows through the cracks
From walls of the damned
Whatâs left of you now
Without fail it will fall
In this sense it is hell
Living trivialized
Thatâs why live is cauterized
[x2]

No one left to burn
Earth plundered from above
Man creates his own end
Life as you know it is done

No free thinking will
No expressive thought
That is what they want

Behind iron doors
Mind is ripped apart
Unjust crucifixion

Keeping all mouths shut
Must destroy unrest
Punishment so unjust

Ignorance is alive
In the cell where you thrive
Life is cauterized

Blood flows through the cracks
From walls of the damned
Whatâs left of you now
Without fail it will fall
In this sense it is hell
Living trivialized
Thatâs why live is cauterized
[x2]

No one left to burn
Earth plundered from above
Man creates his own end
Life as you know it is done

No free thinking will
No expressive thought
That is what they want

Behind iron doors
Mind is ripped apart
Unjust crucifixion

Keeping all mouths shut
Must destroy unrest
Punishment so unjust

Ignorance is alive
In the cell where you thrive
Life is cauterized
