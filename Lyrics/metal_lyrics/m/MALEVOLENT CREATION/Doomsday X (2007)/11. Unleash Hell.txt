[Music: Jon Rubin / Lyrics: Brett Hoffman]

Unleash hell
Pray you are not against us

I unleash hell
Upon the non believers
Prophecy swiftly dealt
Conquer all deceivers

No we shall never fall
This you cannot divide
To ranks we all are called
Deliver the last strike

Unleash hell
Pray you are not against us

Swift death to non believers
We conquer all deceivers
[x2]

One by one they will fall
Weak mined that they are
Omen is now installed
Doomed end soon to start
Now time for all to know
Venting of this power
Through our veins it flows
Into the final hour
[x2]

Unleash hell
Pray you are not against us

Swift death to non believers
We conquer all deceivers
[x2]
