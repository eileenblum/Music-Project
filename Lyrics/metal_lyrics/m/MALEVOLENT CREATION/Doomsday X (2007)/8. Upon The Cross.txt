[Music:Phil Fasciana / Lyrics:Brett Hoffman]

Self thinking dies
Wasted sacrifice
Doomed existence bled
Soulless one is met

Set up, fall in the end
Losing, cannot win
Put down, by them all
Living, only to fall
[x2]

Creating for them to live
Taking, they never give
Bleed you until youâre dry
Greed they donât even hide

Set up, fall in the end
Losing, cannot win
Put down, by them all
Living, only to fall
[x2]

Bearing crosses
Abandoned and lost
[x4]

Set up, fall in the end
Losing, cannot win
