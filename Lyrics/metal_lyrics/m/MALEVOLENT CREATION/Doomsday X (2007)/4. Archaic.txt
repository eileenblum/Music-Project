[Music and Lyrics: J. Black]

Primitive ways, critical stage
Evolving from dark ancient days
Domination, manifestation
Still strong and conquering
Endless changes, nameless faces
Conscious only to those who remain
Time shall heal, take the pain
Taking back what we began

Taking back what we began
Claim our reign of the throne
Supremacy now back in hand
Resurrect the dead

Heretic, archaic, governed death, genocide
[x4]

Deliverance, consequence
Systematic ignorance
My blood now stained, by dues Iâve paid
Punished for the sins Iâve made
Fatal turn, all shall burn
Perish under my return
Killing machine, now redeemed
Welcome to insanity

Taking back what we began
Claim our reign of the throne
Supremacy now back in hand
Resurrect the dead

Heretic, archaic, governed death, genocide
[x2]
