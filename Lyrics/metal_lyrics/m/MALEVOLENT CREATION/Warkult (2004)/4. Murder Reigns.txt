Hunting, the quest for the kill
Taking ones life the ultimate thrill
Voracious, desire so grand
Carnage and victory go hand in hand
Fatality's increasing, countless numbers slain
Survival, afflictions and personal gain
Hostile, malicious onslaught
Compelled to slay, until death or till caught
History will always repeat
Ordained to vanquish will never complete
Fatality's increasing, countless numbers slain
Throughout our history murder has reigned

Victims at hand
Victims at hand
Laid to rest
Instinct to kill
Who is next?

Hunting, the quest for the kill
Taking ones life the ultimate thrill
Voracious, desire so grand
Carnage and victory go hand in hand
Fatality's increasing, countless numbers slain

Survival, afflictions and personal gain
Hostile, malicious onslaught
Compelled to slay, until death or till caught
History will always repeat
Killing and killing until no one is seen
Fatality's increasing, countless numbers slain
Throughout our history murder has reigned
