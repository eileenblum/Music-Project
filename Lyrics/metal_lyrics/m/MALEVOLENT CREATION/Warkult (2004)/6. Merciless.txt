Barbaric and savage, in their own ways
Showing no mercy they will not refrain
A passion for violence never before seen
Longing for bloodshed the highest degree

Committed to kill
The merciless
Chosen prey
Life denied
Severely tortured
Before they die

Barbaric and savage, in their own ways
Showing no mercy they will not refrain
A passion for violence never before seen
Longing for bloodshed the highest degree

Torment before they're slain
Ignoring hallowed cries
Inflicting horrid pain
Body count starts to rise
Cruelty guides their means
Methods rancorous
Unmatched killing spree
Beyond malevolence

Committed to kill
The merciless

Barbaric and savage, in their own ways
Showing no mercy they will not refrain
A passion for violence never before seen
Longing for bloodshed the highest degree
