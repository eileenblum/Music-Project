Devastation now soon to be
Abrogation the final decision
Plans of hostility, strategies, with the utmost precision
Decapitation strike, eradication of those in command
Until you all concede, blood will spill across the land

All out attack the objective now in sight
Surrender or become statistic of this depredation
Warheads, released, begging for their lives
Munitions destroyed, no chances for retaliation
Total control, their empire laid to waste
Onward to conquer, supremacy through annihilation

Swift and fierce
Falling from the skies
Bombs are constantly dropping
Abolishing those who will have survived

All out attack the objective now in our sight
Surrender or become statistic of this depredation
Warheads, released, begging for their lives
Munitions destroyed, no chances for retaliation
Total control, their empire laid to waste
Onward to conquer, supremacy through annihilation
Total control, our mission now achieved
Onward to conquer, supremacy through annihilation
