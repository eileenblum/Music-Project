Strike!

Suspicions... of their intentions are raised
The choices now became clear
Deterrence... their plans will never evolve
An onslaught many will soon fear... for years
Offensive... vicious assaults will befall
To those that do not agree
Triumphant... united we will prevail
Until the goal is achieved... their defeat

Contended... the methods that are applied
Considered partial to gain
Intentions... some say are fueled by hunger
No one can ever explain... or restrain
Apprehension... the target rapidly seized
Forced upon by vicious intent
Abounding... weapons of warfare are used
The many lives that are spent... no regrets

Strike first, strike fast, abolish their threat
Shackled by loss, pursue their downfall
Artillery annulled, no chance to requite
Subversion complete, winner takes all

Strike first, strike fast, abolish their threat
Shackled by loss, pursue their downfall
Artillery annulled, no chance to requite
Subversion complete, winner takes all
