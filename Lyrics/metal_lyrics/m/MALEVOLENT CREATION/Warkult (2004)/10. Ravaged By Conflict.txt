Smoldering ashes remain
Targets have been attacked
Regions left in ruin
With anger they react
Look upon all the fallen lives
This tragedy unclear
Mass graves fill the ground
Eradication feared

Conflict has now ravaged their land
Conquered by powers the enemy commands
Rising from ruin, to far out of grasp

Smoldering ashes remain
Targets have been attacked
Regions left in ruin
With anger they react
Look upon all the fallen lives
This tragedy unclear
Mass graves fill the ground
Eradication feared

Defeat, sealed by fury
Rampant, famine and disease
Oppressed, hope is crumbling
Survive or become obsolete

Conflict has now ravaged their land
Conquered by powers the enemy commands
Rising from ruin, to far out of grasp

Defeat, sealed by fury
Rampant, famine and disease
Oppressed, new leaders in control
Survive or become obsolete

Conflict has now ravaged their land
Conquered by powers the enemy controls
Rising from ruin, to far out of grasp
