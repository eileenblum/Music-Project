Subdued by madness reality severe
Pervading my mind, and my actions for years
Flashbacks of combat, now hinder the skills
Once possessed to gain victory through kills

Symptoms increase
Reliving fear, visions will not cease
Conflicts arise
Once on the field, now inside my mind

Lucid no more
Haunted by actions for life I endure
The past invades
Searing within, my soul is now decayed

Deemed unfit to serve and obey
Restraining dementia, through war I obtained
Shell of a man, I have become
Tolls of warfare, sanity has done
Now in sickness my life declines
Lunacy ruling... now ruling my life

Subdued by madness reality severe
Pervading my mind, and my actions for years
Flashbacks of combat, hinder the skills
Once possessed to gain victory through kills

Symptoms increase
Reliving fear, visions will not cease
Conflicts arise
Once on the field, now within my mind

Lucid no more
Haunted by actions for life I endure
The past invades
Searing within, my soul is now decayed

Symptoms increase
Reliving fear, visions will not cease
Conflicts arise
Once on the field, now within my mind
