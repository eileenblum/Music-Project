Another day of blood, night is full of screams and death
Victims come in many forms, still all gasp a final breath
Madman takes his aim, exhales soft barrels crack loud
So many more targets to kill, to him it's not just a crowd

Sickness in his mind, rid the world of scourge
Killing one by one, lead spitter continues to forge

No one left alive, cruel cleansing proceeds
His mind it will not rest, fulfillment of these deeds
Hatred grows inside, how many more will die
By the thousands rounds explode, by the thousands bodies fall

Sickness in his mind, rid the world of scourge
Killing one by one, lead spitter continues to forge

Squeeze the trigger, watch them fall, crosshairs trained on heads
Single purpose, born to kill, ultimate death is bred
Trained from birth, it's what is learned, eliminate all life
Don't hesitate, lock and load, always first to fight

Spitting lead
Spitting lead

Squeeze the trigger, watch them fall, crosshairs trained on heads
Single purpose, born to kill, ultimate death is bred
Trained from birth, it's what is learned, eliminate all life
Don't hesitate, lock and load, always first to fight

Spitting lead
Spitting lead

Sickness in his mind, rid the world of scourge
Killing one by one, lead spitter continues to forge
