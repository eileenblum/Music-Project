Desire turns to hate when bodies meet and twist
Leather touches skin, biting your own lip
Fucked against your will, strapped and confined
No use to protest, temperature does rise
Skin hot to the touch, never get enough

Stuffed full, entering every hole
Look of lust in your eyes
Anticipate, you will never know
Whimpering cries

Spread out and displayed, redness now appears
Grinding your flesh, the pain it sears
Wrists throb with pain, chains hold you back
Cannot escape, restraints hold fast

Stuffed full, entering every hole
Look of lust in your eyes
Anticipate, you will never know
Whimpering cries

Eyes wide with fear, deviant violence
Fear turns to pain, spread out displayed

Whipping the flesh, lashing through skin
Cold touch latex, all the way in
The penetration, throbbing and wet
Exhausted hard, but not done yet
You can't explain your love for this pain

Stuffed full, entering every hole
Look of lust in your eyes
Anticipate, you will never know
Whimpering cries
