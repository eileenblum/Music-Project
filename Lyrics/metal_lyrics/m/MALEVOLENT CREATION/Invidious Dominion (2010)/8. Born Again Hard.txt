Taking shit far too long, stomped and trodden down
Sitting back watching this, true calling now found
Slapping me across the face, hate now takes a stand
Spitting on my broken life, now I say no more

Born again hard, born again hard
Born again hard, born again hard
Born again hard

Knife or gun, target in, killing everyone
In my way, hack and slay, bloody deed is done
Crushing lives, dispensing death, destroying all souls
Taking on everything, swallowing it whole

Born again hard, born again hard
Born again hard, born again hard

Tasting hate, piling up
Ticking clock time bomb goes off
Knuckles white, gripped in fear
Death comes tonight, I stride near

Tasting hate, piling up
Ticking clock time bomb goes off

Standing up, snapping necks, now you can't ignore
Make my stand, mind has snapped, born again hard
