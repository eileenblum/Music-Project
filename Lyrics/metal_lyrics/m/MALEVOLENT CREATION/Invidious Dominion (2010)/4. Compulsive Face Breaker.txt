See your face, chin you hard
Drive my fist, lips will part
Face bones smash, pummeled down
Stomp your ass into the ground

Shut up fast, blackened eyes
In the dirt, whimpered cries
Try to stand, knocked back down
Break your arm, splintered sound

Gurgled blood in your throat
In the ribs, body folds
Get back up, piece of shit
Again your face I want to hit

Swollen face, swollen lips
See it coming, start to piss
Feeling blows raining hard
Bone now shows, just the start

See your face, chin you hard
Drive my fist, lips will part
Face bones smash, pummeled down
Stomp your ass into the ground

Shut up fast, blackened eyes
In the dirt, whimpered cries
Try to stand, knocked back down
Break your arm, splintered sound

Gurgled blood in your throat
In the ribs, body folds
Get back up, piece of shit
Again your face I want to hit

Swollen face, swollen lips
See it coming, start to piss
Feeling blows raining hard
Bone now shows, just the start

I will crush your world
Instinct pushes onward
Impulsive violence
Compulsive face breaker

See your face, chin you hard
Drive my fist, lips will part
Face bones smash, pummeled down
Stomp your ass into the ground

Shut up fast, blackened eyes
In the dirt, whimpered cries
Try to stand, knocked back down
Break your arm, splintered sound

Gurgled blood in your throat
In the ribs, body folds
Get back up, piece of shit
Again your face I want to hit

Swollen face, swollen lips
See it coming, start to piss
Feeling blows raining hard
Bone now shows, just the start
