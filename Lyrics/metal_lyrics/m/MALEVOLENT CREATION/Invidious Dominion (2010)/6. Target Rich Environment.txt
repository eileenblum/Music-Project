Wide open bullets fly, victims strewn upon the scape
No need to justify, bite the lead accept your fate
Trying to survive, in a world that's scared
You are next in line, head lined up in crosshairs

Target rich environment
Strikes the mark, feel death's intent
Target rich environment
Strikes the mark, feel death's intent

Order of the day, kill the impending mark
Neverending slay, never can you drop your guard
Bodies pile up, living death, desensitized
Man is beaten down, world should be euthanized

Target rich environment
Strikes the mark, feel death's intent
Target rich environment
Strikes the mark, feel death's intent

Crushing foes, stomp you down, bloody boot
Cap your head, face is cold and turning blue
Tear your ass, ripped apart and broken down
Snap a neck, head removed, you make no sound

Raise the body count, it will never end
War, it will rage on, target rich environment

Death is vilified, disappear without a trace
World is torn apart, killer that has no face
Can never go back, society can't escape
Who is next in line, always to eliminate

Target rich environment
Strikes the mark, feel death's intent
Target rich environment
Strikes the mark, feel death's intent
