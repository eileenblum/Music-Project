Born into a world of hate, target on your back
Only free to up and die, falling through the cracks
World coming into its own, greed and sloth dominate
Following the stricken pack, into fear and hate
Mind is blown and ripped apart, cannot comprehend
Ending well before it starts, might as well be dead

Tasting fear and crying, dealt this blow and dying
Fall apart and crumble, underlying rumble
All life will extinguish, living is now finished
Invidious feeling, hate continues breeding

World coming into its own, greed and sloth dominate
Following the stricken pack, into fear and hate
Mind is blown and ripped apart, cannot comprehend
Ending well before it starts, might as well be dead

Tasting fear and crying, dealt this blow and dying
Fall apart and crumble, underlying rumble
All life will extinguish, living is now finished
Invidious feeling, hate continues breeding

Now you are sent reeling, callous never feeling
Killing is your calling, souls continue falling
Emptiness surrounding, blackness you are drowning
World is crushed in despair, you die and I don't care

Born into a world of hate, target on your back
Only free to up and die, falling through the cracks
Existence just another way of living hell on earth
Killing bred into the genes, peace is a still birth

Into hate
