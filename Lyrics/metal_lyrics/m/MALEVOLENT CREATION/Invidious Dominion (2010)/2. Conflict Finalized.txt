Into the breach, all out attack
Enemies, mounting forces stack
Barrels blaze, troops will stand or fall
Fire rains, forces meet and brawl
First to move, surrender we will not
Fronts amass, we will never stop

Line of fire, bodies dropping
Only one wins, all you can be
Blasting through lines, battling foes
Locked in combat, into death throws

Into the breach, all out attack
Enemies, mounting forces stack
Barrels blaze, troops will stand or fall
Fire rains, forces meet and brawl
First to move, surrender we will not
Fronts amass, we will never stop

Line of fire, bodies dropping
Only one wins, all you can be
Blasting through lines, battling foes
Locked in combat, into death throws

Filling ranks, body bags, battlefields we die
War unfolds, cruel and cold, enemy is mine
White hot lead, tearing flesh, lining up my sights
Battle lines, barrels primed, receiving your last rites

Line of fire, bodies dropping
Only one wins, all you can be
Blasting through lines, battling foes
Locked in combat, into death throws
