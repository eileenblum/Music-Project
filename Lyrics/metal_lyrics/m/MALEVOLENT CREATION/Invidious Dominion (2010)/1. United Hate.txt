Greed is what drives us on, death to all those that oppose
Fear must feel power grow, united hate
Done what is in our path, blind to the violence
Pick at the aftermath, united hate

Live, take down everyone, kill the unrighteous ones
Feel what will be undone, united hate
Join and become one, die if you are alone
Fail is not an option, united hate

Hungry, hating, wanting, killing, dying, taking

Greed is what drives us on, death to all those that oppose
Fear must feel power grow, united hate
Done what is in our path, blind to the violence
Pick at the aftermath, united hate

Live, take down everyone, kill the unrighteous ones
Feel what will be undone, united hate
Join and become one, die if you are alone
Fail is not an option, united hate

Hungry, hating, wanting, killing, dying, taking
Hungry, hating, wanting, killing, dying, taking

Never saw it coming, blindsided by rage
Torn apart in anger, unleash now the final stage

Jacked, power trip you're on, taking on everyone
War you will come undone, united hate
Hell is what now will flow, fire rages in these souls
Dark reaches out and grows, united hate
