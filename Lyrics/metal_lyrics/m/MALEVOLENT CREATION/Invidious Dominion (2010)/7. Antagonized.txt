Shoveling your shit down my throat
Piling high, making me choke
Spending your life to ruin mine
All you want is to watch me die

Losing this game, losing my mind
Taking the blame, antagonized

I just want to crush your fucking head
Veins start to pop and flow
Can't stop the rage, it grows

Losing this game, losing my mind
Taking the blame, antagonized

Hot rage, it swells, infects, disturbs
Rage can't be quelled, so deep it burns
Why won't it stop, making no sense
When will it end, call on violence

Antagonized, antagonized, antagonized
Antagonized, antagonized, antagonized

Hot rage, it swells, infects, disturbs
Rage can't be quelled, so deep it burns
Why won't it stop, making no sense
When will it end, call on violence

Antagonized, antagonized, antagonized
Antagonized, antagonized, antagonized

I just want to crush your fucking head
Veins start to pop and flow
Can't stop the rage, it grows

Losing this game, losing my mind
Taking the blame, antagonized
