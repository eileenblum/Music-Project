No more inferiority will ruin this, our lives.
To step outside the boundaries of just the will to survive.
Come inside, feel your life,
slip from your grasp, to your religion you clasp.
A fear that is new, pours into you,
tearing your soul, release the unknown.
Dethroning the old, crowning the young,
rightful heir, the time has come.
Religion has died.
All shall melt under one sign.
Relinquish your life.
A new lease of power has been sent forth.
The weak can only cry.
Lost amongst the dust of a crumbling world.
Last breath fails, time to move on, evolution calls.
Worlds collide, the weak step aside.
Our callings heard, no mercy will come.
The path is cleared, paid for with your blood.
This time has been anticipated, since the dawn of man.
Hatred silently brewing, awaiting it's final stand.
Our rule, our... RULE!
The advantage is ours,
gathering the powers of the past.
Tensed forth to aggress,
deal a strike with precision crass.
Worlds collide, the weak step aside.
Our callings heard, no mercy will come.
The path is cleared, paid for with your blood.
Now that the time has dawned upon us,
allocate your inner soul.
Seize now, this opportunity.
Retribute your malevolence handed down.
