Fire rains from the sky
No escape, countless die
Hell unleashed, clueless mass
So many lost repeat the past
Battles fought on earth and screen
Bodies drop as fast as minds
Syndicate cleanse extreme
Flaunting their financial crimes

Global warfare
Worldwide genocide
Corporate weaponry
Bodies stacked into the sky

Rule the world with stolen wealth
Take it all by force
Dominate through bottom line
Exploitation of the poor
Engine stoked with full on greed
Funding fills the war machine
Bullets, guns and death extreme
Stroke of the key, it's all unleashed.

Global warfare

Bodies stacked into the sky

Empires fall
New realm now arrives
Powers that be
Grow fat on lies
Shattered can't oppose
To poor and beaten down
Ripe world for picking
Corporate weaponry

Fire rains from the sky
No escape, countless die
Hell unleashed clueless mass
So many lost repeat the past

Funding fills the war machine
Bullets, guns and death extreme
