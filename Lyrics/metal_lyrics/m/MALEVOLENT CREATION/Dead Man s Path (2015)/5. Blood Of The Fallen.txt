Let loose the dogs of war
Marching out across the land
Feet fall on the cruor sand
Over run and beaten down
Line is broke they lose the ground
Sweat and blood upon your skin
Blood may be your own
No mercy now can you afford
Bloodlust thirst is all you show

Blood of the fallen
Sacrifice for honor
Blood of the fallen
Let loose the dogs of war
Blood of the fallen
Sacrifice for honor
Blood of the fallen
Let loose the dogs of war

Steel separating flesh
Flash of the blade cuts through the sky
The bodies wilt before you
From the sword you wield high
Push on through the human sea
Chop and hack, dare not stop
Stench of dying fills your nose
Enemy begs to their god

Blood of the fallen
Sacrifice for honor
Blood of the fallen
Let loose the dogs of war
Blood of the fallen
Sacrifice for honor
Blood of the fallen
Let loose the dogs of war

Blood of the fallen
No honor for the broken lives
Ghost of torture calling
Sacrifice by design
Blood of the fallen
No honor for the broken lives
Ghost of torture calling
Sacrifice by design
Blood of the fallen
No honor for the broken lives
Ghost of torture calling
Sacrifice by design

Release

Sacrifice for honor
Enemy shall know this fear
Battles rage to kill all
Wars will end, heroes fall
Now return to dust
Quell the inner rage
Until a time itÂ´s called upon
When once again they must be slain

Blood of the fallen
Sacrifice for honor
Blood of the fallen
Let loose the dogs of war
Blood of the fallen
Sacrifice for honor
Blood of the fallen
Let loose the dogs of war
