The enemy now silent
Strewn across the ground
Corpses crushed and broken
Dread the only sound
They came at us with confidence
Weapons firing hot
Eyes ablaze with hatred
Lighting up the dawn
Light it up

Anger built for centuries
Violence boiling over
Faces twist in bloodlust rage
Infuriated to the core
Missiles at the ready
Targets not to find
Staring at the killing screen
Teeth they gnash and grind

Rounds rip through flesh
Crimson clouds blot the sky
Gasping for breath
Death and blood on the bayonet shines

Cities lie in ruins
Final ticks of the clock
Upon the rubble, masses piled
Far past awe and shock

Awe and shock

Anger built for centuries
Violence boiling over
Faces twist in bloodlust rage
Infuriated to the core
Missiles at the ready
Targets not to find
Staring at the killing screen
Teeth they gnash and grind

Rounds rip through flesh
Crimson clouds blot the sky
Gasping for breath
Death and blood on the bayonet shines

Blood fills the streets
The screams and cries
Fall of an empire
New one arise

Blood fills the streets
The screams and cries
Fall of an empire
New one arise
Come into power
Millions have died
Fall of an empire
New one arise
Blood fills the streets
The screams and cries
Fall of an empire
New one arise

Arise

Anger built for centuries
Violence boiling over
Faces twist in bloodlust rage
Infuriated to the core
Missiles at the ready
Targets not to find
Staring at the killing screen
Teeth they gnash and grind

Kill force rising
