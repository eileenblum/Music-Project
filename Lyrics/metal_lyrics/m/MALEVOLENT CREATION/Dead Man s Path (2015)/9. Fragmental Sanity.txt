Sparks of pain rip through my brain
Everything is wrong
Blind it stays, no light obtained
Normalcy is gone
Eyes they burn, chaos insured
Fingers pull at flesh
Skull it throbs, hands they shake
Distress is so intense

Wires from my skin
Dangle from above
Pull and jerk, my body hurts
All control is lost
What happened to my mind
Nothing falls in line
My own thoughts are crushing me
To the point of lunacy

Light intense, mind can't vent
Soon I will blackout
On the ground, dementia found
Unconscious and insane

Fragmental sanity, downfall of perception
Losing sane abilities, everything is pain

Stretched out on this slab
Limbs are bound, cut deep it burns
Then pump in all the drugs
Shell of a man I have become

Fragmental sanity, downfall of perception
Losing sane abilities, everything is pain

Light intense, mind can't vent
Soon I will blackout
On the ground, dementia found
Unconscious and insane

Fragmental sanity
Fragmental sanity
