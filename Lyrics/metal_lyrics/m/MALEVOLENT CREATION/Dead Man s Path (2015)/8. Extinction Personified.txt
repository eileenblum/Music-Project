Darkness wells
Engulfs all mankind
What is this hell
Proceed to die

Presentiment before you
Appraisal is at hand
Dawn breaks upon your halt
Cessation now expand

Weep for death of man
Weep for end of man

Earth spitting fire
Rise from the depths
Global consuming
Infernal deaths

Presentiment before you
Appraisal is at hand
Dawn breaks upon your halt
Cessation now expand

Weep for death of man
Weep for end of man

Disease running rampant
Bodies die and drop
Foam is spewing from the mouth
The killing just won't stop

Frailty is your downfall
Systems overload
Immunity it vanishes
Systems now corrode

Ending is coming
Extinction on high
Humans are dropping
No more will you find
World had enough
Sheds us like fleas
With fire and bloodshed
And sickening disease
Balance has shifted
The power has changed
Bones turn to splinters
The blood is all drained
Accepting your fate
Is all you have left
The final embrace
Is your suffering death

Cities lie wasted, once glorious sights
Now crumbled and reduced to stones
The power is lost, and so are the souls
All tortured and pulled down below

Ending is coming
Extinction on high
Humans are dropping
No more will you find
World had enough
Sheds us like fleas
With fire and bloodshed
And sickening disease
Balance has shifted
The power has changed
Bones turn to splinters
The blood is all drained
Accepting your fate
Is all you have left
The final embrace
Is your suffering death

Now forgone conclusion
Your blood has turned on you
Gasping, grasping
Rule of man is through
Now forgone conclusion
Your blood has turned on you
Scalding, burning
Rule of man is through
