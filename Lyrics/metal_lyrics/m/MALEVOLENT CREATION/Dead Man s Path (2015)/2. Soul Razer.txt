Rotting flesh stripped away, tearing at your core
Entity feeds on life, deficient of remorse

Population growing, harvesting on high
Ignorance keeps you down, effortless without a fight

Consuming of souls, engross your desolation
Consuming of souls, inner dissipation

Shadows racing forward, reaping in your vision
Cold fingers deep in side, frozen black incision

Population growing, harvesting on high
Ignorance keeps you down, effortless without a fight

Consuming of souls, engross your desolation
Consuming of souls, inner dissipation

Blinded reality, hollowed husk
Unresponsive, soul sucked and crushed

Falling fast from the light
Debilitated reasoning
Contaminate sound and though
Blackened hole is deepening

Blinded reality, hollowed husk

Falling fast from the light
Debilitated reasoning
Contaminate sound and though

Soulrazer, soulrazer
No one will prevail, draw your last breath
Rise or you fail, you, cannot keep it away, death

Rotting flesh stripped away, tearing at your core
Entity feeds on life, deficient of remorse

Population growing, harvesting on high
Ignorance keeps you down, effortless without a fight

Soulrazer, soulrazer
