Black stares, faces of the masses
Inner numbness growing, all are void of feeling
Live in separation, fronts quickly fleeting
Losing of this battle, of our humanity
Crowds of disconnected weakness
Failure to fight back, when you are so passive
Live to keep you down, deep inside this dark hole
Existence of the lies, forever stunting growth,
Of your, potential

Worlds end is in consummation
Corruptors grip is all ensuing
Species final degradation
Overlords incensed pursuing

Black stares, faces of the masses
Inner numbness growing, all are void of feeling
Live in separation, fronts quickly fleeting
Losing of this battle, of our humanity

Inclusion of entire race
Straight to confrontation
Dying soon to feed craze
Worlds end is in consummation
Corruptors grip is all ensuing
Species final degradation
Overlords incensed pursuing

Get up off you fucking knees,
Fight this worthless sloth regime
Sick of shit stuffed down your throat,
Sick of being bought and owned

Now it's time!

Picked apart like dying prey, always on defense
They hunt down those that oppose,
Why not bring the hunt to them

Resistance is victory
Resistance is victory
Resistance is victory
Hunt down those that oppose,
Picked apart like dying prey
Now we bring the hunt to them, resistance is victory
