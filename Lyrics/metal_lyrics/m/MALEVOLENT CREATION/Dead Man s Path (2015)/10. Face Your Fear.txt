I come for you
Hands upon your skin
Chilling your bones
Gripping your soul

Face your fear, face your fear
Face your fear, face your fear

Feel death come for you
Nocturnal silence
Adrenaline wracked in no way
Limbs locked in pain
Future annihilated
Target for you
Stripped flesh from your face
My own expression craze

Fingers clenched in rigored grip
Will to live it quickly fades
Broken body, soul now slips
Consciousness falls away

Feel death come for you
Nocturnal silence
Adrenaline wracked in no way
Limbs locked in pain
Triumph of pain
Feat on your inner shame
Jaw clench, locked down tight
How the soul strains
Scent of your fear
Filling my nose
Look in your widened eyes
Sheer panicked terror flows

Fingers clenched in rigored grip
Will to live it quickly fades
Broken body soul now slips
Consciousness falls away

Face your fear
