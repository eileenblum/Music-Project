Out of the shadows
Dark souls shuffle by
Fate casts its pain on you
Drawing near, the time to die
Try to cry, the tears never come
The only sound, your own tortured heart
Witness your blood as it spills
Your life is pulled apart

Desolation grabs your mind
Darkness fills your soul
Freefall, spiral down
Trapped in eternal hell

Try to cry, the tears never come
The only sound your own tortured heart
Witness your blood as it spills
Your life is pulled apart

Where is the light
Into oblivion
