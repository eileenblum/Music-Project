Air superiority
Key to victory
Intense attack no one lives
Bury none burned alive
Charge is on no turning back
Kill or die is the only plan
Push ahead not to stem
Kill zone
Gun is drawn rounds explode
Tearing flesh blood it flows
Shrapnel flying searing flesh
Count the kills are they fresh
Claymores pop droping limbs
Notify next of kin
Pushing on take the ground
Carpet bomb unatural pound
Blood soaked clothing
It ain't mine
Barrels are smoking
Clouding my mind
Orders dropping from the top
Annihilate at all cost
Stack up kills fighting on
Achieving outcome we have won
Driving back the enemy
Bodies drop for all to see
Shells exploding on their homes,
Screaming out kill/fuck 'em all
Kill zone, kill zone
