Darkening the senses
Hate pounding on
All emotions conquered
No heart to be found
Nerves fill with fire
Open eyes dialate
Burning deep inside
Weakened bodies fulminate
The forward march
Is crushing life
Firepower
Lights up the night
Rip through the flesh
Searing within
Militant trek
Death only wins
Enemies must die
The only law
To push the line
This is the law
To take life
To crush life
To rule life
