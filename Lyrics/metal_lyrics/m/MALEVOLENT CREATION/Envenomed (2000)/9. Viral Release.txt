Hostility released into
Unsuspecting masses
Radical gestation period
It's time approaching faster
When the process is unleashed
All the world shall be done
Draw in your last breath
Pump the last of your blood
Psychotic creation
Bred on hate
No stopping is involved
It's genetic fate
Organisms collide
Split and divide
Flesh slowing melts
Infecting on virus cells
Crushing of the spirit
Depression now unfolds
Body breaking down
Cure is unknown
No one civilian
Is above its grasp
Locked into disease
One and all are trapped
It's feeding on your weakness
Process takes its toll
Twisted internal pain
Pathogens freely flow
Bacterium infested
Putrificated rot
Antibiotics useless
Feeble pill and shot
Bodies litter the landscape
Is it what it seems
Organs are internally raped
Could it be conspiracy
Cataclysmic extent
Impending virulence
