Fill this world with terror
All offensive conquest
All the shock and horror
Put the world to test
Godless demons raise
Their wings full with rage
Congregation battleclad
Prepared for the siege
Godfeared downfall
The deviants march
Resist
Violent increase
Eradicate
Those who oppose
Destroying now
All in its path
Incinerate
Souls to the last
