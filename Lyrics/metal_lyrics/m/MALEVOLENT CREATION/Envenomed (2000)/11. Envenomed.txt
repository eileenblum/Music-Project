Now envenomed
Tearing at your flesh
The rage instilled
Hate soon to mesh
Deaf to the weak
Dumb cannot speak
Raucous soundwaves
Intrude and invade
It's what you feel
Deep down inside
There is no light
No way to hide
Innoculate with a twisting of pain
Injected not by a physical forge
Rage of venom driving insane
Raging sound corrupts more and more
Darkening the senses
Hate pounding on
Emotions all are conquered
No heart to be found
Abdicate your mortal ground
Erosion of the mind
Fall upon deafened ears
Hate the poisoned crime
Taste the burning skin
Hatred is induced
Some minds fall and crinkle
Some alive they are fused
Now envenomed
Tearing at your flesh
The rage instilled
Hate soon to mesh
