I am released
So the game begins again
I am released
I am more than just a friend
I am released
Your image burned in my brain
I am released
Now you , too, will feel my pain
I'm coming, for my lust
I'm closing, smell your blood
I'm coming, just want to touch
I'm closing, don't even try to run
Once you escaped my advances
This time I will not be stopped
Your image makes me frantic
This time I will not be caught
I know you feel me
When I'm lurking
Around corners
I can't contain
The lust just seathes out
I try to reach out
From the darkness of shadows
I can't forget
And now pursuit revised
I am released
The tears stream down your face
Pursuit revised
Time for you
To accept your fate
