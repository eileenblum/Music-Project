Those who wield power
Are not aware of limitations
Advanced guard
Ascending so begins
The night of the long knives
Death list is now achieved
Four die every fifteen
Bodies carted one by one
Corpses cremated deep is done
Sign of life
One in the neck
Reign of terror
Beneficial effects
Check off names
Many dispatched
Brutal force
His chosen path
Mad mans army
Sent to appease
Public private
Atrocities
Guns at the head
Fear is well fed
Intimidation
Is better than death
