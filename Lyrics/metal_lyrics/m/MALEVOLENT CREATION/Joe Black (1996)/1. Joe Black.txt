[Music: Fasciana; Lyrics: Blachowicz]

Life is never fair
To one who makes mistakes
Unrelenting wrath
upon all in his path

Blinded by his praise
Form of hidden craze
On a drunken frenzy
To harm the ones he loved

Betraying his own kind
The madness fills his mind
No one left to stop him
The innocent have died

Because of Joe

Low-life form of murder
Killing to hide his pain
Still free upon the earth
A father now insane
Amputation victim
Betrayed by his past
These are unfinal acts
committed by Joe Black

Joe

Low life form of murder
Killing to hide his pain
Still free upon the earth
A father now insane
Scarred with inner hatred
One leg to kick your ass
These are the final acts
Committed by Joe Black
