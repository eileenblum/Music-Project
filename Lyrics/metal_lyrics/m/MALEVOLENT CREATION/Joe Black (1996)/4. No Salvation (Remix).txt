[Music: Fasciana, Lyrics: Blachowicz]

Form emerges, cultists scatter
Unleashed torrent, prodigal son

When he adapts, sent forth is strength
When he does not, initiation ends
Seas will turn red with his blood
And the earth black, his charred soul

No dare to deceive
Human race will fall
Hell spawn

Bathe in fear, dormant truth
How she writhes, sacrifice

Priest emerges, only to fall
Screams from beyond, transfixed and repulsed
Revenge served cold , banished to hell
Healed by fear, fueled by hate

None dare to deceive
Human race will fall

Mandatory or destruction
Chaos enters, conjurations

No salvation, Mournful sorrow
Unleashed torrent, takes the mortals' lives
