[Music: Fasciana / Rubin, Lyrics: Lilienthal]

Fresh blood for the guilty
Looking for a cure
No willpower restrained
Lust for the blood
Only for the wicked
Tasteful agony
Need the blood to survive
My law, to draw

Bloodthirst

Hunger for a victim
Succeed, must feed
Craving fulfilled
Tasteful agony

Drain all the blood
No pain for innocence
Death for the greedy
Diminished red of the guilty

Blood

Tasteful agony

Hunger...
...must feed

Tasteful agony

Fresh blood...
...My law, to draw

Bloodthirst
