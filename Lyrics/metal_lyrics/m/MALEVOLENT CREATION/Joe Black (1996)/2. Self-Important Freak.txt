[Music: Fasciana, Barrett; Lyrics: Barrett]

You're the leader of the asshole race
Lying your way to the throne of shame
Sure to die in pain

No longer willing to pay
For the losers and the takers
You have sealed your own fate
Prepare yourself now
For the ultimate beating

On your knees

Taste the ground, lowered to defeat
Why did you try to fuck with me
Tables turn, so do limbs
A boot colliding with your chin
Taste the ground, your teeth will not be found
A trophy mine to keep

No longer willing to pay
For the losers and the takers
You have sealed your own fate
Prepare yourself now for the ultimate beating

On your fucking knees
Self-important freak

Taste the ground, lowered to defeat
Why did you try to fuck with me
Tables turn, so do limbs
A boot colliding with your chin
Taste the ground, your teeth will not be found
A trophy mine to keep
