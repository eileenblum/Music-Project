[Music: Fasciana; lyrics: Hoffmann]

Sorrow for the shallow
Shall never be had
Weed out the weak
Feed on the sad
High above the loathsome
Defiled by the crass
Mind is strong, soul is intent
Lingering on is this foul...

Stench I breathe
Fills my soul full of hate
Bend and bow to no one
Never shall you
Break my soul
Break my mind
Break my life
Dark purpose rages on

Once again we meet
Once again I greet you with
A goddamned fucking beating
Your frail soul is no compare
Genetic spare
Redundant try pitiful and trite
So all knowing
Now to realize now...

To face life, to love pain
They are one and the same
Bend and bow to no one
Never shall you
Break my soul
Break my mind
Break my life
Unleash the skein

Take my life, my flesh
No victor, no end to cash
Gaze upon the face
Deceit and pain
Forfeit your sad life
Dismantle it all destroy
Plug in the pain
Plunge in the blade

Take my life, my flesh
No victor, no end to cash
Gaze upon the face
Deceit and pain
Forfeit your sad life
Dismantle it all destroy
Plug in the pain
Plunge in the blade

Sorrow for the shallow
Shall never be had
Weed out the weak
Feed on the sad
High above the loathsome
Defiled by the crass
Mind is strong, soul is intent
Lingering on is this foul...

Stench I breathe
Fills my soul full of hate
Bend and bow to no one
Never shall you
Break my soul
Break my mind
Break my life
Dark purpose rages on
