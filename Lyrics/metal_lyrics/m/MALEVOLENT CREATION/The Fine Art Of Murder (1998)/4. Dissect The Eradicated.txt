[Music: Rios; lyrics: Hoffmann]

Losing this war, losing your mind
Inhuman end winding down time

Past that now haunts, history repeats
Thrown down in shame, this race deletes

Your head at my feet
Staring up what do you see
How does it feel, to feel for life
Now that it leaves you, your soul is tried

If you want to die
I'll teach you to die
If you want to [fucking] live
I'll show you revenge
Your living joke is my living hell
Your short grasp on life
Is my outer shell

The powers that I hold
To watch lives unfold
Believe in flaccid rules
I laugh at you fools

Nightmare unreal
Embrace the end
Your future fails
No life extends
Embellish the blood
Embellish the gore
Bottom fucking line
There is no more

The powers that I hold
To watch lives unfold
Believe in flaccid rules
I laugh at you fools

Past that now haunts, history repeats
Thrown down in shame, this race deletes
