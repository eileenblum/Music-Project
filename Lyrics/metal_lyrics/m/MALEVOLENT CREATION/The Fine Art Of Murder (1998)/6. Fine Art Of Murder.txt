[Music: Fasciana; lyrics: Hoffmann]

Swath of blood, shapes of the dead
My mind transforms to canvas in my head
Always striving set to achieve
And execute the fine art of...
Murder, murder, murder, murder
The fine art of

Swath of blood, shapes of the dead
My mind transforms to canvas in my head
Always striving set to achieve
And execute the fine art of...
Murder, murder, murder, murder
The fine art of

Blood soaked canvas
Knife for brush
Execution

Mind expressing
Hands achieving
Violent insight

Now to take it to extremes
Fine art of murder is achieved
Now to take it to extremes
Fine art of murder is achieved
Now to take it to extremes
Fine art of murder is achieved
Now to take it to extremes
Fine art of murder is achieved
Now to take it to extremes
Fine art of murder is achieved
Now to take it to extremes
Fine art of murder is achieved

Grizzly artwork comes to life
Your blood fantasy is my reality
Finish my work I leave my mark
Some call it murder,
I call it the fine art

Blood soaked canvas
Knife for brush
Execution

Mind expressing
Hands achieving
Violent inside

Blood soaked canvas
Knife for brush
Execution

Mind expressing
Hands achieving
Violent inside

Swath of blood, shapes of the dead
My mind transforms to canvas in my head
Always striving set to achieve
And execute the fine art of...
Murder, murder, murder, murder
The fine art of
Murder, my murder, your murder,
Mur-der
