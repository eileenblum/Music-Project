[Music: Fasciana; lyrics: Hoffmann]

Annul a race, destroy a kind
I'll take their land, I won't lose mine
Murder honored [misprinted as "honered" in CD liner notes?], peace is quelled
Death or dishonor, spirit melts
Pushing on, fire fight
Limbs on the ground, blinded sight
Piercing slug, piercing scream
Spraying blood, my enemy

Setting sights to take lives
To delimb, no war crimes
Feel the rape of your land
Drop like shit, useless stand
Incendiary [misprinted as "Incinderary" in CD liner notes?], you are ended
Still to fight, attempt and defend

Let me hear your battle cry
Is it the same before you die
Smell the death, inhale [the/your] pain
Taste the fear, violent insane
Skin burns hotter before it's cold
Into mass graves the bodies roll

Marching on killing fields
Through the blood pools wars ideals
Slice or hack or all is lost
Nuclear frost
Hand to hand, gun on gun
Biggest kill ratio wins the hunt
Pace the shells follow through
Extinguish and rule

Marching on killing fields
Through the blood pools wars ideals
Slice or hack or all is lost
Nuclear frost
Hand to hand, gun on gun
Biggest kill ratio wins the hunt
Pace the shells follow through
Extinguish and rule

Mass graves, the slain lie
Mass graves, coved with lye
Mass graves, tortured soul cries
Mass graves, war crimes

Annul a race, destroy a kind
I'll take their land, I won't lose mine
Murder honored [misprinted as "honered" in CD liner notes?], peace is quelled
Death or dishonor, spirit melts

Setting sights to take lives
To delimb, no war crimes
Feel the rape of your land
Drop like shit, useless stand
Incendiary [misprinted as "Incinderary" in CD liner notes?], you are ended
Still to fight, attempt and defend

Let me hear your battle cry
Is it the same before you fucking die
Smell the death, inhale [the/your] pain
Taste the fear, violent insane
Skin burns hotter before it's cold
Into mass graves the bodies roll
