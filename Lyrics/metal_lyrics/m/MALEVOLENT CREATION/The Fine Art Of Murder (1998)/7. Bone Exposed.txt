[Music: Fasciana; lyrics: Hoffmann]

Grabbing repent
Clutching remorse
Sins that are breathed
Sins at your source
Dumped blood upon the ground
Soaked up integrity
Broken limbs, broken screams
Spitting out obscenity
Disregard all life
Take fast make strikes
Tearing flesh to bone
Nothing left, no moans
Planted bodies, shallow graves
Rotted flesh, nostril craves
Abandoned hope and soul
Trapped inside, darkened hole
Bone exposed [3x]

Peel the flesh down to white
No more blood, no insides
Bleaching bones calcified trophy
Spindly veins feel now atrophy
Darkened call coming forward
No resist right is ignored
Blaring on no one survives
Wrath is on everyone dies
Bone exposed [3x]

Extinguish all life, this sin by my hand
Ripped down to bare bone
Now watch blood expand
Blade drawn stiffly clutched
Skin sliced tendons off
Body lifeless falls like shit
Exposed bone crimson fit

Peel the flesh down to white
No more blood inside
Bleaching bones calcified trophy
Spindly veins feel now atrophy
Darkened call coming forward
No resist right is ignored
Blaring on no one survives
Wrath is on everyone dies
Bone exposed [3x]
