[Music: Fasciana, Barret; lyrics: Hoffmann]

Instinct is trapped
Impulse evolved
Basics of life
Death now revolves

Innocence beyond the realms
Of a reasonable doubt
My justice defiled
Blood let your soul out
Try to cage my flesh
Hold my mind, break my soul
Fires fed with death
Fuck your mind, fuck your soul

Instinct is trapped
Impulse evolved
Basics of life
Death now revolves

Instinct is trapped
Impulse evolved
Basics of life
Death now revolves

Fake your life, wage your wars
Give this night, that soul you whore

Spill the challenge of blood
Skein upon my hands
Whether it be a world
Or me just one man
Do you realize
The action of your sums
Unleash the poisons of war
Feel the powers of one

Instinct is trapped
Impulse evolved
Basics of live
Death now revolves
