[Music: Rios; lyrics: Hoffmann]

Cadaver frozen stiff
To live in grieving ice
Can't feel hands or feet
Just want to forfeit life

Spilled blood keeps you warm
It may not be your own
Shellshocked insomnia
Attack at any cost

Drive on cannot stop
One hundred thousand fall
Among the scattered flesh
Glory of conquest calls

Columns roll on, bodies still fall
Eyes glazed over, the front can't stall
Columns roll on, bodies still fall
Eyes glazed over, the front can't stall

Snow falls white, it turns to red
Frozen in time, the tormented dead
Fight on for honor, fight to survive
For frozen landscape, the many have died

Drive on cannot stop
One hundred thousand fall
Among the scattered flesh
Glory of conquest calls
