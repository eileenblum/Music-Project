[Music: Fasciana; lyrics: Hoffmann]

Faltering my life
Dying before me
Not just my own fate
But the state of all
Unfolds before me
Spectator to see
Dismantle this race
Collective fall
Alive since conception
Stem taking root
Stem growing stronger
Extinction comes

Lamentate my life
Lamentate your life

Extinction flails before you
Grasp at your last thread
Ignorance ruled before you
Now it rules the dead
On your knees you beg
You fall, you plead
No answer to be found
The wound still bleeds
Alive since conception
Stem taking root
Stem growing stronger
Extinction comes

Lamentate my life
Lamentate your life

How deep, how deep the strike
The tears form in your eyes
So stray, to stray from right
On deaf ears fall your cries
Lamentation, lamentation
Lamentation day of

Falling for life to have
Your own left to live
One more soul left to give
One more we once had
Lamentation, lamentation
Lamentation day of

Faltering my life
Dying before me
Not just my own fate
But the state of all
Unfolds before me
Spectator to see
Dismantle this race
Collective fall
Alive since conception
Stem taking root
Stem growing stronger
Extinction comes

Lamentate my life
Lamentate your life
