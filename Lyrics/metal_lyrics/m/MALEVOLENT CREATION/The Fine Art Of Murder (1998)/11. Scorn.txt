[Music: Fasciana; lyrics: Hoffmann]

So, you think you've won
Fucked up all my fun
Reason that I live
All that I can give
I will find another
The worse it will be
You may have stopped this
But you can't stop me!

Staring at you, obsessing
Grabbing for you, mind stressing

Staring at you, obsessing
Grabbing for you, mind stressing
Stalk, scorned

Again I will unleash
This lust, it is my call
I know that I feast
Your body soon will fall
Pray to the stalker
Prey of the stalker

Hiding in trees
Peering through windows I see
That which will be solely owned by me
Stalking scorned
