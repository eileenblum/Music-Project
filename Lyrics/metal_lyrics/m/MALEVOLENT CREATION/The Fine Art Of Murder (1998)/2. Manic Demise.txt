[Music: Fasciana, Barret; lyrics: Hoffmann]

Blood curdled dismemberment
Pain beyond scream
Slicing through sinew and bone
Blood letting extreme

Beg and cry sustain your life
Streaming like tears your innards flow
Simple solution negative end
Taste the death, your only friend
Feel the neck firm in my hands
Wet sounding snap welcomes your end
Gurgle of air leaving the lungs
Starting to hack begging of

Blood curdled dismemberment
Pain beyond scream
Slicing through sinew and bone
Blood letting extreme

Live to die unsatisfied
Reality now ratified
Body heaves hitting the ground
Bloodsoaked thud slashing sound
Raise your hand reaching high
All in vain unmerciful sky
Gurgle of air leaving the lungs
Choking for life, brain is now numb

Manic demise

Clasp at my ankles
Your face kissing floor
Last stroke of the blade
You exist no more

Manic demise, searing cries
Manic demise, dead on the rise
Manic demise, absolution mine
Manic demise

Alone at last embrace my kiss
Swift and fast this darkened bliss
Through you I go soon to arrive,
Victim of manic demise
