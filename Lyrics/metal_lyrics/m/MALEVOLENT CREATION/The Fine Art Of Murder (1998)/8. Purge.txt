[Music: Rios; lyrics: Hoffmann]

Bodies charred, no scream felt
No life left, humanity melts
Feel the end delivered whole
Try to deny what you don't know
Pushing on passing fear
Hope is lost, flesh is seared
Face is blank drained of heat
Blood is spilled, blood is free

Mercy is all gone
Greed lives raging on
Legacy is all that's left
Innocent violent theft

Look and wonder why
Flames lap at the sky
Soul is all but claimed
Life is left to blame

Bodies charred, no screams felt
No life left, humanity melts
Feel the end delivered whole
Try to deny what you don't know
Pushing on passing fear
Hope is lost, flesh is seared
Face is blank drained of heat
Blood is spilled, blood is free

Mercy is all gone
Greed lives raging on
Legacy is all that's left
Innocent violent theft

Look and wonder why
Flames lap at the sky
Soul is all but claimed
Life is left to blame

Fuck your feast or famine
Denied the evil elaborate
Your weakness, your legacy
Frees you pussy ass
