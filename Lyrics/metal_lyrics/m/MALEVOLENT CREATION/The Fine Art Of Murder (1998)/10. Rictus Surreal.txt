[Music: Rios, Fasciana; lyrics: Hoffmann]

No wake, from this sleep
Still see, the empty gaze
Still see, the faceless teeth
Rictus surreal

Locked in unfettered embrace
How is this so real
Why now, the grin still says
Rictus surreal

Horror explodes filling the soul
No betrayal of face contorted it stays
Can't I take the eyes, staring at nothing
Don't view the grin, denied a shutting

Rictus surreal, rictus surreal

Holding on to what's left
Ecstacy or grimace
Ending life with no fear
Struggle unclear
To attack your own end
Triumphant grin you endured
Maybe nothing may only be
Just nerves

Holding on to what's left
Ecstacy or grimace
Ending life with no fear
Struggle unclear
To attack your own end
Triumphant grin you endured
Maybe nothing may only be
Just nerves

No wake, from this sleep
Still see, the empty gaze
Still see, the faceless teeth
Rictus surreal

Locked in unfettered embrace
How is this so real
Why now, the grin still says
Rictus surreal [3x]

Holding on to what's left
Ecstacy or grimace
Ending life with no fear
Struggle unclear
To attack your own end
Triumphant grin you endured
Maybe nothing may only be
Just nerves

Rictus surreal
