Convulse, twisted
Falling to the ground
Saliva flowing free
tasting, choking
Swallowed your tounge
Eyes roll back in your head

Frantic twiching
Multiple spasms
Legs begin to buckle
Face blue, can't breath
Trying to cry out
Your efforts are useless
Hacking vomit
want to be free
Just don't want to be seen

Convulse......

Consuming your pride
cursed by this desease
Thouse around you panic
Onlookers start to freeze

Living in fear
Tearing your soul
No cure for this pain
This is your hell
Given at birth
Symptoms take course
Seizure taking over

Consuming.....

Convulse.....
