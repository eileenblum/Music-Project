No chance for survival
spilling innocent blood
Cries of the undead
too deafening to ignore
Craving desire
Into the terror unknown
Never to live again
Life pulled inside out

There's no escape
from this addiction
Insanity
Acting inhuman
Fierce kisses bruise
Blue lips and white skin
Veins pump with fear
Flow for destruction
Blind stench of death
Warm blood on red hands
Now left to dead
motionless body
Have no remorse
Soulless obsession
Black heart of stone
Cold satisfaction

The hunter and the hunted
Killing for gain
Violence erupts
like sulfur to a flame
Into the heart of hell
Only life even known
Not afraid to die
Battle lines are drawn

There's no escape......
.....cold satisfaction

Allies in this war
have nothing to lose
Take life for game
Slaughter never ends
Allies in this war
their live force divine
Falling to their knees
The end of the line
In cold blod....
