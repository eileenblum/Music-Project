Hypocritical views
Everyone that you betrayed
all your words mean nothing
I ignore the things you say
Full of ignorance
Blow out of proportion
King of nothing
compulsive lying trash

Dr. Jeckyl Mr. Hyde
Always talking shit
disregard for others
Living in sin
Two faced backstabber
Running out of tricks
One day they will hit you
Like a tonn of bricks

Freak of nature
Contemplaiting disarray
By manipulation
You get your pathetic way

Two faced......

People you offend
Driven to a frolic state
Hands around your neck
Taste my wrath and feel my hate

Behind your lies
locked inside this private hell
Nothing you regret
Ineer truth will never spin

Hypocritical.....
....tonn of bricks
