Mindless ignorance
A burden to all
Beyond help
Waiting for your wake up call

Don't know your priorities
Lost in depression
It's too late now
To save you from yourself

Don't want to be a slave
Lern to earn your way

Opportunity
In your face you don't see
Morals you receive
No more dignity
Living off others
Draining all your pride
Talking through your ass
Think you're something you're not

Leech
Can't you see you nothing for me
Leech
Give an inch, then you take advantage

Don't want to be.......
........earn your way

Opportunity.......
......no more dignity

Don't know your priorities.....
.......to save you from yourself.
