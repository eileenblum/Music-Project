Soldiers off to war
to rule and conquer land
Greeting the enemy
with their impaled heads
Emperor's wrath
Now unleashed upon this
world full of hate

Ruler of his kingdom
Betrayed by his church
Out for revenge
Denouncement of faith

Mountains painted red
Stained in blood for victory
Return to his land
Born the unholy

Enslaving races
Killing frenzied lust
Consuming humans
encrusted in blood

World domination Darkness will
conquer
Mankind has fallen
Hear the dark ones laugh
as your life is drained

Rule of his kingdom....
....of faith

Soldier off to war...
...of hate.
