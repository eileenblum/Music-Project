Disregard for law and order
Will of God slain
Assailants born to wreck his world
Inhuman rage

Madman gaining profit
Delivering desease
This twisted achievement
Now belongs to me

I will make you bleed
Killing in my game
No mercy don't care
Shred humanity

Disregard......

Egoistical
Don't want to die in shame
Future world condemned
Heartless rulers to blame

Cold blooded killer
Thick skinned and ruthless
Can't prevent his triumph
Boundless hatered will rise

I will make you burn
Take your lives away
Cities laid to waste for eternity
