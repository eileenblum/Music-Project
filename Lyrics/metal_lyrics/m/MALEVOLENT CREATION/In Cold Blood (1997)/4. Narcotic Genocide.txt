Living day by day
Don't see what you've become
Your life thrown away
on a stupid drug

Scum of the earth
No consideretion
Taking not giving
Lost in your addiction

A fix, all you need
Time to get some smack
Next thing you know
Now you're smoking crack
Lying to all
Just want to score
Worhless user
craving for more

This is you downfall
Substance abuser
Going nowhere fast
Narcotic user
This is your downfall
Substance abuser
Going nowhere fast
Narcotic loser

Scum....

Living day by day....
