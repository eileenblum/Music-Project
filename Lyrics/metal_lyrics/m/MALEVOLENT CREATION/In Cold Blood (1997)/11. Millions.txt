Always complaining
Scared by the past
Need someone to blame
You'll never last

Put you in your place
Haunted by your face
Fear of what you are
Guilty by far

Marching for your rights
These forgotten ways
You don't realize
This time no one pays

Society, can't you see
You're no different than me
Betrayed by your own kind
Not just facts but reality

Overpopulation
They breed like rats
Standing for one nation
Under a God who laughs

Always......
.......you'll never last

Condemned, by what you've become
Criminally infested
Guilty, for all you have done
Surround by millions

Society.....

Overpopulation.....

Marching.....
