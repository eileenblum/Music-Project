Some man never
Some live some die

Never discriminate the hunger fed
Searching for yor inner hatred
Demise, plague on earth
released to be weaken, self control is broken

Some man.....
.....some die
Shattered are the lives
around you
Conquer the underworld of your fear
Mountains painted with revulsion decay,
echoes of life become dust

I declare war

Greed
Sloth
Wrath
Envy
Pride
Lust
Greed
Sloth
Wrath
Gluttony

Never discriminate.....
......self control is broken

Some man....
.....some die.
