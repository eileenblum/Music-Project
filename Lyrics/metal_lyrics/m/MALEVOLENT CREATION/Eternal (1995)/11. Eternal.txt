[Music Fasciana / lyrics Blachowicz]

Wasted flesh, stripped from life, now you die
Hear no more, feelings numb, gone the sky
Loss of sight, no sun no dawn
To an end your life is drawn

Subconscious, all now damned
Hear me , where 's my soul
No hope, endless cries
Mind not dead , body lies

Void beyond hellfilled fate, shadows descend
Shroud of dark, rest no peace, time to end
Blackened dreams , pours black rain
No way out, unfelt pain

Strangled, a victim ravaged, let me out
Murdered , damned to this , try to flee, useless

Suck

Swollowed in a hole filled black
Deny this curse, no turning back
End this life of misery
Don't want to hear, don't want to see
Voice beyond, blackened fate , no escape
Time to end your life

Raped and torn away from life
Born to unseen light
Soul is lost, no will to fight
An unseen force strips all migth

Void beyond ......
............end your life

Damned to darkness
Damned to this hell
