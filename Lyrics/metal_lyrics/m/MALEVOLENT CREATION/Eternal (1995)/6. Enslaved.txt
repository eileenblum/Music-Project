[music Fasciana, Rubin / lyrics Blachowicz]

Darkened forms surround you
Decayed rotten stench
Casualties are sent down
Nightmare has begun

Lambs to the slaughter
Waiting to die
Your land infested
Killer elite

Last day alive
Don't want to die
Unknown reason
Your race enslaved

Anger, hatred, brings out your savagery
Soldiers, bred to fight, conquer, dominate
Achive nothing when you try to resist
Perished are your rights,they mean nothing true

Lies

Leaders inhuman
Wearing your skin
Hours of torture
Off with your head
(repeat)

Darkened.........
........killer elite

Last day alone.....
........race enslaved
