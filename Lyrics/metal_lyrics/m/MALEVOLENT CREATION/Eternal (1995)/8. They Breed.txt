[music Fasciana, lyrics Fasciana / Blachowicz]

Born into this world of filth
A plague in every city
The real world in not so real
Filled with scum and lying thieves
Threats of pain, claiming lives
When we owe you nothing
Forced to live in fear forever
Still they breed

Always wanting , always taking
What was never yours
Someday you will feel the hate
That you gave to others

Filled with diseases
Still they breed

Hate towards you and your kind
Bad blood flows forever
My life is not complete
Until you've killed each others

Always........
....gave to others.
