[music Fasciana / lyrics Blachowicz]

Broken hide, torn back skin
Drown in blood and pain

Mangled, malignity
Innards manifest
Tendons, peel back
Carnage ripped

Muscles flap, nerve ends shriek
Spine torn from your brain

Mangled......
...........carnage ripped

Trash

Vile stench, shredded vein
Blue pus spewing pure
Dislocate, broken legs
Mutilated form

Rip, splore

Broken hide......
........blood and pain
Muscles flap, ripped in half
Spine torn from your brain
