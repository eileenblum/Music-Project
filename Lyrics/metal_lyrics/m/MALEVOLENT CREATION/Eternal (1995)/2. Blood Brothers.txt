[music Fasciana,Rubin / lyrics Fasciana]

Nightfall beckons
Our gathering
Stronger we grow
Together as one
Unceasing will to live
To take life, not give

We've killed before
We'll kill again
Animals we are
Not men

Life is the key to immortality
In the end there can only be one

Partners in crime forever
`Til death do us part
Seeking gain for existence
For now we remain blood brothers

Exempt from death, exempt from oblivion
Lifeline is cut off to all

Killing with no sign of stopping
Perpetual means of survival

We've killed......
........Seeking gain for existence
For eternity I will return
