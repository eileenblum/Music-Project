[music Fasciana / lyrics Blachowicz]

Made by the assemblers
Clothed  in carbon steel
Fiber optics integrate
Vengeance turned loose

Put you out
Of your misery
Make you suffer
For your treachery
Vengeance served
When you take a life
Innocence avenged
Suffer the consequence

Strike

Made by.......
....................turned loose

Hellfire

Put you out.....
......suffer the consequence

Rebirth

Made by.......
.........turned loose
