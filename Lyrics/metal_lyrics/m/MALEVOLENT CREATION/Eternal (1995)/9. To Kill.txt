[music Fasciana , Rubin / lyrics Blachowicz]

Over wart, wrest, abusion
Misused, twisted faith
Urgeful lust to prevail
Master of this reign

Madness

Frenzy, a madman's wrath
Furious maniac
Forced to an abundant rage
Malpractice, hostile acts

Thoughts, forcing them into your brain
Insane, malicious ill willed being
Grudge, a virulent disorder
Hatred to those who oppose your fate
Hate

Deranged evildoer
Despire, abusive menace
Carnal pest, epidemic
Fatal, vexing plague

Abusion

Driven scourge, pessimist
Vermin blore, drenched with filth

Impure

To kill

Over wart......
....twisted faith
