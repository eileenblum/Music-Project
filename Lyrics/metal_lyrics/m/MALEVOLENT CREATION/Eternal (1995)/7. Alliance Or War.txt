[music Fasciana, Rubin / lyrics Blachowicz]

Revolution sent in blood
On a warpath to destroy
Noble trooper born to rule
Only ways known, alliance or war

Increase of population
A catastrophe
Means found will forestall
The hunger and misery

A method quite ruthless
Impedes procreation
Submitting the offspring
Preserving the strength

Healthy one will conquer
The feeble and diseased
Brutally will punish
The weak and the unfit

Revolution......
.........or war

Seeds are sown, nations scorned
Stronger race, kill the weak
Terminate,vital urge
I will gain your defeat
