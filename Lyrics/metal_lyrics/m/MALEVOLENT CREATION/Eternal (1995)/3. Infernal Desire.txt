[music Fasciana, Rubin / lyrics Blachowicz]

Animal remains, mutilations
Organs removed, homicide of humans

Jugular veins, torn wide open
Blood is drawn, High priest obeys

Freedom of religion
One law abused and raped
Carcass filled maggots
Stalking innocent life
Become a believer
Your soul, for them to make

Pagan followers, looked down upon
Cast forth in robes, alound they pray

All that is holy, now far gone
Victim beheaded, sacrifice made

Carcass filled......
...........soul for them to make
