[music &amp; lyrics Fasciana]

Searching through your fears
Thunderous voice calls
Darkness gives and takes
Your desire your mistake

From the ground below
Winds of torment grown
Stronger the warning
Stronger you feel
The endless journey
In search of fear
Takes all and ends all
Hopes of payback crushed

Swallowed and spat out
From the earth that ate you
The gates to life are closed now
Your future is at halt
Take heed to the inferior
Beings that you've summoned
Jorney's end the search is over
When you're dead , you dead forever

Searching........
..........your mistake.
