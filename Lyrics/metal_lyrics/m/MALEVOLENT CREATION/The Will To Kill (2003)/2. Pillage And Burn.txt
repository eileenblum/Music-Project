Swift invasion, bold and precise
Minimal resistance from the opposition
Massive drove of soldiers, interpret certain doom
The worst is yet to come though;
They know what they must do

Round them up like cattle, commence
With the festivities
Orders must be carried out
Instructions to incinerate

The innocent and guilty burn as one
Examples
For the evil
They have 
Done

Pillage and burn,
All that stands
Will fall in flames
Pillage and burn, retaliatory act of rage

Conflicting beliefs have caused this rift
A means to and end will never be seen

So it goes back and forth
Armies of faith orchestrate the killing
Torches thrown,  all is ablaze
Nothing remains alive at first light
