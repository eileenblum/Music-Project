Attack!!!!!
Uncontrollable, psychotic hysteria
Driven by blood, unsatisfiable
All his victims, considered as trophies
This is his thrill, the will to kill

Extracting souls with his knife
No emotional value for life
Crimson stains cover his clothes
Remnants of who tried to oppose

Determined to commite homicides with no regrets
Forces within his mind, passion for these corrid crimes
The Will..... To Kill... The Will to fucking kill

Livid fascinations, unthinkable to most
Day after day, this inner conflict grows
Now unstoppable, this storm of murder
Unidentified, bodies discovered

Morbid fanticies brought to sight
The will to kill is his life
The will to kill
