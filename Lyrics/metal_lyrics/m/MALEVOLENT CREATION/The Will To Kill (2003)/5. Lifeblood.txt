One existence to achieve the goals my soul demands
The carnage sick and twisted, death is at hand

Tragedy strikes, in a matter of seconds another taken life
Feeding on fear, no given reason nothing is clear
Nightmares now real, embrace the final months
Pleasure so real
Lunacy reigns, the victim, a trophy of 
These murderous games
Disposal? No need, for all others a calling card to see
A mind deranged, no one plans on losing their life this way
Blood on my blade, stained by the lives
From my trucidations 

The power that instills, dissipation of the kill
Flowing through my veins, the controlling of my ways

Adrenaline flows, lurking in the night until my choice draws close, under
Restraint, now in my grasp there is no escape
Slicing the throat, to stop the screams on their blood they will choke
To victimize, death rattle marks the ending of this life

One existence to achieve the goals my soul demands
The carnage sick and twisted, death is at hand, the power 
That instills, dissipation of the kill, flowing through my veins,
The controlling of my ways

Tragedy strikes, in a matter of seconds another taken life
Feeding on fear, no given reason nothing is clear
Nightmares now real, embrace the final moments
Pleasure  so real
Lunacy reigns, the victim, a trophy of these murderous games
Disposal?  No need, for all others a calling card to see
A mind deranged, no one plans on losing their lives these ways
Stained by life from my trucidations 
Blood in my veins, I am controlled by these trucidations
