Measures of hate, only few can understand
For their beliefs, these horrendous plans

Prepare to die... from youth they are taught
To achieve a certain peace, to be martyred next to God

Believing, achieving, fulfilling  the killings
Their only known way of life
Live have been planned out strategically mapped now for
When its their time

No fears that they possess, device strapped to their chest
Brainwashed by their faith, a lost hypnotic state
Driven all through the life by what they think is right-
Human missile launched, religious holocaust

All that remains, promises are made
All that remains, the innocent are slain
All that remains, a foreseen place of rest
All that  remains for their lives are their deaths

The numbers grow with time, destruction in their minds
These recruits await, a chance for heavens gates
People gripped with fear not knowing when death is near
Bloodsheds will arise, no regrets of who will die

Honored by their deeds, those with the same beliefs
Helpless towards these acts, unseen ruthless attacks
No end to this in sight, all treaties failed thru time
Blood now fills the streets, a vision that repeats
