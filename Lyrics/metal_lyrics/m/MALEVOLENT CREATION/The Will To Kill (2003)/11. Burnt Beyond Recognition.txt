He thought that he could get away
With this
Quite wrong, time will turn the tide
Feeble piece of shit oblivious
After a sufficient lapse  of time

Psychotic build up... fantasize, Wheels are in motion... Demoralize

My vengeance his pain
Voices inside instruct the disdain

Burn him... beyond, burn him... beyond recognition

He never imagined it would end this way
Tortured, twisted and scorched in flames
What did he do to deserve this?
Cross me, I become subversive

Crawling on all fours, trying to escape
Now he's drenched in gasoline, I ignite the flames
