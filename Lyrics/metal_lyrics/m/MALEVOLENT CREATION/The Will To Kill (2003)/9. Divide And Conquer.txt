Fulmination begins, 
Accept our demands
Final warning, this is our stand
Plans are made your time grows near
The beginning, of your worst fears

You've waited too much time; see
You at the battle line
There are no plans for peace,
Failure our worst enemy
To defeat their regime,
Annihilation is the key
A fusillade now begins,
Striking bodies, piercing skin
Missiles fired targets found, bombs pounding at
The ground
Smoke and dust cloud their air, our enemies in despair

Surrounded by blood and flesh, some are wounded most are dead
Battlegrounds turn to graves for the ones who have
Been slain
Divide and conquer... many lives will be lost
Divide and conquer... victory is worth the cost

Conquering all their territories innocent deaths and casualties
Nothing felt of guilt or remorse, this is total fucking war
Kill or be killed is our task, ascending now within grasp
The battles rage on until we see that our mission is complete

Submission is at hand, the smoke now fades
The smell of powder and death still remain
Killed in battle, few are alive
None are forgotten, for giving their lives

Shackles of war

Conquer all their territories innocent deaths and casualties
Nothing felt of guilt or remorse, this is total fucking war
Kill or be killed is our task, ascending now within grasp
The battles rage on until we see that our mission is complete
