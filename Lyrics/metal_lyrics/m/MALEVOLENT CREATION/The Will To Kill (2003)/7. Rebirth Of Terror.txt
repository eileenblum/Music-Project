Impulses kept under control 
How long until I unfold?
Awakened in sweat once again by my dreams a rebirth 
Of terror is now soon to be
Many years now have passed since cold skin
In my grasp.  addiction for murder, a blood fantasy,
Reviving the past will soon set me free

My mind is racing with thoughts so obscene
Superior force, this conquest unseen
The slaughter of others is all that I crave
My chains of decency starting to break
Never a suspect for kills in the past
Leaving no evidence I cover my track
I thought I conquered my demons inside
Rebirth of terror augmenting through time

My mind is racing with thoughts so obscene, superior force
This conquest unseen, the slaughter of others is all
That I crave, my chains of decency starting to break
Never a suspect for kills in the past
Leaving no evidence I cover my tracks

I thought I conquered my demons inside
Rebirth of terror augmenting through time
