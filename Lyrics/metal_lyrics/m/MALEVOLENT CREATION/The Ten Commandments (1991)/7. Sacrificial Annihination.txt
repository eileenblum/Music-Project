Bone marrow twisted, white sockets shattered,
Black flesh blistered, hungry maggots grow fatter.
Tendons snap, cartilage corroding.
Contorted muscles flap, clotted blood flowing.
Circumstances beyond that of your feeble minds.
Helpless victims scream in fear, for they know of their finds.

Carcasses lie piled, some gaping, some rotted.
Yellow pus dripping, putrid and hottened.
Bluing flesh quivers, loosened and bloated.
Final stage of death, rigor mortis unfolded.
Faces of white staring right through you.
This hellish sight knows you're its own fool.
Your hell.

Odor of carrion is thick in the air.
Puddles of mucous, flesh starts to tear.
Innolation intruding on your body and souls.
Immoral adoration, extinction takes its toll.
Viewing this onslaught before me.
Its beauty is soo fucking rare.
Take one look and you will see.
Devastation wrought with precision and care.

From his fist, swift death is dealt.
Your head up your ass, much pain is felt.
Body all twitching, brain nerves dead,
In a flick of his eyes, your maker's met.
Sacrificial, sacrificial, sacrificial, annihilation (X3)
Sacrificial annihilation.

Panic has stricken, stiff bodies abound.
Your need to escape, but the means are not found.
Tiny little flesh creatures flee for their lives.
From the plasm he returns, now it's time to die.
Sacrificial, sacrificial, sacrificial, annihilation (X3)
Sacrificial annihilation.

Mutilation, asphyxiation, dying by my grasp.
Futile moves made by you to stop me in my tracks.
Don't you know now as your limbs grow cold.
I am your destruction.
Sacrificial annihilation.
