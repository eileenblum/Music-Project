Killing spree unleashed, threshold of pain broken free.
Ignorance of life, to reach with insanity bred to strike.
Once sacrilege, to take the life of another.
Now common practice, to kill all others.
Sadistic ways, portrayal of death done.
Hands grasp at wounds, ongoing penetration.

Deception, plays the role in this game.
Domination, powertrip fools fall to blame.

Washing your hands in stale pools of blood.
Killing confrontation, unceasing battle wages on.
No self control, murder brings no guilt.
Priorities carried out, no one left to stand.

Revelation, more and more confirmed as time passes by.
Left to burn, carnage fills this endless void.
Rotted minds, the stinking filth of violence floods the air.
Homicidal thoughts flow freely through the head.

Your mind alone, to deal with sin, to now commit,
The need to kill.

Thou shall kill.
Values of God remembered no more.
Tablets, shattered, defaced, obsolete.
Thou shall kill.
Values of God thrown to the ground.
Tablets, shattered, defaced, no more.

Frozen terror locked on a face gone pale.
Taking deliverance, irrational fate.

Abandoned for, the path taken, easier route.
To kill a man, simple gesture, in a world gone mad.
Flowing red, taints all souls the coloor of death.
Innocence, a word only whispered under breath.

Thou shall kill.
Values of God remembered no more.
Tablets, shattered, defaced, obsolete.
Thou shall kill.
Values of God thrown to the ground.
Tablets, shattered, defaced, no more.

Your mind alone, to deal with sin, to now commit,
Aimlessly kill.
Voices are heard, whispered in pain, mentally sent,
Releasing its command.
Thou shall kill.
