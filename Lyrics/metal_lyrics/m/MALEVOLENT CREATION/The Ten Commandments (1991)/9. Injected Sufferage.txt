Feel the dirty needle penetrate your healthy flesh.
Transfusion of your fluids brings on deficient death.
Useless is your attempt to avoid the casual lay.
There goes your skin out from under your teeth,
Welcome to the world of Aids.
Injected sufferage.

Lay around, wait to die, can't take the pain, want to die.
Euthanasia, your final plea, don't want to live, don't want to be.

A victim of this damned life.
No fucking will to fight.
Just got to get out of,
Your violent plight.

Injected sufferage, injected, sufferage.

Hooked up to life's machines, looks of despair as the doctor gleams.
Cannot move, immobilized, see the life slip from their eyes.
Skin so white, pale and loose, try to fight, it's of little use.
To face death and it won't be fast.
To an agonizing end your body's cast.

Injected through the anal, arm, or blood.
Unprotected cells deteriorate, life is done.
Agonizing the way you lead the rest of your wretched life.
Sufferage bound in your own insane hell.

Don't want to die, should have stayed clean.
Now you're going to suffer until the end of your being.
