Once There Was A Hermit
Who Was Chasing Dragons
Villagers Called Upon His Name
He Would Be The One To
Annihilate The Dragon, Bless Him
Onwards The Dingle Of Dragons

Fighting Dragons, With My Sword
The Dragon Sword, The Lost Legend

Saunters Into The Forest
Find The Snoring Dragon
Waiting And Flaming
To Caprice Our Saviour

The Battle Between Two Creatures
Pugnacious, Weariness, Clattering
The Dragon Breathes His Last Breath

Considering The Birth Of The Occurrence
Grimed And Perished, He Thought
About The Sword, The Dragon Sword
The Withering Dragon Was Devoured

Strolling Towards The Hamlet
With An Endorsed Gaze
In His Sloppy Wards
Content With His Mandate

The Villagers Are Waiting For
The Return Of The Dragon Slayer

Arrived At The Atrium Of His Settlement
Inhabitants Asking, Admiring
He Who Cultivate The Dragon

The Wild Boars Frizzled
Barley Water Flows Abundantly
A Banquet Of Eternal Victory.
