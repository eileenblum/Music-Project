Banished From The Hidden Dungeons Of The Mystic Castle
Wandering Through The Forgotten Chambers Of The Falling Darkness
Upon The Path Of Silent Sorrows, I Dwell Anonymous
As I Saunters Through The Slumber Of The Unseen Forest
I Dwell Anonymous

My Sweltering Eyes Turned Black, Day By Day
My Spirit Flows Through My Veins, Again And Again
My Tortured Body Is Rotting Away, Forever Goodbye
With Bitterness In My Eyes I See The Sun Blackening
As I Thought, My Mighty Raven-eyes Turn Unto My Black-eyes

Innocently Blackness Takes Over My Eyes
Looking Towards The Moonless Evening
A Defloration Of The Unknown Star
But I Can't See, I Only Smell My Fears

I Feel The Sunlight Sweltering
Sweltering Upon My Innocent Black-eyes
Thought Swirling Through My Head

Now That You Are Hurting Your Eyes
I Will Confess My Crimes Of Misery
Prove That You Are Innocent And I Am Not
Your Sweltering Black-eyes Of Innocence.
