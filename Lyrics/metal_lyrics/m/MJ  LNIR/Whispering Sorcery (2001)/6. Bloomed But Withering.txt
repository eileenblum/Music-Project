Roaming Beneath The Frozen Moon
Darkness Enshrouds
Searching Upon The Icy Path
Winter Overtakes
A Place To Remember
Slumber Through
Breeding The Autumn Leaves
Summon The Dark
Listen To The Howling Stars
With My Eyes Closed

My Life Is Blooming
It Must Be
But Withers At The End
We All Die
Thorns Touching My Soul
Destiny's End
My Life Is Over, Forever
Your Last Breath

Your Time Has Come
Endless Entwined Emotions
Came Above By Seeing
That I Bloom And You Withered

Apocalyptic Signs Rise In The Evening Sky
Twilight Of The Gods
Summing The Cold Sunlight To Eclipse The Howling Stars
Frozen Roses, Mouthy Flowers

Towards The Awakening Mourning Dawn
Flying Beneath The Ivory Winter Clouds
I Close My Eyes And Withered Away.
