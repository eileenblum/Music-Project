Falling Further From The Nestling - We Have Become
From Necessity Or Poverty - I'm Rafting Down
From Them Who Whittle My Tongue

...Falling Further...

And There's A Violent Agitator Town Below
Ascending Himself - Choosing My Emptiness
I'm Not Immortal - Gravity Will Show
When I Crash Down - The Black Bird Comes To Take Away My Soul
