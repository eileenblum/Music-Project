We are building the prison, Praying
We are feeding religion, Murder
The fate of every human is chained to the passion
We are building the prison, we are feeding religion of chaos
The fate of every human is chained to the passion of chaos
You are blinding the children, you are stealing their vision
Building on their virgin soul your conception of the reality
We'll always be alone, you're always be the ones
Praying under the flag of your nation
Breeding the threat
Burning redemption through the flames of murder
