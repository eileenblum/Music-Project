It's time to realize how weak the humans are
It's time to realize how cold the liquids are
Becoming the biggest streams from a single drop
Becoming the coldest realms of the origins
Cold
It feels so cold within the liquid
It feels so cold within the liquid
It feels so cold within the liquid
It feels so cold within the liquid
It's time to realize how soiled the oceans are
It's time to realize how deep the evils hides
Becoming the biggest threat for the weakest
Becoming the face of death through a liquid fest
Cold
It's time to hear the silent screams
It's time to to face the sickest realms
Within the coldest of the seas
Humans only legacies
We're nothing more than the sons of march
Raping the world through carnal wars
It feels so cold within the liquid
It feels so cold within the liquid
It feels so cold within the liquid
It feels so cold within the liquid
