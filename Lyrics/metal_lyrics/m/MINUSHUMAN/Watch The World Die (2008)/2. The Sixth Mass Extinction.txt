As a giant wave cleaning all away
All we have lost has faded away
Within the streams of the oceans
What we hide is what we are
And the liquid burns as the planet turns
Freezing away as yesterday
What we hide is what we are
Are we such an ugly fucking tribe
Trying to suck all it can be
Being what we try to hide
A lonely race
And the giant wave growing all the way
Within the storm it's coming home
What we hide is what we are
We are now in the starting of extinction
We are now in a lethal disillusion
We'll be dead tomorrow
Embracing our sorrow
We have created the chaos
Opened Pandora's box
And the giant wave cleans all away
All we have lost has fade away
Within the streams of the oceans
What we hide is what we are
And the liquid burns as the planet turns
Freezing away, as yesterday
What we hide is what we are
What we hide
