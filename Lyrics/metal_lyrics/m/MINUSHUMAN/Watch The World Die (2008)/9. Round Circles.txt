The earth revolutions as the metric of our days
How many left before this blow away?
Rotating spheres dancing in the blackest night
As the eyes of the sky counting the days before we die
Round are the circles of time
Thirty thousands days ad we die
Round are the circles of time
Before and after, what do all that mean
Is there a way to control the realm?
As an infant born under the moon
Time is a journey from the cradle to the tomb
Deathclock disillusion as the countdown to the end
Thirty thousands days to understand the blend
Why is everything turning again and again and again
As if the starting was the twin of the end?
Round are the circles of time
Thirty thousand days and we die
Round are the circles of time
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
These are the words of religious crust
Selling human the evil dance
Enjoy your time before the fence
If ever a preacher came in front of me
In the wish to feed me with holy verses
To purify my soul of deepest sin
He would face the fury of the deceived heretic
Ashes to ashes dust to dust
We're feeling deeper now
The taste of dust
Under the sun within the shadows
Condemned to live in the kingdom of sorrow
