Breeding the machinery
Growing energy eating all that can be
Breeding time
Beneath perception of matter
Beneath human's conception of power
Beneath Time
Time Zero
Devouring emptiness, growing tumor
Neverending circle of blasting energy
The awakening of time
Creation of everything we have to believe
Is real
Beside this dimension, beside your perception
Below comprehension, hide so many worlds
Forever reality, forever infinity
The quantum mechanics  hide so many...worlds
