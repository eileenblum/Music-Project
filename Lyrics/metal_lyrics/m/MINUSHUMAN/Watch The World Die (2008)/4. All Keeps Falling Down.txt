Why is all just falling
Why is all just falling down
From the mountains , to the oceans
Why is all just falling down
Earth, Mother
How can we do this to you
Earth, Mother
How can we be so cruel
Earth, Mother
The sky is blackening up my eyes
It feels so cold, within your arms
Please come back to life
God, father, I can fear you screaming
God, Father, From the deepest abyss
God, Traitor, why does it feel so cold
Are you trapped within you
Are you trapped within me
