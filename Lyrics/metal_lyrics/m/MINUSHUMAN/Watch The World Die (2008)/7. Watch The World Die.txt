Population increase, concrete burning the fields
Pandemic warnings, why is all going to fast?
Pollution overseas, patriotic issues
Crisis in every places of the world
Destruction is Creation
The monster lies inside
Territory conflicts, the wars taking them children
A modern bloody crusade raping the face of the earth
Cloning technology, Evolution first enemy
Why are we all going so fast?
Economic issues leading human condition
God has met his master and has turned into slave
Population growing leading empires to suffocate
The world is about to implode
This is the world we share, this is in our hands
The playground of a few spreading anger
This is a world of hate, a burning symphony
The cries of angels riving the silence
