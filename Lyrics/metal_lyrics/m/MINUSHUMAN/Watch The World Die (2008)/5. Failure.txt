Procreation, Generation, Supervision
Robotic transmissions, bionic transplantations
Human's control of species aspirations
Synthetic illusions, genetic manipulations
Pathetic condition of the kind of creation
But he king has failed
In the curse to reveal
To light the invisible
The king is lost
Failure of the dreamer
