I can see clearly now
can see the world falling apart
I can see clearly now
the consequences of my actions
I can see clearly now
the realities of my time
I can face clearly now
the devastation of the world

Looking at the dying sons
of your glorious past
fighting for freedom
shot to the head
gathered to beat the lord
gathered to destroy
gathered to take control
a new time has come

The more I see the world, the more I bleed
the more I see the world, the more I fear
see what we've done to the earth
see what we've done to the ground
see what we've done to the lands
see the forgotten fields

Don't look at me as if you don't know
look at me in the eyes and tell me I'm a liar
look at the revolution of your glorious people
standing for freedom, dying for peace
gathered to beat the lord
gathered to destroy
gathered to take control
a new time has come

Pay the tribute to the people
