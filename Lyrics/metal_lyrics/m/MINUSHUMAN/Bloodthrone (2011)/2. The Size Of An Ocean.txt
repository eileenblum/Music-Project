Free,
we are 
free,
in the shallows

Free
no redemption
to humankind 
free from our early condition
no redemption
no remorse, none
for what we've done
free from the weight of decision

Free,
we are
Free,
in the shallows

Free,
above what is and what will be
along the road to victory
shall it be written, shall it be done
we sold the world to the unknown

Enslaved to the ground
sons of humankind
have to face the wave
the sice of an ocean
