Evolve!
The world belongs to the strong

Breeding within itself
the paradox of life
as a king on a throne
reigning above all

We are all
part of it all
we are all
part of it all
take me down the hole

Evolve!
the world belongs to the strong

Alone within yourself
so many in your mind
as a fool on a throne
playing with us all

We are all
part of it all
we are the system
