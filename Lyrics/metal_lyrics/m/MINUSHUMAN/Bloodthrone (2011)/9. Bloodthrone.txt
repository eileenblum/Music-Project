You keep them away from the sun
in the torments of your fustration
you keep them away from the sky
to hear them repeat your lies

Bloodthrone
humiliation is their everyday
until they break away break away
Bloodthrone
mutilation is their everyday
until they break away, break away

You keep them away from their life
to protect and serve your fatherland
you keep them away from their rights
the stronger is always right

The world has lost
it's conscience, it's freedom
the world has lost
it's patience, it's confidence
the world, injured, disfigured, dismembered
