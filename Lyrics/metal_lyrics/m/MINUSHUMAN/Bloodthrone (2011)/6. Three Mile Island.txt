Built far from the eyes
on a cliff surrounded by a river
built high, confined
in a place nobody could find

Security is top priority
on three mile island
atomic facility
breeding the energy

Something went wrong
someone, somehow 
the heart broke out
and the fury has blown away

Irradiation began to spread
around the engines of the dead
eating cells as cancer
selling death to the poor
stealing life from everything
morbid visions of the troops of death
bringing hell to the surface
demons to the ground
devastation
atomic waste
the area will never be the same

And the heavens die again
and the shadows rise again
