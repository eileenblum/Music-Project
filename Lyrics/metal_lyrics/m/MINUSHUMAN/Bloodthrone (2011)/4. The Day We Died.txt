What will you do
when you have to choose
one has to die or it will be you

What will you do
when you have to face
the eyes of the man dying for you?

How many will die to save you?
How many broken fates to save you?
What will it be when it comes to your son
dying for you in a blood bath?

I never said I wanted to die
I never said I wanted to be alive
I never said I wanted to choose
the sun was bright the day we died

Pay! Pay!
The price of being alive
Pay! Pay!
The living memory of those you buried
Pay! Pay!
The price of being alive
Pay! Pay!
The left ones will hunt you down
