There is no light in sight
there is no light inside
there is no light in sight
at the end of the tunnel

I feel cold deep inside
like a whispering child
as the first wave fading
on the shore of my life

There is no light in sight
there is no light inside
I can feel myself fly
on a skyline of sorrow

Leaving myself behind
in the torments of time
as the first wave fading
on the shore of my life

Help me, kill me, farewell
fade to the black
