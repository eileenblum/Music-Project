Within the entrails of the earth
within the flesh of our cradle
within the pressure in my veins
within the core

Cause we are all, part of the game
cause we are all, part of the same
within me, within you, within us all

Digging the grave of our fathers
holding the ground within my hands

Shelving the bodies in the sand
under the sun we all bend

Cause we are all, part of the game
cause we are all, part of the same game

The code of the natural
the core of the natural
is part of another all

The voice of angles, all
the core of angels, all
is part of another all
