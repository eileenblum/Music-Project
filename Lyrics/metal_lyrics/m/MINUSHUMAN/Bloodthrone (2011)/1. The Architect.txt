Infected generation born under crucifixion

Devoted desperation,
As an engine of destruction

Fantasies of salvation
Turn children into weapons
Intoxication
Mind pollution
Perversion of inception

The creation, from it all
made the sunshine and the rivers flow

We made the architect arise
to feed the demon bred inside
We made the architect arise
open your eyes to who you are
open your eyes

Powers of malnutrition
Powers of domination over the weakness
is priceless
for those who keep the holy grail.
