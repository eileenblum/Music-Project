Why did everybody lie
Why did everybody cry
in the haze

Why did everybody lie
Why did everybody die
I can feel my body die

I can feel my body fly in the haze
I can feel my only soul
I can feel my own shadow

Is this a dream I'm walking in?
what is this feeling telling me
I can feel my hands bleeding me
I can feel my hands burning me
I can feel water around me
Is this a dream I'm dying in?
there is no one to help me out
what is this feeling telling me
I can feel my hands bleeding you
is this a dream, is this for real
I can feel my hands beating you
I can feel fire burning you

It's time to hear the silence
it's time to hear the call
it's time to hear the sickness

It's time to be, to live, godspeed
is this a dream I'm killing in?

Did I really make it, real?
is this a dream I'm living in?
or a projection of my faith
