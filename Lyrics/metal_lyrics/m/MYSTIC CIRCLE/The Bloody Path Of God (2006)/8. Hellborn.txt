Born under Satan's protection
The fire of hell in the eyes
Eyes as dark as the night
Black magic on his side

The picture of evil
The shadows of power
The spirit of damnation
The agony of pain

Circle of snakes
Shadow of death
Orgies of destruction
Hounds of hell escort you

Hellborn the path of destruction
Hellborn in the face of fire
Hellborn against the light
Hellborn the cradle of terror

Born in the heart of evil
In the care of the undead souls
The adversaries are fought
In the name of the inverted cross

The hands of the unclean touch you
Pull you in the current of madness
The church of the Christians is desecrated
Orgies of lust and pain
