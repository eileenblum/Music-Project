They are the forgotten
They walk the path of enlightement
Science versus religion
Persecuted for centuries

They hate the church
In the sign of Satan
The all-seeing eye
Will show them the way

They are the forgotten
Ready for the fight
They are the forgotten
Their time will come

Hunted by the church
Adversaries of it's lies
They arm in the underground
For the final battle

All their works were destroyed
All their knowledge tried to erase
The order of the illuminati
Will rise up again

They are the forgotten
The arky against god
They are the forgotten
Bringing church to it's end
