The end is near
The time has come
Like the old writings have foretold
The words of the scholars are tue

The sign of death
The marking of the plague
The angel death
The cry of fear

Doomsday prophecy

The shadows of wings
Cover the land
Fires of hell
Will devour everything

The great monster will appear
It's steps tremble merciless
The stars fall from the heavens
Thunder as loud as the big bang

Doomsday prophecy

Smash the world
Destroy of light
Cries of madness
Chaos begins
