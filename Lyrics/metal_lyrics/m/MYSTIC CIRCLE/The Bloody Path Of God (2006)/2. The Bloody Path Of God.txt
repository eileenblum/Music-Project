We are not the children of Jesus Christ
We are not the children of Christianity
We are not the children of the holy light
We are not the children of an impotent god

Oppression and hatred are your strengths
Lies and greed give you power

The bloody path of god

We are not the sons of the holy scripture
We are not the disciples of your sect
We are not the believers of your words
We are not the sinners of your laws

Defilement of ancient cultures
Gives you satisfaction
2000 years
You play with fear
