The water discolored itself to red
Rivers filled with blood
The sky darkened
God left the people alone

Frogs the harbinger of the plague
The stench of decay and dirt
Mosquitoes bring the lumps
Dogflys lay their eggs in the wounds

The last days
The end of the world
The wrath of god
In the shadow of the devil

Nine plagues of Egypt
The end of the world
Nine plagues of Egypt
Destroy the humankind
Nine plagues of Egypt
Punishment for their sins
Nine plagues of Egypt
The image of the devil

The pestilence reaches the cattle
Food is infested
Ulcers the signs of death
The suffering has begun

Out of the gorge of heaven
Where once the sun had it's place
Hail destroys the fields
A cloud of locusts are closing in
