Gods holy places
Will be desecrated
The mourning will arise
The realm of Christianity
Will succumb
The last hours of the world

The bell of death will sound
It is the sign of the last fight
A multitude of warriors
Wait for the command

He's the lord of darkness
He will ride a jackal
The ground will open up
And out of hell he'll step

Unholy terror
Will follow you
Through the deepest night
Unholy terror
The dictatorship
Of church will fall
Unholy terror
Sends the warriors
Of retribution to you
Unholy terror
A bloodbath
That will
Annihilate the Christians

A call to arms will sound
A cry of infinite might be drums
Make everything shatter
The holy cross will fall

7 deadly sins they will commit
They will betray their god
Greed and hatred will lead them
Rage and lust will spread

Unholy terror
Will follow you
Through the deepest night
Unholy terror
The dictatorship
Of church will fall
Unholy terror
Sends the warriors
Of retribution to you
Unholy terror
A bloodbath
That will
Annihilate the Christians

Unholy terror
Squadron of damnation
Unholy terror
The holy temples are burnt now
Unholy terror
Believers break apart
Unholy terror
The divine of Satan emerges
