Dark rituals at a place of horror
In Satan's name sacrifices were made
On an altar of the dark side
On the eighth day god created hell

Church of sacrifice
Reeks of pestilence and death
Church of sacrifice
The victim's flow of blood will cease
Church of sacrifice
Reeks of medley and decay
Church of sacrifice
In the name of the anti-god

The skies will burn
The sign of evil
The garden of eden
Will turn to dust

Church of sacrifice
Reeks of pestilence and death
Church of sacrifice
The victim's flow of blood will cease
Church of sacrifice
Reeks of medley and decay
Church of sacrifice
In the name of the anti-god

The lies in the name of the church
They have been uncovered all
The demon lives among us
And feeds on the souls of the damned

A battlefield of sin
Everything is soaked with blood
The last war
Between angels and demons
