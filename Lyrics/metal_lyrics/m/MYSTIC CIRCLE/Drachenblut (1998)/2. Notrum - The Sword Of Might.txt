In a castle of Xanten he lived
the king of the Netherlands
with his wife and son
who's name was Siegfried
his greatest wish was to go out
and have adventure and war
it was so boring for him
a hero he wanted to be

His father wants him to aduce
knightinnes virtues
but all his strenght and will
could not blind from false behaviour
so he sended him out
to a smith called Mimer
the smith should make him a man
and a future king

[Father of Siegfried (Sigmund) speaks:]
"My son you go with master Mimer
he should treat you like a common apprentice
and such hard work I hope will quit you
and form your mind to a bride knight".

and in the dark of the force
where he only heard hammer and anvil
many stories where told
about a dragons called Fafnir.

[Siegfried speaks:]
"No one has conquert this dragon so far
it menaces the whole land
but I will go out and defeat him
and then I have my fathers bright".

In the night he made a sword harder than the steal
an armour and a shield to stand against the evil
with the strenght of the bear
and broudly like a knight
he walked in that night away from master Mimer

then he stood in the darkness
put on his glamourous armour
with only one thought in his mind
to defeat the old dragon
a vision of the great king
he had in that night
now he's in the world of great adventures and war

Suddenly he heard a noise
someone has followed him
and as he looked behind him
a knife shines in the night
someone from the smith
would killed him from behind
but with his sword he turned up his head

and he went to the dragonstone
