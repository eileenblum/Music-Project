[Alberich:]
"I'm the king of the Blackalbs, Alberich is my name
since thousand years I hold the treasure in my hands
but you can't see me cause a magic hood is on my head
come join my realm but beware or you're soon dead".

As Siegfried stood in front of the gate
he saw twelve mighty keepers
and he knows behind that door, must be the Nibelungenhord
then he met two kings of them Schilbung and Nibelung
this two kings were in a fight whose the treasures owner.

Then the kings had killed themselves their blood laid on the ground
and Siegfried took the sword Balmur to lead the kings as their new king
the dwarfs had watched the whole happening
and in the mountain they told Alberich,

"Master of the blackening world out there is a new king
he had killed the former lords now he wants the treasure
you have sworn until you dead to defense all areas
now go out and fight him with your magic hood".

suddenly Siegfried felt pain someone is punching at him
but he can't see someone here angry he fights with Balmur
then something was in his hand the magic hood in his own
and a creature he saw Alberich stared at his eyes.

[Alberich:]
"please my master let me live your slave I will be
the treasure of the Nibelungen I give to you for free
but in Island is another enemy for you
Brunhild is her name and she's undefeaded".

[Brunhilde:]
"I'm the daughter Odins with the warrior soul
thousand came to reach my heard but no one get the chance
three competitions you must win and then I'm yours
but when you lose your condemned soul is mine".

Siegfried told his knights to built a ship of war -
with Alberich his on the way to Island
to face another victory and an unknown adventure
and to defeat the proud of Brunhild.
