With his armour sword and shield
he walked through the night
and in the light of the moon
he shines like a warrior
he walked till the break of dawn
and above his head
the dragonstone was ahead
dark and threatening

on his way he saw a wagon
with a farmers family
he told the man full of pugnacity
what's in his mind
that he wants to free the land
from the plague and pain
and from the smell of sulfur
the fire and the dead

[Farmer:]
"Take the horse that came yesterday it's former owner is dead
as you he would kill Fafnir but he wasn't an opponent
he dies in the flames of hell no scream were heard that night
the Lindworm is undefeated and someday he will destroy us".

with the dead behind he rides through a former happy land
now destruction and fear in his eyes
darkest feelings in his mind, then he saw a ravine where
all his live would end or glory will begin.

the dragonslayer

then he saw the head of the dragon looking in his eyes
bones of soldiers who had died in the battle of dead
it's mouth was opened wide and the fire burned to take his soul
but with Notrum the magic sword he will fight until his dead.

and then the battle began
Siegfried fought hard like a dog of the war
and with the last strenght he had
the sword runs into the dragons heard

[Fafnir:]
"From which tribe you come, who'd painted my hard red
the dark steel is in me and burns my soul
your sword was stronger, I'm defeated
it's live must Fafnir leave now and forever".

As the dragon lived no more
Siegfried felt it's blood
it was like a second skin
where no steel came through
so he put his body in the sea of blood
but a lime-tree leaf felt on his back

on that little place on the back
he wasn't safe
against the steel of the enemies
he must face in future life
there was silence in the land
and he put his weapons on
to tell his father what he'd done and to get his respect.

After a while he left Xanten
visit other foreign lands
and he came to a realm called Nibelungen
he heard from big treasures there
which were safed by dwarfs and giants
but his mind reached out for the Nibelungenhord
