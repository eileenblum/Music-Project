Born with the grace of Odin
inside the blood of the warrior
he was the lonesome hero
and a fighter of king Gunther
black was his armour
his sword was faster than winds
under the sign of the falcon
he beats every enemy

one eye in his head that shows
how many fights he had
and the long scare in his face
that shows how he was injured.
his home in the higher north
is a place called Tronje
and his gloomy castle is behind storms and ice cold winds

the one and only love he had
was the beauty Kriemhild
he had sworn to fight for her
and to give his live

with Brunhild he made a bound
against the holy Xanten king
and at the right time he should kill
the dragonslayer

but there were other sides in his life
we talk about
he were a proud knight
many victories he had
in his whole life
and no one could destroy Hagens heart
in a fight he was to strong
all the strenght that he had
was from Odin
and to him he prayed until he died.

in the name of Wotan 
Hagens soul was fighting
on his blackened horse 
he rides till he dies
Ever on the search 
of the sin of live
no quite moments 
a traveller he was
ever on a journey 
find a love of live
but his destiny was 
ever to stay alone

[Hagen:]
"Oh father Odin
take my soul up high
when I'm dead and gone
I'll sit in the walls of Wallhall
