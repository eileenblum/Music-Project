As the festivals were over
a double wedding were at the cathedral
Siegfried married his Kriemhilde,
Gunther married Brunhilde
but this bound before their god
was under a terrible omen.
Brunhilds eyes were colder
and her only thoughts were revenge

then an advice came
the king of Denmark wants war
with bounded king LÃ¼deger
who was the great king of Sachsen
Gunther was faced with sorrow
but Siegfried spoke to him
that they should fight the war
and took the kingdoms both

an army of 1000 man rides the Burgunds
and the Nibelungen knights
on Siegfrieds side were Hagen Von Tronje
and behind them the bravest warriors.

as the bloody war began there were no prisoners made
king of Denmark were soon dead
and the king of Sachsen too.
with this triumph Siegfried went to his wife

they went back to Netherlands cause his mother died
Siegfried get the crown from his father Siegmund
he was the new king noble and righteous
and for many years they lived full of peace

far away at Worms
there were someone who hadn't forget
years of hate and thoughts of death
were in Brunhilds mind

but she had a plan inside day of revenge is near
she would never be the queen on king Gunthers side
in the night she spoke to Hagen about Siegfrieds death
at the feast on solstice it should be.

[Hagen:]
"with the steel of Odins might
I will kill him at his back
there's only one little place
Siegfrieds blood will run out
Gunther must give an invitation
To Siegfried and his wife
they should come to Worms at the day of solstice".

Brunhild talked to her man Gunther
that she would see Kriemhild again
she should come to visit Worms
with her husband and her courtyard
and they send a messenger out
to the Netherlands to Xanten
he should spread the news of
the feast and that they come fast.

As Kriemhild heard from the feast
she was very happy
and she told her man
that they move over now
so a few weeks later
the whole baggage came to Worms
not knowing in their minds
that it was the last chapter
