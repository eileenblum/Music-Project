But Hagen was faster
he told Alberich to carrie the treasure to Worms
and in the night he put the whole treasure on the Rhein
and gave it to the Mermaids

I can't tell you further what was going on
I only knew that woman and man were crying

so many proud knights they found early dead
this is the end of the legend

the Nibelungendistress!
