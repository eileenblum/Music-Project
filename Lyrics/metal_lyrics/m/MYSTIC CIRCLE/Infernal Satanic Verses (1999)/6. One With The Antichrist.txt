We are one with the Antichrist
We are one with our master Satan
Have your ever seen the darkened eyes
And the flames of immortal power

In the deeps of hell we arise
And we came to destroy christianity
By our side unholy armies will ride
And Satans kingdom is built soon

In the desert where all deamons came out
Five of Satans lightkillers were born to destroy
In the name of Satan they were pointet as snakes
And they saw all the christians
As their enemies
For a dream of a new dawn where no light exist and a
New regime of the unholy is built
In the sign of Satan they were ready to fight with their weapons
Who where the sword and the flame

You'll die

Five crooked grosses they bounded their way with the hell
Unholy curses they bounded their way with the dead

And in the silence of desertly lounliness
Prayings to Luzifer and to his ghost
And in the lounliness of desert storms and winds
Rituals to the godfather's is done

Oh belial save out trip and mission
Fron his tormenting christians
We know that the last battle is near and we must
Built our reich again

From the stars a helldog came lead all their souls into the lies
It were the master of their dreams manipulated in their brain
From hell arise the whole deamons eating dead bodys on the graves
Fortune and dead is in their veins suffer and pain in their souls

We are the serpants of unholy time
The true deadbelievers of eternity

"Seven sins the devils will
the serpants shell arise"

In the night all sadistic souls came to bring their
Pleasures to unholy spirits
And they will fight
Put their lives for a Satans work and they built
Invasions of the Armageddon
And they will fight

Races will die and the blood all will flow
Feeling the evil inside
Lords of destructions will guide us the way
All for our brothers of lust will be sinned

The fallen one had won the battle religions are destroyed
A new race for the evil god will stand for it's own victory
