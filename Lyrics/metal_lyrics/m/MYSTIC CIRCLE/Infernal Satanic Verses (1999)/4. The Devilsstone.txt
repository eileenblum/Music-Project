One night the sisters of blackening witchcraft
Ceremonied another fast
The legions of satan were on their shoulders and a
Bloody sabbath begun

A darkened night of the devilstone it's calling they are hears
Witches from the area came that night for unholy sins

The prince of hell sit on his throne two deamons on his side
In his made was sweet toung lust for the whores of hell

And they flew on their besoms
In extasy they went wild
And their magic spread the forest
A magic place the devilstone

Bloody rituals they had done
Curses for the unbelievers
Sperm were drunk and lesbian sex
Their tongues were hungry and they spoke

"We denie the words of god
And his impotent son
The father of unholiness
Will serve till death"

An they spit on holy crosses
And they danced in extasy
In the moonlight you hear screams
From the other dimension

We denie the holy cross
Burn our souls in hell
Prince of darkness stands by us
Holy kingdom should decay

Black wedding we spoken in that night
Fucked with all around with devilwhores
Witches were turning all around
And they sucked all the sperm of them

Hundrets of curses against God
Praises for Satan you could hear
Honour for thousand deamons came
And they would save them in the night

In the name of Satan
We give him all our souls
And we spead the evil words
For his mighty kingdom
All don at the devilstone
A ritual in that night
Father Satan save that place
For eternity

Black wedding we spoken in that night
Fucked with all around with devilwhores
Witches were turning all around
And they sucked all the sperm of them
