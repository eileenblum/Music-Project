One day in the deeps of hell deamons will break out
Master Satan said to them they should built on armee
Sender from the underworld to the mankind of earth
They should use all human souls for the legions of death

A dark heaven built their way
As the crow from hell
Thousands of pure evil ghosts
Take the innocent souls

A dark image built their way
As the crow from hell
Thousands of sadistic ghosts
Against christianity

Seek and destroy the evil is in
My body is ready to fight

Black legions raise to built a kingdom of pure evil
Sadistik ghosts take us all to fight against god
Black legions rise a nightof darkness and obsession
The gods of death are ready to create a new begin

In the shadows of the night we'll tear their souls apart
And we spent the christian blood use it four our rituals

This night full of victory
Satan will come to earth
Black legions guide it's way
Christians are slaves on earth

Dreams of whole destructions
Fullfill my eyes with death
Delievering of Satans orders
The armee will follow him blind

And one the second day
The legions has won the war
Broken the walls of the holy church
Built a new one of dark

Satan came and saw
With proud that he had won

Proud fullfills my bodys
All my warriors had won
Without that fucking god
We have the hell on earth

And on the second day
The legions has won the war
Broken the walls of the unholy church
Built a new one of dark
