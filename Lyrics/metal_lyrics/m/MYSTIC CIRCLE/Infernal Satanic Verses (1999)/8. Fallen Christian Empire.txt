"I'm the fallen angel"

Brought a piece of evil sins
Almighty I will be
In the son of Satan
Carrier of all evil

You also call me Antichrist
I come these days on earth
Ready for the last battle
With your impotent god

At the end of all time a new imperator came
It's the dawn of a new age ist the time for Satans call

For it's call

I'm the great beast and my eyes are full of flames
A mirror full of hate against christianity
My mother is a jakal she had borned me a dark night
Thousand deamons came to save my darkened soul

"I stoped the opening of the holy grave and fucked Jesus soul"

After the beasts awakening the islam will be destroyed
After a sleep of hundred years the beast will rule the world
We adore the undefeadeble one
He rules the fucking world for Satan

The armie of the crooked gross has reached the walls Jerusalem
The shadow of the deamonsraise above their heads and guide their way

The day of the apokalypse will come
The seal of the darkened power
The reign of the Antichrist is near
And the one who gave us the power

Look the day is coming followers went to him
Spread your wings we believe follwers went to him
Antichrist is coming followers went to him
We are one the last days fallen christian empire

Fly on demonic wings th find the christian brood
Legions of dark warriors find their way from hell
We are on the last battle all of the has lost
A new regime will be built under the sign of evil
