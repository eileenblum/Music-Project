Even now he's in the world
And his power shall be mighty
And he shall prosper and be strong
And shall destroy the mighty and the holy

Burn under the protection of Satan
He was put into the world of the Christians
In the belly of a jackal that is his mother
Through his veins there flows powerful blood
He is the bringer of death
Who was prophesized by the old myths

His power will grow stronger
And he will bring about the end of the world
Through his eyes you can see the fires of hell
Beneath his hair lies the mark of the devil

On the 6th day
Of the 6th month
On the 6th hour he was born

He carries the mark of the devil
To bring about the end
The last revelation 666

Born with the mask of perdition
He represents everything that's bad in the world
In the garment of innocence
He waits for his coronation
To everyone who poses a threat horrible things happen
He gives the faithless a final proof of his existence

Only few know his true identity
The more he grows up, the more powerful he gets
But he's not alone in this world
His fellowship grows year by year

"With his black wings he will rise above the earth to reign
The dark power will spread around his Kingdom of Terror"
