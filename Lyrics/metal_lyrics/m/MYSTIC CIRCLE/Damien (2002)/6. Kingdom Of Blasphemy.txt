Dark clouds rise as the blessed one had killed his parents
Under the care of his uncle he now learns the system of the war
He suspects what powers are within him
And that he will be the bringer of a new age

Slowly grows the kingdom of blasphemy
The new order has begun
Slowly spreads the kingdom of blasphemy
The large storm is brewing

In his heart he holds the will of destruction
It is set free more and more
Ready to extinguish everything that's holy
He will bury of that stands in his way to build his throne

Fire will burn into their limbs
And death will prevail
The creatures of hell
The demons of earth
The servants of the night
Performing bloody deeds
To carry him to the top

"I am the chosen one born to reign the empire of the Christians will
disintegrate and the world will fall to darkness those who follow me will
experience pleasures my adversaries will die they will suffer eternal
agonies
burning in my fathers flames"

The antichrist is among us driven by
His greed holy ground

And God's child is his fear
The only thing that can him kill are the seven daggers
But the seven chosen ones fail to destroy him
