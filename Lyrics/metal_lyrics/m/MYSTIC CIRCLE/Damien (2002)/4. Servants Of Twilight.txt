The prince of the darkness sent out his servants
To protect the son of darkness
They resemble man and beast and will risk their lives for him
Within their souls dwells the demonic
They are meant for their master
See the blackness in their eyes
The light on earth will shine no more
Armies of ravens are on his side
No one can escape their spell
Beastly rottweiler in the shadow of the night
In their muzzles greed for holy blood
They are the servants of the twilight
Ready for the fight
They are the servants of the twilight
No one can hide
They are the servants of the twilight
They keep the Christians away
They are the servants of the twilight
To protect the unholy one

With the power of the dark evil
They will rear his kingdom
Many had to die as well as his family
From the mists of perdition
They play their games
The only purpose in their lives
Is to die for him

And in the shadow of the wolf he will come
The winds to become his weapons
He will tolerate no one beside him
So he will also murder his brother

The false prophets prepare the country for his rule
His energy is reflected in their bodies
The shouting of the raven lets the world stop in it's tracks
The barking of the gods lets everything shiver with fear
