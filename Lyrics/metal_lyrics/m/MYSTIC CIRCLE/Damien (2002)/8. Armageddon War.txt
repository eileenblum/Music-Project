God of silence
Hear his please
Your son begs you
To support him in the final Battle

God of darkness
Give him the power
To conquer the Good
To reign over it

Driven by visions the Antichrist destroys the christ
His army will be ready for the final battle
The Nazarene walks the earth and he is to be destroyed
Everyone of them is ready to die

They are ready for armageddon war
The kingdom of God against the underworld
They are ready for armageddon war
The holy son will die this very night

They moved out to kill the holy one
So the kingdom of the lawless
The joys of hell they want to bring about
There is no price they wouldn't pay
Driven by their greed and sexual lust

Every newborn child is killed
For they don't know who is the holy child
But his adversary survives even this night
The thorns of lies against the round dance of anger
One will be beaten but evil will live on

Paradise will never be
Lust and anarchy will reign
Paradise will never be
The reign of god will fade away
