The sky turns red
The flames get right
The dead will walk
The storms arise

This will be the end
The signs of the last days
This will be the time
When day turns into night
Everlasting shadows
Spread their wings above
Crawling creatures
Send from hell will kill
God is dead
Satan arise
God is dead
Satan arise

The serpent's awake
And twilight will follow
The rise of the dead
Will bring christ the end

This will be the day
When day turns into night
This will be the time the godless will rise
No one can stop them
From ending their work
A dimension of pain
Opens a new law

"God you have failed"
