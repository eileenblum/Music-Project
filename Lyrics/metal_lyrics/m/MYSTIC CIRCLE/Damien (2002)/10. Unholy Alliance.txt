Old writings foretell the demise of the world Satan will rise
And the final fight between good and evil will begin
The disciples of the antichrist gather together
They want to kill the child of god
Born of this night

The believers are seduced
Many newborn children die
Only with a single thought
To destroy the bringer of light
Cold and without grace
They will hunt him
And no God can protect him
He has lost his power

In the strubs of Hebron he is revealed
The master of stillness and insanity
Will fight the last battle for his final victory
And a thousand dragons will follow him

Unholy alliance
Built to destroy
The holy energy
Never will be
Unholy alliance
A new age has begun
Pleasures of hell
Are reality

The power of his father
Lets him become stronger
On the island of angels
His adversary is born
The believers will whimper
And pray to their god
But the holy father
Grants them no more protection

The believers are seduced
Many newborn children die
Only with a single thought
To destroy the bringer of light
Cold and without grace
They will hunt him
And no God can protect him
He has lost his power

"That kingdom of heaven is locked
The horns of the angels are calling to war
Swords will clash
The banished ones are seeking revenge against God"

A priest of the damned
For a world of sin
The eyes of darkness
With the power to kill
I will lead you into
A kingdom of joy
Everyone coming with me
Will receive eternal life
