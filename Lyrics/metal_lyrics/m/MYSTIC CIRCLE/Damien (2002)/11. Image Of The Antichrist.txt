He is the father of all sin
Of the highest desolation
Nevertheless the people long to embrace him
He will free the world of the second coming of Christ

2000 years of rulership are enough
His servants will experience the joys of hell
He is the God of Melancholy
The divinity of loneliness

The purity of evil he is
The paradise of pain he will bring
Hell does ot revel in the bowels of the earth
It is the sky of satan's ecstasy

Image of the antichrist
Image of the beast
Image of the antichrist
Image of the unholyness

"And it shall come to pass that in the end days
The beast shall reign unhundred score and thirty
Days and nights

And the faithful shall cry unto the lord:
Wherefore art thou in the day of evil?

And the lord shall hear their prayers
And out of the angel isle he shall bring fourth a deliever

A holy lamb of god who shall do battle with the beast
But not destroy him!!"

Born of a jackal his son descends
To suffocate the world of morality
To prevent the resurrection of the Nazarene
To establish lust and agony
