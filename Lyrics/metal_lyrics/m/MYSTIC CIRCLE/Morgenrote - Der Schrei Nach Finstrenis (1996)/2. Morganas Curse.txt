She had the witchcraft in her, wonderful she looked and smelled
Many years she studied magic from the black and white side
Morgana was her name she lived in a time of hate
And she was the victim of the holy inquisition

I'm the pudge and I'm chaching you, you're in bound with Satan
Your body shall burn in three days at the funeral pile

Then she swore damnation to gods creation
An unholy curse she made against all the christians
Morganas curse beware of her force
Morganas curse it will follow you

In the tower she now sit waiting for her execution
Males of pain on her body torchured by the law
Her beloved family and her man screamed for freedom
But her love brought her the news that she'll die soon

"Now you're at the step to death but I will follow you soon
With my death we'll be as one you know that love never die"

With no fear she went to death when the flames came
With no screams she looked at them and spoke the words of the curse
Morganas curse beware of her force
Morgana curse with her love she died

[Morgana:]
Damned are you for the whole time
My curse it follows you
Plague and torchure for your life
Illnes and despair

Damned your children and their wives
They are spastic victims
The hand of death will get them
They shall not grow old
