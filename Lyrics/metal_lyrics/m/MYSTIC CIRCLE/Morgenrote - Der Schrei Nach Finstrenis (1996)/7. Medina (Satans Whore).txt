She adorned to master and she went to be his slave
The sins of hell she wants to feel and the fire of the damned

In the night she gave her blood
And crossed the acheron
Then she stands at the gate
Waiting for the opening

[Satan:]
I'm your destiny - I show you things you're never seen
I'm your only dream - the leader of perverted things

She stands there with leatherclothes
Besides the throne of the night
Her hair is black and red lips
A whiplash in the right
Ready to do anything in his mighty kingdom
Fullfill his wishes because she is

Medina - whore of Satan

With her tongue she likes his dick to drink the honey from his phallus
With her fist she goes so deep in his wide opened anus
Her whiplash smashed on unholy flesh
Screams of lust and torture
The smell of death layed in the air, blood streams out of wounds

[Satan:]
You are my master whore - I give you all you want
You are my master whore - for all eternity

"The reich of pain is lust for you
the hell your castle now
come be my wife you have go through
the torture by your side
even the shadows are your friens
and darkness looks at you
come go with me until the end as light turnes far from you"
