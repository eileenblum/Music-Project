Spread your wings upon my mind and lead me far away
My undead soul that needs the fleash of thousands who decay
Seperate all feelings from me no love and no pain
Hypnoticed through your black eyes yor fire I will feel

Sailing on the wings of darkness on the raven wings
Everlasting in the shadows of the beast
Voices tell me what he wants and he wants the blood
From the human beings he must soak out

Went out all night find the victims in the shadows in the darkness
Seeking no light fear of mourning let me drink the juice of life

Ravens dusk here I come on my way to drink the blood
Ranens dusk I'm strong, an undead soul with a long long past
The coffin is my realm by day, the world my playground in the night
Won't you come to join the dead the one who brings eternal life

Leaded by the realm of darkness hell I bring on earth
A bloodsucked monster from the transilvanien front
I like to smell the dead from human bodies
Then I bite my teeth deep in it veins

Raise in the night out of my coffin
Ravens nature is on my side
Testimonies of my dark lust
Lead my body for fresh blood

Black like the raven wings that what we are
Warriors in the name of Satan
Black like the darkest sun we come
On the devils horse we ride
