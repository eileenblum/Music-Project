Autumn romantic lies ahead
The smell of winter is near
Your promises me eternal love
Princess of the night

I layed all my love for you
But you gave me nothing
A puppet on your side
Blinded by your false eyes
"I will love you forever my dear
hahaha you lie
I love you for all my life
No you fucking lie"

You spinned your arms around me
And you blinded my sad eyes
I run to you with open arms
But you gave me the knife

Octobermoon when we met
A night so clean and gold
Octobermoon was it love from you
Only the white stones knows

Now I know it was a fault
To praise my love to you
The only thing you really love
Is yourself and you

You will never know how much
You heard me in that time
But you'll get what you deserve
A never pieceful mind

"I will carry your child
hahaha you lie
you're the snake that bites me
no you fucking lie"

I'm not the yellow snake that is in your dreams
I'm the man who wants to save you
And your weird thoughts

Octobermoon is over now my life without you
Octobermoon all was a lie because the snakes is you

Now all is lost
You ain't no more
Promises are gone
Hate is what we had
Secrets that you gave me
I will never understand
Under the moon I know
You never stand by my side
