Alone in the mystic castle wind blows through the night
As I looked I saw a shadow leads me to the secret garden

"Follow me into my realm
I will show you lust and pain
Nothing will be like it was
I drink from you, you live forever"

The kiss from a vampire

Then she stands before my eyes
A vamp in black she look so good
And she took me in that night
Like no other could

"Oh you're so good to me
my blood runs out for you
eat my flesh and drink from me
the serpent is in you"

The kiss from a vampire

After that I was her slave
A human body in her force
She is my princess of the night
And I died for her

"Now you're dead, come follow me
my empire it should be yours
forget the past you're undead now
my leader you're my last"

The kiss from a vampire
