In the night of the dead as a storm comes out
The satanic sect hold a mess at the graves
As the highest priest speech came a thunder down
That was a sign from hell

[Priest:]
Satan takes this satisfices
It's a virgin young and bold
Long long time she waits for you
In her ineer thoughts

[Victim:]
Satan takes this satisfices
It's a virgin young and bold
Long long time she waits for you
In her ineer thoughts

Graveyard dreams lies ahead a stormy night of sacrifices
Graveyard dreams gave the dead strong and cold but
Warm inside
We lead you to the other side of heaven
We lead you to the other side of death

Then a five burned and the master came
The horned one stood inside
And the winds stood only heard it's voice
He was there and spoke to the priest

[Satan:]
Thank you for your sacrifices
Eternity belong to you
After life I take you with me
Then you heard her speach

[Victim:]
Satan takes this satisfices
I'm a virgin young and bold
Long long time she waits for you
In her ineer thoughts

"Follow me to the deepest grounds of hell
read the signs Armageddon is near"
"I'm the one you have choosen to bring the end
Jesus Christ no more
Hell will raise from the deepest grounds
Demons come and give them the dead"
