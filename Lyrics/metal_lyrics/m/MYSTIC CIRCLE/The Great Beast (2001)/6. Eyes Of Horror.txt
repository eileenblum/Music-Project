Peer into the eyes of horror
So dark and cold
Will follow you, till life has run out

Peer into the eyes of death
Playing with your fear
Trying to dishearten till the last step

You think you're strong, but feeble you are
Your narcism won't keep revenge at bay
You think you're smart can avoid it all
Your guillibility will make you vulnerable

Dark and cold are the eyes of horror
Sublime the claws of death
Mystic and dangerous the eyes of horror
Pulling you like a magnet

Look into the eyes of deceit
Their promise false, only want your soul for a perverted game
Look into the eyes of darkness, can you withstand?
Concealing the lust and the joy of hell

You say you're the greatest, but you're nothing
A wailing shadow without personality
You say you're brave, stand up and fight
The great war against the church lies ahead

Look into the eyes of greed, they promise much
Suck your blood till death creeps upon you
Look into the eyes of insanity, don't get to near
Don't get to near, they'll burn you faster than you can run

You think you're mighty, control is yours
Only a marionette in their game
You think you're sublime, no one can hurt you, they
breed you till desolation
