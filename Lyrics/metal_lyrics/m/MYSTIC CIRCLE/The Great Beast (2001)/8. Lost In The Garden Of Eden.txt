In an unknown place
God created paradise
A garden full of innocence
But evil moved in

Fallacy the beginning
Greed and lies the end
Eve took the apple
Spread by inner weakness

Satan sent the serpents
The human race was weak
And they ate the poisoned fruit
The lie was born

Lost in the garden of Eden
God's disciples fall prey to shame
Lost in the garden of Eden
The teachings of christ based upon a lie

In an unknown time
God lost another battle
Against his own angels
Whom he once damned

The fallen rear their face
To destroy his kingdom
And war raged on 
Worse than in any fantasy

Adam and Eve had shown us
The nature of mankind is bad
God in union with the serpent
Conducting an empire of lies

Lost...No heavens rule the land
Lost...The light of lies will blind us
Lost...Judgement day will damn them
Lost...The gates of hell will open
Lost...Slaves of hades they shall be
Lost...The once so hypocritical believers
