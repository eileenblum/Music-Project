Eyes so dark, skin so light
A breathtaking body she had
Ruby red lips, a soft pierced tongue
Her whole aura drove me mad

Thats how she peers at me
Her nails caress my skin
And she kissed my lips
The fire started to burn

Lost in her mind
Driven by the darkness
Feelings that I never had
She gave to me

I felt Lucifers angel deep in my soul
As she spread her black wings over my mind
I called lucifers angel in a mystical night
To satisfy my bizarre wishes

Her godlike curves shimmer in the fullmoonlight
Twitching bodies winding around each other

She looked determined at me
Ready for the last step
As we unite
Hellish visions awaken

The union remains
And she will return
To take me in the depths of hell
She will be mine

I felt the power of lucifers angel in my heart
She showed me unknown dimensions
I felt the passion of lucifers angel in that night
In an neverending orgasm of affection
