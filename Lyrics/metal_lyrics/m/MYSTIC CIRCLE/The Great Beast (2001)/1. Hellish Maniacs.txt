The end has begun day turns to night
Those devoted to darkness slowly arise from their graves
They are crawling around and seek the figures of light
To bring the shadows of the damned into their hearts

[Refrain:]
Hellish maniacs pure evil in person
Sold their souls to the devil
Hellish maniacs on the terrace of hell
Revolt against the earth

Valleys drenched in blood silent and peaceful
Singing of the birds long gone by
After live is deceased the vigor of suffering sets in
The thorns of their master have driven deep into their flesh

[Repeat refrain]

Pure evil, light haters, fallen angels, biblecrushers
Slaves of evil, no return, time has come. war is upon us
See the signs, everything come true, prophecy
arrives, Satan is near
Pain and sorrow, for those who do not follow, their
belief broken, all live will find an end

The origin of all evil has returned
The land is in his hands
Follow the crying of the souls
To forget the pain
