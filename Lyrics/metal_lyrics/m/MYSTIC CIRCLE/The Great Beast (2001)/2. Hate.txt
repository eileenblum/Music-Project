God said "let there be light" and darkness came
God said "Ye shall go to heaven" and hell broke loose
He sent false prophets the lie was born
Priests of greed and intrigue under the grab of the lord

The holy war commenced killed in the name of god
Abused human moroncy abduct the gold of our earth
Do you see the path of lies? They mislead you
Follow the sign of the serpent experience endless lust

Hate fo those who play hide and seek
Hate for you and your god
Hate fo all you christians you
you lie, deceive!

Hate for you, ceatures of cowardice
Hate for you and your mirror of light
Hate for everyone with a facade
You lie, deceive!

God said "you shall be free", enslaved only by him
God said "the sun will shine", but rain set in
Suppression and murder are real, only the strong
survive
Laws of unity 
Justice a mockery

Hell has arrived, only few can see
Liberated from the burden of god, no one before us
Prayers are worn out, no use for them
The sins shall be free, respect for the new doing

Hate for you
Hate for your lies
Hate for you
Hate for your intrigues
