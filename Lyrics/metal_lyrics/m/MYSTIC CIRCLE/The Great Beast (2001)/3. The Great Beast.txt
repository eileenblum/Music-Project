Ancient tales tell us of his return
Old shamens saw the deamons coming
Prophets had visions of legions from hell
Witches swore live long devotion

And now prophecies turned reality
The ghosts of the past reveal their faces
Fire will fall from the heavens
And the smoke of infinity will conquer earth

The great beast is behind us
Old tales come true
Like a storm falling on us
They will destroy everything

The great beast shall come upon earth
To take all souls
Hell will arrive and destroy wasteland
All the humans shall prevail

The great beast will appear
To show you the wiff of death
To bring the end of days
He shall kill all that was born

The great beast has you in his hand
Shall never release you
Squeezing ever harder
Till your last breath has come
