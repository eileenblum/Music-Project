Angels of Perdition are rising above
They come from the depths of the realm of death
With them the legions of locusts
They herald the monarchy of hell

Beyond the Black dawn â Resurrection of evil
Beyond the Black dawn â Firestorm breaks out
Beyond the Black dawn â Destroy the heavenly messengers
Beyond the Black dawn â Midget like demons bring perdition

The Masters of Disease swing their weapons
Gods of Darkness are coming with the storm
In the symbol of the snake they ride
The antagonists of holy creation

[Refrain]
Beyond the Black dawn â They are the kings of hell
Beyond the Black dawn â They will lie to seduce
Beyond the Black dawn â Dragons will rise
Beyond the Black dawn â And rip their bodies apart

The black monster will appear
On a throne made of human bones
His horns are his crown
Carried by the ghouls of the deep

Beyond the Black dawn â Resurrection of evil
Beyond the Black dawn â Firestorm breaks out
Beyond the Black dawn â Destroy the heavenly messengers
Beyond the Black dawn â Midget like demons bring perdition

Beyond the Black dawn
Beyond the Black dawn
Beyond the Black dawn
Beyond the Black dawn
