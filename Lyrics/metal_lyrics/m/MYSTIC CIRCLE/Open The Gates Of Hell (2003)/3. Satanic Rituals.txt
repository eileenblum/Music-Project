A mystic full moon shines from the sky
Dark clouds obscure his light
The night of invocation has come
Priests of darkness are gathering

[Refrain]
Satanic rituals
In the name of Satan
Satanic rituals
To get closer to hell

The place is surrounded by ancient stones
Those have gathered the energy of evil
In the center burns a black flame
Symbols of darkness are drawn

[Refrain]
Satanic rituals
To call the spirits
Satanic rituals
To conjure up the unholy power

They have tasted the flesh of fallen angels
They have tasted the devils black blood
They have seen beyond the world of skin
The architecture of blood and bones and marrow

A mystic full moon shines from the sky
Dark clouds obscure his light
The night of invocation has come
Priests of darkness are gathering

Satanic rituals
In the name of Satan
Satanic rituals
To get closer to hell

To hell
To hell
To hell
