Unholy voices call his name
The dead will rise again
Demons creep out of the fangs of hell
To seek revenge for Satan

Spirits of dead
Dancing shadows
Children of the night
Strange symbols
Priests of madness
Armies of devils bring perdition

Open the gates of hell
Give birth to the region of evil
Open the gates of hell
Open the door to the underworld
Open the gates of hell

Lightning and thunder are the signs
They sky is soaked in blood
The lamentations of the gods youï¿½ll hear
Hades spreads his wings

Legions of darkness Howling wolves
Armies of snakes will kill
Wizards of evil Demon warriors
The bringer of light will appear

Open the gates of hell
Give birth to the region of evil
Open the gates of hell
Open the door to the underworld
Open the gates of hell

Black abyss is opening up
They jump in in ecstasy
The realm of hell will swallow them
A thousand torments they will suffer

Open the gates of hell
Give birth to the region of evil
Open the gates of hell
Open the door to the underworld
Open the gates of hell

Open the gates of hell
Open the gates of hell
Open the gates of hell
Open the gates
