The chamber of terror
The chamber of fear
Caught in the dark
To infiniteness

Lost in purgatory
In the world of death
Burning for their sins
And no one will save them

The front court to the underworld
Is the gates to hell
But the damned get not allow to enter
Only the pain of the black flames

Burning souls caught forever
Burning souls will scream forever
Burning souls always feel the pain
Burning souls in the twilight of darkness

The chamber of terror
The chamber of fear
Caught in the dark
To infiniteness

In the hour of death
When demons took my soul
There was no tunnel of light
Darkness dragged me further down

The front court to the underworld
Is the gates to hell
But the damned get not allow to enter
Only the pain of the black flames

Burning souls caught forever
Burning souls will scream forever
Burning souls always feel the pain
Burning souls in the twilight of darkness

The front court to the underworld
Is the gates to hell
But the damned get not allow to enter
Only the pain of the black flames

Burning souls caught forever
Burning souls will scream forever
Burning souls always feel the pain
Burning souls in the twilight of darkness
