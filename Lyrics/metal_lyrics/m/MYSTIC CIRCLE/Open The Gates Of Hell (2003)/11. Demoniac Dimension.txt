They are the guardians of light
In the temple of the damned
They are possessed by demons
In the shadow of madness

It is the hell's dimension
To rip out your soul
Its hells dimension
They will come to get you

Demoniac dimension

Demoniac dimension

Caught in the flames of damnation
The screams of oppressed souls
Crucified bodies under the sign of Satan
Impaled bodies scream for mercy

It is the hell's dimension
To rip out your soul
Its hells dimension
They will come to get you

They are the guardians of light
In the temple of the damned

In the shadow of madness

It is the hell's dimension
To rip out your soul
Its hells dimension
They will come to get you
