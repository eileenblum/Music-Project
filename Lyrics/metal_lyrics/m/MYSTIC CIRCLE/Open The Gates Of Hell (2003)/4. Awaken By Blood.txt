The gorge of hell is open
Creatures of darkness rush out
The suffering has begun
They thirst for human flesh

The agony of lust they'll suffer
Their souls shall be damned
The vortex of darkness tears them along
Into the garden of seduction

Awaken by blood
Demons arrive
Awaken by blood
The souls of the dead scream
Awaken by blood
The fires of hell
Awaken by blood
The storms of madness arise

The gorge of hell is open
Creatures of darkness rush out
The suffering has begun
They thirst for human flesh

The agony of lust they'll suffer
Their souls shall be damned
The vortex of darkness tears them along
Into the garden of seduction

Awaken by blood
Demons arrive
Awaken by blood
The souls of the dead scream
Awaken by blood
The fires of hell
Awaken by blood
The storms of madness arise

Awaken by blood
Demons arrive
Awaken by blood
The souls of the dead scream
Awaken by blood
The fires of hell
Awaken by blood
The storms of madness arise
