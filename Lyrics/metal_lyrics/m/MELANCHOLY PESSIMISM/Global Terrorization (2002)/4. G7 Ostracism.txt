The richest people from the woeld,
They'd like to decree without us.
Prague, Rome and Los Angeles
were places of the summits.

Is this planet for the rich only?
Why does only one side arbitrate?

Where are the representatives
of the other people and communities?
It's a scorn on humanity.
Nobody wants to listen to the
voice of the habitants of this star.

Strikes and disagreements.
Fights and disturbances.
Blood and barricades.
Flames and broken glass.

We want to speak about our lives
will you listen to us?
So kill us! Kill us! Kill us!
You've a lot of money for guns.
