All the world is aghast.
Hell on earth is unleashed.
Devil's smoke and flames are everywhere.
Thousands of innocent people inside
the madness,
They try to get away, they run over
each other.
The giant buildings are falling down
and all is buried in the debris and dust.

Happy faces are changed into 
hatred and crying.
Peace and contentmentare turned into
fear of war over the whole wide world.

The attack on democracy unites all
countries and
nations for war against evil.
When negotiations are collapsing
it is the time for revenge.

Violence against violence.
Hate against hate.

We are building the peace
on our evil planet earth
with the help of arms, bombs and anthrax.
