Listen! So listen to the news!
A next affair is here.
We have hot news, so true facts
about politicians and their parties.
With the covert support of reign and
power.
Does massmedia really work for the
public?
They twist slickly the truth and
they control the masses and quietly
manipulate the voters.

The massmedia control
The massmedia lies

One statesman attended a bizarre sex club.
A second senator smoked pot 
20 years ago, but he didn't know that
it was grass?

Vote, vote, vote!
Vote for the shit, vote for the liars,
only they are the best.

We are an independent journal,
we are the true tv, we are here for you.
We also have the pictures from a holiday
where also the president have been together
with a prostitute. They work for political
parties and they accept millions from them
for guaranteed news and lies.
