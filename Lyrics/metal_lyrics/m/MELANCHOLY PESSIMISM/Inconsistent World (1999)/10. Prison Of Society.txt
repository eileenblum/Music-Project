Pushed to the wall
Then one stroke after another
Living in submission against your will
Spoil the dream of demokracy to those in power
Fight of survival tights up your hands.
Do only whatcha want - fuck what they say.
Resposebility adn conscience are like handcuffs.
And if you don't get rid off it you will die hand cuffed.
Fight of survival tights up your hands.
Do only whatcha want - fuck what they say.
If you wanna stay alive -you gotta save yourself
Get away with what you got and care just for yourself
Don't be a prisoner of society where those in power
Don't give a flying about you.
