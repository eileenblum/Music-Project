Solitude feeding on my brain
It hurts more and more
I hate everybody, I hate myself.
Prowling around city that I used to love
Runnin into people that I used to love
Now I want to destroy everything
And kill everybody.
I can hear my inner voice saying:
Cut this off and be yourself again.
My head is full of bad memories
I want to forget all
and think of the good ones. But a dead brain can't think of anything. Do I ever find myself?
I can hear my inner voice saying:
Stop this and be yourself again.
Solitude feeding on my brain
It hurts more and more.
My hatred to you!
My hatred to all!
Runnin into people that I used to love
Now I want to destroy everything
And kill everybody.
