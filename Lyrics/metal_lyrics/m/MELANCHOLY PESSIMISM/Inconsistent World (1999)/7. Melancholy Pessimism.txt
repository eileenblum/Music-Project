Without money, without love
Alone for every annoying yourself
You have tryied to reach something up.
Melancholy pessimism.
It's a long, long suffering for you
You wanted many times - to end your life
However you've never done it, ever.
You're just a cower who(ve never reached
anything, ever.
You are running, you are decided
To die anyway, life is just a pain.
You don't wanna suffer yourself anymore
The only what you got in your head is a suicide
Melancholy pessimism.
Your neck is clenching.
You're pulling up or sleeve
It take just a second
Jugulating your veins
Falling into agony
Can't feel your dripping blood
You will never live through it
what is a depressive feeling
Melancholy pessimism.
