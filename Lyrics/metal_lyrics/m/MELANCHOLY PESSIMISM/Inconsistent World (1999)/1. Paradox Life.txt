Ain't nothing to eat
Ain't nowhere to stay
Ain't strenght to wake up
Ain't nobody around.
Luxurious cars and huge estates
Swimming pools and cheerful faces
Full stomaches and safes packed to the top
And no conscience...and...bloody hands!
Scent of grill and stink of trashcans
Shiny cars and filthy rags
Baroque music and ultimate heartbeat
Joy, happiness - sadness
Laughter - cry
Live - die
Is this the beautiful life?
Is this the world of justice?
