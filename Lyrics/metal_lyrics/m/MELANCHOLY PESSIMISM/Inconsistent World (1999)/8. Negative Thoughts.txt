The world where the evil rules
The world where negative is positive
Filth and scum are the icons of purity.
Wasting time searching for feel of security.
Naivity knocked you down
Evil thoughts manipulate you
Life is hard - so fight!
Search where you haven't found anything
negative feelings dimminish your sight.
Life is hard - so fight!
Naivity knocked you down
Evil thoughts manipulate you.
Don't let your surrounding where evil rules to manipulate you
When world is dirty and environs is ill
Stay upright forever
When life is hard - so fight!
