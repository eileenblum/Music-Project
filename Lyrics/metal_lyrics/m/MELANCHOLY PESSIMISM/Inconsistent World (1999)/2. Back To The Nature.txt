Hectic way of life
Machines and computers make our brains blocked
Let's get back to nature
Let's get back to our lifes.
Rediscover love, let's go to paradise
It's fast breeding, it's fast growing
That's fast extinction of brain.
Breeding, growing - dying
Clothings and properties
turn us into enemies.
Is there anything to envy
on a naked human body?
We destroy everything around us
only for our own mammon
Stop - let's get back up in the trees!
Back to human being
Let's get back to nature
Back to human lifes.
It's fast breeding, it's fast growing
That's fast extinction of brain.
Breeding, growing - dying
