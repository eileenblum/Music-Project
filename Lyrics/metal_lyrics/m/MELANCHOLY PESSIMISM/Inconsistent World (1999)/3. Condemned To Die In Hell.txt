Loneliness - covered in clouds of sorrow
Grief - irritating the corpse of your feelings
Your mind out of control
and your head like a desolated light house.
All alone and naked in a polar desert
You can't feel xarmth nor cold.
Condemned to die in hell
Your heart is desperate for little piece of feelings
Your brain is begging
for a trace of hope...
All my efforts came out
like a waste of time.
Hopelessness and frustration
to end this life...
Where are all your friends?
What does it mean - friends?
They are tearing you apart.
The smiling hyenas.
Poison doesn't taste
as bad as you've expected
So, see you in hell...hyenas...
