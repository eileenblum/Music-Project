The ultimate desperationInside emptyness
Subhuman isolation
On edge of society
Troubled existence and total indolence
of all these hungry homeless
With no justice with no food
Searching something for the point of living.
We are at the end of second millenium
and we are being fucking of pressed
Hunger, dirt, infections, rats.
Crying, death, insanity, stench.
This is a scorn so where have
all the equal rights gone?
Everybody is watching it
without any conscience or remorse.
Is there anybody who gives a fuck about
the tremendous desperation
and sorrow of this people?
