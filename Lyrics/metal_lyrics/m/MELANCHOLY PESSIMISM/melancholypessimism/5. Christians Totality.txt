To me came some fellow
On the chest he had the Christ
He told me - boy go with us
But I told him - No!
And that Christian began threaten
Your childs will have a bitter life
What's about you we don't bury you
after your death

Everything look so
that heaps of corpses
Will be on the dumps
And among they I will be
my wife and our childs

Christians totality!

Carry on my chest the Christ
from that time
But by head down I'm atheist
I want to all know this
And I beg for you
To don't admit new totality!

Totality!
Totality!
