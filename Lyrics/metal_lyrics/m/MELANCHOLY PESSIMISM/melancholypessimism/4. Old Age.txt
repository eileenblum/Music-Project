I'm dread of old age
and although I'm young
I feel it together with dead
trample to me heels
No! It isn't possible to I have been so old

Old age - somebody are saying - the rest
Old age - for me it's waiting to death only

Why what we are living?
What is sense of life?
to we know fear from death
and in the old age we be worry by
the thoughts about it what was
and what will be never?

Old age - present and torturous
Old age - youth is away

When I see the childrens I feel faint
Although isn't what envy to their
My life full of worry slowly over
So take me! You toothed bitch!

Old age - it's our fate
Old age - then death and nothing more
