For what is a religion
for what serve it?
Demagogic nations
and all are worry
They born like cripples
Child are servationing
is it what god wants?
You pray for him
You will die even!
Is the thousand illnesses,
but only your illness is the worst!
You're infected by religion
if God who don't exist
you're dying in life
you want not use the life

Christians Muslims
We grind in mill for the people
Buddhist Baptist
and imbecile nuns

Almost all wars
was in the name of god only
Brooks of blood flowed
but you don't hamper this
For you is god only
and around nothing more
When death will be coming to you
you will want be alive
you was angels only
humbles and believers
Pope serve the mass
Do you see his bloody hands?
You will be believing you lunatics!
To you don't help nothing
only grind in mill!
