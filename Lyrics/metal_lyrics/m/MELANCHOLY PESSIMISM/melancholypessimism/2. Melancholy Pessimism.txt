Without money without love,
alone for every - with annoy yourself
you have tried - something reach up
but however you haven't succeeded.

Melancholy pessimism
Melancholy pessimism

It's a long suffering for you
you wanted many times
to break life yourself
However you did it never.
Just you are a cower,
who didn't reach never nothing.

You are running - hidden to life
you are decided - to dead any
life is only a pain,
you don't wanna suffer yourself more
only what you have in head - is a suicide

Melancholy pessimism
Melancholy pessimism

You are smashing the neck
you are stripping wrong yourself,
It's is only your moment,
you are cutting vein yourself,
you are falling into agony,
you aren't feeling galloping blood,
but will try it never
that depression status
