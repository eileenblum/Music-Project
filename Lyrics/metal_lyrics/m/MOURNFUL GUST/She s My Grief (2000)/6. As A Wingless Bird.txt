Sheâs my grief
Sheâs my tears of despair
Sheâs sleeping beauty in my dreams
Sheâs ashes of my hopes
Sheâs voice of my eternity
Sheâs frankness of attracting midnight
Sheâs mistress of my heart
She and nobody except her

Bird, celestial bird
Bird, wingless bird
The bird remain with me for ever
â¦ Sheâs my grief

No, beloved, not for us this spring
We have lost our happiness outside our bodies
All that you see now itâs only dream
The reflection that never will happen

At one time we were birds with you
And with enjoying soared in the clouds eternal
But arrows of death pierce our wings
And weâre as if silence have felled in our life

That day when Iâve stretched hands to heaven
She as a bird has felled on my palms
By the wounded bird tearing out from my dreams
By the angel itâs in the flesh â¦ by the bird without wings

Sheâs my grief
Sheâs in a captivity of the body
Sheâs a wingless bird
Sheâs all my dreams
Sheâs embodiment of fantasies
Sheâs the castles in the air
Sheâs got used to ground
She and nobody except her

If only I had wings, I would give them to you
I agree eternally to be tormented on this ground
If only to enjoy your flight
In heavens that are so far away from me
