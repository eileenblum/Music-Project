Open to me a secret of your dreams
Where Iâm the hero of your lusts
And in sweet embrace of scarlet twilight
I shall become the knight of your night illusions

Neverland, I have believe in your myth
I was so naive in my death
I knew, that not return in a reality any more
Charmed by your fantasies

Iâm a naked nerve in your hand
You see all my dreams through
Whether you dream of me now
When I speak these words

Now I belong to you forever
My rest is stolen by your kiss
And let moon becomes our witness
When we shall merge in sweet embrace of scarlet twilight
