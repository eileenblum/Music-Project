Really my heart will bleed always
And my cut off wings will not grow again
Really Iâll never touch to lips of eternity
Blossoming scarlet flower on my grave

At one time we were immortal
At one time we were the only
Now youâre the snake in my heart
The snake in my bleeding heart

And weâre as wingless birds in a paradise garden
Cry above a grave of our eternal youth

Please, deceive me
Say to me what is it only dream
Iâm spring in a crown from dead flowers
I fade in dance of solitude

And you stung me having filled a blood by venom
And then I did know that so the hell starts

Please, deceive me
Say to me what is it only dream
But Iâm too alive what to believe your lie
Iâm too dead what to see salutary light

The eternity was our name
We drank youth from the rivers of bliss

But the sin has made us dead â¦
