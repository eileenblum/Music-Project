The hands are closed in the last embrace
The lips are merged in farewell kiss
I see the sun is setting in your eyes
In your sad eyes are full of tears

All what was inside of our now is dead
We see burns out fire
He was burn in ours hearts
And now die away by the wind of grief

Human voices are calm down
Birdâs singing is calm down
Your crying voice is calm down
And your eyes are closing for ever

It is not what I saw in my dreams
It is not what we dreamt when on is awake
It is our a last minute
And weâre in the power of perfidious moment

A last gulp of air
A last beat of heart
We kept our oath
And we shall die together

Ours rivers are dry up
Ours flowers are picking
Our night is disappear forever
In the rays of betrayal sun

And weâll set off for eternal journey
Lying together in a boot crossing the rivers of death
I die away feeling your kiss
And how sad if you feel same
