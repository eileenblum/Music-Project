ItÂ´s so silly to be afraid of slowly dyed away fire
The cold of a flame sting us
And we freeze...

And we freeze in absurd sufferings
ItÂ´s our own tragedy
So strange for no one of us
But such bitter... only for us

ItÂ´s so silly to be afraid of the outspoken words
They any more do not warm
As we once

And we freeze in absurd sufferings
ItÂ´s our own tragedy
So strange for no one of us
But such bitter... only for us

... only for us

Someone of us has put out this flame
Our reflections has gone
And you leave my hand
We donÂ´t want to remember... we are dead

ItÂ´s our own...
