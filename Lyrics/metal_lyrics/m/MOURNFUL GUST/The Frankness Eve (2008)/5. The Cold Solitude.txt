You can see me with closed eyes
You can feel me with your skin
Your every night has approaching my rapture
And your grief burns in my every word

Cry... weÂ´ll never to touch each other because
Because IÂ´m inside of you
Cry... you suffer from my eternity
I am your bitter cold solitude...

IÂ´m in your... lives with confession
IÂ´m with you... suffer from frankness
And something torments inside your soul
You can forget your life if itÂ´s not me

Cry... weÂ´ll never to touch each other because
Because IÂ´m inside of you
Cry... you suffer from my eternity
I am your bitter cold solitude...

You can see... IÂ´m in you
You can feel... IÂ´m with you

(Because IÂ´m inside of you
I am your cold solitude...)

Whispering: IÂ´m leaving for ever
Emptiness is closing your eyes...
I can embrace your dream with your illusions
And for the morning you will not wake up

Cry... weÂ´ll never to touch each other because
Because IÂ´m inside of you
Cry... you suffer from my eternity
I am your bitter cold solitude...
