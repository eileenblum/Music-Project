It corrodes from within... burns me
It poisons from within... destroys me
It cripples from within... enslaving me
It incinerates from within... burying me

There is too much for me
Everything is in your words
There is too much for pain
Everything is in your eyes
... leave me alone
... if you can

Leave me if you can
I have no forces
Leave me if you can
Allow me to die in loneliness

Erase all inside of me
Lay your hand on my eyes
Close the sun from me
... from illusions and jealousy
... for ever...

The darkness... creeps into my eyes
Am I alive? No, IÂ´m just without heart...
Illusions... There is my rest (forever)
Jealousy... In despair I am left...

Eyes are close, hands are lowered
Words are said, the life is lived...
ItÂ´s never to return... IÂ´ll try to forget
IÂ´ll allow you to come only in my dream

Leave me if you can
I have no forces
Leave me if you can
Allow me to die...

Leave me if you can...
Plead... leave me if you can...
