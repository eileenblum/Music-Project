... by fiery stone down to the sky
Into the fog on a threshold of dawn
On lunar path... in blindness
Obey the charms of my magical voice

To your deceits... again

The beast in sunÂ´s appearance at the gates of dawn
DonÂ´t let in... because I am...
Because I am coming to you
To your deceits... again

Alone with your reflections
I confess you in eternity
Wait for at the edge of time
IÂ´ll return for with the last star gone out...

The heavenly wine has been shed
No one cries anymore
Only bitter honey on your lips...
And your deceits... again

... by fiery stone down to the sky
Into the fog on a threshold of dawn
On lunar path... in blindness
Obey the charms of my magical voice

To your deceits... again

The beast in sunÂ´s appearance at the gates of dawn
DonÂ´t let in... because I am...
Because I am coming to you
To your deceits... again

Alone with your reflections
I confess you in eternity
Wait for at the edge of time
IÂ´ll return for with the last star gone out...
