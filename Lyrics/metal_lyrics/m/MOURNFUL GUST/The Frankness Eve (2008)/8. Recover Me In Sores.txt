There is nothing surprising...
... her cold embraces
She touches my palm
Like itÂ´s a snow recovered me

She is daring embracing stones
Inhaling the passion
By her temptation
No! I donÂ´t trust in her sorcery

My heart is beating in these stones
My heart is bleeding in your sores

IÂ´m only a sunset filled by melancholy
IÂ´m immemorial temptation but IÂ´m not a real...
Forever the falling asleep inspiration of her hands
Engraved in her delight...
... my name

My heart is beating in these stones
My heart is bleeding in your sores

Recover me!!!
