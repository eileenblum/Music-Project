Stare... IÂ´ve pulled out the heart what to humour your whim
Hold it... your hands... such cold and severe

I donÂ´t believe in your cold... I donÂ´t believe in your callousness
I donÂ´t believe in a shadow above my headboards... I donÂ´t believe

Shadow... the unique gift from you
I press to heart... I feel nothing
And with every beat
You leave me... with every suffering
... the unique gift from you
I press to heart... I feel nothing
And with every breath
... with every suffering

You... nothing to recollect... I always waited...
I drank your water and did not know that it is poison

So it is far from light... I am cold... it is hurt me...
Dawn above my headboard and cold dew... I donÂ´t believe

It will return again... I shall wait
I shall be ready... to leave forever

Stare... I donÂ´t believe... I am in your hands

There is no day... there is no night... only my pulse in your hands
My heart is in your hands... I am in your...
Shadow... the unique gift from you
I press to heart... I feel nothing
And with every breath
... with every suffering
