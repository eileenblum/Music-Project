IÂ´ve never burnt my heart
IÂ´ve never met a dawn with tears
IÂ´ve never felt pains up to you...
Honey for my wounds

Temptation is so cruel
I touch your shadow... I wake up...
IÂ´ve never been afraid of lonely nights...
Honey for my wounds

Let your words to warm
Let your eyes to bewitch
Let your breath become mine...
Honey for my wounds

Can you read my dreams?
Can you share my loneliness?
Let your lips becomes my honey...
Honey for my wounds

WeÂ´re...
Going to believe but we are dreaming now
DonÂ´t let anything to disturb your wounds
It is just a dream...
Cease... nothing else
This sun does not warm
A honey is stale it is bitter instead of your sweet...
... of your sweet
