Somewhere there... it is deep in heart
The melodies of your temptation
Such painful expectation...
Suddenly flashed passion

I hide my secret in your dreams
Avoiding a solution I am afraid of a pain
The bleeding memoirs...
And your words as a thorn in heart
The wounds are so deep...
Like the rivers of despair

Invisible patterns on heart
Pictures of your reflections
I see them through my dreams
And I wake up for my pain

Somewhere there... it is deep in heart
The melodies of your temptation
Such painful expectation...
Suddenly flashed passion

Leave me your pain... a pain to remember
Bitter consolation for my loneliness
So deep in heart... rhymes of farewell words
You leave exempting me... to feel it all again
The pain disappears but together with me...
The wounds are so deep like the rivers of despair
Your death does not become a part of me... your cold
We separately die to feel it all again and again...
