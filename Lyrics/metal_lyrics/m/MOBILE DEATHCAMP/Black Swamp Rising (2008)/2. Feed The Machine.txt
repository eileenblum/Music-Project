Death machine come rolling thru
Never see it til it pummels you
Running ramped into the crowd
Spreading sunshine and mushroom clouds
Collecting flesh and severed heads
The champions of the land of the dead
The hollow plane has dreaded it fury
Mobilize or you will be crushed
Die
Feed the Machine
Crushing your dreams
Try
Saving yourself
Screaming for help
Fry
Destructive end
Hope only friend
Cry
Up to the sky
All is a lie
The death machine keeps rolling on
With no remorse for those who are gone
With vicious fury for all that it meets
It's only mission 
To kill and defeat
