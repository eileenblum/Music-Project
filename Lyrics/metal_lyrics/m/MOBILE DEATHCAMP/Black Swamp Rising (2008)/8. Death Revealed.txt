Final day closes in
live and die
there's nothing you or I could do
Nameless price, take my life
Lead us on 
and break our spirits right in two
Watching me watching you
Private lives are something of day gone by
Brothers big, knows it all
Realize there no place you or I could hide
Breath of hot, wings of steel
Drive me mad, death revealed
Sky is black, mass attack
Package of disaster is the one to fear
Sit and wait, dreaded fate
Burning cloud of fire will be drawing near
Searing heat, no retreat
Winds of death are moving at a rapid rate
Feel yourself start to die
Helpless as you watch your loved ones radiate
End it all, hit the switch, kill us all
