Hate suspended is wearing thin
Breaking point, I can barely tolerate it
Pushing me into the corner hard feelings only grow harder
Get a life, watch me end it
Count me out, I refuse to defend it
Got my fill now, I'm tired and tried
Test my will now it's time you expire
Negative minds hate alike
Fueled by emotions of anger and spite
Negative minds hate alike
Laugh in your face while I'm raging inside
Source of power, hatred and pain
Intolerance til there's none left to gain
Heavily armed with my bad attitude
Can't shake it off I'll inflict on you
Out of my hands burn it down til its gone
Exterminate from king to the pawn
Nothing standing of bridges left burning
No love is lost and it just keeps on turning
