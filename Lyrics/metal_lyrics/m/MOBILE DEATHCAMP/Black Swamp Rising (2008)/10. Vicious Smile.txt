Out the gate, obnoxious rate, Abhorrent grate
Inherit style, a seething vile, a vicious smile
Blowing out, a meal of doubt, a mindless routine
A tasteless swig, denial big, can you dig?
Praying for strength on the ground
Watching for fear of tear down
Boasting to launch a new sun
Tasting a lifes work undone
Out the gate, Inherit style, A tasteless swig, 
Abhorrent grate, a vicious smile, can you dig?
