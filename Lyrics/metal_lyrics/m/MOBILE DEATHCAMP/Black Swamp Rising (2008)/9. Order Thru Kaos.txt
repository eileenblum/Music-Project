Bile burns from within
Three handed grin
Pulling the pin
With a stiff upper chin
Comfy cage, drug induced sage
Floating through life never on the same page
Dreams travel far, mind over car
Tripping the brain like a white Saloth Sar
Tappin the vein, mind almost insane
O.T.K.!
Taste life from afar, stuck in your jar
Who knows what will be what when you are?
Droppin a line, buck right on time
When it comes up, will you still drop your dime
Now who's your king?
All hail the thing?
Give yourself room to explore
Tao Te Ching
Tappin the vein, mind post insane
File points in your mind, turn from the grind
Seek a new way and be stoked when you find
Tappin the vein, mind post insane
