On your way
Seek a new land
Gone the day of your oppression
Make it work, kill the new man
Hecetu
Work the claim, destroying the red dens
Relocate existing earth men
Kill the rest to rid your problem
Hecetu
Bold Washicu eats up land
Hostile annex, your greed tastes bad
Blind obsession, respect you lack
If you don't love it give it back!
Man it up, accept you downfall
Take it on, crush you mind wall
What's it take for you to stand tall
Washicu
