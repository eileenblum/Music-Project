Battle unit, metal, with one absent
Too bad, can't keep head out of that crevice
Passion lacking flailo
Start yous sobbing
Trio growing stronger without problem
Online, keyboard tough guy
Seeks attention, useless dead weight front-man
Dead infection
I won't take it
Kill that LSD
We don't need it 
Kill that LSD
Ripping, crushing, slaying, MD raging
Pressing, gripping, staying B.Y.O.H.
You believe your own hype
Keep on spreading 
Tough to walk down turnpike to defend it
