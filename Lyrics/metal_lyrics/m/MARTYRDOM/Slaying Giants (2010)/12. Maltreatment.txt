Hate rises in me. Burning like a fucking fire until the end my heart is heavy with fury. My heart is destroyed. My head is corrupted. I've lost my fucking mind. Courtesy to not destroy all in my path. I wake in rage every day. Your pills won't help me. Your counseling
will not comfort me. So you've been in my shoes and you have the antidote? You don't know shit about anything. You couldn't pay me to take your worthless drugs. Insert the elements into your throat. How does it feel? Do you feel stronger? Do you feel like a better man?
Fucking liar. You'd take a pill to fix your face if you could. All your weaknesses shine right through. Your pills are the fucking enemy and I'm not adaptive to the contents. Everything around me takes me another step in the wrong direction.
