Breathe no fear to the prognosis of this war. We hold strong as an asylum to these high fucking grounds. The superior. The fucking apex to all that is known. Why fear when we are the feared? Warriors born for combat. Consuming all the blood of those that we have slain.
Feeding on their remains. This is true supremacy. Annihilation. Our calling is to ruin all. To create one nation of perfect souls as one we bury the infection. Welcome to the lionâs den. We are destroyers bringing extinction to all unlike us. Rivers constructed from the
blood flow. Stand before us and be crucified. Stand before us as we watch you die.

Run for your end is near. Prepare for your expiration is here. Nothing left but bones...Immersed six feet beneath the soil.
