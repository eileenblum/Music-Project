We've adapted to this lab rat way of life. The commonwealth infected by our own nationâs capitol. Brainwashed to believe we are dominant. But our colossus of towers are vulnerable to destruct. We are nothing but a number to our commander. Our losses over seas bring
nothing but anguish to our own. Freedom to vote is useless. We know nothing about our stranger of candidates but who is the superior public speaker. The "educated" way to choose our adjoining chief. The Educated way to choose our adjoining scumbag. We are at war with our
own. We sacrifice our own. The fighting and killing will never end. The suffering continues day and night. This is our world and we choose to hand it to our government. Being held in the hands of our enemy. There is nothing we can do. We will continue to fight for our
own. But we are only killing ourselves.
