What does this world have to offer me? A lot more than you ever thought I'd be. Never wanting me to succeed...You despised everything about me. Well open up and take it in. This is more than you'll ever achieve. You'll never achieve. Who the fuck are you? The perfect
example of American waste. Your kind is the American wasteland. Youâre everything that brings this country down. Reaping off our benefits. Knowing you're the trash that floods the streets. Reaping off our benefits. Sleep in nightmares when you close your eyes. A shit
filled soul with no sense of success. What does this world have to offer me? A lot more than you ever thought I'd be. Never wanting me to succeed...You despised. Who the fuck are you? The perfect example of American waste. Your kind is the American wasteland.
