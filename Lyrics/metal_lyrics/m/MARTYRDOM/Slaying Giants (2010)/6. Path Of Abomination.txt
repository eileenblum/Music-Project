Finding myself in a state of complete confusion with no end in sight. Taken years to find I'm not who I thought I'd be. Mirrors show me only reflections of someone elseâs face. Raised in a family of faith and glory. But their path ends with me. A new breed. Disjunction.
Partition from all that I knew. I'm so sorry I don't live up to your expectations, your traditions. But your egotistic lifestyle, Brings sickness to my heart. Brings pain to my chest. That you think you're fucking right. Call this my path of abomination. An end to the
bullshit you've created. I wonât stand for this senseless shit. You look me in the eyes and tell me I'm not your own. I'm just a plague to your ambition. I will live in my own success. Prove to you I am my own kind and your influence will not bring me back to your
development. No need to be your fucking golden child. I won't stand for this senseless shit, your bullshit. I won't stand for your bullshit.
