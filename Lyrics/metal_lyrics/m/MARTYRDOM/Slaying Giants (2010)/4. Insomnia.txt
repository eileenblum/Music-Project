Thereâs no hope left for this beaten sinking ship. Our own fallacy has caused this disaster. We're going under with nothing to hold on to. We set out with victory in mind. Yet our ambition has fallen short. I will not be a slave to this ocean bottom. I will not be
culinary for the sharks. Lives flashing before all water beaten eyes. Our arms grow weak but our hearts are alive. With nothing in site but the storm ahead. As all I care for are torn to shreds by the underwater creatures. We're all going under as death comes to all. And
then I opened my eyes to a cold dark room. Why must I sleep in agony? Why does my mind put me through death every night? I rest in torture every time I close my eyes. I know Iâll die tonight.
