You reek of festering sputum seeping from every pore. An unforgettable stench fills every inch of the air that we breathe. Your organs congested with toxins. You don't deserve the right to freedom. You don't deserve the right to autonomy. Remain here to rot in this
bistered chamber. Remember why you are here. Why you will drown facedown in your own filth. I am your God, your freak of nature, a mad fucking beast. Placed here, I will send you to your burning realm. What you will call your new domicile. Look in my eyes. Remember this
face for I am your deity, your creator, as well as your slayer. You bring me no apathy for your piteous existence. You sold yourself as a coward, a liar, a sinister. I now summon you to biolysis. Your time has come. On your knees mother fucker. Your time has come to meet
your fucking maker. Your time has come to burn in hell.
