Plague has swept the city taking thousands of lives. Starvation is no longer the concern. As mass graves continue to grow the air is filled with the scent of death. The scent no one longs to smell. God cannot save all your people. Nobody can. Thereâs no will to survive.

The screams are deafening as infection becomes slaughter. As slaughter becomes mass execution now. Any society would dread for this day to come. Any society would fail to this disease. This vague premonition of extinction is here. Burn yourselves alive...for itâs the
only apparent way out. Or stand to suffer among the thousands of your decaying race.
