Fight, something's different
Hate, something's different
Fight, something's different
Hate, something's gotta change

I guess hate is dead or
At least that's what I read
Can't we all get along, well
We do now the newspapers says
It's great to be here today
Now that hate's gone away
We'll all be feeling great
Now that we've conquered hate
Somebody said, and I quote,
"I hear that's what they said" Yeah

Hate's made obsolete
By man's superior intellect
Animals don't hate
They're too smart, deserve more respect
Hate's no longer cool
And it's time for a new dawn
And we've done our part
With this anti-hate song
Fine, from now on
We're no longer afflicted with hate

Hate messed with the best, and died like the rest
Hate don't walk, it crawls, hate's got no balls
Hatred is dead, it's screamed, kicked, and bled
Hate lost the war, hate's days are over
Hate burned its flag, hate's bound and gagged
Hate race is run, stick a fork in hate's done
Hate disappears, ain't heard hate in years
Hate's got no place in the U.S. of A.
