I'm the demon, you can trust me
I'm the demon, as you can see
I'm the demon, for you are free
You'll be safe if you listen to me

Just a taste is all you need
You'll feel better with help from me
Hungry for your brain to ease
If you don't take it you go crazy
You're a man can do what you want
Noone tells you to do or don't
The demon is here when you're feeling weak
Take some of this, listen when i speak

Take this stuff, it'll fix your life
You'll love it more than your wife
You give up, and you'll be ruled
You'll be one of the devil's fools
Just try a little, you can help yourself
To feel no pain equals all the wealth
Take some more cause it's almost time
One more shot and your soul is mine

See the world through black glasses
Watch my life as it passes
Through the city to the gates of hall
The demons there all will know me well
In the pain of my nightmare
Just give me more cause I don't care
Take me deeper, take me down
Demons wait for you underground

Walk with demons beneath your feet
You have things you must take, and dealers to meet
You cant control the spin, not by the shape that you're in
How could you tell you would wake up in hell
