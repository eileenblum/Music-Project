Freedom, justice, power of reason
Peace, opportunity, compassion, equal equality

These are the things we need
The same stars shine on everyone
We're blessed, we agree, we receive
We'll live in peace till our hearts bleed

Homeland, good friends, people who make amends
We spend gainful days, The profit is ours to save
