Maybe you might have heard
But no one spoke a word
The day the planet cried
The day the music died

Each day another dream
Killed by the music scene
All access was denied
The day the music died

We paid for everything
But back not a single thing
Our talents were all sucked dry
The day the music died

We saw it on T.V.
In all the magazines
We thought the news had lied
The day the music died

This is make believe
This is not for real
This won't last forever
This won't last at all

Eliminate the scene
It's illegal now to sing
Outlaws ask the reasons why
The day the music died

Now imprisoned for my craft
I smile and have to laugh
In my head the music's still alive
The day the music died

As all our hopes were dashed
Seems that all our throats were slashed
How could all our songs survive
The day the music died

Greedy fat bureaucrats
Care only for sales and stats
Woke up with dollar signs in their eyes
The day the music died
