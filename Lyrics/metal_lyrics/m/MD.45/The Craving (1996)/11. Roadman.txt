All I need's a highway sign to destinate my life
Play all night and drive all day, my job, and it's my wife
Once you get to going, there ain't no turning round
Across the U.S.A. and back again to give the people sounds

And when the party's over
And we done all that we can
I find out what time's check out time
Get up and get back in the van, I'm Roadman

Every night is Friday night, same show different day
Tomorrow we'll be headed down the road, and on our way
Tomorrow we'll be headed down the road, and on our way
