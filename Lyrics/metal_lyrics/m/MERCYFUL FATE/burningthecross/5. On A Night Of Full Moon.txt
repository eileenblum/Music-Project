Stay away
I am evil
Or you will die by tomorrow
Copulation with the body of a woman recently dead
My ceremonies with all the corpses
Finding some is where I find the ghosts in
It's desecration of souls in their holy lair
Magic circles drawn after midnight
Around graves to be opened
I use a wand and bodies rise
I ask the questions and I burn the remains
It's desecration of souls in their holy lair
On this sacrifice I've been searching on the night of full moon
Copulation with the body of a woman recently dead
My ceremonies with all the corpses
Finding some is where I find the ghosts in

It's desecration of souls in their holy lair
Oh this sacrifice I've been searching on the night of full moon

It's desecration of souls

"Burning the Cross" is the only Mercyful Fate song written by Benny Petersen, it never made it onto any album due to Petersen's early departure from the band."
