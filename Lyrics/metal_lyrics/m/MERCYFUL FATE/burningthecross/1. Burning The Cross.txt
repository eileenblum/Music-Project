Riding out and summed up for they know no destination
Demons and witches are leading their processions
Breaking religion by burning the cross
Breaking religion, burning the cross

Traveling in darkness, afraid of recognition
Evil ambitions, they're planning the destruction
Breaking religion by burning the cross
Breaking religion, burning the cross

Oh you gotta see them riding through the darkness and stay in the night
Unholy light
You gotta see them riding through the darkness and stay in the night
Unholy light
You gotta see them riding through the darkness and stay in the night
Yeah

Breaking religion, burning the cross
Oh yeah they're burning the cross [x2]
Hear what they say, 'cause they do not go home. [x2]
Oh you gotta see them riding through the darkness and stay in the night
Unholy light
You gotta see them riding through the darkness and stay in the night
Unholy light
You gotta see them riding through the darkness and stay in the night
Yeah
Doomsday reflections
Above the clouds high in the sky
Doomsday infections
In their heads and in their minds
Doomsday reflections
Above the clouds high in the sky
Doomsday infections
In their heads and in their minds
You'll be burning the cross
