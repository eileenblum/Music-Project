By the symbols of the creator
I swear henceforth to be
A faithful servant of his most
Puissant archangel
The Prince Lucifer
Whom the creator designated as his regent
And Lord of this World
I deny Jesus Christ the deceiver
And I abjure the Christian faith
Holding in contempt all of its works

[Solo: M. Denner, H. Shermann]

As a being now possessed of a human body
In this world I swear to give my full
Allegiance to its lawful master,
To worship him our
Lord Satan and no other
In the name of Satan, the ruler of Earth
Open wide the gates of Hell
And come forth from the abyss
By these names: oh, Satan, Leviathan,
Belial, Lucifer
I will kiss the goat

[Solo: H. Shermann, M. Denner]

I swear to give my mind
My body and soul unreservedly
To the furtherance of our
Lord Satan designs
Do what thou wilt shall be the
Whole of the law
As it was at the beginning
Is now and ever shall be
World without end
Amen
