Oh, yeah oh yeah 
Now hear my song 
Sirens calling, people leaving the streets 
The cops are coming, I don't know what I did 
Why don't you get away, leaving my soul alone. Maybe another day, you get a
reason too [X2] 
Oh, yeah oh yeah 
I'm running free, they won't get me alive 
No one can see, I did it to survive 
Why don't you get away, leaving my soul alone. Maybe another day you get a
reason too [X2] 
Oh yeah oh yeah 
This is what I did 
I killed a friend, for making love to my girl 
This is the end, a bullet from my gun 
Why don't you get away leaving my soul alone. Maybe another day you get a
reason too [X2] 
I can't belong 
Kill
