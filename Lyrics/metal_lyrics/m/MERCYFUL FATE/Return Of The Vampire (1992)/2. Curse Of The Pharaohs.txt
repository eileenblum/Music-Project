Way out in Egypt in the valley of kings 
Where mummified pharaohs pretend dead in their sleep 
Don't touch, never ever steal 
Unless you're in for the kill 
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs 
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you 
Now if you're breakin' the seals and disturbing the peace 
Then you're startin' up a curse 
Bringing evil disease 
Don't touch, never ever steal 
Unless you're in for the kill 
Or you'll be hit by curse of the pharaohs 
Yes you'll be hit and they curse is on you 
I'll be your pharaoh 
The curse of the pharaohs can be so deadly 
Or just destroying your future 
Making it all shady 
Don't touch never ever steal 
Unless you're in for the kill 
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs 
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you
