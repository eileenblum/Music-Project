Oh, I'll tell you everything I do 
We're going to talk at the moon 
You've said enough, too easily gave up 
I'll smash you, you'll look like a stranger 
You're young and scared 
No one hears, no one cares 
Shout out with your gun 
It's time to surrender 
You still will be burned 
You're sick and tender 
You asked for it, every time in prayer 
I'll smash you, you'll look just like a stranger 
Oh what a love to be young and scared 
No one hears, no one gives 
A damn 
Oh you asked for it, you won't get no mercy [X3] 
Oh little girl your pain is now 
Your eyes will "your mouth" (I was not able to figure out this whole line) 
Oh little girl you're about to be burned 
Oh little girl come and meet the devil 
Oh I'll tell you everything I do 
We're going to talk at the moon 
You asked for it, every time in prayer 
I'll smash you, you'll look just like a stranger 
No one hears 
No one gives 
A damn 
Oh you asked for it, you won't get no mercy [X3] 
Oh no
