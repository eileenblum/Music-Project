Someone better come and save my life
Someone better kill those evil eyes
Is it in my mind
Or are they still behind
Turning slowly
I see...I see...I see there's no one there

Someone better tell me what it's all about
In the dying fire
Moonlight has struck my eye
Turning colder
I see...I see...I see the amulet of EVIL GODS
EVIL GODS

Can you hear the voices in my head?
Can you hear the voices in my head?
Can you hear the voices, what they say?

Kutulu...Kutulu...Kutulu...Kutulu...

Traveling for years in the mountain side
Traveling for years to believe in the sign
And I know them well now
All of the Ancient Ones

Turning slowly
I see...I see...I see there's no one there

Someone must have broken the holy seal
'Cause I know they're there
Just like that fateful night

Feeling colder
I see...I see...I see the amulet of EVIL GODS!
EVIL GODS!

Can you hear the voices in my head?
Can you hear the voices in my head?
Can you hear the voices, what they say?

Kutulu...Kutulu...Kutulu...Kutulu...

Hear me as KUTULU raises his EVIL head
Dueling for my soul
I must finish this book tonight
Tomorrow....I might be of the dead!

I'm burning up...I'm burning up
I wish for you...The GODS will be Mercyful

Dueling for my soul
I must finish this book tonight
Tomorrow....I might be of the dead!

I'm burning up...I'm burning up
I wish for you...The GODS will be Mercyful
