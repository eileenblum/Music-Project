Angel, lady in white, stay away, you know my forces, Devil eyes
I'll take you to hell, You're inside my spell
In Lucifer's mirror, And I am his killer
I'm devil eyes

Angel, lady in white, you've had your time, now you are mine, Devil eyes
I'll take you to hell, You're inside my spell
In Lucifer's mirror, And I am his killer

Oh yeah, I'm devil eyes, Oh yeah, I love my eyes
Oh yeah, those evil eyes, Oh yeah, I love my eyes (I'm gonna get you)

I am heading for the gates of hell, bringing a victim, she's angel eyes
I took her to hell, In Lucifer's spell
I am his mirror, And still I'm his killer
Still I'm his killer

Devil eyes, Devil eyes.
