I'm back again, back in the evil night
And you're waiting, doomed by the living dead
Flames are rising, can't you see you're dying

The wolves are howlin', a baby's cry in the distance
Cold winds blowing in the dead of night
Flames are rising, can't you see you're dying

No way to survive this evil night, if the dead won't leave you alone
So just say goodbye to all your holy angels, you're gonna die

Long black hair, face like a dead, I am here, Satan in my head

You can't see nothing but confusing mirrors
Now you feel it, it's getting nearer
Flames are rising, can't you see you're dying

So dark in your mind, breath of Satan in my back
I can't help you, cause I'm one of the dead
Flames are rising, can't you see you're dying

No way to survive this evil night, if the dead won't leave you alone
So just say goodbye to all your fuckin' angels.
