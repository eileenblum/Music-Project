[SOLO: MICHAEL]

Halloween is the night
The legend says the ghost will rise
On Halloween they can't redeem
A restless soul from an ancient scene
At the sound of the demon bell
Everything will turn to hell
Rise...rise...rise...it's Halloween
Rise...rise...the ghost will rise
Reconciled with powers of darkness
He'll uncover a saint
You won't believe? See for yourself

[SOLO: MICHAEL]

I hear bell
A sound from Hell, the demon bell
I see a light in shadow in between the graves
Swinging his sword of hate towards the gates of Heaven
"Beelzebur, Astaroth...bring me the Devil"
And as he says these words I can't believe my eyes

[SOLO: HANK]

Upon a burning cross
The "Lord" Jesus, Satan's above
It must be a shame
To see the Lord falling again

Now rise, reconcile with the Powers of Darkness
Uncover a saint
You better believe or see for yourself
