[Solo: Michael]

I'm kneeling in front of the altar
Satan's cross upon the wall
Strange emptiness, a crystal ball between two candles
Melissa has entered another life

Melissa, you were mine
Melissa, you were the light

She was a witch
Why did they take you away?

[Solo: Hank]

Melissa, you were the queen of the night
Melissa, you were my light
I swear revenge on the priest
The priest must die
He must die in the name of Hell

[Solo: Michael]

Melissa, can you hear me?
Melissa, are you there?

Nothing is left outside at the stake
They're taken her away from me

"I think Melissa is still with us."
