Oceanic currents,
Rushing the decay.
Oceanic currents,
Flushing the decay.
What did you think would happen?
Oceanic currents.
Flushing the decay.
Put objects in flight,
Gravity overwhelms.
Set something afloat,
Watch it sink.
Put facts to the mind,
Make the oblivious think.
Put facts to the mind,
Make the oblivious think.
