Deafening silence.
Lives torn in half.
Forgotten memories.
Terror of the past.
Pain has subdued to the coming of darkness.
Holocaust of horror.
This mask of doom.
In a helpless rage to understand the mistake.
Can your hate give you salvation?
Can your ego give you love?
Your ignorance causes pain.
Your death will be the mastery of a life lived in vain.
