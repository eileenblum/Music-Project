Keep off the tracks, still be severed.
An effortless tension waiting to spark.
Truth will only be looked at as lies.
A lesson to learn, which road to travel.
In this world they can decide your fate.
Don't you hear the screaming locomotive.
Can't you feel their hate grinding.
Stupid earth trodden creatures, yourself.
Sowing the seeds of rot, to death.
