Standing in line like herded forced cattle.
Waiting in line to find out if they can eat.
Why the fuck do these people in power get to decide life for the people on
the streets?
Starving shouldn't be an option.
Hunger...
Thirst...
Emaciation fuckers.
Do you recall this pain that I speak of?
Standing in line like forced cattle.
