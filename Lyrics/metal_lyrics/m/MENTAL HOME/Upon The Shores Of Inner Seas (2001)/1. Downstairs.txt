[Music: Sergey Dmitriev. Lyrics: Sergey Dmitriev]

Downstairs, this burning ladder leads deep into your worn-out mind
Tell me your main secret and show all that frightens you...
You vision I see....
Chaotic thoughts spin and dance like a thousand stars
Time passes too swift and sunlight replaces the moonlight

Load the gun, well, and what's then? Won't you believe...
Curse this world, well, and what's then? Won't you believe...
Close your eyes, well, and what's then? Won't you believe...
It is just your next nightmare...

Upstairs, this burning ladder leads deep into your worn-out mind
Hide your main secret, don't show all that frightens you so...
