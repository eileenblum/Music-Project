[Music: Sergey Dmitriev. Lyrics: Marina Dolina, Sergey Dmitriev]

Save me, I see as always
Your gaze that burns me, so cold and empty
You scare me...
Awake me, I hear as always
Your silent whisper, in my strange vision
It scares me...

Tame me away from my fear
Away from your tears,
Away from pain that is inside of me
Kiss me, your kiss as always
Will burn my dry lips
Will give me bitter taste of repentance...

I'm not afraid of tomorrow's day
I don't escape...

Scold me, I can't pretend here
I cannot stay here
You really know where you should find me
Save me, I cried as always
You've led me to heaven
You've left me in clouds
I was led astray...
