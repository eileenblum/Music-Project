[Music: Sergey Dmitriev. Lyrics: Sergey Dmitriev]

I've got the world from which I'll run
The dream that burdened me is gone
Tonight I gonna have to break the past
And begin all again to try again...
I wish to return the years that passed
To see those people that I blessed
Don't... do not think of what I think
Of what I know, of what I feel...

God's set me free from unreality
The time is lost in black insanity
I am the one who won't break anymore
God's set me free...

I lock the doors within my mind
I want to leave it all behind
Come, come to taste the smell of Gods
The smell of lies, unknown lives
I wish to return the years that past
To see those people that I blessed
Time passes away, just God
Has always been and always will...
