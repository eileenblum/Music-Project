[Music: Sergey Dmitriev, Marina Dolina. Lyrics: Sergey Dmitriev, Marina Dolina]

My life is juts an eternal stream
All that's around reminds me of hell
I live, but it seems that I sleep
And I should breathe and see and hear as well
I'm living
I'm breathing

I'm looking for
A way out of a labyrinth (endless stream)
I was so sad and also glad
When I have read my excited mind
I hope for the best because there were times
When all was well when all was fine
I leave my home and I'm not upset
There is no way to understand this act
I got confused in this labyrinth
But I'm getting well, and this is a real fact

I know what I would see
There is no way out of here
I do my best as well
I still dissolve into nowhere

My life is just an eternal stream
All that's around reminds me of hell
I live but it seems that I sleep
And I should breathe and see and hear so well
My life is just an eternal dream
There is something evil and mysterious
I have fallen into my dream
I still dissolve into nowhere
