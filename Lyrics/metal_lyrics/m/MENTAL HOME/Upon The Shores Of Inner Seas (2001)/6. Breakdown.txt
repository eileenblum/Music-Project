[Music: Sergey Dmitriev. Lyrics: Sergey Dmitriev]

All these rainy days I'm bored stiff
So lonely here in my home of grief
All days along I waste my time
I breathe sweet air of despair

In this air I'm not better
All the world's as on a palm
In this air time stops
And I know and always knew
This is all because of you
This is all because of me
We have lost each other (But it doesn't matter now...)

My eyes have drilled all wall around
I'm still alone, one more day is gone
The feeling of deep solitude does not leave me, won't leave me...

You've burnt out all bridges
You have got what you wanted
You won't need me anymore
You told me "adieu"...
