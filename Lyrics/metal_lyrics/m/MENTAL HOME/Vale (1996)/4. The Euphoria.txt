[Music - Sergey, Roman]

Streams of mist and thoughts
Suddenly passed away.
Misgivings of fortunes.
I'll show you the sealed gate,
Heaven circles spins you free.
You feel like a pilgrim,
Kneeling before the saints,
And holding Earth in hands.

You've been deep and deeper in the woods,
The woods,  I know,  with filth and madness.
Look the area,  emptiness and despair,
Try to seal your path away.

Just a moment living my life,
I gave you a piece of my dream.
I showed you just waterfall,
Where you live as you fall...

Look the mirror's backside.
Maybe you'll find your countenance,
And I bet you will be crying
Begging me to drag you again.

Just a moment living my life,
I gave you a piece of my dream.
I showed you just waterfall,
Where you live as you fall...
