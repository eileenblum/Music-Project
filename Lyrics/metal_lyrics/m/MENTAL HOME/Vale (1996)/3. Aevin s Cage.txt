[Music - Sergey, Igor, Roman]

Tell me if you dare, why pain became your bride.
Breed in unshared tears as troubles gets your mind.
Look me in the eye, it makes you hypnotize.
I drug you through my sight let see you Aevins dies
Just feel your eyes

See your love, see your lies
Your passion false,
The flowers fade behind the rocks.
Life drops in sand,
And Aevin cry in dying land.
I raise your suffer,
Trust me fool, i'm clairvoyant...

You lookin` on your dreams, that you want to belong.
Skybridge above the stream, but something catch you strong.
That iron cage, you cannot mesmerize.
The burden griping' hard serenity is lies
                         solo - S.Kalachov
Colours of your dreams are like the autumn sky.
I see your rusted wings, it causes you cannot fly.
This life so small for you, it one you comprehend.
Wake up, I help you find, the key to Aevin's cage.
Just feel your eyes

See your love, see your lies
Your passion false,
The flowers fade behind the rocks.
Life drops in sand,
And Aevin cry in dying land.
I raise your suffer,
Trust me fool, i'm clairvoyant...
