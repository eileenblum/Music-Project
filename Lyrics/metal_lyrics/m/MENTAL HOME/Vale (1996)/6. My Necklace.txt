[Music - Roman, Sergey]

I saw life that's fading out,
Steams of souls I breathe.
Eyes of beauty staring rigid,
Tell me all I want to know.

Stars reflect in my gem stones,
Shaking fingers touch your skin.
I bring you my necklace,
Make it trip on your neck.

I read the suffer,
In eyes of dead.
I feel the cold wind,
Of your last breath.

Two months're gone and I stay,
Kneeling here before your grave.
I take what you were wearing.
I can see my destiny.

I read the suffer,
In eyes of dead.
I feel the cold wind,
Of your last breath.

In flames of troubles,
I lock in my world.
I've found my paradise,
But I lost my soul...
