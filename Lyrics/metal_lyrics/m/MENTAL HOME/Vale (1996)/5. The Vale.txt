[Music - Sergey, Igor, Roman]

As I'm drawing autumn rain,
Drops like tears're falling down.
Window with dried rose,
I am back to my remains.
With a candle unseen in my hand,
I have passed through the wall.
Do you feel waves of wind ?
I am here my little Queen.

Call me now,  I'm in your air.
Take me down,  I wish you there.
Pick the stars and wash your face.
Touch my soul in last embrace...

So I'm reading in your eyes,
Suffer drowns in painful love.
I remember morning calm,
As I climb to shimmering stars.
Maybe you feel the same
In a deep of subconscious mind.
Dream together in mental,
I am here tonight to vale with you.

Call me now,  I'm in your air.
Take me down,  I wish you there.
Pick the stars and wash your face.
Touch my soul in last embrace...

As the angels make the call,
Clouds dissolve in universe.
I will bleed and climb up high,
But I send you my last dream.
It comes with morning breeze,
Blowing slowly,  embrace your lips.
As I'm choosing my own fate,
Sleep alive,  while not so late...

Call me now,  I'm in your air.
Take me down,  I wish you there.
Pick the stars and wash your face.
Touch my soul in last embrace...
