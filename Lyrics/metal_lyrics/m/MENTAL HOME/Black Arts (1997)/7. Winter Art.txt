[music: Sergey Dmitriev, lyrics: MAIDEN]

The long road under my feet
Is like a stream in a cold air
When a day dies beyond the cold horizon
And each snow-flake falls on its shadow.

As I touch the water glance
Ice melts under my fingers
Thousands of stars travel once
From sky to earth to leave no trace.

Sad is the path of the silver snow-flake
Watch as it dies on my hand leaving only tear
only single tear...

On and on the sky is crying
On and on to face the day
On and on my dream is dying
And so is every single winter day...........
