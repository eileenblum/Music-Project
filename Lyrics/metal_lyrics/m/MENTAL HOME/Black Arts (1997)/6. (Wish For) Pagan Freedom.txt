[music: Sergey Dmitriev, lyrics: MAIDEN]

I wish to fly and pierce the rain clouds,
To face the dawns and sunsets,
To see the lights and darkness,
But all this passed now...
Ever to flow with the river,
Ever to ride the wind with eagle,
To rise high to the father sun,
But all this I have lost...

Svarog, you watch me dying
I've lost the treasures of my Fathers,
My Children and my Nature,
My Churches are burning
Great is the sorrow rising
Over forthcoming generations
With black minds they will
Worship the Southern Star...

Dying I'm under ages
That brought enslavement to my land
And devastation to my dreams
That last in pain...
Let them make ashes of my body,
To hate and curse my name
But freedom never dies!!!
