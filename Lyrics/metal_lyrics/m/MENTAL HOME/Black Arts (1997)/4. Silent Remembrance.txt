[music: Sergey Dmitriev, lyrics: MAIDEN]

Oh sweet dreams, where have you gone
Killing me and all I've done.
Sad are paths you left behind
And the pain that makes me blind.

All the sins I ever made,
All the things I love and hate,
All the battles I have fought
Were in the name that I forgot.

I dream the field of roses red
I run across and can't be caught
But someone stands behind my back
And calls the name that I forgot.

What I have to sacrifice,
Where to look to hide my eyes,
Where to go to be away,
What to think and what to say?

Nights will pass for days to come.
See ! The older I become !
But through the voices of the world
I hear the name can't be forgotten...
