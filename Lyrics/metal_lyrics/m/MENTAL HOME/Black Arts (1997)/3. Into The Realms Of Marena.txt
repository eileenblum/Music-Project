[music: Sergey Dmitriev, lyrics: MAIDEN]

Losing paths in the nights
Seven days I'm in quest for you
Taken too far and high
To turn back off my way

Trees are closing behind my horse
Leaving no trakcs I ride
On the winding and icy road
Right into your Realms

In the dark touch my hand, read my eyes -
See the sun I left to be with you
Here I am, my long-awaited love
Take my breath, oh Marena...
In the heart of blizzards and winter grief,
Moon embrace and eternal sleep
Would I die covered by endless snows
Beneath your Realms...
