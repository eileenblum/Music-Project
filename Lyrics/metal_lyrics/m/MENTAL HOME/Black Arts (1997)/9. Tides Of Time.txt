[music: Sergey Dmitriev, lyrics: MAIDEN]

If I close my eyes forever,
Will I loose the light of day?
Will I pass the gates of eternity?

Will I flow like river long,
Heading to the endless sea,
Sea of calm and sleeping emotions...

I watch the stars
That guide me with pale blue lights.
I breathe the sky
I drink it until I die.
Wind knows my name
That burns in oblivion flame.
The grief's my rhyme
It's covered by tides of time...

Kaleidoscope of colors and dreams
Painting landscapes with the water,
Misty visions remind all I ever knew...

Come to light and fade away,
Touch the spring, feel autumn's gray,
Everlasting trip in the Universe...

I watch the stars
That guide me with pale blue lights.
I breathe the sky
I drink it until I die.
My name belongs
To lament that's wept by crows.
The grief's my rhyme
All covered by tides of time...
