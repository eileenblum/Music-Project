I don't regret a thing
I will wear a shield
Gotta find a way
I'm not gonna crack
Self appointed judges judge
Protectors of the kennel
There is a nothing I could say
More than they have sold
I'll keep fighting
No mercy has my gun
Here I am
Who while away the patience
Siren on the roof tops waling
Echoes of the Santiago's nights
He can't go far
Say the voice in the darkrness
You can't last long
Say the fire of the gun
Don't look at me
I'm not your victim
I don't care what you think
You go alone and sing your song
I'll keep fighting
No mercy has my gun
He I am
Who while away the patience
Siren on the roof tops waling
Echoes of the Santiago's nights
Fire explode, fire inflame
Still they're invincible
Still they're immune
And the TV will tell you lies
Truth covered in security.
