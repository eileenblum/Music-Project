I am a part of the circus
All you have fun with me
Yes, I an the spectable
My body is your

Insane Cops
My head is your
My hands is your
My face is your
My corpse is your

I kicked
And screamed
Said no
Let me in peace
If you know
The sound
Of the hits in the cell

But my spirit never be surrender, never be... never

I'm so alone with my fear
With my scare
With my blood

Get me out of the cage
Motherfucker
In a trap feel a strap
Holding still pinched to kill
My body revolves

Keep on turning...
Just spinning around.
