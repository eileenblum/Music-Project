Dark nights the planet are set
Here is my dream and it's wating for me
Please take me away
From disappoinment, fear and disillusion

At the glare of a light
I have a strange king of sight
Flying invisibly high
Over the mountain of black sky

I, l've conquered the time
To want to steal a knife then
I'll check that I have skin
Then I'll check that I have life

I have to face
Face my fear
I have to face
Face my paranoid
Stay, stay, stay... stay away

ALTAZOR

I think I'm losing touch
I wonder where the hell I am
If I keep self control
I'll be safe in my soul

I have to face
Face my fear
I have to face
Face my pararnoid
Stay, stay, stay... stay away
ALTAZOR!!!!
