All is all
We all are
The killer come
To fly from the air
He follows black's orders
Of kind of north
The puma is
Howling for meat
For pain
For blood

I will see you die
In your sentence

Burn the corps
Throw it the sea
With eye so dilated
Reality is a whore

For ever in debt
For ever in limbo
For ever to the end

I will see you die
In your sentence

Pride for
Pride for
Pride for
Pride for
Salvation

Gabriel say

I believe there never is an end
God gave up this earth
It's people long ago
Why he's never there
I still don't understand

And when the hate's waters
Slow down
The dark an the deep
Have no one left to keep
Gone the killers and victims

Now only the rats hold's way
