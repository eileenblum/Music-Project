You, insane god of war
You played with fire
Poor Hitler clone
My country burns below you

I want you a morbid death
I want you a morbid death
I want you a morbid death
I want you a morbid death
I don't want nothing more
And nothing more only, only

Die in my mind
Die in your brain
Die in my mind
Die in your brain

I don't belive
Like human rights died
Nothing can divine justice
Crushed you

I want you a morbid death
I want you a morbid death
I want you a morbid death
I want you a morbid death
I don't want nothing more
And nothing more only, only

Die in my mind
Die in your brain
Die in my mind
Die in your brain
