I want the end of devastation
To be or not to be is the cry
I want the end of my brainstorm
My life is only stupid circle

All is disastrous picture
Where the disillusion kissed my mind
I don't want to live
In these parallels worlds

Now am burnin my body
In sign of solution
You think that is cowardice
Feel this strange pleasure

I die in a violent sacrifice
Searching the destinations of our dreams
I want a contact with Rama
Between spirals and quasars

My eyes are energy now
The great mystery of god
Now my soul takes freedom
Running to the eternity

I'm in the space
I am a part of universe
I am my own dream
I am my own dream
