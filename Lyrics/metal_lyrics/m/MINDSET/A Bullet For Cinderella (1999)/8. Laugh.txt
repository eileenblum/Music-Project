I'd fake it all, to work it in
I'd climb a wall, to watch you hang
I'd build a plank, so you could walk it 
Let's cut the shit, I've heard you talk it
Calculated,
Like a killer razor sharp, 
A guillotine I'd lose the smile, 
Since you just fake it 
You've got the chance, 
Now you should take it

Ha! ha! You wanna laugh
Ha! ha! I'll show you somethin'
Ha! ha! You wanna joke 
Ha! ha! I'll watch you choke!

I'd sell it all, 
Without regret and climb a wall, 
To watch you hang I'd build a plank, 
So you could walk it 
Let's cut the shit,
I've heard you talk it

Ha! ha! You wanna laugh
Ha! ha! I'll show you somethin' 
Ha! ha! You wanna joke 
Ha! ha! I'll watch you choke!

You laugh at my friends
You laugh at my plans 
You laugh in my face
You laugh behind my back
You laugh at everything i stand for 
But I don't see you laughin' now
I don't hear you laughin' now
Who's laughin' now, bitch?

Ha! ha! You wanna laugh 
Ha! ha! I'll show you somethin' 
Ha! ha! You wanna joke 
Ha! ha! I'll watch you choke!
