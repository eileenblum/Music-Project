You're on your way 
So take me back, take me back
The enemy is callin' again 
Now flush him out!

The way to defeat it
Lock and load
The way to defeat it 
Just unload

What do you say? 
When they call you out, call you out
The enemy is claimin' 
To be what he is not!

The way to defeat it 
Lock and load 
The way to defeat it 
Just unload

Who would claim?
To be that which he is not? 
Why would you claim to be?
somethin' you're not?

To defeat it
Lock and load 
To defeat it 
Just unload
