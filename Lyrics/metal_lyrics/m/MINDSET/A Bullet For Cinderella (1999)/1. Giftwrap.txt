No regrets from the outside 
Or safe bets to make 
A package with a new name 
A safe bet on the side

You tell me I don't belong 

The truth might be wrong 
You pretend I don't exist 
Well pretend you don't hear this

I've got a bomb in my backpack

I've got a shoebox full of snakes
Checks in the mail 
Yeah fuck you, fuck you 
Checks in the mail
Fuck you

You tell me I don't belong

The truth might be wrong 
You pretend I don't exist
Well pretend you don't hear this

I've got a bomb in my backpack 

I've got a shoebox full of snakes 
Checks in the mail 
Yeah fuck you, fuck you
Checks in the mail
Fuck you
