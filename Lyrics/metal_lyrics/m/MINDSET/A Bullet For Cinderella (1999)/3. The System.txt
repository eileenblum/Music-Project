You don't conform, 
You contort 
You distort 
Everything you don't reply, 
You rely on everyone 
To set it up 
You just reject, 
You dissect the ideas
'Cuz it's ideal 
You don't conform, 
You contort 
You distort 
Everyone and everything 

Breakin' away
From the system

You don't relate, 
You just hate
To bear the weight 
You don't reply, 
You rely 
On everyone to set it up 
You don't conform, 
You deform 
You contort everything
You don't conform, 
You just distort

Breakin' away 
From the system

Reject the system, 
Dissect the system
Reject the system, 
Dissect everything

You don't conform, 
You contort 
You distort everything
You don't reply, 
You rely 
On everyone to set it up

Breakin' away 
From the system
