Lock your doors 
And restrain your whore, man 
I'm comin' for you 
With my meat in my hand, 
Mother is this your impression of me?

Mother loves you 
But she sees the world in green

Yeah, here's the truth,
Not a dime to my name 
I guess I'm a waste 
But got my sights 
Set on that son of yours
That turkey boy comes my way
He's gonna baste 

Mother loves you
But she sees the world in green
Mother loves you
But she sees the world in green

Why can't you see?
Can't you see? 
That you're colorblind
Colorblind
