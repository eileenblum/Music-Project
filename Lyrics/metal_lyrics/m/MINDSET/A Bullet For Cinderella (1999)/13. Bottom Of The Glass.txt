There you are 500 miles from home
In a hotel room sacked outta your mind
And hopin' that you'll never be found 
You just don't wanna be found

There you are downtown Cincinnati
In some strange girl's room 
She's out cold and you're outta the cold
For now 
But just for now

One more time to get it right 
One more time to get it right
They stretch you and scrape you
From the bottom of the glass 

There you are an ocean away
In a hotel room scared outta your mind 
And hopin' that you'll never be saved 
You just don't wanna be saved
There you are in the middle of nowhere 
Askin' yourself why ask yourself why

One more time to get it right 
One more time to get it right
They stretch you and scrape you
From the bottom of the glass

There you are 5,000 miles from home
In another hotel room 
Gacked outta your mind 
And hopin' that you'll never be found 
Never wanna be found never be found

One more time to get it right 
One more time to get it right 
They stretch you and scrape you
From the bottom of the glass

Get it right 
Get it right 
You fuck up
Get it right
