You fall
I end up in the middle 
You call 
I end up losin' sleep

I need this in case I derail one day
I need this in case I derail one day
Until the weather clears 
We'll remain divided

You stall
I end up losin' time
You crawl
I end up on my knees

I need this in case I derail one day
I need this in case I derail one day
Until the weather clears
We'll remain divided

I need this in case I derail one day
I need this in case I derail one day
Like I need this 
Until the weather clears 
We'll remain divided
