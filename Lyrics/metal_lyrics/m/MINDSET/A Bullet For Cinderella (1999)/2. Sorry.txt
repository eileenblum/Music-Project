Flies on my face
Don't have the strength to make them stay 
My head's explodin' 
Feels like the brakes are givin'
I know that I said forever
I didn't mean forever 
I'm sorry, I blew it

Cold fingertips 
Don't have the touch they used to 
A knife for your heart 
It's time for everything to come around
I know that I said forever
I didn't mean forever
I'm sorry, I blew it 

I'm so sorry, I apologize

Flies on my face 
Don't have the strength to make them stay 
My head's explodin' 
it's time for everything to come around
I know that I said forever
I didn't mean forever 
I'm sorry, I blew it

I'm so sorry, I apologize
