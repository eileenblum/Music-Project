You only know me by my name
But that's ok
It's through the flesh, inside the bone
Just past my soul

Now it's cold
I might never see the sun 
Getting older
Look at all this wasted time

I only know you by your name 
But that's ok
This mental weight 
Can pull us down 
It works us both

Now it's cold 
I might never see the sun 
Getting older
Look at all this wasted time

Well it all burns down 
As time flies by 
And we're gone 
Yeah we're gone

Now it's cold 
I might never see the sun
Getting older 
Look at all this wasted time
