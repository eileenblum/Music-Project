Well it gives me the runaround 
And I don't wanna fight 
I got the sense to turn around 
You ain't wrapped too tight

I might need a tourniquet 
To keep the wounds in check
I might need an extra set of eyes
To keep you in check

I drink the backwash
&gt;From the sewer now and then
I ain't got time to help us both
Help yourself
I ain't got the time

Now the ship has run aground
And there's no help in sight
I got the sense to turn around
I can't win this fight

I might need a tourniquet
To keep the wounds in check
I might need an extra set of eyes
To keep you in check

I drink the backwash
From the sewer now and then
I ain't got time to help us both 
Help yourself
I ain't got the time
