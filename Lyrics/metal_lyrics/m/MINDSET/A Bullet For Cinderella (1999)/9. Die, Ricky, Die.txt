Something makes me want 
To pick up a plastic bag 
And put it over my head 

No wait a minute 
I wanna put it over your head
I should stop thinking this way

Something makes me want
To pray that you kill yourself
I should stop thinking these thoughts

No wait a minute 
I wanna fuck you first 
And give you one last kiss
I should stop thinking these thoughts

Die Ricky 
Die Ricky

Something makes me want
To douse you with gasoline
I should stop thinking this way

No wait a minute
I should stop holding things 
Over your head
I can't stop thinking this way

Die Ricky 
Die Ricky
