Constantly live in fear
Of committing sin or having doubts
The devil is always here 
Trying to tempt our mortal souls

So many questions left to ask
So many answers yet to find
I want to know just what they hide

And for this I'll burn in hell
Burn in hell

Demons are riding your soul
You're thinking thoughts you can't control
Desire's a plague in your mind
Nowhere to run- nowhere to hide

So many questions left to ask
So many answers yet to find
I want to know just what they hide

And for this I'll burn in hell
Burn in hell

[SOLO]

Burn in Hell
Burn in Hell
