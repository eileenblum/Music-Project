Through eons of time my heart has awaited
For this day to come
And many a day the gods know
I've doubted that this moment would arise

In passionate flames my heart is burning
The moment is here, the end of our journey

We can't ignore our hearts
They were meant together
Two souls meant for each other
Together, now and forever

In passionate flames my heart is burning
The moment is here, the end of our journey

We can't ignore our hearts
They were meant together
Two souls meant for each other
Together, now and forever

[SOLO]

We can't ignore our hearts
They were meant together
Two souls meant for each other
Together, now and forever
We can't ignore our hearts
They were meant together
Two souls meant for each other
Together, now and forever
