Our hearts were made as one
Perpetual love, why did you have to die?

I held you tight and said, "Loved one, do not be afraid.
Just close your eyes and dream."

[2x]
Sleep forever in my arms
Our love, it never had a chance
A dream was all we had, you and I

They were blind,
They could not see
That you and I
Were meant to be

I held you tight and said, "Loved one, do not be afraid.
We'll meet again, you and I".

[2x]
Sleep forever in my arms.
In death, our love may have a chance.
I know we'll meet again, you and I.

[Solo]

[2x]
Sleep forever in my arms.
In death, our love may have a chance.
I know we'll meet again, you and I.

Forever in my arms
Our love may have a chance.
I know, I know we'll meet again.

Sleep, just close your eyes and dream
Death is not what it may seem
This life was but a dream,
So, sleep...
