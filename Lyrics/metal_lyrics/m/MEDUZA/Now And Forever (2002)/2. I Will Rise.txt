They've always told me you're not good enough
Keeping me nailed to the ground
But I've always followed the voice of my heart
Burning desire of art

They're full of envy
It makes them mad
I see it clearly
It makes me sad
But now I know, now I know

As sure as they shall fall
I will rise

A storm wind of feelings, I'm bursting in flames
Passion is burning in the sky
I'm screaming the notes, that I'm going to play
For me there's no other way

They're full of envy
It makes them mad
I see it clearly
It makes me sad
But now I know, now I know

As sure as they shall fall
I will rise

[SOLO]

But now I know, now I know

But now I know, now I know

As sure as they shall fall
I will rise

But now I know, now I know

As sure as they shall fall
I will rise
