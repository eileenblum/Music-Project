Trapped in this man-made cave
Forever it may see,
Every crack, every stone
Is known to me

Sentenced to die
The everlasting death
Alive, but not living
I dwell in here

Born 
Four thousand years ago
Through Egypt I've roamed
Son of the Nile

My soul is burning
With hate for all mankind
Through the depths of time

Now the mortal fools
Has let me out of here
The time has come
Revenge is mine

Born 
Four thousand years ago
Through Egypt I've roamed
Son of the Nile

Vengeance
At last will be mine
I'll tear your souls apart
Now you will die

[SOLO]

Born 
Four thousand years ago
Through Egypt I've roamed
Son of the Nile

Vengeance
At last will be mine
I'll tear your souls apart
Now you will die
