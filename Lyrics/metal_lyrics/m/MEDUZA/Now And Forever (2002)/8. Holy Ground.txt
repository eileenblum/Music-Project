In to the realm of a perpetual sleep I go
Riding on a dream
Where the wings of chaos reign forever more
Logic can't prevail- oh no

I feel a power rising
Deep in my soul
This is the final quest
This is my gold

Now I'm on holy ground
Enlightened I stand at the shrine
Two hearts joined as one
Death must pass, 'cause love can't die

Into the abyss of forgotten fears I fall
Screaming out your name
Where the flames of anguish burn forever more
My sanity, it is at sake

I feel a power rising
Deep in my soul
This is the final quest
This is my gold

Now I'm on holy ground
Enlightened I stand at the shrine
Two hearts joined as one
Death must pass, 'cause love can't die

[SOLO]

Nightmares coming true
Through purgatory fires
I will walk for you

Now I'm on holy ground
Enlightened I stand at the shrine
Two hearts joined as one
Death must pass, 'cause love can't die

Now I'm on holy ground
Enlightened I stand at the shrine
Two hearts joined as one
Death must pass, 'cause love can't die
