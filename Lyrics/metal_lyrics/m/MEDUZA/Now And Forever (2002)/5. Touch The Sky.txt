A perpetual fire
Reign of passion, my heart is in flames
An eruption of violent fury
Touches me gentle as a breeze

An emotional whirlwind
Sweeping through my mind
Now I am reaching for heaven
Leaving you all behing

My heart is pure and my mind is so clear
Soaring so high, I'm free of all fear
I never knew I could fly this high
Touch the sky

There are no boundaries, no limits
When you are riding on the wings of a song
They've always told me to slow down
I have tried, but I can't live a lie

An emotional whirlwind
Sweeping through my mind
Now I am reaching for heaven
Leaving you all behing

My heart is pure and my mind is so clear
Soaring so high, I'm free of all fear
I never knew I could fly this high
Touch the sky

[SOLO]

An eruption of violent fury
Can't live a lie, my heart is in flames
There are no boundaries, no limits
When you follow the voices of your soul

An emotional whirlwind
Sweeping through my mind
Now I am reaching for heaven
Leaving you all behing

My heart is pure and my mind is so clear
Soaring so high, I'm free of all fear
I never knew I could fly this high
Touch the sky
