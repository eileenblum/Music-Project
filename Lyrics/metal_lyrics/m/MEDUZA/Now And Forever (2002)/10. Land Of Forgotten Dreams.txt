As a child I was running free
Like a leaf in the wind
The days seemed endless
No worries then
There was no ball and no chain

I look back on those days with a yearning in my heart

Land of forgotten dreams

As we grow older, our hearts turn cold
We're no longer running free
Live our lives in captivity
Now we're chained to the ground

But I look back on those days with a yearning in my heart

Land of forgotten dreams

[SOLO]

As a child I was running free
Like a leaf in the wind
The days seemed endless
No worries then
There was no ball and no chain

I look back on those days with a yearning in my heart

Land of forgotten dreams

Land of forgotten dreams
