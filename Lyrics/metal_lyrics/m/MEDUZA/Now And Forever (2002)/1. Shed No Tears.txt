One heart of fire, another made of ice
What I once I though was true, has shown to be lies

I know you've been mistreated
You have been hurt
But treating me this way
Won't take away your pain

No tears, I'll cry for you
Although my heart's bleeding
I won't shed a drop
'Cause you are no worth it
You are nothing to me
Shed no tears

My life is passion, your life is full of rules
You think that passion's something made just for fools

[A:] There's nothing more to say now
[S:] Nothing to say
[A:] You've had your chance
[S:] You've had your chance
[A:] You threw away the key that opens up my heart
[S:] My heart

No tears, I'll cry for you
Although my heart's bleeding
I won't shed a drop
'Cause you are no worth it
You are nothing to me
Shed no tears

[SOLO]

No tears, I'll cry for you
Although my heart's bleeding
I won't shed a drop
'Cause you are no worth it
You are nothing to me
Shed no tears.
