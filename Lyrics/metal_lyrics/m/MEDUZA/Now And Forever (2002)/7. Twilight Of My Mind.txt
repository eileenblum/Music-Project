In the twilight of my mind
The twisted shadows of my past swell
Chanting, pleading and commanding me
Whispering me poisoned wisdom in my ears

Faceless creatures crawling
I can't take this pain
All this struggling- oh it was in vain

It happens in the twilight of my mind
It happens in the twilight of my mind

Tormented thoughts, they roam my soul
Digging holes of anguish in my mind
Eyes of fire, wishing I were dead
The shadows laughing all the tears I shed

Faceless creatures crawling
I can't take this pain
All this struggling- oh it was in vain

It happens in the twilight of my mind
It happens in the twilight of my mind

[SOLO]

Faceless creatures crawling
I can't take this pain
All this struggling- oh it was in vain

It happened in the twilight of my mind
It happened in the twilight of my mind
