See the world the way I do
Through the eyes of a bitter truth
Fear will shoot through your soul.

You raise your cup and drink their blood
You've gained the power, but you've lost your soul
Oh, what have you done?

Can you feel their breath?
Like ice down your spine
They are here

Hounds of hell, sniffing your heals
Now there's nowhere to hide
No escape for you
You know you're doomed
You're going to die

[SOLO]

Cast away your chains and run
The battle for your life's began
Don't ever look back.

You can hear the hideous cries
They're getting close, you know they're near
Oh, they'll tear you apart

Can you feel their breath?
Like ice down your spine
They are here

Hounds of hell, sniffing your heals
Now there's nowhere to hide
No escape for you
You know you're doomed
You're going to die

[SOLO]

Hounds of hell, sniffing your heals
Now there's nowhere to hide
No escape for you
You know you're doomed
You're going to die
