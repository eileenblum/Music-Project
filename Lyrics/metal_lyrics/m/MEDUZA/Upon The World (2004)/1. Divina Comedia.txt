This is a picture of a strict world
We're living in
Every deviation from the rule
Means to serve one's penalty
No mercy

This is a memory, reflected images
Beyond all history, hides a missing link

[Chorus:]
Desperates cries, cracking just like thunder
Evil eyes, in a stormy sea
Tormental souls, spirits from under
Trying to mislead into eternal fear

A journey to the ledge of hell
Where sinners are condemned to eternal pain
The deeper in the dark they get,
The more horrifying the suffering

All sinners' histories entwined with human destinies
Oh without empathy, there is no way out

[Chorus:]
Desperates cries, cracking just like thunder
Evil eyes, in a stormy sea
Tormental souls, spirits from under
Trying to mislead into eternal fear

[Solo]

This is a memory, reflected images
Beyond all history, hides a missing link

[Chorus:]
Desperates cries, cracking just like thunder
Evil eyes, in a stormy sea
Tormental souls, spirits from under
Trying to mislead into eternal fear
