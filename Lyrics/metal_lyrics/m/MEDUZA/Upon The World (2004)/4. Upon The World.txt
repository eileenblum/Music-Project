Like a disease it's spreading all over the globe
Visions of nightmares desecration of our shrines

The wrath of the gods will bring down the sky
As they sentence us to burn

[Chorus:]
Upon the world
A wall of fire will descend
We'll know, this is the end
And the screams
Echoes from another time
(Once again) The doomsday bell will chime

We're spawn of evil the leaches of the world
Never giving always taking we're rotten to the core

The wrath of the gods will bring down the sky
As they sentence us to burn

[Chorus:]
Upon the world
A wall of fire will descend
We'll know, this is the end
And the screams
Echoes from another time
(Once again) The doomsday bell will chime

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
Upon the world
A wall of fire will descend
We'll know, this is the end
And the screams
Echoes from another time
(Once again) The doomsday bell will chime
