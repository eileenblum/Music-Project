There's something evil drawing near
A foul and bitter stench has filled the air
Pictures of death becoming clearer
My god it's obvious why can't they see?

Am I going mad?
Am I insane?
Am I the only one who can hear them?

[Chorus:]
I hear the voices of disaster
The cries of agony and pain
Now mother nature has lost her patience
It's time to change or we will die!

The painful visions of our fate
Our time is running out but we don't seem to care
Starvation, thirst and pestilence
I cannot stop the whispering in my head.

Am I going mad?
Am I insane?
Am I the only one who can hear them?

[Chorus:]
I hear the voices of disaster
The cries of agony and pain
Now mother nature has lost her patience
It's time to change or we will die!

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
I hear the voices of disaster
The cries of agony and pain
Now mother nature has lost her patience
It's time to change or we will die!
