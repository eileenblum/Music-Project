Through the perils of a corrupted world
We struggle to survive
As the rain of a thousand plagues
Fall upon our haggard minds

Everything comes with a price tag
Anyone can be bought
So tell me son...
What's the price of your soul?

[Chorus:]
Can you tell the difference
Between illusion and bitter truth
Do you dare to recognize
The pain around you, the agony
Can you see the final lie?
There's something rotting, it's deep within
What'll be left of your pillaged soul?
When all you love has finally died

CAN YOU TELL...

Now crumbling from inside our gaunted souls
They're screaming in pain
The blood in our veins will turn to black
And our hearts will turn to stone

I will grant all of your wishes
Any lust or desire
Don't hesitate
You just pay with your soul

[Chorus:]
Can you tell the difference
Between illusion and bitter truth
Do you dare to recognize
The pain around you, the agony
Can you see the final lie?
There's something rotting, it's deep within
What'll be left of your pillaged soul?
When all you love has finally died

CAN YOU TELL...

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
Can you tell the difference
Between illusion and bitter truth
Do you dare to recognize
The pain around you, the agony
Can you see the final lie?
There's something rotting, it's deep within
What'll be left of your pillaged soul?
When all you love has finally died
