Mentally molded
Slaves with invisible chains
Your salvation in labour
Victims of the grand illusion

[Pre-Chorus:]
Prophets of economy
Preaching the only truth
Live your life in ignorance
Stay in line don't be fool
We keep you slumbering
With drugs and cable TV
So sleep, sleep, sleep...

[Chorus:]
Dream on - Dream on

Kingdom of corruption
Realm of bribery and crime
There's no limit to what we'll do
Living life by our own laws

[Pre-Chorus:]
Prophets of economy
Preaching the only truth
Live your life in ignorance
Stay in line don't be fool
We keep you slumbering
With drugs and cable TV
So sleep, sleep, sleep...

[Chorus:]
Dream on - Dream on
