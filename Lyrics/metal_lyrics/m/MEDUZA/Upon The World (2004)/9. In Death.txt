Fairest of them all
Stunning beyond all belief
Radiant as a shiny star
Goddesses they envied her

Jealous rage
A malevolent and ferocious curse
The mortal beauty turned grotesque
So veil that men would turn to stone

Cries of pain
The desperate tears of anguish
There's no mercy for the damned

[Chorus:]
Forever cursed
Turn every man to stone
One glance and you'll be gone

In agony and pain
In shadows you will fall
An endless quest for death

A dream that never ends
A pain that speaks from hell
You'll know you've turned to stone,
Turned to stone

A monstrous beast
Living like a castaway
The bitterness has grown to rage
She's given in to endless hate

Cries of pain
The desperate tears of anguish
There's no mercy for the damned

[Chorus:]
Forever cursed
Turn every man to stone
One glance and you'll be gone

In agony and pain
In shadows you will fall
An endless quest for death

A dream that never ends
A pain that speaks from hell
You'll know you've turned to stone

Beauty's gone
All that's left is memories
Infinite atrocity
Only death can set her free

Cries of pain
The desperate tears of anguish
There's no mercy for the damned

[Chorus:]
Forever cursed
Turn every man to stone
One glance and you'll be gone

In agony and pain
In shadows you will fall
An endless quest for death

A dream that never ends
A pain that speaks from hell
You'll know you've turned to stone,
Turned to stone
