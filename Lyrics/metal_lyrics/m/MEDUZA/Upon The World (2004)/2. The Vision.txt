Visions of starving souls
Emotional zombies
Hear them call

Cultural misery
they're in so much pain
They cannot see

Trapped in this web of lies
There's no escape
Nowhere to hide

A prisoners paradise
Finding it safer
To live this life

[Pre-Chorus:]
But there is hope for us
The vision shows two ways to go
Letting us know
Which way to go

[Chorus:]
Power of the mind
Source of creativity
Search and you will find
The power of your mind

The screams of drowning souls
In the desolate ocean
Os scattered dreams

Grinded to fit the mold
Adjust to the system
Or you will die

Obedience is the law
You live your life
In constant fear

The prescence of betrayal
Shh be quiet
The walls have ears

[Pre-Chorus:]
But there is hope for us
The vision shows two ways to go
Letting us know
Which way to go

[Chorus:]
Power of the mind
Source of creativity
Search and you will find
The power of your mind
