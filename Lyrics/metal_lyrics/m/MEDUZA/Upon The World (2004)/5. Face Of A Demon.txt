I feel the fury coming
Riding a storm
For every evil deed we do
It is breaking a chain

Turning brother against brother
Driving mankind insane
Cast the world into madness
Take a look behind your eyes and you will see...

[Chorus:]
The face of a demon
The face of a demon

We have to recognize it
Before it's too late
We have to realize it
It feeds our pain

Turning brother against brother
Driving mankind insane
Cast the world into madness
Take a look behind your eyes and you will see...

[Chorus:]
The face of a demon
The face of a demon
