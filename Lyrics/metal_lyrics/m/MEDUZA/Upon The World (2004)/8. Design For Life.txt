Searching for something we don't understand
A code to dimensions without access
Who am I, I believe that the key is only a mystery

Trading places where we have to confess
Shadows of quicksand trying to caress me
Again, with its lies, with its cries, with its effrontery

Justify the supreme you'll never find
Don't require, the utopia of nothingness

[Chorus:]
Through space and time we ride, from a strange life we hide
In this isolated shape of stony buildings we have made
Still strife remains

The stars our destiny, who can tell we'll ever find the keys
There's no turning back to change slavery and grief for real
A new design for life

A design for life (A design for life)
A design for life (A design for life)

Who has the knowledge to all mankind?
It can be the visions from senses around
In this world, spirits fall to the ground, eternal misery

Misery mourns to be devoured
Declension is giving faith a detour
Apply the brakes, oh to stop, causes death
In this stage of hegemony

Justify and require seeing reality
Rectify the rules to free us from the agony

[Chorus:]
Through space and time we ride, from a strange life we hide
In this isolated shape of stony buildings we have made
Still strife remains

The stars our destiny, who can tell we'll ever find the keys
There's no turning back to change slavery and grief for real
A new design for life

A design for life (A design for life)
A design for life (A design for life)
