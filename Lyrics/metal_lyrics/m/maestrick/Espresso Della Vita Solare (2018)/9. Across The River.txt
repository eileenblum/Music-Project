(2:00 AM)

Sometimes we find ourselves lost in a haze
Navigating to the end of the day
Our path has changed
What can we say?
Our path has changed
Are we the same?

Every time the wind blows against us
Forcing us to cross a feared gate
Where dry leaves come
Even in spring
Where dry leaves come
Even we sing:
Oh, please forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespass against us
And lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
Hey man!
There's a life waiting for us
Across the river

[Solo]

Don't waste your time without love
Spend your time with someone you care for
Don't waste your time without love
Understand the meaning of sharing
Don't waste your time without love
Unknown roads need unknown steps
Don't waste your time without love
Be the light where darkness comes
Don't waste your time without love

I don't want to make more money
At all!
Instead of live a life of peace
At all!
Fighting with the wind and waters
At all!
A soul traded for success
At all!

Before that mountain there's a river
At all!
And this river lives in me
At all!
It will take me to a horizon
My reality

There's a life waiting for us
Beyond the river
A new life waiting for us
Across the river
Across this river

I am the river
