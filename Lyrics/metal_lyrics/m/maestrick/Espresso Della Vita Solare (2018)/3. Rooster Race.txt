(8:00 AM)

Rise from bed awaken!
The window is no more closed
Hear the rooster crow!
Are you waiting, are you waiting for what kind of call?

Wash your face and hurry
'Cause life don't wait no one
We been running, we been running since the day we're born over an endless road
Chasing after a future that's beyond the waterspout
So dress the horizon and run!

There is a truth about life
Every man deserves a future to be proud of
So come, run by my side
Together we can go farther
Than run alone this rooster race

Hey! Let's drink some coffee and have a piece of apple pie
And milk taken from the cow
"Maiada Ã© o nome dela"

We been running, we been running since the day we're born
Day we're born

Chasing after a future that's beyond the waterspout
When you're far enough to forget, look inside and find

Far from the town, there is a field
With orchards adorning the course of the creeks
There's nothing more, simple and real
Than go back to the place where time stood still

There is a truth about life
Every man deserves a future to be proud of
So come run by my side
Once you were born in this land
It never leaves your heart my friend

Alright, I'll be nice
There is no way to go back in time
So enjoy the farm wagon
Time goes fast to all of us on the train
The time goes fast, enjoy your life
Time goes fast to all of us on the train
Making us alive

Now in the town, far from that field
There's no more orchards adorning the creeks
For one last time let's run with me
Back to the place where time stood still

There is a truth about life
Every man deserves a future to be proud of
So come, run by my side
Once you were born in this land
You never lose the rooster race
I'll win
