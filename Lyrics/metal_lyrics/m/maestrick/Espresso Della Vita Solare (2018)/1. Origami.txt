Hey my friend
Here we go again
After all these years
We're back now on a train
Yes, sir!

Hurry now!
The story will fit somehow
Keep the ticket on your hands
And get on the train

The brighter sun connection
It's the most famous machine
The rails will guide
Then will align
The night and the day
The learner and the master
I need to follow... oh...

Good bye my friend!
