(9:00 AM)

I wake up in the morning and John gimme a hug
It's a good thing, you know, but not to be on the news

Our lives are being written
Every day on the pages on the Daily View

Misses Dita raised alone her five kids
But a futile party may have more page views
Oh, we need more love
More empathy
Not only stupid headlines
Words without content

But it's not late a new day is just beginning
Make it better with good tidings before it's too late

Our lives are being written
Every day with the question: "Why a lot of news?"

Change your view!
