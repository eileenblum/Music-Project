(11:00 AM)

From the morning mist
A man rises
Watchful eyes, clenched fists
He would die for his land

Work is a gift
Endeavour
For him luck it's just a myth
A bare superstition
A mind system of rules we've obeyed since our childhood

Honestly, all that could be said I that everyone can change a truth in life
And make the universe crack

Keep trying, trying
And believe in hard work
Keep trying, trying
Raise your head and be strong
After the night the sun will burn

And nothing can pull you down
Anyone can say, "You can't!"
Even genes can't define
And tell how the story ends

Time to time, someone will say bad things
To confuse and make you weak
But don't let them say
No one can stop you!

Your mind will send you signals
Moving pictures walk through hemispheres:
"Tom saw her in the red bar, shit, at 2112, Overture Street"

Left to the right as a ghost rides
Right to the left what's left is right
Left to the right, to leave behind
It lets you define the real self-knowledge

Honestly, all that could be said
Is that everyone can change a truth in life
And make a whole universe crack

Keep trying, trying
And believe in hard work
Keep trying, trying
Raise your head and be strong
Trying, just keep trying
Plant seeds of love
After the night the sun will spread all its light

So, keep trying!
