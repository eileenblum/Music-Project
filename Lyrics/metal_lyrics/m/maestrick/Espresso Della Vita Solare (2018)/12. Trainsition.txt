[1st Scene â The Event]

[Instrumental]

[2nd Scene â The Prison]

Silence, calm the emotions that are still running on this noisy street after the crash
An angel call, brought me back to conscious, thank God I've survived but something is still wrong

Memories fading away
Raining â and as the water touches my face I cannot tell you if it's warm or cold
The angel again, "Darling, can you move your left hand out of this flash flood?" "Oh, I can't!"

Jailed
Is this all real?
Pain all I could feel

[3rd Scene â The Chair]

Lord? Why is this happening to me?
Where do I belong? Tell me now!
Give me a pill and make me please wake up!

Getting lighter
Even with the pain I felt calm
How could I feel that peace?

[4th Scene â Transcending]

Every hour of my day
I want to break free from this chain
My wagon is called miracle
Come and join us

I am at peace with my fate
There's no effort that is in vain
I believe in the gift of work
I will make it

So dry your tears forget the sorrow
When it seems there is no tomorrow

I will climb every mountain
And no matter what they say about my reality
I will climb every mountain
An no matter what they say
I will reach my goal
Reach my goal

Do you believe in faith? â I believe
Do you believe in love? â I believe
Do you believe in pray? â I believe
Do you believe in soul? â Oh, I believe

I believe in waves â we believe
Flowing through the world â we believe
I believe that faith â we believe
Can lift us higher to the sun

I will climb every mountain
And no matter what they say about my reality
I will climb every mountain
And no matter what they say
I will not give up myself
Nevermore

[5th Scene â The Awakening]

Now I'm lighter and the pain I felt
Brought me strength to believe
So I surrender to the travel to know the stations where the sun can't touch

[6th Scene â The Monologue]

So, here I am
At the edge of day and night again
Hear my voice
Echoing alone a farewell melody to the sun

[Unspoken lyrics:]
The rails will guide and then will align
The day and the night
The master and the learner
Sometimes we have to know the darkness
To better see the shine of the stars
