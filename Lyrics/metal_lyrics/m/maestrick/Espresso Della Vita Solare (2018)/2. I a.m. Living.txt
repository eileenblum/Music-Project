(7:00 AM)

How amazing it is
A new journey starts from now
I've been waiting
Since the day I've landed for the last time

There's a Sir who believes in miracles
Sitting next to a man without beliefs
And a boy that is faster than a bullet
From a city where fire guns don't exist

I am living on the train of life
I am living on the train of life
To find the light and let it shine

On an empty armchair
A newspaper named Daily View
With its phrases changing
It's confusing but the message lies beyond the words
I am!
I am living on the train of life
I am living on the train of life
Here's the light, let it shine!

I am certain that every horizon and curve
Will bring the echo of love
On the rails of my veins runs a spark o' life that grows in every heart
Through the hours of the day

I am living on the train of life
I am living on the train of life
Back to the point where my essence has begun
The miracle of life reveals itself
I am living on the train of life
In the lines of Paradise

Come as a guest
Please sit
Here's your place, feel free

Every station has stories and lessons to be heard
