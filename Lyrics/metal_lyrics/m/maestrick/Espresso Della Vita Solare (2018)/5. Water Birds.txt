(10:00 AM)

A fresh wind
They come
Whistling their songs
Bringers of beauty
Keepers of lore

A silent wave
Where science and faith
Cross an old bridge
Long forgotten

Through the ages they're reborn
To alert mankind and restore
An old conscience flows as rivers and oceans
A real aria of nature

Water birds come to clean our feelings
Flying over the hills
Above the pristine and shinning blue sea
Avatars of the nature
They bring us inspiration
To live the art of life
In a better way
Water birds

"Nature is singing her swan song
By the conduction of men
It's the final act
There's no turning back"

Pure breeze they're here
To wash our tears
Lighting the path of all that was gone
Through the ages they're reborn
To alert mankind and restore
A new conscience flows ad rivers and oceans
An invitation to play a symphony of nature

Water birds come to clean our feelings
Flying over the hills
Above the pristine and shinning blue sea
Avatars of the nature
They bring us inspiration
To live the art of life
In a better way
Water birds

Water birds come to clean our feelings
Flying over the hills
Above the pristine and shinning blue sea
(Water birds sing the song to keep the light shinning)
Avatars of the nature
They bring us inspiration
To live the art of life
In a better way
(Water birds sing the song to keep the light shinning)
Water birds
