(1:00 PM)

Galloping over the mountains
Riding away from the hills
Faster as thunder he sings "aiÃª" sings "aiÃ´"
Cowboy

No one can catch him and his horse
I tell you like him there's no one
An arrow that only reaches bulls eye
He's the law

From now on, from the past, stories been told
Heroes and bandits, the hairy and the bald
Cowboys, red skins, an era made of gold
How can we miss things that we never had?

One day a bad mad guy
Walked into the Morricone Saloon
He dared to defy the fast cowboy
Scabby dog challenged him to a duel
From now on, from the past, stories been told
Heroes and bandits, the hairy and the bald
Cowboys, red skins, and era made of gold
How can we miss things we never had?

As the hour passed everyone spread
The news of the duel between good and bad
And what about the ugly one?
Farmers locked the cattle and the saloon closed
All the wild west folks stopped
Because the duel would begin

Cowboy, cowboy, he won but nobody saw
They heard only the shout of the gun
Cowboy, cowboy, shooting so fast all of them screamed,
"Our new sheriff is hereâ¦ but where?!"
