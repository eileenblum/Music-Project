[Part I â Amaterasu No Tabi]

"From the east she comes
The brightest and purest of the lights
Vigilant source of infinite wisdom
The journey has begun"

Before the words about the dove and the crow
A man and his kaleidoscope
Wondered the future in a lotus field
When a drop of light kissed the ground
There was the seed

[Part II â Ikebana]

A tree would be born
A tree would be born
In the zenith of a crown
That does not contemplate just one
A secret revealed

Carrying the world's weight on his shoulders
His legs tremble
But do not fall apart

He knows, will come a time
When every blind will see
By their pure hearts will be chosen
To cross the righteous path
By the laws of nature
Tasting sour and sweet

[Part III â Obusaba]

A new glance at the morning line
Contemplates a shade
The silhouette of the greatest tree of life
Ancient as the first songs known
Source of all the creed, geometry and myths

Growing day by day
Fed by sunlight
Roots in many lands
Unifying all to one
And one to all

Why search outside of paradise?
If a universe can be found inside a nut
Allow yourself and you'll find
A sacred garden, house of the dove
and refuge of the crow

[Part IV â Kansoku]

Reign without end or beginning
Splendor of jewels, one star
Is the sacred guide of men

Growing day by day
Fed by sunlight
His bare feet aligned
Make a shade, a silhouette
On the ground that carries him
His legs tremble again
But he is rooted
Strong but losing the sense
Deafâ¦
Blindâ¦
Dumbâ¦
Senseless

[Part V â Ken o Togi]

[Instrumental]

[Part VI â Taiketsu]

[Instrumental]

[Part VII â Reflection (Seppuku)]

"Visita Interiorem
Terrae Rectificando
Invenies Occultum Lapidem"

In a room with low light
A life broken, twice
The old and the new reflected the same

As a worm in a hole
The crow turns to the dove
And envy the light it emanates

Every chosen one carries the burden of the choice
Every chosen one, everyone has a choiceâ¦

[Part VIII â Restoration]

A sound arrived and touched his ears
A whisper voice proclaimed his new name
Blood flowing again inside his veins
A strong heart beating again
"Give him the light!
Open your eyes!"

In the land of the rising sun
A tree was born
In the inner temple of a sacred star
In the land of the rising sun a life reborn to become the rising sun

In the zenith of his life
He tries to contemplate the world
And realizes that (the one) who loves the part
Is the one who loves the all

In the land of the rising sun
A congregation has begun
Beauty, justice and perfection
Columns of an inner temple

[Part IX â Confirmation]

[Instrumental]

[Part X â The Saint Communion]

Every day we are born again
And see the morning light
Through that kaleidoscope once again

Glowing day by day
To warm and edify
He is the sunlight
You and I aligned
In communion with the all
And all to one

Why search outside of paradise?
If a universe can be found inside a nut
Allow yourself and you will find
A sacred garden, house of the dove and refuge of the crow

[Part XI â Kaizen]

'Cause we are the weight of the world we hold
We are the lovers, the loved ones and the own love
We are the gardener, the seed and the tree
Three in one, one in three!

[Part XII â Keizen]

[Instrumental]
