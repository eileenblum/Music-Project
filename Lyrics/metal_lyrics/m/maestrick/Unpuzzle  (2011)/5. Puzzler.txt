I am the master of illusion - puzzler!
The incomplete metaphor of the deconstruction
Are your lives rolling, rolling again? rolling over again...
If when your life is on fire
And you are your lawyer, make desire
And I'll come to dissolve all (of) your knots
Fire against fire, I'm your new lawyer
Make a desire and I'll give you more than a genie in a lamp
More more than a genie in a lamp! lamb?
If you need more than just derision
I'll give you different forms to turn you on
Infinite forms to turn you on, it works like this
When you ask yourself: "should i stay, or should i run?"
I'll appear from inside you and one card you'll have to choose
To have a life like a grand emperor with glory and...
"sans plus adjectives!" hahaha!
If when your life is on fire and you are your own lawyer
Make a desire and I'll give you more than genie in a lamp
More, more than a genie in a lamp
He's the puzzler!
