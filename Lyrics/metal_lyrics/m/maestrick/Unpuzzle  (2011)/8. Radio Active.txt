Sanity, obsession, mental projection
What do you want for dessert?
Lunatic apprehension, war-like corporation
Marching to the station ahead!
8:15 in the morning, a little boy was falling
Since that day humanity is not the same
Syntonize your actions to the world's resurrection
Out of the blue, humanity would lose their purity
Walls disappearing and the clock will never turn back again
Radio active
Radioactive
20:15 at night h.t invites you to eat, nice?
Wake up you are the dessert!
Scientific fiction, nuclear atomic fission
E=mÂ·cÂ²
Walls disappearing and the clock will never turn back again
Radio active, radio
