[Part I - Silence Of The Queen]

I will tell you a secret

A deep drop of something I belong to
And it will wake up soon
Inside of us
From the ink you came alive

To bring color to bring light
This Aquarela sounds like this
There exists a Queen dressed in red
She was so sweet now she's mad

And a man that she gave
Her heart and soul to
One day the doubt came to their lives
And the eccentric showed his cards

But the truth is unique
Every card anyone chooses would be wrong
(Clock!)
The horror is coming hurry up

Open the chest and grab the brush
Answers for it will be explained
Until the clock stops running again
Until the clock stops running again

[Part II - Words from the Alchemist]

All my life I've passed waiting
The formula to never live
But without friends there's no life
You pass in stealth

But how I was sayingâ¦
The cheater won and separated them
Throw in the road the innocent man
The pretty lady changed so fast
She built a circus, you know the rest

Have you ever, Have you ever seen?
All of these colors painting now all your life
When dark it seems
It's just close your eyes
And don't give up

Have you ever, Have you ever seen?
All of these colors painting now all your life
When dark it seems
All you search
Is inside of you
Life is an Aquarela
So come on pick up the brush
And paint
