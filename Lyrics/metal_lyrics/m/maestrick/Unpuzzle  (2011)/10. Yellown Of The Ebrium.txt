Watching the moon of the year being taken by that knife
I awake in the evening of fault nothing to care to worry
I'm a lamb in a skin of wolf
He came wabbling by the side of sidewalk
"they have secrets"
I like you!
He barely had started to understand himself
And he already said he was used with to the routine
Watching the moon he can't hear
Being taken by the life he is forsaken on the eve of the great day
Both were partners
Martyrs
He and the drunkenness
I'd give you the stars, and if you want to
I'd give you the night but he was the day, and all he wanted was the sunshine

Olha, vem o circo, vem chegando
Olha, a colombina de papel. vem o pierrÃ´ apaixonado
Sonha, sabiÃ¡, senhor do cÃ©u
Olha, vem andando pela esquina
O ser que sonhou em nÃ£o ser
E com seu coraÃ§Ã£o amarrotado pensa em dizer
Sonha, vai sonhando, o sonho te acordou
Olha nos meus olhos eterno amor

Oh, darling, darling, why did she come?
Two souls are bleeding as one
Oh, darling, darling, what did she do?
The queen is building her throne
Oh, darling, darling
