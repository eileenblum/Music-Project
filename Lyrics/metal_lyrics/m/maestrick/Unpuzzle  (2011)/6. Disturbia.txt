Hurry slowly from my own mind's town
Every brick i reach a memory falls
False expectations "stop! you can continue"
But don't ask yourself: "can this be real?"
All the little I'd have to tell you'd be
Commitment isn't a part of me
So finally i would tell you:
"the silence is screaming so loud inside of me!"
And the words i have said
They're hunting me

Oh we don't believe you
Oh we don't believe we swear
Oh we can't believe you
We cannot believe
'cause I'm every brick in that damn wall

In the moment of paranoia
Everything you see beyond yourself
Is what you can't see
Megalomania, persecuting, hello-cination
Slowly you have to run from this darkness
Where the light tries to give its last breath
Here is the absence and i tell you it's real
As this masonry unfinishes
You must imagine a place away from here
Until my last memory disappears
Now I'm trying to hold all i can
Falling from on high a scar, a man

Two doors, one for each
Heart, one for each
Flame in me
Bounds fall apart
All that's been
Left is dried lake
I've tried to swim
I swear that
All the words
I have said
They're hunting me
They're alive and are listening

Oh we don't believe in you
Oh we don't believe we swear
Oh we can't believe you

Now the man needs to forget
All the words that he said
They're hunting him

Oh we don't believe you
Oh we don't believe swear
Oh we don't believe you
Oh we can't believe you
