A bird with wings to fly and touch, every heaven she wants to know
And when she closes her eyes she asks
How could the feeling come so fast?

A man that from he is can see all the beauty of the world
And when he closes his eyes he asks
How could this feeling come so fast?

And I don't know why I'm wrong
And I don't know why I'm wrong
I've found my treasure,
Has it found me?

The man and the bird think like one
But there's a feeling, there's a real way,
There's a way for man to find the bird

An invisible mountain separates them
But there's a feeling, there's another way,
There's a way for man to find the bird

And I don't know why I'm wrong
And I don't know why I'm wrong
I've found my treasure without a map

Hanna - HanauÃª
[mantra choir]

And I don't know why I'm wrong
And I don't know why I'm wrong

And I don't know why I'm wrong
And I don't know why I'm wrong

No matter with whom you are,
No matter how,
The man now can see
(and all he see is the bird)
...And I wish to your life
The treasure... Of your world!
