He's a fairy feller

The fairy folk have gathered round the new moon shine
To see the feller crack a nut at nights noon time
To swing his ace he swears, as it climbs he dares
To deliver
The master-stroke!

Ploughman, Waggoner Will, and types
Politician with senatorial pope
He's a dilly-dally-o
Pedagogue squinting, wears a frown
And a satyr peers under lady's gown
Dirty fellow
What a dirty laddio
Tatterdemalion and a junketer
There's a thief and a dragonfly trumpeter
He's my hero
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy of his lady friend
The nymph in yellow 'can we see the master-stroke'
What a quaere fellow

Soldier, sailor, tinker, tailor, ploughboy
Waiting to hear the sound
And the arch-magician presides
He is the leader
Oberon and Titania watched by a harridan
Mab is the queen and there's a good apothecary-man
Come to say hello
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy of his lady friend
The nymph in yellow
What a quaere fellow

The ostler stares with hands on his knees
Come on, Mr. Feller, crack it open if you please

I reign with my left hand, I rule with my right
I'm lord of all darkness, I'm queen of the night
I've got the power, now do the march of the black queen
(my life is in your hands, I'll fo and I'll fie)
I'll be what you make me, I'll do what you like
I'll be a bad boy, I'll be your bad boy
I'll do the march of the black queen

Walking true to style
She's vulgar 'buse and vile
Fie-fo the black queen tattoos all her pies
She boils and she bakes and she never dots her 'I's

Anyway the wind blows
