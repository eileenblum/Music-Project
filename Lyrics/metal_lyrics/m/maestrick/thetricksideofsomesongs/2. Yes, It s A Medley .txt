Soon, oh, soon the light
Pass within and soothe the endless night
And waiting for you
Our reason to be here

Soon, oh, soon the time
All we move to gain will reach and calm
Our heart is open
Our reason to be here

Long ago, set into rhyme

A seasoned witch could call you
From the depths of your disgrace
And rearrange your liver
To the solid mental grace

And achieve it all with music
That came quickly from afar
Then taste the fruit of man recorded
Losing all against the hour

And assessing points to nowhere, leading every single one
A dewdrop can exalt us like the music of the sun
And take away the plain in which we move
And choose the course you're running

Down at the edge, round by the corner
Not right away, not right away
Close to the edge, down by a river
Not right away, not right away

Crossed the line around the changes of the summer
Reaching out to call the color of the sky
Passed around a moment clothed in mornings faster than we see
Getting over all the time I had to worry
Leaving all the changes far from far behind
We relieve the tension only to find out the master's name

Down at the end, round by the corner
Close to the edge, just by a river
Seasons will pass you by
I get up, I get down
Now that it's all over and done
Now that you find, now that you're whole

Second nature sings to me
Some days it's a dark world let it be
I define my right to be
I can follow those who've lost their vision

And every time I hold your hand
You redesign my promised land
I live for you, this promised land
I live for you

You are the song from the book of time
To realize what is yours is mine
We are meant to be
All because our love has always been
You are the center of my day
You are my guide in every way
We are meant to be
All because our love has always been there

Giving me the light
Yes it's been there
Giving me the light

Give love each day

You are the center of my day
You are my guide in every way
We are meant to be
All because our love has always
