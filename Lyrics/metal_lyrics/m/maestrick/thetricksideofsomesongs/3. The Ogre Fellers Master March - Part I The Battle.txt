Now once upon a time
An old man told me a fable
When the piper is gone
And the soup is cold upon the table
And if the black crow flies
Find a new destination
That is the sign

Come tonight
Come to the ogre site
Come to ogre battle fight

He gives a great big cry
And he can swallow up the ocean
With mighty tongue he catches flies
And the palm of his hand incredible size

One great big eye
Has to focus in your direction
Now the battle is on
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Come tonight
Come to the ogre site
Come to ogre battle fight

The ogre men are still inside
The two way mirror mountain
You gotta keep down
Right out of sight
You can't see in but they can see out

Keep a look out
The ogre men are coming out
From the two way mirror mountain
They're running up behind
And they're coming all about
Can't go east 'cause you gotta go south

Ogre men are going home
The great big fight is over
Bugle blow, let trumpet cry
Ogre battle lives forever more

Oh, oh, oh
You can come along
You can come along
Come to ogre battle
