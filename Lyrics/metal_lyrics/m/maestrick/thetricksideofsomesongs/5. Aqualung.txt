Sitting on a park bench
Eyeing little girls with bad intent
Snot running down his nose
Greasy fingers smearing shabby clothes

Hey, Aqualung
Drying in the cold sun
Watching as the frilly panties run

Hey, Aqualung
Feeling like a dead duck
Spitting out pieces of his broken luck
Wow, Aqualung

Sun streaking cold
An old man wandering lonely
Taking time the only way he knows
Leg hurting bad
As he bends to pick a dog-end
He goes down to the bog and warms his feet

Feeling alone
The army's up the road
Salvation a la mode and a cup of tea
Aqualung, my friend
Don't start away uneasy
You poor old sod, you see, was only me

Do you still remember
December's foggy freeze?
When the ice that
Clings on to your beard
Was screaming agony

And you snatch your rattling last breaths
With deep-sea-diver sounds
And the flowers bloom like
Madness in the spring

Sun streaking cold
An old man wandering lonely
Taking time the only way he knows
Leg hurting bad
As he bends to pick a dog-end
He goes down to the bog and warms his feet

Feeling alone
The army's up the road
Salvation a la mode and a cup of tea
Aqualung, my friend
Don't start away uneasy
You poor old sod, you see, was only me

Aqualung, my friend
Don't start away uneasy
You poor old sod, you see, it's only me

Sitting on a park bench
Eyeing little girls with bad intent
Snot running down his nose
Greasy fingers smearing shabby clothes

Hey, Aqualung
Drying in the cold sun
Watching as the frilly panties run

Hey, Aqualung
Feeling like a dead duck
Spitting out pieces of his broken luck
Hey Aqualung

Oh, Aqualung
