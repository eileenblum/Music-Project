Sickness that will never heal 
Sickness that all do fear
Sickness that haunts forever 
Sickness that will surely kill 
Through sickness, fragrant rose 
All the ones you hold close 
Through sickness, lust, passion 
Through sickness all is lost 

Pen that writes, the pen that bleeds 
Most atrocious crimson seas, upon much darker memories 

Your death was pointless, blood is advertised 
Bread sold to the homeless 
Purity raped from whatâs divine 
Sickness like possession deep in the crossings of your soul 
There is no savior
When it comes to invert your purest thoughts 
Recall all their convictions, fire to the crafts 
Myth is all thatâs sacred
Letters from an illusional past 
Pen that writes, the pen that bleeds 
Most atrocious crimson seas upon much darker memories
