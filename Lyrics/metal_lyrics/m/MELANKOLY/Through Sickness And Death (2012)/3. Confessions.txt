Years past but still grief 
Shows no certain end
Crippled in the corner
Faith he could not stand

Abandoned by his heart
His Soul past with the dead
Sanity fades
Behind the tears he shed 

Soulless being, decade mind 
Faint shadows of his virtue 
Nightmares thus, rabid, lust 
What has it all come down to?
Some nights he killed in silence 
Some nights he made them shout 
Now that he feels no more 
How dark will this night turn out?

Made them scream 
In the most sadistic theme 
No pity in his heart 
Confessions of a mad man 
Came from behind 
Non hesitant right 
No mercy in his heart
Confessions of a mad man 

Soulless being, decade mind 
Faint shadows of his virtue 
Nightmares thus, rabid, lust 
What has it all come down to?
Some nights he killed in silence 
Some nights he made them shout 
Now that he feels no more 
How dark will this night turn out?

Pointlessly kneeling 
In a two sided wooden box 
A being with twisted thoughts 
Against a more sinful preacher
