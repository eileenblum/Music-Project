Follow no higher power
Beware of their disguise 
Believe in no promise freedom 
 Nor their myths nor their lies 
Mere slaves of their own ways 
I am not what you are
The solitude in torture 
Beware of all their lies 

Thrown in a cage 
All those who disobey 
Crazy is they refuse 
Insane if they rebel 
Living like soulless aimless sheep 
All by the rules of a book 
Open your eyes embrace the obvious 
Free yourself, fear no conscience 
Fear no conscience
