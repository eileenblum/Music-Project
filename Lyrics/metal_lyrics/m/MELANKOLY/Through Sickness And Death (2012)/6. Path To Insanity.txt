Darker clouds approach 
A wretched sky 
A helpless soul  
(Itâs when destiny unfurls)
The path to insanity 
Seeking the forbidden 
For my desires 

I rode the waves of destiny 
I mastered the secrets of faith 
I tell you with the truest heart 
Its only promise is death  
All dying, all waiting 
Hopeless ways to survive 
Pathetic, degrading 
Through their fear I rise 
Sharpen the blades 
Clean the blood drenched guillotine 
Polish my axe, insanity taking over me 

Blow away the dust 
Of the scroll of prophecies 
Itâs so clear and simple 
Uncover the celestial lie
