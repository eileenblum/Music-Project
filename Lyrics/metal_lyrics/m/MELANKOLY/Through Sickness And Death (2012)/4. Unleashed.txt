Treachery lies in light, and I lay in between 
Radiant walls and ambers I once worn through the meadows and the crimes that I had scene
Roped and chained tight assuring my fate 
Drugs for my rage yet nothing for my thoughts 
Still, I deny my faith 
Wanting to be free again 

Your tears your cries your pitiful demise 
Is for the comfort of my soul 
The slaughter the crime, the stench of this night 
Is for the comfort of my own 

Through the halls of a decade life 
The rooms are filled with anger 
Driven by the hellish fire 
To roam free at night 
Unleashed upon the world 
With sharpened blades for slaughter 
He will take your soul 
The mortal reaper 
Never to be unleashed  

Only free in his dreams  
Heâs paralyzed he cannot speak 
His passion still burns so strong 
Hands tied all alone 
Prosecuted as a beast 
The verdict ruled his faith is sealed 
Several counts first degree 
Heâll be hung tomorrow on the street
