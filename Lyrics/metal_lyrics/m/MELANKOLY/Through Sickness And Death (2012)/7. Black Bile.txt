Realize what is true to your soul lapsing in unending gloom 
Voices urge these thoughts so soon 
Still conscious forbidding you 
Visions lead, an uneven beat 
Deep stained shroud at wrist 
Forcing visions true 
Still conscious forbidding you 

Timely pleasures nightly comfort 
Black bile present in excess 
Timely waves of nightly poison 
Fade away in your nonsense 
Drop the knife, Timely pleasures nightly comfort 
Drift away, Feel the breeze in total silence
