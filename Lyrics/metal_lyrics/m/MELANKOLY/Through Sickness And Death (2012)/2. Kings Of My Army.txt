Ever since the creation of masters 
Youâre controlled by mortal leaders 
Follow adapt under my guidance
Youâll see the dark aspects of yourself 

Methods refined over centuries 
Turning you to kings of my army 
Go and practice all given tasks 
Those who survive and the free will pass 

I am a king imbued by my glory 
I seek, I know, thus understand 
Iâll die before submitting to anyone 
This is the pride of kings.
