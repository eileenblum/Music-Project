You're cruisin' around. It's Friday night. There's nothing to do and there's no one in sight. But you heard about a party going on. So you get a case of beer and party down - party down. We crash in your front door. Your kitchen table's is our home page. We got two days, so we're here to stay. A bunch of drunken mutants wastes. You didn't invite us and that's okay and I don't think we're gonna leave. Spots on the floor, holes in the walls. Sick with the dry heaves. But it's expected, we're the PARTY ANIMALS. Stay up and party all night. Party animal. Intoxication that's our plight. Driving down the street, what do I see. A concert at L'Amour's with M.O.D. Now Larry is God and he's mixing sound. And Brian North is there too to Party Down, party down. We crash in your front door. Your kitchen table's is our home page. We got two days, so we're here to stay. A bunch of drunken mutants wastes. You didn't invite us and that's okay and I don't think we're gonna leave. Spots on the floor, holes in the walls. Sick with the dry heaves. But it's expected, we're the PARTY ANIMALS. Stay up and party all night. Party animal. Intoxication that's our plight.
