Driving to the beach. Gonna check out the waves. Waxin' up my board for the pipeline craze. I'm dreamin' that I'm riding to the top of the crest. And a six pack of Milwaukee's best. I finish my ride and paddle back out. Turn round-raise without a wipe out. And that's how it goes. Surfin' you know. Party my life away. Let's hit the beach - surf's up. Suck down some brews - surf's up. Shoot through the pier - surf's up. Hanging ten, walk the boards, shoot through the pipe. Surfing everyday - everyday of my life. Got nothing to do and nowhere to go. Don't see a future. Don't even know. And that's how it goes. Surfin' you know. Party my life away. Let's hit the beach - surf's up. Suck down some brews - surf's up. Shoot through the pier - surf's up.
