Divided are my ways
In a law breaking state in the last fatal days
Feeding on remorse will not solve my case
I won't be constrained
I must extract my thoughts
To peel off this shell
I must find the answers
To keep me from self destruct

As I looked for the light
With no sense of sight
With senseless pain
Left nothing to gain
As we fought for our lives
With the demons of hate
To fulfill our existence
To burst through this gate

My eccentric perspective on this fucking world
This illusion cult played with my life (but no more)
It fades away the words I phrase
To brake these walls In my own ways
In that hole in that dark, out of that shell that remained

I shall remain

Destroy my inner destructive self
Reason won't concuss the irrevocable
I've lost all sense of purity

The wall that they raised
The extraction has gone too far
The rage has awakened
The border means nothing anymore
This god damned nation
This truth that I blame
The rage has awakened
Leaves nothing in-sane
