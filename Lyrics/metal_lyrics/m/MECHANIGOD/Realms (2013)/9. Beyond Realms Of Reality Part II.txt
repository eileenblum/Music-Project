If we won't think of ourselves once in a while...
Get out from our hollow-guiltless life, look outside the box.
Feel! Watch! Be alert! Because we are all falling apart.
Rise! Be proud! Be a leader.
Don't let life "cage" you, like a hopeless rat.
"None are more hopeless and enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free"
You have to believe it, feel it; consume it -
You are alive!
