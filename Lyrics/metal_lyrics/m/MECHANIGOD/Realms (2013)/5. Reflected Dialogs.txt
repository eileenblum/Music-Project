Soldiers of god gather and follow
The smell of weakness and betrayal
Curse the holy mirror
Your reflection forever decays

Sunrise is years away
Moments of life pass us by
Tools of salvation take flight on a leather wings
Drowned in sand and dust
Death is greeting you to a world full of lies and silence
All of your masks are rising from the past to protect your sanity

Soldiers of god gather and follow
The smell of weakness and betrayal
Curse the holy mirror
Your reflection forever decays

If I couldn't see before
I see quite clearly now
My heart will beat no more
For my eyes will close-forever and I will be god
This is god's realm where our lies are settled and real
My sanity has been sold by this reflection of reality

Curse the holy mirror
Your reflection forever decays

Man's perversion goes beyond his own imagination
I have found the edge
We wish to be alone with my god

My thoughts left as a burden on my soul
Sweeping minds through pain and lust
Disappointment of the body from the soul
I wish to be alone with my essence
