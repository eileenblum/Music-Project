By the ocean rise
Floating on the lies.
Lie within limited space
Scarred memories are used
To understand what is impossible to understand,
The more I know the less I care.
Lost as the ocean, with a shell attached upon my ear.
The more I understand
The less I know how to feel a thing.

Trying to get more and more
Trying and reaching higher and higher.
To fill (feel) nothing with nothing
Reaching the lowest edge that could ever be.

To the highest hole possible in this misery
To the highest abyss.

Perhaps it will show me a halo.
Perhaps I'll get it with me -
My silent state of mind.
