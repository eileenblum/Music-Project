Endless war - paintless blood
Remorse is no more
No more god-machine like mind
Kill your way to fame
Hide and die - kill and live
The foolish human way

The consistent battle between the two sides
The blood that they spilled
The death in their eyes
Devoted to their sins
Their vengeance drugged their minds
Burn, kill, destroy, conquer
Blood drunk; let your soul be corrupted by power
Rise - forcing your way to the cleansing
Erase all the humans who mocked your existence
Blinded by god's fake benefits and his worthless shallowed way
An endless self - eternal second with the pure minded-guiltless age
Dropped by the anchor and saved by the bell
Raped by the men-whore you're gazed by the fail
Dig to the core take the dust and inhale
Ride to their land, bring the chaos and hell

For those who can't see
I will tell all this truth
For those who can't hear
I will show all this pain
For those who deny, dead bodies can't count themselves

Why does our life lead to the dead?
Those screams are to those deaf
This blood is the mirror of the urge
The entrapment is our-selves

I've seen all the corrupted blood that became a flood
No more god-machine like minds
Kill your way to fame
Hide and die - kill and live
The rotten human way

"Fools! Fools! Fools!
When will you learn that me you can not slay.
Year after year, you burn me in this grove.
Lifting your puny shouts, of triumph to the stars...
Fools to dream you conquer care.
It's not all a dream."
