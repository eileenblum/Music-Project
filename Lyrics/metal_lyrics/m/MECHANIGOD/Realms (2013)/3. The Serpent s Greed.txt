The black ravens fly above the tree of sorrow
The field of pain and lost
The field of the lonely souls
This is the price of beauty
The taste of this curse fruit
I am this cracking log
But am I this bleeding tree?

Am I caged in the serpent's greed
Of this knowledge tree?
That's standing among thousand of slaves

The process of creation
The lies of the snake
By this cursed-poisoned apple
My mind has been raped
The god of brutality
Machine full of hate
Reducing my sins
Please give me back my faith
Knowledge, Redemption - the sins of creation

I keep my will to escape from this slavery

The serpent - is cursed by the throne

Am I caged in the serpent's greed
Of this knowledge tree?
Am I caged in the serpent's greed?
Or am I a slave?
