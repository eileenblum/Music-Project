A dream in his head
A vision
He could not hide his fear
The hope

He has seen this in the mirror
He has been the one, so he just kept waiting
But those were just the memories
otherwise no one is there
The body has gone
And still I am staring towards the blue
The silent judgment was set
He cannot overrule it
He was placed bellow the shelter
Gave his body to the silence
For us, for our future Zen
His escape, his death

As they reached to the top of the hill
Breathing heavily and exhausted
They stood up in pride
And gazed towards the sun
Reflected in glazed eyed and dry mouth they said:
"burst through this gates"
