Hear those whispers from above
our bell has begin to toll
creed has twisted in our sanity
we all shall bury ourselfs in the sand of lies

seeds of emptiness we are
so mortal souls we are
see now what we have become
hope that we won't live forever

silence is here to stay
but that's what we need in our impurity
we are welcome to end
this is the sign for humanity

The end!
The end!
