Cold hand is stretching
to the portal of destiny
dark dimension shall clarify
the conception of mortal one

line between two worlds
pain... and irrevocable...
from deep shall found oblivion
eternal.. unknown...

how short is the bridge
between two worlds
how is mind calling
for cold death

line between two worlds
pain... and irrevocable...
from deep shall found oblivion
eternal.. unknown...

sleeping in cradle of white lake
child of oblivion
northern wind is closing the bridge slowly
