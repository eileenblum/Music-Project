world of eternally blinded souls
now hear our community's words
from northern side of this earth
words about your curse

We want this to be heard
what we now have learned

We bring this to you now
when northwind blows
This message full of darkness
but you'll see it was the truth
on day of your doom

You want this to remain
world of endless pain
Ocean of fire shall blaze
from desire of evilness
in land of hope
New king shall rise from there
New king share rise from there!

You want this to remain
world of endless pain

Children in hunger
Fathers fighting in unholy war of evil
end of wordly glory
