between the fire is child, lonely soul
in the shadows of trees.
winds are in motion.
Reveals the side of darkness in her.

Sweet child has seen
too much evil because of destiny

and she became the one who feels despair.
Soul is torn. Torn by war.
winds are in motion.
Reveals the poisoned mind deep in her.

Her mind is full.
Filled with dark emotions
and the shadows of the past.
