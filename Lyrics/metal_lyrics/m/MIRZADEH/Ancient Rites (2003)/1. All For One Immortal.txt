Come gather on this field. Around our fire
Take all your needs and come to me.
I am the only one you need
Face the enemy with me.

Come to me.
We sow deceace, we are martyrs and free.

We are as one together.
We know the way for us to go.
Together as one
we'll march to the north.
Bloodbrothers to fields of white snow
or colored by blood.

Day of salvation brings the glory for us!

I am your master
and immortal.
We walk in embrace of destiny.

I am the only one you need.
Face the enemy with me.

Walk with me.
We sow deceace, we are martyrs and free.
