We have been in shadows with all who we love.
Sharing the secrets of souls.

War is to come, we shall suffer.
They will rape our daughters.
We have prayed for higher forces
and sacrified the flesh of enemy.

Now we are hiding with brothers and sisters
abandoned by our gods.
Our flesh is not enough to defend us.

Can you hear us?
The one who embraced our hearts.
Give us your fire to protect this nest.

Our god! Lift us up from sorrow.
Show us there is tomorrow. New day.
Take this priceless gift.
Turn away the southern curse.

War shall come. Give us your coldness.
Let us free from this sorrow.
