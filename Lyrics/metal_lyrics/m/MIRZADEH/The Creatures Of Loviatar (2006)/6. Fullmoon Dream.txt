Slave of the saviour
Has got the chains broken
Has found its temper
From the slit of evil sword

Lonelyone is calling me
To the company of guide
Awakening my instincts
On cold winternight

Blood runs as the young heart beats
Feeds hunger with steaming meet
Leads me into the ecstasy
Ah, in fullmoon dream

So now I praise the night
And the moon of winter
Cold pale night
Shining like silver

?Till the moon will turn to full
Again so powerfull
It leads me into the ecstasy
Ah, in fullmoon dream
