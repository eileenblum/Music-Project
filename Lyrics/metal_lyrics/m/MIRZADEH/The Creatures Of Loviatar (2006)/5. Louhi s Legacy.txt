Mother of nine reptiles
Gives birth to faith
To cover the land
Carcass reeking Louhi

Spits and curses evil
A sheppard travels towards
The hades

And Ruho swallows the light
From the earth
Drooling Rampa licks rotten flesh

Curse to the mankind

Infectious decease to the mortals
Clean in his debauchery

Undresses the earth from its brightness
Sanctifies an empire

Death with its cursings

Infectious in his debauchery
