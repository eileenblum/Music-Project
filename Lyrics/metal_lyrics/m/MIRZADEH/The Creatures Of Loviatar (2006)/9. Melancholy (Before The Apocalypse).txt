Hear those whispers from above
Our bell has begin to toll
Creed has twisted in our sanity
We all shall bury ourself in the sand of lies

Seed of emptiness we are
So mortal souls we are
See now what we have become
Hope that we won't live forever

Silence is here to stay
But that's what we need in our impurity
We are welcome to end
This is the sing for humanity
