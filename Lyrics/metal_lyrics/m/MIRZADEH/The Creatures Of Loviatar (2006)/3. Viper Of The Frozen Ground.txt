The hammer of gods strikes the northern ground
Sparks from stones above mortal lands

The anvil of forgotten roars demanding loud
The land of forgotten aside gods once again

Under devils field breeds a stiffen viper
The last rainbow falls to arms of mother earth

Swallows flesh as the creeping blood flows
To the water of swampy land

Above the frozen land crawls a growing creature
The smell of rain fills the gloomy air

Tomorrow shuts eyes ashamed what it sees
Whole ground is painted by decease
