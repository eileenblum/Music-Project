Deep in the woods
Covered with snow and ice
Standing old pine

Under it's roots
Staring pair of eyes
Hiding from shine

'Till the daylight from high above
A fading behind the seas
Creatures of forest
Are awake under these trees
Like thousands of years ago
When they were born from the womb of earth
From the night from the womb of earth

To dance for pale moon alone
'Till new dawn?

One man met his doom
Tried to see their face
Fell into deep darkness
Walked in light of moon
Wondering about their grace
Price was total blindness
