As certain as stars across systems, as winds across time
I'd burn down the world if I thought it was right

I will drag the stars to the ground
'Cause we must part and love will die

Another morning has been lost to darkness â twilight

I'm burning in a better kind of flame
I'll compose the winds of time
To swallow all that once was mine

Diamonds are not for everyone
Green eyes torture my sleep
Some dreams only turn to ash
And my heart falls to the ground
From the weight of sorrows and regrets

Into the mountains I go
To lose my mind and find my way

There is no happiness in the twilight of the soul
When I extinguish my own flame
Dead stars falls to the ground

Green eyes haunts my sleep
Green eyes haunts me
