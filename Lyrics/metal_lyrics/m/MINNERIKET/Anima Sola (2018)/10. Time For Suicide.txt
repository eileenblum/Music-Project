Oh, why cast this blackness upon me?
Oh, tempting, burning star
Why have you set my heart ablaze?

Trapped in a cell with all my demons
You assigned me to trial and announced the verdict as guilty

The cold hearted angel is looking down from above
And slowly turns her back

Headaches taunt me with flashbacks of the past
Call it fear, but I think it runs deeper
An infection that eats away at my soul
Furthering my suffering and doubling my agony

The pain dissolves when flesh does bleed
The pleasure clears it so I can see
Tonight I want to dance with the moon
Tonight it's time for suicide

Put not the blade in my hand, but slide it down yourself
Take the razor to my skin and soul
Who is there to lay with me on scattered pieces of a broken heart?

It's all just a recurring dream
The sound echoes in the barren wastes of the soul
Visions of macabre and sickness form from the shadows

Oh, tempting, burning star
Why have you set my heart ablaze?
When the demons are intent to feast
Why cast this blackness upon me?
