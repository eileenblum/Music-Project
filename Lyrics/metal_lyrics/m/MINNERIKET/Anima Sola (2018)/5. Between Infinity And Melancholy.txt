To see time in an hourglass
Sand slipping through my fingers
The sky darkens and the sea turns red
Lightning storms and tidal waves

Fires are frozen
And ice is burning

I float to another dimension
The blood of a lost child dripping on stars below
I walk a stellar path, crossing skies, heavens and stars
At last I enter the shores of triumph
Leaving behind the barren lands

Skulls and bones, the dead gather to celebrate my return
They fill my arms with gold as I feed on flesh
I built my kingdom among the stars, a sphere of light in an empty void

Time withers, and mountains rise again
A new earth emerge from the water

Radiant like the sun, mystical like the moon
I'm confined to a room with bloodstains on the floor
I blame the creeping shadows on the walls
The moon followed me home like a stray cat
Under your stars I am dressed as a newborn child
There's an honest man in here, somewhere
Behind the myth and the devils mask
Addicted to romance and horror

And I descend, like a hundred times before
Another dream of death, as I transcend this world
And ascend to the astral plane
