My sister awakened your lust
Made you feel, taste and touch

As Christ was nailed to the cross
It was my brother wielding the hammer

I submit to your beauty and wisdom
I will learn all your black arts
Mother Lilith!
See to all my needs
So that I may grow and conquer this world

I pledge allegiance to your teachings
I will tear Christ from his cross
Father Satan!
Give me my strength
So that I may rise above this world of pain

Father! Mother!
Why have you abandoned me?
I shed my blood; I slit my wrists, all for thee
Satan! Lilith!
Give me death and set me free
I do not belong in this world of misery
