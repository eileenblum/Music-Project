I am God, I am Satan, it's all the same
The abyss of sorrows screams my name
Living during winter, growing in the fall
I was born to be the antagonist of all

I was raised by demons, born from the angels
Above all the silver, above all that glimmers
Now I'm drawn to beauty like a moth to the flame
Drawn to my doom, embracing love and pain

The rain can capture every emotion
Proceeding drops from your eyes to the ocean

I see a glimpse of the old world burning in your eyes
And I wonder: could you be "the evil" such as I?

Ancient beauty queen â my pagan desire
Oh, how I want you â oh, how I need you

I never cry for love or loss
But I bleed sweet tears for the emptiness inside

I ain't looking for romance, just another soul to taint
Put innocence in my hands, I'll corrupt it with my touch
Beauty will burn for me â she will burn for me
Beauty will burn for me â I will burn for you

You're the Devil in a black dress
The one that only prays for pain
Kneel and worship the church that is me
