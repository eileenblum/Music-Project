Listen!
To the ballad of ordinary flowers
Listen!
To the story of the god of nature

There was a silence of many words spoken
By the incarnation of wisdom
In the heat of the night

I call upon old forces
I know nothing of submission
Iâm the great god of nature

This existence
At the mercy of my own humanity
I conquer the light
And expand

I breathe under water
I drown in the air
