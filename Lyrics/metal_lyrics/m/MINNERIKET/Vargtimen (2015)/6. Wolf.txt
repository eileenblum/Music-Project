From Genesis to Revelations
I walk through every gate
Searching for the path to enlightenment

Step by step
Against the odds of humans
Walk through the gate

Accept
Make a choice
Keep walking
Never give in
Embrace it
Light the fire
Never look back
Hold your head high
This is your last chance

I suffer with every page of this life
Every chapter is suffering
A maze of inhumanity lies before my doorstep

A thirst for knowledge
Embracing every aspect of creation
Born to a great existence
Without mercy or compassion
Forced to live in isolation
To nurture the power of the gods
