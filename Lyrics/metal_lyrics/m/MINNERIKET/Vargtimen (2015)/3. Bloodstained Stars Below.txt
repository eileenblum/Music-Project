When I roam the earth
I feel the forces of nature inside me
Set free from mighty shackles
Forged lifetimes ago
Waiting to be unleashed

Razors across the face of the earth
Symbols of a childhood in ruins
Unknown to those with open eyes

I see nine stars
Shining from below my feet
They are all a part of me
I owe them my life
A cosmic vision
Revealed by contemplation
