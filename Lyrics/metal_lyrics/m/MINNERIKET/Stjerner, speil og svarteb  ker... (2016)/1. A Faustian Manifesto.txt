The Pentagram
the sign of our war
a force of nature

I chose my side lifetimes ago
forged in my own blood
driven by a thirst for knowledge
guided by the pentagram

Iâve got a place in Hell
with Satan as my right hand
and I pray for war to the pentagram

Driven to the extreme
feeding of hatred from the ground
Inspecting the mirror
picking up broken shards
creating the pentagram

Thatâs the way your life will be 
with a sworn allegiance to the pentagram
I chose this way, this force of nature, the pentagram
