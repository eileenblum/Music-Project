A desolate planet cleansed of the human disease
this has become my dream
I travel to worlds unknown
only to find myself staring back into the same old reflection

I cry for the loss of humanity
the stars will witness my rebirth

I paint beautiful pictures in my mind
paintings of all the wonders of the world
where mankind is nothing but dust upon the gound
