[Bonus Track][originally by Rainbow]Danger, danger, the Queen's about to kill,
There's a stranger, stranger, and life about to spill,
Oh no, move me out of harm.

I need a spell and a charm,
Fly like the wind (fly like the rainbow),
I'm no pawn, so be gone, speed on and on.

Kill the king, tear him down,
Kill the king, yeah,
Strike him down.

Power, power, it happens every day,
Power, devour, all along the way,
Oh no, move me out of harm.

Treason, treason, the spectre looms again,
Treason, reason, the realm is safe and then,
Oh no, move away from harm.

Tear him down,
Kill the king, yeah,
Got to take his crown,
Crown,
Kill the king,
He'll rule no more,
Strike him dead, the people roar,
Kill the king, yeah,
Take his head, down, down, down, down,
Oh, kill.
