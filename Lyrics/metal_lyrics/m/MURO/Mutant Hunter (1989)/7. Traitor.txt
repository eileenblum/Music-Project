It's the voice of your laughter
that echoes in my hea
you were nothing when I found you
You were nothing you were dead
hidden behind a smile your rob
whay you want and you throw me away.
It's time for a chance in your mind
'cause nobody believes what you say.
No, nobosy believes what you say.

You were sitting just down on you throne
thinking that you were a king
you weren't carefull enough to step right
and boy you fell from your throne.

[Pre-Chorus]

Traitor
you have to know
that the tables have turned
Traitor
let me go
your power run out it's the end.
