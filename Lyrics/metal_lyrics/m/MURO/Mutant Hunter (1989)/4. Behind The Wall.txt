You never know how to reason
'cause your backs against the wall
Oh no you'll never know why
no point asking who's to go.

You never had a choice
'cause nobody heard your voice
you couldn't break the wall
it was so high, it was so thick
step with your feet on the ground
below the surface, you don't excise

you never had a choice
'cause nobody heard your voice.

You are
You're behind the wall
You are
You're behind the wall
You are
You're behind the wall
You are
You're behind the wall
