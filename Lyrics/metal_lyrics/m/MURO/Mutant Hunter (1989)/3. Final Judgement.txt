I can feel it all around me
they are pointing at me
I don't want to step the dock
I wouldn't believe.

Death in life is not my idea!
No rage, no disgrace
I can't spread my wings to fly
I can't leave this place
Hey you're dead.

You killed your first man at ease
that's what they say
now it's time for the judgement
you have to pay.
My stregth runs out
I can't face it
it's too much for me.
You are an innocent person
but they won't...

Everythin' stunning against you
it's plain to see
that you're around your...
it's your disease
maybe sometime in the future
someone can prove
that you're envolved in a nightmare
you couldn't move.
