Alone in the lonely dark
never for me again. 
No more
I made up your mind
if you don't offer me joy
I'll take it by the force.
Alone
in the lonely dark
sex
is what I need
Action, lusting for action.
Don't go making it no harder
or it'll be worse

I know, I know it's all useless
ain't no way
my system's not going to change
you'll fall in the end.

Give in
give up the strunggle
you gave the come on
give yourself up to me
go on, try to feel like I do.
So just lie back and feel it
better that way
my system's not going to change
you'll fall in the end.

Oh, alone in the night
you going to get me
you just one more.
Loners in the lonely dark
there's no way out
you'll let me come.
