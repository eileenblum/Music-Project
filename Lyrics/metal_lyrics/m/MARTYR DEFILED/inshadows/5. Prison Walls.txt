Death is my friend, I welcome him
And Death welcomes me

Life is only a phase
I've made my peace, have you made yours yet?

I can see the cracks in your prison walls
I can see every single fucking break

Fucking fear us

Fight, fight, fight for your life
You wonât get this chance twice
Fight, fight, fight for your life
Turn back the coming tide
Fight, fight, fight for you life
This is everything you've fought for
