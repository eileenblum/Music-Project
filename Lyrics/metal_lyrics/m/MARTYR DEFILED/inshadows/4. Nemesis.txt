theres a storm coming
no one is safe
can the winds of change
reverse the sands of time?

I can't see the light
Darkness is all consuming
Only the past remains
Until the sun ascends

In the storm, canât see the light
Canât see the trees for the forest

This is my world
You just live in it
Get on your knees and pray

This is a dead end path
We're going nowhere
Every chance left in the past
No hope, no happy endings
I died a thousand times
Just to watch you fall

The gates of hell canât hold me
