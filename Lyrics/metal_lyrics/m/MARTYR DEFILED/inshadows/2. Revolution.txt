I can't take another day of this
I can't take a single breath until
You're shown to be the coward you are

There is no truth to be found in your words

Let go of your worthless life
You're losing your grip
The whole world is watching
This is a call to all those watching
Stand up and be counted

This is a revolution, this is a war ground
We are the revolution, this is a battlefield
