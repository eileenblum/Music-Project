We are the broken men
The last ones standing.
We are the darkness
We are the crushed.
The world is crashing to the ground.

We are the broken man,
The last ones standing.
We are the darkness,
We are the same,
The world is crashing to the ground.
We'll tear it apart from the inside out,
Believe in yourself
Trust no one
Never back down.
Mankind is on it's knees but this is no fucking prayer
Mankind is on it's knees, we're the cross to bear.

Tear it apart,
Tear it apart from the inside.
Tear it apart,
Tear it apart from the inside out.

In this half light
The ashes of the end seem so far away
But I keep pulling, I did my time.
I did my time to the blackest skies
And I can't turn back now.

I'll find the strength to fight again, in my heart.
If we can't fight this, what hope is there left?
We have nothing left to lose.
Mankind is on it's knees, this is no prayer.
No fucking prayer
