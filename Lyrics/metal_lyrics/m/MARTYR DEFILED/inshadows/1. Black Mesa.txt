I've been awake for far too long
48 hours and still going strong
I can't find a place my limbs belong
I'm too scared to fall asleep
Too scared to rest my head

My dreams plague me
The nightmares never leave
In the night, I am the god of the world that lies before me

My own will isn't strong enough
To stop me from doing what cannot be done
I would tear the world apart
Just to watch your empire fall

You canât run and you cannot hide
Its not a matter of death of life
Weâre just fighting to stay alive
In this bitter world
