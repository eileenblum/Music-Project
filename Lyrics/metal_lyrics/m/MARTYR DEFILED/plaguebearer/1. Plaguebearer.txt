[feat. Steve Regan]Blood runs through our veins, but we are not the same. Your skin is stretched over hallowed bones you are less than a man now. Your blind conviction to your faith, to the entity that never gave you a chance can't save you now - I will show you no mercy for the trespasses you have committed. Fuck your life.

You failure, we are not the same. You fucking failure, you will take the blame. Post traumatic essences of past victims stain my walls - caught in a plain of misery their souls swarm around me. You're just another number to me and I'll wear my grin with pride when I take your life.

I am not your slave, you are not my god. Entwined in the prophecy, never surfacing. Get down on your fucking knees. You are the infected.
