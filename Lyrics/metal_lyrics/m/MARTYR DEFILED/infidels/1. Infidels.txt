We are the infidels
This is suffering
We are the lost cause living amongst them
Fighting for life yet we cannot breathe

The brightest light casts the darkest shadow
Weâve been living in yours for too long
We built the very foundations on which you enslaved us

You do not own me
I am no fucking slave
You can not tame me
You filthy fucking pigs

We can seen your agenda
We can see through the lies
This world is a graveyard
Weâre all waiting to die

Your presence has stolen all innocence
You tarred us black from birth
This black hearts still beating
War drums to the end of the earth

You do not own me
I am no fucking slave
You can not tame me
You filthy fucking pigs

We are the infidels
This is suffering
We are the lost cause living amongst them
Fighting for life yet we cannot breathe

This is the sound of you
Dying on your knees
You can beg for mercy all you want
You will find no help from me
You lost control
Youâre all the fucking same

Die on your knees
