I felt the fire in your eyes
And the pain in the back of your throat
There is no turning back from this
There is no turning back

I have hidden in plain sight
But you found me out
You have seen my darkest fears
You've seen my darkest secrets
I cannot carry on
But I can't give up now

We are nothing less than everything
With a knife in our fucking backs
You took away my reality
Now I'm here to take it back

Take a damn good look at yourself
You're living in a dream
And it's all about to come crashing down
You will not survive
You will not be saved

No friction, no love.
