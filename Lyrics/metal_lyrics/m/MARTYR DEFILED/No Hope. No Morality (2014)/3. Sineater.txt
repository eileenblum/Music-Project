Drag me down to the depths of Hades
But you can't hold me back
I will rise and become Hell itself.

Hell becomes me,
I become Hell.

When the plains of suffering,
meet the loss of hope
Unforgotten sins will be accounted for
You cannot escape the live you have lived
Watching for afar
I have logged your every move

There is no escape
From all your sins

Retribution for every life you took away
Retribution for every time I watched you rape

Taking your life away
Was an easy choice to make
Condemned to misery
By your own hate.
