My mind is full of delusion
I've got nothing to live for any more
In suffering I find sanity
In pain I find my peace
When all hope was taken from me
I found 616

Shut the fuck up
You don't know me
Shut the fuck up
You don't know what I am

616
My worship
616
My altar

I am a monster
I have no remorse for you
The beast that lives inside me
The demon I keep at bay
Released through my body
My blood and bone
Used to summon him

I am a zealot
The beast that kneels before me
I give my mortal soul
My worship,
my altar,
my prize.
