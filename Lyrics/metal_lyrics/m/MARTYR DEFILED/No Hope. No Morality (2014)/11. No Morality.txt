This is the end
You've been waiting for

Lost, alone, cold
A life without virtue
No light left in your soul
You've kept a vow of immorality
And it's taken it's toll
Eyes surrounded by crows feet
Crown of thorns kept in place
Death comes with great speed
I can see it in your face

No hope
No morality
No hope
Immorality

[2x]
This is the end
You've been waiting for

You've let me fall so far
I lost my human touch
You've let me fall so far
I lost my human touch
You've let me fall so far
I fell from the skies above
I lost my human touch
I lost my human touch

My enemy is my friend
My friend is deep below
Six feet and counting
Six and fucking counting

The hours turn to days
The days all fade away
You've let me fall so far
You've let me fall
I lost my human touch
I lost my touch
