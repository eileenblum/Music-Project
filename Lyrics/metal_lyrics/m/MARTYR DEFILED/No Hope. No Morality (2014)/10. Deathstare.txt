Live to murder and murder to live
Nothing left of the path of innocence
We are all corrupt at the core
We are all deaf to slaughter
There is no chance of brightness
There is no chance of light

Give up, you're wasting away
There is no hope left to live for
Give up, your greed has bloated
This is the end, and you know it.

Reaper, arise
Cleanse this earth of filth
Rise from the pits of Hell

Like sheep, we follow blindly
Like swine, we consume all
The fault of the human condition
The fault that taints us all
