Fuck you
Under The Influence
I wear my heart on my sleeve
Couldn't stop it being taken from me

In my own words
You left me for dead
In a world with nothing left there
Blindly I followed my own path
And here I am

Stood before me the wisdom of ancients
Vow never to bow again
I will have no master
I will have no king

Not for gold
Not for a fucking penny
You can't ever buy me

My previous submission presented me
With the clarity to see beyond
To see beyond your bullshit
See beyond your penchant for lies

Not for a fucking penny
You can't ever buy me
Burn in flames
So take your false hope
And choke on a dick
I want nothing more from you
I hope you die alone.
