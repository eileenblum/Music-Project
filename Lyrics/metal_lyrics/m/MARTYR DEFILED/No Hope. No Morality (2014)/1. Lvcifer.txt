Find me on my way to Hell
With my head ripped off
Heart caved in
I have given up trying
I have given up fighting
I see no change in the world
There is no end to it all
You have taken my soul
And made me bitter.

Lucifer is watching me
I can feel his gaze on my skin.

I have spent so long
Trying to atone
That it all meant shit
To find that I could never have won
I lived a life of regret
Got to the end; regretted it
I repented my sins
But Satan has taken me.

Lucifer is watching me
I can feel his gaze on my skin.

Oh God, why have you left me?
Dear God, I'm going to Hell.
Oh God, why have you left me?
Dear God, I'm going to Hell.
