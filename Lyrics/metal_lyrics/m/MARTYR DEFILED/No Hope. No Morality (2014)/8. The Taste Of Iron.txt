[feat. Jamie Graham of Hear Of A Coward]Striking fear in the hearts of me
I am the destroyer of live
There is no justice, there is no peace
There is no salvation
Give yourself up, there's nowhere to run
I've hunted you for so long
The taste of your blood, steel against flesh
My blade will still your heartbeat

Wonder how many lies you'll speak
When you're lying six foot deep

Stay the fuck back OH
I am the destroyer of lives

There's no honour for the betrayer
No soldiers death, just bitter pain
There is no justice, there is no peace
There is no salvation
Blood runs cold
When steel meets the iron
My blade will still your heartbeat
My blade will be your end.
