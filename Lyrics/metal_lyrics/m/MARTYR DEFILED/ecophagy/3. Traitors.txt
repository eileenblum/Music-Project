There is nothing left for you here 
The legion has taken its price 

Your stupidity has left us cold and abhorred 
The end is yours 
The mortal connection has been severed 
Our souls now being to you 

Slaves only to the blackened skies 
Ether reveals our decaying eyes 
Our god has deceived us 
Our flesh stripped from us
