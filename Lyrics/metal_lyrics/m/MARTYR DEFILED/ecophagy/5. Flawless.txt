From the plains a new contender appears 
Let them fight 
Let them duel 

The earth world realm overcomes all competition 
Raiden, lord of power 
Devourer of worlds 

This war is over, the warrior stands alone 
There is one thing left for you 

FINISH HIM 

FLAWLESS VICTORY 

They never had a chance 
Kombat is unbeatable 

This contest is my life 
My pride, my flaw, my rage 
The one thing I can't release
