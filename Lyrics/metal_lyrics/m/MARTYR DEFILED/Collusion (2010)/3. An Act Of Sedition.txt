A broken shell of what once was. Enslaved by those who hate freedom of thought. Synthetic lives lead by those made hollow by propaganda - Concious thought only made possible to retain some aspect of humanities burden. Chipped and tagged like animals to track every movement followed by the empowered to ascertain any infringements of enforced doctrine. This is the rise of the human degeneration to slaves. Desecrating the rights of the majority to uphold the wealth of the minority is the age old tactic of establishments through the bloody history of our futile attempts to break free from the endless cycle of master/slave relationships. They are livestock. Harvested for money. Seditive thoughts lead to patriotic submission to the powers that be. Take one for the fucking team. Undying loyalty to the hand that feeds is expected. Only the strong survive we will surpass this day - Hatred spawned from the greed that we're subjected to by the regime of existance by manufacture. We will rise again. Freedom is a fucking lie.
