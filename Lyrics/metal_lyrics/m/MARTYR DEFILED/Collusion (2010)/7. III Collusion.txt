[feat. Jason Evans]

I want to see the look on your face as i take your life away. My tormented soul is quiet as I feel the flow of your life spray over my hands. I see your coward face and my rage can't take the strain. Just shut the fuck up. And stand up. Stand up now! You'll see my vengeance. Red mist descends. I can't wait to kill you. You're rotting. In the eyes of god. Through your corpse on the floor I shall find my solace. My lust for vengeance precedes all. Precedes me. I'll follow you past your fucking grave. Who the fuck are you to tell me what to do - I will bring you down. The depths of my anger at my unjust captivity are only matched by the nature of your demise. I will not be compromised. The stench of your rotting corpse leaves nothing to the imagination - Every seeping wound. Every rotting organ leaves me entralled - if there was a god - I am satan. Why can we give so much to a lie that does not return? I gave up everything. And I was betrayed. Now we lie broken men. And we die alone.
