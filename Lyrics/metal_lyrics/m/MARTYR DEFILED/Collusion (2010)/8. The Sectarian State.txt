Theres blood in the water. And sharks will come. Like every powerful entity. You try to hide the sins of your past. I will expose them. I will expose you. Your lies and deceit won't fool me - You can run. But you can't hide from me - I will hunt you down. Your bullshit percieved differences between those you oppose make me sick - We are all one. Yet you persecute those for the colour of their beliefs. The secretion of your verbal feces creates insanity from the masses that follow your lead - The mass delusion of your false hysteria created to serve dystopian ends - We cannot break free. I could spend the rest of eternity savouring the last few moments - I could spend a thousand years watching your empire crumble. This is not a crusade. But I have come to take what is mine. Fuck you and your bigoted prejudice.
