As great ones said before me
I shall repeat again
The mysteries of life will never end

As great ones said before me
I shall repeat again
The mysteries of life will never end

To analyze the human mind as a child plays with fire
Hypnotized by the light no reason no desire
Entering the dark corners of what should be left alone
Behind the human flesh
Beyond the human bone

Pain so painful
Sadness so sad
Laughter till tearing eyes
Madness so mad

To die
To sleep
To never awaken
To die tonight

If not to die live to see
How black can tomorrow be
Eternity in to a rose
will bloom

If not to die live to see
How black can tomorrow be
into a grave sealed and closed
will bloom

If not to die live to see
How black can tomorrow be
In to a grave sealed and closed
Your tomb

As great ones said before me
I shall repeat again
The mysteries of life will never end

As great ones said before me
I shall repeat again
The mysteries of life will never

To die
To sleep
To never awaken
To die tonight
