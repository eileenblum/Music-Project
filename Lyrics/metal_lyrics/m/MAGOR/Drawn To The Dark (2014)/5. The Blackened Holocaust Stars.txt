Time to die
Time to die
Time to die

Marked by a star
so they'd always know what you are
a symbolic reminder of pain
a symbolic reminder of pain

Women and children enslaved
from the gas chamber on to the grave
remember the way they behaved
from the gas chamber on

Women and children enslaved
from the gas chamber on to the grave
remember the way they behaved
from the gas chamber on

Thrown to the pit
striped from your pride
crimes to commit
buried alive

Murder...

Time to die
Time to die
Time to die

Time for revenge
to bring ancestors souls back to sleep
this is the end
this is there end
