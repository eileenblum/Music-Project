Waiting, for the time to arrive
For by midnight they strive
To finally breathe the air

When, when the moon comes to life 
Evil crawls evil's eyes
Awaken everywhere

Cemeteries rising
Smelling the decay
Midnight the time of night
The time of day
Graves releasing lost souls
darkness spread their wings
midnight mistresses sing

Awaken from your slumber
And come to bring the nightâ¦

We sleep with the dead
We see through their eyes
We sleep with the dead
Sometimes the dead are still alive

By midnightâ¦
