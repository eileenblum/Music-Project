The prince of total darkness
Messenger of death
Some beg for me to come
All fear and dread the day

I'll be watching when you die
Drenched in black
The fear of man
Creator of decay

My dark hours are all mine
I embrace my misery
Not to choose red blood or wine
This is my identity

Who I amâ¦.

And they rejoice in my depression
Relived to see me devastated
Scared beyond repair
Working in the coal mines
Of the kingdom of creation
Looking down the martyrs glare

In crossed arms...

I to am an angel
I am alive
Darkened wings above you beings
From which I will never be deprived

The prince of darkness
Messenger of death
Who do I beg to come?
I do not fear the day

There is no greater fear
I am the fear of all
Doomed to dwell
To this day
