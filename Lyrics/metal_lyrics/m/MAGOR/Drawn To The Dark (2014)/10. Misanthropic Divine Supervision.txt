The sky is falling
Be brave 
The time is calling
No one survives
No one is saved

Sky is falling
Be brave
The time is calling
No one survives
No one is saved

Judgment day cease to pray
Hate imprinted deep within
Punishment from beyond
Pay the price of sin

Someone has made a decision
Slashing our throats
The end of the human division
The misanthrope

And Like the bow after the flood
New life will grow
New breed new blood
Evolving on and one day see
That there is no eternity

The sky is falling
Be brave 
The time is calling
No one survives
No one is saved

The time is calling
Be brave
When the sky will be falling
No one survives
No one is saved
