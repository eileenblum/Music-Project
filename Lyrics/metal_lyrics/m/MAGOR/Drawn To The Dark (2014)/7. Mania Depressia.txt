One day she began hearing voices
The next day they thought she was crazed
They had to get rid of the noises
The whole world was shocked and amazed

So they put her in a home for the crazy eyed
Labeled âmentally illâ
And the rage and fury 
burst from inside
making her want to kill

allâ¦

tranquilized by her own fate
blind to the sight of the world
surrounded by sickness and dark gates
planes not yet been unfurled

there were nights when the reaper was calling
drawn by the pain and disease
like eternity locked in this madness
bringing her down to her knees

whyâ¦ tryâ¦ cryâ¦ dieâ¦

And she cries...

and the galaxy waits her arrivalâ¦

is there light at the end of this tunnel
every full moon there is no one there
to think what existence is missing
and all she has left is a prayer

but the genius still lays within
all the greats have the same destiny
distorted by mania depressia
immortal for eternity
