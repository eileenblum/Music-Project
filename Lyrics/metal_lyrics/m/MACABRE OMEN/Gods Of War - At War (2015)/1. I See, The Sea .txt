âI knowâ¦â

Ohâ¦ I see, the sea! 
Winds that carry what is left of me.
And deliver but a handful of dust. 
To the Island of Helios. To the Land that once was.

The sky darkens or so it seems. 
What was reality is now but a dream. 
Times that felt aeons were moments that passed.
Who says eternity would last only Once?

I summon thee, Telchines,
Spirits of the sea. To let my spirit free.
Accept these gifts as a token of respect.
To exalt my being and let my spirit beâ¦

One with its master, in line with the Sun.
Roam through the ancient skies but also on land.
The power of the ages, a brief moment in time.
This is eternity, it is mine.

Thanatae, lead the way. May the rites of passage take my soul away.

Mortal, I do not fear death. 
It is of no concern to me.
For when I exist, death is not
and when death is present I do not exist.
If anything, death should fear me.
I know that my time has come to be free.
Now, that I see, the sea!
