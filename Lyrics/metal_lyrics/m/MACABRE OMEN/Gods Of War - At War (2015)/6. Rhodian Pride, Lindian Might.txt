In the far reaches of the sea, Â 
lies the Land of the Sun, 
Abide (by) its secrecy. Â 
Rhodian Pride, Lindian Might.
Â 
Might fromÂ hundreds of years, 
Carried through the seven seas.
Â 
Might from a hundred years,
Carried through to the Seven Seas.Â 
To the barbarian tribes,
By the Rhodians from the Hellenes. Â 
Rhodian Pride, Lindian Might.

Lindian!
Â 
All my life, I have been sailing, 
Through the seven seas, Â 
Trying to discover, 
Eager to find the Utopian Me. Â 
And when the ''ship'' completes full circle, Â 
Docking will be at the harbour of the Colossus, Â 
Where the journey begins.
Â 
Awaiting for the day, 
When everything will be the same again. Â 
Nothing has changed, 
Our Gods - Their temples. Â 

One day, that day will come. Â 

To become what Once was. Â 
I have been longing for that moment in eternity.
 Â 
One of those days, that day will come.
