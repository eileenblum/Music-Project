I extend my hand into the crowd, 
Only to hear my name out loud.

ÎÎ»Î­Î¾Î±Î½Î´ÏÎµ, your name strikes fear into hearts of men.
If that is true, where are your Cities now?
Armies used to kneel with their shields on the ground.

ÎÎ»Î­Î¾Î±Î½Î´ÏÎµ, you go through wars and your army is there.
If that is true, how do they fail you how?
Moments One`s in need are whenÂ OneÂ ends to be alone.

Follow me, and I shall pledge to thee,
To fulfil your desires.
Even if it sounds like madness, 
And my body and spirit go through the edge of darkness.
Life has noÂ relation; 
It is death that will bring us back, 
To the One that brought us into creation.

It is life that I seek. 
My kingdom I would giveÂ in return,
For a hundred years of life,
In the Land of the living.
The dead have nothing to say to us. 
It is our own Narcissism
That makes us think they even care.

I see the abyss, take me...
