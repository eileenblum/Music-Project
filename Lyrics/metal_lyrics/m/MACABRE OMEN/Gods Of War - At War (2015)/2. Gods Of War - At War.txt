With the sound of the war-horn, 
The break of dawn.
Armies of Hellenes attack unseen, 
Empowered by the Gods.
Godlike victory awaits, 
Within myriads I feel (that),
Even Gods of War are At War.

ÎÎÎÎÎ â You the voice from within my heart.
ÎÎÎ§ÎÎ â I shall share with thee my iakkhe. 

Men sacrifice your lives and souls at war.
Become one with me and the Gods of War. 

I can see the light, 
I hear the thunder in the sky.
This temple is my altar, 
And my body is a mean to ascend.
To the celestial Kingdom of the Gods, 
Where my journey will end.
Where my journey led me to believe, 
That I will become One with Them.

Gods of War â At War 

I have no fear, the end is near. 
Oh Priestess, the oracle is clear.

The Kingdom of the Gods I enter, 
With my sword in the hand on the left.
My face obscured by the blackness of the Night, 
My sight and visions are clear.
I extend my hand to the Greatness of the 
Gods and become One with Them.
Singing paeans and hymnsâ¦ 

Gods of War â At War
