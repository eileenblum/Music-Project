[Music: Tom Brugger, lyrics: Carina Brugger]

Fate has dropped me I'm weak
My skills have left me, I am sick!
Innocence is what remains!
I am dumb, I am blind, I am numb but I don't mind!
I'm overtaxed but not alive!

So kill me!
So kill me!
So kill me
Show no mercy!
So kill me!
So kill me!
So kill me
Show no mercy!

I feel I can't return!
Can't return, can't return!
I know that I was born to die!
I see that I'm insane! I'm insane. I'm insane
I hope I'll be released tonight!

Time to pray!

I can't take this no more.
Insanity knocks on my door!
I'm feeling anxious and obsessed!
Petrol runs through my veins, soaks my heart, my lungs, my brain!
Now I'm prepared for suicide!

So kill me!
So kill me!
So kill me
Show no mercy!
So kill me!
So kill me!
So kill me
Show no mercy!

I feel I can't return!
Can't return, can't return!
I know that I was born to die!
I see that I'm insane! I'm insane. I'm insane
I hope I'll be released tonight!

Time to pray!

I feel I can't return!
Can't return, can't return!
I know that I was born to die!
I see that I'm insane! I'm insane. I'm insane
I hope I'll be released tonight!
I hope I'll be released tonight!
I hope I'll be released tonight!

It's time to pray!
