Yesterday you hated one thousand guys
Today you have slept with them all

When the night had fallen you lost yourself
You plunged into total darkness
From a virgin to a whore your path goes on forever
Now that you feel sore (still on that road forever)

In the corner of the past you thought this man is your last
Like a tear from your eye you fed yourself with your lies
Like dying times, you left yourself with a cry
A cry like ones you caused for thousand guys

I am the pain inside you I am that beast
I am thorn in your flesh to say the least
I am those darkest things that graves release
I am the last rust nail to your coffin
