Hollow moment
This never ending emptiness
Is carving my soul to hollow
And as I reach the state
Of being full of it
No strength to go on
The shady old life 
Dawn is unreachable
What is there to reach for?

No sound can make me react
Like a childhood to an elder
Laughter is in the past
May there be something?
That makes me full again
Full of joy 
Full of lust
Please, enliven me!

Everything feels like nothing
Each thought just wakes up loathing
I cannot feel less
Thinking is too exhausting
To be is all I can do

Nothing has ever felt as shallow as this moment
Echoing voices fill my skull
Yet they have nothing to say to me 
Can you make this idle heart to beat?
(Make it explode!)
