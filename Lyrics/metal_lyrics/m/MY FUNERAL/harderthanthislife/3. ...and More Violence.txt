My fists have date with your teeth
My knee to your head till you bleed
My elbow through your nose
What a brutal fashion show

Things have changed
Just like I said
Now we meet again
This is my revenge

I can't control my aggression
But I don't care
Like untamed beast
I attack without mercy
Forgiveness is out of date
The fashion is new kind of hate
Violence after violence
And more violence

Storms have arrived
Cold rain from the darkest sky
Winds breath slowly death
Surface pierced by hate
