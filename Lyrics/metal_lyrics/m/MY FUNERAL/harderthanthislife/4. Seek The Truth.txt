Too many times I have been silent
Left words unsaid
Too many times I have closed my eyes
To see the truth
Too many times I haven't heard
What you tried to say
Too many times I have denied
The feeling that gets me alive

Too many years I have lost the fight 
Without the fight
Too many years I have hated
Things that I should love
Too many years I haven't spoken
With a mouth of truth 
Too many years I've been scarred
That no one's there

Can we go back and start again
And say those words that we haven't said
Can we light the fire of life again
And start to breathe
It's not too late to open our eyes
To see the things, to feel the love inside
Start to care, stop to hate, stop the war
Breathe the air so free

Always seek the truth
Always speak the truth
