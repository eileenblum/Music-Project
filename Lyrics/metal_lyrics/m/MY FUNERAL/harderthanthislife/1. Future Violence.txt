Living in the world of chaos
Aggression in the air we breathe 
Every day is war 
The revenge is sown

Future violence
Something you won't see
Future violence
On the final road
Future violence
Cold strike of the reaper's scythe 
Future violence
Just hold your breathe

Four riders from the sky
Now it's time to die
Sweet nuclear hell
Storms have arrived

World is different now
Air is too thin to breathe
Polarization done with blade
Total destruction
