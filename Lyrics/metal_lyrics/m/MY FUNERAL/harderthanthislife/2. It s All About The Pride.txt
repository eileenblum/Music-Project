My strength's built with the strongest parts 
One with my thoughts, one with my mind
Sometimes I suffer, every time I struggle
There is no loser
You can't win this war
The way was hard but I walked through
To be what I am, what I really am
Call me an asshole if you want
But do you know me
After all

It's all 'bout the pride
You can't fill these shoes
It's all 'bout the pride
I walk my own way
It's all 'bout pride
Live like a king without a crown
It's all 'bout the pride
It's all 'bout the pride

I live with passion
I live for myself
That's the way I fight
'n I fight it well
These word's from my heart
I don't hide behind the lies
Together we stand
With all respect and pride
