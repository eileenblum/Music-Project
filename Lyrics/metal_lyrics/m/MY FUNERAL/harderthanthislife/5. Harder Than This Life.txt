It was long way to go
Now I'm walking these streets back to home
And what a trip I made
To found back to my roots
I have made mistakes
Lost many years in darkness
But I've learned my lesson
And I'm proud of every scar

This is our town
These are our streets
This is where we're from
This is where we belong
This is in our hearts
This is our home
This is where we thrash
Here we thrash

Far away from home but always proud of the place where I was grown
And the road goes on, still too many stories untold 
And all those memories from childhood with lakes and stones
Brothers by my side, and all those brothers who have died!

This thrash is harder than this life
