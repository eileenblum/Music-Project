Meet you face to face
Tonight we won't just talk
It's time to face the fear
This all will end in blood

Justified act of violence
Murder in the name of law
Bloody killing show
Torment for peace

Now your execution is near
Face it without fear

Poison in your veins
Bullet through your head
Rope around your neck
Feel the speed of death

Welcome to your death
It's time to take your final breath
Meet the blade of justice
You will die by my hand
