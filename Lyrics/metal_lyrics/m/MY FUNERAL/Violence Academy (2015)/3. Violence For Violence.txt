There's a war in the streets
I see death in every corner
After every step
I'm closer to crush your head

Lust for blood
Drives me insane
I sharpen my knife
I'm ready to kill
My eyes striking fire
I'm raging inside
No more, this feeling, I cannot hide

Extreme violence controls my every thought
The ancient hatred have risen from its hide

Violence for violence
I scream for more
Violence for violence
Until I fall
Violence for violence
Reaper is here
Violence for violence
Your end is near

I take no prisoners I kill them all,
and after killing I kill some more
I'm full of hidden hatred
Bitterness and rage
I'm the perfect weapon
For this bloody war

I feel how the darkness embraces me
I hear those howling beasts
I feel how the darkness calls me
I follow the path of the beasts
I feel how the darkness embraces me
I have become one with those beasts
I feel how the darkness calls me
I am those beasts

I am the revenge against society
I am the wisdom in all of insanity
I make my own justice just for myself
Eye for an eye, done is done
