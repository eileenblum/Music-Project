Cold north wind through this graveyard
The first snow has covered all the tombstones
Reaper's scythe has struck again
Taken away one of the best

Now the misery fills this blackened heart
Empty eyes starring the hole in the ground
Tears through face whiter than pale
Like a hellish rain through this funeral day

When these wounds turn to scars
And lake of tears froze
When all sorrow is drunk away
And all memories turn to gold

I thrash on your grave

Another grey and misty morning
Seeds of sorrow have started to grow
Heavy steps along the empty road
Only the candles light this darkened road

Like thousand razors cutting inside
When I slowly arrive to place where you lie
Now I stand like a shadow on your grave
There's no words to say, only memories remain
