Nuclear clouds cover the earth
No hope for mankind
Prophecies have come true
Acid rain came out from the skies
It corrodes all the skin away
Strongest concrete starts to melt
It turns to its original shape/form
Storm of fires strikes with the power of thousand suns
Burns to ashes all shapes of life

So many years we
Prepared to bury ourselves
Now the earth is the grave
For all this human waste

Do you see the light through the cracks of these walls
Do you see the tears like waves against this dam
Do you feel how these mountains crash
It's just illusion of it then the strongest fall

Nuclear winds through the earth
The final explosion
No more stories to tell
Mother earth, now on her knees
Slowly she breathes
Her last breath
From darkness all begins
Into the darkness all ends
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Those famous words
Hid the truth
