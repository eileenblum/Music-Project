Open the gates
Into your mind
Welcome to a ride
Darker than the darkest sky
Find piece of a violence
From corner of your thoughts
Submit to its will
Let it control you

Step into old the old circle
Release brutality
Now learn to use your skill
To war, torture and kill

Crawl deeper inside your mind
To find the truth
It's all beneath your eyes
The unwritten rules

Violence academy
Obsession to kill
Violence academy
Lethal ability
Violence academy
Extreme cruelty
Violence academy
Total fatality

Brutality of all this violence
Just illusions of your twisted mind
Now you found your own way in violence
You graduate with the highest marks
