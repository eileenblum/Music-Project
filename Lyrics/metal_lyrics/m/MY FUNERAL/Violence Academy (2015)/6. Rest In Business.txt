I'm dancing on the razor edge
I live without fear
They all say my end is near
They might be right
But hell ain't care

Fuck off their system
Fuck off their rules
I am a free man
I'm not their tool

There's no point to attack
But there's always a reason to kill
No reason to fight
The battle is over before it begins

Living for danger
Danger is all I see
I might be insane
But that's all I really want to be

There's no point to attack
But there's always a reason to kill
No reason to fight
The battle is over before it begins
Your hammer is useless without the nails
Without powder your bullet just an empty shell
