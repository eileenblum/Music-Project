I've heard that wine is fine, but whiskey is quicker
Everything goes for me, just pull the trigger
I won't ever spit into the glass
And in the parties I don't fit in to the mass
COME ON!!!! TO PARTY
NYT RYYPÃTÃÃN!!!

I cannot remember the lyrics, I am too drunk to thrash
I dropped my drumsticks, I am too drunk to thrash
Someone stole my guitar, I am too drunk to thrash
I fell off the stage, I am too drunk to thrash

Straight in the morning a vodka with ice
Again Iâm ready to roll the dice
Drink this bottle or two with me, donât be shy
I still drink the old ways until I die

I cannot remember the lyrics, I am too drunk to thrash
I dropped my drumsticks, I am too drunk to thrash
Someone stole my guitar, I am too drunk to thrash
We all are too drunk to thrash

Fuck off and once more
Hell I care if you don't dare
I drink for joy I drink for sore
Never too drunk to drink some more
