Holy smoke fills my lungs
I escape from reality
Thick smoke
The source of all my wisdom
Behind my deep red eyes
The world isn't enough for me
Before I close my eyes
I take another hit

Now I fly

Into the place where mind of giant grows
I follow the fly of the white crows
I don't feel any mental slowdown
On my way to the unknown abyss

Once more I start to mine
Deeper and deeper than ever before
I have found my new level
Now I walk among my own gods
Or are there any gods
I try speak with the universum
But it doesn't answer

Inhale my brother inhale
Steps into labyrinth of your mind
All is now so crystal clear
Escape from prison of your thoughts
Now you're a free man
Open the gate one more time
For your final funeral pyre
