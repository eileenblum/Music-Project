In the heat of the fires of hell
Where the embers are dancing
We have forged the perfect weapon
Strongest metal that you've ever met
Faster than a bullet, heavier than a lead
Carried by four raging beasts

Now we bury you down
To the thrash underground

Let the blood paint the streets
Your head meets the anvil
True metal through your skull
That's all you need
The strike of thrash hammer

Attack of unforeseen violence
Screaming vengeance straight out from hell
Breath of black smoke and fire
Bringers of infernal destruction
Greatest weapon that's ever seen
Crush your face another thousand times
