Bled by chaos
Ripped apart
Suffering whispers of my unborn son
Pain of agony flows through me
Can't stand this Hell I feel

I waited so long
To fullfill my dream
Fight to reach it
Never believed to lose
Rise from ashes
From dust to top
Your destiny where I come

Dance beside me this dance of autumn's grief
Shall we fly so high to touch the crimson sky
Deeper than darkest sea
To believe this dream can be real

Torn from inside
Shattered my heart
I long my departed sun
One of my blood
One of a kind
Taken before his life

I waited so long
To fullfill my dream
Fight to reach it
Never believed to lose
Rise from ashes
From dust to top
Your destiny where I come

Dance beside me this dance of autumn's grief
Shall we fly so high to touch the crimson sky
Deeper than darkest sea
To believe this dream can be real
