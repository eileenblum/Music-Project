Here Iam
I don't know who Iam
And what am I to you?
I just live, live and breath
I just live, for your love
Just like your eyes
I feel like I've died
You look down on me
But what is that you see?

Tell me what you want me to be
Is it the shell or that what's within
Tell me before those leaves fall
I close my eyes, will this be all

I'm nothing for you
I'm not even the air that you breathe
I'm nothing for you
Still I come every night to your dreams

(I recall, I recall it all
Too beautiful sight as we sat in the sunrise
Secretly you leaned to me
Much was done as we were in the starlight

Time went by and there we lied
Soon came in sight the beautiful moonrise
I awoke and you were gone
I long for you as I wake in the sunrise)

Here I am
Im Waiting for the autumn's call
Waiting for the day when all leaves fall
I just stand, stand all alone
Coldness arounds my hollow thoughts
Your words of deceit howling inside me
Days are getting short, time draws near
...and I bleed,bleed for this love

You were the only light
in my darkest night
The only star in my blackened sky
I open my eyes and what I see
you're not here for me
