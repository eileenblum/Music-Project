Are you bored with your life?
Does anything feel right?
Still thinking: "what is wrong?"
Let me tell you about speedball.

Speed and fame is all you seek.
Gliding around is what you need.
And when you finally stop to think.
Life wasted and that is it.

Do you know what you want?
Do you know what is right?
Cant't you see what you're doing for those?
That is just beneath your nose.

In the end you'll see what was important for you.
But then you'll also know that it's too late for that.
There's nothing to do but to accept it and.
Realize
That you're not the only person around!
