An opening for sadness
The cemetary shined
Shiny stones on those who died

Among them a man lies
Thorns grow on his mound
Somehow his death was bound
To come by me

The crowd had departed
Flowers were there
Despite the custom
I had brought none

All the things you had done
All that was wrong
Not a word was carved
Upon your stone

Embers are dying,fire is running out
I waste my time on this heartless stone
The epitaph is blank as are my thoughts of you
Enjoy the death I brought

Deciding to stay a while
Memorizing you
The lowest form
Of life you were

The faith you brought along
The faith that was wrong
You tried to make us all
Blind

But you made the mistake
Of going to war (with me)
As it appears I won it all

Not an act of violence
Was needed to see
That you will remain buried
