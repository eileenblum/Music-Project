Here is the girl without a smile on her face.
She's sick an tired to walk this way.
Every night she cries herself to sleep.
These nights. are endless like the pain. (inside her).

She was an angel with snow white gown.
So pure and innocent was she...Before the end
wings torn off,and gown covered in blood.
"Someone's" eyes shining in the night

Cold wind blows through the empty room.
Light fades away, darkness has taken its form.
Like a shadow, evil creeps in her heart.
Darkness landing over the little one.

Everytime she's thinking suicide.
She sees the end and takes a razorblade
cutting her wrists, the last thing is
a message on the wall:"thank you F"

What have you done?
Killed the little one
What have you done?
You raped your own little one.
