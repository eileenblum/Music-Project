A mortal day
To remember
An immortal memory
Incarnated
With pain

My spirit
That you never
Forgive you'll adore
'till death
And beyond death

Now your pride
Is laughing of you
The hate for yourself
Slowly destroys you

Your days will be days
Of sorrow
Happiness
Has ended

All has an end
But also it has a beginning
Your misfortune
Begins here
The anguish makes
Sad your dreams
Loneliness clouds your life
And you sink
In the limbo
Of despair

Pain will never stop
It will never stop the suffering
This was the path elected
Crawl yourself through it

With the cross of misery
And spill all your purulent blood
'till reaching the dome
Of your forgotten
Ruins...
