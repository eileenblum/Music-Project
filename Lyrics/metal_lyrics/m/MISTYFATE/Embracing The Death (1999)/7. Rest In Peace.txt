Rest in peace?
The book of life
Has opened
Grotesque scenes
Pass before my eyes

"My judgement has no mercy
My punishment will be imminent
No return
No victory
Only rules of death"

The anguish has defeated me
Now I have died...
Dead for the world
And for the hope
Dead for all
Who marched
Leaving a flower
On my grave

The silence fills my great emptiness
And it only in the darkness
I'll fly upon the graves
And I'll see
The sad struggle

Of their shrouded bodies
In their suffocating
Funeral
Vestments
You'll see the great kingdom
Of the victor worm
Pass on the face

Of all those who conform
The greatest sight of pain
In this sepulchral hell
