In my dream
I hear your lament
And cry with you
Your sorrow of death

You took a part
Of my soul away

But I don't
Blame you
It's all remember
Of infinite pain

That pain
That never dies

All my pain
Is a dirge
Your absence
My desolation
Your cry
Festers in my heart
Will it heal the open wounds?
I curse the betrayer
Who delivered you to death
A death that you didn't ask
All for all!

I curse his ancient name
It's time to raise the flame of hate
For spitting it all on him
All the hate!
And all the disgrace
That now dwells in my heart
Before every un
It will come an infinite darkness

Before every flash of light
It will come a great storm
With every dream
An abyss of tears

You know my tragedy
Hear me from nothingness
Walk with me
Cry with me
My pain whispers
Your name in silence
