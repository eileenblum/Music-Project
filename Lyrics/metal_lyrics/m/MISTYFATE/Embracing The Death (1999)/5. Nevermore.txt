You have marched away
For never come back
The funeral vestments
Now cover your body
The glorious death
Has called you...
Cross the great gates!

The crying
The funeral chant
Of the hope
Now has adopted
This melancholic words
Never, never more!

Enter the tunnel
Not looking back
Forget all pain
All anguish
Behind only remain
The forgotten spirits
Beneath the ruins of chaos

Memories of a
Tortuous life
The misery
Increases
Multiform
At the horizon

But it's greater
The misery that lives
In our souls
Now come back for me
Take my spirit and take me
Where the night has no end

Release me
From this great agony
Return for me
Stop the pain
Stop the crying
The glorious death
The profound dream
This is my prayer
Take me now for
Never come again
