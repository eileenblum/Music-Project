Like our dreams die
The day
And the list in the thorns
Of memory

Our love dies
Now wherefore
The eternal life?

No more lies
No more hope dreams
Death is real
Is absolute
It comes to execute it's rules
And it moves away
Leaving in our hearts

The crying
And a pain
That oppresses
Our spirit

The world
Of our
Sad humanity
Doesn't look beyond
Reality

The time
Will pass
And day by day
Our misery will be bigger

The chaos
Will be imminent
And our sole hope
Will be to roam on a road
Full of thorns

'till reaching the decrepit age
And fall slowly waiting
The arrival of the absolute
Silence...
