Suffering...
I see in my life
I see into my soul so dark
As the progundity of the universe

Perhaps is this my destiny
An endless sorrow of tragedy
Rising from the ruins

The crown of thorns
Rest in me!

Now victim of my demons
They rip up my soul
The oppress my spirit
They are all memories
Sad memories

The crown of thorns
Rest in me
The blood covers my face
And mixes up with my tears
They fall forming the great echo
That tortures me from inside
And vanished through

I see my life
I see my soul
Lost among my remains

This time I was defeated too
And there's only a prize
For the winner, who is always the same
Which will never be me
