Only
An eternal sorrow
Walks with me
And a dark memory
Is still a storm
In what I believed
Has fallen
From the highest

Now I know
All my glory
Was in vain
The slow agony
Defeats me
Fall on my knees
I want me to not
Stand up any more

There is no faith
No tomorrow
Only the beginning
Of a new pain

And my soul
Gives up to all
Charm of illusions
To all dream of hope

Thy cold heart
Of sombre spectre
Stained with gray
All my dreams
And all thy
Claws nailed
In my heart forever
Formed open wounds

You know my tragedy
So that
I curse you!
I curse thy name!
Curse the moment
Of your coming
A curse of love
For sorrow
Legacy of infinite grief
For an everlasting hate
A hate big enough
That I die here

Cuse!
I curse you!
I curse the name!
I curse you!
