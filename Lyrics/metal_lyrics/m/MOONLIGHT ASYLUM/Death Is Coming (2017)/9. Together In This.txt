When everything seems to fall down,
When every person seems to fade,
When every swallow taste to black
And even daylight fades to dark.

When hopeless is your only task,
An endless quest of your own self.
And no one's near to hear you cry,
And no one's near to help you.

Fight!
To remove the tightened veil from my eyes.

Love!
To regain my confidence and will to fight...
To regain my life.

[Chorus:]
Just take my hand and come with me.
I see no place where I can be.
I'll show the way to escape from this realm.
There is no place to hide this pain.
I'll give you my soul, I'll give you my all.
And there is where I'm expecting to go.
There's nothing we can't do together in this world.
Together now we are.

When daylight's gone and doubts grow strong,
And mayhem surrounds all your love.
When time for you last breath approaches,
Destructing all around its road.

When hopeless is your only task,
An endless quest of your own self.
And no one's near to hear you cry,
And no one's near to help you.

When the world comes down to crush you,
I... Will be there to hold you.
When your nightmares overwhelm you,
I'll be there to wake you up.
