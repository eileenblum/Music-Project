n the night of darkest pleasures,
In which all my fantasies fall down.
In the night of desperations,
In which pain and sorrow are allies.

I can feel this calmness
And it comes from deep within.
Then this scary voice appears
And it's blackening my dreams.

[Chorus:]
And this voice is controlling all my life
And this voice is pushing me.
Going deep into melancholy,
Blurring what I have to be.

Self destruction is the only path I see,
My emotions are perishing,
Caressing me with a voided ecstasy,
Filling me with a twisted serenity.

I'm hearing a voice that calls from deep within,
It tells me how I have to be.
Cut your arms and sit to see you bleed.
Feel the pleasure running toward your veins.

Put away all this pity life you live,
Set yourself free, leave this dream.
Hear the voice, it tells you how to be.
Now is time you decide in which way you'll die.
