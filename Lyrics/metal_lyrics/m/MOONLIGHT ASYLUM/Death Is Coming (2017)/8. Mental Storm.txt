An urge to let this life behind
To a state of mind I never had.
Watching over me,
And getting over self protected.

Was it everything I always wanted
Or was a fiction on my mind?
Settled by years of pain,
Settled by my deepest fears.

And even if I run,
And even if I cry...
Would you take my hand
And ease this pain.

[Chorus:]
And I feel the end is closer,
I feel there's nothing more to fear.
Run away, run away, run away you scream,
I'm not the one you need.

As far as no pain can be felt,
As far as you don't hold me.
Run away, run away, run away you scream,
There's nothing more in here.

Crossing seas of raging tides,
I do not fear to face the end.
Surrounded by the doubts of past,
I weave, I lose control again.

And once again I find myself
In the eye of my despair.
Running toward my sins,
Riding through my destiny.
