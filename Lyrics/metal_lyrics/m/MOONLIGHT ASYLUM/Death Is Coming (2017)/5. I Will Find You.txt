And yet again the story runs
In a way I cannot stand.
I cannot walk this path again.
I cannot face this raging sea.

And yet again the story tells,
A lie disguised in smiley face.
Innocence corroded,
Beauty torn apart with cruelty.

Confusion leads to insanity,
The truth is what I've never seen.
A trail of light struggles hard,
Nothing seems to be no more.

And yet it seems there is something
To fight, something to believe.
And yet it seems myself would be,
A stronger reason to break free.

[Chorus:]
In a breeze I burn my past,
I rise among a pile of lies.
I see the hatred, envy...
I dive through lakes of misery.

In a second I will uncap,
The truth that hides behind those eyes.
And no place will be safe no more,
No place will be without a war.

No matter how much you can run...
I will find you, I will find you.
