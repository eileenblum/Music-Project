I'd love to contemplate
How many times you'll see me fall,
Before you run scared trying to hide
What's inside your fragile mind.

I'd love to see you standing
Next to me when my wrist bleeds,
To know exactly that you are
The one I'm expecting you to be.

The sea is running out
Leaving no life, leaving no hope.
I will choose to face this devil,
I will choose to take you back.

Over devastated fields of guilt
Your body is dying... Without life.
Before my eyes I see the death
Is trying to take you out.

[Chorus:]
Death... Death... Death is coming!

Why do you hear all that madness?
Why do you stand all this madness.
Why do you try to be lifeless?
Why do you care I'm so lifeless.
Why do you want to be in darkness?
Why do you sailed all this darkness.
I am here to be your saviour.
I'm afraid I need a saviour.

I will drag you out from darkness
Which is holding back your life,
Take my hand fight all that sadness,
Take my hand let's face that lie.
