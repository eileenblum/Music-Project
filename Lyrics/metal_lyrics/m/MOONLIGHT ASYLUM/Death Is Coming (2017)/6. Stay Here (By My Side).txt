Were the raindrops on my skin,
The warm call of the unknown.
And your eyes, piercing my sight,
Over and over...

An endless pain
Bloomed into hope,
A whole new life to explore,
So I reborn in a new world.

Stand still...
Can you feel the light?
Can You... Recognize a new,
A new chance in your life...

[Chorus:]
So you changed my life,
I'm afraid to lose you, afraid to hurt you.
So you woke me up,
From this endless everlasting coma.

So you showed me love,
In my lowest and my dreadful moments.
And I'm so afraid
Of not seeing your face again.
