Lies!
Are the words they use
To control your behaviour,
To control your soul.

Fear!
Is the instrument
To corrupt your essence,
To corrupt your life.

Lies they use against your will,
Deceive is the key to access to you,
Hatred is what they install inside your life.

Lies they use to hide their nature,
A nature full of nothingness.
A blackened life of impure emotions,
A blackened life of fantasies.

[Chorus:]
Hatred!
Is what they spread,
A manifestation
Of a lower creation.

Envy!
On your achieves,
Is a justification
For their less dedication.

They suffocate your being
To a state of a mental annihilation.
They try to tear your inside,
They try to make you feel you are numb.

Hatred!
Is what they spread,
A manifestation
Of a lower creation.

Lies!
They predicate
To protect a world
Of impure transformation.

They search inside your fears,
They search inside your deepest frights,
To make you feel the way they are,
To make you feel so empty inside.
