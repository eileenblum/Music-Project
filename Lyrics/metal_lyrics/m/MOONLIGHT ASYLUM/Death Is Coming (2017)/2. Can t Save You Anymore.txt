Watch my shadow staying away from you.
I've made my mind can't save you anymore.
This heavy burden I carry long ago...
Destroys me like it never did before.

And now is time to untangle all the strings that wither me,
Is time to get away from here.
And now is time to accept that I can barely breathe
In this place, that I'm sinking by your side.

[Chorus:]
Can't you see there's no light at the end of path?
Can't save you anymore... 'Cos I'm drowning with you.
Can't you see you are now swimming on your rests?
A shadow of yourself, I can't follow you.

Can't save you anymore,
I have to push you away,
I'm drowning as you fall apart.

And I sink into your madness...

And I sink into your madness,
As you lose your self control.
Your demons are arising.
Can't save you anymore from you!
