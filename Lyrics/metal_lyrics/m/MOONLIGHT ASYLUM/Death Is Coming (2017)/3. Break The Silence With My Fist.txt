I fall into darkness,
Going deeper than before,
Feel my desperation,
Blending... Merging as one with my soul.

Rising from the ashes,
Consciousness starts to grow,
Running over what I was,
Starting to overcome what I feel wrong.

Torn... Apart this legacy.
Break... The silence with my fist.
Searching truth behind those fiery eyes.
Rise... The voice that never screamed.
Kill... That false image of me.
Suffocate and die to rise again,
This is what I call begin.

[Chorus:]
I kill the weight that pull me down (I'm diving to the surface).
Behold the stronger I can be (Your lies burn into ashes).
Turn them into a newer being (Unstoppable... fearless).
And be the one you'll never reach.

I fall into darkness,
Going deeper than before,
Feel my desperation,
Blending... Merging as one with my soul.

Setting points to reset,
All the suffering and fall.
Setting all the basis,
To restore what I have lost.

Break the silence with my fist.

And rise the voice that never screamed.
