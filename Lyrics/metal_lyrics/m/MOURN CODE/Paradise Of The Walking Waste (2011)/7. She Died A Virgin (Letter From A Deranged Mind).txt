[Adaptation: Zid]

Grace sat in my lap and kissed me
I made up my mind to eat her
On the pretense of taking her to a party
You said "yes she could go"
I took her to an empty house in Westchester
I had already picked out

When we got there, I told her to remain outside
She picked wildflowers
I went upstairs and stripped all my clothes off

I knew if I did not I would get her blood on them
When all was ready, I went to the window and called her

Then I hid in a closet until she was in the room
When she saw me all naked she began to cry,
And tried to run down the stairs
I grabbed her and she said she would tell her mama
First I stripped her naked how she did scratch and bite
How she did scratch and bite, how she did ?

I choked her to death
Then cut her in small pieces so I could take
My meat into my rooms
Cook and eat it

How sweet and tender her little ass was roasted in the oven
It took me nine days to eat her entire body
I did not fuck her though I could or wished
I did not fuck her, she died a virgin

When we got there, I told her to remain outside
She picked wildflowers
I went upstairs and stripped all my clothes off
She died a virgin
