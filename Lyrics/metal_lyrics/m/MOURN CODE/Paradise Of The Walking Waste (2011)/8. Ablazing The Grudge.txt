[Lyrics: Demon, Rage]

A sleeping shinning beauty
Your hair rounding the sores I left
And the innocence you ruined by my hands

See through the horizon
And you'll be lying beneath the sun
Ablazing the grudge you laid on me

Don't forget that feelings are the codes
That will take you sleep under my blood

Mourns have no space here
Tears are turning into blood
Sculpting passion codes that wrap us in true "love"
Not in this world's mirror

While you're searching for a breath of no-guilt air
Out of your unauthenticity funny game
In my game of being God
Looking over the jail you call a world

I'm now rejoicing, destroying and crushing you...
