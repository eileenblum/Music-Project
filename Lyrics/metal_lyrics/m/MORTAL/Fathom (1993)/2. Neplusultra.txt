Above The Falling Sky
Beyond The Mystic Haze
Across The World So Wild
In Bluish Fever

I Wait For The Sky To Fall
I Wait For The Haze To

I Wait For The Wild To Call
My Wait Is Here

Fear - The Killer
Hate - The Enemy
Love - The Power
The Limit

Outside The Edge Of Sight
Beneath The Shifting

Behind A Trick Of Light
I Glimpse Forever

I Pray For The Sight To See
I Pray For The Earth To

I Pray For The Light To Be
I Pray My Saviour

Under The Aegis Of The

Living God
(We) I Trust And Love With

Under The Aegis Of A Lov-
Ing God
(We) I Live And Breathe

Love The Killer
Love The Enemy
God The Power
The Limit
