My faith my grief my fear my blood
My trust my flesh my hate my love

These bones my skill this skin my pity
My time - it shells the fate upon me

Your turn your twist foresight and acumen
Your will your wish your primacy

My valor my virtue my perils my regrets
Remain inviolate - perforce
Through Your power

I fathom grace at fathom speed

My prayer my plea request repleat
Receive reply reveal ! Reveal !

Godspeed in motion and force
Godspeed the power and source
Godspeed God's grace God's love

No more no less no fear no need
No height  no depth too great
Godspeed
