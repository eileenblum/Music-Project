Blood red tape disaster
Slow swimming black Disease
Seasons strangled stifled strained
Belief sold for diplomacy

Who will Heal the
Wounded skies
Politics terrify
Tear down the
Compromise and live For love
Who will hear the silent Cry
Our passions Crucify
There has to come a
Time when life will prove Enough

Painted warning signs of Life
Media Sinister selling Spite
Deep runs the lies
Breaking Us down
Belief Sells security

Noble ends dubious Means
Elude the Sleeper
Swift the gap closing Between
The fool and the Believer!
