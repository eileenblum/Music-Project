How fierce the fear
How thick the blood
How dim the glass
I look into and through

How sweet the fall
How swift the blow
How slow the rush
I catch perpetual limbo

How deep the cut
How dark the rift
How wide the wake
I weave I sink I drown in

How black the day
How red the moon
How pale the stars
That burn in pallid splendor

Vision so strange
A welcome change

How true the Word
How tried the soul
How tired the wait
Poised to kill the will the sacrifice

How dim the sky
How thick the blood
How fierce the love
That embraced the Death
To free the life

Those Words tore at my soul
I feigned surrender now I've lost Control
Moved by the Spirit of the mighty God
He spoke - I'm shaken

My Pride, fallen away
Steep was the Cross and the Price to pay
Struck down in the presence of
The living God
Made Alive from nothing

Blessed, I'm Blessed
Possessed by the One the Spirit
That moved me
Healed without Scars
Made alive from nothing

Saved, I'm saved
By grace I'm Shaped
Formed into being from the Earth Of my life
By the Hand of God
I'm made alive
