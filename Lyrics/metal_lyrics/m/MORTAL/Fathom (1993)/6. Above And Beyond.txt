I Searched for wisdom in the stars
To Kill decisions from afar
I looked for truth in desperate Skies
A twilight screaming empty lies

I asked for Life from mother earth
But she refused to give me birth
I Breathed the powers of the air
And dared to taste my own despair

My hope is above and beyond the Temporal
My hope is above and beyond the trees
I Believe in this reality
But it doesn't answer what it Means to Me
My Hope is Above and beyond

We revel and bath in eerie light

To Face the chill of darkest night
Traversing life should make one wise
When staring Death in the eyes (I despise!)

Our hope is above and beyond the Ephemeral
Our hope is above and beyond the Trees
True Meaning lies in ultimacy
"..Our souls are Restless 'till we're Found in Thee"
Our hope is
Our faith is
Our Love is...
Above and Beyond
