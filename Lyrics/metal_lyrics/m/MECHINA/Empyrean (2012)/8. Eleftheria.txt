My heart is whole again
Bathed in the light of this blue gem

Waiting for the moment
To breathe the air of this free world

My mind is free from god
Seeing a world untouched and unflawed

Waiting for the moment
To breathe the air of this free world

My eyes have opened
Building this world we will redefine heaven

Waiting for the moment
To breathe the air of this free world

Breathe the air of this free world
