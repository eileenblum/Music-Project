The optical feed manipulated
The resolution only simulated
A binary masterpiece between two realms

A quantum dance - mentally entranced
You pray to yourself bearing the sign of a god
Now you know who humans have prayed to all along
Bound by your faith
Instilled by your hate
You deserve nothing more than this moment to pray

Matter becomes transparent
Accepting the farce of human sentience
Remain in a state of cognitive discord

Modulation through systematic control
Grasping for air - increasing this data flow

Pineal glands stabilized
Adrenal glands amplified
I feel everything

A quantum dance - mentally entranced
You pray to yourself bearing the sign of a god
Now you know who humans have prayed to all along
Bound by your faith
Instilled by your hate
You deserve nothing more than this moment to pray

Clawing at the ground
Feel the texture of a nation
Turned to ashes

Breathe the air of this fallen world once again
Now your body will rejoin to repay the earth

Nervous system collapsing
Optical implants refracting

This fleeting moment is nothing more than...

A quantum dance - mentally entranced
You pray to yourself bearing the sign of a god
Now you know who humans have prayed to all along
Bound by your faith
Instilled by your hate
You deserve nothing more than this moment to pray
