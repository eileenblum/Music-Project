We are the dust of a new generation
Here and now, taking heart in this salvation
Fearless and free from subjugation

We are all bound to the sky
For our birthright, stars had to die
We will remain for eons
Bound to the sky

Abolish a world bound by deception
To affirm the future of Empyrean for
Eons
Eons
The right to remain godless and free for eons

Fusing this flesh
With the machines
To spread the seed of humanity
My eyes will retain these burning stars
To seal and repair these ancient scars

We are all bound to the sky
For our birthright, stars had to die
We will remain for eons
Bound to the sky

Fearless and free
Fearless and free

I have the right to remain
The strength to sustain
A life to regain
We are fearless and free

We are all bound to the sky
For our birthright, stars had to die
We will remain for eons
Bound to the sky

This final Empire
This last Horizon
