Entranced by the contrast of the sun
Against the world that I once loved
I shall praise the stars above
For these empires
Turned to dust

Absence of control is all I see
The end of an age of tyranny
Chaos is sown in the soil
Believe in me and you will see

All of my life
I've watched from the outside

We were never free
We refuse to see
The future form that we could be
A specter of earth
Now and forever

Absence of control is all I see
The end of an age of tyranny
Chaos is sown in the soil
Believe in me and you will see

All of my life
I've watched from the outside
All of my life
I've watched from the outside
Believe in me and you will see

Absence of control is all I see
The end of an age of tyranny
Chaos is sown in the soil
Believe in me and you will see
