A right to remain
Bearing the scars of
This world - never deserved
The strength to sustain

Systematically scorching
This world - never deserved
A chance to leave
An imprint upon the stars

A life to regain
Is a life worth disdain
When the only world left
Has been consumed in flames

Send your cries to a vacant sky
Shrouded in darkness, I stand
Pleading for the light to shine again

I speak with my eyes
To denounce the origin
Of centuries draped in black

Tears are lost into the rain
Which washes away
The hope to remain

Send your cries to a vacant sky
Shrouded in darkness, I stand
Pleading for the light to shine again

Send your cries to a vacant sky
Shrouded in darkness, I stand
Pleading for the light to shine again
