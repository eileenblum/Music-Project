A simple glance upward
Is all I need
To shatter the silence
Of an apathetic breed

Exceed the standards of our past
The illusion of god has been exiled at last

Fables once used to control
Have faded away
No need to kneel
No need to fear
A simple glance upward is all we need

The past was bound by individual pride
Only to be crushed by the weight of the sky

Embrace the breed
Of those who have been freed
From the chains of this godlike disease

Fables once used to control
Have faded away
No need to kneel
No need to fear
A simple glance upward is all we need

We fear death for we are flawed
Although we die we will rejoin
We are forever

No need to kneel
No need to fear
A simple glance upward is all we need
