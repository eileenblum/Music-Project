A past once forgotten
Reappears and reinstates
The nature of man
This orbital firestorm
Foreshadows my return
I shall regain power over the remnants of earth
I have returned
All shall obey and kneel before your new god
Salvation becoming a specter
Blurring the line between
Freedom and indoctrination
