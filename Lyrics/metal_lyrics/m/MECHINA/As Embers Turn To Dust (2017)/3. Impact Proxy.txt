Vanguards, we conquer the sky and land - 
In search of the tomb made of glass and sand 

Once found, we shall carve a path 
Retracing the steps of decades past 

Daybreak, only moments away 
The Centauri stars arise into grey 

These towering clouds flicker and wane 
Rays of light connect with the rain 

As we fight the new found gravity 
The storm is building 
Gaining intensity 

Stars erased from the shattered sky 
Shrouding the new world we glorify 

A journey inward may end in defeat 
For life as we know it was made by machines 

As time moves forward into morning light 
Take heart as we advance with broken sight 

To break the chains of orbit 
We will sacrifice our blood and forfeit 

Countless days and endless toil 
For rain, air and fertile soil 

As we fight the new found gravity 
The storm is building 
Gaining intensity 

Stars erased from the shattered sky 
Shrouding the new world we glorify 

A journey inward may end in defeat 
For life as we know it was made by machines 

As time moves forward into morning light 
Take heart as we advance with broken sight
