Shadows of giants 
Bring shade to the sea 
Mechanical life 
For all eyes to see 

When you look to the heavens 
Remember our plea 
For lasting peace 
Submit and believe 

Fear us 
We are the hunter of kings 
Born with the blood of this titan machine 
Hear us 
Demons who hide and the gods that survived 

As the distance continues to grow 
The thunder of ancient war echoes 
We come face to face with the frozen divide 
In time 
You will abide 

The fear of control 
Dividing our breed 
A whirlwind of lies and ghostly deciet 
As we search through the heavens 
Remember our plea 
For lasting peace 
Submit and believe 

Fear us 
We are the hunter of kings 
Born with the blood of this titan machine 
Hear us 
Demons who hide and the gods that survived 

As the distance continues to grow 
The thunder of ancient war echoes 
We come face to face with the frozen divide 
In time 
You will abide 

As the distance continues to grow 
The thunder of ancient war echoes 
We come face to face with the frozen divide 
In time 
You will abide
