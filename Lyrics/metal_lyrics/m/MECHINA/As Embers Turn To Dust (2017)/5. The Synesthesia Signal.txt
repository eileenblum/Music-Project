Hear the leaves with the breeze 
Clouds form from a distant sea 
With rain comes light 
Upon incandescent Flora 

Captivating our eyes 
This Horizon only breeds humility 
Oh, how fragile is the signal 

I never could believe 
The era of machines 
Would deliver us from afar 
We have been reborn 
I never could believe 
The era of machines 
Would deliver us from afar 
Reborn to conquer the stars 

Fragments of old earth 
Air, rain and soil 
Feel the storm evolving 
Guiding us into the shadows 

Captivating our eyes 
This Horizon only breeds humility 
Oh, how fragile is the signal 

I never could believe 
The era of machines 
Would deliver us from afar 
We have been reborn 
I never could believe 
The era of machines 
Would deliver us from afar 
Reborn to conquer the stars 

Captivating our eyes 
This Horizon only breeds humility 
Oh, how fragile is the signal 

I never could believe 
The era of machines 
Would deliver us from afar 
We have been reborn 
I never could believe 
The era of machines 
Would deliver us from afar 
Reborn to conquer the stars 

Fragments of old earth 
Air, rain and soil 
Feel the storm evolving 
Guiding us into the shadows
