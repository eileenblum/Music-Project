The burning empires our past 
Pray to the winds 
Memories made of cindered ash 
Never forgetting the reason 
Never forgiving the past 
Never believing in freedom 
This great storm will build a throne 
These first Vanguards will lead us home 
Vanguards lead us home 
Vanguards lead us home 

In earth's final breath 
We sailed the blackened sea 
Upon the wings of our god machine 
This great storm will build a throne 
These first Vanguards will lead us home 
Born to flee 
Never forgetting the reason 
Never forgiving the past 
Never believing in freedom 
Vanguards lead us home 
Vanguards lead us home 

Tear the horizon 
We bring the gift of life 
At any moment 
We will breathe the air of our new world 
Those born above the clouds 
Prepare yourself for solid ground 
The air of our new world 
Here we stand in the space between 
A dream and reality 

This great storm will build a throne 
These first Vanguards will lead us home 
Born to flee 
Never forgetting the reason 
Never forgiving the past 
Never believing in freedom 

Godspeed
