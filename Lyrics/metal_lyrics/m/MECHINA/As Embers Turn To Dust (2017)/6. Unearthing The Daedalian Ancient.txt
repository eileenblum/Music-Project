The cold storm fades 
Lost to the crystal horizon 
Clouds shattered and torn asunder 
The distant call from our God machine 
Mistaken for wails of waning thunder 

Echoes batter the canyon walls 
A faint Titan Roar 
Felling stones from on high 
The soil fractured and dry 

Carve us a way 
Honored Pathfinder 
Claim this land in vain 

Cursed are those bound by time 
The remnants of rain form illusions of ice 

The fog turning to ash 
A life source born 
From synthetic force 
Bring life to this world 
Rebuilding memories of earth 
Through organic war 

As ripples travel through standing water 
Tremors below 
Repeating in order 
Sowing the seeds upon conquered lands 
Safeguarding the survival of man 

Echoes batter the canyon walls 
A faint Titan Roar 
Felling stones from on high 
The soil fractured and dry 

Carve us a way 
Honored Pathfinder 
Claim this land in vain 

Cursed are those bound by time 
The remnants of rain form illusions of ice 

Echoes batter the canyon walls 
A faint Titan Roar 
Felling stones from on high 
The soil fractured and dry 

Carve us a way 
Honored Pathfinder 
Claim this land in vain 

Cursed are those bound by time 
The remnants of rain form illusions of ice 

The fog turning to ash 
A life source born 
From synthetic force 
Bring life to this world 
Rebuilding memories of earth 
Through organic war
