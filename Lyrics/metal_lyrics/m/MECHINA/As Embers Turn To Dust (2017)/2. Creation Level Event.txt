To vanquish fear and the loss of life 
Reject the thought of needless sacrifice 
A shapeless enemy, bound by a linear form 
As time drains away, our purpose is born 

With faces of stone 
We prepare for the cold 
With layers of steel 
We stand stronger than most 
Flesh joined by rivets 
Without, we would fold 
The weight of the sky 
Would cripple our bones 

Now, repel into darkness 
Venture forth and abandon all fear 
Succumb to the mist of this ghostly frontier 

The gateway to amend our past 
Gather yourself and decompress 
Prepare for countless days without rest 
Vanguards, time draws near 
Use steel as your shield 
Use hope as your spear 

With faces of stone 
We prepare for the cold 
With layers of steel 
We stand stronger than most 
Flesh joined by rivets 
Without, we would fold 
The weight of the sky 
Would cripple our bones 

Now, repel into darkness 
Venture forth and abandon all fear 
Succumb to the mist of this ghostly frontier
