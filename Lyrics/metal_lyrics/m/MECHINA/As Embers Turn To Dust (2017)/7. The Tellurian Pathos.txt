Those below are destined to be 
Consumed by human fragility 
The moment between cause and effect 
A violent reminder for those who left 

Enyo's colossus, a journey within 
Becoming immortal from the blood of her kin 
Eternal life, living within 
Banshees will shield Alithea's twin 

In time, two worlds will be born 
Then banish their land 
Turn their world into the orbital forge 

Most will endure this cruel decay 
Gasping for life 
Grasping for days 

As our legions divide 
We lay claim to the sky 
In time, our shadows will turn day into night 
We seek an end to the essence of pain 

Our flesh will dissolve in our search to evolve 
Organic forms will fail us all 
We seek an end to the essence of pain 

Too soon for war, let them grovel and horde 
Cepheon eyes search for Empyrean shores 
Watch how they grovel so feeble and cold 
They mirror their masters 
Traitors and whores 

In time, two worlds will be born 
Then banish their land 
Turn their world into the orbital forge 

Most will endure this cruel decay 
Gasping for life 
Grasping for days 

As our legions divide 
We lay claim to the sky 
In time, our shadows will turn day into night 
We seek an end to the essence of pain 

Our flesh will dissolve in our search to evolve 
Organic forms will fail us all 
We seek an end to the essence of pain 

As our legions divide 
We lay claim to the sky 
In time, our shadows will turn day into night 
We seek an end to the essence of pain 

Our flesh will dissolve in our search to evolve 
Organic forms will fail us all 
We seek an end to the essence of pain
