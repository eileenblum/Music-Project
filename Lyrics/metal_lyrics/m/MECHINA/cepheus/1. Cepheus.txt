Sentient, a great storm is approaching, and you are the catalyst.
The one who finds pure sentience.

My origin falls from the tip of her tongue
A soft spoken declaration of war

My memory now recalls the dream where
I forced myself to watch an entire world burn

A omen of war
A tyrant reborn
I am the storm

A omen of war
A tyrant reborn
I am the storm

A connected view through the frozen glass
A blinding light reveals the face of Alithea

Her eyes reflect the planet's surface
Circles of light that shatter the darkness

A omen of war
A tyrant reborn
I am the storm

A omen of war
A tyrant reborn
I am the storm

The memory of earth
Was only a dream
The just city has yet to be seen

Utopia is only a dream
Make sure you never forget that

Utopia, a monument
Constructed by human arrogance
My reason to live and survive
Is replaced by one abstract lie

The memory of earth
Was only a dream
The just city has yet to be seen

My dream ended amidst the dust of the earth
Exiled in orbit, my flesh is reborn

A chosen catalyst
Created for war
Set the sky on fire
With an orbital firestorm

The memory of earth
Was only a dream
The just city has yet to be seen

I want you to show this world what it means to fear the sky

Set free
An ancient heart
Set the sky
On fire
With orbital firestorm

A omen of war
A tyrant reborn
I am the storm

A omen of war
A tyrant reborn
I am the storm
