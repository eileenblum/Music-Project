I see a world destined to fall beneath me
The world, the sky, designed to leave it behind

I shall not kneel
I declare non serviam

Forever enslaved by one law
Forever cast down all dissension

Raise the flag on shattered lands
Conceal the truth with bloodstained hands

I shall not kneel
I declare non serviam
