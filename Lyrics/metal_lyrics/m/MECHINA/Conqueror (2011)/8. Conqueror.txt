I shall set my eyes on the burning skyline
Fearing the day I lust to replicate this design

Generations of conflict conditioned to conquer the stars
A revolution of freedom, born to conquer the gods

Take to the sky
Abandon the earth once and for all
Bury my heart in the dust of a billion dead suns

Generations of conflict conditioned to conquer the stars
A revolution of freedom, born to conquer the gods
