Breathe the air of a fallen world
And tear the sky with a golden storm
Destabilize this world of slaves
And debase their fallen gods

Let the crescent flag
Be stained in human blood
Kneel before the myth of mankind
Embrace the Esoterical Eon

Unleash the rats
To plague the streets
Of a free nation

Make the earth witness
Let the world pray to the winds
Absolute and infinite
Is nature's endlessness

Unleash the rats
To plague the streets
Of a free nation

Breathe the air of a fallen world
And tear the sky with a golden storm
Destabilize this world of slaves
And debase their fallen gods

Make the earth witness
Let the world pray to the winds
Absolute and infinite
Is nature's endlessness

Breathe the air of a modern world
And advance this flesh to a golden form
Stain red the holy lands
With those who kneel to the sky above

Let the burning cross
Be stained in human blood
Kneel before the myth of mankind
Embrace the Esoterical Eon

Make the earth witness
Let the world pray to the winds
Absolute and definite
Is human obsolescence
My one life
This last breath bares only timelessness
