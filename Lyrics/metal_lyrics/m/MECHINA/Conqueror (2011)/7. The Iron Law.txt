Future empires will only find
The steel spines that hold up the sky
Empty streets echo
The time when authority guided the blind

Future corruption will hide behind
The shadows of men with god given rights
Hope and fear an infectious flaw
Designing us all to bow before the iron law

Total system failure
Devour the skyline with hellfire
Total system failure
The laws of man abandon the throne

Future empires will never find
The books designed to enslave the mind
Those who live in the shadows of gods
Have failed to silence those who appose

Total system failure
Devour the skyline with hellfire
Total system failure
The laws of man abandon the throne
