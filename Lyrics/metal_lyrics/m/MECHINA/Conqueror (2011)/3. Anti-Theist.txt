Crucified horizon
Human lives wasted away
One by One

Scatter the mortal seeds
And sow a failed generation

Conquer all
Corrupt all
Cant you see its bloodstained meaning?

Once and for all
One by one, humans shall fall
No longer chained
No longer restrained

Conquer all
Corrupt all
Cant you see it's bloodstained meaning?

Conquer all
Corrupt all
Enslave and contaminate
