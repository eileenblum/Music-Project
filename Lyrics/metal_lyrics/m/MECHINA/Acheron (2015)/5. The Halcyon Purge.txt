[feat. Mel Rose]Below millions left behind
As the fallout begins to take the sky
Left bleeding destined to die
As their eyes witness their final sunrise
Blinded by the light
That draws a line
Between a conquered world
And those who survived

[Alithea:]
The rains will come as worlds fall dark
Bound in silence
This great storm will end the throne
And awaken the Tyrants

[Amyntas/Listener:]
Oh mighty Titans from whom began
The afflicted miserable race of man
Shake the foundations of the universe
And the blessed ones within it

Bound by Invictus
To conquer both land and sky
We flee the bloodied teeth
Of Cepheon genocide
Hate so pure it breaks apart a world
And hurls it upward
Deracinate the Tellurian race
History forgets the death of cowards

The rains will come as worlds fall dark
Bound in silence
This great storm will end the throne
And awaken the Tyrants

Oh mighty Titans from whom began
The afflicted miserable race of man
Shake the foundations of the universe
And the blessed ones within it

The rains will come as worlds fall dark
Bound in silence
This great storm will end the throne
Awaken the Titans
Bound in silence
This great storm will end the throne
