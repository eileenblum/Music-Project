With every step
The synthetic divisions within her skin begin to glow
She venerates the Titan of the sky with her arms open wide
It bears its wings as it sleeps among the stars

Now I know for centuries we Titan Born
Forging worlds
With the hands of these machines
The war that brought my home to its knees
Forces them to sleep
They shall live again
Invictus Daedalus

Oh Daedalus
The Guardian of Thales
Who sleeps in the light of Phedra

This bridge comes to life
As our footsteps light the path that we have walked
Its thundering heartbeat roars and shakes the foundation of the sky
As she says, I command thee Daedalus awaken

Now I know for centuries we Titan Born
The architects of worlds
The host of these machines
The war that brought my home to its knees
Forces them to sleep
They shall live again
Invictus Daedalus

Engulfed in the blinding light that rushes from its eyes
Alithea turns back and says unto me, we are the bringer of storms
Prepare to feast upon the sound of Empyrean cries
You shall awaken those who sleep in the den of tyrants
And let them sing the leviathan war cry

Amyntas, emperor of titans
Defender of the Earthborn
Acheron awaits your return
