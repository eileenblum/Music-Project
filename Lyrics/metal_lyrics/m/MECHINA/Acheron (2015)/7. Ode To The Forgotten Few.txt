[feat. Mel Rose]Surrounded by an endless sky
Listen to its heartbeat echo
Like distant thunder
Bound to sleep for countless years
Never troubled by our human tears
Have we forgotten what it means to be human?

Awaiting the day
This dream will be
Lost in the endless waves
Our past consumed by the tide

As worlds come to pass
Like embers turn to dust
A life to regain is a life worth disdain
When a world that I love only offers me pain

Awaiting the day
This dream will be
Lost in the endless waves
Our past consumed by the tide

Oh how I feel
Like I have lived and breathed
This scene before
Only glass between two worlds
The price that we pay
For the lives we betrayed
Only wash away
When we turn to star dust

Awaiting the day
This dream will be
Lost in the endless waves
Our past consumed by the tide

Titans can you hear me
We join you in a cold sleep
Awaiting our fate
Like stars frozen in time
