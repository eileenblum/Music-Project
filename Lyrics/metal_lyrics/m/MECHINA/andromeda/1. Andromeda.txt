Exiled in orbit
Forced to reflect
On what should have been
Freedom or bloodshed

Assembled in dead stars
While my heart remains on earth
Lighted by the waning sun
Behind this blue earth
We are finally free from gods
Or men who claim to be

I shall cradle
This vast darkness
Slowly scaring
In search of solice

Cast down by those who live
To lie to themselves
Thrown aside to watch all sides
Devour themselves from the inside out
Countless years, countless lives
All wasted on this vicious lie
Falsify and amplify this human design
To enslave mankind

The time has come
To advance this flesh
Once and for all
The time has come
To remove god
From our lexicon
This veil of tears
Shall not exist
While I am alive
I am human
Stronger than any god

I shall cradle
This vast darkness
Slowly scaring
In search of solice

Cast down by those who live
To lie to themselves
Thrown aside to watch all sides
Devour themselves from the inside out
Countless years, countless lives
All wasted on this vicious lie
Falsify and amplify this human design
To enslave mankind

The time has come
To advance this flesh
Once and for all
The time has come
To remove god
From our lexicon
This veil of tears
Shall not exist
While I am alive
I am human
Stronger than any god
