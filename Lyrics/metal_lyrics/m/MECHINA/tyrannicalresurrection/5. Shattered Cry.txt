Divide the world
Embrace all chaos
Erase all peace and beauty
This is the anthem of mankind's
Eternal morality

The flames engulf the horizon
The Earth begins to decay
Human rights are relinquished
In return a life of pain

This is so real
Contamination of my mind
Let in poison
Leak and control

Nothing is real
The future is pale
This constant vision
Is blinding and real

We are not pure as men
This hell will kill us all
Reach back and face your God
Return to battle and fall

Contradict survival
And keep weak alive
Contradict compassion
And keep the sin inside

Extinction
The aesthetic principle
Of our existence
Universal evolution

We are not pure as men
This hell will kill us all
Reach back and face your God
Return to battle and fall
