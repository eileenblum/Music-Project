Come forth now young one
And bare witness
To the fields of slaughter
Where you fathers take blame
Your nation lays waste
From words of the elders
The words of tyrants
Show no remorse

Retell the fable
And breed a new nemesis
Ego and ignorance
Divide through intolerence
Bring forth the swarm
To heed the call
Our children will witness
Our nations falll

Now the young
Will stand tall

The words of the elders speak
As histories tyrants have been reborn
Their ressurected words now echo
As they have once before

Reinforce the bonds
Between freedom and cruelty
Reinforce the bonds
Between myth and reality
Our children will see
Our children will bleed
For a world
Of infinite brutality

Now the young
Will stand tall

The words of the elders speak
As histories tyrants have been reborn
Their resurrected words now echo
As they have once before

Now the young
Will stand tall

The words of the elders speak
As histories tyrants have been reborn
Their resurrected words now echo
As they have once before

The earth shall quake
Concrete will fall
The words of tyrants
Echo once more
Recovery of our nation shall begin
Until the next elder speaks again
