As specters fall from on high 
Trails of fire, dividing the sky 
Baptized within this moment 
We have waited a lifetime 

We stand upon the soil 
In search of our glory 
Sing to the titanborn 
Sleeping within orbit 

Consumed by the breeze 
I fall to my knees 
Never again will our home be condemned 
The right to amend 
This world we must defend 

The soil beneath my feet 
Breaking away from me 
Tremors of the machine 
The air of this world 
Is now safe to breath 

We stand upon the soil 
In search of our glory 
Sing to the titanborn 
Sleeping within orbit 

Consumed by the breeze 
I fall to my knees 
Never again will our home be condemned 
The right to amend 

Consumed by the breeze 
I fall to my knees 
Never again will our home be condemned 
The right to amend 
This world we must defend
