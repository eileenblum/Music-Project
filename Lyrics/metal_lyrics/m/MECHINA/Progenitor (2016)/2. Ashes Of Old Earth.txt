Arise, feeble relics of old earth 
Those reborn upon the shoulders of gods 
We are the children of Hyperion 
Ashes of old earth 

A century draped in black 
A bloodline stained by tyrants and man 
oh, how feeble and cruel 
are hopes and dreams to begin again 

We are the children of Hyperion 
Fragments scattered beyond the sun 

See this world 
Free of man 
How does it feel to abandon the dead? 
A world left to rot 
The world that we lost 
Earth, betrayed by us all 

We sailed upon endless waves and set our eyes upon distant horizons 
The ashes of old earth 
Someday, will be forgotten 

Dissent, within every breath 
Fear guiding every step 
Her eyes behold a world never seen before 
A gem found in a sea of coal 

Her body, reflecting the light 
Cast by the distant horizon 
Remember child 
As our generation dies 
The essence of life 
Came from the Sky 

We are the children of Hyperion 
Fragments scattered beyond the sun 

See this world 
Free of man 
How does it feel to abandon the dead 
A world left to rot 
The world that we lost 
Earth, betrayed by us all 

We sailed upon endless waves and set our eyes upon distant horizons 
The ashes of old earth 
Someday, will be forgotten 

See this world 
Free of man 
How does it feel to abandon the dead 
A world left to rot 
The world that we lost 
Earth, betrayed by us all 

We sailed upon endless waves and set our eyes upon distant horizons 
The ashes of old earth 
Someday, will be forgotten X2
