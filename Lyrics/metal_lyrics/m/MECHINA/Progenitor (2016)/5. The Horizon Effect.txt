Into a cosmic sea
Fragments of our essence
Scattered beyond the sun
Into a cosmic sea
A frozen symphony

At any moment this all will end
I shed my skin of human life
To touch the land
In the absence of the sky
The air collapsing my chest
Into a cosmic sea
Fragments of my essence
Slowly becoming one

I stand in the shadows of monuments
At any moment this will end
My final breath
Like embers turning to dust
My body will dissolve
Into the cosmic sea
Fragments of our essence
Scattered beyond the sun
Into a cosmic sea
A frozen symphony

How I lust to breathe again

This machine
Listen to her heartbeat
Sheâll sing eternally

This machine
Oh, titan can you hear me
Grant me eternal sleep

I stand in the shadows of monuments
At any moment this will end
My final breath
Like embers turning to dust
My body will dissolve
Into the cosmic sea
Fragments of our essence
Scattered beyond the sun
Into a cosmic sea
A frozen symphony
How I lust to breathe again

In total harmony
Witness this machine
Shift her wings upward

Can you hear her sing
Can you feel her breath
Defending what we call life

For the first time
Iâve opened up my eyes

I stand in the shadows of monuments
At any moment this will end
My final breath
Like embers turning to dust
My body will dissolve
Into the cosmic sea
Fragments of our essence
Scattered beyond the sun
Into a cosmic sea
A frozen symphony

How I lust to breathe again
