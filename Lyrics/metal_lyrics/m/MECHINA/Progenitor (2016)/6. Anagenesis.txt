Exiled just above the highest clouds 
Endlessly searching for any sound 
As decades pass, we devour the outer rings 
Our lifeline dependent on in-situ utility 

Orphans bound by the frozen sea 
We sail upon the shadows of this cruel dream 
The world below, awaiting the human seed 
In silence we sleep, oh titan hear our plea 

We only dream within the absence of sleep 
Regaling tales of human cruelty 

The day we relink with our god machine 

We shall become planet bound 

In the end, I must amend 
I beg of you, bury my flesh 
Beneath the soil of the world below 
This is not my home 

We shall become planet bound 

The elusive search for life 
Hidden in the blackness of night 

Enduring the cruelty of time 

Every moment consumed by loss 
This human slate grasping for faith 
Hope itself destined to be lost 
We kneel before those bound by frost` 

We only dream within the absence of sleep 
Regaling tales of human cruelty 

The day we relink with our god machine 

We shall become planet bound 

In the end, I must amend 
I beg of you, bury my flesh 
Beneath the soil of the world below 
This is not my home 

We shall become planet bound 

We only dream within the absence of sleep 
Regaling tales of human cruelty 

The day we relink with our god machine 

We shall become planet bound 

In the end, I must amend 
I beg of you, bury my flesh 
Beneath the soil of the world below 
This is not my home 

We shall become planet bound
