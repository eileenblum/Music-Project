Oh, the price that we pay
For the lives we betrayed
Only washes away
When we turn to star dust

This moment in time
My life will collide
Born from the sky
This world demands life

The life that we seek [4x]

Floating in silence
The price we pay
Begins with boundless pain
Awaken, only to die
For a new life
I can hear them scream
I can see them bleed [2x]

The blood in my eyes
Distorting the light
Collapsing my mind
My skin, crystallized
My senses alive
The pain gets me high
Only to be wasted away
Destined to be
A lost memory

The life that we seek [4x]

Dancing in silence
The price we pay
Begins with boundless pain
Awaken, only to die
For a new life

I can hear them scream
I can see them bleed [2x]

We came from the stars
With hope in our eyes
Fate is a lie
My skin, crystallized
My senses alive
The pain gets me high
Only to be wasted away
Destined to be
A lost memory [2x]

I only hope to dream
Where ill never know pain

Oh, the price that we pay
For the lives we betrayed
Only washes away
When we turn to star dust

The worlds which we seek
A lost memory
My cells on retreat
They tear from each other

My bones
Paralyzed
The pain
Amplified
I didnât come to die
For a new life
Shattered memory
Of faces and names
The essence of fate
Begins to wash away

I can hear them scream
I can see them bleed [2x]
