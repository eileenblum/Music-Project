Her frozen breath 
Ignited by the distant sun 
Omnipotent frozen embers 
Suspended like the stars above 
The cold steel beneath her feet 
It triggers a haunting memory 
The look in her childâs eyes 
When she said her final goodbye 

When given the chance 
To evolve or advance 
We retreat to the past 
Praying for ghosts to guide our hand 
Our lives far too short 
Our minds far too cold 
Our past buried in stone 
Our world absent of hope 

Outlast the danger 
To be rewarded b y wonder 
Collide and assemble 
Bound by beauty and cruelty 
Destined to lose 
So much we wont see 

Until the day we are planet bound 
In search of solid ground 
We cope with shattered memories 
Enduring simulated gravity 

When given the chance 
To evolve or advance 
We retreat to the past 
Praying for ghosts to guide our hand 
Our lives far too short 
Our minds far too cold 
Our past buried in stone 
Our world absent of hope 

Outlast the danger 
To be rewarded b y wonder 
Collide and assemble 
Bound by beauty and cruelty 
Destined to lose 
So much we wont see x3
