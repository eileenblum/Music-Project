This mortal shell 
Absorbed by the endless night 
Augmented life 
My senses come alive 
No memory 
The future unforeseen 
Forever linked 
To the protean machine 

Unleashing a storm 
Preparing the swarm 
We humans set forth 
Blinded by only one desire 
We shall leave trails of fire 

We ascend upon steel giants 
In our wake 
Clouds of fire 

Unwilling to forfeit 
The only chance 
To escape the chains of orbit 
They shield their eyes 
Unable to recognize 
Their human god 
Standing upright 
I hear it breath 
I feel itâs heartbeat 
Forever linked 
In sync with the machine 

Unwilling to forfeit 
The only chance 
To escape the chains of orbit
