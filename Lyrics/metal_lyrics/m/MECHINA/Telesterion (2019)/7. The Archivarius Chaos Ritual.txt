I feel I may have fallen far from any semblance
Of my fellow human
Empty veins replaced by wires
Flesh forged in fire
Andara
Our ancient mother
Hear me
Shield your loving eyes
As I civilize
I will forge a throne made of blood and bone
Honor the horns of war
They call, hear them soar
The broken hearts of our home world
Shall be restored
Honor the horns of war
They call, hear them soar
I fear the storm
May dissolve our world forevermore
These wounds, these scars forgotten
Only the strong will hear my sword song
Frozen hearts will be set ablaze
Low passions be praised
Andara
Our ancient mother
Hear me
Shield your loving eyes
As I civilize
I will forge a throne made of blood and bone
Honor the horns of war
They call, hear them soar
The broken hearts of our home world
Shall be restored
Honor the horns of war
They call, hear them soar
I fear the storm
May dissolve our world forevermore
They have always lied
The beauty of this world is still alive
Pleading to survive
The breeze and I collide
The sky abound in endless starlight
Pleading to be alive
My mind and heart align
Embrace the scars of our ancient bloodline
The specter of paradise
Carry on my child
This endless war shall never subside
Leave them behind
They have always lied
The beauty of this world is still alive
Pleading to survive
The breeze and I collide
The sky abound in endless starlight
Pleading to be alive
Honor the horns of war
They call, hear them soar
The broken hearts of our home world
Shall be restored
Honor the horns of war
They call, hear them soar
I fear the storm
May dissolve our world forevermore
