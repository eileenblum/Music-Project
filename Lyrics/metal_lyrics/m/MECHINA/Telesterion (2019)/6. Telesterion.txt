All beauty and grace will be erased
The power to silence
Beneath this horizon will give rise to wasteful life
The old world
Burned and defaced
Their gods and their fables
Their demons, their angels
Shall be laid to rest
Reborn from dreams of peace
A tranquil world of lush green
Where love and honor reside
The terrors of night are confined
Bring their thawing flesh and force them to stand
Upon the holy machine
They will soon command
These dreams rewired her mind
They taught her to hate her own kind
A human shell, redesigned
A god queen, redefined
Still bound by machines
She lashes and screams
"By the sword or by will. Bring the Titans to me."
So hopeful and soft
Watch how they fall
The power of silence will spread like a virus
They must all obey
Forever remember these words
In peace, you'll be misled
Then driven to bloodshed
Embrace the endless cycle
Reborn from dreams of war
A nightmare colored by cascading gore
Through apathy
We tolerate a dying society
Decimation
No, just kneel
You belong to the home world
The holy land I command
With each step down
Her eyes scan the ground
Those that still live
They shall submit
A human shell, redesigned
A god queen, redefined
Still bound by machines
She lashes and screams
"By the sword or by will. Bring the Titans to me."
So hopeful and soft
Watch how they fall
The power of silence will spread like a virus
They must all obey
Forever remember these words
In peace, you'll be misled
Then driven to bloodshed
Embrace the endless cycle
