No words spoken
Careless and cold
Like cryoshock scars that glimmer and glow
As servos inspect and prepare to dissect
A new form of human
A new architect
We shall journey onward
Through endless pain and torture
As they say
"Darkness and seamless hate shall guide our pathway."
The silence is broken
As the last of the blood
Surges and spits
From Enyo's lungs
It drips and streams
From the slave driver's tongue
Then marked on their faces
"Obey and begone."
Face to face with Alithea
Her sister star
Awake and alive
The purpose to bring her back to life
Forgotten by lifeless eyes
We shall journey onward
Through endless pain and torture
As they say
"Darkness and seamless hate shall guide our pathway."
The silence is broken
As the last of the blood
Surges and spits
From Enyo's lungs
It drips and streams
From the slave driver's tongue
Then marked on their faces
"Obey and begone."
Only moments from now
We will witness planet fall
Titans crashing through the highest clouds
They leave trails of fire
This new world will bring us life
I can hear them sing
I can feel them breathing
Defending what we call life
This final empire will spread like liquid fire
Only moments from now
We lay claim to sacred ground
Action coming face to face with fate
With trails of fire
Defending what we call life
This final empire
This new world must bring us life
