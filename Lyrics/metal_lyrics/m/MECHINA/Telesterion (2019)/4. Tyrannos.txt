Fortified in this shape shifting cauldron
Sterilized by the Draconic Vulcan
From ashes to life
The infernal birth right
Through savage pain
She will evolve her mind
Monsters are being bred
From famine stricken flocks
Unconsciously evolving for combat
The children of Hyperion
All vassals under Cepheon
Behold the mother of all machine gods
Her hands bound by wire
Synthetic strands lash at her back
As the blood rushes her mask
It spills, soaking her neck and chest
Still awake, he legs buckle and sway
As servos of steel hold her in place
This spasm dance
A godly display
Screams turn to laughs
As air leaks away
Dictatress, bellow your war song
A soaring howl that would horrify the old gods
Children on Empyrean
Descendants of Acheron
Behold the mother of all machine gods
Her hands bound by wire
Synthetic strands lash at her back
Her eyes roll upwards
As blood turns them black
There is a word from the old world
Unknown in this golden age
Peace
Everything they have ever known is peace
The ever present heresy of unrelenting apathy
Low passions be praised
Andara, forgive me
