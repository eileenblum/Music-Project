In this dying night
My eyes curse the starlight
Embers divine
As time culls all life
Stars painted gold and blue
Her skin mirrors the same hue
Demons from the old world
Your essence will devour
Violent means bring violent ends
When your eyes open
You will stand upon the blessed dead
When your eyes open
You shall become the realm breaker
As light runs from night
Fearful angels take flight
Behold the sight
As time culls all life
Stars painted gold and blue
Her skin mirrors the same hue
Father from the old world
Your bloodline traveled so far
To be free
If only you could see
When your eyes open
You will stand upon the blessed dead
When your eyes open
You shall become the realm breaker
Oh, sister star
Ice bound forever
Entombed with no recourse
Mother from the old world
Your bloodline traveled so far
To be free
If only you could see the endless path towards hell
As souls search for faith
Mere minds suffocate
Oh, father from the old world
Your legacy dies with us
What is a name
When every face is the enemy
Like fire, the fear of life will burn
Until life itself burns away
We have become lovers of ourselves
Boastful and proud
Ungrateful
Lest we forget to plant the trees
For the shade we may never enjoy
When your eyes open
You will stand upon the blessed dead
When your eyes open
You shall become the realm breaker
