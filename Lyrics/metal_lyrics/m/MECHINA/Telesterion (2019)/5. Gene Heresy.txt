From the ways we heal the sick
We will break within
Oh, misery
The relentless unforeseen
The fabled will to breath without drowning beneath
The modern world's feeble and broken wings
I hear the rising storm's battle rhythm
The fear of endless rainfall
To see the flash of life
Denounce this horrid time line
Longing for peaceful means
With war in our genes
Live through violence or violently die
Prolonged slaughter
Shall not falter
From the ways we heal the sick
We will break within
Oh, misery
The relentless unforeseen
Like the winter sky
Only moments away from sunlight
Bitter cold envelopes
As my final path unfolds
Please give me endless life
Like the winter sky
Only moments away from sunlight
Bitter cold envelopes
As my final path unfolds
Please give me endless life
From the ways we heal the sick
We will break within
Oh, misery
The relentless unforeseen
A journey high above the ever darkening skies
As warlords, the angel makers for every mother's son
As you pass through hell
You best not stop
Only traitors will be left behind
In times, such as these
Words will lose all sense of meaning
Rulers bask in endless favor
Live through violence or violently die
Prolonged slaughter
Shall not falter
From the ways we heal the sick
We will break within
Oh, misery
The relentless unforeseen
In this coming war
Across all home worlds
It will spread and cleanse
I beg you alithea
Please give me endless life
In this coming war
Across all home worlds
It will spread and cleanse
I beg you alithea
Please give me endless life
