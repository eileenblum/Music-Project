Seek retribution with the machine
Imbued by the first living titan
Draped in fire
Stay calm, these flames soar higher
Either dead or entombed
Her bloodline fractured by a barren womb
The bloodletting shall resume
Stay calm and watch her consume
The banner lords of the Hyperion world
Kneel before her graceful passing
Guarded by and banshee's sword
Iron scented offerings
Drip from the hands
Endlessly raised
To build a new world
Without war
We must relinquish our fate to be shielded by the machine
Chimera
Embrace the aura
Lest we forget where we came from
Both priests and traitors
Of the old world
Look on in despair as Elephtherian pedals
Tumble down through the air
In silence, these holy hypocrites
Scowl and detest
In time, their fables and flesh
Will be laid to rest
The banner lords of the Hyperion world
Kneel before her graceful passing
Guarded by and banshee's sword
Moments before ascending above
She turns to face her endless horde
To build a new world
Without war
We must relinquish our fate to be shielded by the machine
Chimera
Embrace the aura
Lest we forget where we came from
To heed the call
With a battered heart
Honor the faceless conqueror
To heed the call
With a battered heart
Honor the faceless conqueror
To build a new world
Without war
We must relinquish our fate to be shielded by the machine
Chimera
Embrace the aura
Lest we forget where we came from
Lest we forget where we came from
