A subconscious request
Upon the shoulders of Cepheus
I hope to amend what's left to defend
We are both absent of trust
Yet we mutually
Lust to regain a sense of home

Arise to immortality
As a titan hunting both gods and kings
Let this world drown in tyrant blood
Now let them sleep for eternity

A cold and quiet corridor
No life to be found
Deceit in the air
I can tell by the sound
Startled at first
My tension is absolved
As I hear her words

Come close and let your memory be restored

Becoming one with the machine
To cease the spread of this human disease

I disdain mechanical restrain
But the gaps in my memory
Are well worth the pain

Arise to immortality
As a titan hunting both gods and kings
Let this world drown in tyrant blood
Now let them sleep for eternity

Once again
I find myself slipping
Into a quantum dance
Senses begin to fade
All for a chance
To be free when I awake

Synchronize
Stabilize
Initialize
Let the pieces fall back into place
