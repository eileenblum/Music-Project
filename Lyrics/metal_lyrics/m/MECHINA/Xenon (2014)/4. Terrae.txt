In a fearful attempt to touch the warmth of the sun
A simple glance upward, vertigo at ground level
Symmetrical muscle memory
An active human redundancy

A world's fate relies
On machines to survive
Only titans remain
Embrace the machine
To bring gods to their knees
Only titans remain

From the moment
Gravity pulled my body to the ground
My eyes were denied from the sky
As if gods masked as men had something to hide

A world's fate relies
On machines to survive
Only titans remain
Embrace the machine
To bring gods to their knees
Only titans remain

Titans
Debase the myths which give a face and a name
To any man made god

I still taste the blood of every god who fell to a titan in human form
Every god and every man mutually designed to overthrow themselves

A world's fate relies
On machines to survive
Only titans remain
Embrace the machine
To bring gods to their knees
Only titans remain

I see light break from afar
What seems like a rising sun
Eclipsed by Empyrean's horizon
My heart is restored a titan reborn
I'll never forgetâ¦

Utopia is only a dream

This distant light released from my eyes
To witness the city dividing the sky

The wails of machines
Singing cold harmony
Shifting air upward
Entranced by the breeze
Light pours like blood
Into a cosmic sea
Of stars crystallized
In a frozen symphony
