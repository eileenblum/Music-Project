From above the land
Armored with reflections of the sky
Towers pressing their chests
Against the elements

Unfazed by the chaos of the stars
How I lust to feel again
My eyes, my heart, my mind are at war
Unclear if this world can be called home

I stand in shadows of monuments
To shield my eyes from foreign lights

Unfazed by the chaos of the stars
How I lust to feel again
My eyes, my heart, my mind are at war
Unclear if this world can be called home

My eyes, my heart, my mind are at war
Unclear if this world can be called home

Unfazed by the chaos of the stars
How I lust to feel again
My eyes, my heart, my mind are at war
Unclear if this world can be called home
