From where I stand cities made of steel
Cradle the horizon
A global marvel gleaming with life
From above the clouds

You have sent many gods to be martyred

My calling resides within the space between
Cause and effect
What secrets lie behind
Both steel and flesh

Why has she instilled this disdain toward such awe
With her soft spoken declaration of war
She whispered to me
Bring this world to its knees

Let them reap what they sow
War and disease
My body shattered and cold
My mind wiped and restored

Synthetic sentience
Designed for war
My memory of earth will be painted once more
Brought back to life by the hands of a tyrant

Instincts reprogrammed, altered for war
My voice has been silenced
My heart wants no more
My calling resides within the space between

Cause and effect
What secrets lie behind
Both steel and flesh
I will force all those who breathe the air to drown in the dust of this world
I will blind all those who see with the light burning in me

You have sent many gods to be martyred

My body shattered and cold
My mind wiped and restored
Synthetic sentience
Designed for war
