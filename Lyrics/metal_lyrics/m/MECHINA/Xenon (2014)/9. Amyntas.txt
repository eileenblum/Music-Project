The transfer has halted
Memory frozen in place
Alithea
My heart, my home, my life now restored
What was lost in the blackness of space has been found
A life to reclaim
I awake in this silent room
A fleeting sense of direction

Reaching for her I grasp only air
I feel the pieces coming together

Let me remember the soft northern rains
Let me feel the warmth of the sun
Let me remember how to let the tears fall
Let me remember her eyes

Like two worlds bound by blood and steel
A bond turns to war
Forcing one side to kneel

Once put to rest in the halls of gods and kings

I awaken to the machine, breathing
Its mechanical heartbeat in sync with the glow of its eye
Now locking with mine, only humans will endure the cruelty of time
