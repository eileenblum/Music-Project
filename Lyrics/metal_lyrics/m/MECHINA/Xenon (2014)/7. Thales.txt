Covered in blood of the earth
Let it pour
Bring the flood let them drink
Drown in war

Her voice
Echoes like thunder
Let it pour
Her eyes sentenced this world to
Drown in a war

Humans have squandered every chance to find peace
Now let them reap what they sow

Behold a vigil that sets fire to the sky
Caged in orbit where Phedra lies
Its light draws a line
Between a conquered world and those who survived

Her voice
Echoes like thunder
Let it pour
Her eyes sentenced this world to
Drown in a war

Humans have squandered every chance to find peace
Now let them reap what they sow

A sense of direction
Instinctual synthetics
An unconscious connection
Through a joined reflection

Her bond bound by words of the past
Transparent yet cold
As memories of frozen glass
Retribution shall unfold

What is a name
When every face is an enemy
Xeno by those who fear life
Sentient by those who fear death
Remain nameless and live slow in the shadows
Or find what burns behind every light
And die as a titan
Die as a titan

Cursed as Xeno
Blood of Thales
We are Xeno
Born of Thales
