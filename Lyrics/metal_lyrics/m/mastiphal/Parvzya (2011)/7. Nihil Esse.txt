[music by Daamr, lyrics by Flauros]

Look at the eye all swollen with blood
Staining the cheeks with redness
Cutting my head they saw with surprise
A minor god as he fell out

Lost in black

Cocooned in mold I suffocate
The stench of my memories chokes me
Lips indifferent to deadening peace
Oblivion determines rebirth

In my own thoughts
I cannot be safe
My ignorance
Is so unsettling
Someone else knows me
He's watching me now

Funerals march in the streets of grief
Processions lit up by the dead
Their lips are moving but they are mute
Lost in the cries of mourning

Memory breaks the spell of loneliness
Unmoving eye now is drowned
Never expecting reality
Where are you leading me, temple of old
