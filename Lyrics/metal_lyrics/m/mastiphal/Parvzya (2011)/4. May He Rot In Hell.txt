[music by Daamr, lyrics by Flauros]

Night claws right into your soul's pane
Blackened view is spilled from silver moonlight
As it penetrates your mind and conscience
Stirring mud within you with its raven's beak

Red rust
Skies afire
Dreams of blood and ire
Red rust
Sky's in flames
May he rot in hell

Cold transparent doll comes knocking
Every night at empty window of your room
Let it in and let it lie close to your heart
Keep it warm with fever burning in your chest

You, little offspring; you, little devils
All shall spring to life from underneath my skin
Venomous and erring crossbreed
My thin scar is still aflame, there is no rest
