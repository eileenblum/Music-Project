[music by Daamr, lyrics by Flauros]

The moon panted above me
Like cadaverous moaning
Wet whips flagllated me
My blood was throbbing maddeningly

Scorn killing clouds
Their faces are fading
Their forever is dying
Behold the head of madness

One eye is open
The other is still asleep
One eye looking at us above
The other in its anxious slumber

The heart beats with the same rhythm
Everything's the same but time
Spring water dreams of the gutter
Among the storms
Among the element's confusion

The eye is opening the wall of phantoms
No passage to get through
The mesmeric s?ance is still going on
I'm closing my tired eyes
