[music by Oppressor, lyrics by Flauros]

The great world of human inspirations
Was fading away
Springs of creation have all run dry
In silence the beauty's decayed

Whole generations of men have marched
Into the blackened abyss of oblivion
And roamed in the numb nights of chaos
Remaining deaf to their desperate cries
Now I can see you lead the cortege
When the chalice of misery breaks
You cannot cover shameful secrets

Hidden so deep inside of you
They took of the gold crown you wore
With all your weakness brought to the light
The eye which sees all things as they are
Will scorn your pathetic power

Like a snake, you slither
Into the nocturnal sky
Like a snake, you wind
Around like grapevine
Like a snake, you bite
Full of deadly poison
Like a snake, you creep
Spitting venom
