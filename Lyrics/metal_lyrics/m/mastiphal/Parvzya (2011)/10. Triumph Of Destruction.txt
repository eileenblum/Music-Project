[music by Daamr, lyrics by Flauros]

By a deadly silent night
For my sword I reached
To the monarchs then I said
Who will spill more blood?

My torch awakens the world
Cities collapse in fire
My sketches all done in blood
Death kisses the enemy falling

Screams of annihilation
Lament, chaos and carnage
Red dawn spread like a swarm of locusts
Ranks of death all swollen with corpses

My triumph is now complete
Kneel at my throne of gore
The masterpiece of destruction
Attack, my minions, or perish
