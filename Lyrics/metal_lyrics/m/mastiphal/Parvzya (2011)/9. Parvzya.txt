[music by Oppressor, lyrics by Flauros]

The pain fell asleep at last
Tired of piercing screams
Tears are falling unnoticed
Snakes coiling up in my heart

Suffering never ends
Life's bitterness swells within
Fast transgressions they weigh me down
All turns from bad to worse

The fire is now ablaze
Set by a human hand
Flame everlasting to scorch the womb

My breathing's all heavy with grief
As I look at the world forsaken
Empty sorrow and helpless cries
Long gone days and glorious past
