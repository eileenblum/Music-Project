In these days the sun will eclipse
Only the moon will shine
The spirits of darkness will stand up to win
And I saw the deities sitting on the purple monsters
Full of blasphemous names and lust
For a glory of all evil spirits rise for victory
Pain for pain, blood for blood
Pagan warriors moved quickly forward
Bows are ready to shoot out their searing
Darts... Arouse are gone
Alive fires have fever in their eyes
Purple smoke surrounds everything - 
- blood, blood is burning gloomy earth
Is sunk in enemies blood
Evil passions, pride, anger, disdain
For losers!
