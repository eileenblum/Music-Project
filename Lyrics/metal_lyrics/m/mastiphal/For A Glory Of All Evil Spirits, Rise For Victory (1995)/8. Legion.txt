Earth trembles, fire blazes, dogs howl
A proud marsh in the moonlight
Pagan brothers marsh off
Dark force was growing in power
Dissemination of an unsacred seed

Warriors of the Night â evil is mind
Warriors of the Night â evil in a word
Warriors of the Night â evil in an act

Brightness of a fight fire
Burning sanctuaries
A shadow of death over enemies
Rumbling of the trumpets is heard
From far away
Herald of insane arrivals
