I saw the wind different that, I used to know
It moved not grass not trees, all colours
Were searings in the pitch black night
In noticed white sound less light,
Possessed only by the lightening
I thought night became white, day black
In fact there was no night, no day
There was only twilight coming nearer
And nearer
Smell of the darkness wrapped up
The forest you could see somewhere
Young prince shield
But heavy unusually shaped clouds
Appeared and made this even more
Cruel because of storms, hurricanes
That held the earth tight
Primary gates open your doors, 
Open your leafs locked by the time
Let me master of the fire, sickness
War and hatred and the darkest truth reign
This day is day of blood and glory
Master of them which stayed
Fire of stakes will attain.
