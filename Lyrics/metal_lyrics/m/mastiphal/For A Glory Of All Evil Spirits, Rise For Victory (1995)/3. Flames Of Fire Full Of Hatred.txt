I was dancing with immortal mother
At the Edge of mysterious lake
I was discovering old, forgotten mountains
I heard flapping wings and hoars cry over the forest,
I saw fire blazing from the roots,
Horrible cry was heard everywhere and
Everything became cry and stones were
Burning inside, and hidden pride, lie, false
And death appeared everywhere.
When moon will shine with it's full light
And I will find my way when human being 
Will be defeated.
In my memory human tree sadness gleaming
In it's eyes are the fire, that hasn't
Burnt out yet, flames of fires, full of hatred
I'll claim my rights, I won't forget my
Stolen dreams fire as the ancient monster
Will I destroy my enemies, it's time to
Create shadows full of hatred
Tough my magic wind you evil dance
These are Burning Fire, These are
Deities of Forests and mountains
I won't be sought, theirs dreams are
Silvering over the lakes, where heard
I trees crying
Moan of leafs being torn by the wind
Wrapped up by moss, exhausted, howling
To be seech the revenge again, And Again...
Flames of Fires full of hatred
