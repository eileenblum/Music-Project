The only night of darkness
Ritual dances by the fire
Fortune telling from the guts
Thrust down the Limbo
Eternal fire burning the bodies

Sacrifice and worship
Hunterâs pride
The mirror of soul
Confirmation of my faith 
Candles burning around 
Lightning ritual feasts 
Dreadful faces with eyes of fire 
Snakes wriggling
Naked witches dancing in ecstasy
Stone circles
