Blow thorns demons of night
Howl witches, Dearing a burden of unholiness 
And let summoned howling drown worthless
Bells full of mercy 

I fill up of burning thunder which will strike my enemy attain 
Summoned howling in the rain of burning blood 

Wake up dreams of blackest graves
We throw on requiem cloak 
Weâll bear a buraen of slaughter
On our hands will dry a blood of victims 

I worship wings of fogs
Which rise me to my brothers wolfs
