It's odd how we see things so perfectly clear when the hour of death is near 
No time for untangling the web that's weaved no time 
for claiming you don't believe no time for now it's the moment of truth . 
It's strange how we talk of the things that we'll do 
but can't seem to follow through . 
Waiting for a better day waiting for fortune to come our way waiting 
no more at the moment of truth 
The dream of achievement from twilight years with the setting sun disappears 
Opportunity came and went yesterday and taken or not left a price to pay . 
Let's take advantage of this day 
Our moment's not so far away 
A reconstruction of body soul 
and mind in preparation for the day we leave this life behind 
How we use this life of pain determines what we have to gain . 
It's strange how we talk of the things that we'll do 
but can't seem to follow through . 
And all that we should have comes perfectly clear when the hour of death is near 
No time for untangling the web that's weaved no time for claiming 
you don't believe no time for now it's the moment of truth . 
The dream of achievement from twilight years with the setting sun disappears 
Opportunity came and went yesterday and taken or not left a price to pay 
Let's take advantage of this day our moments not so far away 
How we use this life of pain determines what we have to gain...
