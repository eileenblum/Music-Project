Am I winning the war? 
Are you winning the fight? 
Is this winning? 
And when this is won is it the end or beginning? . 
In centuries past we've justified our fears. 
But now the decades pass like years. 
As technology and science suffocate taboos art and religion often lose . 
Do I think for myself? 
Are they thinking for me? 
Are you thinking? 
Am I rocking the boat or is it rocking me? 
Are we sinking? 
Are you listening to me? 
Am I hearing you right? 
Are they hearing? 
Is time going by or is it the past disappearing? . 
For every time we try to fightthe final war there always seems to be one more 
For every sanction the name of human rights another lost soul dies tonight 
For every cure there is a brand new disease. 
Mother nature's not so easily appeased. 
All the steps we make to keep ourselves alive amount to nothing 
when the hour of death arrives . 
Tell me the truth and I will know the truth . 
Lies are stained with death 
Tell me the truth and let me catch my breath . 
Do I get what I want? 
Do you want what you get? 
Is it taken? 
Do I know what I dream? 
If I die do I know I'll awaken? 
Do I die for the cause? 
Does the cause live through me? 
Am I dying? 
Could a cure give me life or could life be the cure? 
Are you trying? . 
Racing to find the answers 
Running to beat the hands of time. 
Pushing forward fighting back.
Where's the finish line? 
I need to catch my breath 
In centuries past we've justified our fears. 
But now the decades pass like years, as technology 
and science suffocate taboos 
Art and religion often lose . 
Racing to find the answers, running to beat the hands of time 
Pushing forward fighting back where's the finish line? 
I need to catch my breath
