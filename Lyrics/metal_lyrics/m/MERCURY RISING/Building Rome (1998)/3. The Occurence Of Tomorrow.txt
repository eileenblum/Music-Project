The view within a child's eyes is none too cautious none too wise 
Everything is what it seems 
Believing I could live the dream I stood as 
David in the street Goliath to defeat 
But that day before the sun would set a lesson I would not forget I'd learn 
Shown my insignificance somewhere somehow tables have been turned . 
They had lied to me they could have set me free by speaking honestly . 
Now God only knows what tomorrow brings 
Best to set my sights on more important things 
Deciphering life's song and of the truth I'll sing . 
Calling them as I see As it occurs to me 
Endless integration manifest destination not for me 
Wrestling indecision throwing inhibitions to the sea . 
Voices in the night that said I'd fail and still I might 
But on that day myself I'll own a king who failure can't dethrone 
I'll navigate this wasteland and find a place to make a stand . 
I'll fight my Armageddon there when confidence consumes despair. 
And on that judgement day I'll see the spoils that are due to me 
For believing as a child would that if I tried I surely could succeed . 
They had lied to me they could have set me free and told me honestly 
The truth submerged beneath life's waterfall 
As if it's mighty force could baptize sins away 
But through the whirlpools and the foam 
I see refracted glimpses of what I should be 
Reflection so unclear, too quickly fade away . 
Mightier still the pen than sword whose blade 
is naught to the almighty written word 
The consequences I'll afford . 
Calling them as I see as it occurs to me
