As winds of change begin to blow 
At times when spirit's running low 
For all you've done nothing to show 
By holding on a little longer .... 
We find the fire makes us stronger 
And through it all we learn endurance is the key to our proficiency, 
with faith the only way to survive another day . 
If it's true that tribulation worketh patience, 
then I should be a patient man but patient is not what I am 
Now questioning the terms of my existence no anchor here to steady me . 
Alone I face a raging sea 
For everyone there's a specific point in time 
where physical improvement changes to decline 
Although I can't recall that moment it was long before today 
and still I haven't said the things I need to say . 
To turn from anger and temptation is just a distant memory 
when confronted by reality 
And Jonah like denying my salvation 
I struggle with myself each day while precious hours slip away . 
In an age of kings and drones there's no denying, 
freedom is a narrow door which can't be promised anymore 
Still destined to forever keep on trying 
I crave tomorrow's rising sun another chapter just begun . 
I know there is a reason for why this world is such 
That an honest man gets taken and the wicked get so much 
I know there is a reason for losses we acquire 
And if the fire is what purifies I'll stand this trial by fire . 
At times when spirit's running low. 
For all you've done nothing to show. 
Triumph is never letting go
