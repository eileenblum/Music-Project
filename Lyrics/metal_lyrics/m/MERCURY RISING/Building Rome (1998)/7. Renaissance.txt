[Prayer Part 2]

How many times will I plead on bended knee before 
I transcend to the one you would have me to be? . 
Bless us now as we build anew 
Grant us values to hold on to regardless of the evils that men do . 
From perseverance purity shines through 
In this brave new world there's no home sweet home, 
and so we carry on building Rome . 
Unto you we will make a joyful sound 
Unto you our praises will abound 
Unto you we combine both mind and heart 
Understanding they can't survive apart 
What it's worth to me... Eternity! . 
How many times will I plead on bended knee before I transcend 
to the one you would have me to be 
In this brave new world there's no home sweet home and so we carry on building Rome
