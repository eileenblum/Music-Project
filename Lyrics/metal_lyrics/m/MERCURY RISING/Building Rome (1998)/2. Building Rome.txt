Broken dreams and wasted time stain yesterday 
From the aftermath we climb We found a way to beat the odds turn darkness 
into light ascending from the fire again . 
From winds of change and sacrifice scars we bear. 
And even now we pay the price 
Atonement is rare and never gained by bounty or the sword 
Only through spirit and faith 
And all that we accomplish so quickly we ignore 
The only path worth walking is a path not walked before . 
Only time will tell if renaissance is really worth the cost 
But even if we fail the lessons learned will compensate the loss . 
Those who dream must stand alone but can't you see we're building Rome . 
In an age where craft is all 
but lost to accelerated automation behold the sea of compromise we've crossed 
delivered from the grip of it's temptation . 
The building of a monument reflective of a time when a man's art was an open 
testimony to his mind a statement of his honor and a sample of his soul 
We build in search of ways to make it so . 
Only time will tell if renaissance is really worth the cost 
But even if we fail, the lessons learned will compensate the loss . 
Those who dream must stand alone but can't you see we're building Rome . 
Broken dreams and wasted time stain yesterday 
From the aftermath we climb 
We found a way to beat the odds turn darkness into light 
Ascending from the fire again
