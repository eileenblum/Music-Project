Lesser men eventually will fall 
But there are no alternatives for those who hear the call 
What lesser men have failed to see I hope you realize and accompany me . 
The fateful myth exhausts them everyday that no one cares 
and nothing really matters anyway 
What lesser men tend to believe I hope you'll realize and not be deceived . 
Behind their empty lives are empty minds as well that lead them 
into hell without a prayer 
Just beyond their hopelessness a leap of faith is waiting for us there . 
A lesser man who's only plan is misery loves company 
Discontentment haunting every-day but for trusting souls 
with lofty goals the promised land is plain to see it's just a leap of faith away . 
A man without a purpose is a back against the wall 
But a crosscut of the endless array that is this life tells...ALL! . 
What lesser men tend to believe I hope you'll realize 
and not be deceived I hope you'll realize and accompany me . 
Behind their empty lives are empty minds as well that lead them 
into hell without a prayer just beyond their hopelessness 
A leap of faith is waiting for us there
