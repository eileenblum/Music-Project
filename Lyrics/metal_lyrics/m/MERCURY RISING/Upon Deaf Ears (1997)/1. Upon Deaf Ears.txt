Blinded you shelter me from reality 
Hanging on never wrong crucifying me 
Altars smoke blackened through the years 
Never washed by tears frozen there With my despair for your security 
Once more the drama begins in passion play rivals don't win 
Feel the weaker of the two where the skin is thin the pain shows through 
The pain shows through Shadows once denied reveal anger and selfish pride 
Your emotions on parade at my expense tedious charade 
Awakened, as if I was never there in your greedy care 
Out from hell Azrael calmly pulls my soul 
Risen, from a sunken fate reanimate 
Ancient vow helpless now stripped of its control control 
I won't drink violence you demand Fool's message falls from nervous hands 
Clearing skies give way (hear my suicide) 
The spirit and the bride said come and I betrayed 
The stone now rolled away (it took my will) 
I found the miracle within tedious charades
