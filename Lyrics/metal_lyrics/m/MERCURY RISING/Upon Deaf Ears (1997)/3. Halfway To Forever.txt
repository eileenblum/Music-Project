Before the ancient cultures the first birth of a sun 
Through decades generations and eons yet to come 
In a time when there was nothing there still existed time 
And when the human race is done it will leave us all behind 
The days we judge by hours the years we judge by days 
But looking at eternity there's so many different ways 
To some it means religion to some just an idea 
Some men can't see past today but to me it's coming clear 
[Chorus:] 
Alpha and omega except for eternity 
What you thought unreal has finally come to be 
Never say never because you might have to see 
Halfway to forever is where we will always be 
When you think in terms of what's to come and what has gone before 
Are you bound by your own lifetime or is there something more 
The only guarantee in life is a lifetime guarantee 
All the world's a stage an when the show's done we'll still be.... 
Just a tiny atom in a never ending sea 
The most a single life could ever be 
And when this world is gone for the worse or for the better 
We'll still be only halfway to forever 
[Solo: Dolliver] 
[Solo: Goldsmith] 
With a dream of immortality each man completes his tasks 
To conquer what is infinite he knows not what he asks 
To step across the border that defines the age of man 
Yet that is just a tiny grid in an endless master plan
