In secret rooms with whispered words they spoke of changes 
A new world order free of fault to span the ages 
A perfect plan in a perfect world the perfect fantasy 
And I know that next that it's me 
An unfinished fight is a thief in the night 
That returns to tear out your heart 
Ashes to ashes dust to dust enemy armor left to rust 
One strike is all that it takes One strike an enemy makes 
One strike bringer of changes suffer the pain cause it's war 
An upper echelon power grip money's talking 
In the streets it has turned its back a nightmare stalking 
The scales of justice work for some and let the rest go free 
As the blood runs through your hands I know that next it's me 
One strike is all that it takes 
One strike an enemy makes 
One strike bringer of changes suffer the pain cause it's war 
[Solo: Dolliver] 
[Solo: Goldsmith] 
In churches built for worship the altars are empty 
To finance a minority rule the offerings are plenty 
A perfect plan in a perfect world perfect hipocrisy 
And I know next that it's me 
One strike is all that it takes 
One strike an enemy makes 
One strike bringer of changes suffer the pain cause it's war
