Constantly I find myself searching for answers 
Only to learn I didn't really want to know 
But now and then upon a circumstance 
There waits discovery enlightenment we all need light to grow 
Walking empty streets at night silhouette in moonlight 
Petitioning revelation to bring life's frustration down 
Discovery revelation 
Enlightenment to end frustration 
Suddenly I seem so small in my surroundings 
An iota of something so much more 
Eons will erase a man no matter what his victories 
Light breaks through a newly opened door 
To realize I'm just a man helpless in a master plan 
Knowledge an open door 
Infinity a slave no more 
Discovery I must know 
Offer me light to grow 
Supply me the power to make it so 
Supply me with light to grow 
Out from life's undertow 
Nourish me with light to grow 
Possibilities expanding all around me 
Even in the depths of my despair 
Fight to gain dominion over feelings that surround me 
Enter reality they vanish in thin air 
Constantly I find myself searching for answers 
Only to learn I didn't really want to know 
But now and then upon a circumstance 
There waits discovery enlightenment we all need light to grow
