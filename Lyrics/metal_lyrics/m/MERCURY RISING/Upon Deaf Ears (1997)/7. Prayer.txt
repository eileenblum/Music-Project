Endless is the road I walk merciless is time 
Frustrations black and white contentment less defined 
Bravery through confidence humility with pride I can face tomorrow if supplied 
This course was set at your decree surely you must have a plan for me 
This prayer I give to you tonight Lead and direct me with your guiding light 
Instill me with the power to smile even as 
I push myself to walk the extra mile 
Fuel me with desire like phoenix to rise from a fire 
I offer up but what I am another lost and lonely lamb
