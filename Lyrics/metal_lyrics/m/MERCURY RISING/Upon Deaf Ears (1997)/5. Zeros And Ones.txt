Coincide 
Subdivide, technical wars 
Formulate 
Calculate industries whores 
Little faults in the system 
Always reducing men to their ranks in a time of no choosing 
Balance is gone assiduity 
Resplendent drone deranged machine 
See what I mean 
Monochrome skies paint future scenes of a corporate scheme 
Graft display turn away the poor and the weak 
Always there they don't care bow down at their feet 
Sinews of war and all the redemption go up in smoke 
There's been no reflection grinding their gears a prosaic aim 
So when you look what do you see vulgarity 
Monochrome skies paint future scenes of a corporate scheme 
Hidden orbs focus in on me impart neuroticy 
To a liquid mind all they find is a piece of time 
Confounding what's left of me Modern medicine a form of strategy 
Designed to ensure our purity 
Endeavor for immortality 
Zeros and ones defining me 
Dollar signs are everywhere 
Incorporated stare a lighthouse for the blind 
Meiropol is standing by to quench the truthful lie 
Computer serving mind 
Silent loudness now speaks to me imprinted echoes ring endlessly 
Emotion stripped down to the core 
An impulse nothing more inside our empty selves 
Sex is sterile now alone now anyone can own a piece of someone else 
Predictability is comforting 
Vapid gray this future seen 
[Solo: Goldsmith] 
Zeros and ones are all that we are 
Sins of the thinking machine have brought us this far 
Human error replaced by efficiency 
A permanent program raping mortality 
When man is reduced to a number sums and equations defined 
Replaced by zeros and ones he'll be left behind 
[Solo: Dolliver]
