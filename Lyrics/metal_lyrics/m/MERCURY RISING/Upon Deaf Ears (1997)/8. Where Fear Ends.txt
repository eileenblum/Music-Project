I've felt the deadly grip of compromise 
And fought to keep conviction burning in my eyes 
Surrender perseverance doesn't recognize 
And with the light of each new day I'll find my way 
Beneath the pulsing beat of neon heat and city streets 
Or on a mountain side under moonlit sky with stars on high 
The answer lies not so much in where you are 
But destination and what you'll find 
Into the fire some would throw their lives 
And hope that with security and fear subsides 
Dreams and ambitions they would choose to hide 
A disregarded spirit leaves them empty inside 
Inside of every man a master plan the high command 
Truth to one's self is shelter from the storm and keeps the sin unborn 
The greatest truth I've ever known has been where truth begins where fear ends 
How sad a man could lose his destiny to the powers that be in this world 
For just outside this lifetime is a higher call stand or fall 
Victory is more than just security 
Affluency has no jurisdiction over death 
Victorious the man who stands his ground and won't go down 
But offers to the cause his every breath 
I've felt the deadly grip of compromise 
And fought to keep conviction burning in my eyes 
Surrender perserverence doesn't recognize 
And with the light of each new day 
I'll find my way 
I've seen the empty eyes, believing lies hypnotized 
I stand uncompromised and await the new sunrise 
The greatest truth 
I've ever known has been where truth begins is where fear ends 
Victory is more than just security 
Affluency has no jurisdiction over death 
Victorious the man who stands his ground and won't go down 
But offers to the cause his every breath
