Look in the glass at the universal ice 
Through it I pass at the speed of light 
I walk the decades ten at a step or make the moment freeze in my grip 
I breathe the centuries 
I bend your destinies 
I bind reality 
I am galactic energy 
I sing the song of Saturn's rings 
I tightwalk on cosmic strings 
I wrote the music Venus sings 
I handed Mercury his wings 
I am the reason seasons turn and why the lakes in hell still burn 
I am forever... 
I am the minute man 
[Solo: Dolliver] 
[Solo: Goldsmith] 
I build the empires 
I appoint the lords 
I set the standards 
I swing the swords 
I paint the shadows behind the doors 
I chose the heroes 
I pay the whores 
I bare within my mind treasures you'll never find 
I govern space and time 
I watch the world through ancient eyes I sing the song of Saturn's rings 
I tightwalk on cosmic strings 
I wrote the music venus signs 
I handed Mercury his wings 
And I'm the reason seasons turn and why the lakes in hell still burns 
I am forever... 
I am the minute man
