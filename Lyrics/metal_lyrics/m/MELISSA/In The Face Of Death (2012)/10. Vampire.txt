Having just began to live
I got tired with my life
I have lost what I was
Looking for in this world

Tiredness and pain I feel
all the best of life I've seen
So I leave this world to be free

Reflections of strange drawings
Are flying inside of me
Pale reminiscences of mine after-death
Or long before my birth

[solo : P.G.]

I've been dead for millions years
My real Present is the past
Rebuced to bust a corpse I am
Yet I am not born

I'm alive - reflection is dead
Life illusion end
As the circle is closed, my life begins

Pain...
Feel the cold pride
Of indifference
No more pain...

[solo : P.G.]

When the wind blows away
The vanity of a sullen vague day
I feel in my dark soul
The reflection of the night
That takes me up high
Pain is so sweet...
As still water in dark fathoms

[solo : N.T.-P.G.]
