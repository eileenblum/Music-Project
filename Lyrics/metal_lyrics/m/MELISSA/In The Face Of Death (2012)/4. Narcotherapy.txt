[solo : P.G.]

I watched funeral service
being performed over me
I watched me dead
I watched me buried
But I felt myself standing on the cloud,
looking down
Oh, please help me narcotherapy.

I watched me lying still
In my beautiful coffin
I watched me dead
I watched me buried
But I felt myself standing on the cloud,
looking down
Where my black soul first kissed
the mouth of sin
Oh, please give me the password to darkness
Help me with your narcotherapy

[solo : P.G.]
