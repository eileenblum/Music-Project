My only hope degrades
My swallowed pride intoxicates
My morbid fears will not decay
The last decade of pain and horror

This terror desolates
A heart of stone that never fails
Cute paranoia hides within
My tortured worlds that always kill you

Kill!
I'm insane to escape
This daymare that will never end
Insanity will not descend
Once within eradicate this tortured dreams that always kill you
Kill!

Void, nothing, empty, null
Degenerated code of dumb
My haunted body, i decay
Inspired through worship of the devil

This terror desolates
A heart of stone that never fails
Cute paranoia hides within
My tortured worlds that always kill you
