I can live today
My mind's not lead astray
In the dusk of weary hours
The future is faraway
I can live today
The future is faraway

Languish for sympathy
No zero interaction

Life was just one word away
Life was just one look away

Life was. just one smile away
Life was just one touch away

I could live today
My mind's not lead astray
In the dusk of weary hours
The pain was faraway
