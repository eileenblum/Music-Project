[ theme : N.T.]
Consumed with hatred
I'm looking to the west
Where shadows are gathering
In their twilight dance
Dance of death, music of dark skies
To the west, where the Eye beckons me

[theme : N.T.]

Consumed with hatred
I'm looking to the west
As the bloody sun is setting
In the mountains
Sounds of death, music of dark skies
To the west, where the Eye beckons me

God, forgive my sick free spirit
For I... For I have cursed you in my heart

[solo : P.G.]

Consumed with hatred
I'm looking to the west
Where shadows are gathering
In their twilight dance
As the bloody sun is setting
In the mountains

Where the Eye beckoned me

[bass solo : S.O.]
