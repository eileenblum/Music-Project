I've been hurring to you
My last wish
My life
Sacrificing the dearest

Be dead
You one be used by all
Be dead, bye
In the name of life
Be dead

In my dreams pain goes by
I should kill, I should die
Move your legs, smash my face
Broken bones
I hate you
All 4-1

Be dead
You one be used by all
Be dead, bye
In the name of life
Be dead

In my dreams pain goes by
I should kill, I should die
Move your legs, smash my face
Broken bones
I hate you
I hate you, I HATE YOU
All 4-1
One for all
