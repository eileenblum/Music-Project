Dark wind tousles my hair
Sorrow is spread in my soul
My fear is my fate
Smell of pain beyond the beautiful clouds

My bleeding eyes
Is your evil beauty
My dreams are hidden deep inside
In my mind
Your love is wrapped
In your evil beauty

Everlasting entire pain
Drowns me in the river of madness

This beauty
It haunts me
It's my death
It wants me

[solo : N.T.]

My bleeding eyes
Is your evil beauty
My dreams are hidden deep inside
In my mind
Your love is wrapped
In your evil beauty

Sunk in a brown study
I am lost in a forest of mourning

My bleeding eyes
Is your evil beauty
My dreams are hidden deep inside
In my mind
Your love is wrapped
In your evil beauty

[solo : P.G.]
