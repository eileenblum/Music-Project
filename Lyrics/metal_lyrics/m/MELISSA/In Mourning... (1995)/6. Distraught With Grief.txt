Rain filled the sky
Birds and clouds scattered in pools
Death is always right
You knew it but told me nothing

[solo : N.T.]

It broke my peace
Crying sky under my feet
Interfere with my ease
Your agony stays forever
In my heart

Walk barefoot on pools
Dreams of your caress
Flatter myself with hope
I am distraught with grief
