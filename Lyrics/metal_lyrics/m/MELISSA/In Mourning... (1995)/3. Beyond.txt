[theme : N.T.]
Beyond the clouds
The dream of death comes close
Where my sorrow drowns
In the mourning sea

Bent I stand, lost in through
Glowing sunset in my eyes
Naked sky upon a hill
Crossing shadows in the twilight wood

I'm the victim to the morbid devil
Pain of mine is no more real
Though I walk through shadow valley of death
I will fear no evil

[theme : N.T.]

Beyond the clouds
The dream of death comes close
Where my sorrow drowns
In the mourning sea

[solo : P.G.]

Silence laceration
Epitaph of mine I've seen
Bloody rain upon a hill
It is mournful weeping Jesus tears

The Angel of Death who holdeth the bronze lamp
Beyond the golden door
Hath taken me into dark waters
He is the mourning angel of mine

[solo : P.G.]
