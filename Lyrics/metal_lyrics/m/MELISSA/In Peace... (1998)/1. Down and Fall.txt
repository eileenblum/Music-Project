I see them down and fall

She came and broke the night  
But I've forgotten, how...  
Explode our love out here  
As we brake the light  

Somewhere the shades calm down  
Where feelings spectrum dies  
Sample the pointless fears  
With our heads held high  

The Darkness dwells like a Shadow on the wall  

I see them down and fall...
