Hamburg - killercity  
Bob Lancelot in pity  
A heating distrophytting  
That's why you lost your weight  
Simple minds are eating  
My password are not cheating  
The words are not defeating  
My gore-dom... is not there...  

Or won't you fall in deep  
Won't you feel indeed  
Won't you see my eyes  
Won't you hear my cries  

Or won't you see it deep  
Won't you feel indeed  
Won't you hear my lies  
Or don't ya ?  

Or doncha feel the sky ?  

Cold stars falling down  
Dream of paradise  
Falling on the inflamed   
Skin of my eyes  
Yet innocence is bleeding  
Running with my blood  
Harmony - can't reach it  
And solitude - sweet love -  

Or won't you fall in deep  
Won't you feel indeed  
Won't you see my eyes  
Won't you hear my cries  

Or won't you see it deep  
Won't you feel indeed  
Won't you hear my lies  
Or don't ya ?  

Or doncha feel the sky ?  

Or won't you fall in deep  
Won't you feel indeed  
Won't you see my eyes  
Won't you hear my cries  

Or won't you see it deep  
Won't you feel indeed  
Won't you hear my lies  
Or don't ya ?  

Or doncha feel the sky ?  

I want...  
I want me to see
