I feel myself changing  
No regrets about this  
I hate them all  
I am them all  

I want me to see  
That's what I need   
To be my own self  

They come and go  
But I stay  
They leave scars  
But do they hurt ?  

I feel myself changing  
Too much thinking about this  
I want them all  
I am them all  

I want me to see  
That's what I need   
To be my own self  

They come and go  
But I stay  
They leave scars  
But do they hurt ?
