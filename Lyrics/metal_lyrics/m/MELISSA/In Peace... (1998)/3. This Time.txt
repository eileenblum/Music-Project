I've seen unlockable doors  
I've felt invisible nods  
And unchangeable gods  

I've been in trouble for laws  
I've heard unsingable birds  
Did you feel just the same ?  

This time  
No shapeless dreams, no sleepless nights  
This time  
This is my world you can't deny  

No more, do you hear me, feel me  
I don't want you anymore  
Feel me, Hate me, Love me, Rape me  
I've never felt like this before  

I've known reliable youth  
I've seen believable truth  
And unmistakable proof  

I've never stood on my knees  
I've never known a silent peace  
Did you feel just the same ?  

This time  
No shapeless dreams, no sleepless nights  
This time  
This is my world you can't deny  

No more, do you hear me, feel me  
I don't want you anymore  
Feel me, Hate me, Love me, Rape me  
I've never felt like this before  

This time  
No shapeless dreams, no sleepless nights  
This time  
This is my world you can't deny
