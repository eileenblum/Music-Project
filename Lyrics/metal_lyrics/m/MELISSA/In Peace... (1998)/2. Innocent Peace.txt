Suffocated with wind of my freedom  
I regain my peace  

My wounds do not bleed   
Anymore  
My thoughts do not hurt  
Nevermore  

My mind - opened, free  
now free again  
My memories cleaned  
cleaned me and killed  
The light now so clear  
the sounds so pure  
Now this is my  
Innocent peace  

I managed to make  
a step away from myself  
No stumbling again,  
no falling in pain  
Suffocated with wind of my freedom  
I regain my peace  

My wounds do not bleed   
Anymore  
My thoughts do not hurt  
Nevermore  

This is my innocent peace
