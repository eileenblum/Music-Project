Does blood ever spill  
Of those who took the final race ?  
Why do I say these words ?  
These feelings are besides my own  

Living, giving, striking  
Dying to do our best  

A dead will burned to misery  
As infinity consumes the Mind  

Drown...  
Infernal blindness salutes with rotten lips  
Possessive imagination  
Retarded remains cremation  
Fear falls to human forms  
Down where feelings lie apart  
One space following another  
And I... Why did I hurt?  

Burning...  
Burning...  

Does blood ever spill  
Of those who took the final race ?  
Why do I say these words ?  
These feelings are besides my own  

Living, giving, striking  
Dying to do our best  

A dead will burned to misery  
As infinity consumes the Mind
