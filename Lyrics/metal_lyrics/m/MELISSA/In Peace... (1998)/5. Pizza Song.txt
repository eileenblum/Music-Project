I've shown her Moon in cases  
A Man of one day runes  
I saw her coming home from school  
But only beer was on my mind  
Hey chick, come on let's brake it  
Let's fake it, I want this done  
She said - "come one, let's dance tonight!"  
I said -   

Come on let's sing The Song!  

She wants it cheap and cracking -   
How 'bout a song for free?  
I've seen Jean coming dragging  
Dragging pizza home  
"I want to break Moon-Man" - fine!  
And brain-men start to puke  
I would have brought some beer and chicks  
And no more pizza on my mind  
Heating in between  
Getting in between  
I want to see her brain!  
Yeah, it's gotta be clean!  
How   'bout   her   legs?  
Oh   look   my   here...  
STOP!  

Come on let's sing The Song!
