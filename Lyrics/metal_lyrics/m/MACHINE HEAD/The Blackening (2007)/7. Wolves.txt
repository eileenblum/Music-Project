[Music: Flynn / Demmel / Duce, Lyrics: Flynn]

Unleash the wolves
Carnage has no rules
Comparison, competition
We'll bury one and all

[Solo: Demmel]

Look in the eyes of rage
A loyalty bred of suffering
The fire inside it burns eternally,
victory
Look in the eyes of pain
The scars on our souls forever remain
Calling the sheltered of the broken wing,
join the fray

Bury our rivals
Shotguns, knives, rifles

[Pre Chorus:]
A family of the unwanted
Beaten, stunted, dysfunction
A brotherhood that is of violence and to tyrants bow to none

[Chorus:]
Unleash the wolves
Carnage has no rules
Comparison, competition
We'll bury one and all

Look in the eyes of hate
A circle of hell they come to pray
United against all that come threatening
Lay to waste

Look in the eyes of the free
Bound to each other's longevity
Guarding the back of alpha's dignity,
Savagely

Bury our rivals
Shotguns, knives, rifles

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Come closer, walk with me in hell
Dear rival, fear in you I smell
A fist to face is all fair game now
The pack attacking, the sacrificial
Pray for the prayers

Reaping the sour seeds of death's breed
In tooth and claw the scent of the dead

Spreading our population
Far across the land
Loving to fornicate,
Respecting the command
Rally the warriors and
Tally the score,
In every victory is solace but there's

No satisfaction!!
There is no satisfaction!!
And there never will be!

[Solo: Flynn, Demmel, Flynn, Demmel]

Bury our rivals
Shotguns, knives, rifles

[Pre Chorus 2x]
[Chorus]

Unleash the wolves
Carnage has no rules
The night will fall
Beware the call
Dominate all
