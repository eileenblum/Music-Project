[Music: Flynn / McClain / Duce / Demmel, Lyrics: Flynn]

This is a call to arms,
Will you stand beside me?
This is our time to fight
No more compromising
And this blackened heart will sing
For sad solidarity

Halo over our demise
Following a god so blind
Sallow in their sickening
Swallow not, the shit they feed

This is a right to life,
Not the Religious Right's act
This is abortion's knife,
Aiming at the wombs of
The Christian conspiracy
See open thine eyes and see, the

Halo over our demise
Following a god so blind
Sallow in their sickening
Swallow not, the shit they feed

Our time will come, our time will come
Our time is now, our time is now

[Solo: Demmel, Flynn &amp; Demmel]

And I won't pray for you

Halo over our demise
Following a god so blind
Sallow in their sickening
Swallow not, the shit they feed

The words will never hold us down
Prayers won't be spared on you
Satisfaction denied
'Til you're dead and gone
Gone
Dead and gone!
You're gone!
