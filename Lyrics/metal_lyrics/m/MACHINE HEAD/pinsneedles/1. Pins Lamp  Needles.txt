I got my pride and that's all I need I am going to fly high as I can be
Not backing down from anyone or anything that comes my way
I got my fists and that's all I need I got time on my side and that's all I need
I'm bringing out the lion that is deep in my soul, deep in my soul

I'm walking on pins and needles
What lie but numb from this feeling
I'm choking from broken words spoken
I'll find another way, to fight another day
I'm walking on pins and needles, I'm walking on pins and needles
I'm walking on pins and needles find another way, to fight another day

I got a beer and that's all I need, I got a beer and that's all I need
I'm breaking every bottle just to break something other than me
I got my girl and that's all I need so just, leave me alone because that's all I need
I'm tired of the bullshit so I'm getting high, I'm getting high

Show me what's inside ripping at your heart eating you alive tearing you apart
I'm broken from choking the need to
Get high and fuck up like you, so
I thrive on reviving my will to
Fight another day, find another way
Another way another way
ANOTHER WAY
