and i watched through bitter yeys
as the blood filled in the cracks black
a burning effigy
told me i should kneel 'cause

i'm worshipping
with terror, a disease
burn the sacred oil

[chorus:]
they told us there'd never come a day
they told us that we need not worry
so we fucked around, thought this shit would change
and turned our eyes away

i am the power siege
and the rush you will feel, thrill
exploding out of me
through clenched teeth i will scream out

we're suffering
with malice you deceive
puke sold as salvation

[chorus]
[lead: Logan]

and i watched it slip away
and you watched it slip away
and we watched it slip away
cause no one took a stand
