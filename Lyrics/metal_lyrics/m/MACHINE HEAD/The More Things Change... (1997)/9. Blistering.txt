you stabbed me in the back over a sliver
a feeling i have been betrayed
both hands broken together
clenching fists cause the rage

[chorus:]
it comes in spades
from a life of pain
i don't care 'cause i don't give a fuck
it tears a path right through me

a systematic vision of survival
a struggle i alone engage
tension burning inside me
blood so sweet cause revenge

[chorus]

revenge i mine
suffering divine
fractures break through bone
frustrating won't let go

filled with lead and dumped into the river
and burned in a shallow grave
both hands broken together
clenching fists cause the rage
