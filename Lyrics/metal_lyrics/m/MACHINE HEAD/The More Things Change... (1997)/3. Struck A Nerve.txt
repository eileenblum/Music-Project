give me power to end all of the strife
courage to kill the pro-life

i don't want to see
you can't change me
you tell me not to bow
just follow for how
you're oh so holier than thou

[chorus:]
the more things change
the more they stay the same
the more
things change
the more
they stay the same

give me patience to deal with all the strain
balance to take the fuckin' pain

i don't want to fake
and i won't break
wo're too happy to be
in our apathy
we smile single file to the line

[chorus]

so c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
we gotta wake up
you don't know you're hight
your right from wrong
we gotta wake up
