i want you to know this
i want you to know just what i feel
you told me through sacred lies
i told you once with bloodshot eyes
you told me don't ask
just stay away from me
you told me it'd be alright
i told you once, then told you twice
you can't face
can't you face me

[chorus:]
i won't pray for you
i can't pray for you
because you took it away
because you took it from me

[first verse]
[chorus]

thought i could never ever fuckin' find another
get a muthafuckin' chance again
because th epower is the rage that can devour
gotta make that fear descend

without it, you ain't shit
and you ain't shit to me
berating, a scathing
grave idignity
i see the look inside your eyes
it makes me sick
defiling innocence
is how you get your kicks
you violate, and then you think yourself a man
you violate, and then you call yourself a man
don't come my way
don't care what you say
pray you fuckin' die
before you feel my...

rage...
