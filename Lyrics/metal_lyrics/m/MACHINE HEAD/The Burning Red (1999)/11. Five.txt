I remember, it was the month October
In a garage, i was standing scared and sober
I could smell your breathing, and the pain your leaving
So ashamed, i feel it
And now i am left to fate

For all the times I'd be losing my mind
You molest and destroy just a five year old boy
And you make me suffer, motherfucker
Ripped my heart out
It was so good

I remember words that never left me
From a stroke of 'til the here's what you do for me
If you tell, I'll kill you
Rip the tongue out from you
Wish that i could stop you
Please god make this go away

For all the times I'd be losing my mind
You molest and destroy just a five year old boy
And you make me suffer, mother fucker
Ripped my heart out
Innocence was lost

And i feel it
I can't take it
I don't want it
Anymore

Was only five
And i feel it
Cant take it anymore

For all the times i heard you
Say in my god damned mind
Make it sooner if i suck you
I'd make you suffer
Make you suffer
Motherfucker

For all the times I'd be losing my mind
You molest and destroy just a five year old boy
And you make me suffer, motherfucker
Ripped my heart out..
...I was only five...
...Five...
