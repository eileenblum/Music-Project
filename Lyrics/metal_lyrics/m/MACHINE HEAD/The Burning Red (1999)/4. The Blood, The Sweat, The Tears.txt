Oh yes i walk the path, that righteous
Many men have walked before
In this pain cell
The broken shell
Straight shackled onto the floor

So welcome to the world
That i lived in
Puking up bile and hate
My world entered
A false enclosure
Sickening broken state

But then I see
These things in me
That make me want it
More than you

Want to deny your flesh
Cause pain's my wish
Get wasted on self destruct

So hold on to the end

It's all about
The blood, the sweat, the tears
Attribute to the strength
Built through the years

[2X]

Yes i walk the path
That gives me
Confidence strong and pure
Now i realize
That freedom rises
From confronting the source

I built these walls around me
And i can break them all away
And I'll focus all the strength
I call unstoppable energy

So hold on to the end

It's all about
The blood, the sweat, the tears
Attribute to the strength
Built through the years

[2X]

Hold on
I'm falling
I'm falling down again too

It's all about
The blood, the sweat, the tears
Attribute to the strength
Built through the years

I've been there
Cause I once hit a wall
Cause I once hit a wall
Cause I once hit a wall
