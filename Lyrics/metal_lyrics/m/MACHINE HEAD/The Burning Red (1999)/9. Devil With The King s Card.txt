I will see you rise and fall
I will be you rise and fall
I will make you rise and fall
I create your rise and fall
And I will be you

Got bored with me because I'm
Born with conviction
From a pain you'll never ever understand, understand
Never forget what I said cause you ain't half of me
I'll tear down and break anything that stands in front of me
I'm taking down what the fuck is ever in my way
So get way

I will see you rise and fall
I will be you rise and fall
I will make you rise and fall
I create your rise and fall
And I will be you

But for me I'll forgive despite your actions
Cos you never ever ever act on what you said
Like you said
Give it to me, let it be,
But you're the one who quit
You said it yourself, you're the best
and you can handle it
The cry, watch how Machine Head takes it all, it all

And i feel for you
Cos your eyes they whore
And I think I hurt
Cos of something more
You see I'm falling
All apart
Cos your eyes they
Decide your heart

Rise and fall
And I will make the walls fall
And I will make the walls fall
And I will make the walls fall
And I will make the walls fall
Down.. Down.. Fall down.. Fall down..

I will see you rise and fall
I will be you rise and fall
I will make you rise and fall
I create your rise and fall
And I will be you
