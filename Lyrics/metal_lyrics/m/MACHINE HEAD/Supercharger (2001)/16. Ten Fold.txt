Check check check check!
Ten fold, Ten fold, We grow ten fold, Ten fold, Ten fold!
We got these so-called friends,
Claiming way too hard to have all that.
When it comes down to it,
It's them who's talking the most.
They got a problem with us,
Cause we tell it how it is.
Well listen up, motherfucker's we're telling you how it is.
If you're a friend, then say good things behind all of our backs.
I hear too many tall tales,
Gettin' told like they're all fact,
But I hear way too much info,
On half the shit that ain't even close,
Whispers
Flyin' around cause everybody's tryin' to boast.

Rumors and drama
Are all that gets told
While we just grow
Ten fold. Ten fold.
We grow ten fold.
Ten fold. Ten fold!

Oh, but you'll come to me now,
Like I ain't hearin' all your squakin'
It's your friends been tellin' me
All that shit you keep talkin'.
You won't get nadda from me,
Not a crumb,
Not a dime,
Not a ticket,
Not a pass
It's the end of your free ride...
You thought The Burning Red sucked?
Fuck you, and your bitch!
I spilled my goddamn guts,
This shit's as real as it's gonna get.
Cutting you out of my life,
So go on sing me a choir,
I wouldn't piss in your ass if your shit was on fire!

Rumors and drama
Are all that gets told
While we just grow
Ten fold. Ten fold.
We grow ten fold.
Ten fold. Ten fold!

Always the whispers are flyin' around,
And keep pouring from that hole,
That you call a mouth.
But we follow our instincts,
Don't care what gets thrown.
Ignoring the rumors,
While our powers grow...

Ten fold, Ten fold, We grow ten fold, Ten fold
We grow ten fold, Ten fold, We grow ten fold, Ten fold! Grow tenfold.

Ten fold, Ten fold, We grow ten fold, Ten fold
We're Ten Fold!
