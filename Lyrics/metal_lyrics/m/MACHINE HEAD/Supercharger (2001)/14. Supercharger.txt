Electricity is pulsing
through our veins a charge
is racing
A chain reaction through
the four of us,
to you, will make
the transformers begin
converting into overdrive

Power surge now
exploding through
Energy, filling the ominous
void within you
No need to live your life in
that gap
Got what you need right
here on lightning tap, so

Charge me, charge you
charge us, charge through
Amplify, terrify
supercharger electrifies

Getting under skin, we're
like a rash
Spreading over your body
we are the itch you
scratch
That doesn't seem to go
away
Protons, neutrons, electrons
synchronizing into one

In sheer power all will
pale
heaviness off the Richter
scale
Forever crushing the
competition in their tracks
100,000 Volts we blast, so

Charge me, charge you
charge us, charge through
Amplify, terrify
supercharger electrifies

Your - little sticks of
dynamite
We're - the fuse and
we're the light

Electricity is pulsing
through our veins a
charge is racing
A chain reaction from the
four of us,
to you, has made
it crystal clear we'll win
this war
Destiny...Victory

Braveheart - mindset, full
attack
Kamikaze, never look back
in this war, a victory is if
you feel this too
You feed off us, and we
feed off you, so

Charge me, charge you
charge us, charge through
Amplify, terrify
supercharger electrifies

Charge me, charge you
charge us, charge through
Supercharger
Supercharger
Supercharger
Supercharger.
