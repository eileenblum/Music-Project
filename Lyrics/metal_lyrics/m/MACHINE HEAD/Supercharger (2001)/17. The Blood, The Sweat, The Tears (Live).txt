[digipak version track]

Yes I've walked the path that's righteous
Many men have walked before
Yeah this pain cell, the broken shell
Scraped, shackled onto the floor
So welcome to the world that I lived in
Puking out violence hate
My world entered a false recluse
Sickening from disease
But then I see
This thing in me
Make me want it more than you
But I deny your flesh
Cause pain's my wish
Racing on self destruct

So hold on to the end...

It's all about the blood, the sweat, the tears
A tribute to the strength built through the years

Oh yes I've walked the path that
Gives me confidence strong and pure
Now I realized that freedom rises
From confronting the source
I built these walls around me
And I can't break them all away
And I focus on the strength I call
Insufferable and insane

So hold on to the end...

It's all about the blood, the sweat, the tears
A tribute to the strength built through the years
A tribute to soul...

Take this
Focus
Madness
To take...

...hold... on... on... on...

Hold on.. falling.. please let go..
Hold on.. I'm falling... I'm falling down again...

It's all about the blood, the sweat, the tears
A tribute to the strength built through the years

A tribute cos time will set 'em off
Cos time will set 'em off
