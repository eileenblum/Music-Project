[originally by Ignite]We built this all from miles away we sacrificed to see these days
And from our hearts we will have our say we built this all our darkest days

We live in a Kingdom of reigns the dogs of war rule the day
The hypocrites roam in gangs the truth is lost it is wars first casualty
Speak the truth if you have got something to say
To lead the boys off to war is to throw them away
Depleted rounds kill RU two three eight
These troubled times bringing on our darkest days
Is this the death of liberty is this the price that life has come to mean?
All our friends now enemies the misery of bleeding to my country
The mounting costs our freedom's lost the death of liberty

Tell the truth if you have got something to say
No blood for oil killing fields Halliburton money
Wounded troops left to rot no help from the VA
These troubled times bringing on our darkest days
Is this the death of liberty is this the price that life has come to mean?
All our friends now enemies the misery of bleeding to my country
The mounting costs our freedom's lost the death of liberty

Speak the truth or throw it away
