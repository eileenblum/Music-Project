The bleeding read me the future angel-white, sinning away
I have turned from the ever-grey and the devil keeps us enraptured
Hope and mind become the sage an ancient power rage
Ancient power darkest hour

Open your third eye and you will see
Killers and kings
Inheritors of Earth from death there comes rebirth
And as an army we will sing the diamond bears our ring
Killers and kings the diamond bears our ring

Look to Earth, summon the master awake the human living inside
This is religiou side, and the hangman keeps his intemperance
The sun shines over the fool high priest express our rule
Death and rebirth decay and mirth

The king of pentacles is here strength in forty two you will have to push away the fear
We stand atop the mountain with the hermit and the lamb
As the lovers in the night is what has walked into the damp
What do the cards say then tell me this and pain
The devil and the emperor could keep us locked in chains
The chains they left you know too well you are wrong
The chains are here to put you now fenced in now to you terror denied this power wasted nature
