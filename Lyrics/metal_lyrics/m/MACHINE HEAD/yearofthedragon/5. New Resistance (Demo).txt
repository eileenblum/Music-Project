Machine Head comin' to get ya
Got New Resistance...New Resistance...Got New Resistance...NOW...

Got me pissed You bringing' the drama? We're coming' to flex
We're bringing' the static, I ain't talking' X
You don't think I'm crazy? You don't wanna test
Carve my name in your fuckin' chest
I mean it You don't think I done it?
You seen it Ya fuckin' peanut The Undisputed Title Stripper
Absolut Vodka sipper Fuck yeah, pussy licker
M-H's the best, that's the point
Got them rippin' up the lawn, Ozzfest - Detroit
Mr. Big Shot Step a little closer please And drop to your knees
Cause you ain't me You'll never be
We been around and made a sound You try to take
But pound for pound you can't Well good luck Cause we stand true That's how we do
From us to you The big FUCK YOU
I can see why you hate me cause we're the real so deal FUCK YOU
New Resistance...New Resistance...Got New Resistance

Let me spell this out...F-U-C-K, fuck all of you Diss The Burning Red and I'm mauling'
You motherfuckers didn't even know about the level 'til The Big MH came and killed
Who brought the Bay the sound that innovated? who "Fucked It All"? now we fuckin' made it
WE'RE the ones your ass has imitated the Real Juice you are fucking concentrated
Constipatin' all the others who just out of habit can't grab it Silly Rabbit
You just can't fathom how a band could be so RAW now pick up your jaw
Can you hear your ears ringing'? We'll chew you up spit you out and you can't break this
We'll dominate, appreciate I tell you son Just what cause you should
Give it up you try to be to be like us, but that you'll never do
I, been, running around you I been crawling I'm gonna crawl into you
