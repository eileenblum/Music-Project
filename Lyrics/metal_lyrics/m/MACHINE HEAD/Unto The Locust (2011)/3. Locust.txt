[Music by Machine Head, Lyrics by Robb Flynn]

[Verse 1:]
Sweet caress grazes my skin.
It's loveless, these hooks sink in.
Behind an angel's disguise, an insect preys.
Mandibles cut like a knife, the reckoning.

[Pre-Chorus 1:]
Forming clouds, their shadow shrouds.
Louder the tattered wings they sound.
Descending down.

[Chorus 1:]
Down they come, the swarm of locust.
Skies above converge to choke us.
Feast of souls consume the harvest.
Young and old, suffer unto the locust.

[Verse 2:]
Surrender, these veins are bled.
Devoured, nothing sacred.
Strings pull the marionettes.
See how they dance upon the winds that beget our pestilence.

[Pre-Chorus 1]

[Chorus 1]

Bleeding from my eyes, this plague is sent to erase us.
Bleeding from inside, these vermin can't infiltrate us.

Faith appears, and holds a candle.
Hark, the angels sing.

[Lead: Demmel, Flynn, Demmel, Flynn, Flynn / Demmel]

[Pre-Chorus 2:]
Forming clouds, their shadow shrouds.
Louder the tattered wings they sound.

[Chorus 2:]
Tear the veil, the lies derail.
Purity ever will prevail.
Trumpets sound the shattered crown.
Halos of truth now they surround.
The charade comes down.

[Chorus 1 2x]
