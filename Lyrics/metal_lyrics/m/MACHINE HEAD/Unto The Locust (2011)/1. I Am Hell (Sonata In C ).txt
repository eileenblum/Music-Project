I am death
Arms held outstretched
I am hell
Born this mortal shell
I am wrath
Take this bloodbath
God sent me to kill you

What started out as wonder
The smell of scorched earth
It filled me with a sense of bliss
Inside my head the noises how they thundered
With cracking and hiss
One match
Killed the anguish
One act
Left me fulfilled
Destruction now the only catalyst
To save this soul
From these thoughtless kills

Where once a heart was beating
Nothing but embers glow
Our love it serves as kindling
To stoke this flames inferno

I am hell to thee
Down here all shall suffer with me
Die purified
Rise the ashes to the sky

Obsession born of young lust
Incomprehensible the feelings as they came to pass
But now betrayal slowly turns to blood lust
Through sulphur and gas

Ignite this crime of passion
Loves pyre is set ablaze
The charred remains of all
Compassion was the spark that lit
Your immolation

Where once a heart was beating
Nothing but embers glow
Our love it serves as kindling
To stoke this flames inferno

I am hell to thee
Down here all shall suffer with me
Die purified
Rise the ashes to the sky

So burn
I'll burn it down
I'll burn you down
So you'll never love again (again)

[Lead: Flynn / Demmel, Flynn]

Where once a heart was beating
Nothing but embers glow
Our love it serves as kindling
To stoke this flames inferno

I am hell to thee
Down here all shall suffer with me
Die purified
In this the ashes of your immolation

I
Am
Hell
In the ashes of your immolation
