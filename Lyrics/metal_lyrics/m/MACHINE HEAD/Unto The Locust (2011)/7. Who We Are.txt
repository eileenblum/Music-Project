This is who we are
This is what I am
We have nowhere else to go
Divided we will stand

We are the ugly 
Beaten and torn
Brooding with power and ready for more
We are the hungry
Sick of this world
Of robbers of thieving
Of vultures unfurled

We have been left on our own
Be all the lost longing for home
We are the unwanted lives
Strung out and angry the deprived

We are the young
And young at heart
The strong and the brave that are destined to start
We are the change
The world needs to see
Look in our eyes and see our belief 

This is who we are
This is what I am
We have nowhere else to go
Divided we will stand

We are the broken
Meant to be left
Damaged and headless like dolls in a chest
We are the future 
Seeds that you've sown
In dirt that won't ever grow turns now to stone

We have been hung out to dry
We are the drunken
We are the high
We despise this human race
Look in our eyes and sell your disgrace

This is who we are
This is what I am
We have nowhere else to go
Divided we will stand

Dream 

Into glory we will ride
Be unbridled in determination burn the seasons
Into glory we will ride
Be unbridled in determination
Burn the seasons

[Lead: Flynn, Demmel, Flynn/Demmel]

We are the savage
Meant to be brought to justice
To be thrown in jail and left to rot
We are the other American dream
Whose characters fight for their lives
And they scream

We have been left disavowed
Those of the black
Not of the shroud
We won't hear religious lies
Their God has left us to die

This is who we are
This is what I am
We have nowhere else to go
Divided we will stand
This is who we are
This is what I am
We have nowhere else to go
Divided we will stand
