You won't see us come [4x]

You won't see us come
In the night
With these knives
And these bloodstains on our hands
Paint the walls
Taste the blade
On the night of long knives
[2x]

Midnight we kill

In summer of 69, there came a prophet
His words were used to profit off the minds of the weak
He spoke of holes deep within the desert
His followers would convert into the belly of the beast
Don't look into his eyes
Burning with malice past the point of no return
They're piling bodies one by one
Fulfilling all their dreams to come,
The prophecy of war that Charles Manson had begun in the hills

Of Hollywood tonight

City of the angels
Sanity deprived
The family fatal
They bring the night of long knives
Deserts and the devil
Rapist of mind
The family fatal

Pitch black

You won't see us come
In the night
With these knives
And these bloodstains on our hands
Paint the walls
Taste the blade
On the night of long knives
Midnight we kill

The hills were echoing with their laughter
and happily ever after was a faded memory
Rosemary and the baby of Polanski
6 people dead and bloodying
the Hills of Beverly
They're screaming for their lives
Begging and pleading for lives of babies unborn
The knives had only just stuck in
The horror of the splitting skin
Ropes are tied around their necks
To breathe their dying breaths
In the hills
Of Hollywood tonight

City of the angels
Sanity deprived
The family fatal
They bring the night of long knives
Deserts and the devil
Rapist of mind
The family fatal
They bring the night of long knives

We have been so wrong
We will fall
No tomorrow [2x]

We'll fall away tonight

Don't look into his eyes
Burning with malice past the point of no return
They're piling bodies one by one
Fulfilling all their dreams to come
The prophecy of war that Charles Manson had begun in the hills

Of Hollywood tonight

City of the angels
Sanity deprived
The family fatal
They bring the night of long knives [2x]
Deserts and the devil
Rapist of mind
The family fatal
They bring the night of long knives

In the night
With these knives
And these bloodstains on our hands
Paint the walls
Taste the blade
On the night of long knives
You won't see us come
In the night
With these knives
And these bloodstains on our hands

On the night of long knives
