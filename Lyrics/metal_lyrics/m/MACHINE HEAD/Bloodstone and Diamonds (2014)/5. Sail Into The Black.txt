We sail into the black [4x]

And all those secrets, lost in your eyes
And all those regrets, you hold inside
And all those memories, left by design
And all those mysteries, lost in your eyes
We sail into the black [2x]

And all those footsteps, washed in the tides
And all those droplets, blood into wine
And all those heartaches, tears that youâve cried
And all those mistakes, washed in the tides
We sail into the black [2x]

I stare at the stricken
The follies of man
And the horror that lives in your eyes
And once were forgiven
The mind explodes in waves of terror

Burn my eyes
Tear at the skin
The crawling beneath will begin
Side by side
Pounding the heretic drums as we rise or we fall
And all these scars
The nightmare it calls
The fear and betrayal begin
Weâve come so far
The shit we ingest
With a mouthful of spit and protest

We sail into the black [2x]

The black candle fades
Go disappear lost and forever broken
Shattered like glass
The scars and the sex
The lies and the fables we tell
And all we are
This fate is your choice
Regrets that youâll take to the grave
These threads of silk
That held this together
Rotting and curdled as milk

We sail into the black [6x]
