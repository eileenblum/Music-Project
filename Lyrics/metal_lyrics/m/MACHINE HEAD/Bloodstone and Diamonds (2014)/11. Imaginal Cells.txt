Weâre in a critical phase of human civilization that our survival is really in question
There is generally a feeling that something that thereâs something happening
People have been exposed of course to the whole concept of peak oil, to climate change, to population explosion
The doomsday clock keeps moving closer
Religious people are talking about the End Times
Present state of disorganization
What seems to be happening is that people are beginning to realise
How many of these are real crises or how many of these are crises as a result of limitations of our belief system?
Where civilizationâs structures become so rigid and it can no longer adapt to the changing situations
Thereâs a great increase in mental illness
There are signs of when these civilizations come to an end
Thereâs a sense of alienation within the population
A very large increase in violent crime, social disruption
Some of the beliefs that we have bought into affect the entire population so
And surprisingly an interest in religious cultism
As societies start to begin to disintegrate
These weapons of mass distraction which are now falling apart as weâre seeing life being exposed time and time again, every day, every week
What theyâve been distracting us from is our true power, the true nature of human nature
Our power to evolve, our power to become cells in the organism called humanity
And itâs an exciting story of our own power to evolve our own true nature and our own evolutionary destiny
Medicine started out as a healing art to help others but over time and in our materialistic world and a world based on corporations, industries that thrive by making money off of sick people
But the environmentâs changing
We are at this very moment in a stage where corporations are teeter-tottering because they canât maintain themselves anymore
Theyâve grown too big and they have too little awareness to maintain this world
And while theyâre doing their destruction of the planet, a new series
People are coming out of the old just like we talked about
The imaginal cells
But imaginal cells have a different vision of the world
And why this is important for us is because it is a world of relationship
Nobody can get off the bus, weâre all in this together
We see that we are indeed really approaching a change of civilization
It really is a lesson for us
Weâre in the throes of a new evolution, a new civilization is manifesting
Creative minorities arise
The imaginal cells are people that are saying âthereâs another way to do thisâ
Thereâs a better brighter image thatâs much more successful than the one weâre doing
Theyâre precursors of the next level of our evolution
The fractal image will repeat itself, itâs not a coincidence
We know where weâve been, we know weâre going
And all I have to say is just stay out of the way of the dinosaurs as they crash
And allow us to take over this planet and bring in the new ideas that the imaginal cells will offer
To support and encourage our survival as a civilization on this planet
