I am no longer alive
Somewhere along this life I have died inside
My soul has been denied
Rise of the black hearts
We take to the skies
The Ravens of omen
We don't go down without a fight.
Your grave we dig tonight
With fury and might

We're freaks and we're outcasts
Unwanted and dumb
We scavenge the land because we were all given to none
And our blood is one

Black wings spread their ebony quills
Bloody nails the hand that wills
The murder, murder
Wind is at our backs
Murder, murder
Now the crows attack
For once in this life
You'll see through these eyes
Through The Eyes Of The Dead

Skies become scorched with feathers and crests
Laughing like jackals and our teeth are sharpened and wet
Black talons claw your chest
Tear at the flesh
Virtues of evil now thrown to the flood
The crows of apocalypse
Dragging your heart through the mud
And our teeth drip blood

Black wings spread their ebony quills
Bloody nails the hand that wills
The murder, murder
Wind is at our backs
Murder, murder
Now the crows attack
For once in this life
You'll see through these eyes
Through The Eyes Of The Dead

When the day of reckoning comes
And you cry out "Babylon's won"
Eyes so dark, like ink we blacken the sun

So call my name, "Raven"
So fear this name, "Raven"
Hold dear this
You will never fucking break me
I've an army that will strip you to the bone

GO!

We'll feast on your carrion dreams
Blacken your skies
Shrieking the coldest of screams
Our shadows stand agleam

For we are the dead and we'll rise up and say
Nothing will break us
Nothing will stand in our way
We will seize the day
Little man the worm has turned
Power and respect we've earned

Black wings spread their ebony quills
Bloody nails the hand that wills
The murder, murder
Wind is at our backs
Murder, murder
Now the crows attack
For once in this life
You'll see through these eyes
Bloody nails
The murder, murder
Murder, murder
For once in this life
You'll see through these eyes

For these are the eyes
That your god denies
So just one last time, see through these eyes
Through The Eyes Of The Dead
Through The Eyes Of The Dead
Through The Eyes Of The Dead
Through The Eyes Of The Dead
The Eyes Of The Dead
