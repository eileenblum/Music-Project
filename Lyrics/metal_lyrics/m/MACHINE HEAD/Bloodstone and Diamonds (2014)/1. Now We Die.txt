Standing at the edge of the world
Uncertainty calling as the page unfurls Fortune, Heaven or Hell
Shedding my body of this mortal shell

Black steel and iron
A Lion Heart is forged from these bones
Fear not, the discontent you hide
Awake from the slumber and define this time

No fear to pay the price
And with this now we die

Ashes to ashes
The ocean crashes
Louder and louder it cries
Over and over
The sands wash over
Facing, embracing the tides
And with this now we die
And with this now we die
(and with this now we die)

Screaming violence into the void
Is anyone listening or is all destroyed?
Fighting heaven and earth
Saving your children from their pain and hurt

Bloodstone &amp; diamonds
Nothing can break the strength of these stones
Cast off the shackles of the past
Live in the moment nothing ever lasts

Now cross the bridge of sighs
And with this now we die

Ashes to ashes
The ocean crashes
Louder and louder it cries
Over and over
The sands wash over
Facing, embracing the tides
And with this now we die
And with this now we die
(and with this now we die)

Are you ready to die?

Standing at the edge of the world [2x]

The damned are we
Abused and beat,
We're left for dead
We raise our head
For we are strong,
And they are wrong
So scream with me,
"I do believe!"

I need your help,
For I have knelt
Held fist at skies,
And cried out, "Why?"
Your shoulder strength,
It gives me length
We lift ourselves,
Together meld

So take my hand,
And don't look back
And sing with me, "Let new life be,
Old life goodbye",
And now we die
For we are one
Forever young
And with this now we die [4x]

Are you ready?

Standing at the edge of the world [2x]
