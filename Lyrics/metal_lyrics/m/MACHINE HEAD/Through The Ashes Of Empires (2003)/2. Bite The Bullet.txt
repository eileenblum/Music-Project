I understand your every fear
Your every pain your every tear
With every struggle you conquer
Turn heart to steel
And will to iron

You want more?
You'll get it
Determined, ferocious
Grit down and bite the bullet
Dare to unbind
Smash and redefine

The hate you feel is nothing more
Than love you feel to win this war
The battle that rages inside you
With bloodlust
You must unchain your shackles

You want more?
You'll get it
Determined, ferocious
Grit down and bite the bullet
Dare to unbind
Smash and redefine

Lion heart
Never give in
Unsatisfy every weakness

You want more?
You'll get it
Determined, ferocious
Grit down and bite the bullet
Dare to unbind
Smash and redefine
