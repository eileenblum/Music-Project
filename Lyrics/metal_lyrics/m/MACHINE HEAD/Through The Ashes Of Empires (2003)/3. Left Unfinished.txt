Why was I born?
Sometimes I wish I didn't know
Been times when
I wish that I had just never been
Why did you have me?
Or better yet why'd you leave?
So to the parents who could fuck
But then abandoned me

I'll give to this world what you couldn't give
Love the unwanted, every child born discarded
Add to the flock
The rejects you dumped on

I'll never forget
Life you disdain
So to the parents that bore me this pain
With all those things you left unfinished

You never could love me
I'm glad that you never did
My parents that raised me
Had plenty of that to give
And for that
I'll love them forever with all my heart
But to you
Don't let there be no mistake about it
Fuck you, you cocksucker
Fuck you, you whore
I'll live my life the opposite of what you are

Love will be my rock
The rock that I stand on

I'll never forget
Life you disdain
So to the parents that bore me this pain
With all those things you left unfinished

[Solo: Flynn]

Don't try to reach out to me
Don't try to call
The boy that you created
Is dead for all you fucking know
You just pretend you've never heard or seen
The name Lawrence Mathew Cardine
