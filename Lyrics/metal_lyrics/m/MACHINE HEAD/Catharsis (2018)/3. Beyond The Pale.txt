I am skin and bones, broken stones
See the scars that I show
I live outside the bounds, in the unknown
I can't ingratiate, to the hate, 'cause their world suffocates
Carve my own path and form my destiny's shape
This storm won't wait

The rain is falling down upon me

Beyond the pale
I found salvation
Emancipation
Beyond the pale
I found my heroes, the freaks and zeros

I live outside the lines
Got no time for the willfully blind
I'll build a world of mine
Sever the ties
I'll break down every wall
Fight and claw, take their punches, stand tall
My middle finger raised
So fuck 'em all
And let them crawl

The rain is falling down upon me

Beyond the pale
I found salvation
Emancipation
Beyond the pale
I found my heroes, the freaks and zeros

The snakes come slithering out of their holes at night
Dirty water clouds my soul, the needle lies

Weather the storm, my heart is drowning
The rain is falling down upon me

Beyond the pale
I found salvation
Emancipation
Beyond the pale
I found my heroes, the freaks and zeros

Beyond the pale!
