My eyes see through the lies
And I see the wolves among the sheep
I smell the fear inside
And the odor brings me to my knees

I'm at the end of my rope hanging on
These scars are dragging on my soul
And we won't let go
We could live forever if we just let go now

Hope begets hope
Stand strong to the winds of adversity
Hope begets hope
Stand your ground
And no, we won't go
No marching orders, get up off of your knees now
Hope begets hope
Stand your ground

I crawl on to the pyre
And the flames they purify my pain
I'm writhing in desire
All this hatred has been all in vain

Have you ever been the hated one
Face to face with the flaws upon your soul
Let the truth unfold
We could live forever if we just let go now

Hope begets hope
Stand strong to the winds of adversity
Hope begets hope
Stand your ground
And no, we won't go
No marching orders, get up off of your knees now
Hope begets hope
Stand your ground

I will prevail
And I've been running from the long arm of the law
I've got to live for better days
This depression that's inside of me
It eats away at the bones that are supporting me
I have to fight back or get knocked down
Take my hand and never let me drown

So tell me have you ever been the hated one
Face to face with the flaws upon your soul
Let the truth unfold
We could live forever if we just let go now

Hope begets hope
Stand strong to the winds of adversity
Hope begets hope
Stand your ground
And no, we won't go
Fuck their orders, get up off your knees now
Hope begets hope
Stand your ground

Face, the flaws on your soul
Let, the truth unfold
We're gonna live forever
