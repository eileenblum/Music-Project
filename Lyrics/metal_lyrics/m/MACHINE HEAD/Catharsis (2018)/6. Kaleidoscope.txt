We rise
We fall
And then we come together and
Despise this all
So get your middle fingers in the air
And sing
They can't ignore us anymore
It's up to us
So hear me out 'cause I don't give a fuck

I'm stuck
I'm heading off the deep end like a truck
No brakes
I grip the wheel and start to shake
I beat my chest to feel alive
Not part of the hive
Comatose America, the zombies are in charge
Watch out for your brothers man, it really isn't that hard
Have our souls turned cold?
The path I walk is only for the strong and the bold

I walk along a lonely road
It's all I know

This hole in my soul
Songs fill what religion won't
No hope, I can't cope
Music plays in kaleidoscope
And if I'm lost
I don't want to be found
Haunted by sound

Open up the floor and start a pit
This shit
Is building up inside of me
I can't pretend, that I won't fuckin' snap tonight
You'll find me nine feet in the grave
Before I'm a slave
Catatonic ignorance, the cronies run the show
Preying on our differences, divide and conquer the low
While I may be old
The world I see is only for the strong and the bold

I walk along a lonely road
It's all I know

This hole in my soul
Songs fill what religion won't
No hope, I can't cope
Music plays in kaleidoscope
And if I'm lost
I don't want to be found
Haunted by sound

Because we rise
We fall
And then we come together and despise
Them all
So get your middle fingers in the air
And bleed
They can't ignore us anymore 'cause
I don't give a fuck

We rise
We fall
And then we come together and despise
Them all
So get your middle fingers in the air
And bleed
They can't ignore us anymore 'cause
I don't give a fuck

We rise
We fall
And then we come together and despite
This all
So get your middle fingers in the air
And bleed
They can't ignore us anymore 'cause
I don't give a fuck

This hole in my soul
Songs fill what religion won't
No hope, I can't cope
Music plays in kaleidoscope

No hope
I can't cope
Songs in kaleidoscope

And if I'm lost
I don't want to be found
Haunted by sound
