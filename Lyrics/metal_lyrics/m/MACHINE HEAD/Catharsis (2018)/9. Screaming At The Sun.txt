You'll find me screaming at the sun
It singes my eyes
The plan I devise, in this chess game to shatter the crook
And now the queen takes the rook
You think that you can read me like a book
But you mistook the pushback, skull crack, now I take the pawn
The pattern's sliding off and now the bishop's gone
Woe this land
It bares my hand
Of the final command

They see you blinded us, reminded us of all that's ugly
And if you let it in, the predator will leave you bloody

So take a look into my eyes
And sharpen your gaze
Sharpen the blades 'cause the stakes have been raised
Kiss the ring
And now the knight takes the king
Now the rank and file is to bring
The sacrificing, upside, downside, give me all your guns
I'm fucking crazy, oh my mind is lost or won?
Hold your breath
These wounds are fresh
Of this mate that I check

They see you blinded us, reminded us of all that's ugly
And if you let it in, the predator will leave you bloody

So we close
Off the din outside the window
No we won't
Normalize the tyrannizing
You'll find me screaming at the sun
Until my soul dies

You'll find me screaming now
They see you blinded us, reminded us of all that's ugly
