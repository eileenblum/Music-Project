I'm at the end of my rope
And I'm starting to choke
The noose is tightening around my throat
It's strangling the hope
That's hiding in my soul
I argue with myself 'cause I can't take control
So drag me through the trough
With my Vietnam cough
And take this straitjacket off

I'm powerless and down
And cracking from the stress
Constricting like a python as it tightens 'round my chest
I gotta fucking death wish
Fighting all my enemies
Wrecking all their fucking dreams
My hands they bleed from the nails
Fingers make a fist
Don't tell me I'm a fatalist
Dancing 'round so frantically
Laughing so maniacally
I can't escape insanity

Trapped in my pain
Fight to keep myself sane

Silent I scream
Tortured by these dark dreams

So get the fuck away from me and hide knives
'Cause I can't trust myself tonight
I'll straight up lie and say
Anything to make it alright
You said you'd love me till the end
Now you want to end?
It's not the end till I say so!
Take your little razor blades
Cut me up and shed the pain
Let them stitch my heart up, black it out
Hand print on the wall
Blood holds me in thrall
Castrated by the butcher's blade that severs all

Trapped in my pain
Fight to keep myself sane

Silent I scream
Tortured by these dark dreams

Nails rake the skin in perfect rows
Spine shivers down from head to toe
Feeling sicker every second that passes
I vomit the pain as I puke 'til I gasp
My breathing quickens, heart starts to race
The lines sink deeper into my face
Peel the filth away, a sick bloody habit
Pick through the scabs as I sift through the maggots
Tobacco stains and tar
Fingernails burnt and charred
The smell of piss and rain
The odor haunts my brain

Psychotic
Thoughts from hell arise
Do I wanna let silence die?
Kill myself to survive
Needle in my arm and the damage is done 'cause I'm

Psychotic
Thoughts below arise
Do I wanna let silence die?
Kill myself to survive
Needle in my arm and the damage is done and I'm

Trapped in my pain
Fight to keep myself sane

Silent I scream
Tortured by these dark dreams
