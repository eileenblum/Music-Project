Call me the spider king, I creep along the night
I weave a web so dense, once caught there is no flight
So delicate the strands I weave around my victims taut
The terror suffocates their shattered afterthoughts

I feel their envy, heavy lies the crown

Call me the spider king, men sharpen blades behind
Caught in the light of greed, the prize infects their minds
They fly too close to flames of fame and withered vanity
Like moths they're drawn towards the inhumanity

I feel their envy, heavy lies the crown

And so I send my spies to watch the guilty seethe
Devise a twisted plot and gently pull the strings
I slink along the boulevards, listen to the streets
The avenues and gutters give me truth to speak

I feel their envy, heavy lies the crown

Call me the spider king, these fiends show no respect
Their blinded loyalties, the balance that I check

I hear them sharpen knives behind my back
A moment frozen, let them open fire

See the hatred that burns through my eyes
And remember the pain Iâll inflict on you
Before the dawn
Suffer my vengeance

Suffer my vengeance

So many cannons have been aimed at me
They raise the guillotine at full speed
The bayonets of men they clash and ring
The battleâs ashen sting, it recedes
The bodies burning in a blaze of heat,
The screams of agony and lost pride
These men go off to die, for war and countryside

The revving engine of the war machine,
Draining it as it feeds on the weak
They try to resurrect the violent seed
Into a hangmanâs tree of deceit
The choice made out on the battleground
Through history resound
The weight would crush you down
'Cause heavy lies the crown
Heavy lies the crown

I smell the fear these men disguise as their love
The hints of their betrayal, it fires my blood
So many knives have missed my back to put me down
The weight would crush you down,
'Cause heavy lies the crown

Donât put me on a pedestal
I lay there for you all to see
I never wanted any war
Save me from the hate below

Envy seeps from every pore
Jealousy is your just reward
This is a warning to you all
Donât ever try to plot my fall
Iâll put you six feet in the ground
Heavy lies the crown
