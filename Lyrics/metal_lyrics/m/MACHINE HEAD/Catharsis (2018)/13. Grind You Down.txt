The ashes chaff between my fingernails
The cigarettes have stained my skin
My lungs are sore from breathing in these chemicals
I thrive inside this life of sin
My bones are rotten to the marrow inside
My veins are coursing only ice
A heart of steel beats inside my chest
Temptation is my only vice

Grind you down and grind you down
Grind you down and grind you down
(Gonna grind you down)
Grind your body down

I can remember the last time December
The snow that comes falling it washes away
I'll live forever the wings of a feather
Will carry me on to the next victory

The smell of death fills up my nostrils like wine
My eyes have slowly turned to stone
My jackals terrorize the enemy lines
Chewing on their muscle and bone
Exact a pound of flesh to bring some justice
My other generals start to cheer
'Cause victory has shined a light upon us
Death is in the rear view mirror

Grind you down and grind you down and
Grind you down and grind you down
(Gonna grind you down)
Grind your body down

I can remember the last time December
The snow that comes falling it washes away
I'll live forever the wings of a feather
Will carry us off to the next victory

The burning feeling in my stomach starts to ache
The sweat begins to bead uncertainties awake
My body's holding and it's folding to the floor
Fight back alpha evermore

'Cause something's wrong
'Cause for alarm
Authorities are here to harm

Carve your path
Not one step fucking back
Stand your ground
Don't let them grind you down
Say "no more".
Ring out our righteous roar
Stand your ground
Don't let them grind you down

Grind you down and

Grind you down and grind you down
(Gonna grind you down)
Grind your body down

I can remember the last time December
The snow that comes falling it washes away
I'll live forever the wings of a feather
Will carry me unto the next victory

'Cause something's wrong
It's now cause for our alarm

Carve your path
Not one step fucking back
Stand your ground
Don't let them grind you down
