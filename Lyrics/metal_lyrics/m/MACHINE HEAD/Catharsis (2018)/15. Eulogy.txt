The strands of memories spread like webs of cold
Along my skin I feel the frost taking its hold
Burning up, my insides start to freeze
Cannibalistic past, thoughts rife with disease
Come and set me free

Stand my ground
Won't let the bastards grind me down
I'm bold, I'm strange
Won't let their fears make me afraid
There's hope, we'll change

Spiders crawl across my scars at night
Picking at the scabs of regrets in my life
The darkness whispers madness as she calls my name
Murky faded like a fog of acid rain
Wash away the pain

I'll stand my ground
Won't let the bastards grind me down
I'm bold, I'm strange
Won't let their fears make me afraid
There's hope, we'll change

The pain goes on and on
Under a crushing weight
Sweating and paralyzed
Upon the bed of my own hate
The night is never ending
As I struggle for control
Where will I find the peace of sleep inside this hole?

I'll stand my ground
Won't let the bastards grind me down
I'm bold, I'm strange
Won't let their fears make me afraid
There's hope, we'll change
We'll change
