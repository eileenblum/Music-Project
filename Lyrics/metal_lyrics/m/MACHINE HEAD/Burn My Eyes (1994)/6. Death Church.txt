Well I look at justice in a different light
I been to jail, it didn't make me right
Try and conform, but won't be deaf, blind, dumb
Been beaten down, just harder I've become

[Chorus:]
Death church rising
Hate church rising
Lost church rising
Death church rising

Hey Jesus can't you help me with my pain
Mainline me some religion, keep me sane
Christ suffering upon my TV screen
Send in your money to the faith obscene

[Chorus]

Strength, truth and honor, words I strive to live
Your faith's profane, it takes, never gives
'Cause I'm gonna die standing upon my feet
You're gonna die groveling on your knees

[Chorus]
