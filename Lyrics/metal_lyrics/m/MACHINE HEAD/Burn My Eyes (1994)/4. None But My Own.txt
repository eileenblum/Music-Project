I am only nothing, I am only this
I am just a man with these two fists
You have asked forgiveness
You have asked respect
Only something that you did forget

All you gave you had planned to take
Beat upon me but I won't break
Stripping everything from me? No!

Will to me your anger, will to me your rage
Will to me your lies, your sufferings
Not a man of virtue, not even a man
Will not take the hate dealt from your hands

Years of pain I will take and hone
Manifest with your broken bones
My heart bleeds for none but my own
My own

Burn
Burn

I am only nothing, I am only this
I am just a man with these two fists
Not a man of virtue, not even a man
Will not take the hate dealt from your hands

Years of pain I will take and hone
Manifest with your broken bones
My heart bleeds for none but my own
My own

Burn
Burn

My heart bleeds for none but my own...
