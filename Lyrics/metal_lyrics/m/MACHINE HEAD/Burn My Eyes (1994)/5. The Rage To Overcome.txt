This world does not want me
This world does not care
And I am a product of this world
Confused, I'd say that's fair
This pain will never leave me
It's scared upon my brain
Destroying everything that brought this
Just to keep me, just to keep me sane

A hatred burns inside me
Emotion out of hand
But I've the will to focus this
Survive, contrive, command
From pain come a courage
The strength from injustice
The rage to overcome it all
An open mind
With a closed fist
