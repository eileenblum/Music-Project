Hear me now
And as my voice fills your ears
Begin to breathe slowly
Let your heart become consumed in this moment
Where everyone has lost their purpose
And everyone is finding their way
Close your eyes and focus carefully
Let my words guide you home

Separation got us nowhere
And we are going nowhere fast
And my heart it beats for you my love
Won't you wait, won't you wait for me

I swore I'd change but this is hate,
This is rage

Vengeance will be mine, I will repay
I breathe for something greater
We found our peace in the silence all around us

Separation, separation
We are going nowhere fast, We are going nowhere fast

Separation got us nowhere
And we are going nowhere fast
And my heart it beats for you my love
Won't you wait, won't you wait for me

I don't breathe for myself
I breathe for something greater than us all.
