I built these dreams
I won't watch them fall to failure
Just as I am, I come to you this time
I won't fade away,
And with a heavy heart I walk this path I've chosen alone
I'm slowly finding my ability to speak

This is my connection,
A way to speak when no one is listening
We run when we sense failure, but only to save ourselves

How long will we bend before we break

I built these dreams
I won't watch them fall to failure
Just as I am, I come to you this time
I won't fade away,
And with a heavy heart I walk this path I've chosen alone
So speak

This is my destiny, you could never take this

And as we go our separate ways,
I'm left standing still with no one left to blame
No one left to blame,
And I know now, we will never change
And I know now, we will never change

How long will we bend before we break
