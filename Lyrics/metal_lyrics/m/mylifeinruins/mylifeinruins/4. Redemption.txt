Alive in a day,
Where the world turns its back on everyone
And I'm left to stand here face to face
Face to face with my consequences,
As a penitent man,
I pray I soon wake from this nightmare we call living
I've watched my empire fall to nothing, burn to ashes
Maybe one day, one day
I'll find a kingdom worthy of my cause, my cause

Here I am
Take everything, take all of me I'm yours
I'm just a broken man, whose lost all direction
Lost all direction
And its hard to know your face, when your always running away
Your always running away
And I've become a mess of a man,
Slowly learning how to love, learning how to love
Well maybe one day I'll be whole again
(And there's a ransom on my head, slowly I fell its grip tightening,
Release)

Standing before the crossroads,
With anticipation at the thought of the choice
That I'm doomed and destined to make
Between love and hate, raging inside
To each side they beckon on,
Fighting for the footholds in my mind
Is this the man that I've become, become

And I've become a mess of a man,
Slowly learning how to love, learning how to love
Well maybe one day I'll be whole again

Relief, I know its there if I just surrender
