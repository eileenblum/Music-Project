The aggressive discipline restructures all Humanity
The perfect infiltration using powers of barbarity
For many years you were wrong
You believed in promises for so long
Burning so beautiful and strong
Now seem so empty and wrong
I am anticipation | stimulation | desperation
I serve revolution | convulsion | depression
I cause attraction | regression | retribution
I kill conviction | temptation | the creation
Your world was build upon enigmas
From which you cannot assign
You only based you life in demons
Now they are gone and you die
I send my brothers to teach the brother men
I teach my brothers to kill the brother men
Now &amp; forever - Forever &amp; now
Your world was build upon enigmas
From which you cannot assign
You only based your life in demons
Now they are gone and you die
I am anticipation | stimulation | desperation
I serve revolution | convulsion | depression
I cause attraction | regression | retribution
I kill conviction | temptation | the creation
Keep on turning...
Keep on bleeding...
The shinning onslaught of tyranny...
The lying leaders virtuosity...
I am:I am:I am the living flame
I keep my secrets always the same
I put Jesus in his place
The shinning onslaught is my name
"Spinning in this useless hole in time, abandoned in bleeding faith and afflictive penitence, the speech of the savior always sounds the same. We must renew existence taking the shinning onslaught as our new name."
