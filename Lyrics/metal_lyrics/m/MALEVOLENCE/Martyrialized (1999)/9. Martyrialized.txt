The monotony of a forgotten past
The pleasure of not feeling in my dreams
Pain is vanishing and love stays asleep
The wisdom of another tragedy
I have the ability of letting you martyrized
With my new desire of suffering
Your eyes can't tell me can't tell me anything
Your soul cannot touch...
Can't touch mine
Can't touch mine
Can't touch mine
Can't touch mine
I feel good loving I feel you this way
I feel thy strength - Inside - Inside of me
I feel the passion I feel the fever
Now and forever in my pores
Inside of me I will forever be
I listen a new World screaming for me
A new World suffering and following me
"Sometimes, when an entity was previously marked &amp; restricted by the laws of injustice, stealth customs and other several punishments of a society, extremely dangerous &amp; often cruel for their own kind fellow creatures, the same entity, renounces to follow the same codes
and models settled by the entire segregating community in general"
