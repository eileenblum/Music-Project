Hundred years in affliction
Following pale illusions
Watching the false preachers
Spreading spiritual justice
Welcome to this enslavery
The enslavery of Chist
Welcome to this deception
The deception of life
Adorning empty words
Praying improper lies
Parasites of incense
Authority upheaval
Welcome to this enslavery
The enslavery of Christ
Welcome to this deception
The deception of life
Monarchs deforming our ancient truth
Beauty horrified years are passing by
Roaming in the distance rootless and faithless
Sadly addicted in perpetual sparks
Bleeding defenders dragging the shadows
Servants are looking for a place to rest
Something that is denied for those are walking
Tormented inside in perpetual march
Cry when I'll say cry
Bleed when I'll say bleed
Crawl when I'll say crawl
Die when I'll say die
Shores of Christ in my eyes
Shores of Christ in my eyes
Die - Christ - Die
Degeneration
Domain of lies
Full holy madness
Are build inside
"A generation reviving from thy ashes of materialized religion, renouncing the adulterated paradise of intoxicating Christianity."
