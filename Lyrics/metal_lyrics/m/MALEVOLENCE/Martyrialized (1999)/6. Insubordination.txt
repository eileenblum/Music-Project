No need to be human when identity is lost
Just another number spiral progress the cost
Insubordination Divine
Final Confrontation of Time
The laws of this time daughters of deception
Labyrinth of the weak a movie on slow motion
Insubordination Divine
Final Confrontation of Time
I never found the answer for this mystery
The visual mist surrounds me
The mist of infinity
"In the long run there will be an edge crushing transformation on every human, giving birth to a new form of thoughtful mind and strong inner individualization."
