It was a time of courage
It was a time of Fearlessness
A time of brave and heroic acts
It was a time of conquering
It was a time of discovery
A time of brave and heroic:
A time of brave and heroic...
Stormy templars killing the serpent with pride
Lusitanian knights of the order, of the order of Christ
Chronicles of a splendorous nation burning at last
Chronicles of a splendorous Lusitania coming from the past
Stormy templars killing the serpent with pride
Lusitanian knights of the order, of the order of Christ
Chronicles of a splendorous nation burning at last
Chronicles of splendorous Lusitania coming from the past
From the past:
Now on the battlefield their blood melts into my skin
The skinless are running cold until their final end
To rule the dominion of insolence
To gain the unchallenged domain
To defend our kingdom Lusitania
The gods of war will forever prevail
Mother of thy earth
Mother of thy sea
Mother of thy fire
Mother of thy eyes of Humanity
Povo Lusitano
Povo Lusitano
Ergue a tua espada
Defende a tua patria
Povo Lusitano
Ergue a tua espada
Defende a tua patria
Ergue a tua espada
Defende a tua patria
Mata o povo infiel
Mata o povo infiel
Mata o povo infiel
Mata o povo infiel.
"Purely the execrable trifle shall stay voted to eternal scorn, as the great day of battle is coming, we shall conquer &amp; discover."
