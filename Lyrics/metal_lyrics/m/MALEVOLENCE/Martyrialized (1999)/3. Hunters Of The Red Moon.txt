Somewhere in the serene night
Of a bold eighteen century
The clerical plot just starts to brutally molest an innocent
An holy life of perversion An holy life of renunciation
An holy life of emptiness An holy life of celebration
Sounds of the deadly feast echo on the silent twilight
Awakening the attention of an honest man passing by
Awake...
For crimes never committed I shall die innocently
I can no longer live but my spirit lives endlessly
Betrayed by those in which he once have trusted
Awaits the final sentence with false arguments condemning him
Awake...
For crimes never committed I shall die innocently
I can no longer live but my spirit lives endlessly
Ordinary law - Imputing the murderer
Rule into all man - The hunters are the liars
"The despotism of the priests, the lowness, the short views, the insipidity of the dogmas and all the mysterious data previously materialized on this vile existence."
