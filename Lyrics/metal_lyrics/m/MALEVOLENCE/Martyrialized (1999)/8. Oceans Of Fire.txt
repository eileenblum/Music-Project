In the loneliness of the night
When all is calm and the angels sleep I reflect...
I reflect in the sins of my life
Watching the years of poisoning seed I reflect...
Oceans of fire burning my sins
Oceans of fire burning with me
Throughout times of creation and despair
My soul keeps wandering in a dream I reflect...
Searching for a place in the sky
The place where only the ancients lie I reflect...
Oceans of fire burning my sins
Oceans of fire burning with me
I know death is coming soon and keeps smiling
In the burning shadows of the eternal silence
Where mortals have no pride or the art of dying
So let me die and pray for the eternal fire
Burning my sins
Burning my past
Burning me at last
Fire
Thy Oceans
Thy Oceans on fire
"An inevitable collision course with the persevering performances of all the researchers of progressive &amp; supreme apocalyptic art"
