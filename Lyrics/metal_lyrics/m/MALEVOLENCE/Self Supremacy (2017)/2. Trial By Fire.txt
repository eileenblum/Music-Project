Victimised that you've chosen to be
So afraid that you tip toe around me
Deceit, it's so easy to read
Another day another finger still pointing at me
You think I feel sorry for you?
Another victim in your bullshit stories
Talk and you talk but you'll never be heard
Dig deeper and bury yourself in your words

This is trial by fire
Final judgement for a liar
This is trial by fire

Walls, walls closing in
You play the victim but I don't give a shit
I drew a line and you just fucking crossed it
Walls closing in
You play the victim but it makes me sick
I drew a line and you just crossed it

So fuck crying for help when you won't even help yourself
Too quick to put the blame on someone else

This is trial by fire
Final judgement for a liar
This is trial by fire

So much talk but nothing getting said
'Cause these problems only exist in your head

This is trial by fire
Final judgement for a liar
This is trial by fire

Trial by fire
