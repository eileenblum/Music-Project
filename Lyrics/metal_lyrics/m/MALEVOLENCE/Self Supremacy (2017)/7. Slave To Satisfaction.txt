I have succumb to the poison around me
I am driven to ignore the despair
Keep searching for a lesson
A choice I never question
Pushed into a state of disrepair
The scars will never fade
Till Iâm in my grave
Iâm reaching out to you
But Iâm clutching at smoke
Getting deeper in this hole
The fight inside was never fair

Now nothing can destroy me
This is the ecstasy that I feel
When itâs my turn Iâm starting to forget
Instant doubt, creeping regret
What can I do to make this go away
I feel the misery eating at me every day
Iâm fading in, bleeding out, dragging myself down
How many times can I make this mistake
I can feel myself slipping away
Tired eyes, early graves

From the top of the world
To the bottom of the barrel
Eating me away from the inside
A test of my sanity
I know in the end what will be, will be
I know in the end what will be, will be
A test of a my sanity

What doesnât destroy you
Will make you wish that it did

Inflicted, Inflicted on myself
Inflicted, Inflicted on myself

From the top of the world
To the bottom of the barrel
Eating me away from the inside
A test of my sanity
I know in the end what will be, will be
I know in the end what will be, will be
A test of a my sanity

Searching for the fix
Another stone in the wall of life
So when the cracks appear
Will you be there when it all comes crashing down

Still alone
Still searching for my soul
No one to blame but my self control
Still alone
Still searching for my soul
No one to blame but my self control

Another slave to satisfaction
Was it all really fucking worth it?
