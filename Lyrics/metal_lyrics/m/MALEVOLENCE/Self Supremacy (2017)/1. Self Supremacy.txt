The life you lead is reflected in your choices
No hope, no victory
No victory without a reward
Failure is an attitude that haunts the mind of a man
Stay strong, stay focused
Never give up, always give it all you can

In a world so clear and defined
I must have the strength to stand and fight
Fight for myself and not for anyone else
Self supremacy
Self supremacy
Fight for myself and not for anyone else

You get caught when you're out of luck
How many times have you given up?

Self supremacy
In myself I must believe
Never falter in the presence of my enemies
Self supremacy
Never fall as a victim of defeat

And that's the way it fucking happens to be, motherfucker
And that's the way it fucking happens to be
It's so easy to see, just take a step back and breathe
Get the fuck up when you're down on your knees
Self supremacy

Self supremacy
In myself I must believe
Never falter in the presence of my enemies
