You're fighting a war
What side are you really fighting for
Disposable lives used as their pawns
But in this game there's no coming back
As the slaughter begins in the name of an attack

Betrayal
I won't sit back and listen
Betrayal
I refuse to be a product of your system
Betrayal
I won't be a victim
I refuse to buy your fantasy and fiction

Bullets from a tyrant
Can you hear them firing?
Another body dropped in the name of corporate violence
Global tension rising
Can you hear the sirens?
One step from pulling the trigger
Another minute's silence

Chewed up and spat out, you sink to the bottom
Another body not lost but forgotten

Could you really do it put to the test?
Do you wanna live with that on your chest?
It's time to make up your mind
Cause your moves next
Your moves next

Betrayal
I won't sit back and listen
Betrayal
I refuse to be a product of your system
Betrayal
I won't be a victim

I refused to buy your fantasy and fiction
Your time is up
Back to the frontline
Soldiers of misfortune
The iron curtain falls
Your time is up
Back to the frontline
The iron curtain falls

Mind control of the population
Built on lies and false information
