[feat. Kevin from The Merciless Concept]Decade of wasted days
Don't need you telling me, and I will not beg for sympathy
Something you'll never know
Step back, take a look at your life, what do you really have to show
Fast paced
You'll be pushed aside, lie upon lie, time after fucking time
One small step forward
But you were left behind
We're tearing it down with you still trapped inside

[Kevin - The Merciless Concept:]
Diseased with the sickness of greed
10 long years of relentless repeat

You're the plague in societies chest
Another waste of space, another wasted breath

Another wasted breath

Behind the silence you're caught in the fire
Another victim of your own desire
Now all your bridges have burnt
Seek your comfort in the flames

I feel no sympathy now for your misery
The way you talk has your mind enslaved
You're pathetic, so generic
Backstabber to the place that built you
Mindless addiction to self satisfaction
Perverted senses of a false attraction
Exposed to the masses
Running low on your chances

I cease to heed the glamour that blinds you
Will not be led astray by those that you look to
It's clear with time you have wasted your whole life
The judgement is cast, let the guilty descend
It's clear with time you have wasted your whole life
Let the guilty descend

Forever lost in the daydream of normality
Decade of wasted days
Don't need you telling me, and I will not beg for sympathy
Something you'll never know
Step back, take a look at your life, what do you really have to show
Fast paced
You'll be pushed aside, lie upon lie, time after fucking time
One small step forward
But you were left behind

[Kevin - The Merciless Concept:]
Stupid motherfucker, let me tell you what I see
A hollow fucking man staring right back out at me
Spouting all your shit, I can't stand to hear the sound
Cut your fucking throat, watch you bleed out on the ground.
