Create a new world
A new atmosphere
Water turns to fire
Invincible becomes my soul

Jesus Christ lord of lies
Where am I try to find
Why we have to die!
Why we have to die!

Hope finally died
Alone I lie
Spreading the disease
Of those left alive

Come Satan spread your wings
Walk among all my dreams
Cut my flesh for all I bleed
To react to all my fantasies

Dominion of fate
Dominated by hate
Dominion of fate
Dominated by hate

The cancer of your own god
False image leading to nowhere
A nightmare so fucking real
A new step into the dark

Jesus Christ lord of lies
Where am I try to find
Why we have to die!
Why we have to die!
