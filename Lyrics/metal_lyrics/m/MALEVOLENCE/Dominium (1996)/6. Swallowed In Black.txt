Black shadows beneath thy mask
Reasons that crumble but never last
Striking fear the depths of hell
Reasons only a mortal can tell

Written destiny a message so unclear
Swallowed in black by your own fear

Souls are swallowed in thy black
With no choice to turning back
Ancient dream forgotten and lost
Captured and taken to pay the cost

Written destiny a message so unclear
Swallowed in black by your own fear

People oppressed by the masses
Killing each other for more money
Enter in a ring of fire
Striking for a stupid desire

Swallowed in black
Swallowed in black

Souls are swallowed in black
With no chance to turning back
You call this democracy
I call it a misery
