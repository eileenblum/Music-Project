Erotica

The face that hides all the tears
The machine destroys all the fears

The face that hides all the tears
The machine destroys all the fears

Erotica the machine that seduces our feelings
Erotica is our dream through all these years
Erotica is the shadow that walks among with us
Our dark sweet faith
