Blood of your own veins
Blow into my mind
Whisper words of grieve
None you will deceive

Nowhere to run
Pain has begun
Rising from me
Your destiny

Gonna take you to the world - the death of life
Just remember in the case - you will die
Gonna rape your mother - your mother light
Holy war in the state - the state of life

YouÂ´re afraid to open - to open your eyes
Frightened with the anguished - the anguished cries
In this place you have - no control
And gladly I feed - myself with your soul

No truth in your life
No life beyond time
Your time I command
I want it to end

Face deformed by horror with my hands

Bleed for me
Nothing youÂ´ll see
Bleed for me
Nothing youÂ´ll see

Why tell me why you have to take our blood and our life
And the only answer you can give me is that you love me
I canÂ´t resist to embrace you in my arms
Lost in decay you will feel your final days

Rise from my soul
Need no control
Just feel the pain
I love the dead

Why tell me why you have to take our blood and our life
And the only answer you can give me is that you love me
I canÂ´t resist to embrace you in my arms
Lost in decay you will feel your final days

Gonna take you to the world - the death of life
Just remember in the case - you will die
Gonna rape your mother - your mother light
Holy war in the state - the state of life
