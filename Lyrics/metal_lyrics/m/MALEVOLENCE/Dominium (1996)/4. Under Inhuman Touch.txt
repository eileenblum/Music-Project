Rise!

Human touch something I feel
In my life of chaos beyond this word
Black tears in my eyes crying the victory
Among the thrones of hell

Through the burning snow
I watch the storm approaching
Forbidden blood and love to blow

Like a hot desire
A burning seed starts to grow
In her name a secret world

The dust I leave behind
Flashing through my memory
Come and share my sweet tragedy

Deep in a sad dream verses intone my soul
Awakening the eternal, eternal goddess of life
SheÂ´s more ancient than man walls vibrate down her feet
And to her I knell the love human touch

In this place we dwell you are the one I trust to escape from here we must
Under the hate I feel I know a place so sweet where the lost souls meet in my dream
In this world so unreal something hurt so much I need your human touch in my life
In this place we dwell you are the one I trust to escape from here we must!

We must! 

I see always something
Reflected in the mirror
Isnât that a shadow
The shadow of my life
Within the pale dominion
Crossing the revealed religion
Sub plantation of violent blood
Inhuman touch of love 

Inhuman touchâ¦
Inhuman touchâ¦
