The journey starting up with a strong curiosity
For those who taste a new form of living fantasy
Some get locked some get weak some taste the impurity
Thereâs no hope of a cure into our eternity

Burn!
Burn!â¦

I see those who abuse the law of the divine
They make their profits from the decadent minds

Human illusion illogical fusion

Do you think you can use me and take me on you wings
I know how to across lies and face the real life

Human illusion illogical fusion

Stage of no turning back
Words that paint our world so black
Crushing life terminating sun
Surrender to the art of âChristâ

Christianity that leads to despair
Infecting all that moves and breaths
False prophets amassing the hope
Strike for a free way of speech

Burn!
Burn!

Burn!
Burn!
