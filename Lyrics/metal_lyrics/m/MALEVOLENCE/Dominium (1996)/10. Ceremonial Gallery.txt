Rise...
Satan riseâ¦
In my life...
I want to die...

Die!

Useless creatures
Beneath in the sky
Ignoring life
Never wondering why?

Love to die
To follow our faith
Our life is based
In the beauty they create

But they cannot create such beauty
Suffering in their rotten misery
They simply go to make their duty
Killing all in the gallery

Speaking always the same words
Making always the same things
Are they alive human beings
Or just machines without strings

Ceremonial Gallery
Joined with my destiny
Ceremonial Gallery
On this wicked melody

Useless creatures
Beneath in the sky
Ignoring life
Never wondering why?
