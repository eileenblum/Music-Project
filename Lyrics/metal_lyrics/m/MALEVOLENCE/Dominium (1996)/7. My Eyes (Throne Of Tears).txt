My hands in anger
My hands up in the sky
My hands the crime
My hands closing my eyes

My eyes alone in the night
My eyes in a different light
My eyes have to fight
My eyes are burning inside

My god is seeing
My god is watching
My god ignoring
My god closing my eyes

My eyes alone in the night
My eyes in a different light
My eyes have to fight
My eyes are burning inside

Eyes

In the street of the town, people making an incredible sound
The night of fanaticism and intolerance has arrived

Meet those who judge you by the color of your skin
They welcome you with sticks and stones to brake your bones

Maybe the down will bring peace
Maybe the down will bring hope
Maybe the dawn will bring healing
But maybe it wonât

My eyes - The Throne of Tears
I see I see I see - I cry

Where are the dreams of union
Where are the dreams of harmony
Where are the dreams of happiness
Maybe in the manÂ´s mind

My eyes - The Throne of Tears
I see I see I see - I cry

My eyes alone in the night
My eyes in a different light
My eyes have to fight
My eyes are burning inside

Eyes
Cry
