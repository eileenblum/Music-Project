If you think you are brave enough to face my bloody shower
Come and I will introduce you to my fucking power

Love Insanity
Kill Humanity

Just look into these eyes and see if they lie
All these words I speak you cannot deny

Love Insanity
Kill Humanity

I plant the seeds of dissension
I spill blood for your pretensions
I kill just for pleasure
I love this burning sensation

Love Insanity
Kill Humanity

I am a stranger in your land
I am a human you canÂ´t understand
I am the one you cannot form
I reject your lies you call a norm

Love Insanityâ¦
Kill Humanity

I comfort
I destroy
I follow
My own Way

Loving Insanity
Killing Humanity

I comfort
I destroy
I follow
My own wayâ¦
