This is the end of hope and human life,
Of everything you thought you knew.
This is the end of hope and human life,
Of everything you know you're not.

Waiting for a time, a time that never came
I thought lies for truth, bloodshed once again
I feel these demons claw against my skin,
I can't break from this cycle of sin.
No longer bound by the choices I've made,
I will not be enslaved.

ENSLAVED

Can you not see the beast that has grown behind these eyes?
Can you not see the pain that has grown behind these lies?

Black demons encompass me
Serpents eyes always watching me
I'm broken
I've failed
Condemned to misery

The cover of your entrusted one,
No longer shields you from the burning sun
Through the lies I see the fucking truth
Condemned to misery again

Take back what was taken from me,
Mind free from the shackles of hate
Too long without clear sight
I won't be beaten,
I won't give up the fight
Too long I've been blind
I won't give up the fight

Spit in the face of adversity,
Loosing grip of my sanity,
What would you do if the tables were turned?
Spit in the face of fear and weakness
Erase the vices of your mind
Clear thoughts, pure focus
Break these chains
Injustice reigns
