Down with the weak
Once chance to make a stand
The hooded reaper will meet you at your end
Unveiling wounds of whispered lies
I am the proof of living hell.

Are we to know what we are?
You bear the curse of the enemy
My soul grows cold with every waking day.

Cast yourself to the fire below
There's no escaping this hell.
Cast yourself to the fire below
There's no escaping this hell.

NO ESCAPE.

Stare at life
Always hoping to find a safe exit
I'm on the edge of the knife
There's no way out
The weight on my chest pulls me down
But won't take me under.

REIGN OF SUFFERING.
