[feat. Matthi of Nasty]Break down the walls around me
Ignite the fire inside my heart
The clock's run out
Time to pay the price
Mind set on hatred
Fuelling the fire
A whole nation which was built upon your lies.

You're trapped inside the evil mind
Got no remorse for the enemy
Stop playing your games of madness
You're only fooling yourself
YOU'RE NOT FOOLING ME.

YOU'RE ONLY FOOLING YOURSELF
YOU'RE NOT FOOLING ME [2x]

Only fooling yourself.

I will determine my own fate
I won't let your hate consume me
I won't let you get the best of me
I've left your world
Let me be free
What happened is a memory
You can't contain the fire inside me
Suffer the wrath of what you made
A martyr of your hate.

YOU
You took your chances away
I want you to suffer in this misery
HATE
You hate the voices inside
The ones that will lead you to your own demise
FEAR ME
I want the light straight from your eyes
Your life is fading away
(You'll never swallow your pride)
Come take a look inside my mind.

ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD WON'T HIDE YOUR FUCKING SHAME.
YOU NEVER HAD THE CROWN.
BURN WITH ALL THAT YOU FORSAKE.

[Matthi - Nasty]

Your words turned bad to worse
Your false truth made me break loose
My patience not existing anymore
Lighting the fire till you can't burn no more.

You took it too far, you passed over the limit.
Greedy motherfucker
Now you're gonna' get it.

Born from the ashes of pain
The strength I'll find within
To cut you out
To never let you back in
To never let you REIGN AGAIN.
