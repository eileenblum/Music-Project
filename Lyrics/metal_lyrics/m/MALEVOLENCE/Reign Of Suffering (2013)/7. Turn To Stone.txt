The thickest smog withers beside me
The naked flame that warms the face
Draw in the wildfire of the forest deep within
Tread carefully or lose your way.

You gotta' fight to keep the demon in
Far too long taunting my soul
Forever stumble down the endless road
Struggling to regain control.

CONSUME MY SOUL,
TURN MY BODY TO STONE.

The blackened path was paved before me
Two crooked eyes follow me alone
The sound of footsteps drawing ever closer
Pallid ghosts turn my body to stone.

You gotta' fight to keep the demon in
Far too long taunting my soul
Forever stumble down the endless road
Struggling to regain control.

CONSUME MY SOUL,
TURN MY BODY TO STONE.
