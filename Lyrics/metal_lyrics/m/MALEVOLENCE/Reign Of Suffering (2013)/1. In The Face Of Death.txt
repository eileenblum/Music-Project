The freedom of evil
I am torn between the lies of who you want me to be
Dead weight of the world on my back
No god calls out to me
I've gotta' find a way out
I keep hoping for some way out
I keep hoping for some sanity
No truth to the words that you spit
My world falling around me.

Crushed by the reaper's hand
A dying light
Feel the knife leave your skin
Your time to die
Silence moves everything
Now you shall know
The ones you mistrusted will reap what you've sown.

And as the days grow longer and longer
The nights grow colder and colder
Lead a life of misery
Born to die in this endless fucking insanity.

Life is an hour glass
You have less than you think
The devil holds the sand
As he decides your fate
In the dark I stand alone
In the dark I know I am home.

WHEN NO ONE CARES, THE WORLD SEEMS COLDER.
BUT IN THE FACE OF DEATH - I AM STRONGER.
