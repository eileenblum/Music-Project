These feelings held deep inside lead me to a blackened place
These structures fall around my world
These feelings held deep inside lead me to a darkened place
This blood is tainted with impurity

Breathe in hope
For your life is at it's end
You have shown who you are
One last chance to prove who you are
Iâll be the maker of your end

This world feels like hell around me
Youâre the lowest of the low

hatred for you
flows strongly through my palms
there is no afterlife
for those who choose to die
let the dark drag you in break you down into dust
Lucifer awaits with a cold and reigning lust
Welcome to my hell,
No sunlight to see
Smoke engulfs your lungs
Darkened entity.

This means nothing to me
This means nothing to us
You mean nothing to me
Youâre fucking dead to us

This world feels like hell around me
Youâre the lowest of the low.
