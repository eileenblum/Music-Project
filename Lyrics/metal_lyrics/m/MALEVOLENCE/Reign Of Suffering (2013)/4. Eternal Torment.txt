END OF ME.

I won't let this be the end of me
I was so blind to all you see
With my hands around the throat of the world
I want to choke all of humanity.

I won't fall to my knees
Fall a slave to misery
Walk a line you shall fear
I will choose my own path
I will not fall in line
Be a slave to your crime
I won't be broken
I will be free
Sacrifice the human race
To become the destroyer of the world we know
Purge the lies of your treachery
And I'll cleanse the world
With the fucking demon inside of me.

All I want is to rid from my mind
This misery and pain that I feel inside
I remind myself that time is something I cannot find
I am lost with no hope
I CAN'T ESCAPE FROM THIS LIFE.

I won't let this be the end of me
I was so blind to all you see
With my hands around the throat of the world
I want to choke all of humanity.
