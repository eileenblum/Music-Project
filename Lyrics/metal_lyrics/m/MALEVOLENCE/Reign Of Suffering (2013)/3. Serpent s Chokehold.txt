The devil's noose awaits, you'll suffer at his hand
Darkness feeds your fear, you're caught up in your fate
In our own despair, those who live must die
Feel the end is close, chasing dreams gone by

The serpents chokehold awaits for you, no pity for fools
His eyes are watching your every move, end of the rope

Trapped, end of the rope
Life slips through your fingers, no pity for fools
Guilty, feel the noose on your neck
Life slips through your fingers, no chance for hope
Fucking choke.
