Call me when there's a lack of faith
Call me shiver
A con of fate
I drew the line that divides men from child,
Sheep from timber wolves
I hold the dark when light finds space

[Chorus]
What have I done?
I am a prisoner
I extend my hand
And you deny it
What have you done?

Your home of sand and dust
You are letting it go
A life so meaningless,
With nothing to live for
Nothing to live for

Call me when there's a sense of haze
I am a whisper
An eco of fate
I've sold my life to rely on your eyes
Sweet and simple words
You bought me dark when I found grace

[Chorus]
What have I done?
I am a prisoner
I extend my hand
And you deny it
What have you done?

Your home of sand and dust
You are letting it go
A life so meaningless,
With nothing to live for
Nothing to live for

Flaw loves this drawing loss
The minute you draft for redemption
Loving the sleazy life?
One minute to overcome
I hope, what takes away will bring to me

What it takes to be alive?
I am distant from home
Strong forever
I hold you in my arms

[Chorus]
What have I done?
I am a prisoner
I extend my hand
And you deny it
What have you done?

Your home of sand and dust
You are letting it go
A life so meaningless,
With nothing to live for
Nothing to live for
Nothing...
