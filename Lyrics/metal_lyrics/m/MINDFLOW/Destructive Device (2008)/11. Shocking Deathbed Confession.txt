"Yes, I was excited that day...
This is a one way street and I was on the wrong way.
So I kept quiet with my thoughts,
I was not expecting something terrible to happen to me on that day.
So I decided to join this unit, over 6 years of training...
Remember I was in the second building,
the highest one.
It was hot..."

Radio warning:
Check sides and rear.
In row we know which door to crash...

Ready, Set, Go!
(Fire escape is covered!)
No one near, yet I know something was there.
"...and I was God damn right."

Demo breaks? Don't get me wrong,
This is the time bullets won't paint your face.

Raid floats in the air.
Tension in and out.
Down, wait...
Cocking back the gun... on me!

How did they get me?
I had five men, giving full back up!
I felt the steel against my head.
Was I alone? I cannot believe!

Radio off, guns taken, someone lead me out.
Rushed inside a car, driving out of town.
What more now?!
Fierce, fast my, heart speeds.
Not knowing is screaming in silence.

If I had only my tracking device...
They'd be looking for me now.

Car slows down,
Voices over,
Doors open...
Sun,
Damn
Blackened!

Under level, left, a light.
Cold weather, fearful sight...
Do you feel like dying tonight?
Yeah!

Roaming,
Seems to be way off my case:
Red Dawn.
Driving into my crime memories,
Dive in my dark side...

Reward,
Wrong Cause,
Rotates.
We lie, you lie;
"Game goes on..."

Willing to find
who is behind this grand scenario.
Creeping voyage,
Leading me along,
Long night...
Creepy Voyage!

Riot...
Awake?
Who decides?
Tomorrow may be... oh!

(He lies down, restless alone...
A lifetime, his mind have shown, awake)

He is all we're after.
Choppers film the zone.
Wait until sundown;
we'll strike at night...

Lead me through a caveway;
Camouflage is on...
War survivor,
I have crossed the red lines.
Without fuel,
Accidental true.

Way before those lonely days of glory.
Signs...

Memories, my mistakes, so long...
Comes back to me... Sorrow!
Leave me, let go, but it Haunts.
Eternally I'll be my own crime...
Oh... no!

In time to read what's coming on.
A late and hungry fright.
Sooner or later I...
Will roarback at them!
It can't be... no way!
Dead Rise?

"By my side a simple man..."
Carries all the guilt.

Too much to me,
I swear it now.
Too much to me...
Concerning to be found.

Against a wrong surrender...
Ahead a world of lies.

Alert!!!
Daredevil me to end with this life!
This form, so bitter.
Wrong cause is now rotating towing me...
Another railroad!

God... God may disappoint.
Is like divine,
Except I may not survive.

Give all in?
Revolving...
Evolving...
Give all in?
Yeah...

(He goes near a window and listens... carefully.)

Long waiting...
Rolling information down.
Wasting time...
"Wasted."

Now that I found
who is behind this grand scenario...
A day in my life...
Forever bleeds an evil mind.
Creeping voyage,
Yearning the years I was gone.
Creepy voyage!
Aiming heart and soul.
Visions remain in control...

Careless health condition...
Death in someone's body.
And...
Someone who will rely,
Heartfelt, so alone.

Will it heal my wound?
A desperate fade into the light...
Will he live on?
It takes away from him,
The reason to fight!

Hide...
In a world where we are alone,
So alone.
Only way to feel alive...
Taking other lives down.

I wait in the middle of the night
Unknown!
Wish I could fake this second soul...
It is really coming on.
I'm in deed not alone.
It is real!

Will it heal my wound?
Daily dose of a mean soul...

"Among the moral or ethical rules humanity has imposed on itself, not killing may rank as the first.

Yet there are exceptions.
Killing predators to prevent them from eating the sheep before we do seems fine.

The controversial part is when we try to analyze the blurry line that divides bad killing from the good or indifferent one.

I still live to pick the right ones..."

Mayhem,
Red Eye,
Caught I!
