Mankind:
Don't shut your mouth
Don't ignore it
Fight it!

This time:
Don't shut eyes
Don't ignore it
Fight it!

You've got to stop this now
That's all you want

You've got to do it somehow
6 billion demands

You've got to stop this now
Before it's too late

[Chorus]
Don't ever let the wrong get by
We have our own role to play
We're the makers...

Don't ever let the wrong get by
We're the creators...
Are we all ready to know?

Mankind:
Don't shut your mouth
Don't ignore it
Fight it!

A rally on a empty desert
On and on in the middle of an endless debate.

We were not vindicated by the inquest verdict about human treason

You've got to stop this now
That's all we want

You've got to do it somehow
Before it's too late

[Chorus]
Don't ever let the wrong get by
We have our own role to play
We're the makers...

Don't ever let the wrong get by
We're the creators...
Are we all ready to know?

You've got to stop this now
That's all we want

You've got to do it somehow
6 billion demands

You've got to stop this now
Before it's too late

[Chorus]
Don't ever let the wrong get by
We have our own role to play
We're the makers...

Don't ever let the wrong get by
We're the creators...
Are we all ready to know?

We are the only here,
Are we allowed to live?
Realize
Are we all ready to know?
