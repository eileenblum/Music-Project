Go, try to go there
Door to door in a loop
Nobody found in their eye

Hidden scenes
Flooded dreams
Caring less

Please let me rust in a way I know
Wild it will be now soon
Let it rot and let be with no sun

[Chorus]
Coming,
Does it all fit to me?
Is it over?
Growing in this town
Does it hold any mean?
Is it over?
Leaving me a step behind

Rolling and rolling
Lost in the sense of truth
Blind between dead and alive

Motorized
Blinded sight
Aiming less

Please let me rust in a way I know
Wild it will be now soon
Let it rot and let be with no sun

[Chorus]
Coming,
Does it all fit to me?
Is it over?
Growing in this town
Does it hold any meaning?
Is it over?
Leaving me behind

Hide
Burns now to know
I got to get out

Give away your life
Give away your God
Give away, I demand to me

Give away your life,
Give away your God

Throw them away!

Give away your life
Give away your God
Give away, I demand to me

Give away your life,
Give away your God

Throw them away!

[Chorus]
Coming,
Does it all fit to me?
Is it over?
Growing in this town
Does it hold any meaning?
Is it over?
Down, forever low.
