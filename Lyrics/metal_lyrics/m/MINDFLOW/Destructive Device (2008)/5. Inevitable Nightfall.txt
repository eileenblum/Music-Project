We all have an evil side
My is the one I find...

Killed all the reason
Murder without remorse
Can't cure my wrath
Can't keep it locked

Demons in my head
Violence in my mind
Torment night and day
Murder without remorse

[Chorus]
Someday I will succumb
I can't hide it anymore!
Growing pain inside
Never goes way...
Never goes way...
My best is my worst!

Feel so mistreated
Blistered without a cause
Can't cure my wrath
Can't keep it locked

Evil drive my hand
Files guard my life
Torment night and day
Murder without remorse

[Chorus]
Someday I will succumb
I can't hide it anymore!
Growing pain inside
Never goes way...

All these years
I am trying to believe
And don't...
(Realize)
Let it all
Drive me away
But longer I held it
Stronger it becomes!

[Chorus]
Someday I will succumb
I can't hide it anymore!
Growing pain inside
Never goes way...
Never goes way...
My best is my worst!
