Both hands together
Put your face down on the floor!
Just kick your gun and
Don't you dare to run!

[Chorus]
Hands on the wall!!
Distressing call
Just after violence
comes the dead and final ending of hope
Is it for God?
Is it for God?

To be the one in this world alone
Swept the room to find some peace and
The Meaning for this fearful war
Growing down the road

Both hands together
Put your face down on the floor!
Just kick your gun and
Don't you dare to run!

[Chorus]
Hands on the wall!!
Distressing call
Just after violence
comes the dead and final ending of hope
Is it for God?
Is it for God?

Deceiving hope, closing doors
Building walls all over me
The more I wait, the more I long
to end this day and start again
Embrace this hollow world...

Both hands together
Put your face down on the floor!
Just kick your gun and
Don't you...
Don't you forget about your dark past!

[Chorus]
Hands on the wall!!
Distressing call
Just after violence
comes the dead and final ending of hope
Is it for God?
Is it for God?

The fate of all
Is save the world
From all the human race
Compel to live
Under an alias
For all the days
Of this endless life

Betraying our cause
Displaying guns and flaws

[Chorus]
Hands on the wall!!
Distressing call
Just after violence
comes the dead and final ending of hope
Is it for God?
Is it for God?
