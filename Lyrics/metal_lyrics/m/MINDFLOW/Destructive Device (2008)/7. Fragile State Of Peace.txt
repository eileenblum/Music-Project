Your name is being called

We got a deal
We've got to put an end on this

Mom bleeds on her own
Young kids that will never going to grow
A country you won't trust
A small dream at the point of a gun
Honesty down to dust
Your greed just leaving all your sons
A sightseeing of the worst
Concrete blocking people from their love

It might be late
To regain take back what we've lost
How can we forgive
For all they've done
For all they've done to us?

[Chorus]
I walk this long road
It's a cold day
It's hard to talk
I have this cold, cruel soul
And I can't believe
What I've become

Dead end, no return
Street seems to be killing all we've learned
Convicted is what we are
For neglecting the symptoms of this curse

Cold day, it's hard to walk
Behold while the city is left to burn
Drunk on fallacies
Sold faith for a buck

When all hope went away
And left a hole in your will
You're all you got
You don't want to give it away

It might be late
To regain take back what we've lost
How can we forgive
For all they've done
All they've done to us?

[Chorus]
I walk this long road
It's a cold day
It's hard to talk
I have this cold, cruel soul
And I can't believe
What I've become

You mean the whole world to me
But being left I can't let go
Do you need hearts just to break?
Do you know what went away?

An old man is alone
Hoping to be treated like one
He may not know
How many lives could it takes

[Chorus]
I walk this long road
It's a cold day
It's hard to talk
I have this cold, cruel soul
And I can't believe
What I've become

Fragile state of those who hate
War remained when hope went away

Fragile state of those who hate
War remained when hope went away

Mom bleeds on her own
Dead end, no return
Do you know what went away?
