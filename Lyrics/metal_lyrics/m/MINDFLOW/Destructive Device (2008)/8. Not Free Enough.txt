Weary and alone
My childhood is long gone
My eyes are dry
I feel like a stone

No one in a dozen years
No one seems to know
That I'm alive
Being held this long
One day I'll get out and live

[Chorus]
Live it hard
One day I'll get out
Live it hard
One day I'll get out
To be long and remain
Looking back
Now I'm losing

Wind strikes me hard
Allied with an endless storm
Fearing to find
Where I belong

Crying frozen tears
Warming my godless soul
Am I alive?
Dead all along
One day I'll get out and live

[Chorus]
Live it hard
One day I'll get out
Live it hard
One day I'll get out
To be long and remain
Looking back
I'm losing

Some bad events will come for you sometimes
Survive, tomorrow to meed
a little of all rights
Somehow
To season on
It's just rising indeed
And now regain the world
It's my ride

No more, now I breathe
And I own my way brother
Suddenly so nice

To regain the world is all that I've dreamed
In a manner usual
It's alright

[Chorus]
Live it hard
One day I'll get out
Live it hard
One day I'll get out
To be long and remain
Looking back
Now I'm losing

So come back
Where anyone is changing me
I can do what I think
It's right among these walls

So come back
Where anyone chases me
Freedom can be found
Only when I'm alone
