To live in this inapt world,
Isolated
To meet this, inapt world
Isolate it

You can't tell me how I feel
Can't tell me
You don't know

Don't be the bad thing in my soul

To live in this inapt world,
Isolated
To meet this, inapt world
Isolate it

[Chorus]
Time to live
Regain my belief
on the mankind
Trouble-filled
Now that I'm free
I'm alive

Now I live
What I believe is real
The pain I don't feel
Now that I'm free
I'm alive

To breathe in this dead world,
Slowly fading
Forbidden, spoken
New sensation

You can't tell me how I feel
You can't tell me
You don't know

Don't be a bad seed in my soul

Could I dream above all the mere?
(Did I undergo this)
Run away, another day
Ready to go away

[Chorus]
Time to live
Regain my belief
on the mankind
Trouble-filled
Now that I'm free
I'm alive

Now I live
What I believe is real
The pain I don't feel
Now that I'm free
I'm alive

Not so free
I've been domineered like you
No free-will but a ruling judgment

Submit to the law, the state, your god,
your chief, and your bankroll

I have no reason, why would I?
I'm no longer independent
Why am I run by anyone?

No more!
Get rid of all remorse
No more!
Get rid of all remorse

Could I dream above all the mere?
(Did I undergo this)
Run away, another day
Ready to go away

[Chorus]
Time to live
Regain my belief
on the mankind
Trouble-filled
Now that I'm free
I'm alive

Now I live
What I believe is real
The pain I don't feel
Now that I'm free
I'm alive

All this weight
Freedom so long I've waited
Showed that's not delight
Showed there's command
Time to live...
