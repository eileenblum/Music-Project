[Intro]

I don't need no dialogue
I already have you
If I have to lie, steal, cheat or kill
My God as a witness

[Verse:]
Mad as hell
I'm not gonna take this anymore
Go ahead
Make my day
It's time for me to restore

[Pre-Chorus:]
And when it's all over
I'll be hungry again
And when it's all over
I'll be hungry again and again and again

[Chorus:]
We own the rights
We're just thrust into this game
Thrust into this game
The most dangerous plot
We've ever had to face
Thrust into this game

[Verse:]
Made our past
from a big and empty jaw of lies
Broken bones
Scattered face
It's time for me to be reborn

[Pre-Chorus:]
And when it's all over
I'll be hungry again
And when all hope is over
I'll be hungry again and again and again

[Chorus:]
We own the rights
We're just thrust into this game
Thrust into this game
The most dangerous plot
We've ever had to face
Thrust into this game

Thrust into this game
The heat is off

[Chorus:]
We own the rights
We're just thrust into this game
Thrust into this game
The most dangerous plot
We've ever had to face
Thrust into this game
