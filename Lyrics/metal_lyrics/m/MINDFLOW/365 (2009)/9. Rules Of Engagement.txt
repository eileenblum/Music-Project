Armored tanks storming out from the base
It tattoo the road with the word annihilation
Aircrafts getting ready to land
They are clouding the sky
Spread all over the radar

Keep marching men 'till the end through the pain
When there, you lay all of your blood
Pronounce thirteen chapters of the âArt of Warâ
Determining the fate of men

When the first day ended of that bloody  May
Lives were stolen, lost inside a maze
And now before my eyes
A city falls to the ground
You call our name and wherever we'll be there

Hand-to-hand combat placed in the sand
Fueled the sun
Unraveled by rage

Keep bleeding bad through my vein for your sake
Keep firing hard, hostiles are down.
Pronounce thirteen chapters of the âArt of Warâ
Determining the fate of men

When the first day ended of that bloody  May
Lives were stolen, lost inside a maze
And now before my eyes a city falls to the ground
You call our name and wherever we'll be there

Call Us
Call Us
Call Us
Call Us

When the first day ended of that bloody  May
Lives were stolen, lost inside a maze
And now before my eyes
A city falls to the ground
You call our name and wherever we'll be there

When the first day ended of that bloody  May
Lives were stolen and lost
And now before my eyes
A city falls to the ground
You call our name, we'll be there
