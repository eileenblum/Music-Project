[Verse:]
I gave you everything
Still you want more
I keep picking the pieces from the one
I was before

[Pre-Chorus:]
âFalling is the best way to learn
how to walk to a better dayâ, they say.
Those days are gone
Now I am here to stay

[Chorus:]
I am impossible to overcome
Unreachable
Stronger than before
I'm walking tall now
Unbreakable
So prove me wrong
Tell me I was living a lie

[Verse:]
But now I am so tired to oversee
My life as a plan for what was supposed to be
You can't blame all your bruises on someone
If you can't hold on and fight

[Pre-Chorus:]
Adrenaline is running through my brain
I'm ready to bring this to an end

[Chorus:]
Impossible to overcome
Unreachable
Stronger than before
I'm walking tall now
Unbreakable
So prove me wrong
Tell me I was living a lie

I gave it all to you
More, more, you want more!

Now a turning point to face
I'm stronger than before
No pain I can't take
I'm ready to bring this to an end

[Chorus:]
Impossible to overcome
Unreachable
Stronger than before
I'm walking tall now
Unbreakable
So prove me wrong
Tell me I was living a lie
