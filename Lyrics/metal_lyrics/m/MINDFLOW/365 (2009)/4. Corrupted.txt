[Verse:]
Like a thief in the night
It will consume you
By stealing your soul
Leaves you with nothing
But sweaty palms

[Pre-Chorus:]
Your heart accelerate
It's 0 to 80 in to 2.9
The place is packed
But you feel like in a tide

[Chorus:]
Fast moves and slow reactions
Now you no longer master
The course of your actions
Human size puppet

[Verse:]
Tyranny of addictions:
The only God down here
Playing innocent to the bones
Like a child from the alley back home
You are number one in my unstoppable death roll

[Pre-Chorus:]
This mess escalated
Into a full-scale riot
Face the facts
There is no more place to hide

[Chorus:]
Fast moves and slow reactions
Now you no longer master
The course of your actions
Human size puppet

Last chance for your confession
Or you will no longer master
The course of your own salvation

Criminal
We are dancing on the edge of the law
Our world has been corrupted

[Chorus:]
Fast moves and slow reactions
Now you no longer master
The course of your actions
Human size puppet

Last chance for your confession
Or you will no longer master
The course of your own salvation

Trespassing eyes
Corrupted actions
Human size puppet
