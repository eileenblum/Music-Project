Intro:
dreams...
fade... covered in dust.

[Verse:]
No warning came
A sudden strike
Death from underground!
Mystic vows
could not stand
An overwhelming fate awaits now...

[Pre-Chorus:]
The nature's calm is raging
Oh God! Our world is shaking!

[Chorus:]
Crying!
Don't let the search to be over
Earth screams
Thousands of lives
were buried tonight
Don't give in
Help us now!

[Verse:]
Ruins
unfold a slaughter
Mothers, fathers
sons and daughters
Gone the light
limbs get colder
The bleeding soil
bites it's lips!

[Pre-Chorus:]
The greatest horror is breaking
In a nightmare of stone and dust
Still we pray

[Chorus:]
Crying!
don't let the search to be over
Earth screams
Thousands of dreams
were buried tonight
Don't give in
Help us now!
stone by stone
brick by brick
bone by bone
we shall rise again...

Don't let the search be over
Thousands lives
were buried tonight

[Chorus:]
Don't let the search to be over
Earth screams
Thousands of dreams
won't fade this way
I know, we will
rise again!
We shall rise
We shall rise
We shall rise again!
