[Verse]
And so it happened
Such a sad day,
It makes him wonder
Inspired by this pain

Friends and family gather now
They're trying to reconnect
The priest at the altar
He's talking to a saint

[Pre-Chorus]
From a heart that won't heal for now
From a friend that missed the chance
To say goodbye

[Chorus]
On a long road trip we'll walk together
Recalling days
Walking on I see a new direction
Yes, I'm on it.

There I'll be at peace so you remember,
Like wind and rain
On a long road trip we'll walk together
Together

[Verse]
Life runs in circle
Most don't understand
A day after another
Closer to the end

[Pre-Chorus]
From a heart that won't heal for now
From a friend that missed the chance
To say goodbye

[Chorus:]
On a long road trip we'll walk together
Recalling days
Walking on I see a new direction
Yes, I'm on it.

There I'll be at peace so you remember,
Like wind and rain
On a long road trip we'll walk together
Together

[Solo]

Lying on a star,
Flying through my dearest memories
A warm embrace
Candles bring the light,
Path is clear now for me to be

[Chorus:]
On a long road trip we'll walk together
Recalling days
Walking on I see a new direction
Yes, I'm on it.

There I'll be at peace so you remember,
Like wind and rain
On a long road trip we'll walk together
Together
