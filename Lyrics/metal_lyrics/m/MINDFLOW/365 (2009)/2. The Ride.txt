[Verse:]
A river blends with night
Fire burning up inside
Sensation is gone
Ignition off

Don't care to steer the wheel
The body thinks on it's own
Let the devil know I'm in her house tonight

[Chorus:]
I'm feeling the fall
The wind rides with me
Just turn the ignition off
This night belongs to me
You cannot stop me now
Turn the ignition off

[Verse:]
Stone thrown towards the surface
Sinking as the river flows
It's sinking down
I'm sinking down
An inner quest, a healing way of life
Keeps the fire urging up inside
Death and glory holding hands

[Chorus:]
I'm feeling the fall
The wind rides with me
Turn the ignition off
This night belongs to me
You cannot stop me now
I'm turning ignition off

And now a different shade of dark embraces the light
Cause I forgive myself for being me
My fortune is nothing more than a name to forget...
Oh I am not afraid

[Chorus:]
I'm feeling the fall
The wind rides with me
Turn the ignition off
This night belongs to me
You cannot stop me now
Turn the ignition off
I'm free from it all...
It belongs to me...
You can't stop me now...
I'm turning ignition off.
