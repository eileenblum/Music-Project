[Verse:]
Have you ever felt that you can
No longer hold to your past
It's like you have changed
When everything remains the same

[Pre-Chorus:]
And you just don't fit inside you
You can't stand being around you
You predict your days to come as unpredictable

I wasn't born to follow
I rather write my own destiny
I just wanna hold life with my bare hands

[Chorus:]
Reset
I reset my future
Reset
So I can call it mine

Reset
I reset my future
Right now

[Verse:]
Have you ever felt you won't last
Life is a cell with poisoned gas
You are trapped and framed for
Being different from the rest

[Pre-Chorus:]
You just don't care enough to
Try to change and be who they knew
I found the place where I can be invincible

I'm not here to swallow
My pride or my misery
A story untold
By whom I was meant to be

[Chorus:]
Reset
I reset my future
Reset
So I can call it mine

Reset
I reset my future
Right now
