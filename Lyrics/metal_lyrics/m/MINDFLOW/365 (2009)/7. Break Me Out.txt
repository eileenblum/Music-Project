[Verse]
I walked upon the earth alone
I was torn away
I have fallen
But never bow

Till my day arrives
I will learn how to live
Dying but standing on my feet

[PreChorus:]
For someone inside an empty dream,
To find an exit takes lots of proving to do

[Chorus]
I'll never forget,
I saw it in your eyes
You gave me the fire
That would break me out
Break me out
Break me out
Break me out

[Verse]
I let the rain
Erase my name
Because now the struggle has a face
My fate unfolds
It's all getting clear
Lightning the darkness that once set in

[PreChorus]
I closed my fist and held it high
Forgave what haunted me
This time it's do it or die

[Chorus]
I'll never forget,
I saw it in your eyes
You gave me the fire
That would break me out
Break me out
Break me out
Break me out
