It's a war out there!

[Verse:]
They fake my fate
I find my rights to believe
Raised in my shield of hate
I've built my world through the void in me
No tears to hide
I just don't bleed

[Pre-Chorus:]
Do you listen to me?
Can you see what I see?
The reason for the road I chose for me

[Chorus:]
War is there!
There are no rules, no certainty, no easy race
Fight with me!
People seem to always know what to do, how to behave
Burn in rage!
Everybody is lost and trying to find the way
Away from their own instinct...

[Verse:]
I hide my fight
Free minds
it freezes their soul
Dead cold

[Pre-Chorus:]
Do you listen to me?
Can you see what I see?
The reason for the road I chose for me

[Chorus:]
War is there!
There are no rules, no certainty, no easy play
Fight with me!
People seem to always know what to do, how to behave
Burn in rage!
Cause everybody is lost and trying to find the way
Away from their own instinct...

[Pre-Chorus:]
Do you listen to me?
The reason for my road...

[Chorus:]
War is there!
There are no rules, no certainty, no easy race
Fight with me!
People seem to always know but...
It's a war out there!
Everybody is lost and trying to find the way
Away from their own...
