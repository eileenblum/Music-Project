[Verse:]
Nine at the table
Sharpened skills
Aggressive players
Lights go dim for the thrill

Exchanging looks
Reading tells
Win in their eyes
Win in myself

[Pre-Chorus:]
Check it!
Bet it!
Or chose to fold!

Kings in hand It's an all-in,
Flick of sweat on a nervous brow
Stimulates the crowd
Chips placed measuring courage
Raise, Raise
All up to the sky
All hearts beat faster

[Chorus:]
My heart is beating faster
Excited by the action
Lights go dim for the thrill
Just waiting the moment
Eyes staring at the table
Feeling close to surreal

[Verse:]
It's up to you: check, bet or fold
Three words can lead it to the gold
Chips are placed measuring courage.
Raise!

[Pre-Chorus:]
Check it!
Bet it!
Or chose to fold!

Kings in hand It's an all-in,
Flick of sweat on a nervous brow
Stimulates the crowd
Chips placed measuring courage
Raise Risk
All up to the sky
All hearts beat faster

[Chorus:]
My heart is beating faster
Excited by the action
Lights go dim for the thrill
Just waiting the moment
Eyes staring at the table
Feeling close to surreal

Increasing anxiety
It's double or nothing for me
I calculated my odds and now
A Turn revealing a queen
The river flows with the king
It is time to show the cards,
and I'm
I'm all in
Check it!
Bet it!
Or choose to fold!
