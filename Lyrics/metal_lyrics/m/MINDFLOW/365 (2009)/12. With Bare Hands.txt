[Verse:]
I was a believer
But couldn't believe in me
I wish I had been taught
How to embrace the fears

[Pre-Chorus:]
But Things just come with time
Doesn't matter if you are not right
As long as you are not afraid to try

[Chorus:]
Choose to fly
Over walk
Head to open field
Where in our bare hands we believe

[Verse:]
I felt the anger
In a place where love should be
You showed me how to rot
And I will show you how to live

[Pre-Chorus:]
They say we are free to decide
But never free enough to defy
Like the still of dark
It beats the speed of light

[Chorus:]
Choose to fly
Over walk
Head to open field
Where in our bare hands we believe

And when you're looking back through the years
You always look for what isn't there
Are you in compliance with the feet that brought you here?

I choose to live on the edge

[Chorus:]
Choose to fly
Over walk
Head to open field
Where in our bare hands we believe
