[Pensado - 2:47]

Defend the atomic bomb
We're fed on global pain,
We crawl, we fall, destroy it all,
Cutting each others veins.

Human kind obeys
The unconscious thirst for violence.

So I came, I lived the way,
That told us to stop complain,
It's hard to [???] Real life,
It boils inside the brain.

In other times you'd cry,
Life is cruel, an excuse avoiding fight.
Wash over your mind, a gift to you.

It's day, good night!
Don't pretend you are looking for "the real path of life"

May this be a time to rest.
Proving on you hold control,
Proving as, you were the slide to show,
You run against it all.
