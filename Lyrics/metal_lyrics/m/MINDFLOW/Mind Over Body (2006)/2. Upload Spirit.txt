[Pensado, Hidalgo - 7:07]

[Bodhisattvas:]
Na mo o mi to fo
Na mo o mi to fo

[Buddha:]
Besides mind revolution,
Lies the spirit essential: still.
Enlight! 8 nobles lives,
Endless. Now will reunite.

[The architect:]
The quintessence of time,
Be ready! Stealth inside.
You may not crawl for life,
But you sure deserve it.
You meant to cross the line,
Unanimated hive.
Your reign might be a rot state of mind!
I've got to fool you, around you,
Ugly sight in the rear view mirror.

[Buddha:]
Would it lead you right by the surtax of illusions?
Arrested truth. Where I am.

[The architect:]
Undertook from breathing like knife.
Rasing cold, white, smite, tight, fright!
Low steam is breaking in and it like to stay.
Bribe time, bribe tao, bribe until is my whine.
It's time to become me!

[Buddha:]
Oh! Swim away and come right back to this shore.
Upload crime against I.

[The architect:]
Knock it off! I'm mental inside!
Defend the atomic bomb, hands together, we pay.
We're fed on global pain,
We crawl, we fall, destroy it all,
Cutting each others veins.

[Buddha:]
Human kind obeys
The unconscious thirst of violence.
You run against yourself! Raising cold.

[The architect:]
Lies will save you,
Life will break you.
Uh! Numb,
I'm now. Where to see, where to run now?

[Buddha:]
Besides mind revolution,
Lies the spirit essential: still.
Enlight! No more lies!

[Myself:]
So I came, I lived the way,
That told us to stop complain,
It's hard to pacify.
Real life, it boils inside the brain.
In other times you'd cry,
Life is cruel, an excuse avoiding fight.
Wash over your mind, and then upload!
It's day, good night!
Don't pretend you are looking for the real path of life
maybe this can be a time to rest.
Proving on you hold control,
Proving as, you were the slide to show,
You run against it all.
You run against yourself,
You run against,
You run against yourself.
