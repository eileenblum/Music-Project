Strength to mute my fears
although the tide is high
I'm swimming back to life again
and under.

Control is preserved under heat
Yet the snow keeps us all away
from moments of lucid dreams

Days of pure agony.
My arms are kept in time
Although the tide is high again
Vision are real, I see it!
Can't move on, I feel it!
Push them back, I hear it!
Where's the sounds
I use to see?

Learning what to do
as things go on but
there's no teacher to say
Yearning, it falls through
the misty way, so hard
to see with my own eyes...

Stop looking behind
and move on to the show
It's the only way, so life
flows ahead.
To be the savior of your own,
no one will throw you glow,
It's a crown you have
to build yourself.

So long believing the path
is where it should stay...

This world pretends
to be the perfect place,
We all believe
in common senses.

We couldn't live
In a different time
A match of war
In a game!

Woras of wisdom brings
Her close to my home
No light, she walks
by the dark holding up a rose.
It started the end,
begin of my pain,
Shown me trough my hands,
The inspiration, feel of passion
are running in my veins.

I'm watching this
coming to you!

I saw you flew,
you didn't return
It can never be undone.
It's so hard to believe
that we all may never return!

Healing wounds, washing stains
(Another point of view is
healing pain!)
Keep that in mind a view
from here...

Time all is done just waiting,
for him to finally comes
It's all it takes.
Dry everywhere and all around,
Still I can walk on my way,
No more haze.

All is dry, no haze!
