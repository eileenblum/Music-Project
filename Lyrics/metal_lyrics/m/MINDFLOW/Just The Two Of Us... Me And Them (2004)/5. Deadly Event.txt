She showed me many ways to stop him from that deadly event.
I never did the best that I could do to understand.

Walking through mistakes, it's haunting me,
He never would listen to me!

A tragedy will lie on the feelings that we hide,
Kept inside only damage your mind
Until the end of time you'll never be alone.

A new scene is falling into my view
A new connection to this world
Again a speechless mistake!

I'm standing next to his door room,
Million thoughts keep crossing my head,
But still the end of time will never come alone.

A tragedy will lie on the feelings that we hide,
Kept inside only damage your mind
No matter how you try the world keeps moving on.
