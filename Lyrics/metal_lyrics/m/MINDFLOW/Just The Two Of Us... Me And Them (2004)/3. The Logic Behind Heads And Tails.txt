Moving figures from the night before,
Matching past days with moments to come.

Raging for noble values, three becoming one
You seem to know all my lives a past away from me
No conclusions, near of a breakdown

Among tricky options
Deal with it somehow
Wrong ways are going and don't turn around.

Shine, through a cloudy night a view that pictures bye.
Shine, just the two of us, no one but me and them!

I cannot believe the things you said to me, see no sign of you
(Can't get enough!)
Hear a whisper, it follows me, perspective is coming through
(It feels like voodoo)

It controls your empty side,
It denies all hopes you buy.

I walk, live, I breathe again
I try to read what's between the lines of doubts on my shoulders,
It digs in my skin!

Among tricky options
Deal with it somehow
Wrong ways are going, don't turn around.

Shine, through a cloudy night a view that pictures bye.
Shine, just the two of us, no one but me and them!

Though we all refuse to know somewhere else to be
Unable to hide, writing fate through me
The choice isn't mine, unlock your mind!
