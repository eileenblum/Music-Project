A long history short, enough for the tears and sorry of any sort.
(The coffin, the tears, the sadness, the book, the
flowers, the priest, they all dressed in black?)

They all hold my hand, this felling I can?t stand,
Is compressing my heart from the fury against myself.

Your wide eyes, I feel them, I miss every second of my life.

It's true, I failed many times, a few moments I do regret
The thing to keep in mind is attitude shows honesty.

It's true I failed many times, a few moments I do regret
The thing we have to keep in mind is attitude shows honesty.

Days passing, time is crawling,
Feel the cold within and it brings no hope.

All the sorry is left behind, a few moments I won't forget
Only one aim to strike facing life with honesty.

After all each eye will see what the mind allows
When is time to judgment,
When it's final around.
Cutting shape of your own destiny
Is a work that has to be done
To decide the final end?

Frightened, delightened, pretending brave while afraid
Among the living we hide secrets from the dead.

All the sorry is left behind, a few moments I won't forget
Only one aim to strike facing life with honesty.

All the sorry is gone by, a few moments I had to fight
Only one aim to strike living life in honesty.
