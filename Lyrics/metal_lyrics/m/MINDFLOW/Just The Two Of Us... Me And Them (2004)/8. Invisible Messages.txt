Hearing Pearl's voice when it rains
Feeling the distance that echo's raise

I ruined all my choices in vain
I cannot complain to my eyes

Letting my ignorance underneath the facts,
The damage is done, we'll make his way through
Chills down my spine, makes visualize you
Regret and sorrow must not affect my attitude.

Hearing John's voice through my pain
Want to forgiveness to touch my hand.

Falling, I'm still calling you
Calling, I'm still Falling in you

Letting my ignorance underneath the facts,
The damage is done, we'll make way through
Chills down my spine, makes visualize you
Regret and sorrow must not affect.

How can be right?
Should we even try?
How invisible messages can be to me?

I whisper all the reasons he should be free,
I'm living all the fears I now retrieve.
I whisper all the reasons he should be free,
I'm living all the fears I now retrieve.

Falling, I'm still calling you
Calling, I'm still Falling in you
