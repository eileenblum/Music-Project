Forever met your eyes
Green stone wasn't a disguise
But the expected passage
to a new life,
I find this time

The stain of pain
will wash away

The endless link was shown me by
The green stone
I still have something to say
Where's the place where I belong
Where's the freedom we waited
for so long...
