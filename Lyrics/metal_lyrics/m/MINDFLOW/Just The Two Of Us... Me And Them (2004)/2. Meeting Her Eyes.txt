Blind feelings went blind and fade in me
Quick as a blink, they seem to hypnotize
A scene's flowing towards his old home
Means he's holding truth behind

A reason to believe in me
A reason to believe in me

Real illusions fill my mind
Betrail comes to define
Life pointed directions
That wasn't meant to be

Holding on pressure
Pressure make us believe
Beware, don't believe in what your eyes will see!

Make him believe
Bring him to be
What the eye can see

The old lady is showing draws
That I have never seen
My brother is locked between two worlds
Because of me

Make him believe
Bring him to be
What the eye can see
