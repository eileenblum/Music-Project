Ruling the earth's sad melody
Ruling the war's violent melody

The King of the Nature is Shatan
That doesn't affirm
Or else to deny

His chimerical clouds
Build the sky's fire
That extinguishes the star of the glory light

Oh earth, hear those blasphemies
Because those are blasphemies of your sons
The divine concience fire

Oh, Have-Iod
Oh, Have-Iod

Oh life,
You are only illusion
Go back to your original ashes

I'm the life,
The dream's life
Or the life's dream's
To me the desolated and full of pain
