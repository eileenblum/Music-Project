Total disgrace
In my demoniac entrails

Apocalyptic dawn
Of the cosmos that falls in me
Misanthropic desires bleeding
Signs from the light

Sick body, diseased soul,
The demon's mark in my skin,
Cult me!!!

Total hate
In my diabolical thoughts

Plagues are kissing me forever
The black waters that run in my veins
I am a temple of gothic emotions,
Violence, suffering and sadism!!!

I'm the plagues,
I'm the black waters,
I'm the violence,
I'm the suffering,
I'm the sadism,
I'm.

I'm the Seven Legions, I'm the Seven Demons
Hail Satan!!
