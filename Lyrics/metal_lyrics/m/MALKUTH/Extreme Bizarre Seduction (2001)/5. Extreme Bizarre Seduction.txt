Serene is my Psychopatia Sexualis,
I rape the nymphs
Immolating their innocence
Send me the Hell and Paradise
I kiss the horrible
"In the hell of the hallucinated vision
I saw mountains of blood
Filling the highway,
I saw the red innards for the ground"

Gothic life, Neo-Vampiric Society,
The future of necrosadophilia,
Nostalgia of Sodom

We are the children of Caligula,
Total vulgar erotasia,
We are feeling the fragrance of the hate,
You cannot dream, impure depraved!!!

Into the scenery of Shamballah,
I'm the seventh son
Of the Sun and Empusa,
Lover of the thirteenth candle.
