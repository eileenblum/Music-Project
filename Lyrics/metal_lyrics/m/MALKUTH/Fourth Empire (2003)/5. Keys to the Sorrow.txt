My silent soul
The worst of the melancholies
A complete abysmal pain
Your touch is the spiritual darkness

I was a cadaver before living
Sad, when listening, blow by blow
The succession of the seconds
I suffer, therefore I know thatÂ´s an infinite sorrow

The more I resist,
More increases and it sinks the wound
And when I transpose the soul
That sadness still follows me
I'm the key to the sorrow - an hymn to pain
