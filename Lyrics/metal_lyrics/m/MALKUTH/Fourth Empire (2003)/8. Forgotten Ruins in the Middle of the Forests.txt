Secular agony in vain
Times that tear my soul
My blood is so bitter as the hate
Abstinence of life and kindness

I already saw many gods die in the graces
and I felt Proserpine at my side
In many grounds I will be still buried
Tears will fall from the bastard

Equilibrium between fertility and death
Eternal seas in fury
The thunders that try kill me disappeared
Visit me in the Hell or Earth
