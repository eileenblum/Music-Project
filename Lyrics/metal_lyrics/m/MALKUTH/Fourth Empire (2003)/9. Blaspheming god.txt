"I'm a man, I'm a disciple
Free me of this crucifixion"
Your words won't bring me mercy,
You will die and your blood will be my offering
Showing my tongue, my body is possessed
Burning the bible and vomiting in you
Blaspheming god, I am God

Showing my tongue, my body is contorted
Burning the bible and vomiting in you
Your words won't bring me mercy
You will die and your blood will be my offering
Fool !!! I want your soulâ¦
