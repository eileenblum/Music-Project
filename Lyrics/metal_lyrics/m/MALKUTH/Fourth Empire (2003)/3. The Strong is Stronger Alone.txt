Our morals is besides the sin
Terrible is our way to the fight
Honour and hate living in harmony

Three coffins and a shield
Symbols of perversity in Muspelheim
Three keys to the fourth victory

There is the force of the race
Warriors of an insane law
I'm the protector of the law
Dogs in satanic orgy, through the essence
Carnage in the temple of jehovah
Servants crushed by the tyrants

Thunders and lust around Loki
Mountains under a funeral mist
Forest baptized for the blood of the swords
Iron weapons, glory and victory
The strong is stronger alone
