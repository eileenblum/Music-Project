I live because I die everyday
Where Nergal put your wisdom

Horizons of abysses in harmony
Shades of the brave, end of war

In direction to the North or the South
I know that I will find Goddesses of Solitude,
Midnight arrives, I will have Luna
In the mortal winds, I will go

Always in dialogue with the stars
Shine and darkness!!!
Never cry for me
I'm the living dead in the summer lands
