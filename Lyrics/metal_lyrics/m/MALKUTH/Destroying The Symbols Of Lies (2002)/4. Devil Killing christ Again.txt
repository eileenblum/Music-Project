Invert the cross and kiss it
Flames will burn the sanctity

Kill the hypocrite, kill all the Messiahs
Through the Abissal Demons

Devil Killing Christ Again

I defecate on Golgotha
In my hate for the Nazareth
In your divine flesh and profane soul
The mayhemic beginning of the hunger for the Hell

In nine gates, no peace
In nine summers, no peace
The Time of Goat rise, Jeovah is dead
The messianic era ended, Corpus Christ quartered
