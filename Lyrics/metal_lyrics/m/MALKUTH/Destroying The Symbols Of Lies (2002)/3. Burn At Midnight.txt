Raining in my pagan paradise
Deep and humid forest
Natural Ghost and Fifty Men's King
The Sacred Goat appears

I'm the Insulter, I'm the Neo-Armageddon
The horns of Belial strengthen us
Our Queen Death smiles
The eyes of Seth in the guide

Burn the body
Burn the sky
Burn the soul
Burn at Midnight
Reborn besides the gates of Asmorod,
In battles against the god's monkeys
The Serpent of the Nihilism flies
Their reign will kneel down
