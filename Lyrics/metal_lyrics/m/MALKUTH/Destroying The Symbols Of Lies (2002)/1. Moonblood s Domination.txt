The chaos reigns over the earth
The seventh cycle is closed
We loved the destruction
And the smell of burnt oil and blood

Holy war, Zersas smiles!!!
Total nuclear devastation,
Holocaust of the purity

Honor, rebellion, insurrection,
Our mottos,
Kill or die, genocide,
In the name of the Power

It's the moonblood's domination
It's the moonblood's domination
