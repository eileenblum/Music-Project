A Demigod never feel the sword's blade
Sons of Hades, centurions and barbarians
In the forests and for the crowns battles will be joined
Blood, fire and steel, this is my alchemy

Rise your bloody flag!
Pazuzu drinks us with his glimmer

My honor will be satisfied with your entrails !
Where bonfires heat up my dagger

Today we will celebrate the Nature's Spirits
The valiant warriors rest in the dark forests' glades

Believe, don't cross my destiny !
Pazuzu drinks us with his glimmer

My honor will be satisfied with your entrails !
Where bonfires heat up my dagger

A Demigod never feel the sword's blade
Sons of Hades, centurions and barbarians
In the forests and for the crowns battles will be joined
Blood, fire and steel, this is my alchemy
