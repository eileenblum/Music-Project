I hear his cries, they echo in the night
I snap back to reality and walk into the room..

Fetal positioned in the dark
Crying for help
Trapped inside his head
Hands crossed, praying for help

HIS EYES, HIS EYES, THEY GLIMMER IN THE NIGHT
HIS VOICE, HIS VOICE, A TORMENTED CRY PIERCING MY HEART
AFTER TWO FULL DECADES THE DEVIL MAKES HIS RETURN
PLEASURE TO MEET YOU, OLD FRIEND

I considered myself strong but this sight is tearing me apart
The sky collapses as an old man sheds a tear
The sky collapses, and this one.. it's killing me..

This room, this moment
It will haunt me, I know
This room, this moment
Oh God, it's tearing me apart

His eyes, His eyes
They will haunt me, I know
His voice, His voice
Oh God, it's killing me too..
