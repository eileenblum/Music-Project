I always say what you want to hear
Close my eyes, throw it all away
I always make the same mistakes
Over and over again

I've forgotten everything I learned
Constant tension, deprivation
Once again you've got the best of me

Oh God, it's driving me insane
When he left I lost a part of me
Take your secrets to your grave
Just remember I won't forget

I DON'T KNOW WHY I WALKED AWAY,
WHY I TURNED MY BACK ON YOU
BUT THE PAST IS SOMETHING I CAN'T FIX
I DON'T KNOW WHY I WALKED AWAY
BUT TONIGHT IS MY CHANCE FOR A LAST GOODBYE

Me versus me, is it all in my head?
Father forgive me for I have sinned

Oh God, it's always in my head
When he left I was torn apart
No farewells, no goodbyes
Just remember I won't forget

I was lost in the nothingness I created as my monument
Swallowed by the tide, pulling me deeper and deeper under the wave

I always say what you want to hear
Close my eyes, throw it all away
The walls are closing in
Discomfort leaning up beside me
