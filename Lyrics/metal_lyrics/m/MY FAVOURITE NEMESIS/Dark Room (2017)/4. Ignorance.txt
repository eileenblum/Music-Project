Once again, you tried again
Turn the table and reach for the otherside
Side effects count as lies
Wallow in the filth of your own corruption

You have deepened your own pits
I can feel the leeches watching my back

REFUSE TO LISTEN TO YOUR SENSES
LET THE WORLD FIX ITSELF, IT ALWAYS DOES
CLOSE YOUR EYES, PLUG YOUR EARS, SHUT YOUR MOUTH
LET THE WORLD CLEAN ITSELF FROM IGNORANCE

Up, up close we share the same view
Far, far away they differ

Close your eyes, plug your ears, shut your mouth
The world won't listen, why would you?

We are at the verge of this world
Hell above, Heaven below
Accept your fate and wait for the lift
