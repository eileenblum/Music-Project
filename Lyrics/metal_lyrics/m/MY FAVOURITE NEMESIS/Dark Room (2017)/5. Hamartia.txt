An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind
An illusion of control makes the hopeless smile
A scripted game in scripted frames
The skeptics rise
Conscripted minds ready in line
What goes up, must come down

Craft a quill from the feathers of my freedom
Dip the tip in my brothers' blood
Scrawl your name in the declaration
How do you sleep at night?

ON ROSE PETALS, ON A GOLDEN THRONE,
THE KINGDOM CROWN SET TO GOD-MODE
DECLARATION SIGNED WITH BLOOD
ALL THE ANTS MARCH TO THE BEAT,
IT'S A LONG WAY TO THE SHORE
THE FEET RISE ON THE TABLECLOTH

I cannot justify the cause, nor the absence of sanity
Let the world burn while each side of your heart beat patiently
