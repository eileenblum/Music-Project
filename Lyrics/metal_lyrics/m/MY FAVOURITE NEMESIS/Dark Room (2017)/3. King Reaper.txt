You reap what you sow

I've hit recoil
I've found my head in the sand
Recollect your spine from the underworld
You turncoat! You took the line of pride
Reassemble your life
Reassemble it right this time

KING REAPER, YOU SHOULD HAVE FORESEEN IT ALL
BUT YOU CHOSE TO SIGN YOUR OWN DEATH SENTENCE
THE REROOTING OF YOUR BROKEN DREAMS
NOW ALL THE STRINGS ATTACHED I AM STUMBLING ON

The air that I breathe
An extraction of your words
I see my future changing
This air is breathing me
Believe in me
It's a long shot in the dark
but when the pieces fall it's still a shot

Hand in hand with the Devil himself
I walk to the point of no return
You should have taken the mulligan
Now you are taking mine
