Destruction, havoc
A lament for your innocence
Weak hearts restrain me
An attempt to languish all this power

My vision: red filtered
Anyone near shall perish at sight
This frigid possession may alter human morals

THE WEIGHT OF THE UNDERWORLD
THE WEIGHT OF ALL THE SINS IN THE WORLD
THE WEIGHT OF A THOUSAND STORMS
FEAST THE DEMON INSIDE OF ME

My vision: red filtered
Distortion: solution

I can't see through the chaos in my eyes
My only weakness is killing me
All your strong points are dying with me

It redefined my entity
It retouched my heaven
I stopped cutting my horns
I got a taste of chaos
