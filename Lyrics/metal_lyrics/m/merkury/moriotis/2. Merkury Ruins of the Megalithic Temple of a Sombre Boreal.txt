[Part I]

Solve et - coagula
Dissolver of this alchemical code
That shatters the veil of this world
And beyond all space and time in mind
I will find the keys
To my creations and time
Rebirthed from this starry womb of Gods
Breaking the bone
Of their facades

Through this rite
The aethyr shall flow
To this night
The spirits dost go
Quicksilver in my veins
Animal nitrates howling thy name
Bled in pain
This hunting is my fucking game

Time and time again my shadow rises from this pit
To be reborn of this earthly spit
Fire of the crucible tempers my soul
Reborn like a phoenix through reverse gravity pull

[Part II]

Breaking open the secrets of this world
Mind uncoiled time unfurled
Fetters of hate
They seal my fate
Seek what's to become
Until it is done

Battalions of howling armies
Scorch my skin to my kin
Fleeting shadows of this un-earthly echo
Beckoning death 'til my rest

Riptides of consciousness focusing on this bind
Through the hyp-gnosis I shalt find
Definition of soul shall unwind
Scarlet sunset grant this to my mind

Beauty of this world
Grown so goddamned cold
To time immemorial
Sown so fucking old

Swimming through the void
With a thousand shooting stars
Reborn of this light
In a great nebular

Returning to my spawned bore whore
Love to the goddess forever more
I look to the sky as I ask why
When will this time come 'til I die

Tremmoring through the night
As this shimmering world passes by
Told these secrets by an old coven in vein
But it stirs my mind
Thus making me insane
By the light of the moon
Soon this shall wane

Gazed at the lightning-jagged cracked maw of god
Lifting this facade of all and beyond
To the towers billowing in the wind
As time shall repeat
Again and again

Sailing through the sky
On these solar winds of will
Stalking my prey
'Til I make this un-earthly kill
Strengthening of one's will
With the hyper-focused mind
I will continue this great journey
Until it is my time
