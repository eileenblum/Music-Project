I've seen the light fading
On the hopes you never knew
The act of life is so degrading
Cannot wait until it's through

Riding through hell again
I'll burn you up in my flames
I will not be mistaken
I'll crush you in the palm of my hand
You'll be the victim of my demands
I will not be forsaken

I can feel it
I don't feat it
Death means nothing
When life means less
Will it ever end?

I've seen your life failing
Beyond hope it always was
The tracks I left were all derailing
There is no why it's just because

I'll rise from the ashes again
Be the master of this domain
We will not be mistaken
We'll drive you to the will of my plans
We will not be forsaken

I can feel it
I don't feat it
Death means nothing
When life means less
Will it ever end?

Still hoping for the very first time
To find a sign telling me that I'm not wrong
Can you feel it there inside of your head?
Deserted mind scape all alone that you cannot break

Can you hear me when I talk to the dead?
Or is it just like talking to you

Riding through hell again
I'll burn you up in my flames
I will not be mistaken
I'll crush you in the palm of my hands
You'll be the victim of my demands
I will not be forsaken

I can feel it
I don't feat it
Death means nothing
When life means less
Will it ever end?
