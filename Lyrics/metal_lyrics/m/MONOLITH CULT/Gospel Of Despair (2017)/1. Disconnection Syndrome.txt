You want to suffer and I aim to please
It hurts like no other and feeds this disease
Human extinction is all that you dream
We've all got to suffering a life that demeans

This pain has fallen into the numb
Berates never ending, looking at what we've become
The flag of darkness has unfurled
For the sake of twisted pleasure
You destroy your world

Pain and torture
Thoughts are shattered in meaningless form
Manipulation and desperation
Is killing us all

You won't get forgiveness for all that you've done
And there is no freedom in this prison of one
A solitary confinement you cannot escape
Exist in denial, exist 'til you break

This pain has fallen into the numb
Berates never ending, looking at what we've become
The flag of darkness has unfurled
For the sake of twisted pleasure
You destroy your world

Pain and torture
Thoughts are shattered in meaningless form
Manipulation and desperation
Is killing us all

Evade yourself, degrade yourself again
Deploy yourself against yourself
In this war that's never ending
Destroy yourself, despise yourself

This pain has fallen into the numb
Berates never ending, looking at what we've become
The flag of darkness has unfurled
For the sake of twisted pleasure
You destroy your world.
