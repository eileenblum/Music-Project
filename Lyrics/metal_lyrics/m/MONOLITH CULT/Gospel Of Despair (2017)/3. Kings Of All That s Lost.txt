The graveyard of the mournful
Sorrow is all we're ever known
This melancholy overlord
Destroys us from the inside

I can't control my yesterdays
Tomorrow always seems the same
And I can't stand today
Been abused through history
The answers never come to me
So we just feel the shame

So dark, so desperate, so down
So blind, so pathetic, we wear this crown

We're the kings of all that's lost
The monolith has made us this
We're the kings of all that's lost
The monolith has made us
We're the kings of all that's lost

Epitome of failure
We know just who you are
Emotional desolation
Not knowing how to feel

These memories are hard to bear
I hear your voice but no-ones there
The words are in my head
Holding onto misery
This life will be the death of me
So I just hide the pain

So dark, so desperate, so down
So blind, so pathetic, we wear this crown

We're the kings of all that's lost
The monolith has made us this
We're the kings of all that's lost
The monolith has made us
We're the kings of all that's lost

All we are is all we know and all we know are lies
The kingdom of this fucking mess from which we cannot hide
This golden age of useless fucks has trampled on our shells
Despite their claims, these husks of skin
Have nothing left to sell

We're the kings of all that's lost
