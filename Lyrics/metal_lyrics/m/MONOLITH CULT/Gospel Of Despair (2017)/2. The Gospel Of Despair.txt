Looking at the world with a sense of disgust
I don't know who I can trust

Just another pack of lies
Won't you ever learn?
It'll lead you to your demise
'Cause what you get is what you've earned

We won't last another hundred thousand years

We won't last another hundred thousand years

We bear the mark of this world
And I'm hearing it everywhere
No saviours' ark for this world
This is the gospel of despair

The impoverished lay dying whilst nothing gets done
This is the era of the selfish ones

Just another fake religion
You're bowing down to
Another Utopian vision
That never comes true

We won't last another hundred thousand years

We won't last another hundred thousand years

We bear the mark of this world
And I'm hearing it everywhere
No saviours' ark for this world
This is the gospel of despair

Can't they tell us where it all went wrong?
And we've holding on for much too long
The degradation of not being good enough to exist
A fear of knowing that when you're gone you won't be missed

We bear the mark of this world
No saviours' ark for this world
And I'm hearing it everywhere
This is a reading from the gospel of despair
