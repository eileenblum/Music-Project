My birth sign was the mushroom cloud
This collective human future fractured

Another life, another death
Another body laid to rest
Another day, another lie
Another fucked up way to die

Can we end the suffering?
Just by causing more

Sympathy for the living
It's a cross to bear
Sympathy for the living
It destroys them
Sympathy for the living
It's a cross to bear
Sympathy for the living

We thought the worst was over
But the worst is yet to come

Behold a fool that holds a proof
Behold another failing truth
Behold a god that holds a gun
Behold a war that's never won

If you don't feel despair
You don't know what's going on in this world

Red cloud at dawn
Humanising hell
Defended to death
Rise of the dark sun

Sympathy for the living
It's a cross to bear
Sympathy for the living
It destroys them
Sympathy for the living
It's a cross to bear
Sympathy for the living
