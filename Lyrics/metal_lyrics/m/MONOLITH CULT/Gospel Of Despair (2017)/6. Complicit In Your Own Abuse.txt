There's always time for one last time
As it pulls you in
Another failed attempt at life
Another loss, you win
Failure is not an option
But it's all you've ever known
Despair descends on you too often
This vision of nothing your own

Told a truth that was a lie
Complicit in your own abuse
Complicit in your own abuse

Is this the joy of suffering?
We've no where left to go
A darker side discovering
That there's nothing left to know
Is this the only way?
Is this how you treat yourself?
Every single day

Told a truth that was a lie
Complicit in your own abuse
Complicit in your own abuse

Inside yourself you never shut up
Tales of grief that fuck you up

This auditory sense is a cacophonous silent void
Dragging, tearing, crying, ripping itself, destroyed

There's always time for one last time
As it pulls you in
Another failed attempt at life
Another loss, you win
This is an humanity death
Is this the only way?
Is this how you treat yourself?
Every single day

Told a truth that was a lie
Complicit in your own abuse
Complicit in your own abuse

Inside yourself you never shut up
Tales of grief that fuck you up
