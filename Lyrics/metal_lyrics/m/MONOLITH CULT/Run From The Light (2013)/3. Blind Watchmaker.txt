When will it ever be over
When will it ever be done
Banished forever into nowhere
Always waiting for no one

I'm so ashamed of myself
Where can I go so I can be free
Oh free me

I'm a raging angerholic
So it's first come first hurt
It's time to lay the hammer down
On a face that deserves the worst

And you know that your life
Is such a disgrace

Didn't ever think that there would ever come a time that I would feel so low
Blind watchmaker are you watching can you show a little sign
That doesn't say oh no

Reside in your black soul until tomorrow
Believing that day will always come
Your despair leads you to only sorrow
Too long like this you've carried on

I can't blame nobody else
What can I do so I can be free
Oh free me

You're ailing, you're moronic
Despised by the mighty truth
Try to erase you from the ground
No heaven or hell awaits for you
