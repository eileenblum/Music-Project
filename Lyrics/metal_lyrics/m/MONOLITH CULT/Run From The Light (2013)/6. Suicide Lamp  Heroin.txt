Caress me with your body
And hold me till the end
Inject me with your love
So fucked it's heaven sent
The needle teasing me
Behold the master plan
This shit don't come for free
Just get it when you can

Black light fades away
Can't numb this pain no more
Don't listen to what they say
We've all got reasons
Can't stand another day
This evens out the score
Don't need help anyway
Self aimed treason

Suicide and heroin
Let's thank the Lord for the state we're in

Infect my dying thoughts
Reveal the storm of lies
Decaying living corpse
So pathetic in your eyes
One last chance for freedom
And only one way out
The spoon burns black for you
Of this there ain't no doubt

No I don't need your help
I cannot help myself
We're going straight to hell

Do it to me again
You know I'll never win
All I know is suicide and heroin
All I know is suicide and heroin
