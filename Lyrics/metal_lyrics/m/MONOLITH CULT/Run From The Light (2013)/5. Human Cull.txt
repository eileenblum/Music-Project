Ride along on solar winds
Can't take it back to where it all begins
You tie me up in pain and torture
Say you will but never do what you ought to

There's something gone wrong inside your head
You know that it's coming
A human cull in the land of the living dead

Cast aside what bad luck brings
Can't take away the pain of all of your sins
Habitual this downward spiral
You say you won't so don't you tell me that I will

That voice inside says kill it or kill yourself
Take my advice, let demons die
Behold this vision of hell

Bastard lies what karma brings
Lay down to die and leave behind all your things
Overrun, taken in silence
In friendship they come but they will end it in violence
