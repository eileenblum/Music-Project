Used to think I was something
But then I saw the face in the mirror
Telling me to end it all

It's down the street
Not across the road
This way I bleed
And don't you know that it's all for you

Seen it all before
But never knew
This tirade takes away
All the things you wanted to behold
Once more I can't find a way

So you're holding out
Death means nothing much
When it's all you can take

You've lost your soul
And you lost your hold

You've been sold down the river

Now you see it means nothing
And all your prayers have been sold down the river
They'll do nothing
You've been betrayed

Destroy the priest
Destroy the mullah
They are the beasts
And they will take everything from you

Seen it all before
But never knew
This tirade takes away
All the things that you wanted to behold
Once more I can't find a way
