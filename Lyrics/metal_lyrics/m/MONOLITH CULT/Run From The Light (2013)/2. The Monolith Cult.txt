Who's gonna write the words
To you final epitaph
It's so absurd
That your pain makes me laugh
I'm at it again despairing victories
I'm not gonna pretend
That you mean a thing to me

The monolith cult
It comes to take over

Who's gonna shed a tear
When the end it takes a hold
A mind of fear
That never was my own
They're at it again
Parading victories
Kneel and pray for amends
But given only misery

You've lost it all
No second chances
Have faith in this
It's never getting better

No use in hope
That's for the non-believers
Don't know what's good for yourself
This god's a pessimist

Cult, cult, cult
