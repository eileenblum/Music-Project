Violent movements on the surface
Of a dying god we know
Magnetic pulses sent through time
Some day it's gonna blow

Burn me up in your fire
Let me know what the real deal is
That voice inside is a liar
And it knows what your weakness is

Death seems easy and life's so painful
What's the truth that you need to hear
Some choose death and others think they choose life
But the end is all that's coming near

Violent movements of a dying god
Violent movements of a dying god
