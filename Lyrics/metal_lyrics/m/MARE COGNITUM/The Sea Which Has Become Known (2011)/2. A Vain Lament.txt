My soul
lost in frozen wastelands
My vision blurs
My blood runs cold
I fade, cast up into the sky

This mind stretched into boundless infinity
I am no longer chained to flesh

Witnessing unfathomable darkness
Paths of stars cross in and out of view
I march through the mouth of the nether realm
Obscured by clouds, luminous fragments
I feel the weight of the cosmos

Before me an apparition
Petrified I flee
I seek refuge
But why?

Surrounded by lifelessness and ignorance
I give myself to the sea of stars

Witnessing unfathomable darkness
Paths of stars cross in and out of view
I march through the mouth of the nether realm
To observe the brilliance of the never-ending void

Obscured by clouds, luminous fragments
Of exhausted time
I feel the weight of the cosmos
Bearing on my soul

Dreams of life, they race through my vision
Like phantoms surrounding my grave of ice

I return to the void of nonexistence
I become one with the specter
Our wills become one
âWelcomeâ, I am told.

âRest your mind.â
I give up my soul and the shadows take part in me
I cannot even choose to regret
