Luminous web of bones
Sing chorus of catastrophe
Woe within the once serene
Dimensional singularity

Coaxial dimensions collide
Bleed upon themselves
Open into blackness
Void rips into void
Spread across the bleak
Chasm of the indwelling
Seared and threshed
Melted into consciousness

Negation
Of time
Reversal
Of matter

And within this catastrophe
Another cosmos will be born
Refined in chaos and purified in death
The child consumes its mother
Luminous web of bones
Sing chorus of catastrophe
Woe within the once serene

Coaxial dimensions collide
Bleed upon themselves
Open into blackness
Void rips into void
Spread across the bleak
Chasm of the indwelling
Seared and threshed
Melted into consciousness

Negation
Of time
Reversal
Of matter

Luminous web of bones
Sing chorus of catastrophe
Woe within the once serene
Dimensional singularity
