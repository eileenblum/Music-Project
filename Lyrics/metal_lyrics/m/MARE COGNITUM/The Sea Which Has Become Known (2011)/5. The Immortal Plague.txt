Enraged by desecration
I wake from my eternal sleep
Vowing death upon these aggressors
Vengeance shall be my reward

Incinerate
Sublimate

Upon the wind I ride
To boil the earth in blood
I crave suffering
To rebuke the living

These abhorrent worms
Lie on beds of filth
Hide their shame from themselves
Wish death upon their own

I bathe myself in blood
I revel in their death
I devote myself to
slaughter

Incinerate
Sublimate

Upon the wind I ride
To boil the earth in blood
I crave suffering
To rebuke the living

I become one with death
I thrive on anguish of the living
Come, worship at my shrine
For here, I am the one true god

I am Hades
I am Thanatos
I am Azrael
I am Lucifer

Upon the wind I ride
To boil the earth in blood
I crave suffering
To rebuke the living

And it shall come to pass
That when all life has ceased
All shall be resurrected
So destruction may begin again

I bathe myself in blood
I revel in their death
I devote myself to
Slaughter

And now I reign supreme
All life has been erased
I return to my sleep
To awake in the day ofâ¦
