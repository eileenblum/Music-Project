Sight begins in simple forms 
Receiving light, benign in its many shades 
Warming the lifeless rifts of void 
Within the cracks of a desolate world 

Nothing can be questioned 
And nothing can be seen 
Corruption festers from within 
Blinding with the warmest light 

Ignorantly striving higher 
Higher to the serpent sun 
Corrosive plagues afflicting further 
Ruminate the deluge of sin 

Nothing can be questioned 
And nothing can be seen 
Corruption festers from within 
Blinding with the warmest light 

Lumination 
Revealing rifts corroding in the deep 
Constellations 
Burying the withered aeons of the past 

Lumination 
Revealing rifts corroding in the deep 
Constellations 
Burying the withered aeons of the past 

Lingering within the shadows 
Obscured beyond the vibrant lights 
Beacons of inherent truth 
Veiling themselves in our pride 

Are they peering deep within us? 
Have they known us long before 
While they aim to blind us 
We do not turn away 

Our deepest terrors are revealed 
Strewn across the radiant sky 
As we wither in the shadows 
Eclipsing all the selves we have created 

Are they peering deep within us? 
Have they known us long before 
While they aim to blind us 
We do not turn away 

Lumination 
Revealing rifts corroding in the deep 
Constellations 
Burying the withered aeons of the past 

Lumination 
Revealing rifts corroding in the deep 
Constellations 
Burying the withered aeons of the past 

To have traveled so far 
Only to be left in blindness, wandering alone 
Witnessing the crucifixion of the self 
Leaves nothing to be sought on these worlds 

Yet as heads are hung in mourning for the end 
Open hands descend in offering 

An understanding of the utmost consciousness 
Revealing paths into future realms 

To have traveled so far 
Only to be left in blindness, wandering alone 
Is not enough to conquer the soul 
It is a beginning
