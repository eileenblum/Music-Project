Demiurge 
Cultivate 
Sealed doorways 
Into flesh 

Imbue them 
With the curse 
Of Time 
Eternity 

Replicated convergence 
Mass-created entropy 
Occultated consciousness 
Eclipsing transmigration 

Epochs screaming into void 
Orbiting in time-vessels 
Indifference withered by parasites 
Petrify their luminous veins 

Reincarnation 
Of spectral pasts 
Shaped by their former selves 
Haunted by their death 

Pathways 
Bittered with 
Sinew from 
Dead stars 

Wandering 
Endlessly 
Encased 
In flesh 

Replicated convergence 
Mass-created entropy 
Occultated consciousness 
Eclipsing transmigration 

Epochs screaming into void 
Orbiting in time-vessels 
Indifference withered by parasites 
Petrify their luminous veins 

Pathways 
Bittered with 
Sinew from 
Dead stars 

Wandering 
Endlessly 
Encased 
In flesh 

Lapsing into itself 
Ravaged by the crumbling void 

Surging outwards, dwarfed by nothingness 

A grand upheaval 
Binary spheres of swirling time 
Traject into binding unity 

Behold the consummation 
Bleeding from its aetherous wounds 
Rising up as a vapor 
The breath of surging death 

Lapsing into itself 
Ravaged by the crumbling void 

Reduced to a brittle shell 
Belabored, it cries and returns to dust 

Behold the consummation 
Bleeding from its aetherous wounds 
Rising up as a vapor 
The breath of surging death 

Lapsing into itself 
Ravaged by the crumbling void 

White as ash it falls before 
The vacant eyes of eternity 

Spiraling into brilliant shrines 
Threads that reach to the darkest depths 

Grasping deep into the dark 
Planting the seeds of future worlds 

Aphotic seeds procreate 
Multitudes in multitudes 

Flashing moments of past perceptions 
Harrowing visions of the all-mind 

Lapsing into itself 
Ravaged by the crumbling void 

White as ash it falls before 
The vacant eyes of eternity 

Behold the consummation 
Bleeding from its aetherous wounds 
Rising up as a vapor 
The breath of surging death
