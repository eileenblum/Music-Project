Prostrate we fall before the grand transfiguration 
Senses dull into a kaleidoscopic labyrinth 
Into a trancelike state we rise before the eidolon 
Self-permutation into the purest divine 

Observing creation through multitudinous eyes 
Creating a sphere of concentrated perception 
Witnessing time as it crumbles into dust 
Impulsively formed into structures anew 

The incessant void rests in open palms 
A canvas on which to create and destroy 
Catalyzing time and space as energy 
The hands clasp the shards of nothingness 

Constructing the pillars of life 
Sculpted with fragments of time 
Written on parchments of sky 
Revealing the poetry of the gods 

Between congruent representations of time 
Exists a gap of complex irreverent forms 
An anarchy of the body and the senses 
Lying between the absurd and the sublime 

A disregard for the logic of the sentient 
Action defined by the absence of provocation 
Defining the will of those within its confines 
Through the decomposition of purpose and desire 

A pure creation 
Lucid and unfettered 
Bearing the aether wind 
Lifted into glorious 

Chaos 

The splendor beheld here has no end 
The splendor beheld here has no end 
The splendor beheld here has no end 
The splendor beheld here has no end
