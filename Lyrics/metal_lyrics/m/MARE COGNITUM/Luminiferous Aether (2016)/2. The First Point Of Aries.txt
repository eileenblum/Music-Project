Rising in the east 
Magnificent fluorescence 
Scorching the infinite 
Unbound depths of sky 

Forging an endless 
Path once thought 
To be sacred 

Looming between 
In formless rays 
Transforming them 
Searing blackened rays 
Windows to another world 

Beacons of light communing with stars 
Shatter their binding chains 

Searing blackened rays 
Windows to another world 

Echoes of those communing with the stars 
Dispersing life beyond the sky 

Deep outside the reaches of time 
Stillness pierced by spectral screams 
Nomadic storms of numb reclusion 

Colossal effigies of swirling light 
Desolate gales of souls 

Pushed to the deepest reaches of eternity 

The first point of Aries 
The first point of Aries 

A moment of bliss 
An inexorable calm 
In fire that burned 
For thousands of year 

Revealed within 
A peak that was insurmountable 

The mirror is found 
And reflects the soul 
To only be shattered 

Searing blackened rays 
Windows to another world 

Beacons of light communing with stars 
Shatter their binding chains 

Searing blackened rays 
Windows to another world 

Echoes of those communing with the stars 
Dispersing life beyond the sky 

Deep outside the reaches of time 
The mirror eclipses the darkest void 

A final glimpse of the 
Divine 

Behold the reflections 
A mirrored evolution 
Echoing communion of thought 
Towering above in glory
