Behold the light 
Weaving between worlds 
Weight carried deep 

Wakes forging 
Rifts of void 

Flooding brilliance in waves of gold 
Building roots beneath worlds 
Constellating into translucent veins 
Flowing with aetherous clouds 

Crest the lunar dawn 
In consummate inversion 

Desiring to fill, and be filled forever 
Lifting the veil in blindness 

Behold the light weaving between worlds 
Binding together the imiscible fragments of creation 

Constellating into translucent veins 
Flowing with aetherous clouds 

Crest the lunar dawn
