Beneath the golden canvas of dawn

A monolith of stone to sacred wisdom forged within the unknown

Here remains a dying flame
These solemn watchers groan beneath the pines

Imbibe the storm
Inhale the ashes

They will drown in fire
Let it also consume you
Glean the ashen cinders
Of these wretched bones

Cast them into the water
Let the wind embrace their memory

An abscess to be dissected
Destroyed and forgotten

Sepulchral augury of annihilation
Divine omens of transcendent destruction
The blackened gods of old descend to their final resting place

They will drown in fire
Let it also consume you
Glean the ashen cinders
Of these wretched bones

Imbibe the storm
Inhale the ashes
