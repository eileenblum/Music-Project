Oh sleeping creation
Hide behind curtains of stars
Drown your lifeless form
In this screaming sea

Leaving the arms of time
To dream

I am born a lidless eye
A mirror, a thousand suns
A disfigured illusion
Of frivolous wonder

Leaving the arms of time
To dream of creation

To weave
The sky

To mold
The earth

Void shaping void
Into infinite forms
To govern its will
To create the sublime

Light shaping light
Into infinite void
To destine its form
To create its own will

Oh sleeping creation
Hide behind curtains of stars
Drown your lifeless form
In this screaming sea
I am born a lidless eye
A mirror, a thousand suns
A disfigured illusion
Of frivolous wonder

Soon shall this light fade
And nourish the stars
To plant the dark suns
Of future creation
