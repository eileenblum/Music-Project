Burn, star of silence
Cast your gaze forth
Rear your somber head
Devour all creation

Enduring within
The corners of time
Freely wander throughout
The sightless existence

Swarmed by loss
Memory torn
Between confusion
And endless scorn

Entropic horizon
Devour space-time

Burn, star of silence
Cast your gaze forth
Rear your somber head
Devour all creation
