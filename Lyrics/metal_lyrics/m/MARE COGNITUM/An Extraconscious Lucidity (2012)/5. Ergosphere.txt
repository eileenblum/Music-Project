Loathsome
Wrathful
Almighty
Overlord

This place
Devours life

Never moving
Never changing

Son of Suffering
Father of torment
Mother of Pain
Goddess of Shadow

A lifeless plane of stretching boundless infinite sadness
Bleeding death from luminous wounds
A gash in the void of barren darkness
Destitute corruption, destiny of life

I marvel at the vastness of the endless void
Eternal spirits of beings lost in time
Confusion, trapped in the sphere of space
No more alive than I

Bastardized
Desolate
Sorrowful
Holocaust
