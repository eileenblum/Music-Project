A vessel is born
The wailing of cosmic release

A severance of blight
Above atrophied tongues

Forced into itself
Upon stygian wings

Through visionless wander
Rife with mesmeric whisper

Blighted by abscess
An intricate labyrinth of serpentine shrines

The seed of reason
Swept up amongst the somber casting of stones

A vessel is born
The wailing of cosmic release

A screaming, writhing form
Bearing legions of boils
Flesh wrought with lesions
Crawls from ebony void

Collapsing to essence
Within itself, nothing
Persists through nonbeing
To twisted dimensions

Ashen it comes, before the thrones of eyes,
Delivered from epochs of pierced thought,
Freed from perpetual abyss,
Longing for calamitous silence.
Through embryonic doorways,
Grow crystallized memory.
While within these wombs,
Dwell hosts of universes
