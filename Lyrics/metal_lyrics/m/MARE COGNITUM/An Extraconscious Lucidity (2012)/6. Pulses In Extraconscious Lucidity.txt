Everlasting fire
Ruin like none have ever seen
Crystals wrought from flesh
Shimmering in loss
forever this augur
Shall herald a time
Where thoughts turn to dust
from eons of famine

If the sky could speak
And hear the earth
And mend the stars

Behold, the scars
Of reborn paradox
Collapse of vision
An extraconscious lucidity
Ultra-luminous
In all its majesty
Oscillate within
A verduous mire

If the sky could speak
And hear the earth
And mend the stars

My eyes ablaze
Above the sea

To drink the brilliance
Of this display

I clutch my grieving breath
and whisper my end

I clutch my grieving breath
and whisper my end
Â
