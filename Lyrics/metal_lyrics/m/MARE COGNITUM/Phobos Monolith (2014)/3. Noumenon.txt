A brilliant scarlet dawn has conquered the night
In elegant mystery it swallows the sky

Crudely blemishing the ivory clouds
Encasing daylight in savage grandeur

This aurora fills my lungs and takes me to another time
Into the memory of a dream never dreamed

Senses blurred into a mesh of cacophonic disarray
Free of mind, I am a crashing wave

Into the passing of time I become
The birth of aeons passes through me

Heliotropic manifestations
Omnipresent revelations

All that was and ever will be
Congeals into singularity

Before me the tide rises
Drowning the life unlived
And in one moment
The waves wash into light

At once I return to a place of rest
My flooded memory recoils in awe

It finds deceit in its own perception
An experience lost on human senses

Crumbled remnants of these visions
Pieced together in shameful bewilderment

They remain stained forever grey
A final monument to the failures of man

Into the passing of time I become
The birth of aeons passes through me

Heliotropic manifestations
Omnipresent revelations

All that was and ever will be
Congeals into singularity

I leave them at the shores
And so too my body

Unburdened by the shackles of reality
Immanent within all existences

Reborn into infant suns
And formless planets of endless day

A nameless form hanging between dimensions
A mind needs not hold the words any longer

Before me the tide rises
Drowning the life unlived
And in one moment
The waves wash into light
