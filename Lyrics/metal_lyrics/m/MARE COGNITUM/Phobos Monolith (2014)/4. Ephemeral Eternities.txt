Multidimensional storm
Disturbing galactic balance
Primordial coalescence
Fusion of primal essence

Hypnotic dirge molds
Shapeless malformation
Amorphous amalgamation
Tempest of infinite scale

A new dawn forms
Reciprocal beginnings
Necromantic screams
Calamitous rebirth
Multicosmic disarray
Despondent conceptions
Bastard sons begotten of
Malevolent masters

Contorted visages
Twisted and warped
Clinging for shelter
In shallow tombs
Forlorn children
With outstretched hands
Clutch the remains
Of a corroded temple

Fractal galaxies emerge from the void
Glorious spiraling cipher
Kaleidoscopic omnipresence

Forging the sands of time
Into wretched worlds
A glorious futility

Extinction

Stretching beyond all time
Multidimensional genocide

Reflections

Of infinite parallel lives
A hall of blackened mirrors

Begin upheaval
Promise malignant
Vow silence
Breathe visions
Fading suns
Primal moons
Fears breed
Ends eternal

The dawn sleeps
A radiant calm
Serpentine dimensions
Interspersing light

Now draped
In bloodied robes
And surrendering
Their scarred veins

Denied existence
By timeâs gaze
Trembling within
The purest darkness

Awaiting exile
To forgotten wastelands
A glorious suffering
A miserable solace

Fractal galaxies emerge from the void
Glorious spiraling cipher
Kaleidoscopic omnipresence

Forging the sands of time
Into wretched worlds
A glorious futility

Extinction

Stretching beyond all time
Multidimensional genocide

Reflections

Of infinite parallel lives
A hall of blackened mirrors

Countless ghostly manifestations crawl beneath the void
Doomed to wander the endless seas of ethereal murk
Ensnared within the incessant cycle of eternal birth
Led deeper by the hollow stream of eternity

This dying soul foretold in ancient prophecy, a ruined monolith to the hopes of nature, collapses under the weight of its own breath, its last gasps blaring into a sickening cry

A senseless loss
