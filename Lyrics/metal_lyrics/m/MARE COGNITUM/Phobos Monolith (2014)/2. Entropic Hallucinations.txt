Rise
Bear witness to the astral chaos
Echoing within your once-sacred halls

Heat embracing
Endless horizon
Light, a curse
In ailing landscapes

Not unlike a bleeding wound
A festered scab wrought with disease

Sky agape
Miasmic windows
Whispered though
Obscure dimensions

A landscape withering in the clutch of an arthritic pale grasp

Tremorous hands grasping for
Once-held brilliant suns of endless luster
Now an ailing mass of blight
Repugnant in their hideous forms

Carrying a blinding plague
To unleash upon barren earth
Futility in endless struggle
Driven by unconscious reason

An incredible weight such as this
Is a planet drifting in empty space
Devoid of kindling and ash
The plague is never born

And yet it scours the landscape
With unspoken splendor
Anxious molding of the clay
Into the image of Sisyphus

Heat embracing
Endless horizon
Light, a curse
In ailing landscapes

Not unlike a bleeding wound
A festered scab wrought with disease

Sky agape
Miasmic windows
Whispered though
Obscure dimensions

A landscape withering in the clutch of an arthritic pale grasp
