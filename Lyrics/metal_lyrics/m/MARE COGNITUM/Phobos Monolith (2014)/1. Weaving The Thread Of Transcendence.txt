Descend infinite dream
An unconscious revelation
Light and sibilance blend as one
An eternal mind observes its own birth

Piercing to the core
Boring into nether
An endless reversal of bending time
Swirling neurons into infinite worlds

A skyward gaze is met
With a host of peering eyes whose stoic glares bequeath the moon,
Repeating ever softly verses of alchemic truth
All transfigured into eons

Cascade into brilliant shards
Disperse unto the cosmos
Weaving a single thread
And bringing eternal eclipse

Ascend infinite dream
An unconscious revelation
Light and sibilance blend as one
An eternal mind observes its own death

Time stretches the thread of dreams
And echoes forth into renewal
An unwavering litany of tides
Infinitely, Boundlessly

A skyward gaze is met
With a host of peering eyes whose stoic glares bequeath the moon,
Repeating ever softly verses of alchemic truth
All transfigured into eons

Piercing to the core
Boring into nether
