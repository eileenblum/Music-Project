[performed by Mare Cognitum]A sign beheld 
Of living stone 

Sprawling across the vault of heaven 
An embrace of amorphous clay 

The child thrashes in the formless cradle, offspring of time and dust 
Pangs of the birth which is to come herald the source of life 

Thrusting infinite pressure 
Mass infinite fragments 
Dense solar clusters 
Energy creates beginning 

Unbearable crushing tension 
In turbulent discord 
Bleeding out the newborn 
And reforming the flesh 

The heat of this withdrawal becomes the beating heart 
A host to feed on the gushing wounds 

And thus, the flesh is complete, relieved by the placid storm 
Calmed by the forlorn embrace of its dwindling home 
Rising to rear its young in the warmth of its light 
From the birth, an exhalation, the first breath of a star 

Breathe 
In your 
Life 
And 
Illuminate 
Yourself 

Stellar winds 
Blow 
Until your life 
Ends 

Arise 
Son of Sol 
Nigh is your dawn 
As the night is cold 

Within the sea 
A writhing mass 

Source of knowledge 
Forged in dust 
A chain of sinew 
Stretching forth 

Children of flesh, children of blood, and time 
Awake your dormant minds and claim your rightful heir 

But through 
This 
A loss 
To the self 
And the false 
Sense of light 
A dark 
Perverse 
Mind 

Forgetting the past 
To devour the marrow of all 

A cancer of thought 
Breeds death 
The sons of light 
Stricken and worn 

A cannibalistic being 
Failure of eternity 
Have you not foreseen the cost of this corruption? 
In it, Ouroboros is complete. 

Devour thyself. Devour thyself. 
If you wish that your end 
Gift thyself to the sanguine sphere
