[performed by Mare Cognitum]Citadel of ancient sorrow
Turn your gaze to the void
Twisted amalgamation
Drift into the cosmic sea

Though your halls echo deep
And even ghostly visages begin to decay
Wander still into the night
To seek the province of the stars

Through years of isolation
The torch continues to burn
Brethren guard, seeking solace
Their dreams lying in the shadow of crimson wings
Beholding, in the distance
A sign of immeasurable hope

Commune - in solitude
Ascend - in nothingness
Flourish - in deprivation
And transfigure the wretched tomb

Hold the flame aloft
Into the black abyss

As hope begins to fade
And time loses all meaning
The brethren lie as stone
Watchers of eternal silence
Until upon their eyes
Rests the blazing sign

Commune - in solitude
Ascend - in nothingness
Flourish - in deprivation
And transfigure the wretched tomb

Hold the flame aloft
Into the crimson abyss

Hold the flame aloft
Into the crimson abyss

A horror of horrors awakens
The nebula stirring with malice
Twisting the wandering walls
Into perverse and abhorrent forms

Waves of anti-cosmic energy
Barrage the crumbling walls
And through the gaping wounds
Enters the hideous infestation

The brethren rise to defend their home as it crumbles down before them
Hearkening the sounding of the bell, and rising to its call

Awestruck terror engulfs the torchbearers
Their home has betrayed them, and becomes their tomb
