[performed by Mare Cognitum]A withered garden flourished thorns of shattered bone
And birthed flesh colder than the frigid storm
A pyre of frost and earth embracing the sky
Sealed with the feeble touch of death

Aside the memories of pallid mountains gleaned with flames,
Rest the calloused hands who held aloft the blaze

Though their eyes fade,
And wither in decay
Though the light fades,
The torch ever burns

Torn asunder by mangled stone and steel
And buried deep beneath themselves
Their voice beneath the earth whispers no more
Silenced by dust through gasping breath

Ghastly fingers run like daggers across the skin
To tear asunder fading blood held within

The sound of torrential suffering
Muted by weight of their dead
The tattered skin writhes no more
A husk of eternal sleep

Though their eyes fade,
And wither in decay
Though the light fades,
The torch ever burns
