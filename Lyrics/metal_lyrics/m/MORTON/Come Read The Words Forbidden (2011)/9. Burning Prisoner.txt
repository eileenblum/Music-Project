He reads the stars
And gives the signs
Predicts the thunder
With vengeful cry
He is the burning prisoner
He is the messenger
Of fate and hatred

The ancient spell
Keeps him alive
The hundred chains
Restrict his flight
Imprisoned, but he'll soon run free
To incarnate the prophecy

For the truth and the light
Prisoner's heart
Carve your path through the stones of restraint
When the silence is cut
Call for the flight
Call the brothers for vengeance and freedom

His brothers died
Through all the land
He must remember
He must defend

Final flight
Blinding light
Burning lungs torn with raging cry
Wings aflame
Crest of life
Our world will die
To live again
Rebirth!
Rebirth!

For the truth and the light
Prisoner's heart
Carve your path through the stones of restraint
When the silence is cut
Call for the flight
Call the brothers for vengeance and freedom
