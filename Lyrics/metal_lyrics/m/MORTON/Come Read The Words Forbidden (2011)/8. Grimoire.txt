I will be travelling all night
Where all the lifelines reunite
Where skies are pale and sun is red

I will remove the ancient dust
Revealing writings of the past
And I will read that we are dead

Among the stones and withered roses
Iâm looking for the trail of those
Who thought that joy would never end

They are not fighting anymore
âCause there is nothing to fight for
And there is nothing to defend

Iâll gather tears of angelsâ songs
From silver strings and poisoned thorns
The bitter wine and Golden Grail 
Youâll drink and thirst will go away

The love Iâve drowned in wishing well
Iâll give away to lord of hell 
And in return I will acquire
The grimoire of your desire
