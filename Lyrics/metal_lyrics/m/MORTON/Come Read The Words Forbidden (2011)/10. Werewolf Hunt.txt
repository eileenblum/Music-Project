Listen! Silent nightâs cut with hungry growl
Beasts are here and theyâve heard the leaderâs call
Listen! It is fear, strangerâs steps around
Pack flies through the dark, shadows hide their run

Look out! Hundred eyes gleaming like the stars
Thousand times theyâve seen how the victim dies
Look out! Hold you chance, vanquish your own fear
Werewolves took your trace, werewolves are near

You almost feel the caress of their jaws
Youâve got your bare hands against teeth and claws
They owe the night. They will rend. They will gnaw.

Know that nightmareâs here, just behind your back
No chance to survive werewolvesâ attack
Know that every step is a deal with fate
Try to save your life while itâs not too late

Is it just a dream? Just awaken!
Try to banish it, try to break it!
You are out of breath, you are hunted
No it canât be death! Itâs a nightmare!

Theyâre hunting you like the hounds hunt the brute
Youâll meet your doom at the end of pursuit
Itâs just the night. Just the moon. Just the woodsâ¦.
