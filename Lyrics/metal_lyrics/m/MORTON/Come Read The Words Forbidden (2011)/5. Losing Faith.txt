He came from lands of death
The soldier of faith
He calls us devil's slaves
He brought us purifying flames

When we are losing our faith
Time for the priest to take care of our race
Once we regain our fear
Demons appear, angels disappear

When we are losing our faith

The wrath of god reins on us
Witchfinder will burn us
It's time for the decision
Beware the inquisition

When we are losing our faith
Time for the priest to take care of our race
Once we regain our fear
Demons appear, angels disappear
Evil is spreading the wings
No one is safe from the pain and grief
Is it the good that he brings
We do not know, we have lost belief

When we are losing our faith
