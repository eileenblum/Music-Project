You must be a man
Of incisive mind
There is a key
You must find
Wait for the ghost
To come on your side
When you are lost
In the night

Keep your word, the child of shades
Bring me back what I possess

The precious weariness of elder's gaze
I still remember all my promises
The birds return back home - the nameless friends
The darkness covers us, we are the shades

Led by the ghost
You steal the key
Unlock the lost
Sanctuary
The brightest of stars
Imprisoned here
Finish your quest
Set it free

Once again the vision falls
Apparition softly calls
Once again
Travel far
Free the shade
Touch the star
