Poisoned rain will fall on our heads
Earth will grind everything we possess
Air and fire will burn our lungs
Evil will destroy our minds

Nature's forces join their powers
Lightning cuts the sky and blinds us
Ancient walls collapse like cyclops
Kneel him when he's calling for the storm

Soon he will step this ground
The realms of life are now the realms of death
Tempest will be unleashed
His evil spell will steal your final breath
Your time has come
Your final prayer
Scream it aloud
Your final prayer
Scream it aloud
Scream it aloud

Poisoned rain will fall on our heads
Earth will grind everything we possess
Blood of men will evaporate
This day will predestine our cruel fate
