You soul is lost forever
Inside this wicked dream
You're dying for the answer
You're pulled by someone's will
The taste of sweet oblivion
The distant eagle's call
Come read the words forbidden
You'll never get back home

Reach for the heavens with your mind
Reach out for wisdom and might

Shivering cold
You're not alone
Carry the sign
Sign of the clan
There in the cold
You are immortal
Reach for the sun
Carry the mark of the eagle

In times of fame and glory
He was the Eagleking
You got to hear his warning
That's hidden deep within
Six hundred years of evil
But he is still around
If you're the true believer
You'll see his blazing sun

Reach for the heavens in your flight
Reach out for wisdom and might

Shivering cold
You're not alone
Carry the sign
Sign of the clan
There in the cold
You are immortal
Reach for the sun
Carry the mark of the eagle

Your soul is lost forever
There's no escape, but still
You're dying for the answer
You're pulled by someone's will
To taste the sweet oblivion
To hear the eagle's call
Come read the words forbidden
You'll never get back home

Reach for the heavens in your flight
Creature of wisdom and might

There in the cold
Mysteries unfold
Give me the sign
Sign of the clan
There in the cold
You are immortal
Reach for the sun
Carry the mark of the eagle
