The shadows suddenly grew long and howling filled their homes
Dead silence came upon the ancient grove
The evilâs here like years ago, Itâs back. It hasnât changed
The Satanâs daughter came to take revenge

The ill fame flew and like the plague â it came to every district
It told of hag with evil ruthless spirit
Her human flesh was burned to dust and clericks struck the bells
But Devil threw her back from burning hell

The victim of the holy fire
She walks the land, her smile is dire
The ashes on her crooked lips
And hellish grip

Once dead, she came again to rise
No one can execute her twice
She canât be drowned, she canât be burned
She canât be stopped in her return

The steel and stone obey the power of unholy runes
She spoils the water and conceals the moon
Collecting lives and freezing heat with the forbidden chants
Sheâs already begun her vengeful hunt

Her retinue of undead souls is throwing out their cry
The rotten madness in the empty eyes
The time is nigh, Your Eminence. God save you from her rage
The Satanâs daughterâs here to take revenge
