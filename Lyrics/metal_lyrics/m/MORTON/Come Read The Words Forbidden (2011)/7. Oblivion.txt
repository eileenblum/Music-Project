Blessed by the blood, raise your red and white banners to sky
Hear the crying steel when the paladins travel far
One and only choice, over conscience â made with pure heart
And among the ways, there is one that leads to the heavenâs gate

Each of us will fight
For eternal light
Will we be forgiven?
When we meet our fate,
Keep the open gate
Shine our thorny way
Straight to the Oblivion

Let the clericks sing while our hammers bring love to our foes
God is watching us, hilt of sword is just another cross
When we pass away, let the myth remain in the depth of time
In the darkest hour keep us in your heart â fighters for the light

We will bring the rest
To the ones who blessed
With the swift salvation
With the Holy Words
We rely on swords
Seeking expiation

Each of us will fight
For eternal light
Will we be forgiven?
When we meet our fate,
Keep the open gate
Paradise or Hell
Os the same Oblivion
