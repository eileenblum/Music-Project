Listen to the wind
Hear the prophecy
I am the Sleeping King
Of the Dynasty
Lay your aching hands
On the tree of light
Will you come with me?
Let your heart decide
It's your legacy

When all your dreams are torn apart
Look for the answer
I am the one who shows the way
Waiting for thousand years of sleep
There is a place for us to hide
Best of the places
When you're prepared, you'll understand
It's time to awake the Sleeping King

The pendulum returns
The gears synchronize
You want to feel my soul
Just look inside my eyes
To summon birds of prey
To rule the raging sea
Will you come with me
It's your legacy

When all your dreams are torn apart
Look for the answer
I am the one who shows the way
Waiting for thousand years of sleep
There is a place for us to hide
Best of the places
When you're prepared, you'll understand
It's time to awake the Sleeping King
