I hear the toll of the bell
The sound of my darkest hour
The time his stopped in my cell
The time is dead in this tower
If I dare to change the sequence
Of the holy words
Will your voice unveil the secret
Will the light return?
Oh, weeping bell

The weeping bell
The herald of darkness
Reflects in the empty insane eyes
Weeping bell
My weakened mind
Beholds the approaching judgement day

Since better days here it hides
The ancient walls - breathless emptiness - wasted lands
I had the saints on my side
Now I'm alone - guilt is on my hands
But this night the bell has called me
Letters spoke to me
Fibers of my mind were torn
You took my sanity
The weeping bell

The weeping bell
The murderous call
The symbol of god who has gone
Weeping bell
The wicked creation
I wait for the chance to destroy
The weeping bell
The cross I must hold
The titan, abandoned by god
Weeping bell
The day when you toll
Will bring damnation to all mankind

I hear the toll of the bell
