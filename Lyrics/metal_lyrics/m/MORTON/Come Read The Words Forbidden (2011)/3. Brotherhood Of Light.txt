Riding, fighting
All as one - United
Freedom's running through our veins

Thunder, lightning
Weapon and the fighter
Brothers will remain forever

Now you are the acolyte
Take a step into the light
Oath of blood won't fade away
Keep it till your dying day.
We're the brotherhood of light
We will never step aside
In this dark forsaken land
We are brothers till the end.

Blades and arrows
Guides of our heroes
Never disobey your sword

See the shadows -
Spirits gather here
Bringing death to our foes
