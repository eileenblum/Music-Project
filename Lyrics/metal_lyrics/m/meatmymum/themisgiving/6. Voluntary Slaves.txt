I won't bow down

Starting my engines and I'm coming in hard
Better seek cover or this will end before it starts
Prepared for the worst but always going for the best
Never sleep, never falter, never ever rest

And I walked these roads (for those I share my heart with)

Of any person in this world who lost their pride I can't imagine you found your way out of this cage
And I can't take another lie

I don't know how the fuck you beared this all the time
A burden beyond all reason - beyond all sanity
Never again, here we are now
This is where you belong
I won't regret a single fucking thing

For all you traitors, for all you cowards: remember who you are - get back up!

Of any person in this world who lost their pride I can't imagine you found your way out of this cage

(Don't waste my fucking) time

I was trying to pull you out of this sump of recklessness and you didn't even listen
You know, screaming wass not that easy with your mouth full of dependance
You broke your leash
It's time to overcome

And once again another heart was bended by the hands of examination

Freedom becomes a never spoken word here in this prison you call your life

I won't bow down
