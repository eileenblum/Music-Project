[feat. Dennis Fries]I'm back again with my heart full of hate
On the street with a call to the deep
I'm the monster that hides in your closet
The creature that you fear
Yet I'm not satisfied

Kneel down before me and pray for forgiveness

Ruthless and dangerous, no one will stop me

I wonder if there is a place to hide for me when all my chances come to die in my darkest fears
As long as chaos seems to rule this world of greed
I'm on my knees - cannot believe
Counting the hours to my definite destiny
Somewhere around this path lies my reality
For all you devils in my happiest fantasy
Freedom lies far beneath

My secret is lying - my sanction unconcealed
Get out of my way or you will end as one of these
For I am a traitor to my fellowmen indeed
I'll carry on

LOOK AT YOURSELF

(This is fear) - let me give you a showing of it

Time passes by as we carry on to go
But future ain't in sight - no light to shine so bright
And freedom lies so far beneath

I wonder if there is a place to hide for me when all my chances come to die in my darkest fears
As long as chaos seems to rule this world of greed
I'm on my knees - cannot believe
Counting the hours to my definite destiny
Somewhere around this path lies my reality
For all you devils in my happiest fantasy
Someday I will be free

Revealed
