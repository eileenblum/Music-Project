[feat. John Galloway]Fake - I can't believe what you've done
All the things I have been through you don't notice them, they mean
nothing to you
Now close your eyes and embrace the pain I will bring over you
I am death and I am pain let me predict you'll cry
For I'll defile your body in this war
(You selfish) whore

I wouldn't mind if you were a stranger but you called yourself my friend the whole time
I wouldn't mind if you were a stranger but you called yourself my friend so fuck you

And I can't take this shit anymore
And I won't blame myself anymore for you

Lies and hypocrisy
Found on the floor soaked in blood
With a deep hole in your head
I hope your soul will stay restless
(You will regret to be born)
Now you're the slave and I'm the master
Serve me or you'll be gone

You will live to rue this
I can't stand your absurditys anymore
For years I've been chasing after a sense now it's all up to you

CRY OUT IN PAIN BITCH

It's all up to you

Feel my hate
My hands around your throat
Take this blade
To your chest and bleed out

Oh what a sweet sensation of satisfaction
I won't regret this murder - it feels so right
The only thing you were good for was sewing your blood all over my walls

... and painting them red
