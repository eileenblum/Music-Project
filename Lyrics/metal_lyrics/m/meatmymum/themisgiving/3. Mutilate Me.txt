No
Don't break me down
Don't break me down again

No
Don't take my breath
Don't you take my heart again

I might have been foolish and I might have been stupid
But I know this can't be right
All I've ever known - the things you got me used to
They have all disappeared in this swamp of pity

Taken down to nothing
No hope, no sunset

With no regards to what I've said you keep on pushing the boundaries to higher levels I can't follow, I cannott understand
The way you choose, the line you walk it went too hard for me
I am too slow, please wait for me, why does it keep going on like this?

Buried under a thousand roses that were meant to be given you in love
And letters that were meant to make you smile now burn in the fire of my hate
Get away from me, the way you look at me, it makes me sick
All I ever dreamed of was a place in paradise right next to you
My dream will stay a shadow, it died before we had a chance

Bring me down to the ground just once again
I'm begging
Give me the sorrow I hate, the hurt I love

I never wanted to say:
Fuck you, you stupid whore
I hate you with all my heart
Why use complex language when the things you did to me are not worth a scar on my hand
You left me alone in my darkest hour
I hope you die
