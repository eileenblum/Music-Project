With my heart wide open I still can't find any reason why
Thus martyrs revelations won't any last any longer - this is the end of time
This mentioned time just rips my soul, my will is tattered and thrown away
But still I'm living, still I'm struggling, I won't be leaded astray

The beginning of something bigger than this no one could have ever predicted
I know I'm not alone and I know (this is my home)
Choices so hard to chose they crush my brain just like a lie cuts through relatedness
Prevent the cold, there are some things higher than the beholders eye can see

Shattered dreams in a box underneath the veil
Forever wonder if this is real, clawing away the pieces
Dividing us all - one at a time
There is a sorrow behind all of our future decisions and I feel blind

Don't you even dare to question all this temptation
Life is a path and antagonists throw obstacles right in front of us
Trying to avoid all this pain, many people just attract it even more

What's left of this world?
I'm sick and tired of you all

Kill my inner sins
Scratch them off my skin
Kill my inner sins
Before the end begins
Kill my inner sins
Scratch them off my skin
Kill my inner sins
To wipe off their grins

We are not born to suffer and cry out in anguish
We are the ones to stand still and fight back

Oppressed my inspiration 'til the point of entire damnation
Just on probation, this bitter creation
Through the eyes of a sleepwalker and eyes shut wide open
Buried in the sky, killed my doubtlessness with kindness
Probity becomes my demise - no clouds to catch me if I fall

Kill my inner sins
Scratch them off my skin
Kill my inner sins
Before the end begins
Kill my inner sins
Scratch them off my skin
Kill my inner sins
To wipe off their grins
