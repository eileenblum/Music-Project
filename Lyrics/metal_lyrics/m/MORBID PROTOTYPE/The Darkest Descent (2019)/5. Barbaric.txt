We land upon your shores
To kill you all and take all your gold
Your Christian God can't save you now
We smile as you die

We are the barbarians
We bring death upon your land
We are the barbarians
We retreat not, we conquer

We are the conquerors
The only thing you need to fear
We stand tall and bold before you now
To see you die

We are the barbarians
We bring death upon your land
We are the barbarians
We retreat not, we conquer

You can run but you cannot hide
We'll track you down and take your life
For glory and gold we'll rape your land
It doesn't matter where you stand

We are the barbarians
We bring death upon your land
We are the barbarians
We retreat not, we conquer
