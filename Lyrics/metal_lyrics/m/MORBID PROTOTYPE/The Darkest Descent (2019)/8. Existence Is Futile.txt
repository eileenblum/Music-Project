Chaos is the only way to gain control of humanity
No more games, it's time to execute the plan - Eradication

People are expendable, worth no more than fleas
We are power absolute, you will fall to your knees

Into the void you will die
Violent sentence you must serve
Regardless of what you deserved
Your existence is futile - Die!

History repeats itself - We live, we die in madness
Surrender your life for it's always been worthless

People are expendable, worth no more than fleas
We are power absolute, you will fall to your knees

Into the void you will die
Violent sentence you must serve
Regardless of what you deserved
Your existence is futile

[solo: Wax Lamontagne]

People are expendable, worth no more than fleas
We are power absolute, you will fall to your knees

Into the void you will die
Violent sentence you must serve
Regardless of what you deserved
Your existence is futile - Die!
