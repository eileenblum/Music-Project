The smell of acrid fumes bringing sudden death
A mean to kill the masses
The path of war never ending
With money on the line, they won't ever care

Thousands will fall under fire
The unrelenting pain - your bloodline fallen
Suffering and destruction all around you
You start to feel your brain boiling - death is coming!

Faces melting under the smoke
Your skin peeling - unbearable pain
Screaming for help, this is in vain
You can't escape, to death you'll choke
