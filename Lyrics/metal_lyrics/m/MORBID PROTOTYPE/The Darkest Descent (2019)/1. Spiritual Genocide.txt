Arise, sons of the sun
The time has come for you to become one
The path of nature calls
A perfect circle, to link us all
Now disturbed by...

The people of deceit
Bringing cursed prophecies

Fight and die
Die above the sacred grounds

It's a spiritual genocide, we feed upon the flames
The white man cometh, to bring us death
It's a spiritual genocide, we feed upon your soul
It's a spiritual genocide!

Behold, sons of the sun
The time has come for you to become one
Mitakuye Oyasin - we're all related
As our ancestors are now disturbed by...

The people of deceit
Who brought false prophecies

Fight and die
For all who have died are equal

It's a spiritual genocide, we feed upon the flames
The white man cometh, to bring us death
It's a spiritual genocide, we feed upon your soul
It's a spiritual genocide!

[solo: Mathieu Marcotte, Patrick Loisel]

It's a spiritual genocide, we feed upon the flames
The white man cometh, to bring us death
It's a spiritual genocide, we feed upon your soul
It's a spiritual genocide!
