An insurgence of violence - Is coming our way
Large-scale wave of destruction - Pray for your souls
Hope is lost and gone - Only pain and disarray
Imminent death and pestilence - You can dig your hole

It's time, the cataclysm is charging its way through
This time the cataclysm is nowhere near done with you

Death strikes before our eyes
And by millions we'll die - Our sins paid in blood
Here comes the fire and the pain
Like cattle astray, frozen in time - The final sacrifice

It's time, the cataclysm is charging its way through
This time the cataclysm is nowhere near done with you

[solo: David GagnÃ©]

Resurrection never coming - Mankind in agony
The trumpets call - The sinners in rapture
Of four dreaded horses black - The judgement portends
The end is unleashed - A mean to wipe humanity

It's time, the cataclysm is charging its way through
This time the cataclysm is nowhere near done with you
It's time, the cataclysm has managed its way through
This time the cataclysm is finally done with you
