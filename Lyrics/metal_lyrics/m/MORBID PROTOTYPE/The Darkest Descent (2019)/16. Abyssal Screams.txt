In the darkest depths, the monster awakens
You fear its name, you can't comprehend

Screams from the abyss, the shivers down your spine
It's the call of Cthulhu

In the midst of black seas of infinity
A dread ritual in his stone vault

Screams from the abyss, the shivers down your spine
It's the call of Cthulhu

[solo: Branislav Panic]

Screams from the abyss, the shivers down your spine
It's the call of Cthulhu
