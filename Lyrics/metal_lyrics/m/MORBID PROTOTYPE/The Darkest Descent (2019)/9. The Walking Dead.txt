Blood is the way of life
Leading the horde to the feast
No escape, take a look around you
Scream while you can, there's no escape

They need to feed - They want to eat

By thousands they come
By thousands they roam
No hope, no soul, no life
Death will come and guts they crave

They need to feed - They want to eat

Stripping your flesh from the bones
Teeth piercing, feel it burning
You want to leave but it's too late
Soon you too will meet your fate

Feed - Eat - Feed - Eat

Sordid screams ripping the night
Hordes feeding on your inside out
You feel your life is fading
A new walking dead is coming

They need to feed - They want to eat
