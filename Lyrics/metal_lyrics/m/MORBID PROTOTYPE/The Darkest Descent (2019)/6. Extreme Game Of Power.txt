A secret lost in time, the bloodline of the wealth
Playing games and getting ready to unleash the fire

From the shadows, a society made of money
Controlling and watching your every move
From the top of the world, everything is not enough
We're all just pawns for the kings above

At last, it's time to break the silent circle
Unveil the mask of betrayal - The cradle of sin
The sinners, liars, schemers and killers
Fighting for control - It's an extreme game of power

Thousand wars for millennia, the elite machine
The perfect plan to divide and conquer
An elaborated scene from the world's theater
No matter the cost, it's their show on the silver screen

At last, it's time to break the silent circle
Unveil the mask of betrayal - The cradle of sin
The sinners, liars, schemers and killers
Fighting for control - It's an extreme game of power

[solo: Charles B. Pilotte]

From the shadows, a society will devour
Every single one of you
From the top of the world, everything is theirs for grab
We're all just pawns for the gods above

At last, it's time to break the silent circle
Unveil the mask of betrayal - The cradle of sin
The sinners, liars, schemers and killers
Fighting for control - It's an extreme game of power
