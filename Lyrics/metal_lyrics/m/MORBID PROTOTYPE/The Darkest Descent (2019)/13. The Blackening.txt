Feel the pain - Burn the steel, no time to heal
Kill in vain - Look at the sun, nowhere to run
No more hope - Your time has come
Beg for the rope - Sweet taste of death

Scream for vengeance
Endure your sentence

Free yourself - The blood is running to your brain
Close your eyes - See the light that fades away
Let it go - Leave your suffering behind
Hang from the rope - Bitter taste of death

Scream for vengeance
Endure your sentence

After all you've done - There's no turning back
Now the pain is gone - All is turning black

Death is the easy way out - The afterlife won't be coming
After all, the path of the wicked will always end in suffering

[solo: StÃ©phane Filion]
