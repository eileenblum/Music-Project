Insanity - The word that's creeping in
A designation shaking the core of your soul
The more you fail the more you know
Right now, my mind is on the run

Madness - The only way out
They are so clear, the visions of death
Understand, I am above you all
Praise my name, the darkness cometh

Insanity - Forever free

Inside my head the blood is boiling
The pain is real - The vice of killing

The calm before the storm
Enter the eye of the cyclone

Delirium - Bending reality
Chemical reactions, leading chains of actions
My darkest path unravels before me
Open the gates of the mind - Memories entwined

Hysteria - You cannot hold me down
The chains are broken, I am coming for you
Through the halls of sanity I lurk
Inside your dreams I can hear you scream

Insanity - Forever free

Inside my head the blood is boiling
The pain is real - The vice of killing

The calm before the storm
Enter the eye of the cyclone

[solo: Death Paul Arnold]

Oculus - I can see through your fears
Procellae - Storms of black awaken
Oculus - The vultures are watching
Procellae - The storms of death are coming

Paranoia - The fear of what's not real
Imagination making shapes appear
Shivers down your spine, you think there's someone there
Don't look back, you can't be sure

Phobia - Irrational fear
Cold sweat running down your face
Watch out! The boogieman is here
Slitting your throat as I watch you die

Insanity - Forever free

Inside my head the blood is boiling
The pain is real - The vice of killing

The calm before the storm
Enter the eye of the cyclone

Oculus - The vultures are watching
Procellae - The storms of death are coming
