From foreign lands, the dragon's head show up from the mist
The wind is rising, so is the piercing cold
Feeling the waves - A sensation of freedom
The thrill of the sea, where we belong

To every land we'll sail
We're the kings of land and sea
It will all be ours!

The gods are on our side
It's all part of the plan
We fight, we die

We are born to fight, we live to sail
It's all in the plans of the almighty gods
We are the hammer, we are the thunder
We are the fists and swords

To every land we'll sail
We're the kings of land and sea
It will all be ours!

The gods are on our side
It's all part of the plan
We fight, we die

Heading west to unknown shores
In the quest of gold and glory
With honor we ride as heathen hordes
We'll reach Valhalla for it's our destiny

[solo: Danny Mc Gregor]

We may not live another day, my brothers
We'll have a place in the realm of the gods
Fight to your last breath no matter the odds
Smile as you die, it's the greatest honor

To every land we'll sail
We're the kings of land and sea
It will all be ours!

The gods are on our side
It's all part of the plan
We fight, we die

Heading west to unknown shores
In the quest of gold and glory
With honor we ride as heathen hordes
We'll reach Valhalla for it's our destiny
