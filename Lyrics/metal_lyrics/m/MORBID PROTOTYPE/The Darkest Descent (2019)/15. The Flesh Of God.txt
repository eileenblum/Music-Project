(You will feel the fire)
Flawless, painless, worldwide spread disease
(You will feel the failure)
Satan is here, suffering is near
(You will feel the fire)
Millions shall fall to feed the cursed halls
(You will feel the failure)
Surrender your soul to the devil's control

Satan, Morning Star, in time will come to me
I praise thy name in pain without morality
Lucifer, Deceiver, my blood you shall receive
I bow to you name and in your plan I shall believe

False idol in the name of greed and power
A mean to control the weak since time immemorial

Ripping the flesh from the bones of God
Feeding it to the tellers of lies
Stabbing through the heart of treachery
They all shall fall off their rotten thrones

Beelzebub, the chaos you bring shall make us see
Through lies of false prophets of absurd divinity
Mephistopheles, hater of light
Reach to me and in darkness, liberate me

False idol in the name of greed and power
A mean to control the weak since time immemorial

Ripping the flesh from the bones of God
Feeding it to the tellers of lies
Stabbing through the heart of treachery
They all shall fall off their rotten thrones
