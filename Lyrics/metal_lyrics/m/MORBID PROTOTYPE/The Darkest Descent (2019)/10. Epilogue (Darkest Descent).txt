After the hunt I come back to the tribe - A long journey far from home
Upon arrival I can see all the bodies of my brothers laying all around
I fall to my knees, holding my head in agony
Don't worry from the afterlife my brothers, your death will be avenged

And when the sunshine is falling
There comes the final warning
And when the sunshine is falling down
You hear the final warning

[solo: Michael J. Bernardino]

Arrows and guns on the ground everywhere - I pick a rifle and follow the trace
I have been born for this - It's my time to rise
A descent into darkness - They must all pay
One by one they fall to the ground, I am the last man standing

And when the sunshine is falling
There comes the final warning
And when the sunshine is falling down
You hear the final warning
