The mouth of deception, forgery of speech
Thousand words of trickery, the wicked twisted leech
She breeds evil from her lips, madness in her eyes
A trap made of her hips, entwined in her lies

Queen of Vipers, ruler of Serpents
Forked tongue of spreaded lies
The master of deceit, a Jezebel in disguise
Her making of servants

Reptilian Queen - Reptilian Queen
She's the one who drops the guillotine
The reptilian queen

[solo: MichaÃ«l Beaudoin]

Queen of Vipers, ruler of Serpents
Forked tongue of spreaded lies
The master of deceit, a Jezebel in disguise
Her making of servants

Reptilian Queen - Reptilian Queen
She's the one who drops the guillotine
The reptilian queen
