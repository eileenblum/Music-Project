Show me the visions of darkness to come
Suffering will plague our sacred lands
The balance of nature is on the brink of destruction
The people of the sea bringing pain and chaos

For ages we lived in harmony with all life
The elders passing through their knowledge for generations
We will resist until we die, we will survive
You won't invade our home

Spiraling and flickering visions of death
The Great Spirit is on our side
Spiraling darkness insight

You can't understand all we sacrificed

[solo: Christian Donaldson]

Spiraling and flickering visions of death
The Great Spirit is on our side
Spiraling darkness insight
