An abomination from the void
Is it alive or a machine?
An hybrid making you paranoid
A predator bringing pain and ruin

Once you look at it you can't escape
The need of dying gaining over you

Face the morbid prototype
The clouding of life is following its path
This is a morbid prototype
You will all fall by its wrath

A mystery for the naked eye
The darkness of death is everywhere
Blinded by illusion you will die
When you feel its piercing stare

Once you look at it you can't escape
The need of dying rising inside you

Face the morbid prototype
The clouding of life is following its path
This is a morbid prototype
You will all fall by its wrath

[solo: Michael J. Bernardino]

Invisible force of all shapes and forms
It's not alive, nor a machine
Not from this world, can't know where it's from
A predator that brought pain and ruin

Once you looked at it you couldn't escape
The need of dying has taken you

Face the morbid prototype
The clouding of life is following its path
This is a morbid prototype
You will all fall by its wrath

Face the morbid prototype
The clouding of life has followed its path
It was a morbid prototype
We all did fall by its wrath
