Mass of christians, they want to make you believe in their faith
Blood soaks canvas, blood they have spilled for some god to worship
Lies conviction, two millenniums of deceiving besides
From this god - redemption
For this god - despise
In the name of, in the name of what they're forcing - the cross
Filth on christians, the reward for what they hide inside
...Inside...
Robbing souls - only pain
Doomsday...
Breeding the lies from human fears, enslaving the weak under their creed
Rotting belief, disloyal play, hiding the dismay beneath their smiles
The truth is gone and so their worth, their sickness shines upon their gold
Provoking wars, controling minds, reading the bible to wash away their crimes
Awake of the darkness asleep in the light
Dismal past changed to justice
In the darkness your souls lie
From this god - redemption
For this god - despise
Fall of christians, by their own hand they will fall in their hell
