They think they can get me, they think they already caught me
Hahaha... what a concept!
Abducting female subjects, corpses t my sight
Still breathing, unconscious, helpless... helpless!
The one I choose whom I'll break the smile
I packed up my supplies right inside my car
Running against time. Rage to stop
Abducting female subjects, I see their corpses in my mind!
Hate and death inside collide

Run and I run and I run against time... Run and I run and I run...
Before they catch me!
Run and I run and I run against time - they will catch me!
Run and I run and I run...
I'll make no prisoner - not alive!
I can't wait until next victim, franticly researching...
Coast to coast, mile on mile, everywhere I've been they lie...
Like a thrill through my back
Sinister view of insanity
Deviant path unconfined
I still want to play...

Run and I run and I run against time... Run and I run and I run...
They will catch me not alive!
Like a thrill through my back
Sinister view of insanity - two shots
Deviant path unconfined
I still want to play...
A sudden impulse of compassion
I can't kill her, I won't kill her...
Kill her... the one I choose whom I'll break the smile
The one I choose whom I'll break the smile
