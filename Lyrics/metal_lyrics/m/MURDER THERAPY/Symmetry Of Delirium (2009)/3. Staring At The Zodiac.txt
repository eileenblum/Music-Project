I like to hunt human preys
Killing people is my way of life
Because I am bored of what the world is
It is so painful for me to stand here
Much fun in this game
It is more than taking lives
Fun - it is more
Than killing for bore
Wild games I'll play with their bodies
In the forest I'll leave their corpses
Because man doesn't belong to Earth
It's the most insane thought ever birthed
Dangerous game and walk the razor's edge
Of them all will not save no one
To kill is my life

Tell me who you are! I wanna know!
Celebrate idols... celebrate - AND KILL - idols...
Have you found all the slaves you killed?
I passed my whole life in the search of your name
And now that I've found you, I don't even care!
Every single night of my life
I have tried to understand why
Why your impulse couldn't be stopped?
Have you found all the slaves you killed?
...Staring at the zodiac...
