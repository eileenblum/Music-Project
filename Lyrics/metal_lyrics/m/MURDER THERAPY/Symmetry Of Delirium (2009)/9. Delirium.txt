The dawn has come and brought my nightmares away
Lucifer already risen in the sky
Another daylight is soon to feed my anguish off
The same anguish that turned my days into this state of mind
I am not in here
Altered perception - Echoes all around me
Illogical criterion - Of what I was and I'll never be again
Desperation whisper  - Absurd reality
I've heard a voice here in my brain and told me to plead
Pleading to stop them - Sleepless and numb
Rumors don't leave me the voice is yours
Coming to a point of no return, I can't change the desires it has
On the chair in front of me it stands beholding me as I despair
Only it and I in the room my screams become a laughter
I am right in here - Conscious perception
The echo is me - Logic recklessness
Of what I am and forever will...
You can't save me...
Save me...
