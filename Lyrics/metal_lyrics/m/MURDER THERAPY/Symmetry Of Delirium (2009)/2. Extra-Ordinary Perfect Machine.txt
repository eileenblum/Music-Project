Missing the knowledge found out everyday
Charming fate's ending sigh for unhappiness
Missing, charming, finding unobtainable
Asking questions, answers unspeakable
Extraordinary perfect machine / extra-ordinary perfect
Extra-ordinary perfect machine / extraordinary perfect
Missing questions, finding the same answer
Charming, asking, unmerciful decree
New identity same banality ordinary conspiracy
Dying inner self, frustration in the pit of dreams - broken!
Drowning in this sea emotionless
Shouting, crying at this reality
Crawling, claiming surrendered
The shell is shaping into a locked up shell
Begging at the mirror
Questions beg same answers this decree
Answers tell silent falsity
Drowning in this sea, emotionless, I'm going down
Crawling, claiming, surrendered as the days go by
This hollow shell is shaping in

You're just the dissonant sea's reflection concerning the ordinary
Behind this mirror, where unreality in tangible, I'll bind tight to myself
This muddy crown, pertaining to a dethroned king

Already dead in a mother's womb gazing at fate with glassy eyes
Surgical precision in bliss removing inside its jaw into the unvoid
Extraordinary life? / ordinary machine perfect extra
Extra-ordinary perfect machine / extraordinary perfect
Begging at the mirror
