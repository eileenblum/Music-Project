I am Christ!
Nice to eat you, spank me with a spike paddle
Fine, that's the way, I want you to make me feel the pain
Pain! A need to me, it's a primal necessity!
Sins to atone, threading pins in my groin as well
I want to taste the dirty flavour of your excrements...
Insane personality - sexual kind

I like to hurt them
I'm the one who they won't to see in this sinner world
I'm the one who they won't to meet, atonement of sins through pain
Gain their trust to be kind to - once gained to molest them 'til death
May the pain be not so much painful 'til death, 'til death, 'til death
Spank me - cotton soaked in alcohol, I stick it in my anus then set it on fire
Haunted - I'll lull them in death's embrace
On a mission - god ordained me to punish them, I hate them!
'til death, 'til death, 'til death!
I'll send many letters at my victims' families
I want to taste the dirty flavour of their disgust!
I purify my sins through their innocence...
Turn their smiles into cries...
