Daily hate... the process itself
Consequence of evolution cause of desperation
Prepare yourself to the final sentence
Consequence of consequences
Mental pressure meets the doom
Only denial now everlasting backstabs
Smiling and breathing nothingness

It is time for the payoff
The moment is coming
Scourge of human's scourge dreams built onto lies
Drafted by an imposed choice, choice to survive
Nothingness is all you've got and you'll ever have

The moment has come
Dirt-cheap pity, unwilling compassion
House of justice, house of failure
Nothingness is all you've got and you'll ever have
Nothingness is all you've got and you'll ever have
The real intruder is man
