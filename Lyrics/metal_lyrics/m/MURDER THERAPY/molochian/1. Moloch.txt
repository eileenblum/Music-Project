Sharing a dream
Always demands a sacrifice
Itâs your life

Take all of me
Dreamer
Take all of me
Dream on
Take all of me
I wonât regret it

I always demanded something in return
For me giving you something to feed on
And when your wings will be burnt from the flame
You will know you didnât fly in vain

If I granted all you sought after
What else must I burn?
What must I burn for this fire?

Take all of me
Dreamer
Take all of me
Dream on
Take all of me
I wonât regret it

I did this all for you
