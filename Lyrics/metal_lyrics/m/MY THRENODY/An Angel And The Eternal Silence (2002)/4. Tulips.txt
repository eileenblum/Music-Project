..And the night falls once again,
I light the candles...
and as I look out the windows,
the silence and the darkness fill my heart with sorrow.
My body feels, so tired now,
and I hear her voice fading away.. .
the breeze and the cold rain...
and then I could hear a child cry from miles away.
I watch the moon and write about the past,
the tulips in the garden are so sad,
like a lonely bird I watch the night going by,
and I think of when your light would shine so bright,
about the child that once was mine,
and about the flowers that now have died.
