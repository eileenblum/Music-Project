When the darkness fall
We shall become one, flesh and blood
body and souls.
Now and forever we shall live as one
Like roses and thorns
Like sorrow and tears.
And we'll be greater than death
for death wont touch us no more
or tear us apart, beyond love
beyond fear of loss for we are now one.
Beyond all pain
beyond all sorrow
beyond all grief
Now and forever we shall live as one
Like roses and thorns
Like sorrow and tears.
I shall not live again without your smile
and not a day will go by without your touch
without the warmth of your embrace
wont you return and rescue me from the pain.
