[Act I - Absence of your light]

There is a shadow along the river...
its so dark here...
It makes me wonder why was the moon hiding from me?
Was it me? Or was it you?
Who will take the blame for all the wasted time?
And I see tears on the mirror,
I've been far for so long,
it feels like I have been sleeping,
for centuries, sleeping...
and your eyes have died...
in tears your eyes have died. and my eyes have cried...
in tears my eyes have cried.
Your heart became a passage and your soul broke free.
I would choose to keep you here, inside,
but not always the choice is ours to make,
look at me... I'm much more than you can see...
Get closer, feel my lips, and touch my soul,
steal the essence of my flesh,
bring back a piece of what is gone,
of what once was called "life".
Can you answer my questions?
Is not love a word of joy?
So give one reason for my sorrow,
flesh and bones... no longer warm.

[Act II - Painless now]

Far, so far away...
I can hear your voice as you tell me not to cry.
As the sun goes down in this black winter night,
tears were flowing from my sad eyes.
I lay down at the shades of the old times... and remember,
and to remember is to bring back
pieces of pain from the past.
I'm still here... I'm still cry,
but two souls united by the power of passion,
can't be apart by the shadows of death.
And I'll bring you here, inside, wherever I go,
for ever and ever,
until the day when I'll see you again...
