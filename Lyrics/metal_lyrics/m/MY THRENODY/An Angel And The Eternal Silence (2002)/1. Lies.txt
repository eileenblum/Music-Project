... and the night went on,
not a sound or voice,
but the rain and lightning,
that turned the night into day,
and made me wonder where to go,
for a shelter from your lies.
The suffering inside,
that's piercing through my soul,
became so hard to breath now,
and I feel numb from head to toe.
All the distorted lies,
trying to set me into fear,
but I'm stronger than you think,
and I'm ready to break free.
