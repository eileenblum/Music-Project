On your face the fear...
But it's over now my dear Can you feel the breeze?
Warm... Calm... Comforting...
And what once shinned so bright with beauty and suavity
Was now laying still in a humid and dark end.
Such calm in those eyes
Such sweetness in those lips So much pain and misery they have brought into this life of mine
Where I come from there is no god,
There's no mercy and there's no joy
Forsaken land where the good soul is yet to be born...
But still love made its way through the desert
And planted itself into my darkened chest
Love bloomed and for some time it shinned and gave me peace
But as the sand shifted away love drifted... love faded...
But I had no fear, I knew no fear.
But the gloomy day came on my way I saw the sky so dark and full of clouds
Your bloody lips and your star like eyes
The brightening light that was your life the wind put out.
And darkness fell, and at that moment I embraced you again
Helpless I watched you die...
Love had brought me pain!
