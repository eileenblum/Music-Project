Down by the dark river I can still hear a voice that softly sings a melody pure and calm
a melody that soothes me as I drift away on my sleep.
It's another cold rainy day the dark clouds on the even darker sky spills out its freezing tear drops over my head.
The tall and ancient trees cry shaken by the northern winds can be heard throughout the valley for so long we called home.
Once a quiet place filled with mystery and magic...
It's been so long my dearest one, so much has changed...
Yet some things are still the same but the dark ages have taken place in this once joyful heart of mine
It keeps raining all of the time and my days are nothing but walls standing between myself and the day I shall be free as I once was,
I feel the weight of the years on my now frail body and my face now shows the signs of aging.
The nights always bring some hope for a morning that would never come
And now by the dark river a voice sings a different melody
A melody to those without a voice
A sorrowful melody to those who've been embraced by obscurity
A tragic melody of pain and beauty to those who are no longer here
A mournful threnody carrying all of my pain,
taken by the winds to where you sleep
A threnody to you my dearest one.
