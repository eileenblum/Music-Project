And suddenly I don't feel anything anymore
My heart has grown numb Even the tears are cold now
Could it be the absence of your light?
Could it be that the sun has set?
Could it be your eyes that watch me from far away?
Could it be your smile that has faded away?
Show me the being that have been in love and hasn't shed tears
Show me the one who's heart hasn't bled in anguish and discomfort
Show me your eyes.
Show me the path that will take me there
And the keys to unlock the gate
Let me in and comfort me
And I shall break the chains and set you free
And then free I too shall be.
