And so the sun sets...
And so the rain falls...
And I cry on my sleep for I see her face... so real.
But it won't be long now for I shall not see the morning rise. ...
And there is a cold soft breeze that tries to easy my pain
...And when I fall I feel your arms leading me to a safer place
...And we're now one The dark veil of death lies upon us now
And we shall never be apart again.
