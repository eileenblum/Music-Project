Ripping at nightfall through cities of fear,

Watching your every move.
Terrorizing those who live in this land,
Screaming inhabitants in pain.

Penetrating from outside, to deep in your land,
Riding on Satan's wings.
Stopping for no one, there is no return,
Casting a spell in all who remain

As the night passes, and evil arises from deep in the depths of the ground.
No one escapes from the power of terror, metal's black curse will be found.
Chaos emerges and takes one by one, All lives to their demise.
Holy lands become taken by force, watch over with our dark eyes.

Shredding the grounds of the lands we invade,
Gathering all who remain.
Taking prisoner those who try,
To escape the power of our name.

Sending the spirit of hells evil vault,
Guiding us in our ways.
Setting ablaze the towns we invade,
Escaping from nothing impure.

As the night passes, and evil arises from deep in the depths of the ground.
No one escapes from the power of terror, metal's black curse will be found.
Chaos emerges and takes one by one, All lives to their demise.
Holy lands become taken by force, watch over with our dark eyes.
