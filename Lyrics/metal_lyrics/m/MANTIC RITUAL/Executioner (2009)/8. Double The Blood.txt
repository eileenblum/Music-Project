Sickness destroys my thoughts and my words as blood lust boils from inside.
The steady decay grew with each day when I basked in a melancholic stupor.
But now a razor is microns away from my cool which has swollen and threatened to burst.
Alone and betrayed I feel captive of my pain so I'm making sure you get the worst.

I'm going to tear you apart and make you bleed for what you had.
Make you burn up inside knowing you can never go back.
Open your mind and let the feelings flow out in a flood.
And when the time comes I will double the blood.

I live for the path that is taken by few, I am the master of night.
Conventional ways I have pushed aside, I make my wrong and my right.
What I desire I will make my own, regardless of the cost to my victims as I smash their
Bloody bones to the ground in spite, to double my kills and pleasure for the night.

I'm going to tear you apart and make you bleed for what you had.
Make you burn up inside knowing you can never go back.
Open your mind and let the feelings flow out in a flood.
And when the time comes I will double the blood.

Now you are mine, shivers straight down the spine.
Scanning your face, scanning your lines.
It's just what I need, thrive on this greed.
I'm Satan's child, follow my lead.
Step out of the grey, I'll show you the day.
Though they may warn you, fuck what they say.
Now allow me to spill your blood on the floor.
There you are friend, just a couple wounds more.

I'm going to tear you apart and make you bleed for what you had.
Make you burn up inside knowing you can never go back.
Open your mind and let the feelings flow out in a flood.
And when the time comes I will double the blood.
