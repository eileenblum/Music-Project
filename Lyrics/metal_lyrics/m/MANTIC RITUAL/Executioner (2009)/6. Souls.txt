Ancient architecture of the dark ways buried in time
Re-birthed start the master plan of evil design
Genocide of the weakness, the artifact falling into their minds
Demonic rites seep from the depths of hell's confines

Then I stand in solitude as I watch this chaos destroy
All the false ways of life this world employs
Denial of life I view before my eyes
Desolation like a wind swept plain makes room, watch the evil arise

Cannot help but see what lies ahead
For all existence winds up dead
Imminent death spirit sucking hole
I give you my life I give you my soul

Revived from the scripts of hell written in virgin's blood
And in return to the universe shown hate destruction of love
In my mind I see you there and I'm waiting to suck your life
To suck your life

Then I stand in solitude as I watch this chaos destroy
All the false ways of life this world employs
Denial of life I view before my eyes
Desolation like a wind swept plain makes room, watch the evil arise

The undead rise from tombs
The unborn writhe through wombs
You can't run, face the truth
The end comes like a wall of troops

How dare you try to look in my soul
All you're going to find is fire
As existence nears to end our worlds
I'm beyond this shit, release our souls
