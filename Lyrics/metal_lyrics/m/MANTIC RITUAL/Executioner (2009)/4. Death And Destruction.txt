Another day another death
You just breathed your final breath
Annihilate your living soul
Now your life is not your own

Conjuration of evilness, to end your life, bleed to suppress.
Army of hell through sonic sound, tortured body, too profound.
Destruction, from down below, the resonance of hell will flow.
On your knees, eat your lies, the speed of evil will now arise.

Feel the pain of a thousand strong
Taste the steel of hell prolonged.
You see the leather, our code of arms
Bullets and metal, Satan's charms.

Conjuration of evilness, to end your life, bleed to suppress.
Army of hell through sonic sound, tortured body, too profound.
Destruction, from down below, the resonance of hell will flow.
On your knees, eat your lies, the speed of evil will now arise.

The test of time has sealed your fate
You wish to live, but its too late
Nothing can stop this metal pain
Your cries for mercy are cried in vain.

Conjuration of evilness, to end your life, bleed to suppress.
Army of hell through sonic sound, tortured body, too profound.
Destruction, from down below, the resonance of hell will flow.
On your knees, eat your lies, the speed of evil will now arise.
