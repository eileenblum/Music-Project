The last thing you see,
The edge or my knife.
Strike you with speed,
Helping me too take your life

The last thing you feel,
Shivers up your back.
Your heart is set to explode,
Your mind now attacks

Panic
Panic
Panic
Panic

The last thing you see,
The edge or my knife.
Strike you with speed,
Helping me too take your life

The last thing you feel,
Skin torn away.
Your heart to explode,
In panic you pay.

Panic
Panic
Panic
Panic
