Purgatory of the Blind
shall be their salvation
For none shall be saved
by their enslaver God

Sadistic reign of contempt,
brews the reacting force,
blazing forth, declaring
the incoming Fire-Storm!

Incinerating... Fire!
Devastating... Storm!

Slaves not only to delusion,
enslaved by them selves
Enforcing their reign of void,
Depressing the Overman.

Incinerating... Fire!
Devastating... Storm!

Their planted rotten seeds
bare only fruitless trees,
yielding bleak desolate desert...
All now doomed to burn!

Blind are now fleeing,
From their hideout pits,
They flee about, seeking Light...
finding Darkness!

Burn Them All!
Purge to Ashes!

Foundations sinking...
Cracks appearing...
Facades breaking...
Walls crumbling...

Blazing is our fire
Purging is our blaze
Freeing is our purge
Flaming is our freedom

Burn!

We decree our Grand
declaration of war.
Waging the Blind
Crushing their herds

Epitome of Last Man,
are the Blind ones
led by their false Light,
Droning all to doom!

Incinerating... Fire!
Devastating... Storm!

Finally the blaze overcame
Sweeping the wastelands,
Grinding relentlessly
Incinerating Madness!

Blind are now fleeing,
From their hideout pits,
They flee mindlessly about,
Seeking Light... finding Darkness!

Burn Them All!
Purge to Ashes!
