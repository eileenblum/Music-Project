Fallen souls brew turmoil
Yearning to finally arise
Releasing our desperate Shreeks,
Echoing our war-cry!

Plague of Fantasies:
the sandbox of the Blind,
playground grave land,
imprisoning forgotten Voices

Emerging from the fog,
stark force, so bleak!
Under scapes of chaos
yielding our Will to power...

Deafening...
Whispers...

Plague... no more,
Fantasies dissolve!
Emerge... now,
Scream your whispers!

Whispers of the Fallen:
deafening to the Blind
Suffocating empty piety,
Strangling their vanity

Plagues of Fantasies:
The catalyst of our force,
To transcend the grave land,
breeding the awaken Voices

Emerging from the shadow
stark force, so bleak!
Under scapes of madness
yielding our Will to power...

Deafening...
Whispers...

Fantasies... no more,
Plagues wither!
Scream... now,
Emerge with strength!

In tombs awaken,
Chains ready to burst
Our force echoing,
tearing the silence.

Thus echoed the whispers,
of the Fallen ones...
Yearning to reach,
Enlightened scapes of darkness.
Embrace it, Submit within,
deliverance of the Blind,
into the desert scapes of doom.

Crushed tomb-prisons,
Destroyed chains...
Our force echoing,
tearing the silence.

Plague... no more
Fantasies dissolved!

Emerge... now
Screaming whispers!

In tombs awaken,
Chains ready to burst
Our force echoing,
tearing the silence.

Thus echoed the whispers,
of the Fallen ones...
Yearning to reach,
Enlightened scapes of darkness.
Embrace it, Submit within,
deliverance of the Blind,
into the desert scapes of doom.

Our breath of our rage,
For aeons frozen in time
In the depths of solitude
Too long suppressed!

Deafening whispers
Voice of the Legion!

When we are gathered,
their Heaven shall burn,
and our Fall will come,
arising the Legion!

Incarnate of Nocturnal Silence,
Decreeing in Blood and Fire
the the incoming Total Death
