Pillars of the past yet remain,
contamination still feebly persists,
its seeds awaiting future rain,
like a bush in a rainless desert.
Even in the light of certain doom,
their filthy mark still remains,
for the grounds are yet of the enemy,
waiting to be totally reclaimed.

The core of resentment - existence,
abomination of false pity,
the roots of madness still buried.
Henceforth they will be rooted out.
Its seeds crushed in to black ash,
Its trees torn to the ground,
Its fruits decomposed in to nothing,
Its Pestilence eradicated!

Frozen in abyss of dead-stasis,
unknowingly dead before the birth,
bred to linger and drone enslaved.
Ashes in to dust!
blinded, sightless, misery!

Thus our Darkness fell before their eyes,
And the claws of doom grabbed the pray,
Unearthly screams filled the air,
And all the wretched Blind,
Lost their delusional Light,
Shadowed by enlightened force
of our mighty Lightbarer - Legion!

Now before our blackened sight,
We see the majestic might,
crushing the groundless misery...
Aftermath of Illusions!

Seeds rotting - piles of misery...
Death strikes - no salvation...

Ashes remain - scatter of misery...
Doom strikes - Total Death!

Ruins of the past remain,
the spirit of mind-slavery.
And the smell of their foul air
Still lingering all around
are mercilessly blown away,
By the wings of our raven,
The manifest of Darkness
Wielding the scythe of Total Death!

The core of resentment - existence,
abomination of false pity,
and roots of madness destroyed.
Hereafter were rooted out.
Its ash is disposed away,
Its spirit crushed to nothing,
Its reign put to oblivion,
Its Pestilence eradicated!

Frozen in abyss of dead-stasis,
unknowingly dead before the birth,
bred to linger and drone enslaved.
Ashes in to dust!
blinded, sightless, misery!
