Once their wretchedness
Reigned our time and space
Once their stature stood tall
Reigning from the clouds above
We the Fallen, tore that sky apart
Coordinates have been transgressed!

True knowledge, death to arrogance!
And with our superior force
We ignited their Watchtower
and watched it burn to ash!

Thus their Citadel fell
Its rule overthrown.
And our consciousness
freed from their enslavement
Finally truly awaken
We have taken the reign!

Harvest the fallen fruits,
Absorb the given power,
Crush their dreams of salvation,
and the nightmare of immortality ...
... now all fades into oblivion.

Black rain falls viciously,
stained are the frozen grounds.
Arrogance of the Blind ones,
was ruthlessly bled tonight.

Prevail, engage,
Eat the fruits of knowledge
Embrace the Will to Power,
you are the Fallen!

Submit, consume
The air of our awakening
Embrace your Overman
you are the Legion!

Plagued ones fell viciously,
black are the scorched grounds.
Arrogance of Blind zeitgeist,
was ruthlessly burned tonight.

Our majesty now reaps
Reigning time and space
The stature now built anew
Fallen to the zero base,
Foundations have been set,
Reigning from the solid grounds!

We, the Legion of the many
Shall reign now supreme!
Circle of the tyrants defeated,
The next aeon is ours!

Thus their Citadel fell
Its rule overthrown
And our consciousness
freed from their enslavement
Finally truly awaken
We have taken the reign!
