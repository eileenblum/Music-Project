Punished by the sins of your fathers, revelations cut deep.
Intolerance of the others clouded their judgement.
Anatomy of our destruction comes full circle.
Years of indifference, both sides have suffered loss.
The balance of power has been tipped.
Living in squalor, hiding, avoiding.
Efficient are these preconceived monsters.
Hunting, fighting, killing.

Defectors attempt to join against their kin.
Not like them, a jump in the evolutionary course.
Supplied with intellect and the means to destroy.

Intermingling produces a new face.
Offspring that is viewed as a defilement of race.

A positive force to guide the lost.
Emptiness is suppressed
The ultimate lifeforms will orchestrate escape.
Final solution to the endgame.

Risking death to fortify.
Bleeding out all the guilt.
Buried lies are clawing their way to the surface

Punished by the sins of your fathers, revelations cut deep.
Intolerance of the others clouded their judgement.
Excavating to the unfamiliar world above
Years of indifference, both sides have suffered loss.
Confined and hidden from the truth.
Unwilling union did not survive the test of time.
Tracking, eating, killing.
Engineered for doomsday scenario.

Decisions are made, choosing your death in vain.
Being ripped limb from limb
Inhaling the toxins, poisoned air topside.
The crossroads of evolution.

Pushing forth to an unworthy end.
Is this our destiny?
Failing to substantiate.
Our being, our soul, living just to die.
Forgotten test subjects?
Bury the creatures.

Unlikely clan emerges to bear witness to this new landscape.
Civilization in the distance, how can this be?
Can you believe what was done to us?
The air is clean!
A government hoax, experiment!

Revenants focused on horizon searing with contempt.
