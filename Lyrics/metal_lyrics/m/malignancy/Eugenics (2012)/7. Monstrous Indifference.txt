Echoes of the past, unearth primitive ways
Peel back forgotten layers, systemic shock waves
Indoctrinate primal instincts
Tainted bloodlines inscribe.

Lack of complexity, cult mentality.
Devotion to microbial life
Changeling collective consciousness
Subspecies offshoot, brutish tendencies
Meander about, habitation is found

Encircled by your brethren, radiation sickness
Inhospitable caverns, rigid and unyielding
Adversity and tragedy
Imperfect progenies

Hostiles fueled by fear
Aversion towards the others
Separation anxiety
Territorial sovereignty

Mutoids bound by disfigurement.
Brutal life of sufferance
