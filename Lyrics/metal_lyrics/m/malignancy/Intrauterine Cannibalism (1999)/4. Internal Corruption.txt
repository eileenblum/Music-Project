Incoherent and desolate 
Thoughts suppressed by fluctuating dementia 
Sunken features display a face in torment 
Feeble legs support this skeletal frame 

Skin wrapped tight, clinging to crumbling bone 
Ashamed of your being, reside in seclusion 

Abrasions bloat seeping water 
Cancrum tear lips 
Outbreak of psoriasis sheds disease 
Scaly patches of skin undulate with the stress of corruption 

Malnourished, emaciated mess 
Bound to miracle drugs that attempt to stabilize 
terminal condition 

Bowel movements well up 
Discharging pasty, blood soaked feces 
Regurgitate thick, brown clumps of bile 
Waste away, your body shuts down
