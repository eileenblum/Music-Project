From vaginal sores seep fetid secretions 
Entering the urethra of my engorged cock 
Vile juices spread throughout erectile tissue 
Veins bulge from flaking foreskin 

Embolisms deaden tissue clotted arteries rupture 
Lack of blood cause involuntary muscle spasms 
Twitching limbs incapacitate 
Introduction of foreign enzymes cause implosion 
Leukocytes weaken uterine lamprey to feed 

Corpuscles are drained for their nutrients 
Viral enzymes break down insides 
Transforming live tissue into desiccated chunks 
Carnivorous eel draws dehydrated matter through genitals 

Swollen member spurts bloated bits of viscera 
Testicles shrivel until they are non-existent 
Penis provides leech with sustenance 
Host is stripped of organs
