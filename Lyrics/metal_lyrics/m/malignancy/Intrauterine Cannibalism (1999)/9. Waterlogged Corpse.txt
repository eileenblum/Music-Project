Black, cold depths entomb 
Eyes gaze with a lifeless stare 
Saltwater and gases bloat this monstrosity 
A hideous state of decomposition 

Saturated flesh pitted and blue 
Digits chewed to shreds 
Skull housing microscopic organisms 
Bacterium feast on dilapidated brain matter 
Orifices filled with minute parasites 
Pressure causes anus to burst forth entrails 

Waterlogged corpse drifts with the tide 
Fish nibble on this rotted husk 
Washed upon a barren shore 
Entangled in seaweed and algae 

Bodily fluids released onto the sand 
A free flowing stream of excrement 

Sun beats down on this swollen sack 
Causing skin to dry and crack 
Crustaceans bore through 
Feeding on rented meat 
Insects inhabit the carrion shell 

Planting their seed 
Carcass will be utilized 
As a host to newborn larvae
