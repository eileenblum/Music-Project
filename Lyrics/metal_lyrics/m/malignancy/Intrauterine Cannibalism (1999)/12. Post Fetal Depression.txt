Suffocate our own offspring 
A mirror image of ourselves 
Precious life, taken for granted 
Caved in skull 

Brutalized! 

Bruised and bloody open wounds 
Crushing brittle bones 
Gnawing on softened skin 
Blackened eyes, broken nose 

Abandoned with a dented head 
Air choked out with a plastic bag 
Helpless infant frost-bitten 
Unwanted innocent, left for dead 

Strangled throat, punctured skin 
Organs bleeding from within 
Sick and dying malnutrition 
Decrepit body, hunger affliction 

Sodomized, penetration, orifice distortion 
Violated with father's love
