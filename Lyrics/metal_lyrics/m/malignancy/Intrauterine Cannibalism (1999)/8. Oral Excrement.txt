Under saturated cells, excrete idiocy
Communicate through limited means
Restricted thought consumes your narrow mind
Relying only on visual stimulants
Meticulous glued to the simple things in life
Incomprehensible, walking contradiction
Constantly spewing predictable stupidity
Vocalize without having a clue
Never having a view of you own
Conformist in everything you do
Thinking you are someone of importance
But in fact just a blemish on the skin
Swollen red and full of shit
Insignificant among a race of fools
