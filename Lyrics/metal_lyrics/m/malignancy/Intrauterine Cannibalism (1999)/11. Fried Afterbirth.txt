Fermenting foulness expels from the womb 
Ruptured membranes disgorge 
Piles of glazed placenta parts 
Stink of human innards 
Cellular waste, discarded filth 

Seasoned the perfection 
Feast on this twisted delicacy 
Engorging on the nutrient rich fetal sac 

Defile yourself with the consumption of fetus backwash 
Eating not to survive 
Only to fulfill a selfish need for flesh 

Fried Afterbirth 

Animalistic thirst for infant waste 
Cooking the building blocks of life 
Cutting into something that helped sustain a life 
Part of your wife and child are on a plate
