Backwards thinking, prevalent throughout the ages 
Harvesting the waters in the name of slaughter 
Gutting the sea of all its creatures 
We declare our dominance over the inhabitants 

Evolved to survived, lurks evil that instills primal fear in man 
An eating machine, with eyes so black, pain is unseen 
Human fatalities pollute the water with their blood 
We convict this predator for acting on instinct 

Insatiable lust for death, the thirst could never be satisfied 
The hands of mankind are rotting with perversion 
Justified killing, destroying all that we fear 

Butchered in the name of industry 
Selfishly used to promote longevity 
Dissection eternally, free from malignancy 
Exploiting insides, to further humanity 
The ultimate hypocrisy
