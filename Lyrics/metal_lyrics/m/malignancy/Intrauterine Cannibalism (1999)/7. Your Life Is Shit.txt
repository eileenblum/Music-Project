Clinical exploitation of nature
Derivatives of hybrid chemicals, used to induce fatigue
Hallucinogenic qualities causing mass anxiety
Inebriating the self to deal with depression
Altering perception, causing an inability to form decisions
Misuse of mind numbing elements
Disabled the equilibrium
Distorted thoughts, not your own
Brain clouded, with injected alternatives
Addictive qualities produce zombified clones
Crushing structures, severing family ties
With no one, loneliness sets in
Long term dependency, corrupt eternally
The organs that sustain life
Your tainted thins, as the virus destroys cells
Stricken with aliments you cannot survive
The infection oozes within
Skeletal structure protrudes through skin
Winkled and shriveled, your death begins
Belly bloats with the poison of swollen organs
The liver bursts, expelling disease throughout
Causing paralysis, frozen in a coma state
Eyes stare blankly, absent of life
