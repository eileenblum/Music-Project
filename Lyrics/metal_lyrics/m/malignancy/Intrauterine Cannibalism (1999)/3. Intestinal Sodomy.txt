Ancient organisms lying dormant in nature 
Undisturbed, awaiting release 
Destruction of tropical forests awaken the virus 
Primitive life seeks out a host 

Defies the air as it travels 
Pollutant is breathed through unclean oxygen 
Viral strain begins it's decadence 
Unwilling victim harbors this lethal agent 

It cripples you, frozen in a state of shock 
Hunched over, the pain it stains your face 
Your cellular structure is being liquefied 
Digestive track spills from the rectum 

Come to grips with reality Intestinal sodomy, fucked from the inside out 
Your ass is torn, black anal sludge flows from the spent orifice 
Disembodied, all your stomach contents are emptied
