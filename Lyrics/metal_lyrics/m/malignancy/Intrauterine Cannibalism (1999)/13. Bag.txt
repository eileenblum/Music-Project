Plague with diarrheal secretions
Post-anal drip
Unable to stop the flow of fecal matter
Colostomy irrigation necessary
Colon brought to the surface of the skin
For intestinal drainage
Obsolete anus sewn closed
Remnants of my bowels flood into a bag
I have a new ass
Porthole constantly leaking
Cavity always stinking
I just long to be normal
Secrete from an open bunghole
Overflowing, liquefied feces
I can't keep it a secret, the evidence stains my clothes
Colostomy has a hole
I soiled myself
