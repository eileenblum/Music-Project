Deterioration of the protective layer 
Radiation clouds dispensing toxic bacteria 
Atmospheric pressure spawns a new epidemic 
Imbalance in nature 

Mutation, genetic structure altered 
Seepage of cancerous spores, pustule discharge from pores 
Tumorous secretions, tissue inflammation 
Spreading neoplasms, causing convulsive spasms 

Mucopus is crusted in the corners of the mouth 
Boils swell to the bursting point 
Entrails puked up, innards get stuck 
Caught in the esophagus 

Stomach acids burn through the throat 
Dangling intestines dripping with excrement 
Ulcers eat through the abdomen 
Leaking impurities 

Organs spoil turning black with rot 
Parasites extract marrow from bone causing brittleness 

Leg bones collapse, trunk falls in a pool filled with muscle and blood 
Submerged in a gore drenched puddle, melting away 
Disintegration, total cell breakdown 
All that is left are powdered remnants of a once functioning being
