Fertilization of malformed ovaries 
Miracle or modern medicine 
Deformed fetal development 
Coupled with drug addiction 
Propitiate nature's law of selection 

Embryos incubate in this diseased womb 
Fertility drugs mutate the stronger of the two 
Fraternal twins vie for more nutrients 

Grotesque umbilical cord emerges 
Ridged needles puncture the soft epidermis 
Meticulous and precise, this living extension 
pumps stimulus into the unwilling recipient 
Drainage of vital fluids 

Accelerated growth patterns facilitate the hunger 
Complete absorption, causes sibling to crumble inward 
Shriveled body floats lifeless 
Awaiting to be born dead
