Parasite bacteria, inhibits the host
Disease production necessity

Feed of nutrient surroundings,
complete consumption
Cannibalize the insides, reproduction
of the viral cells
Cultivate the life form, pathogenic
Inborn stimulus resistance

Calculated assault from the genus species
Immunity crumbles, resulting infestation
Thriving malignant archetype exudes

Successful habitation, mutant realization

Organism achieves unnatural progression
Volatile creature, assimilation
Cultivate the living cells
Feed of nutrient surroundings,
complete consumption
Cannibalize the insides, disease migration
