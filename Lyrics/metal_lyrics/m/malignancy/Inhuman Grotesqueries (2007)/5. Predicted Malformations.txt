Imperfect human specimen
Altered, wounded shell
Flesh distortions scar
Estranged, disproportioned

Construct compromised, battered body suffers
Appendages buckle from the strain
Consumed by this reality
Surgical practices attempt reconstruction
Failure to restore humanoid features
Facial manipulations establish monstrosity

Physical defects, alien symbiote
Fractured psyche, longing for uncreation
Cursed victim of violent circumstance
Featureless mutilated abomination
Defective human form, skin melds together

Blemished flesh loosened from bone
Sagging folds, no composure
Blistering pigment, lost sensation

Reclusive figure looms, shunned by the outside
Forsaken, renounce inhumanity

Cursed victim of violent circumstance
Vanquished exterior, distortions scar
Judgment made, who's inhuman
