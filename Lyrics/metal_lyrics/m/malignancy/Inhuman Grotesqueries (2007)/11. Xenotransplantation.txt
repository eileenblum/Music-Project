A question of ethics, stemmed from transferral
Genome laced with retroviruses
Potential creation of infectious agent
Implications of a practical application
Contentious technology never falters commitment

Hyper acute rejection from transgenic
Humanization, lucrative venture
Dismissal of adverse effects, new organ coupling

Experiments continue to perfect animal to human
Financial gain with the decay accelerating factor, viable strategy
Engineered ideals, true science or true profit
Corporate gluttony, racing towards a means to an end

Master techniques for transplantation
Humanization, lucrative venture
A question of ethics, public outcry

Endogenous faculties reek havoc on recipient
Technology usage without formal testing
The human element is suppressed by vertebrate
Proteins block compliment activation
Immunosuppressive regimen needed for survival

Experiments continue to perfect animal to human
Financial gain with the decay accelerating factor, corporate gluttony
Underground research soon to surface
Anomaly of human variation
