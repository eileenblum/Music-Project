Radiation pollutes, a hidden guise
Activation of dormant pestilence
Undetectable force that ravages
Complicates abilities for defense

Neglected, left unchecked rots from the source
Weakness crumbles within
Complication of risk factors determine the outcome
Patient outcry for swift action is met with skepticism
Viable donor needed for immediate transplant

Searching for the perfect candidate to ultimately neutralize the disease
Information is never forthcoming especially in the wake of disaster
Numbing all your feeling

Hording factions are engaged in this battle to crush the antagonist
Renewing the chances of survival with the breakthroughs of science
That promise to rid us of disease
Placing our trust
Hopeful we fight until our last breath
