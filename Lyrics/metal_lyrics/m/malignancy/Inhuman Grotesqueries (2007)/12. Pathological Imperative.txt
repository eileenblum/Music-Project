Formulate enigmatic archetype
Contentious nature correlates with origin
Anomaly of human variation
Produced, packaged and sold
Skillful assembly, genetic motif
Hidden from public view, ulterior motive
Faulted hybrid, indefinite exile
Groomed for potential mutiny
Stifle the voice of conjecture
Plausible deniability
Confirm to deny, factual evidence
Encumber the truth
General public shielded from miscreancy
The powers that be eliminate without provocation
Escapees must not bear witness
Intrigued by the congregations
Science's bastard son
Evolving next generations
Freedom from exalted ones
Innocuous biped learns anew
Unilateral thinking, comprehension
Survival instinct, cellular miracle
Plausible deniability

Investment has to be protected no matter the cost or loss of life
