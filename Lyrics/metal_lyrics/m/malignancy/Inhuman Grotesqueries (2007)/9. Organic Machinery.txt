Regenerative powers exist innately in vertebrates
Proteins of complexity awaken mutation
Genetic machines function for regrowth

Signals are sent to reassemble damage
Reworking the technology for multiple part prosthesis
Biological tampering, bending the will of industry
Patent pending, mass production
Sterilized, favorable conditions

Deadlines of bodies father the treasure
Inanimate hollows usher in the new age
Slaves to capitalism, silent suffrage

Distribute the goods to the commonwealth
Benefactor in a corporate scheme to cheat death
Governmental campaigns not an obstacle
Unstoppable, this juggernaut dissects the nation into human material
Exploiting all society's dead
Constructing the evolution of a predestined end
Marketing ourselves for manipulation

Biological tampering, bending the will of industry
Deadlines of bodies father the treasure
Inanimate hollows usher in the new age
