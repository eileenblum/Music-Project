Stimulated labyrinths of intricacy
Irrational cognitive thought
Evoking sensitivity devoid of intellect
Mentally unsound socialite

Rearrange to fit in, blending flesh for status
Exterior changes dictated by the media
Ripping human form, anesthetize the senses
Butchery for the sake of esthetics
Inherent behavior programmed to elicit the weak
Contagious thoughts culminate and you are lost

Augmentation to regain esteem
Restructure cranial dynamics
Scraping, tearing, fulfilling
Gauging, stitching, renewing
Shedding, losing, satisfying
Emerging non human synthetic form
Rearrange to fit in, blending flesh for status
Evoking sensitivity devoid of intellect
Emotional destitute, soulless in stature
Mentally unsound socialite, vacancy inside
Addicted to the sensation of reconstruction
Guilty of over indulgence
