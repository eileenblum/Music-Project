Blood vessels constitute benign density
Hematal cluster, harmless malgrowth
Disruption of seminal fluids
Birth defects causing infertility

Useless girth encompasses surrounding reproductive organ
Incrusted with a gory reminder of visceral distinction

Flaccid mass existence
A creation without form or function
Distortions of the flesh
Formations erase orientation

Sexual amputee, grotesque impotence
Separating procedure inconceivable
Medical prognosis, asexuality

Suffering through abnormal fluctuations
Birth defects causing infertility
Permanent life of malfunctioning without pleasure only pain
