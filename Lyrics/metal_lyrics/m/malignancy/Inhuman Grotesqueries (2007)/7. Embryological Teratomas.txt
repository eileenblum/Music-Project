Lingering placental mass
Cellular divisions, evolving markers
Tissue splicing, timorous formations
Remnants of life, sexual butchery
Visceral distinction
Levels of complexity nurturing the infancy
Discount mortal fibre
Desecration of human essence
Expanding pestilence, propitiate dysfunction
Infused cells, soft tissue constricts
Inflammation of the organs
Receptors sense pain, internal change
Teratomas
Toxic embryo refuse debilitates
Engine of procreation
Vestigial dwelling consecration
Offspring survives while entity succumbs to cavity extraction
Malignant infancy, injected rotten seed
Maternal link
