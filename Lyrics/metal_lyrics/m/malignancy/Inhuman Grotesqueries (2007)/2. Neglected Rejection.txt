Impoverished inner workings
Solitary, dejected hollow shell
Ridiculed by your peers
Frustrations consuming all waking moments
Delusions and anxiety riddle the mind

Turning on yourself slicing vulnerable tissue
Compulsive neurosis dominating you

Emotionally starved, obsessions contrived
Fabricating a whole new world
Imprisoned within, hallucinations solidify
Empty feeling of dread
Innate psychosis swells past threshold levels
Consummate your deficient self

Downward spiral engulfed by this deity
Gauging at your soul, obtuse revelations
Droning through life over medicated
Solicit insights to your psyche
Pharmaceutical junkie, sullen persuasion

Picked apart then left to fend for yourself
Esoteric fiends swarm to observe progress
Gnostic practitioners attempt to reconstruct

Emotionally starved, obsessions contrived
Fabricating a whole new world
Imprisoned within, hallucinations solidify
Consummate your deficient self
Innate psychosis swells past threshold levels
Empty feeling of dread

Galvanize your willingness for normalcy
Enthusiastic in supplying dependency

Intertwined you will forever be
A depository for instability
