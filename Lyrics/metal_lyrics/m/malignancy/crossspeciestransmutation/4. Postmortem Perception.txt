Organic disease tears through your vitality
Transplantation of donor parts impending
Careful attachment of new prosthesis
Inner rejection without proper transfusion
Procedure completion, stabilized patient

Momentary flashes during healing process
Visions of violence cloud your thoughts
Images not recognized, delusions of dying
Inherent memories on a cellular level
Subconscious torture becomes reality
Discomfort centered around new organ
Trauma to the limbs and torso
Immeasurable distress, the pain of extinction
Recipient experiences demise of donor
Decadence brought to repaired living system
Tissue rejection not the origin
Death impressions vivid, felt throughout
Repression of agony before shock sets in
Reliving the horror of dying someone elseâs death
