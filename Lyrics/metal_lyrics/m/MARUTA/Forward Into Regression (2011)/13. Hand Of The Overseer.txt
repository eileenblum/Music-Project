Bringer of grand illusion and false hope, give us this drop of poison we consume in our stale wine. Maintain order through ignorance, the herd sits awaiting a fictional utopia. Devoting life to absurd ideology, to spread the darkest of venoms, eradicating the lifestyles of those who envision differently. Hand of the overseer grasping tightly around your neck. To no end, to control. Thirst for obedience. The fabricated tyrant rises.
