I am failure. I am decline. Incapable to integrate. Intro this heard of flesh. This Clockwork machine. Its gears of bone and virulent submission. Face down in somber pool of remorse. In self condemnation. Fists clenched. Legs kicking. The acrid taste of swallowing defeat. I am not regret. I am deep seeded self loathing.
