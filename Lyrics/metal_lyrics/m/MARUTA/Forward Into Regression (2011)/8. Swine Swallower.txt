Look back at your deeds, washed away with false regret. A prayer to clean your filthy hands, to wash away traces of ill deeds, of cancerous exploits. This is what you pray for. To cleanse yourself of your guilt. Is this what you'd die for? Close your eyes, lie to yourself. This fictitious worship, an attempt to decontaminate. Distorted prayers to justify corrupt acts. Cleanse yourself in the name of your false idol. An absurd justification. Rinse, repeat, regret. Transgress violent acts all over again.
