Walk this cold earth. Endure the life of carrion. To sink into desolation. What is civil and what is not. Born into famine. These ardent mouths pled. Easier not to overhear. Born into misery. Exist in misery. Deeper into the darkest boundaries of pain and misfortune. Turn your head. Change the channel. Let them starve and rot away as long as you stay within your walls of comfort. This is your stagnation routine.
