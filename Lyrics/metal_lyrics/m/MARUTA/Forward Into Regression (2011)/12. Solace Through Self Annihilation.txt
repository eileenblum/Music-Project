Pace around this city of despair. This haven of plague dogs, a sanctum of derelicts. Loose oneself beside, to drink it away. Noose is tied, dangling from the cloud of barbiturates. In rapture. High above or deep into the soil where the worms embed blood back into dirt. Any place but here, trapped in skin, in banality. Tear away the flesh. Enter the chasm. Hellbound, if such a dominion exists.
