Expectation diminish, morale is surrendered. To find no aim in forging ahead. Hollow bodies, barren of ambition. The mind is overcome. Reprogramming injected. Floating through the wire, we have become human carbon. With all hopes and dreams stripped away we conform to deform, we bow down to the architects of paranoia.
