To stand alone, within these inorexible walls. Imprisoned by forlorn. Pressed against the rust. A prisoner to the machine. This animal spit into a caste system. Yet confirmed to stand alone. Teeth scraping concrete, a strong desire to overcome. Yet confirmed to walk alone. Led by traitors, deep into dismay, exploited and confined to stand alone. The current pulls in. Somber man stands alone. Dragged away. Unable to cope. To live in a strain. To die in a strain. Let these dark currents take it away.
