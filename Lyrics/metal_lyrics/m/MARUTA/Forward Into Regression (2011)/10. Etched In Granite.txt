Inhale the bitter salt of this wretched earth. Let it seep through blackened lungs, flow through collapsed veins. Eat away from the inside out. In this terrain, negativity conquers the positive. Await the final hour, View the world with scraped retinas. Engage depravity. "Nothing is real. Nothing is permanent. Everything is subversive.". Etch these words in granite as I have carved them into my black heart.
