Populous reduced to nothing, dispersed within the iron grid
Scattered remnants, human collateral
In disarray embrace your ill fate
Inverted landscapes bleed poison back into our crumbling network
An infrastructure with no foundation
Poisoned seeds buried
Germinating this cancer
Born unto this earth, progenitors of extinction
Autogenous
Obliteration imminent
Purveyors of extinction
This self induced cycle of desolation.
An interval of genocide orchestrated by our very own hands
