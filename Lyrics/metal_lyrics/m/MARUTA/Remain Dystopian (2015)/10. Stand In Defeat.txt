Standing in a pool of my own cruor
Where tears, piss, and gloom coalesce
Knee deep and immobile
I stand and watch in anguish 
I cannot advance to you
No good outcome to derive from this
Fixation on the negative
Wash it away with sulphur
Scraped bare to the bone, and ground in to dirt
Purged, empty
Boy with hollow eye sockets anchored down with nails of lead
Moth with torn wings
Fading, unable to lament
All is lost and obscured
Standing in defeat
Fixation on the negative
I wait for the end
So distant, I cannot advance
I pray for the end
