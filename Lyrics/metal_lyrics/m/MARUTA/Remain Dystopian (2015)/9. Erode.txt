The slow decay
Slipping from my grasp
I sit and watch you disintegrate
A world of shit that you manifested
Dissipate within these walls you built
Existence within the iron box
Rust consumes, breathe in oxidation
Over, and over, and over again
Metallic shards ripping away at your lungs as you rot away
In seclusion I watch you erode
From Safe distance
Watching you bleed over, and over, and over again
