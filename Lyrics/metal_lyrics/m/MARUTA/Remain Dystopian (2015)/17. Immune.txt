Immune
Scar tissue over nerve endings
Cauterized
Wounds sealed with wire
Grieving, yet detached
No benevolence left, only antipathy
Immune to your tactics to gain sympathy for your advantage
Too numb to feel anything
Benumbed and wearied 
Indifferent
I shall evade
Remaining detached
