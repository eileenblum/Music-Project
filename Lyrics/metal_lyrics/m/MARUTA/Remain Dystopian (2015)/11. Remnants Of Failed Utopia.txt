Relinquishing your halcyon throne
Possessions stripped, odeals disintegrate
Utopia rots away as the vultures pick away at the heaps of remnants
This era of true desperation
Where wealth has absolutely no value
Spawn of past autocrats
Inbred opulence
Stannic tower rusts and collapses
Your life in the hands of peasants 
Indisposed and famished servants now become the master
Gaze upon the burning remnants of a failed utopia
