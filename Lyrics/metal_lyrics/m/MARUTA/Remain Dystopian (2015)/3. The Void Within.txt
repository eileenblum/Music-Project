A man with no code
Honor lies absent
Cultivate chaos, induced turmoil, hubris
A man with no code
Devoid of ethic
No moral restraints
Revel in disdain, malice 
Entwined within the void inside
Entropy flowing deep through the bloodstream, reluctant
Volatile reality, lunacy and self-loathing to fill the void within
Consumed in ethanol
Self-inflicted misery is what fuels this machine
A life deprived of empathy
This is inevitable
Isolation eternal
The path chosen
