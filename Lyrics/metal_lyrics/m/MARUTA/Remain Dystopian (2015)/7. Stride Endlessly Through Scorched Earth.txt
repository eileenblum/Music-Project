This is where I endlessly stride
No refuge, march perpetually 
Cursed to walk this scorched earth for miles
This is where I endlessly stride
Bear the weight perpetually
No retrogress
Drag the weight, forge ahead
Impoverished and desolate
This terrain is my burden
Ceaseless march in solitude, as bone scrapes cartilage
Flesh against granite
To roam scorched earth with dust filled lungs
Deterioration
Condemned to march
Isolated
Quarantine unending
Forever stride alone
Through this scorched earth
