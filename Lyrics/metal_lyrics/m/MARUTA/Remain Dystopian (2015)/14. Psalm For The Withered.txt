Suffer without purpose 
A struggle that remains endless
Withered and downtrodden
Helpless and incoherent
Unsystematic thought process conducting your every action
Unstable, misbegotten
You are simply a machine programmed to grieve
Maraud those devoted to you
A slave to your own cloak of lunacy
This is not your misdeed
Your program condemns you to endure a lifetime of alienation
Failed to cope with the grand system
Face social rejection
A psalm for the withered
Derelict confined to the streets
