The rejection of your doctrine is my sole purpose for existing
In this chamber, I am grand architect
Disproving your ideals grants me solace
Bedlam erupts when the flock has no master
Futile attempts are made to reinterpret invalid rites
To no longer walk amongst wolves, but to dwell amongst rats
A harsh realization
