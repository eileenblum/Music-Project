Engulfed in flames, this is my last testament 
Inhale the blaze, sinews form into ash
My declaration, drenched in kerosene I ignite
Protocol for self immolation
A rebirth in fire, to slowly transcend
The glory of martyrdom
Post mortem Idolatry
Phoenix ascends, phoenix reborn
Entropy consumes. The body burns
Only charred scraps of human remain
Forever engrained in your memory
