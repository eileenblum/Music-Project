Exist as a conduit of disdain and aversion
Submergence deep within these barren oceans
Rotting away, barren sea
In dominion of vast emptiness
Cognition removed
Plummet into spiral downward trajectory
Revert back into feral state
This is where nothing is absolute 
Sanity dismantled
Drown deep within the psyche
Lucidity removed
I decline alone, misbegotten by my own mind
Cognition removed, infinity is my prison
