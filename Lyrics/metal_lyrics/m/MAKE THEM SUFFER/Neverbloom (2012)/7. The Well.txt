The Well. So dark and cold, it beckons me in the nightThe whispers, they follow me. Can you hear it? Can you hear it?

Down the abyss I fell, where I found my sinking face and drowned myself. 

The Well. With It's mouth of tears, It whispers to me in the night. This darkness is far too familiar, it's pulling me down, it's pulling me... 

Down the well I will wait, I sank for days just to forget my name. I forgot my fucking face, I left at the bottom of the well. 

The Well. So dark and cold, it beckons me in the night. This darkness is far too familiar, it's pulling me down, I want out, Let me out. 
Let me out. 

I can't feel my sinking face, I left it at the bottom of the well.
I smiled when I drowned myself, Down the well I'll stay.
