Will you remember me
As the one from the trees
When the forests used to sing
Or when I locked myself
In the heart of the wood
And threw away the key
You just kept giving yourself away
A gift to cherish until piece by piece
You laid before the roots of time
Day by day the nights swallow the sun,
And with every night
The more you gave your sadness came undone
You just kept slipping through the cracks
Of my fingertips

I only hope that you remember me instead
As the one from the trees
When the forests used to sing
Or when I locked myself
In the heart of the wood
And threw away the key

You're not desire
You're just a fucking widow
Weaving webs among the woods
I'm not the answer but if you take my hand
I'll show you the world of the dead
There you will smile into the night
I watched you sing for hours on end
We're telltale spiders spinning webs and singing songs
Sharing your stories with the moon and the trees
With a world which strung you along
I've shut you out
I don't like your stories anymore
They always end so fucking sad
Fuck
I've turned my back
I've turned my back
On you for good

Just keep smiling into the night
I watched you pass me by
Every night you died
With a smile on your face
In my dreams you wept blood
From your eyes

Just keep smiling into the night
My beautiful bride

I fell for your bleeding crimson eyes
Just so you know
I'll always remember you
As the telltale spider
When darkness crept into our days
Sharing stories with the world
Until piece by piece you gave your heart away
You're not desire
You're just a fucking widow
Weaving webs among the woods
I'm not the answer but if you take my hand
I'll show you the world of the dead
I hate sad stories they always end the same
I'll never forget how the forest wept
When you gave yourself away
