Beyond these forgotten shores of baleful unrelenting torture.
The sky has shattered, pouring its tears into oblivion and wishing away its unending paradox, as it crumbles into exile, piece by piece.

plunged into darkness by the undertow of the Maelstrom.
slowly, piece by piece, forever forgotten.

Take me away from here.
I will slip away, watch me disapear.
The Maelstrom consumes me.
An eternity frozen in time.

Pulled beneath the deepest depths
Where I was always meant to be, forever lost.

I've found my home
far from the grips of time
with the faces of desertion
wandering the depths of expulsion

With the faces of desertion, far from the grips of time, I have found my home.

I've found my home, where no light can reach and the only sounds are those soft whispers that no one else can hear.
Comforting me. I'll smile my way away to my darkest days.

Beyond these forgotten shores of endless sadness and torturous sorrow.
The sky has shattered, crying into constant uncertainty and wishing away its perpetual torment, as it crumbles into exile, piece by piece.

plunged into darkness by the undertow of the Maelstrom.
forgotten piece by piece, forever and ever.

Take me away from here.
I will slip away, watch me disapear
The Maelstrom consumes me.
An eternity frozen in time.

I've found my home, beneath the depths.
I've found my home, where I can dream these days away.

It was perfect from the first day, we stood and watched as the ocean opened up and swallowed the sun.
Swallowed the sun.
