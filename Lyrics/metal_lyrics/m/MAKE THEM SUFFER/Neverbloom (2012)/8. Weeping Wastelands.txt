I am your fucking end. You will tremble at my feet.

Bringer of pain and suffering, hatred sadness and despair. I will unleash upon the world the madness that manifests within me, and all of our hearts. 

Do you remember a time before this barren waste of frost, death and decay.
hopelessness and nothingness or was it all just a figment of my imagination?
Now tear by tear we wash away the fondness felt in our hearts. Drowning the lands before this infinite sorrow. Suffocating ourselves to hide the pain. 

Weeping Wastelands Tearing our hearts from flesh Hope is gone. All thatâs left is this abomination.  

Unleash your hatred upon the world, this sickness, this blight suffocating us into submission ridding us of our will to feel, I would rather die than succumb to this plague, I have nothing but pure disgust for the infected, and the withered souls. 

Do you remember a time before this barren waste of frost, death and decay.
hopelessness and nothingness or was it all a figment of my imagination? Bringer of pain and suffering, hatred sadness and despair. I will unleash upon the world the madness that manifests within me, and all of our hearts. 

Blood soaked snow, Rotting flesh, putrid sickness. Where am I? Weeping Wastelands Blood soaked snow, Rotting flesh, putrid sickness. Where am I?
Overwhelmed with misery, on my own. 

I have no fucking remorse And I wish for nothing but pain upon those who dealt me this burden 

Weeping Wastelands Tearing our hearts from flesh Hope is gone. All thatâs left is this abomination.  

Hating and struggling with sorrow and mourning of the significance. Drowning in tears. 

I am the destroyer of hope, Lord of Woe. I am everything youâve ever hated before.
