You brought me back to These darkened dreams, I must reweave. Just leave me here, at the roof of the world. 

All the way up here where the stars never sleep, we could live forever and no one could stop us. 

and all those perfect moments, they fell like raindrops. 
now follow me to the heart of the wood. 

We're the ones in your dreams, pulling strings in your mind, 
and we scheme when you sleep, through the shadows of time. 
We exist in your thoughts, the ones no one can find. 
We remain in the hearts of the young and the tears from the sky. 

You brought me back, to the darkness within.
Buried in the depths of the elms. Locked beneath the earth. 

We've been here before. Do you remember what I said to you all those years ago;

Some day, you'll forget me, and all that will be left are the fragments of our shattered dreams and those tiny, perfect moments where time stood still. 

We're the ones in your dreams, pulling strings in your mind, and we scheme when you sleep, through the shadows of time. 
We exist in your thoughts, the ones no one can find. 
We remain in the hearts of the young and the tears from the sky. 

You brought me back. In my dying dreams, is endless sleep. 
Just leave me here, at the roof of the world.
