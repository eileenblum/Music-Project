There's nothing left of you

So when I left the loop
What were you trying to prove?
You're skin and bones and crumbling
But now the clouds are parting

With blue skies and endless heights
So just fill your lungs and breathe

Slow it down, just wait
Take some time to question life
While you're young and learning
Take it slow, just stay
I know it's hard but moving fast
You're going to miss the journey

Death embrace me, Izanami take me, take me
Life embrace me, Izanagi take me home

(You're going to miss the journey)

Take me home

The earth is coming to life again
Go!

With blue skies and endless heights
So face east to the sunrise
This is my resting place, resting place
Inside my mind
You know it's fine to take your time
So just fill your lungs and breathe

Slow it down, just wait
Take some time to question life
While you're young and learning
Take it slow, just stay
I know it's hard but moving fast
You're going to miss the journey

Death embrace me, Izanami take me, take me
Life embrace me, Izanagi take me home

You're skin and bones and crumbling
Just know your clock is ticking
It's moving so fast
And all the clouds are parting
It's beaming with light
So take my hand and trust me
Because we are going to see the sunrise
If it's the last thing we do tonight
