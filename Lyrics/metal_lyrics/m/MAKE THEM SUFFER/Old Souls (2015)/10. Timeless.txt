Lying awake at night, lying awake at night. (Always the same).
Clouds start to break, washing away our goodbyes,
Those were the days,
Wash it away.

Oh these days.
Always dreaming,
Sinking deeper.

Oh these days.
Always slipping,
Drifting deeper.

Watching our days, watching our days go by.
Boiling with hatred;
I can't find the answers to all the lies you once clung to.

Oh these days.
Always dreaming,
Sinking deeper.

Oh these days.
Always slipping,
Drifting deeper.

Always sinking drifting deeper.
Always dreaming sinking deeper.

I'll patiently wait,
'Til time ticks away.
Spilling with questions;
Those were the days;
Never to change.
Always the same.

Our love is timeless.

Oh these days.
Always dreaming,
Sinking deeper.

Oh these days.
Always slipping,
Drifting deeper.
