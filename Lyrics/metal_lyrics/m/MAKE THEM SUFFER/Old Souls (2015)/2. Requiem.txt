Dry those eyes, they're so telling of age.
Fleeting, their lights start to fade,
As a final glimmer of life withers away.

Dreams of scattered fate displayed, break and shatter in dismay.
Like candles to a flame, we melt our lives away.

Aeternum Vale.
Now remember the days when we were younger and coming of age.
Speak no more. Be at peace. My requiem is yours to keep.

Tempus edax rerum.
Obitus.
Rigor Mortis.

Tempus edax rerum. Aeternum Vale. [2x]

Eyes bone dry, a sure telling of age.
Cheating your life of it's days,,
As it's final glimmer of light withers away.

Turn the pages, their shadows overtake us.
It burns my eyes.
Stillness in patience, never to awaken.
Aeternum Vale.

Aeternum Vale.
Now remember the days, when we were younger and coming of age.
Speak no more. Be at peace. My requiem is yours to keep.

These lights have faded, I'm wasting away.
Too long I've waited, I've wasted away.

Tempus edax rerum. Aeternum Vale.

On and on;
Through my buried bones, my song lives on.
Through my buried bones, my song lives on.
