the fields, dead and silent begin to rise up from the earth
with their twisted appendages, suffocating all but myself.

A void of my own, floating in the clutches of my hand where I may pull at the
strings
of time and torment those who constantly dig and claw at the back my skull.

Summoning Storms. Wishing these days will pass, Tearing the earth apart.
Reweaving the threads of time so that they can shelter these malformations of
mine.

Tear the fucking earth apart
Tormented and frail, I begin to destroy your dreams. one by one.
I am the destroyer of dreams.

swallowing death, the sky cracks open and begins to flood,
washing away my fears, I plunge into an eternal darkness.
in the pitch black depths, I drown.
I wait for nothing and time is my witness. Time is my witness.

A void of my own, floating in the clutches of my hand where I may pull at the
strings
of time and torment those who constantly dig and claw at the back my skull.

Summoning Storms. Wishing these days will pass, Tearing the earth apart.
Reweaving the threads of time so that they can shelter these malformations of
mine.

I call forth the sleepless skies
herding forth the endless nights
summoning storms to shatter the absent minds
show the world the pain and suffering my eyes have seen
