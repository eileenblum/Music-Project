Shattered, the fragments of my life lay scattered,
engulfed beneath the shadows of my forever. I am broken, decrepit.

Lay this rose upon my tombstone
I shall not live by your lies

Only from the moisture of my rotting carcass shall I blossom

Mind controlled by hopeless affection, this affliction;
Affliction of the dead

As my lungs are slowly crushed 
Shattered, the fragments of my life lay scattered,
engulfed beneath the shadows of my forever. I am broken, decrepit.

As I sink beneath the shadows I find peace beneath the grave
And finally now, I can blossom
