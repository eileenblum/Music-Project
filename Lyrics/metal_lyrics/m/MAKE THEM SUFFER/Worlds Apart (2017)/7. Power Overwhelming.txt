Reborn into a plain renowned for ancient powers.
Reformed by alchemy and ways of age-old chemistry.
And with these blades I'm going to paint the town.
A prototype this strength was always in me.
It took a new plain to unlock beyond skin deep.
This is me without constraints or bounds;
You say that's what it's aboutâ¦
No it's not me,
I'm honoured but save the crown.
I think I want out, this isn't what I'm about.
No it's not me,
I'm worried I'll paint the town.
It's power overwhelming.
You're going to see less of me.
All the things that you confessed to me, our faith in one another; rest in peace.
Now you want to be left alone.
This was never to be set in stone.
Which you would've known, if you would check your phone.
Now I'm alive,
I've been made your device.
So put me on your shelf.
Put me on your shelf, with your most prized possessions.
So put me on your shelf.
Somehow I've told myself
I was reborn into a plain renowned for ancient powers.
Reformed by alchemy and ways of age-old chemistry.
And with these blades
I'm going to paint the town.
A prototype this strength was always in me.
It took a new plain to unlock beyond skin deep.
This is me without constraints or bounds;
You say that's what it's aboutâ¦
No it's not me,
I'm honoured but save the crown.
I think I want out, this isn't what I'm about.
No it's not me,
I'm worried I'll paint the town
It's power overwhelming
