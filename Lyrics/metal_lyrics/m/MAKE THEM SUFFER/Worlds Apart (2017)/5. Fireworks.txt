So long, goodbye. Because tonight I think I'm ready to go.
And so I'm praying you're still laying there and waiting when I'm finally home.
I had to do this for me, because it's all I know.

This time I'll make things right.
Come bring your flames, take my hand. We'll together watch it burn.

We're going to burn it to the ground,
And we'll be surfing on the sun.
Let's see them try to stop us now.
Let's watch them burn.
When we're through.
Trace it back. We'll remember who we used to be.
When we're through.
Don't hold back, don't forget that we were meant to be.
We'll both together watch it burn.
We'll both together watch it burn.

So hoist those sails we're headed east.
If there's a chance that when we're through they'll send me home.

This time I'll make things right.
Come bring your flames, take my hand. We'll together watch it burn.
We're going to burn it to the ground,
And we'll be surfing on the sun.
Let's see them try to stop us now.
Let's watch them burn.

When we're through;
All of the radiant flames reflecting off of my face,
And streaming down from my cheeks, they'll dance the night away.
When we're through;
We'll watch the fireworks.
I had to do this for me, because it's all that I know,
If there's even just a chance that when we're through they'll send me home.
