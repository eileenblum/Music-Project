Have I been keeping you sick?
Here's me believing a bleeding heart's just a quick fix.
All you needed was me, not my solutions or views.
I wish I could take all this pain back I've put you through.
I guess it's too little, too late.
At least I can assure you; I had the best intentions.

It's toxic, it's noxious. Ironically honest.
Get out tonight, don't say farewell.
Run for your life, go save yourself.
It's twisted, it's bitter. It's sickly sweet.
Get out alive, while there's still time.
And don't you dare even consider a "next time".

But through it all, you managed.
I left you bruised and battered,
Took you for granted, took advantage and vanished.
And you'd think that just for once in my life;
I'd take a step back and maybe consider what's on your mind.
But noâ¦

You're the strongest person I know.
At least I can assure you I'm afraid of my reflection.

It's toxic, it's noxious. Ironically honest.
Get out tonight, don't say farewell.
Run for your life, go save yourself.
It's twisted, it's bitter. It's sickly sweet.
Get out alive, while there's still time.
And don't you dare even consider a "next time".

You're the strongest person I know.
You're the strongest person I know.
You're the strongest person I know.
You're the strongest person I know.

I've never been one to express myself so directly, more with imagery and symbolism. Obscuring my faults behind a veil of metaphors and euphemisms. But just for one moment, I want to be open and honest. If we can't express ourselves directly and be prepared to expect negativity, then we'll surely crumble under the weight of our insecurities. To search yourself and come face to face with your demons is terrifying. But if we can't face them, then how do we grow? How do we recover, or know when we're wrong? And yes, it's okay to be wrong.

And I have been wrongâ¦ And I am wrongâ¦ And I am wrong! And this is me, and in all honesty I'm not doing so well right now, but at least I'm finding the courage to face myself. Self deprecating? Maybe. Self absorbed? Maybe. Bravery? Definitely. I'm so sorry for all the pain and heartache that I've caused you. I just want you to be happy in life. I'll come and watch from afar, and admire you and every bit of joy and success that comes your way. I know that this is for the best, but it's been the most difficult choice of my life. I did this for you, and knowing full well the consequences. This is me and my acceptance, all I ask is that you remember me as I walk away.
