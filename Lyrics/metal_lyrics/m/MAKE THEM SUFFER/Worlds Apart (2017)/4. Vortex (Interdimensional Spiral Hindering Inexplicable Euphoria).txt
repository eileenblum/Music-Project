Spiralling down, the void is pulling me. Twisting me.
Willingly, I'll abandon all I knew.
Circling. When I'm finally down the drain, I will see it differently.
Sadly that's the best I can do.

I think I've fallen apart.
Left only an empty dial tone.
I'm going back to the start.
Vortex completes the cycle.

It spat me down and out decrepit and weak,
A crippled mess as I was destined to be.
A shattered man for everybody to see.
Can't figure how to put this delicately soâ¦
So here we go...
Vortex completes the cycle.

Circling. When I'm finally down the drain, I will see it differently.
Sadly that's the best I can do.

I think I've fallen apart.
Left only an empty dial tone.
I'm going back to the start.
Vortex completes the cycle.

Down where the darkness reigns.
Unto the the deepest void.
Bone marrow heaves the weight
Of the unconscious world.
And we will find our place
Amongst the stains of old.
Our ancient ways reclaimed,
Hidden beneath the fold.

It spat me down and out decrepit and weak,
A crippled mess as I was destined to be.
A shattered man for everybody to see.
Can't figure how to put this delicately so...
So here we go...
Vortex completes the cycle.
