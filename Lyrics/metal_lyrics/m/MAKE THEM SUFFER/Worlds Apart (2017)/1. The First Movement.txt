There's a voice in the wind so familiar it sings him to sleep
And yet it's melody's so terribly empty
So the boy drops his pin and wind section instruments cling to the beat
And now together they ascend to an ending
Let's go

It was a beautiful song, the first of many to come
But meant the start of a bond, precious only to one

But the question remained and it plagued the boy's conscience for days
Who was this beautiful voice he kept hearing?
So he sat and he waited so patiently aching to say
That it was of her he'd been dreaming
Let's go

It was a beautiful song, the first of many to come
But meant the start of a bond, precious only to one

Patience, for she's heard you and it's only a matter of time
She's on her way to come get you and you're going to be just fine

She pulled up at the street lights
"Get in we're going for a ride
The walk's too long, you'll get there in half the time if you take a seat on the shotgun side."

She's in the palm of your hand [2x]

It was a beautiful song, the first of many to come
But meant the start of a bond, precious only to one

He sat and he gazed to the driver's seat, somehow afraid
Now it's the chance you've been waiting
Come now boy, at some point you would have to be brave
You should trust in yourself at least once in a while
If not today...

Up up
And now she's driving in circles [4x]

She's in the palm of your hand [2x]
It's now. Don't skip on your chance
It's time. Don't skip on your chance [2x]
But what the future holds no one knows...
