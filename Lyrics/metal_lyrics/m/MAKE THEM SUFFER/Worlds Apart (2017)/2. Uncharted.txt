To find yourself in a digital realm, abandon your physical form
To lose oneself is to find oneself; until which, you would hunger for more

So now we plunge through the clouds, with the cosmos above us
Let's do the darkest of bounds, with only stars to guide us

(Eyes open wide)
Radiant and bright, in painted coloured lines
A new plain lies inside us
(Now my soul glows inside)
Luminous the guides, that glimmer in the skies
Now unchained with only lights to guide us

So now we plunge through the clouds, with the cosmos above us
Let's do the darkest of bounds, with only stars to guide us

Deep inside us
Listen closely, let the darkness guide us
Deep inside us
Sometimes it's the scars on our hearts that drives us

It's fine to stay, if that's what you wanted

Uncharted
(Eyes open wide)
Radiant and bright, in painted coloured lines
A new plain lies inside us
(Now my soul glows inside)
Luminous the guides, that glimmer in the skies
Now unchained with only lights to guide us
To find yourself in a digital realm, abandon your physical form
To lose oneself is to find oneself; until which, you would hunger for more
