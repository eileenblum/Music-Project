Tape; stop. Play
So turn it up on your tape controls
And move your bones to the sound of the radio
Just leave a message,
I'm with all my friends
She's on hold, the TelePrompter's spelling out your name
Prepare to lose control
Take the call.
She wants to take you to a higher place
I'm booked out for the week
And I'm grinding teeth
Just leave a message
I'm out, but I'm coming back
I'm grinding teeth
I think it's starting to get bad.
I'm coming back
With the drippings from the sky...
She's on hold, the TelePrompter's spelling out your name
Prepare to lose control
Take the call.
She wants to take you to a higher place
I'm booked out for the week
Time has taken its toll
It's time to answer this call
It's time to answer this call
Let's go
And I'm grinding teeth
Just leave a message
I'm out, but I'm coming back
I'm grinding teeth
I think it's starting to get bad.
I'm coming back
