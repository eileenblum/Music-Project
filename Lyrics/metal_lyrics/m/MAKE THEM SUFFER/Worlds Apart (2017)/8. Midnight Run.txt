Darling, I'll make you proud.
I've been working myself down to the bone.
And painting this dream I've found;
This is a fucking house and this is not a home.
No, this is not a home.
Down at the theatre you're saving my seat.
And it's the play we've both been waiting to see.
But I'm out tonight, I'm caving and weak.
The curtains are drawn, the lights come on.
You'll have to watch it alone.
And it was midnight run.
In a way we both experienced one.
It was a midnight run.
In a way we bothâ¦
Darling I'll make you proud.
I've been working myself down to the bone.
And painting this dream I've found;
This is a fucking house and this is not a home.
No, this is not a home.
Honesty found.
Just promise me now you'd want to be around after the midnight run.
I know this is how it ends, but I can't leave my friends.
Now I can't think of the words, but it was something about a means to an end.
Darling I'll make you proud.
I've been working myself down to the bone.
And painting this dream I've found;
This is a fucking house and this is not a home.
No, this is not a home.
