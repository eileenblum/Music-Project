[Lyrics by:Fabrizio / Music by: Alex/ Andrea]

Like a rose in bloom among the clouds
A precious ruby flaring on celestial canvas
Vermilion magma
Carpet of fire, incandescent petals

Drowsy sun lies down in a blood red sea
A scarlet shroud in front of me
Igneous flag
Rusty water lilies float on wine

Twilight is nothing but a blazing red dream
A burning fresco work of art in magenta
Duskier moth shall looms out of crimson winds
To hang with black the sky

Dark wings in stanched red coral lymph
Battlefield drenched with blood
Majestic slaughter
Dusky sheeps graze on cerise meadow

Zephyrus breeze
Ridden by pollen
Spreads an ecstatic stardust
Flowers close
Leaves dance
The end of a gothic romance

Crepuscularia agony in red minor
Crepuscularia set the sky on fire
Crepuscularia agony in red minor
Crepuscularia black curtain drops

Venetian red bridal bed sheets
Indigo veils upon brilliant golden eye
Skyborn chrysalid
Violet veins painted on prussian blue sky

Zephyrus breeze
Ridden by pollen
Spreads an ecstatic stardust
Flowers close
Leaves dance
The end of a gothic romance

Crepuscularia agony in red minor
Crepuscularia set the sky on fire
Crepuscularia agony in red minor
Crepuscularia black curtain drops

Darkness smothered
Dying murrey whines
Spreading dark seeds
Among sunset remains

A war chant rises
Upon the grave
Infernal challange
Heavenly grace
