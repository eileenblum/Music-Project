[Lyrics by:Fabrizio / Music by: Alex/ Andrea]

I've found the rarest thing in the world
A strange fascinating light
It doesn't shine
But it perfumes like a flower
Growing everywhere and somewhere

Pure treasure
Like a pearl of dew
Innocent diadem
Of a divine crown

Its name is the name of a wind
With an enchanted breath
The flap of an angel's wings
A flower growing everywhere and somewhere
