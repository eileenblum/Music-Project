[Lyrics by:Fabrizio / Music by: Alex/ Andrea]

Crystalline pearls are falling
On fresh leafy branches
Like soft emerald carillon
Tune up a faint damp refrain

Earth drinks the angels weeping
Poisonous essence dripping
Flora shelters the sprouting jewels
Crescendo of swarming tears

Rain streams from a grey flock
Freezing arrows through the air
As sparkling shell embraces the soil
Greenish parfumes ravish birds' voice

Musk viola solo gently whispers
A sea green âcello plaintive theme
Twinkling arpeggios herbaceous tunes
Sonata for leaves and trees

Oh Green Orchestra lull my weary heart refresh my arid soul
Oh Green Orchestra your charming fragrance tastes of love like her ebony eyes

Pelting diamonds make forest precious
Instruments in bloom
Flash of blaze almighty growl
Cascade of glittering splinters

Musk viola solo gently whispers
A sea green âcello plaintive theme
Twinkling arpeggio herbaceous tunes
Sonata for leaves and trees

Oh Green Orchestra lull my weary heart refresh my arid soul
Oh Green Orchestra your charming fragrance taste of love like her ebony eyes

Stillano in perle di cristallo
I vani sogni d'illusi cuori incantati
E s'infrangon sbocciando in languide voci
Dai profumi fatati
L'orchestra di smeraldo lontano sussurra
Brilla
E poi
Muore.
