[Lyrics by: Fabrizio / Music by: Alex / Andrea]

Freedom wings as precious as slim
How many times were broken?
Poor in spirit overbearing
Sentenced exception to death

Stifled cries
Implored grey skies
Purification of fire
Heretical you're guilty!
Confess, abjure
We'll save at least your soul

Haeresis dea
Your time has come
Kneel and ask for mercy
Don't scream, don't cry
Never say die!
Who preaches peace will never kill

Haeresis dea
Shouts rent the air
Raise your eyes to heaven
Pray to suffer the torments of hell
Can one be cruel in the name of faith?

White queen
Shows her usual smile
To hide bloody thorns
From her slaves believers

Stifled cries
Implored grey skies
Purification of fire
Heretical you're guilty!
Confess, abjure
We'll save at least your soul

Haeresis dea
Your time has come
Kneel and ask for mercy
Don't scream, don't cry
Never say die!
Who preaches peace will never kill

Haeresis dea
Shouts rent the air
Raise your eyes to heaven
Pray to suffer the torments of hell
Can one be cruel in the name of faith?

You stand accused for practising witchcraft!
Do you confess?

I beg your pardon
My tears don't lie
Oh please forgive me!
I don't know why...
I'm here...
Am I forgiven?
Don't lay the blame on me
If frost ruined all your crops
Torture it... I feel faint

Guilty
Witch

Haeresis dea was burnt at the stake
With thousands raped souls in bliss
