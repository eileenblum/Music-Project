Every day that goes by
Is dead and gone
Every step along the way
Fades to grey

Don't include me in your dreams
I'm dead and gone
Every single moment dies

Never enough
And the point if there is one
Never enough
Is that all precious time goes by

Don't include me in your dreams
We're dead and gone
Every single moment dies

Never enough
And the point if there is one
Never enough
Is that all precious time goes by

Never enough
You will wake up one day
Never enough
But it will be too late
