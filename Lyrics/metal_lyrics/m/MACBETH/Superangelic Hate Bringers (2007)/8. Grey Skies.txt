We could forget the world outside
If you don't care
Skies are grey but rooms are blue
Safe place to hide
You have to know that silence kills
More than the steel
These are my final words to you

If you wake up tonight
Say it now
In the heat of the night
Grey skies
While screams knock your door
Say it now
Leave your doubt behind
Grey skies

If you don't want to live a lie
If things just feel so wrong once more
Don't hide behind your stupid pride
And say what's wrong

We could forget the blood outside
If you don't care
Streets are cold but the fire warms
These solid walls
You have to know that pride will kill
More than the steel
These are my final words to you

If you wake up tonight
Say it now
In the heat of the night
Grey skies
While screams knock your door
Say it now
Leave your doubt behind
Grey skies

If you don't want to live a lie
If things just feel so wrong once more
Don't hide behind your stupid pride
And say what's wrong

Here is my blood
Until I die
Until we die
