Hey there
You have been so kind to me
You don't know
I will break your heart in two

You got a strange kind of attitude
I hurt you so bad many times
And you said "I forgive you"
I guess you're wrong
Why can't you see?
We always lie to gain
It's the nature of the beast

Here there's no god

Don't pretend to
be my boring guardian angel
Don't pretend to
be my boring guardian angel

Hey you
Stare through my eyes to see
You don't know
What flows behind my glance

You got a strange kind of attitude
I hurt you so bad many times
And you said "I forgive you"
I guess you're wrong
Why can't you see?
We always lie to gain
It's the nature of the beast

Here there's no god

Don't pretend to
be my boring guardian angel
Don't pretend to
be my boring guardian angel
