You'll burn in hell
Don't be afraid
Our voice will fade
And they'll take you away
Don't try to pray
Just dig a grave
With every rose we'll get ten thorns
This plastic fable lies
This cancer blooms by night
Don't search the answers to every "why?"
Just watch us die

Never mind
It's our plastic fable
You can run
But there's nowhere to escape

You wonder why
Truth bites our heart
Seductive plans
Must melt the scorn
Don't try to say
Life's like a game
With every rose we'll get ten thorns
This plastic fable lies
This cancer blooms by night
Don't search the answers to every "why?"
Just watch us die

Never mind
It's our plastic fable
You can run
But there's nowhere to escape
