All the hate they spread
Can't change our mind
Truth is everywhere
Blind men cannot see it

All the lies they spread
Bring us black rain
And freedom slowly fades
In a cloud of pure shame

Can't you see the shining face of the sun?
You never want to feel
You never want to feel so low
I've said
I've said
You never want to feel
You never want to feel so low

World is going down
Our reign is bleeding dark
Ignorance now rules
We are victims of our sad games

So many reasons why
We don't believe in smiles
And freedom slowly fades
In a cloud of pure shame

Can't you see the shining face of the sun?
You never want to feel
You never want to feel so low
I've said
I've said
You never want to feel
You never want to feel so low
