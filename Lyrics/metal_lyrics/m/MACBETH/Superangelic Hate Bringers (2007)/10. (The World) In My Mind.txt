The world tries to put me down
Everything I do for you is wrong
I can't believe life's so complex
I can never get too much of a wonderful thing

The world has a funny way of a sneaking up on me
Help me forget

You promised me everything
I'm looking for the real life
You are always in my mind
I'll need you till I die
You promised me through thick and thin
I'm waiting better days
You'll always in my mind
Because I'm dying

You have lived so many lives
Please, give me what I'm asking for
Sometimes life is so unkind
But for me and for you a new day is calling

The world has a funny way of a sneaking up on me
Help me forget

You promised me everything
I'm looking for the real life
You are always in my mind
I'll need you till I die
You promised me through thick and thin
I'm waiting better days
You'll always in my mind
Because I'm dying

You'll always in my mind
Big bad love / I need a love with an attitude
Will you keep on lovin' me?
You'll always in my mind
We have better things to do
