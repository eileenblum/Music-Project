Too many ways to die so young
Too many times we smell sweet lies
Another one promises the moon
Another king who steals our sky

I take the time to break the circle
Through dark nights
I'll find my way
I take the time to break the circle
Feeling fine
I'll find my way

Too many emotions trapped in a cage
Too many ways to loose the game
Another virus infected men
Another queen who rules our eyes

I take the time to break the circle
Through dark nights
I'll find my way
I take the time to break the circle
Feeling fine
I'll find my way
