[Lyrics by: Vittorio Manara / Music by: Macbeth]

Shadows are walking in 
the darkness of a promised 
heaven 
like spirits in a dark and 
lonely castle, 
they are dancing at a song 
of a myriad of voices 
with the stares lost in a 
secret dimension. 
Shadows are crying in the 
immensity of a gloomy 
night, 
holding in their own all 
their consuming sorrow 
They seem forgotten in the 
heavenly garden, 
forsaken in the misery of a 
place without time. 
"Abd shines the light of hope 
in their eyes no more and no 
emotion will pass through 
their heart" 
Shadows imprisoned 
between dream and reality 
in silently wait for a 
solemn recall, 
they look for consolation in 
the pale light of god, 
in a kingdom in which all 
is eternal.
