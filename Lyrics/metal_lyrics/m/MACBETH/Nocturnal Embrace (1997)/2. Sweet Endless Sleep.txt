[Lyrics by: Vittorio Manara / Music by: Macbeth]

Like a spell from which i 
can't awake now i sleep 
soundly, 
dying in your arms, i felt 
your tears glide on my face 
and your hands hold mine 
for the last time, 
the angel of mystery is 
here to lead me in the king- 
dom of silence. 
We are immersed in a 
boundless sea of sorrow 
death is the darkened hori- 
zon we'll reach in our 
wreck, 
sweet is my rest like a kiss 
of the woman i loved 
and now her heart is veiled 
with a cloud of sadness. 
You'll close my weary 
eyes languishing and resi- 
gned and petals of withered 
roses will settle on my 
weak body as tears 
i'll rove forever on the 
banks of the oblivion's river 
bur i'll hear your mounded 
heart cry for me. 
"..and my tears will furrow my 
cheeks and will rush in the 
endless ebony abyss of 
torment."
