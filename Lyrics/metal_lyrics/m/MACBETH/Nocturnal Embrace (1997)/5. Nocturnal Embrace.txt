[Lyrics by: Vittorio Manara / Music by: Macbeth]

Light is disappearing, dark 
is closing in upon me, 
In front of my eyes a 
new sunset, 
another day is dying 
between my arms 
and the night rises 
caressing my face. 
A nocturnal embrace holds 
me to itself 
like two lovers, escaping 
from glances 
Lost in the darkness, 
surrounded by silence, 
through the oceans of time, 
we'll fly away. 
And the stars in the sky 
will look us 
while the wind will blow 
among the last leaves, 
my soul will dance lighted 
by a pale moon and an 
overture will accompany 
my steps.
