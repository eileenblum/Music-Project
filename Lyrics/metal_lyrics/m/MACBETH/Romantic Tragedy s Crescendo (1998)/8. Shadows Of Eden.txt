[Lyrics by: Vittorio - Music by: Alex]
[Arranged by: Fabrizio, Alex, Andrea]

Shadows are walking in
the darkness of a promised heaven
like spirits in a dark and lonely castle,
they are dancing at a song
of a myriad of voices
with the stares lost in a
secret dimension. 
Shadows are crying in the
immensity of a gloomy night,
holding in their own all
their consuming sorrow
they seem forgotten in the
heavenly garden,
forsaken in the misery of a
place without time. 
And shines the light of hope
in their eyes no more and no
emotion will pass through their heart. 
shadows imprisoned
betweendream and reality
in silently wait for a
solemn recall,
they look for consolation
in the pale light of god,
in a kingdom in which all
is eternal.
