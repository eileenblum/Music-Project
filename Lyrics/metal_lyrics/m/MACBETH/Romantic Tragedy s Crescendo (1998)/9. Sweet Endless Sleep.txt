[Lyrics by: Vittorio - Music by: Alex]
[Arranged by: Fabrizio, Alex, Andrea]

Like a spell from which I
can't awake now I sleep soundlly,
dying in your arms, I felt
your tears glide on my face
and your hands hold mine
for the last time,
the angel of mystery is 
here to lead me in the kingdom
of silence. 
we are immersed in a
boundless sea of sorrow
death is the darkened
horizon we'll reach in our wreck,
sweet is my rest like a kiss
of the woman I loved
and now her heart is veiled
with a cloud of sadness. 
You'll close my weary
eyes languishing and resigned
and petals of withered roses
will settle on my weak body as tears
I'll rove forever on the 
banks of the oblivition's river
but I'll hear your wounded
heart cry for me. 
...And my tears will furrow my
cheeks and will rush in the
endless abony abyss of torment.
