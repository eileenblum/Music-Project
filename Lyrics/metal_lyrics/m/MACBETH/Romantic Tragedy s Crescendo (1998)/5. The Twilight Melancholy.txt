[Lyrics by: Vittorio - Music by: Alex]
[Arranged by: Fabrizio, Alex]

The arms of twilight
are dandling my soul
and in her eyes
I see the sweetness
of a bright immortal-graced maiden
who relieves the grieves of my heart. 
Wind is whispering your name
throught the clouds in the sky.
I will always remember your eyes
veiled by tears
while the night prelude
casted a spell on our glances. 
The eyes of the dying sun
are looking at me
in this romantic immensity
an I can feel this melancholy
pervading deep inside me. 
Twilight is whispering your name
to the clouds in the sky.
I will never forget your heart
beating over mine
and your passion heating my bosom. 
...And when butterflies fly on
whitered flowers
and birds perch on dry brances
a tear will glide to your feet
and I will hold it in my hand
like a pearl in its shell.
