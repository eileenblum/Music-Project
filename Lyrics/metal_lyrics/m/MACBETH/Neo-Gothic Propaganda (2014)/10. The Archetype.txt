Will I survive this implosion?
You left at dawn
Without talking
Beyond control
My blood is boiling
But life goes on
Rust will embrace our hearts

Forever is a lie
One day you'll cry
All that is born will die
Just wait

'Cause I
I've got to let you know
You broke my heart
And I don't want to lose control
Love falls apart
When dreams fall down on cold
Ground

In these days of cold
You freeze my fire
The dream is gone
In a moment
Inside my veins
Deadly poison
Is this the end
Of our cold romance?

Forever is a lie
One day you'll cry
All that is born will die
Just wait

'Cause I
I've got to let you know
You broke my heart
And I don't want to lose control
Love falls apart
When dreams fall down on cold
Ground
