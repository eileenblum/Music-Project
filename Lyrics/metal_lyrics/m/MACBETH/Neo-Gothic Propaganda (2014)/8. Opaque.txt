Lost words
Floating on the black room
They know what we dream
I wrote
Projects of renewed hope
In a line of red sand
No more
Memories and sorrow
I won't fear my plans

Beware
Of what is not said
Never look back
It's me again

I'm going through sleepless nights
I feel shivers
Running down my spine
While rage is burning up my eyes
Believe me and don't think twice
I'm going sleepless nights
Remember of what we left behind
Be careful and open up your eyes
Forgive me and don't think twice

Teardrops
Melting fading writings
They want steal our life
You wait
Clear words and love letters
That you'll never receive
Stand up
And shout my name in silence
Don't be afraid

Beware
Of what is not said
Never look back
It's me again

I'm going through sleepless nights
I feel shivers
Running down my spine
While rage is burning up my eyes
Believe me and don't think twice
I'm going sleepless nights
Remember of what we left behind
Be careful and open up your eyes
Forgive me and don't think twice

I'll never look back
I want you to say
I'll never look back
If you want a solution
Never look back
