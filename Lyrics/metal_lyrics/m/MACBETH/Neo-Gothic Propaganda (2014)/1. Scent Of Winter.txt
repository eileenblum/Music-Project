Snowflakes descend upon
This frozen river of blood
And winter comes once more
To bring us fear and pain
Itâs time for answers now
Itâs time to heal our pride

And now the world is turning grey
Hope is gone in a day
Welcome to the place where sun is cold
Where the birds will never sing
The ground will warm our frozen bones
But too late
Here comes the death

The fog devours our path
We lose our will to live
The season of doubt has come
And stars are falling down
Itâs time for answers now
Itâs time to heal our pride

And now the world is turning grey
Hope is gone in a day
Welcome to the place where sun is cold
Where the birds will never sing
The ground will warm our frozen bones
But too late
Here comes the death

(Weâre slowly fading like the dew
Gently staying for a while
Making precious what is crude
Sic transit gloria mundi
From the cradle to the grave)
