These empty words
You shout to celebrate yourself
Our daily dose of lies
Will lead us to Hell

Half truths and fears
You spit on people everyday
Our faith is built on lies
You'll lead us to Hell

Time has come to an end
You must pay for your crimes

I can't wait for things to start
Like a little spark in the dark
I can't stand waiting anymore
Like a little spark in the dark

Repression flows
While gold is running through your veins
Our blood is on your hands
You'll lead us to Hell

Have never end
When crowd goes wild you fear the fall
Power in our hands
We'll lead you to Hell

Time has come to an end
You must pay for your crimes

I can't wait for things to start
Like a little spark in the dark
I can't stand waiting anymore
Like a little spark in the dark
