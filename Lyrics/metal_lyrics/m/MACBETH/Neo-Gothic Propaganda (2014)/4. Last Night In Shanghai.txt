I feel the breeze
The beat of my heart
I don't want to see the end
Of our dream
Fragile
Like a feather in the wind
Nothing to say
Nowhere to hide
In a moment, lost in time
Your hands, your eyes
Seem to tell me that we're dying

Hearts are full of sorrow
We cannot do this anymore
There's no tomorrow
We cannot do this anymore

Lie to me
Don't wake me up and please just
Lie to me
Don't break the spell
'Till morning comes
Lie to me
Don't wake me up and please just
Lie to me
Don't break the spell
'Till morning comes

The sound of regret
Has the scent of a tear
Have you ever wondered why
Love fades
Trust dies
In a place where there's no pride
Don't care about pain
Don't care about shame
There is something dying inside
Just hold me tight
Please don't tell me we're dying

Hearts are full of sorrow
We cannot do this anymore
There's no tomorrow
We cannot do this anymore

Lie to me
Don't wake me up and please just
Lie to me
Don't break the spell
'Till morning comes
Lie to me
Don't wake me up and please just
Lie to me
Don't break the spell
'Till morning comes
