I've been watching you
Living your life between two worlds
Desert and sky
Everything
You've been searching for
Is always far from you

I've been teaching you
How to survive the demons
Of your fragile mind
You know the rules
You know the price
One simple choice
Could simple change your life

But there's a place
A silent place
Where you find the answers
Where you can paint
Your life with stars
Don't make me promise
Please let me stay there now
I'm floating on my paradise

I've been watching you
Wasting your time
Among false prophets telling lies
Follow my steps, do what I did
Search for your answers
Towards light

I pray for you
And if the path you take
I snot the one you should
I will be there
Don't say a word
I will be there and that's for sure

But there's a place
A silent place
Where you find the answers
Where you can paint
Your life with stars
Don't make me promise
Please let me stay there now
I'm floating on my paradise

I don't care of being just like you
