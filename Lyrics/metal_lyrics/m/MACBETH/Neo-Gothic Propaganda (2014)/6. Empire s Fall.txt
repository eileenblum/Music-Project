When freedom fades to grey
We gather in the darkness
Frustration make us weak
But revolution grows

Just look into my eyes
Don't try to tell me what to say
Lust look into my eyes
The seal is broken and we want blood

Forever against
false hopes and fears
Whatever we do
We gotta be free
Together we'll change
This world of tears
Wherever we are
We gotta be free

When winds of chaos blow
Beware of propaganda
They'll never stop this rage
Until the empire's fall

Just look into my eyes
Don't try to tell me what to say
Lust look into my eyes
The seal is broken and we want blood

Forever against
false hopes and fears
Whatever we do
We gotta be free
Together we'll change
This world of tears
Wherever we are
We gotta be free
