If you knew your life would end in two days
What would you do?
My friend
Life is like a wheel
You can live or die
We're like leaves on the trees
When wind blows out a candle
We stare and wait
Wait 'till tomorrow comes
Every single frame
Of your life's pearl
Shining on dark days
Every single scare
A thorn on your crown
Why must we live this way?

Slow motion tragedies
Need time to stop and think
Light up your darkness now
if you can't stop
You're gonna get hurt

It's all about your choices and
All your mistakes of yesterday
This is the calm before the storm
You have to look behind the words
When dreams collapse
And you feel the thrill
Take a deep breath
Time never stand still
This is the price
This is the will
This is a place where slowness could kill

Have you ever had
Doubts about your faith?
The flame is fading out
Walking on the edge
You follow trails of hope
But now is your turn to fall
When wind blows out a candle
We stare and wait
Wait 'till tomorrow comes
Every single day
Every second gone
Just steps you have to take
Time is running out
World is falling down
You're lost without a guide

Slow motion tragedies
Need time to stop and think
Light up your darkness now
if you can't stop
You're gonna get hurt

It's all about your choices and
All your mistakes of yesterday
This is the calm before the storm
You have to look behind the words
When dreams collapse
And you feel the thrill
Take a deep breath
Time never stand still
This is the price
This is the will
This is a place where slowness could kill
