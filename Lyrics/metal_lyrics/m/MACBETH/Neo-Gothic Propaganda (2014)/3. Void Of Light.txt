...Then it dies all together
'Cause everything is wrong
So there you are all on your own
To realize your loss

Feel every beat of your heart
The delicate sound of your sighs
Imagine that there's only dark
Seasons with no sense at all

Void of light begins with pain
Void of light is in your tears
Void of light is when you cry for grief
You can't go on another day
But believe a new light will shine

...Then it goes even deeper
It's a never ending fall
You felt the bite of loneliness
You're fading over time

Feel every beat of your heart
The delicate sound of your sighs
Imagine that there's only dark
Seasons with no sense at all

Void of light begins with pain
Void of light is in your tears
Void of light is when you cry for grief
You can't go on another day
But believe a new light will shine
