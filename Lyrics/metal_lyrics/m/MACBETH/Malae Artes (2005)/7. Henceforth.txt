[Lyrics by: Fabrizio]

The best dream I ever had
Floating on the liars blood
I came to the throne
And my reign was made of glass
And mirrors that reflected souls
Built upon the tomb of falsehood
Be warned
Henceforth
Everyone will pay for lies
With his own life
Less is more
Never mind what people say
Precious words
Silence is golden
In this masked world
Double cross empire
Have I any hope?
And the crown was my third eye
Shining like the morning star
Blinded enemies
My sharp tongue against their swords
Mirrors that reflected souls
Built upon the grave of honesty
