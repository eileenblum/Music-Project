[Lyrics by: Fabrizio]

Now throw those wings away
The sky is so far from earth
Remember me my son
When light fades
Sometimes truth chains our dreams
And we are crushed by the burden of time
While our aimless life
Flows towards the dark
Hope
Lifelong hope
Cruel sad joke
Die by hope
One day you'll realize that all is wrong
Remember me my son
When light fades
To learn to fly you must first crawl
And beg to the end
It's so easy but
No one will understand
