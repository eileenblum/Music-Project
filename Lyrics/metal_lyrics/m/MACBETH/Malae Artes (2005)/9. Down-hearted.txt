[Lyrics by: Fabrizio]

The marks I'm bearing
Are so deep
As deep as the sea
A sea of hate
Trust is a deadly snakebite
That rips your soul in two
Heal my wound
Relight my fire
Embrace me by my desire
Everything you know is wrong
Gloomy thoughts
Down-hearted
The stars I've prayed
Are falling down
Down in the sea
A sea of hate
Love is a scentless spell
That breaks your heart in two
