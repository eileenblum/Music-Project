[Lyrics by: Morena]

Nothing to blame myself for
Not letting you ruin me
To young to know your dark nature
You have gone to far
Asking with bad grace you caught with no mercy
I wept with pain
Fearing your dirty deeds
I suffer the pains of hell
My tears didn't move your heart
I kept the secret locked in my mind
Suffering
Crying
Lying
Screaming
Growing up without malice
I saved my life and my soul
Now I'm the mistress of all my dreams
I promised but I didn't keep the secret
I don't cry anymore I dream
I don't lie anymore I live
I don't scream anymore I sing
