Fell from the grace of heaven's prow
Listening as the abyss calls our name
Descending stars from golden clouds
Falling to the rage of angels
Bringer of light from on high
Bound to the earth and unable to fly...

I don't know
I don't know
I don't know

How can heaven love me

You don't know
You don't know
You don't know

How can heaven love you
We loved in a time before the fall
Welcome to the arms of solitude
Beneath us the heat that hearts exude
Is this really heaven?
We'd fight with the gods for our dreams
Where paradise falls eternity screams

I don't know
I don't know
I don't know

How can heaven love me

You don't know
You don't know
You don't know

How can heaven love you
