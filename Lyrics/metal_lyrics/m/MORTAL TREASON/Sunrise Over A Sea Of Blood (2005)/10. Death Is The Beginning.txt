I love You
You're my all
I will bow down before
You
You're my God
My everything
When I fall You pick me up
You've always been there
You always will
I spit in Your face, You wash my feet
I drive nails into Your hands
Broken is Your heart because
You're pushed away
Can't we understand?
Broken is the groom who mourns for his dying bride, for their eyes to open once again
I want to see You in my life

I want to know You're in my heart
I want to touch
You and be free
I want to fell You
Open my eyes let me see what You see and what You feel
Break my heart; make me desire more of You in my life
Let me know what it means to leave this world behind
Christ forgive me for running from You
I will give You all my life
Take it away now
Take this broken man

Take this tired spirit and renew me now
Renew me
Jesus, I love You
You are my true love
Let my tears clean Your feet and heal Your broken heart

Here's my life
Here's my heart
Take it away with
You
Take it away

"A straight forward praise to our Creator for all He is."
