Awake to a demon's cry
Looking up to a darkened sky

Seems like all that's good has died
Just trying one last time
Fight hard, yet losing the war

Standing so weathered and sore
We know the end is near
Yes, Hell is upon us
Doubt seeping in
From light to darkness, my world falls apart
Losing faith, losing heart
For the angel of darkness, he has come with sadness and oppression
Hatred is born

Through our weakness the angel gets in through which salvation is gone

"About the process of backsliding or the spiritual
view of neglecting God, and what will happen if we do."
