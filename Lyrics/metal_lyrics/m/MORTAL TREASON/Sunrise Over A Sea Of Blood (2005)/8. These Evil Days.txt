Read the words of prophecy
See the fate of this world
Hear the cries of mankind
Ignore the pain

Watch them die
Pushed aside no one cares
Out of site, out of mind

Why must we kill the one we love and why do the ones we love put knives in our backs
Looking at all this hate, so many hearts, they're all black
It's these evil days
A time will come
We'll be tested
I know what I believe
I know
So put a knife to my throat and put a gun to my head
Take my life
I still win with faith, with truth in my heart

"The world has become crazy and we must know what we
believe and stand strong in that even till death."
