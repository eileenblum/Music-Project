Stop running from your pain
Open your eyes
All I do seems meaningless
Still I try
Every day my heart breaks for you
My heart breaks everyday
I won't let go
I won't let you go
I know you hurt
I see you breaking down
Yet hope is found in a broken heart
Yes hope is found when your heart breaks
Your heart breaks

"This song is very special to us.
It's about a loved one who has fallen deep into drugs
or any of the dark things of this world that pull them away from all that is good...
and the fight to bring them back."
