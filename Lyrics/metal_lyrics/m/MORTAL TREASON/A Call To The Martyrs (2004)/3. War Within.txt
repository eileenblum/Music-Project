Stand, stand up, stand up.
Salute Him as your king The Lord who reigns over heaven and over earth.
Yea,ï¿½ you can't ignore it.
Why, it's in your head.
Now, you can't forget it.
Why, it's all been said.
Pushing,ï¿½ it's coming.
Rising, laughing in my face.
My head is spinning.
Lord help me please.
I need you now.
Come into my life.
The time stops.
It rises.
Now is your time.
He suffered for your sins.
He'll suffer again.
He suffered.
He suffered.
Now I feel it racing in my mind.
Stop it.
You can't take this inside.
Why do you run and hide?
His blood it flows freely from His hands tonight.
Take it or leave it.
True love is hard to find.
