Love kisses me on the cheek.
Taken my weakness away.
Weeping for these gone astray, for the lost.
For the souls, I cry out to you.
Please pull me through.
I love you.
You are my all.
You came unto me to set me free.
Won't you set me free tonight?
I feel your love tonight.
For it lies in the wind of change.
Accept it now.
For it may never come again.
For all things change.
Except his love.
It remains the same.
You came up to me to set me free.
I love you.
You are my all.
Now you are all I need in this life.
I feel your love.
I feel your love as it passes in my mind.
An ever present peace that reigns.
Now is the time.
Run for your life.
Accept the Lord into your heart.
