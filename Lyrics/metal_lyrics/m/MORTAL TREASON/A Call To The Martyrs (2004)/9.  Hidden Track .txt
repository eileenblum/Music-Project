Show me, your ways teach me, to love
This world can be so cold
It's hard to find one who cares

Show me your there
Show me you care
whipe my tears away
take my pain

I just wanna Take this time to just let you know
That no matter what you're going through in this life
That Jesus Christ he is always there,
He's always there to stand by your side,
He's a friend that will never walk away,
He's a father that will never turn his back,
I just wanna incourage you right now
No matter what your situation is
Just reach your arms up and just call out on him
He'll always be there...
All he wants is your attention for you to love him back,
He needs us, just as we need him.
