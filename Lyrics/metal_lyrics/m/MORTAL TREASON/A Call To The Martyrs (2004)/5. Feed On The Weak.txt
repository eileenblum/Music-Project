Deception is your name.
I cried out for your hand.
All I see is your foot in my face holding me down, down on the ground.
I fall to my knees to praise my Savior.
Your eyes are so cold, your hands stained with the blood of children.
So you think you can hold me down forever.
I will rise and fight till my last breath.
You put me down to make yourself feel better.
The time has come.
I'll stand up.
Fight for Christ.
He is all I have.
I will stand for my King.
I'll praise him every day.
Rumors of men in the night, coming to take my life.
They came and took your life.
Rise again from these ashes and fight.
Fight forever.
We'll stand every day to praise His name on high.
I will stand and fight forever.
I will stand and fight forever more.
In this life, you can't take it.
You're not real.
You can't prove you're.
You're wrong.
