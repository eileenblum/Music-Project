Rise rotten corpses from your graves and meet Him in the sky.
Leave life's burdens behind.
I want to die.
Take my life.
I want to die to be alive.
I can't take this life, living in this lie.
Come take me away with you tonight.
Come take me away with you to die.
Lord sacrifice me to bring you glory.
Take me.
Make me a warrior.
I have stood your test.
If I can't go home with you, I will stand and fight.
I've been through hell and back.
I know you are the only way to life.
Look in my eye and see the way to freedom is through the Son.
Take His hand.
He will save you from your casket life.
Your church can be your casket.
