Farewell to youthful innocence
The last ray of light passes over me
I am freed from the chains forced upon me by a sleeping society
Freedom
Misery is freedom
Yet I cry
As I sail into a lonesome darkness feared by many, yet treasured by some
I am unaware that I am entering the first stages of a great enlightenment which must crush my soul before it can awaken it
Doomed to see salvation
Oh, how great a contradiction my life is to become
This journey has just begun
