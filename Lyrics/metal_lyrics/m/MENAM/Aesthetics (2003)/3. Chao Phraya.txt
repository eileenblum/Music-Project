I remember the faces
That looked at me when Suffering was there
I remember destruction

Of families and my own children

No, I could not take a breath
I could not make any movements
But my hatred was becoming louder

Now, I fall !

The death is around me
I can't help looking at it
I hear crying
And I can see the tears
I am afraid
I would like to be so far

Please destroy my brain !

A fight in my mind
Light the way for me now

Let me see the truth in this evil

I can't understand why I am still alive
There's nothing around me that can hear my cry
I walk in the dark, now I walk towards death
Looking for a soul that can be relieved
The man with the scythe can come to take me

'cause now I am ready to join my real family

A fight in my mind
Light the way for me now

Let me see the truth in this evil

I can't understand why I am still alive
There's nothing around me that can hear my cry ...
