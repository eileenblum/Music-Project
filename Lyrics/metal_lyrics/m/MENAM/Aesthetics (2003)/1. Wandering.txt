Driving lonely
Imploring spirits of my destiny
As far as my car can go
My mind will follow

Too much distance

Between me and reality

Today I try to understand
Why my crash did not become pain
Hollows of jigsaw remind me

That I wasn't really guilty

All this story was so strange
Through characters of nightmare
I had to go away

Saving myself from decay

This background voice
Irritating my conscience
" The fault lies with you !"
Continually haunt my sleep
Can't remember exactly
Those awful events -
"We've met before, haven't we ?" said by

A ghastly mouth of hell

Carried away on a road
Without exit, without end
Sparkling mirror of desolation

My life, dark fog leading me to nowhere -

A lugubrious voice in my rotten brain
"Did you kill her ? !"You killed her !"
No - Can't remember -
Only drive and forget.
