Why are there no real answers
About the fact we die ?
Can anybody help me

To try to find the light ? !

They say that we must believe
But believe in what ?
The world is made of lies

My heart bleeds with rage !

How can I know
If in this life
People are real or not ?
They seem so strange
I can feel them

Is this only just an illusion ?

I hope that life is just a dream
I hope my real person is now asleep
Perhaps some day I will wake up

And behind the light I will find the truth

I think it's funny
to believe in a love

which is just a dream

What we've learnt from the life
Is something so unreal

Everyday is a fight !

To withdraw into oneself
Can be a solution

To ignore this nightmare !

I hope that life is just a dream
I hope my real person is now asleep
Perhaps some day I will wake up

And behind the light I will find my heart

Everyday, I try to understand
Why all those demons perturb my mind
Like a candle, my dream is collapsing
The die is cast and my life too -
