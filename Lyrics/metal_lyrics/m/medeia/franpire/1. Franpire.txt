Mirrors of self exposed pain I hadn't felt
Faces of death were carved inside his chest
By the hand that his demons had dealt
Those were the curses that he kept to himself

In that room we were not alone
Someone else was there for his soul
For his soul

Overwhelmed by a new reality
A sensation the most burdening
There's only one destiny

Paralyzed by the expansion of awareness
I stood outside of my entire being
Effortlessly floating in and out of consciousness
When all senses told me to leave

In that room we were not alone
Someone else was there for his soul

Because, there's no escape from what surrounds us
Like a shadow death is only one step behind us
When the light burns the brightest the day turns to night

There's no escape from what surrounds us
Like a shadow death is only one step behind us
When the light burns the brightest the day turns to night

Tonight

There's no escape !

He would never walk alone, again
