Dine upon this hatred
Let the razors cut your stomach open
Bleeding through your wedding dress
my post mortem beauty queen
Once your wings melted
You descended into arms you saved
To be raped
We are the plague
You rose
Against the hand that fed you
Lies about this sceptic race
About its numbered days
Once your wings melted
You descended
Into the arms you saved
To be raped
We are the plague
To hate
To be hated
Let your blackened heart
Lead the way
To salvation
To be raped
