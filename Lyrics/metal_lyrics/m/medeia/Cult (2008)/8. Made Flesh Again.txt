Sew back the upholstery
The heart's been removed
Compelled to contempt
The sentence renewed
Reflection of a sickle
Glows in her eyes
As the urge grows
Like a swelling too lustful to hide
her grief-laced ears
Hear the sermon of lies
Devouring the soul
As the blade dives
Confront the one you are
Made flesh again
The utterly nothing role of a whore
Makes her perfectly suitable
Like cholera she'll walk in our midst
Fortune has made her our macabre bliss
A body preserved in chloroform
Trapped inside the gates of hell
Her bodytravels in human form
Dismembered in a vague shell
Confront the one you are
Made flesh again
again and again and again
Like cholera she'll walk in our midst
Fortune has made her our macabre bliss
