The break of dawn
From what no one
Should have survived
A few remained
To witness a new day
On top of the slayed
Your grace
The cold embrace
Like always
We want nothing to be something
We make believe that this is not a flash
In complete darkness we need
Strength from your frigid caress
Your frigid caress
Underneath the red skies
Between bliss and devastation
This new world eats its young
Your grace
The cold embrace
This road is paved
