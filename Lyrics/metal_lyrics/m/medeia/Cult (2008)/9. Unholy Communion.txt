We're gathered here to be splattered here
Along the wall in a circular shape
Just like a pill, washed down with laudanum
We corrode our insides
Hands stretched to the crooked cross
We sing in a heavenly way
Our bodies burn in euphoria
Because we've become the slaves
As I crawl down the altar
I see no heaven here
But only illusions
That start to seem so real
And I worship, worship you
I pray for bulimic bliss
But her poison is forever
Inside my soon-to-be corpse
In her church there's no remorse
I worship your face divine
Pledge allegiance to your name
I surrender this life
Cause there's opium in my veins
As I crawl down the altar
I see no heaven here
But only illusions That start to seem so real
I worship your face divine
Pledge allegiance to your name
I surrender this life
Cause there's opium in my veins
