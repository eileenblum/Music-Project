On the cement floor lies a cross made
From your intestines
Embracing your commitment
And the cause you died for
People around relish the sacrifice
(And) can't stop salivating upon your remains
The circle closes
And the rest is eaten away
You got stoned, but not the way you used to
This time it's better than ever before
Sensation of death in your grasp
Makes you feel alive for the very first time
Once divested, no longer enslaved
Rejoice in malice
Our goddess leads the way
Her deceitful lips sing a tune of decay
Your body is torn asunder
By a thousand fingers
Intestines are placed carefully
In a diabolical fashion
You're now closer to god
Than you were ever before
As your putrid insides
Decorate the floor
You got stones, but not the way you used to
This time it's better than ever before
Sensation of death in your grasp
Makes you feel alive for the very first time
Once divested, no longer enslaved
Her deceitful lips sing a tune of decay
Once divested, no longer enslaved
Rejoice in malice
Our goddess leads the way
Her deceitful lips sing a tune of decay
Tune of decay
