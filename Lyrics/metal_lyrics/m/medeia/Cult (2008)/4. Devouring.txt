Right in my face, I can't hear
This body has become mutilated by fear
In hunger I swallowed my tongue
My touch is a mute's scream
With an unctuous smile, she used to
Offer redemption that was not hers to bestow
Now the flesh is moist rigor mortis
As severed parts lay before me
May no-one condemn my actions
cause no-one knows my name
I don't need absolution
But only a switchblade
She's naked, deteriorated, fast asleep
In my arms, Soon I'll belch for the
First time in ages, she's naked, deteriorated
Right in my face, I can't hear
This body has become mutilated by fear
In hunger I swallowed my tongue
My touch is a mute's scream
She's naked, deteriorated
May no-one condemn my actions
May no-one know my name
