The smell of a carcass
Hangs in the air
I wait for the putrid scent
To reach my nostrils
So I can vomit yet again
We'll rot together in this hole
You and me, eternally
I wonder if her porcelain skin
Could keep me warm
The one I never meant to impale
Forgive me
I pray to be indulged
Never take her remains away from me
I'll lay down beside what's left
We'll rot together in this hole
You and me, eternally
The last fuse goes out
Making everything black
I'm trapped underneath
The frescoes that witness my act
In utter darkness
They're the only ones to see
Through my hallowed body
That's theirs to keep
Through sacrifice
Through pleasure
