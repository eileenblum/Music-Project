BORN ENEMY!

PULL the thickest veil
Over this world to hide
Who the real enemies are

THIS race was born here
As a blind disciple
Of the morning star

Waves of nausea came crashing in breaking into a vaporous distress
SATURATING
Like our species has bred to abuse what's left to detest

This state of nature is built from neglect
These tides aren't strong enough to wash away this guilt
As it was a conscious decision to be reduced to filth
Let's desecrate the monuments our ancestors built
The new ocean floor consists of the blood that's been spilled
BY A BORN ENEMY!

PULL the thickest veil
Over this world to hide
Who the real enemies are

THIS race was born here
As a blind disciple
Of the morning star

WITH no excuse to live
But the constant need to breed
Inhumanity

MANKIND is the thriving force
Behind it's shattered
Broken dreams

Eyes glazed by delusions of grandeur
Everyone must have everything
Entitled by an illusion of greatness
Born enemies to each other's realities

BORN ENEMIES!
BORN ENEMIES!

Underneath every gilded statement lies a hollow truth
A new headline after a new deadline
Defining the essence of this rapid decline

In-between the lines
Destiny reveals ensued this life will end
With nothing but eternal solitude

These tides aren't strong enough to wash away this guilt
As it was a conscious decision to be reduced to filth
Let's desecrate the monuments out ancestors built
The new ocean floor consists of blood that's been spilled

BORN ENEMY!
BORN ENEMY!
