Grown and fed internally
This urge to control
Infested by putrefaction of righteous moral
Foul beyond human reason
With joy I resigned from life
To witness a new reign far from the blessed eyes

Detached from human suffering
I possess the will to dominate

Feel my hate
Feel my hate
The will to dominate

Only a sickness can hide the truth that eyelids won't cover
As human nature is afflicted by a perpetual lust for power
That distorts the vision of immoral cowards
Sadistic hunger will never see its final hour
