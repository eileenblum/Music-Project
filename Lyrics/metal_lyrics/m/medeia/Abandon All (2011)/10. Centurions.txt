The icicles grew up from the ground as gravity was reversed
Penetrating dead bodies that now blew liquid nitrogen

Once more the earth war purified from the human stain
The mirror image of imperfection was broken again

It will rain fire from the skies to cleanse the vain needs of mankind
Let's face this new dysfunction aligned
We're the centurions of our time

Conquer and repopulate
Overwhelm and dominate

Now the halo burns on the new bearer
Shining black light to lead the way
A new era begins today

Centurions
