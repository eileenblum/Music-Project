The utmost darkness ceased to surround
It has become internal

Now embedded into the human heart it just waits to be admitted to the rotten core

My remains appear comatose to the ruins of life
This is the ultimate disconnection from reality
Complete post-human metaphysical overload
This is the ultimate disconnection from humanity

Breathe no more
The far compressed lungs
Breathe no more with their cancer-plagued walls

Hyperventilation slows down to an inanimate stillness

Inwards serpenting leaches consume all but the immaterial
Sensations beyond all carnal pain once life's poured out from these blackened veins

The utmost darkness ceased to surround
It has become internal
These depths will engulf
Swallow all worthless slime
Down the spiral

My remains appear comatose to the ruins of life
This is the ultimate disconnection from reality
Complete post-human metaphysical overload
This is the ultimate disconnection from humanity

Breathe no more
The far compressed lungs
Breathe no more with their cancer-plagued walls

The far compressed lungs
With their cancer-plagued walls
