It will not be a war as wars end
By ungodly terror humanity will bend
Compassion is truly heaven sent as the eternal night crumbles to make amends

Like a black spectrum it radiates disgust penetrating the tormented ones drugged from Hell
Control these creatures I must
By the undistinguished name my actions are compelled

The darkest wings form a crown in the sky while the coldest wind makes the dust rise
Bodies levitate defying nature's laws
Your god is not here anymore

Seek me in your thoughts
You know you can't deny me
See the divine design turned inside out
Denigrated to sublime

It will not be a war as wars end
By ungodly terror humanity will bend
Compassion is truly heaven sent as the eternal night crumbles to make amends

Make amends

The darkest wings form a crown in the sky while the coldest wind makes the dust rise
Bodies levitate defying nature's laws
Your god is not here anymore

Seek me in your thoughts
You know you can't deny me
See the divine design
Turned inside out
Denigrated to sublime
