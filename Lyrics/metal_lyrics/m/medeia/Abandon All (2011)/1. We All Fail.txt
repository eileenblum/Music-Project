All faith is self-deceit as every religion is sickness
Waging wars to consume us all
Depriving us from the sense of our existence

Will no one reach out and heal us
Will no one save our wretched souls

Well all fail to see the true power in ourselves
We all fail

An imitation of redemption cast its shadow
Upon desperate masses constantly seeking
Praying for an excuse

To release us from the weight of being alive
To confuse us with nothing but lies

All faith is self-deceit as every religion is sickness
Waging wars to consume us all
Depriving us from the sense of our existence

Bound to be indulged as sins wash away
From the hands of our genocidal race on its stairway to Hell

Will no one reach out and heal us
Will no one save our wretched souls

Well all fail to see the true power in ourselves
We all fail
