Treachery lacks all love
Making your grave cold as my heart
Through the ice glimmer the faces of gods
Uncounted they are by the Emperor's arms

With mouths open wide
Silenced by their vice
No screams will be heard
In their state of demise
Entombed under ice
Sworn to the father of lies

Abandon all
Abandon all hope

Your might infects my immaterial entity
Your intellect stained by hate aesthetically
I'll absorb everything you've given me
I'll invert the celestial hierarchy

With mouths open wide
Silenced by their vice
No screams will be heard
In their state of demise
Entombed under ice
Sworn to the father of lies

Here I found my true nature waiting to be discovered
Midst the liars condemned to vacate his brothel

Abandon all
Abandon all hope

There will be no hope
There will be no absolution
