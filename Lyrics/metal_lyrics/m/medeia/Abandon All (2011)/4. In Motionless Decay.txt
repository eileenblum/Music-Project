The taste and resonance carry me to the darkest place

In here the murderous souls suffer bound by the burning walls

Confined in hate primordial
Wallowing in boiling blood

Decline of consciousness
Experience the motionless decay

Curse his name forever more
Never crawl again
Curse his name forever
My deliverance is sealed

The taste and resonance carry me to the darkest place
Flooding my mouth until my airways immerse
Its smell and appearance rape my senses
Ravaging my conception as the flesh will reimburse

Static decline of consciousness
Experience the motionless decay
Drowning into exile
Suppressed in motionless decay
