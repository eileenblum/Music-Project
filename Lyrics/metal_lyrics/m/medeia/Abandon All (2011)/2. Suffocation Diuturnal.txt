The soiled fingernails scar these walls with a dissonant sound
Tearing the skin of this decoyed and reflectionless tomb profound

Rebuilt from sin I'll be made whole again
Leaving the chasm above stained my name

Past the lustful in the eternal wind of Hades
Through all filth and the beating rain of gluttony
Unchained by the great weights of mankind
Rising above souls sullen in slime

Suffocation diuturnal

Eyewitness their sins Inferior to mine as they remain in their unhallowed shrines
Eyewitness their sins inferior to mine as they remain

These broken fingers embrace the walls without a sound
Peeling the flesh of this putrid and infested womb

Past the lustful in the eternal wind of Hades
Through all filth and the beating rain of gluttony
Unchained by the great weights of mankind
Rising above souls sullen in slime
I've grown voiceless
Perished to the void

Suffocation diuturnal
