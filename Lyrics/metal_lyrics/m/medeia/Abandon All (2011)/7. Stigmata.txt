Altering the human flesh to wretched proportions as all symmetry vaporizes into distortion

The statutes bled tears of blood
In my filthy hands disgusting signs of stigmata

Sealed are the ears of hope covered in shame
Eyes pierced by a thousand thorns yet the faithful bewail his name

It's an inhuman tragedy to metamorphose unstately
While skin stretched to tear absolution became real

Hundreds of tongues I spoke
With every blasphemed his throne
While spastic seizures controlled my insides turned to stone

With every language
With every word
With all conviction I denounce your faith

Hundreds of tongues I spoke
With every blasphemed his throne
While spastic seizures controlled my insides turned to stone

The statutes bled tears of blood
In my filthy hands disgusting signs of stigmata
Prove that I am the unchosen one
Made of sin to be a savior
