The mantra I repeat sounding twice my defeat
Where liquid turned to soil I rest in turmoil

I've mocked the crown of thorns
Denied the light dispersed from behind them
I've eternally shut my eyes from his lies disguised as an absolute

I've seen my fate
To decease
To become more than a man

Into ashes burnt devolving past all heads turned
Where soil became a wall I fell once more

The mantra I repeat sounding twice my defeat
Where liquid turned to soil I rest in turmoil

Sensing the great cold
That reigns below
Beneath the barrier's hold
The wind carries my soul
