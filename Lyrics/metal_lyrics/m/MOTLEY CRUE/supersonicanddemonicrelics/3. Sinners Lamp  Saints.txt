She's built for speed
Racin Machine
She's in the driver's seat
Feel her shift the gears
I like to fill her up
I like to fill her with sin
Drive her straight to the top
There and back again
Hey hey
She's A Sinner
She's A Sinner
Sinner
She's A Sinner
She Kicks In Overdrive
Her Engine's Mile For Miles
So You Don't Even Bother Worry
She's Fast All The Time
Love's Got Wheels
Comes With The Deal
Custom Grip Specialty
And T stands For Thrill
Hey Hey
She's A Sinner
She's A Sinner
Sinner
She's A Sinner
She's a Sight Man
She's a Bloody Scream
I Start Closin My Eyes
She's In My Dreams
She's Half A Thrill
I'm A Fallen Angel
She'll Set Up A Kill
I'm A Saint

She's A Sinner
She's A Sinner
Sinner
She's A Sinner
