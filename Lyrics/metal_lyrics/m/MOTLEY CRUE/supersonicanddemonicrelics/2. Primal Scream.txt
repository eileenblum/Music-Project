Broke dick dog
My head slung low
Tail knocked in the dirt

Time and time of being told
Trash is all I'm worth

When I was just a young boy
Had to take a little grief
Now that I'm much older
Don't put your shit on me

[Pre-Chorus]
Grab it and shake
Reach down scrape it
You just got to

[Chorus]
Primal scream &amp; shout
Let that mother out
You just gotta say "hey"
Primal scream &amp; shout
Oooh tear it out
You just gotta say

Janou said
Meters are red
Blow a neurotic fuse Show a little
A little pain
Unlock a lotta truth

When daddy was a young man
His home was living hell
Mama tried to be so perfect
Now her mind's a padded cell, ya

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus with adlib]

[Solo]

Hey man, get out of my face
I deal with my problems at my own pace
With your screwed-down, anti-human views
Deal with the pressures by playing the blues
If you wanna live life on your own terms
You gotta be willing to crash and burn

[Chorus with adlib]

Scream shout
Come on come on come on
Scream shout
