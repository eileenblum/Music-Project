All these years
An angry child
Broken, shattered
Torn inside
Father
Where were you?
Where were...

I feel old
I feel dead
Barely hangin'
By a thread

Father
Where were you?
Where were...
To my father
How could you run?
You walked away
Abandoned your son
Broke my heart
Left me dyin'
So fucked up
Where I came from
What's a father without a son?
It's like a bullet without a gun
I live to die, I'll fly away
You're the knife and I'm the prey
But you're dead, so fucking dead
We all gotta die, so fucking die

I love you Daddy
