Rhythm denotes the regular pattern flow
Of sound and movement and speech ya know
Rhythm dictates the soul to stop and go
Of the sound that moves the streets ya know
In a natural phenomenon boom
And it makes ya wanna do it 'till you
Gotta go
Boom over here, boom over there
Boom everywhere
Boom over here, boom over there
Boom everywhere

The best is sweet and it melts in your mouth
This ain't no shit, no doubt
You gotta take things, break things
Everybody take things to a higher level
Pumpin', jumpin', a physical activity
Pumpin', jumpin', a physical profanity
I make the drum speak the language of rhythm
I create this boom for you

Boom over here, boom over there
Boom everywhere
Boom over here, boom over there
Boom everywhere
