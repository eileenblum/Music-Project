I'm havnig a bad trip (hahaha)
Myflower in my hair just wilted
I just sold my lightbulb to Ratt
Charlie Manson is my hero
I'm going to live with Hendrix
Janis Joplin knows how to party
Nixon's a happenin' dude
That's why the world is the way it is today
This is the story of my life
The tread on my sandles are coming off
