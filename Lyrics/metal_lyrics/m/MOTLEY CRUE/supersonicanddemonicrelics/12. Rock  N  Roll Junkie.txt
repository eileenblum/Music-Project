I said dance, I said prance
Sleazing in like a monkey
That's cool, I say it's gross
Honey so damn funky
Dance to the rhythm
Jungle music rhythm
So primal, animal
Tearing down the gown
Striped with such a strip
She's a winner's rockshot
She don't give up, no
No she don't give a shit

Hey hey hey
She's a rock 'n' roll junkie
That's how she gets her kicks
The way she licks her lips
It's how she gets her fix
Another midnight monkey
How'd she get those kicks
Just a rock 'n' roll junkie
I'm a wildcat
I can't scratch
Nice to feel the wind's draft
Standing in the music
Dirty dirty music
Dancing on the edge
She likes it that way
(She loves it that way)
She loves it baby

Hey hey hey
She's a rock 'n' roll junkie
That's how she gets her kicks
The way she licks her lips
It's how she gets her fix
Another midnight monkey
How'd she get those kicks
Just a rock 'n' roll junkie

She likes it that way
She loves it baby, hey hey hey
