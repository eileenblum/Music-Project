alright alright this life is what you make it.
don't slide... you can't compromise
you click your heels 3 times imagination goes wild..
you can't analyze
so be sure that you are makin the best of what you have
the truth is all within yourself
don't be a slave.. a slave to someone else

higher higher it's where we want to be in our minds..
it will mesmerize
it" pleasure power that's what we devour...
you can have it crystallize
now it's time to look at what you've done with your life
and the path you found and followed in
yourself i won't be a slave.. a slave to anyone
the question is
when it's all done
who will stand
and who will run
the answer is on my tongue
i won't be a slave to anyone

so be sure that you are making the best of what you have
the truth is all within yourself
don't be a slave... a slave to someone else
