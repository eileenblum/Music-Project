Now listen up
She's razor sharp
If she don't get her way
She'll slice you apart
Now she's a cool, cool black
Moves like a cat
If you don't get her game
You might not make it back

[Pre chorus:]
She's got the looks that kill
That kill
She's got the looks that kill
That kill

[Chorus:]
She's got the looks that kill
Now she's bulletproof
Keeps her motor clean
And believe me, you
She's a number thirteen
The church strikes midnight
She's lookin' louder and louder
She's gonna turn on our juice, boy
So she turns on the power

[Pre chorus:]
She's got the looks that kill

[Chorus:]

[Solo:]
[Verse:]
[Pre chorus:]
[Chorus: ]
