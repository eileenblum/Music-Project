In her eyes
You're the night's desire
You're the one on her lips

She'll drink your love
In the shadow of blood
It's a deadly, deadly kiss

You're just a man
All in her prey
In the web of delight

All you can do
Is close your eyes
Cause you've lost
Your life

In this theatre of pain
Love and hate's the same
To the black widow
To the black widow
To the black widow

I need a love
I need a love
I need another black widow
I need a love
I need a love
I need another black widow

Well among kings and queens
Love and hate's the same
In this theatre of pain
Love and hate's the same
To the black widow
