Wake me up in the morning glory,
Cant get straight your lies are stories
How do you mark your territory

When your trash becomes your treasure,
Your remorse are my pleasure,
Lose your mind at your leisure

Simply said your complicated,
Understand you're overrated,
The more you talk the less you seem to say

We are miserable,
You are driving me insane

This could be your,
Sick love song
This could be your
Sign that things are going wrong
This could be your
Sick love song
Sick love song
Sick love song

Chew me up like a meat grinder
You're cold-blooded like a sidewinder
I don't need another reminder
Cant understand normal thinking
Drive a sober man to drinking
In fact you drive me straight to hell

We are miserable
You are driving me insane

This could be your
Sick love song
This could be your
Sign that things are going wrong
This could be your
Sick love song
Sick love song
Sick love song

The more you inhale
The more that you breath
The more that you make me
Wanna scream

This could be your
Sick love song
This could be your
Sign that things are going wrong
This could be your
Sick love song
Sick love song
Sick love song

This could be your
Sick love song
This could be your
Reason not to get along
This could be your
Sick love song
Sick love song
Sick love song
Sick love song
Sick love song
Sick love song
Sick love song
Sick love song
Sick love song
Sick love song
Sick love song
