and the label said take two for pain
so now i medicate my brain
the conflict rubs against my grain
but i cannot flush it down the drain
we are so hopeless
we are hopelessly in love
she breaks my will
she's my bitter pill
addicted to her
can't fight off the chill
she blurs my world
she's my bitter pill
we creep the night
just to taste the thrill
hopelessly in love

she's the kind of love drives a man insane
she sticks her poison right in my vein
spinning around
over and upside down in love
she breaks my will
she's my bitter pill
addicted to her
can't fight off this chill
she blurs my world
she's my bitter pill
we creap the night
just to taste the thrill
hopelessly in love

she blurs my world
she's my bitter pill
she breaks my will
she's my bitter pill
we creap the night
just to taste the thrill
addicted to her
she's my bitter pill
