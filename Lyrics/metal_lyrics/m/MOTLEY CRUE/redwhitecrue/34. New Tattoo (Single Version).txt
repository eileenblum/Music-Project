I've been out drinkin with the boys again
Sorry I'm calling after 2 a.m.

There's something that I need to say to you
I know it's late
But this can't wait
I just got a new tattoo

One love and a, one woman
You're my new tattoo
Tonight is the very first night of my life with you Until the day I die
I promise it's true
Everyone will see my new tattoo

Tonight I saw your face up in the stars Stumbled here to paint you on my arm
There's something that I need to say to you
So I wrote this song
Cause you belong
Right here on my new tattoo
One love and a, one woman

You're my new tattoo
Tonight is the very first night of my life with you Until the day I die
I promise it's true
Everyone will see my

I don't want to see us fade away
I don't want to be without you another day
I could be your Dorian Gray
I won't fade away
No, I won't fade away

One love and a, one woman
You're my new tattoo
Tonight is the very first night of my life with you One love and a, one woman
You're my new tattoo
Tonight is the very first night I'll spend with you
Yeah-ah
Don't wanna be without my new tattoo
Yeah-aahh Yeah
