[on re-released disc]

Oh-uh. Uh-huh-ohh-ooh.
Well, ya shout at the devil.
Ye-ah.

I'm a wolf screamin' lonely in the night
I'm a bloodstain on the stage
I'm a tear in your eye
Been tempted by the lie
I'm a knife in the back
I'm rage
Well I'm a razor to the knife
Oh lonely is our life
My head's spinnin' round and round
But in the seasons of the wither
Ya stand and deliver
Be strong
And laugh and

[Chorus:]
Shout, shout, shout
Shout at the devil
Shout, shout, shout

I'll be the love in your eyes
I'll be the blood between your thighs
And then I'll have you cry for more
I'll put strength to the test
I'll put the thrill back in bed
I'm sure you've heard it all before
I'll be the risk in the kiss
Might be anger on your lips
Might run scared for the door
But in the seasons of wither
Ya stand and deliver
Be strong
and laugh and

[Chorus:]
Shout, shout, shout
Shout at the devil
Shout, shout, shout

[Repeat verse 1]

Shout, shout ,shout
Shout at the devil
Shout, shout, shout

Shout, shout, shout
Shout, shout, shout
Shout at the devil

Shout, shout, shout
Shout at the devil
Shout, shout, shout

I need that evil
I sold my soul
What?
Because I'm in Hell
Oh, I need it
I need it more
What? What?
Ahh-oohhh hahahaha
