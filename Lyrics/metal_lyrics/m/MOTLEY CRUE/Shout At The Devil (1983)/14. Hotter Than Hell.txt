[on re-released disc]

Some like the violence
Some like submission
Some use aggression
Some use a bullet in the head to be brave
Some like the evil
Some need the power
Some bleed in vain
Some get a bullet in the head instead
Some got the go
Some play the role
Some scream out in horror just for show
Some got no reason
Some got no hope
Some like it hot
Some like it hot
We like it hot
We like it hoter, hoter than hell
Like hotter, we like it, um we like, um we
like hot
Some like the violence
Some like submission
Some use aggression
Some use a bullet in the head to be brave
Some got to go Some play the role
Some scream out in horror just for show
Some got no reason
Some got no hope
Some like it hot
Some like it hot
We like it hot
We like it hoter, hoter than hell
Like hotter, we like it, um we like, um we
like hot
Hotter, like hotter than hell
Like hotter, hotter than hell, we like it hotter
Hotter than hell, like hotter, we like it,
we like it, we like it hot
