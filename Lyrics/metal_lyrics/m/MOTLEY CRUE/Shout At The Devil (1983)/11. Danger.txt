Had wild dreams
Walkin' the streets
Hell, we were young
Never looked back
So we took our dreams
Ran like hell
Lived our youth
From the wishing well
Me and the boys
Made a pack
To live or die
No turning back
Scarred for life
All my best friends died
I lost my mind
It made me hate
I can't escape, I can't escape

[Pre-chorus:]
I'm a wildcat
A shotgun blast
Madman
Strong as steel
Overkill
No more deals

[Chorus:]
Danger
You're in danger
When the boys are around Danger
You're in danger
And this is my town
This is Hollywood

I was blind
One step from the edge
Spin round and round
Out of my head
Lost in my gin
From riches to sin
Loose again
I've escaped
I've escaped

Pre chorus:
Tattooed lies
Distant eyes
Hollywood
It's been ten long years
Tears and fears
The end is near

[Chorus:]

[Solo:]

[Pre-chorus:]

[Chorus:]
