Here I come
My mind is set
Get ready for love
You're my ten second pet

[Verse:]
Touch my gun
But don't pull my trigger
Let's make history
In the elevator
Or lock the door
Shine my pistol some more
Here I cum
Just ten seconds more

[Chorus:]
Ten seconds to love
Ten seconds lo love
Pull my trigger
My guns loaded with your love
Ten seconds to love
Ten seconds to love
Just wait honey
Till I tell the boys about you

Bring a girlfriend
Maybe bring two I got my camera
Make a star outta you
Let's inject it
Photograph it
Down to the subway
Let the younger boys have it

[Chorus:]

[Talk:]
Reach down low
Slide it in real slow
I wanna hear your engine roar
Before I'm in the door

[Solo:]

[Talk:]
You feel so good
Do you want some more
I got one more shot
My guns still warm

[Chorus:]

[Talk:]
Was it hot for you
Did you fire this round
The second I'm through
I'll be leaving this town
