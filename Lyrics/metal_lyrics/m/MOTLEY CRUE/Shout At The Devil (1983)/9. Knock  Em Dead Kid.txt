In the heat of the night
You went and blackened my eyes
Well now I'm back
I'm back
I'm back
And I'm coming your way
Well now I'm supercharged
Might just explode in your face
I'm black
I'm black
I'm black
And I'm primed for hate

[Chorus:]
Knock 'em dead, kid
(Knock 'em dead!)
Knock 'em dead, kid
(Knock 'em dead!)
The blade is red, kid
(Knock 'em dead!)
Knock 'em dead, kid
(Knock 'em dead!) A star-spangled fight
Heard a steel-belted scream
Now I'm black, I'm black, I'm black
Another sidewalk's bloody dream
I heard the sirens whine
My blood turned to freeze
You'll see the red in my eyes
As you take my disease

[Chorus:]

[Solo:]

[Chorus:]
Knock 'em Knock'em Knock 'em
Dead...............[scream]
Knock'em dead kid
