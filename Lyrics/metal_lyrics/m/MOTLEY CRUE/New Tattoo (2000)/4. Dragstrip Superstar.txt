Jailbait playmate
Freak show masturbate
Fuel inject carburete
Underage penetrate

Mama take me home tonight
Mama take me Home

Dragstrip, she's a superstar
She's got a tight fit, She's gonna make it far Dragstrip, she's so supercharged
She's got loose lips, she's a superstar Superstar

Dancin down the alleyway
Doomsday runaway
Money shaker on display

Mama take me home tonight
Mama take me Home

She's got a tight fit, She's gonna make it far Dragstrip, she's so supercharged
She's got loose lips, she's a superstar
