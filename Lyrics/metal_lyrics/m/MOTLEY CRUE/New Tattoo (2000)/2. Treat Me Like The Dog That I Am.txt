Red Rover, red rover
Got a bone but I can't come over
Never broken, never trained
You got me in the doghouse
On this dog chain

You treat me
Like the dog, like the dog I am
You beat me
Like the dog, like the dog I am

Oh master, go faster
You're my bitch and I'm your bastard
At the dog pound make me beg
Got me with my tail between my legs

You treat me
Like the dog, like the dog I am
You shame me
Like the dog, like the dog I am
You treat me
Like the dog, like the dog I am
You kick me
Like the dog, like the dog I am

Just beat me, just bite me, just break me
Treat me like a dog
Just blame me, just shame me, then cage me
Treat me like a dog

Cause I need it
And I want it
And I deserve it
Treat me like a dog
Please slap me, please smack me
Crack me, whack me
And attack me

Bad dog

You treat me
Like the dog, like the dog I am
You shame me
Like the dog, like the dog I am
You treat me
Like the dog, like the dog I am
You kick me
Like the dog, like the dog I am

Bad dog, bad dog
Bad dog, bad dog
Bad dog
You treat me like a dog
Bad dog, bad dog
Bad dog, bad dog
You treat me like the dog I am
You treat me
(bad dog)
You beat me
(bad dog)
