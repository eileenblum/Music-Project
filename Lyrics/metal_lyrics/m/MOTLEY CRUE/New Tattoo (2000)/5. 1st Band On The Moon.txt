There's a problem with the girls here on Earth They stopped
acting dizzy wearing miniskirts Seems like everything wild is in distaste
Gotta get my band off in outer, outerspace

I want a place that wants arena rock
Along with the girls who wanna suck my... Take our music up and fry some brains
Teach a dimension how to go, go insane

It can't come too soon
Someone always has to break the rules
Like a rock n roll cartoon
1st band on the moon

Now it won't be too long
Until we get to sing our songs
Even if we're outta tune
1st band on the moon

Everybody watchin on their TV sets
Came out of the shuttle dancin penthouse pets And someone grabs a mic and really
lets it
spit
But the band is so loud
We blow the, blow the transmit  It can't come too soon
Someone always has to break the rules
Like a rock n roll cartoon
1st band on the moon

Now it won't be too long
Until we get to sing our songs
Even if we're outta tune
1st band on the moon

That's one small step for man
One giant leap backwards for mankind

It can't come too soon
Someone always has to break the rules
Like a rock n roll cartoon
1st band on the moon

Now it won't be too long
Until we get to sing our songs
Even if we're outta tune
1st band on the moon
Even if we're outta tune
1st band on the moon
