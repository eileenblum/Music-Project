Come on, come on

Wow!
Nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

Got a date with
My modem line
Backdoor valentine

Internet jet set
My credit cards in debt
Goin' Down
I'm goin' Down
it's under my thumb
..com .cum

Web cam super scam
Triple X cyber sex
Shoot my rocks on the box
Peeping Tom on the net
Down
I'm goin' down
Goin' down  I'm a cyber junkie such a freak
Nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah
It's dirty love
I'm in love with a porno star
Nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah
Just the way it goes
I'm in love with a porno star

My URL has gone all to hell
http I'm addicted to technology
Goin' down
I'm goin' down
Goin' down
I'm a cyber junkie such a freak

Come on girls
When I grow up I want to be just like you
just like you
When I grow up I want to be just like you
just like you
When I grow up I want to be just like you
just like you
