Fake, fake, fake
Fake, fake ,fake

Spent a million dollars on amphetamines Crashed a lot of cars
Fucked all the stupid stars in Hollywood Because I could, because we could

So you loved to hate us in your private jets Funny how you bitched and moaned
'Cause you got fat and rich
And when I'm dead
All you'll put on my headstone is that

I'm so fake
I'm a dirty little bastard
Fake
I was always so plastered
Fake
So why'd you say it's true
Looks like I'm fake just like you
Fake
I'm a dirty little whore
Fake
I'm everything and more
Looks like I'm fake
Just like just like you

Fake, fake, fake

40 million records and going strong
Never won a Grammy
Still won't play along in Hollywood
Like we should

And I'm so fake
I'm a dirty little bastard
Fake
I was always so plastered
Fake
So you say it's true
Looks like I'm fake just like you
Fake
I'm a dirty little whore
Fake
I was always such a bore
Fake
So ya say it's true
Looks like I'm fake
Just like you  My diamond rings and cocaine binges
All strung out on your syringes
Sold my soul while you sold records
I have been your slave forever

Hey, what are you fat cats doing anyway?
Take our money and flush it down the drain

You're so fake
You're a dirty little bastard
Fake
You're always so plastered
Fake
So you say it's true
Looks like I'm a fake like you
Fake
You're a dirty little whore
Fake
You're always such a bore
Fake
So you say it's true
Looks like I'm a fake just like you

Fake
I'm a dirty little bastard
Fake
I was always so plastered
Fake
So ya say it's true
Looks like I'm fake just like you
Fake
I'm a dirty little whore
Fake
I'm everything and more
Fake
So ya say it's true
Looks like I'm fake just like
Looks like I'm fake just like
Looks like I'm fake just like
Just like you
