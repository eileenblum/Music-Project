Flash a smile like an alligator
Move her hips like a generator
All over town like an oil spill
If there's meat on the bone she'll wag her tail

I'm checkin out to the heavens above
Punched in the teeth, teeth by love
Punched in the teeth, teeth by love
Punched in the teeth, teeth by love

Construction work it's silicone
Lights are on but no one's home (wow)
She's painted blue like a cartoon
Every man in town went on the honeymoon

I'm checkin out to the heavens above
Punched in the teeth, teeth by love
Punched in the teeth, teeth by love
Punched in the teeth, teeth by love
She really broke my heart!

Oh yeah
She's a Hollywood vampirella
A storybook Cinderella
A bitchin' smile and a turned down eyes
Every dog in town lifts his leg on her thigh

Punched in the teeth, teeth by love
Punched in the teeth, teeth by love
Punched in the teeth, teeth by love
Punched in the teeth

Punched in the teeth, teeth by love
(teeth by love)
Punched in the teeth, teeth by love
Punched in the teeth, teeth by love
Punched in the teeth
(Oh why she doin' this to me?)
Punched in the teeth, teeth by love
(all over my girl)
Punched in the teeth, teeth by love
Punched in the teeth, teeth by love
(Kick my ass and she broke my heart)
Punched in the teeth
