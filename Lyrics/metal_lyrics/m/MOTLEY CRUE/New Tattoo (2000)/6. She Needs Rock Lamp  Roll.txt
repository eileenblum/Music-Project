Yeah-uh
A preacher's daughter with a devil tattoo Mama's little good girl sniffin that glue
Her box started buzzing ever since she heard the Crue
White trash mannequin workin on a scheme Livin on adrenaline Daddy can't redeem

She turned up her radio
And headed to the show

She needs Rock N Roll
(She's begging please)
She needs Rock N Roll
You know she's an underage angel with a dented halo
She needs Rock N Roll
Show

Small town girl was a trailer park queen
Headin to the city with her starry-eyed dreams Fistful of pills and a fashion
magazine

Yeah she turns up her radio
And heads to the show

She needs Rock N Roll
(She's begging please)
She needs Rock N Roll

You know she's an underage angel with a dented halo
She needs Rock N Roll
Show, show

(She turns up her radio)
WOW!

And she turns up the radio
And heads to the show

She needs Rock N Roll
(She's begging please)
She needs Rock N Roll
You know she's an underage angel with a dented halo
She needs Rock N Roll
Yeah
She needs Rock N Roll
(she's beggin)
She needs Rock N Roll
Yeah-ah-ah-ah
She needs Rock N Roll
(She's on her knees)
She needs Rock n Roll
Show, show, show
(She needs Rock n Roll)
(She needs Rock n Roll)
(She needs Rock n Roll)
(She needs Rock n Roll)
(She needs Rock n Roll)
