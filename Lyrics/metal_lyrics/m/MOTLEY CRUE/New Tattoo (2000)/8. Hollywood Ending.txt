Ooh yeah-ah

Did you want it this way
Breaking us down a little bit at a time
Is it easier now that I'm not around
Oh is it time to draw the line

We don't have to pretend
Ya got your Hollywood ending
(Another Hollywood ending)
Ya got your Hollywood ending
(Another Hollywood ending)

Leave it to me
To act like a fool begging you to come back When I had you I had everything
Now all I have is this photograph

There's nothing here to defend
it's not a Hollywood ending
(Another Hollwood ending)
It's not as bad as it seems
(Another Hollwood ending)
It's hard to give up your dreams
(Another Hollwood ending)
It's not a Hollywood ending
(Another Hollwood ending)

Well you don't have to go
Oh you don't have to go
You could've been the star of
My show anytime
No, you don't have to go

I called on the phone
Came by your home
To find out that you're not alone

Now we don't have to pretend
That it's a Hollywood ending
(Another Hollywood ending)
It's not as bad as it seems
(Another Hollywood ending)
It's hard to give up your dreams
(Another Hollywood ending)
All that glitters will fade
(Another Hollywood ending)
Just like the promise ya made
(Another Hollywood ending)
Just like the promise ya made
(Another Hollywood ending)
(Another Hollywood ending)
(Another Hollywood ending)
