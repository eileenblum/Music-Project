Oh no, oh no
Oh. no oh no
Oh no, oh no
Living on a jet
Making love to someone else's dreams
Say it again
She puts her leg up
Well, calls it good luck
Do you know what I mean?
Do you remember?
Well I remember
Oh no, oh no
Dream machine
So damn cool she can turn on the night
The more she gets

Well, the more that she needs
Do you know what I mean?
Do you remember?
Well I remember Oh no, oh no

[Chorus]
Too fast
Too fast for love
Too fast
You're too fast for love [repeat]

Oh no, oh no
She's a streamline queen
On a sex craved movie screen
Say it again
She'll use her time up
Have nothing to show
Well mark my words
Do you remember?
Well I remember
Oh no, oh no

[Chorus]

You're too fast
You're too fast for love
