When she calls me up
My voice, it starts to shake
She says come right over
Over right away
Oh, good God, there's a fire
In my pants
Then lightning strikes and she
Laughs that evil laugh

She's so sticky
Stick sweet Now when I've done good
She slaps me on the ass
It takes more than ten seconds
To satisfy this lass
The way she walks, I swear
Should be a crime
Sirens scream everytime
She walks by

She's so sticky
Stick sweet
