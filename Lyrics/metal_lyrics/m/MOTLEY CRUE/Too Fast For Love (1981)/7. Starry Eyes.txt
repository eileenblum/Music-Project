When she laughs
She's got the power of a child in her eyes
And when you cry now
She'll hold you like a man's supposed to be held
I can't get into words how I feel
Get it right in this song now
I had to set her free
Needed a friend
Come back to me

Oh starry eyes
Oh, oh [repeat]
Standing alone in the light
You could see her cry
With a smile and a wink
And a sparkle in her eyes
She calmly sighed, I will be all right
Okay child you've had to take the pain
Of a man in the streets
You gotta let me in
Needed a friend
Even just for one night

Oh, starry eyes
Oh, oh [repeat]

Oh no, oh no, oh no

Oh, starry eyes
Oh, oh [repeat]
