[1]
You know he's gotta get away
To the merry-go-round and round
Count times that he laid awake
At night thinkin'
Am I goin' down now
Am I goin' down
Am I goin' down now, oh!

[2]
It's not easy puttin' on a smile
You're alone, lost and found
She waits at home just to love him
Through the night thinkin'
He's been gone so long now
Is he coming home
He's been gone so long now, oh!

[Chorus]
Merry-go-round and round [repeat]
[1]
[Chorus]
[Chorus]

She waits alone
Just to love him through the night
I'm coming home babe
