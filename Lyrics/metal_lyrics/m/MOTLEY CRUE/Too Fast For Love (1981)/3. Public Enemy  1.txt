You and me
We're gonna escape tonight
On the run
Under the moonlight
Don't think about nothin'
Don't think about nothin'
Tragedy
Runnin' the red light
Hear the screams
Another one dies tonight
Don't think about nothin'
Don't think about nothin'

[Pre Chorus]
Do you know how it feels
To be wanted
Do you know how it feels
To be wanted
Do you know how it feels
To be wanted
To be under the gun
On the run, having fun
When you're young
You're so young
When you're young

[Chorus]
Public enemy #1
Oh yeah
I'm public enemy #1
Oh yeah
I'm public enemy #1
Oh yeah .......
Climbing high
Fast as the speed of sound
Loser's dreams
Crashing to the ground
Don't think about nothin'
Don't think about nothin'

You and me
Under the gun tonight
On the run
We're lost in the lime light
Don't think about nothin'
Because we're gonna get crazy

[Pre Chorus]

[Chorus]
[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]

Public Enemy #1
Hey Hey Hey
