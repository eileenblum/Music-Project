[1]
Took my love
Into overdrive
Custom pink
Tonight you'll pay the price
When she's hot
Well, damn she's hot
Electric love
Like Sandra Dee

Should have seen her dance

[Chorus]
Come on and dance
Come on baby
Come on and dance
[2]
Fast and slick
Well she's cool and clean
In a pepsi sheen
She's a leather tease
When she's on top
Well, you can't be stopped
Watch her scream
Watch her suck you clean
And you should've seen her dance

[Chorus]
[1]
[Chorus]

You should've seen her dance
Come-on-and
Come on and dance
