Don't you know, know, know
It's a violation
I still hear you saying
Such a perfect, perfect night
No, no, no fight all temptation
Well, in a black hearted alley fight
I'm screaming
Take me to the heights tonight
Take me to the top
Take me to the top . . . [repeat]
Too many times
Victim accusation
No, you don't have to take it like that
A sheer, sheer heart attack
No, no noit's no realization
I never had a way with you
But I still hear you saying
Take me to the top
Take me to the top . . . [repeat]

Take me to the top
To the top and throw me off . . . [repeat]

Take me to the top
