[Written By Sixx / Michael / Ashba / Frederiksen]s

It's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it

All I ever heard as a kid was "you're born to lose"
All I ever wanted was a shot at breakin' the rules

I wanna make a lotta money
But I don't wanna go to school
I don't wanna get a real job
I don't wanna be you

[Chorus:]
I'd rather be dead
I'd rather be dead
I'd rather be face down in the dirt
With a bullet it my head

I ran away and pawned my soul for a switchblade knife
I Met a man from mars and a couple other freaks that night

I wanna take on the world
I wanna bang a million girls
I don't wanna wear a three piece suit
I don't wanna be you

[Chorus x2]

I wanna make a lotta money
But I don't wanna go to school
I don't wanna get a real job
I don't wanna be you

I'd rather be dead

It's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it
I'd rather be dead

It's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it
I'd rather be face down in the dirt
With a bullet it my head
