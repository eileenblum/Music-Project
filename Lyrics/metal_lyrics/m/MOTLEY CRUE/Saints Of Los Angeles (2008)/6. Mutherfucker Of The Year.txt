[Written By Sixx / Mars / Michael / Ashba / Frederiksen]

I'm just a thorn in your side
The disrespect in your eye
I can't control myself

I'm like the snake in your drain
I'm taking over your brain
Cause I can't help myself

Every time I turn my head
I can hear everything that said
I know they wish I'd go away

[Chorus:]
Here I am again
Hey now hey now
I'm the Mother Fucker Of The Year

Call me the jackal in heat
The blackest cat on the street
You better watch yourself

A hand grenade with no pin
A razor blade going in
I'm going straight to hell

Every time I turn my head
I can hear everything that said
I know they wish I'd go away

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus x2]
