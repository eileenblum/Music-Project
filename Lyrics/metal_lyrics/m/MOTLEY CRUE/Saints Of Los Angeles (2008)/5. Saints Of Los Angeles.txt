[Written By Sixx / Michael / Ashba / Frederiksen]

Tonight...
There's gonna be a fight
So if you need a place to go
Got a two room slum
A mattress and a gun
And the cops don't never show

So come right in
Cause everybody sins
Welcome to the scene of the crime
You want it? Believe it
We got it if you need it
The devil is a friend of mine

If you think it's crazy
You ain't seen a thing
Just wait until we're going down in flames

[Chorus:]
We are...we are the saints
We signed our life away
Doesn't matter what you think
We're gonna do it anyway
We are...we are the saints
One day you will confess
And Pray to the saints of Los Angeles.

Redline...trippin' on a land mine
Sippin' at the Troubadour
Girl's passed out naked in the back lounge
Everybody's gonna score

She's all  jacked up She's down on her luck
You want it, you need it
The devil's gonna feed it

Don't you say it's crazy
You don't' know a thing
Just wait until we're going down in flames

[Chorus]

[Solo]

Give it up give it up
Give it up give it up

Give it up give it up
Give it up give it up

Give it up give it up

[Chorus x2]
