[Written By Sixx / Michael / Ashba / Frederiksen]

Just a gang of four
Got each other's back
Out for blood like wild dogs in a pack

Tearin' up the world
Put ourselves through hell
Just to have a story we can tell

You can't stop us cause' we're

[Chorus:]
Goin' out, goin' out, goin' out, goin' out swingin'
If you got the balls to fight then come on bring it
Goin' out, goin' out, goin' out  goin' out swingin'
Like a midnight alley fight
Come on come on come on come on bring it

Local gutter rats
On the streets of gold
Crashing stolen cars and sellin' souls

Setting off alarms
Watch the system burn
Ain't it crazy how the tables turn

You can't stop us cause' we're

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus]
