[Written By Sixx / Mars / Michael / Ashba / Frederiksen]

Rolls Royce shoppin
Vicodin poppin
Burn my cash in Beverly Hills

Gold card lover
Accountants run for cover
Gucci went and jacked up my bill

Well I know I shouldn't say it
But truth be told
I really thought that pussy was Gold

[Chorus:]
Chicks = trouble
Ya add it up and get what ya get
Chicks = trouble
I always step right in

I always step right in the shit

Yeah I have a jet
My balls are deep in debt
And all she hears is ch ch ching

But she wants more
A gold diggin whore
Here come the lawyers again

[Chorus]

I always step right in the shit

He never said I could catch this from a centerfold
But I got it bad and the doctor said I should've known
I should've known
I should've known

[Chorus]

Ya add it up and get what ya get

Chicks = trouble
You add it up
You get what ya get
Awww she gets half
Oh no no
