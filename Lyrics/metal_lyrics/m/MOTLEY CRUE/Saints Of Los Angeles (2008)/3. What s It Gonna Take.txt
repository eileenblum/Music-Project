[Written By Sixx / Michael / Ashba / Frederiksen]

We were drinkin' dinner on the sunset strip
The girls doin' powder got a little on her lip
It's just another night... Man I can't take this

We're runnin' outta money and I can't pay the rent
The man at the label say we'll never write a hit ... Shit
... Man I can't take this

When everything is dr-dr-drivin' me crazy
I'm tickin' like a time bomb
And I'm about to blow

[Chorus:]
What's it gonna take to make it
What's it gonna take to make it
I'm a sorry mother fucker tired of living in the gutter
Get Me Outta Here
What's it gonna take to make it
I'll do anything but fake it
What's it gonna take
What's it gonna take to make it here

So we wrote another song cut a demo on a dime
They didn't like the sound, we didn't fit the times
The radio station said "it's way too loud"

So we took it to the streets just to prove 'em all wrong
We knew we had it right, yeah, we knew it all along
It's just another fight...man I can't take this

Everything is dr-dr-drivin' me crazy
I'm tickin' like a time bomb
And I'm about to blow

[Chorus]

[Solo]

What's it gonna take to make it
In the city of sin, yeah the city of angels
What's it gonna take
To make it out of here

[Chorus x2]
