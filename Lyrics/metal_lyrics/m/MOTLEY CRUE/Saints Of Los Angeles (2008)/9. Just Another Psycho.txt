[Written By Sixx / Mars / Michael / Ashba / Frederiksen]

They opened up the door
To my insanity
They should it slammed shut right then
And thrown away the key

They stitched up my head
From my lobotomy
They should have never let me out
I'm public enemy

I'm not okay
The voices in my head always say

[Chorus:]
I should be committed
For being so twisted
Cause everyone knows
I'm just another psycho
I went to the doctor
It wasn't a shocker
When he said I should know
I'm just another psycho

Shoved into a hole
Got covered up with dirt
That's no way to treat someone
Who's feeling's don't get hurt

I don't need a reason
To hurt you just for fun
I'll terrorize your perfect life
Yeah...you better run

[Chorus]

[Solo]

I'm not okay

[Chorus x2]
