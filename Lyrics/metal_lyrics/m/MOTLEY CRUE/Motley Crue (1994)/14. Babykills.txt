She's a revolution
Anarchy in hell on high heels
I get called the villain
Washin' down my love with her pills
Lips are speakin' chaos
But her eyes are
As blue as the sea
She carries Mother's Bible
Mixes Valium with her beliefs
And you know she gets me high

I've seen flowers and razors in her hair
She's walkin' trouble with her innocence
I'll just sit here thinkin' on my window sill
She keeps me high, Miss Babykills

She's sugar but she's spicy
Licks the venom off her lips
Dresses like a school girl
Loves her poisoned fingertips
I just know I love her
Sent from up above for me
And you know she gets me high
I've seen flowers and razors in her hair
She's talkin' trouble with her innocence
I just sit here thinkin' on my window sill
She keeps me high, Miss Babykills

I've seen flowers and razors in her hair
She's walkin' trouble with her innocence
I just sit here thinkin' on my window sill
She takes me higher
Takes me higher

I've seen flowers and...
I've seen razors blades
I just sit here dreaming of my latest fill
She steals' my heart, Miss Babykills
