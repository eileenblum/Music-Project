Mister, mister push button junkie looking for some dirt to buy.
Landslide, it's a corporation landslide waiting for a kiss from an atom bomb.

This situation's critical, my back's against the wall but we like it.
You're walkin' in our sleep and I can't feel at all.
I said, "Hey man, just gimme some truth."

See what you wanna see, feel what you wanna feel.
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna deal, I don't wanna be any part of your stupid
mother fucker machine.
Do what ya wanna do, kill if ya gotta kill, 'cause I just don't believe your point
of view.

Welcome to the numb, fools.
Welcome to the numb.
Welcome to the numb.

People, did you ever feel like you're going insane?
Sister, I'm feeling pretty safe, dead in this home-made grave.

This situation's critical, have I lost my mind?
And I like it.
There's too much information, can you see it in my eyes?
I said, "Hey man, all I want is the truth." See what you wanna see, feel what you
wanna feel.
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna deal, I don't wanna be any part of your stupid
mother fucker machine.
Do what ya wanna do, kill if ya gotta kill, 'cause I just don't believe your point
of view.

Welcome to the numb, fools.
Welcome to the numb.
Welcome to the numb.

Situation's critical, have we lost our minds?
But we like it.
So much information, you can you see it in our eyes.
I said, "Hey man, just gimme the truth."

Why don't we see what ya wanna see, feel what ya wanna feel.
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna deal, I don't wanna be any part of your stupid
mother fucker machine.
Do what ya wanna do, kill if ya gotta kill, 'cause I just don't believe your point
of view.

Welcome to the numb, fools.
Welcome to the numb.
Welcome to the numb.
