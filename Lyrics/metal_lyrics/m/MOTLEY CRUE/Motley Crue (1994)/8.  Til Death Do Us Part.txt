Oh, when you look into my eyes, tell me what you see.
I don't think you'll ever realize the pride inside of me.

Oo, I've walked my walk, talked my talk and I've lived and died in my songs.
Temptation cuts so deep, it's fire still burns so strong.

You know I've lived a few mistakes and I stand by them.
Oo, it's me, myself, and I till death do us part, yeah.
Till death, till death do us part, yeah, yeah, No, no, no, no.

Yeah, sometimes my words may cut too deep and I step on a toe or two.
But I'm half dead and barely half alive, but I live by the truth.
Hey, but I live by the truth.
Til death, 'til death, do us part, do us part.
Hey, if you want to criticize, then you can't believe anything you read.
What you see is all of me.
Yeah, I've talked the talk, walked the walk.
Who thought I'd live this long?
Oh, this life's been hard like a switchblade, blind faith suicide.

You know I've lived a few mistakes and I stand by them.
Oo, it's me, myself, and I till death do us part, yeah.
Till death, till death do us part, yeah, yeah, No, no, no, no.

Yeah, sometimes my words may cut too deep and I step on a toe or two.
But I'm half dead and barely half alive, but I live by the truth.
Hey, but I live by the truth.
Til death, 'til death, do us part, do us part.
