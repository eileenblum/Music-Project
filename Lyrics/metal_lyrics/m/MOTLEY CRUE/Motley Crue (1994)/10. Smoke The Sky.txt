Smoke my hoochie, you say that I'm the Devil, really T.H.C.

Marco Polo hailed it heaven, Socrates inhaled it, too.
Mister President, tell the truth.
You're the great exaggerators since 1932.
Telling evils of the reefer, but all through time we've smoked the sky.

Smoke the sky.

When inside we'll smoke the sky.
When inside we'll smoke the sky.
When inside we'll smoke the, when inside we'll toke the, when inside we'll smoke
the sky.

Home grown vision compliments the senses, opens up my mind.
J.F.K. sold us freedom, or was it just a business toke?
63 went up in smoke.
He was the great seducer crawling from our T.V.s.
Breathed hope into our future, before he died, he smoked the sky,
Smoke the sky.

When inside we'll smoke the sky.
When inside we'll smoke the sky.
When inside we'll smoke the, when inside we'll toke the, when inside we'll smoke
the sky.

B.C. hailed it heaven, I inhaled it, too.
Really T.H.C.
When inside we'll smoke the sky.

Smoke the sky.

When inside we'll smoke the sky.
When inside we'll smoke the sky.
When inside we'll smoke the, when inside we'll toke the, when inside we'll smoke
the sky.
