Look inside the mirror
But I don't know who I see
Smoke another cigarette
A smile holds back the tears
These contradictions
Seem to be the story of my life
A simple man with memories
Of those long lost golden days
I close my eyes and slowly driftaway

Mistakes I've made remind me
Of the roads I shouldn't choose
It never comes that easy
When you've nothing left to lose
I can't see the answers
Tell me why am I so blind
A tired man, I'll make the best
Of another lonely day
I close my eyes and slowly driftaway

Never thought I'd make it
Just from playing my guitar
Just a little smile
Always shelters me from pain
Every time I start to slide
I wish upon a star (no matter where we are)
The sun comes out
And dries up all the rain

I'm an honest man
Who refused the shade
On a hot and lonely day
I close my eyes and dream my life away

Now I know that I can stop the rain
Close my eyes and slowly driftaway
Close my eyes and dream my life away
Close my eyes and slowly driftaway
Close my eyes and dream my life away
