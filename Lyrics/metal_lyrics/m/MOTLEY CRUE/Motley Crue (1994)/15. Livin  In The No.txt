My girlfriend says I cant do this
My wife says don't do that
Another case of PMS,
gonna have a heart attack
I need a small vacation,man, life's a mini-wreck
Told my lawyers and accountants, done took
all I can take

Livin' in the no
One more fucker breatin down my back
Think I will explode

Living in the no
Everyday, everywhere I go
Living in the no

TV says 10 dead for Christmas
Stalker on the loose
Another freeway shooting
I'll be hanin' by a noose
I cant seem to shake it
I can't seem to bend the spell
Special thanks to Mom ' Dad
For bringing me to hell Livin' in the no
One more shark breatin down my back
Think I will explode
Livin' in the no
How'd you like to live your life livin' in the no

You heard what Magic caught?
One too many penthouse pets
Get some protection baby
Lord knows you might be next

Livin' in the no
One more mother breatin down my back
Think I will explode
Livin' in the no
How'd you like to live your life livin' in the no

Livin' in the no
One more fucker breatin down my back
Think I will explode
Livin' in the no
Everyday, everywhere I go
Livin' in the no
