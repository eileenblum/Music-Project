A war zone in the streets, it's anarchy and siege.
We hope it goes away, graffition the walls in modern Babylon, nothing left to
save.
Oo, feel the rebels heed.
Revolution undermines belief.
My eyes have seen this shit before.
We're barely hangin' by the skin of our teeth.
We've all raped it, the future's wasted.
We can't save it now.

Oh, we're dropping; like flies.
Bye, bye.
You're droppin' like flies.

Hate is growing fast in a hazy cloud of crack, but it helps us fade away.
Some inner city queen French kisses his disease with one foot in the grave.
Oh, and this junkyard we call home is primed and ready for another war.
My, my, my, the children have no chance and these eyes have seen this all go down
before.
We've all raped it, the future's wasted.
Can we take it?
Is nothing sacred?
We can't save it now, yeah. I woke up late in a fresh dug grave with a conscience
in my brain.
I'm not here to save your world, but mine won't stay the same.

Oh, my, my, we're droppin' like flies.
Bye, bye, bye bye. You're dropping like flies.
We've all raped it, the future's wasted.
We can't save it.
Can you face it?
Selfish livin' selfish love.
Can you face it.
Can you face it, my son?
Oh, my son, yeah.
Hey!
