Oh, everybody
Do you hear the big bass drum?
Louder, louder
Yes, it's gettin' in you
Like the needle from a gun

Deeper, deeper
Oh, we don't need it
Since we've taken to the lust
Once you've slept with the rhythm, baby
The danger is a must

You're hypnotized
You're tripnotized
Oh, don't you hear it call your name?
You're hypnotized, yeah

Hey, turn it louder
'Cause I want to feel the push harder, harder
Ooh, under your skin
Well, slidin' through your veins
Well, I've got a nasty habit, babe
I always do it again

You're hypnotized
You're tripnotized
Oh, don't you hear it call your name?
You're mesmerized

You're hypnotized
You're tripnotized
Oh, don't you hear it call your name?

You're paralyzed
Hypnotized
Oh, don't you hear it call your name?
You're tranquilized, yeah
