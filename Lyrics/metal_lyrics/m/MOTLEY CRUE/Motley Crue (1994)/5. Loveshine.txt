Oh, baby, walked a million miles climbin' up this mountain lookin' for your smile.

Oh, sugar, where's my baby been?
My heart is like the ocean waitin' for your love to sail on in.

Let my loveshine.
Let my loveshine in.
Oo, baby, won't you let my loveshine in.

Let my loveshine, love shine in.
Let my loveshine.
Let my loveshine.
Baby, won't you let my love, baby, won't you let my loveshine in, love shine in.
Oh baby, remember yesterday?
Spoke to me in riddles and mystery remains.

Oo, sugar, be my oldest friend.
You held me in my youth and you'll hold me in the end again, my friend.

Let my loveshine, love shine in.
Let my loveshine.
Let my loveshine.
Baby, won't you let my love, baby, won't you let my loveshine in, love shine in.
