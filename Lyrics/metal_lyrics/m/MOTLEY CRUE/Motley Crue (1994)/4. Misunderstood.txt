Little old man contemplates suicide twice a day.
Life's passed him by.
Little old woman scared and blind, left alone in desperate times.
Life's passed her by.

Oh, life, it's misunderstood them, so they close their eyes and dream of better
days.
Oh, life, it's misunderstood, yeah.
Life's not always fair, or so they say.

Little boy with vacant eyes, daddy won't be home tonight.
And he don't know why.
His mother, she sits alone tangled in the web she's sewn.
Lives lie to lie.

Oh, life, it's misunderstood them, so they close their eyes and dream of better
days.
Oh, life, it's misunderstood, yeah.
Life's not always fair, or so they say.

Strangled, caged, left alone, doin' time in a broken home.
Feelin' left to die.
I'm a product of your troubled ways.
You made me what I am today.
Now you're asking why.
Oh, life's misunderstood me, so I close my eyes and dream of better days.
Oo, life's misunderstood me.
Life's not always fair, life's not always fair or so they say.
or so they say.

Restless soul deep inside searches for some piece of mind.
Livin' just to die.
I'm an angry man and I always have had to fight to survive my past.
A sign of those times.

Life, it's misunderstood me and I know you know that you've been there too.
Time lets a restless soul fade away.
Life's not always fair, life's not always fair, or so they say.

Little boy with hopeful eyes, daddy's comin' home tonight.
So don't you cry. So don't you cry.
So don't you cry. So don't you cry.
