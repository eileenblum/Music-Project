Act like Jesus crucified again.
These four wall are closing in.
Who and what do you think you are, a rich mother fucker in a fancy car?
Concrete jackal suckin' on the past, goldcard junkie kissing money's ass.

You're the monkey on my back and it's time for you to go.
Hammered.
You're more harm than my old vice and I don't want to know.
Hey, Hey, you're hammer, hammer poor.

Now you're feeling low, tired and beaten.
Bring you some blades and daggers, pierce your soul.
Hell, ain't livin' six feet in the hole.
Get down on your knees in Hollywood time to Kiss some, some ass. Hey, Mr. big time
Hollywood, tell your story walkin' if you think you could.
Your money's runnin' low from your cocaine whores, nothin' but a rat scratchin' at
my door.
Hey, now I've said all I'm gonna say.
time will judge, see who fades away.

You're the monkey on my back and it's time for you to go.
Hammered.
You're more harm than my old vice and I don't want to know.
Hey, Hey, you're hammer, hammer poor.

Now you're feeling low, tired and beaten.
Bring you some blades and daggers, pierce your soul.
Hell, ain't livin' six feet in the hole.
Get down on your knees in Hollywood time to Kiss some, some ass.
