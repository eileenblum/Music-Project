[Original version on "Motley Crue" (1994) album]
[music &amp; lyrics: Corabi, Lee, Mars, Sixx]

Drop dead beauties, stompin' up a storm
Lines of hell on our face
Bruised bad apples...crawling through the night
Busted loose...runaway!!!
Always, always
Thrill without a motive
30 days just a haze

Everybody wants a piece of the action
Everybody wants a piece of the pie

We're on a holiday, hooligan's holiday
I'm on a holiday...hooligans
I gotta get away...hooligan's holiday
We're on a holiday...hooligans

Cross-eyed derelicts comin'
An iron horse between our legs
Tattoes an black manes flowin'
Everyday's a holidaze

Modern times an new bloods pumpin'
Only the strong survive
