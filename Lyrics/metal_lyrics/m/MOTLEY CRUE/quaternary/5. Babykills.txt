[music &amp; lyrics: Corabi, Lee, Mars, Sixx]

She's a revolution, anarchy and hell on high heels
I get called the villain washin' down my love with her pills
Lips are speakin' chaos, but her eyes are blue as the sea
She carries mothers bible mixes valium with her beliefs
And you know she gets me high

I've seen flowers and razors in her hair
She's walkin' trouble with her innocence
I'll just sit here thinkin' on my windowsill
She keeps me high, Miss Babykills

She sugar but she spicy, licks the venom off her lips
Dresses like a school girl, loves her poisoned finger tips
I just know I love her, she sent from above for me
And you know she gets me high

I've seen flowers and razors in her hair
She's walkin' trouble with her innocence
I'll just sit here thinkin' on my windowsill
She keeps me high, Miss Babykills
