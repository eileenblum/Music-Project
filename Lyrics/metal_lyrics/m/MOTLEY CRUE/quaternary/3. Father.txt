[music and lyrics: Nikki Sixx]

All these years
An angry child
Broken, shattered
Torn inside

Father!
Where were you?
Where were...

I feel old
I feel dead
Barely hangin'
By a thread

Father!
Where were you?
Where were...

To my father
How could you run?
You walked away
Abandoned your son
Broke my heart
Left me dyin'
So fucked up
Where I come from

Broke my heart
Left me dyin'
So fucked up
Where I come from

What's a father without a son
It's like a bullet without a gun
I live to die, I'll fly anyway
You're the knife, and I'm the prey
But you're dead, so fucking dead
We all gotta die, so fucking die

"I love you daddy"
