[music &amp; lyrics: John Corabi]

I'm sitting in this room alone
Time is passing by
I think of things I've said and done
And now I wonder why
At times all my eyes see
In a world of misery
When I'm overwhelmed with pain
You tell me how endeared I am my friend

Somehow we know just what we're thinking
And listen when the other calls
I'm here just waiting for your call
And when we're feeling down
We pick each other up before we fall

You're sitting in your room alone
Life is passing by
You think of things you said and
all that you've done
Now you wonder why
And when all your eyes see
This world of misery
When you're overwhelmed with pain
I'll tell you how you endeared you are my friend
