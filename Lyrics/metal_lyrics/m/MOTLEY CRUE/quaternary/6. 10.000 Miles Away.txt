[music &amp; lyrics: Corabi, Lee, Mars, Sixx]

I been drinkin' lately girl
You know I'm sick in love
Don't know when I'll be home
Then I see the faces when I'm standin' on the stage
It gets me thru the nights
And when I'm feelin' cold...All I have to do is call

To warm my heart 10.000 miles away

I been feelin' low and I really miss my son
Hey boy I'm callin' you
When I think about our lives it gets me thru the night

And warms my heart 10.000 miles away

You knew this was a hard life, when you met me
Sometimes I can't feel if it's night or day
You know I couldn't trade this baby if I had to
Goddamn, it's hard being so in love it's true
Maybe I'm a gypsy baby livin' on stage
Something's I guess will never change
Girl I know you love me even with this path I choose
I hear you call my name
Anytime at all, anytime at all

I'll warm your heart 10.000 miles away
