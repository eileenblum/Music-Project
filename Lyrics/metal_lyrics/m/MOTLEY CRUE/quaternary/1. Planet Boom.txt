[music &amp; lyrics: Tommy Lee]

Rhythm denotes the regular pattern flow
Of sound and movement and speech ya know
Rhythm dictates the soul to stop and go
Of the sound that moves the streets ya know
In a natural phenomenon boom
And it makes ya wanna do it 'til you gotta go

Boom over here, boom over there, boom everywhere
Boom over here, boom over there, boom everywhere

The beat is sweet and it melts in your mouth
This ain't no shit, no doubt
You gotta shake things break things
Everybody take things to a higher level

Pumpin' jumpin' a physical activity
Pumpin' jumpin' a physical profanity

I make a drum speak the language of rhythm
I create this boom for you

Boom over here, boom over there, boom everywhere
Boom over here, boom over there, boom everywhere
