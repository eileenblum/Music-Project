My girlfriend says I can't do this
My wife says don't do that
Another case of P.M.S.
Gonna have a heart attack
I need a small vacation
Maybe fly Jamaica's way
Told my lawyers and accountants
Done took all I can take

Oh no livin' in the no
One more mother breathin' down my neck
I think I will explode
Oh no livin' in the no (how'd ya like to live your life)
Everyday, everywhere I go it's livin' in the no

TV says dead for Christmas
Stalkers on the loose
Another freeway shooting
And I'll be hangin' by a noose
I can't seem to shake it
I guess it's a bad news spell
Special thanks to Mom and Dad
For bringing me to hell

You heard about what "magic" caught
Too many penthouse pets
Oh don't forget your protection baby
Lord knows you might be next.
