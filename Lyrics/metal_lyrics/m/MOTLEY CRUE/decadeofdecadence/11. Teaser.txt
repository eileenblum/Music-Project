That woman's got a smile
Puts you in a trance
And just one look at her
Makes you want to dance

Those dark an rosy lips
Only passify
With just a hint of ruthlessness
Sparkling in her eye

She's a teaser, and she's got no heart at all
She's a teaser, and she'll tempt you 'til you
Yes she'll tempt you 'til you fall She'll talk to you in riddles
That have no sence, or rhyme
And if you ask her what she means
She says, she don't got no time

She's a teaser, and she's got no heart at all
She's a teaser, and she'll tempt you 'til you
Yes she'll tempt you 'til you fall

She's a teaser, and she's got no heart at all
She's a teaser, and she'll tempt you 'til you
Yes she'll tempt you 'til you fall
