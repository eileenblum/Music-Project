I've been an alleycat, I lived nine lives
Just like a fine wine, I'm better with time
Like a diamondback rattlesnake
I have the rattle if it had the shake

[Pre-Chorus]
Until you, gimme something to believe in
Until you, gimme something to sink my teeth into

[Chorus]
Now when the winds cry Angela
Angela, I'll be there for you
And when the storms scream Angela
Angela, I'll be there

I've been a poet always tongue in cheek
I've seen some scenes man you'd never believe
And like a supercharged rocket ride
You know they'd have gasoline if they had the time (Pre-Chorus)
[Chorus]

Oh Angela
Oh Angela
When the winds cry Angela

Save me - I'm a suck soul sucker in this whiskey ghost town
Save me - Get me in your saddle and ride me into the ground

[Solo]

Ooooh ooooh ooooh, Angela
Ooooh ooooh ooooh, yeah!

[Chorus]

Oh Angela
Oh Angela
Now when the winds cry Angela
Baby, baby I'll be there
