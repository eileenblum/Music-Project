Oh I am an anti-Christ
And I am an anarchist
Don't know what I want
But I know how to get it
I wanna destroy the passers by
'Cause I, I wanna be, anarchy
In this fuckin' city

Anarchy for the USA
It's coming sometime, maybe
Give the wrong time
Stop a traffic line
Your future dream is a shopping scheme
'Cause I wanna be, anarchy
Well it's the only way to be

[Solo]

Ha ha ha ha ha ha
There are many ways to get what you want I use the best, well I use the rest
Well I use the enemy
I use anarchy
'Cause I, I wanna be, anarchy
Fuck the rat race man

Is this the PMRC
Or is this the DEA
Or is this the CIA
I thought it was the U.S.A.
Or just another country
Some other fuckin' country
And I, wanna be, anarchy
Oh I wanna fuckin' hear it man
And I, wanna be, anarchy
Let's say it again boys
And I, wanna be, anarchy
Fuckin' destroy
