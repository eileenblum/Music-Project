She's only fifteen
She's the reason-the reason that I can't sleep
You say illegal
I say legal's never been my scene
I try like hell but I'm out of control

All in the name of rock 'n' roll
For sex and sex I'd sell my soul

Pretty, pretty so innocent
She says you ain't seen nothing yet
Brings me a dirty, dirty magazine
There she was for all the world to see
I try like hell but I'm out of control. All in the name of rock 'n' roll
For sex and sex I'd sell my soul

Says to me daddy
Can I have some candy
Wanna be your nasty
Anytime you want
You know you can have me

All in the name of rock 'n' roll
