Foolish bride call me up, beg to scratch her itch
Rich old man got the needle, slipped and dropped a stitch
Name the time, name the price leave your door unlocked
I'll bring a toy guaranteed to put the spring in your shocks

Sumthin' for Nuthin'

Gigolo sounds so cold, call me teacher's pest
Twice a day, double pay, at my trade I'm the best
Never late, watch her watch seconds on the clock
Overtime, break my back, slip and fall in the crack

Sumthin' for Nuthin'
Well in and out, it's never free
Sumthin' for Nuthin'
Leave the money where it's easy to see She plays the role of a roving matriarch
Diamond rings, fancy things, Dubonnet on the rocks
For a treat gave it free-happy 63
Crazy days, easy money-I was just 16
Easy money for such a good deed

Sumthin' for Nuthin'
Ya, in and out it's never free
Sumthin' for Nuthin'
Satisfaction guaranteed
Sumthin' for Nuthin'
Target practice in the dark
Sumthin' for Nothin'
I'm a crack shot on the mark

And I love my work
