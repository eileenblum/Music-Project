[Talk]
This one recorded live
Right here tonight
And I think you've got the fuckin' jive
Cause we've got some bad-beat boogie-woogie
For ya, boys
Here we go.

The warden threw a party in the county jail
The prison band was there and they began to wail
The band was jumpin', now the joint began to swing
You should have heard the night that jailbird sang

[Chorus]
Let's rock
Everybody let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock

Sad Sacker Sid was on a block of stone
With Opel in the corner weeping all alone
The warden said, "Hey man, don't you be no square
If you can't find a partner us a wooden chair"

[Chorus]

(Hey) (Hey) (Hey) (Hey) # 47 said to # 3
"Well, you're the cutest jailbird I ever did see
I sure would be delighted with your company
Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me"

[Chorus]
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
Everybody in the whole cell block...ROCK!!!

[Talk]
One more time!!!

(Hey) (Hey) (Hey)

Well, everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
Everybody in the whole cell block...woo-hoo, yeah!!!

Dancin' to the Jailhouse, yeah-whoo!!!

We're Motley Crue!!!

C-ya!
