[on re-released disc]

Laughing like gypsies, show to show
Livin' my life like a rolling stone
This is how my story unfolds
Traveling man, never at home
Can't find love so I sleep alone
This whiskey river has along way to flow
All that I know is life on this road
Long way from home
In this Rodeo
Rodeo
Rodeo
Rodeo
Rodeo
Not my home
Another day, another night on stage
Lights go down, time to turn the page
Was this all I ever wanted to be
Six hundred miles, the highway calls
Another long day, now the hours get small
Riding out this rock n roll rodeo
All that I kow is life on this road
Long way from home
In this Rodeo
Rodeo
Rodeo
Rodeo
Rodeo
Not my home
All that I kow
Is life on this road
Long way from home
In this Rodeo
Rodeo
Rodeo
Rodeo
Rodeo
