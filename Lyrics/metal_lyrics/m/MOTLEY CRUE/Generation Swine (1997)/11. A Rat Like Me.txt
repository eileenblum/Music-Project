can you smell sarcasm on my breath??
I'm a new age puppet strung out on death
a rat like me won't save the world
a freak like me
a rat like me won't save your world
going down and killin' time
down down down
I do the dance of the cursed everyday
there's nobody worse nowhere no way

a rat like me won't save this world
a shit like me
a rat like me won't save the world
going down one step away
down down down
everybody's bangin' on this landmine
everybody's sippin? on their pain
I am not alone in my head here
but I'll gladly take the blame
I'm a snot nosed nuclear sonic punk

a rat like me won't save the world
a man like me
a dog like me won't save
a worm like me won't save
a rat like me won't save the world
going down and killin' time
down down down

rat dog worm freak
