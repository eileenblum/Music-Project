I hear a voice in my head going 'round
it's been talkin' to me 4 awhile
inject my soul with the truth, do you dare??
oh my god it's time 4a prayer
going down,
breakin' down, I'm underground
time 4 a prayer isolate, I contemplate
time 4 a prayer physical, I'm miserable
forgive me father for I have sinned
god is my sanity split in two??
all this time and I still feel the pain
oh my god it's time 4 a prayer
I'm going down, breakin' down, I'm underground
time 4 a prayer aggravate, I contemplate
time 4 a prayer physical, I'm miserable

don't ya make me go searching for my soul
