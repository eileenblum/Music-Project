you bring those tears into my eyes so well
I've been waiting for this day so long
brandon I love you, you are the one brandon my son
you run around, and chase the clouds,
I only want you to be yourself
forget me not, you're all I've got
as you can see you are the one, brandon my son
your mother gave birth to you with love inside
she had candlelight and songs of life
brandon I love you, I love her, she is your mom
true love is ours, nobody else
I only want you to be yourself,
and when I'm gone, don't cry for me

we'll always be one...you are my son,
you are the one...you are the one
