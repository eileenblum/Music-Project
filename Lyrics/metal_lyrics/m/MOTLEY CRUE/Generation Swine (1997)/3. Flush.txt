I __ I'm feeling rot
I'm feeling rotten today
I __ guess I forgot
I am shot I'm not o.k.
so long to pain, so long to games
so long say good-bye

someone tell me why, I'm feeling cold inside
do I wanna, do I wanna die
someone tell me why it's building up inside
do I wanna die and kiss it all good-bye?

__ I'm a sinking ship
on a sea of bliss, I'm not o.k.
I __ I'm blind to this
is this just a test to help me see

so long to you, so long to me
so long say good-bye
someone tell me why, I'm feeling broke inside
do I wanna, do I wanna die
can you tell me why it's building up inside
do I wanna die and kiss it all good-bye?
. . . you're the reason I would live
. . . . . . I hope that you can give me this
. . . you're the reason
so long to pain, so long to games
so long say good-bye

can you tell me why, I'm feeling dead
do I wanna, do I wanna die
someone tell why it's building up inside
do I wanna kiss it all good-bye?
