fly to the moon
we'll take my rocketship
it's outta sight
oh so outta sight
leave your head
check into this time
check your mind
let your sparkle shine

pass the sun
say goodbye to everyone
we'll fall in love
as we pass the sun
hang from a star
forget just who we are
it's outta sight
oh so outta sight
from the moon
to the stars
to the sun
baby I'm in love
