I'm the reason women bleed
it's been called the curse of eve
ancient times to modern lies you know my name
turned your pleasures into pain
you made love I give you aids
my pollution gives you cancer of the brain
yet to me you sell your soul
fame and glory plated gold
you're such an easy prey for me please let us prey
please let us hunt
7 million bodies lying dead beneath my hands
war was such a simple game to play
preachers do my bidding yet blame me for their
sins
altar boys are taken in dismay
kill and eat your neighbors
gas a subway in japan
I got more apocalyptic plans
please let us prey
please let us hunt
suicide...genocide
