[on re-released disc]

Please, won't you ride with me
Don't you know that things will be ok
Please won't you glide with me
Spread our wings and things will be ok
Kiss it away, kiss it away, tomorrow
Wash it away, wash it away, rain
Wish it away, wish it away, the sorrow
Tomorrow, tomorrow

We can fly, kiss the sky, if we try
We'll find the place that love goes
We can fly, stay so high, kiss the sky
We'll find the place that love grows

Squeeze every drop from me
Stay with me and see the lovers climb
Kiss it away kiss it away tomorrow
Wash it awya, wash it away
Where we've been
Wish it away, wish it away
The sorrow, tomorrow
comes today We can fly, kiss the sky, if we try
We'll find the place that love goes
We can fly stay so high, kiss the sky
We'll find the place that love grows

We can fly, kiss the sky, if we try
We'll find the place that love goes
We can fly stay so high, kiss the sky
We'll find the place that love grows

We can fly, kiss the sky, if we try
We'll find the place that love goes
We can fly stay so high, kiss the sky
We'll find the place that love grows
We can fly, kiss the sky, if we try
We'll find the place that love goes
We can fly stay so high, kiss the sky
We'll find the place that love grows
