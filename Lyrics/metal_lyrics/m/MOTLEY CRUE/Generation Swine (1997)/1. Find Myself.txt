I gotta find myself some love
I gotta find myself some drugs
I gotta find some liquid sunshine
igotta find myself, I gotta find myself
I'm a sick motherfucker
I'm a sweet sucka mutha
ain't no one tougher
in a wreck, I'm a sleaze
I'm a rock n roll disease
I'm a pusher, I'm a shover
ain't no motherfucker tougher

I gotta find myself some glue
I gotta find some suction
now my aim is destruction
I gotta find myself, I gotta find myself
I'm a drunk motherfucker
I'm a smacked out lover
ain't no one tougher
I'm a dick, I'm your master
I'm a rock n roll disaster
I'm a pusher, I'm a shover
I'm your dirt bag lover
I got to deal with my neurosis
I got to deal with my neurosis
I gotta find myself some love
igotta find myself some drugs
I gots ta sniffs myself some glue
I got to find some turpentine for you...you you you...
I got to find myself
destruction
