Black Angels laughing in the city streets
Street toys scream in pain and clench their teeth
The moonlight spotlights all the city crime
Got no religion, Laugh while they fight

Save our souls for the heavens
For a life so good it sure feels bad
Save our souls for the heavens
Save our souls for the promised land

Sweet tarts play the game and shoot to thrill
Runnin free through the trash, dressed to kill
The midnight show-stoppers, it's a funny money game
A hundred thousand bleeding hearts, put us in our graves Save our souls for the
heavens
For a life so good it sure feels bad
Save our souls for the heavens
Save our souls for the promised land

It s been the hard road, edge of an overdose
No matter how high you re still too low
I've been the dancer, the wicked romancer
It's a never-ending nightmare, edge of disaster
