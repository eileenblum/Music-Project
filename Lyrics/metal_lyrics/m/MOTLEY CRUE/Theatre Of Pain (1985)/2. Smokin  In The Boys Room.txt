Did you ever seem to have one of those days when everyone's on your case
From your teacher all the way down to your best girlfriend
Well, you know, I used to have it just about all the time
But I found a way to get out of it
Let me tell you about

Sittin' in the classroom thinkin' it's a drag
Listening to the teacher rap-just ain't my bag
When two bells ring you know it's my cue
I'm gonna meet the boys on floor number 2

Smokin' in the boys room
Smokin' in the boys room
Nah, teacher don't you fill me up with your rules
'Cause everybody knows that smokin' ain't allowed in school

Checkin' out the hall making sure the coast is clear
Lookin' in the stalls-nah, there ain't nobody here
My buddy Sixx, Mick &amp; Tom
To get caught would surely be the death of us all

Smokin' in the boys room
Aah, we're smokin' in the boys room
Nah, teacher don't you fill me up with your rules
'Cause everybody knows that smokin' ain't allowed in school

Hey, could I be excused?

Well, put me to work in the school book store
Check-out counter and I got bored
Teacher was lookin' for me all around
Two hours later you know where I was found

Smokin' in the boys room
I tell you, I was smokin' in the boys room
Nah, nah, nah, teacher don't you fill me up with your rule
'Cause everybody knows that smokin' ain't allowed in school

Everybody

Smokin' in the boys room
Smokin' in the boys room
I tell you, I was smokin' in the boys room
Smokin' in the boys room
Hey, teacher don't you fill me up with your rule
'Cause everybody knows that smokin' ain't allowed in school

One more

Smokin' in the boys room
Smokin' in the boys room
Now, teacher I'm foolin' around with your rule
'Cause everybody knows that smokin' ain't allowed in school
