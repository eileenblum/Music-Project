At times I feel turned around
And upside down
Sometimes maybe I drink too much
But, I mean, my heart's still in touch

Hey, I remember standing tall saying
"I'm gonna be a rock n roll star!"
When someone said "Sit down, boy,
You already are!"

Yeah, so raise your hands to rock (rock)
Raise your hands to rock (rock)
Raise your hands to rock (rock)
Raise your hands to rock

Summertime was always right
Just me and you
Sixteen and dealing with those
Summertime blues

I was young and restless then
Living on the edge of a dream
When someone said "C'mon, boy, you just gotta believe!"

Yeah, so raise your hands to rock (rock)
Raise your hands to rock (rock)
Raise your hands to rock (rock)
Raise your hands to rock
