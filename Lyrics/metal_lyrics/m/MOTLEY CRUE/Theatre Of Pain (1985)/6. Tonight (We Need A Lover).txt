Ninety thousand screaming watts
Honey dripping from her pot
Fill the cup to the top tonight
This deadly sin is all we know
Pleasure victim, who's next to fall
The question is will you please us all tonight?

Tonight tonight tonight
We need a lover tonight
We need a lover tonight
We need a lover tonight
We need a lover

Stand tall and ring the bell
The final stroke sends you to hell
Take your body like a hammer and a nail
The taste of love, it might be yours Slide down my knees taste my sword
Can you feel the power inside tonight?

Tonight tonight tonight
We need a lover tonight
We need a lover tonight
We need a lover tonight
We need a lover

Tonight, we need a lover tonight
We need a lover tonight
We need a lover tonight
We need a lover

Tonight tonight
