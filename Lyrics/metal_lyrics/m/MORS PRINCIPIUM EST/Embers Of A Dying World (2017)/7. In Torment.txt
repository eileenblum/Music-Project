Darkness has fallen, yet I see a tiny speck of light
From the start of time, till the end of time
For eons of nights

A voice is calling, from the deepest endless black of space
From a faceless God, till the end of time
Lays us to waste

Should I regret the things Iâve done?
Or turn my back on everyone?
Darkness is summoning within
But light will free me of this sin

Darkness has fallen, yet I see an ember from the sun
From the dawn of time, it has burned for us
But itâs time has come

A voice has spoken, yet I cannot turn my back and run
From the endless shame, I cannot escape
What I have done

Should I regret the men Iâve slain?
Or is this life a senseless game?
Darkness is summoning within
But light will free me of this sin

Cast them all into the ashes of the sun
And leave the gods to judge me
Never, shall I repent what I have done
For there is light within me

My torment lives on and on
And suffocates my soul
To this life that I was grown
I wonât grow old
My torment lives on and on
And suffocates my soul
To this life that I was grown
I wonât grow old

Should I regret the things Iâve done?
Or turn my back on everyone?
Darkness is summoning within
But light will free me of this sin

Cast them all into the ashes of the sun
And leave the gods to judge me
Never, shall I repent what I have done
For there is light within me

My torment lives on and on
And suffocates my soul
To this life that I was grown
I wonât grow old
My torment lives on and on
And suffocates my soul
To this life that I was grown
I wonât grow old
