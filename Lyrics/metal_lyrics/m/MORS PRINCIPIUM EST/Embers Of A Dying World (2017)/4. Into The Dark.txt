May I introduce the glorious death?
He waits for all until their final breath
He stands before you but you will never see
The faceless shadow that you are soon to be

A presence grips you with a nameless fear
You mourn the dead but they will soon be near
He stands before you but you will never know
Into the black of night you will go

When fourteen years has passed
The ghost of the damned will possess you
Our fate will become obsolete
When the blind are leading the blind

Before the morning he will take his prize
For every man is cursed until he dies
And all you knew or loved just fades away
You will never live another day

The time has come to leave the world behind
A deathly sleep from which youâll never rise
No god to save you as you turn and run
The only god is death and he has won

As your final days draw near
You feel his grip upon you
A battle you cannot win
As the sun dives into the eternal night

The mighty answer on the frozen sky
Lay forth your spirit, to behold on high
And see the pale moon shiver and depart
Behind the sea, the sun, the sun ascends

We may stand at the shore
Watching the last rays of the sun
So cold when the night falls
And one more time the sun says goodbye

The mighty answer on the frozen sky
Lay forth your spirit, to behold on high
And see the pale moon shiver and depart
Behind the sea, the sun, the sun ascends
The sun ascends!
