Thereâs a man in a cell with a mask on his face
He was taken from the, from the final masquerade
No more enemies, only demons left to fear
This is the end, the final revolution

He stands facing the wall, forget the old war
All the memories, all the pain that we came for
And now the mask it fades, revealing for all to see
His closing memories of a price that he pays for

Under the full moon, winter sky
I saw a soldier, walk on by
He sang an anthem, a song for free
As he went up, to eternity

In all his dreams, before this hopeless night
He saw a thousand, soldiers in twilight
The sang an anthem, a song for free
As they went up, to eternity

(This is the end)
(This is the final revolution)

Open the skies
Open the gates
Donât leave me out
Open the gates

Thereâs a man in a cell with a mask on his face
He was taken from the, from the final masquerade
And now the mask it fades, revealing for all to see
This is the end, the final revolution

Under the full moon
They sang an anthem

Under the full moon, winter sky
I saw a soldier, walk on by
He sang an anthem, a song for free
As he went up, to eternity

In all his dreams, before this hopeless night
He saw a thousand, soldiers in twilight
They sang an anthem, a song for free
As they went up, to eternity
