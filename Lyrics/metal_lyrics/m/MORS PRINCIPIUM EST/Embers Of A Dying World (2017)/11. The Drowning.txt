[Vinal Release Track]Let my ship go down
Let it sink to the very first grave
I'll let the world drown my every last breath

I understand, the meaning of losing
The choice of choosing
Between life and death

If I could drown in a shallow sea
Maybe then this life, was real to me
If I could only, make you believe
Maybe then you just could follow me

I am looking up on you
From the depths of the trench that I dug
The tides dissolve the skies above me

I understand, the meaning of losing
The choice of choosing
Between life and death

If I could drown in a shallow sea
Maybe then this life, was real to me
If I could only, make you believe
Maybe then you just could follow me

I feel the waves wash the blood from my veins
And tear my flesh from the rust of these chains
I hear the voices, they'll calling to me
Step off the shore and step into the sea
I feel the ocean, it drags me below
And tears the unliving flesh from my bones
I try to hold my breath as long as I can
But then I let go and take a deep breath

If I could drown in a shallow sea
Maybe then this life, was real to me
If I could only, make you believe
Maybe then you just could follow me

Just let it go
Just let it go
Just let it go!
