The day your life was stolen away
Was the day the sun burnt bright
And now you've gone to another place
To have another try in some other life

Everyday the memory haunts me
You lying there on a bed in tubes, all lifeless
There's no more life in you
No more time was given to you
Fear not, we will meet again

No, I never wanted you to go
I never wanted you to show
What this life would be without you

I never wanted to know
I never wanted to see
That this horrible dream could be real

From the day you were born
To the day you were gone
You were everything I could dream of
My beautiful green eyed child
You brighten my life with your smile
And now they have taken you away

Everyday the memory haunts me
You lying there on a bed in tubes, all lifeless
There's no more life in you
No more time was given to you
Fear not, we will meet again

I never wanted you to go...
Why did you have to go?

Everyday the memory haunts me
You lying there on a bed in tubes, all lifeless
There's no more life in you
No more time was given to you
Fear not, we will meet again
We will meet again

No, I never wanted you to go
I never wanted you to show
What this life would be without you

I never wanted to know
I never wanted to see
That this horrible dream could be real.
