Cut down the trees
Burn them all to ash
Make the flames go high
So the smoke covers the sky

Suffocate the lungs
Breathe in the fumes
No hope to change the past
This is the road to doom

Collapse, all I see
The world shall fall around me
Nothing left but greed
Black wings of death surround me

I am destroyer
I will make the gods hear me
I feel immortal
Misery I behold
I am destroyer
I destroy everything I own
I am immortal
My stories will be told

Dig down the ground
Impale the earth
Make the whole world tremble
Beneath my feet

Drain the earth from life
Forget the world
No hope to turn back time
It is our time to die

Collapse, all I see
The world shall fall around me
Nothing, left but greed
Black wings of death surround me

As we reach the point of no return
We will all finally realize
It is our destiny, our destiny
Our destiny is to fade into extinction

I am destroyer
I will make the gods hear me
I feel immortal
Misery I behold
I am destroyer
I destroy everything I own
I am immortal
My stories will be told
I am destroyer
I am immortal
I am destroyer
I am destroyer
