If I could travel between the stars and create another force
The speed will tear my soul apart
The journey takes me far away
Beyond the edge of time and space, will I ever reach the end?

The colours of cosmos â are draped around me
Itâs time to wake up â my destiny has found me
I see a billion stars
Their light will guide me
But have I gone too far?
Itâs all behind me

Oh mighty father, release my flesh
And let me see what lies behind those dreams
I am your son, all alone and weak
I will make you proud â you will see me bleed

(Beyond the edge of time and space)
(In the darkness I ascend)

Iâd rather die tonight with pride than live another shameless day
Iâd sacrifice it all for this
The journey takes me to my end
But in the darkness I ascend
And here Iâll find my fatherâs pride

Your words will break me â forgot the past
Break down the unknown â find out the mystery
Forget the reasons â the shadows haunt me
Iâm slowly gliding â to dark horizon

Go!

The colours of cosmos â are draped around me
Itâs time to wake up â my destiny has found me
I see a billion stars
Their light will guide me
But have I gone too far?
Itâs all behind me

Oh mighty father, release my flesh
And let me see what lies behind those dreams
I am your son, all alone and weak
I will make you proud â you will see me bleed
Oh mighty father, release my flesh
And let me see what lies behind those dreams
I am your son, all alone and weak
I will make you proud â you will see me bleed
