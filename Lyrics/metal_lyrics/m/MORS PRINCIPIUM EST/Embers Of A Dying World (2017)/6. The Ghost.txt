You know the secret of death?
Now you will find it, just seek the heart of life
For life and death are one, as the river and the sea
That met in the darkest of dreams

And now the time has come
To take your sacred vow
The dawn is over but eternal night, has just begun
You trade your mortal life
To live an endless day
But never more you'll feel the light, for in the shadows you'll remain

Your fear of death, when you stand before the king
Trust the dreams, they hold the key to eternity
Behold death, open your heart for lies
For what is to die, when you wear the sign of the sky

And now the time has come
And at his feet you'll bow
Hand over every day you've ever lived, it's over now
You draw your final breath
And speak your final words
You'll live forever but your mortal soul...
Is cast to stone

Your time is over
Become the ghost that haunts their dreams
You'll live forever
But your new life's not what it seems
A new beginning
Forget the man you've left behind
Your life is over
But here a new path you will find

You know the secret of death?
Now you will find it, just seek the heart of life
For life and death are one, as the river and the sea
That met in the darkest of dreams

Your time is over
Become the ghost that haunts their dreams
You'll live forever
But your new life's not what it seems
A new beginning
Forget the man you've left behind
Your life is over
But here a new path you will find
