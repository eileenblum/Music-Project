He lost the heavens war
He never found the way
Over the misty sea
Just like the sun he shined
Looking beneath the waves
That one returned no more
Just so you know
The loss was planned indeed

He may rule his world
From his throne of lies
But you're the only one
Who knows the truth of him

Show me the other worlds
These signs of grief
And all that lives
Will move up from the earth
He lost the heavens war
He never found the way
Just so you know
The loss was planned indeed

Afraid the nations will fall
Do more to win their love
But you're the only one
Who knows the truth of him

They may call you the prince of lies
Against the odds you once fell
From high above like a star
The bringer of light

And now the end is near
Apocalypse is here
And you shall rise once again
From your shallow grave

Now pass through the unknown
But still i know
When they tore all his wings
I heard a mournful cry
And all the angels wept
Their tears burnt the sky
It echoed through the heavens
As one of their own just died

Afraid the nations will fall
Do more to win their love
He may rule his world
From his throne of lies
