And then from the mountains
To the river of Acheron
Maybe one day they will meet again
Like friends once departed

At first light they will leap, leaving light behind
And where they will end, they will need no sun as a guide
At moon-time they will flow to the worlds below
To the meadows of asphodel

Farewell my only friend, this night will be our last
Tonight we drink from Lethe and lose our past

Farewell my only friend, this night will be our last
Tonight we drink from Lethe and lose our past
These body erasing waters, minds and souls are splitting
When human beings have finished, they're just beginning

But if we live in Elysium, i pray we do
Then we all shall prosper, hand in hand
To be among the chosen, only few
When we get the call from the gods, then we must go
