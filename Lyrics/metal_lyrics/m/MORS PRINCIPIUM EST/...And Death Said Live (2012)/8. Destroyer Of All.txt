It's time for a fight
It's time for another round
I'll take you down with the fire
Never again, never again
I will fight
I will fight for the last time
I'll show you the meaning of hell
One more time, one more time

Now hear the lies of the unborn child
Nothing but truth will be told when you kill the
Spawn
Now bring their souls against the wall and forget
Them all
Just paint the sky fully red with their blood

See this blade
This blade is gonna slice you up
I will skin you down from
Head to toe, head to toe
The fire burns within my soul
It won't fade away
Maybe i'll survive
To see another day

For a century i will hold the key
To open the gates to this forgotten world
When it's time to leave all across the seas
I will close the gates and find another place

For a century i will hold the key
To open the gates to this forgotten world
When it's time to leave all across the seas
I will close the gates and crush the human race
