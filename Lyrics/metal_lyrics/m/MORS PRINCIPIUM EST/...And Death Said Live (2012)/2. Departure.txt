You paid the price for my desires
To satisfy my burning lust
I felt temptation taking over me
I lost control of what was real
I am aware of other times
It's like a dream of another game
I thought that this would never end
Pull me out from this dark country of the dead

I will never forgive you
For all the things you made me do
I will never forget you
For all the things you put me through

I can never forget you
I can sense your body next to mine
I will never lose you
You will always be here with me
I can live, but you can't die
Closed like the love that bound me

You can't touch, you can't feel
The wounds i closed will never heal
You can't hear, you can't speak
But still i hear you calling me
I can smell, i can taste
And twine your arms around me
I didn't mean to kill you
I only tried to hurt you
But once i saw all your bloody tears
I laid you down and let you die
