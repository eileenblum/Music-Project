And when the time was right for us to march to war
We took our weapons and went before the storm
This is another time and this is another place
This is what i was born to face

This burning planet that we do call our home
Forsaking others we are drifting all alone
Each passing day it's turning into a worthless hole
Living in denial means you're not living at all

Be free, for thee, i call for the open colors
In another existence of time and life
For me, this means an utter extinction
An end to an existence of time and life

To be killed, or be the one who kills
I had to make that choice before i lose my thrill
So when the time was right for us to march to war
We left our weapons and went into the storm

Is this the way we were designed to be?
Another man killing for another man's land
I don't want this to be like this
No food for the starving, no water for the thirsty
Is this the way we want the future to be?

We are the ones who can change all of this
We keep on fighting the eternal war
And this will be our final fall

I don't want this to end like this
The women are crying and the children are dying
Is this the way we want the future to end?
We are the ones who should change all of this
Maybe we just keep on fighting the eternal war
And this will be our last big fight
