Who are you warlike men
Wearing grey armour that is stained by rust?
Breaking the ocean surge
Warden of deserted shores
Stands on his abandoned coast
Leading troops over the sea
None of them have landed yet
One last sleep 'till the end

Mother ocean, spread your arms around me
Mother ocean, let your children come towards me
Under my lonely sky
He is no common man
And when the raven died
I stared into his cold eyes
I saw it all unfold
And saw what this life was about

Beneath my wings my brothers lie
When the fierce winds hurtle by
On either side and 'neath my breast
Our sons have known no other rest

[William Sharp]
O' mighty father, lead us far
With hope and songs of love and war
Over the black sea and white foam
From here their children will find home
Remember days from long ago
Slowly we wander to and fro
But now dead winds that blur the light
Pierce deep our feathers thin and light
