Three thousand years of sleep, but now i'm
Awake
The moments were divided by invertible pain
They seemed like years of torture and
Solitude,
Despair and scorched in eternal fire

Far more glorious than you could dream
I ruled them from my iron throne
Oh mighty lord, oh mighty don't let them
Forget
The fact, that they betray

Now that i'm back in the throne
I will never be all alone
I will make you pay the price
For locking me up inside
You thought i would never return
But one thing you should learn
A true king never forgets
You betray me

Three thousand years of sleep, but now have
Returned
A fleeting eternity, my strength regained
Black wintery dead, absent of color
Insect or beast, unmeasured by all life

The sufferings of man's mortality
I should weigh the sands, the sands of reality
Where all these things could pass us by
But i will not be deaf and blind
All but my pride they gave me back
And the agony they do not show
This suffocating sense of silence
They should use their voice until it's echoless
