I feel much stronger
Everyday when I'm trying to be like this
I'm getting stronger
Feed me energy

I will start the day now
With a fire that swallows them all
The day will start now
With annihilation

I am a war machine
Death and destruction I breed
I'll give you war with many faces
Some say I terminate
I'm here to liberate
This is what you all been waiting for

Claustrophobic human race
Don't know how to hate
Not even if they all live in fear
It may be false or real
They believe what they see
Well I can show you all the facts

Liberate, terminate, annihilate
It's all the same to me

Claustrophobic human race
Don't know how to hate
Not even if they all live in fear
I am a war machine
Death and destruction I breed
This is what you all been waiting for
