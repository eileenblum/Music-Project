So many miles away from the place
Where this journey once begun
I was sent to find another place
And a reason four our existence.
Now I travel deeper into the space
I may even find another race
Do you know I'm entering to Mars
or am I just lost between the stars?

I'm here but never completely free
Between the worlds that you see
All alone is cold emptiness
No one hear me scream.

I have been here for far too long,
My memories starts to fade.
Still I think what they used to say
About this journey into the space.
"You will be back, I promise you.
Just enjoy your time up there."
But now the time has come for me
when I wish, I wish I could get back home.

I'm here but never completely free
Between the worlds that you see.
All alone in cold emptiness
No one hear me scream.

To find another solution
I have traveled so far
Maybe I could find the answer
For who we are
