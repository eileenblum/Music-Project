I see when the sky turns black
The clouds start to cry
Then the rain starts to fall
It feels like a burning acid
The tears run down my cheek
They are so salty and sweet
I don't know what is happening
I hope the rain will never end

This rain will wash away my sins
It almost feels like a second skin

The burning feeling
That I have when the sun comes out
Could the storm just appear to the sky
And push away the sun
I have always lived in the rain
For me it's not a game
Through the tears the moon looks silver
And the flames makes me feel so cold

This rain will wash away my sins
It almost feels like a second skin

These tears falling
Blinding, taunting
Endless mourning
My tears falling
These eyes bleeding
Endless yearning
Blinding, taunting
My tears falling
