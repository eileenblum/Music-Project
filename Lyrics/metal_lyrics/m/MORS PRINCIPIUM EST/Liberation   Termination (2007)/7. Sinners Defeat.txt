You may keep me as a sinner
A servant for suffering
I tore the skins from the liars
And send them burning to the sea

Now tear down all the liars
We must make them pay for all
We will rule and dominate you
Your worthless soul belongs to us

Now march
Like a slave that's who you are
Now run
Before the beast is free

No darkness for us all
We pray for eternal night
No darkness for us all
We hope the sun will never shine

Stand tall and mighty in front of your wife
She will see when her family falls
Your suffering will begin tonight
There's no guiding light, it's the end for your light
