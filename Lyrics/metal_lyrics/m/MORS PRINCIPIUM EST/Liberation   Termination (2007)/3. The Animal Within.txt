No way, to break all these chains
No time, to free your wings and fly
Just pain, is what you will feel
Don't cry, I will make you sleep

Trust me, you will not get loose
With this, I know what to do
One thing there is for you to do
Bring yourself for the final feast

Feed me and I will be your king
Let me taste your sweet flesh,
I'll suck it all in me
Feed me and you will be my queen
I just need your sweet flesh,
I'm living in a spiders dream
