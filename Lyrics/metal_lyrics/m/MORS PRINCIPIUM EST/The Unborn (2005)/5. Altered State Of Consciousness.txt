I see the face, the face keeps watching me
I told to stop
But he just keeps on laughing at me
No time to think, no time to rest
I think these pills
Are making my mind a mess
To ease my pain from this fucking dream
I have to ask, are you another me?
And what he says, he asks from me:
Don't you know or are you too blind to see?

This is my life, this is my life
So why do all these
Doors keep on closing me
And then it comes, another flash
There's always me
And maybe one, two, three
To ease my pain from this fucking dream
I have to ask, are you another me?
And what he says, he asks from me:
Don't you know or are you too blind to see?

I'm ready to go, but what about me
If I close my eyes am I all alone?
I wanted to cry, but I am too weak
To leave the shadows and all behind
I wonder could this be real
Then the only thing I find is peace
... Is peace

The time is ticking,
Oh the time is running out
The picture on the wall,
it's me, there is no doubt
What does these voices say?
What can they say?
There's only one thing left to say

I'm ready to go, but what about me
If I close my eyes am I all alone?
I wanted to cry, but I am too weak
To leave the shadows and all behind
I wonder could this be real
Then the only thing I find is peace
... Is peace
