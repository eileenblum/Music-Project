The world is the future
A whore to a strong man
Our weakened feet will try
To dwell in a lie
They tell me we're losin'
Our talent of using
The dead mans' deed as guide

We praised in the name of God, no never again
We saw the death that raped the blood of all those men
We praised in the name of God, no never again
We found the thought that plagued this world
It was strong and blind...

The weaker must die
Dark is the night that had set to your mind

The weaker must die
Sweet is the pride that reflects in your eyes

And as the morning comes
We bear the burdens of our crimes
A human claims a rightful share of pain
Paint the sky with black
And forever and ever burn
And burn

We burned in the name of God, no never again
The holy flames that craved the flesh, were lit unpure
We screamed in the name of God, no never again
We found the thought that plagued this world
It was strong and blind...

As we head towards eternal
For the better, for this time
We let go all these bound aries
For the last time I repent

The weaker must die
Dark is the night that had set to your mind

The weaker must die
Sweet is the pride that reflects in your eyes

The weaker must die
Dark is the night that had set to your mind
