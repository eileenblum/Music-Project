You go piece and piece but your world is bound
There was of this mirror only shown
Darken image at the back of flesh
I am least the one who cries

Just the air firing red at the sky
Fear are all the filth in your eyes
You can't understand what can you see
The world changes, there's no tomorrow

So the world shall fear me
Like the silence in my heart
And the peace shall tear me
Through the darkness in my heart
So the world shall fear me
Like the silence in my heart
And the peace shall tear me
And the worries of the arrival
