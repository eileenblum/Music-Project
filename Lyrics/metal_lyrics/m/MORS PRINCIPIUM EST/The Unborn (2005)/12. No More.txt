[Bonus Track]

Your tear has stopped before me
It's like, just like a disease
They need new soul
They need new flesh
To be alive again

Escape, from reality
Arise, go blind
You change the day and the find the place
Where to be again

No tear in my eyes
Don't want to be
Feel my heart, feel it beating
No fear in my eyes
Don't want to be
I am no more, I am no more
