I've seen as the ages pass by
I have seen much death
My minions bow before me
When they pray for the last breath
As they look to the sky for the last time
They will know what will be
The rulers of the Underworld will
Make the body not to heal

With the burnt desire
We broke the ravens back
The parasites of paradise
Will prevail

The time of the purification
And the time is now
The harvester of the mankind
Will collect it's prays
Even the rats know one thing:
No one will stay
The way of mankind has been
terminated, blown away

Now rise, the ancient lords of destruction
Now rise, and purify the world from its plague
Now rise, the ancient lords of disorder
Now rise, eradicate the era of mankind

With the burnt desire
We broke the ravens back
The parasites of paradise
Will prevail

I've seen as the ages pass by
I have seen much death
My minions bow before me
When they pray for the last breath
The harvester of the mankind
Will collect it's prays
The circle has been locked
The key thrown away

Now rise, the ancient lords of destruction
Now rise, and purify the world from its plague
Now rise, the ancient lords of disorder
Now rise, eradicate the era of mankind
