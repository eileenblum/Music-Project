I can not bear this pain anymore
My heart is pinned down to the floor
I feel my body starts to fail
The color of my skin turns to grey
I start to sing my last goodbyes
The tears fill the blood red sky
For I'm the one who stands alone
In the crossroad of the soul

I am the one who stands alone

Don't cry for me I'm almost gone
My destiny has been undone
When I feel the mind goes dumb
Then the darkness has its' fun
What can I do to be more strong?
Maybe then I will go home
I'm always two steps away
From the last redemption day

I am always two steps away

Now take me
Now brake me
Now take my hand and make me see
Now take me
Now brake me
Now take my scars and let me leave
Now take me
Now brake me
Now take my heart and let me weap
Now take me
Now brake me
Now take my dreams but let me sleep

I can not bear this pain anymore
My heart is pinned down to the floor
Don't cry for me I'm almost gone
My destiny has been undone
I start to sing my last goodbyes
The tears fill the blood red sky
I'm always two steps away
From the last redemption day

I am always two steps away

Now take me
Now brake me
Now take my hand and make me see
Now take me
Now brake me
Now take my scars and let me leave
Now take me
Now brake me
Now take my heart and let me weap
Now take me
Now brake me
Now take my dreams but let me sleep
