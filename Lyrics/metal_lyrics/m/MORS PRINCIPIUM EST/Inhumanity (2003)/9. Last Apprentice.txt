[lyrics by Ville Viljanen]

Are you the one to guide me
lead me through this dark and misery
will I ever be awaken from this silent sleep

So take this pain away
and bless my destiny
can't you see i'm not your enemy
He places the hate inside
He keeps guiding you
you cannot live in solid harmony

When it's time for learning
it's allways time for yearning
you tried to end my path
so walk with me - now walk with me

lead me to the night

what was once - shall never be
what saw once - shall never see

so take this pain away
and bless my destiny
can't you see i'm not your enemy
He places the hate inside
He keeps guiding you
you cannot live in solid harmony

When it's time for learning
it's allways time for yearning
you tried to end my path
so walk with me - now die with me
