[lyrics by Ville Viljanen and Jori Haukio]

Dark father redreamer of sins
help me bleed till I die
Hide me from this rising daylight
And pless my nightly life
Touch the flames of this desire
And see the wind arise
The everlasting love has ended
As a shade of myself

Will you come to me
Will you cry for me
Will you bleed for me
Will you join to me
Just follow me
and forever be
Life in black

King reaper the giver of hope
Let me pass you one more time
I am the shadow in silence
I travel with the night
I used to have it all
Now I have nothing
I don't want their help
I need them anyway

Will you come to me
Will you cry for me
Will you bleed for me
Will you join to me
Just follow me
and forever be
Life in black
