[lyrics by Ville Viljanen]

I take a stone and put it away
I take the soil and put it aside
Then mixed them as one

I've seen the stars been born
I've tasted the cosmic universe
When the others sold their world
I did create another dimension
I had created another dimension

Forgotten worlds have been terminated
The whole meaning of mankind is gone

Let planets impale the space
Fly through the nortern sky
We need the moon
like flowers need the rain
eternal journey through the time
let us all fear the day
I am the truth, I am
I am creation

If our peace is broken by another race
we have to fight or stars to fade
in the wind is our last farewells
we hope this fight will never
come to its end

I've seen the stars been born
I've tasted the cosmic universe
When the others left their world
I did create a paradise
I did forget a thousand paradise

Forgotten worlds have been terminated
The whole meaning of mankind is gone

Let planets impale the space
Fly through the nortern sky
We need the moon
like flowers need the rain
eternal journey through the time
let us all fear the day
I am the truth, I am
I am creation
