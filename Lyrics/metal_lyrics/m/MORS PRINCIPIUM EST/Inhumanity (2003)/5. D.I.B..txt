[lyrics by Ville Viljanen]

Behind the gate lies another man
one more step and he would be free
he's face so cold and it's turning into stone
is this another dream

I dream of the lives
that hides in this valley of sacrifise
they are hidden somewhere beneath the
surface
and i can hear them breathing

Now turn away
don't look ever back
I can see the flames
I can feel my strength
and now the one have returned
from it's journey

Those creatures (are crying)
this silence (is fading)
to get out from this pain of mine
I have to be the one

Behind the stars lies another place
where this man has allready been
the halls so white, the walls so great
is this the place i dremt

If they call my name
I don't wan't to know
if they leave behind
will they turn away
I just want to see
all the stars above
in the sky
in the beautiful space

Now turn away
don't look ever back
I can see the flames
I can feel my strenght
and now the one have returned
from it's journey

Those creatures (are crying)
this silence (is fading)
to get out from this pain of mine
I have to be the one too
