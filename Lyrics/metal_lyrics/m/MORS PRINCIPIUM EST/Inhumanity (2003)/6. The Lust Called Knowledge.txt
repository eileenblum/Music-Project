[lyrics by Ville Viljanen]

The pleasures and the temptations
they hold our mind and flesh
"now release me"
the price of lust called sacrifise
the silence bow before me

In the sky the angels defeat
in the clouds the winds so grey
sun has lived a thousand lives
he made the winds so pale

The ancient one in the emptiness
we call his name awake
"open your eyes"
please set us free of this torment
where is the knowledge we have to find

In the sky the angels defeat
in the clouds the winds so grey
sun has lived a thousand lives
he made the winds so pale
see the light the flames of desire
and maek our heart go vain
let us climb the mountains of passion
and see the futures way
