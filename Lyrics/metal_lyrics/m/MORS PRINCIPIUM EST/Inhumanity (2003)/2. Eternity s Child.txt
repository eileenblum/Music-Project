[lyrics by Ville Viljanen]

You have led me into this grief
now it's your turn to get out of this lie
so many years i have been lost
in this circle of time

sometimes if feels like I'm trapped
in my own mind
I can feel my thoughts slipping away
am I going insane

I can see it there on the wall
the door that leads me out
who's head is this now
are these my own memories

Is it the feeligns that make us human
so what am i now
am i a man or just another
empty hollow shell

I feel no pain, I feel no sorrow
the time is right, the time is now
the world will cry, the world will turn
I am eternity's child

Once you swore to me that I have no soul
you liar
but somewhere deep inside me there is one
black as the night

many times you have placed my sins in
front of god
to judge me
but never been judged by you

I feel no pain, I feel no sorrow
the time is right, the time is now
the world will cry, the world will turn
