If wisdom fails me not
Aseer misled by omens
And wanting caution wise
She comes, true prophet with tread

Vengeance with hands that bear
The might of unity
She comes, my child
She comes, she comes too soon

She shall also come for us she comes
The sons of the night, we are, we are
She shall also come for us she comes
The sons of the night, we are

We are the night's desire
We bring the widow's deep
We are the deep desire
We are the sleep

We are the night's desire
We bring the widow's deep
We are the deep desire
We are the sleep

And through my scabs so new
Fearing but not of these dreams
That comes with the red of dawn
Will not forget for still

Wrought out in bronze of old
Which laid him low in death
Unless it gains its goal
This vision, vision of the night

She shall also come for us she comes
The sons of the night, we are, we are
She shall also come for us she comes
The sons of the night, we are

We are the night's desire
We bring the widow's deep
We are the deep desire
We are the sleep

We are the night's desire
We bring the widow's deep
We are the deep desire
We are the sleep

[Solo]

She shall also come for us she comes
The sons of the night, we are, we are
She shall also come for us she comes
The sons of the night, we are

We are the night's desire
We bring the widow's deep
We are the deep desire
We are the sleep

We are the night's desire
We bring the widow's deep
We are the deep desire
We are the sleep
