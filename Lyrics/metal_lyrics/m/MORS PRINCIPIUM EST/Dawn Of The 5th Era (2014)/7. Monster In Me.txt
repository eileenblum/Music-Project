By the burning of my candle in the night I lie awake
And try to drown my bitter thoughts, as my memories, I forsake
They warp their vines around my neck, my blinded eyes now see
The cold dead eyes of those I've killed staring back, staring back at me

As the ember of my candle fades into the light
My mind awakens in the dark and plagues the morning night
I feel my life forsake me for at my hand they fell
And now they've come to take me, and leave me in this hell
And now they've come to take me, and leave me in this hell

The dead are watching me, I can't forget
The horrors of what I've seen plagued with regret
Their bodies lying in the snow, the memory haunts me
But I can't, can't let them go, can't let them go

I burn in the torment of what I have done
And look at the monster that I have become
Haunted by voices, forever in me
I'm never alone, but never I'm free

I burn in the torment of what I have done
And look at the monster that I have become
Haunted by voices, forever in me
I'm never alone, but never I'm free

Their bodies lying in the snow, the memory haunts me
But I can't, can't let them go, can't let them go

I burn in the torment of what I have done
And look at the monster that I have become
Haunted by voices, forever in me
I'm never alone, but never I'm free

I burn in the torment of what I have done
And look at the monster that I have become
Haunted by voices, forever in me
I'm never alone, but never I'm free
