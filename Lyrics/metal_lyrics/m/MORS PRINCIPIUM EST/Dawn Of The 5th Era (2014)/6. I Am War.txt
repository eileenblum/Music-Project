Here I stand on this battlefield of horrors
I smile with ignorance in my eyes
I make you see a brother killing brother
As I raise my hand to salute

I gave them the guns
I set the night on fire
I am the only one
My name is war

I gave them the guns
I set the night on fire
You will know my name
My name is war

Marching blindly, following their leader
Feeling fear but die with a smile
Running, crawling, dying in this mud
No one will survive from this hell

Dead faces staring at me
Hear my laughter, they will bow to me
Remember, remember my name
As you walk through the flames
I am the last thing you will see

I gave them the guns
I set the night on fire
I am the only one
My name is war

I gave them the guns
I set the night on fire
You will know my name
My name is war

[Solo]

I gave them the guns
I set the night on fire
I am the only one
My name is war

I gave them the guns
I set the night on fire
You will know my name
My name is war
