As the story goes, I'm here, stuck in space
And never to see the earth again
I traveled to an atmosphere
With clouds and acid rain

If the storm arises, it will blind the stars
It could easily melt the flesh from bones
I'm so cold, cold and all alone
How could I forget you all

Am I ready to live in a dream
I just close my eyes and fall asleep

Born within the clouds of dust
And scattered throughout the galaxies
Perfect result of balance and force
Shall swallow all the visible light

Forged at the center of a massive storm
The temperature just keeps on rising
Hot core at the heart of the voyager
Will one day shine like a star

I will never forget who I was
I just close my eyes and fall asleep

(Born within the clouds of dust, we will one day shine like a star.)

[Solo]

Am I ready to live in a dream
I just close my eyes and fall asleep
I just close my eyes and fall asleep
