Oh Titan Gods, keepers of the earth
Is this the end? Must the world fall down to chaos
Losing our strength, beneath the beckoning tides
Of godlings vein, unmaking of our children's lives

Unveiling our disastrous trial to tie our will like reins upon the sun
Or stand as statues to the Mighty Heavens? Must we behold with the eyes of hopelessness?

Cronus stood mute, and the Gods answered all to him
With his brother in silence, motionless, they appeared
One by one, enduring of a fallen fane

Their universal warth, almighty as it seems
These our betrayers pledge our doom
Beneath the shards and ruins of the world
Were we not destined to burn?

Drag down the earth, ourselves and these our foes, our surrender to the Gods
Why should we stay and live in tragedy of a wretched power that claims us all?

Cronus stood mute, and the Gods answered all to him
With his brother in silence, motionless, they appeared
One by one, enduring of a fallen fane
Of a fallen fane
