A thousand scars cover my body
I have felt the chains of the slave
I have seen the anger of man
I have tasted the blade of the dead

A thousand screams haunt my soul
I have carried the burden of guilt
At the mist and darkness of night
We will learn just what to believe

I am the one, the unborn son
I am the one, the second son
You have the one, you call your son
But I'm the one, the other son

A thousand souls buried in the sea
My enemies drowned in vain
I have seen the anger of man
I won't sleep until they all are slain

A thousand scars cover my body
A thousand screams haunt my soul
At the mist and darkness of night
I have tasted the blade of the dead

I am the one, the unborn son
I am the one, the second son
You have the one, you call your son
But I'm the one, the other son

In my dreams, I am able to sleep
In my dreams, I can still be free
In my dreams, I can feel the wind when I fly
In my dreams, I'm still able to cry

[Solo]

In my kingdom (My kingdom), I shall live forever
In my kingdom (My kingdom), I shall feel no pain

(Oh God... Why did you choose this to happen? Am I just another lamb that needs to be sacrificed? I tried to live by your rules and by your laws, and this is, this is how you repay me?) This ain't living, no but this ain't dying, I just wish I could still feel something. I only have my dreams, and even in my dreams, there is darkness, oh, total darkness...)

If there is a way out, out from this torment
I hope you would show me the way
Don't leave me stranded, please don't leave me stranded
But guide me through

In my dreams, I am able to sleep
In my dreams, I can still be free
In my dreams, I can feel the wind when I fly
In my dreams, I'm still able to die

In my dreams...
