Alfred Packer went into the mountains
with his mining team

They were looking for gold in the mountains
to be rich and happy

They were lost while it snowed in the mountains
then met an Indian chief

The chief said there's death in the mountains
go back or death you'll meet

Alfred said there's gold in the mountains
convinced his mining team

They were starving walking in the mountains
with little food to eat

In a trapper's hut high in the mountains
their last meal they would eat

When the men fell asleep in the mountains
Alfred killed his mining team

Alfred searched the men in the mountains
and took all their money

Alfred sat and stared in the mountains
at his dead mining team

He cut up the men in the mountains
for some food to eat

Found a town walking back from the mountains
and went to take a peek

Left the meat in the snow in the mountains
then off to town was he

Went to jail for his deeds in the mountains
and was finally released
