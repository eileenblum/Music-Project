Found a peanut found a peanut found a peanut just now
I just now found a peanut, found a peanut just now

Cracked it open cracked it open cracked it open just now
I just now cracked it open, cracked it open just now

It was rotten it was rotten it was rotten just now
It just now was rotten, it was rotten just now

Ate it anyhow ate it anyhow ate it anyhow just now
I just now ate it anyhow, ate it anyhow just now

Got sick got sick got sick just now
I just now got sick, got sick just now

Then I died then I died then I died just now
I just now up and died, I died just now

Went to heaven went to heaven went to heaven just now
I just now went to heaven, went to heaven just now

Found the gates locked found the gates locked found the gates locked just now
I just now found the gates locked, found the gates locked just now

Went the other place went the other place went the other place just now
I just now went the other place, went the other place just now

Down there down there down there, just now
Just now down there, down there just now
