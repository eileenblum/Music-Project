A long time ago in Wisconsin
There was four in the family, whose name was the Geins
They were shunning the city with the birth of their two born
The Mother just hated all of the boozing whores

There'll be Gein wear that's made of embalmed ladies
A heart in a frying pan and lips on a string
Some scraps and fats and skeletons and sure as you're born
The ugliest of all was the oozing corpse

Now Mom's seen some sinning and it gave her pain
She said in fact, I'm going to make it change
She said hey Father know what, I'll tell you what to do
To Plainfield we're going to move

Ed gets some of the Gein wear that's made of embalmed ladies
A head in a burlap sack and lips on a string
Some scraps and fats and skeletons and sure as you're born
The ugliest of all was the oozing corpse

Then no one was there with Ed all alone
He was digging up graves in the dark, just as his brain started going
He bought books on cannibals and sex changes too
And he called out, as he read through

Hey Mom, I got your Gein wear that's made of embalmed ladies
A heart in a frying pan and lips on a string
Mother cried loath the whores in Ed's brain was soaring
And he just would make things from an old woman's corpse

When no one was out Ed was robbing graves
Taking home the bodies, playing silly games
Sticking and slashing when his brain was soar
All those willing gruesome whores

They'll be Gein wear that's made of embalmed ladies
A head in a burlap sack and lips on a string
Some scraps and fats and skeletons and sure as you're born
The ugliest of all was the oozing corpse

Corpse art sort of soothing, but drifting with the time
Two women looked much like his Mom so they died
The authorities came around and escorted him away
And that's why he'd never see another corpse to this very day

You'll see Gein wear that's made of embalmed ladies
A heart in a frying pan and lips on a string
Some scraps and fats and skeletons and sure as you're born
The ugliest of all was the oozing corpse
