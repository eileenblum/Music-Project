The little bell echoes
the great bell groans
this templed city of tombs
where death and grief blooms

fiendish desires in human form, leather clad
black is the veil, streaming in the wind
stiletto heels clicking up the cemetery gates

death among the dead, haunting mausoleums
all this death, oh, joyful sight
naked on a table of stone
juices dripping from the wet chaste
excitement of fear and death,
it's to me so dear

funeral bitch, the urge is so strong
funeral bitch, the night is so long

death life, life as dead and the sharpness of the shrieks
the licking tongues of fire, lustful and crushing

"I love, pale Beauty, how the shadows mass beneath the arches of your brow;
Black as they are, those eyes of yours inspire anything but funeral thoughtsâ"
[The first verse of the English translation of the 1857 poem "The Promise of a Face" by the French poet Charles Baudelaire from his book "Les Fleurs Du Mal."]

funeral bitch, the urge is so strong
funeral bitch, the night is so long, is so long

"For it is written: the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with her blood. And I saw her sent upon a hairy beast and she held forth a golden chalice full of the (filthiness) of fornications. And upon her forehead was written: 'Behold I am the great mother of harlots and all abominations of the Earth.'"
