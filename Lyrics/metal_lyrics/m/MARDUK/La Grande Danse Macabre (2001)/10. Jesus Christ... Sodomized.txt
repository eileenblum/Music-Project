Hang on your cross and pretend to suffer
before your flesh gets cold you'll be mistreated rougher
who are you fooling when you weep
die must any wolf who turns into a sheep

hold on to your cross, king of perversions and flies
in the whirlwind you'll face, no-one will hear your cries
anticipate a horrible death to the cross nailed
Mary's pathetic tries to shit forth a king failed

Jesus - son of rules halls up high
Jesus - it was you who scorched the sky
Jesus - hypocrite, you'll be the first to fry
Jesus - scorn defeat, shut up and die

Jesus Christ - sodomized
we take no bow for angel child
Jesus Christ - sodomized
all you love must be destroyed

Jesus - from the depths your death doom roar
Jesus - your glory days belongs to yore
Jesus - filthy scum behold abhor
Jesus - your mother was a stinking whore

Jesus Christ - sodomized
we take no bow for angel child
Jesus Christ - sodomized
drunk of your blood we go wild

eat his body, drink his blood and be a slave under the yoke of god
piss on Christ and kill the priest, follow nature - praise the beast

Jesus Christ - sodomized
we love to see you short of breath
Jesus Christ - sodomized
your throne we inherit on your death

bleed like a pig when with demons entangled
bashed, ripped and torned, mutilated and strangled
scream your lungs out is what you will do
when with fangs and claws the fallen rip you in two

Jesus Christ - sodomized
demons ripped you, your life blood ran
Jesus Christ - sodomized
one wound richer for each lie to man
