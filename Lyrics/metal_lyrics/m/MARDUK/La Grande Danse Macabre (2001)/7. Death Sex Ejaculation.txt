On silent wings through the darkness of aeons he comes
driven by bloodlust and craving for unholy passion
ecstatic for wicked slave abuse he enters your world

the beast in him is always awake and ready to strike at will
cast out from the heaves he commits sins which makes angels turn their heads
he is the commander of the 7th compartment of the underworld
and deep down in the core of your soul you know that you want him

could you ever picture death
to excite you 'til sanity's end and make you loose your breath?

groans of pleasure - demonacy
your orgasm - ecstasy

twisting, turning, crying, praying, screaming, dying, blood is spraying
death sex ejaculation !
death sex ejaculation !

as so many times before he stumbles through the garden of life
ascending from the firey pits with intention to kill again
for those who dares tasting this body all seal their fate in blood

sweat, blood and tears makes the spirit and flesh join as one
his name silence people in fear and tonight it's the one you adore to cry out
he penetrate you so deep that he'll never come out again
death is out riding the sky and tonight he comes for you

be all twisted fantasies
libido, perversions on demons killing spree

groans of pleasure - demonacy
your orgasm - ecstasy

twisting, turning, crying, praying, screaming, dying, blood is spraying
death sex ejaculation !
death sex ejaculation !
death sex ejaculation !
DEATH SEX EJACULATION !
