Could be that the the columns which halt here
That these endless rows of men
are scattered in the wind, split up and disperse
and will desert me, could be, could be

my lips may stammer mad words
but the flag will only fall when I fall
and be a shroud, covering my corpse

Obedience unto death - never to fall aside
forever to stride
on deaths wings they ride

We must be dominated by one will
we must form one unity
we must be held together by one discipline
and form one obedience

Forwards, forwards call the fanfares
for the last time the reveille has sounded
for battle sees us stand in stern array

obedience unto death....

I shall remain faithful, even though deserted by all
I shall carry the flag, staggering and alone

We march into eternity
for our banner is greater than death

behold the knight in solemn black manner
with a skull on his crest and blood on his banner

in black we are dressed
in blood we are drenched
with a death's heads on our collars
we stand unshaken

Obedience
