I am the dust of desert dunes and the chilly wind of death
I am the waves on the oceans of blood, and the knives and swords to shred
the just
I am the time, the withering and the withered, as well as the thorns,
burning and sharp
I am the rain of lust that wets the chaste, and the torch that ends your
life
I am the one whose name still the hearts and the silence their breaths
I am the one who speaks your name, weakens your fall into my cold arms
Just waiting for that kiss of my scythe

"Both fool and the wise,
one thing is certain - that life flies
one thing is certain and the rest is lies
the flower that once has blown forever dies"

I stand above you whispering low
you know not what into your ear
of my strange language you all know
as there is not a word of fear

Azrael
