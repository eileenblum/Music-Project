Drain the blood, fill the barrels to the verge
Vein must flood, bodycount is rising for the dirge
All the creatures that are breathing must be bled
Cure of the ancients, ultimately we are all dead

Bloodletting
Rip my vein open and let the blood rain
Bloodletting
Splash in a gusher my soul will be stained

We all must bleed

The ones among stardust the ones of the deepest pits
Apostles of Christ and those who so perfectly into hell fits
All behind heavens door and the ones to the ocean floor
Strong and beautiful or uttermost twisted
All will they bleed

Bloodletting
My bleeding inclination
Bloodletting
Your damnation

Drain the blood, fill the barrel to the verge
Vein must flood, bodycount is rising for the dirge
Wake up from this dream, the scythe you must kiss
And abandon the nightmare the flestful dream that life is

Bloodletting
Love the pain of the knife
Bloodletting
Death is bloodletting life

Till the final drop
