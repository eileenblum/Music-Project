It's not who I am, my name nor number
It's how I use it and what I do
Came to break the spell you're under
Remain to your instincts true

It's not a sin to take what you want
You only fall with self restrain
Loose the guilt that your world haunt
I take away your pain

Don't care what is being written
Piss on what is being preached
Like the snake mesmerize the kitten
Rip the priest head off - don' need that leech

Came to give you all you wanted
Hear my truth

Star that fell to shed a light
Over elder and youth

Never listened to no god's answers
Scars to proof

Desolate cast out and risen
Cloven hoof

Hear the church bell rings
As the angels sings
All they brings for the eternally jinxed
And kings is mere dead insects wings

Lost control of creation
Corruption, intimidation
God is just a bitter pig
Who carries pure black hate

Can you see the genius in uttermost ferociousness?
Ruthless you say I say charity judgment defeats you
God bless

Knifes oh Christ carves "love" in your flesh
Darkness of heaven a bottomless pit
Loose your soul and walk though life dead
God replaced it with a piece of shit

Cloven hoof
Grab on to the vision
Hate through attrition
The shit in your life that
Makes you wish you'd die
Crush the oppression
With ruthless
Aggression
Remember I'm
Right even
When I lie.
