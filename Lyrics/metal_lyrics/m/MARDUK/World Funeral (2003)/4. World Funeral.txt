May your joy pass horrifying lamentation
What is left of your lives endure eternal dread
Let the hungry be befalled by merciless starvation
Life expelled no compassion soon we are all dead

God spawned me to set the end free
After me nothing is meant to be
God spawned me to kill you all
I am world funeral

From the east to the west with plaugebearing steps I march
My sharp arrows of instant death I shoot in every beating heart
I will not spare you; I will not care how much you cry
I am the face of death; weep you humans now you die

Violent death is storming from all corners of the earth
I burn the ground poison the air, all seas and every well
I crush all kingdoms, I kill all men I, crush anything of worth
I unlock the dusty gates of hell

I points spears of pure black death at each and everyone
At all the unborn I laugh in spite, I killed you before your life began
I am the angel and the dragon bringer of Orion's curse
On wings of death without a heart I tore apart the universe
