Rush that fills my head when I
Hunt you down to kill you
Pain-that I will inflicts this is what I do and what I love
Hate-that I feel for you
And all that stand beside you
Suffering that you'll be put thought prepare
To die in pain
I will cut your throat
I will kick your face in
I am pain and death
Where I end hell begin

Violence-nothing exceeds my hostile excess
For brutality
Scratching-is what you hear as I sharpen my
Knife on the paving stone
Ghost-screaming your head they're
Chanting for your death
Insanity-is coming for you with every beat of my
Heart
Like a rain of coffinnails
And I am the hammer
I am misery to the bone
The pain I give it lasts forever
Night that I'll get you
Glow you to pieces
Our night of the long knifes

Night that I'll kill you
Stab you breathless
Our nights of the long knifes

Night I destroy you
Beyond recognition
Our night of the long knifes

Night of your death
I split your head open
Our night of the long knifes

Your time is out

You are all our enemies who are not in our ranks
Feel me beat your face to pieces
I am a fiend for cutting hearts out
At the edge of my knife or at the end of my gun
You'll all be equal in the dirt - equal to fucking shit
Falling in my wilderness of pain
Broken bones I am your last sigh
Look in my eyes - unscrupulous
Before a bloodsplattered terrain
