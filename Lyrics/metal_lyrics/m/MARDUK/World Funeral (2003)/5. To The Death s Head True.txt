Order of rites veiled in dusk
Above else in a mysterious husk
Our own legend will be told due
To that the fight-to the deathshead true

Core of our being to our commitment we brought
Kill and be killed without a second thought
Sacrificial death but our force will renew
Alive or not-to the deatshead true
