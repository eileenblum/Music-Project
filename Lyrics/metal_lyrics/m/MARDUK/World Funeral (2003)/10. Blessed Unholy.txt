Like a shadow of my pain
You're my scourge, my misery like a constant rain
The splinter in my brain, driving me insane
Searching for truths you say doesn't exist
Come inside your shelter of soulkilling mist
Before I do that I'd rather die, now feel my fist

You're new and improved - so we're told
But truth unfold, behold - to you we're cold
All who died for you - was it only for their sins
Better you than me - that am where my sanity begins
If you are the lamb, the gentle and the sane
Believe me when I say my views are inhumane

Here I am, unstoppable, the twisting thorn in your side
A welcome addition to the kingdom of Satan
My mind is sharp, like a razors edge, my souls gone mad
An outcast beyond your timid lying morality
Peace of mind, put to ease, still a hellhound of my leash
I am the shit of god
Born on sin - come right in, it must be tempting to be god
Take your original sin and shove it up your ass

I'm going to hell!

Obey natures laws and into hell fall
You must be choking from the shit in which you crawl
Burn to the stake, or have your neck break
Woe the ones who claim your love for man is fake
Pawns under your yoke, blood for heaven to soak
Your saga is but the ending of a worthless joke

I believe in death
I believe in disease
I believe in injustice
I believe in torture
I believe in anger
I believe in hate
I believe in murder
I believe in pain
I believe in cruelty
I believe in infidelity
I believe in slime
I believe in stink

I believe in you
