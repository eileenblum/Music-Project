A shackle of frailest copper,
A summer's hailstone too hard to conceal,
Perishableness advances,
Vanity of Vanities

Endless dreams of lifeless prayers,
Justice has closed mercy's door,
The skeleton rose to carry out his duty,
To make his arrows drink with blood.

Vanity of Vanities: All is Vanity

A shackle of frailest copper, vanity of vanities
Perishableness approaching, all is vanity.
Within sin dwellest death,
Within sin dwellest death.

A shackle of frailest copper,
A summer's hailstone too hard to conceal,
Perishableness advances, vanity of vanities.
A wingless mosquito, jumping around the light of inanition,
A turnhung meagre with compulsion, vanity of vanities.
Vanity of vanities: All is vanity
Vanity of vanities: All is vanity.

Thou fair one, behold these bones,
Thou learned one, see these empty skulls,
Thou wealthy one, consider this dust,
Thou thrall, see the rest,
Thou king see thy destiny,
Thou thrall see thee rest.
