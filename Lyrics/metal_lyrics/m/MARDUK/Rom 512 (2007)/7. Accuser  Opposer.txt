(ExorcÃ­zÃ³ te, immundÃ­ssime spÃ­ritus, omnis incÃºrsio adversÃ¡rii, omne phantÃ¡sma, omnis legio:
in nÃ³mine DÃ³mini nostri (Jesu Christi) eradicÃ¡re, et effugÃ¡re ab hoc plÃ¡smate Dei.
Ipse tibi Ã­mperat, qui te de supÃ©rnis coelÃ³rum in inferiÃ³ra terrae demÃ©rgi  praecÃ©pit.
Ipse tibi Ã­mperat, qui mari, ventis, et tempestÃ¡tibus imperÃ¡vit.)

Accuser, accuser,
Exhaustless fountain of poison divine,
I ate of Death to cleanse my flesh of God
To make me thy entrance to the veins of the world,

Now as we turn to seek thy face,
Pour down on us thy redeeming wrath,
For you will ascend into heaven,
And will exalt thy throne above God,
And you will sit also upon the Mount of the Congregation,
In the sides of North,

And you will ascend above the heights of the clouds,
And will be like the Most High,
Yet where you brought down to the sides of the pit,
Which we now must merge with the skies.

Opposer, opposer,
Core, marrow and essence of my Will,
I renounce this flesh in the name of thy praise,
To kindle the coals of Salvation's spring.
I drank of hell to cleanse my soul of God,
To reach the light in which thou dwellest,

Adversary, adversary,
Glorious slenderer and everything's adversary.
Whose blade alone split the tongues of the world,
Yet shall the highest of truths mark thy crown,
Now as we turn to seek thy face,
Pour down on us thy redeeming wrath.
