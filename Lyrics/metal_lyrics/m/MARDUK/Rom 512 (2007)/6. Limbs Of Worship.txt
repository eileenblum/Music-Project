Supplication, knees of glass,
Clothed in the fissures of the outskirts of life,
Soil and shadow, shadow soil
Left here to feed upon the punishments of God.

Nameless, I have no name,
The book of flesh is bleeding for I have no name,
The steadiness of unsteadiness,
My lounge is a pillar in the temple of Death,

Crucifixion, cross of holes,
And my hands arts a thousand winters,
Rust and spirit, angel swarm,
Shovelling sins to build the devil's bridge

Power, power,
I swallowed your psalms to gain their power.
A key-shaped sword and a sword-shaped key,
Mountains to water, oceans to stone.

Zealous limbs of worship,
And my song is a tempest of ash
Brave after brave, countless millennia
Hopeless manic-death addiction,

Fall after fall, countless millennia,
Fathomless, insoluble death saturation.
Broken eyes, funeral poison,
A just reward from this garden of fevers
Decide and I'll stay here never dry,
For the eight day is but a song to the Lord

Nameless, I have no name,
The book of Flesh is bleeding,
For I have no name,
The steadiness of unsteadiness,
My lounge is a pillar
In the temple of Death.
