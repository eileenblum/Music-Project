Speak through me, Speak through me,
The sin must be washed away with blood,
Dream through me, called to a new life through death

Called to a new life through death,
But what shall you reach for when all colours fall?
Overwhelmed with maledictions, feel the rays of redemption
Of a brand new sun.

Choking... Asphyxia, Inhale the Darkness,
Lungs filled up, Asphyxia, Asphyxia...
But who shall you reach for when all colours fall?
Long-drawn moans and piercing cries,
Blend with prayers and litanies, faces bone dry,
Condemned as the river everybody drank of
Inhale! Inhale!

Speak through me, the sin must be washed away with blood,
Dream through me, called to a new life through death,
Called to a new life through death,
But what shall you reach for when all colours fall?
