Within night infinity I slowly drift
Over the plains
Desolation...

I gaze, time does not exist gere
But endless, eternal, me

A sculpture of the night I am
Nump...yet I fly...to explore...what is built
Out of hate

A king of this world I am
Thronebearer of hate

With clear sight I see it
Even though it's dark
For me it is always

Sunlight cannot touch me
Neither it reaches my mind
Still I can reach it to consume

I am the face of wisdom
The punishment, damnation
The shadow I am, the wideopen eye
Growing mightier

A sculpture of the night
Brought to rule the neverending
I slowly drift...night...infinity

As the shadows grows
