The blood inside my veins is poisoned by funerals and dreams
The beauty of life crushed
Death is the life and destiny
The night so dark and everlasting
Where death and pain remains

Burn my coffin - release the soul
Burn my coffin - unveil the shadow

Black candles burn tonight
As my soul begins it's flight
As the veil of Darkness lowers it's shadow
I travel through the night

Burn my coffin...

The first rays of dawn came misbathed in red
As the rays of the sun to the soil were wed
In the early dawn I gazed for tomorrow
But my heart and souls was burned with sorrow
