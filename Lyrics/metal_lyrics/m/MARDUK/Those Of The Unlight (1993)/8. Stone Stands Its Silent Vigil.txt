Early morning, mist fills the air
Yet no sign of the sun
The landscape lies dark and lonely
Forgotten by time

A dark wind sweeps over the desolated land
Sunless days in the dark of winter
They have seen it all
Since the dawn of this age

Stone stands it silent vigil

In the lands of frost
All life is dead and lost
Frozen into a lifeless statue
Well preserved but quite dead
