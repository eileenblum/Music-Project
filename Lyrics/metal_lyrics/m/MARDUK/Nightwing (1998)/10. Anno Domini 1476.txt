But since Stefan failed his word and let Dracul's enemies come from every side
Dracu has no choice but with his two hundred men into death ride
During the last battle the turkish lines begin to scatter
And Vlad rode up on a hill to see the inferior blood splatter
But treasonous boyars ambushed the lion to his blood spill
Dracul fought bravely but the twentieth boyar would be his last kill
When the turks found his body they cutted off his head
Which was stuck on a pole in Konstantinopel to show the muslim world that Kaziklu Bey was dead
The night of the lord impalers demise the worst storm man could remember struck the land
Kaziklu Bey was dead but not gone and by thunder his foe's now again could feel his hand
