Wings of the night
Has turned light into shadows
And through the deep forest
Only the mist prevails
Carried forth by the whispering wind

And in a glade of the deepest part of the forest
The black pounding heart of a thousand peoples fears
Thirteen figures perform the most obscure dance
Around an altar of stone while the eye of Satan
Beholds from its high seat in the starless sky

Dark eyes stares with carnal bloodlust at the fettered virgins helpless struggle
Claws and teeth shall desecrate the temple of her soul and pierce the night with her cries

The sacred blood of god's creation flow
As the eyes of the creatures woefully glow
As gleaming red as the hair of the beasts

Dreadful shadows plunges through the veils of the mist at their screaming prey
Claws and teeth shall desecrate the temple of her soul and force her spirit beyond the gates
Of black divinity

The sacred blood of gods creation drips
And run down the throats of the creatures who from open vein sips
And the moon glows - as pale as the skin of the beasts

Three crosses breaks her skin
A soul for Satan to win

Three crosses for the price of blood
That so triumphantly brought death to the son of god

Three crosses for the breed of Cain
That throughout time in blood will reign

Three crosses for the abomination from Nod
Who so fiercly drank his brothers blood

Three crosses for the breathren of Judas

All praise the black deity
So fearsome great and mighty
Mark our spirits with thine blessing dark divine
And through our eyes you powers all will shine
Upon the forthcoming millenium

The sacred blood of gods creation is gone
And her soul is now in the hands of the horned one
Who laughs as bloodfreezing as gaze in the eyes of the beasts

Three crossess breaks her skin
A soul for Satan to win

Three crossess for the price of blood
That so triumphantly brought death to the son of god

Three crossess for the breed of cain
That throughout time in blood will reign

Three crossess for the abomination from Nod
Who so fiercly drank his brothers blood

Three crossess...
