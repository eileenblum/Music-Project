Nightwing - fly across the sky
And cast your shadow over those who before dawn will die
Beyond a great vast forest lies the desolate land
Ruled by men controlled by Satans hand
Craving for the ever blood dripping saints stone
And with dark rites in the nights blackest hour
Nightmares strife for the darksides blessing and the higher power

And the mantel of power should be shouldered by the firstborn
The one who crave evil and all kinds of human feelings scorn
He who drank his fathers blood and leaves his foes ripped and torn
And which the king halls up high since long forlorn

Have you ever wondered what's beyond the human sphere
To behold life through deaths dark veils from the demons lair
To stand above the eternal rest and every night rise up from your tomb
And behold life like the ones who with teeth was born from their mothers womb

For I am death and so you shall be
When on the nightwing you ride with me

The warlocks deciple, enchanter of ghouls
With exposed fangs from which the blood drouls

Nightwing - storm through eternity
And rip asunder those who fall for the human mockery
Within the massive castlewalls lurks the evil now again
Which with wise men made a truse by giving the blood of gods best men
He who possessess the gift which sends shivers down the spine
And awaken people who step away from the mortal worlds decline
He is the fierce creature which the angels fear to chase
Who see pain as passion and lives at war with the mortal race

His tomb is for any horse to cross like a mountain step
He has come to awake the devil from his sleep

The warlocks deciple, enchanter of ghouls
With exposed fangs from which the blood drouls

Pulled from our frail existence by the claws of death
To defy the scythe and feel the reapers breath
To walk the tunnel backwards when you first life has been slain
And when all mortal feelings has ceased to cause you pain
For I am darkness and so you shall be
As on the nightwing you ride with me
