It was predicted that with every tool
That the romans brought pain to you thy fool
People to your god should be lead
While our warriors lost and scattered fled
You should be the king on earth
Bastard son of virgin birth

Slay the Nazarene - In christian eyes supreme
You will die

Slay the Nazarene - Your might is just a dream
You shall die

Slay the Nazarene - Tourtured  you will scream
You must die

Slay the Nazarene  Slay the Nazarene
Die Die

On your command man should do what god wilth
Glorification of holy christian slime and filth
Your vision of your crusaders bravery
That turned the wiched out of their slavery
You should be the king of kings
But now feel the embrace of Lucifers wings

Slay the son of god - Drown him in his own blood
Meet your death

Slay the son of god - This is your sinners flood
We praise your death

Slay the son of god - Scum of inferior blood
Hail your death

Slay the son of god  Slay the son of god
Death Death Death

Now glance upon your teachings
In the pits of lost realities

Behold the righteous ones
Before Satan at their knees

Slay the scum of the earth -  Whoreson of infidel birth
You are dead

Slay the scum of the earth - Your cross is nothing worth
Your teachings are dead

Slay the scum of the earth - Teared apart with sadistic urge
Your god is dead

Slay the scum of the earth  Slay the scum of the earth
Dead Dead Dead

Humiliated as no other
Seek patience at the weak chest of your father
I.N.R.I.
Crucified you shall die
Mocked and spitted at
Your feeble rat

Slay the Nazarene - In christian eyes supreme
You will die

Slay the Nazarene - your might is just a dream
You shall die

Slay the Nazarene - tortured you will scream
You must die

Slay the Nazarene  Slay the Nazarene
Die Die Die

SLAY THE NAZARENE
