Bayonet winged infantry
Unrestrained dogs of war ablaze
Iron-clawed grenadiers embraces
...Another iron-clawed five

Projectiles of death pounding rage
Sturmvoiks and Stukas rule the sky
Blood and sunflowers - endless fields
The hammer bits the anvil

Skyline in flames
Blowtorch battalion's heavenly glow
Deathfire reigns
A thousand souls - cured with fire

Ravenous locust of steel
Rushing - godsend panzer plague
Artillery bliss and mortal grace
The hammer bits the anvil

Evil â Guitars
Devo â Bass
Mortuus â Vocals
Lars Broddesson â Drums
