Totalitarian command !

Wartheland - the soil bleeds black again
Expelled - Polish exodus
Replacement of blood stock begins

Wartheland
Thrusting the sickle through flesh
Through blood-drenched fields of mud
Wartheland
Oppression's hand reaches forth

Totalitarian command !
Plow and sword
Proclaiming repression with force
Blood and soil mixed as one
Ending expression once more

Wartheland
Commanding the fate of those
About to die in dirt
Wartheland
Conquerors crown to become
A funeral wreath

Seeds of blood
Succumb to the domination
Seeds of hate planted deep
Relentless Germanisation

Wartheland
Thrusting the sickle through flesh
Through blood-drenched fields of mud
Wartheland
Oppression's hand reaches forth

Totalitarian command !
