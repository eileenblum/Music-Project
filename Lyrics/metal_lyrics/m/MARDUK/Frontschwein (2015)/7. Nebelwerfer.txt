Let them rain on blood-soaked muddy fields
Let them sing their death-tone alarm
Let them fall upon the streets of no hope
Let them be the first fiddle in the macabre dance of death

Nebelwerfer - oh. smoke mortar
Brust forth ! let thy kingdom come
Nebelwerfer - artillery bliss
Break out ! let thy will be done

The spark and the flame
The flame and the spark
The shrill screams of Mimi
In the midst of the night
Death comes as flames from above

The smoke and the gas
The gas and the smoke
The high means of Minnie
In the midst of the night
The barrels thunder
The ground is shaking
Death comes as hail of the gods

Let them thunder on freshly blackened lands
Let them howl throughout this night of raptness
Let them fall upon the town square of pain
Let them be the first fiddle in this macabre dance of death

Nebelwerfer - oh. six barreled love song
Do-gerÃ¤t - hallowed be thy name !
Nebelwerfer - reveal thy glory
On earth as in heaven !

The spark and the flame
The flame and the spark
The shrill screams of Mimi
In the midst of the night - death comes as flames from above

The smoke and the gas
The gas and the smoke
The high means of Minnie
In the midst of the night
The barrels thunder
The ground is shaking
Death comes as hail of the gods
