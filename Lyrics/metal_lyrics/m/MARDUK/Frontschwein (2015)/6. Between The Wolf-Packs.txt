Concrete walls
A mountain of silence
Beast of prey's perspiration
The hangman's chorus echoes forth

Where suicide and silence whisper
Their sacrosanct promises
Keen smell of station and gray death
Millions of snowflakes between the wolf-packs

Grinding thunder in the east
Gott mit uns!
Tyrannic lightning in the west

Blood and ash
Severe reprisals ahead
The blood is shaken in the Reich
As thousand-fold vengeance take form

The floodgates of hate are open
And execution squads are let loose
Feral and bleak - high treason, deceit
Millions of snowflakes between the wolf-packs

The July sun is burning still
Upon the wolf's lair
Above us eaglets learn to kill
Above the sleigh tracks

Concrete walls,
A mountain of silence
Beast of prey's perspiration
The hangman's chorus echoes forth

Where suicide and silence whisper
Their sacrosanct promises
Keen smell of station and gray death
Millions of snowflakes between the wolf-packs

Alliance broken in the south
Gott mit uns!
Newfound slumber in the north

The July sun is burning still
Upon the wolf's lair
Above us eaglets learn to kill
Above the sleigh tracks
