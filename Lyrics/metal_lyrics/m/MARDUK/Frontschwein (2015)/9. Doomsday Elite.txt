Spearheaded scythe in the heart of Poland
Reaping the west, strict coulters of flame
Vast hecatombs of blood and life-force
Ferociously marching through the Balkans

All barrels pointing towards the east
Death's head and oak-leaves; doomsday elite

Toiling through despair and the frozen steppes
White tigers in Kharkov - black hunters ablaze
The eastern skyline again flaming red
Across Russian wastelands with hardened hearts

Blaze of destruction - Caucasian fields
Blood and sunflowers, desperate trail of Kursk

Disarmament march on broken axis ground
Kampfgroups move forward, Zhitomir in flames
Bleeding under cruel suns in Villers-Bocage
Maybach engines roar through the Ardennes

All barrels pointing towards the east
Death's head and oak-leaves; doomsday elite

Faith in weapons yet to come
Crises the skeleton key cant unlock
Faith in victories yet unseen
Spring awakening flares up, reality unfolds

Odyssey of the black praetorians
Asphalt soldiers stuck in obstinate mud
Death's head ussar's eternal march
False honor prospers betrayal stands tall

Aimfully oiling the engine of war
Sowing a wind - harvesting a storm

Faith in weapons yet to come
Crises the skeleton key cant unlock
Faith in victories yet unseen
Spring awakening flares up, reality unfolds
