War

Sounds of violence breaks the silence
Ripping the stillness apart
Sounds of thunder n force from the world under
The essence and joy of my heart

The messengers who chime death's bell
The panzers have come to blow god into hell

Die

Like Lillith's sons - the demonic ones
Storming through dust clouds to kill
All they seek - to kill the weak
The extent of bloodshed to the thrill

The black roaring panzers who bring pain and death
And through their barrels you will feel hells breath

Eyeballs rolling, bodies twisting, mouths are screaming as they burn
Shells exploding, steel is crushing, dooms bell tolling, death you yearn

All I want, All I need
Is to see my enemies bleed

Guns of annihilation, hell's celebration
Execution of god can begin
Set the world on fire so Christ can expire
This time the devil will win

Smell the scent of fear and pain
As we roll through the pile of ash
Antichrist is here to reign as we blow god's throne
With a crash

All I want, all I need
Is to kill the ones light saved

I spit in the face of god with my gun
Ablazing the ghost and run over his son
