On untrodden paths in the Carpathians
Echoes from the past hovers like the veils of mist
Many of the sounds, of its nature
Warn you of violent and sudden death

In the uncanny nightwind
You'll hear the owls warning
Of what is yet to come
So big and so black
All around

And with the darkness came death
New throats were to be satisfied
Ant the stench of death made us hungry

From the shadows we emerge
We who never were the lambs of light
But those of the unlight

Black silhouettes prowl through the darkness
Protected by the wings of the night
When the moon shines brightly
The howling returns over untrodden paths

On untrodden paths in the Carpathians
Echoes from the past hovers like the veils of mist
And with the darkness
So big
So black
