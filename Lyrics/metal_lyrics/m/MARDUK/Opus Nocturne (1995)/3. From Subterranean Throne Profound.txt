A look on the crucified one
Gives us strength in soul and mind
This moment breeds hate undivine
So look, oh sinner, and be satisfied
Only for our guilt he sacrificed his weak life

Sure as the night will come
He hanged on the cursed tree
He who sacrificed his holy life
He who was sent to bear our guilt
For god the almighty

No agony, no tears, only the blood
Can bring reconsolidation
Therefore our blood floats in swift streams
From veins open wide
We mock and crush with delight
All what your holy trinity represents

Once fallen from halls up high
But now descending from the depths of the earth
From subterranean throne profound
My fathers kingdom

The light can's save me
For too long the intensity of darkness burned
By burial this night my journey has begun
Tonight I'll reach my fathers kingdom
