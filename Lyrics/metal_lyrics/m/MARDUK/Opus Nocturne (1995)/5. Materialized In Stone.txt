The solemn tones of an ancient clock
Have announced midnight
The air is thick and heavy
A vast deathlike stillness pervades all nature

A faint pearl of thunder comes from far off
Drifting clouds obscures the moon
As I passed onto the path in darkness
The wind must have grown colder for I felt myself shiver
As I walked towards

Unaware of the light
I struggled through the night

A materialization of my fear - the light
Through stealthy shadows
Through darkened halls
As the first rays of the sun emerges from
The horizon

Unaware of the light
I struggled through the night

Materialized in stone
Embraced by the woods as my throne

Materialized in stone
Forever stand alone
