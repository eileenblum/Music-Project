On a cold mist october morning
In the year of the lord 1462
The horses appeared on the hills of Brasov
The process of damnation would soon begun

Dracul would show the world how to correct
The rumanians which lacked strength or showed disrespect
The following story is just one of many on Draculs way
To outwipe every opposer who didn't him blindly obey

He killed by crushing them under the wheels of barrows
Others were undressed and skinned alive
To their very bowels and others were still impaled upon wooden poles
Or fried over the glowing embers placed under them

The cold wind of death follow in his way
Deme quaden thyrane

Some of them were run through with stakes that impaled their heads, breasts
and behind
Until the pole was driven through the mouth
To ellude the lack of any cruelty he drew stakes through
The breasts of mothers and then he went on by impaling
Their infants upon these

The cold wind of death follows in his way
Deme quaden thyrane

So many have to die
By the horrible ways of torturing them
With such instruments that can only be invented
By the most nefarious cruelty possessed
Uttermost dreadful tyrant that ever existed

But the hungarian king Mathias Corvinus now Dracul betrayed
And for twelve long years Vlad now in the kings prison stayed
But the bonds of blood that Dracul in prison tied
Made his king in Wallachia again with Mathias as an allied
With lord Stefan Bathori's army and military skill
Dracul now will make all saches, boyars, Danesti's and turks blood chill
