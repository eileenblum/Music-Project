It's cold in my veins
The sun has failed ascending from the crypts
Driven by hunger so strong
I am one with the night

Silence...

Only broken by the whispering of the wind
In the moonlit forest
My tooths - I want them to slide like razors
In the flesh and into the veins
I want to let the blood float
Easy in my mouth and hot in my throat

It's cold in my veins
The sun has failed
Darkness eats through the hearts and souls
Of lovers of god, his son and the holy ghost

The sun has failed
Darkness spread its wings

Light drowns
