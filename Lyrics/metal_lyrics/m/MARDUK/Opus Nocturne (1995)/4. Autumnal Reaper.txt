The coldest winds embrace the lands
Awakend from its ancient slumber
By a circle of sleepless eyes

Autumn reaper, dress me in ice
Let my blood freeze in your eyes

Towards a dark sky, monolith points
Created by unknown hands in a darker age
The threes bow for this wind, the cursed
That will live on forever

The winds of autumn cold and loud
Dressed in ice it dies, the life
Standing as frozen shadows
Under flickering stars

Autumn reaper dress me in ice
Let my blood freeze in your eyes
