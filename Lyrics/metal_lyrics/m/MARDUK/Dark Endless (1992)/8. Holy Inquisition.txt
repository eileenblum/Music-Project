You all confessed your sins - Die

Your hearts are imprisoned by sin
If you don't want to se your sin
It must be shown to you
Trial by water

Your hearts are black with sin
It's our task to free them
Death for death, death for mercy
In this place death is mearcy

Confessions under torture
Burning at the stake
In the name
Of Jesus fucking Christ

You shall rest by the dead
But you will still be alive
