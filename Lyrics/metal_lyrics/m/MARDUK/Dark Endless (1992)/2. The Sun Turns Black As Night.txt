On my knees I prey for the darkest day
And you will be the one to go my way
Earth is filled with sorrow that will soon be unleashed
Powers of the Dark see their reign increase
Bring my body and soul
Imto the Dark

Sorrow I salute you
Pain my greatest joy
Death to those who fail me
Death I shall employ
Blood for the king
Murder we sing

Bring us from the light
To the temple of burning night
