An angel in ecstasy crosses the sky
The sky shines brighter than bright
From the ground in the shadow we watch it fly
Summoning darkness and might

An angel so terrified falls from the sky
The sky turns blacker than black
I hear an angel in vain screaming "why"?
As the rain welcomes us back

Now when the angel fell from the sky
Our eyes with blackness will burn
We reach our hands to the clouds up high
And whisper - "This is our return"

Sunlight has failed
Dark is the sky
The feeble sun no longer shine

When the night is over still black in the sky
Before our eyes the fading sun bleed
Fire is now roaring over sky

The arrival

Now when the angel fell from the sky
Our eyes with blackness will burn
We reach our hands to the clouds up high
And whisper - "this is our return"

We mock the light and towards the shadows
We are drawn into the darkness
We silently died
