The lies of Christ will lose 
the ways of Hell I chose 
I drink the floating blood 
defy the fury of God 

I have turned my back on Christ 
to Hell I have sacrificed 
I have made love to the Pagan Queen 
the gates of Hell I have seen 

I heard the angels cry 
I watched the witches fly 
I saw the clouds of death 
Slowly blackening the sky 

I read the book of spell 
I chimed death's ancient bell 
and when I die I have a place 
reserved in Hell 

In Conspiracy With Satan 

I ride the bloodstained goat 
I let the brewage float 
I have seen the reaper's face 
and walked through eternal haze 

I have kissed my master's hand 
I have seen the children of the damned 
I heard the demons call 
and seen a thousand virgins fall 

I heard the angels cry 
I watched the witches fly 
I saw the clouds of death 
Slowly blackening the sky 

I read the book of spell 
I chimed death's ancient bell 
and when I die I have a place 
reserved in Hell 

In Conspiracy With Satan
