The world you see around you
Is just an illusion
Created by your mind
To keep you from going insane

Still Dead, Still Fucking Dead

You ware both with the love of god
And you will die with Satan's hate

Meet the chaos on the other side
The past is haunting you
Death is just the beginning

Here's no peace
