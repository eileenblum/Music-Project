[2:23]

Praetorians reborn, relentless spiral of death.
Armored spearhead, time of trial, circle of fire.
Rostow, Charkow, Kursk, Carnapol.
Encirclement and outbreak, bloodsoaked soil.

Moments of glory and pride.
Panzer Deathride.
Death and Hell on every side.
Death and Hell on every side.

Iron youth under steel command, working toward piece by piece.
Camouflage gear rips, streams of blood drip.
Machinegun fire spraying lethal dose. Crawl across the killing field.
Black cross, red star. Iron times, last laurels.

Black sun shine us forth. God's soldiers, without God.
No respite, the blackguard dies. Loyal to the bitter end.
High tide in the East, red deluge.
On darkened wings Death descend.

Moments of glory and pride.
Panzer Deathride.
Hell and death in every hide.
Hell and death in every hide.

Steel Inferno.
Panzer Deathride.
