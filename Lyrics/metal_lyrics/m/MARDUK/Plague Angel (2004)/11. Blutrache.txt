[7:50]

The great cathedral of Man arise
through doors flung wide.
Every nation marches singing
towards defeat and death.

Judgement Day edges toward evening.
Panzer thunder, panzer death.
Black twelve-armed holy Sun.
Rise, rise, holy Sun.

Judgement Day edges toward evening.
Every nation marches singing,
every nation towards death.
Let us rejoice in the light
of this man-made Armageddon
this man-made Hell.
Hand in hand with angels of iron,
angels of wrath.
Panzer thunder, panzer death.
Black twelve-armed holy Sun.
Rise, rise, holy black Sun.

The great cathedral of Man arise
through doors flung wide.
Every nation marches singing
towards defeat and death.

Judgement Day edges toward evening.
Panzer thunder, panzer death.
Black twelve-armed holy Sun.
Rise, rise, holy black Sun.

Judgement Day edges toward evening.
Every nation marches singing,
every nation towards death.
Let us rejoice in the light
of this man-made Armageddon
this man-made blazing Hell.
Hand in hand with angels of iron,
angels of wrath.
Panzer thunder, panzer death.
Black twelve-armed holy Sun.
Rise, rise, holy black Sun.

Every nation marches singing,
every nation towards death.
Let us rejoice in the light of
this glaring mass cremation,
this shining mass-death-light.
Hand in hand with angels of iron,
angels of wrath.
Panzer chaos, panzer Hell.
Black twelve-armed holy Sun.
Rise, rise, holy Sun.

Every nation marches singing.
Even our children shall fight to the end.
Let us rejoice in the light
of this man-made Armageddon
this man-made blazing Hell.
Hand in hand with angels of iron,
angels of wrath.
Panzer thunder, panzer death.
Black twelve-armed holy Sun.
Rise, rise, holy black Sun.
Every nation marches singing,
every nation towards death.
Let us rejoice in the light of
this solemn dance of death.
