[3:05]

In the gothic splendour of
the chapel of Saint Wenceslaus.
Golden door with seven locks,
seven keys within your hand.
Ancient crown of Bohemia
placed upon your head.
Sharpening your spears.
The hangman's disciples, vomiting forth death
Murderous power, rabiate hate,
harbinger of suffering.
The malignance of malevolence
rises beyond benevolence

Smite your foes that they may die,
splattering blood across the sky.
Architect of genocide
in death taking pride.
The shape of things to come.
The shape of things to come.
The shape of things to come.
The shape of things to come.

Thousand-eyed Angel of Death
armed with flaming sword.
Spread your wings, let the killing begin.
The hunter becomes the hunted.
Hangmen also die.
Morningred, morningred
shines us to soon be dead.
Retaliating from beyond.
Killing, bloodspilling,
Wade through carnage.
Seas of blood, seas of blood.
Morningred, seas of blood.

In the gothic splendour of
the chapel of Saint Menceslaus.
Golden door with seven locks,
seven keys within your hand.

Smite your foes that they may die,
splattering blood across the sky.
Architect of genocide
in death taking pride.
The shape of things to come.
The shape of things to come.
The shape of things to come.
The shape of things to come.

Hangmen also die.
Morningred, morningred
shines us to soon be dead.
Retaliating from beyond.
Killing, bloodspilling,
Wade through carnage.
Seas of blood, seas of blood.
Seas of blood, seas of blood.
