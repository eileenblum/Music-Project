[2:43]

Plague upon plague, black boil redemption.
On this sea of rats I shall set my throne.
Halo of fleas, blood puke salvation.
Only fire is now clean enough to touch your soul.

Throne of Rats.
Sword of Disease.
Throne of Rats.

See how the body contracts
until your limbs become ropes of madness.
Ropes of regret, the price of purity.
Ropes of regret.

Throne of Rats.
Sword of Disease.
Throne of Rats.

Older than Time am I, and yes, I am forevermore.
Constantly reshaping, reforming to suit your sins.

Death upon death, black death redemption.
On this sea of death I shall claim my crown.
Halo of death, death puke salvation.
Only death is now pure enough to forgive your sins.

Throne of Death.
Justice is done.
Throne of Rats.
