[3:33]

Jeanne d'Arc, Jeanne d'Arc,
your mothers are many, everything bleeds.
Nor have they heard the Netherworld move its lips.
You haven't heard a word, you haven't heard a word.
It's the emptiness, everything is from within.
Afraid to die you are.
Don't receive the sword, don't receive the sword.
Everything bleeds, the branches bleed
between your cold mouths.
They will throw your ashes over the Seine.
Ashes over the Seine.
Like a funeral veil.
Ashes over the Seine.

Jeanne d'Arc, Jeanne d'Arc,
don't believe your visions.
Everything you given a name is already lost.
Don't receive the white armour.
There is nothing to defend.
Don't bow down for the kings.
All the blood, all the blood.
Yes, you will be betrayed.
So much blood. The stones are cold.

You hear no voices, you hear no voices.
They will bathe up your sword to bloody bronze,
and hang as an oath in the catacombs.
You haven't heard a word, you haven't heard a word.
It's the emptiness, everything is from within.
Afraid to die you are.
Don't believe, don't believe.
The saints are dead people, no pointed crowns.
They will throw your ashes over the Seine.
Like a funeral veil.
Like a funeral veil.

Everything bleeds, everything bleeds.
Untie your dress, everything bleeds.
And open up your protected room
with two fingers. Everything bleeds.

Everything bleeds, everything bleeds.
Untie your dress, everything bleeds.
And open up your protected room
with two fingers. Everything bleeds.
