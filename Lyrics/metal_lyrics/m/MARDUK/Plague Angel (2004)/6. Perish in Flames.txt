[7:46]

Closer, come closer till everything burns.
Each foetus a torch. The missionaries' lips in raging flames.
Death and our semen, at last shall we burn.
Ash and coal.
Come closer, come closer.
Ash and coal.

The guilty and the innocent the same.
Light razorblades restless dance
over navel-strings and forgotten sins.
Ash and coal.

Holy or crown of lust, the city must burn.
The bread and the flesh must follow its vow.
The abdomen, tongues and aborted the same.
Every image of both living and dead
shall perish in flames.
Perish in flames.
Perish in flames.
Perish.

Closer, come closer till nothing breathes.
Come closer, and come without warning.
The prophet's throat, ash and coal.
Blind, but with a thousand seeking arms.
Ash and coal.
Can you outrun the mouths of Hell?

Holy or crown of lust, the city must burn.
The bread and the flesh must follow its vow.
The abdomen, tongues and aborted the same.
Every image of both living and dead.
Holy or throne of filth, all nations must burn.
The king and the whore together at last.
The abdomen, tongues and seeker the same.
Every fragment of both tomb and tree
shall perish in flames.

Perish in flames.
[Repeat and fade.]
