[2:27]

Empire of blood arise.
Vengeance be our holy blood.
Our holy grail. Kill all the frail.
Be our holy blood, our holy grail.

Vengeance is mine, says the Lord.
And I believe him. I believe him

Not a single straw shall nourish the enemy.
No man shall give them enlightment.
No hand bid them aid. Every path will he find destroyed,
every road barred. Nothing but death, annihilation
and hatred shall greet him.
Hatred shall greet him.

Vengeance is mine, says the Lord.
Yes, believe him.

Not a single straw shall nourish the enemy.
No man shall give them enlightment.
