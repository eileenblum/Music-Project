"How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!
How art thou cut to the ground, which didst weaken the nations"
[Isa 14:12]

O fallen Knowledge, I turn unto Thee
Like the first of men Knew his second spouse
A gift that godhood attainable may be
This Knowledge transforms me to Melek Taus
A gift that godhood attainable may be
This Knowledge transforms me to Melek Taus

Phosphorus redeemer... Naught in extension in Thaumiel
Lucifer, lord of all husks in the deepest pit of Hell
Phosphorus redeemer... O Morning Light
Truth of Truths and God of Gods
Destroyer of the "wrong and right"
Destroyer of the "wrong and right"

O fallen knowledge
from white into black the Diamond turns
Extension of the Great Dragon
in cosmic shape so that man may learn
the Fallen Knowledge
that is the key to the All and the Naught
In the Qliphoth
To use the self-redeeming powers Thou brought

O fallen Knowledge, in Death supreme
Thy Light on me in the Qliphoth cast
Illuminate each suppressed dream
Perversions of a forgotten past
Phosphorus redeemer... O Morning Light
Destroyer of the "wrong and right"

"How art Thou risen above heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!
How hast Thou built Thy abode, which casteth Light upon the strong!"
