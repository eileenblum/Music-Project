Layers of grey violence above
See carnal truths contract and lastly fall
Come Lord! Spill forth thy sinless Guilt
And for man -- a crown forged from a harlots pride

Whorecrown -- sceptre of the highest shame -- Whorecrown
Whorecrown -- throne engrafted in decay -- Whorecrown

Caustic psalms rushing through the vault of wills
Zealously mocking the toad of time
Gasping for air and the strength of the Depths
To with one final breath -- curse the flesh

Whorecrown -- robes of jeweled harlotry -- Whorecrown
Whorecrown -- orb of Hell's symmetry -- Whorecrown

Circles of pale violence below
See the law of the flesh sunder and reduce to dust
Come Lord! Spill forth thy sweet Wrath
And for man -- a crown forged from the brightest curse

Whorecrown -- scepter of the highest shame -- Whorecrown
Whorecrown -- throne engrafted in decay -- Whorecrown
