Luminous - tireless destruction
Forming and reforming as false Heavens' glow
Tongues of flame drawing Madness Divine

Ever present, the absence of breath
Within - without - above - around
Ever searching spear of eyes
Beneath - below - between - behind
Come LORD spill thy wrath! Come LORD spill thy wrath!

In me it springs again
This hissing flame of old
In here it weathers time
This torch with which we shall light the sky

In me it springs again
This Chaos Equilibrium
I drank the guilt of the Ancients
To become DEVOTION
...To die the death of a Messiah

Loops and coils - spiral pulse
Restively abiding its fulfillment in Death
Perfect circles - Death-Aureole
Disrobe now thy sin as the Hole of Holes expands

Underneath - beside - beyond - entwined
Ever seeking maul of Sight
Nowhere - no-one - nothing - DEATH!
Come LORD grant us Death! Come LORD grant us Death!
