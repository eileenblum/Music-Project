And so they gave in...
To the law of the flesh and pungent lust
And so shall the Curse cover them
As a garment -- as a garment

No hidden manna
No tree of life
No grandiose pillar in the temple of your god

And forever shall you wear this shame
As a garment -- as a garment
And as a garment shall you be flung
Into Judgement -- into Judgement

No hidden manna
No tree of life
No grandiose pillar in the temple of your god

And as a garment shall you wear these flames
This fire of Woe and Banishment
Endlessly shall it form and reform
Around your limbs -- around your sinful limbs

And forever shall you wear this shame
As a garment -- as a garment
And as a garment shall you be thrown
Into Judgement -- into Judgement

Marduk's Wormwood was recorded at the Endarker Studio in the Year of the Lord 2009
