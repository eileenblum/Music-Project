Ever faithful -- to unfaithfulness
Endlessly truthful -- to untruthfulness
Strict have I sharpened my tongues -- in the cunt of deceit
Thus my Ascension bound -- to boundlessness

Vomiting vacuum
As the clocks of the living flesh backwards turn
Spewing holes -- exhale!
Until the fires of creation backwards burn

Enter now -- the joyous light
That shall lead you into darkness
Into Utter Madness -- and into "out of reach"
...And your name shall be "Without"

Ever loyal -- to disloyalty
Till Death united -- against all unity
Now see the demons flourish -- like the grass of the earth
These devouring words -- these devouring worlds

Vomiting vacuum
As the clocks of the living flesh backwards turn
Spewing holes -- exhale!
Until the fires of creation backwards burn
