Swaying swords around your throne
Usurper -- king without crown
Iron intolerance -- Herald of Irreconcilability

Ruthless Golden Peacock

Swaying your blood over the holy chairs
Over the Black Madonna
Swaying your blood over the holy chairs
Over the thirteen stairs

...On this chorus of cracking necks
...On this chorus of cracking necks

Thirteen stairs
Still fresh in your death
Iron sharpens iron
As fire sharpens flesh -- as fire sharpens mind

Feel the heel of the conqueror -- descend into nightmare
Vitriolic projectiles from a demon's bow

Ruthless Golden Peacock

Swaying your blood over the holy chairs
Over the Black Madonna
Swaying your blood over the holy chairs
Over the thirteen stairs

...On this chorus of cracking necks
...On this chorus of cracking necks
