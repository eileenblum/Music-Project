Gold moon - Sun of silver
See the fallen string their bows
Another dart from reason's quiver
Again the eyes of madness glow

Curse on curse - Voice of fire
See the width of Hell expand
Knotted whips of flaming wire
Dancing upon the back of man

Doomsday embers
Damnation's spread
The Dark embodies
Death stands prepared

Ascend - Awake - Arise
O Ye Flames of Perdition
Havoc - Ravage - Demise
Damnation's Gold

Judgement materialized
The flames converge
Behold Desecration
take form and emerge

Ascend - Awake - Arise
O Ye Flames of Perdition
Havoc - Ravage - Demise
Damnation's Gold

Shoreless seas of hallowed quicksand
No redemption - No way up
Accept the imperious yoke of Satan
And drink now from Damnation's cup

Gold moon - Sun of silver
See the fallen string their bows
Another dart from reason's quiver
Again the eyes of madness glow

Curse on curse - Voice of fire
See the width of Hell expand
Knotted whips of flaming wire
Dancing upon the back of man

Doomsday embers
Damnation's spread
The Dark embodies
Death stands prepared

Ascend - Awake - Arise
O Ye Flames of Perdition
Havoc - Ravage - Demise
Damnation's Gold

Ascend - Awake - Arise
O Ye Flames of Perdition
Havoc - Ravage - Demise
Damnation's Gold
