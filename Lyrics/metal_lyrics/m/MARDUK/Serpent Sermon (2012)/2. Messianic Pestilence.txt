And I listened and I heard...
the colour of blood
And I beheld and I saw...
the voice of the Lord
Sweeping over the masses
Removing the cover from the fierce mouths of a new plague

Swiftly turning our cities into still graves
Messianic Pestilence

And I sniffed and I smelled...
the drumbeats of Hell
Like a thousand commingling thunders
Violently shaking the foundation of the earth

The old land of life has failed
Newer rites of Death prevail

Swiftly turning our cities into still graves
Messianic Pestilence

Messianic Pestilence
Messianic Pestilence
Christlike plague
of HOLY DEATH
Messianic Pestilence

And I spoke and I called...
for the grandeurs of War
To rage upon mankind
To again roar among the congregations of the earth

The old land of life has failed
Newer rites of Death prevail
