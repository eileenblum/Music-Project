Lifeless rebirth - Devoured and made anew
Fleshless dominion and the blackness of burnt blood
And as a tempest of rust and moths
shall my voice boom forth
Proclaiming the gospel of A New Dawn
...and the coming of the Lord

The coming of the Lord
The birth of The Darkness
The coming of the Lord
...and a World of Blades

The Great Darkness descends now even faster
The throat of hope and mercy lies strangled
And upon fixed poles of Guilt and Death
shall my anthems thunder
Revealing the splendour of The New Law
...and the coming of the Lord

The coming of the Lord
The birth of The Darkness
The coming of the Lord
...and a World of Blades

And the light of the new dawn shall come as flames of destruction
The hope of man shall melt like wax before the flame
And the earth shall open and re-open and shall hunger for flesh
Thirsty blades shall glitter at every gate
Sharpened - blessed - and polished for slaughter

And the might of the new law shall be as vast cataclysms
Violently tearing time and space to shreds
And the blood of the lamb shall blacken and become as tar
Death shall stand like a mountain of power
And you and your fellow beings shall give thanks!

Lifeless rebirth - Devoured and made anew
Fleshless dominion and the blackness of burnt blood
And as a tempest of rust and moths
shall my voice boom forth
Proclaiming the gospel of A New Dawn
...and the coming of the Lord

The coming of the Lord
The birth of The Darkness
The coming of the Lord
...and a World of Blades
