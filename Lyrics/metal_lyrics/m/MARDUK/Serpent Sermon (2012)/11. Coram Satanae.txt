[Bonus Track]Shifting from strength to strength
Devouring Darkness
Piercing Light

Striking high and low
Into the foundation of life

Risen from high to higher
The stars of God and above
Yet shall the ash cloud reach
to Earth and to the Lowest Low

Fixed - Yet bound to ascend
Rising as lions among men
Coram Satanae - Coram Satanae
Fixed - Yet bound to ascension

Shifting from strength to strength
Devouring Darkness
Piercing Light

Striking high and low
Into the foundation of life

Risen from high to higher
The stars of God and above
Yet shall the ash cloud reach
to Earth and to the Lowest Low

Fixed - Yet bound to ascend
Rising as lions among men
Coram Satanae - Coram Satanae
Fixed - Yet bound to ascension
