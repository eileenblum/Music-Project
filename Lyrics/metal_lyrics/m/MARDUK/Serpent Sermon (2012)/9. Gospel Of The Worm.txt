Through used up life-force and used up skin
Through strings of failure and stiff limbs of shame

Crapulous orgies - consuming sin
In ceaseless hunger
Hellish black thirst

Livid with the hue of mould and death
Crowned with swarming angels of rot
Mere food for maggots
Mere fuel for the flames
Saying grace at the table of decay

And as your soul in darkness burn
...of the emptiness you learn
And as your flesh to soil turn
...embrace the gospel of the worm

Warmth and life are now strangers in here
The void is present
Ancient yet forever new

Dead - you are dead!
Depleted - you are dead!
Bow before the skillful smith of decay
No hope - only death!
No salvation - only death!
Clusters of heavy sins hold you down

And as your soul in darkness burn
...of the emptiness you learn
And as your flesh to soil turn
...embrace the gospel of the worm
