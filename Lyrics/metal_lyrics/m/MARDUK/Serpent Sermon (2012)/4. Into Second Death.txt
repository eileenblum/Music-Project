Of swift-winged Damnation and of Divine Anger
Waves of sulphurous Justice rushing forth
Unrivaled Flames arise from the unrivaled hunger
...of the consuming sinkhole of the Gods
And this is the Fire - that shall cleanse your soul

And as a cloud of dying flesh shall it materialize
That voice long heard at the altar of Rusty Death
Floating on the quickly fading memory of life
The pitch-black splendour of the Devil's breath
And this is the Darkness - that shall cause you to...

Fall - Into the quenchless fire
Fall - Into the depths
Fall - With the rest of your sinful empire
Fall - Into second Death

And the chants of the damned shall be
sharpened and be turned into spears
Blades of burnished curse gleam in the dark
Wounds shall be made and be kept open for years
And the blood thereof shall become our sweetest psalms
And this is the Poison - that shall wash you clean

And as a cloud of dying flesh shall it materialize
That voice long heard at the altar of Rusty Death
Floating on the quickly fading memory of life
The pitch-black splendour of the Devil's breath
And this is the Darkness - that shall cause you to...

Fall - Into the quenchless fire
Fall - Into the depths
Fall - With the rest of your sinful empire
Fall - Into second Death
