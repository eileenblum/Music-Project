Blood and iron
3000 armed to the teeth
Poised dogs of war
Time to loosen the leash

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Kampfgruppe advancing
In burning bridges light

Silent night
We share the sacred promise of death
Holy night
Aligned shall we enter the last breath

Silent night, holy night
Red snow - oh, love's pure light
Young blood, shining star
It's not your time to fall

Blood and iron
800 forced to retreat
Victory is lost
But this was no defeat

Silent night
We share the sacred promise of death
Holy night
Aligned shall we enter the last breath

Silent night
We share the sacred promise of death
Holy night
Aligned shall we enter the last breath
