Riding the winds of blood
Heavy steps on the fuse between
Life and death and hell
Swift march on a road of swords and oaken leaves
...oaken leaves ...oaken leaves

One creed above the mud
One creed: sweat saves blood!
One creed above the mud

Shackled and caged
Frontline raptor with feathers burnt
Claw and hunger's pain
Eleven summers gone yet evading the rope
...evading the rope ...evading the rope
Cut are the wings of the last fallen

One creed above the mud
One creed: sweat saves blood!
One creed above the mud

Gently inviting death
Blowtorch-battalion flame long dead
Bare throat, shadow sings
One last cup of tea while waiting for the fire
...for the fire ...for the fire
Cursed is the crown of the last fallen
