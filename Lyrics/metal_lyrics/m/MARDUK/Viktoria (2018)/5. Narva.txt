Smeared with blood
And covered with the fine dust
Of a quaint baroque city no more
Dance of death
See Narva go down in flames
Dawn of wrath - a fate on wings of war

Wallonian guts cover the ground
Flemish remains piled up along the pavement
Russian ashes spread to the wind
Estonian limbs scattered across the town square of pain

Hammering - keep hammering
With bomb and with shell
Hammering - keep hammering
Again and again

All our hopes
Reduced to a fine powder
All our dreams
A pile of charred remains
Onward to the hills of the inferno
Orphanage and grenadier defaced

Down... see Narva go down!
Down... see Narva go down!

Norwegian blood like paint on the walls
German entrails all over the cobblestone street
Danish bodies burnt to a crisp
Swedish remains piled along the avenue of death

Hammering - keep hammering
With bomb and with shell
Hammering - keep hammering
Again and again
