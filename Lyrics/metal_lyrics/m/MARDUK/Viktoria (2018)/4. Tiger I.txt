Teutonic knights of old march once again
Grand horse of steel, sword of flame - the ground is shaking
Massive apparatus of death, 58 tons of hate
Un-forgivingly rolling in to seal your fate

Chariot of flames
Grinding the seeds of peace
Duels in the mist
Panzer fist

Cold steel predator on swift caterpillar bands
Carrying the voice of war in all the land
Voracious carnivore proven by killing score
Whose silhouette alone shall bring fear forevermore

Guardians of the Reich
Iron stars burning bright
Glorious iron sun
Panzer VI - Tiger I

Thundering over frozen fields in remote Russian land
Hardship and battering in Tunisian sand
To hell and back and over Italian mountain-slopes
Normandy's green hedges hold the ending of hopes

Chariot of flames
Grinding the seeds of peace
Duels in the mist
Panzer fist

Guardians of the Reich
Iron stars burning bright
Glorious iron sun
Panzer VI - Tiger I

Guardians of the Reich
Iron stars burning bright
Glorious iron sun
Panzer VI - Tiger I
