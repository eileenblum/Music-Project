Death, our comrade in arms
We are the black cohort - the skull-bearing swarm
We stand together, never alone
Just keep singing the Devil's song!

We bear the Devil's mark
Carved into our souls
And upper left arms

Death, our comrade in arms
We are the hounds of war - the swine of the front
We drink together, seldom alone
Just keep whistling the Devil's song!

Our heaven
Is the Great War
On earth we live in battle
Our eternal life

Our heaven
Is the Great War
On earth we live in battle
Our eternal life

Death, our comrade in arms
We are the knights of the blood
With skin like the sun
We fall together, sometimes alone
Just keep humming the Devil's song
