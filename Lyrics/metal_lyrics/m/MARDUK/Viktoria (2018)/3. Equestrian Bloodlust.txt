Foaming horses in the night
Riding hussars of guiltless death
Sour milk and genocide
Kettle drum and bayonet

Equestrian blood lust
Equestrian attack!

Mounted squadrons riding east
Thundering hooves over Pripet marsh
Lured by the tunes of the coming feast
Blood on the blade and blood on the cross

Florian Geyer - beat the kettle drum
Florian Geyer - pray and death will come

Partisans bent down in fright
Deprived of courage and ready for death
No-one you know will live through the night
Resistance draws its final breath

Equestrian blood lust
Equestrian attack!

Mounted squadrons riding east
Thundering hooves over Pripet marsh
Lured by the tunes of the coming feast
Blood on the blade and blood on the cross

Bridles and stirrup
Death no longer awaits
Death is now!

Equestrian blood lust
Equestrian attack!
Equestrian blood lust
Equestrian attack!
