With my pale eyes, I watch with delight
Beyond the horizon on the everlasting night
A heart so black and cold as ice
A soul in fire blessed and baptized
Lucifer is the fallen light-bearer
For his glory we must all burn!
Children of darkness..
Raise your blood-filled cups to our father with horns
In eternity, we shall blaspheme the one who was tormented with thorns
A new era will arise as I see the black angels of the abyss fly
And the demons come storming in the silent cloud-less sky
With their burning eyes of ripping evil..
I am given strength from a thousand sinners
That dwell in the everlasting, burning, roaring depths of Hell
With the demons the possess my blackened heart and soul
I shall strive for Satan's triumph and reach infernal goals
Children of darkness..
Raise your blood-filled cups to our father with horns
In eternity, we shall blaspheme the one who was tormented with thorns

Feel the darkness growing when we draw near
My name is legion, for we are many in here
Heaven shall burn accompaigned by the angels' cries
We shall invert paradise
DEATH TO PEACE!!!
