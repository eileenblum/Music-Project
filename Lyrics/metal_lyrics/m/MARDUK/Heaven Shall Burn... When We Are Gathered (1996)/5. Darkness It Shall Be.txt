I have dreamt the dreams about Satan's beautiful promises
Of the dark arts, and the blackened powers I possess
I have dreamt about worlds burning in millions of fires
And the worthless christianity burning with them
I and you are all that is dark of the world
And so we shall greet the everlasting night with pride
You and I bear the wisdom of a thousand geniuses
And we are granted the right to lead the people to their ends
I have dreamt a thousand dreams about crushing other's dreams
And also to unite the superior people of mine
I have dreamt about the mortals' fears and terrors
But no horror will be as great as the fear of you and I
I and you will strike with the words and fist of Satan
Our enemies and friends alike to the ground
You and I with our brother of higher birth
Shall ignore the cries, and ignore the lament of the fools
A new age will come, and a new King will be crowned
A new age will arrive.. In your own blood, you shall be drowned
This new age of Satan - The new age of Hell
This is what I have seen, and darkness it shall be
I have dreamt about the most wonderful things
And I know that I'm a chosen one on Satan's side
I have dreamt about peace, happiness, love and good
And I have the key to destroy all of that
I and you bear the soul and power of the evil fire
So that we can rule the world with dark desire
You and I are the artists of evil
And the painting of the new world
We will create, shall bath in blood
I have dreamt about the deeds of the very past
But none of them are as great as those to come
I have dreamt about great days to come
When I shall wear the black crown, and rule with Satanic might
I and you are born of the same great blood
And we are proud warriors in the great army of Satan
You and I have got the world in our grasp
The world at our knees, and the vision of destruction in our eyes
A new age will come..
I HAVE DREAMT THE DREAMS THAT WILL COME TRUE
