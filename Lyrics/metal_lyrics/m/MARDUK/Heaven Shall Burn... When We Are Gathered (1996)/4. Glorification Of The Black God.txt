Glorification of the black god
In the shape of a black goat - The dark lord himself
Presiding over the revelry..
Demons, witches, and spirits of Darkness await
And watch with pleasure on the succumbed virgins
And innocent souls.. Soon to be sacrificed
The only light is the gleam of the torches from the inverted women wombs
And the fire from the cauldron, in which human fat is being boiled
The air is filled with diabolical laughter and screams
Spells are whirling, and the smell of hell is spreading all around
The appearance of spirits of Darkness from the heart of Hell
A necromantical union brought forth to haunt the night
The christains fled like pigs, overwhelmed with fear
Except glimpses of the moon surrounded by stars
Clouds block the nocturnal light, as the earth trembles
Under hooved feet accompaigned by..
The beating of skins under the blackened sky

Noone dares to tread the mountain on this night

They watch with enlarged eyes, in fear from afar
As the lightning joins the perverted dance at the bare mountain
