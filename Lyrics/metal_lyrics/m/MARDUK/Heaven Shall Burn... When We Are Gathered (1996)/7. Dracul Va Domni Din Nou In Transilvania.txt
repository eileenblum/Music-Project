[Sighisoara, Transilvania in the year of 1431]

All demons ride high upon the bewitching Nightsky
They are only disturbed by a new-born child's painful cry
Son of the great dragon, come forth to rule
In all your glory, no man, no beast will be as cruel
All the angels and the puny men of god looked away
Frightened to death by the evil that was born on that day
Dracul come forth, and see your son's soul is powerful
Triumphantly holding his son, nothing could be as delightful
In our order you are now, for the sake of your greatness
You must murder the muslim turks in thousands, no less
Let them feel our never-ending wrath and our steel
We are men of god, so let them know it for real
It's our mission to seek our enemies, and kill them one by one
They must be destroyed in time, be sure to teach your new-born son
We must bath in the blood of the vermins, called turks, to win
The muslims are to be executed, for they live in great sin

Sultan Murad of the turks is getting more powerful each day
Dracul will not be one of them that for his mercy will pray
He must turn his back on his previous allies
And conspirate with the turks
Beware you all of the evil blood that in Dracul lurks
The holy Roman emperor will get angered with this
But Dracul must protect himself, it's a right of his
So feel the greedy claws of death, you weak men of god
Treacherous thoughts was the father of the berserker prince Vlad
(In the year of 1438)
Seven years of age is he and already in bloody war
His eyes do not turn away from all that death and gore
Father Dracul and brother Mircea are riding by his side
Proud he is of his warrior father, no matter he lied
Together with the turks, they ravaged through the land
Dragon and beast, devils and demons fighting hand-in-hand
Transilvania - You great home of ours
You they will crush, there is no God to help us

What feeds an evil mind?
What makes a man a man?
The deeds of death!

But greater stories are yet to be told..
