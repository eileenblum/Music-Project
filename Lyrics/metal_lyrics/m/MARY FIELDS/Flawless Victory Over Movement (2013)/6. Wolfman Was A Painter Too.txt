We've fostered addictions as hope. We foster our addictionsÂ 
It's the correlation we honor inÂ life
We've fostered addictions as hope. Is this the new order of the worlds
"I want to die drinking liquor"
"I want to die drinking liquor"

And yet you stay polite

Gulp down, it is quicker. Everything gets better with liquor
Set it off, quick-witted. The whole nine yards are suited for

Don't say stop. You haven't had enough. Don't say stop
Don't trust the wolf in mouse cloths
Don't trust the wolf in me

Hey their foxy momma, show us your worn out drama
Hey their worst of momma's, show us yourÂ 
Hey their doped up momma, methadone baby momma
Hey their white trash momma, show us, show us, show us

Sniff lines, that are whiter, they'll sure make your life a lot brighter
Big hitter, you're septum will exist no more

Let's run out together, in May
It would make me feel better, if I may
So that you will pray for.
Light.

Our wills are redundant
Our minds are in strange
Fear, and Loathing all the way

The future holds it all. The future holds it all, in all
The future holds it all, is all, but all, that lies in all of us.
