Â Â  Â 
We are lied to by rabbitsÂ 
We could not tell them all apart
Interest. Beholder. It's time for disclosure
We are bait
Â Â 
You'll better call in solicit
Take heed, for all those in favorÂ 
You're killing us off, you're getting it off
Give it, shut eye, tamper with the white lie

Board up your doors and shut the windows with haste.
The cities will fall but that's the sacrifice we make
The rain will be red and our kingdoms will flood
The locals will carve a V for Vendetta as it's time to...

Raid on, raid on. Let's hear, for all those in favor
Give us your vote, give us your voice
To moan in a-perfect dissonance Â 
They are afraid of us, a cornered bull andÂ we are the chinaÂ 

To settleÂ scores. We will go to such lengthsÂ 
We will take what's left, take what is ours.
The small of stature will be the one to cast the tallest shadows.

Board up your doors and shut the windows with haste.
The cities will fall but that's the sacrifice we make
The rain will be red and our kingdoms will flood
The locals will carve a V for Vendetta as it's time to...

We're deep in the rabbit hole. We've shunned your ways
Get by. Get buy. This is a bidding war

Fuel my gains with the blood you spill.
Blow are whistle, you're out of bounds. Are bloated belly's are never filled.
Extinguish the fire, extinguish the fire that burns within.
You may poor down upon us but we will swim, we will sing, we will not sink
Your strong backs are perfect, your strong wills can still be feebled.

With a lass or our switch we'll make you jump ship
This is no tea party so get on your knees
We're just servants
