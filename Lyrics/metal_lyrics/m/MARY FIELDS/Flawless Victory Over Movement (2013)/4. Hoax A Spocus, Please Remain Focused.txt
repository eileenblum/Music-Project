From head to tail, opposed to others, we are unable to say.
It breaths containment, it breaths carbon-monoxide
It bares death for teeth, it bares death for teeth.

Slip past the eye, of the all seeing iron grip the fraction has.
We are a cult of ignorant remnants of a rase long-gone extinct.
With pears were over-hunted and laid to waste.

Revolting like Jack's smirking revenge, we are so well equipped to cope with this
You are but cyanide. Lost in their corrupt politics.
Take the picture, the stronghold and fortify life.

So here we are, stuck in a frame, we face the gantlet
We simplify and march abroad. We are spell bound byâ¦Â 

Are we not, or are we so. The oblivious ass on which politicians pin their tailÂ 
You are but cyanide. Lost in all, corrupt politics. Take the picture, the stronghold.
Bomb the walls, take them out, put up the fourth and falsify laws

So here we are, stuck in a frame, we face the gantlet
We simplify and march abroad,we are spell bound byâ¦Â 
A hoax, a fairy tail, it's a yay old lore. We fall for it every time,Â 
False tongue, false tongue, don't whisper to me now,
Don't instigate this fraudulent deceit anymore

You take the bait ... I'll call the tabloids out.
You take the bait ... I'll take the first train south
You take the bait ... I'll watch without a sound
You take the bait ... And all shall have been for naught
