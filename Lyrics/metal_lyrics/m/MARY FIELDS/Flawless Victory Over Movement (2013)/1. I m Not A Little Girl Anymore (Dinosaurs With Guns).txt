You are vile, beguiled, in guise, a child to me
Lay out the love, Air out the weakness
You state the awe, boss the awe, keen the bridle

Rising, Approving, Consenting
Linguistic string

In side the pediatrician I catch gold and other components
I find out, I find useful particle range, beyond that of logical constituent

Cry out fraud.Â Cry out for lust. Anthem at heart. Anthem of warÂ 
I'll raise your will in change. Your will is mine to command.
Spirit be mine to, spirit be mine to break.

You're to drown in the nurses office. You're to sound ill and diseased
Break their legs if they run, taze till they're stunned.
Break their legs if they run, they fear the cunt.

In side the pediatrician, I decline, fade away, drain away my life,
