Medic, medic, I need some help over here.
Medic, medic, Oh dear god, I'm losing him.

We've been cut off at the jaw
Flawless Victory Over Movement, here we come.
Footprints in the sand, goodbye. 'till never more

Sayonara heartache. I'll miss you like a snake misses it's legs.
Say we die, at least we gave them hell.
Say we die, at least we gave them hell.

You burn like the sun, yet all I require is the moon.
You burn like the sun, yet all I require is the moon.
You burn like the sun, yet all I require is the moon.
You burn like the sun, yet all I require is the godforsaken moon.

My nights are filled with blood and wine.
My nights are filled with blood and wine.
My knights are filled with blood and wine.
My knights are filled with blood and wine.
