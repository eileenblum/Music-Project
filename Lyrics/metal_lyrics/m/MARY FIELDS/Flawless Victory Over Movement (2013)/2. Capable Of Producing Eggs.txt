You said don't stop. Open your legs and rain down on my faceless synergy.Â 
For those who agree say I.Â 

Obey my queen, for I am king
You scream for help, oh dear god help me
It's all in vane, you won't be hurt
Like us, you wreck and play
A tongue as sharp as glass shardsÂ 

Angst the answer that lies on my face
What is a man to do when she ejeculates

Check the body, is it cold
Set to handle, all that is what's in your grasp.
No reflection. No redundancy. You will obey my authorityÂ 

I will mourn the day. 'Give me attention.'
Absence of her paint. 'You Give Me resurrection.'
Eyes on the body. Every warning, mingled fawningÂ 
No reproduction. Embrace the loss. Proper affection, didn't I mention

Come what me, save the day. Come what me, make my way.

Look at me now. I'm broken. Kill the voidÂ 
Summon the strength.. .. ..

You belong, you fit right in, you're right at home
Here in hollyweird everything is fakeÂ 
Â 
Come what me, save the day. Come what me, make my way
