From the land of Nazareth it came 
The prophecy of malediction 
Harbouring the knights of shame 
Mercenaries of celestial fiction 

The sword to Carthage doors 
The heathen dawn breaks through 
With the cost of a thousand child 

Tanit Demands Her Due 

Her followers to abandon 
The defense of sword and bow 
To build their graves abundant 

Tanit Demands Her Due 

[Solo]

They rode on headless horses 
That led our species doom 
From northern highlands and west sharp 
On a march that yields and looms 

The sword to Carthage doors 
The heathen dawn breaks through 
With the cost of a thousand child 

Tanit Demands Her Due 

Her followers to abandon 
The defense of sword and bow 
To build their graves abundant 

Tanit Demands Her Due
