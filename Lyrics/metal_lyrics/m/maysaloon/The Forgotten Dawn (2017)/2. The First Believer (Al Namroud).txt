Curious eyes behold 
Pages years long writ 
A story yet untold 
Man's vestment fits 
[Whispering:] 
"In Nomine Dei Nostri Satanas, Luciferi Excelsi" 

Take your steps aplenty, upon the rocks of fear and isolation 
With a heart ablaze and eyes are empty, and salute Man's highest of relations 

Two candles ample serve the light 
That bind you to your decadence 
A war of eyes you shall fight 
And pray your heart show resilience 

As he bears the light upon his back 
His eyes sure mercy often lack 
Meet thy Goddess strator 
The foremost instigator 

[Solo]

Alpha Serpentis, fear He who bestowed 
The Diabolic within you 
Sigma Serpentis, the end drew night 
A final malediction
