Lady of the Seven Moons
I'm the ancient long-last stem 
Of Lilith, Adonis, Baal and Shem 
I am the Phoenician sailor 
The lawful heir of celestial failure 

Onto the crescent of fertility 
I were to march in endless effigy 
Of countless enemies waging war 
Against my innermost sleeping core... "quest"! 
Seals of Astatre 
Seals of Astarte 

I forge with flesh and blood my 
The holy, the fallen pagan lord 
The synagogue I, and the Shrine 
The church, the mosque, the dream divine 

Encircled I, and will not sate 
To the wall, to the seal, to the highest gate 
I, batter my way through 
And further breed death anew 

I was, I am, and will be known 
For all the malice I shall bestow
