On the path of revealing 
Silent voices, corrupting innocence 
By the time, seeds of sanity 
Suffer my existence 

For an obscure truth 
Lying tolerance 
Beyond a widowed smile 
Crying shadows 

Never be broken, never be sold 
Of a dark side of insanity 
Disturbing intelligence 

Hysterical tongue younger than dreams 
In debt of an ancient wisdom 
In debt again... look around in debt 

The sound of another breaking 
The smell of self defending 
Of lies that eat your hatred 
Obey your shadows fading 

Your bones are slowly shaking 
Invisible tears of screaming 
Behold the flesh of fortune 
Now watch yourselves crying 

This wound... for what? 
This war... I'm fading 

Can't stand... this hell 
This shout... of hatred 

Can't stop... bleeding 
My blood... is healing 

Escape... this shame 
Or lose... your name 

This hell is never ending 
No signs of human breathing 
Hearing the angel's weeping 
Your heaven should be burning
