Human kind's aslumber 
With all plagues it spreads 
Gods are left outnumbered 
In the face of they've made 

Vast emptiness of content 
Subdue the honored grail 
Of what we worship and lament 

And still we always fail 
To praise the reason of homage 
The act of hospitality 
To slay the pious courage 

In all shapes and sizes 
We manifest the spheres 
In search of further prizes 
The crown's what we endear 

What shuns our delusions forth 
To kill the seeds of innocence 
Protecting our infected force 
We look up to the sky 
Whether we had sown our wounds
