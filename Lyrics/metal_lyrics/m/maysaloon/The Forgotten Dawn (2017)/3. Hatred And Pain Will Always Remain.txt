War with reality, war with insanity 
This war is in our heads 
The Empire is falling, the black birds are calling 
And the rage is filling me with hate 

Bathed in the blood of enemies 
I walk this endless path 
Victorious I march to my agony 
To quench my senseless wrath 

Now, we fight the battle of the living dead 
And, you'll fight for your life 

In this war... You are dead 
To be no more... It's the end 
Preaching the dead 
Breaking the wall of death

Regret not... Resent not 
For death will indept us 
Repent not... Forget not 
And quench some of the blood's lust 

[Solo]

Hatred and pain will always remain! 
Hatred and pain will always remain! 

Regret not... Resent not 
For death will indept us 
Repent not... Forget not 
And quench some of the blood's lust 

Perpetuous, pernicious, malicious and war machines 
Eternal destruction, instant disruption 
Total construction, away from perfection 
Hatred and pain will always remain! 
Hatred and pain will always remain!
