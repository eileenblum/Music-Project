Before me no created things were
Save those eternal
And eternal I abide
Abandon all hope

I'm the sacred, descendant from the skies

I'm the hatred, the truthful sin of lies

A sphere holds thy one, dropped and drowned
Shrouded by unholy flames

Flesh to flesh, in and out
One by one, creatively sliced

Despise the heavens, enlighten the cosmos
Arise the fallen, and form your own creation

Slay and pray, this is the cry of man
This haunted mind, will unveil the seventh sin

Despise the heavens, enlighten the cosmos
Arise the fallen, deform your own salvation

Bleeding our own tears
Weeping, and yet we fail to realize
That killing has it's own price
Upon those who held the Warsphere

The Sphere has fallen, and now we rise
From the ashes of our long-lost sins
The Sphere will tell us, how we spilled our blood
Filling the empty fields with hate and wars
