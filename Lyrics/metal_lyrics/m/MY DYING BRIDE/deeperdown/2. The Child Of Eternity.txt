Screaming out
Windows of victory
Tolling bell
Burn into history

Screaming out
Icons of hating
Tolling bell
Drifting on, man's pier

As ghost we swords clash
Racing up the stair of god

Fury's fire
Oceans of sorrow
Dark desire
Dream has to fall in

The ancient child of eternity
Not a thing of this world
Tortured movements
Into the terrible seas, drowning, drowning
Time is lost for every man
Counting downwards

Poised with arms
Raised for holy angels
Conquerors, warriors
Holy angels
Leaving flight, a bloody sight
Crimson rivers

Screaming out
Windows of victory
Holy hell
The child of eternity
