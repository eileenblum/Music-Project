My beauty and by fear, along with hunger's tears.
By the last of the day's heat, the broken women weep.
So take my dying soul. It never felt so old.
I thank my enemy for having thought of me.
Desires on the shadow of God.
Who becomes the last to fall?
Hate, in the soul of them all.
Do we live, awakened, hoping?
Raise your eyes to him, for him.
Here it comes, closer, closer.
At every hour death seems closer.
Long shadows surround me, call me.
I feel its hand upon me.
I smell its death upon me.
And its midnight conquers me.
And now â it is me!
Carry the old words home and lay them into stone.
As hard as the earth, we leave a cold new curse.
Unknown words lying under my speech dying.
Where the altar should have been, can no longer be seen.
Iâd seen bastions fall, and I pity your war.
I seize your thorn and
I am known to all whores.
I danced in a dream.
I did not make a sound.
I have seen what I cannot receive.
Whispering my given name.
Unfurls the fingers of flame.
Nameless sons and daughters of sin.
Step forward when you hear the bells ring.
