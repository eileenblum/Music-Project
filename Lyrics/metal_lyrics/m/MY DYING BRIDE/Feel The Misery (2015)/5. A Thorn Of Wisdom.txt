Hereâs dark here, dark enough and just the pain you love.
Your reflection is a dying me. Use it well and flee from me.
You hide your hair from victims and stoop to drink straight from them.
I know my heart flows away from thee.
And wounded tears come crashing down.
I sometimes enjoy solitude.
Inspecting her shame keeps me amused.
Leave the world and pain to me
And keep your soul far from sleep
And ghost turned against ghost.
I lay for you and I was choked
The cost to me being more than I had to bestow.
I sometimes enjoy solitude.
