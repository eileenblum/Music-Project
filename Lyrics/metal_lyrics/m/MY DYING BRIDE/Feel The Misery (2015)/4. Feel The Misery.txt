The music of neglect
The words always reject
Feel the misery

Some claim it's tragedy
Some claim calamity
Feel the misery

Do not waste happiness
Or sing for loneliness
Feel the misery

Follow the falling path
And take every single lash
Feel the misery

A riot of beauty
Lacking in dignity
Feel the misery

Is it worth the wait?
Is there hope for me?
Can it really wait?
Let us watch and see

The fairest flowers fade
Stolen away by shade
Feel the misery

Love is full of fear
Loved ones soon disappear
Feel the misery

These are the words not
Of one who kneels to god
Feel the misery

The music of neglect
The words always reject
Feel the misery

Some claim it's tragedy
Some claim calamity
Feel the misery

Some blame the moon above
Some blame a missing dove
Feel the misery
