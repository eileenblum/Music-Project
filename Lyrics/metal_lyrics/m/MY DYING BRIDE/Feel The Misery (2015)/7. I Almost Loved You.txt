Across her body I fled.
"You never knew," she said.
All me listened, and listen still.
"All things betray you â and I will."
And in her hand sat my hand.
Cold the sun and waters ran.
As the deep called me up
I named her as my love.
I wandered half the night
To cast a secret ring in fire.
Weâd been lovers only a short time
Yet I stand, pretty in your mouth.
You and the night slip by.
You are incomplete without me.
You were made great.
How men loved you.
A dying star.
I almost loved you.
