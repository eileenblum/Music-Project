Looking across the way, she yells out loud
got no time today, I'm still stuck in this crowd
pushing them from my face, she isn't far behind
I'll win this human race if I obey the signs

Throw my hands in the air
I'm fucking mad, no one cares
I'd kill them all without a thought
take a bow when I get caught

She's closer now, just a throw away
I cannot slow, I cannot stay
she screams to me, one last chance
I stumble 'round and catch a glance
