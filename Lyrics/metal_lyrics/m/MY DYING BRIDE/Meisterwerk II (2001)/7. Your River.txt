Your bloodied body is what I cling to
in powerful rain, they laid their heads to die
let your dark, thirsty eyes drink deep the sights of me
it's sad that in our blindness we gather thorns for flowers
your river holds a feast of danger
the suffering you have had to bear
I'd die for that moment one more time
the loved one falls below your ideals
pleasure too safely enjoyed lacks zest
the brave lick their sickening lips
rigid, handsome and a poet, a king in his passionate castle
where now? feed me, hold me, save me, save yourself
where now? which way? dear God, show me
take your own, struggle free, arise, you're ruined
stand down, your kin piled thick around you, save yourself
