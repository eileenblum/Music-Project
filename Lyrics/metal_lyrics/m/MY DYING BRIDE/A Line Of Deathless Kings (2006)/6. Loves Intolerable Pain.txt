Denial of our shadow side
Will often cause it to rise up
Against us

That he does not need to die
Allows his mind to soar
To fly

What if love's intolerable pain never leaves?
What will your life's mark leave upon this world?
What now, will my dark craft do with your body now?
We walk as Gods together through a fiery dawn
What if you love someone you know you shouldn't love?
What will your dying father's last words to you be?
What now, the painting of young lovers is complete?

What if love's intolerable pain never leaves us?
So we dash our bleeding hearts on the rocks of loneliness?
And cry unto the lords above who turn away in haste?

From the heart
Heart of snow
Comes the ice
It's crushing blow
From the soul
Whose love is sound
Comes the cold
It's frozen ground.
