A Serpent it came to me
Right before my eyes
I looked to God way above me
He looked down at my lies

I said "oh Lord please help me
I am on my knees"
"Your path is yours" he told me
"Yours to reap"

A mighty wind did pull me
Tore at my face
My flesh is raped at his hand
I am the world's disgrace

The Heaven opened above me
And down Gods tears came
Lashing away at my skin
My stinking, rotten frame

I though I'd fought the demons that roamed above me
I thought I'd slew their blood red hands
Their hearts still beat with all the hatred for me
Their mark still burns into my very soul
And I walk with them.
They're shadowing my soul.
