[Bonus Track]The sweetheart of Death, it reaches for me
I ask the meaning for us
The midnight of you, swims into sunlight
I couldn't be more obvious
A river beside, it went by them all
And ordered the words from the sea

I stumbled over hills to be with her
As the sun dropped her flesh
I gave up my tears, crawling from grief
To tell the story of her death
My faults are your, your reward
My fears look up, I watch the lord

Then God fell into my arms
Orating lonely psalms
With his flag proudly waved
Above the good and brave
