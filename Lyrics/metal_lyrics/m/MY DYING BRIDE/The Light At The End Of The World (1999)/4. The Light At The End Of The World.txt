Small a speck in the wide blue sea.
'Tis the last of all the land.
A dweller upon our lonesome isle, the last lonely man

On weary nights under stars
he'd ofter lay and gaze.
Up towards the moon and stars,
The sun's dying haze.

Time and again Orion's light
filled our man with joy.
Within the belt he'd see his love
remembering her voice.

Such is life upon the isle
of torment and woe.
One day good, one day bad,
And some days even hope.

The light at the end of the world
burns bright for mile and mile
Yet tends the man its golden glow
in misery all the while.

For fifty years he stands and waits atop the light alone.
Looking down upon his isle the Gods have made his home

A deity felt sympathy
and threw our man a light
- 'Your woman you may see
again for a single night'.

- 'I'll tend the light for one more night
with the woman whom I love',
screamed the man with tearful eyes
to the deity above.

And so it was that very night
his lover did return.
To his arms and to their bed
together they did turn.

In deepest love and lust for life
entwined they did fall.
Lost within each other's arms they danced

Her hair, long and black,
The dark beauty of her eyes.
Olive skin and warm embrace,
her memory never dies.

Agony, like none before,
was suffered by our man.

Anger raged and misery too
like nothing ever before.

His sacrifice was not so great,
he insists upon the world.
Again he would crime, again he would pay,
for one moment with the girl

Long was the night filled with love.
For them the world was done.
Awoke he did to brightest light,
his woman and life had gone.

To his feet he leapt, to the sea he looked.
To the lighthouse on the stone.
The price is paid and from now on
he lives forever alone.

Fifty years have passed since then
and not a soul has he seen.
but his woman lives with him still
in every single dream.

Tis sad to hear how young love has died
to know that alone someone has cried.
but memories are ours to keep.
To live them again, in our sleep.
