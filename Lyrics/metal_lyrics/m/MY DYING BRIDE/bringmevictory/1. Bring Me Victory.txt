Is there anything left
Left of me to save
My life is like a carnival
My body a sunken grave

It's what I have to do
To distance me from you
Lays a suffering inside
And my veins are showing through

A man becoming child
Are you happy with your cries
With haunted looks of fear
I stab the wing from your side

My mind a fractured ruin
The crushing of my soul
It is time to spread my wings
To fill this empty hope

It has now begun
The force fed sun beneath
Will conquer all before
And bring me to my victory

I've seen them before
Down from the fall
And now standing tall
I've seen this
I have been this
And now I am my own man

No more misery
Look outside and see
What are you waiting for?
Pick yourself up
Get up off the floor
