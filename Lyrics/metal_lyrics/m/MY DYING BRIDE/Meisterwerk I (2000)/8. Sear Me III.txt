Come to me, comfort me, take my hand
in your arms, in your eyes I will be forever yours
bring me down to your bed, to your dreams

Take my life, take everything
through those meadows of heaven, where we ran forevermore
I wish, oh, how I wish again with you, oh to be with you

So lay me down, close to you, hold me now, my lover
I kiss your tears, my sweet one and kiss again, my love


Thanks to alex_radonov for sending track #7 lyrics.
