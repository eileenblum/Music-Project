Falling, drowning, deeper and forever
choking, sinking, deeper into this ocean
screaming, crying for someone to save me
reaching, hoping, calling to no-one

My only sin was to kill a man, deep was my pain
but I'd do the same again, beat it out, out of me
cut me up and watch me bleed, strike me down
cast me out, throw me into the ocean's mouth
my only prayer was to a god who I don't believe
but all the same, I'm on my knees, beat it out, out of me
cut me up and watch me bleed, strike me down
cast me out, throw me into the devil's mouth

Bleeding, weeping, calling to no-one
pleading, almighty, why can't you hear me?
my only sin was to kill a man, deep was my pain
but I'd do the same again, beat it out, out of me
cut me up and watch me bleed, strike me down
cast me out, throw me into my own mouth

Take me away to a better place, far from anyone
by myself and leave a gun, beat it out, out of me
cut me up and watch me bleed, strike me down
cast me out, throw me into my saviour's mouth
