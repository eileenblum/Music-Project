Open me and drink up my scarlet
kiss me deep, kiss me deep and love me forever more
bloody love, bloody love inside of you, swallow me
thank God there's nothing I can do

Come with me, my friend, come and see the end
and let me swallow up your pain
leave the village lights, step into the night
open your mouth to my bloody rain
and at your second birth, we will slay the earth
and stalk mankind till heaven burns
just lay down for me, naked for me to see
it's just one kiss, that's all I need

Take me down, down to the bloody shore
dig me deep, dig me deep and leave me forever more
lay me down, down with all of them and forget me
like you forgot the rest of them
