I will be here for you, all I want is you
when I see your face, all the angels are shamed
lay with me, beauty, feel me close to you
take my hand to you, touch you softly, your warm skin

Cover me with you, over me, under you
pull me in to you as one we lay entwined
all I ever wanted, I have
I need never wish again, you are heaven sent
