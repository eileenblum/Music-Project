Wintershire, we defend, up hills high
Into the dark weave of a great dark storm
Cold, red snow, from their flow from sword and bow
Kings and men, fall or fight, a punishing
Everywhere, thousands lie. God almighty!
Driving them from our land to their sea

Great fathers and sons, brothers everyone
Out upon that scene, under wintersun
Draw your blade once more. From the trees they pour
Say a prayer out loud. Let us end this war

Sweat at the sword and the killing hand
Let the steel answer them. Show no mercy!
And snow leaves a drift of sin and loathing
Yet they come evermore. What is this!

Many fell today, and their bodies lay
All across this land as their spirit fades
Name upon name, fabled and brave
Years of doing this, but they always came

My wounds let me know the rage of winter and the world
Every hour, I'm broken down. I will not kneel before you broken
Nearer now, their faces clear. And books held in bloodstained gloves

Right from here I can see the whole world dying in their flames
In the beginning, were the words they forced into me
Pages inked in blood. A new God comes to save us all
