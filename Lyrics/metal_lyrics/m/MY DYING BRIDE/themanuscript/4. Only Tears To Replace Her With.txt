Salvation dropped me from her dying arms
Endless, the skies are dark
This world is nothing without her
As it limps from beauty's answer
It dies in the hand of summer
This long savannah of her

The weapon of your body
Lays my city to waste
From blood on my golden sand
I came up and washed you

I'd lost saints for you!
Drew towers into the earth
And a silver blade from God
Hands directly above us

Bacchus drowns more men than Neptune
And I put my name among them
I hate everyhing around me
But I want to carry you back
To Heaven
