Our great god lies naked next to me
I witnessed death in his beauty
I feel him when he breathes, as we fall
and I clasp him to me as we fall
Shouldering your sadness unto me
The great caldera moon to the east
The annihilation from your eyes
Flowing deep into me from your eyes
You wallow in your suffering
and swim in your senseless grief
The shadow of your body
Is cast upon only me
Goodnight my love, goodnight.
I fall upon your body
Fall with me into my frozen flesh
My hungry death
You tremble before me
and swallow my dying breath
Caress me, undress me, forget me
As winter comes
Your pale skin, crystal eyes
I will weep forever, oh my god why?
As fire fell upon great Alexandria
Our arms were close around us
Forever gods turned away
Give the word and down comes beautiful rain
glorious pain
Armies of salvation laid to waste
The host lifts its desire from it's face
In a memory from a past life leaps the beast
Devouring all around, the colossal feast
