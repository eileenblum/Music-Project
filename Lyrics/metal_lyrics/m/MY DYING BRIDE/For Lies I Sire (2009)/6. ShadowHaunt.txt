She already knows how this will end
The wounds of memory she tends
Ghost and strangers
She flees her own grief
Forever running
Haunted she sleeps
In shadows she lays all alone
Remembering her lover gone
Through forests she walks every day
Through winter storms, every day
She looks through dark eyes
Over her shoulder
She already knows when it will find her
I'm coming, keep running
Tormenting you!
Hastily do you flee
I'm coming!
I'm coming!
My dear, I'm here
All shadow and sorrow
I have thee, final ly
Embracing you!
Young lover, it's over
together and never!
