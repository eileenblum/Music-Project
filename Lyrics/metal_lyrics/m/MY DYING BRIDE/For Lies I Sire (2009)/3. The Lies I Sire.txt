Before us lies the story of
Enfolding joy, endless love
Given to me through a dream
A following brought from above

I couldn't help myself
God walks by my side
Within my limbs burns hate
Believe me how I cried
The tremble of my hand
Blinded by my tears
But I stand heroic
The holy words I heed

With glory and blazing eyes
I rise into bloody skies
Myself a storm, ravaging
The wrath of God, down I bring

With mercenary smile
I rise up from the shade
As the king of all souls
The pounding of my wings
Tearing through the night
Death's taking his toll

The searing heat. Burning eyes. Fury and fire
A forest of torn victims
The lies I sire

My work is done and I leave none
The passion in my dying words
The grief I leave is meaningless
The lies within these ancient words
