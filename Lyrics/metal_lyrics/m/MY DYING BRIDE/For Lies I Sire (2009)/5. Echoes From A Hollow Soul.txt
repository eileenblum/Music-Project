A boy so young upon the gallows
Gazing down like a saint
From the church of children's cries
The awaited one anticipates

Issued from her mouth
A further request
The sons of Adam
Put to death

A voice is heard
Echoes from a hollow soul
A golden word
Wrapped in books of skin and blood
From harmony leaps a vision of your guilt
And treachery smiles, oh so very sweet

The last whisper from a dying heart
Limps away through the night
Chased by angels falling through the sky
As the snow, oh what a sight

This closing river takes all away
Daughters of Eve slowly fade (fade away)

Given the word and the movement will begin
If it's unheard, the message must be sent
So slowly now, like the early morning bloom
And this is how the perishing will come
