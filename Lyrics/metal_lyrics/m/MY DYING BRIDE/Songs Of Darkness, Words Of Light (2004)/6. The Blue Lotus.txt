Under the darkened ancient oak
Gentle in the nights breeze
I stop and stare, rest a while
With hands upon my knees
Through jaded leaves, bush and scrub
I spy my journeys end
Black it looms, silent gloom
The castle called Avend
On I trot, past forest eyes
Past horrors of the night
Through the dark I see a sign
A gentle glowing light

Upon reaching the castle I ascend the ivy
Towards the window
My heart pounds my breath is rushed
As I fight both brick and branch
The ledge is mine and over I sweep
Silent like the snow
Quiet I slip across the floor
Tonight I'll dine with chance

Old poems and stories gone
A beauty of unimaginable lust
Both men's hearts, and Gods, were won
Skin like milk, an angels face
They say her smile could kill
Her hair the blackest of all black
Stories I thought though still

So there she lay sleeping upon the bed
Her breast I see, moves with her dreams
A sight I will always recall
A single candle that showed me the way

Closer I creep, toward my prize
The Blue Lotus lies before me
Her lips are full, red as blood
Moist as they invite me
Stoop I did to kiss those lips
In that glowing room
When suddenly she did awake,
Her eyes filled with doom
From silks her hands were round my neck
Escape there was no hope
A brief flash of teeth is all I saw
And gone was my throat
Her blood lust deep, she swallowed me
Red was all I saw
She drank her fill and watched me fall
Gently to the floor

A league away my death is found
By locals who tens this land
Who lay me down in shallow earth
A single Lotus placed in my hand
