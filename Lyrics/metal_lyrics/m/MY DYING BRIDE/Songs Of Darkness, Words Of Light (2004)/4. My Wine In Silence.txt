Where are you now my love?
My sweet one.
Where have you gone oh my love?
I'm so alone.

I only think of you.
And it drives me down.
I only dream of you.

Come here
My lover
I'll keep you
I will change you
Come here
My slave
You will live
Forever
Screaming
Crying
My lover
With you
I'm gone
At last

I'll come to you. Take my hand.
Hold me again. Please take my hand

Who are you?!
What were you?!
My beauty
I can't tell
How I feel
How I felt
You have paid
For your
un-kind-ness
With You
I'm done
At last

Please hold me now my love.
Where are you now, oh my sweet love.
