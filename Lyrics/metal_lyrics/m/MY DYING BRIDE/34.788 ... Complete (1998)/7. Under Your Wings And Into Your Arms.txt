I need to see a sign
Will you take me away?
They come. They go. Will you stay here?
I need to see a sign

You need me
Who wants more?
I need him
to find my way

Be there now
Feel them
Be my call

I'll be the one
I'll lose the fight
You sing the songs
Of one hundred nights

Bring them to me
Because I know I'm right
and I will take them all away
Never to be seen again

I'll take them to the sea
Leave it all to me
because I'm feverish, devilish and irrelevant

You need me
I want you
I need, I need, I need, I need
Are you there with me?

Be there now
Feel me now
All my world
