Tell me that I'm a sinner
Lay me down again
I need a soft flesh bed
My lust must be fed
Lay your hands on me
Lay your perfect hands on me
You know exactly what I want
So open wide
Take me now I'm yours
Lay me down again
Your heat rips through me
Your hands rip my skin
Deep inside your love
You're screaming for me again
My seed is passed to you
We are now one
To you. I'll only give it to you
(But only if you're there)
Only you. There's no-one else for me
(Until something better comes)
Be mine. Be mine forever more
(Until I'm fucking sick of you)

[reversed speech:]
How old are you?
Tell me what you remember about your first few birthdays?
How tall was your mother?
I said. How tall was your mother?
What colour was her favourite dress?
Did you have any pets when you were a child?
You see a women stripping on a television in a shop window. Do you stay and see what happens or do you continue walking?
If a blind man drops some money in the street do you pick it up and give it back to him or keep it for yourself?
You're driving in your car and suddenly a cat runs out right in front of you and you accidentally hit it. You're in no hurry to get anywhere and the poor animal is screaming in pain but you don't bother to stop and help it. How do you feel?
