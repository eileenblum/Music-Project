I arrive splashed with blood
And try to fix my hair
My sword upon our path
It's better off there

My name is read aloud
And I menace through the door
A thunderstorm of eyes watch
As I'm fierce across the floor

Candles spit and ribbons red
Strings, bows and tune
Dancers glide and passions collide
I'm scouring the room

I know my enemies, everyone
And white throats in pearls
Carousel all about me
The lace. Those ribbons in curls

Cruelty is how they know me
Kindness is not my gift
A blade of glass my secrecy
Is poised at my wrist

They perish for my sadness
I saw gold in your eyes
Your gift here, tremendous
Like the God between your thighs

I leave splashed with blood
Your ribbon locks my hair
And all their joy was drowned
Not, of course, that I care
