My black, feathered breast
Unto comes o'er mast &amp; sail
Look upon a broken site
Torn apart through wind &amp; hail

Lead me to the chaos of water
As I reveal myself to you
A fall from God is a blessing unknown
Its rivers deep from which I drew

Where is the burning city?
Great Naples, its kings alone
A hunger roared and reared
A fool suffers in Rome

Mon enfant, prends patience,
BientÃ´t la nuit tombera.
Dors, si tu peux,
Et rÃªve de pays merveilleux.
