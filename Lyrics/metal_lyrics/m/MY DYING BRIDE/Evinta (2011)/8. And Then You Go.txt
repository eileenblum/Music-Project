Here is the darkest place I know
You found in your eyes a home
And then you go

Come up here to my face
Into wars we race
Eat up the haste

I am poor for the lord
My age is lead and sore
Sit beneath my jaw

There! My prints in the snow
The wind and me alone
And then you go

And within it your embrace
Long given away the chase
Away flees grace

And then you go
