[bonus track]

And we travel into the darkening,
Couldn't smile one final mistake,
The frozen tides keep heading south,
My broken home now far from you,
Surrender slow I move with you,
Whatever nothing you lead me to...
And we travel into the darkening,
Widening the roads behind,
We have reached the southern most,
And we want to know why, we want to know why.
Wish bound, the time has come to choose alone,
To crack the code while you are young, while we feel strong,
Have your revenge with what you saw,
The midnight sun, a life so lived few years and fast.
And we travel into the darkening,
Widening the roads behind,
We have reached the southern most,
And we want to know why, we want to know why.
And we travel into the darkening,
Widening the ones behind,
We have reached the southern most,
And we want to know why, we want to know why.
And we travel into the darkening,
Frightening the ones behind,
We have reached the hearthern most,
And they must to know why
They must to know why.
Darkening,
Lighting,
Frightening,
Weakening...
