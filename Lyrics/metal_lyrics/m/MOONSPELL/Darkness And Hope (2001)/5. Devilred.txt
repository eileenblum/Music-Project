She wears devilRed

she sweats the poison
-all over her
keeps me quiet
-inside her storm
she has the method
-no other knows

red as the veins,she likes to swim in
floating so gently,through this human misery

She must be a part
Of a Highest Plan
Something I canÂ´t understand

she wears devilRed

SheÂ´s selling a damned soul
To whoever pays the most
Her body-the cure
for all evil and good

red as the veins
she likes to swim in
floating so gently
through this human misery

She must be a part
Of the Highest Plan
Something I canÂ´t understand

she wears devilRed

devilred
