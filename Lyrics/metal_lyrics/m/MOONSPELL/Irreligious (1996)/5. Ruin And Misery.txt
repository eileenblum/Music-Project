In each of your failures
I saw my victory
And each time you fall
A knife tattoos a smile
On my lips you are now
Empty of life
And I am drunk with death

Raw models
Ruin and misery
Raw models
Ruin and misery

Raw models
Ruin and misery
Raw models
Ruin and misery

I can offer you a hand
To help you to hold the dagger
A perfect jewel for
Our perfect end

And as we lay, we kissed
Fingers wet with poison
Thinking to each one
There is beauty in death

Raw models
Ruin and misery
Raw models
Ruin and misery

Allow me to doubt
We were lovers who could really share
The only love between us
Was hate

Without hope we could not fear
And silent we disappeared
Hand in hand, we took our lives
And together stopped being

Raw models
Raw models

Raw models on a novel of ruin and misery
Raw models on a novel of ruin and misery
Raw models on a novel of ruin and misery
Raw models on a novel of ruin
