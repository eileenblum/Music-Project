Your veil came down for judgment day
What took to the skies, what took you away?
Tears run fast, and so did blood
But nothing could break through your ice, break through your ice

We're always close but never there.
What came from the skies to take you away?
Our children grew, left us behind
But no one should pay such a price

Just another day and they're all the same
In this world of the next
You bring me down and I resurrect
In this world of the next

Just another day and it's all the same
In this world of the next
You bring me down and I resurrect
In this world of the next

Watched us fall in a silent dive
Watch our love die...

Just another day and they're all the same
In this world of the next
You bring me down and I resurrect
In this world of the next

Just another day and it's all the same
In this world of the next
You bring me down and I resurrect
In this world of the next

In this world of the next [4x]
