[Verse]
Canât you see that the curtain has fallen between us?
And that the statues of leaders
Keep smashing on the burning floor
The sunset is rolling
Behind the mountain's dying peak
Our life has no meaning, the world forgot about me

[Chorus]
Weâre dying,
Weâre falling
Weâre crawling
We're disappearing
Weâre trying
Defining
Our sense of right and wrong
As a dying breed
As a thing from the past
Weâre a dying breed

[Verse 2]
Canât you see that the magic is over? Has it ever started?
And how the music we listen keeps fading, sheâs lost control
The new tribes they gather around the Earthâs dying core
The new ways are wining, no place for me anymore

[Chorus]
Weâre dying,
Weâre falling
Weâre crawling
We're disappearing
Weâre trying
Defining
Our place
In the natural order
As a dying breed
Just a dying breed

Weâre a dying breed
We're a thing from the past
Just a dying breed

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Weâre dying,
Weâre falling
Weâre crawling
We're disappearing
Weâre trying,
Defining,
Our sense of right and wrong

Weâre dying, escaping, still falling,
We're disappearing
Weâre trying, defining,
Our place in the natural order
As a dying breed,
Just a dying breed
Weâre a dying breed,
Weâre a thing from the past
Weâre a dying breed,
Just a dying breed
Just a dying breed!
