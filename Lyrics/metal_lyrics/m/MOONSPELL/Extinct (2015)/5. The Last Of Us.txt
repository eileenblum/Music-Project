Let me guide you to where it's silent
Across the limit of survivor's guilt
The crowds are waiting,
The sigh was taken
By the burning sun
We're moving on the straight line into depths unknown

My curse is to love you
Until we see the last of us
No chance of surrender
Nothing but eternity

My curse is to love you
Until we see the last of us
No chance of surrender
Before we fight our destiny

Let me touch you where it's forbidden
And test the limit of your sanctity
The crowd suspended
They have stripped naked for the lust of god
The fire burns as if there's no tomorrow, no tomorrow

You know my heart will fail
You know my back will break
And again and again
It won't hurt just for you to reveal my pain

My curse is to love you
Until we see the last of us
My terms of surrender
Nothing but eternity

My curse is to love you
Until we see the last of us
No chance of surrender
Before we fight our destiny

Black magic, unconditional love
Black magic unconditional
Black magic, unconditional lust
Black magic irresistible
