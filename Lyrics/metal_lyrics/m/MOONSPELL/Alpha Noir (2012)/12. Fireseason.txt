Where, where is everyone gone tonight?
Looking behind to seek for forgiveness
Try, you can never stop to try
Life doesn't wait and time runs too tight sometimes

Fire... Season
Fire... Too much is forbidden
Desire... To enter the season
Of fire... Too much is forbidden
Taken away

Where, where is everyone gone to hide?
Taking it back as if you're not real
Cry, you can never stop to cry
Nothing was left, not a shred of life tonight

Fire... Season
Fire... Too much is forbidden
Desire... To enter the season
Of fire... Too much is forbidden
Taken away in the night
