[Start of bonus disc "Omega White"]

It's when we fall down on our knees to suck the mouth of each other
It's when life's so precious that every moment hurts
That I fear for myself

From the trees our bodies, swaying
Once we were the lovers, engaging below them
Indifferent...

Now it's the world that went on
There was no time to be strong
Now it's the world that went on
Indifferent to us

It's when you invade me again
In our judgment day we won't be together
Our time has come
Again I fear for myself

From the trees our bodies, swaying
Once we were the lovers, engaging below them
Indifferent...

Now it's the world that went on
There was no time to be strong
Now it's the world that went on
Indifferent to us
