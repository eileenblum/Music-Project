I am thinking vultures ripping the flesh,
Smashing the bone
I am thinking hailstones shot to the head,
Making the giant fall
I am hearing pipes, the pipes of Pan,
I know itâs wrong
I am hearing lies, the lies of man:
Theyâre written in the stars above!

So crawl back to your hole!
Wait for thy kingdom come
So crawl back to your hole!
Tonight no one will come

The fire canât tame us
Weâre not making peace
And haters canât break us
Weâre growing fierce

In the end of times, no prophecy just you and me
In the end of times, the thrill of the flight
I am here to take your life

I am thinking snake oil rubbed in the skin
Enter the poison!
I am thinking arrows stuck in the heart
All men are mortal
I am biting the apple, the rotten core
The worm wants more
I am healing the blind, the book of the dead
Be prepared to meet your end!
