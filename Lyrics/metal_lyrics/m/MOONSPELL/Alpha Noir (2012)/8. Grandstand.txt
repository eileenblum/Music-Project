So many stars above our heads and yet we choose to starve
So many stones out there to turn and yet we choose to ignore
Thousands I wish to corrupt, their sons I seek to mislead
Damned forever be your dreams, I reject my destiny

To see what hides behind the mask
To live, to lust and make it last
To take the grandstand on the top of the world
And scream the truth: what does not kill, hurts us

So many ways out there to thread and yet we choose to turn back
So many choices we could have made and yet we choose to kneel down
Thousands I wish to corrupt, their sons I seek to mislead
Damned forever be your dreams, I reject my destiny

To see what hides behind the mask
To live, to lust and make it last
To take the grandstand on the top of the world
And scream the truth: what does not kill, hurts us.
