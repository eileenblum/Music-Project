Red meat is the inner shrine of our immortal soul
The heart breaking out illusions of innocent blood
Desire is pain
Eating away the worm in the brain

Our flesh burns in mysterious ways

Gray matter is the unholy clay of our address on Earth
Frontiers are coming down between body and the soul
Abrasive, insane
Putting away the spark in the brain

Our flesh works in mysterious ways
Our flesh burns in mysterious ways.
