In your thoughts

âBehold the bridegroom cometh
In the middle of the nightâ
Behold the rats who follow him
Why do they want our destruction?

Do broken men still sail in your blade
Are your bravest still afraid
Now itâs the womb that chases the seed
Now itâs the time of the need
Of hunger and revolt
Inverting our thoughts

Forever hold
Forever sworn
Forever mine

Itâs the time to know, itâs the time to see!
Love is blasphemy

In your thoughts

Behold the gloom bride coming
Riding the tail of the star
Beware the scum who follows her
Now itâs the time of the kill.
