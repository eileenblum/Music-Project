Opium, desire or will?
Inspiration bound from an elegant seed
Subversion, through smoke I foresee
Erotic motions of lesser gods in ecstasy

Opium, bring me forth another dream
Spawn worlds of flesh and red,
little jewels of atrocity
Opium, I sleep in debauchery
And burn with you
when you burn in Me

Opium, we fantasise
as we fuse with your root
You are a strange flower,
we are your strangest fruit

Opium, it burns in me and you
Opium, it burns for me and for you

"Por isso eu tomo Ã³pio. Ã um remÃ©dio
Sou um convalescente do Momento.
Moro no rÃ©s-do-chÃ£o do pensamento
E ver passar a Vida faz-me tÃ©dio."
