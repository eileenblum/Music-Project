Mother Tongue speaks to Me
In the strangest way I've ever seen
I know that she sees in Me
Her proudest child, her purest breed

She speaks to Me in colour
That I can't really understand
I only know that they are ours
And to those I'll proudly bend

For I am your only child
And you my dearest mystery
From an ancient throne I defy the world
To kneel before the Power within

For I am your only child
And you my dearest mystery
World can't you see it?
Am I alone in my belief?

Virando costas ao Mundo
Orgulhosamente sÃÂ³s
Gloria Antiga, volta a nos!
ALMA MATER!

Breaking waves announce my bride
It is the only way the Sea could sing
Legends of Lusitanian pride
He sings the words I can not spring

At the Moon Mountain six wolves cry
Your lost glory we'll regain or die

For I am your only child
And you my dearest mystery
Pagan Gods in conspiracy
For the sword of Tyranny

Mother Tongue speaks to Me
In the strangest way I've ever seen
World can't you see?
Am I alone in my belief?
ALMA MATER!

Virando costas ao Mundo
Orgulhosamente sÃÂ³s
Gloria Antiga, volta a nos!
ALMA MATER!
