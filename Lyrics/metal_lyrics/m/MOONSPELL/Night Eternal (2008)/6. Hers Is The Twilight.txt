From shadow born
Not a single reason
To go on
Darker days ahead
We forgot about
When too far gone

In her twilight time
Testimony of skin
A ghost in the rain
Cursing us by
In her twilight time

From shadow bound
What's left of life?
Remains of the earth
That once we called home
But our hands expired

In her twilight time
Testimony of skin
A ghost in the rain
Cursing us by
Hers is the twilight

From shadows torn
We know it's too late
Darker days arrived
Our times of plague

In her twilight time
Testimony of skin
A ghost in the rain
Cursing us by
Hers is the twilight

The scars of the earth
Won't heal with light
These are twilight times
These are scars of mine
