They thought that love was sacred
Until they met the desecrator
A sea of poison came in between them
And there was red on the ground below

They can not breed
Bound to never rise
Their lies will be repeated
Forever

Now they're dreamless
Straight into the dark clouds
Never to come back

They thought there's more
Than meets the eye
In face of beauty all men are blind
And the gates opened to let her through

They can not breed
Lost in the crimson skies
The nights in our heats
Will last forever

Now they're dreamless
Straight into the dark clouds
Never to come back

Now they're dreamless
Forever
