Vanishing act inside the weak
In need of you and all what's real
Spirited into our lost ways

In solitudes to follow
Across the land departed on sea
We will be living our last days

Remember!

Once it was ours
We have waited forever
We are to blame
For once it was ours

We are a revolution strong inside the weak
The anguish of the all to be
Lost forever into your unique ways

In telling blood decisions stay
Keep the light strong for me
My darkest hour ahead it lays

Remember!

Once it was ours
We have waited forever
We are to blame
For once it was ours

It's a resolution! Our destination shall be ours again
It's a resolution! And it's coming our way...

Remember all that you see
Could ever feel
Once it was final
Once it was all...

Remember!
Once it was ours
We have waited forever
We are to blame
For once it was ours

Remember- we are living our lost days

Once it was ours!
