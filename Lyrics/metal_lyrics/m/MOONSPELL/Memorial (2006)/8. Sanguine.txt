Find me with the howling
In the night I will be waiting under
Remember how cold the touch
When you fall with another

Approaching the eternal day

The everlasting nothing between us
The everlasting nothing around us

Returning in your other shape
At midnight the failing wonder
Remember there can be only one
We the trophy of each other

Sanguine - you love comes to me in oceans of blood

Find me with the holing
In the night I am going under
Remember how cold the touch
You have fallen with another

Leave me by the fading
Silenced in the trust
Remember how cold the truth
When we breed one another

Sanguine - your love comes to me in oceans of blood

The everlasting ignorance around us, forever living sickness inside us
The silence still not finished with us, the madness breeding when we do
For you I will cut my veins open and let you hide on them
For you I will cut my veins open, let you live freely on them

Sanguine - your love comes to me in oceans of blood
