In my blood you reached this far
In my soul you found this much
The circles of hell on earth
Traveled together times upon times

When you have lived this cruel
And emptied the veins once full
Bloodlines of life going back in your hands
Bloodlines of life in return to the past

Blood tells. Memorial

Now you have gone too far
Now you have found too much
The circles of blood completed
As it was once for the last

Now we have lived this full
Still we have nothing at all
From the line of the life we fall
In the shifting sands of the heart

Blood tells. Memorial
T put together the words
To bring together our worlds
To be together the curse
To live together our horrors

Now we have lived this full
Always we had nothing to prove!
What the soul hides. Blood tells!

Now we have lived this full
To you we have nothing to prove!
What the soul hides. Blood tells!

Memorial.
