The earth should have opened
And swallowed us in
Stop at nothing inside us
Then a wind should have risen
From the deep mouth of our sea
And things should have been as they used to be

There is a doorway, a running sea inside of me
There is a calling inside of me, flowing from me
Inside of me (the)

Atlantic

Last call
Last hope for the last of the creed
Last call. Doorway
Your waters will spread inside me

The earth should have opened
And swallowed us in
Stop at nothing inside us
And when we meet again
The mountain I will be
Casting my shadow over your seas

There is a doorway. A running sea inside of me
There is a calling inside of me. Flowing from me
Inside of me (the)

Atlantic

Last call
Last hope for the last of the creed
Last call. Doorway
Your waters will spread inside me

"I am water turned blood
I am fury turned hope."
(The) Atlantic

Last call
Last hope for the last of the creed
Last call. Doorway
Your waters will spread inside me
