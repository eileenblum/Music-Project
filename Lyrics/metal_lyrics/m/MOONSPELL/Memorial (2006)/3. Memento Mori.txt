I am the moment, the soul
The moment that ends it all
I am the second, the will
The serpent, the one you last recall

The living pulse of nightmares
Is on my side
With the shadows I fade into you

A secret promise of leaving
Blanking you eyes
When you look for me try for once inside

In the sleep of cruelty
The old sounds of you and me

I am the moment, the soul
The moment that ends it all
I am the second, the will
The serpent, the one you last recall (you are lost)

The ones so long forgotten
Now at your side
Their spirits travel from me into you

A rush of waters then after life
The wind in the trees
Yours is the fighting this minute dark
I am the moment, the soul

The moment that ends it all
I am the second the will
The serpent, the one you last

In the sleep of cruelty
The old sounds of you in me

And for a moment it's gone
The beauty of it all
I am the second the fall
The logic of it all

I am the moment, the soul
The moment that ends it all
I am the second, the will
I am the serpent, the one you last recall
