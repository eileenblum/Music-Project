Whatever haunts me from birth on
Is leaking white blood again
It is sickening my heart
While I divide yours in two

Lustmord- (I will) never stop to hurt you
Lustmord- (I will) never stop to love you

I will never stop to hurt you
Now that I have you with me
So close together in one body

I feel so safe but what about you ?

The soft, sweet wound of normalcy
Is sweating white blood again
I am fingering every inch of it
Grateful for who I am

You're my interruption
My crossroad of just one way
My object without a function
But so mine anyway

Unpredictable- when I kiss it burns
Irresistible- as a crowd of only one
I am so addicted and you are so down
You are nailed forever to my sense of lust

Lustmord- (I will) never want to stop you
Lustmord- (I will) never try to stop you
