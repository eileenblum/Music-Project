Opium, desire or will?
Inspiration bound from an elegant seed
Subversion, through smoke I foresee
Erotic motions of lesser gods in ecstasy

Opium, bring me forth another dream
Spawn worlds of flesh and red,
Little jewels of atrocity
Opium, I sleep in debauchery
And burn with you
When you burn in Me

Opium, we fantasize
As we fuse with your root
You are a strange flower,
we are your strangest fruit

Opium, it burns in me and you
Opium, it burns for me and for you

"Por isso eu tomo opio. Ã© um remÃ©dio.
Sou um convalescente do Momento.
Moro no rÃ©s do chÃ£o do Pensamento
E ver passar a vida faz-me tÃ©dio."
