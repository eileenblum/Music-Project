Bleed no reflection
Upon the waters that you fear
Make things happen

Accept no resignation
For some life has been cruel
You have set the mood

Thinking about you... Luna..Luna..Luna

Lay the serpent's egg
In this world of make believe
And make things real

My seed of a lunacy
Was a sign made to resist
A mood set from birth

Thinking about you... Luna..Luna..Luna

Show me your moon burns
Take me as the moon burns
The freezing moon
Making things real for me
The killing Moon
Making things happen for me

Luna..Luna..Luna
Luna - all above
Wound of light in the enemy skies
Make things happen for me

On the eve of self destruction
On the eve of all can be...Thinking about you
