Go down to the streets, burn their egos down,
Why should I follow the blind?
Black hole, just fall away,
Black hole, separate from this circle,
Save me from this vicious world,
Searching for a better life,
Crawling and crawling, roll the dice,
Try to find way in this world, with an open eye,
Control of your mind, power and soul,
Donât let the fools be in control,
Donât sell your soul for any control,
Black hole, just fall away.
