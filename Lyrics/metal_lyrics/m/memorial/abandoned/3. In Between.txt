Sometimes itâs hard to see,
When hearts that never feel, whatâs there between two sides of holes that hard to trust?
How long does it takes for us to realize the real meaning of it,
Or it just a phase of life that will forever runs in our minds,
Hollow means,
Just a shallow mind that will make you understand,
Will never last too long,
Try to hide away as if someone was looking,
When bells took it tolls,
Thereâs a time for us to part away,
Please go away from this heart and souls
Because itâs too hard too hold.
