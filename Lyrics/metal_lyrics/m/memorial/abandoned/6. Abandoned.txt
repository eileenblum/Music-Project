Living through this lifeless world,
Fear keeps on longing me,
Canât stop thinking,
Canât react with anything, these moments
I canât avoid,
Keep pushing little lower,
Nothing could ever stop this hope,
The life
Iâve been yearning for,
If I could not see what is living under,
And it means nothing last forever,
Years in shambles,
Iâll walk away,
Where should
I lay this emotions of mine?
Where should
I place this gloomy inside?
Killing from the inside,
Passes through emotions,
Will it ever stop, will it ever end.
