Gemini had turned to dust,
AM forever gone away from this life,
January you left me dying on my own,
Rendering the memories of you,
I am trembling and falling along,
Hardest way to live like normal way before, your miles ahead and Iâm lost,
The big H in your heart is the reason of all,
I see a side I never thought Iâd see,
I canât believe what my eyes have seen,
Memories is memories are,
Meaningless to you,
I wrote a song to convey the soreness in me,
Iâm not sure if Iâm on the right way,
To bring the life down on me,
If I could turn back the period of time,
Will it be the same?
Gemini,
December, AM.
The reason for me to get through the day,
Are the memories of you and me.
