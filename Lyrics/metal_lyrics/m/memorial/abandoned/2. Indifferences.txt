Differences that you bring,
The thoughts that you shared, blast the whole matter,
Different story everywhere,
Pointless, totally depraved,
Regardless of how you point the words that you said,
Why you have to spread something that worthless?
Come to reality; fuck what you've shared,
As day-long shade gave way to months of midnight sun,
Impact begin to light up the whole group,
Your thoughts, your conclusion,
Against all the sensitivity,
Could it turn to something bad,
Will it affect the whole faction,
The world is just a transitory,
And it wonât last too long,
Now what are you going to trust,
Evermore nothing could change the truth.
