Unspoken words,
I fucking hate the feeling that keeps on haunting me;
I canât take any more of this mind game,
FUCK!
Iâm not reborn for nothing,
Taste of this lifeless way,
No more any shapes of sadness; letâs go to a place that can set our minds free.
Free from all the poisons,
Burn all the sorrow,
Killing the confusion,
Envision, leaving the agony, whatâs left for us to seize,
Foresee a greater life ahead.
