Down we go through the day,
Finding the worthy things that can keep us stirring,
Everyday we keep on trying to generate the different,
From what we had in past,
For us to run this life free,
What we need from this life,
All thatâs left to see,
Repeating the same shits,
Its time to look onto the ground,
This sure will burn all the desire
Divine day, divine way all are yours to see,
Weâve tried so hard, to give the best, all are yours to think,
Divine day, divine way all are yours to feel,
For the path that will prevail the divines value of life,
At all you whispered,
I will still be alive and you can watch me,
Fucking burst in your way,
Ainât the way,
It was supposed to be,
The rises of the power are spread in me,
Ainât the way,
It was supposed to be.
