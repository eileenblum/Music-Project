One foot deep, I shall sink myself,
No money, no gold, no treasure to hold,
No where to go, no people I know,
There's no place I can call my home,
Poverty you say is nothing to me,
Abundant of joy is what completes me,
No money, no gold, no treasure to hold,
Beat me till I bleed, break me till I'm weak,
But nothing shall change, It remains the same,
Beat me till I bleed, break me till I'm weak
