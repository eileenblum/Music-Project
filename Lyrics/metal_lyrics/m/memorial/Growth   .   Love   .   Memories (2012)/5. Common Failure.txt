Counting days, counting blessings,
Nothing yet succeed,
Sick in the head,
New hopes that I can't cope,
No voice that came to help,
Keep digging,
What's left for me,
Nothing has changed, can't seem to ease my mind,
From all those distractions, all I taste now is regret,
I will try to stand on my own,
I will always be on my fucking own.
