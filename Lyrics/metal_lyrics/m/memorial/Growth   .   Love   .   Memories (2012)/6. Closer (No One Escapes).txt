From bright to dark, I see myself rise and fall,
I console myself, from all that surrounds me,
With light and life that god gave me,
Awake my soul,
Forgive me, the sin of a sinner where should I go,
No sympathy, no empathy, just guilt in me,
Lost concious, lost directions,
Bring me back to life, before it's too late, too late at all,
console myself, from all that surrounds me,
With light and life that god gave me,
Awake my soul.
