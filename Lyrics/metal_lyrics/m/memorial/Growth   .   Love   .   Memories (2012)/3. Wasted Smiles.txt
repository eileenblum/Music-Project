Can't see no more, what's left for me,
I only trust what I've seen, burn the love,
That has lost it's way, show me the exit path,
I wanna go miles away,
Learn to live,
Learn to love,
Learn to let go,
Live, Love, Let go,
Another day come and go, trying hard to let it go,
Mind abandoned, abused in years, new beginning,
No more shed of tears.
