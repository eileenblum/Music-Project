My mind is growing, as I keep crawling,
Keep crawling, through the edge of the world,
Keep finding myself, and nothing more to just prove my word,
I used to think, this life was just to short for me,
No one awaits me,
Keep crawling and sailing through this path,
Nothing can stop me,
Never let the history,
Reshits and repeats,
Crucially twisted,
Cruelly treated,
Mentally wasted,
Motions distorted,
Crucially twisted,
Cruelly treated,
Nothing can stop me.
