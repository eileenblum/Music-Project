Sinking in the ocean of emotions,
slowly slips away from the patience I hold,
unfold the stories that cannot be told,
just lost without a soul,
all I can feel, no heart can take too long,
no more of your face tonight,
so hard to find the one, that can be the only one,
these feelings full of rage,
let it go, I'm in a better place,
no more love that can be replace,
no more sad songs that left to sing,,
all I can feel, no heart can take too long,
no more of your face tonight,
so hard to find the one, that can be the only one,
What's left is pain and disgrace,
no more of your face tonight.
