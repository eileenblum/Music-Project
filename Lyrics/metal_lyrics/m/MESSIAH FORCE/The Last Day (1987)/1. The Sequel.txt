Planes in the sky
Sounds like a war cry
Feeling scared at that sight
They're singing for the fight
Feeling scared at that sight
You could never wake up
From that nightmare
From that nightmare

No more tears to cry
No more screams to free yourself
Daily terror has called
Sequel of the war

You just can't forget that child
With so much hate in his eyes
So much hate in the heart
Obeying to the command and killing 
So much hate in his heart
Making the world war his own
World war his own

No more tears to cry
No more screams to free yourself
Daily terror has called
Sequel of the war

Little killer, ten years old
Holding the war weapon like a toy
Little valiant warrior
Looking at his murderess wound
Like looking at any sores of games

Maybe god has forgiven you
But you could never wake up
You could never forget
His falling body
Taking ruins of war for grave
Maybe god has forgiven you
But you could never wake up
From that nightmare
From that nightmare

No more tears to cry
No more screams to free yourself
Daily terror has called
Sequel of the war
