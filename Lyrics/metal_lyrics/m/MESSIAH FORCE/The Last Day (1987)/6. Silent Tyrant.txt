"I have the conviction that the opposite
 of love isn't hate...but indifference"

You know the typical case
About a man with a bad style of life
Who when he was young
Undergrew with a drunken father
Oppressed mother, depressed mother
No money to go out
Being at home was being in hell
Anyway, who cares?

Of course that man is there
But don't you see your friend
Who's crying?
And who's gonna care if it's not you?

Don't need your love
Silent tyrant
No affection
Just don't be indifferent

For jack it's not like that
All was perfect in his family
He could have been a president
He could have been a tyrant
But he became a public trash
He had no excuses to turn off like that
Finally nobody loves him
But anyway, who cares?

Of course that man is there
But don't you see your friend
Who's crying?
And who's gonna care if it's not you?

Don't need your love
Silent tyrant
No affection
Just don't be indifferent
