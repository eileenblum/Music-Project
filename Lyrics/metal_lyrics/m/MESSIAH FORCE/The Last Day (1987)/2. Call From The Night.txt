When the wind is gonna blow stronger
You will know it's the call of the darkness prince
If you have a bloody taste in your mouth
You'll be arriving in the destination of the losers

Call from the depth of the night
Tearing the silence of the darkness
Call from the depth of the night

Like a starving beast
He's gonna suck your blood
And push you in your eternal grave
That's your fate for sure
If you answer that dismal call

Can you hear
The bells of death?
Can you hear
Can you hear
Can you hear him
Rejoicing when you take
The easy way to hell?
Can you hear
The bells of the final breath?
Can you hear
Can you hear
Can you hear him
Disclosing you all the violence and
Evil you could be?

When the wind is gonna blow stronger
You will know it's the call of the darkness prince
If you have a bloody taste in your mouth
You'll be arriving at the destination of the losers

Call from the depth of the night
Tearing the silence of the darkness
Call from the depth of the night
