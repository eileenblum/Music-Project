"Betray your god and hell you will pay"

The light is going down
On the mutineers of the city
The smell of death under the sky
Out of the time
Frost in the brain and the soul
They search for trueness in the lies

Why do you want vengeance?
Is it what you called
To love your neighbor like yourself?
You wanted them to perish
By your sword
But they lost the right way home

The last day was today
And I saw millions of frozen eyes 
Facing the ground for eternity
The light of the sun died out
On the mutineers of the city
Killing the ones
That god didn't select
No more burnin' lovers
On that frozen sand
No more traces of life
On this abandoned land

The last day was today
And I saw millions of frozen eyes
Facing the ground for eternity

I'd rather die in his lap
Instead of being alone
Sharing his tragic end
Rather than to leave alone

No more burnin' lovers
On that frozen sand
No more traces of life
On this abandoned land

The last day was today
And I saw millions of frozen eyes
Facing the ground for eternity...
