Snowing on the purgatory
The people are worse than ever
Angels don't ever come down here
Snowing on the purgatory
Don't call god for some help
He won't come, he won't come at all

Snowing all over my town
The lost ewes are everywhere
On my ground
The fire of hell
Never seems to die out
Snowing all over my town
Don't want to perish like a damned
With my memory lost across the time

White night
Cold white night
I'm freezing in my heart
In my head
Cold white night

I want to break out
Of my slave chains
Open out a way
Among the brambles and the thorns
To follow the golden dove
Telling back what she had said
Doing back what she had done
Flying like she flew, flying as high

White night
Cold white night
I'm freezing in my heart
In my head
Cold white night

Flying as high so that everybody
Can hear my bird cry
I want to fly as high
So that everywhere
My bird feathers can be seen

But that high, it's not enough high
Cannons and swords
Among a child's cry
Is all I can hear

Turning round and round
The air is burning my eyes
My wings split the pollution
It's a hard nerve war

Snowing on the purgatory
The bird was just a bird
And I'm still here
Snowing all over my town
Just dreaming
Of that nuclear nightmare
On a white night
