You live in a cold dungeon
Alone with a desperate heart
Breathing the death
Like a hounded heart

Tomorrow is the final curtain
Of the hero's saga
The last day of tortures
Just too bad...You can't come out

See your life all over
On the screen of your mind
Like a movie
In which you play the first part

Tomorrow is the final curtain
Of the hero's saga
The last day of tortures
Just too bad...You can't come out

You can't believe it, but
When you rejoined the line
Of the warriors
They all promised you
A bright future
And you believed it
And tomorrow the hero
You were supposed to be
Will be finished like the worst
Of the worst

At dawn you get up
On the stage of your death
And the rope like a spotlight
Makes you the star
Of that horror show

Tomorrow is the final curtain
Of the hero's saga
The last day of tortures
Just too bad...You can't come out
