Appearing in the darkness
In a shattering rumbling
The visions of heaven's king
No smile on his face
No mercy in his eyes
He told me that my time was done
Follow him was what I had to do
But I ran away

Spirit killer
Spirit killer
At any time, at any price
I'll be yours but let me live

With a witch's move
He made a spirit
Springing up
From the heavenly ocean
He brought that killer
On my back
To pursue his purpose
No rest for me 'cause the traps
Of that killer are everywhere

Spirit killer
Spirit killer
At any time, at any price
I'll be yours but let me live

I'll give you all my life
That's the best I can do
My life may not be enough
But I'll pay it
With my credit to paradise
If you don't give me my life
Then I'll die and you'll see
What I'm able to do
With my force
I'll destroy your world
And you'll see
That I wanted to live. Wanted

Spirit killer
Spirit killer
At any time, at any price
I'll be yours but let me live
