"Nothing is ever for always
...You better watch out!"

Look here little boy
Can you believe
That someday you could
Leave your toys
To kill the innocent?

You better watch out
'cause you, boy
Are born to be good
And die like a fool
Just like a fool

If the first bomb
Has missed your head
You've just been spared
But not for always saved

You better watch out
'cause some ones
Are born to be good  
And die like fools
Just like fools

No angel
Can save your life
When staring at his eyes
And see a tragic fate

You better watch out
'cause we all
Are born to be good
And die like fools
Just like fools

You run like you could be saved
But if you think about it
Your end is always a tragic fate
