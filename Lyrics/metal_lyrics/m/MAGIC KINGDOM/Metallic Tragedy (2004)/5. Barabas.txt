A life in the shadows, without fear you lived
A life without sorrow, you've been your own king
You didn't need an idol
The night was yours, you've killed
Another time is come, another lie is born

Barabas, Barabas your faith is your death
Barabas, Barabas your faith is your death

Far away from home, prisoners of eternity
Thousand dreams of freedom, visions of infinity
Your destiny was the cross
But you've been loved by God
Another crime is done, another life is gone

Barabas, Barabas your faith is your death
Barabas, Barabas your faith is your death
