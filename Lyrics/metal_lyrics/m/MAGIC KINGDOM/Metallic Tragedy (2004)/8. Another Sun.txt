Visions in my dreams
I see my past arise
A face in the night
I feel the beauty of love
Now,you're gone, you're so far
My pain is burning deep inside

Fly away, far away
Fly so far and touch the light of another sky
Another world, another Sun

I will never cry
we will meet again one more time
My heart will never die
Oh god,tell me the sense of our lives
Now, I'm lost in the dark
I want to touch your eternal paradise

Fly away, far away
Fly so far and touch the light of another sky
Another world, another Sun
