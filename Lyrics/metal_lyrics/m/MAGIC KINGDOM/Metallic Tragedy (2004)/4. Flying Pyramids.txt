Awaken by nightmares, tragedy's visions and cries
Out of the darkness,something is spying on the world
Forgotten secrets, government's lies
We will never know the truth, Area 51, Hangar 18
Hidden evidences of an invisible empire
We must be armed and ready, they will change our destiny
The sentence will be so hard, humanity will die

Flying pyramids, there are millions in the sky
Flying pyramids, see their power shoot the stars
They want our lands, they want to see us die

Lasers flash in the night, faster than the speed of light
Kindapping our people, destroying their brain by their works
Power of twilight, unknown mighty force
Now we have to face our fear, army's control towers hide the truth
Have they already visited us? Are they infiltrating our world?
We'll have to protect freedom and the human race
The judgement day's arriving, pray God we'll survive

Flying pyramids, there are millions in the sky
Flying pyramids, see their power shoot the stars
They want our lands, they want to see us die
