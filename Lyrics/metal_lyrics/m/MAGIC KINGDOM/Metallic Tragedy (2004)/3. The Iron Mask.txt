Alone in my cell
I am the prisoner of the king
My only friends are the distant stars
They protect my soul
I'm seeking the light in my lonely life
And I'm trying to stay alive
But one day I will get my revenge

Under the iron mask
I will survive, I'll never die
Under the iron mask
I will survive, I'll never, never die

I've been waiting for so long a time
Hidden in the shadows
My rage will give me the power
To find out the truth
I know my destiny's to be king
I must beat my brother's madness
And one day, evil will fall

Now I'm free and I see the light in my life
Wings of truth govern my reign
I saved my soul and I got my revenge

Under the iron mask
I will survive, I'll never die
Under the iron mask
I will survive, I'll never, never die

The Iron Mask!
