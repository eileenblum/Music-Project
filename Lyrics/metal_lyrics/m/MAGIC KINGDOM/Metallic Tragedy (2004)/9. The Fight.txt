Another day is rising and the sun begins to shine.
A thousand years is like a dust in the universe
Another century's coming, can we make a better world?
The time is running so fast, are we lost forever?

You must be strong enough to get your victory
You've got to cross the line and then you will be king

Fight for your life, you know you can die
Only the strong will survive
[Back vocals:] Strong will survive
Fight for your rights, stand up and be proud
Only the strong will survive in the thick of the fight
[Back vocals:] The strong will survive

You're standing there, asking God why you are so alone
There' s so many things that you can't even understand
Why do we live? You want an answer to this mystery
The endless wars are still there, we can't live together

You must be strong enough to get your victory
You've got to cross the line and then you will be king

Fight for your life, you know you can die
Only the strong will survive
[Back vocals:] Strong will survive
Fight for your rights, stand up and be proud
Only the strong will survive in the thick of the fight
[Back vocals:] The strong will survive
