It was a time of fear and hate
King's power was so cruel
It was so far, in the land of death
Only the strong survived
You've been suffering but you never cried
See the power of this holy light, ooh

Child, Child of the nile
Child, Child of the nile
This legend will live through the end of time

Hunting your fate, you've sought the beast
You've found the only truth
After the war, slavery was killed
You were the son of god
You've been suffering but you never cried
See the power of unholy lights

Child, Child of the nile
Child, Child of the nile
This legend will live through the end of time

Break the chains of misery with your hand
Guide this nation to the promised land, ooh

Child, Child of the nile
Child, Child of the nile
This legend will live through the end of time
