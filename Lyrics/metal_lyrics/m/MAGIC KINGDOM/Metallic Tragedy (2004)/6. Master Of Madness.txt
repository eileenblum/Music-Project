Mysteries of your life are hidden in the Ivory Tower
The science of your works defends our people and kingdom
You are the only one, chosen by angels and Gods
You know that something grows
Your visions revealed that a threat is coming soon
Master of Madness, leads the holy light
You keep the secret of the potion of the gods
Conquest by fire and rain of blood, hunting the shadows of the
Black Abyss, we pray, we sing in the circle of Eternal Lords

Master of madness, kings of the kings
Possessed by spells and your golden rings
After the darkness, the blood of the war
shall bring us the holy Throne

The fury is raging, the beast is seeking your treasures
The fortress is falling, tonight we won't break free from hell
The voice of Heaven calls, we will fight with the heart of the brave
We'll save our freedom, we'll get back the light
In the name of the timeless cross
Master of madness lives for the steel
Alchemy's fire, wisdom of the kings
After the storm and the holy war, army of darkness will fall again
We'll pray, we'll sing for the glory of the mighty Lords

Master of madness, kings of the kings
Possessed by spells and your golden rings
After the darkness, the blood of the war
shall bring us the holy throne
Master of Madness!
