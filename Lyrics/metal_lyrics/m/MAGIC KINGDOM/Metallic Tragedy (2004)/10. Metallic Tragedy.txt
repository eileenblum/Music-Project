[The Angel:] Ooh, I'm coming from heaven to wake up the king
and his knights,disaster is coming,be careful, Evil is rising
[The Demon:] After ten thousand centuries in the shadows of the valley
of Abaddon, the seventh gate of hell is open
My damned children will conquer this world and I'll be free
[The Witch:] Darkness's coming!
[The Knight:] I will defend
[The Witch:] My spell will kill
[The Knight:] Arrows will fly
[The Demon:] You're gonna cry
[The Angel:] Your time has come
[The Demon:] You're already dead
[The Knight:] You were a friend
[The Witch:] I was lying
[The Knight:] Deep in the heart of death; black abyss will never taste my 
blood and I will be glorious, I'll send you back into your infernal cage
[The Witch:] I am Tazira the witch and I will give you temptation
[The King:] I am the King Dragonson, I promise you death in this satanic war
The Witch, the Angel, the King, the Knight and the Demon

[The Demon:] Ridiculous soldier, chaos will rule
[The Witch:] Your God will fall!
[The Angel:] there's only one lord
[The King and the Knight:] Our faith is bigger,we're not afraid
Deep in the heart of war, Inferno will never have
my soul, and we'll be victorious,we'll send them
back into their infernal flames

[The Knight and the Angel:] And our sword will give you the law

We're lost in temptation, we want the glory
We'll see the fire, raise this cup of eternity
We are all damned souls, we've lost our liberty
We'll see the liars into this cup of victory
[The Knight:] Witch, you've open the gate, you will burn to clear your sins
and your crimes, ooh
[The Witch:] Oooh, I'm burning in the flames of Christ, my work is done
but like the phoenix I will rise again...
Oooh; light of truth's too strong, forgive my sins
[The King:] My son, Army of the Six Golden Towers is ready, guide these
warriors to victory
[The Demon:] King, you will die in your holy kingdom and you will
understand my eternal pain
[The Knight:] The war is beginning, the beast wants our soul
[The Angel:] Holy power will give you the strength to resist his lies
[The Witch:] I am back from death and the beast is my father
your golden defenders will kiss my flesh and drink my blood
[The King:] Knights of the Magic Kingdom, be proud and fight
The light must be back
[The Knight and the Angel and the King:]
Now we are victorious, we've sent them back to their infernal flames
Now, we see the light again, Legion of death disappeared
[The Demon and the Witch:] You'll see the baptism of fire when the
black dragon will rise from hell
The Witch, the Angel, the King, the Knight and the Demon
[The Demon and the Witch:]
This story will never end 'cause we are in you and we will be back
