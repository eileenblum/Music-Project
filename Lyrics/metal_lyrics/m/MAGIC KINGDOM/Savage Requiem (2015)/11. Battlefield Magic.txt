Winter's raging, winds are blowing
Something's coming from the North
In the castle of King Hagen, Hild his daughter sleeps
King Heoden loves the princess
Sends his minstrel to woo for him
This bewitching song
Brings her to escape in Wade's magic boat (giant of the sea)
Hagen pursues them, on the Hoy Island
In the Orkneys, wars began
Bloody battlefield, madness of two men
Shall so abide till Doomsday

Day after day, this curse goes on
No one could ever break this spell
Weapons and shields were turned into stone
Magic of the battlefield

Hild went by night to the corpses
She hid something in her hands
She awoke the dead by magic with the book of shadows
The next day the kings went to the battlefield and fought again
With all those who fell the day before forevermore
Fury of two kings, magic battlefield
Hjathningavig curse began
Neverending fight, dead awoke by spell
Shall so abide till Doomsday

Day after day, this curse goes on
No one could ever break this spell
Weapons and shields were turned into stone
Magic of the battlefield
