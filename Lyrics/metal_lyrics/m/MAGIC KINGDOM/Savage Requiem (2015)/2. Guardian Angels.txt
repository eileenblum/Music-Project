Do you ever feel a power hiding in your shadow?
Pushing you when all you want to do is giving up
I truly believe they hold my hand and rule my destiny
When I meet the darkness in my heart, they save my soul

Blinded by fear, I scream and cry
When I fall the unseen help me to fly

To guide, to lead, to protect my life
Guardian Angels are always on my side
To guide, to lead, to protect my life
Guardian Angels show me the sacred road

When I have to face my demons, they fight with me side by side
Struggling through the thorns of life, they show where harmony lies
Doubting, looking left and gazing right, the know the way of light
Bringers of balance and peace when chaos takes control

Angels, hear my prayers
Helpers since birth, until they bring me home

To guide, to lead, to protect my life
Guardian Angels are always on my side
To guide, to lead, to protect my life
Guardian Angels show me the sacred road

To guide, to lead, to protect my life
Guardian Angels are always on my side
To guide, to lead, to protect my life
Guardian Angels show me the sacred path
