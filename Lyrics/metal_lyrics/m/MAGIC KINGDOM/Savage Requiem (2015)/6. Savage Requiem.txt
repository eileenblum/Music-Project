I've always been a loner, a wild child
I never cared to play with fire
I rule my life and follow my heart
I never feared to stand out of the crowd
Do you believe you can make me doubt?
Your foolish brain dictates your closed mind
It's time to live, and roar like a lion
Before the cold shadows fall

I dedicate this song, this savage requiem
To every men on earth
To live this life with passion
The end could be so near
Death strikes when you can't see
For all my fallen ones
My requiem for life! Oh oh oh

I always faced my demons, my dark sides
I always fought till I vanquished my pains
But some scares stay, forever in my flesh
They're gone too soon
None can't change this fate
My frozen soul is empty and cries
This crown of thorns
We will all carry one day
This melody is my blood and tears
A prayer for the dead

I dedicate this song, this savage requiem
To every men on earth
To live this life with passion
The end could be so near
Death strikes when you can't see
For all my fallen ones
My requiem for life! Oh oh oh
