One man against all
One heart as brave as thousands
One battle for God
His country lost in fights

Cossacks are waiting
To strike on the Eastern border
One battle for love
And save his precious one

Winged hussars charge
Doing through enemies spears
Riding on for the holy victory

Hundreds knight will fall
In a desperate cry they'll die
For the land,
For the crown,
For the glory

Marching on
Never give up
Enraged lord
Always fighting with fire and sword
Marching out
No surrender
Storming force
Always fighting with fire and sword
With fire and sword

Sent by the prince to spy
As messenger he's captured
But the hetman buys him
'Cause he once saved his life

Powerless he sees
The Polish troops' first defeat
Sadness in his eyes
Will he see her again?

After the king's death
Chaos reigns in southern side
But the fury of the prince unleashes war

Hundred fifty years
Those two brother nations fought
For the blood,
For the Christ,
For the honor!

Marching on
Never give up
Enraged lord
Always fighting with fire and sword
Marching out
No surrender
Storming force
Always fighting with fire and sword, yeah
With fire and sword

Marching on
Never give up
Enraged lord
Always fighting with fire and sword
Marching out
No surrender
Storming force
Always fighting with fire and sword
With fire and sword

With fire and sword
With fire and sword
