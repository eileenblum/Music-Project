Every year all northmen sail
To the mysterious death island
For a week they eat and drink
Celebrating Odin's name.

Singing Thor, The Thunder God, for he blesses this pagan feast.
"Hear our plead and bring us hope, food in winter, water on the fields.
The chosen one will give his heart, his soul will fly into Valhalla.
Take this man as holy gift, we'll do all to please our lords."

Ancient full moon sacrifice,
Feeding gods with precious lives.

Bless us with this sacred rite

He accepts his destiny with a valiant heart
He'll die scared but grateful
His blood will flow, clearing all his people sins
The red river is guiding home to the majestic eternal hall.

He will soon be with his father and every fallen warrior.
His family proud, the enemies envy.
"We praise and honor his life that has been.
Gods, bless our lands, conquests and lives,
Protect the seas and the vikings ways."

"The chosen one gave him his life, bravest of all, he enlightened our fate.
The light of the moon showed him the way.
His soul is now into Valhalla."
