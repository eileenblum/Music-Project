Look at the beauty of this earth
The blue sky and the waterfalls
Where everyone should live in peace and without fear
But chaos starts his evil work
A battle for faith they would die
My life is worth more than a lie

Darkness falls, evil's attempts will look so divine
Take your stand against the devil's plan
See behind the mask

Four Demon Kings of Shadowlands
Four Demon Kings of Apocalypse
Terrorizing nations
In the name of the Unholy
They don't belong to the Kingdom of God
Turning the realm in a dark world
Four Demon Kings
Four Demon Kings of Shadowlands

Spiritual promises make you blind
You're so lost
You think you rule the world
Coz beauty fears the shadows
Four Prophets of Lies have been sent
Four Fallen Angels will torment
and haunt you till you change your mind

Mothers cry, precious sons
Forever gone and doomed
Their souls will fade in the flames of hell
Truth will conquer
