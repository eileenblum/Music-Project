Born on the same ground
We were friends and brothers in arms
Faces in the mud
We survived war and pain
But one day you dared to cross the line
And everything changed
You've played with fire
Now you will have to pay

When the sun goes down, I'll avenge my crown
Swords are gonna clash, blood has to flow
In a duel we will fight, our blades will cross
Only God knows our destiny

Rivals forever, sworn enemy, a fight for life
We're rivals forever
Someday one of us has to die
Rivals forever!

No turning back, you went too far
You're trapped in your madness
This wicked game you play will strike back at you
Poisoned words come out of your mouth
You're out of your mind
You're just a loser without any respect

No one steals my pride
For honor I will stride
In the shadows of your lies
As a snake you hide
Victory is mine
Truth will be revealed
There's nothing you can do, nowhere to run

Rivals forever, sworn enemy, a fight for life
We're rivals forever
Someday one of us has to die
Rivals forever!

When the sun goes down, I'll avenge my crown
Swords are gonna clash, blood has to flow
In a duel we will fight, our blades will cross
Only God knows our destiny

Rivals forever, sworn enemy, a fight for life
We're rivals forever
Someday one of us has to die
Rivals forever!
