Floating dungeon on the sea
Trading men and slavery
Deadly vessel, full of sins
Did you steal my human rights?
I don't wanna be on this boat
I just want my freedom
I don't need this brave new world
I don't wanna be exploited
For rum or for cotton
I just want out o this hell!

Welcome to the Ship of Ghosts
Final haven of our soul
Join the circle and dance with the dead
They are still deep in my heart
One day I'll find peace of mind
When I'll dance on the ship with the ghosts

Can you hear our desperate voices?
White men only care for gold
Insurrection always failed
Rebels tortured sentenced to death
Brothers stand up with resistance
Don't belong to these merchants
With our bare hands we must fight
Millions of souls are transported
Across the endless ocean
Rather die than live this way!

Welcome to the Ship of Ghosts
Final haven of our soul
Join the circle and dance with the dead
They are still deep in my heart
One day I'll find peace of mind
When I'll dance on the ship with the ghosts
