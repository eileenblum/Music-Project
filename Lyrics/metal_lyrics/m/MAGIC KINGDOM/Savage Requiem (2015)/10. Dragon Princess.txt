The day she came into my life
I emerged from the dark
I saw an angel from the skies
A beauty never seen before
She got my heart at first sight
Her breath of fire resurrected my soul
I was so blind, agonizing
I've been dying, bleeding
Till she healed my wounds

She is my world
She saved my life
My dragon princess opens the gates
of a brave new world
Flying high above the clouds
I leave all shadows from the past
For the very first time I know what love is

Bound in an infinity sign
This magic can't escape
We'll be one forevermore
No more crying
No more torments
My soul is complete
I'm now a new man free from sins

She is my world
She saved my life
My dragon princess opens the gates
of a brave new world
Flying high above the clouds
I leave all shadows from the past
For the very first time I know what love is
