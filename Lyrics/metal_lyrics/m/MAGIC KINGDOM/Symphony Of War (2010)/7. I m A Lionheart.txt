I'm a warrior lord, I'm a lionheart
I will raise my sword 'til the day I die
For the kingdom's throne, we will fight as one
I'm a lionheart

I will bring you to victory; my brave and glorious knights
I'm a king; I'm a lionheart
All demons will fall as we swing our sword
I'm a king; I'm a lionheart
Ready to fight and die for the warrior lord
We will reach eternity
Show no fear in the flames of my holy war
For the Kingdom's eternal survival

I'm a warrior lord, I'm a lionheart
I will raise my sword til the day I die
For the kingdom's throne, we will fight as one
I'm a lionheart

In the evil's den, we will kill them all
I'm a king; I'm a lionheart
When the prophet dies, I hear the dungeon's call
I'm a king, I'm a lionheart
We will never give up, we'll be forever free
We will never give our land
Show no fear in the name of your overlord
For the kingdom's eternal glory

I'm a warrior lord, I'm a lionheart
I will raise my sword 'til the day I die
For the kingdom's throne, we will fight as one
I'm a lionheart

I'm a warrior lord, I'm a lionheart
I will raise my sword 'til the day I die
For the kingdom's throne, we will fight as one
I'm a lionheart
