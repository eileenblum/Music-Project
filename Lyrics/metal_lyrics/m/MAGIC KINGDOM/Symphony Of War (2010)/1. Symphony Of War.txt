The night is falling and it's time to reach the final battleground
The magic kingdom has to see the light again
After the war, after the storm, we want to see the children's joy
And I will fight 'til I see hope in their eyes
We will be the masters of the skies
We will be the iron fist of god with the mightiest fire of dragons
Hear my freedom's call, face your destiny,
All for one and one for all

Under the reign of the fire god,
Ruling the world with the lord of wars
Fighting the evil and justice for all
I'm leading the horde of doom
Fire god's attack, hunting demons in the dark
Mighty holy flames; It's a symphony of war

Unholy power wants the crown, merciless minds, they are marching out,
Approaching our land, now the darkness is unleashed
Appearing through the gates of hell, they're spitting out their evil spells.
We have no fear; we triumph as never before
We will be the Angels of Revenge
We will be the masters of the sky with the magic force of the fire god
Forever they will burn, forever in my flames
All for one; one for all

Under the reign of the fire god,
Ruling the world with the lord of wars
Fighting the evil and justice for all
I'm leading the horde of doom
Fire god's attack, hunting demons in the dark
Mighty holy flames; It's a symphony of war

Sing with me the symphony of war, sing with me the glory of our king
All for one and one for all

Under the reign of the fire god,
Ruling the world with the lord of wars
Fighting the evil and justice for all
I'm leading the horde of doom

Under the reign of the fire god,
Ruling the world with the lord of wars
Fighting the evil and justice for all
I'm leading the horde of doom
Fire god's attack, hunting demons in the dark
Mighty holy flames; It's a symphony of war

Fire god's attack, no more demons in the dark
You'll be back in hell, it's a symphony of war
You'll be back in hell, it's a symphony of war
