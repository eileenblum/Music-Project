[V. Tournament In Hell]

[Big Choirs:]
Tournament of Hell; Facing evil reign;
Tournament of hell; Holy tournament

[The Demon + The Witch:] Now you are in hell

[The King:] I have no choice, I don't want another war; too many brave have already died. My golden knight will be our champion!

[The Children choirs:]
oh oh oh

[The Demon:] There will be no mercy â and only if you win, I'll give you the children back.

[The Knight:]
The sky is black, blood on my steel; I am the bringer of war
You'll die tonight, you're my sacrifice, you'll pay for all your crimes
Forever damned, no forgiveness for the betrayer, and you'll burn in the holy flames of god.
Lost in the dark the child was praying for the miracle, when the Angel saved him from despair.

[Second verse:]
[The Knight:]
I have beaten your champion, the son of the devil, in the final tournament
Now respect the deal, (free the children and let them go from hell.)
[The Demon + The Witch:] They'll stay here; we'll unleash the dead souls
[The Angel + the King + The Knight:] Forever damned, no forgiveness for the betrayer, and you'll burn in the holy flames
of god
[The Witch:] Never, never!
[The Angel + The Knight:] Trapped in a cell the child was praying for the miracle
[The Knight + The King:] When the Angel saved him from the dark

Oh oh oh, tournament of hell
Oh oh oh, facing evil reign
In the tournament of hell

[Third verse:]
[The Knight:]
Children of light, you are saved and forever free
Gods of Egypt blessed our magic realm
[The Angel + the Knight + The King:] Legions of hell, you all perish in the underworld
We are marching out in a triumph scream!

Oh oh oh, tournament of hell
Oh oh oh, facing evil reign
In the tournament of hell, yeah
Tournament of hell â hell!

[The Knight:] Before the apocalypse, war of the black angels
Before the apocalypse, the Holy child has return
Before the apocalypse, war of the black angels
Before the apocalypse, the holy light now is back from hell
