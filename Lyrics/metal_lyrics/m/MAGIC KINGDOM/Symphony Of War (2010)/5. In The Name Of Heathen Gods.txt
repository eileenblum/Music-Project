Through the fire and the storm
Combats in the dust and smoke
In the name of heathen lords
We will fight 'til the night falls
If our prayers are sincere
Thor will help to reach our goals
Hidden in the cold and silent dark
We are from the lands of ice

In the name of gods, for the mighty Thor
With the magic wind and the power of his hammer
We conquer the world, for the heathen gods
Raising bloody swords; glory to the mighty and eternal Thor

We are the howling wolves of death
We are coming from the north
In the name of heathen gods
We will take your fortress' gold
We have crossed the poison sea
We don't fear the edge of the world
Sailing through the oceans with our mighty dragon-ship
'Til we find the enemy

In the name of gods, for the mighty Thor
With the magic wind and the power of his hammer
We conquer the world, for the heathen gods
Raising bloody swords; glory to the mighty and eternal Thor

[Spoken:]
In the name of heathen gods, for the mighty Thor
With the magic wind and the power of his hammer

In the name of gods, for the mighty Thor
With the magic wind and the power of his hammer
We conquer the world, for the heathen gods
Raising bloody swords; glory to the mighty and eternal Thor
