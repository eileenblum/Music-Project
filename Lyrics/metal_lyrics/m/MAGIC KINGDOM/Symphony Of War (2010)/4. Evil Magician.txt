I have seen many lords, many kings and warriors
I have seen many lands, many different people
Someone said, I'm the devil, some people say I'm the chosen one
Can you trust a stranger? Could you believe in the unknown?
I heard the cries of a lonely dying princess:
She asks me to save the kingdom and her land

I'm the evil magician, I'm your last solution
Drink my magic potion to survive
There's no more light in your life, no one hears your call
Drink my magic potion to survive
Evil! I'm the evil magician

I don't need any knights, I don't need any engines of war
I will unleash all my spells, devastating your enemies' walls
But my help isn't free, you made a pact with darkness,
Now I want what I need; your astral energy, you will give
Don't be afraid; I will never take your soul
Now you are saved but your lifetime will be shorter

I'm the evil magician, I'm your last solution
Drink my magic potion to survive
There's no more light in your life; no one hears your call
Drink my magic potion to survive
Evil! I'm the evil magician

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Now you are free, I unleashed all my spells,
You will live in the glory of eternal power and light

I'm the evil magician, I'm your last solution
Drink my magic potion to survive
There's no more light in your life; no one hears your call
Drink my magic potion to survive
Evil! I'm the evil magician

Ah aha aha!
