[II. Before The Apocalypse / War Of The Black Angels]

Nowhere to hide, nowhere to run;
You have to fight in the tournament of hell
Nowhere to hide, nowhere to run;
You have to fight in the tournament of hell
Death from above, unholy spy
Black angels fly to steal the light
We march for the lord, through the sea of ice
Black angels fly to the temple of light
Death from the sky, unholy eye
Black angels fly to steal the light
We march for the crown, to the mountains of ice
Black angels stole the children of light

[The Angel:] ah ah ah
[The Black Angels:] My Master, we captured the children of the Holy Temple and we are coming back to you&amp; Ascaroth
[Ascaroth/Prince of southern Hell:] Tell me, Tazira, is your brother still spying for us?
[The Witch:] Yes, My Lord, the King believes in every word he says
[Ascaroth:] my unholy angels, I will now send a messenger to Abadon, the hidden path will be open again, so he can prepare the infernal troops.
[The Witch:] oh-ahhhhhhhhhh!
[The Knight:] You've lost the battle. Once again, you are in the shadows
[The Witch:] I am banished from the kingdom but now I am with my unholy father
[The Angel:] Stay away from the sacred keepers, stay away from the holy temple
[The Demon:] It's too late, they are in my realm, forever in the south of hell

[The Knight:] Sinners, we will kill you, we'll hunt you down
[The Knight + the Angel + The King:] legions of darkness must pay
[The Witch + The Demon:] Now, your kingdom is blessed no more, we'll never give you back the children of light!

[The King + The Knight:] black angels betrayed us, they stole the stone that protects our people from sins
[The Demon:] Wings of death will burn your lands
[The Witch:] Unholy reign will rule your world.

[The Knight:] The journey begins, we'll ride with the wind
[The Knight + The Angel:] We must find the last mystic dragon land
[The King + The Knight:] We'll capture the beast, he will tell us the way
[+ Angel:] to find out the Demon's den in hell and save our keepers

[The Witch + The Demon:] Slaves of god!

Before the Apocalypse; war of the black angels
Before the Apocalypse, the holy light must be back
Before the Apocalypse; war of the black angels
Before the Apocalypse, the holy light must be back

Nowhere to hide, nowhere to run;
You have to fight in the tournament of hell
Nowhere to hide, nowhere to run;
You have to fight in the tournament of hell

[The Demon:] My spy was always there, watching over silently
[The King:] My golden defenders are now ready to strike,
[The Knight + King:] The gate of hell must stay closed eternally
[The Witch:] My damned brother, son of evil, has his shadow within your walls
[The Angel:] With the white magic of our wizard
[The Knight + The Angel:] We'll be able to find out this traitor
[The King + Angel:] Prepare for war, my glorious knights, fight for the holy throne
[The Knight + Angel + King:] Freedom and eternal light
[The Demon + The Witch:] I was born of fire, a thousand Demons will raise
[The Demon + Witch:] from the eternal cages of hell
[The Knight:] The Wizard (has) revealed the name of the spy
[+ The Angel:] We are coming to your infernal realm
[The Demon:] He'll never tell you the way to the gate
[The Witch:] His soul is black
[The Witch + Demon:] His mind is ruled by the evil forces

[The Knight:] Now is the time, we're facing our fate, to kill or to die is our destiny to save our children!
[The Witch + The Demon:] We 'll get your souls!

Before the Apocalypse; war of the black angels
Before the Apocalypse, the holy light must be back
Before the Apocalypse; war of the black angels
Before the Apocalypse, the holy light must be back

Nowhere to hide, nowhere to run;
You have to fight in the tournament of hell
Nowhere to hide, nowhere to run;
You have to fight in the tournament of hell

[Bridge / epic choirs:]
[The Knight:]
Ride with the wind, to save the king
Ride with the wind, to save the holy child
Ride with the wind, to save the holy child
Ride with the wind, to save the king, fight for the light
In the name of hope and misery.
