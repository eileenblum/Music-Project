[III. At The Gates Of The Last Mystic Dragon Land]

[The Witch:] Keepers follow me or I'll cut your throat. You, holy children, will stay slave forever
[The Witch:] And you'll rot in the abyssal dungeon, ahahahaaaaaah
[The Demon:] And you'll rot in the abyssal dungeon, ahahahaaaaaah

[The Knight:] Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide

[The Witch:] ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
The sacred arrow touched my darkened heart;
Light of angels blinds me
Ahhhhhhhhhh I can't see anymore!
But our black dragon killed the wizard!
