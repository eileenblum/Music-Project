Face the truth, see what's happening to our world
It's time to react, open your eyes before it's too late
Protect the forests, the seas and the air
The planet is warming, the ice lands are melting
Madness of mankind must stop, we must respect the earth

Lost in a million sinners world ? I am the fire of hell
Lost in a million sinners world ? I am temptation, you're damned
Don't play with fire; don't be a fool, or
Your soul will burn in a lake of fire
Don't make your rules, don't cross the line, or
Your soul will burn in this million sinners world

I feel the pain, I see the signs, the end is near
If we don't change, our children's future will be death
Try to preserve mother Gaia from dirt,
Pollution's gas, toxic rain is killing her soul
Madness of mankind must stop, we must respect the earth

Lost in a million sinners world ? I am the fire of hell
Lost in a million sinners world ? I am temptation, you're damned
Don't play with fire; don't be a fool, or
Your soul will burn in a lake of fire
Don't make your rules, don't cross the line, or
Your soul will burn in this million sinners world

Lost in a million sinners world ? I am the fire of hell
Lost in a million sinners world ? I am temptation, you're damned
Don't play with fire; don't be a fool, or
Your soul will burn in a lake of fire
Don't make your rules, don't cross the line, or
Your soul will burn in this million sinners world

A million sinners world, a million sinners world!
A million sinners world, a million sinners world!
