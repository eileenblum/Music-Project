Now, your time has come
Osiris is your judge and lord
Praise your master, he will give you eternal life in Egyptian skies
But it seems you stay outside heaven
I see the fire burning your soul
Only the brave and the strong will reverse the Curse

We rise, immortals never die
We rise, immortals never die

You killed, you sacrificed
The bleeding souls of your evil reign
You think you were born to rule the world but in the end you die
No resurrection, no mercy for liars
It seems the gate is forever closed
Only the brave and the strong will defeat the Curse

We rise, immortals never die
We rise, immortals never die

Forever lost, you'll stay outside heaven
Only the brave survives this eternal Curse

We rise, immortals never die
We rise, immortals never die

We rise, immortals never die
We rise, immortals never die
We, we, we rise!
