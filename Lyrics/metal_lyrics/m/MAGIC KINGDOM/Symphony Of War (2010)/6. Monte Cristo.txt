I was a mariner, on the ship 'The Pharaoh'
But I was wrongly accused, betrayed by my best friend
Now my fate has changed, lost in a prison cell
On an island far from home

I'm still alive; I am Monte Cristo
I am here for you
You will die in the holy flames of my revenge

After 14 years of pain, 14 years of loneliness
The Abbot has revealed the secret treasure's place.
From the dungeon I escaped, and I found the hidden gold
Now is time for vengeance, yeah!

I'm still alive; I am Monte Cristo
I am here for you
You will die in the holy flames of my revenge

Aah aah aah
I'm still alive; I am Monte Cristo
I am here for you
You will die in the holy flames of my revenge, yeah!
