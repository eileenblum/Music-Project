[I. Through The Sea Of Ice / Quest For The Holy Light]

[Introduction:]
There was a Land of freedom and honour, a land of magic and myths, where people lived in peace and harmony with nature, where war was only a far-distant and old memory for everyone.
Let me tell you the story of this mysterious ancient realm, let me speak about what I once saw and that I never forgot, let me relate you the tales of the magic kingdom.
But sometimes evil worship could change everything, and what was carved in stone, could be broken forevermore.
It's here that our journey begins, mighty warriors, knights and wizards, cross the sea of ice, mountains of frozen snow; to reach the mystic dragon land, seek out the last winged beast and the hidden gate of hell; bring back our holy light keepers and write the legend of the holy pentalogy.
