Angry eyes, hungry minds
We are the slaves forgotten in the dark
He has power, he's the fire
He controls our destiny

Immortal lord
The sun will always rise
Immortal lord
And I will survive
Immortal lord
The light will arrive
Immortal lord
And I will survive

He's the master, he's the monster
He wants blood from all the young and old
We are his children, we are the damned
We're lost our liberty, we've got eternity

Immortal lord
The sun will always rise
Immortal lord
And I will survive
Immortal lord
The light will arrive
Immortal lord
And I will survive

The have to build the devil's temple
He must fly through every time
He's a hunter, he's the slayer
He needs your soul to live eternally

Immortal lord
The sun will always rise
Immortal lord
And I will survive
Immortal lord
The light will arrive
Immortal lord
And I will survive
