Every night I see a mysterious land
Where evil forces and angels arise from the sand
Every night these visions remind me of something
And when I make up in the morning they are gone with
the wind

All the pain and the cries of a starving old woman are
still in my head
They are still in my heart
All the pain and the cries of a sacrificed child are
still in my head
They are steel in my heart

I'm just a victim of my illusions
I'm just a victim of the ghost of Babylon
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
I'm just a victim of the ghosts of Babylon
Am I dreaming or is it reality?
Now I smell the perfume of oriental flowers
I can feel the power and the victory
And I see the spirits dancing around the towers
What have I been in the past?
Was I killer or the preacher?
What have I done in the past?
Have I loved the cold of the night?
Mystic places are alive where the Euphrates and the
Tigris collide

They are still in my head
They are still in my heart

I'm just a victim of my illusions
I'm just a victim of the ghost of Babylon
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
I'm just a victim of the ghosts of Babylon
