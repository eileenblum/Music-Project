Born in a place where freedom was killed
Living for truth and fighting invaders
Over the hills, you're absolving all sins
The holy cross is your eternal power
You're the master of all believers
But in your veins your blood is not the same
You're the only one, you're the chosen one
You're the protector of the sacred territory

In your eyes the fear does not exist
But the pain your feel is always there
The quest of your life ends in battlefields
Cause you can't forget you lost princess
Dragonson you are the child of death
Dragonson you've been defending the faith

Black moon army's coming to your frontier
You'll never accept these lost souls in your countries
You've promised them desperate cries
And you'll give them pain and dying in agony
With the power of a warrior god
They will burn in the arms of your holy flames
The light of liberty will forever shine
The chaos and tyranny will always be your enemies

In your eyes the fear does not exist
But the pain your feel is always there
The quest of your life ends in battlefields
Cause you can't forget you lost princess
Dragonson you are the child of death
Dragonson you've been defending the faith

Your name will always live in the hearts of men
Only your magic kingdom had never been invaded
Some may say that you were the beast
They named you also Dracula, ooh!

Dragonson you are the child of death
Dragonson you've been defending the faith
Dragonson you are the child of death
Dragonson you've been defending the faith
