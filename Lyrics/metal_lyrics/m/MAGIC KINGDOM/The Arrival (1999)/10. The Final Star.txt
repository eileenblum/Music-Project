In a time of tragedy our children live in fear
The madness of humanity is growing by our sins
I hear you calling, I hear your cries
I see the fury, I see you die
We are reaching for the sky. We'll never see the light
Fire plays with our lives, the devil is in our crimes

Only the good will follow
Only the good will follow the sign
Only the good will follow
Only the good will follow the star

Fighting for freedom, blood has always flown
Looking for power, blood will always from
Wind of destruction, wind cols as ice
Hear all my prayers, lord of forgotten souls
We are reaching for the sky. We'll never see the light
Fire plays with our lives, the devil is in our crimes

Only the good will follow
Only the good will follow the sign
Only the good will follow
Only the good will follow the star

We are reaching for the sky. We'll never see the light
Fire plays with our lives, the devil is in our crimes

Only the good will follow
Only the good will follow the sign
Only the good will follow
Only the good will follow the star
