Lost in the fight, my mission's to kill
I don't realise where I am
Before my eyes the war has begun
Dead bodies are lying in the sand
If I want to go home I have to be so cruel
I want to see my mother's smile before I go

Angels of thunder are burning my soul
Angels of thunder are burning my soul

I'm not afraid, I've been slaying a thousand times
But I know that I will be judged
Deadly demons arrows are flying in the sky
Maybe I'll be the next one
If I want to survive I have to be so cruel
I want to see my brothers before my soul goes

Angels of thunder are burning my soul
Angels of thunder are burning my soul

The warriors of hell appear in the mist
They burn all the village down
My rage's growing up, they will taste my steel
I'll always protect all the mortals
I hope that I will be the master of the sword
I want to be glorious, I'll become a lord

Angels of thunder are burning my soul
Angels of thunder are burning my soul
Angels of thunder are burning my soul
Angels of thunder are burning my soul
