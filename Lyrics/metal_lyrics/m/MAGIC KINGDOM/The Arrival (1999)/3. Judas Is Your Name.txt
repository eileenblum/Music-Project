When I see the stars
I leave all this world behind
And I realise that we are only dust in the sky
I see a million people fighting each other for years
I've been trusting you and now I have to pay the price
But we know for sure that you are insane

Judas, Judas is your name
Judas, Judas is your name
Your name

The evidence is clear you have nothing good inside you
You are just a fool and I don't want to see you
anymore
You wanted glory, you wanted to be king
You live in your own fantasy and you believe it's
ecstasy
And me know for sure that you cry every night

Judas, Judas is your name
Judas, Judas is your name
Your name

When I see your eyes, I can see the devil deep inside
Live your lonely life and remember
To forget my name

Judas, Judas is your name
Judas, Judas is your name
Your name
