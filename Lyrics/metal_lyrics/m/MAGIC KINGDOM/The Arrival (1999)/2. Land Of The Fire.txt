Don't ever touch the fire
If you don't want to get burned
Don't ever trust the lion
One day you're gonna die
You are what you do
Try to take your chance
But something's always calling you
Hidden in the dark
Someone spying on you
Don't ever look behind

Ooh, land of the fire
Cry no more cos hell awaits the liars

Now that you've touched the fire
I can hear you crying
You've trusted the evil and there is no turning back
Now it's in your blood
Stronger than the sword
I see all your emptiness
Now you've gone too far
The end is near for you
Don't refure the fight

Ooh, land of the fire
Cry no more cos hell awaits the liars

Alone in the dark, when all your friends are gone
You feel all your loneliness
Now I see your tears
And you feel the fear, say your final prayers

Ooh, land of the fire
Cry no more cos hell awaits the liars
Ooh, land of the fire
Cry no more cos hell awaits the liars
