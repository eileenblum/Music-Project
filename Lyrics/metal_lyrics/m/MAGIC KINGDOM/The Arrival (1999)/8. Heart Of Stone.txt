All my life I've been searching for
The warmth that only love can give
Now I see this light that's fading away
I can't take it anymore
Like a lonely wolf in the night
I scream out my pain and I cry
I gave you my faith, I gave you my life
And now you are so far from me

Misery for my soul
Misery for your heart without love
Misery for my soul
Misery is for your heart of stone

I can feel all the madness
Hell's not far, it's here on earth
What have we done?!
I can't understand
We've destroyed the best of us
Like the cold wind of winter
You've frozen my heart and I'm dying
I gave you the truth, I gave you the light
And now I'm alone in the dark

Misery for my soul
Misery for your heart without love
Misery for my soul
Misery is for your heart of stone

All our tears are a river of pain
We have gone too far, now it is too late
On your face there was a smile
But behind this smile there was a lie
Like a child without his mother
I feel the loneliness deep inside
I gave you my soul, I gave you my love
And now I have only regrets
