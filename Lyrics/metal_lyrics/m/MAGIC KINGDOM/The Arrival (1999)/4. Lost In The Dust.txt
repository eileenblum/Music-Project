After all this wasted time
I've never found the guiding star
But I believe in all my dreams, yeah
Somebody told me that I'm a fool
But I believe in my truth
You are the good, I am so own, no
I've been chasing shadows all
I don't wanna lose
I'll see the light

Oh god, why do we live in this world of loneliness?
Tell me who can we live in this world lost in the
dust?
Oh lord, why do we live in this world of loneliness?
Tell me who can we live in this world lost in the
dust?

After all these passions are dead
I realise all my mistakes
And somewhere an angel forever cries yeah
You put me a knife right in my hear
And I loosing my blood for you
I'm never forget my lonely nights, no
I'm hunting the dark sides of my mind
I still wanna fight, I want to fly

Oh god, why do we live in this world of loneliness?
Tell me who can we live in this world lost in the
dust?
Oh lord, why do we live in this world of loneliness?
Tell me who can we live in this world lost in the
dust?

I found my own reason to exist
You were the devil, I was so blind
I'm stronger than you and I will resist, yeah
I've been chasing shadows all
I don't wanna lose, I'll see the light

Oh god, why do we live in this world of loneliness?
Tell me who can we live in this world lost in the
dust?
Oh lord, why do we live in this world of loneliness?
Tell me who can we live in this world lost in the
dust?
Oh god, why do we live in this world of loneliness?
Tell me who can we live in this world lost in the
dust?
Oh lord, why do we live in this world of loneliness?
Tell me who can we live in this world lost in the
dust?
