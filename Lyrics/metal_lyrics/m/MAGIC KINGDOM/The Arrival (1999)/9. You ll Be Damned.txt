One day in my life is worse that you think
Clouds are always black and light does not even appear
I see all these faces, they pretend they are my
friends
I know very well that's not the truth 'cause you stick
a knife in my back
I've never felt so sad
Why are people always telling lies to feel stronger
than they really are?
I'll never understand

Run while you can
I just want to catch you, you will pay
Scream as long as you live
I just want to break you, you'll be damned

We are not out of reach of expanding insanity
We'll have to build a strong defence to keep our lives
in the right way
But my revenge will form ten thousand oceans of blood
The sword of justice will vanguish this sea of
jealousy
Your evil works will end
I've been taken in by the illusions of a mad man
You'll regret all your lies

Run while you can
I just want to catch you, you will pay
Scream as long as you live
I just want to break you, you'll be damned
Run while you can
I just want to catch you, you will pay
Scream as long as you live
