Welcome to my sick world.
Step inside if you dare.
Watch out for the pure darkness.
Witch will sweep your insides bare.
That's right my world decays.
Look at the dark shades of grey.
As despair fills me within.

Lost is how I feel, because of that I bow and kneel.
Release me from this life, anything to end this tormented strife.

Wishing I could leave this place and forget all my escapades.
Hoping for a little chance to free myself from pain.
I fade away into the dust where I chose to rise from.
To take my own life is my lust. That is what I want to do.

Lost is how I feel, because of that I bow and kneel.
Release me from this life, anything to end this tormented strife
My world decays.

Crying from the pain. Waiting for eternal sleep.
You'll never shed the pain that goes down so deep.
Slowly all my dreams are drowned out by the sound,
of my own frightened screams which come pure from the heart.

Take me to my death sleep.
Where I bleed, where I weep.
My world ends here, as I dry my tears.
There's nobody near, alone with my fear.

Crying from the pain. Waiting for eternal sleep.
You'll never shed the pain that goes down so deep.

Welcome to my world.
I'd warn you not to stay.
While you can still leave,
turn and run away.

This is my sick world.
Step inside if you dare.
