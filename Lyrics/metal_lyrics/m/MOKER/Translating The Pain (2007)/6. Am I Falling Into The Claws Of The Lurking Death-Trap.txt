Death comes to us all. No matter how hard I fight for my own life.
The lust to give away my soul. The death collector won't take it on hold.

Am I falling into the claws of the lurking deathtrap?
Knowing that severe torment is destined for my special kind.
Am I falling into the claws of the lurking deathtrap?
Visions of horror admits the corridors of my mind.

Death manifests itself, it kills and mains. Feel the presence grow.
The dark is where I'm going to dwell. No longer can I see, as death wants it to be.

I'm dying inside but I won't life forever.
I'm crying inside, I got to hold together.
Sucking the spirit from your soul.
The presence invades your brain like mole.
Falling (into the) deathtrap. My life ends here.
Sinking (into the) darkness. Memories fade away.
There's nothing to gain.
See the suffer in my eyes, so many sleepless nights.
I'm falling down this hole, sinking farther down.
I want to scream out loud but silence is all you hear.
Now it's time to take my past and make it all disappear.
Reaper of life!

Tears begin to flood from my eyes.
My body shakes as I start to fall.
Tangled and twisted feelings all unwind.
My heart is dead with no demand.

I'm falling into the trap. Past the eyes of death.
I'm falling from the surface. Give me a peaceful rest.
I could not hold on. Now I'm dead and gone.
So quickly I couldn't see. What the fuck happened to me.
I've fallen into the trap. Past the eyes of death.

Death comes to us all. No matter how hard I fight for my own life.
The lust to give away my soul. The death collector won't take it on hold.

Am I falling into the claws of the lurking deathtrap?
Knowing that severe torment is destined for my special kind.
IÂve fallen into the claws of the lurking deathtrap.
Visions of horror admits the corridors of my mind.
