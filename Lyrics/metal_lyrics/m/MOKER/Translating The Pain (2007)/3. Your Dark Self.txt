You choose to hide in the shadows of your shattered mind.
Bringing forth the blackness with all its tempting fears.
You look in the dark and nothing is there.
Maybe it's the demon that will haunt your soul.
Let yourself get lost in the powers of that fright.
You'll find the bottom of your blackened heart.

You want to walk the other side of life.
Let others taste the tears you've cried.
The need in you will not subside.
So to the dark you run and hide.
This is what keeps you sane.
You welcome all the pain.

You take the darkness,
as your only source of light.
You accepted the darkness,
as the one you kiss goodnight.
You know the darkness,
as only the devil could.
You touch the darkness,
and it makes you feel so good.

Dark thoughts hold a power.

Into the darkness, you wander in your broken mind.
As long there's darkness. You'll survive!
Through the eyes of sadness. You'll get by!

Push yourself in the shadows.
In the darkness forever bound.
You'll lurk at the same place.
Never to be found.

The need in you will not subside.
So to the dark you run and hide.
This is what keeps you sane.
You welcome all the pain.

Your soul is dark!
