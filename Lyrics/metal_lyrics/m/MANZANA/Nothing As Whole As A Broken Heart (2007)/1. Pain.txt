Where it comes all the creeping inside
every time I try to close my eyes
pictures of you floating by
Coming up closer until I hear you cry
days are okay I know what to do
but in the nite I am drowning

in the nite I can fly I can be the butterfly
I can come to you again
take my hand I will make you understand
What it feels like to be loved by you: I break your hand

I know you never can hurt me no more
cause you have gone through the final door
but you keep laughing in my head
telling me IÂ´m bad and eventually insane

days are ok I know what to do
but in the nite in the nite
I can fly I can be the butterfly
I can come to you again
take my hand I will make you understand
What it feels like to be loved by you: I break your hand
here comes the pain again and it wonÂ´t leave me alone
