you say that your heart is out of line and all you need is some time IÂ´m trying to count but the days wonÂ´t die oh how I wish that you would call oh how I long to be with you oh how I need to hear you say Â´all I want is youÂ´ can you hear me I waiting for your call IÂ´m lying on the floor thatÂ´s all donÂ´t make me fall can you see me IÂ´m drowning in my love IÂ´m gonna have to let it out donÂ´t make me fall IÂ´m sick of your lies they are coming out of my ears youÂ´re running out of time with me oh how I wish that you would call oh how I long to be with you oh how I need to hear you say that our love is true can you hear me I waiting for your call IÂ´m lying on the floor thatÂ´s all why canÂ´t you call can you see me IÂ´m drowning in my love IÂ´m gonna have to let it out donÂ´t make me fall
