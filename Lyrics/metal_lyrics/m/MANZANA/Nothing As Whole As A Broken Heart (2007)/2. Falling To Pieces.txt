Another black morning Alone in my bed DonÂ´t know where have you gone I stare at the ceiling until you come That is the kind of love that kills me It follows everywhere I go Love you so much itÂ´s really hurting me There is a murder in my heart He makes me drown He pulls me down Until IÂ´m falling to pieces He makes me drown He pulls me down Until IÂ´m falling to pieces Every aching breath the pain will grow Comes larger than our love Deeper than our thoughts Until IÂ´m falling to pieces What likes beneath the surface Is death through love I feel the bruises on my wrists I am no longer scared Another kiss is like a suicide Another shot right through my heart So together ever after IÂ´m rather scared of you than myself He makes me drown He pulls me down Until IÂ´m falling to pieces He makes me drown He pulls me down Until IÂ´m falling to pieces Every aching breath the pain will grow Comes larger than our love Deeper than our thoughts Until IÂ´m falling to pieces One another wake One another wake One another wake For the lonely morning Begging for more
