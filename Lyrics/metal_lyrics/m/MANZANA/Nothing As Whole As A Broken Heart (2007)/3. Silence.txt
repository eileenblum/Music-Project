YouÂ´re so unsure Hold it I do endure your pain You hold me near ThatÂ´s the end of it all ThereÂ´s no more patience in me ThereÂ´s no more kindness to feel IÂ´m going to wash you off of my skin ThereÂ´s not a sound In this silence I wish I could live like this forever EverythingÂ´s straight in my head You better hate me like you promised to You better hate me like you promised to You better hate me like you promised to Cause I can bring you down I tried to be everything Million years to everyone Love, until I fell so hard On my knees ThereÂ´s not a sound In this silence I wish I could live like this forever EverythingÂ´s crystal clear You better hate me like you promised to You better hate me like you promised to You better hate me like you promised to Cause I can bring you down You You thought I waited all my life For you to tell me what I need You thought I waited all my life Now hate Is all I want Just hate Not anything more You better hate me like you promised to You better hate me like you promised to You better hate me like you promised to Cause I can bring you down
