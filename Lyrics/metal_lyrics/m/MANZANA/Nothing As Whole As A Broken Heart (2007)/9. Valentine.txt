IÂ´m walking the street upon By the very door Where we used to kiss Everything is like before Water running like a bliss I can feel you breathe in me Let my fingers run on the door I donÂ´t know now what to do Or where to go I wanted to be For the rest of my life To be your happy valentine Now the pain is so real Hit against the wall I hate to love you even more Like the fate knew just where to aim On the minute it just begun to rain IÂ´m letting it float my hair Mess my makeup I donÂ´t care Now the future holds for me Nothing but A boring tragedy Of a girl who did not Get to keep The only one she cared I wanted to be For the rest of my life To be your happy valentine Now the pain is so real Hit against the wall I hate to love you even more There is no happy sun Without the wounds inside my darling YouÂ´re not so tough as you try I nearly lost you because Hated what you made out of me Go back to her donÂ´t let her lie She loves you I wanted to be...
