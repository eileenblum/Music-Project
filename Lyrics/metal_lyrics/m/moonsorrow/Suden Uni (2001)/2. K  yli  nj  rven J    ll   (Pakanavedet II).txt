Saapui hÃ¤n, sanansaattaja
kÃ¤Ã¤nnytetyn kansan
totuuttansa opettamaan meille vÃ¤Ã¤rÃ¤uskoisille.
Uhattuna kirvestÃ¤nsÃ¤ teroittamaan talonpoika -
puolesta metsien, jÃ¤rvien, sÃ¤Ã¤styneiden veljiensÃ¤.

(voittajansa)

Korvansa kavaluudelle
ymmÃ¤rtÃ¤mÃ¤ttÃ¶mÃ¤t antoivat;
Lalli nÃ¤ki orjan taivaan ja katseensa sokaisi.
Pian kirveensÃ¤ harhailijan yÃ¶n sydÃ¤messÃ¤ yllÃ¤tti,
oli veriselle jÃ¤rven jÃ¤Ã¤lle pÃ¤Ã¤ttyvÃ¤ ristin
taival...

"Vaan pian rantautui lÃ¤nnestÃ¤
satoja laivoja,
tuhansia heitÃ¤, jotka saapuivat piispaa kostamaan.
Lukuisten vuosien kuluessa,
tahtonaan nÃyryyden juurruttaminen viimeiseen pakanakansaan
he sÃ¤Ã¤liÃ¤ tuntematta mursivat sitkeÃ¤n vastarinnan
voimallisilla aseillaan.
Viimeisin pyhimyksensÃ¤ Henrik alttarille nostatettiin,
ja verityÃ¶, suomalaisten tukahdutettu vapauden huuto,
pakotettiin hÃ¤peÃ¤Ã¤n."

(kohtalonsa)

Niin anastettiin kunnia sankarilta rohkealta,
mieheltÃ¤ rehelliseltÃ¤, suoraselkÃ¤iseltÃ¤.
Valheilla he kansamme uskoonsa pakottivat,
vaan jÃ¤Ã¤tÃ¤ jÃ¤rven KÃ¶yliÃ¶n he eivÃ¤t murtaa
saata.

[English translation:]

[ON THE ICE OF KÃ¶YLIÃ¶NJÃ¤RVI (PAGAN WATERS II)]

And he arrived, the messenger of his converted
people
to teach this heretic folk his tellings of a divine truth.
Feeling threatened, a simple peasant rushed to sharpen his axe -
to defend the forests, the lakes, his brothers from an unseen fate.

(their vanquisher)

Their ears to treachery those of less
understanding lent;
Lalli saw the heaven for slaves and thus blinded his sight.
Soon in the heart of night his axe took a rover by surprise,
to a pond of blood on ice the path of the cross was to end...

"But soon there were hundreds of ships
landing from the west,
thousands of them who came to avenge the bishop's death.
In the course of numerous years,
to imprint humility within the last pagan folk as their will
they without pity broke the persistent resistance
with their powerful arms.
Henrik, now canonized, was raised onto the altar,
and the slaying, the repressed cry for freedom of the Finnish,
was forced to disgrace."

(their destiny)

Thus wrongfully was assumed the honour from a
warrior,
from a man of rightfulness, a defender of sincerity.
By forcefeeding lies they compelled our folk to their faith,
but the ice of KÃ¶yliÃ¶njÃ¤rvi they can never break.
