[bonus track]
[music: Traditional, lyrics: Trad./Ville Sorvali]

Tulkaapa Ã¤ijÃ¤t, nyt ryypÃ¤tÃ¤Ã¤n kun minun hautajaiseni on.
Itse kun tÃ¤nne kuoppaan suistuin seuraksenne vain taivu en.

Kuten sinÃ¤, kuten minÃ¤, vaikka te taikka me;
kunhan vain saamme juodaksemme.
Hei tulehan ja kuule kuinka iloisesti kilahtaa
se malja juoka nyt tyhjennÃ¤mme.

Tulkaapa Markus, Mitja, Marko ja Henri
hilpeÃ¤t veikot riimukivelle,
Kun tÃ¤ssÃ¤ kerran jo istuttu on niin reilut kÃ¤nnit kiskaiskaamme.

Hautakiveeni saa kaivertaa tilaisuus kun siihen on:
"TÃ¤ssÃ¤ lepÃ¤Ã¤ ja aikaansa viettÃ¤Ã¤ juoppolalli verraton."

[ENGLISH TRANSLATION:]

[Come Along Fellows!]

Come along fellows, let's booze all night for it is now my funeral.
I just slipped into this grave and can't keep you company

Just like you as well as me, just like any of us near;
as long as we get to drink our beer.
Hey stop by to listen how merrily it clinks
as we raise a chalice to be emptied here

Come now Markus, Mitja, Marko and Henri,
the merry men on my burial ground.
Now that we1ve sat here for long enough,
it would be time to get real drunk.

I would be glad if someone carved these honest words on my tombstone:
"Underneath you lies and rests one excellent, unrivalled sot."

The debut album. In spite of the final release date, most of the material was already composed in 1999.
Epic heathen metal calmed quite a deal down from "TÃ¤mÃ¤ Ikuinen Talvi". Folkish and pompous.
