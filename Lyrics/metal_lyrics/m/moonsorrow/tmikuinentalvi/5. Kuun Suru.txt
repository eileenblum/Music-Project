Notes
Officially spoken of as Moonsorrow's second demo.
There is now a cd-release of the same material with new vocals and an improved sound (see albums) and thus the original recording is no longer available.

The fastest interpretation of epic heathen metal ever.
Lotsa folk-influences blended with a 'norse' overall.

Released on tape by Meat Hook Productions in 1999.
Officially sold out but might be available through various distributors.
