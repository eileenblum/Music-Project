Katoaa kaikki mitÃ¤ edessÃ¤si nÃ¤et
Haihtuu vesipisara takaisin tyhjÃ¤Ã¤n
PÃ¤ivÃ¤ syttyy ja hetkessÃ¤ kuolee

Katoaa kaikki minne muisti ei yllÃ¤
Vuorollaan pÃ¤Ã¤ttyy jokainen vuosi
Laulu nousee ja pian jo vaimenee
Silti saman laulun seuraava taitaa

KehÃ¤n tÃ¤hÃ¤n piirsi ensimmÃ¤inen jumalista
Nuo hÃ¤keltyneet raukat sitÃ¤ jÃ¤tti kiertÃ¤mÃ¤Ã¤n

Aikanaan oli aika kaikesta tyhjÃ¤
Vailla tuulta, rantoja piiskattavaksi
Piti maata ja taivasta kÃ¤mmenellÃ¤Ã¤n
Nimetty nimeÃ¤mÃ¤tÃ¶n

Kun taivaan saivat tÃ¤hdet
Ja merellÃ¤ rajattiin maa
Maan ottivat sen elÃ¤vÃ¤t
SiitÃ¤ rakensivat valtakunnan
Syntyville kuoleville

KehÃ¤n tÃ¤hÃ¤n piirsi ensimmÃ¤inen jumalista
Nuo hÃ¤keltyneet raukat sitÃ¤ jÃ¤tti kiertÃ¤mÃ¤Ã¤n

Kun taivaan saivat tÃ¤hdet
Ja merellÃ¤ rajattiin maa
Maan ottivat sen elÃ¤vÃ¤t
SiitÃ¤ rakensivat valtakunnan
Syntyville kuoleville
Mustaan multaan maatuville

Loi luotu omat luojansa
Itse synnytti syntynsÃ¤

Tulten yksin antoi kulkea
Alta maan ja taivaan taa
Kosiskella toinen toistaan

Kunnes sai suuhunsa sanat
Teki kirjoihinsa kirjaimet
Meren suuren saattoi ylittÃ¤Ã¤
Ja tulet valjastaa

VÃ¤symÃ¤ttÃ¤ etsi tietÃ¤
AlkuhÃ¤rÃ¤n auraamaa
Saarta aavaan ajamaa
LÃ¶ytÃ¤Ã¤kseen silmÃ¤nkÃ¤Ã¤ntÃ¤jÃ¤n

Tien kehÃ¤ksi piirsivÃ¤t korkeat voimat
Luuli raukka kai sen johonkin pÃ¤Ã¤tyvÃ¤n

ViimeisestÃ¤ tyyssijasta
Ihmisten ensimmÃ¤isten
Nousi laulu vaimeneva
Syntyville kuoleville
Mustaan multaan maatuneille

[English translation:]

[The Age of Gods]

All that you see in front of you will disappear
A drop of water evaporates back into emptiness
A day is born and in a moment dies

Everything where memory can't reach will disappear
By its turn every year will come to an end
A song arises and soon fades away
Yet the same song is mastered by those who follow

A circle was drawn here by the first of the gods
Who left those bemused wretches to circle it

In time, time was devoid of everything
Without wind, or shores to flagellate
The named nameless one
Held the land and the sea in his palm

When stars received the sky
And land was drawn on the sea
Earth was taken by its living
They built it to a kingdom
For those to be born and to die

A circle was drawn here by the first of the gods
Who left those bemused wretches to circle it

When stars received the sky
And land was drawn on the sea
Earth was taken by its living
They built it to a kingdom
For those to be born and to die
For those to decompose in the black soil

The created now created its own creators
Itself gave birth to its birth

He allowed fires to walk alone
From under the earth and beyond the sky
And to court one another

Until he received words to his mouth
Made letters to his books
Was able to traverse the big sea
And harness the fires

Tirelessly he searched for the road
Ploughed by the primeval ox
THe island driven to the open sea
To find the illusionist

To road was drawn into a circle by high forces
Poor soul, he deemed it might end somewhere

From the final nest
Of the first people
A fading song arose
A song which told everything
For those to be born and to die
For those who decomposed in the black soil
