Vina, vegsvinn, thjodnuma
Rivers born of hvergelmir
BjÃ¶ll, strÃ¶n, ylgr, leiptr
Born of the great valhall

All of them flow
In the lands of midgardr
Last they go deep
Flow down into hel

Under the left root of yggdrasil
Lies the place for the old and the weak
When ragnarÃ¶k comes swords will rise again
Thousands of bodies arise

Warriors march to the fiery pits of hel
The gates are wide open
Fenris will break free, splitting the skies
Surtr brings fire from the south

Ruled by the daughter of loke
Hel was her beautiful name
The rivers run blood of the weak
Realm of ancient souls

Nifelheim
The grave for the fools
Odin's men didn't sleep there

Below hel
A place for betrayers
The ultimate punishment
