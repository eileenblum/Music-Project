[performed by Macabra]Up the malevolent obscurities stairway
Into this shadowy vacant attic place
A ghostly presence of evil was felt,
From these magmatic meanders yearning embrace

Hanging yourself high
Round your head the slipknot is breaking your neck
Grievous mortally erection
Suicide's candidate secondary effects

Green and blue-tinged skin appearance, in quarantine with the dead
Beyond the grave geriatric-necro-sexual abstinence with the dead
Emanating frigidity from the morgue's services
Visceral suppurations paving the hall of this asylum

As the rope is tensing round the beam
The gallows of oblivion is stealing your breath
Come now to your own execution, court of death
drowning of your last sussured whispers
