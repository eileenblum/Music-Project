Rotten
But so alive
Enchanted
And doomed

The dark veil
Bright as none

Your spirit
So warm, so strong
Burning
Like a thousand storms

The bright veil
Dark as none

Black dimensions
I appear in you
Bright transpire
I'll lose track, within you

As I try to grasp the layers
I'm getting closer to you
But the trail is still way longer
Yet clearer is the truth

No one
Besides me
Don't need them
It's you
I'll enchant you

Rage like storm
Cleanse my soul

The layers have been broken
I am reaching into you
Such a feeble lovely moment
Is what I want for you

No one
Besides me
Don't need them
It's you
I'll infect you

The bond of life
Is here for us to take
Let's fly away
And meet our perfect state
Rotten
But so alive
Enchanted
And doomed for life

The dark veil
Bright as none

Black dimensions
I appear in you
Bright transpire
I'll lose track, within you

Cleanse my soul
Rage like storm

The layers have been broken
I am reaching into you
Such a feeble lovely moment
Is what I want for you

No one
Besides me
Don't need them
it's you
I'll embrace you

White dark
bring me freedom
Dark white
The morning night

The black light
Has been corrupted
The dark light
Is still intact

The bond of life
Is here for us to take
Let's fly away
Let's meet our perfect state

Infected by the hour
The rage, comes like a storm
