The gates have opened
The end our darkest fear
All is finally twisted
No presence from us here

Hail the messiah
That sunk us all
An all new reign is coming
The one to drown us all

The gates have opened
The end our darkest fear

I'm here for you
You feel all that I do

Bittersweet sensations
Want the blade but not for you
Bring back the beauty
We'll have to fall, but will you too?

The stench is spreading
To rot our souls
We came defiant
Now raw and cold

You, beside me
The only one I love
Will you embrace me
When this is done?

The funeral winds
Is what I now crave for
I smell the drops
The drowning of the Heavens

Lifeless, breathless, senseless
Is what I came to be
But loveless
And hating me for thee

The gates have opened
The end our darkest fear
No presence from us here

Bittersweet sensations
Want the blade but not for you
Bring back the beauty
We'll have to fall, but will you too?

I came here for you
And you feel all that I do
Don't feel this is cruel
Is this what I wanted for you?

The funeral winds
Is what I now crave for
I smell the drops
The drowning of the Heavens

Now you, beside me
The only one I love
Will you embrace me
When this is finally gone?
