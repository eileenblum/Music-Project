Silent darkness forming
Above the pitch black sky
Angels rotting, falling down like...

Flies infesting airwaves
For the things to come
The pouring death
Has finally reached its form

The stench of decay
Now known as holy grail

The serpent is unveiling
He heard our desperate call
The final storm
The deathquake now to come

Burning up in fire
Feeding from the flames
A future full of ashes
Our essence masquerade

Black death immaculate
No longer a world of hate

The stench of decay
Now known as holy grail
Push the stake deep down my heart
My black blood
Full of hate has turned to stone

Darkest feelings
now seem to be the clearest ones
Black veil of death
Embrace all I've misplaced

The conflict
Is that this took too long to come
Mankind, betrayed by its own norm

Silent darkness forming
Above the pitch black sky
Angels rotting, falling down like...
Flies infesting airwaves
For the things to come
The pouring death
Has finally reached its form

Black death immaculate
No longer a world of hate

Burning up in fire
Feeding form the flames
A future full of ashes
Our essence masquerade
