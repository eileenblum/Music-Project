I'm bleeding
Soaked in thorns
I am drowning breath by breath
Bring me life
Where light is no more
I crave for death, to feel alive

Funeral eternal
Hail, hail, hail death
Roaring bells internal
Pitch black heart in hand

I need my blood to dry
To be reached by darkness
And come to life

To be felt again
All now gone gray
I can't stand the pain
Need to feel again

Open the black hole
Open the gates
I will now take my journey
Into darkness I come

The bright light stabs my emotions
And hides me from feelings I know I have
Then slashes the dreams
And freezes my streams
Can't find what I want it's all full of light

Into darkness I come
Into darkness now I come

Dead for so many years
Ain't what it's meant to be
Only death is real
Stab the fiction, bring the true feel

Just a single touch
Would end my empty days
Good things come for those who wait
I've waited long, far too long

To be felt again
All now gone gray
I can't stand the pain
Need to feel again

Open the black hole
Open the gates
I will now take my journey
Into darkness I come

I am bleeding
Soaked in thorns
I am drowning breath by breath

Bring me life
Where light is no more
I crave for death, to feel alive
