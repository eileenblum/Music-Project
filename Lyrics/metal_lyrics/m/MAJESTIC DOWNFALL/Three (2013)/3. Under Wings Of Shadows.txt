From the light, into the darkness
I feel my fate now reaching the essence known as hate
It's all dark, the truth comes brighter
Distractions gone, and finally done. Now death is here.

I focus further than before
And see the splendour now down to its own core
I feel the freedom from it all
A morbid way of life, more alive than all

Drown me, embrace me, take me out of here
Expel me to the darkness, where I shall lay and bleed
Hunt me, deceive me, I will now feel alive
Under wings of shadows, now hiding from the bright

Light, no longer here
No pain, my empire drenched in flames

Mist, is all I crave
Shut my eyes, and banish me to Hell
