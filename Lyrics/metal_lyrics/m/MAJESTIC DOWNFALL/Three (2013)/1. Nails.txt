I'll, drink, wine. 
One, by, one.

Incompetence your weapon, 
bitterness is you, 
your one sided dimension, 
the nails that hang your soul

My tears, arc dryer than thine, 
My hate, is shaping to death, 
Your tears, are becoming me,
Your hate, is rotting away into chaos.

Your hateful desire,
brought you down this hollow path,
It crashed into me
and I had bleeded much inside.

My soul, the bleakest of them all, 
My fate, wants you nailed in hate.

I'll, drink, wine,
One, by, one.

Ignorance your master,
Now crawling through the cracks,
You've reached the empty hollow,

that fed me all my life. 
Now all is darker 
Bloodstained feelings, 
I've had enough, 
Go back to your hell, 
The funeral of all the lies.

Your fears, are becoming me,
Your hate, is rotting away,
My tears, are dryer than thine,
My hate, will shape your death into chaos.

All my life,
1 stepped away from you, 
The grave that you now see, 
is madness gone to me.

All my feelings, 
have now gone sad, 
Consumed by hatred, 
revenge is mine. All mine.

My soul, the bleakest of them all, 
My fate, wants you nailed in hate.

Your hateful desire,
brought you down this hollow path,
It crashed into me
and I had bleeded much inside.
