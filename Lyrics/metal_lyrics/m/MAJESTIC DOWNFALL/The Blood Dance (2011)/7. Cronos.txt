You left me
In the middle of an uncertain path
I got lost
In a labyrinth of pain

Confusion
Desperation controlling me
Abducting my mind
Abducting my soul

And I know that every shadow laughs at me
And there is no moon to calm my burning thoughts
Stoic I sink myself into a prison of flesh

And I still feel you
Deep inside myself
With a broken oath
And a flower of blood withering in my heart

You asked me
to embrace a clock and wait for answers
but every piece of time had been a stab in my eyes

And I still feel you
Deep inside myself
With a broken oath
And a flower of blood withering in my heart

Time indecision
Time will heal
Time waiting
Time lost

Time placebo
Time suffering
Time dying
