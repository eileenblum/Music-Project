Just give me one tear of understanding
And for sure I'll ride again

Dark woods my enemies
Streams of sorrow lonely soul
Mankind
Shall never know destiny

The moon is watching
But not understanding
Unanswered questions
Laughing at your despair

An ocean filled with memories
From the roses you broke

You shall never know
But in your heart will stay alone

Why are the garden crying
Why are they mourning
Because of something you left inside
The feelings that you brought to life

Is this possible
Or I was wondering
Is it a dream

Are they just answers
That I don't want to hear
That I don't want to know

We are all alone in this pain
In these pale grey skies
Staring at the fall of leaves
Just asking why
Why why
Just asking why
Why why
Just asking why

Why are the garden crying
Why are they mourning
Because of something you left inside
The feelings that you brought to life

Is this possible
Or was I wondering
Is it a dream
