Drowning the despair is filling your so hated shadow
In a lake of tears
I have silently dropped

The cosmos the reason to keep my wondering
Without a doubt there would be no faith
There would be no faith

The path of stars has been always there
From the confidence I hide and I don't know why
Like a children whose shelter feel all crumbled

The cosmos the reason o keep my wondering
Without a doubt there would be no faith

I try I try to strengthen
This fragile gift
A suffocating path
A restless road

But I know the stars will align within this tragic bottle
To rest in peace
Darkness will be a time to think and wonder
Darkness will be a time for me

I wanted to be a child forever
Scream at your slavery and run away from life
I wanted to be a child forever
But things were not always as I wanted them to be

I was wrong
Dreams to go high
Far far

But I know the stars will align within this tragic bottle
To rest in peace
Darkness will be a time to think and wonder
Darkness will be a time for me
