Those early rising nights
Remembering her lips so bright
Her tooth like the sweetest marble
Will I ever mourn again her side

No one ever made me feel that way
But sadness took it all away

Obscure landscapes my accomplicies
They watch you while you cry while you smile
The dawn is obsessed with her deathly feelings
And I am wondering why is that smile so real

Destiny will rise
And the winds of north
Shall guide us into light
But never forgetting what we had
What we had what we were

Her sinful wet lips will never get dry
And I will kiss her until the body trembles

No one ever made me feel that way
But sadness took it all away

Questions
To be done
Answers
To be mourned
And fade away

Obscure landscapes my accomplicies
They watch you while you cry while you smile
The dawn is obsessed with her deathly feelings
And I am wondering why is that smile so real

No one ever made me feel that way
But sadness took it all away
