Sunlight fades
And autumn will bring forth winter
Nightfall fell
And I will protect you from the dark veils of death

Bring forth your power,
You are stronger than all
Bring forth your might
And enlight all

Never let explosive feelings
Loose [sic] your focused mind
Listen to your inner-self
And fly away from time

The fourth string is about to awake
And rule your world with might
The fourth string will shake the earth,
And never, will never be the same

Life will bring you new expressions
To choose or switch off
Use your inner voice
Cleanse yourself from eternal fire

The fourth string is about to awake
And rule the world with might
The fourth string will shake the earth
And will never be the same

I know
We've had our problems
You are the toughest one
For me to understand
We are just the same

The feelings are there
The moment won't fade
Let's swallow this pride together

One day I'll be gone
Please embrace me now
Or I will rot in decaying tears

Rise, rise, I am behind you
To protect you
And try to guide you

IÂ´m not the strongest link
In fact I am a tragedy
But rise, rise, I am behind you

Bring forth your power
You are stronger than all
Bring forth your might
And enlight us all

Bring forth your beauty
And clean my weary eyes
For failing, miscarrying
And remember me, when I die

Never let explosive feelings
Loose [sic] your focused mind
Listen to your inner-self
And fly free away from time

The fourth string is about to awake
And rule the world with might
The fourth string will shake the earth
And will never be the same

I know
We've had our problems
You are the toughest one
For me to understand
We are just the same

The feelings are there
The moment won't fade
Let's swallow this pride together

One day I'll be gone
Please embrace me now
Or I will rot in decaying tears
