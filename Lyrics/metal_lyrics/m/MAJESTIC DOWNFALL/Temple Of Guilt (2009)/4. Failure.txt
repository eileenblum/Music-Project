Dual personality
That haunts each moment of this lie called slavery

Abundant thoughts bring me madness
Cut inside my newly turned subconscious mind

Why is there so much hatred
When, did it become true
Why is this grief consuming me
This canÂ´t be true

Sometimes in my newborn dawn
I wish the sun, I wish the light could be no more
But IÂ´m wrong

Sometimes in my silent tomb, the lifeless call
And ask me to embrace the cold
But I wonÂ´t

Why, can I be so wrong
When, did I loose [sic] my focus
What turned my sky into a blurry black pit
This isn't true

Time to come back and defeat my demons
The brightest of lights shines
So hidden in my soul

My paralyzed
Drowned feelings
Need to be no more

Every falling tear hurts more,
I am a failure, I hurt the ones I love
I am the blade that cuts myself
I try to change

Why, is there so much hatred
When, did it become true
Why is this grief consuming me
This monster can't be true

Help me, save me
You, must appear
Sorrow needs to leave me
Forever, needs to fade away

The first string is supposed to be the strongest one
Irony
The first string is supposed to lead the lost
Save me

Take me again, and let me come in forever
I have really tried, but my trying is a pity
Let me see the light around me.

The first string is broken by my deeds
Irony
I have it all, I had it all, but my existence is so wrong
Save me

The garden of delights is next to my inferno
I have really tried
What is wrong?

Help me, save me
The hidden light must appear
Sorrow needs to leave me
Forever, needs to fade away

My paralyzed
Drowned feelings
Need to be no more

Why, is there so much hatred
When, did it become true
Why, is this grief consuming me
This can't be true
