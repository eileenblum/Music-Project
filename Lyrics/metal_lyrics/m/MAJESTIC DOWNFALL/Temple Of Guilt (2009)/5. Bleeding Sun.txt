The emptiness that burns your soul
Will forever be
The bleeding sun that burns you down
All because of me

Anger, despair
All there is to see
Forgive this twisted long lost soul
Don't suffer, never suffer, in my sea

You came into my whipped soul
Cleansed my bleeding wounds
Disenchantment, shame
What did you choose?

You are in pain 
And I know why
I chose you and stung you
Ain't that a lie

I brought you the weakest sun of all
That shines so dark, it mourns
I need a new chance, to enter your life
And not to cry as I watch you die
Because of me

I failed you, never thought I would
And never think you had to do with it
My black sun, became your tomb
But I will save you. from this realm of death

Millions of wishes, I made  you, you took them, and dreamed away
You believed, embraced me, and vanished me from my black hell

I don't deserve you, and I never will
I turned your sky, the perfect heaven, into a fucking hell

Despair, mournful tragedy, suffering, all that you have seen
Lifeless, corroded, dead, with a fear for tomorrow

What will you become, from all my sorrow
You have given me all, second string
I know I disappoint you, I am a failure
A part of me has died, and it's not me

I brought you the weakest sun of all
That shines so dark, it mourns
I need a new chance, to enter your life
And not to cry as I watch you die

Millions of wishes, I made  you, you took them, and dreamed away
You believed, embraced me, and vanished me from my black hell

I don't deserve you, and I never will
I turned your sky, the perfect heaven, into a fucking hell

Despair, mournful tragedy, suffering, all that you have seen
Lifeless, corroded, dead, with a fear for tomorrow
