Pale skin
Deep dark eyes
Fallen, from majestic skies
Dive down
Into the depths of mourn
An ironic welcome to a throne of pain

My last pride, yet sorrow drowns my eyes 
Lament, despair, is all that I can bare
The 5th door was opened into a world were (sic) hate reigns
The 5th string of life is brought down to die 

Virgin tears, cuts like knives
Help me with this grief
Show me that we are not so vain 

Shadows torture me, stab my eyes 
For letting you come inside
For bringing darkness to your life

I betrayed you, brought oblivion to your perfect state
Opened you a scar and left it bleeding
Now I have gone too far
In my own temple of guilt
The door was opened and I brought you in
Why?

Pale silhouette, under a blood-red sky,
The age of suffering in the moment you came to life
Dive down, into the depths of mourn
An ironic welcome, to the throne of pain 

Light came in, and all turned black
A lament in my soul
My last mistake of yore

Behold the light in you, shine in this sick world
Try to forgive me, for letting this be true

I betrayed you, brought oblivion
To your perfect life
Opened your scar, left it bleeding
Now I have gone too far
In my own temple of guilt 
The door was opened and I brought you in
Why?
