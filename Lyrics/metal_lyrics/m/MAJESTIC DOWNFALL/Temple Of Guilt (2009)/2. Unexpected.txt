Unexpected
Between two different reigns
Blurred visions mourn my sight
In this dark and gloomy night

You came
Was it the perfect time?
My life is a mess, the world is crumbling
A change to swallow as poison in my veins

Darkness, crawled outside my burning soul
The long forgotten light, no longer gone

The 3rd string was brought down
I can't fail, will not fail
For the first time in my journey
There is not a single place for this thing called failure

You were the first
That made me stand against
That made me raise my head
Up to the sky

Peace of mind
Came back into my hell
That no longer burned
My ashen self

I have always wondered why you came for salvation
I donÂ´t deserve you, never did, and surely never will
Paying you back will always stand as an utopic thought
But I will try, and I will die, if I ever see you cry

Never let this godforsaken world make you fade away
DonÂ´t let yourself go numb and loose [sic] your edge
And never take me as an example, just do what I say

Never use my stench of life as guide
It will defeat you, will make you die
Just follow your path, as you always have

The 3rd string was brought down
I can't fail, will not fail
The meaning of my drownful life
Has just changed, just morphed forever

Sadness, crawled outside my drowning soul
The long forgotten might, no longer gone

Never let this godforsaken world make you fade away
DonÂ´t let yourself go numb and loose [sic] your edge
Never take me as an example, just do what I say

Never use my stench of life as guide
It will defeat you, will make you die
Just follow your path, as you always have

There is no stronger weapon than your innocence
Than your will to live and change all things go black
Never let your hate be stronger than you
And if a man shall ever step in your path, he shall be crushed

Taught me, possessed me
Took me to survival
Opened once again
The bridges that I burnt
