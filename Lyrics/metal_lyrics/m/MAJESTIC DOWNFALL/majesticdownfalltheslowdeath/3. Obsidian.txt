[performed by Majestic Downfall]Death, inside me.
No longer do I feel.
So expected.

Doomed, skies falling.
Healing from whats to come.
So wanted.

Flirting, with shadows
of the darkest kind.
Come take me.

Repulsive against all the light,
darkness is now my delight
gone pitch black.

Chronicles of sorrow,
the menace will soon be gone,
spread my silver ashes.
Raped, they will look for rest.

Eyes
shut down forever
A pitch black sight,
peace and delight.

Blood,
it's time to slow down
look at the past
now come and dance.

Introspection
is finally here
All around me.
It's time to sleep.

Light,
is coming to me.
In the truest form.
I cannot see.

Isolated,
I finally feel.
Through the ashes
I will now bleed.

Life now brought me to thee.
I'm finally somber.
A dying seed.

Angel of death,
come for my self,
I'm deceiving.

Gospel of darkness,
Bring on the black chant,
I want to leave.

Death, inside me.
No longer do I feel.

So expected.
Chronicles of sorrow,
the menace will soon be gone,
spread my silver ashes.
Raped, they will look for rest.

Blood,
it's time to slow down
look at the past
now come and dance.

Eyes
shut down forever
A pitch black sight,
peace and delight.

Black lungs,
breathing in me.
Stained heart,
pumping pity.

Hail death,
it's finally here,
Black hope,
bring it on to me.

Light,
is coming to me.
In the truest form.
I cannot see.

Isolated,
I finally feel.
Through the ashes
I will now bleed.

Hail death,
it's finally here,
Black hope,
bring it on to me.

Black lungs,
breathing in me.
Stained heart,
pumping pity.
