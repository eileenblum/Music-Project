[performed by Majestic Downfall]Hell,
bring me water,
but not from tears,
that blind my sight,
that burn my eyes.

Solitude,
stay away from this,
this ain't meant to be,
the collage I know see,
as abstract as now thee.

Look at me,
I am you,
find it in me,
here it lies bleeding.

I am here,
in silence enshrined,
gasping for air,
burning I am.

Next to my hell,
the horned one himself,
no pity for sadness,
the real one indeed.

I'm burning,
I'm crying,
I do not feel.

Dark is the season
that turned my eyes
away from you.
The dark lullaby.
Darkness in me,
the light I now see,
feed me with emptiness,
stuck hate in me.

Never good for you,
will stay that way forever.

I meant to get closer,
to be just one,
but wrong was I.

Running away,
coming by will,
realizing again,
I will always fail.

Hell,
bring me water,
but not from tears
that blind my sight
that burn my eyes.

Look at me,
I am you,
find it in me,
here it lies bleeding.

Dark, the season
it turned my eyes
away from you,
the lullaby.

Never good for you,
will stay that way forever.

Darkness in me,
the light I now see,
feed me with emptiness,
stuck hate in me.

Hell is me.
I will now bleed.

I'm burning,
I'm crying,
I do not feel,
I'm dying.

Collapsing,
Muriendo,
Cayendo.
