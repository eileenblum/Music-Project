[performed by Majestic Downfall]Nightmares coming
of life
of death
of sorrow.

Your life is changing,
your soul,
yourself
You are hollow.

I am here for you.
Grab me, and never let me go.
Then things will change
and I'll hold on to you.

New fears crawl in you,
they hunt,
stay and torture.

A panic attack
in veins,
in self,
in sadness.

I will be,
I, for thee.

Embrace your life,
drain down the pain,
You, shall face it,
again and again.

Take strength and push
the bleeding blur
You are everything,
again and again.

Little one,
Not alone,
See me, feel me,
Make them fear.

Grab my hand,
feel the warmth,
a full size army,
of wholesome wrath.

Take strength and push
the bleeding blur
You are everything,
again and again.

Embrace your life,
drain down the pain,
You, shall face it,
again and again.

Nightmares coming
of life
of death
of sorrow.

I will love
I am you.

Grab my hand,
feel the warmth,
a full size army,
of wholesome wrath.

Little one,
Not alone,
See me, feel me,
Make them fear.

We, together as one,
We, the two man army.

We, ignited by blood,
We, the fearless army.

I am here for you.
Grab me, and never let me go.
