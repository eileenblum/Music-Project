Awake, blinded by a bright light before me
Trying to move, bound to a hard, cold bed of sorts
Head hurts, numb body
Only shadows move around me
Lost perspective of time

Sequence of images of an alternate life
Flash before me
Need to clear my mind to find my answers
No solutions, full of doubt
"How did I get here?"

Visions of putrid beings appear,
Crawling all around
I perceive the pleasure it brings them to see me
On the verge of insanity
Wielding their tools, closer now
The experiment of control continue

They cut my flesh, meticulous analyze the muscles
To grind the bulb and connect their cephalic system
Extirpate cerebellum to put devices
I can't fight for my life
I need to escape

Destroy the implanted device
To eradicate the battle
Within mind and body
Vision is a blur
On the verge of losing it all
