Trapped in this room
Trying to solve the riddle of me
I feel the imminent explosion of madness arriving
The moment to satisfy my instinct is coming
Leaving all reason to satisfy it

I need a metamorphosis to make me stronger, immortal
To destroy the shackles of mind

My last dream
Revealed when I lost my soul
Possessed by a dark version of me
Through time
We had been enemies
I have to destroy all to be free

When I wake
I'll see my eyes in the mirror
They'll show the fear
From the depths of psyche
The pain of my soul
Oppressing my body
Too many questions in my head
Strangulated thoughts
Equilibrium is lost

I came to this place
With a promise of divinity
And I've only experimented chemical pleasure
My vision wrapped in dark veils

All day I feel the neurochemical breakdown
All day I feel the neurochemical breakdown
