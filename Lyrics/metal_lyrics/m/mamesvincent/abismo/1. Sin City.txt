Walking through dark streets stained with ill memories
I keep hearing the screams
In this dense atmosphere
Feeling observed
Walking towards
A broken future with no hope
Of surviving the mayhem
In Godâs forsaken city

As I walk to my lair wielding my gun
The mayhem took my wife and son

I can smell your fear
With a broken soul Iâm left alone, no one knows anything
Thereâs no way out
He took all I had, the murderer ran away but now he has to pay
No hope
I will find you

Spent days behind your trace
At last I found you
While my blood runs cold in my veins
And heart beats slow
I know that your life is mine
Your soul will fall to hell to burn
Without a reason to live, and a shattered soul
I fulfill my destiny
With pain and suffering
Living in the shadow of fear
That rules the streets forgotten by God
Beneath the enslavement of power
Until the end of our times!
I lost my reason
I lost my soul
And it only gets worse
My soul is lost in this God's forsaken city
Astray in the shadows of my brain
