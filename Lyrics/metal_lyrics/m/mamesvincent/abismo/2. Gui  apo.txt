Dilapidated human souls showing its rotten essence
No hope for stopping their spiritual obliteration
Praying for salvation, walking the path towards the abyss
Marching towards their deaths,
Wishing their dreams of eternity to be real

Humans
Creators of the legions of death
Destroyers, of the Garden
Infecting Earth
Damnation, the consequence of playing God

A bad experiment, rising again
New beings taught to kill their brothers

Corrupted minds right from the start
Evolutive torrents obstructed by conditioning
Decaying exquisite race, all for personal gain
Sickening social standards, flock lead to their slaughter

Supreme power soon will destroy,
Given our dissonant condition
Parasites inside the perfect creation, divine light denied

Dilapidated human souls showing its rotten essence
Praying for salvation
Wishing their dreams of eternity to be real

Dilapidated human souls showing its rotten essence
Praying for salvation
Wishing their dreams of eternity to be real

Dilapidated human souls showing its rotten essence
Praying for salvation
Wishing their dreams of eternity to be real
