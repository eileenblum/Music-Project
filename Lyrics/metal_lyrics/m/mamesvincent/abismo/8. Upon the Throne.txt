Anxious to consume immensity
Operate this place and
Create brutality to transcend over the multiverse
Witnessing my pleasure from the colossal mirrors
From catastrophe's nest
Images of the deformed
Difficult perspective of the absurd, and the vain
Ancient, obsolete crypts are gateways to sacrifice

Sound of torment capture my senses
A ridiculous finding of the subconscious
Shape my hidden nemesis
Weightlessness as I shed my body

Shape my hidden nemesis
Shape my hidden nemesis

Tools of destiny grind my eyes
Immersed in the temple of the Xil
Driving my mind

Upon the throne of immensity
Universe's canvases become insignificant
Motionless, lifeless
Absorbing the seed of Zegtalik
Approaching the Necropolis
Pyramids emerge

Upon the throne of immensity
Universe's canvases become insignificant
Motionless, lifeless
Absorbing the seed of Zegtalik
Approaching the Necropolis
Pyramids emerge

Instinct drags me to survive
Destroy the ascending barricades
Receiving complete control of this limitless land

Upon the throne of immensity
Upon the throne of immensity
