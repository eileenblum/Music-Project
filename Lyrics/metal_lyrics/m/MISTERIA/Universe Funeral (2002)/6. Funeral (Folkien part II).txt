in the ancient forest a funeral...
king and lord, fell into oblivion
he fell asleep...
and when they burred him, there was no thunder in the sky
his people didn't mourn him, there were no tears, horns never played
only few old men, were humming mysterious melody, when wooden stake
got consumed by flames, his ashes were buried in silence...
at the grave you can see, only one human shape, a person that suddenly
interrupts silent peace of this night, screaming: forgive me, father!
from this day my name is folkien!
