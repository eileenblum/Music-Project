you are preaching so geat truth,
you are teaching so fine,
you involve crofts they believe
in each of your words
there is no false in that
things you do,
every breath is saint,
you are inspiration
for milions
eagerly listening
to your sermonts,
sage! sage! do you know
that your faith awake
lust that save maniknd?
sage do you hear call
of souls you subject?
tears of suffer in your eyes for these who do not believe,
saviour of humans mass you are bringing freedom for everyone
so many walks behind you ready for your each beck, you gloat
your power when stoned children lick your foots
sage do you know that your faith is dead, as dead are your words?
sage do you see polluted blood of your subiect? sage do you see... ?
blind fool you are going to nowhere!!!
