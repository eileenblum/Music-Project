katharsis!!! from the crown of pagan deity the arias of intimacy flow... every day i peep the winged tribe, i steal their plumes, chaste lies... dancing on my mistakes i have grown up to the underground,
i am striking root trying to understand...
i am hidding quietly in the corner of the light,
i am trying to get rid of unwanted skin
i am purifying words but i am filthing thoughts
i will never be able to compromise!!!
