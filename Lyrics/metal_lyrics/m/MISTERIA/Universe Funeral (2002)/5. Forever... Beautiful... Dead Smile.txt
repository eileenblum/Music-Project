ghastly place of my soul, mysterious dreams i walk alone among graves, among clouds i'm new in this heaven inside myself, newly awaken!??
another cosmos in my eyes
forever... beautiful... dead smile...
another heaven inside you
forever sorrow, forever shame
on equal terms, we walk among gods
selection continues! it's better
to consume our sins just like you
before sanitary inspection
inflicts a punishment for selling
outdated goods!
my world, my life, my sin, my mind
it died for you but will resurrect in hate
thousand years ago the world in my dreams
passed away... emotions gave birth to a new life
i've seen the smile coming on old faces...
forever... beautiful... dead smile...
scared of death - roulette still runs
in religions broken faith
you will never stop the time
even when you commit suicide
days like funeral, but where is pain?
my illusion burns in your eyes...
why are withered flowers grown here?
and why do i eat them every day?
death is the only pleasure
that you cannot feel...!
