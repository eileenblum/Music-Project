open the gates of imagination
pass the doors of nothingness
look at the stars
mysterious place
mysterious beings
distant like a dream of immortality
imagine war
and smell death
feel contempt
for human-animal race
killing its existence
where's justice?
where's toleration?
greed poisoned our minds
like sick jealousy
i'm sad when i look at us
we have devoured our ideals
tears of sorrow flow
on chapped cheeks of scorn...
