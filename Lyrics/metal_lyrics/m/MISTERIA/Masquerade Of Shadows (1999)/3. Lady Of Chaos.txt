ohhh! lady of chaos
she woke up the bad power
sticking in the humans soul
flowing through the misty moor
she was creating pain in thoughts
he tears like pearls of fire
make a suffering when she cries
her breath is like the icy wind
freezes remains of childhood
blood from her hands and feet
spelled into deadly poison
filing your throat with sweetness
burning your heart with fire
created from burning matter
flowing over the moor
destroy innoncence with odour of corpse
ohhh! lady, lady of chaos
harder, harder drowing in vengeance
harder, harder drowing in revenge
will hit when the fear is the greatest
with mighty poison will traint your debris
flowing over the world
the death was born!!! born!!! born!!!
ohhh! lady of chaos
