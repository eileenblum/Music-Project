now! the sunrise dying
now! hell demons rise
now! the light is loosing
so fast is getting dark
like tide shade covering the light
like tide they fly to announce night
high above the sky is burning red
heaven's blood is dropping on earth
in battle between light and dark
black moon hurted shining sun
now! the sunrise dying
now! hell demons rise...
savage souls of coursed being
crushing the golden gate
angels howling their wings burning
for this god is coming the end
planet is lousing under fire
from degraded sky
people shrill in global suicide
milion of angels standing on
the castle walls
screaming for help but only people
hear them calls
nowhere to to run no place to hide
only fire reign on the earth
and on the sky
hear the battle cries now!!!
