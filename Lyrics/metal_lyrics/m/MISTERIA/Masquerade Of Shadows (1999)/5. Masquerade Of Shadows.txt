masquerade of shadows in my head masquerade of shadows in my mind
in the theatre of disillusion
in another act...
in another act aversion wins
masquerade
masquerade of shadows
masquerade
in the name of morbid gods
masquerade
masquerade of shadows
masquerade
in the name of greediness
it's not an illusion
it's a dreams funeral
black caravan...
black caravan led by
possessed horses
with a coachman
without left hand
shoves through
the frozen chamber
a wolf crossed their way
somebody cuts his eye out
with a blunt blade of love
a worm wriggles in his brain
in a purperal cramp
giggling maliciously
as a loathsome dwarf
masquerade of shadows in my head
masquerade of shadows in my mind
unwanted paintings
dreadful portraits
and a fallen lord...
and a fallen lord on the throne
masquerade
masquerade of shadows
masquerade
in the name of morbid gods
masquerade
masquerade of shadows
masquerade
in the name of greediness
everybody...
everybody is heading
in the direction of a clearing
on which castle stands
a misshapen block smelling of despair
there is waiting for them
a guillotine of peace
and gallows of justice
why? why with my face???
why? why this place???
proud magician weighs in a pot
a mysterious mixture from a raven
the guide of souls
