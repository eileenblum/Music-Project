lost in the chaos of world like a strange demon we kill with our looks
giving exstasy to a false widow we playon weak strings of life
I'd like to travel to the times to the times of flourishing craft walk through the night in the dark woods
and shout ghosts
of darkness
lost...
lost in the chaos of world like a strange demon we kill with our looks
I am a sad wanderer
a lonely visions of dreams
I am a sad wanderer someone even stole my hate
hate!!!
and what was before
will remain as a sweet mistery anyway...
