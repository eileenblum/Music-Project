demon of dream...
when you wake up in the night
wrapped in a rough blanket of fear
you can't fall asleep
than you think of what
you can save
petrified you can't
find anything...
I, demon of dream return again
I, demon of night awake desires
again I return to your dreams
I haunt your imagination
I tear your old wounds
you wake up and you bleed as before
everywhere you see dark emptiness
I, demon of dream king of darkness
I, demon of night awake desires
I give you a black flower
you cry because you know it's power
I give you a black candle
you walk away into the land of silence
I give a black flower you change into a witch I give you a black candle good bye forever...!!!
