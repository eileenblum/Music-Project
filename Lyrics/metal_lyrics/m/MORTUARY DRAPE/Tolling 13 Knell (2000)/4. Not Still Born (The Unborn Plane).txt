Where I was before my birth? In the plane of the unborn.
Awaiting from the dream dimension, to pervade the fine veil of separation.The dream is a former plane's remember, therefore when I'll die I'll dream the earth.
Is there a limit to the being extent?
Wanna know what's limit's secret number.
A voice who recommends me "Beware! Don't Rip, don't lacerate, could be an handicap life".
The lamknell bell, a voice who tells Don't this fatal veil.
The unborn plane sings the omen birth.
Devily creatures, drawing by unpure seed,
borning with tail, as ombelical cord freak new born child.
Hands with the claws, feet like sabot, casting fetus fallen!
Intercept the seed of reincarnation. Am I lying in a cradle or in a tomb?
Feeling that the time has come for me, I see my new body as a shape.
For someone eternal circlecross, can become a double Pentagon.
In this moment millions of dream souls are descending in the Karmic wheel.
