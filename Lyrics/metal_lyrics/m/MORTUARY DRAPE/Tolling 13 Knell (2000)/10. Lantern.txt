A man who reflected his body in a lake, realize the, illusion of the world.
If his hand keep the lantern oracle, it shines the path in a day of raining.
So I am, I'm here under the rain, in front the lake a lantern in my hand...
I can say In your time . . . I don't belong.
Rise the ladder this path go back. Feel this deep sound from the space.
A face in profile . . . to indicate the direction to the source.
A cross that became a circle. An horizon that became vertical.
A creed that became a dubt. A lantern . . . that shines the path.
A faith that one day will die. A vocation soon collapse.
Simply light of a lantern; it's a lantern built with my hands.
