Birth's End leaves the space to another reign.
Birth's End, lateral moving for an old Rigeneration.
My secret prophecy has been utter.
As contrary, contrary flux insinuating in the mind.
Sexual energy, it has failed.
It grants us natural death, it removes the fecundation.
Union of tow fine dimension.
Bridge of life, of life material has collapsed.
Umanity will fall in the Abyss of desolation and Void.
Primordial creatures dwell on this earth.
The essence of the elements will Rule.
