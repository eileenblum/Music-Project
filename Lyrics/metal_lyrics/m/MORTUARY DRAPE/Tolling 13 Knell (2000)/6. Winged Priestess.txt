There are presences inside the wood, in the glade a feast of elf.
Flying through the wind and time . . . elemental exhalation.
Conventicola of the night, every breath blow with the flame.
Shining sky last days of April . . . every one is free to be.
A ties of blood, body spirit, nocturnal copulation tantric.
dream, earth and the beyond . . . an elf, a monster, a man, a spirit.
Behind the veil, a severe woman seated on the throne.
Between her eyes the immortal flame.
Exhausting dance, embrace on the altar.
Winged Priestess making love, with all her children.
