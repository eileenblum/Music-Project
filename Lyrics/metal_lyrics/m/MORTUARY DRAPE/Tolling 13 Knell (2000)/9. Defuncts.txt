From the halter, from a crime, from a seance;
from a Burial, from a child, die in July;
from the pain . . . The Black Man.
Of Defuncts . . . who appear in the dreams.
Of Defuncts . . . lying on the plankbed morgue.
Of Defuncts . . . who made to ring bells.
Of Defuncts . . . who touch with their cold hands.
Of Defuncts . . . who die young in summer dead.
Of Defuncts, tales of hunted medianic.
Of Defuncts . . . buried in desecrated ground.
Of Defuncts who screamm from the Coffin . . .
What's the life for a Defunet? It's a life that should be.
What's the life for a living? It's a mask on borrow time . . .
When the Defuncts deceased violently in pain.
Of Defuncts . . . who don't realize be dead.
Of Defuncts spit em out from medium mouth.
Of Defuncts . . . summon back by conjuration.
