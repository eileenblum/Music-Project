Rise the I individual, out from this shapeless mass.
Waiting for an Event which will never happen. Poor illusion and sleeping hypocrisy.
Fearful criminals of mass mediocrity, they've got the crazy of fanatics.
Someone speaks about the end of an old millennium,
someone else be trust began age of culture spiritual,
but I think it s the end for ambitions of the men,
cause the illusion of 'em all, make think be what they're not.
Roman Jubileum triumph of illusion. Blood Sectarianism, violence explosion.
Liar Jubileum of cadaver religion I need other things, want to celebrate.
Rise the altar bestial morfic God. Idol Goddog, hail the name Hecate.
Parade of rotten faces stage of holy see.
Business clerical, establishment guided by Polach Pope, holy fucking father.
Pilgrimage of tourism, massification.
Honest indifference, cause the things are the same.
Just event could happen in a different way.
It's the cult of the man, golem automaton.
Instead I celebrate calendar of the moon.
They are concentrate on a fictious date, date will never strike the two thousand,
Priest have built miracles for all believers, even stake and torments for their martyrs.
