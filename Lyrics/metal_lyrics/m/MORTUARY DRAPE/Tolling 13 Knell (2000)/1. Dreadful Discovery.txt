Levitation upon the atmosphere, slowing inside become real my fear.
Out of planet, out of body, find behind the casual veil.
Suicide or vertical laugh or passive accept aware.
I see any entertainment, any role, any alternative ad then death.
God is an invention to satisfy illusions and faith.
In the gnostic year of 29, I've discovered with amazement,
understand if in mists of time, there was a possibility . . .
when right angle became flat, like an encephalogram.
Discovery!
Geometrical initiation, verticalization or zombie, wandering in the planet.
But now I destroy this song, this lyrica and these words,
I'm discovered dreadfully belongs to me.
