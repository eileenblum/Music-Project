Apparition....standing in a frozen reality
Who are you...they must fulfill...must not know
Place that fall...the violet cloud...the shine opaque...
Translucent sight,remembering in confusion,
What has been...what's left undone
And then gone...And then died...down...

Lowering in fading light &amp; seeing the gloomy fog
Is it violation of natural law
Vision of a propitiatory rite
With strange worlds &amp; signs done with moving gestures

Hour &amp; the voices fall in sincronicity
Fall in catalepsy giving vent the entities
Murmuring an answer with stentorian breath
With the smell &amp; colours just the aura of death

Beside.An inverted creation
Around.Psychic infected putreeation
Fall down.In the web of the hanged
Await.In the limb of the damned

Spiritism double larvae of defuncts
Spiritism a cadaverical rest
Spiritism feel the rattle &amp; the sigh
Spiritism lead the path the other way

Disintegrating all spiritual unity
An obsession from a deep &amp; distant recess
The sensation does no more belong to yourself
The possession &amp; fear someone dwells inside you

Door the opens in dangerous psychic area
The obcurrent absorbing force &amp; breath of life
Mortuary ambient while the meeting waits for the deads
Dark procession soon you'll take a part with all them
