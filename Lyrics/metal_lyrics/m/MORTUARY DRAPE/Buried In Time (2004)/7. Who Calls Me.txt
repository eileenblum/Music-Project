From the darkness they came to me
Tormented souls existence
It's a mysterious influence
It's the cold summer of death

Place to remember,old images

Tears on tombstones
The three 6 6 6
Spectres from the past call my name
Unnamed is what I'm seeing

In the charnel house they live
And dwell eternally
And dwell eternally

Meditation that thinks at pre - existence
My damnation is to live in sadness &amp; pain

Expiation we must,understand our way
The cemetary leaves your corpse
In fear &amp; safeness

Time has come to reveal this darkest way
This darkest way

Who calls me,from the charnel house
Spectres,call my name
Who calls me,spectres call my name

It's a mysterious influence
It's the cold summer of death
Place to remember old images
Who calls me
Spectres call my name...No
