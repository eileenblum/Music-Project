When he cannot see the shadow unrelating &amp; slowly
Anymore he's destined to die
Beware of crossing &amp; treading by the light of sun
The burial of the tomb
And then I've seen my double painted in a portrait
Who looks at me from a mirror

Animism The latent part of demons
Animism Manifestation of hidden
Animism Beside double of shadows
Inspired or kill me!!!

I must realize my double before seeing my body image
The dream shows me my "own other" while I am the other
Look at me
A strict relation between Gemini's obsession &amp; 
Anguish of death

Schizophrenic presence stands beyond the door
Alone in deep silence to reflect my trouble
I am walking hanged 'til the dark room
Mother &amp; daughter double of nightmare
She's calling her name

Between the conflict schizophrenic Christ
And his other antichrist
His other in the reign of dream reflects
On water surface
The shadows of the soul of aldrego in the night
Moves around my living body
