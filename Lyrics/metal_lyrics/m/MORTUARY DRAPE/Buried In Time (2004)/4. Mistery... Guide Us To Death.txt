Reciting Mea Culpa,reciting all your sins
You'll just find a perpetual failure of existence

Leaving the silence guide to death

Another sign,at the cosmic doom,
Under the eye,of the silver moon
Children's flesh candles,enlight the way
From perpetual black,in search for a ray
They say Devil will take your sould
They say Devil will leave you in pain
Hiding truth,in a black Vatican book
Changing story,of an ancient reality

Reciting Mea Culpa,no one will hear your voice,
In endless despeartion,no more you'll can rejoice

Leaving the silence,guide us to death

Toucjing the will,of Post Mortem state
Standing again,between life &amp; death
Misguided larvaes dance around my bed
Telling me about the four elements cycle
They say these are just stupid lies
Impossible to retell the voice of one dies
We'll find salvation,into the church
F**king dead children,finding "The Mission"

But I want to know

Torment,voice of evil,leave your dead body,
Mirrir,destroy my mortal figure give me evestrum
Demons,trapped in your kingdom,blow up my body
So millions of vertical rays............

Reciting Mea Culpa,reciting all your sins
You'll just find a perpetual failure of existence

Reciting Mea Culpa,no one will hear your voice
In endless desperation no more you'll can rejoice
