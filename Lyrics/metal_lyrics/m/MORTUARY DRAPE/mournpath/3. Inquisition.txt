Here is the story of a demon scaring all medieval eye, time of dragon, pretty maids and cavalry
Time of reigns, all wrepped in darkness by the cross, ancient symbol of the church and misery
Greedy lust of those men to bring the terror deep inside the souls of those who disbelieved

They decided by themselves to create a game of death
They found out that lust and power could forever live together

Told the people sex was bad like touch your body with your hands
Told the world they were the right ones always standing in the light

Inquisition, burning stakes to the good god
Inquisition, screaming victims to your needs

Seek the virgin through the land sure no one could ever stand
Lock in jail the poor people saying the devil was in them

Was no matter to them all really think you were possessed
They believed the prophecy the church of blood would always reign
But you were the demons, you were the pain, you were the reason for thousands died in vain

Inquisition, burning stakes to the good god
Inquisition, screaming victims to your needs
