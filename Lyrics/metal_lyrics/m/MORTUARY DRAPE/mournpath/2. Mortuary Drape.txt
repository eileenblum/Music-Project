A veil has been lower - beyond is all mistery 
My mind arrive until there - I can search reflected images

Mortuary Drape, symbol of death
Mortuary Drape, dividing veil

Final symbol of material existence 
Invisible world - ocean wealth 
Don't ignore it - don't joke about it 
Because it's a world there and await us

Mortuary Drape, symbol of death
Mortuary Drape, dividing veil

Distorted images, spectres of death behind the veil, great crowd moving, secret bailee of our future, their action is steady, recognized limits unbroken evolution quest in the veil quest in the veil

A veil has been lower - beyond is all mistery 
My mind arrive until there - I can search reflected images

Mortuary Drape, great veil beyond
Mortuary Drape, obituary symbol
