Wizards and witches are kissing the ram of the sabbath, down below, contesting the church of the priest

Black is the sky without moon tonight - down in the town cry children with fright
Universe know there's nothing to do - like centuries by now witchcraft is on you

Black night, black night, black night, here comes the devil's fight
Black night, black night, black night, here ends the witches flight

Depths of the wood where your god can't command - demons and witches and proudly they stand
Dancing and sucking and fucking them all - in front of the master your whole world shall fall

Black night, black night, black night, here comes the devil's fight
Black night, black night, black night, here ends the witches flight

Going in circle, taking their hands - invoking the devil awaiting commands
Exploding the madness and chiming the bell, chanting the song in the honour of Hell
Destroying the humans blaspheming their gods - pissing in holes and treading their cross

Black night, black night, black night, here comes the devil's fight
Black night, black night, black night, here ends the witches flight
