I here is a strange quiet in the cemetary
A foggy curtain cover the place
Slight wind bot creeping
Insinuating on the earth
And entering into the crypts
I don't know if this wind
to feel also alive
But now the burial of spendind day
Has ended here there is no more
Nobody only dead representation
Of necromantical ritual corpse
Without life exhumed knowing
Difficulties process
Too many people believe in it
as supersticious
There are the certains presupposed
Of this resurrection under the wisdom
An'direction of necromancer
Blind resurrected
Will wake up and walking
I retain as possible, entering in the chain
Of the existance between life and death

Zombie

It's a mysterious eternal relation existing
Between corpse and soul
Mystery lies again between
Crosses immobles and graveyard tomb
Unknown doom again
Show the face symbolic of a legend
A legend understood by someone
