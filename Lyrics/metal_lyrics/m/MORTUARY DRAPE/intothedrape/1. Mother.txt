I know you are my mother
Misteriously you ride
Trought seasons and the ages
Join with you across the bades
Into the death
I'll reborn
Union grant as and will claim
She's the queen of the dark

Eternal Mother
Mournful Mother
Freewill Mother

Event of us all given of life
And given of death her shroud
is open wide to recieve our rotten corpse
funereal sign of new life
hearse proceed everyday
crown of flowers toward us

Eternal Mother
Mournful Mother
Freewill Mother
