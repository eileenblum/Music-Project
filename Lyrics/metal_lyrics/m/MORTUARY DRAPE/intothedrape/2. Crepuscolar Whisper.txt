Dark...
Hanged in the plane of no time
Breathing inside is stopped
Changing is all around
Even the trees has got teste

Crepuscolar Whisper feeling nocturnal
Crepuscolar Whisper night's reign begins

Eternal elemental sensation
Natural beat perpetual
Creatures who die and who born
Night's pulsation arise

Crepuscolar Whisper feeling nocturnal
Crepuscolar Whisper night's reign begins

We see forward dark shine
We celebrate the advent
We drink nectar in cup
We dance around bonfire
We hail the "oul priestess"
We open arms to the sky
We ride through fields and woods
We call the ancient truth.

Crepuscolar Whisper night's reign begins
