Once I Read on a tombstone with no name.
Never will know we are existed.

Toll the knell, mantric sound of bell.
Toll the knell, vibration magic spell.

Marble tomb, lapid dolmen tomb.
Tumulo, tombstone without name.

But I comprehend all what I learned...
I killed the son of my time.

Now I listen, the syllable LAM.

In front of ME a singing stone...
The secret and sacred superior arts, 
the wise is concealed.
