Violent lithany from a lost
tombstone forgotten by all
Mournful lithany make flat
mental vibration.

Never born in the year of my birth
I will die just my head
out from the womb
Slowing all centuries are
swallowed by primitive shadows.

My name is Legion, Dictator of Religion

Tonight was born an old Man,
tonight dies a new born child

Secret spell research in a desert
Where the sanctuary is long
far from the eyes...
Profane Equilibrium Lithany effect
Cosmic strikes on material
dimension...Changes

My name is Legion, Dictator of Religion
Never born...In the year of my birth.
