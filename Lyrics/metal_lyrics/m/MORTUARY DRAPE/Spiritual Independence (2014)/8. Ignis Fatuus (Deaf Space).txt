Now you're welcome in the graveyard...
dance of the air around the grave where you will lie.

It's a premonition, hour of the death,
an anniversary of a child that not Rest In Peace.

Enter the cemetery, in the dead of night,
the miasma of the earth, there's a manifestation.

Begin when the rigor mortis, leave the wave of life.

Ignis Fatuus, occult of the nature.
It has been the flame of a stake that never languish.

Shining breath on the mirror surface,
through the resurrected dead.
Regressive remember of foregoing life...
Remorse that does not find peace...
It's too late to repent.
