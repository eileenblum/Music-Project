Self reliance, riding deep down a
corridor.
At the sides there are statures
to bow one's head.
My will lead, my silence to forgive.

Priestess, in liquid shroud,
essence of water...
wet my Spirit!!!!

Only, I've got my lantern.
Only I, put on my cloak.

Only I, I drink from cup.
Only I, I keep the wand of command.

Spiritual independence.
Indulgence...and expiation.
