He turns over in the grave...
Fine person killed but not still dead.

A crime committed by hands of the parasite priest

Inquisitor frantic, fanatic religion,
dizziness, confused
Pope depositary of lies, parasite damage.

A cult of hypocrisy...show me the horror!

Altars alterated realterating reality...
Blinded by all superstitious.
