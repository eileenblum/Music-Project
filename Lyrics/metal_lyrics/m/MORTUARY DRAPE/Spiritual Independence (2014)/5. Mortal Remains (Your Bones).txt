The place for deepest reflections
where the voices are silent
where footsteps resound in the mind
where breath becomes an eternal anguish

Death...only life is buried
and the remains are forgotten under the grave
their essence perspires from the soil
and their sorrows become my obsession

A hundred dancing candles
lighten my walk in the thirteenth path

The crosses around me
I feel their screams tearing my brain
I can hear their litanies

The coffin as last terrestrial abode
the funeral as last farewell
a human interpretation of the end
the key is to not understand

Mortal remains...
A hundred dancing candles
