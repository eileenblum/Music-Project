Choose the darkness and the lights
No surrender to the dogma
Seek the balance of the opposing
There's no way leading in a dimension

In this plane you'll find a king
Don't you look in his eyes
But that wearing upon his head
Keepin' in hands, a wand, a pentacle

My occult abyss, my occult abyss, my occult abyss, my occult abyss

Show the way, that we dare
That we want, that we search
He's the king of the realm
Of I supreme, beyond the abyss
Beyond the abyss

My occult abyss, my occult abyss, my occult abyss, my occult abyss
