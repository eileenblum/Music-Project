We'll take your soul, we'll take your mind
We'll take your fate under the ground
He has begun, unleashed his wrath
Astral bewitchment
Nightmare...

All presents conjured, explosive force and lethal current
Soon you will be fallen into the hand of a sinister doom
The man ruled by four elements - he has been cursed

Tying up power leading to intertness
Day after day, you'll fall in endless nightmare...

Vampyres that lived in astral world bringer of bad luck
The moon is king for the attack - destructive strain
Interior sight becomes aware - a cry of terror

Tying up power leading to intertness
Day after day, you'll fall in endless nightmare...

There's no more time - astral bewitchment
Falling you in trapped - astral bewitchment
Astral bewitchment
Astral bewitchment

But now your will belong to them - they'll get you
The way is lost in mists of time and populated
Shadows that live in have taken him in a sad delirium...
Nightmare...
