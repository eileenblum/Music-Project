Born, never dead, living in the land of the dark
Magic sinister of blood cult of the undead
In sorrow, they live in this dimension, in torment and pain
They wander and steal your soul, your mind and your fate

Those places possessed the colors of those who do not know
Violent and grey are the eternal colors of power
Ritual is surrounded by objects with their energy
Disorded power as interior confusion who evoke them

Demons toward expiation of ancient faults
Materialization is the blood as the egent medium
Become a double astral of who generates
This is a chapter trapped in wise and decay

Horror drape revealed
Wed of dead wrapped at me
