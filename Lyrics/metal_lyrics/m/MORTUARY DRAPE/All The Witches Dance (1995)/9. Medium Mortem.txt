Medium mortem

A candle, as remember a whisper, as recall
Now spiritic seance, a veil in front of his face

Their hands, upon the table - a chain of no return
Falling in a gloom trance - drawing the sleep of dead

Medium mortem - mortuary recall
Medium mortem - larval divination
Medium mortem - lost in his current

An old, calling spirits later will arrive
There's something around some objects, move itself

Must be a deadly gather - a medium, dead here
Voices, feeling sudden they don't leave more the presents

Medium mortem - mortuary recall
Medium mortem - larval divination
Medium mortem - lost in his current

Dark, shadow hover into the room
