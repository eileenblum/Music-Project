Destroy the church of the priest - rising the heathens
Proclaming of the mercy damaging the instinct of man
Fuck the nun and kill the priest - I spit on their message

In capitalism rule pope and state are united
They are the masters of this world deceding on our life
What it means rebellion if I'm not in the dogma
I'm proud to walk and let down in the dark

Wild and free, primordial
Wild and free, primordial
Wild and free, primordial
Wild and free, primordial

There is an animal in me which makes me strong
A latent power calling bestiality
The cult has been tormented but it survived in the time
Wisdom of ancients manuscripts has been all burned

Nature and purity were injured in nomine god
Good and evil are in confront - relative concept
Lucifer is the lord and bringer of light
He is the brother of christ the pettifogger

Wild and free, primordial
Wild and free, primordial
Wild and free, primordial
Wild and free, primordial
