By the fire, by wind
By water, by earth

By the fire, by wind, by water, by earth
Drawing the sign of all exorcism
Chanting the song of the atavic reborn
Detaching from this reality

I'm alone in a grave, interior sight perceived
Desolation and peace, dark and light disappearance

13th way, under will by the wise of a witch
13th way, great comprehend of descent an absord

Veil has been to rend, cast in plain with dead
Current fine pervade, form without shape speaks to me

13th way, under will by the wise of a witch
13th way, great comprehend of descent an absord
