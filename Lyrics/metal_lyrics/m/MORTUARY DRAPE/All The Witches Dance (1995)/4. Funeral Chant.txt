When I met
My dark bell
My eyes so blind

A sign from the dead
Strange shape flow
Self let in

Great meditation
Only sense to live
Get ready to death

I don't want prayers
My existence
Doesn't belong to the priest

Funeral chant - for the dead
Funeral chant - for the dead

Become a spirit
Out of the impostures
Into the silence 
I can pervade

Funeral chant - for the dead
Funeral chant - for the dead
