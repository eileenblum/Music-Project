Invoker of the shadows, read his book of doom
Torment of necromancer, dimension astral wizard
Appear from a vision, a mystic incantation
Not still illuminated, but cover magic way

In a state of prediction, premonition stake
Clairvoyancy his eyes, to get in touch
With occult energies, the rule on them
Awared power, knowing and dare
Wandering spirits disturb his way
What is the karma? The dark has lower
At the edge of way, a thick of colours
Ancestral vision, to feel alone

Torment of Necromancer

You're not alone know, another sphere
Assume a form, as magic medium
Difficult to plain, to win your fear
To meet your will, you'll rule the sphere
