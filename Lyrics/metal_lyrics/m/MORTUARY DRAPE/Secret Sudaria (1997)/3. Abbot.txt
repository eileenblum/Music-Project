Nothing could ever satisfy you
Nothing could ever mesmerize you
Death only could ever please you
Blood only could ever fill you
Worst are your very thoughts
Deep is your inside lust
Dark are your greedy actions
Black is your wicked soul
Looking out in the night
Going to keep on the fight
Bleeding the light at your feet
Evil is all what you need

Abbot, long black power nights of screams
Abbot, on the altar sometime twins
Abbot, with their blood we'll fill your cup
Abbot, with their flesh we'll greed our lusts

Libertinage wildness perversion
Religion in sexual distortion
Satanism rebel reflection
All that in black mass unwinding
Holy host on genitals
Priest and whore united embrace
Cut throat blood stained crucifix
Offertory in blood mixing meal
He wants be your confessor
Masturbation while he's speaking
Sin means nothing to abbey
Conceived life beyond the accepted
