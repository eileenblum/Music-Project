You can feel it, through the night
You can hear it, tells to flight
In the air, nothing sweat
On the earth, the evil death

Standing together in the light of the moon
Our black coven will rise up soon
Closing the job and unleashing the force
Now dig the earth and piss on the corpse

Eternal fire, grant us power
Eternal fire, now is the hour

Cursing united and born of one bomb
Dressed up in black and riding a broom
Lighting the candle beginning the rite
Appearing the demons and smiling at sight

Evil death, rise the dead
Evil death, course of hell

Awaiting the sign from the blackened sky
Pleasure for killing desire to die
Blows from the North wind of the Lord
Screaming for vengeance howling like wolf
