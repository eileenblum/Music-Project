Invisible but active spirits around me
Unknown doom is the secret, the life is handled
By unknown being, they can condition
My existence, can be malignant

If you know the art, they will come to you
Don't call them for sake, or curiosity
Or enjoyment or pass time, but for divination
It's the only way, to choose the way

Occult presences in this world
Visibles exaltation is the key

You can see them, you can hear them
Body is prison, of your soul
All birth all change, all die all regerenate
If you die it's caused by your destiny

If you won't to die, why die you?
Death beginning, of regeneration
And when I'll be dead, I'll become a presence
From the underworld, I shall be presences
