Those tormented souls now tormented our soul
Reincarnation will not be expiation
Will make acute the evil of themselves
Godness know if their damnation will be of yours

Scream for revenge for this anti-being
There is no resurrection there is no peace
Remain to blind at the stake unchained
themselves pain
Wandering in this place between life and death

Desire of pain destructived desire
Desire of lust desire of sucking

Beware envoke this not not appearing
Malignants spirit destructived force
Symbolism of an obscure power
Serving through it. A dark desire.
