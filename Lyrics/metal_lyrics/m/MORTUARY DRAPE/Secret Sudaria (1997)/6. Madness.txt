Together forever we'll kill
Tonight you'll pay the bill
To those who never believed
Too much today you have lived

Kicking and ripping your face
Making you fall in disgrace
Forcing you sit on your shit
Scaring you say, I like it

Madness, laughing and fighting we'll take you to hell
Madness, break all your bones and we'll be well
Madness, break all your bones and we'll be well
Madness, smashing and crashing forever we dwell

Choosing black magic to fight
Always we search our light
Seeking and raping your cunts
Forever and ever we'll hunt

But now our dark time has come
Black work is going to be done
Come on enjoy our bestiality
Come on follow the insanity
