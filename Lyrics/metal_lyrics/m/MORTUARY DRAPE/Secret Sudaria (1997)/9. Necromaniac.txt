When the night is turning black, and all around is silence
Know the time is come, time begin the rite
Pulsating blood in veins, lacerating lust in brain
As you enter the cemetery, and go ahead to the grave

Dark silent figures, braiding up and down the place
Will consent you all night long, to reach and stand the gate
After having done the signs, and the candles burning bright
You begin to dig the earth, till you see the consumpt body

Necromaniac, hell's desire to live in sin
Necromaniac, on this night you will begin
Necromaniac, hells desire to live in sin
Necromaniac, black forever the way you're in

Smell of death is in the air, rotten flesh is what you care
As the quarters the unknown corpse, filling up it all with blood
Now that evil has been fulfilled, you can make all your questions
Lust of wealth sex and power, filling deep that dark desire

But the night is going to end, and you cannot forthee stand
When the sun is rising high, trying to bring the right life
Oh but never never never, could it more sustain
'Cause black power on the earth, is now ready to explode again
