Why is it so hard
To say that you're not okay
We used to talk
Every day in, day out
Nothing to say

I'm in the waiting room
My number tight in hand
Always in the wrong queue
Please put me down
Let me drown

What do you need
In every day life
It's better to burn down
Than fade out
Even when truth
Is killing you
It's better that fading out

Halo of ash and bones
We are not true to truth
Heaven can't wait for us
And on my way
I've gone astray

What do you need
In every day life
It's better to burn down
Than fade out
Even when truth
Is killing you
It's better that fading out

Fuck your new car
And your last wife
It's better to burn down
Than fade out
What will it take
Someday somehow
You will be able
To figure it out

Freedom's such a common word these days
Far to many dreams get washed away
Away

What do you need
In every day life
It's better to burn down
Than fade out
Even when truth
Is killing you
It's better that fading out

Fuck your new car
And your last wife
It's better to burn down
Than fade out
What will it take
Someday somehow

You will be able
