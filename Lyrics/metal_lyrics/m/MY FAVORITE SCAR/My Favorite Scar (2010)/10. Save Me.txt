I
I'm walking round in circles
I need asylum for my soul
I
Tried to find a reason
Why no one cares and no one knows

Hey
Who'd you want me to be
Alright
Alright
Alright
Okay
Hey
What you want me to say
Alright
Alright
Okay

Come save me
Engrave me
Release me

I
I'm waiting for an answer
I am longing to be free
I
Can't break the chain of failure
And now it's raining down on me

Hey
Something's gotta give
Alright
Alright
Alright
Okay
Hey
It ain't no way to live
Alright
Alright
Okay

Come save me
Engrave me
Release me

Come wake me
Enslave me
Unleash me

Come wake me
Enslave me
Unleash me
Come save me
