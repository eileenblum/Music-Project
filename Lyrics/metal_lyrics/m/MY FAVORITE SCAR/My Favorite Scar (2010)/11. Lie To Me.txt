Way down inside
I walk alone
Awake every night
'Til daylight comes
The break downs and cries
So much to hide
It scares me how low
You can go

You lie to me
You lie to me
And I'm holding on
So strong
To what used to be

It's not like I'm not hurt before
Or found someone else
Whom I loved more
But you should've known
That truth is like water
There ain't no place on earth
Where it won't go

You lie to me
You lie to me
I feel I'm all worn put
Too blind to see

You lie to me
You lie to me
'Til I believed one and one
Equals three

You lie to me
You lie to me
And I'm holding on
So strong
To what used to be

You lie to me
You lie to me
I feel I'm all worn out
