I'm all wired
To see the fire
Burning in your eyes

Though I know
You hold your own
To hell with compromise

The weight you bore
I've seen before
Has cut you down to size

You're hating
Complaining
Damn you
For wasting everything

Way back then
You told me then
The light was growing dim

Take this ride
And hold on tight
It just might turn out
Alright
Alright

You're hating
Complaining
Damn you
For wasting everything

With every lie
A little older
Every day
A little colder
Tell you what
You need a shoulder

You're hating
Complaining
Damn you
For wasting everything
