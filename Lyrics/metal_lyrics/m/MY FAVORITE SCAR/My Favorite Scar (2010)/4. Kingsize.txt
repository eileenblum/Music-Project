I saw you face the other day
You wanted everything
You lived your life
Like a broadway play

You chose a crowd
To be alone
House full of people
You did not know

Your smile was made
To fill the screen
Now it's all gone

Out of my arms
Out of my life
Is it worthwile
Living kingsize
Out of my eyes
Out of my life
Is it worthwile?

I read your name
The other day
I thought a thousand times
Of the words you spoke
How they made you choke

You left their world
To be alone
Ain't worth a dime
All that you own

The slomo tears
That hit the sand
Were back in a sec

Out of my arms
Out of my life
Is it worthwile
Living kingsize
Out of my eyes
Out of my life
Is it worthwile?

You left their world
To be alone
Ain't worth a dime

Out of my arms
Out of my life
Is it worthwile
Living kingsize
Out of my eyes
Out of my life
Is it worthwile?
