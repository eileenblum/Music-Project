I forgot my love
Erased everything
From my thoughts

Soon I will be free
Loose and unchained
Finally

Feels better to be lost
Than true at every cost

Lies are on the table
How where you able
What did you know
You pushed me back in the cradle
Made me unstable
Say it ain't so

I stayed in bed all day
Nothing to say
Nowhere to go

Knew it all along
Right from the start
I don't belong

I'm waiting for the rain
To wash it all away

Lies are on the table
How where you able
What did you know
You pushed me back in the cradle
Made me unstable
Say it ain't so

No
Deceit will find no home
Ideals are lost and gone
It's too late

Lies are on the table
How where you able
What did you know
You pushed me back in the cradle
Made me unstable
Say it ain't so
