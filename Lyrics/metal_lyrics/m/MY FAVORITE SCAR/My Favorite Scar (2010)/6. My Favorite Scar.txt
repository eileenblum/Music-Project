You were the brightest
Of all the colors
A world of flowers
Now on your way

Throughout your lifetime
I felt your struggle
I owe you everything
I am today

You're the lines in my hands
I want to be where you are
I wonder where, I wonder why
You're my favorite scar

You're the green in my eyes
And the day that you passed
Never ended you life
You're my favorite scar

As I remember
The house was shaking
And almost twelve years
Have passed since then

The road is endless
And terrifying
My only real home
Is deep within

You're the lines in my hands
I want to be where you are
I wonder where, I wonder why
You're my favorite scar

You're the green in my eyes
And the day that you passed
Never ended you life

Lines in my hands
Green in my eyes
I wonder where
I wonder why

You're the lines in my hands
I want to be where you are
I wonder where, I wonder why
You're my favorite scar

You're the green in my eyes
And the day that you passed
Never ended you life
You're my favorite scar
