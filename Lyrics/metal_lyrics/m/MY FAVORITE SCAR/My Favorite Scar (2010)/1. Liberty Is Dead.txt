See coffins roll
No last call
Time to tell us why

They end up and pay
Every day
In body bags you make

Cause one by one
They're dead and gone
Your hands are bloodstained red
The future blown
Liberty
Liberty is dead

You use up our friends
They're not for real
To you
Tell me what's the sense
You just cut a deal
How does it feel?
At our own expense

Cause one by one
They're dead and gone
Lives hanging by a thread
You don't belong
Liberty
Liberty is dead

You lie
You deny
Gears are rolling
Lives are stolen
We die
We defy
The line you've crossed
Lives are lost
Liberty is dead

Gone
They're dead and gone
Your hands are bloodstained red
The future blown
Liberty
Liberty is dead

Liar

The enemy is you
Poor man
You stand alone
When nobody can
Understand you're a fucking take
Time to pay
Time to awake
