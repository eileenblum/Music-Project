I hate the world around me
I loathe the life that I lead
Engraved in black, all empty
And now it's choking me

It's burning inside like some Jekyll and Hyde

No love lost
There is no love surrounding me
No love lost
Lead the way for I cannot see

I'm lost
My heart is freezing
Last call before I'll stop breathing
There's no good I can believe in

Unable to find a way out of the shell

No love lost
There is no love embracing me
No love lost
In a world full of dirt and sleaze

If you would look inside my soul
You'd see that I've lost all control
On hands and knees I'm crawling
So now I'm lying here bleeding
I'm slipping down low

Like a time bomb I'm ticking away
Dark shades of grey
In my invisible cage

No love lost
There is no love surrounding me
No love lost
In a world full of hatred

No love lost
There is no love, no hope for me
No love lost
In a world full of pain and greed
Pain and greed
