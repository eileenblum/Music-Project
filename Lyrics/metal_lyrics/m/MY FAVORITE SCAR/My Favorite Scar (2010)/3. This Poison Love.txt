Box of memories by the door
Tears and blood stains on the floor
You always had the coldest touch

Time to hurt, time to leave
Time to hate and time to grieve
You never loved me all that much

And I could die just to hear you calling

This love
Has pulled me under the grave
Low
There's not much more I can take
I'm falling faster
Chasing after you

I'm always here
To break your fall
I find the strength to take it all
I'm just to weak to break away

Infinite... black... alone...
Forever with you on my own
I walk a world of cold and grey

And I could die just to hear you call my name

This love
Has pulled me under the grave
Low
There's not much more I can take
I'm falling faster
Chasing after you

This poison love is the only thing
That can save me
Save me from the grip
I've known all along
It's too strong
And the pain is
My favorite part of you

Box of memories by the door
Tears and blood stains on the floor
You always had the coldest touch

This love
Has pulled me under the grave
Low
There's not much more I can take
I'm falling faster
Chasing after you
