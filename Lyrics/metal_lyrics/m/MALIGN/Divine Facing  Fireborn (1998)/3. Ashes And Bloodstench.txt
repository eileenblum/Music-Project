Die life
Live death
Life ashes
Upon the altar
Piety crushed
Beneath weight of our rage
Image of God
Piles of flesh

Ashes!
Darken the sky
Stench of blood
The harlots cry

Guide my path
As I reap
Puny lives
None shall flee
In thine grasp
Cursed tribes
See it fade
Glorious eyes

Ashes!
Burning paradise
Stench of blood
End of lies!
