In vain is thine effort try to see
Your blood is boiling merely at thought
For you might see the greatest fear
Of such greatness it is!

Hast thou yet realized, flea?
Still you are not even near
And you are shivering in the cruelest panic
Of such greatness it is!
As you seek I tell you this
That the splendid beauty would burn your appearance

And more than sweet I say He is
Such is your disgust that you drown in His fragrance

In vain is thine effort, try to see
Your endeavor serves for naught
Even those words are unworthy to His ear
Of such greatness it is!

Hast thou yet realized, flea?
In comparison you are not even mere
And you could not bear the unbearable malice
Of such greatness it is!
