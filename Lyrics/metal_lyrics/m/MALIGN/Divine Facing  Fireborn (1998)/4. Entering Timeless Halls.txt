Beyond all dimensions
Hides a consciousness unknown
Thrown into a life
Where nothing has been seen

Entering timeless halls

Chained into darkness
There's no turning back
What you once did
Is the cause of your new existence
You've now met your Father
Where your soul was meant to travel

Entering timeless halls

Your name was carved in the stone
Which you carry with you
In this land of nothingness...
