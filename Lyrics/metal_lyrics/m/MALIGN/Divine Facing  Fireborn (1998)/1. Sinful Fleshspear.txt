And again
Creation molested
And again
These eyes shed tears of joy
And again
Innocence was raped
Demonic perversion
Crushed their faith again
Hallelujah!

Sinful fleshspear
Penetrating
A thousand children
Contaminating
Infant womb
Pierced
Sinful fleshspear
Penetrating

And again
Lives were stolen
And again
The cross served splendidly
And again
We rejoice
For he suffers
Deep within this sinful void
Hallelujah!

Sinful fleshspear
Penetrating

And again
Night falls
And again
He tucks them in
And again
Another tool used
Stiff limb
Under clergyman's robe
Hallelujah!

...Amen!
