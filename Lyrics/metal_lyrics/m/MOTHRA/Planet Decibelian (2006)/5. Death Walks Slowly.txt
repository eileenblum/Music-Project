so it seems that you're really not alone you're nothing without your
faith your god outside vacuum attached mind to ground by a flesh
imperfect existence death walks slowly say hallo to the one who won't
let you down and better get used to a cold breath of time on your back
silence is it's language we can't understand hear it breaking life line
no chance for glory in existence match no chance for 'cos death walks
slowly what means scream of a new born when it can't talk when it can't
see don't know what it is going to be kill me
