I'll raise up show you my hate my rage I'm a tempted fool that's sick
because of you disease what the fuck is this it ain't a game this way is
dead ended you still debasing me greedy bitch only wants to be happy
insane jealousy drives me mad now i wish i was dead it was so hard to
throw you away why you suspend your suspicious game even one tear here
won't get wasted meet me I'll spit on you face this time while I'm
waiting my eyes are still pretending i make a smile beyond hate and your
pillars are crushing 'cos you are all fake
