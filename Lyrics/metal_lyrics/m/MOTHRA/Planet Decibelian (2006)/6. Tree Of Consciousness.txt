sometimes i would like to be miracle-worker in my dreams with passion i
could create my private world where exists only pain and sin then i will
look down indifferent like a god that's not happiness an invite for
compulsive trip i never liked and excite hunger dirt deliver to everyone
burden of life i wanna become acquainted with god's thoughts and finally
to know what it is like to listen your beggings for life and be silent
when you die a man is here on it's own creating uncertain world so
forgive me 'cos there's nothing to regret when in my dreams I'm raising
hell shining hate in our minds free will's tight up with evil in hearts
we're looking for admire like an actors that's all right but just cut it
out now free to walk on with thoughts to destination that nobody knows
it's an abyss of mindless life we are free to choose moment to die it's
all because a size that i can't fit every time i wake up makes me sick
feel tree of consciousness grows up every fucking day
