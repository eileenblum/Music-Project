leashed like a dog suffer for unwanted life now you take your time like
a freezed soil you protect what is inside carefully go on step forward
movement like a blind man i know your desires just take my hand and
touch the fire exhale the past consider the future go on lead your own
steps the patience is on your side freedom will bury all lies challenge
whole world fit them all swim to right shore go on too much time you
have wasted just watching life fable bout that just died leave your
filthy friary move on shine like a drop in a ray of light you feel like
Satan lives inside you sit in a dark room and feel so powerful but you
are afraid don't wanna loose it again
