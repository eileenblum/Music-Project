Let me take rest and lead me to rising sun, where warm sand and dawn
shreds the darkest night gently noise of waves keeps me in grip not
awaken not asleep so crystal clear stars so close i feel breathless how
come there is no need to scream i remain calm ethereally injected
essence of life from infinity unspoiled place one thing just one thing
just mor y sol my higher place just a few simple trues only a sincere
glitter of eyes 'bout all the rest i don't wanna give a damn only
harmonic beat of hearts only love till the end 'bout all the rest i
don't wanna give a fuck take me to my higher place
