my trigger is unlocked veins full of boiling blood little overloaded
brain you can't mess with my kind aimed shock wave to your head
consciousness disordered it erodes skin now i can't stop it son i laugh
while i see you're pale 'cos of convulses i got for you good advise
don't stumble following that don't mess with my kind rage's flowing down
the walls sweet lick it you want some more as deeper as you get you're
gonna find hate more dirt from my mouth feel tension of your life what
you said fuck you I don't care throw out your lolly pop constantly
pulsing sound you feel it beat down dance floor fags you like it delight
conciliate with sound get right with lights pulsing sound you feel it
dance floor fags you like it conciliate sound right with lights i see it
is melting right here with you why you are not smiling like you used to
