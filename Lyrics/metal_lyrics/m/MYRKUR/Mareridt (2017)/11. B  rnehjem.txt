The demons have always lived inside me
They always watch me, they want to play
But not today, no!
Today you must be like a normal girl

But I could not do what they told me to because I wanted to kill them

Like the demons have told me to do,
I wanted to make sure they all died so I could be alone and nobody would hurt me

But you see once they made me do those things
That you never want to speak about again
And you won't even remember.

That's what they tell you, you don't remember this, no!
But my demons do, they remember everything.

Everything.
And they will never forget what you did to me, never.
