Born at night
Many are called, few are chosen

Open mouth
Swallow up the lakes frozen

Am I adored?
Je suis votre amour am
I a whore?
'Cause you are the drug
Solitary are the things I know
In my garden they leave me alone

Soft as blood
An open heart holds no reason
Slice me up
'Cause your love was steeped in treason

Am I adored?
Je suis votre amour
Am I your whore?
'Cause you are the drug

Solitary are the things I know
In my garden they leave me alone

Sleep little darling
Mother virgin
Darkness serpent come to feed me
Sleep little darling
Bathed in moonlight

On her head a crown of twelve stars
