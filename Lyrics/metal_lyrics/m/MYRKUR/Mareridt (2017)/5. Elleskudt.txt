I nÃ¥leskoven sÃ¥ prÃ¦gtig og stor
En liden elleskudt pige der bor
Af iskrystaller er hendes hÃ¥r
Men nÃ¥r mÃ¸rket kalder isen slÃ¥ skÃ¥r
Little eyes following me now
Little eyes following me now
Han hÃ¸rer kaldet langt ude pÃ¥ fjeld
Den vÃ¦ne fÃ¦stemÃ¸ hun sang sig ihjel
Han lÃ¸b mod skoven for at frelse sin brud
Men fra underverdenen slap hun aldrig ud
Little eyes following me now
Little eyes following me now

Elf-struck
In the pine forest so grand and great
A little elf-struck girl lives
Of ice crystals is her hair
But when darkness calls, the ice breaks to shards

Little eyes following me now
Little eyes following me now
He hears the calling far out on the mountain
The fair betrothed she sang herself to death
He ran towards the forest to rescue his bride
But from the underworld she never escaped

Little eyes following me now
Little eyes following me now
