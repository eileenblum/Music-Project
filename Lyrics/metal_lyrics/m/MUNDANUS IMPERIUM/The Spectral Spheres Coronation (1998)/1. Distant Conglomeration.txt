Show me, guide me, rise cosmic winds
From where I was born, the vison show/
By formations of greatness, through a abyss forlorn,
only one dream prevails only one vision can tell

One vision can tell
the vision will show.

Where am I in here?
A question still remains.
I hunt the answer, far from existence into the
frozen void seek.
Ohh... the flammations are still burning, far
away, far away...

Distant memories locked in senselessness,
confined key of my illusions...
Show me, guide me, the winds are here...!!

May the second universe take me in..!!

Show me, guide me, rise cosmic winds.
From where I was born, the vision will show.
By formations of greatness, through a abyss forlorn,
only one dream prevails only one vision can tell.

One vision can tell.
the vision can tell.

Again the invisible shows...
May the second universe take me in..!!

Show me, guide me, the winds are here..!!

The winds are here....!!
