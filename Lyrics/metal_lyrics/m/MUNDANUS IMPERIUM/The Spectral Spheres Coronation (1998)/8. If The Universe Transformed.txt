If the system (universe) transformed,
my visions would be true.
A crusade (march controlled) without intelligence.

The end or the beginning, no sign can tell.
But the answer do rise with me.
Future dreams, illusions sights,
my visions was never fantasies.
Ten serpents around my powers,
with the universe I transform...

Fallen stars a rebirth for the thousands.
The answer strikes in front of me,
there is no beginning, or is there an end.

My visions are true...
Future dreams, illusions sights,
my visions was never fantasies.
Ten serpents around my powers,
if the system transformed.
