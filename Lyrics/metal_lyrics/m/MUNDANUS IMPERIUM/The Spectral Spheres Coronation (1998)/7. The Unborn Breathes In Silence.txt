On fire... chains of the universe.
In circles slowly fading.
Secrets of time, monuments in smoke,
watching the past pass away.

The unborn breathes in silence,
breeding in silence...

Pale is surface, of wich the future speaks.
Never seen, never touched.

There was no time, there was no pride.
Illusions was it's energy...
The code of life was the end,
but the end is the code of life.

The unborn breathes in silence,
breeding in silence...

There was no time
never seen, never touched.

Chains of the univerce,
in circles slowly fading.
Secrets of time, watching the past pass away.
Memories on fire..!

The unborn breathes in silence..!
