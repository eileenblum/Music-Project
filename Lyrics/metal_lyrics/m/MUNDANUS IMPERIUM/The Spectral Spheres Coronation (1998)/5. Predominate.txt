As a formation,
a cosmic formation my existence exists.
Reflected through a foreign illusion.
I'm a divided presence, still as one,
an extension of the present.

The fulfillment of my entity,
an entrance to entirety.
I've achieved my perfection once again,
through a dimensional transformation.
Controment of the infinite and intelligence,
a spawn of my superior level.
The spiritual as a mind, how extended,
I've been exalted as a vison...

Extant is my creation,
futuristic hidden as wisdom and domination.
Demise, be the embracement, thus my existence
Is completed..!!
