Sitting in my spaceship,
ready for my spacetrip.
It's a long way there,
to where I'm going.

I fly into the galaxy
and merges with the energy.
I must find the key,
to fulfill my destiny.

Starwars, the troops are invading,
pointing at you.
Starwars, I am the skywalker,
fighting for truth.

Yes, I was airborne,
I'll always be your interactive hero,
Here we go again.

Faster than the speed of light,
oh yes. I'm like dynamite.
Living in the dangerzone.
I have to face this on my own.

Starwars, the troops are invading
pointing at you.
Starwars, I am the skywalker,
fighting for truth.

I'm ready
