In the name of the darkness, The Evil dukun start the mentera
By the hand of the devil, the dark revenge now begin
Thou shall run to the nowhere, the blood will always be the witness
No place to hide No place to run.

The dark shadow will always be in your head, 
The dark lesson has come to your by the time,
Revenge must be paid by blood to blood till you suffer
Now you will see the spirit of sakhtyanic doctrine!

In the name of the darkness, The Evil dukun start the mentera
By the hand of the devil, the dark revenge now begin
Thou shall run to the nowhere, the blood will always be the witness
No place to hide No place to run.

The nightmare now begin in you life
The suffer now feel in you mind,
You tears will have no meaning,
You dark journey is now begin

Engkau rasa kenikmatannya, Engkau rasa kesaktianya
Engkau rasa keilmuannya, engkau rasa kesihiriannya
Bermandikan darahnya ditempat yang berpuaka,
Bayangannya sentiasa bermain di fikiranmu

Rasakanlah kekejamannya, rasakanlah kejahatannya
Rasakanlah sekarang pengajaran kesakhtian!!
