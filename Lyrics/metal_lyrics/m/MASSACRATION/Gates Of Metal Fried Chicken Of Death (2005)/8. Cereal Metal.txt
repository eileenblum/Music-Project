Warriors of metal
Let's rise
EstÃ¡ na hora
De papar

Metal is life
Metal is sports
Metal is flexibilidade

[Chorus:]
Metal makes us strong

On the breakfast
With cereal
You got to eat
Metal!!!!

Metal on the lunch
Metal on the dinner
You got to eat
Metal todo dia

[Chorus]

On the war
If you got metal
You got defeat
Your enemies
On the fight
You got the right
To eat metal
To kill the beast

[Chorus]

On the brakfast
With cereal
You got to eat
Metal!!!!

Warriors of metal
Let's rise
EstÃ¡ na hora
De papar

[Chorus]
