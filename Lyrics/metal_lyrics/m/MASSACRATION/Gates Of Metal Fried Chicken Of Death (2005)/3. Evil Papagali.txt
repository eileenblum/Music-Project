I met a bird that
Came From Hell
He iss little green
He is very well

He likes to play
He likes the milk
He likes to fight
He likes to kill

I met a bird that
Came from hell
He is little green
He is very well

He cannot fly
And he is revolt
He don't like me
And then he told

[Chorus:]
LÃ´ro
LÃ´ro quer biscoito!

Evil Papagali
He wants to kill
He ordered me
To puta que pariu

Evil Papagali
He is animal
He got the power
Of heavy metal

He's got the power
Of The furation
You feel the pain
Is the bication

He's master of hell
And we're
Massacration
He wants to speak
To all the nation

[Chorus]

Currupaco feel
The fire
Currupaco feel
Currupaco kill
With power
Currupaco kill

[Chorus]
