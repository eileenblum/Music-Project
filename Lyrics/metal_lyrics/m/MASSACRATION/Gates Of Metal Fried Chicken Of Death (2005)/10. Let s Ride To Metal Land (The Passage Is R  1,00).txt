There's a land so far away
Where the heavy metal plays
People uses always black
There's no place to any gay

Trees alto-falantes
Volume is aways ten
The pets are elephants
And the drink is leberÃ©

To this land there is no plane
To this land there's only one bus
Get a taxi is no way
Headbangers come with us

Right time and right place
Take care don't be late
Or they'll fechate the gate
To promissed land

[Chorus:]
Get the bus to the land of the metal [4x]
A passagem Ã© 1 real

Hey, motorista
Pare aÃ­ que eu quero entrar
Eu tambÃ©m quero ir
Para a terra do metal

Hey, motorista
Se essa... nÃ£o virar
Eu tambÃ©m vou chegar
LÃ¡ na terra do metal
