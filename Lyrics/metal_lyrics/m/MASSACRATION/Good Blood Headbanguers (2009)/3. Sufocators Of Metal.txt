By the moonlight
He'll rise
He's the sufocator
And have a big eye

If ring the bell
Fudeu!!!
He's on your door
And gonna get o que Ã© teu

He is on your house
And he want it all
All the CDs
And DVDs of metal

Enter to your room
He comes pianinho
He takes your disks
And get get de mansinho

This vacilation
Is not a headbenze
He takes your CDs
And emprestate to another friend

He's aproveitation
Suffocation ganaciation
You have to emprestation
All your fuckin' collection

[Chorus:]
sufocator of metal
Ã sufocation
Vai te pegar pelo gogÃ³
Ã sufocation

I emprestate
And you don't devolve
The disk go
And go back esculachado

You motherfucker
You have no shame
You have to burn
In the hell's flame
