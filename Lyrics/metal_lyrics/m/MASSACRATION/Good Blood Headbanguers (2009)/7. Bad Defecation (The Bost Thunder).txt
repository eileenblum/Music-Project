Starts with a strange sensation
a cold suoration
You're feeling no good

I'm tont, I'm dizzy I'm dazed and confused
I think i have abused
of the gulosema

And then you walk in the streets
Your legs are weak
The pressure is down

I'm thinking the demons are coming
They have no mercy
The evil of cÃº

Borbulhation in the stomach
Suoration in the test
Mama help me mama

Ai caramba
The bost thunder

[Chorus:]
Run
Run away to the toilet
Run away to home
Run away to the bathroom
The sign of the bost
