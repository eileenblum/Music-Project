In the name of the fire
In the name of the steel
In the name of the heavy
In the name of the money

The fire is burning
The fire was made in hell
The fire is hot
With fire you fry pastel

The steel has the power
The force of a thousand swords
The steel is cold
Of steel are made the revolvis

[Chorus:]
Without the heavy
We don't have metal
And without the metal
You don't have heavy

The money is the best
The money can buy it all
Inclusive the others
Three elements of metal

[Chorus:]
The fire is burning
The steel is cold
The heavy is heavy
The money is good
