Syen, behold the skies of Huma,
As they bleed above the Kozhuf mountains
The Two Ears summoned to the greatest sorrow
In the regions of my primordial fathers
Syen, regret for me and my soil
Where Svatog forgot his beams of joy
The skies and fields are set for me to dwell in
So shall I be the last son of Byelun
This village of pagan past and heroic battles
Oblivion beside the treats of gods
Poured in the hollow of the centuries
Where the frost becomes painful dream
Tranquility reigns within this lonely place
Syen, behold the skies of Huma
As they bled through my rivers where I sink
Where I sink...
