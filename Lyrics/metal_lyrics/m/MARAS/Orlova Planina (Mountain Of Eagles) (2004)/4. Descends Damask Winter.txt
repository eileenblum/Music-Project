Erstwhile the realm of erratic storms
The passing fragile timeless years
Clad within silence along the pale sky
The biting sorrow tolls in my mind
Fury of darkness ends in the mist
To the mountains increased in my heart
Unknown vast of broken ice
Coldest and blackened in a bleeding shadows
Descends Damask Winter
Descends Damask Winter
Shades of drifting pain are coming for me
Figment of lies chasing my dreams
Illusions scream under mirror ice as
Waves of sorrow wash at your heart
Fury of darkness ends in the mist
To the mountains melting in my heart
Unknown vast of broken air
Coldest and darkened in a breathing shadows
Descends Damask Winter
Descends Damask Winter
