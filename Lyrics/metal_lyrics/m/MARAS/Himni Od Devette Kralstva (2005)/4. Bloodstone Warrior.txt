He bestows the black elements of Sun
To the Decadents, creators of his thunder heart
As pleasure of behavior, sufficient for us
Embodiment of those, sinners of thy kingdom come
The empty intrinsic I've lost
Is betraying within the hands of peace
Elementary devotion as
Tranquility that dies in subtle spirits
The falling tears of dying devotion
Erase the trails left to rot in sand
They've gone by the winds in depths
Where bloodstone we once have made
Black ravens cover the whitest of our fields
The grace and the sin in famine passed their path from here
Descending from the solar ring, the circle of stars and tide
Upon the everlasting beams, the flaming horse on which he rides...
...in war!!!
