We live a fucking lie!

Everything I never thought I would be
Is everything that's taken hold of me
I look in the mirror and what do I see?
Two lifeless eyes staring back at me

Fuck!

How can I trust myself with this crooked smile?
I'll never know
What it's like to be always alone
So alone
Surrounded by honor code

Fuck school and education
False ideas and they took our vocation
From all the lies we're set to die
The men are corrupted, will they restrain me?

We live a fucking lie!

You tell me over and over again
"No need to die, son. Just fall in."

Fall in line, live a lie
Lose yourself, never die
Fall in line, live a lie
Lose yourself, never die

Fuck!

One day I'll smile
Pretend that I am the same
One day I will lose myself
Someday I will play your game

Fall in line, live a lie
Lose yourself, never die
Fall in line, live a lie
Lose yourself, never die
