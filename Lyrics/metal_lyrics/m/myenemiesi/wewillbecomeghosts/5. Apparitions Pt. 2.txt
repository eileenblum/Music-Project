Something in the water
We're so capable of the ugliest things
Could you believe I've been a monster?
Holding on to anchors just to watch you sleep

We will become ghosts
And float over this city
With nothing but our memories
We lost
We lost ourselves in anger
We filled our mouths with hateful tone
We lost
We lost it all

Now our story has been told
The blood's still warm but our hearts are cold
We are but images
Fading like memories
Mirror, mirror
I've forgotten your name

We will become ghosts
And float over this city
With nothing but our memories
We lost
We lost ourselves in anger
We filled our mouths with hateful tone
We lost
We lost it all

Mirror, mirror
I've forgotten your name
We lost it all
Thank God I remember the face
