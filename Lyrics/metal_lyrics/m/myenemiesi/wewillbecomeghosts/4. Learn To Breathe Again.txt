You're used to failure and go where no one can find you
Or you feel weight on your shoulders
You take a step back and let me show you
You can crave this world if you want to

Every day is crashing down on you
And you feel so alone
Well I'll tell you this, my brother
Things are never as dire as they seem
You took a photo hoping it'll last
You will never break apart now

You're running out of air
You're searching everywhere
Your troubles are roaring
Nowhere to go and you're so far from home
And when you feel like
You'll never make it out alive
I'll be there

I'll light the lantern
That guides you home
I'll light the lantern
In the darkness
I'll light the lantern
That guides you home
To safely to sea

I'll light the lantern that
Guides you to your destination
All you need, all you need is a little love
One reason to believe in tomorrow

If you believe in anything
If you believe in anything
If you believe in anything
If you believe in anything
If you believe in anything
If you believe in anything

Just one more night
I swear you'll bend your game
Just one more night
I bet it'll go away
But there's still yourself to love
I couldn't sail until you're gone
I know this life is just a drought
But brother, you are impatient

You're running out of air
You're searching everywhere
Your troubles are roaring
Nowhere to go and you're so far from home
And when you feel like
You'll never make it out alive
I'll be there

You're running out of air
You're searching everywhere
Your troubles are roaring
Nowhere to go and you're so far from home
And when you feel like
You'll never make it out alive
I'll be there
