Roll out the red carpet
This is the beginning
Its opening night
And you're on display
The cameras are rolling
You have their attention
You're ready to show them all
What you can do
But Who is really pulling your strings?
The puppetry so elegant
You think they'll never know

The curtains drawn their eyes on you
And you stand there waiting
Silently for your cue
They're all here waiting for you

Will you cut the string from your wrist?
Or will you get caught up in it?
I doubt you know who you are
You speak with two tongues
One to pull you in
And one to make you run

So seamlessly you separate yourself
From everything you used to be
You're just a fake!

You're playing the role of a lifetime
You always wanted the world
I see straight through your bullshit
To be watching your every move

The curtains drawn their eyes on you
And you stand there waiting
Silently for your cue
They're all here waiting for you

Will you cut the string from your wrist?
Or will you get caught up in it?
I doubt you know who you are
You speak with two tongues
One to pull you in
And one to make you run

The curtains fly open
And you're blinded by the light
As they blankly stare the color
Quickly flees your face
And you realize
You're just a fucking joke to them

The curtain closes
The show is over
You've been exposed
The lies you told to get there
And everything that you stole
