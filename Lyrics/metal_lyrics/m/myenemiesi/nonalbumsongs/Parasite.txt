Bound and tortured I'm as good as dead
My broken spirit can't take the punishment
Please pull me out before there's nothing left to save
Trapped in a horror, there is no escape

Night after night, real lies through dead eyes
Will it end or magnify?
A crushing thought, a heavy weight
How much more can I really fucking take?
We know the secrets, no means to an end
The feeling dies, my heart's not mine
Right after I come inside your web of lies

I don't need you
I can bury my body just like yours
You won't fuck with my head anymore
I don't need you

Stop this piercing voice
It keeps me up in the night
All these words feed on my brain
Like a parasite

Night after night we stare blank into the world
I want to feel alive, I just want my life to be mine
But you suck my soul like a leech on a wound
The feeling dies, my heart's not mine, get out of my mind

I don't need you
I can bury my body just like yours
You won't fuck with my head anymore
I don't need you
Tell me, how are you sleeping?
Will the guilt drown your feelings
When you find the skeletons at your door?

How can I face this fucking world
If I can't face myself or you anymore?

I can bury my body just like yours
I can bury my body just like yours
I can bury my body just like yours
You won't fuck with my head anymore

Drowning you out
I'm not listening anymore
You've pulled me down enough
There's nothing left to love

I don't need you
I can bury my body just like yours
You won't fuck with my head anymore
I don't need you
Tell me, how are you sleeping?
Will the guilt drown your feelings
When you find the skeletons at your door?

I don't need you
