Tonight I feel like self-destructing
Destroy myself and start again
The final culmination of everything I never said
I'm coming undone
And I won't rest 'til I'm dead and gone
The pain you caused
I choke on my own tongue
My words, they don't come out at all

Bloodshot eyes
Your hands are shaking
And you don't know why
You do this all to yourself
Steady your breathing
It's almost over now
You're just a face in the crowd

It's almost over now
You've gone and thrown me away
I'm hoping all of these scars
Will never see the light of day

I torture myself
EVERY DAY
I SEE YOUR
FUCKING FACE
I suffer in silence
With all these words still stuck

Bloodshot eyes
Your hands are shaking
And you don't know why
You do this all to yourself
Steady your breathing
It's almost over now
You're just a face in the crowd

Keep it togetherâ¦

All I have left, ripped from my flesh
Leaves my heart torn asunder
BITCH

I'm searching the words to say this
But I'm nodding, totally thoughtless
A million pages of letters discarded
Scatter the room, but I'm just getting started

Bloodshot eyes
Your hands are shaking
And you don't know why
I do this all to myself

Bloodshot eyes
My hands are shaking
And I don't know why
I do this all to myself
I've been searching for words to say this
But I'm lonely, exhausted, tired, and thoughtless
A million pages of letters discarded
Scatter the room but I'm just getting started
