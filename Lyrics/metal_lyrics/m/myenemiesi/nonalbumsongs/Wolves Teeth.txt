[feat. Davis Ryder of Immoralist]How can you stand the sight of your own face when
You don't even feel at home inside your own skin?

The worms crawl in and out of your ears
Telling you exactly what you want to hear

I've sprawled across this broken glass
You dragged me by my own feet
I feel the blood rush down my back
The pieces tearing at me

You were knocking at my door
Like so many wolves before
Trying to let you in
You know I've spent all these nights alone
Learning to walk again

Maybe one day you'll pick up all the pieces
That you left along the way
The mess you made is suffocating me

Just go
Leave me here with my empty thoughts
As these walls close around me
Get out
I don't care what you need to say
Just get the fuck away

You were knocking at my door
Like so many wolves before
Trying to let you in
You know I've spent all these nights alone
Learning to walk again
Trying to let you in
You know I've spent all these nights alone
While you're dancing on your toes

If you step back and watch your actions unfold
You'll see the demons that you breed
And how they fuck with my soul
If you step back and watch your actions unfold
You'll see the demons that you breed
And now you'll burn with them

As I pull these knives out of my back again
It's time that someone says what needs to be said
Greedy fucking bitch
All these days and nights I spend alone
Unfaithful
You'll never fucking learn from anything
You're worthless

Just go
Leave me here with my empty thoughts
As these walls close around me
Get out
I don't care what you need to say
Just get the fuck away

You were knocking at my door
Like so many wolves before
Trying to let you in
You know I've spent all these nights alone
Learning to walk again
Trying to let you in
You know I've spent all these nights alone
While you're dancing on your toes
