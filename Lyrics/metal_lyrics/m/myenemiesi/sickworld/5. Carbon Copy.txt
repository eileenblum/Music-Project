All lined up like cattle waiting for slaughter
What the hell are you doing or does it even fucking matter?
They tell you, you listen, blindly you give in
And follow their every fucking move

Another face
Exactly like the rest
The very ones I've grown to hate
You're nothing more than a carbon copy
Broken dreams
Controlling everything around me
And I don't want to be just another
Mindless, frail machine

Masks on their faces to hide the ugly, tasteless
Shallow, miserable person they've become
Obsessive fanatic, you're made of plastic
You're only fooling yourselves

We won't be swayed
No, we won't be tempted
We won't be swayed
We won't be tempted
We'll never change

Another face
Exactly like the rest
The very ones I've grown to hate
You're nothing more than a carbon copy
Broken dreams
Controlling everything around me
And I don't want to be just another
Mindless, frail machine
Mindless, frail machine

Lose yourself
Abandon hope
Give in to them
Get rich then die alone

Lose yourself
Abandon hope
Give in to them
Get fucked then die alone

Another face
Exactly like the rest
The very ones I've grown to hate
You're nothing more than a carbon copy
Broken dreams
Controlling everything around me
And I don't want to be just another
Mindless, frail machine
