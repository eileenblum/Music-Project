Yeah, my god

You're quick to twist the words around to make it seem
Like I'm a dick for trying to do the right thing
You're better than this
Begging for bitch ass, pity party, pitiful bullshit

Yeah, begging for the pitiful bullshit

So when the feeling dies I'll be satisfied
No more drowning in your wasted, toxic lies

Lies, toxic lies, are you ready to die?

Lies, toxic lies, are you ready to die?
I know I won't be satisfied till I bleed you dry

Dirt on your face from digging your own grave
Fated, it's too late, you can't be saved
Blood on your hands from the ones you betray
You're standing knee deep in the shit you create

So when the feeling dies I'll be satisfied
No more drowning in your wasted, toxic lies
So when the feeling dies I'll be satisfied
You'll be drowning in your wasted, toxic life
Wasted, toxic life

And you can cross my name off your list
The bridges that you burned, the people you made sick
I know you couldn't fucking wait to kick the dust up
If you're looking for death, motherfucker, I'll hook it up

Yeah, are you fucking ready?

Lies, toxic lies, are you ready to die?
I know I won't be satisfied till I bleed you dry

So when the feeling dies I'll be satisfied
No more drowning in your wasted, toxic lies

So when the feeling dies I'll be satisfied
No more drowning in your wasted, toxic lies
So when the feeling dies I'll be satisfied
You'll be drowning in your wasted, toxic life
Wasted, toxic life

Wasted, toxic lies
