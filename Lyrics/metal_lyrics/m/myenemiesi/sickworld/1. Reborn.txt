Every mistake, everything I hate
Heavily loaded and ready to retaliate
The voice of my shadow calling out my name
Telling me I'm entitled to every fucking thing
Get the fuck up out my face, the fuck out my way
I tear though anything, nothing left in my wake
Yeah, I'm the thorn, the demon reborn
The filthy, rotten flesh of the dead fully restored

Trapped inside until it changes

I am the worthless, I am the hated
I am the one that you created
I am regret for words unspoken
I'm every promise that you've broken
I don't need you to save me
I am the wicked, I am the chosen
I am the hand that drags you down to nothing

Why waste my energy? Conscience erased
Besides, I think I've realized I like the sulfuric taste
There's a digging in my stomach that's crawling up the sides
The feeling of betrayal by shifting eyes
Follow me down to the deepest part of your mind
Every tortured thought you've ever had I'll bring it to life
There's nothin' gonna stop me, the spirit divine
You'll be lucky, motherfucker if you make it out alive

Paralyzed, I can't escape it

I am the worthless, I am the hated
I am the one that you created
I am regret for words unspoken
I'm every promise that you've broken
I don't need you to save me
I am the wicked, I am the chosen
I am the hand that drags you down to nothing
Down to nothing

There's a few others in here with me
But I don't need saving
I can feel all my insides decaying
But I don't need saving
There's a few others in here with me
But I don't need saving

I am the worthless
The one you created
Every promise you've broken
Yeah, I am the chosen

Trapped inside until it changes
I'm paralyzed, I can't escape it

I am the worthless, I am the hated
I am the one that you created
I am regret for words unspoken
I'm every promise that you've broken
I don't need you to save me
I am the wicked, I am the chosen
I am the hand that drags you down to nothing

I am the worthless
To nothing
The one that you created
I don't need you to save me
I am the hated
The hand that drags you down to nothing
