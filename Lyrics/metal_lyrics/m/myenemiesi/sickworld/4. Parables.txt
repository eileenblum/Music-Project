Do you know the difference
Between being alive
And letting your heart burn out?
Breathing becomes a chore
And these empty spaces
Leave nothing but room for doubt
Inside your head

You've been trying to fill these pages
But nothing at all comes out
You've written your ending
But now you're trapped inside

Every thought of you just pushes me down

You live your life like your bones are glass
Closed eyes for fear, the world may move to fast
You're breaking under the weight
But it makes us who we are
Every time you think of me
I hope you choke on your own apathy
You'll figure it out one day
Did I make you who you are?

Just hold your tongue
Because it's every time you speak
You break your neck
Tripping over your own words
You live your life in fear

Was your heart still beating?
Were you even thinking
When he fed lines to your head?
When he found his way into your bed?

You live your life like your bones are glass
Closed eyes for fear, the world may move to fast
You're breaking under the weight
But it makes us who we are
Every time you think of me
I hope you choke on your own apathy
You'll figure it out one day
Did I make you who you are?

It makes us who we are
Did I make you who you are?

When you wake up, do you still dream
Or just live like the stories you tell me?
I hope you know that some people still care
It's not me but I know they're out there

Does the world just keep spinning
When you're lying flat on your back?
Are you sure that you're even awake?
Do you know that you're my only mistake?

You live your life like your bones are glass
Closed eyes for fear, the world may move to fast
You're breaking under the weight
But it makes us who we are
Every time you think of me
I hope you choke on your own apathy
You'll figure it out one day
Did I make you who you are?

When you wake up, do you still dream
Or just live like the stories you tell me?
I hope you know that some people still care
It's not me but I know they're out there
