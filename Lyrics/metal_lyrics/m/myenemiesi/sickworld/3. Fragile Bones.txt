I need to let go
You're all living for nothing
It's time to be myself and not a clone
Go

Everyday it's the same thing
Wake up, fall in line and let the devils bury your mind
It's a sick world and you're just a pawn
I'll never be like you, fuck your destiny

I don't really know what you want from me
I won't degrade myself and bleed
Another day, another lie, another reason to die
Another day, another lie, you'll worship anything

I've lost more friends to the world than I care to admit
The thought of biting my tongue leaves me choking on it
Don't say you know what it feels like
Another day hiding from real life

They say I'm not alive

Your fucked up fallacies mean nothing to me
You can't play someone who's not in the game

Everyday it's the same thing
Wake up, fall in line and let the devils bury your mind
It's a sick world and you're just a pawn
A lifeless insect just waiting to be stepped on

I've lost more friends to the world than I care to admit
The thought of biting my tongue leaves me choking on it
Don't say you know what it feels like
Another day hiding from real life
Your eyes roll into the back of your head
You can't see the bridges burning while you're standing on them
I can't say I know what it feels like
To live a life without a spine

And you call yourself a friend?
You don't understand why I'm nothing like them
I don't need to satisfy your pathetic ideas
I bow down to no one

Fuck this world

Fuck this world

I've lost more friends to the world than I care to admit
The thought of biting my tongue leaves me choking on it
Don't say you know what it feels like
Another day hiding from real life
Your eyes roll into the back of your head
You can't see the bridges burning while you're standing on them
I can't say I know what it feels like
To live a life without a spine
To live a life without a spine
