Eyes of a fiend
I can make you just like me
Eyes of a fiend
I can make you just like me

I know you feel you want to disconnect
As you feel the cold ghostly hand tightening around your neck
The slime, the disgust in the person you see
Summoning everything you ever wanted to be

Take it
I know that you want it
Take it
You could have everything

You could be
So much more than what you let them see
When you're ready to stop settling
I can show you how to let it in
Seeing through the eyes of a fiend (eyes of a fiend)
I can make you just like me

Eyes of a fiend
I can make you just like me

And when you're ready for it
Try your best not to panic
Past the point of return, voices obscured
The image is all blurred

Eyes of a fiend
I can make you just like me (just like me)
Eyes of a fiend
I can make you just like me (just like me)

Take it
I know that you want it
Take it
You could have everything

You could be
So much more than what you let them see
When you're ready to stop settling
I can show you how to let it in
Seeing through the eyes of a fiend (eyes of a fiend)
I can make you just like

You could be
So much more than what you let them see
When you're ready to stop settling
I can show you how to let it in
Seeing through the eyes of a fiend (eyes of a fiend)
I can make you just like
I can make you just like me
