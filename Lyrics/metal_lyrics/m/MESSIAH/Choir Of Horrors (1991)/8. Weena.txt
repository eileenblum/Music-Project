I'm afraid of the night, helpless
The forest is drenched in sinister fog
My home is in the mountains, without civilisation
I have no contact to the outside world

A dog is barking in the night
His faithful eyes gleaming, he stands on the porch

I take him in and he grows stronger
Guarding me against the creatures of the wood
No hunting without him at my side
I can't imagine life without him

More and more, his body's changing
His coat gets shaggy and his muscles bulge
He shows hatred and aggressiveness towards me

Bloody, raw meat is what he wants
Me, I'm meat too, that's what he sees
Too late, no chance to kill my creation
I'm perishing in agony and pain
