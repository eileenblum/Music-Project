Babylon you must die
In god's fire
You can't survive
Hell has arrived

Once a thriving town, now rubble and ashes
Hungry homeless human, sitting on ruins
Helplessly crying in the night, where is the redeemer
Bloody rivers flow through the dust, no hope in sight

Just to survive - murder everyday
No remorse - that's our way
