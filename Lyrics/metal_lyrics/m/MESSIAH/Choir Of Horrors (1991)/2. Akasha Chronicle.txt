You were just twenty years old
When you were run down by a car
We were all deeply filled with sadness
When we were told of your death

You always were a happy person
But respect for death
It was shown in your lifestyle
Tell us about your trip into eternity

After I was supposedly dead
I heard a loud humming
I moved very fast
Through a long dark tunnel
I felt blackness and darkness
Then I found myself outside
Of my own body, but still close by
And I observed the attempt revive me

I experienced eternity at first
Just as I had always thought it would be
Angels, ghosts and other creatures came
They greeted me and showed me the way

The picture faded, more nd more
And the angels lost their wings
A light appeared, the true light
An unbeleivably bright, white light

I landed on a big lawn
And felt the pure joys of life
Saw a lot of my relatives
And I was taken through the 'hall of memories'
I had to evaluate my life
And I came to a gate
The boundary between the life on earth
And the new life, yet to come

I must return to my physical body
And try to live my earthly life
Through this experience my life is touched
My outlook on death and on life

Death is a second birth into the invisible astral world
From where the soul stepped down into a visible body
