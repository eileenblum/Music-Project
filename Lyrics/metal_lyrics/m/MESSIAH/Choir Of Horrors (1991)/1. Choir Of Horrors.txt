Agnus redemit oves:
Christus innocens patri
Reconciliavit peccatores

A lamp the sheep redeemeth:
Christ, who only is sinless
Reconcileth sinners to the father

It's written in the truth
I was crowned - I went down
Another man is raised - far too high up
A new emperor
Let him fear ruin! For in the scars it is written
Until he's shaken by the resonance of the seven trombones

Bel Marduk - glory to him by Chaldaeus

Later I saw an angel descending from the sky
One with great sway and the earth lit up
With his elevation and enlightment

The sinner was despised

Volupatis avidus - magis quam salutis
Mortus in anima - et ustus fortiter

I heard another voice amidst the lightning in heaven
Abscond Babylon and you won't share in the sin
And you won't partake in the pain

And as they glorified themselves and roused excess
To the same dreadful degree, they were overcome
By torment and despair

Up to heaven!

Os eius vias malus sederam elatus
Obdurat imperat ira vehementi sors turpissima

And I heard another cry from all of the trombones of retalia-
tion
Abscond babylon and you won't partake in pain

Babylon - pray for the choir of horrors
Babylon - choir of horrors

Then I heard it from the heart of the city
I reign as a queen and I'm not a widow
Never will I feel regret, never

Babylon - pray for the choir of horrors
Babylon - choir of horrors

And so the pain will come
Plague, sorrow and hunger

In just one hour, you - might Babylon
Will perish in fire
