Shadowed and veiled in various colors
Maiden worthy of love so rich in joys
Let her please you with devilish golden hair
As the witch for a faithful dead may the unknown bless you

Most beautiful one - witch!
Endless precious jewel - heretic!
Pride among virgins - confess!
You rose of the world - and die!

Holy inquisition seized by desire
Young men and women for a most bitter fate
Hundreds and then thousands in the name of the holy church
Her messiah dies now, not on the cross but by the flames

Most beautiful one - witch!
Endless precious jewel - heretic!
Pride among virgins - confess!
You rose of the world - and die!

Oh my god - where are you now?
Is this the temple of messiah
Or is this the gateway to hell?
There are not enough places in heaven
Forgive them, they know not what they do

I don't bemoan my wounds of flames
breathe to the smoke against my soul
I'm one of thousands, you are the next
But think! There are not enough places in heaven!
