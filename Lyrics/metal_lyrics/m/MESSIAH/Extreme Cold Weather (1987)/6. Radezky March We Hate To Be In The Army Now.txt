Drowning our soul, mans' power turns to a childs' game,
we're all stupid, fucking cold, only womens love helps us through this gate. 
We hate to be in the army now

Learning to destroy ourselves, please hear the wise man screaming why,
this story will never end, war covers us because we're to shy.
Sit down and let it be

We hate to be in the army now

Don't support those laws of military, never trust a soldier, he's a killer
Enjoy your wonderful time of liberty, never touch a gun, it's a liar.

We hate to be in the army now
