[Dedicated In Hate To Pope John Paul II]

(Do you think) what the church does is right?
Their deeds are the way to the light?
But the church does profit of prejudice and war,
they claim they're good but they're rotten to the core.

Pope John sucks.

The church has good ideas, but most of it are lies,
instead of giving it to the poor, pope John goes and flies
They speak of peace, but they really want hate,
fuck off John Paul, go and masturbate.
