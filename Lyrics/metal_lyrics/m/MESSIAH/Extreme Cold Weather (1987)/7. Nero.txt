Nero the hero, god of full corpses
Nero, centurio, lost in madness,
walked in the shadows of broken minds,
saved his power in the name of lies,
enslaved girls, he's a destructor by his hand. 
Burn down this town, burn down this Rome.
Nero, master of lied enrichements,
Nero, finder of bad sound harmonies,
composed titles for wonderfully done things,
found the answers, the things he sung
Were about the realities of his next strike.

Sadist of his own empire, will be his own messiah,
loser of his own mind.

Aaaaahh my little Rome, enjoy my flames,
I sing and pray for you and your child,
fall to ashes for my new empire,
It's my greatest lyric now.

Burn down this town, burn down this Rome.
Look at me, people of Rome,
It's the sweet resurrection, after the celebration
It's my lustful work, that all these christians are rotten now.
