Do you need beer to have fun
Don't you know that drugs do con?
Fellowship we need to unit us all,
no use to kick each others balls
Mosh a peaceful way,
violent brutal thrashers don't need to stay. 
Enjoy yourself, non-violent moshing instead of fighting,
Enjoy yourself

We don't care if black or white
All together for a pacifistic fight 
We fight for freedom and liberty,
but against destruction and brutality
Hatred racism and arms race, 
vivisection, fur coats are humanitys disgrace.

Enjoy yourself, non-violent moshing instead of fighting,
Enjoy yourself
