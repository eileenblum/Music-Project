With all my long hair, I don't need a hat to wear 
Extreme cold weather is reigning outside, 
the wind is blowing and the frost does bite. 

I hope I won't freeze my toes off, 
cause then I will have to cough 
an icycle's hanging from my bum, 
and there lies my neighbours frozen mum. 

The thermometer's below zero, 
don't try to be a hero 
by running to scool 
Now you're frozen dead you fool. 

Extreme cold weather is freezing my blood, 
I'd always have summer if I'd be god. 
Now is april and you have thawed, 
you won't step out again into the cold. 

It's sunny, funny and really warm, 
and my body feels like reborn.
