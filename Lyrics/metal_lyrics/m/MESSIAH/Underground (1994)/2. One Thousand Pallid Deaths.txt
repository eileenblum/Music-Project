I make my mind feel empty
The sleep is drawing near
Then I pass into the world
That so many fear
I step inside the temple halls
A wet fog like the breath
Of a dragon is surrounding
My body lifts me... away

One thousand pallid deaths
Inside these halls
One thousand pallid deaths
I hear their call

Away through the halls where
Bricks are made of bones
And the floors are made of bloody
Slowly breathing flesh
Then I see a throne
All covered with dust
It drags me closer, oh will I dare?
But suddenly, I wake up...

One thousand pallid deaths
Inside these halls
One thousand pallid deaths
I hear their call

So step inside (the temple halls)
A wet fog (like the breath)
Of a dragon (will surround)
Your body (and lift you... away)
