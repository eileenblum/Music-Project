Breeding the fire
So strong within
Flames burning higher
Burns through my skin

Veiled I search the fulgency
But I dream eternally
Though I'm fire, no pain I feel
I won't wake up this is too real

I feel no sorrow
Though I'm deceased
Joined with this new world
All is so real

I don't know what I will see
But I know that I feel free
I am dead, in a dream
Stop the time and let me sleep

Roaring landscapes of hell
I am one with the angels that fell
Lead me through fire and stones
To the temple with bricks made of bones
