"Days of glory
Left in the past
This perfect day
Will be the last
As time has come,
Forefathers blessed
Soon to join you
I'll lay to rest..."
(Written on a runestone from the year 997 A.C.)

I hail the old northern gods
So help me thou mighty ones
Odin, tyr and thor
Lead me through my final war

Deep in my mind I
Sail across the sea
Though now I ride to
My final battlefield

I'll meet my destiny

Hail to our gods
To valhall we ride
With our swords held high
We're now prepared to die...
