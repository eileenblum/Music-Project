Oh, fuck I hate these people
I hate these smiling fools
They live their lives in sorrow
But claim their lives are cool
I tremble out of anger
When I hear them speak
They won't survive tomorrow
Because they are too weak

Tomorrow is another day
Tomorrow is the day of joy
Tomorrow is the day of sin
When the strong will take over the world

Tomorrow is the day of joy
Tomorrow is the day of sin
Of sin...

They're preaching in their churches
They fill their heads with lies
they preach about a dead man
Since long time crucified
And this holy bible
Why won't they let it go?
It's just a book of stories
From thousands of years ago

I live in filth
I live in sin
I live in lust
I live in joy

Tomorrow is another day
Tomorrow is the day of joy
Tomorrow is the day of sin
When the strong will take over the world

Their holy god jehova
he is both deaf and blind
So he won't hear their prayers
They will stay left behind
Why can't they realize that
Their faith will soon be dead
The end of their religion
The world will soon be dead

Oh, fuck I hate these people
We hate these smiling fools
They live their lives in sorrow
But claim their lives are cool
We tremble out of anger
When we hear them speak
They won't survive tomorrow
Because they are too weak

I live in wealth
I live in strength
I have no sorrow
I have no pain

Tomorrow is another day
Tomorrow is the day of joy
Tomorrow is the day of sin
When the strong will take over the world

Tomorrow we will wake our dreams
Tomorrow is the day of wealth
Tomorrow is the day of lust
The day when only strong will survuve
