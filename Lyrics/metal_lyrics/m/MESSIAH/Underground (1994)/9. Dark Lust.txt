Preparing for a dark ritual
I'm waiting for the darkness to fall
I'm beginning when the hour is late
With this ritual I'll open a gate
Lilith, the queen of succubus
Hear me when I'm calling your name
Send me two of your daughters:
Sin and lust... so please me

Succubus
I share your sin
Straight from my heart
Deep from within
Come through the dark
From gamaliel
And when you're through
I'll make love to you

Longing for your sex beyond sane
Success in evocate I have gained
Caressing your body makes me high
My mind is like an eagle in the sky
Screaming out in lust when you suck me
Loosing in the battle for control
The end of this fruition draws near
Now we have to leave here

I share your sin
Deep from my heart
Come let us travel
Through the dark
The spheres in the sky
You lead me through
In gamaliel
I'll make love to you

My sexual desires
Is now brought to life
The morality's killed
By my perversity
I'm free from all lies
As morality dies
In deep harmony
I fulfill my desires

The pleasure's world...
And endless world...

My sexual desires
Is now brought to life
The morality's killed
By my perversity
