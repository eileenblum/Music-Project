You're speaking of 84
The old times that you adore
But, where were you at that time
Seven years old?

You say that you're one of a kind
And think that you're far from the trends
Well, I've got news for you,
You're creating one more

Open your closed eyes now
Lock up your ears
Release your narrowed mind
And see things clear
You're trapped in the underground

No, there is only one way,
And that is your way

You have such a boring closed mind
Either it's white or it's black
So, you make up your own rules
About 'true' and flase

So get out of my sight
I'm laughing too much about you
So, try stand in my way
I'll for sure move you

Open your narrowed eyes now
Lock up your ears
Release your closed mind
And see things clear

'Nothing against the underground scene itself. Juct a kick on
those who bury themselves in the past and never can accept
fresh and new elements into music. Old music is great, but not
an argument for not progressing. Another kick on the jerks who
try to be cool by pretending that they have been into (for
example) black metal since it started (though they are 16-17
years old and it started over 10 years ago). Not to be taken
too seriously, just a funny lyric...'
