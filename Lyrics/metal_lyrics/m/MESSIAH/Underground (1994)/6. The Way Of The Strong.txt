Faith, putting faith to your god
Trust, wasting trust in beleif
But still you're living in fear
The fear of what I live for
Asserts, you say I'm forever lost
Fire, you say I'll suffer in fire
So what have I done to my life?
What am I living for?

The dragon
Sets me free
And his fire
Lightens me
With his wings
I can fly
While you run
I conquer

Revelations, pure frustrations
Enrich your soul
But do you know
What you self are living for?
You fear desire
Only heaven has a cure
It is in your faith
To waste all worth living for

I love my sins
Of lust I shout
And you're so dull
Behind your lies
You fade to death
Pretending all your life
You curse the joy
And hail distress
The dragon
Sets me free
And his fire
Lightens me
With his wings
I can fly
While you run
I conquer

Faith, there is no use of your faith
Trust, I'm laughing at your blind trust
You're wasting all of your life
To please a death and blind god
Asserts, your words - a strike in the air
Fire, no one will suffer in fire
I am gilding my life
With the knowledge I forge

I live the way of the strong
You are the weak
