The time has come to tell you about my deed
No way to understand how long my heart has bled
I see my life in pictures torments and pleasures
Survived through many conflicts my life gives me no pleasures

My life will not be over, although I'm cast down
It will begin now, the other way around
I let self-drift from my sexual feelings
They are too important for human beings
