These are all true, sad stories
About many special people
And are dedicated for those who will fail

All of these people watched for the same light
After they died and were leaving the
Terrestrial existence

A man knew exactly when he would die
But with his christian faith, he prayed
He was living with a confidence

Raped bodies is a story of the lines of thought
Of a convicted man who realized at
Last his contrition as he sat in his
Condemned cell. He drifted into the new world
Of the dreams of eschaton

Anorexia nervosa is a condition that
Leaves mentally ill people looking
Like deformed creatures

The final story is about an old woman
Who is suffering from an incurable disease
She's regressing into childish behaviour with
Alzheimer's disease

We all have to accept the
Ascension of a divine ordinance

But will this be the ascension?
Will there be a light?
Will there be our lord of heaven?
