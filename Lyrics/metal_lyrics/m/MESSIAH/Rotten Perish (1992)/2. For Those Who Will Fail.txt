God created a world, a world of injustice, a world of distrust
He created humans, humans of prejudice, humans with selfish-
ness
He forgot the justice, justice of humanity, justice of equali-
ty
You created our faults, pain in our bodies, weakness of our
brains

[Chorus:]
For those who will fail
Ora, uxorem, natura

We talk about humans, they couldn't live a real life
Expelled from their families in a remote closed sanitarium
They remain will they'll die
We still shun all these human beings, are we too sensitive?
Why haven't they a place in our society, who takes the blame?
We are all responsible and it's a sacrifice of our limited
system
Our system forbids us to see in their eyes and to talk to them

[Chorus]

If they are too weak for society, they will be isolated
The other ones get their revenge

Why can we not be happy to work with them, is this impossible?
When we meet these humand, we're afraid and they give us the
creeps
But later we're happy and laugh at these innocent creatures
If we would open our minds, they could be our best friends

[Chorus]
