For fifty-two years
We have been married
We've had a lucky life
But now the problems have begun

[Chorus:]
She's really changed, I can't understand my wife
What's happened with her mind
She keeps forgetting things
I realize the degeneration of her memory
Her lack of independence
Distractedness, personality decline
Obstructions of recollections

The years pass slowly
A lot has changed in my life
She's living with a persecution complex
My wife's a total physical wreck

[Chorus]

She's regressing more and more
Her behaviour is like infancy
I see only a grown-up foetus

Nobody will help her
I know she will die
By the alzheimer's disease
