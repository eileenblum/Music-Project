I see the crusade of mentally disturbed persons
All kinds of mutilated and distraught human beings
Drag alone to the shrouded legend realm

They are suspended high over the burning earth
And leave their earthly existance for their new life

You were redeemed of your worldly torments
Torments of isolation, injustice, lies
Maltreatment, abandonment, mutilation and genocide

Choirs of redemption resound through the sky
Tombones complete the ascent of the deformed creatures

The way is far
Their bodies soar

Angels appear and escort them to their new life
Feelings of pleasure, releif and blissfulness

With their white vestment they look so innocent
They embody the pure joie de vivre
Which they had missed in their past life

The cherubs lead the crusade to the dark tunnel
At the end of the tube, there is a bright light

This will be the end of their long trip
To the unknown fourth dimension
Nobody knows what's behind the light
And what they will do there

They are suspended so easily together with the angels
I'm losing sight of the ones right at the front

They suffered
Since the beginning
Now they've left the
Earthly existence

The ascent brings
Eternal bliss
To everyone
On the crusade

You're still asking yourself, will it be better, the new life?
Will you get the chance to live a normal life?
Were you living a bad life as a person, in your life before?
Your biggest dream was to see god, when you arrived at the
gates of heaven
Can you see him?
