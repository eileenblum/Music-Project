Father and mother divorced as I began the school in hamilton
We had the same problem every night with daddy's addiction
Violence and drunkeness reigned his every day and made us down
I felt really distraught as he finally left our home

The time after was difficult, I felt rather unnerved

Because of my ugly appearance, they treated me like a fool
A misfit, I was derided by the girls of our school
I reached the height of my mental quandary
More and more I shied away and went my lonely way

The time of retaliation will come
Fear, pain, torment
They will come
Admiration, worship
They will treat me like a god

To talk with my schoolmates about girls was an abomination
Possessing a girl was my biggest sexual imagination
I had realized that this idea could never be reality
Dazzled through my sexual lust I planned many different stra-
tegies

I possessed no bad conscience only one aim in my eyes

The act of cruelty considered the last details in my mind
A long time to wait for the sunset and the sacrifice made me
blind
She was my number one girl, young with her long fair hair
I struck her and dragged her body to the thicket where I raped
her

At this moment you were my girl and my dream was reality
She saw my face, there was no other choice but to kill her
Only now I had understood what I had done
I left the scene of the crime quickly and went home

I can't live with the thoughts that I killed a young girl

This was my past but I'm not proud about now
Although I killed a girl, they couldn't give me a life senten-
ce
After one year in the youth custody unit I will be free
Fortunately we all live in a cracked system where you can kill
