For two weeks, I was sitting in the prison cell
Iron gates obstruct the way to be free
Now, I've enough time to think about my offence
This deed was dreadful and I deeply regret it

I don't like to talk about the things that happened
My mind has drifted to this transgression

The pictures of the offence reflect in my brain
Only now I'm realizing what I have done
Horrible nightmares constantly cross my sleep
At the time it's really hard to live in the cell

Tears run over my cheeks
I've never noticed that before
This is a serious situation
Never could I imagine
I killed an innocent girl
She had the right to live
So I have it too
I know that's my crime
Although the people
Are not blameless

I have the chances ruined for my future
It will be hard to find a new job
My name is murder, it says too much
Everybody will get out of my way

Lost the power, destroyed my pride
My life is ruined, lose my future

My mother left me to my fate
She will have nothing more to do with me
I don't know what the time will bring
When I leave the prison in one year
