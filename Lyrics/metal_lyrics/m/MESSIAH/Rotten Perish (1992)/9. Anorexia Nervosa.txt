Time of puberty
Age of quandary
Sorrow and worries

Disagreement
Predicament
I enigmatize

Weakness overcomes my body, my brain's so empty
I lose my appetite, day in day out
My body's deeply marked, I'm undernourished

[Chorus:]
Mental changes, my mind is splitting
Inferiority complexes, time to confess
Pride and power, is giving me the hunger
Depr4ession and apathy, is changing my spirit

Time to go hungry
It gives me great joy
Pleasure and satisfaction

To fight against
My hunger pangs
Gives me pride

Feeling of sheer terror
To see me in the mirror
I could be so fat

Every pound I lose
Helps me on the course
To my sheer perfection

I don't realize how bad my body's feeling
My eyes see only my perfect slim body
But really I'm a half-starved skeleton

[Chorus]
