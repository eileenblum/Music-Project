Why do I feel so downcast - am I in distress
Do I exist among the living downsociety
Yes, I'm integrated in the system - incredible
Sometimes one beneath the other till becoming sick

Now my remorse spreads out in my soul
It's my alter that leads to a continuous anaemia
God help me to abhor that inexorable arctic winter
It's like a squirm boring through my heart
Not guilty - instead take part in that dunghill

Please amputate my brain - that's my endless pain
My skeleton turns to black - the inner crime is back
My eyes are freezing to ice - now I become two

I think my corpus-delicti decays - please so it has to be
But it's my meat in my head - that crumbles to pieces instead
Psychomorphia - psychomorphia

My physical death attends me just fall as in a paralysis
The timne of incapable of acting reach souls to be drown
I don't know if I'm unable to move or think about
The darkness in my mind, send me to a journey without exit
I don't know if I'm unable to think or move

Please amputate my brain - that's my endless pain
My skeleton turns to black - the inner crime is back
My eyes are freezing to ice - now I become two

I think my corpus-delicti decays - please so it has to be
But it's my meat in my head - that crumbles to pieces instead
Psychomorphia
