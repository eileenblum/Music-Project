"Mysteriis came back, the evil is usual
...Strenght of mortal sin
Revolt of the infidels, come to me
Now is the conflict
The wrath of hell"
(Thomas Backelin)

Crowds scream for mercy
Disfigured creatures
Are seen in the mirror
The place is not safe
The wind makes a terrible symphony

Now the mysteriis reigns
By the sounds of war
The path was discovered
The warriors of wrath

All seen in agony
Returning the blasphemies
Now is the conflict
The wrath of hell
Tormented zombie walk

The cure is not possible
Any form of plague is seen
The freak show is just beginning
Is not end to the storm
...Fire comes from the insignificant rites
The plague is stupid and will not quit
