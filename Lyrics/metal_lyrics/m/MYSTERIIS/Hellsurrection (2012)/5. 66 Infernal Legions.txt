Beyond the gates to the unseen
Behind the doors of mystery

This is the temple of of the east
The kingdom of Baal, the mighty
Demon!

We scream for your damnation
We feast upon your tainted flesh
Your spoiled rotting flesh

We're his almighty legions
Our empire of death, your prison!!!
66 infernal legions!

Nefarious spirits of fire
Tearing asunder your souls
Chaos, disaster, and curses
Upon your world of illusion
Your rotting world of illusion

In the darkness, the mist in the forests
We feed on your illumination
The pentagram and (magical) circles
They're just your symbols to invoke us
We are the nameless ones
From dimensions unknown
Your wicked corpses will adorn our throne
Our ancient throne

Our ancient throne

Finally the time has come
Said the profanation storms
Finally the time has come
Said the profanation storms
Propel the rise of evil
Sacrifice your souls for us
