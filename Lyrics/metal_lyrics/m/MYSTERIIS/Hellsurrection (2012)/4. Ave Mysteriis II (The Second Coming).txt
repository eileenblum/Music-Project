The ritual begins, on the cross the image can be seen
The eyes were blinded by the light of the boiler
Ceremonial of the gods, now can feel the smell of sulfur
With his arms trapped and helpless
The nails are pulled out and swallowed by fury
the story is told by darkness...Ave Mysteriis!!!

Sinks under the weight of lies
From the smell of discord
By the force of inconsistence
Life is sold, by the poor men of faith

The fire can be felt
Smoke drowns the concepts
Evil manifests itself in excellence

Rising from the limbus
For the mass of fools
Destroy everything
Now in pure sadism

Without looking back

Rising from the limbus
For the mass of fools
Destroy everything
Now in pure sadism
