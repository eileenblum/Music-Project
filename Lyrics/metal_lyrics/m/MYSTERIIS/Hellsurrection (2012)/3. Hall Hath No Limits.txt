Arsenal of hate
Devastates your corpses
The unclean are marching
Taking to hell your souls

Torment your dogmas
Terrorize your sanctuaries
spit in divinity
On behalf your of goat

I humiliate your hammered god
His stigmas, his crown
This is nothing but images
Follow what is real

Ia sacra, ia domini
Ia sacra, ia domini

I am the lord of nations
I am the legion and the truth
