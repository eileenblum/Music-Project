Ritualistic night
Demons assault the church
Burning all ancient dogmas
Sacrificing ghosts

They destroy the sacred
By the antichrist storm
Death shall rise
God shall fall

Darkness commanding the infernal fury
Cursed, dead, sentenced to the deep abyss
Corrupted minds spreading madness
Surrounded by all forces of evil

Unleash the hell
Join the ritual

Grey sky turning red
By the fire of desire
Death shall rise
God shall fall

God shall fall

Death's vultures
Thirsty for vengeance
Unleash the hell
Join the ritual

Earth's armageddon
Blind horizons
Bleeding heart's religions

Death shall rise
God shall fall
