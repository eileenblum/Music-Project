His Name runs through the mouth of deceivers
Despair into tears of blood
Your words will not be heard
Weak' laments for salvation

The wind brings the spell of his death
Angels with broken wings
The false messiah silenced
Dead and crucified
Despair into tears of blood

Crawling his last hours
He screams for the pain of the whip
Immaculate but decried
The lamb's face without glory

The wind brings the spell of his death
Angels with broken wings
The false messiah silenced
Dead and crucified
Despair into tears of blood
[Triumphsword]

Your Temple tells me nothing
The son of the virgin lies in pain
Ashes of the king of nothing
Earth of god, chaos, insane
