[originally by Darkthrone]

Transilvanian hunger
The mountain so cold
Cold cold, soul cold

Your hands are cruel careful.. pale
To haunt
To haunt forever at night
Take me
Can't you feel the call
Embrace me eternally
In your daylight slumber

To be draped by the shadow
Of your morbid palace
Oh hate living..
The only heat is warm blood

So pure..
So cold..
Transilvanian hunger

Hail to the true, intense vampires
A story made for divine fulfillment
To be the ones breathing a wind of sorrow
Sorrow and fright the dearest Katharsis

Beautiful evil self
To be the morbid Count
A part of a pact
That is delightfully immortal
Feel the call
Freeze you with the uppermost desire

Transilvanian hunger
My mountain is cold
So Pure..
Evil
Cold
Transilvanian hunger
