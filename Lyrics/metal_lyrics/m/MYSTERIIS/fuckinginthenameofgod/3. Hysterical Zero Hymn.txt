[Music by Mantus &amp; Mysteriis / Lyrics by Malphas]

Accused by the creators
And in sadistic silence
Your sleeping soul shouts for magnitude
... The human desires ... now ... a legion of vulgarity

Hysterical Zero Hymn

Fatal motion ahead
... Forbidden acts are in your great point
... Ends in rebellion ... a pulse for victory
So let the distress come back
Wildly  ... keeps me free yet

All creation lays at the brink
No ethic to refuse
Recovery ... total supervision
It's burning with no limits
So, hear the extremes

I saw war through these eyes
... Walking through some secrets
This fiction's never dreamed of
In a fatal order appears

Hurried exile from secrets
Now the caller was banished
