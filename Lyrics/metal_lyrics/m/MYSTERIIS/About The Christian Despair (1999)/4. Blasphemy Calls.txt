[Music: Mantus / Lyrics: Malphas]

Burning fire complete my desire
Moon in madness it was shinning black
Fuckin' lies about the tired cross
So many histories about the christian falls
Maybe we can see the true demon at the cross

A real farse a long the centuries
A supreme force
... In the lost books of the bible ... in the lost

Now I can see ... now ... Oh ! God ! I can feel it
I swear that I feel it
No farse ... no kinds of emotion
... true evil ... true body damnation ... oh !
Something strange ... born
Turn to real, pure and strong
As deep ... as supreme ... oh !

Hail throne where a sindrome calls
Hail misery from the past ... christian deny

I summon you ... I could see all the forms of your body
Perfect stages ... crucifying ... in pain his body don't resist

Under some crisis of dawn
Empty lies makes history
Years of a godless empire
Ends hate.
