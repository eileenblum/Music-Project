[Music: Mantus / Lyrics: Malphas]

An evil ... a cold mystery
A frozen nature ... an immortal fear ...
There's no bright ... there's no life ... there's no mistakes
Just evil distance unknown ... there's no return

From my eyes ... from the shadows ... a pawfull history
From the gates ... empty words ... empty means
At the altar ... I pray
I invoked the lord ... the beasts ...
The souls of obsession ... oh ! hell ascension ...

I'm waiting for his coming though my offerings
I get his paths
I'm waiting for his power to make me eternal
I need his paths

Experiments of death to the legacy of time be done
To cure my fever and explain the opposites
The black and white
