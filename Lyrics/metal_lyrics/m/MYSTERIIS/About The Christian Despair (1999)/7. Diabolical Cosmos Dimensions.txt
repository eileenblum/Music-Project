[Music: Mantus / Lyrics: Malphas]

He made in my path
Here fighting to liberty my soul
I say from the storm
That I saw ... intentions of glory

Winds ... Storms to touch my skin
Gray skies it's to dangerous
Protect my eyes ... that it ... can't see

We gonna leave
Falling down in the cosmos
Frighting feelings
... old voices
... from the past ! Oh ! Ghosts of compassion ...

Leave me alone
Daring reasons ...
Saving the human blindness in this history
Oh ! My tiring body don't resist ...

For your 'babies'
For your own
For your friends that leave us ... some evil

Oh! Jesus is not good
His creatures just crown up
Some faith moving ...
Some faith control ...
Some faith humiliated his sons
... poors ... angry ... fear ... screams ... cries ...

A point of light
In a global offense
A shining emperor awake
The history falls ... under our darkness, amen!
