[Music: Mantus / Lyrics: Malphas]

The fiveâpointed brings human perfection
... increasing fears
... so many power
... the circle's images beyond my debt
Supreme evil
Oh ! Anu my Lord

In my visions of profane signs
There's no coherence, just black desires
I pray, my lord of disease
Amen ! Black God
I feel the 666

Through the acean, kutulu raises
Through the fire, Nergal burns
Diabolical arts to compose some hearts
... Supreme evilâAnu rules

... Waiting for horned legions
To glorify his eminence ...

Nanna cries your darkest light
Uggae have mercy on my soul
Shamash, turn to black
Evil ways from Tiamat's praises

To curse, to summon, Oh ! Sacred Satan !

My real God ... your beasts are raising to my eyes
... from black womb ... crying ... burning
... holy practices of a precious and damned

... Mysteriis ...
