[Music: Mantus / Lyrics: Malphas]

[IN THE VALLEY]

Spectral demons prepare for fight into this darkfull labyrint
Hordes of evil are playing the game by blood, by fire, by art ...
Up through the abyss ... mistress of the shadows ... as eternal fall
About a unholy place ... a valley so deep, here are the banishments

My soul ... lost in the valley possessing them in the name of God
We are not alone ...

Woods of black domain, a place were the sun never rises
Were the funeral clouds ... be signs of Satanas ...
The moon shines upon the earth, iÃ¯Â¿Â½m worshipping with the fire and sword
Satanical blasphemy against the empaled scarrecrow

My soul ... lost in the valley possessing them in the name of God
We are not alone ...

[A CHRISTIAN MOMENT]

With the fetid wing strewed on the baphomet I summon the forces from that place,
My nocturnal kingdom, manipulated by horned rules

Come on ! my other dimmension ... a valley of tyrants
Come on ! Thought my rituals ... that black paradise ... comes
The burning skies devoured by ancient flames
Funeral rites to glorify Satanas
Destroy the christians ... kill them ... burn them ... brother of sickness
Where my black valley rises
