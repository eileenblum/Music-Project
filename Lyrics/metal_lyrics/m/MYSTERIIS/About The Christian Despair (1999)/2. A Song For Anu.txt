[Music: Mantus / Lyrics: Malphas]

Occultism ...
Rituals ...
I gave my blood to Teitan
My soul turn to black by the evil's sentence
- Come to me
- Raise to this clowns
In my dreams
In front of me
In the shadows he come to earth to destroy
And terrify the dubious image. - Satan's ! My Noble God !

IA ! Satan's
IA ! my noble God ...

Black preaches I can hear
The sorrowful blood are draining
Intentional invocation ...
Blasphemy of a new generation
Redeemer of my obscurity
The black human souls will be possessed. - Satan's ! My noble God !

IA ! Satan's
IA ! my noble God ...

Satan's kingdom ...
In flames we burn to venerate you
In the rituals our souls were crying black
Now and forever with my damned guide ...
