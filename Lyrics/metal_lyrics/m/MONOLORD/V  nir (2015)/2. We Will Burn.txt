Running and screaming
From this cold and dying world
My heart is bleeding
You killed Mother Earth

You have nothing to offer
Turned your back on us all
Treatment of silence
When we burn it's your fault

Yeah, we blew it all
Yeah, we blew it all
We're in the hands of fools

We're dying in darkness
In decay and endless nights
Our future is resting
In the hands of fools

Yeah, we blew it all
Yeah, we blew it all
