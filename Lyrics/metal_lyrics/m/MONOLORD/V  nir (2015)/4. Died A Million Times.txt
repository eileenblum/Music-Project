I can't explain why colors fade away
Everything feels just like a dream
Take my hand and enter through that door
A twisted gateway to your mind
A brew so black, enhance the final stage
To cosmic madness, merged in time

You die a million times
You will die a million times
You die a million times

Stars align, mark your way through sky
Deeper in the endless space
When your cells starts to disintegrate
Blur turns to haze, you will die again

You die a million times
You will die a million times
You die a million times
