In my eyes
Burning sun
For the lives
and our souls

In the sky
Rocket blast
Times has come
To blow up the sun

Nuclear death
Exploding sun

Open hatch
Kill the pain
Live the dream
Blissfulness

The sky turned black
Day and night
Atomic ritual
To save our world

Nuclear death
Exploding sun

Gonna blow you away
