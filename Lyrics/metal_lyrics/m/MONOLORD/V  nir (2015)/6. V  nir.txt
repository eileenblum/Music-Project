You can't hide
I realize
Have no fear
Hypnotized
Until now
Say good bye
You're in the mountains eye

Set aside
Don't want you by my side
Coal black eyes
Sharpest tongue inside
Cloaked in grey
Need to unveil
Truthful and clear
I'll sink you in the mere

Walk in through the light
You're bleeding by my side
Screams filled with fright
You start to curl and moan
I'm counting heavy stones
I'll wait 'til we're alone
