Casted back to the shadows
Cursing the sun
Said to be ruling
I'm ruled by none

The reflection in mirrors
Reveals the nature of man
Repelled by your scissors
Wielded by hand

Burning rivers of blood
You're the keeper of lies

I am cursing the one
I am cursing the son

Iron nails in your coffin
No one will rise from their graves
Eyes causing illness
Revenge is sought to be saved

Burning rivers of blood
You're the believer of lies

I am cursing the one
I am cursing the son
