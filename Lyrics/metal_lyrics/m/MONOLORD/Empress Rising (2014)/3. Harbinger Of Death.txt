At midnight, tonight
A messenger of death
Washing armors from stains of blood
Death is rising from within the flood

Darkest omen, she awaits
Female spirits, waling wraiths
She creatures moaning in the night
It is the curse, the curse of the banshee

Harbinger of death

The ruler of 25
From the mist she will arise
Blood stained leather,
the king has lost his crown
Death is rising
Kings and queens will die

Harbinger of death
