They dwell in burial grounds
In the dark
Shapeshifters with a curse
The devils mark

Creatures from the otherworlds
Drinking blood
With evil ways
Watchers of the dark

The end of days is nigh
Terror of death
Undead will roam the earth
Feasting on flesh

Watchers of the waste
Crawling through time and space
