Into darkness, wandering
Forwarned by shadows, behind the light

Inside, the mother
Rebirth of a thousand souls
Consuming power, fit for mind control

Three serpents in the sky
True death you can't deny

Icons of evil, curse of the winter sun
Forsaken, hollow
A stone maidens crown
