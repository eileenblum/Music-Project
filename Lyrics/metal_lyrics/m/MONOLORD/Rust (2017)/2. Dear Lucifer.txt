You will never see the peace you try to find
You're lost forever when you search your inner mind
The universe is unexplained with creatures in your brain
Searching for holy freedom with your past unexplained

The golden age of melancholy has arrived
My mind is pure and in a misanthropic high
Cataclysmic visions in a state of non-return
We have not made progression
It is time, time to learn

Dear Lucifer, I'm sad to say I must go
Dear Lucifer, I don't believe anymore

The golden age of melancholy has arrived
My mind is pure and in a misanthropic high
Cataclysmic visions in a church you try to burn
We have not made progression
It is time, time to learn

Dear Lucifer, I'm sad to say I must go
Dear Lucifer, I don't believe anymore

Dear Lucifer, I'm sad to say I must go
Dear Lucifer, I don't believe anymore

Dear Lucifer, I'm sad to say I must go
Dear Lucifer, I don't believe anymore
