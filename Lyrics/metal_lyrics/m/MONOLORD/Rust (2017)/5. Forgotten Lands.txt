Inside the pale white room
Awaiting, pending doom
Trapped inside the cage
Plague of a modern age

Worn out, thin and grey
Vast memories, brighter days
The rusting silver spoon
Forgotten hands of doom

Burden of grief led you astray
Winds carrying ashes far away
Dreams of tomorrow, far away

Standing in fog bound land
Living where no-one can
From where you can't return
You donât speak, you don't yearn

Burden of grief led you astray
Winds carrying ashes far away
Dreams of tomorrow, far away

Transmission unknown, second sun, in the void, into the sun

Avenge the fallen
Raise your trembling hands
All will descend on forgotten lands
