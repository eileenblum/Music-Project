The council a scheme
The none believers heresy
Lions snakes assembly
Judgement cast by your own creed
Emperor Constantine
Summon the number three-eighteen

It's still the same when lions reign
Feed the world with lies

The clergy of sheep
Spawned the laws of lunacy
Relations to God
Constructions tales of infamy
Our fathers were free
To question the sons divinity

It's still the same when lions reign
Feed the world with lies
It's still the same when lions reign
Feed the world with lies

It is time to hand down the crown
Without a single frown
We have watched this going on for years
Without any fears
And all the tears that fill my eyes
It's our turn to die. To die.
