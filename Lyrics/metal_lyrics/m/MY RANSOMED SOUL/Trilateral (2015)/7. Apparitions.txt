I REMEMBER THE LOOK IN YOUR EYES. THE LAST TIME WE MET. I BARELY SAID A WORD AND
THATâS MY ONE REGRET. I CANâT CHANGE THE PAST AND THATâS WHAT KILLS ME THE MOST.
I STILL SEE YOUR FACE LIKE YOUâRE SOME KIND OF GHOST. TOO YOUNG TOO SOON. IS WHAT
THEY SAY. I WOULD DO ANYTHING TO HAVE YOU STAY. AS DUST WE COME. AS DUST WE GO.
ITâS JUST THE WAY WE ALL END UP BELOW. I CANâT CHANGE THE PAST, GOD KNOWS THAT IâVE
TRIED. I STILL SEE YOUR FACE AND ITâS EATING ME ALIVE. TOO YOUNG TOO SOON. IS WHAT
THEY SAY. I WOULD DO ANYTHING TO HAVE YOU STAY. AS DUST WE COME. AS DUST WE GO. ITâS
JUST THE WAY WE ALL END UP. TOO YOUNG TOO SOON. IS WHAT THEY SAY. I WOULD DO
ANYTHING TO HAVE YOU STAY. AS DUST WE COME. AS DUST WE GO. ITâS JUST THE WAY WE ALL
END UP ALONE.
