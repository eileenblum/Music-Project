THIS ADDICTION, MY ONLY FRIEND. GIVES ME A REASON TO WAKE UP AGAIN. IâLL MEDICATE
TILL I SEE FIT. I HAVE A BAD HABIT THAT NEVER QUITS. NOW DROWN THESE DEMONS AND AIM
TO KILL. ALL THESE MEMORIES DISAPPEAR WITH THE PILL. TAKE THE SUBSTANCES TO CLEAR
YOUR MIND. AND STILL YOUâLL QUESTION ANSWERS THAT YOU THINK YOUâLL FIND. AS THE
VENOM ENTERS THE VEIN. I CANâT HELP BUT FEEL HOPELESS AGAIN. I CANâT DO THIS ON MY
OWN. IâM SO SICK OF THIS PLACE. I CANâT HELP BUT FEEL SHAME AND DISGRACE. THE PILLS
NEVER WORK, THE DRINKS NEVER END. I KEEP PRAYING THAT THIS IS PRETEND. SHOW ME THAT
YOUâRE STILL OUT THERE. WHEN I BEGIN TO STRAY. PUT ME BACK TOGETHER. BECAUSE
I NEED A BETTER WAY. GOD IF YOU CAN HEAR ME. IâM THROUGH WITH BEING SICK. IâM DYING ON
THE INSIDE. I NEED A DIFFERENT FIX. I CANâT DO THIS ON MY OWN. IâM SO SICK OF THIS PLACE.
I CANâT HELP BUT FEEL SHAME AND DISGRACE. THE PILLS NEVER WORK, THE DRINKS NEVER
END. I KEEP PRAYING THAT THIS IS PRETEND. I CANâT DO THIS ON MY OWN. IâM SO SICK OF THIS
PLACE. I CANâT HELP BUT FEEL SHAME AND DISGRACE. THE PILLS NEVER WORK, THE DRINKS
NEVER END. I KEEP PRAYING THAT THIS IS PRETEND. I NEED A DIFFERENT FIX.
