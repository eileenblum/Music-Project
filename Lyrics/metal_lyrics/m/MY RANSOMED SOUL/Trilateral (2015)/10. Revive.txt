WHY DO I DOUBT THE THINGS IâVE SEEN. THE LOVE THE POWER OF A HIGHER BEING. WHY
DO I DENY WHAT I FEEL. AM I TOO SCARED TO BE HEALED. IF YOU ARE REAL AND YOU
ARE HERE. THEN WHAT IS LEFT FOR ME TO FEAR. IF YOU ARE REAL RESTORE ME. SO I CAN
FINALLY BE FREE. IâVE COME THIS FAR BUT STILL FALL SHORT. WHY HAVE I MADE YOU MY
LAST RESORT. IâVE COME THIS FAR YET DENY YOUR GRACE. I HAVE SEEMED TO LOST MY
PLACE. SHOW ME YOUR WAYS. SHOW ME YOUâRE REAL. BREAK DOWN THESE WALLS. TEACH
ME TO FEEL. IF YOU ARE REAL AND YOU ARE HERE. THEN WHAT IS LEFT FOR ME TO FEAR.
IF YOU ARE REAL RESTORE ME. SO I CAN FINALLY BE FREE. IâVE DOUBTED YOU FOR SO
LONG. IâM FINALLY GIVING IN. GOD I KNOW YOUâRE OUT THERE. HELP ME TO START AGAIN.
COME AND MAKE ME WHOLE. I NEED TO BE RESTORED (RESTORE ME). GIVE ME SOMETHING
TO LIVE FOR. IF YOU ARE REAL AND YOU ARE HERE. THEN WHAT IS LEFT FOR ME TO FEAR.
IF YOU ARE REAL RESTORE ME. SO I CAN FINALLY BE FREE. IF YOU ARE REAL AND YOU
ARE HERE. THEN WHAT IS LEFT FOR ME TO FEAR. IF YOU ARE REAL RESTORE ME. SO I CAN
FINALLY BE FREE. ERASE THE DOUBT IâVE HELD INSIDE. HOW DID I GET SO BLIND. STRIP
ME OF MY PRIDE. GIVE ME PEACE OF MIND
