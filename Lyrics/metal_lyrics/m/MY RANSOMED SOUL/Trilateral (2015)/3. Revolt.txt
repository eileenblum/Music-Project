HE WHO TRADES FREEDOM FOR SECURITY. DESERVES TO WEAR THESE CHAINS. WE MUST
PURGE THE SYSTEM OF IMPURITY. WE MUST BE THE CHANGE. WILL YOU SPIT IN THE FACE
OF STRIFE. WOULD YOU SACRIFICE YOUR LIFE. YOU CLAIM AUTONOMY. YET DESTROY WHAT
IT MEANS. TWISTING TRUTH WITH HYPOCRISY. YOU SPEAK OF LIBERTY. YET DISMANTLE OUR
DREAMS. IS THIS WHAT YOU CALL DEMOCRACY. OPEN, OPEN YOUR EYES. LOOK INSIDE
AND TELL ME WHAT YOU FIND. TELL ME HOW DOES IT FEEL. TO SEE ALL THE LIES. TELL ME
HOW DOES IT FEEL. NOW THAT YOU SEE THE SIGNS. WE WONâT STAND. FOR ALL THE LIES
YOU SPEW. WE WONâT STAND. FOR ALL THE WRETCHED THINGS YOU DO. WE LIVE IN A FALSE
SENSE OF SECURITY. WEâRE SO SICK OF YOUR LIES. WE PUT OUR TRUST IN CORRUPTED
AUTHORITY. SHOW US WHAT YOU HIDE. YOU CLAIM AUTONOMY. YET DESTROY WHAT IT MEANS.
TWISTING TRUTH WITH HYPOCRISY. YOU SPEAK OF LIBERTY. YET DISMANTLE OUR DREAMS.
IS THIS WHAT YOU CALL DEMOCRACY. WE WILL NEVER BACK DOWN. WE COME FOR BLOOD.
WE WILL NEVER BACK DOWN. WE COME FOR BLOOD.
