I AM LACED WITH IMPERFECTIONS. I AM LACKING EVERYTHING. AS I STARE AT MY REFLECTION.
I AM DISGUSTED WITH WHAT I SEE. A FILTHY DESPERATE VAGRANT. A BROKEN EMPTY SOUL.
I AM LACKING ANY VALUE. WITH A HEART THATâS DEAD AND COLD. MY EYES TURN ABOVE
AS I CALL OUT YOUR NAME. I AM DESPERATE AND FILTHY, BROKEN AND SO FULL OF SHAME.
I AM LACKING ANY HOPE, A LIFELESS EMPTY CORPSE. I LACK ALL REMORSE. THERE IS NO
KINDNESS IN MY HEART. SIMPLY HOLLOW EVERMORE. I QUESTION EVERYTHING I ONCE
HELD SO CLOSE. THERE IS NO KINDNESS IN MY HEART. SIMPLY HOLLOW EVERMORE. I AM
REACHING OUT JUST TO BE RESTORED. WHAT IS FAITH. WHAT IS BELIEVING. EVEN MY
HONEST THOUGHTS DECEIVE ME. MY EYES TURN ABOVE AS I CALL OUT YOUR NAME. I AM
DESPERATE AND FILTHY, BROKEN AND SO FULL OF SHAME. I AM LACKING ANY HOPE, A
LIFELESS EMPTY CORPSE. I LACK ALL REMORSE. MY EYES TURN ABOVE AS I CALL OUT YOUR
NAME. I AM DESPERATE AND FILTHY, BROKEN AND SO FULL OF SHAME. I AM LACKING ANY
HOPE, A LIFELESS EMPTY CORPSE. I LACK ALL REMORSE. CYNIC, OPEN YOUR EYES. CYNIC,
LOOK TO THE SKY. CYNIC, OPEN YOUR EYES. CYNIC, CYNIC.
