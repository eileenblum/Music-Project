WE CALL IT FREEDOM. BUT ARE WE REALLY FREE. YOU CALL ME BLIND WHEN ITâS YOU THAT
CANNOT SEE. WE GIVE THEM POWER TO CONTROL OUR LIVES. AS THEY SLOWLY STRIP AWAY
OUR RIGHTS. THIS IS BRAINWASHING AT ITS FINEST. YOU GIVE IT ALL AWAY. YOU STAND
AND SPEAK OF FREEDOM. YET YOU TELL ME WHAT TO SAY. WHEN DID ANOTHERâS LIFE BECOME
YOUR DECISION. WHEN DID LOVE BECOME AN INSTITUTION. CONTROLLING THE MASSES
WITH THEIR SOCIAL AGENDA. ITâS NOTHING MORE THAN A TYRANTâS PROPAGANDA. THIS IS
BRAINWASHING AT ITS FINEST. YOU GIVE IT ALL AWAY. YOU STAND AND SPEAK OF FREEDOM.
YET YOU TELL ME WHAT TO SAY. THIS SYSTEM IS A LIVING BREATHING MACHINE. TEAR OUT ITS
HEART AND WATCH AS IT BLEEDS. ALL HAIL THE TYRANNY. ALL HAIL THE TYRANNY. THIS IS
BRAINWASHING AT ITS FINEST. YOU GIVE IT ALL AWAY. YOU STAND AND SPEAK OF FREEDOM.
YET YOU TELL ME WHAT TO SAY. DONâT TELL ME WHAT TO SAY.
