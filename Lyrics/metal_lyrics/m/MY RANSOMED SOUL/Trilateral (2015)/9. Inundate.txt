IâM SURROUNDED YET SO ALONE. I CANâT SEEM TO EVER REALLY FEEL AT HOME. I WONâT
STOMACH PILLS, I WANT SOMETHING REAL. NOT A SHADOW OF HOW IâM SUPPOSED TO
FEEL. IâM SICK OF FEELING HOLLOW. I JUST WANT SOMETHING REAL. IâM SICK OF FEELING
EMPTY. I JUST WANT TO FEEL. MY MIND CANâT SEEM TO LET GO OF. ALL THE THINGS THAT
IâLL NEVER KNOW. I CANâT KEEP LIVING IN MY OWN REGRETS. SO IâLL SWIM AGAINST THE
CURRENTS. IâM ALWAYS SINKING. IâLL JUST KEEP DRINKING. AND MAYBE THEN IâLL NUMB THE
PAIN. JUST A QUICK FIX FOR MY SICKNESS. MY MIND CANâT SEEM TO LET GO OF. ALL THE
THINGS THAT IâLL NEVER KNOW. I CANâT KEEP LIVING IN MY OWN REGRETS. SO IâLL SWIM
AGAINST THE CURRENTS. FILL THIS HOLE WITHIN MY GUT. I AM STUCK INSIDE THIS RUT.
PLEASE COME AND SAVE ME. I AM LOST AND SO ALONE. AND I WANT TO FIND MY HOME.
PLEASE COME AND SAVE ME. COME DIG ME OUT OF THIS MESS I MADE. SAVE ME. MY MIND
CANâT SEEM TO LET GO OF. ALL THE THINGS THAT IâLL NEVER KNOW. I CANâT KEEP LIVING IN
MY OWN REGRETS. SO IâLL SWIM AGAINST THE CURRENTS. MY MIND CANâT SEEM TO LET
GO OF ALL THE THINGS THAT IâLL NEVER KNOW. I CANâT KEEP LIVING IN MY OWN REGRETS.
SO IâLL SWIM AGAINST THE CURRENTS. IâM ALWAYS SINKING. IâLL JUST KEEP DRINKING.
