TIMES HAVE CHANGE AND SO HAVE I, FOR BETTER OR WORSE I CAN'T DECIDE.
THE BOY I WAS IS NOT THE MAN I BECAME; THE QUESTION IS WHO'S TO BLAME?

AS I'VE GROWN, I'VE LOST MY FIRE;
APATHETIC WITHOUT DESIRE.

AM I HAPPY, WITH WHO I AM?
OR AM I LOST, WITHOUT A PLAN?

I SEE NOTHING BUT HEARTACHE,
INSPIRED ONLY BY GREED,
AND I AM NO EXCEPTION,
IGNORING THOSE WHO NEED.

DO WE REALLY LOVE? DO WE REALLY TRY?
OR IS IT SELF-RIGHTEOUS LIVING, NOTHING BUT EMPTY LIES?

AM I HAPPY, WITH WHO I AM?
OR AM I LOST, WITHOUT A PLAN?

WE ARE A PLAGUE, SELF-DESTRUCTIVE, IN OUR OWN WAYS
