I AM LOSING HOPE, IN EVERYTHING I WANTED MOST

I HAVE GIVEN SO MUCH, YET GAINED SO LITTLE,
ARE MY DREAMS A CRUTCH OR SOMETHING REAL?

I AM LOSING HOPE.

IS THIS WHAT ITâS COME TO? IS THIS ALL WE HAD?
IS THERE SOMETHING TO SHOW FOR THE PROGRESS THAT WE HAD?

WE'VE POURED OUR LIFE INTO THIS, IS THERE SOMETHING WE MISSED?

THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN OUR HEARTS GOAL, YET WE SEEM TO BE LOSING CONTROL.

ARE THE MEMORIES GOLDEN? IS THIS WHAT WE DREAMED?

IS THIS WHAT ITâS COME TO? IS THIS ALL WE HAD?
IS THERE SOMETHING TO SHOW FOR THE PROGRESS THAT WE HAD?

I AM LOST.
