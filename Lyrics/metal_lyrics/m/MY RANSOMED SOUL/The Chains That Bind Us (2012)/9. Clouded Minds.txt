YOU STAND FOR NOTHING, AND YOUR THOUGHTS ARE BLIND,
IGNORANT SPEECH AND A CLOUDED MIND

I WILL NOT COMPROMISE, THE BELIEFS I STAND BEHIND.

REGAIN YOUR SENSES; OPEN YOUR MIND,
IGNORANCE PLAGUES, OUR SHALLOW KIND

IF FREEDOM'S FOUND IN TRUTH, THEN YOU'RE BOUND TO A LIE,
THESE ABSOLUTES CANNOT BE DENIED

BOUND TO A LIE

THERE IS NO SIGHT WITH EYES SOWN SHUT,
OUR MINDS REMAIN STUCK IN THIS RUT.

REGAIN YOUR SENSES; OPEN YOUR MIND,
IGNORANCE PLAGUES OUR SHALLOW KIND.

PULL OUT THE STITCHES, OPEN YOUR EYES,
REGAIN YOUR SENSES, SEE THROUGH THE LIES.
