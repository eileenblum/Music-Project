I CAN'T WAKE FROM THIS DREAM

CAN I FEEL OR EVEN SEE THIS CREATURE GROWING INSIDE ME?
AM I DEAF OR EVEN BLIND?
HAVE WE BECOME DESENSITIZED?

DENY EVERYTHING, QUESTION EVERYTHING, IS ANYTHING EVEN REAL?

FEELINGS HAVE GONE LOST AGAIN; CAN I WAKE FROM THIS DREAM?
FEELINGS HAVE GONE LOST AGAIN; CAN I WAKE FROM THIS DREAM?

HAVE WE LOST OURSELVES? HAVE WE DIED INSIDE?
IS THERE SOMETHING MORE? HAVE WE ACTUALIZED?

YOU SAY REALITY IS NOTHING MORE THAN YOU WANT IT TO BE,
I SAY REALITY IS SO MUCH MORE THAN YOU CAN SEE.

REALITY IS MORE THAN PERCEPTION; MY DREAMING EYES HAVE BEEN SOWN SHUT.
HAVE WE LOST OUR VALUES? WILL OUR EYES OPEN UP?

FEELINGS HAVE GONE LOST AGAIN, CAN I WAKE FROM THIS DREAM
FEELINGS HAVE GONE LOST AGAIN, CAN I WAKE FROM THIS DREAM.

MY DREAMS ARE NOW MY NIGHTMARES.
