EYES OPENED, I CAN FINALLY SEE,
HOW MUCH YOU'VE DONE FOR ME,
RESISTANT AND STANDING STILL,
I COULDN'T SEE YOUR WILL.

I PUSHED AWAY YOUR GRACE, NOW I'VE FOUND MY PLACE.

CHAINS BROKEN BY YOUR GRACE,
OUR HEARTS SEEK YOUR FACE,
SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING MORE,
SEARCHING TO BE RESTORED...

OVERWHELMING LOVE, I AM NOW COMPLETE

CHAINS BROKEN BY YOUR GRACE,
OUR HEARTS SEEK YOUR FACE,
SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING MORE,
SEARCHING TO BE RESTORED...
