I'VE BECOME UNINSPIRED, A BROKEN SOUL THAT HAS GROWN TIRED,
I AM A SIMPLE MAN, WITH A HEART THAT HAS GROWN BLAND

WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES, BUT HOW LONG UNTIL WE BREAK?
WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES, BUT HOW LONG UNTIL WE'RE FAKE?

OUR HEARTS ARE CHAINED WITH HATE,
WE FAIL TO SEE WHAT LOVE CREATES.

AM I HEARTLESS, OR AM I NUMB?
(OR AM I NUMB)
I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT I'VE BECOME.
(WHAT HAVE I BECOME?)

GIVE ME LOVE, MAKE ME INSPIRED,
I NEED THIS MORE THAN ANYTHING I'VE DESIRED.

OUR HEARTS ARE CHAINED WITH HATE,
WE FAIL TO SEE WHAT LOVE CREATES.

AM I HEARTLESS, OR AM I NUMB?
(OR AM I NUMB)
I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT I'VE BECOME.
(WHAT HAVE I BECOME?)

LET LOVE FILL OUR HEARTS, TEAR DOWN THE WALLS WE CREATED.
