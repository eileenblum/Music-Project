WE QUESTION OUR PURPOSE, FINDING NOTHING BUT FEAR, COMING TO NO CONCLUSIONS, QUESTIONING WHY WE ARE HERE.

I HAVE SEARCHED FOR MEANING, AND FOUND NOTHINGNESS; I TURNED MY EYES TO THE HEAVENS, ASKING FOR FORGIVENESS. I FELT NOTHING AT THE TIME, AND LOST ALL HOPE, THOUGHTS TURNED TO SUICIDE, WITH A LIFE I COULDN'T COPE. BUT SOMETHING CHANGED INSIDE, SOMETHING IN MY HEART, FILLING THIS EMPTY VOID, OF A LIFE TORN APART. HAD MY PRAYERS BEEN ANSWERED, BY A GOD FROM ABOVE? DID HE HEAR MY CRIES? I FELT A NEW LOVE. BECAUSE OF THAT CROSS, MY LIFE TURNED AROUND, AND TO THE CHAINS THAT HELD MY HEART, I AM NO LONGER BOUND.
