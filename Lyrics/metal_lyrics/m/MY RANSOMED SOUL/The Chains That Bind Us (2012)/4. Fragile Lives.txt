SWALLOW YOUR PRIDE

HOW HUMBLING,
IS IT TO KNOW?
THAT ALL OF THIS,
MEANS NOTHING

WE FOCUS ON,
SUCH FRAGILE LIVES,
WHEN NONE OF THIS
IS WHAT IT SEEMS

HOW LONG MUST WE, FIGHT FOR NOTHING, NOTHING AT ALL.
OH LOST, GENERATION WHERE ARE YOU NOW?

HOW CAN WE BE SAFE?
WHEN WE ARE UNCLEAN?
HOW CAN WE BE WHOLE?

WE FOCUS ON,
SUCH FRAGILE LIVES,
WHEN NONE OF THIS
IS WHAT IT SEEMS

HOW HUMBLING,
IS IT TO KNOW?
THAT ALL OF THIS
MEANS NOTHING.

CHOKE DOWN YOUR PRIDE.
