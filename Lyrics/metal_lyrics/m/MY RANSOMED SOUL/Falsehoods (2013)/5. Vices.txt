This is the time to repent of every fleshly desire
This is the time to forego the lust I have inside.
How can I stay pure, when my eyes still wander?
How can I stay strong when my heart is weak?
My flesh will never be satisfied, my lust will hunger on.
Keep my eyes on something more; keep my eyes on something pure
My heart is willing but my flesh is weak, give me something to truly seek.
We all have our needs; we all want the same thing.
There is a time and place, yet I set my own pace.
There is a time and place; it's time to make a change.
There must be more than this; there must be more than this.
Rip my eyes out from my skull; I am a selfish man,
Rip my eyes out from my skull, cause i don't need them anymore.
Keep my eyes on something more; keep my eyes on something pure
My heart is willing but my flesh is weak, this is something i truly seek.
Break off the vices, conquer our desires
Break off the vices, keep my thoughts higher.
