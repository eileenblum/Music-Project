[feat. Ricky Armellino of This or the Apocalypse]A voice cries out for help, does anyone hear?
Is that voice ignored, or are we hard of hearing?
How can we see our brothers suffering, and yet still do nothing?
How can we see our brothers suffering, and yet still do nothing?
Are we just a heartless breed? Is our only motive greed?
We can be the change; we can meet the need,
We will lift our voices till our throats bleed,
and on my final day, I hope they see the change,
We pick each other up, I hope you do the same.
We cannot stand idle anymore, we are the impact,
We cannot be ignored.
I made bail; Iâm getting out this cell
I'm more than paychecks and selfish distance
I sought the edge of my soul, climbing my way out this hole.
I made bail; Iâm getting out this cell
I'm more than paychecks and selfish distance
I sought the edge of my soul, letting go.
We can be the change; we can meet the need,
We will lift our voices till our throats bleed,
and on my final day, I hope they see the change,
We pick each other up, I hope you do the same.
If we want change then it must start with us,
If we want change then we must take a stand,
I refuse to sit and watch as others suffer,
We are a part of a bigger plan.
This is our time to act now.
This is our time to act.
