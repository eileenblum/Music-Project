I have come to bring a war not peace,
On the corruption of your beliefs,
There's a difference between wrong and right,
This is a call to put up a fight.
I will not co-exist with your lies.
I will not turn a blind eye, but peace will not come at this time.
This is our time, this is our prime; we must take our stand.
Sick of the lies, with open eyes, we will make demands.
Persecute me; at least I know where I stand,
At the throne of god my life is in his hands.
I will love the broken; I will hate the disease,
We must stay united, together brought to our knees,
There must be resistance, before we lose our existence.
I will not turn a blind eye, but peace will not come at this time.
I will not turn a blind eye, but peace will not come at this time.
This is our time, this is our prime; we must take our stand.
Sick of the lies, with open eyes, we will make demands.
We will not relent until every heart repents.
We will not relent until every heart repents.
