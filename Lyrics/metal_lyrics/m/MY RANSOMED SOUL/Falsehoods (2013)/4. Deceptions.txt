Open your eyes you simple minded fool,
You still can't see the hate you fuel,
You're closed minded, with a blackened heart,
Empty words were dead from the start,
You've been selling yourself out for a throne of lies.
You're not one of us, you are the disease.
You're not one of us, you are the disease.
You only see what you want to see, spewing ignorance and disbelief.
You preach love, but its hate you desire, take your place in the fire.
Claim the name of something you're not, is truth something we've truly forgot?
Who are you fighting for? (Who are you fighting?)
What are you lying for? (Is it worth dying for?)
You're not one of us, you are the disease.
You're not one of us, you are the disease.
You've been compromising, and we're sick of all you're lying,
You've been spreading hate like it's going out of style, yet we know where your heart is.
This flame has been rising, and you've been showing your true colors,
Now it's time to come clean.
Claim the name of something you're not, is truth something we've truly forgot?
Who are you fighting for? (Who are you fighting?)
What are you lying for? (Is it worth dying for?)
This disease will kill us all.
