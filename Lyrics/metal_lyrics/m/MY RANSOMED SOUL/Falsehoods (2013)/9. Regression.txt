There's nothing left here.
There is nothing left here.
You once had passion, but passions out of style,
You once preached love, but now you live in denial,
You once had passion, but passions out of style,
You once preached love, but now you live in denial,
Have you lost faith, or did you have it at all?
It's hard to be strong, when all your heroes fall.
Have we lost our way, our hearts have gone astray,
Have we lost our core, we once were so much more,
Have we lost our way, our hearts have gone astray,
Have we lost our core, we are what we abhorred.
Instead of holding on, you've been holding out,
You have lost purpose; you are filled with doubt,
The wicked will have their hearts exposed,
But the faithful will reap what they sow.
You once had passion, but passions out of style,
You once preached love, but now you live in denial,
You once had passion, but passions out of style,
You once preached love, but now you live in denial,
We once were something, we once were more,
We once fought for, what we now abhor.
Have we lost our way, our hearts have gone astray,
Have we lost our core, we once were so much more,
Have we lost our way, our hearts have gone astray,
Have we lost our core, we are what we abhorred.
There is nothing left here.
There is nothing left.
