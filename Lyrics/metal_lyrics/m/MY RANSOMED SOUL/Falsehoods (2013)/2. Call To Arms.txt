This is a call to arms.
The vultures have corrupted their deals; they won't stop until everyone kneels,
We are nothing but pawns in their game; we are the only ones to blame,
Satanic rituals before our very eyes, they are all just serpents in disguise.
This is no surprise; we have closed our eyes,
We are the foolish ones; our pain has just begun,
How can we trust when all systems fail? We must stand united,
To fight the fight, so truth will prevail, or we will fall divided.
We have given them all our trust, now we will fall.
This mindless creature will destroy us all.
We have allowed them to corrupt; we have allowed them to steal,
Protect the hope that you have inside, the threat at hand is real.
How can we trust when all systems fail? We must stand united,
To fight the fight, so truth will prevail, or we will fall divided.
This is a call to arms; we will not play this game,
This is a call to arms; this world will never be the same.
