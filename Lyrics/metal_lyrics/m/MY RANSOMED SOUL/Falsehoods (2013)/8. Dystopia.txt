They are all just tyrants; we are all just part of the machine.
Every nation will rise, and form as one,
Reduce population size, we have nowhere to run.
This is a false sense of security; we must sever the ties,
A new world, full of disorder, filled with empty lies.
Will you stand for what you believe in, or will you fall on your own blade?
Will you stand for what you believe in, or will you fall on your own blade?
We will stand our ground, instead of being bound,
Open your eyes, find truth all around,
Use the tools at hands; this will be our stand,
Rise up and fight the system, the time is now at hand.
There will be nothing but tyranny, we will be enslaved,
Our eyes must have clarity, and our minds must be engaged.
We are more than conspiracy; we are called to revolt,
This is more than just fallacy, this machine must unbolt.
We will stand our ground, instead of being bound,
Open your eyes, find truth all around,
Use the tools at hands; this will be our stand,
Rise up and fight the system, the time is now at hand.
As we stare death in the face, where will you stand?
As we're forced into slavery, will your faith be damned?
