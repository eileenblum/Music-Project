My mind is torn, to find truth in reality.
My heart is worn, is this our actuality?
We have become so self-consumed,
We have chosen to hang our own noose.
We have become so self-consumed,
We have chosen to hang our own noose.
We have ignored all grace, have we lost all our faith?
We have ignored all grace, have we become a disgrace?
We focus on what we can see; we always struggle to believe,
Our trust lies in nothingness, as our souls start to digress.
We cannot do this alone, how far have we gone from home?
We cannot stand alone; we have left our hearts to roam.
We have tested our odds; we have made our own gods.
We have given up without even coming close, we have left behind what matters most,
Trading truth for a lie without a second thought, all while forgetting that for which we fought.
We have become so self-consumed,
We have chosen to hang our own noose.
We have become so self-consumed,
We have chosen to hang our own noose.
We have ignored all grace, have we lost all our faith?
We have ignored all grace, have we become a disgrace?
We focus on what we can see; we always struggle to believe,
Our trust lies in nothingness, as our souls start to digress.
We stand in disbelief, where is our faith?
