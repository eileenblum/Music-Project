[D. Wayne / K. Vanderhoof / C. Wells]

Many, many years ago on a distant shore
Men did gather secretly beyond a hidden door
They travelled long, they travelled far
Dark into the night
Yes, this is the place they've chosen
To build the Metal site.

Congregation rises, starts to chant a hymn
Of evil, lust and hatred, the root of every sin
The priest, he stands before them, tells them why they are this way
Why they worship metal gods each and every day
By the hand of Oberon, dark into the deep
Love the evil things we do, the secrets that we keep

Metal church, unholy, who'll be the sacrifice?
Metal church, the only, don't you know the time is right
Metal church will find you, can't run very far
The metal church inside you,
It knows just who you are, who you are.

No use in speaking out against anything we do
While the men of earth they sleep, haven't any clue
Now the story starts again, all the time is lost
Metal Church begins anew....
Saving souls that are lost.

Metal church, unholy, who'll be the sacrifice
Metal church, the only, don't you know the time is right
Metal church will find you, can't run very far
The metal church inside you,
It knows just who you are, knows just who you are.

The metal church
