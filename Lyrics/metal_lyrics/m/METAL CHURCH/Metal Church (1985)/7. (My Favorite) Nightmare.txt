[D. Wayne / K. Vanderhoof / C. Wells]

Better flood that restless soul of ecstasy and fright
In a path, splattered gore is strewn all through the night
Wakin' up at the midnight hour, my body's soaked in sweat
All my friends are down the stairs, watching the TV set

Hearing now a scratching noise outside my window pane
Wondering if it's real or am I going insane
Running fast to lock the doors, a banshee now awaits
Seconds count, I'll warn my friends, or is it now too late?

Mister bad-ass friend of mine is the first one out to check
Through the door we hear the gulps and splatters on the deck
Ripping flesh, entrails fly, we hear him slowly die
Then the cry of the banshee deep in the night

Scream! Scream for your life!
Scream! Scream for your life!
Ah! No!
