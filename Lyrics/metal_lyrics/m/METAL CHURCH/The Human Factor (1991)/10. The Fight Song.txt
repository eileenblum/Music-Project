[C. Wells / J. Marshall / K. Arrington / D. Erickson / M. Howe]

In these days of depressing times,
There stands one final truth
There's no doubt in my mind at all:
the future belongs to the youth

So take a stand and show them the best you can do
The odds are against you, or so you assume
Fight for your rights, they're yours to keep
So fight and make it right

The road is a long and a treacherous one
Draw on the strength from within
Don't be discouraged by a slap in the face
The struggle has yet to begin

So take a stand and show them the best you can do
The odds are against you, or so you assume
Fight for your rights, they're yours to keep
So fight and make it right

So take to the streets and find a new way
Confusion in masses, the law of today
Ride out the storm, it's tougher than ever
Can't you see? We're in this together

Endowed with a free will and thoughts for expression
Don't let them fall by the way
Strengthen and use them but don't you abuse them
Help build a better day

So take a stand and show them the best you can do
The odds are against you, or so you assume
Fight for your rights, they're yours to keep
So fight and make it right
Make it right
Make it right
Make it right
