Black night step into madness lose sight against your will
Last night begging forgiveness for that one time thrill
Black night another prescription take 10 to ease the pain
Last night another deception you think you're going insane

Demons rising as you cast them away little pills of color make them stay
Just another pill have you got your fill
Just another pill a pill for the kill

Your lost far from enchantment you found a better way
Comatose another dependent another sad, sad day
You're back, back with a vengeance you want to score again
So string higher than ever with a Cheshire grin

Here, take this and everything will be fine, trust me
