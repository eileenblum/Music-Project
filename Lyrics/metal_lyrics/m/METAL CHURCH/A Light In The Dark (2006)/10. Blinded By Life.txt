In a web of confusion you're strangled by your fear
A hopeless situation you've been in for years
No hope for tomorrow, no hope for today
Always defending mistakes that you've made

When you're lost on the wrong side and you're feeling no pain
You plead for absolution but nothing's left to gain
You're far from the truth and you're near to what's right
Make a decision without losing sight
You're blinded by life and the mask is your darkness
Blinded by life with one foot in the grave
Blinded by life and you hide in the darkness
Blinded by life with one foot in the grave

We want a perfect world we want the silver spoon
But if there was we'd find a way to reduce it into ruins
We're picking up the pieces we're always playing a game
One day we'll realize we are all to blame
