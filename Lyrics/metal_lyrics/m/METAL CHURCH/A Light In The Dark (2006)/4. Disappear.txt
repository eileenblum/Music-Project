In this lost and lonely place is where I call my home
Four thick walls surrounding me I pay a heavy toll

I'm pushing and pushing trying to claw my way back
Wishing, wishing I could disappear just like that

There is this voice inside my head turns from friend to foe
When will all this madness stop neither of us knows

How did I get this way how could I get this far
Was this the master plan was it written in the stars
For me to live my life as a pessimistic fool
A superficial man the exception to the rule
Mark your words and you will see the price
That I have paid the cost of life the wounded soul
Nothing ventured, nothing gained

The hands have stopped out on the clock I'm on the astral plane
The things I've done won't be forgot my image still remains
