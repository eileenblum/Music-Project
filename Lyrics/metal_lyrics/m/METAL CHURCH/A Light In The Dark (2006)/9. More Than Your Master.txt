Before the walls begin to fall, before the end it takes us all,
You know we're running out of time but moving faster
When will we ever heed the call, will we heed it one and all,
You know we've always been our own walking disaster

And when you look around you have found it's more than just your master

When the buildings were ablaze, and the height of terror raised, by fire we watched them burn into black skies
The world's living in denial, every woman, man, and child, our children running scared and asking why
