A taste of fear in the recipe as he stirs the potion up
Flirting with the other side enough to call his bluff
As the flames and the smoke grow thick a figure begins to rise
Looking up it says to him, "Son you must decide"

Caught up in evil 'cause he's too blind to see
Now he's the believer and the believer deceives

Into the void of his memories lie the answers
Why he finds a friend in the need to sin
It makes him feel alive but the path he's on
Will lead to hell for that he must repent but after all
The damage done the devil's new servant

He don't know what he believes
