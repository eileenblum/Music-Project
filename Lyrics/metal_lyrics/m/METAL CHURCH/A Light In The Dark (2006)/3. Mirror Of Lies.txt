When you look at yourself you can see a bewildering soul
A shell of a once stable man who's lost all control
You've journeyed so long now you've sealed all your plans
But when you look at your reflection you try to understand

In the mirror of lies

From the mystical gates of your past to the depths of the sea
No matter how hard you try things will be what they will be
When looking for secrets just close your eyes
You're searching for the answer but the answers are inside

In the mirror of lies

The spell is broken the scars will fade reflections of mistakes
You once made a pawn or a token
A king or a thief gaze into the mirror and believe
