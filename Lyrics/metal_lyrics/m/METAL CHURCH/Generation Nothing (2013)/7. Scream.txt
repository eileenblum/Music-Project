Like a loaded gun
Aimed at everyone
Trying to get somewhere before your time is done
The grinding never ends
It wears you down and then
Chews you up and spits you out and starts again

Like a torture that's only in your head
Want to crawl out of my skin
I cant forget all the things that you said
How the hell did you get in

Screaming like a mad man that no one ever hears
Running at the speed of light while I'm standing here
You had your nasty hooks in me but I'm on to your game
Crazy but now I'm completely sane

This train is off the track
And theres no going back
This time I will see the other side of black
Tried to smash me down
I'm coming back around
You'll get what's coming to you never to be found

Like a torture that's only in your head
Want to crawl out of my skin
I cant forget all the things that you said
How the hell did you get in

Screaming like a mad man that no one ever hears
Running at the speed of light while I'm standing here
You had your nasty hooks in me but I'm on to your game
Crazy but now I'm completely sane
