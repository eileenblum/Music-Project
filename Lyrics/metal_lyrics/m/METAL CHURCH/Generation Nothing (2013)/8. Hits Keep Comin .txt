Walk into a distant room bare walls speak loud and clear
You left no shadows for me to see can't believe that you're not here
Your missing face the bitter taste I long to be inside
But hurtful words left you disturbed so you left it all behind

All of the reasons why you did not stay 
And all of the reasons before
Take all your baggage and put it away
You keep knocking at all the wrong doors

And the hits just keep on comin

Mistakes are made apologies few and you always place the blame
You canât control the things you do youâre a monkey with no name
I canât believe the tapestry of lies hang on the wall
One day exposed we all will know and we will watch it fall

All of the reasons that you did not stay 
Were all of the reasons to go
Take all your baggage and put it away
You keep knocking at all the wrong doors
No more excuses and no foul play
You had your fill of it all
I couldnât change it 
Iâm going insane
Now I just stare at the walls

And the hits just keep on comin
