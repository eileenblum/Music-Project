Rain forever, darkened skies
Hopeless is a way of life out here
No one ever sees the sun, got a future on the run in fear
The walking dead they lurk the streets, 
The whores and damaged industry of night
Morbidly they carry on
No one's home, the lights are on
This place is where death comes to die
We're livin here in Dead City
We're livin here in Dead City
Eternal gray and soaking wet.
The homeless man has paid his debt to her
Mother Nature held the cards
The river feeds but not to ours, you'll learn
The monster of the corporate world 
Destroyed the dream, the everyman in sight

No one's home, the lights are on
This place is where death comes to die
We're livin here in Dead City
We're livin here in Dead City

It's the end of everything we knew
Dreams are gone the monster stole them too
This is not the place that I once knew
It's the end, in front of you
It's the end of everything it's true

Theres no way of livin in this place
A slow slow death staring you in the face

We're living here in Dead City
We're living here in Dead City
We're living here in Dead City
Don't want to die in Dead City
