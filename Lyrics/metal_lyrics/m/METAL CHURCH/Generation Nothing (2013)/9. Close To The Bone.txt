The bills I can't pay it's the same everyday
All of my life I've done what I thought was right, the way it should be
But deep in the night when it all just comes to light, of how it could be

Can't find that gold mine 
I'm sub prime 
And living too close to the bone

I'm just a wreck and I'm pacing the floor
The voices are growing too loud
I need a fix just to get me through this
The cause of this problem is your endless lies
Lies only you can believe
Your death is the fix that can get me through this

Then comes a time what just what you thought was right is something different
But deep in the night when it all should come to light of what it could be
