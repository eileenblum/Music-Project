Generation nothing, walks a crooked path
Generation nothing, never coming back
Got no dreams just plans and schemes and things to never tell
Generation nothing lives in hell

I'm just a damage case who just found overdrive
Another chance to be alive
I'm just a man in space who's learned waste his time
Living a life barely alive
Forever doing time

Generation nothing has got itself to blame
Generation nothing, is just a video game
Lives a life of idle bliss, got a gun and never miss
Generation nothing slash your wrist
I'm just a man in space who's learned waste his time
Living a life barely alive
Forever doing time
