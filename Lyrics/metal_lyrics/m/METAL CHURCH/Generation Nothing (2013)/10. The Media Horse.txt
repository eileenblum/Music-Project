Mechanical waste is all we offer we suffer the taste then eat some more
Look for bare space weâll place an add no matter what itâs for
The visual leaks into the after the retina bakes a greenish glow
The human touch lost to man made waves the propaganda show

Is the remote slitting your throat 
The channels just fly away
Easing your pain numbing your brain
Itâs TV tI'me

Let's begin
Just push send
And now we're the horse 
Let's watch it again

Is there a way to burn the motor is there a way to set things right
To much info a new world order pray for the light
How many eyes must burn with anger before the screen breaks and slowly dies
Take a long break our souls recover in tI'me for a new ride

Is the remote cutting your throat 
The channels just pass you by
Easing your pain numbing your brain
Itâs drama time
