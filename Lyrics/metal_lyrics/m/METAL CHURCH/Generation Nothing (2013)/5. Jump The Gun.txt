There's no other place to run, and nothing new under the sun
Don't we hear the tolling of the bells
I thought we got beyond all this, with marching and the angry fist
Still we stand up shouting what the hell

Like rats in a cage, with uncontrolled rage
You lie to my face with a smile
The message was lost and we pay the cost
Of keeping your evil alive

Thy Kingdom come, you jumped the gun, you jumped the gun again
Thy Kingdom come, you jumped the gun, you jumped the gun again

Don't tell me it's a peaceful faith, I see the devil in your face
While you're killing in the name of God
Police yourselves is what I say, prove it or just go away
Your bloody hands are all you really got

This living hell, sometimes it's hard to tell
You've been deceived
Don't you point that thing at me
