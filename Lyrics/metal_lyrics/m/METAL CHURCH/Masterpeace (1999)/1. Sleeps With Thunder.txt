[K. Vanderhoof]

Is it just the Things you see that make it all worth while
Put your God into a box and keep him by your side
Hopeless is the refugee escaping from the truth
The mothership has passed you by now
there's nothing you can do

My time is finished here
Now choose what you must do
My eyes have shed the tears
And paid the price for you
Many here have seen the light
The devil sits and wonders
The man who keeps his heart a stone
Is the man who sleeps with thunder

Monuments and shrines are built to spirits that deceive
Soft associations with the angels you believe
Soon to find your friendly guides have lead you far astray
Now you walk in blackest night you never learned to pray

In your mind you pacify
Tricks and tales and lullabyes
Now you bid your soul goodbye

When you climb that mountain while the rain is coming round
The peak is only visible on your way back down
Everyone will tell you what it is you should believe
But hearing what you want to hear will give you no relief
