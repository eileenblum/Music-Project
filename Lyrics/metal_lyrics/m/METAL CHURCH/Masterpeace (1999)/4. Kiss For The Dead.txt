[D. Wayne / K. Vanderhoof]

It's the calm before the storm
Wishing you could see the light
Growing fear and sadness there
Can you tell its your final sight
Tubes and wires keep you here
Not alive and yet not dead
No feelings

You're wide awake in your head
While the prayers have been said
All the love thats been bled
Its just a kiss for the dead

In your world of constant dreams
A lifeless body with its frozen stare
People cry and pray for you to waken
All this pain you cannot bear
Wishing someone would pull the plug
All you do is shed a tear
No feelings

This world of sleeping, continue dreaming

To see the light now, in endless night now
Could cleanse this chaos from my mind

Lifeless body, frozen stare
In a world of constant dreams
Lifeless body, frozen stare
It's a different kind of sleep
No feelings
No feelings
