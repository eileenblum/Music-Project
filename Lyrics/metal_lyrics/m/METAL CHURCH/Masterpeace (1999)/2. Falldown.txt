[D. Wayne / K. Vanderhoof]

So now I've told you time after time
Jump to conclusions when you make up your mind
Is this the road you want to be on
You'll find out soon that it's not very long

Evil is breeding the master is grieving
A lie so deceiving
We all fall down

I see the news and it tells me each day
Is it a life when its not in the way
Which is it now please tell me this time
Before its too late and we all cross the line

Evil is breeding the master is grieving
Ashes to ashes
We all fall down

How many times will you let things go by
Before you stop believing the lie
As we are blindly lead right into the noose
