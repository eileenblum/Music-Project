[D. Wayne / K. Vanderhoof]

We will not follow Rome
The twisting of our faith
With the hand of God
You wrote the new light
The queen has decreed
You must believe like me
So it is written so it shall be
So it shall be

So the list was captured
And it's time for us to die
Following their orders
To enforce the lie
Village by village
Township by town
Hung drawn and quartered
Some where slowly drowned

They signed in blood
Proclaimed their faith
They signed in blood
And sealed their fate

Cause if your gonna die, die for what you believe in
There' s more to this world than meets the eye

The riders are coming the hoofbeats are thumping
The spectre of death leads the way
The queen has decreed the spiritual seed
Will be crushed out this day
And those who have signed be killed by the blind
The soldiers who'll slay
Thge names are above still written in blood
Are there to this day
