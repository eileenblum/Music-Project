[D. Wayne / K. Vanderhoof]

Hear the sounding, feel the pounding
Pain is coming, you don't know where
Blood is thick, you're feeling sick
Live with the choices you have made

Hard as stone it must be so
In a systematic life of lies

Flight or fight, run or die
You can't stand to even try
Rip it open, no more hoping
Time for you to rise and shine

I control the names I hold
But I can't fit into your mold

I know that I'm stronger than you are
In a world where nothing is faster than life

Search for answers, even after
Truth is whats upon your mind
On your face, its left no trace
Can't you read between the lines

Brand new day to do your crime
Pay your debt without a dime

Left unspoken, tales are broken
Carve a smile upon your face
Hear the phone, it's just a drone
No one hears your lonely moan

I can't change the world I see
But i can change the world in me

Now you know that the dying is easy
But its harder just staying alive
There are parts of the heart that are harder

Than the race that we run
Is faster than life
