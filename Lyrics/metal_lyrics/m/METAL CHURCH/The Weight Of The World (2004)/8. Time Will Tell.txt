[K. Vanderhoof / K. Arrington / J. Reynolds / R. Munroe]

Vacant eyes, a portrait of pain, every time I look at the world
Tell me why, we cannot bring change, we've flown to high on borrowed wings
What will tomorrow bring
Only time will tell, we're searching, to escape ourselves, before it's over
Guilt and lies, pave a road to nowhere, fear inside, everyday
But in the end, this web that we're caught in
Will release us, release us from pain
And things will change
We're looking for the rain to wash our shame away
We're waiting for the dawning of a new way
If things remain the same
We may not live to feel
To feel the winds of change
