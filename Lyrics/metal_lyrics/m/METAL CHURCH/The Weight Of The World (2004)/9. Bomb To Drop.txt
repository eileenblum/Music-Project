[K. Vanderhoof / R. Munroe]

Dreams of the dark embracing me, these thoughts I can't control
Searching for light to set me free, from my troubled soul
Good against evil battles in my mind, the fighting never stops
Man, I've struggled with temptation and sin, in my darkest thoughts
When will this nightmare ever stop, I'm waiting for the bomb to drop
I walked through the valley of the shadow of death, how did I survive
I stood at the flaming gates again, as the flames grew higher
What have I done to deserve this fate, what have I become
Though dark have been my dreams of late, I just need to be strong
I'm going down, its my last shot, I'm waiting for the bomb to drop
I'm on my knees and I'm praying for these dreams to cease, 
I'm screaming at the sky to open up my eyes
I'm in too deep and I'm headed for eternal sleep, 
I'm screaming at the sky, I'm running out of time
