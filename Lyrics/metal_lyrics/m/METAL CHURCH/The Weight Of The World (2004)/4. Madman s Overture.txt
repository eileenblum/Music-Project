[K. Vanderhoof]

I never was a man of wonder, nothing special in my eyes
Pedestrian of common streets, an angel in disguise
A childhood spent as any other, any other child
Would bring a great divide, and now these worlds collide
Now that many years have passed , these dreams intensify, no tools I use, no crystal ball
Yet I'm still mystified
Those sleepless nights by candlelight, in a room without a view
A voice I could not hear, it told me, "Write it down you fool"
It spoke to me of many things no language can explain, I grabbed my crucifix left hanging
by it's golden chain
Never in my wildest dreams, conceive of what I heard, I filled the well with ink
and began writing every word... in the night
I've seen the mountains crumbling, the masses running scared, I wrote it down to warn you all
but you laughed and no one cared
You wrote it down in riddles, no one could understand, I'll lead you to your padded room
You prophet-crazy man
Please hear me and heed every word that I've said, if you kill me
You'll be the one's who'll be dead... dead and gone
Your locks and your bars, will hide all my scars, but you'll never leave this place
Not til you open your eyes and your ears, can you make sense of the things that you fear?
And all that you've heard, it sounds so absurd, I'll never speak again
Not til you open your eyes and your ears, this world shall pass away
Withdrawn from reality, I stare into space, little did they know I held the answers to their fate
I didn't write in riddles, now you must understand, someday you... oh never mind
I'm just a crazy man
They say I'm just a madman, am I just a madman, I feel I'm just a madman...
