[K. Vanderhoof / K. Arrington / R. Munroe]

You're caught in a vice by your own device, torment and pressure, a way of life
You felt the stardom and tasted the fruit, you claw your way back
It's all that you can do
Falling from grace, so many have done, get to the top and bask in the sun
Make some mistakes, it's part of the game, when you play it everything's to gain
The weight of the world upon your shoulders, it's the weight of the world
The struggle within archaic desire, claim your right and devour
All that surrounds you, all you can take, don't let your last
Be your last mistake
The pressure is building, the vice becomes tighter, under the gun and into the fire
Burning and burning, no escape to be found
The weight of the world is keeping you down
The weight of the world upon your shoulders
The pressure is building, an unwilling soldier
The weight of the world is keeping you down
Oh, your world is crashing down to the ground
