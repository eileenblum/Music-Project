[K. Vanderhoof / R.Munroe]

Cleaning up the wreckage of the past, how many more times
Will we have to pass the test
Their eyes have been upon our every move, they're waiting for us
We answer not to you
It's blood money, we're paying all the time,
It's blood money, no reason or no rhyme
It's blood money, we're paying all the time
It's blood money
The crime is in their minds
Huddled masses hiding down below, they wait for freedom
For how long nobody knows
We're fearing for the future and the past, we're waiting for the next time
They stab us in the back
