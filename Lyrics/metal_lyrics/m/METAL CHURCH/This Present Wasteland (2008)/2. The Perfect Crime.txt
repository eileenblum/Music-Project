In the mind's eye we commit the perfect crime
We are drawing nearer, we're only one step away
When we visualize the destruction from inside
We tear ourselves apart and we are to blame

Too far and never near the ending will appear
To pose another question of what we hold dear
Our sanity reveals what is false and what is real
The grays that seem to haunt this unforgiving hell
We think we've fooled all of mankind
We have created the perfect crime

The answers intertwined, we often cross the line
We make our own reality and think life is fine
Life through a clouded lens, our judgment cloaked in sin
We fall from the highest point just to get up again

We think we've fooled all of mankind
We have created the perfect crime
The perfect crime
