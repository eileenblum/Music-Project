From way across the world, to right here where we are
The screams can still be heard in the silence of the night
The disciples spread the word and spare the non-believers
A message has been burned into the minds of all

Throughout the years some come and some have gone
You have the ears that tell the right from wrong
This is the reason why we have gone on so long
This is the reason why we still belong
Congregation

These walls that we have built hold many tales inside
The secrets of our lives are for all to read
The workings of our mind, both brilliant and insane
Only you can understand we don't do it for the fame
Throughout the years some come and some have gone
You have the ears that tell the right from wrong
This is the reason why we have gone on so long
This is the reason why we still belong

Our eyes have seen a lot of things, our eyes have seen the world
Our thoughts have moved the masses and left them wanting more
Our life our own reality, and we live it as we please
Spread the word to all that haven't heard and take our place in history
