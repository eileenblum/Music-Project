The blind will lead the blind again down a lonely path to hell
The fires await in the fading moon of another realm
The key is turned, it unlocks the grave, it awaits the dead
All casualties of a major plague under their command

Call out to them and they will follow
They are the rats that will beg and borrow
We're crawling to extinction
The whole human race, we're crawling to extinction

Punks on parade as they play their games
They're all one in the same
Lepers, tyrants, kings of disease
Send them to an early grave
Call out to them and they will follow
They are the rats that will beg and borrow
We're crawling to extinction
The whole human race, we're crawling to extinction

I just can't take anymore
All the lies and the spies with their tricks and their whores
We're lost in a world of greed, all that you have is all that we need,
All that you have is all that we need
