We come into this world to give and not to take
We stray the path intended further from the gates
We play with fire and we're always getting burned
When you walk unholy ground another lesson learned

Free again, free again
I know I can breathe again
I can breathe again

We're not alone, we're guided by a hand
We walk with angels, left footprints in the sand
My time is fading as I try to understand
The way I'm feeling, I bow to his command

I can breathe again, I can breathe again
Oh I can breathe again

The heart will mend with a touch upon the shoulder
Saying I'm alright now that I've crossed over
Memories now that I am older
Saying I'm alright now that I've crossed over
