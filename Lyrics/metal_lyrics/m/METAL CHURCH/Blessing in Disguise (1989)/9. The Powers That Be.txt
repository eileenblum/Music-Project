[K. Vanderhoof]

It's more than understanding, to realize just what it means
Interpretations, different meanings, can be drawn out of anything
It all makes sense now, I see it clear
The picture comes together, and I have lost the fear

Your heart is the key
The powers that be
Are handed to me

There is no suit of armor to pretect you from the dark
Just let your guard down, and the sword will hit the mark
The words get twisted, you hear the lies
Just takes a look around you, and pray they realize

Your heart is the key
The powers that be
My sanctuary

It's not what you wear, it's what's in your mind
It's not worth the emptiness inside
I have left all blackness behind
No more questions about black and white

A gift of free will, the choice is all up to you
Just let your faith rule, and you will know what to do
The cults grow stronger, I'll stay away
I'm looking at tomorrow, now I know the way

Your heart is the key
The powers that be
Are handed to me
