[K. Vanderhoof]

On the pedastal you stand of promises to keep
I can make the changes and keep you off the streets
I will never let you down, together we can win
All I need is your support, the funds keep flowing in

I am the one who will make all the difference
I am the one who cannot tell a lie

My opposition tells you that I am the bad guy
But I have done some research in his private life
I feel that it's my duty to let the people know
I know it's no one's business, I destroy to get a vote

I am the one who will make all the difference
I am the one who cannot tell a lie

Raise those banners, raise those flags
Raise your wages, raise your hands
No more war, all at peace
I have the solution to all the nation's needs
Hail to government, hail to liberty
Hail to God above, hail to me
No more war, all at peace
I am the solution to what this nation needs

My missile proposition is effective as can be
No trades for arms for hostages, no Star Wars shit for me
I'm an average person, blue collar all the way
Everyone will have a job, just cast your vote my way
