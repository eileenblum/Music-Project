[D. Wayne / K. Vanderhoof / C. Wells]

Obtain a cloak of power
That brings us all genocide
The further sands before the masses
Malevolence inside

[CHORUS]
Truth to falsify
Poisoning their minds
Hell is on the rise
The west must now align

Perceive what is right
Rush headlong into the fight
No way you'll take their lying
Their way of life is dying

[CHORUS]

Facing on us their will
Now's the time for us to kill
Invasion is the only answer
Infecting us like cancer
