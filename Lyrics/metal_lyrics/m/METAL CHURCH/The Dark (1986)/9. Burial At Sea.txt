[D. Wayne / K. Vanderhoof / C. Wells]

Black scared and bleeding
From the lashes to my soul
I chose to stand my ground
Not do as i was told
Thinking like mindless sheep
These people were my friends
Now i feel abandoned
With a pain that never ends

[CHORUS]
My blood is boiling now
On this journey to no avail
On this ship of fools
We're gonna die
Will no one listen to what i sayI saw the charts
I saw the maps
I know we're way of course

Try to stop this captain
His twisted wicked force
We're on a route
To certain death
To drown among the ice
I've got to stop this madness
Or the ship will pay the price

[SOLO]

Holding tight the prison bars
As we drift into the mist
I can't believe
This is happening
My guts they wrench and twist
The air is getting colder now
Sailing further north
I back down onto my knees
I cry out to the lord

[CHORUS]

In a icy wasteland
The sun begins to set
I see the frozen corpses
Of my shipmates
On the deck
I pull myself up on the rail
Make my one last prayer
Submerge myself in the depths
I drown my lifes despair
