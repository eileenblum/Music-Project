I can see the empty sky that's not to far away
There will be no place to hide, the light got in the way
Back to start do it again and try some other way
If you don't take it to heart you'll die another day

We don't suffer fools
That is the golden rule
We don't suffer fools
And you're a fool

If you build a house divide and build it on the sand
The tide rolls in and knocks it down and now it's no mans land
There will never be a time that you will live in peace
And no matter how you try you'll never find relief

We don't suffer fools
That is the golden rule
We don't suffer fools
And you're a fool

[Solo]

We don't suffer fools
That is the golden rule
We don't suffer fools

We don't suffer fools
That is the golden rule
We don't suffer fools

And you're a fool!
