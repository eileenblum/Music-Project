Time is taking it's sweet time
The clock is ticking and I'm going to lose my mind
So tell me, tell me how it feels
Whispering the everlasting mystery deal
Now if you really feel it's true
There's nothing you can ever say or ever do

Moving on with endless days
Leaving space along the way of emptiness
Pushing through these walls of mine
Hoping that somehow I'll find the present tense
Please before the sky falls in

With the devil on my back
My angels planning their attack
They're close behind
While you tell me how to feel
Do I spend the rest of my life trying to deal
Now if you really think it's true
There's nothing you can ever say or ever do

Moving on with endless days
Leaving space along the way of emptiness
Pushing through these walls of mine
Hoping that somehow I'll find the present tense
Please before the sky falls in

[Solo]

Moving on with endless days
Leaving space along the way of emptiness
Pushing through these walls of mine
Hoping that somehow I'll find the present tense
Moving on with endless days
Leaving space along the way of emptiness
Pushing through these walls of mine
Hoping that somehow I'll find the present tense
Please before the sky falls in...


Along the way
Along the way
Along the way
Along the way
Along the way........
