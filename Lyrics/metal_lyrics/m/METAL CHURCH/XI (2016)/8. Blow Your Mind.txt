Going to blow your mind
If you have the time

Now can you feel it moving through you
Like holding fire with your hands
Now can you feel the spirit moves you
To reveal the master plan
You see it coming all full circle
But you still don't understand
No waiting for the sky to fall in
Said the screaming preacher man

Going to blow your mind
If you have the time
Reaching for the sky
Shake the hand of time

[Solo]

Now I know you hear the words I'm saying
But there're things you don't believe
So if you take the plank from your eyes
Then maybe you can see
The proof of all it still surrounds you
But it's the forest through the trees
Or do you need a bigger picture
And a cure for all disease

Going to blow your mind
If you have the time
Reaching for the sky
Shake the hand of time

[Solo]

Going to blow your mind
If you have the time

Going to blow your mind
If you have the time
Reaching for the sky
Going to blow your mind
Shake the hand of time
