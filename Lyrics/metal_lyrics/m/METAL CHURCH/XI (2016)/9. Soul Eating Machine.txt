I'm gone I'm outta here, it's not the place for me
I've lost my sense of self and my reality
I can't believe my eyes, it's right in front of me
I watched you change your face
In hopes of changing me
Your never changing me

Like a soul eating machine
Feeding on my hopes and dreams
Screaming at the world outside
Now there's nothing left inside

How do you sleep at night?
Now that's a mystery
You blew up every bridge
You've got your hooks in me
Tell me just one more thing
How did you come to this
There's just one place for you
And it's your own abyss
Never to be missed

Like a soul eating machine
Feeding on my hopes and dreams
Screaming at the world outside
Now there's nothing left inside...
Nothing left inside

[Solo]

Like a soul eating machine
Feeding on my hopes and dreams
Screaming at the world outside
Now there's nothing left inside

Soul eating machine
Soul eating machine
Soul eating machine
Soul eating machine

Soul eating machine
