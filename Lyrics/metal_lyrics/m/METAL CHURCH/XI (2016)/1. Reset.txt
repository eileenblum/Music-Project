When you hear the lies
Somewhere deep the truth is hidden
look into my eyes
In the stone nothing is written

Feeling good, feeling strong
Didn't think I'd last this long
Reaching deep, my soul to keep
Praying every night for sleep
Turn the page in my old age
Now I'm at the final stage again
Now I hit the button to reset

Nothing truly dies
Now you're going to live forever
Now you realize
Finally you've found the answer

Feeling good, feeling strong
Didn't think I'd last this long
Reaching deep, my soul to keep
Praying every night for sleep
Turn the page in my old age
Now I'm at the final stage again
Now I hit the button to reset
Now I hit the button to reset

[Solo]

Feeling good, feeling strong
Didn't think I'd last this long
Reaching deep, my soul to keep
Praying every night for sleep
Turn the page in my old age
Now I'm at the final stage again
Now I hit the button to reset
Now I hit the button to reset
Now I hit the button to reset
