I can see the future
A needle and a suture
A deeper wound will long be healing
For on the ground you will be kneeling

You're looking up while it's tearing you down
Asking for nothing but taking you down
In for a penny you're in for a pound
You have become some warrior clown
Back to the start is where you want to be
Back to the start is where you want to be
And the needle changes history

Now you are my sculpture
The God of this, this new culture
Eternal youth is what I'm dealing
And on the ground you will be kneeling

You're looking up while it's tearing you down
Asking for nothing but taking you down
In for a penny you're in for a pound
You have become some warrior clown
Back to the start is where you want to be
Back to the start is where you want to be
And the needle changes history

[Solo]

You're looking up while it's tearing you down
Asking for nothing but taking you down
In for a penny you're in for a pound
You have become some warrior clown
Back to the start is where you want to be
Back to the start is where you want to be
And the needle changes history

I can see the future
A needle and a suture
I can see the future
A needle and a suture
