In your eyes a veiled disguise
No surprise
Now it waits for you

Into the fray it went away
Or so they say
Still it waits for you

Still inside the great divide
Is growing wide
There it waits for you

Alone I pray for all who say
They've lost their way
And it waits for you

And it waits for you!
And it waits for you!
And it waits for you!

[Solo]

In your eyes a veiled disguise
No surprise
Now it waits for you

Into the fray it went away
Or so they say
Still it waits for you

Out of the night, into the light of the dawn
There's nobody here, all that you love is now gone

Still inside the great divide
Is growing wide
There it waits for you

Alone I pray for all who say
They've lost their way
And it waits for you

Look out....

[Solo]

They wait for you
They wait for you
They wait for you
They wait for you
They wait for you...
They wait for you
