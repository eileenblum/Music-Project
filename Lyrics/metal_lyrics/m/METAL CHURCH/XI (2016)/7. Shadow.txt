Sneaking up behind you
Can you feel my breath upon your neck
You won't see me coming
Just a spirit no one can detect

Look in my eyes, you'll never know
You turn your back and run away
You'll never see, just what I see
I am the dark that won't let go
I am shadow

[Solo]

Hiding in the corners
Silence is a weapon perfect
You will always find me
In the places you try to protect

In my disguise, a darkened glow
I'm right beside you every day
I guarantee, I'll never be
Another that you will outgrow
I am shadow
I am shadow

[Solo]

Sneaking up behind you
Can you feel my breath upon your neck
You won't see me coming
Just a spirit no one can detect
I am shadow, shadow, shadow
I am shadow, shadow, shadow
I am shadow, shadow, shadow
I am shadow, shadow, shadow
I am shadow
I am shadow
I am shadow...
I am shadow
