And when your hear the sound
Of your life crashing down
And no one seems to give a damn
You will be all alone
Left in the danger zone
A very sad and lonely man
Do you understand?

And when it's time to pay
For all your evil ways
Your story no one will believe
Watch what your life becomes
You're begging for the crumbs
And you've got no tricks up your sleeve
You're just a thief!

Killing your time
You've just been killing your time
Killing your time
You're all just killing your time
Again...

You've got your hooks in it
and draining every bit
Of any good that can be found
But she can't see the man
Who's in a garbage can
Until his ship has run aground...
And never found

Killing your time
You've just been killing your time
Killing your time
You're all just killing your time
Again...

[Solo]

Killing your time
You've just been killing your time
Killing your time
You're all just killing your time
The end...

Again...
