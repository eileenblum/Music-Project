Future is something that you'll never know,
Something that's hiding that will never show,
Seeing the fingers are pointing at you when you die!
Losing your mind is like losing your soul,
Something youâre fighting while losing control,
You're on your knees while youâre throwing your hands to the sky!

All the kings and all their kingdoms,
Pay the price for all your needs,
All the kings know what they're doing,
Live your life like there will be,
No tomorrow!
No tomorrow!

Your damaged mind is now taking its toll,
Changing perception distorting the soul,
Reaching for things that will only exist in your mind!
Just when think youâve found security,
Iâll take you away into obscurity,
Spending your days searching for all the things you canât find!
All the kings and all their kingdoms,
Pay the price for all your needs,
All the kings know what they're doing,
Live your life like there will be,
No tomorrow!
No tomorrow!
No tomorrow!
No tomorrow!

[Solo]

All the kings and all their kingdoms,
Pay the price for all your needs,
All the kings know what they're doing,
Live your life like there will be,
No tomorrow!
No tomorrow!
No tomorrow!
No tomorrow!
