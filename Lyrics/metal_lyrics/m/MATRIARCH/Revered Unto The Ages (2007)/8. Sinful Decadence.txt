[Ambusias:]
Do you fear to loose your flesh and beauty?
YouÂ´ll never have to go hunting for another dream again.

[Humanity:]
Harsh Voice of doom,
An element unknown,
A perpetrator in my thoughts,
A forest of light that makes them blind,
The mirage is now behind
Ambusias-Come with me, youÂ´ll see the red light
You will never fear no more
Because youÂ´ll have everything you ever wanted

Forget her and come with me!!

[Charmeine:]
I will love you, hold you and never let you fall!

[Charmeine:]
Come with me and you will survive the deaths of all living deaths.
You will decide whether you live or not!

[Chorus:]
[Humanity:]
You will never exist in my reality,
Seducing me in my sleep.

[Ambusias:]
DonÂ´t listen "Cette Merde"
With me you will be save.
This journey you wont regret.

[Charmeine:]
Come with me and you will survive the deaths of all living deaths.
You will decide whether you live or not!

[Charmeine:]
DonÂ´t listen to this shit, with me you will be saved
To be or not to be is a question to believe
Come with me see that morning bright you never realized?
Just listen, donÂ´t follow follow him or your soul will be destroyed.
If your liberty depends on what you believe,
YouÂ´ll never feel the pleasure
Of what life means to you.

[Ambusias:]
Why do you think such unreality?
Open your eyes to me!!!
Your treasure is waiting!
Your pleasure is waiting!
Now open your eyes to me!!

[Chorus]

[Humanity:]
Abscence of Dawn fills me with hate
Absence of Dusk fills me with strength

[Ambusias:]
How do you know about my atrocities
If you never cross this empty path?
Because youÂ´ll have everything you ever wanted,
Come with me and forget her!!!
I will come back in your dreams waiting for you to fall on your knees!
