Requiem Aeternam dona ei,
Domine, et lux perpetus luceat ei.
Heresy, enemy of society, denies faith to get lost in a maze,
Blood spread through the valleys; hunters went to hunt their lies.

[Chorus:]
And while dust spread through the valleys
All believe were drenched in blood...
Absolute power. Absolute truth.
Trying so hard for harmony,
Killing those melodies of truth.
Where is thou faith? Against faith?
Domine, exhaudi in vocem mean
Et lux, requiem, mundi!
A newborn blasphemy into and odd society; fucked up monetary.
Et impse redimet ex inquitatibus ejus
A newborn blasphemy into and odd society; fucked up monetary.
De profundis clamaviadte Domine
Requiem aeternam, et lux perpetua
Master, what is the meaning of this harsh inscription?
"Mercy" and "justice" denied them even a name,
Bare extremities thorn by the Rope of death
Under the command of perverse minds
There was a roaring in the wind all night.
Dead birds are singing in the distant woods.

[Chorus]

Exsultabult Domino Ã³ssa humiliate
Offerentes eam in cospectu Altissimi.
