[Inspired from Dante Alighieri]

When the sense of self is lost, to a dream that didnÂ´t exist
But the dream that I would feel is the silence that I breathe.

In my lifeÂ´s journey I woke to find myself alone in the dark
Woods which its memory brings me a shape of fear.
Death would scare me more than this place,
But IÂ´ll recount all that I found revealed by GodÂ´s grace

So did I turn my soul being fugitive from deathÂ´s living image,
To go down to a place where no one had left alive.
Three temptations wanted to turn me back into the woods.
So many souls they have brought to endless grief?!

Without any more words of sorrow my eyes could see
Ancient spirits tired up in endless pain and hear their
Lamentations as each bemoans the second death of souls.
You shall see far in the mountains souls in fire;
Whoever enters here should abandon all hope.

When the sense of self is lost, to a dream that didnÂ´t exist
But the dream that I would feel is the silence that I breathe.
