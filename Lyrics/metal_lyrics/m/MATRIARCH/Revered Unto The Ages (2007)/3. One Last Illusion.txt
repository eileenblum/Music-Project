Illusions that will never see light again,
Pleasure I will no longer feel today.
Departure of art that will only be saved in your soul.
Liquor that will flow through my veins until I die, forever.

Dream that I believe once again will come true
Darkness of mild reality gave to me weep that crossed my section of faith.
Doom of praise and morbid melodies
Tragic winds of Black Death clouds
Seem to be the end of thy dream

Praying, dying, yearning for a simple change
Praying, dying, yearning for that day to come
Praying, dying, yearning for a simple change
Praying, dying, yearning my one Last illusion.

Mortis YÂ´all! Now IÂ´m sinking in pain
One Last Illusion, one...
Mortis! A fatal tragedy!

[Chorus:]
Meine ruh ist hoer, mein hertz ist shwer ich finder,
Ich finder sie nimmer und nimmermer
Still bei nact und nimmer,
Ist, Blunden die wind und freliches.

[Chorus]

I wish I could have changed
One Last Illusion!
This random move of my life
All I wish for
One Last Illusion!
Is now trapped in Gone.

I was born to hear your morbid melodies
And to feel the rhythm I now swallow.

[Chorus]

So long I yearned for change in lectures,
But now I simply wait for nothing,
Losing my one last illusion,
Now sinking in pain.
All I see is a dark light that never seems to end,
Now I wait for another bad dream to overcome.
