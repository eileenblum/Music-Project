[Chorus:]
I thought about this so long
Anticipating this moment in my head
Pressured with insecurities and limiting myself
Imprisoned in this hell and vanished away

There is no mood left to kill
Only time wasted to fill
Feel the flesh in her body
Only time wasted to fill.

[Chorus]

You knew about this for quite some time,
Engrave, magnify my fury,
The flesh you only posses for my satisfaction make me tremble.
Deadly intentions alleviate my pain (deny).

Endless creatures controlling my (disturbed) soul
(and) feeling, powerless losing myself control
Only time wasted to fill
There is no mood left to kill
Only time wasted to fill.

[Chorus]
