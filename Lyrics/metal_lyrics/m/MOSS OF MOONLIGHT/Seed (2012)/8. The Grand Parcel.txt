Fog stirs at the messengerâs feet, like a ghost crossing the threshold
he holds the final words, in his hands
he holds my awakening.

You were bright with wanderlust (must be free)
yet I knew you would long for home (long to leave)
I pleaded (let me go)
please donât go (far from sea, pleaseâ¦)
but you never listened (let me go)
not to the ocean-call (let me leave)
not to me (strength in hand)
so I let you go (as I go, far from the sea)

Free like mist and the snarling sea
like darkling trees and the feral wind
I bid you farewell, forever more...

You are shadowed, lightless-eyed (I am free)
you will never come home (ever free)
I plead (deep this pain)
live again, my daughter (long to leave, pleaseâ¦)
but the dead do not listen (release me)
not to fathers (in the end)
not to oceans (quiet screams)
bid you farewell, forevermore (as I leave, far from my home)

Free like mist and the snarling sea
like darkling trees and the feral wind
I bid you farewell, forever more...

My lucid green waves,
my lamenting seabirds, call for you
my star-branded body
my withering fog-breath
I long for you.

My infinity beckons, your blood returns to me
by river and rain
you return, we are one.
