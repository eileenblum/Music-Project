Estuary of fallen stars
Madrona swallows dark water.
We wear wreaths of lady fern
drink the changeling moonlight.

We burn our meditations on cedar skin
incense, the scent of camas
of moss like mist, glacier lilies.

The sun knows no answer
and longs for the earth.
The moon knows
her love for the sun.

Inhale the stars, exhale existence
the starsâof breath and cloud are born
the starsârestless elements they become.

Rivers tattooed beneath her skin, lotus in the mist
rain of his eyes and of his skin
fog from his lips.

Cyclic snake bites its tail
Ouroborus, JÃ¶rmungandr
seed to tree
leaf to rot
Ouroborus, JÃ¶rmungandr

The MorrÃ­gu and her ravens feast on prism-skinned salmon
underworld in her eyes, in the frostbitten gaze of the fallen.
