We climbed the mountains as days went by
many weeks we counted, flag hoisted high
and we thought of others who stayed at home
Cascadian brethren were not alone.
Â 
Grab my hand, march the path
across the land, be my epitaph.
Dawnâ
Dawn of refusal, resistance and lore
Dawn of your god,Â  existent no more
Â 
Lonely searchers, we seek our foe
left by time, fate already sewn
no wish for glory, but death not alone
the flag-swathed are returning home.
Â 
Grab my hand, march the path
across the land, be my epitaph.
Dawnâ
Dawn of refusal, resistance and lore.
Dawn of your god,Â  existent no more.
Â 
Take our favors of hazel and pine
this land is our blood, you will never die
not aloneâ
immortal in earth.
Raise your banner bloodstained with hope
sun and rain sacrifice, death feeding life
your giftâ
immortal freedom.
Â 
Grab my hand, march the path
across the land, be my epitaph.
Dawnâ
Dawn of refusal, resistance and lore.
Dawn of your god, existent no more.
