Every time they follow the shadows, I will always guide through
stay on your toes while walking through the meadows
the creatures there will haunt you, too.
We belong to the call of the mountain, Hoh Forest calls us back to her
to be a witness to celestial fountains, spirits in it bring you and I together.

I see your reflection on the ripples of the trees
it brings me down to my faint bloody knees.
Though mighty gods have an anger for you
I still gain strength through the power of the moon.

Every time they follow the shadows, I will always guide through.
Stay on your toes while walking through the meadows
the creatures there will haunt you, too.

I take a breath to replenish my will
to think of you is to see the world still.
Just keep on running while they chase after me
we'll run together to continue the journey.

Every time they follow the shadows, I will always guide through.
Stay on your toes while walking through the meadows
the creatures there will haunt you, too.
We belong to the call of the mountain, Hoh Forest calls us back to her
to be a witness to celestial fountains, spirits in it bring you and I together.

Save yourself, forget the paths we crossed
I'm a wanderer, these memories won't be lost.
Hunched on this stone, next to distant red sand dunes
to die along is far better than to die here with you.

Forget about me and the rest of the signs
I'm a wanderer, stuck in multiple lifetimes.
It's all right that you never knew my name
I swear to you, I will not die in vain.
