for we are all Pagan, children of cinder/eaters of seed, walkers of wheels.

Now stir earth with eve-light, rebirth spun by song
step soft into the cave, with the gifts we once gave
for we are all Pagan, reavers of winter/reapers of rite, sowers of spring.

Hear us! Hear us! Hear us! Hear us! Hretha!

Blood burns like balefire, a torch tapped from palms.
For a year spring lived in our veins, till end meets beginning again.

Elkling calf with green eyes, she holds its sapling stare
she nurses it on snow-nectar, our palm-blood from her breast.

Bone to bloom, fast to feast/bone to bloom, fast to feast
