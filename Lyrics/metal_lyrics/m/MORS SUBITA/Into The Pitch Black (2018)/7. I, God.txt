You seek guidance from the false gods of men.
The lies, the false preachers.
Broaden your mind, embrace my way of life.
Bow to none, kneel for nothing.

You are nothing.
We are everything.
I, God.
Kneel for none.
You are nothing.
We are everything.
I, God.
Kneel for none.

Bring down the false icons of humanity.
We are one, we are god.

Do not give in.
We will not condescend.
Do not give in.
We will not condescend.

I, God

You are nothing.
We are everything.
I, God.
Kneel for none.
You are nothing.
We are everything.
I, God.
Kneel for none.

I, God
Kneel for none

I, God
Bow to none, kneel for nothing

Do not give in.
