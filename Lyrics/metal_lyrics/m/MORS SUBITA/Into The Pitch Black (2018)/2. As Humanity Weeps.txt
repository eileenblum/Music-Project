How much more blood is there to shed before you
realize,
That no one has the right to take another's life.
Feed them pain, feed them fear.
Reduce yourself to human filth.

Why do you paint our streets,
With the blood of our children,
And our kin?

We will not forget.
We will not forgive.
The pain lives on as humanity weeps.

Why do you paint our streets,
With the blood of our children,
And our kin?

We will not forget.
We will not forgive.
The pain lives on as humanity weeps.
Keeping us locked up in our homes.
Taking away our freedom.
Plunging our nations to hell.

You are human filth

Why do you paint our streets,
With the blood of our children,
And our kin?

We will not forget.
We will not forgive.
The pain lives on as humanity weeps.
Keeping us locked up in our homes.
Taking away our freedom.
Plunging our nations to hell.
