Take a deep breath, raise your head.
Take a good look inside of yourself.
What is it that you see?
Something worth striving for,
Or just another crash and fall?
Are you worthy of it all?
What is the reason we fight for?
What is it that keeps us alive?
Have you found yours? Because I have found mine.
Take a stand, this is our time.
Feelings of doubt and shame.
Don't let them shade your way.
Deny it, push them away.
The shadows on your path.
They're all in your head.
Don't fall, just march ahead.
We will not fall.
We will prevail.
We will strive.
This is our time.
What is the reason we fight for?
What is it that keeps us alive?
Have you found yours? Because I have found mine.
Take a stand, this is our time.
