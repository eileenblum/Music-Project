I see the setting sun
And my world becoming undone
The freezing cold surrounds
As I plunge to the pitch black

The dark descends
Vital signs fade away
Finally I can break free
Twisted acts cover
My whole existence
I Ìll take it all down with me

I see the setting sun
And my world becoming undone
I will erase it all
The freezing cold surrounds
I can feel its sweet embrace
As I plunge into the pitch black

End of my era
And a start for another
Better days are soon to arrive
A blink of a reflection
I now see it clearly
I have to exit to make amends

End of my era
And a start for another
End of my era
Iâll accept my faith

I see the setting sun
And my world becoming undone
I will erase it all
The freezing cold surrounds
I can feel its sweet embrace
As I plunge into the pitch black

I see the setting sun
And my world becoming undone
I will erase it all
The freezing cold surrounds
I can feel its sweet embrace
As I plunge into the pitch black

I see the setting sun
And my world becoming undone
The freezing cold surrounds
As I plunge to the pitch black
Into the pitch black.
