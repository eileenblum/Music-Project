I walk among the mortals
Blood trails left behind
I can see the fear in your eyes

I am your devil
Your Beelzebub
The lord of flies

Your face grey as stone
Another mark of control
Fading away

I am the wisdom
And self awareness
You are the sum of lies

Another glance of fear
And desperation
One man once again
Gone astray

You're not better
You're just bitter
So open your eyes and join the real life for a while
We are evil and we are greed
And so are you and your faith is a dying relic
Grey and fading away. A dying relic.
