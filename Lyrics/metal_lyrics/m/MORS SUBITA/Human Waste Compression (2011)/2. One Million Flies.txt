Donating your life away
Mental decay
Pathetic attempt revealed
Prevail of infection

Defender of false belief
Servant of icons
Your eyes are open but still you can't see
Blind conviction

Wars, torture and pedophilia
In the name of your hysteria
Pretending and acting behind your grace
But I can see the hypocrite stains on your face

You sanctimonious
This garden of worms is wilting. Oh why?

One million flies swallowing shit and lies
They can't be wrong. Taste is good
Flavour of sickness in your gospel of heresy
Fuck you and all your make believe
