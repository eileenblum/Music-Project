You bang your head to the western wall
You cry in front of meaningless stones
Man made structure rising high
Covering your whole small simple mind

Ridiculous applies for the sake of slaves
Delivery status notification. Failure !
Imaginary support system
And recipient nonexistent

Divine league. Mental cancer
Leather strapped encrypted code
Inhale the virus inside
Rationality infected body mass

A mortal fear of destination
(Despair and faith) lighting the trail of deception

Wake up ! Alarm is on
You're diving to the pitfall
Like crush test dummy smashing through the wall
This disease is eating you inside
And your tormented soul keeps you paralyzed
You're misled to fatal belief
To the world hallucinated
