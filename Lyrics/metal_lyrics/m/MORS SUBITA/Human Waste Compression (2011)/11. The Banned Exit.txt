I used to be so full of life
Until I realized
From small things forgotten
To total loss

Now this is my final resting place
Me against the four walls
This is where I'll meet my end
I'll accept my fate

Those who meant so much to me
Now just faces never seen
Loss, pain and shame
Flash of the past brings it all back
Only to fade once more

State paralysis
Nerves starting to die
Behaviour unrecognizable
Will to die undeniable

Don't be afraid. This won't hurt a bit
You'll have your life restored
Merciful act. Death humanized
Soon the pain goes away

Look at me. Untie me. Release me
Set me free. Please understand.
