Redeemer of nothingness
Your goal, pure emptiness
Pathetic waste of human race
Stitched eyes, blinded from hell

Poor mind, isolated in comfort cell
Good and gracious mercy's whore
Your schizophrenic mind
Is feeding your dreams
Forever sleep

You give and more you give the more you take
By giving for poor you're buying relief
You are decorating your golden image
Hypocrite

I bet you doesn't even see
Your dead belief, twisted reality
No more mercy in the veil of charity

Organizations grabbing their part
In the veil of charity
We'll wash your sins and you shall be free
Sickness of profusion
