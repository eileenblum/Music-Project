Your life filled with nothing
It's just a pathetic act
Your mind is rotting
What in earth made it crack?

Every day just the same
There's nothing new to offer
On the way to decay
While you try to hold your cover

Hanging on the verge of bursting
Trying to keep your self together
Frustrated and overloaded
Withering away with your self made burden

Where's the burn?
Where's the flame that you once had?

Now you're stuck in your life
Waiting for a saviour that never comes
Wasted time
