Born as a human
Raised from flesh
Craving for sin
Willing for dustâout of sight

The entrance of sickness
Holding us back
Words of madness
Telling us to pretend

Losing pure life for morality
Steelyard of benefit
Breaking down
Under the pressure of humanity

Hidden bestiality

Is this your so called better life
When you're sneaking in the shadows of shame?
Insanity speaking of victory
'Til you burst enormous way.

Now it is time
To reclaim the price
This is what you get
When you deny life
