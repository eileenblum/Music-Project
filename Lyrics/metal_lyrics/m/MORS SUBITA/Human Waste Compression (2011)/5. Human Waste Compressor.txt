Addicted to social porn
Peeping toms dreaming of life
Afraid to go outside

Reality stars
Filling the space
In media central
Civilization

Surrounded by utopia
Mutual self delusion
Disease in your living rooms
Pushing in through the screens

Medicated reality junky
Drugged by compressed illusion
Human waste !

Gray bunker and stink of mould
Do it yourself, mad house
Swelling in the deepest shame
Hibernation state of brains
Intoxicated mind of slaves
Misinformation overload

Have fun with your bedsores
Joy of your rotten flesh
Phlegmatic soul

Isolated in desolation
You lost yourself
You missed life
Heading towards extinction
