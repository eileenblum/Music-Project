Cross devoted fanatic sacred men
Surrounding by your code, sharing morality
You'll just have to let it show
So damn proud to kneel down

Cross devoted with middle class hell
So carefully blocking the way for others
Break some rules and start to live
Come out from the lake of illusions

Superiority complex syndrome
Where the hell it came from?
Where the hell man you went wrong?

You preacher, false teacher
The hell you see, it ain't hell for me
You're afraid of life. Afraid to decide
Admit your true demands

I despise you and I will rise above you
You can keep your hallucinations
You can keep your exalting mode
