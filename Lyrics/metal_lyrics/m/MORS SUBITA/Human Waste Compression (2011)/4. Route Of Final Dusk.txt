I'm combining my hair with a razor blade
Length wise wounds all over my head
As the blood bursts out leaving me a nice make up
I close my eyes and wait to reborn

The broken mirror, reflector of insanity
They are after me

I'm crushing my teeth barehandedly
Instant pain and yet I'm so still
I swallow all those pieces of bones
Something should happen

What's taking so long?
Come to me. Tie me up well
'Cause soon I will rise
A new god. The upgrade

Running away the route of final dusk
Ne need for a map
Just close my eyes and wait to reborn
These restraints are holding me down
