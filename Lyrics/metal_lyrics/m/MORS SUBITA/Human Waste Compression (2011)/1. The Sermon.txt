I've come too far to let it go
Stepped aside from the path you roam
What the fuck are you waiting for ?
Throwing away all the grip you've been given

No. There's no easy way
Piss on your life, ripped apart sanity
Mindless as fuck - your life fades away
God damned dog's lamb

Leave your sermon to the ones that care
I know about your pointless mess
It has always been too late for you
I fucking bathe on your washed away sins

Trying to talk reason with the deaf
Only a bind man can follow your steps
Wither away and leave us be
As you see that you are the blind and we are the free

Nobody will ever be saved
You are a junky filled with narcotic faith
God damned god's lamb
You are the enemy
The only enemy
