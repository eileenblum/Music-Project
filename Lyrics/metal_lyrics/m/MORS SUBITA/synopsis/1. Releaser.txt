Releaser on his way to release 
them from their pain. 
Just smiling on his way.
On his way to make the day. 

A summer night, he made his mind. 
Those poor ones with their lies. 
Conclution - they must die. 
(He will sentence.) 
Killing for pleasure - killing with style.

Releaser on the road again. 
On the road to spread red rain. 
Just one thing in his mind.
In his mind it's mayhem time. 

A summer night... 

All he want's to see, 
is how they bleed, 
on their way to, 
realise / truth 

Releaser still goes on. 
Goes on 'till the work is done. 
No mercy for no one.
No mercy for blind ones. 

A summer night... 

All he wants to see... 

Hahahahaaaaaa... 
You won't get far. 
And one by one, 
I will hunt you down. 

A summer night... 

All he wants to see...
