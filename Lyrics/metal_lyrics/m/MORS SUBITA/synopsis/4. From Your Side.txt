Death, 
you said, 
is coming 
and you'll be gone 
before the first leaf has born. 

Desperation, 
in your voice, 
is like torture for me 
that I can't believe. 

Go away and never come back. 
So you said, but did you mean that? 
You want to set me free. 
No more those words for me.
I won't agree. 

Yes I could, 
maybe I should
and I would leave you, 
unless you wouldn't be my desire. 

Call me twisted, or call me insane
and you think you're right, ...right? 
But that's just 'cause you're looking
that from your side. 

Don't 
you drop 
yourself in misery, 
that you have revealed. 

Transformation 
from flesh to dust. 
So near yet so far.
(That's) proportional.
