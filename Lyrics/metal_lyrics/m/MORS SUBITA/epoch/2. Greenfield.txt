Greenfield
Filled with rage
Voices demanding to act
Young hate is existing
and now is time to shred blood
So many eyes blaming
but don't mind child of hate
Throw the tool of death
and watch deep when the life fades
Kill the life and see the end
You're a god young murderer
Ain't it great to be decider
Greenfield shaped the mind
and now there's no turning back to those times
When you are a god you realize
you are evil inside
