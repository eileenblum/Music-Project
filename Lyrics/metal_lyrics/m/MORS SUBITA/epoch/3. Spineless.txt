Can't understand!
You step inside
to the building of lies.
And you're bowing down
for that man before you.
You swallow all his tales
without question.
You spineless scum.
You make me sick.
I just can't understand.
Hey, addict.
What can you see
in that kind of slavery.
I just can't understand you fools.
Glory and life
if you choose his side.
Damnation and mourning
if you spit on his story.
You've been fooled by the king of the poors.
You're just one of his whores.
Don't you see he's a real vampire.
Just smiling while sucking your power.
