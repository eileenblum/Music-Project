Among the others but still alone.
I am that freak they're staring for long.
But be careful if I raise my head.
Then your eyes are elsewhere.
Field of vision limited by mind.
In the physical world ignore those vacuum-minds.
Keep your mind on that what matters
and shut out all useless.
It's my own life in my mind.
I shut my eyes and you disappear.
I decide when I'm alone.
I am the master of this time.
My time.
Prime time.
