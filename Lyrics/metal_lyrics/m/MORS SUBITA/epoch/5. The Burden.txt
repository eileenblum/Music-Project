Your life filled with nothing
it's just pathetic act.
Your mind is rotting.
What in earth made it crack?
Every day just the same.
There's nothing new to offer.
On the way to decay
while you try to hold your cover.
Hanging on the verge of bursting
trying to keep yourself together.
Frustrated and overloaded.
Withering away with your selfmade burden.
Where's the burn?
Where's the flame
that you once had?
Now you're stuck in your life
waiting for
savior that never comes.
Wasted time!
