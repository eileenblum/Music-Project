I'm dead inside
Slowly I'm starting to ferment
I have no life
All that I can see
is the wall laughing at me
I can not feel
Same vision from time to time
is burning in my eyes
Same vision from time to time
filled with nothingness of life
I lost my power
I am a pathetic man
I spit on my self
This is the curse of nothingess
I don't want to exist
I wish I could sleep away
but when I close my eyes
that scene is haunting for me
Release me and open the gates
Let me free from myself
Release me
At the gates I'll say goodbye for myself
