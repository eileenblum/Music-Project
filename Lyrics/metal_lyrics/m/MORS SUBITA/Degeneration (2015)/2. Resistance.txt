Welcome to the last safehaven of man
A point where we shall stand
Until the end of our time

We thought we had it all
Freedom and priviledge to be who we are
It all happened so fast
And now we are the ones who stand up last

Slaves to the system and our false beliefs
Holding it back, our true will unreleased
This ain't the moment to hesitate
Resistance is what we need
Resistance is what we shall feed

Now raise your fist up high
Time to fight to keep our race alive
What the fuck are you waiting for
Strike the first blow and let your anger flow

Detatch yourself from it all
(leave this pathetic world behind you)
It's your own fucking call
