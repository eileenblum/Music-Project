A new-born society
A kingdom of corruption and slavery
Man-created throne of agony
The world you know
It's gone for good

Now face the silence
Feel the cold
Welcome to our new world
This is it
There's no turning back from here
Friend of a foe
Dead or alive
Praise the new world order

The voices of the people
Suppressed by supremacy
Sounds of a playground fading
Now humanity ceases to exist

Can you feel it?
This is the end complete
See the world rise to ruin
This is the end complete
The end complete

Now face the silence
Feel the cold
Welcome to our new world
This is it
There's no turning back from here
Friend of a foe
Dead or alive
Praise the new world order

Can you feel it?
This is the end complete
See the world rise to ruin
This is the end complete
The end complete

[2x]
Now face the silence
Feel the cold
Welcome to our new world
This is it
There's no turning back from here
Friend of a foe
Dead or alive
Praise the new world order

The new world order [3x]
