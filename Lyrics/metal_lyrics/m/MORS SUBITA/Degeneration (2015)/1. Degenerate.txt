Unfold the twisted figurehead of reality
the lies hidden behind our true personality
from point to point, from post to one another post
The frustration towards our malevolent nature grows

Age of uncompassion and misshapen values
A sickening degree of scum and impurity
Reject the true consequences of hatred
The point of degeneration has been reached

(Our kind will degenerate)
Back to the carnivore race that we are meant to be
(aggression that can't be detained)
A step towards the path man was meant to take

The conceit of an united nation slowly fades to a daydream
Replaced by dreadful flashes of anger in our bloodstream
can you already feel the bloodlust kicking in
the day of reckoning is here, prepare to answer for your sins

Step down and give up the fight
Let it go and let our true instincts flow

A fucking ignorant disgrace of life
A lifeform that isn't worthy enough for this world
How the hell did we make it this far
This god-forsaken race will never be forgiven
