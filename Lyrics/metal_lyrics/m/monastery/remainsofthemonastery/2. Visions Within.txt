[By Jeroen &amp; Jacob-Hans]

From day till day
From hour till hour
another personality
A lost identity
I... I am lost
I am waiting for the eternal search
I... I am afraid of myself
I have no life I want to die
Terrible pains inside
Constantly voices from nowhere
Good and evil are the same
Suddenly rising from where they came
Visions....
Visions of my religion
Visions of the anti-christ
who shall be... there next time
I want my old life back
I want my second soul to go
Don't wan't to be a slave
of the dark one
Rotten brains, flashes of death
before my eyes
There is no place for me
my last hope.. is to die!
An.. An empty soul in light
An empty soul in darkness
Terrible pains inside
Constantly voices from nowhere
Good and evil are the same
Suddenly rising from where they came
Alone and confused
Please tell me who am I
Suicidal tendencies are teasing
nobody will understand
Two different thoughts
The opposite of eachother
Visions of my religion
Visions of the anti-christ
who shall be... there next time
The pains inside me
I don't want this eternal fight
I want to life my own life
