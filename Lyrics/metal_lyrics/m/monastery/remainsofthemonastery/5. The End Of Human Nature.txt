[By Jacob-Hans]

Religions conquer our world
Holy influences dominating our will.
I know what's wrong,
The religion feel became too strong.
God is the scapegoat of things we can't explain.
Religion victims don't believe in a wrong way.
Holy forces become evil,
They all want more.
They think that they rule supreme.
All that were is lost.
Born in peace
Died in war
Lies are filling our life
Only hate is the truth that survives
Religions will be the end of human nature.
Religion victims are you blind.
Don't fight for god, don't give your life
We must stop religions
Those who are making our end.
