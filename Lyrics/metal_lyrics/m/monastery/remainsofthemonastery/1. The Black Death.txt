[By Jeroen]

In the year 1426
a godless world without any war
no churches who could spread lies
so humanity would never fail
Somewhere in a dark cold night
humanity became infected
by a decease called God
from this time the world was doomed to fall
The Black Death
Field of blood before you
Blame this mess on God
The dictator of today.
Churches were build, monuments of Christ
50 years of slavery and torturing began
War became a part of life
and all this because of Him
The Black Death
Field of blood before you
Blame this mess on God
The dictator of today.
Churches, Monuments of Christ
War, a terrible fight
Torturing, execution in the night
Slavery, a bloody sight
Nowadays religion is trying to rule supreme
forever there will be lies
until humanity fights for freedom
will it ever end?
