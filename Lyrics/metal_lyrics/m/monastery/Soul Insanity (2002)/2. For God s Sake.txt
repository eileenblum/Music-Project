[By Jacob-Hans]

You fucking lying whores
All the things you said you didn't do
Can't you just tell the truth
All this mess because of you
The bringer of torture
The bringer of what's right and wrong
Wrong is your fright
Right is your argue to fight
I want war
I want to destroy this lying whore
I want to kill them whole
I want to end this all
Bloodbaths in my eyes
Caused by your lies
The only thing we should do
Is to make an end of you
Respect? For the holy war
Respect for the one who can stop this whore
I want war
I want to destroy this lying whore
I want to kill them whole
I want to end this all
Awake you're driven by the book of lies
Sanctimonious as you think you are holy
Lies followed by the weakest minds
No God will support you FOR GOD'S SAKE!!!!
