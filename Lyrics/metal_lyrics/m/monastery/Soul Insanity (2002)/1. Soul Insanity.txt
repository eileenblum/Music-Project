[By Jacob-Hans]

He psychiatrist what can I do
I think my life needs something new
I want to be the one I should be
This is the story of soul insanity
A raging soul inside
Destroying everything I want
What made me change
This isn't me. I'm going insane
We're seeking to happiness in our lives
That's what we're living for
The soul should keep me strong
But rage and insanity make my soul forget
Forget
I'm lost in my own self-esteem
Nothing will succeed only in my dreams
Waiting for what comes next
In this world I'm trapped
Living in chaos everyday
No luck how could I care
I'm used to it, so don't tell me
I have nothing more to say
A raging soul inside
Destroying everything I want
What made me change
This isn't me. I'm going insane
Damn this world
Only pain and hate
There's nothing more
I'm only hate and war
I roam in my own thoughts
This isn't what I'd planned
I Cannot stand the truth
My Life becomes untrue
I think you'd better kill yourself
