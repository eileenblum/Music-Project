[By Jacob-Hans]

Walking in the woods
There I feel the darkness Like how I feel
In the rain of steel
I felt so empty as I've never felt
Where was the end that I have never seen?
As if I just awaked in the middle of a dream
The story without an end
Captured my soul into another land
This is how I live my life
And I know my ways
Don't touch my soul
You have caused enough pain
Hear the leafs falling from the trees
Now the boughs are empty as my hart
Hear the whispering noises
As if they have something to say
Just let the soul going his way
Just let the soul going his way
Violation by mind imagination
Yet the feelings become hate
And I'll make an end of the silent that prevails
Through my ambition of violence
Who were in the laid of dark emotions
Where was the end that I have never seen?
As if I just awaked in the middle of a dream
The story without an end
Captured my soul into another land
Emotions like moments of malice and pain
It's torturing my mind that's going insane
Till I can accept the fact that happened
So I can finish my story, which will be over when I am death
