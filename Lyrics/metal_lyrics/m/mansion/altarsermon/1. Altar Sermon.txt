[Alma:]
Behind closed doors
In the night
Just me and you, my child
In God's sight

Disrobe yourself
Lay down on me
He moves my forlorn hand
On your tingling skin

[Matteus:]
You shall tell me
What I need to know
You shall hold me
Firmly in your grip

Prepared to earn
What I receive
You shall whisper
Blessing and the truth

As I clench my fist
Around the stones
Don't say a word
Let him set you free

[Alma:]
Behind closed doors
In the night
Just me and you, my child
In God's sight

Disrobe yourself
Lay down on me
He moves my forlorn hand
On your tingling skin

[Matteus:]
You shall tell me
What I need to know
You shall hold me
Firmly in your grip

Prepared to earn
What I receive
You shall whisper
Blessing and the truth

As I clench my fist
Around the stones
Don't say a word
Let him set you free

[Alma:]
You will never enjoy this

[Matteus:]
Nor will I love my life

[Alma:]
Only I may touch you

[Matteus:]
For you are clean and true

[Alma:]
You will never enjoy this
Nor will you love your life
Only I may touch you
For I am clean and true

[Matteus:]
I will never enjoy this
Nor will I love my life
Only you may touch me
For you are clean and true

[Alma:]
Let him set you free
