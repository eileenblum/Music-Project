Our blessed masses
Travel over ashes
Of the incinerated
Sinners we once hated

Evergrowing triumph
Hell calls the defiant
Our day is here
Afterlife so dear

Come, settle down
Among the righteous
In a house made of stone
Of the lord of creation

At last the waiting's over
Rapture is ever closer
The end of tribulation
Heathens face damnation

Death comes heaven sent
Prelude to punishment
They have started screaming
Joined by their inner demons

Come, settle down
Among the righteous
In a house made of stone
Of the lord of creation

Sinners melt like candles
Even priests in sandals
Thieves, whores and blasphemers
All but the true believer

Tears of pride and joy
Floating into the void
Forever in his glory
We live, end of story

Come, settle down
Among the righteous
In a house made of stone
Of the lord of creation

Closing the final chapter
Alive in the ever after

Come inside the mansion
To witness uncreation
Be among the righteous
Bathing in the brightness

We have been rewarded
Unlike the foul and sordid
Earth turns inside out
Saved are the devout
