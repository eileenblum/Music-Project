We are welcoming the end of this world
We lift our heads to the light from above
Slave to the devil, this is your time to fall
Into the flaming lakes of hell down below

God will lay his hate as blood dyes the shores
Millions of sinners dying slowly on their knees
Greed, lust and envy and no dignity
Waste of human flesh, good riddance, we say

A new dawn upon us
Extinction, our redemption
This is what we're longing for

We trample heathen bodies as we move on
Ascending to the only living god
We shall witness your demise by his side
This reward will be enjoyed and recalled

Receive your judgement at the end of this world
The end of you for all eternity
Tomorrow's here and angels will sing
We'll take the high road and leave you here

A new dawn upon us
Extinction, our redemption
This is what we're longing for
