You're not allowed to cross me
Believe in this and you'll be free
See the stone that I hold here
Pray without shedding tears

I know you mock creation
I'm an abomination
And I can smell temptation
Oh, sweet fornication
Don't ever dream I'd hesitate
I want to congregate
Someone has to set you straight
Come set me straight

You know you look
Guilty as sin

You're unclean and you're filthy
How dare you approach me
Wild child, you're gonna burn
From hell there's no return

Get on your knees, I say
I won't, I don't want to
I see through your sorry game
You won't, you don't want to
Here comes your punishment
Give give, 'til I repent
C'mon you deserve it
Yes, I do, I deserve it

You know you look
Guilty as sin

And I can see you
Guilty as sin
