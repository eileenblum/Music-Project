You got it wrong
You got it all wrong
You twist the word
Made the devil's bible
Fool! You got it wrong

Hear the truth
Hear the old truth
Withing the old
Translation
You'll find the truth

It's gonna burn
It's all gonna burn
You're summoning
The prince of darkness
Fool! You're gonna burn

The false bible
Your false idol
You're deceived
By the sinner's church
Fool! You'll never learn

You have to get rid of the lies
Through fire
You have to get rid of the lies
Through fire
One way to hell for you
And that's fire

Ignite the page
Before it's too late
You need to tear
Those lies apart
Fool! Before it's too late

Ignite the page
Before it's too late
You need to tear
Those lies apart
Fool! Before it's too late

You have to get rid of the lies
Through fire
You have to get rid of the lies
Through fire
One way to hell for you
And that's fire

It makes him furious
To know
That his will was altered

His true word is glorious
And we will always guard it

Distorted blasphemy
You serve and won't be saved

You won't be saved
