I hold my breath
In contempt
And I repent
And regret

In his reign
In my shame
I own the pain
Never in vain

My every day
Is my
Last day
Went away

I grieve
And I believe
You will deceive
Like Adam and Eve

Pride, lust and greed
Your needs
Sin dwells within
Your itching skin

You are untrue
I always knew
And you confuse
Your children too

I don't pity
The fool, the tool
Who will drown
In his own stool

Oh how I pray
I pray
Today just
Went away

I grieve
And I believe
You will deceive
Like Adam and Eve

All the things you have done
Everyone you have wronged

Every lie you have told
Every time you loved gold

Even the time you felt proud
Felt too good to be allowed

I could never live like you
Could never do the things you do

You're a sinner
Go die bitter

All the things
You have done
Everyone
You have wronged

You're a sinner
No one delivers

Every lie
You have told
Every time
You loved gold

You're a sinner
Drowning in liquor

Even the time
You felt proud
Felt too good
To be allowed

You're a sinner
A broken mirror

I could never
Live like you
Could never
Do the things you do

You never saw the light
Welcome to afterlife

Your fate unbearable
Torment without an end

Leave us you sinful wretch
You're not to be blessed

Burning for evermore
In a fire lake without a shore

Soul eating demons roam
In a hell far from your home

Way past looking fair
Do you smell your burning hair
