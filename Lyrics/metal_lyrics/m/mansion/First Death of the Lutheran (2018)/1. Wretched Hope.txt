Hope
Wretched hope
Gives you a choice
Give you a voice, against the Lord

Ooh hope
A ray of hope
Leads you astray
Takes you away, from the Lord

Hope
Deceitful hope
Gives you a will
Gives you a thrill, oh my Lord

Hear my warning
The Lord is calling
Do you see the signs
It's the end of times

No hope
No more hope
Leaves you with faith
Leaves you to wait, for the Lord

So cope
Without hope
Without a wife
Without a life, on your own

Hear my warning
The Lord is calling
Do you see the signs
It's the end of times

You're fumbling in shadows
Like sorrowless' widows
Now it is too late
No more yesterday

You don't want your life
You wish that you would die
You get what you deserve
Forever you will burn
