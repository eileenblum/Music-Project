The reverend
That devil
Calls you to
Dance

Forever
On fire
Your soul
Screams

Seduction
Of the people
Who get lost
In the shadows

To church on Sunday
Only one day
When you pretend
You believe

A priest's collar
On a sinner
In league
With the devil

The reverend
That devil
Calls you to
Dance

Unholy
Church of Luther
Lucifer
In disguise

A priest's collar
On a sinner
In league
With the devil

Turn away for the church is falling
Cursed stones will tumble down
The wrath of God is homing in on
Lutherans

You will fall into a lake of fire
And know you've been mislead
You can't cry for your eyes will dry out
When you burn
