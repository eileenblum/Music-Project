Behold the vessel of a concubine
Here stiffened body all laid out to see here for your eyes
Not a single man can enter this decaying shrine
For it is a time of death and the end of time
And we are the ones who'll see the light

Keep the wretched priests in the dark
They can never see the fire burning in our heart
Every child of God will bear our scars
A sinner can't be cast out of this fold
She will be below us weeping until hell turns cold
Guess who will be swallowing her soul

And I will carry on waiting for the day
And I will carry on waiting for the day
We shall live

Yet another day overdue
Patiently our children will be there to see us through
We have cast aside all earthly joy to bring forth doom
Not a better day to give your life for what is true
1943 for me and you

And I will carry on waiting for the day
And I will carry on waiting for the day
We shall live

And you will die
Lost in time
Every weakling will expire
Their sins will be the wall we'll climb
Out of darkness into the light
So beat this body like she was alive
