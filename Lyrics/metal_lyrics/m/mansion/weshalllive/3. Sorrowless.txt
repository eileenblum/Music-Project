The sorrowless will always go astray
Even if he thinks highly of his ways
Blind to the foulness of his life
Celebrating sin on his wedding night

Can you hear the call
Do you see the horns
To hell and to the devil
You will go

The sorrowless will always keep its child
Enchanted by its devious smiles
Prayers will never reach the lord
Unless you tear apart your sinful bond

Can you hear the call
Do you see the horns
To hell and to the devil
You will go

The sorrowless will always waste his time
Losing every chance to reconcile
Tears must flow and a frown be worn
God only loves the one who mourns

We won't pity the fool
Living like the devil's tool
We despise the frail
We will see them fail
