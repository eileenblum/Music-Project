Sweet dreams on angel wings
Bliss of peace in his sleep
Reeling deep in seeping rivers
Sweet speech is delivered

Words pierce the dream, words most sacred
To break the seal for those most able
To hear the truth travel through slumber
Lose a tooth, your days are numbered

It reeks of sin all around us
The man who sleeps shall bring us justice
On his lips the word lays dormant
To find the whore and the informant

Give us the names, give us the guilty
So we may cure those that are filthy
Among us creeps vile flirtation
Salvation through humiliation

It is said in revelations
That everywhere is our vocation
Appreciate drowsy blessings
The lord is hate and love depressing

Speak in tongues, speak of judgement
With open hearts we bear our torment
Sweet dreams, dreams of rapture
Slip of his tongue and is captured
