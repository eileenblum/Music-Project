If we seek forgiveness
Her burden will increase
When will she forgive us
When will she release

Our holy mother
Has us to blame
For we are unworthy
And serve her with shame

The only mother
We will ever serve
Oh, how she suffers
When we won't learn

Tame that sinful flame
In this burning chamber

Try to be a mother
Become the whore
Children and the devil
Are welcome no more

Our holy mother
Has us to blame
For we are not ready
To burn in the flame

Tame that sinful flame
In this burning chamber

If we seek forgiveness
Her burden will increase
When will she forgive us
When will she release

Tame that sinful flame
In this burning chamber
