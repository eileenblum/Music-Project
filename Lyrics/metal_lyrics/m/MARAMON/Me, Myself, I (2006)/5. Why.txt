I've seen something you never seen.
A tragic society, with no believe.
There's no hope, no way to be free
With no remorse, you've been deceived.
I see them walking hand in hand
Their mind so narrow, no place to expand.
I keep asking myself, why and why?
What is the reason, we still try?

âWhy are you standing, standing, standing here alone...?
when Iâm leaving you and everything behind!â

In blindness, you are walking the way
The long way, that leads you astray.
The same mistake is made by us all,
in this society, the weak will fall.
So is there a meaning, in what we do
You had the chance, didnât you?
I keep asking myself, why and why?
What is the reason, we still try?

âWhy are you standing, standing, standing here alone...?
when Iâm leaving you and everything behind!â
