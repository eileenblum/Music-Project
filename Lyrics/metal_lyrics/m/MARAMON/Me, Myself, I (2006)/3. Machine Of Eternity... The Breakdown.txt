They always talk about treason
But, I , See, Through.
Their lies don't impress me
There is, no chance, for they, to convert me

Open up your eyes
Try, to, realise
You have been deceived
Try to, get through, the surface, and break free!

âFeel it inside my empty... mind...
Come to realise my time...â

I see there is no reason
For, you, to , cry
This is not you fault
You were, too blind, to see, what was... right

Open up your eyes
Try, to, realise
You have been deceived
Try to, get through, the surface, and break free!

âFeel it inside my empty mind...
Come to realise my time...â
