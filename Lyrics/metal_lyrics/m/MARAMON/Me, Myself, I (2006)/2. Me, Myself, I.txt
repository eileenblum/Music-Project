Madness, I lost control
I know, I don't should
No way to stop my rage
Thoughts trapped like in a cage

Things seen from a different direction
Words so empty causes reaction
Life itself is in perfection
Minds abducted in a strange progression

"I've been silenced with no deception..."

âAnd now Iâm standing here again,
Itâs Me,Myself and I
Alone, Emptiness, But why?
Itâs Me, Myself and I!â

Strangled by false acclaim
God, this voices drives me insane
A vanishing point before my eyes
I've forgot the reason, and I hear the cries
Yes I hear them...

"I've been silenced with no deception..."

âAnd now Iâm standing here again,
Itâs Me,Myself and I
Alone, Emptiness, But why?
Itâs Me, Myself and I!â
