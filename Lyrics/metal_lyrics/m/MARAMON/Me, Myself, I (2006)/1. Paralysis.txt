In a typical sleep-paralysis experience, a person wakes up paralyzed
A visible entity may even sit on their chest
Shaking, strangling, or prodding them through

People with lobes are more prone to have fantasies
Will soon   have to report
Mystical and out of body experiences
Visions, and physical thoughts

Despite my knowing of logical thoughts
Each one was scary at first

I was shrouded in a feel of dread
And often feared I would die before birth.

People with lobes are more prone to have fantasies
Will soon   have to report
Mystical and out of body experiences
Visions, and physical thoughts

âSleep comes, hope it goes away...
Brings us a new Day!â

"You cynic ass, this is not a fucking dream,
this is for fucking real you know,
there's no fucking way out for you,
you cynic ass motherfucker"
