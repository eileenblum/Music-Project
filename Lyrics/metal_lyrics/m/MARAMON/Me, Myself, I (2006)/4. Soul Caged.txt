Please let me out, out from this hell
My soul is bleeding, that's all I can tell
There's no chance, no way to be free
Try to understand, you are choking me.
It's so hard, so hard for me
to tell the truth, but you must see...
There's no chance, no way to be free
Try to understand, you are choking me.

âCrying.... Dyingâ

I'm going through different dimensions
My soul is longing for redemption.
I'M CRYING, SLOWLY DYING!"

"Soul Caged, I'm  the aim for rage, entwined forever
Soul Caged, I'm  your source for hate, I'm trapped forever."

I Look back, back at my time
Was this my fate?, Am I alive?
I'm so weak, so weak I can't move
You must go, and let myself improve.
It's so hard, so hard for me
to tell the truth, but you must see...
There's no chance, no way to be free
Try to understand, you are choking me.

âCrying.... Dyingâ

I'm going through different dimensions
My soul is longing for redemption.
I'M CRYING, SLOWLY DYING!"

"Soul Caged, I'm  the aim for rage, entwined forever
Soul Caged, I'm  your source for hate, I'm trapped forever."
