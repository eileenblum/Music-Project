On her death bed
Staring at the moon
Serenity devoured by the demons in bloom
She said
"I wish I could see heaven father but I have sinned
These are cracks within my bones 
These are bruises on my skin
Am I right am I wrong
Give one reason to go on
I wish I was your perfect ten
I wish I could transcend
Do you just stare?
Would you take my hand?
Do you just stare?
Please take my hand
Don't just stare
You've shown no mercy
You've watched my pain
A gift-wrapped nothing is all you ever gave
A daughter cries
A brother runs
A mother screams in twisted tongues
A father hangs his head in shame
No one left to blame
Soon
She's gone so soon
