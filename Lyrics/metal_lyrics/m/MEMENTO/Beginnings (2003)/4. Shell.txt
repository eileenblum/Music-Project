Crawl away into the shell you put yourself in
Crawl away, I watched you crawl away
Not one set of footprints in this burning sand
It fell away, I watched it fall away
Who am I in your eyes?
How does it feel?
How does it feel your asking
I cant heal, I cant feel you anymore
I'll never kneel
Never kneel before you
How can I heal
When there's blood still on the floor?
In a vacuum screaming
Hope was not in season
Please hear me, someone hear me
If I could you know I'd take your place my friend
"not again", yes I'll carry you again
Who am I in your eyes?
Hold on
