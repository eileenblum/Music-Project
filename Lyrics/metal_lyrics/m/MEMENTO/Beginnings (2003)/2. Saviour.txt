We tried so hard to erase you
We tried so hard to pretend you were dead
I walked the earth just to escape you
Now I walk the earth just to touch you again
Come on down, my saviour, my failure
To save myself I betrayed you
These swollen lips whisper only for revenge
To spite myself I betrayed you
If I stop the lies, will I see you in the end?
Swimming through the red
Nothing up ahead
I cannot buy a friend
I just came here to tell you
I miss you
Come on down, my saviour, my failure
My saviour, I failed you
