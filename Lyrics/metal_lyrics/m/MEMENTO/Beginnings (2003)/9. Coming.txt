He's coming, he's coming, he's coming
Counting on some one on one with you
Connecting all the dots, guess who
Invisible but with you in the room
Just know that he's coming for you
There is no me and you
You are still dead to me
Coming out of hibernation
The shivers and the tingles in your spine
The dirty pins and needles in your eyes
Look into the keyhole of your mind
Just know that I'm coming for you
I forgot to forgive
I'm forgetting to live
I forgot to forgive you
