Beginning at the end of the beginning of the end
Twisting and turning between one and ten
The puzzle never ends make your demons your friends
It's the beginning of a road that leads right back to the
Beginning of the end.....
Living in my machine
Pulses beneath gray skin
Torso deep in unanswered whys
Let your habit anesthetise
Letting the insects in
Beggars that breed within
Swing from your chain, enjoy your ride
Just a blind man swimming against the tide
Two circles, one cycle, a figure of 8
Where loves becomes hate
Beginning at the end of the beginning of the endtwisting and turning inside you
Denial becomes you
Make your demons your friends
Flying with your noxious wings
Crying through your toxic lens
Denial betrayed you
Make your demons your friends
Inner anomaly
Where self slaughter is peace
Mutating into a silver whale
Beaching yourself to spite the grail
Turning from fish to frog
Come sleep with my dead God
Calluses bloom on the hand of grace
The snake is sleeping, dreaming of Eve's face
Two circles, one cycle, a figure of 8
Where the trap is the escape
Cognition is prison, cognition is prison
Birth, life, death, rust
Feed this cruel lust
Cognition is prison, cognition is prison
Goodbye, I hope to see you in another life
Goodnight, I know I'll see you from a clearer sky
No pain, no blame
Just a naked and a loving eye
Goodbye
Love goes on
I hope you all enjoyed your ride
Love goes on
I hope we find ourselves in time
I don't need your mantra
I don't need your crosses
I don't need to hold on
I don't need to let go
If my eyes are black
You'll just have to find me
Careful where you look
You'll end up where I am
The end of the beginning, the beginning of the end
Twisting and turning between one and ten
The puzzle never ends, make your demons your friends
It's the end of a road that leads right back to
The beginning....
