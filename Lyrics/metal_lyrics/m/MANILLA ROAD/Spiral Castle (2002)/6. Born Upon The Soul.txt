Through the desert I have searched
For the place of magik's birth
Guided by the muses song
O'er the sands of Babylon

Through the jungle I have searched
For the place of magik's birth
I am called by what is lost
To the mists of Angkor Wat

Through the mountains I have searched
For the place of magik's birth
It is not a shrine of old
Magik's born upon your soul
