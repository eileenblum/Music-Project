Upon the slab
Mortis of flesh
Drink to the past
Wake for the dead

Too late the heroes
The voices' sorrow
Comes from the shadow

Have I gone mad
Lost in this dream
The shadow casts
A thousand screams

Too late for heroes
The voices's shadow
Guards well the portal

Too late the heroes
The voices' sorrow
Comes from the shadow
