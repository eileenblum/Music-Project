Crusaders in white, red crosses they wear
Defilers of light, in god's name they dare
Acolytes of God or Baphomet
By the churches' law merchants of death

Nightmare-like out of their brain
Visions that drive them insane
Holy war inside their head
Holy men who walk with the dead

We don't want your holy war
Don't need this bloodshed anymore
The funeral pyres burn evermore
We don't want your holy war

Fire and ice falls from the sky
Raining death on all human life
Words of fear to breed in the heart
Fractured lies to tear us apart

We don't want your holy war
Don't neeed this bloodshed anymore
The funeral pyres burn evermore
We don't want your holy war

Everyone wants a paradise
Nobody wants to pay the price
Peace only comes from sacrifice
Still the winds of war blow on

So many say that they believe
Yet they don't prctise what they preach
Power hunger spawned out of greed
Still the fires of hell burn on

Blasphemy done in god's own name
Holy men never take the blame
Seems like the world has gone insane
still the fires of hell burn on

Sands of time are running out for us all
Free your mind before we fall
Senselessly the war machine marches on
Bathory before the dawn

We don't want your holy war
Don't need this bloodshed anymore
The funeral pyres burn evermore
We don't want your holy war
