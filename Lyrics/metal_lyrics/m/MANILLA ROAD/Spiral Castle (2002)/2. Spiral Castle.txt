The Godess is calling unto my mind
As I traverse o'er the sands of time
I Taliesin have seen the signs
Within the muses' ancient rhyme

Here on the fall of Luxifera
Unto the depths of hell
I bore the banner well
I'm the magician, some call me Merddin
At length every king
Shall say my holy name is blasphemy

Shub Ngirith is calling out of the void
The serpent has us in it's coils
Into the courts of chaos and toil
To the victor go the spoils

Hre on the fall of Luxifera
Unto the depths of hell
I bore the banner well
I'm the magician, some call me Merddin
At length every king
Shall say my holy name is blasphemy

White Goddess
Watches over us
As gaze upon
Tetragramaton

Learn the mystic truth
Secret of the brew
Hear the call to war
The Gajallar horn

The elder gods of mystic rhyme
Have marched across Bifrost
The rainbow bridge trough space and time
Is shattered ever lost

Ragnarok
Gathering the flock
Sons of Valhalla
Bardic warriors all
Yog Sothoth has come
And the ancient ones
Nine worlds meld in war
Birth of evermore

The elder gods of mystic truth
Have marched across Bifrost
The rainbow bridge trough space and time
is shattered ever lost
