Hammer of Hell
Not of The Well
A book of sin
Fathered by men
Unholy deeds
Done out of greed
Murder by law
In the Name of God

Burn them all
Burn them all
Burn them all

The blood runs cold
We've paid the toll
They burned the truth
Out of our youth
Bringers of pain
In the Father's name
Not of The Well
We'll send them back to Hell

And burn them all
Burn them all
Burn them all
