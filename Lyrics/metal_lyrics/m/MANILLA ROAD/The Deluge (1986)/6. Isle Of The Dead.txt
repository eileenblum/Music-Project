Across the seas of nevermore
There lies the ancient bloody shore
Where living dead still walk the land
Demon warriors of the damned

The fires burn blood red
Upon the Isle of the Dead

The mariners still tell the tale
Of the island gate to Hell
Where sinners of the seven seas
Live out the curse of blasphemy

The fires burn blood red
Upon the Isle of the Dead

Black gate to Nifleheim
The Bells of Hell still chime
Judgement beyond the grave
Condemns their souls to burn in flames

The fires burn blood red
Upon the Isle of the Dead
