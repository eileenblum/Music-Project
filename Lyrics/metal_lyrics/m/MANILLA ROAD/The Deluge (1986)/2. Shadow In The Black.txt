Place that is not a place
Vortex of fire The Gateway
To all the outer planes
Where life's own Magic mountains
Circle beyond all time
Feeding The Tree with white light
Demons in dark disguise
Shall never break The Lifeline

Before The Throne
Demon of wrath
Not flesh nor bone
A shadow in the black

Cryptic The Spiral Way
Even so in this space-age
Leaving rectors dismayed
Seeking out wisdom's daybreak
Hidden by dark of night
Not even seen by hindsight
Spectre who plagues the mind
Of Bards inside the limelight

Before The Throne
Demon of wrath
Not flesh nor bone
A shadow in the black

Nightmare like is the unknown
Demon seed guarding The Throne
Test of faith probing The Soul
Eight fold way of paying the toll

[CHORUS]

Frost, from beyond the grave
Fire, to burn us the way
Rock, the strength of The Soul
Fight, this shadow of old
Here inside The Maze
Trinity of Flame
As the lightning cracks
We banish the shadow in the black

Holy war and righteous crusades
Like burning Witches at the stake
Narrow minds will never believe
Until The Dead rise from The Sea

[CHORUS]
