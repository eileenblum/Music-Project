Hail to the Queen
Of Victory
Her holy war was England's shame
She was no fiend
Of heresy
Put to the death by evil's flame

[CHORUS]

Another victim
Of Christianity
Ecclesiastic fire from Hell
Divine the victim
No sanctuary
Her sacred soul she would not sell

Faithful her ways
Through all her days
Enlightened child of Tree and Stone
Born of the slaved
All France she saved
Conquering Angels of Orleans

[CHORUS]
