Before the walls come curmbling
Down around our feet;
Before the empires fall
And Hell enslaves the free;
Before our time runs out
The spells must soon be cast;
We'll raise the banners high
And storm the gates at last.

Tonight we fight.
The Norns decide our fate.
Fight well in Hell !
Open the Gates !

This night the Gates of Hell
Come crashing to the ground.
The sword Excalibur
Was lost but now is found.
Arthurs does rise again,
The Dragons Lord of old.
Just like the Bards have said
In all the tales they told.

Tonight we fight.
The Norns decide our fate.
Fight well in Hell !
Open the Gates !
