For all the tortured
And all the slaves
Arthur did rise
On the Ninth Wave

To rule the Britains
And lead the brave
Out of the darkness
Of their day.

Dragonships
Rise from the sea
Three Queens bring
The new born King.

From Merlin's Magik
The stones were placed.
He raised the mist
Opened the gates.

From crystal waters
The Lady's Lake
Did rise the sword
Of Midgar's fate.

Dragonships
Rise from the sea
Three Queens bring
The new born King.

There once was a time
When devine light shown
And the Lady of the Lake
Raised the sword of the Throne.

And the wind shall howl
Totentanz
Einhereir of Valhalla
Rise

Dragonships
Rise from the sea
Three Queens bring
The new born King.

Valhallan warriors
Ride be his side
The Dragon mist
Crawls through the night.

Avalon's iron gates
No longer cry
Einherierer
Storm to the fight.

Dragonships
Rise from the sea
Three Queens bring
The new born King
