Cries will fill the dead of nigth
Screaming for the morning light.
Insane maneuvers of the mind.
Shall sow the wrath of all mankind.

In crystal towers off the shore
I've seen the ligth of evermore
But politics has barred the door
And left us no way out but war.

It could happen today
Unless we learn to change our ways
Warlords lead us to death,
They're Weavers of the Web.

My soul calls out to all of life
To stop this hell and end the strife
Stand us for your humane rigth
Reject the web with all your might.

Inside the charms of anciente lore
There's magik truth and much, much more,
But new beliefs have slammed the door,
Shut out the light of Everymore.

It could happen today
Unless we learn to change our ways.
Warlords lead us to death,
They're Weavers of the Web.
