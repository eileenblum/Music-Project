Heavy metal in my ears
Is all I ever want to hear.
Before the sands of time run out
We'll stand our ground and all scream out !
Scream out !

Heavy Metal
To the worl tonight,
Heavy Metal
To the...

Heavy Metal's here to stay,
We'll never see it's dying day.
Let slaugthers truth be in the past.
Let's give our youth a lasting chance,
Scream out !

Heavy Metal
To the world tonight,
Heavy Metal
To the...

Heavy Metal
To the World tonight,
Heavy Metal
To the world.
