What do you see inside your mind?
Is it your dreams or just the torment of life?
Break away from your anxieties today
Don't ever let them drag you down.

Conquer for life inside your dreams.
We'll never outlive all the schemes
Of darker spirits in between.
We're on the road, the Road of Kings.

What do you see in your minds eye?
Is it the fate of mankind to die?
Do you know or do you want to find the road
Back to the light before the dawn?

Conquer for life inside your dreams.
We'll never outlive all the schemes
Of darker spirits in between.
We're on the road, the Road of Kings.

What did you see behind the line?
Was it really what you expected to find?
On the road you must learn to take is slow,
A King won't rise before his time.

Conquer for life inside your dreams.
We'll never outlive all the schemes
Of darker spirits in between.
We're on the road, the Road of Kings.

Strong we will ve
On the Road of Kings
For what glory it brings us.
