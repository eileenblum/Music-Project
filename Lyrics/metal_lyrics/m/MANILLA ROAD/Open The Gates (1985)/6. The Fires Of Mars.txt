The fires of Mars shall burn
From this we all shall learn;
The gates unbarred at last
Banishing the past.
The standard raised on high
Pen-Dragon rides this night
Against the mighty Horde
With legion of the Sword......the Sword.

Warriors at the end of time,
Masters of light,
Feed the fires, storm the gates
It's not too late.

The mighty spear of Tiw
Drinks deep the blood anew
Of Demon Lords from Hell
Who are poisoning the well......the well.

Warriors at the end of time,
Master of light,
Feed the fires, storm the gates
It's not too late.

The Trinity, three Norns of Fate,
All-Father's Knights open the gates.
Golden wisdom from the stars
Bids us light the Fires of Mars,
Light the Fires of Mars.

In war there's always loss
All victories have their cost.
But hope shall conquer hate
For light Open the Gates,
Open the Gates.

Through the mists of Hell we ride
To the battle side by side
For survival of mankind
The Fires of Mars shall burn this night.

Through the mists of Hell we ride
To the battle side by side
For survival of mankind
The Fires of Mars shall burn this night,
Burn this night.
