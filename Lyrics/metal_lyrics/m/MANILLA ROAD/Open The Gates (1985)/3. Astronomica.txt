Under the stars
It's written in the cards,
All the myths that bards
Have sung through history.

The future's not so cold
Just trust the ways of old
Magik can save the soul
And set the spirit free.
It's not just fantasy.

Heavenly bodies,
Astrological minds,
Seeking out the wisdom
Of the stars at night,
To snatch from the heavens
The thunderbolt of light
And then the sceptre
From the tyrat's side.

Nigth after nigth
They shine on so bright,
All the ancient ligths
Shall never fade away.

Astronomica !
The laws that bind us all
To keep us from the fall
Unto the stars we gaze
And pray

Living for the future,
Living for the night,
Living for the masters,
Holy guardians of light.

Jupites is rising
Over the table round,
Sword of fire and Lightning
Ancients Rites have found.

Fight after fight
They shine on so bright,
All the ancient knights
Shall never fade away.
Astronomica !

The laws that bind us all
To keeps us from the fall
Unto the stars we gaze
And pray.

Universal wisdom
Of the Gods of old;
A conquerer's freedom
Is the danger zone.

Astromomic wasteland
Darkened and cold
Where the new born King stands
With sword of the throne.

Nigth after nigth
They shine on so bright
All the ancient ligths
Shall never fade away.

Astronomica,
The laws that bind us all
To keep us from the fall.
Unto the stars we gaze
And pray.
