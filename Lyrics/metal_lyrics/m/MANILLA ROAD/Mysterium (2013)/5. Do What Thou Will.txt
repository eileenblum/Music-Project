You have to do what thou will 
You've got to free yourself 
Is your cup empty or filled 
Wisdom is the true wealth 

Through science, man has evolved 
Into the master race 
Embracing the eight fold law 
Your will is your own fate 

If you believe 
That all your dreams 
Shall be fulfilled 
You will achieve 
What you can be 
Do what thou will 

Reaching out unto the muse 
Searching for the lost chord 
Seeking the metal that's true 
Scream out and raise your sword 

If you believe 
That all your dreams 
Shall be fulfilled 
You will achieve 
What you can be 
Do what thou will
