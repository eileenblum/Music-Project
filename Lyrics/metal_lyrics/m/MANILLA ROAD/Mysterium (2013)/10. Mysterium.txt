[I. Sea of Dreams]

O'er the sea of dreams, he sailed 
As the fair winds turned to gales 
Come to search the land outback 
Seeking knowledge that we lacked 

The sea of dreams 
The sea of dreams 

Ludwig Leichhardt was his name 
Explorer, destined for fame 
He would find his quest to be 
Across the sea of dreams 

The sea of dreams 
The sea of dreams

[II. The Quest] 

With compass and journal 
He set out 'cross the lands 
To seek Australia's truths 
For science and for man 

From east to northern coast 
He charted lands unseen 
Received a heroes name 
For all his honoured deeds 
Then came the final quest 
To trek from coast to coast 
It proved to be his last 
And turned him to a ghost 

[III. Into the Unknown]

Into the outbacks unknown 
Venturing from coast to coast 
His expedition lost, vanished with no trace 
Except for 'L's' carved in trees 
A burnt gun sling, near Sturt Creek 
Bearing his name plate, stamped 1848 
We may never really know 
What fate befell our heroes 
Australia's lost patrol 
Is still a mystery 
For science and adventure 
His work, a valued treasure 
Into the great unknown 
His life's destiny 
Following his dreams 
Into history
