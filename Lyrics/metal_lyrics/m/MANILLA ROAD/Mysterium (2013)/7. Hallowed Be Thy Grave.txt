There's tombs of the unknown soldiers 
Round all the world 
For honored and fallen warriors 
Names lost to the earth 

Their stories will never be told 
Lost for all times 
In memory of soldiers unknown 
And their sacrifice 

Hallowed be thy grave 
For the freedom of the ones you saved 
Hallowed be thy grave 
For the honor and the lives you gave 

The battlefields run red with blood 
Across the lands 
Souls flow through the gates like a flood 
The stain upon man 

These fallen ones never shall know 
Glory or fame 
Each soldier, an unknown hero 
Hallowed be thy grave 

Hallowed be thy grave 
For the freedom of the ones you saved 
Hallowed be thy grave 
For the honor and the lives you gave
