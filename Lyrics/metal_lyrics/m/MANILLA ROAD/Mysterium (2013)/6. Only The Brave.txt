Metal mayhem and wonder 
Rolling on through the night 
Bringing down holy thunder 
In the circle of light 

No one shall put asunder 
What we've forged here in fire 
Let the halls of Valhalla resounding 
Hail to the god with one eye 

If we must all go down in flames 
We'll go down fighting in Thor's name 
We'll ride the thunder to the grave 
Wielding death by the hammer 
Glory comes only to the brave 

Stand for metal and honor 
Raise your blades to the light 
Let the war cries of Midgard ring out 
Press on and never say die 

If we must all go down in flames 
We'll go down fighting in Thor's name 
We'll ride the thunder to the grave 
Wielding death by the hammer 
Glory comes only to the brave
