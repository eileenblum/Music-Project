Revolution 
Against the church and the crown 
Retribution 
Scottish clans stand their ground 
Border reivers 
Striking out at the realm 
Vengeance reapers 
Stand their ground and rebel 

Defenders of the clans 
Onward we ride hell bound 
Come down from the Highlands 
For freedom stand your ground 

By sword and shield 
Victory or the grave 
We'll take the field 
Win our freedom this day 

Defenders of the clans 
Onward we ride hell bound 
Come down from the Highlands 
For freedom stand your ground
