I'm drawn, like a moth to the light, in the mist 
As my ship rolls over the sea 
I've quested so long and I've traveled so far 
My treasure, an elusive dream 

I've never looked back on the things that I missed 
And still, in my heart, I believe 
That soon I shall find the fountain of life 
Fill my soul with it's sweet mead 

Search 'til the end of all time, if I must 
I'll never give up my beliefs 
Carry the torch, 'til my life turns to dust 
Never let go of my dreams 
No, I never let go of my dreams 
Still, I believe 

My destiny drives me to stay on this path 
And seek out the fountain of life 
I've come so far now, that there's no turning back 
I'll find the fountain or die 

Through jungles and forests, I've search for the place 
That feeds the gods' great tree of life 
I'm sure it's the truth, the well spring of youth 
Is waiting there, for me to find 

Search 'til the end of all time, if I must 
I'll never give up my beliefs 
Carry the torch, 'til my life turns to dust 
Never let go of my dreams 
No, I never let go of my dreams 
Still, I believe 

I'm drawn, like a moth to the light, in the mist 
As my ship rolls over the sea 
I've quested so long and I've traveled so far 
My treasure, an elusive dream 

I've never looked back on the things that I missed 
And still, in my heart, I believe 
That soon, I shall find the fountain of life 
Fill my soul with it's sweet mead 

Search 'til the end of all time, if I must 
I'll never give up my beliefs 
Carry the torch, 'til my life turns to dust 
Never let go of my dreams 
No, I never let go of my dreams 
Still, I believe
