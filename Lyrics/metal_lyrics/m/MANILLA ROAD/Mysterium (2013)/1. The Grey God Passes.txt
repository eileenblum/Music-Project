Onto the field of Clontarf 
Warlords scream in 
Both pagan and christian of heart 
An age comes to end 

The ground shall bear the mark
Of glory's crimson stain 

Battle is nigh
Raise up your eyes 
Look to the sky 
Valkyries fly 

Two honored chieftains collide 
Battle begins 
Comes the Grey God with one eye 
Fighting within 

The ground shall bear the mark
Of glory's crimson stain 

Battle is nigh
Raise up your eyes 
Look to the sky 
Valkyries fly 

The age of old gods ending 
Replaced by man's misgivings 
But still the ravens call to Odin 

The ground shall bear the mark
Of glory's crimson stain 

The spears of Clontarf gleaming 
The blood and sweat is streaming 
Resounding battle horns are calling 

Grey one eye apparition 
Grey hand of doom so viscous 
The Valkyrie choose from the fallen 

The age of old gods ending 
Replaced by man's misgivings 
But still the ravens call to Odin
