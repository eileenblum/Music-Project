When the full moon is high 
Fog creeping in 
Hear the sounds of the fight 
No one can win 
Echoing outlawed pipes 
Hauntingly played 
As the ghosts of brave knights 
Still fight this day 

Spectres still waging war 
In their deaths wake 
Battling evermore 
Till the daybreak 
Known throughout the Borders 
The Bloody Ridge 
Ghostly place of honor 
Bonchester Bridge 

Heaven still weeps 
For those noble souls 
Each full moon brings 
An army of warrior ghosts 

Haunting pipes sing 
Through the Border hills 
Heroes of dream 
Reliving the battle 

Heaven still weeps 
For those noble souls 
Each full moon brings 
An army of warrior ghosts 

Haunting pipes sing 
Through the Border hills 
Heroes of dream 
Reliving the battle
