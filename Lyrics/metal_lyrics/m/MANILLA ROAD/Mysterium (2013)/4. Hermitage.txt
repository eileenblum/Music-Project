To guard the bastard son 
That someday could be king 
The Elliott reiver clans 
Were charged with the bidding 
And as the tale is told 
This monster grew with age 
Torturing flesh and soul 
Inside the Hermitage 

The spirits stir again 
In ruins still it stands 
The keep of doom 
The Hermitage 

The Lord of Liddlesdale 
De Soulis be the name 
Whose grim debauchery 
Had earned a tyrant's fame 
A soulless pedophile 
Who wanted to be thane 
Who left a wake of death 
Behind his bloody reign 

The spirits stir again 
In ruins still it stands 
The keep of doom 
The Hermitage 

I felt the energy 
And stood within its walls 
I've seen the grey pale light 
Inside the ancient halls 
I've seen the pit of doom 
The dungeon of despair 
And felt the breath of hell 
Within the tyrant's lair 

The spirits stir again 
In ruins still it stands 
The keep of doom 
The Hermitage 

His body boiled alive 
Inside a vat of lead 
His ghost still haunts the keep 
His spirit trapped in death 

The spirits stir again 
In ruins still it stands 
The keep of doom 
The Hermitage
