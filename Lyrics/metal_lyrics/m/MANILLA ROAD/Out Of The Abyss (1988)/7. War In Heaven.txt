Here before the gates of heaven
Ancient warrior-gods are marching on
Here arise the sons of vengeance
Born upon the breast of every dawn
Here the time never elapses
Only quickening towards the fall
Here the horde of Chaos passes
Blindly following Cthulu's call

The sacred words are spoken
The Seventh Seal is broken
Valhalla's doors are open
The Fires of Mars burn on

All waring gods are destined
To fight until the fall
A war made here in heaven
The Fires burn ever on

Into the fire
Burning desire
Chaotic dreams of sin

Sacred words spoken
Seven Seal broken
Valhalla's doors open

Here the gods have come to fight
The heavens burn this night

Funeral pyre
Still growing higher
Fed with the souls of men

Mass execution
Chaotic solution
To this war in heaven

Here the gods have come to fight
The heavens burn this night

All waring gods are destined
To fight until the fall
A war made here in heaven
The Fires burn ever on
