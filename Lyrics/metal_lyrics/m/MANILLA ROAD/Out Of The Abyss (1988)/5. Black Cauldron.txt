Dark angel of Chaos
Cthulu comes
Bringer of evil
The Black Cauldron

Dead placed in the Cauldron
Re-animate
Doorway to Hades
The Old Ones' gate

The Old Ones bring Chaos to earth
Conjuring Yog-Sothoth's birth
The fires of the Cauldron burn red
Re-animating the dead

With blood from the Cauldron
The dead revive
To war for their master
Cthulu's pride

Aesir warriors
Stand and fight
As Chaotic nightmares
Come to life

The Old Ones bring Chaos to earth
Conjuring Yog-Sothoth's birth
The fires of the Cauldron burn red
Re-animating the dead
