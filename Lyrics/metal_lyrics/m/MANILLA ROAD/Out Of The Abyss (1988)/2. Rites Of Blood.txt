One night among the graves
I found a sacred place
Where blood of life still flows
From sacrificial blows
Ah, hidden from light of sun
Ah, the Rites have now begun

Inside this sanctum
Blood still feeds the gods
Blasphemous Requiem
The Rites of Blood

I hid among the rocks
And watched the Dance Macabre
Upon the altar stone
A young girl writhed and moaned
Ah, with spikes made out of gold
Ah, they nailed her to the stone

Inside this sanctum
Blood still feeds the gods
Blasphemous Requiem
The Rites of Blood

Nothing sacred here
In this place of fear
Where the blood runs cold

I could hear the cries
As the virgin died
Upon the stone

The crimson stained altar began to glow
As death turned into life
The virgin tore away the spikes of gold
Blood pouring from her eyes

She ripped out every heart
Tearing bodies apart
The Accolites all dead
She came to me and said
Ah, I come from dust of earth
Ah, to dust she did return

Inside this sanctum
Blood still feeds the gods
Blasphemous Requiem
The Rites of Blood
