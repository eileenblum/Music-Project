Dark Kryos of space,
Destined for life
Creation of Fates,
Birth of all time

Out of Hell,
Out of The Well,
Cadaverous night,
And crystal light

Out of The Well,
Comes the holy one,
Son of the White Witch,
Taliesin

Out of The Hell,
Comes Cthulu's rage,
Breather of life,
Into The Mirrored Cage

Eternal life is born
Heaven and Chaos form
The Metal tides come forth,
Bringing the winds of war
Out Of The Abyss
Out Of The Abyss

The holy peaks,
Of Helicon,
Come forth and speak,
Through Muse and song

Comes The Son,
Taliesin
A warrior's tale
Inside the Veils

Eternal life is born
Heaven and Chaos form
The Metal tides come forth,
Bringing the winds of war

Heaven and Hell collide,
Bringing Midgar to life,
Into the world of light,
Out Of The Abyss
