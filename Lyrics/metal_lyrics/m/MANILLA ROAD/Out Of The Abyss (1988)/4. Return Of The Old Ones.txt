Here in the darkness
Black Well of Chaos
Boiling before my eyes
In here the dead rise
Out of the Cauldron
Evil that never dies

Bringer of darkness
Demon of Chaos
King of eternal lies
Father of evil
Loosing his black minions
Into the night

Into the Cauldron I cast my life
Breaking the black spells of sacrifice

Into the Chaos
Enter the warriors
Aryan seed of life
War with Kthulos?
Re-animate life forms
Bringers of genocide

Nightmare's confusion
Morbid illusions
Wrecking the mortal mind
I Taliesin
Banish the Black Cauldron
With my own life

Into the Cauldron I cast my life
Breaking the black spells of sacrifice, into the light

The Old Ones shall return
Cthulu's words still burn
Into the etchings of all time

The Bardic songs of old
Of warriors brave and bold
Still echo magic in their rhyme

The fire burns bright
Inside the mind
Through death comes life
Blindness to sight, into the light

Here in the darkness
Black dreams of Chaos
I hear Cthulu's call
Forever The Old Ones
Shall be upon us
Until they devour us all
