Inside the Big Apple's subway
I slept upon the midnight train
I woke to horror and demise
What I now call end of the line

The Butcher's here

The bodies hung and all fileted
Inside this Midnight Meat Train
I killed the Butcher with his own knife
But the true horror had not died

Pale cannibals with filed teeth
Had come as every night to feast
They ate the tounge within my mouth
I am the one to serve them now

I serve the Fathers of New York
Midnight Meat Train
