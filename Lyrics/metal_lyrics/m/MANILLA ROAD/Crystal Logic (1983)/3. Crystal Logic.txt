For all the sorcery that we have told to thee
They call us demons from Hell
But they refuse to see being of Satan's league
They'll never drink from The Well

I'm not burning, look inside
Crystal Logic's what you'll find

God's Magik shines so bright with Sword of Fire and Light
The madness never can win
If thee be pure of mind never give up the fight
And thou shall not burn in sin

I'm not burning, look inside
Crystal Logic's what you'll find

If Satan comes to thee then thou should call on me
And I shall be st thy side
For if thee do believe thy soul will be set free
God's words ring true in my mind

I'm not burning, look inside
Crystal Logic's what you'll find

We never ever will die 'cause Heavy Metal is life
And not eternal hell
We always will believe destroying Satan's league
We take a drink from The Well

I'm not burning, look inside

We live in confusion
A sign of the times
A morbid illusion
We deny thee Belial
The Holy Mother
And the Father of Light
Will never refuse us logic
Crystal Logic

Oh masters of darkness
Beware of our songs
For they shall destroy thee
And save only the strong
There's good and there's evil
There's no in between
For we shall slay evil with logic
Crystal Logic, Crystal Magik, Crystal Logic
