I laid myself down into bed
To sleep away the night
A vision from inside my head
A sun with no sunlight
Death would grip humanitiy
A new Solar Ice Age
An Earth that no science could save

I woke sweatrunning down my face
I never felt so strange
To think that this could be our fate
To freeze in darkened pain
Then sleep brought back the dreams to me
Of wars to turn the tide
The world committing nuclear suicide

Inside this hazy world of dreams I've never known
I've seen the wrath come down and turn mankind to stone
And then I realized that this be Eschatus
A holocaust of flames to burn Midgard to dust

It has been called by many names throughout the years
Still they all mean the same, man burning in his fears
The Anti-Christ will come and rise up through the sea
The Dreams of Eschaton have shown this all to me

Before the Gods of Hell sentence you to die
Remember well my friend a warlord never cries
These are the words that I've heard inside my mind
When Ragnarok comes down we'll all run out of time

I hope that can see that this is not a game
We don't just sing to thee to win fortune and fame
The souls of all of us are priceless to the last
These dreams could be our fate of living life too fast

And so I say to thee watch the skies above
For when the darkness falls and rivers turn to blood
Then Arthur shall return to fight for peace and truth
To slay the beast of hell and save the righteous few

Before the Gods of Hell sentence you to die
Remember well my friend a warlord never cries
These are the words that I've heard inside my mind
When Ragnarok comes down we'll all run out of time
