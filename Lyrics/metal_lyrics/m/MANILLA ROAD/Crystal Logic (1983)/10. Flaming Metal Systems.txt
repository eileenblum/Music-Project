[2000 Re-issue Track]Beware, the shrapnel flies
Flaming through the night, this night, tonight
The fever of blood runs high
Lightning strikes from the sky, this night, tonight

[Chorus]
Take them down, down to the ground, fire away
Oh, I know just how you feel
Give them hell with flaming bloody steel
In this worlds darkest hour
Up the hammers to stay
Don't throw it away

Flaming metal systems
Blazing to the fight, this night, tonight
Axe victims of wisdom cry
Teaching themselves to die, this night, tonight

[Repeat Chorus]

Lightning strikes Thor's hammer
Flaming metal systems
Titans clash, cannons roar
Flaming metal systems
Ships of steel, funeral pyre
Flaming metal systems
Burning cross, sword of fire
Flaming metal systems
