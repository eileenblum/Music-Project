What lies in the dungeons
Of Holy mens fears
For what would kings cower
And men drown in tears
What brings death and pleasure
Growth and decay
What makes life worth living
Who's the master today

That's how note read
Slipped under my door
The reason I know not
I have to know more
A poem to ponder
A challenge this night
The Riddle Master
Wants to master my mind
Oh no no no, oh no no no

Strange I was choosen, the fool divine
To battle the master
Of riddle and rhyme
Another mountain
For me to climb
I must find the answer
Before I run out of time

I have no solution
My mind blank with fear
The riddle has slain me
The master is near
Another demon
Walking the Earth
An Angel of darkness
Lucifer
Oh no no no, oh no no no

I can't believe it's true
I feel so damned coonfused
All I know is I must carry on and on and on

With blazing steel I'll fight
The evil in the night
Daughter of hell I shall not lose, not to you

Then it came to me
Just like a waking dream
The answer had to be Reality

The master does not laugh
Defeated by a man
Leviathan be damned, yea, yea, yea
