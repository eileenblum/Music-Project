Seven-eyed wonder
Mystery to man
Riding the thunder
On God's command

Beyond the mountains
Lost in the sand
The golden statue
Of The Ram

Look for the lost and you just might find
That the cost is your mind
Ride the Serpent and make your stand
Cast no doubt to The Ram

Lost in confusion
Time slips away
Inside the illusion
Hear them say

Fight fire with fire
Give hell to the damned
Long live desire
Long live The Ram

Look for the lost and you just might find
That the cost is your mind
Ride the Serpent and make your stand
Cast no doubt to The Ram
