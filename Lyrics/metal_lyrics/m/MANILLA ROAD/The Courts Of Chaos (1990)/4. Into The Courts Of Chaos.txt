Here in the fire
Nothing belongs to god
Only the fire
Burning away the heart
Here in the mind
The holy war is fought
Out of all time
Into the Courts of Chaos

Here in the fire
Only the strong survive
Blasphemous fire
Burning the soul alive
Sons of the night
Come to claim what was lost
These holy knights
Come to the Courts of Chaos

Here in this unholy pit of despair
Nightmares of hell come alive
Here the true enemy is your own fear
Honor is but to survive

Blessed Be warriors who fight here and die
Heros thee are to us all
Inside these halls Valkyries have no sight
If thee are felled thee be lost

Warrior cries
Echoing through the night
Inside these halls
The horde of Chaos falls

Inside these halls of hell
The Old One still he dwells
Sitting upon the throne of Chaos

Master of all his race
Monster insatiate
'Tis he we come to slay in Chaos

Hear our cries
In Odin's name we figth
Inside these halls
The throne of Chaos falls

Into the Courts of Chaos
Into the halls of eternal despair
Into the Courts of Chaos
The only enemy is your own fear
