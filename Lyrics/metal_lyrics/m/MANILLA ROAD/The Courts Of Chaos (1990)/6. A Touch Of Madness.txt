So little wisdom
Inside the mind
Mostly the madness of life
Unbalanced fission
Building inside
Melt-down of logical sight

Torment is burning
Inside the brain
Something is yearning
To escape the pain
Here in the fire
Only the strong survive

Ashes to ashes
Minds turn to dust
Lost in the whirlwind
A touch of madness

Caught in a crossfire
Of reality and dream
No one seems to hear the screams
Lightning the funeral pyre
And living in the flame
Nothing gained without pain

Torment is burning
Inside the brain
Something is yearning
To escape the pain
Here in the fire
Only the strong survive

Ashes to ashes
Minds turn to dust
Lost in the whirlwind
A touch of madness

I'm touched
By madness

Standing before the Labyrinth
The birthing place of true torment
No time left to confess
For the wicked there is no rest
When touched by madness

Lost in a fantasy
Distorted and deranged
Wild the spirit never tamed
Taught by humanity
To cage what's deemed insane
No one wants to take the blame

Torment is burning
Inside the brain
Something is yearning
To escape the pain
Here in the fire
Only the strong survive

Ashes to ashes
Minds turn to dust
Lost in the whirlwind
A touch of madness

I'm touched
By madness
