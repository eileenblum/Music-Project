As I gaze upon the rising storm
My will and my body torn
Seven years into the Cyborg Wars
I've caught a glimpse of nevermore
As the mountains crumble to the sea
Mankind's brought to its' knees
And the land is scorched by war machines
As foretold in The Prophecy

Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Live by the gun
And by the gun you die

As I gaze into the braziers coals
The winds of time begin to blow
And I see the blood of many souls
Spilled on the battlefield of woe

Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
No time to bleed

Nature undone
Engulfed by fire
Of Prophecy

As I gaze into the mists of time
I hear the ancient rhyme
And the Valla's words run through my mind
Out of the death shall come new life

Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
No time to bleed

Nature undone
Engulfed by fire
Of Prophecy
