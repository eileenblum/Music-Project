Here I stand like the rock
Born and bred to survive
I may not be at the top
But still it's good to be alive
Feeling the flow of the chops
Whether be music or flesh
This is where sanity stops
But don't dig a grave for me yet

Dig me no grave

I was a rocker from the birth
A ocker I'll be till I die
Scorching the face of the earth
Bringing the music to life
Flying on high like a bird
Nothing can ever shoot down
Metal is dead so I've heard
But no while I'm still above ground

So dig me no grave

This is the dream of my life
This is the life of my dream
It's a hard road to survive
But nothing comes easy or free
Seems to be so little time
Yet life is an eternity
I haven't made my last rhyme
So keep your damn dirt off of me

Dig me no grave
