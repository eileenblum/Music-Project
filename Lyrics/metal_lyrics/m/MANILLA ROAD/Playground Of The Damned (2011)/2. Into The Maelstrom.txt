Drawn into the maelstrom
Brothers three lost at sea
A cyclone of mayhem
Spiraling to the deep

The waters of bedlam
Scream to thee deafening
Hopeless situation
Puppets on a string

Inside of the maelstrom
Waves like ice, black as night
A whirlpool of chaos
Triton's eye opens wide

Descent into madness
Most have died, one survived
From out of the abyss
I escaped alive
