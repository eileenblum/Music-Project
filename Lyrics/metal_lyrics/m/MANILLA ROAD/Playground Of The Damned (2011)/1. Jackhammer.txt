I come from the place that you fear
To reap life and soul
Though centuries old I'm still here
King of the unknown

Angel fallen
Reaper calling
I am coming

I come for the souls that are lost
And trapped in the void
Hauntings in the palace of thought
That teach and destroy

Angel fallen
Reaper calling
Jack is coming

Angel fallen
Reaper calling
I am coming
