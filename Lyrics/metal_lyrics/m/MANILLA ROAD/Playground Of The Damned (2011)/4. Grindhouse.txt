Welcome to the mind of a madman
Welcome to the house of pain
Inside this nightmare of slaughter
The reaper always knows your name

Welcome to the chamber of horror
Welcome to the psychic maze
Evisceration and torture
The doctor's in come out and play

Victims before my eyes
The film brings back to life
The evil genius of the grindhouse

The planet terrorized
When living dead arise
No one of death proof
In the grindhouse

Welcome to the circus of chaos
Welcome to the freak parade
By the gun and by machete
Send the dead back to the grave

Victims before my eyes
The film brings back to life
The evil genius of the grindhouse

The planet terrorized
When living dead arise
No one of death proof
In the grindhouse
