See from you shadows run away
You shall live still beyond the grave
See this world of death and decay
Soon mankind will be forced to change

In the light of the moon
Trust in the muse
Feed the fire light the fire
It's up to you

See man seems to have lost his way
You can be the world's saving grace
See the demons of earth at play
You can send them back to the grave

In the light of the moon
Trust in the muse
Feed the fire light the fire
It's up to you

In the light of the moon
Trust in the muse
Feed the fire light the fire
It's up to you
