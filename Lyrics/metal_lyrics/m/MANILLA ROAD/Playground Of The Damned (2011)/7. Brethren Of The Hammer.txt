Brethren of the hammer band together
United meal brothers
Stand and fight as one
True to the oath of blood

Never run away
Look death in the face
Hold onto your faith

Magik, it's more than science, Crystal Logic
We stand defiant with the
Banners raised on high
Press on never say die

Now's the time for us to unite
We're the brethren of the hammer
Feed the fire, raise the horns on high
Bring down the thunder of the gods

Never run away
Look hell in the face
Hold onto your faith

Music, the strongest magik learn to use it
Bathe your soul and you can
Cast the spell of light
Sing to the gods this night

Now's the time for us to unite
We're the brethren of the hammer
Feed the fire, raise the horns on high
Bring down the thunder of the gods

Now's the time for us to unite
We're the brethren of the hammer
Feed the fire, raise the horns on high
Bring down the thunder of the gods

Never run away
Look death in the face
Hold onto your faith

Never run away
Look hell in the face
Hold onto your faith
