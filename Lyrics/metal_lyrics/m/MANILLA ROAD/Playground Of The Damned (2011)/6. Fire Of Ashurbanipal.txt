I've followed the ancient rhyme
Across distant lands
A quest that has led my life
To these desert sands
Seeking the fire of the damned

This jewel
Artifact of the past
This orb of Cthul
I have found at last

A city lost in the sand
From forgotten times
Guarded by unearthly hands
A jewel red as fire

Fire of Ashurbanipal
Hides behind black temple walls
All who dare touch this gem fall
Under the black demon's claws

This jewel
Artifact of the past
This orb of Cthul
I have found at last

I dare not disturb
This breath would be my last
Heed what you've heard
Or lose your soul to the past
