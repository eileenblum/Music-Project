[Trilogy 3: Gates Of Fire: Part 2]

The mighty horde of Persia
Could not break the Greeks
The tree hundred Spartans
Accept not defeat

Even the Immortals
Xerkses' pride of war
Die in bloody battle
By spear and by sword

Betrayal by one of our own
Betrayal of gods and the throne

Anopaia Pass found
From traitor's tale
Immortals doth surround
The Spartans through betrayal

Arrows block the sun out
The three hundred die
Here courage did abound
In the Gates of Fire

Betrayal by one of our own
Betrayal of gods and the throne
Betrayal by one of our own
Betrayal of gods and the throne

Betrayal
Betrayal
Betrayal
Betrayal
