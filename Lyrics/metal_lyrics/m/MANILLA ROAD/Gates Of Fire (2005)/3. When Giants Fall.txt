[Trilogy 1: The Frost GiantÂ´s Daughter: Part 3]

My body aches from the chase
Nothing about this is sane
I can't get over her face
I'm like a moth to the flame
I've fallen into her trap
To face her two brothers wrath
Delivered unto their path
The red haired giants attack

Flight thee well among the gods
Death and honor for Valhalla
Deadly merchant son of Crom
Hear the thunder of Ymir's Call
When giants fall

I run headlong to the fight
Cleaving with all of my might
Their axes frosted with ice
So nearly taking my life
Atali's brother's are bold
They seek to harvest my soul
Sword singing death to my foe
I spread their blood on the snow

Flight thee well among the gods
Death and honor for Valhalla
Deadly merchant son of Crom
Hear the thunder of Ymir's Call
When giants fall

I claim the wench as my prize
Her skin is cold as the ice
I see now fear in her eyes
Oh father save me she cries
The Borealis ablaze
When she called to Ymir's name
Enveloped in icy flame
She disappears from earth's face

Flight thee well among the gods
Death and honor for Valhalla
Deadly merchant son of Crom
Hear the thunder of Ymir's Call

When giants fall
When giants fall

Lightning strikes Thor's hammer
Thunder roars through the sky
When giants fall
Vanaheim's gates open, light the funeral pyre
When giants fall
Demigods hear me well comes a son of the night
When giants fall
I would face any hell just to gaze in her eyes
When giants fall
