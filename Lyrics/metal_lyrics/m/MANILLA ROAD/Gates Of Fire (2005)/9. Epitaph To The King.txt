[Trilogy 3: Gates Of Fire: Part 3]

The battle-roar is over
No Spartan left alive
The fallen king is silent
His spirit's taken fight

Rest in peace my king
Heroic were your deeds

He stood his ground with honor
In spite of certain death
Three hundred gave for Sparta
A glorious last breath

Rest in peace my king
Heroic were your deeds
