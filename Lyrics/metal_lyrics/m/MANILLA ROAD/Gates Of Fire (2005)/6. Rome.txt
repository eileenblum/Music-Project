[Trilogy 2: Out Of The Ashes: Part 3]

Rome - Italia's shining light
Rome - Empire of power and might
Rome - From Egypt to northern Gaul
Rome - Conquerors of all they saw

The Fires of Mars have burned
Temples raised to Jupiter
The Ides of March have turned
The course of history

Rome - Feared and honored state
Rome - Product of Trojan fate
Rome - Hear the trumpets call
Rome - Glorious unto the fall

The Fires of Mars have burned
Temples raised to Jupiter
The Ides of March have turned
The course of history

Harken the tale of Aeneas - Last hero of Iliam
Mortal born son of Venus - Destined to Latium
Prophecy's promise of saving - The last Trojan line
Spoiler of ethnic cleansing - Who fathered the Roman Empire

For all of time - Forget not the Trojan line
Imperious rise - The birth of Roman's fire
Unto the sky - We raise our swords this night
Until we die - We praise the gods on high

Through bardic rhymes
The ancient tales still survive
Inside my mind - The Eagles banners still fly
On Neptune's tide - Ghost ships sail through the night
Into the fight - For Jupiter the legions ride

Troy's holocaust - Vision Cassandra saw
Aeneas brought - Rebirth from what was lost
The legions fought - For Rome and ancient gods
The tale is taught - Know ye now more or not
