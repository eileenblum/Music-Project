[Trilogy 1: The Frost GiantÂ´s Daughter: Part 1]

Upon this field of honor
Icy, crimson death
Bodies hacked and dismembered
Shields and armor cleft
Before me the last Vanir
No one at my side
Say your last prayers to Ymir
It's your time to die

The riddle of steel
The truth shall be revealed
With sword my hand wields
This day we shall solve the riddle
You shall feel my steel

Your brethren in Valhalla
My name you shall tell
To some I'm known as Amra
Many men I've felled
Across of all Hyborea
Tales of me are told
It's Conan of Cimmeria
Whom shall reap your soul

The riddle of steel
The truth shall be revealed
With sword my hand wields
This day we shall solve the riddle
You shall feel my steel

The clash of steel does echo
Through the snow packed waste
We both unleash our deathblows
Blood drawn by both blades
Through wounded I'm the victor
Blood pours from my head
I am the one survivor
On this field of death

The riddle of steel
The truth shall be revealed
With sword my hand wields
This day we shall solve the riddle
You shall feel my steel
