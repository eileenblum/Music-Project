As the fearless voyagers arrive
Everyone runs for their lives
Holgar and his Vikings come this night
Dare oppose them and you'll die
Butchers of the sea

Fighting for the praise of Nordic Gods
Seeking entry to The Hall
Running from the plague of Christian law
In Odin's name they fall
Butchers of the sea

Destiny does drive them cross the sea
In the service of their king
Wisdom came from hanging on The Tree
For Valhalla they shall bleed
Butchers of the sea
