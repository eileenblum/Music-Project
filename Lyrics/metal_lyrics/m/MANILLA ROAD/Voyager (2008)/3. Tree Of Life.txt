Climbing up The Tree
Ladder to the light
So many names have thee
All-Father of life
Searching for the truth

Hanging from The Tree
Contemplating life
Tis knowledge that we seek
Wisdom for an eye
Searching for the truth

Looking to the stars
Each and every night
Wondering who we are
Always asking why

Can't you see what it means?
Can't you believe in The Tree?

Branching to nine worlds
Connected by three planes
The mighty Yggdrasil
Tree of life and pain

Can't you see what it means?
Can't you believe in The Tree?

Hanging from The Tree
All-Father of life
