Teaching the art of warfare
Holgar begins his crusade
Tula to Chichen Iza
The Man-God King leads the way

For Valhalla
Vikings onward
Bloody conquest
Unto his death

Upon the sacred skull rack
The heads of enemy kings
Sacrificed to the ancients
For victory's they did bring

For Valhalla
Vikings onward
Bloody conquest
Unto his death

For Valhalla
Vikings onward
Bloody conquest
Unto his death
