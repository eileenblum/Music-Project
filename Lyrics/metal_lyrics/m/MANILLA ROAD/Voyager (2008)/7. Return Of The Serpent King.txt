Up in the sky All-Father's eyes
The ravens fly out of the storm
Saved by horn sounded by Thor
Faith in the light now is restored

Sacrificial hearts are burned
As the Serpent King returns
He'll await the call unto the fall
Come Ragnarok

The Toltec's came to meet the waves
That brought the Gods back to their shore
Mistaken for Man-God of lore
Voyager's fate cast by The Norns

Through the jungles, mist and fog
To the city build by Gods
Sacrificial hearts are burned
As the Serpent King returns
He'll await the call unto the fall
In Valhalla

The Serpent King Holgar is deemed
The Lord of Doom come from the storm
Led by the sword the Toltec horde
Follows their king's conquest of war

Through the jungles, mist and fog
To the city build by Gods
Sacrificial hearts are burned
As the Serpent King returns
He'll await the call unto the fall
In Valhalla
