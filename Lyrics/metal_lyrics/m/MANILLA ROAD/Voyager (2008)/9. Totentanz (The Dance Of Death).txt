Destiny drove him across the seas
Finding a new world in his quest to be free
Tribes of this brave world stand firm in belief
Who followed the Man-God unto his defeat

Defenders of the faith
Voyager's quest
Totentanz for the king
The dance of death

The dance of death
Defender of the faith
Voyager's quest
Totentanz for the king
The dance of death

Dance for the serpent, dance for the king
Who conquered the new world in search of a dream
Unto Valhalla the Valkyries bring
The soul of The Butcher the Man-God King

Defender of the faith
Voyager's quest
Totentanz for the king
The dance of death

The dance of death
Defender of the faith
The dance of death
Voyager so brave
The dance of death
Defender of the faith
The dance of death
Voyager so brave
