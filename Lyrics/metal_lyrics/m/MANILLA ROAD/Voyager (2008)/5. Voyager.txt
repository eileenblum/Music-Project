Lo there do I see the All-Father
Upon the mist the ancient ones
Lo there do I see in Valhalla
The Thunder God, Odin's son

Lo there do I see across the water
A brave new world for me and you
Lo there do I see the Voyager
A dragon-ship of dreams come true

You can have your peace
No straw death for me

To unknown seas
Voyager brings
The Man-God King
Lord of doom
Bound by truth
Like the runes
On the tomb
We do sing

Asaheim's hero's sail to the ends of the earth
As the Valkyries watch o'er the Voyager

Hear the battle cries
As the Skraelings die
Draw your sword this night

Raise the banners on high
Up the hammers and fight

All-Father's warriors sail to the edge of the world
Staying true to their faith in Thor's Hammer
