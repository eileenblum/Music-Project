Father said the crop was going to be a good one
A lot of holes to dig, a lot work to be done
Good old Gein goes to pay a visit to a stone
Maybe he'll keep you company if you're all alone

[chorus]
Gein we trust in you we trust in me
Gein, but what is this, what does it mean
Gein, no we don't know this place
Have you seen Gein

Mister Ed comes back from the dead to ply his trade
Skull cup-a-soup fast on a boney chair he's amde
Lots of parts all packed away in boxes nice and clean
Human nipple necklace, your a scream Mister Gein

[repeat chorus]

He's happy to watch the kids till you get back
Let's go out to the smokehouse, something new upon the rack
Nothing really showing through the windows all day
They're painted black so we don't know what to say

Wearing what face flayed grey and frozen
Sad sick desd faces, he's got them by the dozen
He becomes the person that he'd taken way back when
So he can kill himself and still live to kill again
