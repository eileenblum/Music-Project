Hack

So here you are lift your head
You fed on dawns early light, you're so right
I'm a puppet on a string
You're a thing

Unreal you rise like coiled diamond surprise
You make my bed
I'm wed to you
What can i do, i could

[chorus]
Hack it off and find a way
Start another life today
Grease the guillotine, make it pay
Bye bye baby, bye bye

Iron studded icon you molten lead music
Into the greedy ears of America
So they can swallow every drop
Of your cathode ray amor'e

A moray eel steals into a thousand hearts of darkness
While Cupid's bow snaps like the spine of love
And he pulls out his bazooka instead
So many dead

[repeat chorus]

Mirror windshield shards fly like fractured facts
I ain't no saint so paint me black
And send me somewhere
I don't care

If I made a point it's just  afly in the ointment
Anoint me holy mother of maggots
For I have sinned against love
What's love ? I think I love it, but i want to 

Hack, hack
