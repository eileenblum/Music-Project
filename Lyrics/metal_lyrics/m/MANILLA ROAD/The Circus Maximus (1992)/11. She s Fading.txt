A painting of a young girl sleeping, framed in silver
While all her life is time
Winter is failing dignity... she draws the shade
And lying to her grace
Thinks she feels security... Where nothing dies

She speaks in soft filter smiles
Tastes the rain of memories water... can't heal her pain
She stares into a mirrors cracked and broken lines
A little girl waves goodbye

She's fading as her hour glass runs out
So sorry for the pain
Still waiting for a girl from the magazines
A torn and yellowed page

In her darkened room she cries
For faces, now shining halos
Can't believe what time has done for her
Can't stop thinking through the frame

She's fading as her hour glass runs out
So sorry for the pain
While all her life is time
Winter finds a place for her, and draws the shade
