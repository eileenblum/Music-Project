Terror inside my domain
Spawning a life so insane
Horrors unspeakable name
Haunting my soul again

Three witches told me of this at the start
Thay said it would be the death of my heart
No feeling for life or loss of love
My fate is to die on a throne of blood

I have raised my voice in anger
Unto the elder gods
Royal blood drips fom my dagger
And I am lost

I strived in lust for power
And stained my path in blood
Now the woods come to devour
My throne of blood

Violence has reigned or'e my life
Sword drawn to combat the strife
Once I had visions of light
Now my fate is but to die

The ghost of the king that I have slain
Comes tormenting me again and again
No power on earth can save my soul
I should have trusted in the gods of old

I have raised my voice in anger
Unto the elder gods
Royal blood drips from my dagger
And I am lost

I strived in lust for power
And stained my path in blood
Now the woods come to devour
My throne of blood

Terror inside my domain
Spawning a life so insane
Horrors unspeakable name
Haunting my soul once again
