In a dream was playing the hero when
Lightning stopped my nerves were shattered
Dark laughter said that I was much too late
For the very last time
Night again and somehow colder
Breath escapes in a crystal haze and I
Chase panic in the black of a whispered scream
As blood turns to crimson ice

Murder by degrees
And frost killing time
I still see my brothers eyes
Burning thru the freeze

Vision clouds to the sight of a dream and then
Grey eyes of a snow wolf fills the skies
Feel the hot sting of winters dying kiss
A glass angel chills my heart

Murder by degrees
And frost killing time
I still see my brothers eyes
Burning thru the freeze

Snow creatures swarming as sleep comes I fall
I'm pulled thru a crack in the ice
