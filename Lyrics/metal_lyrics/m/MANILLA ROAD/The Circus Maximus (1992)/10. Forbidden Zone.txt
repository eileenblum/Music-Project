I've traversed on my own
To the forbidden zone
The place where
All the others never dare to go

To reach beyond the norms
A fusion to all forms
To go where no one else has gone before
Open all those hidden magik doors

This is the is the place of magikal unknowns
No one can help you here inside the zone
You've got to make it happen on your own
You've got to go yourself you cannot phone

Deep in the heart 
Of the forbidden zone
Here I am master of my destiny
Deep in the heart 
Of the forbidden zone
Is where dreams turn into reality

Time has come to pass
I have to take the chance
Reaching out into the unknown
Throw away the fear
Let the magik appear
Inside the forbidden zone

Deep in the heart
Of the forbidden zone
Here I am master of my destiny
Deep in the heart 
Of the forbidden zone
Is where dreams turn into reality
