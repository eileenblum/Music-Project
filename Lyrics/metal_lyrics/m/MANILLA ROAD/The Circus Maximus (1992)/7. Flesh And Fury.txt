Ther you are in jet white allegiance
Sending words of wishfull thinking through the air
There you stand on the thin ice of believing
Squared for battle, you here the trumpets call

Faith take hold, cold smile diguises
Kneel and breed deception
Then the world, look thru it's fingers
Finds there's just not much to see

In our power glory to us one and all
Fell no love in freedom
Don't cry, it's only thunder in your head
Driving flesh and fury

There you are in a flash of frozen moments
On tomorrows edge and waiting at the gate
There you stand killing all your words of love
Whispering hooks in the mouth of fate

Fall from grace, talk from the corners
Raise your hands to heaven
Then from the shadows choice comes crawling out
In silence, sister victory

Can you see them come to rescue me
Mother reaching out to compassion
Can you see them standing on the other side
The warning, god has come for you

Hre we are a circle of shadows
Waiting in the wings
Hare we are stand patiently watching
The wheels set in motion

Over-night sensation breaking
Overkill religion
Back from the alley, truth comes screaming out
For mothers of mercy

In our power glory to us aone and all
Feel no love in freedom
Don't cry it's only thunder in your head
Driving flesh and fury
