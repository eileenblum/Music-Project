We have searched troughout eternity
To find the hidden truth
But it still remains a mystery
Man doesn't have a clue

And we strive so hard for snity
That we can't find the news
What happened to serenity
I thought we paid our dues

Waiting for a sign
Waiting for a sign from above
Waiting for a sign
Waiting for a sign from above

As the tyrants lead us all astray
Through the timeless winds of war
There will be no other games to play
When our bones rot on the shore

And it seems we've nothing more to say
Than the things we've said before
We must break out of the moldedc lay
Get back our wings and soar

Don't wait for a sign
There'll be sign come from above
Get your wings and fly
Wash away the stain of blood

Yet the chains are still unbroken
And you haven't learned to fly
If we don't get back our wings
We're sure to die

Don't wait for a sign
Tere'll be no sign from above
Get your wings and fly
Wash away the stain of blood
