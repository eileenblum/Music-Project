In the corner of my empty room
There is a place where sunlight dies
No seems to care
For the lost and lonely ones
Out of sight is out of mind
Still I wait for mornings warm embrace
I can't see into the dark
Is someone watching me

Now that it's all over
What can you believe in when you kiss the night
Feels like everything is dying
Give me some eternal light

People stand around as castles fall to crumbled ruins
Don't lift a finger - he might just take your money or your life
Slip away
Hide behind an epmty stare
Much safer now pretending to be blind
No more, Ican't take it any more
I'm leaving for a brighter place
So much brighter

Now that it's all over
What can you believe in when you kiss the night
Feels like everything is dying
Give me some eternal light

Not so long ago
I'd have waited for a lifetime
For the chance to think it over
Someday I hope to find
The truth in love and reason
Such things I'll never find alone

Waiting in darkness
I've gone weary of the chase
Still conscience lingers on so tired
Goodbye promise me you'll hope for something after
It's much brighter than today
So much brighter
