Just apart of me afraid to call my own
Locked inside these barren walls - my heart
When she appeared I knew the meaning of emotion
But I don't remember feeling

Another part of me I need to call my own
Turns to face this precious sight - my hope
And then she said to me
I wonder why you see me like you do
Such an innocent child
Like Alice trapped in her looking glass

She is my agony my sorrow
Someone to follow through the rain
No touch no feeling of life
And here I am believing what she tells me
She's just a shadow on the pane

As the master of illusion I can't go on
Breathing life into the picture on the wall
But when she sings I hear the happiness of angels
I close my eyes
And when I look again no ones there at all

She is my agony my sorrow
Someone to follow through the rain
No touch no feeling of life
And here I am believing what she tells me
She's just a shadow on the pane

And when she came to me again
Out from the wall
She showed me her disease

It's closer now

And when she spoke to me again
She speaks in whispers only
She wanted more of me
She opened all the windows

I took her hand and I threw my mind away
Just for a moment I knew love
