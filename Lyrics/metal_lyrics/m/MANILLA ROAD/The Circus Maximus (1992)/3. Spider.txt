Spider, do you have a name
Moving like a black fist
Moving like a dark flame

Spider, when to sleep
Sink it in my flesh
Sink it in so deep

Spider, under my bed
What you did to my daddys' leg
What you did to my head

The spider, in my dreams
Want ot wake up
Want ot scream

You don't know what you did
To me with your wicked little mind
You don't know what you do
To me with your wicked little mind
Never wonder why

Spider, now I'm dreaming
And my body is something to bite
To suck it dry

Tear into my gut, wouldn't you try
If you were bigger
If you were bigger

You don't know what you did
To me with your wicked little mind
You don't know what you do
To me with your wicked little mind
Fucking little mind

No, no, no
So now I'm coming to kill you
At least your awake I'm alive
Tiny black eyes open
Trying to hide
Maybe I'll miss you
Run into the night
Find a place to go to sleep
And dream of flies
