Through the magik of music
I have searched for the key to the door
In my mind it's so perfect
Most beautiful chord

It's so clear whe I'm dreaming
Sound so epic I've not heard before
Can you tell me the reason
So elusive this chord
Lo and behold

Blessed I am to hear this
Cursed I am to be lost in this search
It's the muses lasting kiss
Tis blessed this curse

It's so clear whe I'm dreaming
Sound so epic I've not heard before
Can you tell me the reason
So elusive this chord
Lo and behold

I will never stop searching
For this magikal mystery chord
Maybe I am still dreaming
I'll find the lost chord

Blessed I am to hear this
Cursed I am to be lost in this search
It's the muses lasting kiss
Tis blessed this curse
