So many cultures assimilated
Absorbed by the conquering tribes
Created what would be a new order
First dynasty of power and might

The reign of dreams
Given life by Sumer's kings
The reign of dreams
Unto elder Gods the priests did sing

Kings of invention and the architects
Who laid the founding blocks of man
Civilization was born of this age
A time when dreams did rule the land

[Chorus]
