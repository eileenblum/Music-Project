The battles rage across Mesopotamia
Giving birth to the land of kings
A war between Sumer and the Akkadians
Brought forth a civilized world dream

A world of dreams and fears
The birth pangs of a new bronze age
The truth of life is here
The words are written in the clay

Before the times of great kings of Assyria
Before the rise of Babylon
Before the light of Luxifera was a thought
The lore of Gilgamesh was taught

[Chorus]
