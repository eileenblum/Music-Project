Halloween on the moors the moon burns full and bright
It seems we've been here before the fog creeps through the night
Camped upon shining Tor we burn the Rowan Fires
Hear the hunters horns this night

And it seems like England in the days of old
Oh the night is warm but I am cold

Oh from the fires of Hell I hear the haunting cries
Eh reminding us of this night of nights
Oh these feelings come to me from deep inside
Eh the Hounds of Yeth lead the Midnight Ride
Oh as the energy sends shivers down my spine
Eh I see the cycles of my life
Oh can you ever tell fate from destiny
Eh this night both can set you free

The stars they shine so bright
A mystery we cannot light
The difference from wrong and right is forgotten tonight
So now we know for sure the hunt is on this night
Annwyn is really there and will be for all time
The spirits of the dead shall fly to Avalon
The yellow eyed Hounds of Yeth howl on

And it seems like England in the days of old
Oh the night, the night is warm but I am cold

Oh from the fires of Hell I hear the haunting cries
Eh reminding us of this night of nights
Oh these feelings come to me from deep inside
Eh the Hounds of Yeth lead the Midnight Ride
Oh as the energy sends shivers down my spine
Eh I see the cycles of my life
Oh can you ever tell fate from destiny
Eh this night both can set you free
Oh I do hear the cries inside my hazy head
Eh The Rowan Fires summon up the dead
Oh the air is filled with horns of warriors bold
Eh they ride the sky searching for lost souls

Halloween in the moors here on Shining Tor
Halloween in the moors here on Shining Tor
Halloween in the moors here on Shining Tor
Halloween
Halloween

A night of conquest summoned
But this we did not know
We fly on demon horses
Collecting all lost souls
The winds of mighty Annwyn
Blow in from coast to coast
The Hounds of Yeth are calling
To all the wandering souls

Some souls are lost forever
But some still have a chance
To ride with ancient warlords
Across these blessed lands
The Rowan Fires are burning
The Hounds of Yeth lead on
The Wild Hunt has opened
The Gates of Avalon
