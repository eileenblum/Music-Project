These thoughts could be considered heresy
But history's truth is in our face
We must get past religious lunacy
If there's hope for the human race

Out of the ashes of our past
Comes proof of who we are at last

These words could be considered blasphemy
But knowledge ebbs up from the grave
Stop spilling blood for Gods insanity
And put away the sword of hate

Out of the ashes of our past
Comes proof of who we are at last

Out of the ashes of our past
