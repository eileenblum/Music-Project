The first telling of the deluge
Within the epic Gilgamesh
With every creature two by two
Upon the ark and saved from death

Open up your mind
Read between the lines
Wisdom is the prize

To be pagan is heresy
According to the good king James
In truth these words are blasphemy
Unto the Gods of man's first faiths

Open up your mind
Read between the lines
Wisdom is the prize
Open up your eyes
Fire rains from the sky
Luxifera's light

Just like the times of the crusades
Medieval thought does still prevail
The faith of hate cuts like a blade
And hides the truth behind the veil

Open up your mind
Read between the lines
Wisdom is the prize
