I remember well the oath I made that fall
As the All-Father took reign from his mighty hall
I have vowed to honor him and the Gods of light
Bring back life to ancient tales man lost in the night

This blessed curse is now my world
This blessed curse is what I'm worth

As the Green Man's time came over all the land
The icy grip of death had its hold on man
I have kissed the muse been blinded by the light
Now I tell the ancient tales man lost in the night

[Chorus]
