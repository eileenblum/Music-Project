The light is shining
Upon the race of man
Though most of us are blinded
And never understand
That honor breeds from virtue
In like of elder clans
Their spirits stand beside you
To make a stand defending man
From the abyss
We have felt the muses kiss

Who will be calling
Unto the Gods of old
Technology is driving
The old ways from our souls
So hang unto the memory
Of ancients brave and bold
And never break the circle
Of magik lore that stays the horde
From the abyss
I have felt the muses kiss

We have felt the muses kiss
We have felt the muses kiss
