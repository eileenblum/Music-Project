And I do believe
That you will carry on
Even when I leave
I know that you'll be strong

Here I will be for you
Till the end of all time
Till the end of time

And I do believe
That you will be the one
Who will set me free
And save me with your love

[Chorus]

And I do believe in you
You must all carry on
Even thou I have left you
You must always be strong

The muse brought me to you
In the wink of an eye
The voice of a true fool
In quest of the light
