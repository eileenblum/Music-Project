Reaching out from the ancient graves
The truth is found within the ash
The dead still have something to say
Within the clay of Man's past

The time is here the logic clear
Throw off the hate that's shackled man
Seek out the truth lost in our youth
It's not too late to understand

Deciphering the ancient clay
Has brought new light upon our past
And given birth to a new day
Where truth and wisdom have a chance

[Chorus]
