Have you questioned the truth of your faith
Know its origins
Have you passed the light of the gate
Be it forbidden

The blinded still pray
To plagiarized lore
They say it's the way
No other before

Follow your own path of light
Seek out the wisdom
Drink of the waters of life
Be it forbidden

It's not too late
Save your own soul
Make your own fate
Never let go

Feels like we're falling
Into the pit of despair
No angels calling
Chasing away all your fears

It's not too late
Save your own soul
Make your own fate
Never let go

Feels like we're falling
Into the pit of despair
No angels calling
Chasing away all your fears
