All this life your unforgiven
If you seek the truth of the stars
A requiem for man's salvation
If we don't ever reach out that far

Devilish is man's deception
Using faith to mentally enslave
Grave the cost of mass redemption
Feeding fires of war that steal the brave
Just one way to our survival
Pioneer the universe of space
