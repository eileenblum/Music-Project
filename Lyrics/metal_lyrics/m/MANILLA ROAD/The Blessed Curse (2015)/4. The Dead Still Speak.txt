Before Sumeria's kingdom was realized
A city walled with many gates
Found in northern lands of Mesopotamia
A jewel of early city states

The dead still speak out from the grave

The fires of battle came to rage upon these walls
Destroying all within its gates
Sumeria would soon emerge out of this fall
The Phoenix rises from the flames

[Chorus]
