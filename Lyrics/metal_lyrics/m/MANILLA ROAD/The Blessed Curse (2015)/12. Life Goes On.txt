I've spent a lifetime reading signs
To make the future known
To step inside the blessed light
And let the truth be told

'Cause life, yes, life must go on

And now I see the end of time
In the burning coals
Even though they deem this a crime
I have to tell the story

'Cause life, yes, life must go on

Life, life goes on
Life, life goes on

I have to hide the truth in rhyme
To save my mortal soul
Persecution comes with fire
For heretics and lords

'Cause life, yes, life must go on

[Chorus]
