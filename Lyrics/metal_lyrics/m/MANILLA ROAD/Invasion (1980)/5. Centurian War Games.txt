Time has never simplified it's always been so cruelDeep down inside our hearts we know it's all for foolsThe tribulations of this landare coarse and deep withinRaise up with all your mightuse the power we have to win For we're centurians in a game of warfighting for fortune and fameWe're the warriors of a dying racein the centurian war games The swords that gleam against the skythat's red with fires of warThe warriors they fight side by sidetill time is nevermoreLet us win our certain famein the game that ends all gamesWe will win our rival name in the centurian war games For we're centurians in a game of warfighting for fortune and fameWe're the warriors of a dying racein the centurian war games The time has never simplified it's always been so cruelAnd deep down inside our heartswe know it's all for foolsThe tribulations of this land are coarse and deep withinRaise up with all your mightuse the power we have to win For we're centurians in a game of warfighting for fortune and fameWe're the warriors of a dying racein the centurian  For we're centurians in a game of warfighting for fortune and fameWe're the warriors of a dying racein the centurian centurian centurian war games
