The Streets are crowded, Tonight out for bloodMy car's ignited, and I've got rubber to burnMy Stereo, is cranked to the maxOh Rock and Roll (Heavy metal) I've got all the hottest stacks 'cuz I'm a street jammer,Street JammerStreet JammerI'm a Street Jammer Its 12 o'clock, the engines they whine12 hundred strong, in the dead of the nightThe moon is bright, I'm bit too highI'm gonna jam up the streetbefore this night is out 'cuz I'm a street jammer,I'm a street JammerStreet Jammer The Streets are crowded, Tonight I'm out for bloodMy car's ignited, and I've got rubber to burnMy Stereo, is cranked to the maxOh Rock and Roll (Heavy metal) I've got the hottest stacks 'cuz I'm a street jammer,Street JammerStreet Jammer I'm a street jammer
