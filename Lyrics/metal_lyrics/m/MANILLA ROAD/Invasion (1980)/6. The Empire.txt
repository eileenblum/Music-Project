The crystal evolves the light of time
The sword of Asrah, power of fire
For life we fight till the end of time
For destiny leads us to build our empire

Master of energy Nardia we hail
For Manillan lords Ice Spirit shall sail
For the empire we shall not fail
The cycle complete order shall prevail

In search of peace
In search of freedom
The cycle complete
The city Manilla

The empire in dormant lace
The magikal mysteries of the ordonian age
The plague of man verses sword of fire
The plotted destruction of the Manillan Empire

Electrical impulse, fire and knowledge
Unite together the gladiator arises
The golden death of demonic domain
Manilla free the empire rises again

In quest of peace
In search of freedom
The cycle complete
The city Manilla

The crystal evolves the light of time
The sword of Asrah, power of fire
For life we fight till the end of time
For destiny leads us to build our empire
