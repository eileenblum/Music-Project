The rats are in the cellar
The mice are in the cage
The cat is in the toilet
And the dog's got the mange
The up is now the down
The front is now the back
We've got it all so turned around
That I can't keep track

That's the way the story goes
They say it's all so clear
What is real nobody knows
They have all drowned in fear
They're drowning

The lions are roaring
The wolves they howl
The old men are snoring
And the cops they just cop out
Our diamonds are rusty
Our gold is no good
Our minds are so dusty
Nothings understood

That's the way the story goes
They say it's all so clear
What is real nobody knows
We have all drowned in fear
Ah damn it I'm drowning

The rats are in the cellar
The mice are in the cage
The cat is in the toilet
And my fucking dog he's got the mange
The up is now the down
The front is now the back
We've got it all so turned around
That I can't keep track
It's a cat and mouse
