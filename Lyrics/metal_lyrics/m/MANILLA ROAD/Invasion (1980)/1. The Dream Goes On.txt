Come on baby, let's have some funYou don't know it, but you're the oneFeeling right now, I'm in my primeAin't gonna die now, I'm doin fine Don't you see, it's all for meFor our lives upon this stage'cuz the dream goes on Ain't no reason, for you to sayYou've got to stop your, musical ways Ain't no way girl, I'm gonna stop today'Cause you should know that, I've come to play Don't you see, it's all for meFor our lives upon this stage'cuz the dream goes on and on and onand on and on and on Come on baby, let's have some funYou don't know it, but you're the oneAin't no reason, for your to sayYou've got to stop your, your musical ways Don't you see, it's all for meFor our lives upon this stage'cuz the dream goes on and on and onand on and on and on the dream goes on and on and on the dream goes on
