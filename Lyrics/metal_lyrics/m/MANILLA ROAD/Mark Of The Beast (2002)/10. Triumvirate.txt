Wasted away
Through both night and day
I was living in a fantasy
Totally lost
Without a cause
But now I'm back to reality

First there were two
Then the infamous three
The master plan is now complete
Metal winds
Are with us again
We found our destiny

Triumvirate
Just the three of us
Against the world
Dust to dust
The Triumvirate
Will live on forever

You don't care
Destroy your mind
Go to war
Genocide

We sailed the river Styx
In our prime
Journeyed north
The mirrors of time
The powerhouse
Lets loose their might\

Wasted away
Through both night and day
I was living in a fantasy
Totally lost
Without a cause
But now we've found our destiny

Triumvirate
Just the three of us
Against the world
Dust to dust
The Triumvirate
Will live on forever
It's not the end

Triumvirate
Just the three of us
Against the world
Dust to dust
The Triumvirate
Will live on forever

Tiumvirate
Just the three of us
Against the world

With fire or fury
We sing the song
We've seen the dreams 
Of Eschaton
