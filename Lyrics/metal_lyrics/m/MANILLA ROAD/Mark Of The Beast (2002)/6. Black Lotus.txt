The time is right
This very night
To smite the horde
With fire and sword
I have found the man
Who can fight the damned
Wit the power pure
No hell can endure

With darkness soon
And the rising moon
He will see
All the lotus dreams
Lady of the light
Show this amn tonight
What it's like to feel 
The dreams become so real

Help me please
I'm on my knees
The lotus freeze
Has got a hold on me

The time is right
This very night
To smite the horde
Wtih fire and sword

Help me please
I'm on my knees
The lotus freeze
Has got a hold on me

Help me please
I'm on my knees
The lotus freeze
Has got a hold on me
