I'm a warrior
A Centurion
I've traveled oh so far

The mist of glory
Clings to me
My guide a shining star

I've stripped my soul
Of fear and hate
I've fought the lords of war

I will search until
I meet my fate
In the quest of Avatar

The sentinels of Darksied
Are hunting for my heart
They will never defeat me
I shall find the Avatar

My lonely life is filled with blood
I've fought my wars and won
The final wave won't bring me down
My kingdom is to come

We're waiting
Avatar we are here
For your saving

The powers of the universe
Controlme, as it seems
The life that I have held so dear
Means nothing to me now

Jupiter with all his might
I've worshiped from afar
The star above it shines so bright
I've found the Avatar

A god
Reincarnate
This world
Will live its fate
I tried
To stop the holy flood
I died
Spilling Darksied's blood

Avatar I've seen the truth
I give my life to you
Avatar it's all insane
All the war and all the pain
