The sciences have brought us to this
A world filled with the damned
A last cold kiss
The radiation contaminated our brains
It seems, it seems to fight
Is all in vain

In this time of disbelief
We've learned to cry
For death to take us away
From this horrible lie
We dream of long ago
And the hole in the sky
With darkness, darkness and cold
We're trapped in time
In a time trap

The sciences have brought us to this
A world of damnation
A cold last kiss
We dream of long ago
And a hole in the sky
With darkness, darkness and cold
We're trapped in time
In a time trap

The darkness prevails
The light goes on
But my eyes they don't see

For now I'm trapped
In time my love
I don't think I'll break away

I can't give any more life myself
I can't live for only life itself
I'm in a time trap
