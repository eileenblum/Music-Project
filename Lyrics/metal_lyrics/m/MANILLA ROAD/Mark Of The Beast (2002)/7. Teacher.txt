Running through the wastelands of time
I've seen the essence above
A teacher that committed no crime
Who saved us with his own blood

Why don't you believe?
In the god and the man
Is it more than you can perceive?
We're facing Eschaton

What can we tell them?
What do I say?
Except here
Here I am
Forever
In your hands
The Teacher

Wasting away the rest of your life
Drowning in women and wine
Can't you see you're killing time?
You've got to lay it down on the line

Won't you help me believe?
In the good lord above
The answer just came to me
I know it's got to be love

What can we tell them?
What do I say?
Except here
Here I am
Forever
In your hands

Here I am
For the rest of time
In a burning sea

Here I am
I speak no lies
You can blieve in me

No use in burning
I know you're yearning
To be free
I'm a teacher
I've got to believe

What can we tell them?
What can I say?
Except here 
Here I am
Forever

Here I am
Forever

Here I am
Forever

Here I am
Forever
In your hands

In your hands
