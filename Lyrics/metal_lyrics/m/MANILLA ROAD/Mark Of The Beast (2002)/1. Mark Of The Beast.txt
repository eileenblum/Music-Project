I've run away almost all my life
I won't run away anymore
The dreams I have they show me now
I must stand and fight this war

The beast he lurches forth
To tear apart my soul
I find myself in wonderment
Looking to the stars

What did I do so wrong?
Was it me this time?
I thought that I was strong
By now I'm crying 
In a sea of tears
I'm fighting the mark of the beast

For five years now I've made my way
All around the world
No one knows what I've been through
Satan's wings unfurled

I stand here waiting patiently
I know the time has come
I must now face Darksied
I shall overcome

What did I do so wrong?
Was it me this time?
I thought that I was strong
By now I'm crying 
In a sea of tears
I'm fighting the mark of the beast

The reaper he id here for me
He brings the murk of hell
I know now it's my soul he wants
And that I will not sell

Radiant majesties of light
Prepare thyselves my way
My powers I will give to you
To save me on this day

What did I do so wrong?
Was it me this time?
I thought that I was strong
By now I'm crying 
In a sea of tears
I'm fighting the mark of the beast
