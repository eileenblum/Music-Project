The earth she quakes
As she masturbates
All for the love of life
Can't we win?
Death immortal sin
No what can I say
It's all too late
To run away
All we do is play
God to our own
Our brothers our sons
They slip away
Through the light of day
I can't seem to stop it anymore
With dissidence and decadence
We make our wars and kill our friends

I'm powermad
Love my Cadillac
Money's all I know
All that I dream
Of in the night
Is my love of light
Darkness is the key
To the mind
We live a lie
So I thiink I'll cry
And laugh all the way
To the bank
To get my check
Monetary flak
I can't seem to stop my life of decay
I sold my soul for Metal Rock
And now I live my days of Aftershock

I'm powermad
I love my Cadillac
Money's all I know
All that I dream
Of in the night
Is my love of light
Darkness is the key
To the mind
We live a lie
So I think I'll cry
And laugh all the way
To the bank
To get my check
Monetary flak
I can't seem to stop my life of decay
I sold my soul for Metal Rock
And now I live my days of Aftershock
Aftershock
