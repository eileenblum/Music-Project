The sprit of the ice
Will lead us through this fight for life
Manilla shall be free
From the clone of war they call The Priest

We pray we do not fall
And waste our lives for no avail
The Crystal leads our way
We will live through the second doomsday

Who do you see?
The power of fire in me
I have to use it
I won't abuse it
We must set Manilla free

The emerald towers rise
I seems as though they touch the sky
The Golden bridge of Zor
Sapphire heat that melts the cold

In the court I see 
The mighty clone they call The Priest
The battle rages on
In the Court of Avalon

Who do you see?
The power of fire in me
I have to use it
I won't abuse it
We must set Manilla free

We'll carry on
We've got to fight for the son
All my feelings
They send me reeling
Through the Court of Avalon

I knew the time would come
When final justice would be done
The freedom fighters few
Gone trough hell all for you

The city free at last
We've finally shed our turmoiled past
Ice Spirit she sails on
We won the war in the Court of Avalon

Who do you see?
The power of fire in me
I have to use it
I won't abuse it
We must set Manilla free

We'll carry on 
We've got to fihgt for the son
All my feelings
Send me reeling
Through the Court of Avalon
