Odin's ravens soar again
Across the planes
The eyes and ears 
Of Valhalla

Huginn and Muninn by name
Fly o'er the plains
Thought and memory
of the all-father

Oh their eyes see
Fires of Midgard
As they cross
The rainbow bridge

Oh theirs ears bleed
From screams of war
Deathly magik
Come from the abyss

O'er the bridge black wings doth sail
Bringing the tale
Of blasphemy
And resurrection

To the hall where Wotan hails
Singing the tale
Of Midgards
Death and decimation

Oh their eyes see
Fires of Midgard
As they cross 
The rainbow bridge

Oh their ears bleed
From screams of war
Deathly magik
Come from the abyss
