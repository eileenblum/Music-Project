'Tis the ancient spell of calling
The enchantress casts this night
'Tis the time of midgard's falling
As the old ones come alive

Resurrection through the eye - of the sea
As Cthulu comes alive - Midgard bleeds

Necromantic spell of binding
Sealed with blood of sacrifice
See the dream of Atland dying
Through the witches' bloody rites
