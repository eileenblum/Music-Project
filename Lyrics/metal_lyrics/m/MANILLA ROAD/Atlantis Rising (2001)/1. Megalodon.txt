From the depths of the ocean
Prehistoric - monstrous distortion
From the depths of creation
Comes the hunter - death's incarnation
Birth of the Gods, first of the Titans
Mastered by no-one, before Poseidon
From the depths of inception
Comes the monster - lost from redemption

Ancient king of tides
Killer instinct in his eyes

'Tis the deep desolation 
Dark aquaticx - life's domination
'Tis the thirst for consumption
Comes the creature - bloody seduction
Abomination. life's decimation
Hells' own creation, beast of damnation
'Tis the wake of destruction
Feeding frenzy - god of disruption

Ancient king of tides
Killer instinct in his eyes

Feel the urge for the blood feast
Murderous nature - nature of the beast
Feel the wrath of seven seas
Catclysmic - Fate of the deep-freeze
Cycles comletion, doomed to extinction
Ancient creations, cold termination
Ther will never again be
Such a killer - a shark so deadly
