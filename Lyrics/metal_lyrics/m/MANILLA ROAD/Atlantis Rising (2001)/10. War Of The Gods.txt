Summoning the power of his spear
ALLfather opens the gates
To the temple of Poseidon's tears
Where Triton's slayer waits

As the thunder god brings down the storm
Fighting at his father's side
Poseidon returns to Atland's shores
To avenge his son's demise

Holy gods defy the beast of fear
Now the old one's magik fades
Conjuring their spells the Norns appear
Banishment Cthulu's fate

As the thunder god brings down the storm
Odin's magik fills the night
Poseidon returns to Atland's shores
To open the sacred eye

As the Norns pronounce the fate of war
Cthulu cast through the eye
By Odin's command the mighty Thor
Does remold Midgard back to life
