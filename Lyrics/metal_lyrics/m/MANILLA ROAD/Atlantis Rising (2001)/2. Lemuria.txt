Beneath the rolling waves
Inside the coral caves
I lay before the altar stone
To pray for what we once had knwon
From the deluge we did escape
We now live in Poseidon's wake - wake
The wake of Poseidon's rage

I've made the sacrifice
The spell has been cast thrice
What ahve we longed for all these years
Before the world shall soon appear
The elder gods have come to free
Lemuria
