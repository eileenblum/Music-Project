Few are left that believe 
In the lost land of mystery
And the tyrant king
Who drowned the lands is just a dream

Through the eye of the sea
A world of change doth come to be
Through Atlantis' key
The truth is now revealed to thee

Triton's re-birth from Lemuria's tears
Magikal lightning is striking
After the deluge hidden in all these years
Once more Atlantis is rising

For the holy war child
Enguled cathedral's bells still chime
Crystal pyramid's light
Again bestowed upon the night

Blessed mountains doth rise
The ocean parts before thine eyes
Born again of the tides
The gods of Atland are alive

Triton's re-birth from Lemuria's tears
Magikal lightning is striking
After the deluge hidden in all these years
Once more Atlantis is rising
