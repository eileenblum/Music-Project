Attack
Don't look back
Atland must soon be set free

Armies clash
Sons of the night lead the siege and
Attack
Lightning cracks
Torching the flesh that's diseased

Don't hold back
Hack and slash all that you see and
Attack

Aesir warriors come from asgard
To fight Cthulu's demon horde
Odin's army of warrior bards
Led by his son the mighty Thor

Cthulu's dark knights doth make their last stand
Valhalla's warriors lay siege to Atland

Battle rages on for Midgard
Upon the rings of Atland's shores
Blood and guts spill o'er the ramparts
The Valkyries this night doth soar

Cthulu's dark knights doth make their last stand
Valhalla's warriors lay siege to Atland
the minions die beneath the swords of the brave
Sons of the night besiege Atland shall be saved
