Out of the eye of the sea	
Bringing his demon army
Elder god of blasphemy

Devouring the witch of the sea
Breaking the spell of binding
Death to Atlantis' queen

Dark winged minions of hell
Brought forth to poison the well
Silencing Poseidon's bells

Armies of Atland are felled
Trition defending the well
Falls to Cthulu's black spell

Scorching the earth
Taking of life
Turning it into disease
Unholy birth
Nature defiled
Mankind is brought to its kness
Now Midgard bleeds
Cthulu's eyes
Face of annihilation
Return of the old one
The god of decimation
