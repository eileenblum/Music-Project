Hear the bells toll for Atland
Celebration of the chimes
Rising up from the drowned lands
The king has brought forth new life

From the mists of the ocean
Beauty born of the crypt
Claiming kingly devotion
Evil's spawn the sea witch

Fatal beauty conspires
To usurp the throne of the king
For Cthulu shall rise
When the witch casts her spells to the the sea

Hear the queen of deception
Spread her lies to all ears
Through her dark incantations
The old ones shall appear

Comes the old ones' avenger
Bringing death to the king
For Cthulu shall rise
When the witch casts her spells to the sea
