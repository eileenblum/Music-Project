Graceful and silent 
Valley of dreams
Marred by war's violence
And deathly screams

Machines of metal
Put to the test
Now no survival
In The Valley Of Unrest

Blood-bath of slaughter
Come to this place
The Devil's daughter
Now shows her face

To all the humans
Part of this quest
No light of wisdom
In The Valley Of Unrest

Smell of flesh burning
Death in the air
Phantoms are stirring
Mortals beware

Murder and torture
War at it's best
Life has no future
In The Valley Of Unrest
