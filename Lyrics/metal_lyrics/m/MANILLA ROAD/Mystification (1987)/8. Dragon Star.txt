Night sky turned into fire
Like Saxon funeral pyres
Melting away the ice
With heat from solar light

To William and his horde
This omen was The Word
Victorius he would be
Against all Saxony

[CHORUS]

Through solar winds
The comet lives
Bringer of war
Torch of The Gods
The Dragon Star

Throughout our destiny
This star has been the key
To wars both lost and won
And birth of Christendom

Too late we find the truth
That's lost within our youth
The way of Gods and men
Have strayed apart again

[CHORUS]

Alexander
Born of The Star
MOrtal of God
Who cut the Gordian Knot

Bring back the faith
It's not too late
To turn the tides
From genocide

[CHORUS]

A message from The Gods
The Cycle carries on
Life passes to be born
In yet a higher form

This is the way of life
As day must turn to night
The Star shall fade away
As we must all one day

[CHORUS]
