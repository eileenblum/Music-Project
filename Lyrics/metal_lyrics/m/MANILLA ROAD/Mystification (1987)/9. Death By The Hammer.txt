Through frost and fire
The Vikings came
Dealers of death
In Odin's name

Barbaric lust
Born of the soul
One way to crush
All of thy foes

Death By The Hammer

God Of Thunder
Thor be thy name
Son of Odin
Breaker of chains

Valkyries fly
The Hammer falls
On every plane
Ragnarok calls

Death By The Hammer

Valhalla's fires
Burn through the night
Einherjer
Storm to the fight

The funeral pyres
In Nifleheim
The Demon'?s lair
Ichor burns bright

Death By The Hammer
