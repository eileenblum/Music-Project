Disciples of Hell
Mortus in flesh
Corpses that kill
Living off death

With this crimson
Sacrifice
All the dead
Shall live and rise
Up From The Crypt

Contorted limbs
Tis blood they crave
The Rite begins
Amongst the graves

With this human
Sacrifice
All the dead
Shall live and rise
Up From The Crypt

Demons Gate
Opened Wide
Nightmares Fate
Lives to die

Mortified
Flesh from Hell
Comes to life
For the kill

Red mist and gore
Cover the earth
Virgin flesh torn
Death given birth

With this infant
Sacrifice
All the dead
Shall live and rise
Up From The Crypt
