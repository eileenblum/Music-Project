A fair and stately palace
Gone mad within itself
No life around the forest
Circling the monarch's realm

The curse of generations
Upon the Usher clan
Turned life to desolation
Laid waste to fruitful land

Haunted Palace

Sacrificial blood stains
The family born to fall
Never to break evil's chains
Brought forth by ancient call

Distortion of the senses 
Damnation of the soul
The palace of the breathless
Where death's bell takes it's toll

Haunted Palace

Destruction of Foundations
Both of the mind and mass
Caused by incantations
Of family members past

Inner plane disturbance
Crumbling every wall
Tormented by existence
The Haunted Palace falls

Haunted Palace
