Covered by darkness of life
Searching for the holy light
Under the eye of the gods

This is where we face our fear
The blessed path is unclear
Many a brave soul will fall

Wizards of black sorcery
Hid away this magik key
Inside the bowels of the earth

Guarded by demonic knights
Talisman of astral light
Even the righteous can burn

Engraved with magikal runes
Talisman of burning truth
Power that maddens a fool

With sword and shield I shall fight
For the talisman of light
Even if it means my doom
