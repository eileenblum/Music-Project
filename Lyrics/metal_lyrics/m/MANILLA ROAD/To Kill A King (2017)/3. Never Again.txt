Is it forgotten the fear we had before
Of the atomic sword
Did we forget the lurking nevermore
Behind the silo doors

Have we embraced the fall of man
Even though we said never again
We are deep inside the lion's den
Even though we said never again

Is it forgotten the innocents that died
So many wasted lives
Did we forget that each and every night
Can bring the flash of light

Have we embraced the fall of man
Even though we said never again
We are deep inside the lion's den
Even though we said never again

Change
Or hate will see us in our graves
The future of the human race
Is in our hands for us to save
And the dreams are still inside my head
Even though we said never again
