On this isle of misery and pain
The natives sacrifice in vain
Deathly screams from Doctor Lorca's lab
Within the jungle that's gone mad

Human experiments so extreme
This beast of blood a mad doctor's dream
The search for Lorca's miracle drug
Mad science on the island of blood

Blood and gore, this beast was once a man
Mutated in the doctor's lab
Now he strikes, the monster full of rage
Nothing can kill, not even flames

Human experiments so extreme
This beast of blood a mad doctor's dream
The search for Lorca's miracle drug
Mad science on the island of blood

Blood turned green inside his veins
A mutant of genetic change

Demon eyes and misty nights
The jungle's fauna comes to life
Deadly vines across the isle
Guarding the evil here that hides

Mad doctor transplanting
Human heads
Onto the beast who defies death
Island hell, a scientist deranged
Nothing can save
You in this place

Human experiments so extreme
This beast of blood a
Mad doctor's dream
The search for Lorca's
Miracle drug
Mad science on the
Island of blood
