A dungeon of despair
To punish flesh and soul
You scream but no one cares
Castillo del Diablo

Within these walls the devil relishes pain
A science of torture so cruel
Demonic song of bloody cries so insane
Inside the castle of man's doom

Devices made of iron
Eyes melted with hot coals
Sanctioned religious fire
Castillo del Diablo
