Why listen to fools who don't have a clue
About life in these new times
Hearts so filled with hate, they think it's their fate
Under god to kill us all

Ideology of hate
Barring us from glorious days
We are living in the wake
Fantasy of gods and fate

There's so much we've lost, too great the cost
Stop the pain, it's time to change
Governments collide and innocents die
For beliefs in mythology

Ideology of hate
Barring us from glorious days
We are living in the wake
Fantasy of gods and fate

Come into the light
No more sacrifice
Chasing fairy tales
Salvation for sale

In the wake of religion

Ideology of hate
Barring us from glorious days
We are living in the wake
Fantasy of gods and fate

Embrace these new tides
Where knowledge of life
Proves once and for all
We're not ruled by god

In the wake of religion
