It was the world Roman plan
To conquer and expand
All of Germania's clans
Led by a great man would
Defiantly stand

Arminius was his name
Teutoburg Forrest the place
The ghost warriors oh so brave
Laid Romans to waste for three
Nights and three days

The ghost warriors of the night
Invisible to the eye
Three Roman Legions would die
Defeated in fight, Varus takes his own life

The empire dealt quite a blow
A message to all of Rome
We shall fight for our homes
No slave to a throne neither
Body nor soul
