The sands are stained with crimson rain
Blood flows inside the coliseum
Flesh bought and sold, the way of Rome
A slave must fight to gain his freedom

Fight or die
Fight or die
Fight or die
Fight or die

These human games bring gold and fame
The heads will roll in the arena
Just one desire, to win or die
A gladiator's way to freedom

Fight or die
Fight or die
Fight or die
Fight or die

Sacrifice to the gods
Amusement of the mob
No matter win or fall
Still death comes to us all

Blood on the sand by Rome's command
The Emperor can grant your freedom
So fight thee well, send them to hell
You are the gods of the arena

Fight or die
Fight or die
Fight or die
Fight or die
