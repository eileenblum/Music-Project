Beyond the veils negativity
Is a place that I've seen
Filled with dark haunting dreams

Voices cry out to me blasphemy
Reaching out from the flames
Am I blessed or insane

There's a void inside my mind
Like a black hole pausing time
Spirits come through

Creatures from the other side
That my thoughts have brought to life
Visions of doom

Torment or true creativity
There's no end to the game
You can drown in the pain

Is this my manifest destiny
Or a hand from beyond
Whom in death shall I haunt

There's a void inside my mind
Like a black hole pausing time
Spirits come through

Creatures from the other side
That my thoughts have brought to life
Visions or truth

There's a void inside my mind
Like a black hole pausing time
Spirits come through

Creatures from the other side
That my thoughts have brought to life
Visions or doom
