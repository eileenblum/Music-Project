Across all of Persia did come a conqueror
The one who cut the Gordian Knot
A demigod and king, the great Alexander
His strategy the world was taught

To reach beyond the mortal chains that bind us all
Was the beginning of his doom
So learn thee well the lessons from the ones who fall
As not to repeat history's truth
