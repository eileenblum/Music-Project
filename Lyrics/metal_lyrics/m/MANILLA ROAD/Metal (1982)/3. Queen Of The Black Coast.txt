Take me back, across the sea
Of Vilayet, to my queen
No kingdom hers, but for the sea
A coastal curse, a pirate's dream

Scourge of the westcoast
Hellcat of my dreams

The tigress sailed, The south so vast
The queen was hung from her own mast
From winged death she did save
My hardened soul, from the grave

Funeral pyre forever
Burning out to sea

Queen of the black coast
Watch as the heads roll
