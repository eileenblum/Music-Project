The fire in my heart is burning... out of control
And I can't seem to stop this yearning... for rock &amp; roll
I've tried to hold my feelings
But when the music starts it sends my head a-reeling

I'm out of control with rock &amp; roll
I'm out of control with rock &amp; roll

Take me through the frozen wastelands
Just take me higher and higher
So I can try and forget
This hellbent raging desire

I'm out of control with rock &amp; roll
I'm out of control with rock &amp; roll

Do it to ya
I don't know how this is happening
I don't know if this is real
I think I'm changing
I don't know how I should feel
How should I feel
In my soul
I'm out of control with rock &amp; roll
I'm out of control with rock &amp; roll

The fire in my heart is burning... out of control
And I can't seem to stop this yearning.. for rock &amp; roll
A million hells I'd suffer
Just to rock &amp; roll forever

I'm out of control with rock &amp; roll
I'm out of control with rock &amp; roll
