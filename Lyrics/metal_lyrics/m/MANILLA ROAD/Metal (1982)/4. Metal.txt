Blood of life, flowing pure
In honored grace we shall endure
Lords of war cast down on us
Nine lives before the Incubus

We praise the blood that metal brings
The essence of creative qaulity
Is life so pure we cannot seek
Our hopes, our dreams to make our fantasies reality

Chains of steel bind us here
They seem so real till death appears
In quest of fate, of love, of life
It's not to late to know the light

We praise the blood that metal brings
The essence of creative quality
Is life so pure we cannot seek
Our hopes, our dreams to make our fantasies reality

Incisioned mind, ruined for all time
In dark of night pursues the crime
But love be true even in hell
And love of life brings us metal

Blind as ever, they can't hear the bell
They will suffer for the souls they sell
Chains will never bind us to hell
To all father we rais eour swords and ride to Valhalla

Heavy..... 	METAL
METAL
