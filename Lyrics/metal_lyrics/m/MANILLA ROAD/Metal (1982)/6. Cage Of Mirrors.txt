On the crest for eternity, a bell for every day
That I've lived in silent search of the mirrored cage
I could summon Lucifer and his warriors
With the necromancer's cage of mirrors

I found the castle on the hill where is said to be
The necromancer's gate to hell, a cage of sorcery
Mirrored bars that show all the pathways through the mind
To the other side of hell where demon warriors ride...
Where demon warriors ride... Ha! Ha ! Ha!

The cage appears before my eyes, I feel I'm in a dream
To the other side of hell I cast my spell and scream
I summon Lucifer and his warriors
I... I found the cage of mirrors

With magick book I cast the spell of the trinity
To open up the gates of hell and blacken all the seas
the griffon with his eyes of blood searing through my soul
Demanding virgin sacrifice, how was I to know
How was I to know... I couldn't know...
Not ever possibly.. What did I do...
Blasphemy... Ha! Ha! Ha!

Tale me back the way I came, I don't want to see
The evil that awaits my name, I live in agony
I would send back Lucifer and his warriors
But I'm trapped in a cage of mirrors
