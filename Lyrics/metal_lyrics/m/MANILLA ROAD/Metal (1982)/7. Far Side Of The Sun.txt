The day is coming
That soon in future's time
Every single one of us
Will soon learn how to die
And if I do escape
Before that time has come
I will meet you
On the far side of the sun
Everybody is free on the far side of the sun

Oh won't you listen to me
I'm on the other side
I've got to get back home
Before I go out of my mind
It's like I'm a mirror
A mystery I can't face
It's like a dream I'm living
I've got to get back into space
Everybody is free on the far side of the sun

I'm going to journey homeward
That time has finally come
I'm going to fly back through the stars
To the far side of the sun
And now a ship approachin'
Heading straight for me
Ah Lord it's a ship like mine
Is this my destiny
Everybody is free on the far side of the sun
