Defending my planet
Is all that I do
Hostile intruders
Put there by you
A mass invasion
Coming down from the sky
I'll come back fighting
Even after I die

Defender.................Defender

Living for dying
My planet destroyed
There's too many of them
It's back to the void
Defending my planet
Is all that I do
Won't somebody play me 
One quarter will do

Defender...............Defender
