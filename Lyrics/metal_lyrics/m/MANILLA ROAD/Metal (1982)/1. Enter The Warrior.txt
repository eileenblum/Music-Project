Sword and shield
The time has come, The hammers crashing down
Ride this night, for the crown
Take thy place upon the battleground

Twilight gleaming
Thou must fight
For thy freedom
Tis the time

Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done
Is what they say to take the pain away
When will they learn that pain is truth
And God be manifested in thy youth

Twilight gleaming
Thou must fight
For thy freedom
Tis the night

Thou shallt pay for all thy sins
Hel awaits the blood is thin
Crimes of God and man and beast
If thou dost not pay, then hel shall feast on thee

So ride, my son, through the snow
If thee be true, then thou shallt feel no blow
For Gods own grace rides with you
And never underestimate the fool

Twilight gleaming
Thou must fight
For thy freedom 
Tis the night
