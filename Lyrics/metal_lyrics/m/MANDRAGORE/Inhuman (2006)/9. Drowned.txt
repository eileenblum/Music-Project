Drowned in the tears of god
Beware of his pack of wolves
Love made lust, flesh made dust
Canât escape from this rotten cross

Something grotesque
Escaping through your skin
Devouring all these moments
Let me see, let me tasteâ¦
Let me kill your desires

The lowest living form, you are
Traveling in circles like this pathetic light

Iâm drowned

Laying on a field with plagues around my hands
Dying for nothing
Iâm not the same
Iâm tired of my heartâs cry

Drowned and tired
Of this pathetic life

A stupid reflection turned lie

Something grotesque
Escaping through your skin
Devouring all these moments

Iâm drowned
