Skinned hands
touch my reality
words in a bottle
steal my conscience
smoke in my lungs
keeps me alive â¦ alive

The soil under my feet
is corrupted by your eyes
and through your eyes I see
myself drowning in my own blood

And you laugh and fly
you fade and cry
while my life is in torment

Embrace with your rage my loneliness
lick with your soul my bitterness

Fearless thoughts
crawl on my head
walls with no end
do climb to my face

The cold in my veins
makes me forgive you
and through your chest I feel
my oblivion
my oblivion!!...

And you laugh and fly
you fade and cry
while my cage is sealed

Embrace with your rage my loneliness
lick with your soul my gloom
