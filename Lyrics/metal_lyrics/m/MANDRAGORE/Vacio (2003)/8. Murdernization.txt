Brand new order of salvation
Emanates light for a new damnation
Increase disease
Society degree
The life is rotten
The roots are broken

We're scorned by a dysfunctional regime
They're new murderers
The kings of disorder

We are all copyrighted
Without senses and no autonomous mind
Steal the faith
Just bring the hate
Buy your salvation

They are new creators
Of human and insipid copies
Xeroxed souls, no heart corpses

Human race falls
In black forests burns
Be a garbage, be a worm

Don't scream, no one hears you...

Brand new order of salvation
Emanates light for a new damnation

They're new murderers
The kings of disorder
