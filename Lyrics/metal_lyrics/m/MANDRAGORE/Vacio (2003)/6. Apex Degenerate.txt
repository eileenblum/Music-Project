Generations of hate
People without love
People with broken souls
Domination of weak minds
Supremacy over the lands

Now is the angelical mourning
The sadness within the stars
The witheredness in our hearts
Self-destructive compassion

Only say
We are kings
Of our kingdom
And we will never be forgotten

Only cry
Only cry for our failed dreams
And lets dry the tears
In our hands and soil

I am your guide
Follow my advices
Don't leave me... in the cold lands
I am your faith
Your polar star
Your sun, your sacred sign

A killer of dreams called God
A warrior without emotions
He is the soul's manipulator

Child's depravator
Women consolator
Infested-obscene heart's devastator
He's the orgasmic system
That swallows your innocence

Apex degenerate

You are sentenced
By a mutant soul
An orgy of lies
A convulsed mind in the dark
A scorn of the truth
A coax for the infinite cosmos
He is the human evolution manipulator...
