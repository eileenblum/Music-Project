The skies turn red
And the eternal wars
Kill our hope
Feeling the insanity

All the life
Is rotting by the seed
Of the dark
All the love
Is dying by the greed
Of my faith

Agony lord
I bring you sorrow
Agony lord
I hate you...

IÂ´ll burn your soul
With the heat of my heart
IÂ´ll clean your fucking blood
With the tears of my eyes

All the sadness
That I have
Is for your damnation
Because you never
Will be saved
By my sick emotions

Agony lord
Your life is mine
Agony lord
I hate you...

I cried for you
I believe in you
I think in you
I pray for you
I need your soul
