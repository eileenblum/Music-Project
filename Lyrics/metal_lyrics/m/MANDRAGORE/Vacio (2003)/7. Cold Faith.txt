Winter is coming
One future is rising

Sounds surviving
Making survivors

Survivors are writing
A history of pain
A history of madness
A history of courage
One history full of rage

Rage is no more part of a sickness
But part of a faith
And faith without violence
Is not a truth faith...

Violence in life is as necessary
As freeze wind on winter...
As fire in hell..

Let rage be part of your history...
And let violence be part of your life...

Faith without pain
Is not a truth faith...

And faith without violence is not longer a faith...

...Just breath the winter's cold air...
