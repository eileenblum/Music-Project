Everything seems bad to me
In my point of view.
Only one place I can flee
And no one can pursue!
Every night I close my eyes
Longing to be free.
Turn away of all their lies
In my reality!

Inside my dream, I forget my sorrow of today
Inside my dream, I spread my wings and fly away

All my wishes are coming true
Just a simple wave:
In one second all is new,
Wonderful and safe!
But I can no longer stay,
I see the morning light.
I'm creeping through another day,
Waiting for the night!

Every night I close my eyes
Longing to be free.
Turn away of all their lies
In my reality!
Something's gonna strange tonight
In this guarded place!
I'm inside a nightmare fright
On a one-way trace!

Inside my dream, I think I am no longer free...
Inside my dream, I'm poisoned for eternity.
