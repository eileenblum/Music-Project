Morning sun, rising high, spreading the first light.
Coldness rules, darkness reigns, kingdom of the night.
Life awakes, weak and frail, and spring flowers grow
During night, winter comes, all's dying in the snow.

Condemned memories awake and
Wander through the nocturnal solitude
They engulf me! Captivate me!

Naught awakes, inside my heart, the sun does not shine.
And I know, eternally, I stay in the winter time.
In my life, there's no sun, spreading the first light,
I remain, frightened in the kingdom of the night!

Now the memories have taken him
Again to their kingdom of the night
