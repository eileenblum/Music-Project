Staring in your face I see the pain
I feel the loneliness once again.
I've taken the love away without a word,
I've taken the dreams away
And now it's cold... in my heart!

I hear your trembling voice but don't conceive,
Your words are hurting me you want to leave.
I've taken the trust away but I regret,
I've taken our lives away
But listen close... to your heart!

Tears on my face are flowing to the sea.
Time does not change but one day I will see.
Tears on my face forever changing me!

Staring in your face I see a light,
I fear the loneliness of the night.
I never will turn away from our dream,
Forever I go the way
With all the might... of my heart!
