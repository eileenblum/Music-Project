All my thoughts were turning
As he spoke to me:
"Soon you have to die!"
Though I've heard it clearly,
I couldn't understand
And I will deny!

Why do you choose me?
Nothing I've done wrong
Grant me Lord, o please!
Take another man
Please don't punish me
Save me from disease!

You've betrayed me in my life
Now I fight alone to stay alive!

Why am I alone?
Where are all my friends?
No one here to grieve!
Now the end is near
I don't want to die!
All my strength does leave!

You've lost your fight like every mortal man
Instead of fear you should have lived!
