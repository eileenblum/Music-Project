Love is lost in my mind
Emptiness is left behind!

Your beauty and sweetness
Seem like an endless dream to me!
Belonging together:
The love will last eternally!

The promise of eternity
Is broken by the casualty!

I cry out my sorrow,
My broken heart will turn to frost!
The promise is broken;
Your likeness in my head is lost!

Keep the love deep inside
Every death creates new light!
