Take a listen the sound that's forever
Lasting glance how my head is dancing
'round my own sense of reason
A trivial Virtue left to season
You changed my fate
Twist the words that I cling to
Points of me
Turned to points of you
Treated like shit treated by you
Cut the hole in my chest
So true
I find you so kind
Take a listen the sounds that's forever
Tearing, cold soul declaring
My virtue now has seasoned
Aligned with my angels my demons
I changed my fate
You can try but never fail
