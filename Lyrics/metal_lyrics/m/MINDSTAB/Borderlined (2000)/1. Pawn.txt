Pale, expance of skin
Flesh bruised and scabbed with blood
Round the circling arms
Crossed upon a clear black sun
Framed, the face looked up
Punctured and rid of past
Back to the point
Where the hour came round last
Cut it all away
Take my hate back
Slow, dragged and beat
Purged with earth and mud
Calm the twisting mind
Inside, lined to start
Leave a smearlike stain
Tumbled thoughts back to front
Ragged mouth leaning open
Until all is done
