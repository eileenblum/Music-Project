Room 5a2
What does it mean to you
Rejected
Welcome, take a look
One pair, one hook
Living on a leash
The perfect way to conceal this
And I trusted you with my life
Within one night
You gave it all away, this way
I am all
I am your downfall
Cold grey womb
The liquid keeps the wound shut
Dark the bright
The perfect way to blur the light
No more
And
Back like once before
The backdoor
