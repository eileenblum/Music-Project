For years this inside
Is wearing me down
A place with no feeling
With no sound
How could you
Bereave me
I guess I deserve it
Remaining alive
Makes it so hard
But it's all that I want
Faced with my conscience
Sad willing sin
Live the expression
Let bliss carve in skin
How could I believe this
I long the darkness
Though we now are years apart
Things just keep on getting worse
Can't take it no more
You stay in my mind that's so scarred
You will always make me
Hurt
