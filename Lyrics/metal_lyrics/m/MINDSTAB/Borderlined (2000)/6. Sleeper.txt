Please the sin
Feed the soilbed
I nail me in
Can't pace the day away
Choke me stay the night sane
Raped by pulse in the brain
Cold cover to shed
Stay of this sanctuary bed
Leave asleep
So vain in dreams
It wheels me in
I close just the same
New place sold with solitude
Life through times in overdue
Dawn face pitchblack
Another way to hook me back
The way I came
Am there to sore
I cannot wake
Me and I at war
Turn the night to day
Like the night before
You're all mine
