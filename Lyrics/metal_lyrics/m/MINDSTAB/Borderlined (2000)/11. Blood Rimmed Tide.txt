My eyes tear the world
Of its Sandskin
Seeing the shores collapsing
Reaching, pulling me, dragging me
Playing a part in our ceremony
Show me, so I don't care
Show me and let me hear
Your voice can't bring me down
I beg please let me drown
Standing alongside the salvation
Casting a drift deprevation
So shall I feed on death
That feeds on me
And death once dead
Will have set me free
Twisting and turning, the ocean within
Consuming life, eats everything
Things fall in place
The center can't hold
The blod rimmed tide
Swallows me whole
