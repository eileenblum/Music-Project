Sometimes I feel so far away, other times I think I need a change today.
Unwanted feelings of despair inside.
All I want is a place to hide, away from the reality of this mindless life.
I woke up this morning, spent the night in the trenches again.
The first thing I do is grab my gun, helps me cope and gives me my ident.
Lost control of our need, lost control of our greed.
Beaten down, kept in line, lies so pure.
How much truth can you take?
Stand real close to me and do just like I do.
Open your mind pull the trigger back far.
Pull it at the point when you feel the most pain or feel the most fucking alive.
What's left for me, what's left to live for as your mind's floating around in space?
Silently praying for closure within the day's last space.
Just look at the state we're in. Religions at war, DNA compression.
Confusion, diffusion, pollution.
Mind will be deprived of every substance, nourishment and die.
Guess it's not so hard to say goodbye after all. You always had to lie, always have to cry.
The search is what makes me need to go. All your pain I know.
Guess it's not so hard to say goodbye after all. You always had to lie, always have to cry.
The search is what makes me need to go. All your pain I know... all too well.
Lost control of our need, lost control of our greed.
Beaten down, kept in line, lies so pure.
How much truth...
Cutting and draining, shooting and maiming.
It's hard to say goodbye but have you ever tried?
Have you ever tried?
Have you ever tried?
Have you ever fucking tried?
HAVE YOU?!
So you call yourself alive, with your petty-ass crimes.
You're running on a blind death trip.
With a wish you carry inside. Hoping upon what you find.
Just look at the state we're in. Religions at war, DNA compression.
Confusion, delusion, substitution.
Mind will be deprived of every substance, nourishment and die.
