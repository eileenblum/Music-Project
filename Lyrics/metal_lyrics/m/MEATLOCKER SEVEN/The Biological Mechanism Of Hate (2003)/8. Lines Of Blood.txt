Like a mad disease.
Lifeless eyes, how can you see life's greatest loss?
Now begins reality.
Down a path that should never be.
Tell me what you feel. Tell me how you find. Tell me how you see.
People here know what I mean.
Not getting treated like a human being.
I tried so hard to hate you but it just makes things worse in the end.
Lost in the darkness.
Between the two worlds.
Breathe new life into your breathless lungs.
Tell me what you feel. Tell me how you find.
Like a mad disease, lifeless eyes how can you see?
You've taken something I can't replace. I want to see it rolling down your fucking face.
Where there's a will, there's a way.
Holding back the torment inside of me.
Now's the time to face my fucking mind. Exhume those feelings buried deep inside.
Like a mad disease. Lifeless eyes how can you see?
Like a mad disease. Lifeless eyes how can you see?
