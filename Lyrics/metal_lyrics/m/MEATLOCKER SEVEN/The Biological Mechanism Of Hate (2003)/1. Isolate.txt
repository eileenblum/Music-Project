Never again.
My tired eyes have seen enough of all your lies, my hate is blind.
There won't be another day.
Silenced forever, the walls are closing (in around me).
An individual with choices to make.
You are not.
You merely play into my hands, the web I weave, I twist you in like a fly.
You no longer think, you no longer feel, you no longer know life.
Staring back I find myself alone.
Despise the skin that I own.
Fixated on past encounters as I sift through the ashes of who I used to be.
Conflict, driven, prince of rebellion.
Conflict, driven, prince of rebellion.
Isolate.
