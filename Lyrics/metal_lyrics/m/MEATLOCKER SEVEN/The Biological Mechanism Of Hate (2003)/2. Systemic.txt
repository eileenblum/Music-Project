Take me and bend them far beneath.
No useless method will allow me the freedom of life.
Allow me the freedom of my life.
Take you and bend them far beneath.
You'll suffer in the wake of my own selfish, useless parade.
In the wake of my own selfish parade.
Relationships of systemic nature - one application and the damage is done.
Now I see poison rain it falls. Dying to breathe, soil it calls.
For me to meet face to face. Reminds me now, I'm mindless waste.
Relationships of systemic nature - one application and the damage is done.
Take us and bend them far beneath. Imagine every living thing with no heart, no words at all.
At all.

[lead: Mike]

So I'm still here frame by frame, words will tear us apart but only my name.
I passed on long before you looked. Now no one else can see me.
Systemic.
