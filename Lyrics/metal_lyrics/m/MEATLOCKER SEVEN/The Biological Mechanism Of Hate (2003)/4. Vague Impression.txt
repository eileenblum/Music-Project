Retreat to myself, blind to what's become (ya it stains me).
I'll bring it out, reinvent purity, create my found self (and show it unto you).
Finding faith is the greatest feat, while beginning anew (and holding this narrow, tight view).
Displaced by society, molded by lies, we choose this life to defend.
Cathartic release cleanses and defines my concentration 'till the end.
Feel immersed somewhere below in a place I do not know.
So ignore what others say, knowing this will pave the way...
For me, myself and I...
For you and fucking you...
Me.
Surround myself with emotions and ideas.
Originality the key.
Searching through my mind for meaning.
Closing my eyes to see.

[lead: Mike]

Scraped from the verbal surface.
Never what you want it to be.
Open up to see the future.
Ya, I'll surely try.
To reach out to you...
To reach out to you...
To reach out to you.
