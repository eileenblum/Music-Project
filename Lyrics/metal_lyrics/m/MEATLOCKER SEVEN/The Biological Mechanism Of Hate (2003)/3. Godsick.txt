Got no faith. Got no hope. Spiritual rape. So godsick.
Eats away at your brain. Flood of guilt, it truly hurts.
This disease will rot your soul. Fucking buried in the earth.
Blame the sheep for your (sins).
Your mind is turned against itself. Disease becomes about your wealth.
Give, take, take, take.
Your god is a fake.
Lost in the pain.
Greed becomes the thorn in your side.
Your flesh is their bread.
Your blood is their wine.
