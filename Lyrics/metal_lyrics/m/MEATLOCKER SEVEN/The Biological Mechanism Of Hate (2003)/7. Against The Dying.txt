It takes only one thought to bring millions to their knees.
Imperfections hard to find depending on the source of the light.
So it comes as no surprise it's as if they just belong.
Wish someone could tell me why absent-minded numbness survives.
We'll all go down in sacrifice and you'll be screaming amongst the cries.
You have to step outside to see what's going on.
Can't hide in your shadow inside.
No stem knows what's right or wrong when it's shaped with no light.
Completely feeling deceived with so much less than everyone.
While we've been here all along, you've got to do what you've gotta do.
Completely feeling deceived, with so much less than everyone.
While we've been here all along, I've got to do what I've gotta do.
There but for the grace of god. Who cares if you can't see me.
Deep inside you know it's true. How long have you been waiting to be set free?
You've got to step outside to see what's going on.
Can't hide in your shadow inside.
No stem knows what's right or wrong, when it's shaped with no light.
So fucking sick with it.
You hardly recognize your own life anymore.
I see the flames in your eyes.
I see the flames in your eyes
