Taken all your life from us.
Enchanted by his sentimental sway.
Stranglehold that is sure to crush.
Regression built my mentality.
(Go to god, he's your savior... no.)
Inside the crushing down I felt.
No regrets for how you feel.
Try to break my ability.
There's fucking nothing left to bleed.

Trust me I know. It's the last thing you want.
No, I won't follow.
You'll hate yourself for my misery. Never look back on what you've given me.
You'll hate yourself for my misery. Never look back on what you've given me.
You'll hate your fucking self all your life.
Fall in denial, I break what's mine.
Suffocate, hate, stronger than life.
Sterilized, burned, redefined.
There's a fucking path that's on my mind.
I won't follow, fucking
