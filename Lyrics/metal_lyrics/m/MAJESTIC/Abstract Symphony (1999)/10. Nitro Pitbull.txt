[Andersson / Espinozza]

Oh Yeah!...In for the kill!
Alone in the night with pictures of home
Ride through the valley, I'm running, I'm stoned
High sound of engine the heat from the pipes
I am dying

One hundred eighty-five speed is on top
My race is my own no intention to stop
The back seat of distance I run for the kill
I am dying

This is the life in overdrive
Move in for the kill
My Nitro Pitbull's running warm
Ride into the night

Still running warm the wind's in my hair
Nothing to fear 'cause I'm flying, I'm dead
Gimme just gimme one level to go
I am dying

Pushing this monster through edges of hell
Deep down inside I feel this is my spell
Can feel the power from darkness and lightning
I'm dying

This is the life in overdrive
Move in for the kill
My Nitro Pitbull's running warm
Ride into the night
