[Andersson / Espinoza]

Before the curtains of the
judgement day was here
I, now will tell you all the tales
from hell and darkness
Lightning has no end

The fear of Lucifer
has brought this simple game
In to the place were ice
turns into flames my enemy
From seventh sky...

I'm on my way to golden sea
All the love shall burn
During mention of this war

They can't resist
there's nothing they can do to me
Inside this silent wind
I must remain inside
The sky of golden sea
golden sea

I'm on my way to golden sea
All the love shall burn
During mention of this war

To a place of destiny
Into flames my enemy

Inside
Inside the purple sky
On my way to golden sea
All the love shall burn
During mention of this war

I'm on my way to golden sea
All the love shall burn
During mention of this war

My war...my war...
