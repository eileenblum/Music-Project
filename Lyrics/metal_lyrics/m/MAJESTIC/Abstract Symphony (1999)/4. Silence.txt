[Andersson / Espinoza]

My head is turning me
With the force from the killing hand
Doesn't leave, nothing is heavenly

Don't know, you know

I'm losing everything
for the first time I'm out of love
Left behind shivering destiny

Mystery sadness
I'm giving my soul back to
You never know it's too late

My head is now
So weak I'm dying
You'll see the saints of hell
Are here I'm crying

You -

Light fuse and get away
To the place where you once belong
Bleeding tears is right in my fantasy

Mystery sadness
I'm giving my soul back to
You never know it's too late

My head is now
So weak I'm dying
You'll see the saints of hell
Are here I'm crying

Oh! Don't you know that I'm losing my mind?
Oh! Baby tear is running

You never know when it's too late
Never know when you're running away

Don't you see the saints of hell are here I'm crying?
Don't you see the saints of hell?
