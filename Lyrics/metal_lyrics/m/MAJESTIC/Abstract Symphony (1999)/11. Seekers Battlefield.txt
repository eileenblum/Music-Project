[Andersson]

I'm moving fast like a hurricane
Into the night I'm the bringer of your evil
Searching for freedom I'd known before
No one to blame, I'm the seeker of the night-time

Sailing on seas once again
Crossing my spirits of love
Oceans on wings forever flying

Even when you're gone...
Now you're gone

I spread my seed through the naked wind
I'm rolling stones, pushing people trough the daylights
My head is aching my mind is stressed
I'm in the land of the never-ending sorrow

Gather their souls far away
Seeds of my war growing strong
Angels of hell is in my veins

Even when you're gone...
Now you're gone...
