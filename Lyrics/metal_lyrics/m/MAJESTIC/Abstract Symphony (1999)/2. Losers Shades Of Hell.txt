[Andersson / Espinoza]

I'm racing from this power
Yesterday is gone
Love the way you feel the pain

Your face is filled with shadows
from this nasty war
Every breath is emptiness

Mercy is...
Waiting for some bridges to the night
Heaven is strong

This is the way that sadness
drowns you with eternal light
You never know when darkness fade

I need an angel
just to share my sacredness
Share the fictions on my life

The sun rise from my naked body, heart and soul
Glistens all the way to hell

Mercy is...
Waiting for some bridges to the night
Heaven is strong

This is the way that sadness
drowns you with eternal light
You might be lonesome known
as losers shades of hell

Visions of satisfaction
take these broken wings
All there is left is blood
and losers shades of hell
