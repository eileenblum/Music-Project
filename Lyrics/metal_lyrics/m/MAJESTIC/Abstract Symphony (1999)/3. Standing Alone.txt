[Andersson / Espinoza]

I'm standing alone
I'm here when you're calling me
Shadows of love
reach my heart when you're gone
We will be strong 'til the end

I'm all by myself
And no one can feel my pain

Whispering voices
beats my heart when you're gone
Close to your soul is my mind
I'm waiting for your hand

Holding on to you
Pictures of my game
I'm standing by your side
Here forever more
Forever more
Mmm baby

I'm lost in the night
I've seen all the secret lies
Unbroken spirits
close my eyes when you're here
Walk through the shadows of my love
I'm waiting for your hand

Holding on to you
Pictures of my game
Standing by your side
Here forever more

Ride the wings of dreams
Into the changing nights
Listen to your heart
face the bitter end

Yeah!...Standing all alone
Yeah!...I'm standing all alone
