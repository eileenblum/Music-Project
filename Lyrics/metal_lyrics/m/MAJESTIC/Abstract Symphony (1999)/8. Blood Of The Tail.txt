[Andersson]

I'll take your command, right out in the fields
I'm leaving my spirit when the oceans turns to sea
I'm crossing the darkness when you want me to kiss you goodnight

I pray for your soul in my holy land, the earth is trembling across in devils home
I'm praying for mercy as the lightning controlling the sky

heaven is screaming, angels of hell
Let light surround you
With the flames from the heat of the sky don't ask me why

There's no time, power of pain walk through my window
I've been there, since you've been gone blood of the tail was here

There's no way to go, I'm left here alone
they placed me a time bomb with no exit way to go
The love from my heart turns to violence
It's fading away

I pray for your soul in my holy land, the earth is trembling like a cross in devils home
I'm praying for mercy as the lightning controlling the sky

Captured by moonlight, stressed from the start
Centuries carving, as the bird form the sky falling down arrows will fly

Candle light show me the way, into the secrets
Sacred hearts lie on the ground killed by the fortune

There's no time, power of pain walk through my window
I've been there, since you've been gone blood of the tail was here
