[Andersson]

Standing by the shelter lighting candles in the wind
The cold wind with no mercy kills the surface on my chest
I'm here all alone, someone is calling me

The picture's worth a million, racing from the purple sky
Nasty liquid shadows stealing beauty from their eyes
I'm here all alone, someone is haunting me

In the night I see memories running away

Listen to the question watching nature from above
Beneath my dirty window, I see sirens rising dust
It's here once again, someone is calling me

Like the night I will last and be strong 'till the end
This is something to struggle with fury and darkness
My face towards the sky

Touched by the crimson sun
Mystery light
Crossing the seventh sky

Vermin's like a demon drenching happiness with tears
Minutes will be seconds after not calling her; miss
I'm here all alone
Watching the sun going down

Like the night I will last and be strong 'till the end
This is something to struggle with fury and darkness
My face towards the sky

Touched by the crimson sun
Mystery light
Crossing the seventh sky
