[Andersson]

Turn to the dust, before the sun
angels of hell full of passion
My vision of power is taken by storm
mercy from hell reach my soul

Freedom is here still running warm
Blessed by the red crimson sun
Raging with fury of those who still burn
Look here the damage is done

No! Don't leave me here
This tortures my heart say you will

It's there in the sky hidden in time
frozen by clouds from the darkness
The black moon which power has fury to bring
Lost in the shadows again

I'm locked up in chains
There's no last return to the earth

Disturbed by the feelings, struck by the power
Crack in the rainbow, my vein starts trembling
Mystery sadness, thousands of faces
Brings me the tale, why the black moon rising

Lock the doors, try to remain
higher than mountains of lying
They might be victims of heavenly eyes
that's just the front door to hell

I'm locked up in chains
There's no last return to the earth

Disturbed by the feelings, strucked by the power
Crack in the rainbow, my veins starts trembling
Mystery sadness, thousands of faces
Brings me the tale, why the black moon rising

Black moon rising...
Black moon rising...
Black moon rising...
