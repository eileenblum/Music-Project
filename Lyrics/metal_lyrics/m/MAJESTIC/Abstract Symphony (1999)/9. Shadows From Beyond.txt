[Andersson]

Now you're gone and everything has
turned into a nightmare of fear
This is not my last goodbye, no!
It's human sacrifice

Get into my dreams I'll be there
haunting your desperate mind
Don't believe in fate, it ain't what it seems

Rising from the dead and darkness
calling out your name
Feel the power from my night wings
silence has no end

Shadows from beyond feel the heat
flames from my burning wings
Angel of this hell, you're no friend of mine

This is my last goodbye
Demons with wings across the sky
Drenching the soil with blood
heaven can wait, not hell

Can't you see the game is over
stretching every muscle to reach destiny
When death calls, just an evil
it's burning in my eyes

Get into my dreams I'll be there
haunting your desperate mind
Don't believe in fate, it ain't what it seems

This is my last goodbye
Demons with wings across the sky
Drenching the soil with blood
heaven can wait, not hell
Heaven can wait
