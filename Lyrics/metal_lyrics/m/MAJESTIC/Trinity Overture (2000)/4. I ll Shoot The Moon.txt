Now I have a reason to believe in sacrifice
Behind the curtains of my window I will look upon the stars
If you're searching for an answer you might walking on for years
Leaving everything behind you is a way to stay alive

And we all... all falling down
And we all... all walking on

Somewhere in the darkness when my mind begins to fall
Before the angel of the sacred take you far away in time
Getting closer everyday I need to feel I need to pray
Something's turning on the nighttime and it never goes away

And we all... all falling down
And we all... all walking on

If you come back they will take you to a place you won't return
Burning candles rising forces you might be the one to go

Somewhere in the distant not so far from heavens door
Because of pieces left behind you won't be seeing all the stars
Now it speaks inside my head without a whisper it will say
I need shelter from the shaft that will be stronger day by day

And we all... all falling down
And we all... all walking on

If you come back they will take you to a place you won't return
Burning candles rising forces you might be the one to go

[SOLO]

If you come back they will take you to a place you won't return
Burning candles rising forces you might be the one to go

If you come back they will take you to a place you won't return
Burning candles rising forces you might be the one to go
