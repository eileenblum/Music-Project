Into the darkness morning came with disagree
The force is talking backwards painting life and death
His own solution is a legend from the past
The blood is rising stay away

My own dimension brings the silence of this place
Receiving gifts of tyranny hides in the air
Breeding divisions pale attempts to gather
In fury I'll be standing there

Shadow of dreams begin to fall ceremony rites belong to you
Passion of life and loneliness into my dream it's fading away

The book of life will free this evil rising son
The diamonds edge must cut the eyes of love and lies
Now we wait for the night in the sky in the sky in the sky
Ceremony is passing by
My Voodoo Treasure makes you see

Shadow of dreams begin to fall ceremony rites belong to you
Passion of life and loneliness into my dream it's fading away

Touching my soul with magic hands waiting for you I'm all-alone
History days we've done before building this end that someone will send

[SOLO]

Unbroken spirits leads the way inside your head
With bleeding tears there must be millions of these signs
Manifestations wake up screaming crisis
Infected souls far from the light

Shadow of dreams begin to fall ceremony rites belong to you
Passion of life and loneliness into my dream it's fading away

Touching my soul with magic hands waiting for you I'm all-alone
History days we've done before building this end that someone will send
