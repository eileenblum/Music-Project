In the darkness they will take you to a place were silence is ruling
Distant shadows temple candles naked bodies lie on the ground

In your eyes they'll see no warning dreams come true you're not in a story
Blood is rising death comes closer knocking spirits far from insanity

You must be reaching for this cause you're here in the darkness

And when you're all alone and close to dream your mind begins to search in the
wisdom is the way to rule again with swords and games my enemy is gone

Liquid shadows in conception life and death is something you must have
In confusion I'll be waiting filled with anger this is my destiny

You must be reaching for this cause you're here in the darkness

And when you're all alone and close to dream your mind begins to search in the
wisdom is the way to rule again with swords and games my enemy is...

Gone for ever more I'm all alone beneath my door the misery is...
Waiting for your soul destroy the way that leads me right into the sky

[SOLO]

And when you're all alone and close to dream your mind begins to search in the
wisdom is the way to rule again with swords and games my enemy is...

Gone for ever more I'm all alone beneath my door the misery is...
Waiting for your soul destroy the way that leads me right into the purple...

Sky is filled with pain that seems to be the crying game a soldier without...
Faith is in my mind my enemy with scars to heal like savage in the night
