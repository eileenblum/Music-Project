My sword is my name my name is my quitter
My heart in your hands leads me the way
Heroes are gone the ghost and the godsend spiritual signs fading away

Two broken spirits in the way dazzling through the night for the seventh sign

Out in the fields silently searching the corpses of hell already dried
Unbroken tales the eyes of the world memories wont take you away

Two broken spirits in the way dazzling through the night for the seventh sign

Now is the time you will be there watching my soul dancing away
Rising from hell based on a war killed by the night aiming at you

Arrived from the storm bringing the pieces love never die love is the war
Into the paint of roses and welfare portraits of hate fading away

Two broken spirits in the way dazzling through the night for the seventh sign

Now is the time you will be there watching my soul dancing away
Rising from hell based on a war killed by the night aiming at you

[SOLO]

Two broken spirits in the way dazzling through the night for the seventh sign

Now is the time you will be there watching my soul dancing away
Rising from hell based on a war killed by the night aiming at you

Close to the edge burning inside nothing to take they will release
Millions are dead victims are gone pray for their souls take me away

Rage has been here hunger is now killing the son lies has been told
You must be brave finding the truth running this game far to the end

Give me your hand reach me your tears don't be afraid stay with me now
