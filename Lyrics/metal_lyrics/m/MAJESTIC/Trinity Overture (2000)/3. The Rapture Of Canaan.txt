Screaming right into the moonlight
Inside the vision is clear
Leading us to the land of eternity

This place made without a shadow
Still rules everything seems to be heaven
This never ends It will shine to the end

You won't be waiting all alone because of magic dreams

Rapture of Canaan... The rapture of Canaan

Angels everywhere around you
Smiling this can't be true am I dreaming
Visions of God must be strong 'til the end

You will be waiting all alone if you don't turn away

Rapture of Canaan... The rapture of Canaan...
Rapture of Canaan... The rapture of Canaan...

[SOLO]

Rapture of Canaan... The rapture of Canaan...
Rapture of Canaan... The rapture of Canaan...

Rapture of Canaan... The rapture of Canaan...
Rapture of Canaan... The rapture of Canaan...
