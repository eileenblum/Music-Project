Suddenly something inside me lose control
Walking on into the straight line off today

Suddenly I can't remember what's tomorrow
Read the sign just like a fool that never lies

Beneath my window I see people everywhere
They try to steel it but I won't give them a dime
No one will take it away.

This is my game
No one to blame
Fading away
To blood red skies

Now my wings flying the way into the freedom
Yesterday doesn't remind me of a thing
Deep inside this is the way to something better
Left the trash before the journey to the stars

Beneath my window I see people everywhere
They try to steel it but I won't give them a dime
No one will take it away.

This is my game
No one to blame
Fading away
To blood red skies

[SOLO]

This is my game
No one to blame
Fading away
To blood red skies...
