This wind is rising from hell
The sand and rain can't go by
People will fear this by the name
The prince of darkness is here

You will see it's fighting with the tale it reach the end

Sensation my nation replaces the things you see
Slovenian Norwegian you all will fear this game

Our weakness rules into the shadows
The human race won't be strong
His strongest force thrown to the weak once
The price we'll pay with our souls

You will see it's fighting with the tale it reaches the end
All the victims screaming out the breath of Horus game

Sensation my nation replaces the things you see
Slovenian Norwegian you all will fear this game

[SOLO]

Sensation my nation replaces the things you see
Slovenian Norwegian you all will fear this game

It's burning the night blows your face is cold and grey
In silence or anger you all belong to me
