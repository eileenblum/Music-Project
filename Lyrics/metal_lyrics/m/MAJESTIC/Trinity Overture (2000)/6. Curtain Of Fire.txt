I never wanted you to be my sacrifice
It's in the air and you must pay the silver price

And if you're running they will come into the night
You must be waiting for the silence

They have a slaughterhouse and you might be the one
If you can see the day you wont be left alone

And if the blood is running through your naked veins
It's gonna take you to the angel

Sometimes it feels like I'm diving in the wind
Forever is so long
Now is the time and I'm waiting all alone
Together is so strong

Before your body gets away from heavy chains
I see your name look back in anger and in pain

And if you can you must be brave and be the strong
You must be waiting for the silence

Just say the word and I will be there close to you
It doesn't matter if you're waiting for the truth

I need to feel it suddenly into my skin
It's gonna take you to the angel

Sometimes it feels like I'm diving in the wind
Forever is so long
Now is the time and I'm waiting all alone
Together is so strong

[SOLO]

Sometimes it feels like I'm diving in the wind
Forever is so long
Now is the time and I've waiting all alone
Together is so strong
Sometimes it feels like I'm diving in the wind
Forever is so long
Now is the time and I've waiting all alone
Together is so strong
