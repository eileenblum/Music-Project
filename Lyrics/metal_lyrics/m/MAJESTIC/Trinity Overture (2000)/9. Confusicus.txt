I can't imagine that your love would go away
You know I hunger for your touch you wouldn't say
I dream about you baby, I'm so happy now
Remember all those years wherever you will go

When I see you standing there my heart begins to grow inside
Each day I love you more I'm here for you...

...Confusicus is here

I need to feel your heartbeat closing up to me
The feeling is so strong it almost hurts my soul

When I look into your eyes the world is trembling deep inside
The one and only word is love for me...

...Confusicus is here
...Confusicus is here

...Confusicus is here
...Love is now
