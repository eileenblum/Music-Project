Beasts awaiting, restless
Circus victims panic struck
Hunger spawns bestial frenzy
Commencement of the feast
By the sign of the cross

Whips crack
Centurians might be known
Christians standing breathless
Circus victims panic struck
Scream Arena butchery
Where is their god as the
Faithful meet their end?

Judgement has passed
Who questions this law?
Pagan belief of sacrifice

Kill them all
Kill them all for slander
Kill them all and mute their ways
