Lies, and you fill their souls
With all oppressions of this world,
And all the glory you'll receive?
So, what makes you supreme?
Lies, and your crown is falling.
I offer fantasy, and you
Create the blind with envy.

Let the children come to me
Their mother loves me, so shall they
Woman, bleeding, ate my gifts
Man was close behind
Just like a snake I'm slithering
Through my world divine
And like the cat I'm stalking
I'll take your soul and you'll be like me
In emptiness, free

Just bow to me faithfully
Bow to me splendidly
