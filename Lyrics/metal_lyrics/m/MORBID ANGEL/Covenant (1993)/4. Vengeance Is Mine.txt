Naught within this circle
All but emptiness expelled
I am deep in wicked
And whore to demons works
Master - I call thee
Master - Surround me
With evil in our hearts
This night we take revenge

Mote it be
Satan's sword I have become
No son shall escape
No word left unburned
The power is in me
Hellspawn in aeturnum
I burn with hate
To rid the world of
The Nazarene

This night of splendor
The beast arise in me
This is my destiny
My sword shall take life
