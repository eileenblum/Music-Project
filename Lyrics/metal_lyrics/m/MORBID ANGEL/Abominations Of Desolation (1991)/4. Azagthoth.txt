[Lyrics &amp; Music - Azagthoth]

Locked beyond the gate
Lost within the stars
Realm of Azagthoth
Mocking God
Against the light
Power of the skies
Hateful spawn "We are the chasm depths"

Come forth Azagthoth, Yog Sothoth
Rise, greet the curse with your wrath
My enemies are yours
Twist their minds with your spells
Crush their souls
With infernal grasp

I destroy jehova
In sacrifice
Cauldron burns and receives
Crush the priest of the dark
Raise the horns in blasphemy

Come forth Azagthoth, Yog Sothoth
Rise, greet the curse with your wrath
My enemies are yours
Twist their minds with your spells
Crush their souls
With infernal grasp

Come forth Azagthoth, Yog Sothoth
Rise, greet the curse with your wrath
My enemies are yours
Twist their minds with your spells
Crush their souls
With infernal grasp

[Solo]

Come forth Azagthoth, Yog Sothoth
Rise, greet the curse with your wrath
My enemies are yours
Twist their minds with your spells
Crush their souls
With infernal grasp

I destroy jehova
In sacrifice
Cauldron burns and receives
Crush the priest of the dark
Raise the horns in blasphemy

Come forth Azagthoth, Yog Sothoth
Rise, greet the curse with your wrath
My enemies are yours
Twist their minds with your spells
Crush their souls
With infernal grasp
