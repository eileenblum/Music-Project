[Re-released on Formulas Fatal To The Flesh CD as "Hellspawn : The Rebirth"]

Satan master you are the one
I am of you I am your son
You took all my light
I've given no fight
Turn me to black
Possessed to attack

I am the Hellspawn
I am the Hellspawn

You are all I need
For you I bleed
Plant your seed
Demons to feed
Blacken my soul
Under control
Born of fire
I shall return

I am the Hellspawn
I am the Hellspawn
I am the Hellspawn
I am the Hellspawn

Die

Blacken my eyes
You I defy
For you I lie
Master I will die
Born of fire
I shall return
Taken my soul
Under control

I am the Hellspawn
I am the Hellspawn
I am the Hellspawn
I am the Hellspawn

Satan master you are the one
I am of you I am your son
You took all my light
I've given no fight
Turn me to black
Possessed to attack

I am the Hellspawn
I am the Hellspawn
I am the Hellspawn
I am the Hellspawn
Hellspawn
Hellspawn
