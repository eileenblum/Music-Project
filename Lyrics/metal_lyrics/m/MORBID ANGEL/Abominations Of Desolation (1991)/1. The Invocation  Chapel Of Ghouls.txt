[The Invocation]

Ia Ia lord of the waters Iaksakak lord of the waters I summon thee
Come forth and make the gate appear
Iaksakak is the gate in which the spheres meet
Open wide the gate
The ancient ones ruled us all and shall rule again
Come forth through the gate and take the earth as your own

I am the god of all gods
I am the lord of darkness and the master of magicians
I am the power and the knowledge
I am before all things
I am before all gods
I am before all days
I am before all men and the legends of him
I am the ancient one
No man may seek my resting place
I am the god of gods
I am before all things

[Chapel Of Ghouls]

Ghouls attack the church
Crush the holy priest
Turning the cross towards hell
Blind with Satan's flame

Crush the priest
The feeble church

Dead - your god is dead
Fools - your god is dead
Useless prayers of lies
Behold Satan's arise

Crush the priest
The feeble church
The family of dog
Lust upon my altar

Demons attack with hate
Satan in hell he awaits
Death against you all
God hear my death call
