[Re-released on Covenant CD]

Your plastic souls melt within cauldron's burning bright
Chanting to the Ancient Ones, chants of broken lines
Kneel before the altar, sacrifice is made
It is pleasing to the ones most ancient of the days

They call the prince of disease, messenger of the Absu
Carry through icy winds our curse upon their church

Hanging helpless above the pentagram
Sacrifice swings within the leather noose
Sing the ancient hymn that makes the Absu roll
Raise the rusty knife and let loose the blood of Kingu

Sudden death throws off the balance that's within the sky
Priest calls forth infernal names to the ones beyond the gate

Angel of disease one who shuns the light
Shub Niggurath goat with a thousand young

Praise the beast, the chanting grew
Praise the beast with virgin blood
Praise the beast with soul and mind
Praise the beast and do the sign

Bind their kings in iron chains
Execute the judgement for them
Come and taste the earthly pleasures
Orgies of endless time

Beneath the rolling fog hate ignites their minds
From their graves the dead will rise to answer Nammtar's call
Upon a twisted cross the virgin corpse hangs
They blacken out the sun and burn the elder gods

Priests of chaos calling forth
Abominations of the pit
Cthulhu meets in the void
Ancient Ones rule once more
