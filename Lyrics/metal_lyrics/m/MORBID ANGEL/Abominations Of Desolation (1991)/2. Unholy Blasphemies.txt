[Re-released on Blessed Are The Sick CD with different lyrics]

[Lyrics - Azagthoth/Vincent; Music - Azagthoth]

Rise through the gate, Iak Sakkath
From depths beyond the sky
The realm of evil gods
Painful... They eat your mind

Laugh in the face of dog
Spread disease upon his church

Ghouls who pray the death of god
Destroy the Catholic church
Vomiting upon the cross
And burn the book of lies

Laugh in the face of dog
Spread disease upon his church
Vomiting upon the cross
Scream forth blasphemy

Yog Sothoth, Azagthoth
Come forth and taste the blood
Infant entrails
Are hung upon the twisted cross

Laugh in the face of dog
Spread disease upon his church
Vomiting upon the cross
Scream forth blasphemy
