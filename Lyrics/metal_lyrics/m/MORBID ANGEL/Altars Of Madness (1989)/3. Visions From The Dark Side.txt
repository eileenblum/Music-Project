[Music: Azagthoth, Vincent]
[Lyrics: Vincent]

Dark eyes, shadows grim
They come for me
Midnight chimes, blackened earth
The evils rise
Pits of hate open wide
Chasm of my dreams
Last of chimes - minks arrive
And take my mind again

Waste polluted memories
Acid rivers flow
Vigil for this land's decay
Sounding from below
Dogs of war, satan's own
Plotting all their sins
Weapons aimed at liberty
My vision - no one wins

[Chorus:]
Take my mind
All the way
The darkside calls
I shan't resist

[Solo: Brunelle]

Men forever rot in pain
Mind machines control
Toxic rains scouring brains
Victimizing souls
Winds of war suffocate
Voodoo in the sky
Breathe the gases, breathe no more
My vision - all will die

[Chorus]

[Solo: Azagthoth]

Cut myself and release the blood
Pains of a thousand years
Pathic sights - jorney's end
Descent into another world
My time has come to meet me
Masters... all the corporate lourds
I'm not afraid to face all their
Trials - slavery - in the end they'll
Still have no power over me

[Solo: Brunelle]

Daylight shines blind my eyes
Waken to another day
Tribulation now has passed
But the dreams remain
Walls of sleep fade away
Abandonment of wonders
Monks of knowledge bid farewell
And leave me with these visions
From the darkside

(Visions - from the darkside)
