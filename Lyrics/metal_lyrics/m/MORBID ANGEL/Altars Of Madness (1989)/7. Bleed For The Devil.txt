[Music &amp; Lyrics: Azagthoth]

Come to me, lord of filth
Hear my cries princes of nightmares
Touch us with your morbid lips
Let us taste your foulness

[Chorus:]
Bleed for the devil
Impious mortal lives
Feel the enticing power
Fill the chasm of your soul

Fill the air with the smell of death
Grace us with your magic
Fill the night with the stench of evil
I summon forth the beast

[Solo: Brunelle]

[Chorus]

[Solo: Azagthoth, Brunelle]

Cold look in his eyes
He holds the gleaming knife
Girl cries as he cuts way the
Strips of flesh

[Solo: Brunelle]

[Chorus]

[Solo: Azagthoth]
