[Lyrics - Azagthoth/Vincent; Music - Azagthoth]

Rise through the gate, Iak Sakkath
From depths beyond the sky
The realm of evil gods
Painful... They eat your mind

[Chorus:]
Evil undisguised
Breathe in pain
Blackened souls remain

Ghouls who pray the death of god
Destroy Jehovah's church
Vomit upon the cross
And burn the book of lies

[Chorus]

[solo Brunelle]

Ghouls who pray the death of god
Destroy Jehovah's church
Vomit upon the cross
And burn the book of lies

[Chorus]

[solo Azagthoth]

Yog Sothoth evil one
Come forth and taste the blood
Infant entrails
Are hung upon the twisted cross

Blood [?]
Breathe in pain
Blackened souls remain

[solo Azagthoth]
