[Music - Azagthoth, Lyrics - Tucker]

Depredate, Restraint is not an option
This world has fallen, Now scorched and barren

The rage of lunatics, shall lead us nevermore
The hand, long forgotten, shall feed the blessed now

Arise our Golem Defeat this enemy
God strength upon the leach infested
Rise our ancient wisdom and bring your pestilence

Rectify, With haste your wrath awakened
Malfeasance, You scorn this world
Enshrined by grace, your shadow blinds the feeble
Disentail the noble few

Arise our ancient Golem Defeat this enemy
God strength upon the leach infested
Rise our ancient wisdom destroy this wasteland
Enshrined by Grace devour this presceance

Light the flame of redemption
