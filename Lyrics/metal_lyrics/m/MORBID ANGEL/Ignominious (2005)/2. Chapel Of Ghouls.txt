Ghouls attack the church
Crush the holy priest
Turning the cross towards hell
Writhe in [sings "with"]

Satan's flames

Crush the priest
The feeble church

[Solo: Brunelle]

Dead - your god is dead
Fools - your god is dead
Useless prayers of lies
Behold Satan's rise

Crush the priest
The feeble church
The family of dog
Lust upon my altar

[Solo: Azagthoth]
[Solo: Brunelle]

Demons attack with hate
Satan in the fires of hell awaits
Death against you all
God hear my death call

[long Chorus]

[Solo: Brunelle]
