[Music: Rutan, lyrics: Vincent]

Hatework...
Bringer of doom
Hatework...

What I have in store
What has the devil got to do with it
I'm brewing my toil
So the brimstone comes this way

Nightwork...
My life's work
Nightwork... world in flames

This calls for fire
This is a call for ruin
We will be departed
Leave the rot so lonely

Hatework...
Bringer of doom
Hatework... and the turmoil comes...
Hatework...
My work
Hatework... and the earth's left burning

I call death... death is answering me
And a world betrayed is black forever.

Blessed be the Ones, the most natural Ones.
Blessed be the Ones who were here before and will be after.
Blessed be the Ones who conquer without effort.
Blessed be the meekness of the flesh,
Oh how this opposition frightens me!
Ha!
Come with wind and blow the flesh from this earth,
Come with water and wash away the flesh from this earth,
Come with fire and burn the flesh from this earth,
Make the earth upheaval,
May it become unfriendly to the flesh.
