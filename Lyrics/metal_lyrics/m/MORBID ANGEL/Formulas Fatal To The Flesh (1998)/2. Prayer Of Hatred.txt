Blessed be the Ones
The Most Ancient Ones
Blessed be the Ones
Who were here before and after remain
Blessed be the meekness of the flesh
I watch as it withers and dies

Come with Storm and
Blow the flesh from this earth
Come with Flood and
Wash away the flesh from this earth

The mighty of this world are only
Mighty of the flesh
But that of flesh
Is crushed by that of the Mountain
For it is written that
The future of flesh is dust
You are but a shell
Your wine something unseen

Come with Fire and
Burn the flesh from this earth
Make the Earth upheaval
May it swallow up the flesh of this earth

Your dreams
Mundane delusions of Malkuth
My dreams
The Continuum Force that devours all things
Dreams
That eat the flesh and drink the blood
Uruku, My brothers
It is your time to feed

Your will
Empty promises you can't fulfill
My will
Brings avalanches of abundance
Power
Of the Gods circulate within my veins
I lie in wait
Being that erodes all things
