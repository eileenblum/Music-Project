You are the One, the Oldest One
You come before the legends of men
You come before the legends of gods
You are the Sea, Creator of All

You're all I need, For You I bleed
Plant Your Seed, Earth shall feed
Enlighten my soul, Spirit grows
Born of the Fire, I shall return

I am the Hellspawn

Curse from my eyes, your gods I defy
Fulfillment is mine, of the Most High
Born of the Fire, I shall return
Answer the Call of the Oldest One

I am the Hellspawn

Forever I am, in Spirit I am
Forever I Dream, Continual Dream
We Sleep undisturbed again
Chthhulhu We Dream in the Peace again

I am the Hellspawn
