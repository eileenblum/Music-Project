This Assembly!

Come forth Ningishzida and fortify this Sacred Place with Thy Sturdiness.
May it be tamed of any and all rebellion.

- The Living Continuum -

The Living Continuum is the Principal Force and Form
by which all Manifestation is possible.
It is both the Active Willful Ability to Create
as well as the Materials to Create from.
It is both the Force that Expands our Universe
as well as the Form which Contains it.
It is both the active Willful Ability to Assemble
as well as the Material Parts that make up this Assembly.
It is both That Which Is as well That Which Is Not.

It is both the Alpha and Omega of the Lighting Flash.
For from the Left Hand Is Produced Fire.
And from the Right Does the Waters Pour.
From the Breath Issues Forth the Thunderous ME-GAL-GAL.
~~~~~~~~~~
Most Bitter-Sweet Divine Ordering Principle.

It is both the Activeness and the Stillness.

This Activeness is One With the Triumvirate of Most High.
The Triumvirate of

Chthhulhu
I Am The Living Active God

Habsu
My True-Will Can Not Be Denied

Amah-Ushumgal-Anna
I Create Myself As Well As My World

Amen

The Purpose of these hymns are to lift up and give praise to the Most Ancient of Days.
We willfully give of ourselves to be Their Instrument on this earth.
