Our patience gone for your folly
There'll be no restraint
Though it's been urged there's no warrant
To let you remain
Ten thousand years
For a test you failed miserably
The target's locked
And this planet will soon be human free

March, March

... No hero should rise amongst you
... Don't prolong your misery accept your fate

Laser vision has monitored for centuries
We've gathered evidence
We know that you are disease

It matters not...
What counter measures you employ
You're not the first ones that we've destroyed
We take charge the task at hand
Rid the third planet of life...

Destroy man
We're marching
Destructos marching on man
We're marching
Destructos marching on!

We're marching
Destructos marching on!

Convoke the data
Attack imminent
Final closure on this failed earth experiment

It matters not...
What counter measures you employ
You're not the first ones that we've destroyed
We take charge the task at hand
Rid the third planet of life...

Destroy man
We're marching
Destructos marching on man
We're marching
Destructos marching on man
We're marching
Destructos marching on man
We're marching
Destructos marching on!

Destroy man
We're marching
Destructos marching on!
We destructos march

No mercy from annihilation
No mercy from destructo-nation
Seek Total annihilation
No mercy from destructo-nation

We're marching on
Through the sordid human remains
The dead attest... Your resistance in vain
Ten thousand years and you never evolve?
It's over soon for humans one and all
The facts have shown all resources you waste
Our eyes have seen all your greed and distaste
You feeble beings, just a blight to this earth
Destructos marching on...
