[Music: Tucker, Fuller, lyrics: Tucker]

Empires and nations fall
Caesars were men not gods
Idols change as needed through time
Generals are irrelevant without war
Kings mean nothing without fools
To master

To feed their manic ego
To win their lusted plights
To follow with no caution
To follow to demise

Mad men are praised and worshiped
Enslavers victimize
Torture, always their answer
To teach incessant hatred

The hand of God became filled with riches for only kings
The hand of kings became the willâthe will of men enslaved

Empires and nations fall
Caesars were men not gods

To feed your personal interest
To feed your farewell will
To die to fall and fisting
To die to you was cruel

The hand of God became filled with riches for only kings
The hand of kings became the willâthe will of men enslaved
