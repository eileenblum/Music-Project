[Lyrics - Tucker, Music - Azagthoth/Tucker]

I am the void of light, silence, I am the dawn of time
I am the all you see, emptiness I am the non

I am the air you breathe, treachery, I am your wine
I am the soil and seed, mundane, I am the in between

taste of my knowledge
come bleed me weak
of my force feed

drink of my power
breathe of the mist dine upon divinity

from the earth and wind
our return is now
forever and now again

our voice is one
voice of the ancient ghosts
now your chains are stripped away

I am the void of light, silence, I am the dawn of time
I am the soil and seed, mundane, I am the in between

taste of my knowledge
come bleed me weak
dine upon divinity

from the earth and wind
our return is now
now the chains are stripped away
