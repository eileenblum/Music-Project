...God do you understand me
My false prayer ?
Falce prayer
prayer to ...

God take pity
I am whole trembling
Deprive my tears
Do you understand me ?
You are emptiness
But still I believe
You are my loneliness
I am afraid of your mercy
God take pity !
While I am praying to you
Search my idea
Do you understand me ?
You are still emptiness
But still I believe
I am afraid of your mercy

Lead me on through my life
So that I could go astray
Let me believe in you
So that I could say someday
That you exist

I am afraid of your mercy
Because you are lonelines
And still I believe
Though you are emptiness
Do you understand me ?
Search my idea
While I am praying to you
Do you take pity ?
I am afraid of your mercy
Though you are loneliness
And still I don't believe
Because you are emptiness
Do you understand me ?

You deprived my fears
My requests came true
I don't need to pray you any longer !

Don't lead me through my life
I went astray anyway
You did not let me believe in you
So that someday I could say
That you exist.
