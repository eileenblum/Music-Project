Mother you've died, you've left me
Father you've passed away, you've left me
Sister where are you, you've left me
Brother you've grown up, you've left me

Why am I alone
Born to suffer
Do you get pleasure from this
God, you don't exist

I was born blind, you took it away from me
All the colours of life, you took them away from me
Funs,childhood you took it away from me

I live with loneliness
Death is in my thoughts
Here comes emptiness ... nothing
