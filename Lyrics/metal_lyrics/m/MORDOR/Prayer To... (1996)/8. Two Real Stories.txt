You thing drifting through life
So much amazing, desirable
You feel beauty and pain
Yoi dream and believe profoundly
No accepting the gloomy existence
You feel the joy and sadness

So various but close
Two real stories
Desire and impotence
Statisfaction out of reach
Often soaked with tears
Bitter like the raindrops
So various but close
Two real stories

Life is like the sea
Completly out of control, unknown
Unforseen and unchecked
Omniously ruffled and unchecked
Often quaiet and plain
So similar to our existence

Bitter misfortunes and surprices
They can't be forseen
As the sea shore begins
Our life ends
