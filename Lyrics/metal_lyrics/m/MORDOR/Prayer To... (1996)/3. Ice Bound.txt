Classed hands in the block of ice
Body ice - bound in the snow - land
Frosty pattern painted in the eyes
Sharp, white coolness overcame you

Ice - bound
What's your name
Winter has frozen your
In the snow wildeness

Tell me
White snow - flake,
Is the winter
Your mother ?

May be you've been staying here for ages
But you're anonymous being
May be somebody remembered your
But now you're forgotten
