Somebody,the first one,took pleasure from cry
Burnt the human head used the pain and lust
Using paralysing fear

The first one will be the last one

Is it realy human ambition
May be human hate
But where is supernatural power
That could save us

Somebody,the first one, took the hope away
Forgot what goodness was
Searched the evil in a man
And things was understanding
Somebody,the first one,hurt to the bones
Broke the feeling of faith
Could so beautiful cheat

Somebody,the first one, tormented of lust
Do harm with reason
Used his advantage
Humiliated with statisfaction

The first one will be the last one

Somebody,the first one, desired to own
Gather some dirt money
And decided to make them
To be the value of man

The first one will be the last one

Is it realy human ambition
May be human hate
But where is supernatural power
That could save us
