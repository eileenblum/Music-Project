I saw the rain come in
I saw the night
But you saw the man in the mansion
And you saw the light
Wait for some to call me
But no one else did
So I shook the hands of my brother
Made him feel like a little shit
Lean on me

Lean on me

You dance, you dance towards me
You make me feel so young
You dance, you dance towards me
You make me so-
Lean on me

Lean on me

We two, waiting for some
We found nothing at home

Lean on me

Time to get down with the pain
Time to with the hand
We all know understand, look,
Time to take your life or even a take 
This energy is a fake
I will make nothing but peace no fake
Time to get down with the pain
Time to with the hand
We all know understand, look,
Time to take your life or even a take
(I've been waiting so long)
Time to take your life or even a take
(For the moment to pass me over, upon what I love)
Take your life
(I'm still here)

I took my man to the mansion
Made him up on the bed
And all that I see
But I don't know how
So I wasted my dog on time

Lean on me

Lean on me
