Alone with the woods and the moon
Now it's time, I'll be joining you soon
?Alone can't still keep her by my side?
Don't run from me, don't hide
Alone I've been searching everywhere
Now I've given up, you and me
Alone...

What have we done
I cannot overcome
What we've become
I cannot overcome

You and I, You and I forever
Stop it now, come let's go

You and I, You and I forever
Forever...
