"First of all I would like to say that I feel no remorse whatsoever for what I've done. I'd do it again in a second if I had the chance. I'll explain to you my position here, my whole purpose in life is help destroy your society. You people are here as representatives of that society and as such should do everything in your power to rid the world of me. Execute me."

For I can turn this fantasy to life
make you sleep through every lie
But you can crawl back down your hole
if you donât yield to me your soul

For I can't stop the winds yay-yea
and I can't end the rain yay-yea
but I can take away your pain

"It was almost a religious conversion and the ?works.? To the end to think perhaps this is my destiny then to kill and ?made me doing it? Perhaps there is a devil, perhaps this is the work of the devil."

For I can turn this fantasy to life

And I can take away your pain...
