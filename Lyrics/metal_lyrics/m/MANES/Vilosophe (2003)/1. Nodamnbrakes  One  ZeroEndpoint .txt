Got to climb it higher
Got to make it can grow, we can
Got to push it harder
Push it harder, you can see

No need to speak
I need to rest

Got to climb it higher
Got to make it can grow, we can
Got to push it harder
Push it harder, you can see

I can be hard to play
I can be hard

No need to speak
No need to rest

Just one could kill the pain

No need to speak
No need to rest

Just one could kill the pain

The endpoint of zero
