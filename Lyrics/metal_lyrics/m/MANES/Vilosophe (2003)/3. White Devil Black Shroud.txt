All that's me
All that's you
Is what I choose to show
What I seem to be
I was never free
All that's me
All that's you
Is what I choose to show
What I seem to be
Never free

Of course I love her
She's all I need

You know I can't feel
You know I can't love
She's all I need to know
You know I can't feel
You know I can't love
She's all I knew
You know I can't feel
You know I can't love

She's all I knew

You know I can't feel
You know I can't love
