Fall into profound awe.
I kneel, I prostrate.
From the head of Caper Aniza, the horned one, arise.
Upon my mouldering bones.
I will bring fire to thee.
Dark lord, hear my hall.
Into the crimson moon.
Obesessed by the rising moon.
Darkness prevails.
The vile, unholy one.
From the abyss, arise, my master calls.
Evil supreme.
Jesus wept.
And heaven fell.
