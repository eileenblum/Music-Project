bewailing my memories
my death is all that i claim
nothing could fill my inanity
my opaque apathy bleeds...

afraid of this slow decay
you see me fading away...

befog my mind
stay by my side
please don't leave me here
please don't leave me...

attached to this gloom i see
raping myself to be free...

befog my mind
stay by my side
please don't leave me here
please don't leave me...

befog my mind
stay by my side
please don't leave me here
please don't leave me...
crush all my faith
sorrow turns to hate
please don't leave me here
please don't save my life...
