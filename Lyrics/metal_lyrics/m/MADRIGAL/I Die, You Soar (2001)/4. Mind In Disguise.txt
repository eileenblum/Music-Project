felt a stream of desire
will i see you again
disappeared on a frail lonely path
still your face i retain...

reaching out to grasp your hand again
still i can't find you

loast my mind to disguise
will i see you again
lost the world as my weakness came
through
i'll be waiting for you...

reaching out to grasp your hand again
still gone the only thing i need
i burst inside, i scream
i wish you back again...

reaching out to grasp your hand again
still gone the only thing i need
i burst inside, i scream
i wish you back again...
