deluded into despair
this emptiness
more than i can bear
all i own is pain and sorrow
all i know is guilt
anxiety, disgust of tomorrow
i'm drowning in my filth...

i will never see you as you are
your shallow soul blinds me

all i feel in this weary hour
is weakness and dismay
in solitude
thoughts resolve around your way
all i see is you
slipping further away
lost in a void of grey...

i will never see you as you are
your shallow soul blinds me

i see you
all this hate for you
i feel you
all this love for you

i will never see you as you are
your shallow soul blinds me

i see you
all this hate for you
i feel you
all this love for you
