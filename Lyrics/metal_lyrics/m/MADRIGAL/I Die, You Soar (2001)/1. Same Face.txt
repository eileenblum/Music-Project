spending all my time
trying to prove to myself
you're not as hollow
as you seem...

suffering and love seem to have the same face
same face...

wasting all my love
trying to make you feel
trying to make you believe
what your fading eyes can't see

leading this soul towards the end

ominous like a disease
ghastly throughts seem paltry

suffering and love seem to have the same face
same face...
suffering and love seem to have the same face
for me...
for you...
