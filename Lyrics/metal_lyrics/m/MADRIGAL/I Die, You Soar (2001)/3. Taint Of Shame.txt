with this loathe engrained in me
i falter in despair
i perish away in my taint of shame
lost, astray again...

lapsed in the enchantress mind
submissive, scorned with no will to find
she strangles me again...

asunder of the painful theft
theft of all i had
i feel so ashamed, embraced with hate
as death leaves me to wait...

and she makes me cry
and crumble like a child
i will no more endure
this rape so wild

lapsed in the enchantress mind
submissive, scorned with no will to find
she strangles me again...

i pray this stair to end
i can't go deeper
i see no light, no end...

and she makes me cry
and crumble like a child
i will no more endure
this rape so wild

lapsed in the enchantress mind
submissive, scorned with no will to find
she strangles me again...

i pray this stair to end
i can't go deeper
i see no light, no end...
