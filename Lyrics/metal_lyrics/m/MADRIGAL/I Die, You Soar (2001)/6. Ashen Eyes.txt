you imbue me
you imbue me with your seed
and all i see
is me reclining you...

i see it all
my ashen eyes still see it all
still trying hard
too keep myself away
from where i feel you...

everyone's watching
but still i die, you soar...
although i am gone,
a leechrope found
but still you soar...

but it always ends
it always ends in my pain
love is grief
love always turns to hate
and hate turns on me...

everyone's watching
but still i die, you soar...
although i am gone,
a leechrope found
but still you soar...
