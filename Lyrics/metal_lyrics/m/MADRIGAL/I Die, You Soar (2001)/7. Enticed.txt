yearning for life
weak search for faith
see them all allow themselves
to be part of this waste
see weak vanish away
see them live with the lie
see just another betrayal
see how they die...

Abusing the weak to relieve your own bane
controlling the weak to the free from your pain
to see you like this will draw tears from my eyes
you've been ... you've been enticed...

crying out for a helping hand
just to find that it's gone
for you this world has been belied
you lone in dawn
see weak vanish away
see them live with the lie
see just another betrayal
see how they die...

Abusing the weak to relieve your own bane
controlling the weak to the free from your pain
to see you like this will draw tears from my eyes
you've been ... you've been enticed...
