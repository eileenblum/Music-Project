Abominate decrepidness
No use to mankind
Dismembered flesh of useless ones
Better off to feed the blind

Cursed at birth
As judgement dawns
Your life grows futile
As you await to die

Forsaken souls
butchered in disgust

Eating of blood forbidden
Thrown into a dying world
Rid ourselves of mankind
Sinful waste to die
