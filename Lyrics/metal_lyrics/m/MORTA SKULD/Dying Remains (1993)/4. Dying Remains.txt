Open arms deceive us
Impure thoughts inbreed
Prevails the silence
Of suffocation

For many years
Emotions run deep
Decaying flesh
Of innocence

Punishment for our wrong
Inward legendary pain
Weeping souls to fail
Eternal

Open arms deceive us
Impure thoughts inbreed
Breeding deception
To forgive is to die... to die
