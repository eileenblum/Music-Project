Expecting terror
Suffering
Of your own life
You shall bleed

Escaping your reality
That surrounds you
Internal torment
You will soon see

Eternal suffering
Draws you nearer
To your life
You will die

Suffering
Deliver us from this evil

Suffering
Devoured fears

You feel this is unreal
For one's temptation
Who is to blame

Look into silence
Reveling fears
Deep within
Awaken to
What you've become

Suffering
Deliver us from the evil
Suffering
Devoured fears
