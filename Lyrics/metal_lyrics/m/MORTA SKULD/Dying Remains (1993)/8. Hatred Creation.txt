The dying one
A sacrifice
For his creation
Fall from grace
This will not suffice
Release me

Blackened souls
Open wounds to heal
Hatred burns
From inside

Why was I born to die
Hatred creation
Why was I born to suffer
Hatred creation

Blackened souls
Open wounds will not heal
From inside
Penetrate forever lasting cries
Hatred burns
Can you see into my dying eyes
Your soul is mine
Now it's time for you to die alive

Fear cries below
Pain will remain
Blood washes away
Rotting distant time

Why was I born to die
Hatred creation
Why was I born to suffer
Hatred creation
Hatred creation
