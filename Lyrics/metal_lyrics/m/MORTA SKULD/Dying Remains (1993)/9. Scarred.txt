Day by day
Memories remain
Reality slips away
From within your mind

Suffer to exist
Helpless are their cries
Damnation pities none
Scarred flesh to rot

Condemned to suffer
The pain of my forgotten past

Suffering past remorse
Chained upon my limbs
Souls bound my unbearable screams
