As the world crumbles before you
Hypocrisy of the masses grows
Behind the lies is where you base the truth
You will find these thoughts are true
In the mind's eye we find the future solitude
Are we just prisoners in our own mind
Hypocrisy of the masses grows
Compassion is twisted
Have we just lost faith or just given into this selfish temptation
As we cry for salvation of a life beyond
Deep inside your heart
You will find these thoughts are true of the masses
