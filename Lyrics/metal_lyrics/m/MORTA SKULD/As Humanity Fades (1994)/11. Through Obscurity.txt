We die as one as the earth becomes weaker
Can we learn from our mistakes
Or just be condemned to repeat them
The blood of the innocent
The land where there is infinite emptiness
In the heavens the dawn of light may never shine
As their shame and guilt may never succeed
Forever are they trapped between extremes
This is serious
Are these words meaningless or have they gone unheard
Famine, disease, bloodshed
All have suffered
In the shadows we cower
As our earth dies and people becomes weaker
Can we learn from our mistakes or be condemned to repeat them
