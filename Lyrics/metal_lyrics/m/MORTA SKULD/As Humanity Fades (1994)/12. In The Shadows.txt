Sinful eyes have tasted
Awakened are their fears
Sickening of man were disgraced
Constant sadness until no end
Concealing lies in the shadows
Compelling cries in man's eyes
Cast from this sanctuary by the grace of God
No eternal resting place
As brutality teaches us all
No where to hide
In the flesh external tears subside
Empty cries fill their minds
Ungodly indulgence hidden in the shadows
As we beg for forgiveness
In the shadows
