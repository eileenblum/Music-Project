As the flame of hate burns
The walls of humanity falls
As we sacrifice the lives of many
Close your eyes to us all
The thousands suffering
No point of return before the light of humanity fades
From the ashes of ancestors we now learn
Man conquered by his own hate
Will our minds conform or crumble into the grave
The legacy of man proclaimed or blinded by our rage for survival
From the ashes our humanity fades
