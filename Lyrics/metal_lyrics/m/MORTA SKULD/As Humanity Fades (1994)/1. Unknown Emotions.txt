Tears of frustations pain
This dream of reality
Hiding in a lost paradise
A structured world you believe
Do you know how it feels to live in an unknown emotion?
My own flesh and blood denied of my existence
How can you live with yourself
After causing such mental damage
Your mirror reflects this hollow image that stares at me
Limitations confine you as they have stricken me
Something you've tried to contain
The spirit between two souls and has created what you can't find
