Searching inside my soul for the answer within the truth
To fulfill the emptiness within
Programmed since birth
Children of society
What are you afraid of?
Behind the eyes lies a sanctuary denied
Raped of all that surrounds me
By people who once adored me
I have been deceived
These thoughts are not my own
Indecision plagues me
A voice within calls
Sanctuary denied
Minds stripped of all pride
these thoughts are not my own
Indecision plagues me
Minds raped of all that is real
Sanctuary denied
Stripped of all pride
