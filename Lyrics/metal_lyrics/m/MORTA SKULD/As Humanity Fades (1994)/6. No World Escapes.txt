Who will be left to survive
In our time of need
Traces of humanity
We have been led astray
No world escapes
Our cities turn to battlefields
Engaged in timeless ruins
Fatality turns us away
This fear locked inside our minds
Underlying guilt and greed onto others
This weakness feeds
Traces of humanity is all that will be left to lay
Fatality turns us away
In our time of need do we look away
No one escapes
