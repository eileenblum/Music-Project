An act of fate we cannot stop
Accept the consequence
The land that time forgot
Upon the earth
This disease that feasts on man
Surviving from the past
As fatal visions blur
Mind of the future
To suffer our unknown fate
Life span now decreases
The darkness of war threatens
To engulf the land
Upon this earth
This disease that feasts on man
Victims are they of themselves
The path in which they choose on
Are past extinction we feed
