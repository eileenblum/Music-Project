In these desolate wastes
We call our world
Look at the thousands
Which we have deceived
We lie in timeless sleep
Forged dreams of gluttony
When will we finally see the awakening destiny
As you ask for redemption
For which you certain you will be forgiven
By false intentions perceived through our generations downfall
The awakening destiny
Our souls behold this image
Embraced in their pain
Must be carry on their oppression
Till our final dying day
Awakening destiny
