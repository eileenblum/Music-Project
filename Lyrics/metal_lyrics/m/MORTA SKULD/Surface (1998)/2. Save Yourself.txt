we suffer in the system of technology--freedom is the cage we all call home--scales of justice,corruption, forced to your
knees--by dreams built on false hope--you leaft us nothing but a world beyond repair--try and heal yourself, try and save
yourself--try and see yourself, save yourself--save yourself--you turn your back on your beliefs--sees of the future now
planted--now we know we were leaft for dead--we suffer in the system of fuckin' greed--freedom is the cage we call home--how can
you turn your back on me--you selfish motherfucker--have you been brainwashed or don't you care--save the earth, kill
yourself--you leaft us nothing but a world beyond repair--try and heal yourself, try and see yourself--try and save yourself,
save yourself.
