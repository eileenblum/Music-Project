the mask in which we wear, our daily sacrifice--the mask you hide behind, the anger in disguise--trapped within this world, no
where to run--no where to hide, a prisoner in my own mind--all concept of time is lost, walls of deception--battle lines have
been drawn--the anger in you is the anger in me--a lifetime of wounds, you still cant see--endless wars now prevail, as you lose
direction--of what is right and wrong--trapped within this world, no where to run--no where to hide, a prisoner in my own
mind--the ashes of time before me, it tears from inside--swallow your pride, it tears from inside--inside--trapped within this
world, no where to run--no where to hide, a prisoner within my own mind--the anger in you is the anger in me--a lifetime of
wounds, you still cant see--the ashes of time before me, it tears from inside--swallow your pride, it tears from inside--inside.
