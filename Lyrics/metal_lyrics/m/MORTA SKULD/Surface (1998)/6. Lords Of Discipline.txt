at war, at war with the world--trust in me, who is our Saviour now--feeding off the weakness and fear--lost forever, souls that
lose their path--they hear in the silence--no one escapes their eyes--do you question them--what every man fears--a man made
machine, made of respect--nothing disgraces his eyes--to preserve order and chaos--my mind taken by force--i cant look back at
what was me--using knowledge against you--a part of me is gone--their presence is known--never thinking twice--their command you
obey, they rule with an iron fist--they hear in the silence--no one escapes their eyes--do you question them--what every man
fears--i live in world of hatred--robbed of body, mind, and soul.
