the fight for morality, the fight between two minds--one heart, one stone, heart turned to stone--in time of war, in time of
peace--in time of need i stand alone--manipulate, destiny by forced control--manipulate, the one thought process--manipulate, i
see the jealousy grow--in time of war, in time of peace--in time of need, i stand alone--searching through past memories--i carry
the conflict--manipulate, destiny by forced control--manipulate, the one thought process--manipulate, i see the jealousy
grow--you crucify me for your mistakes--as you relive your through me--searching through past memories--i carry the
conflict--time will never forget--the fight for morality, the fight between two minds--one heart, on stone, heart turned to stone.
