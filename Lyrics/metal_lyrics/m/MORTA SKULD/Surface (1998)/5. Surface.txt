as i hide in the shadows of my mind--bury the pain that surrounds me--bury my fear--as i stare into the mirror, anger turns to
fear--dreams cast into fire, as hope falls beneath their tears--closing the doors behind me--to where my thought are buried--if i
could touch the surface, what would i see--if i could crawl to the surface, what would i find--crawl to the surface--anger turns
to fear, dreams cast into fire--as hope falls beneath their tears--if i could touch the surface, what would i see--if i could
crawl to the surface, what would i find--as stare into your eyes--the same eyes that betray me--for the last time.
