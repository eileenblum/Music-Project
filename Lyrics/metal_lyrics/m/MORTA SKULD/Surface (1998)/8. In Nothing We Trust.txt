the war is not over, no battle have we won--beneath the layers of lies we live--i suffer by my own hands--but i am to blind to
see--behind closed doors the government hides me--i am silence, society is sickened--the naked truth, show yourself to me--the
naked truth, the eternal cover up--believe in me, for you have no other choice--for i have no race, color or greed--for in
nothing, in nothing we trust--for in nothing we trust--i suffer by my own hands--but i am to blind to see--but i am to blind to
see--the war is over, the government hides me--as i am silenced, society is sickened--the naked truth, show yourself to me--the
naked truth, the eternal cover up--believe in me for you have no other choice--for i have no race, color or greed--for in
nothing, in nothing we trust--for in nothing, in nothing we trust.
