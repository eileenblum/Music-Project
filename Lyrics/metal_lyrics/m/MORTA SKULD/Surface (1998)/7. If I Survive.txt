man has destroyed all in his way--he has no remorse, he will have his day--forgotten by many, lost to some--in an age where
brother betrays brother--animal instincts are alive--it has taught us to survive--faceless to some, a number to the many--for he
hates, what he's created--the thought are ageless--an eye for an eye, a man for a man--in an age where brother betrays
brother--animal instincts are alive--it has taught is to survive--faceless to some, a number to the many--as i try and escape the
rage within, the rage within--try and turn back the hands of time--the world in which he has made, made him--it has turned back
into a race against time.
