In time my wounds will heal - as they give your name
Rivals meeting face to face - fate sealed, you bow down in shame
Run, run, you run so far - escape to nowhere
I smell the path you`ve fled - turn your head you`re dead

I am the master killer - fall to me
Pray for a way out which you can`t see
I the master killer - strike you down
Can`t be detected, i own the crown

Your solemn sanctuary has become mine
Crawl upon your victims - see the tears of fear in their eyes
Watch them bleed, see as they writhe in pain
No one will answer
I`ve taken your mind and soul
Only escape is your fucking grave

I am the master killer - fall to me
Pray for a way out which you can`t see
I the master killer - strike you down
Can`t be detected, i own the crown

The end has come for you at the cost of your life
Now i stand atop the mountain, my killings have no end in sight

I am the master killer - fall to me
Pray for a way out which you can`t see
I the master killer - strike you down
Can`t be detected, i own the crown
