Looking down the barrel of a gun, see the light flash before my eyes
Facing fear, fear in discipline, another night time to pay the price
Just two steps closer to the attack
Unleashed is their rage in doubt fight back

Life is pain
Life - is fucking pain

Twisted minds begin to behold what's wrong or right
Eyes lighten for me to see hypocrisy your life and i
Pity what`s in your heart as the world will bleed
`cause i`d rather die on my feet than live life on my knees

Life is pain
Life - is fucking pain

Crucified - not a way to live suffer too much pain
Agony - implies there is no end
Prisoner - with no way to escape i say my dying grace
Eulogy - for the dead hatred taken place
Suppress the anger look for another way
Damned if we need this count to continue at this rate
Genocide inflicting just more than one race
Hideous behaviour can`t continue at this pace

Life is pain
Life - is fucking pain
