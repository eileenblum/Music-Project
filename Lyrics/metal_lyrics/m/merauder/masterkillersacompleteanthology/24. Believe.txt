If you believe then it can be
All your dreams will become reality
Don't be misled, never settle for less
Confront your fears put them to rest
If you bleed then you gotta believe,
You gotta believe, you gotta believe
If you bleed then you gotta believe...
You gotta believe, you can be more
Than expected to be
You gotta believe, you can be more
Than you'll ever be
If you bleed then you gotta believe

Possessed by power, burning up inside
Hold back no more, time has 
Come to fight
You make a stand against stack odds
The cause is lost but you fight on.
If you bleed then you gotta believe,
You gotta believe, you gotta believe,
If you bleed then you gotta believe...
You gotta believe, you can be more
Than expected to be
You gotta believe, you can be more
Than you'll ever be
If you bleed then you gotta believe

If you believe then it can be
All your dreams will become reality 
Don't be misled, never settle for less
Confront your fears put them to rest
If you bleed then you gotta believe,
You gotta believe, you gotta believe
If you bleed then you gotta believe...
You gotta believe, you can be more
Than expected to be
You gotta believe, you can be more
Than you'll ever be
If you bleed then you gotta believe
