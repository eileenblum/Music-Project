41 shots rang out loud
4 fuckin' pigs to bring
A righteous man down
Like mad dogs
Tearing at its prey
The lead starts to spray
No time to pray
Pop-pop-everywhere in the
Neighborhood
Burn people out of their homes at night
Say that we're a waste and up
To no good
Just stand there wrapped
In your sheets of white

Stand united - we must defy them
41 reasons - eye for an eye
41 reasons - these pigs must die.  41

Detained just for the skin
I was born in - color's not a sin
You don't know where I've been
Or even care if I live
Pop-pop-everywhere in the
Neighborhood
Burn people out of their homes at night
Say that they're a waste and up
To no good
Just stand there wrapped
In your sheets of white

Stand united - we must defy them
41 reasons - it's time to rise
41 reasons - these pigs must die.  41
