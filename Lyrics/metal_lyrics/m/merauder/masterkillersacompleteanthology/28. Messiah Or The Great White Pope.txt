Here comes the plague of the great white Pope
With his crew of devils sailing on Satan's boats
Discover and conquer that was their mission
In the name of Christ and his so called religion
I'll never consecrate his name
I'll never celebrate his fame
I'll never bend to be of the flock
I see your light and it's the devil's flame
Caught in the wake of the great messiah
To purify our soul from desire
Shedding our blood in vein say it's the Christian way
How can a loving God bring so much pain
I'll never consecrate his name
I'll never celebrate his fame
I'll never bend to be of the flock
I see your light and it's the devil's flame
Here comes the plague of the great white Pope
Who built an empire on stealing people's hope
You ask for faith, compassion's the mission
And beg forgiveness for your own afflictions
Here comes the plague, here it comes
Forgiveness for your own afflictions 
Here comes the plague here it comes
Forgiveness for your own affliction
