Please forgive us for we know
What we've done
Abuse of your love
What's done now is done
Can never replace what was
Taken from you
We know the truth but we 
Still hate you
We're the one's who chose to deny
In life nothing but lies
We know you're dying inside
Bleeding wounds, still we pass you by

Now on my knees and I don't please
Don't punish me for those who
Made you bleed
Did you not know they cannot see
Without you we could never be
We're the ones who chose to deny 
In life nothing but lies
We know you're dying inside 
Bleeding wounds, still we pass you by
Nothing but lies,
We put the tear in your eye
Feeding you nothing but lies
Below the surface of your skin
Infections sink deep within
