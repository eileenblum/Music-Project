I am the most high
Tonight's the night I decide
Whether you live or die
Tonight's the night I commence to ride
Into warrior souls
I'll make you tremble
Your blood runs cold
Still you will never know
Till my blade swings so low

No warning

I am the final sign
Before the end of your pathetic life
No chance to beg or cry
Gone in a blink of an eye
Chop you down so mercilessly
I watch your head roll
Hellspawns that follow me
Engulfed in death storms give you

No warning
No warning for the dead

I am the most high
No warning - for the dead
No warning - frozen flesh
No warning - now you regret
No warning - pools of red
No warning - for the dead
No warning - frozen flesh
No warning - now you regret

No warning
