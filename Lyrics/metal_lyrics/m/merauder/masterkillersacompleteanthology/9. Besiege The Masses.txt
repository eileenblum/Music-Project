Pestilence epidemic of hate
Betrayed by friend, master of lies
Besiege the masses
Forbid bigotry, no need to start again
Freak nature has taken his mind
Lost in society's pace
Growth of violence, lack of thought
Leading to horror, anger dispelled

Pacifist needed to judge the accused
Sentenced to life, sinner gone to hell
Fallen psychotic reasons
Destiny prison entombed

Expel fools for pain and suffering
A felon with evil on his mind
Furlough the wrong way out
No one to suffer again

Pacifist needed to judge the accused
Sentenced to life, sinner gone to hell
Fallen psychotic reasons
Destiny prison entombed

Creator, creator
Understand how i feel, i want this man to die
Creator, creator
He takes all these lives, just an eye for an eye
Besiege the masses
Besiege the masses
Besiege all the masses
