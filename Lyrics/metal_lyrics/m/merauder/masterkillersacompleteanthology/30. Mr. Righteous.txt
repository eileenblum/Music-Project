Mr. Righteous I see you heading down my way
Preachin' and preachin' but no commitment
To what you say
New days new ways but your game remains the same
Crush the life of believers for your own personal gain
Time has come for you to fall we won't be misled
We can see through your eyes they won't burn me again
Try to sell me something you'll never be
To the faithless of my soul how can you do this to me
Mr. Righteous I see you heading down my way
Approaching with a grin and a soul so full of sin
Another plan to persuade another plan to dominate
Betrayal is the game that you play
My vengeance is your fate
Time has come for you to fall we won't be misled
We can see through your eyes they won't burn me again
Never will your eyes burn me again
Never will I fall into your ways
Never will your eyes burn me again
Never will I follow your plan
