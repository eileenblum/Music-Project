Now you're in way too deep
You made your bed punk now
We'll put you to sleep
Thought we would never get the news
Thought we'd never come for you
Been too many times around the block
We seen it all son, you better stop
From trying to seek props from our name
Try to gain yourself some fame

Did you see it coming, payback

Now the time has come to pass
We've come to settle up and kick your ass
Bad karma's coming to pound
You're a mutt and you're going down
Stick your tail between your legs
Just the thought of me makes you beg
Talk about pride and respect
Muthafucker that's my foot on your neck

Did you see it coming, payback

Lesson learned, the price was met
Shut your mouth cause you know what you'll get
When you see me walking down my streets
Pay your respect, don't make me repeat

Did you see it coming, payback
