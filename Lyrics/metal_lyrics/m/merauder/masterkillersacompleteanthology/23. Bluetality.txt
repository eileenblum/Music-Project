You shine the light to
See my eyes - to blind me from
The truth you lost
You confront to control when 
Nervous laughter takes ahold
We the people must unite and rise to 
Protect the freedom God provides
Live in peace and let the freedom reign
Ensure the legacy of forefathers slain

I see a tin man standing there,
With his steely stare acting like
He Don't care.
I hate to be the one to break the news
But we're human beings and we 
REFUSE
No more - we've had enough
No more - we'll have our say
No more - the time has come
To fight the raid of bluetality
Bluetality

Hide behind the laws that were
Meant to protect
Use your bluetality to make me confess
You can break my bones but
My spirit is steel
One look in your eyes and
Your evil is revealed
I see a tin man standing there
With his steely stare acting like
He don't care.
I hate to be the one to break the news
But we're human beings and we
REFUSE
No more - we've had enough
No more - we'll have our say
No more - the time has come
To fight the raid of bluetality

One day the sun will shine
On the face of all mankind
God will grant victory
And rid the world of bluetality
