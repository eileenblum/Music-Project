Govern the minds, the ones controlling their dreams
Engage in war, object to reign supreme
Leading the lives of many just to lay to waste
Apprehensive ways in which to dominate

Capitalism
Always first in the line
Damnation
Destroying mankind
Monetary gains
Politician`s course
Government`s greed
To take by force

Technology wasted minutemen do they play
Political sanctions are now underway
Descension strikes, stability not known
Anti-christ of belief they shall behold

Capitalism
Always first in the line
Damnation
Destroying mankind
Monetary gains
Politician`s course
Government`s greed
To take by force

What have we done, we`re fighting everybody`s war
We`ll pay for them and defend yet they ignore
Legislation intact they`ll send us on our way
Religious beliefs are digging all our graves
Screams of agony subconscious brutal dreams
Death at his side, blood sheds into streams
Trading lives for money, economical fall
Live to fight the billion dollar war

Capitalism
Always first in the line
Damnation
Destroying mankind
Monetary gains
Politician`s course
Government`s greed
To take by force
