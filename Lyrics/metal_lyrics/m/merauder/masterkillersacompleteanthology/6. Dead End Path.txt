Look into my life`s past for what has become
My adolescent future is over and down
I asked for a life of both pleasure and pain
All this i`ve lost in the fight in which i`ve never ever gained

I`ve been led down a dead end path
Exposed and alone
How long can this last, i think to myself, will it ever fold

Now i try, i`m trying to be more of a man
I want to hold my hand a dream i won`t disband
The life which i asked for of both pleasure and pain
I`d give it all up just to fulfil one of my life`s dreams

I`ve been led down a dead end path
Exposed and alone
How long can this last, i think to myself, will it ever fold

I can`t believe i believe in you
All impressions lost
Your paths of deception led by innocence
Controlling nature causes me to crumble
For the light at the end of the tunnel is my way out
I asked for a life of both pleasure and pain
All this i`ve lost the fight in which i`ve never ever gained
I`ve been led down a dead end path
Misled down a dead end path
I`ve been led down a dead end path
I am alone
