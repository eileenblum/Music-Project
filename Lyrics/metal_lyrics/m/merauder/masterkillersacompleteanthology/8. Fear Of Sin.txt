In the beginning of time when god created the universe
All men and women placed to gain knowledge of the earth
They were born to freedom, the right to choose what they want
Through the years they learned so much something may come back

Fear of god
The time has come
Fear of sin
Judgement day`s begun

Death rising in the sky, warfare destroying millions of lives
Environmental overkill, toxic waste overflowing landfills
Starving nations hunger across the land, aids limiting lifespan
Watch out, soon you'll see it's time to meet your destiny

Fear of god
The time has come
Fear of sin
Judgement day`s begun

Devastation now coming forth, the time has come to meet our fate
The freedom of choice which has put us in this state of pain
Peace in the world which is only one big lie, resurrection of the past
And then you die

Fear of god
The time has come
Fear of sin
Judgement day`s begun
