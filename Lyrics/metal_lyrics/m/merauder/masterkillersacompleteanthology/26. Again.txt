Hard times that blow my mind, 
Feel like I'm gonna stray
Ruff times fuckin' my soul,
And I'm the one that takes it
All the times that I have died 
All the times of my suicide
All the times you saved my life 
You're the one who made it right

Taken day by day - taking it all away

You're the one that kept me at bay,
Won't let me stray,
Brought me back from the dead - again

Ruff times that blow my mind, 
Feel like I'm lovin this pain
Sometimes I try to survive,
But I end up in my own shit
All the times that I have died
All the times of my suicide
All the times you saved my life
You're the one who made it right

Taken day by day - taking it all away

You're the one that kept me at bay,
Won't let me stray,
Brought me back from the dead - again
