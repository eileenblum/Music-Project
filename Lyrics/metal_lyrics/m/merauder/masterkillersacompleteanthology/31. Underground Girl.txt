Sometimes I just can't understand
Why you would wanna be a victim of a fad
Fashion's such a drag
I wanna see the type of girl for me
The kind of girl that's on my scene
Some got hair in pink and blue
Pierced nipples and rock tattoos
Combat boots that stomp the ground
Our scene girls they wear the crown
Yes sir, I love my underground girl
Girlie shirts a tummy ring
Standing next to me moshing
Some are big and some are small
I don't care I love them all
Yes sir, I love my underground girl
I see plastic chicks on the t.v.
Running through the waves
Bouncing balls of silicone,
I just flick the screen
I wanna see the type of girl for me
The kind of girl that's on my scene
