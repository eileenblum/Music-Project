Divine intervention preaching your solemn holy words
They place their faith as you pawn their trust away
Advantageous ways that you get paid

Your mirror shows black
I see your pain
Your mirror shows black
I see your pain

Abolishment of present, past and the future
Karma has returned your way
Full circle attack, signs of penance you lack
It`s the price he paid for his judgement day

Your mirror shows black
I see your pain
Your mirror shows black
I see your pain

Enter my world, no holding back on you
You`ll bleed as i bled
Recognize the disgrace you`ve placed on our fucking race
Trust displaced as my heart fills with hate

Your mirror shows black
I see your pain
Your mirror shows black
I see your pain
