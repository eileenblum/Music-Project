Criticize - the ones before you
Immortalize - the men with the force
The powers that be try and take control
In confrontation with democracy
With the rise and fall of a nation gone to hell

As you try and steal the world your time ends
As you try and feed the world all but lies again

Defenceless are those who become their prey
Giving on demand to forge a war
Thinking nothing of it as you lose face
Looking indirectly into the rise and the fall of a nation gone waste

As you try and steal the world your time ends
As you try and feed the world all but lies again

Slaughter of the innocent - dying for their cause
Dead and buried bodies - accumulate from their wars
Symbols of the righteous ones - they think the world`s their own
Apocalypse of reality - in which they behold

As you try and steal the world your time ends
As you try and feed the world all but lies again
