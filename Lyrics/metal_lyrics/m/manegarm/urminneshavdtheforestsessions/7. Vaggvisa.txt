En isande vind
far fram genom skog och dalars hem
Fryser ben och mÃ¤rg
Krossar drÃ¶mmar, rÃ¶var dem

Sov nu, lilla vÃ¤nnen min
DrÃ¶m ett litet sinnes drÃ¶mmar
Vid elden stillhet rÃ¥der
HÃ¤r ditt folk vakar Ã¶ver dig

Men i forna seders mull gror livets frÃ¶ igen

HÃ¶r nu vargen yla, kallar pÃ¥ sin sort
Inget svar i vinden ges
Hans slÃ¤kte nu fÃ¶rdrivits bort

Livets trÃ¥d nu tvinnas
MÃ¥ din vÃ¤v bli seg och stark
Ty hÃ¥rda tider stundar
Livets rÃ¶tter kÃ¤mpar i frusen mark

Men i forna seders mull gror livets frÃ¶ igen

[English translation:]

[Lullaby]

An ice cold wind blows through forests and home of valleys freezes bone and marrow crushes dreams, robs them...

Sleep now, my little friend dream the dreams of a small mind it is quiet by the fire your people watch over you...

But in the soil of old customs the seed of life grows again...

Now hear the wolf howl calling its kind there is no answer in the wind his kin now driven away...

The thread of life is twined may your weave be tough and strong for hard times await the roots of life struggle in frozen ground...

But in the soil of old customs the seed of life grows again...
