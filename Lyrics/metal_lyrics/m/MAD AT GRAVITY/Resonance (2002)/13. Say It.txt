For all the times that I apologized
With humbled head and weeping sighs
I find the times I tried to hold the lie
With sweaty palms and knuckles white
I need you to say it. Say it.
I need you to say it
The look on your face will betray it.
Say it
For all the times I knew the stakes were high
But shuffled feet and folded hands
I find the times I tried to fight the tides
On slipping stone and shifting sand
I need you to say it. Say it.
I need you to say it
The look on your face will betray it.
Say it
This inconsistency goes away
When I can hear what you have to say
I need you to say it. Say it.
I need you to say it
The look on your face will betray it.
Say it
For all the times that I apologized
With humbled head and weeping sighs
I find the times I tried to hold the lie
With sweaty palms and knuckles white
