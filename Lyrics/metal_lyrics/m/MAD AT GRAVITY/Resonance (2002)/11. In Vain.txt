Minds 
(It's cold outside)
Will go unbroken 
(Close the door)
Thoughts
(Once complete) 
Will fade away 
(Never more)
I'm reaching to find
The words to define
The feeling entwined
In every aching line
In vain
I'm waiting
Here at the end
The urge to defend
The meaning in trend
Will never let me bend
In vain
Words 
(It's cold outside) 
Remain unspoken 
(Close the door)
Hands 
(Once complete) 
Will soon decay 
(Never more)
I'm reaching to find
The words to define
The feeling entwined
In every aching line
In vain
I'm waiting
Here at the end
The urge to defend
The meaning in trend
Will never let me bend
In vain
Can you hear me?
Do I speak in vain?
Don't leave the light on
Slumber becomes you the same
I'm reaching to find
The words to define
The feeling entwined
In every aching line
In vain
I'm waiting
Here at the end
The urge to defend
The meaning in trend
Will never let me bend
In vain
Can you hear me?
Do I speak in vain?
