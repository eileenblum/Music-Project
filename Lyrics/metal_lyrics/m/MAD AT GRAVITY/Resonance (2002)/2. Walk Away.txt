Find me
I'm falling
And fooling myself that it's flight
Imperfect
I plummet
And ponder
Pushed away on principle
Walk away and I stare
Would you stand me up again?
Wonder if I've said too much
And we'll never speak again
Forfeit
My future
For feelings of few far betweens
Mindless
Of merciful
Measures
Making ends preempt the means
And I searched your eyes for an answer
And shuddered at what I found there
As my skin shrunk away from conclusion
That you lack the strength to care
Walk away and I stare
Would you stand me up again?
Wonder if I've said too much
And we'll never speak again
This is the way it has to be
That you would turn your back on me
And you and I should walk away
Walk away and I stare
Would you stand me up again?
Wonder if I've said too much
And we'll never speak again
Never speak again
Never speak again
