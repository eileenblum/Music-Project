All I know is fading
Anxiously awaiting
Furtively frustrating 
Endlessly parading down
All I feel is falling
Clutching sky but stalling
When the past comes calling
Will it seem appalling now?
Historypeats 
Flows through clean sheets
Born to be broken
Memory fades
From black to grey shades
Born to be broken
Will you remember this?
All I know is older
Look over your shoulder
Though the nights are colder
Still I'm growing bolder now
Historypeats 
Flows through clean sheets
Born to be broken
Memory fades
From black to grey shades
Born to be broken
Will you remember this?
Will you remember this?
Through blackened eyes
I realize
Foresight's only 
As far as you can peer into the past
Historypeats 
Flows through clean sheets
Born to be broken
Memory fades
From black to grey shades
Born to be broken
Will you remember this?
Will you remember this?
