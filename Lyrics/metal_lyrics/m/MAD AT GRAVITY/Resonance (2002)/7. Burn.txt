These embers burn down low
And with my face aglow
You are all I know
Set this place on fire
Let the flames rise higher
And as they reach the ceiling
At your feet I'm kneeling
Drawing ever near
My cause revealed as clear
I burn for you here
Set this place on fire
Let the flames rise higher
And as they reach the ceiling
At your feet I'm kneeling 
With every trailing plume,
Know it bears me home
I would give it all
I would give it all
I would give it all
I would give it all
Set this place on fire
Let the flames rise higher
And as they reach the ceiling
At your feet I'm kneeling 
With every trailing plume,
Know it bears me home
Let it burn
Let it burn
