We soldier on 
Through hell's high water
This war's a losing fight
The past is gone
The future further
Retreating out of sight
And after the fire has died
Will the light still remain in your eyes?
We twist and turn
With pains unmentioned
To speak is suicide
The hunger fades
With malnutrition
When tears and tongues collide
And after the fire has died (Let the fire die)
Will the light still remain in your eyes? (Turn to ashes)
And after the darkness has swallowed every sign
Will you still be there undefined?
