You cannot hide
Your pedigree
Don't call me cynical.
I can't provide
A guarantee
Don't call me cynical.
Time and time again
I'm finding a better defense
The crime I charge against
Reminds me to check your intent
I won't retreat
I will not bend
Don't call me criminal.
Inform defeat
If I offend
Don't call me criminal.
Time and time again
I'm finding a better defense
The crime I charge against
Reminds me to check your intent
You never get something without sacrifice
You never get something for nothing
So name your price
Time and time again
I'm finding a better defense
The crime I charge against
Reminds me to check your intent
Time and time again
Time and time again
