If I told you 
That the crowd was all ears,
Could you find the words to say?
If I told you
You could take home the prize,
Would you know the game to play?
Would you laugh or would you fall to pieces?
Would you lie or would you run?
If I told you
You'd the world on a string,
Could you tell which way to pull?
If I told you
That your life was a glass,
Would you know when it was full?
Would you laugh or would you fall to pieces?
Would you lie or would you run?
Would you fight or would you roll right over?
Would you blaze or fade away?
Creak and crumble
Reel and stumble
Fall to pieces
Would you laugh or would you fall to pieces?
Would you lie or would you run?
Would you fight or would you roll right over?
Would you blaze or fade away?
