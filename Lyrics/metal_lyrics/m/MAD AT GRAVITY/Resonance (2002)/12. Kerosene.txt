Please excuse my ignorance,
But isn't this what men strive lifetimes for?
The price is high, but consequence
Of spinelessness will cost much more
Kerosene
Carry me
If my faith gives way I have nothing. 
Nothing.
If I lose my grip I've gained none at all.
Please excuse my arrogance,
But where do you think inspiration lies?
Hate the life, love the depth
Shovels can't be sanitized
Kerosene
Carry me
If my faith gives way I have nothing. 
Nothing.
If I lose my grip I've gained none at all.
