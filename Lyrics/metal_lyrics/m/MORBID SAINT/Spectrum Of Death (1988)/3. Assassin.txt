Killing and leading a life
A life that was chosen
Feeling you cannot feel pain
For those you have murdered
Laughing there is not a soul
That can take you alive
Dying not only until you've
Taken your own life
Living on the deaths of others
Your identity unknown
Killing not even for the money
There is no mercy shown
Bloody figures, contorted bodies
In your mind you shape
You must escape reality
You live to assassinate
Escape, escape, escape
You take life so seriously
You don't even know
You'll die today
You'll die today
Making rules that we all choose
But in the end we all will pay
No one knows or even cares
Death the only answer for hate
Taken it upon himself
The assassin will assassinate
Hatred burns through death's cold eyes
The pain is so intense
Cannot fight
Cannot fight the pain inside
From him there's no defense
You won't hear him call your name
Once he's got you in his sights
Your life and death's the same
Living in a world of fear
Your name's been chosen by the one
Who will assassinate
There's nowhere to run or hide
You can't escape
He'll leave your body
Lying in a sea of red
Feel the fire burning inside him
He must kill or die
Doesn't feel no pain for you
He knows your life's a lie
Hatred burns through death's cold eyes
The pain is so intense
Cannot fight
Cannot fight the pain inside
From him there's no defense
You won't hear him call your name
Once he's got you in his sights
Your life and death's the same
Evil wicked twisted mind
He doesn't know the reason
Cannot understand his feelings
Deep inside to kill you
He will not rest until you have been
Erased from existence
Beaten down sadistic torture
On their way to kill you
As the crowd rumbles
And you're lying there dead
The assassination is complete
The assassin laughs
To himself with relief
Your deceitful mind
Has just been beat
You lied to us all
And didn't care to explain
And now look at you
You are dead
They can't help you no more
The life's been drained from your soul
Through the bullet hole in your head
Run, run to the sun
Burn, burn in the rain
Lightness turns to darkness
They had you living through this hell
Where you cannot control the lies...
