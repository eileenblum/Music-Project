Kill the white rabbit before it kills you
It lives on the weakness inside
Touching your soul with a pure emptiness
See the spectrum of death in his eyes
Scars
Demoralization intrapping your mind
Post addicted life is the hardest to live
Putting your faith in one lessthan God
Is a sure way to a fast early grave
Keeper of the keys reopens up the lock
The door leads from Winter to Spring
The monarch of sadness is now  overthrown
Insecurity once was king
Scarred denial will take your fuckin' life
Your arm is an altar of flesh
Depths, you're sinking, they can't be described
Seal your wound with the rest
Scars
Horse draws a figure
In black self homicide
Inferior forces will lack
Never ending suicide
Scars, scars, scars of an ancient wound
Scars, scars, reopen insanity
Scars, scars, stir the dust from your tomb
Scars, scars, controlled substance anarchy
Cheated your life, drawn nearer to death
Forging your grave with a lie
Breaking down walls ever growing in size
Child mutation, your breath be denied
Scars
Intoxification, the hammer of spikes
Blind creation slaves growing in size
Living of death with one foot in hell
Eternal damnation, altered substance refined
Failing pressure needs environmental shock
Enter the tomb of thee undead
Modern day express decides how far you fall
No one can feel the fear you dread
Violence seeking tortures in the night
Welcoming the pain, injecting death
Hidden from the light
Ever living in the dark
Life is a never ending test
Scars, fuck you
Horse draws a figure
In black self homicide
Inferior forces will lack
Never ending suicide
Scars, scars, scars of an ancient wound
Scars, scars, reopen insanity
Scars, scars, stir the dust from your tomb
Scars, scars, controlled substance anarchy
Weakened belief, no freedom from pain
Beating what lives from me inside
Clenching the fist spawning terror
Uprise greed, a river
Death growing in size
Scars
Manipulation, the slaughter of faith
Distorted your mind
Lost your rights
Censoring ways, never freedom of choice
Eternal damnation, altered substance refined
Seller of disease, contaminated cock
Feading on corruption in the streets
Total blackness, embedding grave of stone
No longer for the pleasure, It's a need
Scarred denial will take your fuckin' life
Your arm is an altar of flesh
The depths you are sinking
They cannot be described
Seal your wound with the rest...
Scars, you're dead
