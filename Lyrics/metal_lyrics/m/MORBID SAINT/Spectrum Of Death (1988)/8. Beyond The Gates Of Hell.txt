Blackened tomb twists the key
Hellish pit awaiting me
Judgement day forever gone
Sinful tortures just begun
Beyond the gates of hell
Lurking in the dark forever
I will be beyond the gates of hell
In the pit the pain he gives
Laughing at my plea to live
Magic circle which I dwell
Take me now, my path from hell
Sabbath ritual which I'm in
Paying for my first born sin
Internal soul will never rest
Body and mind creation possessed
