Dying to live a life
That is real
No one can imagine
The pain that I feel
Vulgar impressions
Of death in my mind
Insane intentions
For victims I find
Can't take - the pain for much  longer
Can't take - the life that I lead
Can't take - the pain it grows  stronger
Can't fake - my mind is soon dead
Crying for death
I feel no pain for you
Pounding vibrations
Of death in the air
Crying for death, no mercy
No agony, crying for death
Feeling the fingers of
Death on your throat
Stricken with terror
My fingers so cold
Grasping reality
Your life on the line
Look into my eyes
Now you are mine
