Free your minds and listen
We're fading from existence
No excuse to lose our minds

Fear of obsoletion
Sweeping through the nation
Losing track this is our time

As the sun will rise upon a brand new day
The rays will come and burn our fears away
Taking on our lives with our heads held high
High with pride

We'll never
Surrender
Forever
We'll be strong, keep holding on together
We will be strong forever

Fading in the distance
With all the fear within us
Loosing track of all our time

Fear of devastation
Creeping through the nation
Making us deny what's right

All, we're one for all
Crushing through the streets
The weak with fall
