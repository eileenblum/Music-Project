Feel the sun break through the water
Floating on all its colors
Feel the life spread through your veins
Feeling high, time to fly

If you could see me now
10.000 miles and still rising
Can't even see the ground
My beautiful horizon

Listen to the pale horizon
Like phantom ships across the night blue sky
Visions will be stabilizing
Everyone will see your starving eyes

Feel my eyes begin to open
Soaring high, on the skyline
Feel the rain fall on my face
It's my time, time to fly

Explode, explode and watch as we go
Like stars on the night sky
Go, go out into the world
Keep dreaming together

My beautiful horizon
