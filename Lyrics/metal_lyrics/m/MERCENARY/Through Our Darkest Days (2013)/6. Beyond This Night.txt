The light reflects on my skin
I turn away to hide myself within
In black and grey
Eternally I hide myself away

Is death the only resolution?
Escape from all the confusion

We try to find the light
We try to find the reason
To see beyond this night
Alive

We paint the world in deceit
We realize we can no longer hide
Inside this dream
A fantasy of man's insanity

Is death the only solution?
Or can we fight the confusion?

Embrace your life
And take your time

Nobody ever said that this would be easy
Nobody ever said that this would be easy
