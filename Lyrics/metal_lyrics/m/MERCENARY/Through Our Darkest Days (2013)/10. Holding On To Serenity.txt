[Bonus Track]Every day we fight the system
Tearing holes in our existence
All the same, all the same
Give it up, we are all the same
All the same
Just give it up

Losing your rights
Falling from innocence
Trying to fight
Trying to conquer the world

This humanity
A new design
Abnormality

No remorse, no guilt, no victims
One for one we fail to fix this
All in vain, all in vain
Face it, it was all in vain
Cause all is the same
Just give it up

Losing your rights
Falling from innocense
Trying to fight
Trying to conquer the world

This humanity
A new design
Abnormality
Holding on to serenity
A new divine
In normality

We fight the system
The new resistance
We are the new world order
The hand to guide us further
In line we take a stand
To fight and fight we shall
And we will fight
Till the end of the night
As the new dawn sees the light

This humanity
A new design
Abnormality
Holding on to serenity
A new divine
In normality
