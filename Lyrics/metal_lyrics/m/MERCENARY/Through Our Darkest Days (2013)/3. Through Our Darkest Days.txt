Fall into submission
A turning point in life
A fight against suppression
To keep the dream alive

As your heart is racing
Sweat running down your face
United in damnation
Divided by our fate

Never surrender
Reach for the stars
Marching on forever
Through our darkest days
The brighter the flame
The deeper the shadows

As the crowd is stomping
Their masses crack the ground
The sound of pure enjoyment
This moment so profound

Feel the darkness rising
What you're seeing is what you get
Fighting for the alliance
The brotherhoods of fate

Never surrender
Reach for the stars
Marching on forever
Through our darkest days
The brighter the flame
The deeper the shadows

Marching on forever
Through our darkest days
The brighter the flame
The deeper the shadows
