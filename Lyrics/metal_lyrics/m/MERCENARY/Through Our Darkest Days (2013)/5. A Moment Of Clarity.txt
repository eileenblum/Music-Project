Feel the sunlight
The rays are burning my skin
Embrace the day in respect
Live life and never forget

Every day could be the last one
See the world before it's gone
As the shadows fade to grey
The past is slowly washed away

Live life to never regret
Take all the chances you get
Live for today in the moment
Seize every second and own it

A silent whisper the winds carry away
Like patterns in the sand we're washed away
Lost in this world without faith to guide us now
And we're hoping for salvation
And we're falling in damnation
We are calling you

Every day could be the last one
See the world before it's gone
