We're never gonna get out of this alive
So we might as well enjoy ourselves tonight

Make us forget all, regret all and let us neglect
Break all and take all and drink all and let us inject
Bring on the guilt trip

We are the generation
Generation hate
Self-indulging madness
Degeneration hate

Blame everyone else for our mistakes
Refusing to show anybody respect

Take all and fake all and stand tall, refuse to accept
Break up and make up and take shots to earn some respect
Bring on the new shit

Sit back and look at the world in dismay
As we waste our lives
On hate, despair and decay
We walk a path
Of shattering blindness

We hate
What we don't understand
We hate
What we refuse to accept
