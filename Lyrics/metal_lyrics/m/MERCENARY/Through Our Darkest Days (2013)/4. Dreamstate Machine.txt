Walking the path of damnation
A crossroad of pain and deceit
Crossing the many dimensions
Only to meet your defeat

Nailed to the cross
Facing your final hours
Your blood unto the crust
Of the earth

For so long I've been waiting
For the day to come

In a state of make-believe
You seem to be
Taking on a new belief
Adapting to the scene
What is true
Why can't we see
We are machines
Hiding from reality
A numb routine

Why should they remember
So many denying defeat
The known become the strangers
The strong become the weak

Nailed to the cross
Facing your final hours
Your soul forever lost
You'll fade

For so long I've been waiting
For the day to come

In flames
The world will be imprisoned
Degrade, fall to devastation
Reborn, the world unto decay
Torn, we give our life away
Into deformation
We are falling
Enter desolation
Burn, we will all burn
None, no life forms will remain
No, we will all burn
No...

[Chorus]
In a state of make-believe
We seem to be
Taking on a new belief
Adapting to the scene
What is true
Why can't we see
We are machines
