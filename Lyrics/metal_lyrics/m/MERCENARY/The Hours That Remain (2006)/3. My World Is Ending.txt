Take all that I believe in
Give it a simple name
Reveal all my secrets
And drown me in the shame
I will redefine
The questions of the night
And I will purify
Forgiveness and the light

It's falling into place
In clear perspective
My deepest tragedy
The world is ending
So now you speak to me in perfect silence
Don't take my soul away
My world is ending

Don't ever speak to me
To find your salvation
I know it's hard to be
And exist in culmination
I'll take your soul away
Destroy it and molest you
And I will set you free
Don't give your heart to me

It's falling into place
In clear perspective
My deepest tragedy
The world is ending
So now you speak to me in perfect silence
Don't take my soul away
My world is ending
The world is ending
My world descending
