To free these
To be these
To feel these hands
No direction
Teach me
Connection
Within my soul
I'm drowning

Laughing I dream this
Nightmare eternal
Forming confusion
Feeling so lost you're...

Never alone but silent
Walking towards horizons
No one to frame but you

To form
the line
To be
The only one that's left to free
You
From you
Just you
Erase this nightmare of conformity

Into the overflowing of free decision
Choosing a new way
Losing yourself

Lay down my distraction inside my circle of being
Show me purpose and drift towards the surface

In my sleep I fall down in deeper
Into the sea of dark desires you're...

Never alone but silent
Walking towards horizons

Holding onto shades of something
Bleeding on the road I walked before
Watching as my pale memories fade
Into nothing... and nothing begins

I just can't escape this feeling in my head
It feels like going around in circles
And all I can really relate to is the person I used to be

Never alone but silent
Walking towards horizons
No one to frame but you

To form
the line
To be
The only one that's left to free
You
From you
Just you
Erase this nightmare of conformity

Into the overflowing of free decision
Choosing a new way
Losing yourself
It's fading in
