Feel this illusive dream that's growing
Flowing into view
Take this immense participation
Is it really you?

Fall back, my secret window
Feel free to let me lose
My mind, my mind

Twisting I feel abandoned
Look back to set me free
To purify, to purify

It makes me want to scream, to fall out of this dream,
It makes me want to find the things I thought you wanted
It makes you want to try to leave it all behind
The time that still remains I'll use to redefine me
Find me...

Now all that's left with me this feeling
Am I all alone?
Stretching I cannot see you clearly
Am I losing you?

To speak I'll try to save you
Feel free to let me find
My innerline, my innerline
Have you simply lost the answer
Will you take the hand I give?
To redefine, to redefine

This illusive cry
I AM
Your secret window
I AM
All that's left with you
I AM
Redefinition

I am losing you
Fading in, you're fading out

I'll redefine my dreams in the hours that remain
I'll try to understand, to redefine myself.
