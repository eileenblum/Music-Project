Seen in your perspective
It's falling into place
It's being interactive
And falling down from grace
Be neglective or selective
It's all that makes you see
The hours that remain

To fall disgraceful
To be alone and
Believe in the time to be divine

Fighting the hours is all that remain
Searching for answers and feeling the pain

This timeless glass before me is running out of mind
Is falling into nothing
And is all I left behind
Be neglective or deceptive
To redefine the dreams
In the hours that remain.

To choose deception
To see the gain and
The rose the answer
Enjoy the pain

Fighting the hours is all that remain
Searching for answers and feeling the pain
And holding out my hand to find you to see through the rain
My motionless demand to see my true face through the blame

I'll teach you
Revelation
I'll go through
Hell
To greet you
My friend
And to meet you
In the end
... I'll save you.

Fighting the hours is all that remain
Searching for answers and feeling the pain
And holding out my hand to find you to see through the rain
My motionless demand to see my true face through the blame

...
Behind my smile, my memories are fading.
The time is near. The hours remain.
