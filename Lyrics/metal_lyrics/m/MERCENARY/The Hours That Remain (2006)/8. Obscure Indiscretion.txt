Don't let them drown you in fame
Construct or form you from shame
Feel the time is closing in

Fortune! Fortune!

Obscure indiscretion
A heartfelt confession
A needless reflection
We have no direction

If you could see me
Right now
Would you believe me?
Somehow
Feel the world is forming you

Fortune! Fortune!

Obscure indiscretion
A heartfelt confession
A needless reflection
We have no direction
This futile rejection
The poison deception
This state of regression
Will show me connection

[solo]

Obscure indiscretion
A heartfelt confession
A needless reflection
We have no direction
This futile rejection
The poison deception
This state of regression
Will show me connection
