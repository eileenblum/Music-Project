This is it
The final place to falter
To see the destination
To be the one who makes the final call
We rise to fall
This is where we clear the path to freedom
To gain the new horizon
And bleed onto the road we lost before
So rise to...

Save me
My miracle
To escape the way we feel
We bleed and rush
To say goodbye
Fly through
My window to
Free what's left behind
We fall and rise to feel alive

Save me my miracle
Take my doubts away and fly through my window
I'll rise and fall through you

And so we we speak
To feel a little less neglected
To reach the final chapter
And understand
The answers that you hide
To build the final structure
And fight the desperation
We'll meet the one
We had to leave behind
So rise my friend to...

Save me
My miracle
To escape the way we feel
We bleed and rush
To say goodbye
Fly through
My window to
Free what's left behind
We fall and rise to feel alive

Save me my miracle
Take my doubts away and fly through my window
I'll rise and fall through you

[solo]

Save me my miracle
To escape the way we feel we bleed and rush to say goodbye
Fly through my window
To free what's left behind
We fall and rise to feel alive

Save me my miracle
Take my doubts away and fly through my window
I'll rise and fall through you
