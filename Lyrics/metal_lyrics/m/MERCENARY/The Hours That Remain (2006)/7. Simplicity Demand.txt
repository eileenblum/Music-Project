You have to believe me
Surrender completely
I want you to be near
I'm all alone here
Feeling fragile and confused
But your absence will make me choose
And the tailors of time have
Washed away my friend

My friend...

If you could see me now
As I really am
Would you believe somehow?
Simplicity demand
If you could see through me
As I really am
What would you want to say?
Simplicity demand

Don't try to erase me
Destroy or molest me
And don't you dare to pretend to care
About my new-found meaning.
You'll have to believe me
Surrender completely
To accept that you're lonely
And drift towards the end

My friend...

If you could see me now
As I really am
Would you believe somehow?
Simplicity demand
If you could see through me
As I really am
What would you want to say?
Simplicity demand

Hear me calling
Save you from falling

If you could see me
As I really am
Would you believe me?

If you could see me now
As I really am
Would you believe somehow?
Simplicity demand
If you could see through me
As I really am
What would you want to say?
Simplicity demand
