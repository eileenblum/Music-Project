This is the year of the...
This is the year of the...
Plague!

This is the year of reflection
deception
And feeling the fear of rejection
Come through my connection
A glance to the year of

Trying to see you
To be true
Believing
The time is here
My memories are fading
Save me my...
Plague!

Enter my place of despair
Direction
The meaning of total redemption
You fake my salvation
A dream in the place of

The time, the place
The plague is here!

Behind the smile
My memories are fading
The time is here
The hours remaining
