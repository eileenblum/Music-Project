The one that makes me stronger
Still pulls me under
Leaves me on my knees
The one
That makes my heart beat
Still makes my soul bleed
Bleeding piece by piece

You see
I am your destination
Where you always want to be
A heartfelt emotion
Cast aside and then I feel

Lonely
We are not alone
Only
Nothing to atone
Someday
I hope I hear you whisper
Always, always
I do, now we've come this far

Never make mistakes
As long as loneliness awakes

The one
Simply completes me
Still don't believe me
Even though I know
The one
Is still under my skin
Still makes my mind spin
And turns me upside down

And still our lives passes by
Day after day, we never speak
Sometimes we start to wonder why?
But then we're going back to sleep

And then we fall to pieces
We are lost in loneliness
Close your eyes, believe this
We are one, one

Lonely
We are alone
Only
Nothing to atrone
Someday
I hope I hear you whisper
Always, always
I do, now we've come this far

Never make mistakes
As long as loneliness awakes

Lonely
We are alone
Only
Nothing to atrone

The one that makes me stronger
Still pulls me under
Leaves me on my knees
The one
That makes my heart beat
Makes my soul bleed
Bleeding piece by piece

The never ending misery
Of living life in loneliness
Seal my eyes and leave me
I am one

Lonely
We are alone
Only
Nothing to atrone
Someday
I hope I hear you whisper
Always, always
I do, now we've come this far

Never make mistakes
In life we dedicate
Our souls to someone else
Laft dangling by ourselves

Only
Lonely
Only
Lonely
Only
Lonely
Only
Lonely
