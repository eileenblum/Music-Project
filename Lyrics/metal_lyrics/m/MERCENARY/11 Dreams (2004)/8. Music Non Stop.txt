[Kent cover]

Everybody gets a second in the sun
I have a feeling mine has just begun
Music non stop when I close my eyes
Clarity born from such a compromise
And you're almost like me

So why don't you dance to the music
I hear inside my head
Why don't you dance to the music
It's the soundtrack for the end

I'm looking for a place to lie in wait
I quit my job to find a perfect fate
Music non stop when I close my eyes
I need some time alone and I found a carpark that is home
You're almost like me

So why don't you dance to the music
I hear inside my head
Why don't you dance to the music
It's the soundtrack for the end

Everybody gets a second in the sun
I have a feeling mine has just begun
Music non stop when I close my eyes
Clarity born from a compromise
And you are almost like me

So why don't you dance to the music
I hear inside my head
Why don't you dance to the music
It's the soundtrack for the end
Why don't you dance to the music
I hear inside my head
Why don't you dance to the music
It's the soundtrack for the end
