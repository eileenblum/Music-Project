My imagination
Leaves a contradiction in my soul
Still the situation
Has left me searching high and low

Human touch
A machine that man created
ReDestructDead
That's why I hate

Everlasting rain
Upon my window
Whispering my name
Dreamer
To cast a silent shadow

Lightning strikes again
The sky is blood red
Thunder wind and reain
I'm reDestructDead

Now my aggravation
Turns on me like nightmare tales untold
Never my intension
The sunlight shining, I'm still cold

Turn your face
And walk the other way
Don't look back
Look back in sympathy
All these years
I've been living in solitude
No more tears
Whatsoever I still hate

Everlasting rain
Upon my deathbed
Whispering my name
Dreamer
I'm reDestructDead

Lightning strikes again
The sky is blood red
Thunder wind and reain
I'm reDestructDead

As the seasons change
And the moonlight's gone
I will try to

Burn the bridge
And make me confident
Tear at my skin
Behind this decadence
All this time
There's no one left for me
None divine
And forever I will hate

Everlasting rain
Upon my window
Whispering my name
Dreamer
To cast a silent shadow
I'm reDestructDead
Everlasting rain
Upon my deathbed
Whispering my name
I'm reDestructDead
Lightning strikes again
Lightning strikes again
The sky is blood red
Thunder wind and reain
I'm reDestructDead

Into the rain
