Come closer
I dare you to fall asleep

Cross my heart and hope to die within my sleep
As I believe I'm being stalked inside a dream
I start to run, my legs are numb, I beg you please
My blood dries out, my body's cold, the rivers freeze
The rivers freeze

Helplessly I lie in wait for what may appear before me
And desperately I seek of thee; spare my soul, deceiver

Steal my heart
Then take the rest of me
Free my mind
Let me float away
On this feeling
Even though this insanity
Seems to me reality
Take my final thoughts away
Leave me be on my deathbed

Fade away
My dying day
The fever takes control
Deceiver takes my soul
Light the sky
This dying night
The flaming torch will burn
The path of no return

I seek revenge as I escape the maze within
I need the key to turn the lock that holds me back
Then I am free, fast asleep
I walk in dreams, firesoul hang on to me
I'll make you scream
I'll make you scream

Helplessly I lie in wait for what may appear before me
And desperately I seek of thee; spare my soul, deceiver

Falling into you
Dreaming
Trying to find you there but
Even though this sanity
Seems to me reality
Take my final thoughts away
Leave me be on my deathbed

Fade away
My dying day
The fever takes control
Deceiver takes my soul
Light the sky
This dying night
The flaming torch will burn
The path of no return

Firesoul

In my sleep I fall in deep
Into the sea of dark desire
Haunting me, stalking me
Helplessly, I'm still dreaming

In my sleep I fall in deeper down
Into the sea of dark desire
Haunting me, stalking me
I'm helpless
Watching me
In my sleep stilll dreaming

Cross my heart and hope to die within my sleep
As I believe I'm being stalked inside a dream
I start to run, my legs are numb, I beg you please
My blood dries out, my body's cold
The river's frozen

As I swim through you, my fire soul
Swims through me and
When you stole my heart you took control
Let me float away
On this bed I lie awaiting you
Take me with you now
Still asleep I wander in your dreams
I'm deceiving you
Take control as my blood dries out
On this dying night
On this dying night
