At night the voices speak through me
To me
Sets my mind adrift, it floats away
Slowly
Dragging me down unconsious
Sleep tight my dear, I've come to kill
If I can't have you, then no one will
It gives me the thrill

Into the everlasting grace
In the mirror I'm the man without face
Only the name's been changed

Candlelight upon the blade
Whispering now it's time again
My knife bleeds with desire and anger
My hand shakes, can't hold on much longer
No, it's time for us to become

One, we are
One, we've become
One, we are
One, sharpen the edges once again
One, we are
One, we've become
One, we are
One, sharpen the edges once again
Prepare the pain

You look so peaceful
Now you're gone
So please forgive me
I've done wrong
And still the voices
Are calling me
Back in the shadows
I belong again

Into the overflow
In the mirror I'm the man, I don't know
Even though my name's the same

Candlelight upon the blade
Whispering now it's time again
My knife bleeds with desire and anger
My hand shakes, can't hold on much longer
No, it's time for us to become

One, we are
One, we've become
One, we are
One, sharpen the edges once again
One, we are
One, we've become
One, we are
One, sharpen the edges once again
Prepare the pain

Sharpen the edges
Sharpen the edges
Sharpen the edges
Sharpen the edges
Sharpen the edges
Sharpen the edges
Sharpen the edges
Sharpen the edges
