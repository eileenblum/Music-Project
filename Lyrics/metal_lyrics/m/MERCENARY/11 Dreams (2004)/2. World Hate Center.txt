Now do you feel respectable on the cross?
Hanging by the shred of life that we lost
Greet the pain, meet the nails
That we thrust into your chest
Now it's time for you to repay us

Never judge me
It fuels my hatred
Join the searching
And lead the bloodshed

We will track you down and nail you
Unto the cross with thorns
We will do this with precision
Make sure you'll regret you were born
Only when you ask forgiveness
We may pretend that we care
Yeah sure
You my friend represents the sickness
And we shall be the cure

We shall be the healers of our time
Strike back, twice as hard then proceed
Can you feel the hate that flows divine
And soon the world belongs to me

Never judge me
It fuels my hatred
Join the searching
And lead the bloodshed

Now you bow your head in shame
So where's your power, sinner
Your weakening becomes my gain
And this you shall repent
Alas the hourglass of life
Is destroyed beyond repair
Never ever speak my name
Or I'll cast you in despair

Beware
I'll cast you in despair

Save your soul
In a world hate center we reign
Save yourself
In a world hate center of pain
Save them all
In a world hate center we're torn

Now do you feel respectable on the cross?
This time the world belongs to us
