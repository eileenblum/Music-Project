In times without changes
Changes in life
Life without reason
Wondering why

Why keep searching
Seeking someone
Someone to guide me
My guiding light
Guiding light

I know the answers
And you know who I am
Tell me your vision
And take your stand

Times I remember
All of my lies
One through eleven
My memory dies

Times without changes
Changes in life
Life without reason
