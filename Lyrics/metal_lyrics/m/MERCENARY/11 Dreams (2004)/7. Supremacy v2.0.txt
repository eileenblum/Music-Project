As I reflect upon the past
Seven years in hibernation
Breaking the silence at last
What's become of my creation?
Now I can see into the future
By the power of yesterday
Nine six six six
The year of supremacy

Supremacy

Let's die
Let's die

Questions regarding what we create
With the use of technology
Answers are when we start to simulate
The fall of humanity
Fall
Never rise

If you could see into the future
Interactive history
Simulating a new start
Random access memory

We're closer to the edge now
One push and we disappear
There's no need for you to blame me
I'm no longer the one you fear

Raise the flag for me
Raise it real high for humanity
Raise the flag for all to see
Light the sky with burning supremacy

Tear the flag down
Hold your head high

Be your rage
Don't be so hollow
Be your rage
Don't be so hollow

Cyber head put on your mask instead
And hide in three dimensions
Drown yourself inside the shade of red
Feed your inspiration

Inspire me

If you could see into the future
Interactive history
Simulating a new start
Random access memory

We're closer to the edge now
One push and we disappear
There's no need for you to blame me
I'm no longer the one you fear

Raise the flag for me
Raise it real high for humanity
Raise the flag for all to see
Light the sky with burning supremacy

Tear the flag down
Hold your head high

Be your rage
Don't be so hollow
Fly with me
Beyond tomorrow

Now I can see to the future
By the power of yesterday
Ask me anything
I'll tell you everything
All the details in my memory

We're closer to the edge now
One push and we disappear
I'm the old man warning you
I've been asleep for seven years
Cast aside
My dreams denied
Living each day hiding
Behind the mask, we never rise
Giving in, we're dying

Supremacy, supermacy
You are supreme to me
Supremacy, supermacy
Forever supreme to me
