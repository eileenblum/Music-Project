[Music: Kral / Jakob / Signar]

What a rush...

When we're on stage
You can't do nothing but
Relate to something
We feed the feeling
Of the natural highs
And the God forbode the blood...

Would you separate the truths
Through lies
In the constellation grey
Inner eye

Bloodrush
Running through your veins
Bloodlust
Do you know our names?

Forgotten soldiers
We're soldiers of fortune
Do not deceive us
We'll never retreat...

The blood that flows through you
Is thinner that the wine
We used to dine
With sinners like ourselves
And the God forbode the blood...

Would you separate the truths
Through lies
In the constellation grey
Inner eye
Forever you will bleed
Everblack
And life would surely be
Never bright...

Bloodrush
Running through your veins
Bloodlust
Do you know our names?

Forgotten soldiers
We're soldiers of fortune
Do not deceive us
We'll never retreat...

Explore... the bloodrush
The bloodred highs
The bleeding eye
Explore... the bloodrush
The bloodred highs
The bleeding eye
And the God forbode the blood...

Would you separate the truths
Through lies
In the constellation grey
Inner eye

Bloodrush
Running through your veins
Bloodlust
Do you know our names?

Forgotten soldiers
We're soldiers of fortune
Do not deceive us
We'll never retreat...

(As we sat around the table
Drinking the blood from our glasses
What a rush...
Than Jesus said to me
I can cure you my friend...
If everything else fails
I'll show you the way
Out of the darkness
And into the light)

Show me the way
Bleeding the trail
Don't be afraid
Lead me again
