[Music: Jakob]

After all
The way you wanna live like this
And all along the way
It was meaningless

Nevermore
Will I gain the same
The hiding of your shadow
The feeling is fading

Faster...
Forever, forever after
The burning sensation
The turning temptation

Screaming
Screaming from the heavens
Would sweep the global
Disease, I'm hopeful

Fire
Bleeding desire
The burning sensation
The turning temptation
Faster
Forever, forever after
The burning sensation
The turning temptation

Screaming from the heavens
and down upon thee
In tears of sadness

(The shadow makes me forever dream)

No...

After all
The way you wanna live like this
And all along the way
It was meaningless

Nevermore
Will I gain the same
The hiding of your shadow
The feeling still fading

Faster
Forever, forever after
The burning sensation
The turning temptation
Screaming
Forever, forever dreaming
Of the heaven
The bloodrede heaven...
