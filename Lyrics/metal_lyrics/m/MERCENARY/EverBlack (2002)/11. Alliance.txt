[Music: Kral]

Shoulder to shoulder
In union we stand
The power brigade
Blasting all the way through the God's land
Side by side
It's the alliance we've planned
If anyone falls, it should be hand in hand

Side by side
Join the alliance
Side by side

You came to see us rock, rock hard
We penetrate the barrier
Of noise that never stops, not now
Join the mass crusaders
And be forever free
From evergreens and neverblacks
In all eternity
We'll keep the flag from burning
Like this

One more time
Join the alliance
Partners in crime

(The mission is simply this
As you enter enemy territory
Hold your weapons high
May God have mercy on your soul)

Cursed be the man
Who is not in the mass crusade
Stretching the banner
That's five miles wide
Blessing the flag
That is fifty feet tall
Kissing the ring
That burns forever your name
Eye to eye
With the alliance in flames

You came to see us rock, rock hard
We penetrate the barrier
Of noise that never stops, not now
Join the mass crusaders
And be forever free
From evergreens and neverblacks
In all eternity
We'll keep the flag from burning
Like this...

Cursed be the man
Who is not in the mass crusade
Shoulder to shoulder
In union we stand
The power brigade
Blasting all the way through the God's land
Side by side
It's the alliance we've planned
If anyone falls, it should be hand in hand
