[Music: Jakob]

Now I know, where to go
The miles are many
But I'll get there
In the fast lane
Full speed ahead
Down by the green line
And never red

Brakes are burning, adrenaline
2000 miles or more, on through the night
To the limit, I shall fly
It's my destiny, my final ride

Darkspeed, I trusted thee
Believe in me
Nightsight, inverted backwards
It's a dream

On the run
The road keeps on turning, away
Now I'm gone
Forever you'll be searching, for me
How many heartbeats take lightyears
At darkspeed, look to the skyline
And bleed all you need

Still I wonder, how I got here?
On  the frreway it happens every year
To the limit, I shall fly
It's my destiny
The final ride
The final ride...

The road is burning
At the rate of darkspeed
You'll never find me
Dark ashes to ashes
You can eat my dust
Swallow you may
Spit it out if you must...

On the run
The road keeps on turning, away
Now I'm gone
Forever you'll be searching, for me
How many heartbeats
Take lightyears at darkspeed
Look to the skyline
And bleed all you need
On and on
The road keeps on turning, away
Now you'll be
Searching darkspeed
