[Music: Jakob]

Join me

... The dark ...

Welcome to the Unaited States of Neuropa
Welcomes you all
Here's plenty of place for all
The criminals
United we fall...

For the military union
Someday we'll wonder
What happened to our kingdom?
It's a tragedy
No...
Won't you join us
In the mass destruction
And the wildlife reduction...

Futuristic futurama
We're caught up
In this dramatised way
Strategies of hate
It's a steady regression

For the final settlement
We're the winners of nothing
Soon disconnected
And the sinners of something... else

Won't you join us
In a darker shade of black
And a brighter shade of grey
The authorities
Must not be notified
'Cause then the media
Will be terrorized

Fall the military union
Someday we'll wonder
What happened to our kingdom
Seems so far away
Deeper into oblivious
A night like no other
Share my passion
On this lonely offer

Won't you join us?
In this monetary union
The continetal mission
Now, now won't you join us
Won't you join us?
In a darker shade of black
And a brighter shade of grey
Some day
