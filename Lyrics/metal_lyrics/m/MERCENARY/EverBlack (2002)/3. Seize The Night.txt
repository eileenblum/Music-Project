[Music: Kral / Jakob / Rasmus]

Nosferatu...
Gone in six six seconds, ticking away
As the sun soon sets
The corner stone of my regrets
The shadow shades me alwaus...

I am reduced to darkness
The burden I never lost
Nocturnal heartless
I've never seen the day

Like father like son
I inherit the chronicle
The heritage continues
Like mother like daughter
The witches of underworld
Burned at the stake a long time ago

So now I hunger
For the taste of new blood
I am the lonely hunter
Come follow me as I...

Seize the night
The epidemic awakes me
In transformation
I spread my wings, and drift away
Draculation
The countless necks, I have poisoned
Carpe nocte
I've never seen the day anyway

I close my eyes to what's not there
I think it's strange you never knew

Silently watching
from my steel black coffin
My arms lay crosed
I await another flight
That takes me one step closer, to light
The smell of blood enchants me

I am reduced to darkness
The burden I never lost
Like a poison ivy
Come follow m? as I...

Seize the night
The epidemic awakes me
In desperation
I spread my wings, and fly away...
Draculation
The countless necks, I have poisoned
Carpe nocte
I've never seen the day anyway...

My soul perished, as my mirror reflection vanished
Been born 2000 years ago
I'm the brother of Jesus...

The shadow that shades me
And keep me forever black
The light surrenders upon my domicide
The cross of Christ
The twin that blinds my bloodshut eyes
Like garlic that penetretes my skin
Awaken me

Everblack
You never spoke to me
Your demon heart
And your evil ways

Seize the night
The epidemic, awakes me
In transformation
I spread my wings, and drift away
Draculation
The countless necks, I have poisoned
Carpe nocte
I've never seen the day anyway...
