[Music: Jakob]

(You will follow orders
Obey my command at all times
Or you will be punished)

Spikes...
Spikes yeah
And you're gonna get'em

As I crept away
From the sun in the sea
Who would you betray?
Cretaintly not me

Because I'm restless master
Just like you teach your slaves
The massses join in laughter

Land of the free
Home of the slaves
Pictures of peace
Blessing the graves
Come follow me
I'll be the one
Setting your free
From dead.com

Shot down by a 12 gauge
Shotgun, never feel safe
Struck hard by a spiked fist
Cold blood runs down your face

As your hate grows stronger
Towards the one
You're underneath
Not far from going under
Don't wave your rank at me

Because I'm restless master
Just like you teach your slaves
The massses join in laughter

Land of the free
Home of the slaves
Pictures of peace
Blessing the graves
Come follow me
I'll be the one
Setting your free
From dead.com

Come dead

Don't wave your rank at me...

Because I'm restless
Just like you teach your slaves
(Shot down)

Shot down by a 12 gauge
Shotgun, never feel safe
Struck hard by a spiked fist
Cold blood runs down your face
Just like you teach your slaves...
At the masters grave

Land of the free
Home of the brave
Pictures of peace
Blessing the graves
Come follow me
I'll be the one
Setting your free
From dead.com

Land of the free
Home of the brave
Pictures of peace
Blessing the graves
Come follow me
I'll be the one
Setting your free
We're all in line creeping in pain

(Dead calm
Dead calm...
Come dead)
