Wait for me you prejudist
Wait for me you prejudist
Hate for me we used to live here
admit the ones the ones that

failed to weep
weeping oh it's wrong to speak
for all that sleeps
not knowing the preachers bleed
the hiding or escapade
seems not too far from here
the lost one the planet 8
admire the distant fear

alone we're on our own
give me the number 3:21
symbiotic it's the same old shame

oh no...
are you dealing with the same hand
tell me now will you recreate the same plans

the pain plan which we
never knew one bit about
behind our backs we stabbed
backstabbing the same old game

oh no...
are you dealing with the same hand
tell me now will you recreate the same land
watch me die
watch me dying with the same screams
hear me young 
hear me young with the same dreams

the pain dreams
