horizon
do you remember
the time of winter
when we were so young 
horizon
standing on the edge of time
hanging on to friends of mine
now release me and stand in line

we are moving closer to 
deceit and all is solitude
so be a part of the new start
'cause he wouldn't go this far as the

sun is still burning
the planet's still turning
now we're so old 

horizon
will you recover
will we discover
see the blood red 
the blood red skies

you the listener you'll be a witness
you're the witness you'll need an alibi

we are moving closer to 
deceit and all is solitude
so be a part of the new start
'cause he wouldn't go this far as the sun

see the blood read skies
and the dried out seas
no one gives a damn 
that's what worries me
witness the woods demise
and the greyish air
people died like flies
forever....

by far

sinking like a leaking ship
shivering body makes me drown
open up your mind to me
and I'll open up your mind to you
tell...
do tell...

horizon
do you remember
the time of winter
when we were so young 
horizon
is it still burning
the planet's still turning
now release me and stand in line...

see the blood read skies
and the dried out seas
no one gives a damn 
that's what worries me
witness the woods demise
and the greyish air
people died like flies
forever....
