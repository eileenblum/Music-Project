it's now 3:21 PM on the planet demon8
operation cleansweep in progress
the black-eyed enemy must be destroyed
and the master game is completed

escape!!!
embrace yourself
now you ain't got a way
for me to see this 
inscripted in clay
retaliate

45 tears drifted away
take a look back flashback and see
69 years now senile and grey
visions of the past nightmares

stop
and turn your head around
can't stop from feeling
there's someone watching me
someone is stalking me right now
escape with me 
through the dark starred galaxy

done it's done
it's done and all you care about is one
and that's yourself

still you ain't got a way
for me to see this
inscripted in clay
embrace yourself

converted as we move along
as long as we don't move alone
predictions that cannot go wrong
caution to the wind

stop
and turn your head around
can't stop from feeling
there's someone watching me
someone is haunting me right now
escape with me 
through the dark starred galaxy...galaxy

stop
and turn your head around
can't stop from falling
there's someone pushing me
someone is killing me
oh God it's the truth I swear
I'm dead you see
through the bright light we'll meet
we'll meet again
we'll meet again
the night turned to day
helping me show the way
the seasons would not change
and the reasons stay the same
