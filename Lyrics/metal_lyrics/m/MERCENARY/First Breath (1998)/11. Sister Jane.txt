I had my hopes
I had my pride
you have your sight
I have no eyes
my mind is tangled
my throat is strangled

as a blind man to man
so sad you'll never see
as the silent man I am
pity yourself and let me be
if you could be my sister Jane
maybe once but never twice
read a book or feel the rain
feel the rain falling down on my skin

my only thoughts
confused and crazed
mirror please
I can't see my face
give me my cane
oh what a shame
you always laughed
on my expense
I never asked
for anything
I can almost feel it
I just can't believe it

as a blind man to man
so sad you'll never see
as the silent man I am
pity yourself and let me be
if you could be my sister Jane
to what extent I never change
walk around without my cane
hear me out in your dreams
in your dreams

from the first breath I took
and to the last kiss I shook 
was it my mistake
no envy swines relate
breaking signs in a broken place
waking up to a certain fate
I'm living my life I guess
I'm living my life

as a blind man to man
so sad you'll never see
as the silent man I am
help me please set me free
if you could be my sister Jane
only once and not again
find the man claim the cane
silent man without a name
