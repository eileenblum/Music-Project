world wide weep
world wide weep
suffer in silence
in a world complete outside

inside four walls I reign
the spinning dome
outside my own domain
the weeping clone
you'll never wake me
or steal my throne
the lost opinions lost in time

world wide weep
double you double you
world wide weep
it's gone too far

create your life for something better than this

than this biotechnique
darkness to
your schizophrenic
you you and you
I'm not your saviour
nor am I
do me a favour
tell me lies
tell them twice

world wide weep
double you double you
world wide weep
you've gone too far

create you life for nothing lower
than this

and the world weeps on

for Christ's sake

creeping on the internet
the last one we ever knew
you'll never travel on in time
the wrong doing of man
and the world shall weep

dream on optimistic
human waste
you're made of plastic
some disgrace ha
you'll always see me in 3d
you could not be me
in your dreams

world wide weep
double you double you
world wide weep
we went too far
too late to live for anything stronger
than this life lost
