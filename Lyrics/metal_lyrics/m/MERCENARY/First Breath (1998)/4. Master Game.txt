Hope
Try not to hate me in the dominion
deny yourself this or meet thy fall
stretch your banner i'll break your kingdom
do assemble forces now let the game commence

disrespect yourself from all your lies
father by the name would you play the game

pin me down as I am now
bring me down 'cause you won't ever
break me and my sinful crown
take control and it's all over
pin me down as I am now
bring me down 'cause you won't ever
break me and my master tone
fake me and receive your throne

once a pawn is lost 
let the game commence
8x8 on black or white 
now choose your side

disrespect yourself from all your tries
power by the name would you break the flame 

pin me down as I am now
bring me down 'cause you won't ever
break me and my sinful crown
take control and it's all over
pin me down as I am now
bring me down 'cause you won't ever
break me and my master game
beat me and receive your frame

too late 
divide the tribe and conquer them half size
check mate is all you ever seem to be
lost fate sealed away lost the key
just prey steal my mind conquer me now

beyond the line of infinity

bring me down as I am now
bring me down 'cause you won't ever
break me and my sinful crown
take control and it's all over
pin me down as I am now
bring me down 'cause you won't ever
break me and my master game
fake me and receive a name 
in my master game

once across the line you were so divine
now I've seen your gate
check mate
