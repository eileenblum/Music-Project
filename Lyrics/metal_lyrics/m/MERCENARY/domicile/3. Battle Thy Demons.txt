DON'T BE AFRAID
OF THE PRICE WE PAID
IT SEEMED SUCH A LOSS
WHAT THEY DID TO US

TO LIVE WITH HATE 
IS TO DIE WITHOUT PAIN 
THE HOUNDS ARE HERE 
TO SEEK THEIR PREY

YOU CAN REDUCE YOUR LOSS
BUT YOU CANNOT WIN
BATTLE THY DEMONS
DESCENDING FROM HELL
OPEN YOUR MIND
TO THE WORLD OUTSIDE
BATTLE THY DEMONS
THE PRAYER THAT YOU TELL
YOU TELL!!!

THE BATTLE WITH THE DEMONS
SEEMS TO NEVER END
THERE IS A NEW SOLUTION
ENCOUNTING WITH THE DAMNED

NOW IT'S TIME
TO FOLLOW THE SIGNS
INTO THE PAST
THE FUTURE WILL LAST

CURSING THE KINGS O'TIME
PEACE WITHIN MY MIND
LONGING FOR A PLACE
FAR BEYOND THE DEMONS MAZE

AS WE START TO FIGHT
WE HAVE TO REALIZE
THEY'LL LAY YOU DOWN TO REST
DAMNATION OF THE QUEST
