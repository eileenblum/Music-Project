AT NIGHTFALL
IN PITCH DARKNESS
A DARK COMPLEXION
DEVESTATION
ACT OF CONSCIENCE
I AM HERE
OBSCURITY

TOO LATE TO LIVE
TOO LATE TO GIVE
YOUR LIFE AWAY

YOU'RE NOT CONTENT 
WITH THE WAY WE LIVE 
WE LIVE IT TODAY

THEY'LL TRACK YOU DOWN 
HAUNT YOU NIGHT AND DAY 
AND THEN YOU'LL PAY

THEY'LL ALWAYS TELL
YOUR MIND TO PREY
BUT WHO THE HELL 
ARE THEY TO SAY
TO SAY

...OBSCURITY

BURN

JUST ONE MORE THING
YOU'LL HAVE TO KNOW
BEFORE I GO
IS WHEN YOU DIE 
YOUR PLACE WILL BE
DEEP DOWN BELOW
IN THE FLAMES OF HELL
YOU'LL BURN LIKE...WELL
YOU DON'T WANNA KNOW

THEY'LL NEVER TELL 
YOUR SOUL TO GO
BUT IT'S YOUR MIND
THAT DOESN'T FOLLOW 
FOLLOW

LET YOUR SOUL FLY AWAY
TO THE UNKNOWN
TURNING TORTURE TO PLEASURE 
AND PLEASURE TO PAIN
