Self inflicted torture
Wrap myself in pain
Never take a second to think
Of the people I have shamed
Fight to fake emotions
To make me seem alive
But the endless emptiness
Keeps growing deep inside

I can't take this
I can't face this
Life

[Chorus:]
Oh, where is the enemy
Where is the end for me
This is not what I wanted
Oh, every day that I am facing
I feel less alive
One step away from my demise

Never felt pleasure
Never felt content
Every step I take
I'm facing my decent
With blood on my fists
And death in my eyes
Breath thick of liquor
God please let me die

Please let me
Please let me die

I can't take this
I can't face this life

I can't take this
I can't face this life

Are you fucking ready?

[Repeat Chorus]
