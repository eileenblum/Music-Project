Are we meant to live alone
Inside a torn and broken home
No one to hate besides yourself
True human nature
Lights are fading
The whisper of a voice
So low

The silence will haunt you
Now

[Chorus:]
With flames all the pain we erase
From ashes a new dawn awakes
In blood red shades
Humanity is made
Together we choose our own fate

[Postchorus:]
Let the roses fall
Stand aligned
Let them fall
Alone

Piercing sounds fill the cold
Sending shivers through our souls
Inside the dark we shall awake
Again
Lives are fading
The echoes of their screams unfold

The silence will haunt you
Again

[Repeat Chorus]

[Repeat Postchorus]

See the signs on the wall
Take your time to see the signs

We let them, we let them fall
We let them fall again

[Repeat Chorus]
