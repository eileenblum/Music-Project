The water is so still
In this flood tonight
Pale moonlight shapes your velvet lies
You turn your face away
Won't even look at me
Echo the silence, you wash away

[Chorus:]
This neglect buries me in shame
Blood red colors spell your name
All the pain running through my veins
Slowly, as I go insane

Fragment of a life turning inside out
Pale moonlight in your dark grey eyes
Fading into lies, as you end this night
Echo of laughter, you wash away

[Repeat Chorus]

Velvet eyes
All the lies inside

This neglect buries me in shame

[Repeat Chorus]
