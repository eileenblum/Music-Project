Enough, can't take it
Is there ever an end for me?
Once sane, driven to madness
Once alive, now so numb

Your voice like nails upon blackboards
The way you scream at me

Was there ever a time I loved you?
Was there ever a time without hate?
No ...

[Chorus:]
Ever bound through hatred
Stuck with you for life
Try to take my honour
And I will take your life

So lost in rivers of madness
No light to guide me ashore

How can we survive
In these hateful times

[Repeat Chorus]

Ever bound through torture
Ever bound through hate

My failed deceit
Burns lies you feed
The sorrow hidden inside you mind
Fragments of hatred
The sin, the betrayal
The love, the denial

Going insane
Insane
Going insane

[Repeat Chorus]

Ever bound through torture
Ever bound through hate
