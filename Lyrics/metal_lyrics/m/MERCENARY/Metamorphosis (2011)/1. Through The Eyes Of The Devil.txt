Let's go

I am disorder, reign the night
I'm spreading terror
Death by my side
I face the never
Clothed in leather

I will never turn my face
And face dishonour
You will never
Put me in the fucking corner

In despair, the fallen sinners
Bow their heads and await their death
Do you see me?
See me now

[Chorus:]
Never ends, you will make amends
The sins of your father are yours now
To repay, through endless days
I'll hurt you in endless ways

I am the pain
I am the needles in your spine
And through my endless torture
My existence is divine
Cut yourself, and you will see it's not a dream
My existence, pure and evil
This is me

In dismay, the broken sinners
Upon their cross
Their life is lost
Do you see me?
See me now

Feel now, the silence filling you
Bleed now, as the needle punches through

It never ends

[Repeat Chorus]
