[North American bonus track]

Like a knife through my skin
Please let the pain begin
Making art from my scars
Pain, ink, and blood unite

I need to feel the pain
To make my strength regain

As we all search for control
To be unique, each our own
Colored flesh for my sins

[Chorus:]
The fire burning
Piercing through my skin
Incorporate your demons
Share your deepest fear
Don't be afraid
Through ink and blood your fear shall erase

The Burning Pain
Color our sins away
For all our sins to repay

The new millennium breed
We all will spread the disease
The fire burns in our hearts
Reflects the light on the scars

[Repeat chorus]

Fight the pleasure
To reinvent
Forever craving the pain again
New art in black and grey
To make my strength regain

The fire burning
Its piercing through our skin
Share your deepest fear
Don't be afraid
Incorporate the lies you have within.
