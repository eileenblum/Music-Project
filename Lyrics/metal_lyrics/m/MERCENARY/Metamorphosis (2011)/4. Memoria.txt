Father, listen
Someone is calling your name
Find me, help me
Things were just never the same

All of the sorrow you left me
How can I fight it away

[Chorus:]
In the silence
Shadows are flickering
In the darkness
My salvation
Beyond this nightmare
Left in sorrow

The sorrow of death
With us it stays
The memory stays

Mother, hold me
Promise you'll never let go
As I'm older life seems so faded to me

All of the moments
Times we can never get back
Seize every moment together
Before it will all fade to black

[Repeat Chorus]

In the darkness
In the silence

[Repeat Chorus]

In the darkness
In the silence
My salvation
Left in sorrow
