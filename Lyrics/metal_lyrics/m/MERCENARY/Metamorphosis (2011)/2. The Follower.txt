Wipe the tears from your eyes
Blood won't stain this house tonight
Fire burns, the heat makes me sick again
Hatred and flames, I fall so hard

[Chorus:]
Follow me now
Into the flame
Follow your heart
Into damnation

Eyes so blind look inside
Never see the truth in me
See the lines on my face
A dirty secret of the human race

I am the Follower
Oh, yeah
I am the Follower

[Repeat Chorus]

Cold, on your own
Facing the signs
All alone

Now I see the possibilities are mine

[Repeat Chorus]
