I fight the bullets sinking in
With a fire in my heart
Because I'll make you eat your words
Again

Oh yes, I feel it's necessary baby
I will never bite the bullets just for you
See my face, they'll never turn it away
'Cause I will be there till it's through
'Cause I believe in you

[Chorus 1:]
See us rise
Again from the Ashes
Take control
Now the days are turning back
Now the lights are fading
Join the black brigade
And march forever

We take the power back
With a fire in our hearts
We make you see the truth
What's real
In time the path will show
The true redemption
The meaning of it all

Oh yes, we feel it's necessary baby
We will never bite the bullets just for you
See our faces, never turned them away
We will be there till it's through
'Cause we believe in you

[Chorus 2:]
See us rise
Again from the Ashes
Take control
Now the days are black
Now the lights are faded
Join the black brigade
And march

Listen to their voices
Never will they fail
Listen to their choices
Never will they fail

As I whisper, the lights will fade
I can hear them calling me
I hide away from what they say
I hide the shame away from me
Away, away
You hide the shame from me
Away, away
You hide the shame from me

Oh yes, I feel more necessary baby
I'll never bite the bullets just for you
See my face, I'll never turn it away
I will be there till it's through
Because I believe in you

[Repeat Chorus 1]

Join the black brigade
And march forever
