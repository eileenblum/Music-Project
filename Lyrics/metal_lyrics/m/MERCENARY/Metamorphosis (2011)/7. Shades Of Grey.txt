Lost in the frustrations
Pale faces pass me by
Eyes too blind to see them
See no future, all is left behind
I will fail
Cut the life out from me, I
'Cause I can't take it
It's lost forever

[Chorus:]
I'll never be the same
I hide away the shame
I'm gonna be the one you hate
And I will fight away the shame

Lust of your damnation
Waiting for the final high
Pray for your salvation
Waiting as your life will pass you by
You will fail
Cut the life out from you now
You can't fake it
It's lost forever

[Repeat Chorus]

I'll never be the same
I'll hide away the shame

Life never let me go
I want to see it all
Forget your past mistakes
And let yourself awake
From the beauty of a single rose
To the night's clear sky
Don't let is pass you by
Take it all inside

[Repeat Chorus]
