HE LED ME THROUGH ILLYRIA
ALAS THE DAY OF RECKONING
IS UPON YOU ALL
YOU BELONG TO ME NOW
THE WORD OF THE BEAST

SHE POURED HER SOUL 
INTO THE SEA 
FACE TO FACE MY MEAN MACHINE 
THE KINGDOM WAS ECLIPSED 
THEY BITE THEIR TONGUES 
IN AGONY 
EVERY HUMAN BEING DIED 
YES THE SOUL THE SOUL TO SEA
THEY CURSED THE HEAVENS
SO THEY DID 
THEY BURNED THE VILLAINS 
WORSHIP THE BEAST

COUNT THE NUMBER OF MY NAME

FILLED WITH 
BLASPHEMOUS FLAMES
THE SCARLET BEAST
SEVEN HEADS WITH HORNS
THE PENALISED SMOKE
INTO ETERNITY

ONE-EYED MAN...KING
ONE-EYED MAN...BEAST
IN THE LAND OF THE BLIND 
THE ONE-EYED MAN 
SHALL BE THE KING

HE LED ME THROUGH...KARAN
SO THE DAY OF RECKONING
IS UPON YOU ALL
YOU BELONG TO ME NOW
THE WORD OF THE BEAST

I TURNED AWAY NOT TO SEE
FACE TO FACE ENEMY
EVERY HUMAN BEING DIED 
YES THE SOUL
THE SOUL TO SEE
THEY CURSED THE HEAVENS
SO THEY DID 
THEY BURNED THE VILLAINS 
WORSHIP THE BEAST
WORSHIP THE BEAST!!!
