THIS IS A TRUE STORY 
OF A FRIEND I ONCE KNEW
IT'S AN AUTHENTIC 
AND TRAGIC STORY CALLED...
THE HOUR OF GRIEF

RAGE

FROM BROTHERS TO DRUGS
A MAZE OF CONFUSION 
BETRAY YOUR LIES
I HOPE YOU ARE LOOSING 
FIRST TIME OUT AND ALL IS WELL
IN MY HEAD THE DEMON DWELLS
THE DEMON DWELLS

THE PSYCHO INSPIRATION LEADING MY BRAIN
FROM DARKNESS TO DESTRUCTION
YOU'RE LEAVING ME...

YOU'RE LEAVING ME LEFT TO DIE
THE HOUR OF GRIEF
TORMENTED SOUL IN ME
WHEN I BEGIN TO SEE
THE HOUR OF GRIEF

TIME PISSES BY AND I SEE
THIS MAN IS SICK OR IS IT ME
DAY BY DAY
THE PAIN SLIDES AWAY
SOMETIMES LESS 
BUT IT'S HERE TO STAY
IT'S HERE TO STAY

THE PSYCHO INSPIRATION 
LEADING MY BRAIN
FROM DARKNESS TO SALVATION
YOU'RE LEAVING ME...

YOU'RE LEAVING ME LEFT TO DIE
THE HOUR OF GRIEF
TORMENTED SOUL IN ME
WHEN I BEGIN TO SEE
I SEE MYSELF...

THE STORY HAS ENDED

KILLED BY THE LIGHT
FEEL THE DEMONS FIRE
RAPED BY MACHINES
KILLING FOR THE NAME

THE DIARY IS MADE NOW
YOU CAN CRY ALL YOU WANT
NO!!!
