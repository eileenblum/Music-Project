I
Am the essence of ignorance
The destroyer of innocence
Stand by watch you take he fall

And I
I will cut into you my peer
And reveal your darkest fear
As a river of blood you will flow

Look into my eyes
I am the one
I will defy

Looking into an endless mirror
Seeing nothing the end becomes clearer

Feel me now as I (Your soul and your dignity)
Steal some how the fall and I (Your system will fail)
Make you surrender
As I surrender

Now
Now the silence begins my friend
It's the cold, dark and bitter end
Stand by watch it fade watch it fall

Now
Now your fear is reality
All your dreams you will never see
Endless darkness surrounds you now

Is it cold now, my friend
Can you feel it?
This is the end

Looking into the endless never
Seeing into the darkness forever

Feel me now as I (Your soul and your dignity)
Steal some how the fall and I (Your system will fail)
Make you surrender
As I surrender

Your soul is mine!

Feel me now as I (Your soul and your dignity)
Steal some how the fall and I (Your system will fail)
Make you surrender
As I surrender
