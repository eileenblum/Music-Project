So now I turn my face
And see you cry
Ad thus I crawl
Crawl in line

I raise my hand and try to
Speak but I
Feel so numb

I lost my soul today and I'm...

Lost to all salvation
Failure is my name
My voice is all but silent now and I
Turn away from
Hoping
Hoping
My head is all but empty now and I
Hold on to your lie

I raise my head and see you
Once again
You're losing faith
Losing faith
I picture all you told me it's frozen
In my mind
Slow decline
Slow decline

So you scream
And I see you
Failure I will believe
My life is all but lose

Failure I will listen
To a mind that's broken
To reach the path unspoken
To see what I have chosen

Failure I will listen
To a mind that's broken
To reach the patch unspoken
To see what I have chosen
