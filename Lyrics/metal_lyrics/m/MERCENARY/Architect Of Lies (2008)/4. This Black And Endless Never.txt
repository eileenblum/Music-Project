I am falling
To see what's left behind
I am fallen
To you I must be blind
Is this the blinded calling?
Is this the mindless falling?
It's me
It's me
Open your mind
And please forgive me when I die

I am the Architect of Lies
Into the nothing I will fly
This black and endless nothing
The white and pointless something
In me
In me

To be nothing
To have an empty mind
To be lost and
To see the truth benign
Is this the path I'm choosing?
My friend I think
I'm losing
To you
To you

Open your mind
And please forgive me when I die

I am the Architect of Lies
Into the nothing I will fly
This black and endless nothing
The white and pointless something
In me
In me

Enter my selection
I will show you desolation
You will fall
You will fall
You will fall
You will fall

I am mind
I am

I am the Architect of Lies
Into the nothing I will fly
This black and endless nothing
The white and pointless something
In me
In me

I am the Architect of Lies
Into the nothing I will fly
This black and endless nothing
The white and pointless something
In me
In me
