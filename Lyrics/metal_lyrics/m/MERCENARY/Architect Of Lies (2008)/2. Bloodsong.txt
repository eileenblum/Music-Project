Through the dreaming lights
Into darkness of nightmares
To the endless hollow
I shall go
From happiness to sorrow
From something to nothing
From the beginning to the end

You see my truth and see my name
I will believe in you and you will succumb to me
See my truth and see my name
And I will know you
And I will drain you dry

All is fading
All is lost
The endless never
The blood night
The darker shadows
And the darkest night
The endless never
The blood light

As my life fades out
As death kicks in
Will I regret my life
Of sin
From punisher to punished
From master to slave
To my endless grave

You see my truth and see my name
I will believe in you and you will succumb to me
See my truth and see my name
I will believe in you and you will succumb to me
See my truth and see my name
And I will know you
And I will drain

All is fading
All is lost
The endless never
The blood night
The darker shadows
And the darkest night
The endless never
The blood light

Take me away
Far from this day
And let me stay
And believe in my shadow

All is fading
All is lost
The endless never
The blood night
The darker shadows
And the darkest night
The endless never
The blood light
Fading black
The endless never...
Fading black
The endless never...
