Turning the nights, into your darkness
Dreams of the never, screaming for more
Searching for answers, searching for meaning
Searching for life, as your life fades away

Turning your answers into your lies
Twisting the truth, the truth you deny!

Grasping to this
Hope I have
In between my dreams
I dream

Free in this maze
Calling you
In disgrace
Falling

Falling through lies, falling through pain
Into the night, you're falling through rain
Into the never, darkness forever
Feeling the cold, the shameful shiver

Feeling the shame, you are becoming heartless
My friend you lost, execution style!

Grasping to this
Hope I have
In between my dreams
I dream
Yeah!

Free in this maze
Calling you
In disgrace
We will fight
To believe
In ourselves
'till we die trying

[The Architect speaks:]
"I've never felt sorry for anything that I've done, other than hurting my family
Only thing I feel sorry for
I'm not looking for forgiveness, and I'm not repenting
No. I'm wrong. I'm wrong
I do want my family to forgive me
This would never be me, this!
You see the Architect cry, not very macho but...
I've hurt people that mean everything to me
The only people that mean anything to me"

And so you fail
Being so frustrated
You will fail
Try to set your mind free
You will fail
Turning empty pages
Life is stale
Time will only show

You've taken all my dreams away
Destroy yourself and let it fall astray

Free in this maze
Calling you
In disgrace
We will fight
To believe
In ourselves
'till we die trying
