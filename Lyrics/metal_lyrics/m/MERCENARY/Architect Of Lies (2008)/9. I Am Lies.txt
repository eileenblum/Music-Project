This is where it ends
And this is where it all begins
So step right along my friend
I will let you know my name

Disappear in crystal shades of grey
Believe in nothing
Losing all you have in life
Will teach you nothing

You stand alone my friend and I
Will hear you calling out but I

I am
I am
You will be blinded by fame
Enter my selection
Show me desolation
And I will hear your shame
And so you die

And so it all begins
My death connection
You lose your perception
Embrace the non divine

Reappear and speak your final peace
Relieve yourself
Believe in all you see before you
Believe in me

You stand alone my friend and I
Will hear you calling out but I

I am
I am
You will be blinded by fame
Enter my selection
Show me desolation
And I will hear your shame

Lie for lie, I realize
Eye for an eye and the world turns blind
You are paralyzed, nothing to gain
By hiding behind your shame
Creating structures and lies that ruptures
I am the Architect of Lies
Lies
The Architect of Lies

You stand alone my friend an I
Will hear you calling out but I

I am
I am
You will be blinded by fame
Enter my selection
Show me desolation
And I will hear your shame
