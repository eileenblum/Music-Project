Listen
And I'll try make you see
Listen
I'm tired now
It's timeless
And it's growing every day
And frameless
In every way

Free again
Bleed my truth in timeless sand
Free again
I'll believe and understand
Your world
Be your world
Bleed again
I am nothing in your eyes
Bleed again
To regain myself and feel
Your world

Embracing the nothingness and...

In my cold dark emptiness
I will save you
Or repay in recklessness
In the nothingness
To my deep and dark demand
I'll betray you
And destroy your hopefulness
Innerlines
Leading me astray
Inner lies
Taking me away
It's pointless
Shrinking day by day
Eventless
In every way

Free again
Bleed my truth in timeless sand
Free again
I'll believe and understand
Your world
Be your world

Bleed again
I am nothing in your eyes
Bleed again
To regain myself and feel
Your world
Save your wold

In my cold dark emptiness
I will save you
Or repay in recklessness
In the nothingness
To my deep and dark demand
I'll betray you
And destroy your hopefulness

Free again
Bleed my truth in timeless sand
Free again
I'll believe and understand
Your world
Be your world

Bleed again
I am nothing in your eyes
Bleed again
To regain myself and feel your world
Save your world
