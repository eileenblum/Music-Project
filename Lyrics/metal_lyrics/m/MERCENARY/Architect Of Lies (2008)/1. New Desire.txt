Don't speak
Before you start to run
Don't die believing
Silence
Hide it deep inside
To be the question

Turn to understanding
Of the difference in between
To see what lies beneath me
And try to set the scene

Be yourself
Save yourself

My life is fading
All is lost
Turning to see you
My desire

Lay down
You won't be seen or heard
Don't think you're something
Revenge
Prepare to take your stand
Break free the silence

Turn to understanding
And the nothing turns to you
You scream your name but you're voiceless
And the something speaks to you

Be yourself
Save yourself
My life is fading
All is lost
Turning to see you
My desire
Your voice
Inside me
That scream
Still haunts me
And I will bleed your name
I'll reach the point in time
That dream
Still haunts me
The empty
Despair
And I will bleed your name
I'll reach the point in time

I'll bleed your name
I'll reach the point in time

My life is fading
All is lost
Turning to see you
My desire
In disguise
It's incomplete now
Inner lies
My new desire
