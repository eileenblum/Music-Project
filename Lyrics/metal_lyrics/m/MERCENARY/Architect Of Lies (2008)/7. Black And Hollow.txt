I saw you laughing
Saw your tears decay
I heard you speak to me
Washed my smile away

We're failing
It's failing
These twisted thoughts inside of me
They are failing

I can feel this tragedy
Pure and simple tragedy

Grey!

So break my twisted world
It is the only way
And take these chains of gold
And let me die this way
Please believe me
I lost my soul today
My friend it's ending now
There's nothing left to say

I can feel this tragedy
Pure and simple tragedy

We're failing
It's failing
These twisted thoughts inside of me
They are failing

I saw you laughing
Saw your tears decay
I heard you speak to me
Washed my smile away

I can feel this tragedy
Pure and simple tragedy
