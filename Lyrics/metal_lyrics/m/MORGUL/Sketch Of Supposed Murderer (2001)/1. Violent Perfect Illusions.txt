It's a fucking discrace how the sane and unable rule the world
I need to disconnect and scatter my violent perfect illusions
Catastrophic mind error, ghastly, bizarre, spiteful, vengeful, hateful, a mind set on
destruction
Dominion of Antichrist, Amen!
Would you not hate the sea that's drowning you?
Would you not curse the woods if you were lost?
I cannot see the moon nor the stars
Only the icy touch of an endless ocean
And I am so alone, so alone
No one knows my misery
You will learn, you will feel,
I'll take you with me into the depths of insanity, misery, to hell.
