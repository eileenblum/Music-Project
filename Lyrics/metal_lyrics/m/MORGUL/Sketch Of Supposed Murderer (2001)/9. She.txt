[Kiss cover]

She walks by moonlight
No one really knows
Enchanted starlight
Never goin' home

I know she's goin' down, goin'
Everybody knows she's so good

Doin' well for others
She doesn't really know
The powers are within her
As she takes off her clothes

I know she's goin' down, goin'
Everybody knows she's so good

Doin' well for others
She doesn't really know
The powers are within her
As she takes off her clothes

I know she's goin' down, goin'
Everybody knows she's so good
