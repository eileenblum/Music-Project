This reeks of pain and cruelty
Misguided flesh and hypocrisy
Mutilated souls thrown back into circulation
Vessels on a black forgotten sea
we all float endlessly with no hope of achievement
Splinters of glass in the whirlwind
A never ending maelstrom of misery
These are the devils
These are the lost children all hideous to behold
This is the race of murder, fucking and misfortune
Here's no peace, here's no rest
Here's only spite and detest
Here's bloodlust and carnage
The bitter taste of existence
A hope of extinction and a dream of hell
I have awaken
I am lost and forsaken
Ignorance is bliss
I blame you for this
You don't know what I do
How I'm fucking you, beating you, trashing you
Tearing your soul apart, I cleanse the world
You don't know what I do
How I'm fucking you, beating you, trashing you
Tearing your soul apart, I see so clearly that I love you dearly
I cleanse the world
