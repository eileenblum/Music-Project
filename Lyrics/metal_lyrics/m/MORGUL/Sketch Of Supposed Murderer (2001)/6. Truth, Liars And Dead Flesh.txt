Please sit with me and listen
I hear a different drum
Maybe you will think twice before you fall asleep
This image reminds me of a whore's attempt to get clean
A beggar's eyes when gold is in sight
Honour in the eyes of a thief, truth in a liar's speech
As real as a dream
As real as painted puppets on a painted scene
I see the great pit
The beast and the eye
Hardly ever listen to what you say
Any colour's fine as long as it is black
I'll die alone, afraid and hated
I'll lie unwanted, unburied and godless
These words remind me that I have to die
