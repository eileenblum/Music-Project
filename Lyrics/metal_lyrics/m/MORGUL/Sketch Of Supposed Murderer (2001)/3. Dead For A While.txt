I am back
Looking not well at all
Empty and hollow
Not what I used to be
Misery made of flesh
I have dwelled in the arms of misfortune
I have been trapped in it grasp
I've dwelled in the arms of misfortune
I've been trapped in its grasp
I've walked the path of disfunction for many a mile
I have been dead for a while
Do you know how they hurt with cruelty?
With such ease and simplicity even in your sleep
And from the other side of sanity
It is like fire burning my flesh, like spears piercing my heart
Confused clowns constantly fucking my mind
Up, down and from behind.
