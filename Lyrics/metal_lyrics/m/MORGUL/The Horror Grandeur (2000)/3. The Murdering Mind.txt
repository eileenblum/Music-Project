I should not mind
if she were done away with
killed or ploughed,
she did not seem to serve a useful end
and certainly she was not beautiful

I have no time to tell you
how I come to be a killer
but you should know, as time will shown
that I am society's pillar

To bleed doth cheer the pensive
and remove the raging fires
bred by burning love.
