Speak... Was I morose
and break this bitter silence... grin and sombre
shatter this fragile glas... I was invisible
with the resonance... miserable
of this voice... undetectable
not mine... nothing
...or even less
Lie

And hide this painful truth... you
tear the cold reality... who sit upon a throne
the reptile's tongue... in the ruin of my soul
with many voices... I make myself
scream... dreadful icons
you... to worship
who steal my sight... scream
and cloud my thoughts... to awake the demons
allready so blurred... of lunacy
by you I am possesed... the beast in my blood

Alas, my heart harbours
two souls
and a thied face I wear on the outside
