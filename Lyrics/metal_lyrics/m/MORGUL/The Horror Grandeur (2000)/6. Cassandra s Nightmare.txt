Worms
o conquering worms
deep in the reeking dirt
the horror, the pain
the shreak of the flesh
the loneliness of the grave

The shattering sound
of the cemetery bell
the silent mourners, and the cold rain as well
ashes to ashes, dust to dust
dead and forgotten, flesh foul and rotten
this grave has no tales to tell

O gruesome death, reaper
eyes darker than the deepest well
sinking deeper and deeper
surely all the way to hell

Bells, bells, ionfernal bells
in a cold black grave I lay
demons howl a crippled song,
of my flesh and its decay.
