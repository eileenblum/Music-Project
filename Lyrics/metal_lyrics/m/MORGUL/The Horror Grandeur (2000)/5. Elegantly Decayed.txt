They shed their precious tears
wept the loss of life
the absence of bright days
unable to see the beauty of death
so elegantly decayed
In long ranks they marched
surely towards peril and doom
and the orchestra played a desolate song
as they willingly went to their tomb
A miserable pack of wrecked souls
all danced to the ghastly graveyard bell
a funeral theatre a heavenly play
but the stage is set in hell
It is for creatures of divine origin
a story allready told
but still this horrid painful drama
is hideous to behold
Disease, disease, disease and pain
by dementia and fever made sick.
