Life is slowing, killing you, It torments you day and night
Night and day, everything is slipping away
'Cause you seek meaning where no meaning can be found
Crawling through existence with arms and feet bound
Your spirit detests the lies you are fed
Where is your pain? In your heart or in your head?
Spread your life on your knees - whipped and beaten
Reduced to a shadow of what you could have been
Always afraid, always hating, complaining, fading into nothingness
Willingly shackled by something that's in your head
Hanged by your neck until you are dead
Weak and forsaken, you plunge into disbelief
A sad end to a life poorly spent
