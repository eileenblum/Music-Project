Grind all my hatred into a solid cloud of pain
From all my anger into a crushing wave
Drowning you in a raging, spiteful storm
Becoming eve with fear, as I take its form
All that you are is all that I hate
The poisonous words you speak, venom that makes you weak
The soul is in chains
Your spirit is fucking dead
No room for prayers when God is in your head
I am the opposite of everything
I am resistance in its purest form
I am the anti that goes against the norm
I am what you don't want to see
Locked in a cage of misery, with blinding lights in your eyes
You cannot see, through the veil of lies
You cannot see, through the veil of lies
