Waiting to be unleashed
The eyes that see from within
Waiting to lose its grip
The mask of sanity, I stare in disbelief
Cannot close my eyes
What have we become
Soulless machines, so cold and lifeless
A malignant tumor
Devouring the planet
The feeling of hopelessness turns into hate
Mass murder, mass apathy, mass destruction
The path spirals down into filth and corruption
Extermination the only solution
Where life becomes an illusion
Mankind deleted, existence completed
A virus erased
Leaving the Earth burnt and defaced
