We all sit down and we're empty in our heads and in our hearts
And we speak but no one understands, no one cares
'cause I hate you all and I wish I was gone, I want to disappear

So we try to make sense but we're hollow and unpure
We turn into lifeless shells and I don't care anymore
'cause I hate you all and I wish I was dead, why won't you fucking disappear?

'cause I hate you all and I wish I was gone, I want to disappear
And I wish I was dead, I want to be fucking dead, why won't you fucking disappear?

We all spoke the same words and the same thoughts kept coming back, I wanted to understand
But now I can't take it anymore
