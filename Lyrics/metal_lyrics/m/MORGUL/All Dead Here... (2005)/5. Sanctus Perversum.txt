I give you pain, degradation and sorrow, absolve your sins and leave your hollow
Be afraid, be restrained, be docile and be weak
Be incomplete, be obsolete, accept defeat, be humble and be meek
So sweet when your hands are tied, so swallow your pride, then swallow mine
Save your soul or you shall burn in hell, You must obey or in fire you will dwell
There's no escape, there's no where to hide, 'cause God sees all and God is on my side
I am the flesh, the earthly limbs of God, I am the blood and the holy rod
Divinity that you must taste, Holy molestation, Holy degradation, sacred penetration, sacred violation
