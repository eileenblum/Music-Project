Wide is the line
separates the rivers from the dirt
all the while I wonder who's the one

Within the one and only eye
we all stood cut free
self-blinded to see through the veil

Can you see there's a child
standing idle by us in this mess
who am I to cause this emptiness

Willing the sea to cleanse my soul
of all that I've been
to bring me free to this clarity

Trouble rolls in
as the tides, they twist and make the turn
pain subsides
and sweeps across the earth again

Willing the sea to cleanse my soul
of all that I've been
to bring me free to this clarity

Within the one and only eye
we all stood cut free
self-blinded to see through the veil

I'm standing deep in these waters
bleeding free and bent
to drag us onto the new visions
only loss fills my void

Only the void connects me
with these mountains
of dust, blood and soil
the stones born in the flames of truth
demand a sacrifice

Don't just bleed us and leave us to ourselves
we will return so deeply harmed
and we will shatter you
