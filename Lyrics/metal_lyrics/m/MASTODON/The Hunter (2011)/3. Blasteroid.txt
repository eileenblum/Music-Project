Change your hair
Change your clothes
Iâll rearrange your face for you

If you can breathe
When I am through
Iâll give it all right back to you

I wanna drink some fucking blood
I wanna break some fucking ass
I wanna squeeze you 'til youâre inside out
I want it all

Change your name
Change your eyes
Become the one who I despise

If you are sad
And need to cry
Then turn around and go outside

I wanna drink some fucking blood
I wanna break some fucking ass
I wanna squeeze you 'til youâre inside out
I want it all
