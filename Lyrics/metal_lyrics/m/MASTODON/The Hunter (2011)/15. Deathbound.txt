[iTunes Bonus Track]Going through the deep icy waves
Thrown in end all because death waits
Throughout during the winter
Guardian of land and sea

Standing close to the throne
Violent 'cause I can not see

Power royalty our presidents hanging
No one left here anymore

Icy squall on the tundra
Obedience how we reign
Enjoy the sights we know
Soon it will be turned

Grovel life expelled become immortal
Forceful hand, unfeeling
Groaning dead are near
Sordid tale of man

Molten rock renown
Distant brother of man
Groaning dead are near
Sordid tale of man

[2x]
Icy squall on the tundra
Obedience how we reign
Enjoy the sights we know
Soon it will be turned
