To tempt the fool into the mine
Let loose the snake with antidote

Take the hand
Guide the way
Far away
Find the truth
Always / Always

Iâm on my way back home
Iâm on my way back home

I see your face inside the smoke
Itâs hard to scream and nice to choke

Take the hand
Guide the way
Far away
Find the truth
Always / Always

Iâm on my way back home
Iâm on my way back home

Letâs rest awhile inside the cave
Donât cry youâll see that weâll be safe

Take the hand
Guide the way
Far away
Find the truth
Always / Always

Take your heart into your hand
Always
Take your heart into your hand
Always

Iâm on my way back home
Iâm on my way back home
