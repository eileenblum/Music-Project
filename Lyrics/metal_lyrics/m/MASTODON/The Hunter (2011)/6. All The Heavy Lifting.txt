Lift you up again
Give you to the trees
All sound and visions are
What they ask of me
Letâs run fast through the fields
Over mountaintops
Letâs swim through ocean water
And weâll never stop

Just close your eyes
And pretend that everythingâs fine
Just close your eyes
Iâll tell you when

Can you show me
Where to find the stream
Iâve been told before
That the waterâs clean
Will you come with me
Two of us can drink
Move quick weâve got to hurry
Thereâs no time to think

Just close your eyes
And pretend that everythingâs fine
Just close your eyes
Iâll tell you when

We didnât come this far
Just to turn around
We didnât come this far
Just to run away

Just ahead
We will hear the sound
The sound that gives us
A brand new day

Just close your eyes
And pretend that everythingâs fine
Just close your eyes
Iâll tell you when
