With the lights down low
Wrapped up like a baby
And your hair hangs long
Surrounding my face

Straight out of nowhere
Buried deep inside my past
Straight out of nowhere
Hoping youâll be the last

Love your warm embrace
Hold me close donât let me go
Nipple pink and cold
Filled up with motherâs milk

Straight out of nowhere
Buried deep inside my past
Straight out of nowhere
Hoping youâll be the last

With the lights down low
Wrapped up like a baby
And your hair hangs long
Surrounding my face

Straight out of nowhere
Buried deep inside my past
Straight out of nowhere
Hoping youâll be the last
