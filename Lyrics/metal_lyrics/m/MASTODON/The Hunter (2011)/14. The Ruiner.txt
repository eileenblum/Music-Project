[iTunes Bonus Track]You take life 
Give nothing back 
You need to return what youâve stolen

You need life 
To multiply 
Devour all that surrounds you

Heavy weighs the crown 
Low hangs the head who wears it

Destroyer 
Of all thatâs good 
We donât need a death that surrounds you

The bolt strikes 
To infect 
We know your intentions are impure

Heavy weighs the crown 
Low hangs the head who wears it 
Sickness canât kill this love 
Always alive in my heart 
Sickness canât kill this love 
Always alive in my heart 
Heavy weighs the crown 
Low hangs the head who wears it
