now you see all this time
work nine to five
monday thru friday i'm singing
i sing the blues for you
now i'm standing in the pouring rain
my feet are cold but i cant complain
and i wonder how you have been
i need you love i miss you so
i know it's right but it's always strange
how i scream
all this life's worth all the while 
heartache and slave driving pain
i sing the blues for you
now im standing in the pouring rain
my feet are cold but i can't complain
and i wonder how you have been
i need you love i miss you so
i know it's right but it's always strange
