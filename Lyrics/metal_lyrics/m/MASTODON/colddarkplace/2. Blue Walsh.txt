As we hang from the vine
We swam on the thin red line
I'm asleep in the deep
Asleep in the dark black sea

I called out your name
All I hear is the pouring rain
When you came into view
I realized it's not you

You disappeared into the steam
You disappeared into the steam

'Cause I've waited so long
Blue Walsh is over me
'Cause I've waited so long
Blue Walsh is over me
'Cause I've waited so long

The night fades away
I'm dipped in the deep dark grey
And I'm raising my voice
Sinking with all my tears

I'm hiding the storm
The storm with the bright green glow
And I'm holding my knife
It's sure to make the meat

You disappeared into the steam
You disappeared into the steam

'Cause I've waited so long
Blue Walsh is over me
'Cause I've waited so long
Blue Walsh is over me
'Cause I've waited so long

Time has caught up with me
Taking all my energy
Time has caught up with me
Taking all my energy

'Cause I've waited so long
Blue Walsh is over me
'Cause I've waited so long
Blue Walsh is over me
'Cause I've waited so long
