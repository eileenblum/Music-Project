[Brann Dailor:]
Running outside the Nazca Lines
You know I see you all in white
Hoping you'll grow the fruitful vines
And I'll rain to give us life

[Solo: Brent Hinds]

[Brann Dailor:]
Violence born within my mind
I know it always takes its time
Climbing inside the cosmic eye
And forgive the enemy

[Brann Dailor &amp; Troy Sanders:]
I wonder who I am
Reflections offer nothing
I wonder where I stand
I'm afraid of myself

[Brann Dailor:]
Watching you crumble to the ground
Made me want to run away
Helping you find the golden crown
Made it easier to stay

[Brann Dailor &amp; Troy Sanders:]
I wonder who I am
Reflections offer nothing
I wonder where I stand
I'm afraid of myself

[Brent Hinds:]
At the bottom of the mountain
Well aware of my surroundings
Separation from my spirit
Let the tree fall on the plain

[Brann Dailor &amp; Troy Sanders:]
I wonder who I am
Reflections offer nothing
I wonder where I stand
I'm afraid of myself
