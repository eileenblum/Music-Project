Diamond in the wishing well
Falling underneath the spell
Save me from the wicked waves
Pulling me with all it's weight

High above the silver line
Flying over burning ground
Ringing bells of golden chains
Resonating with the sound

Siren sounding
I didn't hear it 

Travelling within the mind
No one across the line -
Found the one I'd never sell
One I thought I'd never find

Searching through the laser field
Feeling where the light is from
Always picking of the bone
Come away into our home

Siren sounding
I didn't hear it 

Voices bond
Hide not heal it

I'd fallen into a pit of lies
I try to dig around the other side
And much to my surprise
I was to blame for all the rain

[Solo]

I'd fallen into a pit of lies
I try to dig around the other side
And much to my surprise
I was to blame for all the rain [2x]
