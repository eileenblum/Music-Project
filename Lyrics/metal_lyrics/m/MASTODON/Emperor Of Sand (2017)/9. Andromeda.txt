It never ends
The game isn't done
I feel the crawling and haunting
Upon us until you listen

In never ends
Enough is enough
Taking your essence and use it
To strengthen their own flesh and blood

Time watching as the sand flows through glass
Light calls to me from future and from past

This kills me to know
We cannot learn

It never never ends
The ink isn't dry
The great consolation has written a second lease on your life
The great consolation has granted a second lease on your life

Light watching as the sand flows through glass
Time calls to me from future and from past

It kills me to know
We cannot learn
Time is moving as sands flowing
Light is blinding radiating

It never ends it never ends it never ends

Chronic illusions confusing conclusions
Foster the culture predict the deception
Chronic delusions with caustic solutions
