My last sunrise, no more sunsets for me
I can bury my good heart with relief, I'm free
I can smile, taste the tear drop from my eye
Waiting for the breath of wind to give wings for my soul

I have a feeling, this is my day. Caressing shine and rain.
Farewell, this life couldn't last
My heart is weak, the reason is not far to seek

The dream of the end
Before the journey begins cold enters the room,
Then give me the last dance with death

My breathing is heavy, soul reaching for the sky
I've nothing to lose, everything is inside me
Golden memories make me feel alright
Waiting for the moment when my love is by my side

The dream of the end
Before the journey begins cold enters the room,
Then give me the last dance with death

My last sunrise, no more sunsets for me
I can bury my good heart with relief, I'm free
I can smile, taste the tear drop from my eye
Waiting for the breath of wind to give wings for my soul

The dream of the end
Before the journey begins cold enters the room,
Then give me the last dance with death
