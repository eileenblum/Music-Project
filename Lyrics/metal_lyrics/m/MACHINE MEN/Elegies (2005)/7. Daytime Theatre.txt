Night has fallen killing joy and light
The doors are locked keeping the fear inside
Apprentices preparing for a bedtime story
Saying their prayers, making the sign of the cross

Kneels down to pray for better days
Eyes shut he's searching for peace of mind

Beneath the eyes of gold
Lust getting loose changing the tears into blood
In these holy rooms,
Current of sin raging, trembling walls and windows

The screams feel silent wiping the tears from their eyes
The demons crawled back to the place where they arose
The morning came bringing light and glory
But the devil dances again when the night is falling

Beneath the eyes of gold
Lust getting loose changing the tears into blood
In these holy rooms,
Current of sin raging, trembling walls and windows

And sun is up again, daytime theatre for believers
But when curtain falls and candlelight gives up to the wind
The whole underworld rises
