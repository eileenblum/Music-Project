[Bruce Dickinson Cover]

He rides the wave, aspiring slave
The Prince of Darkness plays his games
You're hypnotized, under velvet skies
He breathes the red wind 'cross your eyes

Who leads you to the dark secret?
Who leads you to the dark secret?

Your life is lost, your soul is damned
But it feels too good to make a stand
That is bad, but this is worse
Let judgment come, you love this curse

When you look at me you're like a god
Swimming in the tide of light
Somersault into the flood
Watch as you unwind

Who leads you to the dark secret?
Who leads you to the dark secret?

Who is your mistress that leads you to the dark secret?
Who is your mistress who leads you to the dark secret?
