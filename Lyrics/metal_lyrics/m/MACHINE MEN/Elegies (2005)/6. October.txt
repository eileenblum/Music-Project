Suddenly from the light of life to the darkness, swallowing pride and joy
On the wave of my thoughts sailing lost and cold - this lonely boy
Sinking to his inner world leaving this earth million miles behind
Crossing the borderline, time is not running on this side, not on this side

Night brings vapour where the spirits move
I'm alone with the echoes

I've sailed the sea of loneliness drifting in timelessness
Crossed the ocean, been at the mercy of the waves
Seen the beauty of dawn, admired it after storm
Felt the joy of rebirth and could smile again

Crawling back to the land of the living from silence of the tomb
But the black clouds return, leaving pale and fragile - this broken man

Night brings vapour where the spirits move
I'm all alone with the echoes

I've sailed the sea of loneliness drifting in timelessness
Crossed the ocean, been at the mercy of the waves
Seen the beauty of dawn, admired it after storm
Felt the joy of rebirth and could smile again
