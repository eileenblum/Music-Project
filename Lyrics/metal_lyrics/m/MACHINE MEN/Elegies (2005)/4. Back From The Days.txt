Do we ever give any thoughts for the heroes of our days
Who fought for freedom and future
Prayed in the dark - and rain at night washed their tears away
Saved a wounded man, turned towards the bullet rain
And took the last step on our free land

Souls are gone - in the unknown graves, who brings them back from the days?
Left in the past with other braves - fought for us, against
fear, the machines
We don't know how it feels to be hand in hand with death

Guns blazed on the enemy line, smoke filled the sky
He knew for sure there was someone else
Who watched the moon but not through the dust and smoke
Far away from battlefields praying for a wish,
Gazing up to the stars

Souls are gone - in the unknown graves, who brings them back
from the days?
Left in the past with other braves - fought for us, against fear, the machines
We don't know how it feels to be hand in hand with death

The whisper beyond the grave in her dream
- Save your tears and your worst fear

Souls are gone - in the unknown graves, who brings them back from the days?
Left in the past with other braves - fought for us, against fear, the machines
We don't know how it feels to be hand in hand with death
