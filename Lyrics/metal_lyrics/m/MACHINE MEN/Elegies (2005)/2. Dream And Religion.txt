Lost in the crush under the rain
Alone in this world unknown
Looking for a way back home trying to forget this pain
- drifted too far away, boat's too rusted to sail

Standing on the edge - to the edge they return

Waiting for an angel with the answer
To take him under her wings for a moment
But he is too deep in the darkness,
Where light does not reach and the angels don't seek

Soul searching sun but hand for a gun to end his days

I have my dream to keep me alive
Religion I sold my soul to
I have my dream to keep me alive
Religion I sold my soul to

I have my dream to keep me alive
Religion I sold my soul to
I have my dream to keep me alive
Religion I sold my soul to
I have my dream to keep me alive
Religion I sold my soul to
I have my dream to keep me alive
Religion I sold my soul to
