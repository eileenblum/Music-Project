The massacre of angels in heaven has begun
The black clouds are moving, covering the sun
Screaming and torture as an echo in the wind
Satan has his lust and the last sun
Jesus is next, deceived once again
Nails are heavy, faith won't kill the pain

The whole world is falling down with hate

Now the god has taken the part of Judas
Broke the ten commandments and sold the crown in shame
As a slave crawls like us, with a number, no name
Madness is the name of this absurd game
There's the son of god hanging once again
Surrounded by the flames of hell

The whole world is falling down with hate
The good ones will take it to their graves

Third day is not for resurrection at all
So the tale won't be the same anymore

The whole world is falling down with hate
The good ones will take it to their graves

The whole world is falling down with hate
The good ones will take it to their graves
