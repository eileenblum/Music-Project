She's standing at the gates with a one way ticket to the other side,
Empty gaze in her eyes.
No kiss goodbye at all. A suitcase full of memories of the past
And three little words unsaid - and why?

For some crime she did not commit before she died?
For little sins she did not confess in daylight?

A bench rusted by tears reminds her of sad years
Of a dark world and familiar faces
She's waiting for the ride, the riders of the last day
Who are taking her to the doors of resurrection - and why?

For some crime she did not commit before she died?
For little sins she did not confess in daylight?

She's leaving this world...

For some crime she did not commit before she died?
For little sins she did not confess in daylight?
