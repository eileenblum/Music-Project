Way to the darkness in that we go
Death touches us with icy hand
We'll suffer implacable pain
We'll feel a torment, we'll see the death

Dead souls surround us
We die, return to life and continue to live
Sins, that nobody from us unscaped them yet
There aren't ways out-way of fate is one

Way to the darkness
Way to the dark
To the dark

Silver star will pass over the sky
And her light will show the way to the death
Everything we'll have dear to us
We'll leave and we'll decay in the black ground

Way to the darkness
Way to the dark
To the dark

Our spirits will live eternally
Not looking to it that our bodies already are dying
The other world is waiting there yet
There, where darkness is ruling over everything

Way to the darkness
Way to the dark
To the dark
