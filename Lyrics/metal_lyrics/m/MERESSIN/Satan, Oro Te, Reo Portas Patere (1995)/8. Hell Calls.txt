Hell wait for our souls
Evil invited them to it's home
Bodies will get colder and will turn pale like snow
Them will transfix death with painful scythe

Hell waits for our souls-for bloody pains
Hell calls

At the pits which will bodies swallow
Priest under devil's rule will preach majestic sermon
About false god, fucking paradise
About moral, good, that isn't in the world

Hell waits for our souls-for bloody pains
Hell calls

Hell wait for our pains to bear
Satan wait for new souls
Forever in the graves will hear angry laugh
That will torture to death feeble men's mind

Overturned crosses is sticking in the graves
Everywhere around only blackness
Funeral will go by they will be forgotten
Death will bring rest for bodies and pains for soul

Hell waits for our souls-for bloody pains
Hell calls
