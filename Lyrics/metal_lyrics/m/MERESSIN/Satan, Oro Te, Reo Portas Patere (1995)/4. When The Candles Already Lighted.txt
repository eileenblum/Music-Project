When the candles aready lighted
Drinking of blood violates the mind
Caller out come through the shadows at twelve
Bring the stench of sacrifice's rot

When the candles already lighted
Insanity lights upthe roots of my pains
Satan renovates forces

Climbing up the walls, roars
In this time ripping yourself till the blood
Pales eyes flooded with tears
Now ate seeing only burning crosses at the church

When the candles already lighted
And were consumed doses for insanity
Mind slaves of deads

When the candles already lighted
I'm seeing what will you maybe never to see
