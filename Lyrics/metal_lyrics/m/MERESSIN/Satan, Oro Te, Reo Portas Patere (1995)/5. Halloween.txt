Demon's wind drives souls down with vortices
In the night of Halloween devils rule has no boundaries
Waters turn into blood, bread into stone
Hungry beast looks for new sacrifice

Halloween-celebration of the dead
Halloween-celebration of the dead

Terribly fury of the ghosts-this night is assigned for them
Who not found rest and scorned treasures of paradise
Cross goes down into depths of hell
Devils spit with sulphur turns into ashes

Halloween-celebration of the dead
Demon's howl
Helloween-scorn of the cross
Celebration of the dead

Keep Black Mess cursted priests
Sacrifice is offered to honour name of Evil

Lost meaning here christians word
Halloween's night-it's devil's gift for us

Halloween-celebration of the dead
Demon's howl
Helloween-scorn of the cross
Celebration of the dead
