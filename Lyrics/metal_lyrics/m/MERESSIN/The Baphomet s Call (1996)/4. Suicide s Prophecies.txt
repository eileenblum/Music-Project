Elects are roaming in my eyes
Forever died away mother's flame in my eyes
Heart is full, of unopened tragical cards
Time will move me into darkest place of space

Coffin - could couch of my future
Earth - eternal bed of my future
I touched the abyss with my senses
I left the loop it must have been done

I'm kissing black lady's hand
Feeling dead traits of deity I want go out
Maybe it's in imagination
I hear breathing of demons - is mixing into solid uproar

I wish eternal burden will find the labyrinths of eternity
I shuffled cards of life and I'll not return this way
Father Satan insists to learn not of obey blindly
Play from bloody music wonderful melody of suicide
I'm kissing black lady's hand
Feeling dead traits of deity I want go out
Maybe it's in imagination
I see threshold of dark stumbled souls

Accumulated strength flowing down together with blood
And only now my suffers are born at seven gates
I hear the moaning, dead mother's voice
In labyrinth of mind is going on fight for control

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, goats are waiting with pride
My soul on the way to sending, my eyes look at dying light
