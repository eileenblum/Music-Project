Open gates of altar for the blind
Release the shoots for darkness
Give up the holy goblet with snakes
Destroy the holy name of church

Mother - your son cuts himself
Suffering the pain, offering the blood to dark

Flowing of blood, compels the men, helpless to feel
Life doesn't spoil, killing yourself, feeling the pain
And big pleasure too
Pleasure to destroy holy name

Blind dead don't found the stream of light
Through could get into dark side
Open the gates of altar, show them their way
'church is too weak to do this'

Your son kills himself for the truth
Which only a few ones want to understand

Destroy holy name of church
Give up holy goblet with your blood
Release the blind for darkness
Destroy the gates of altar

Mother - your son cuts himself
Suffering the pain, offering the blood to dark
Your son kills himself for dead
Wants to show their way
