I'm calling for my forefather souls 'I know it's hard to hear last words
Slow rot inside of alive let the madfall just into the suffer
All cursed lives are bleeding, it's quit, when you know you're dying
I just want to raise the glass of blood, because my real feast is just
beginning

Designated for eternity
I'm looking for fate in darker places
I know ' my cross will keep my soul
In the cursed home' I believe

Life is inevitable heaviness of death, all those dreams are this point of
insanity
Separated from the pain, you're feeling destruction of jail
Incarnation in the dark, immortality form real body
Raise the glass of blood for me, with my real feast is just beginning

I'm dying in the night, in grips of dark
I'll remain alive only through death
Through insomnia liberated temptations
I have lived like an angel, I'll die like the devil

I'm calling for my forefather souls 'I know, it's hard to hear last words
Slow rot inside of alive let the madfall, just into the suffer
Feeling the growing pain on maze ways, I have gone into the entrails of dark
Martyring unreal flesh for conscience sake, closing my eyes for the last
painful temptations

Blood-stained cross rouses my tornments
Blood-stained soul, I must bear a rage of fire
Life is quad, which you want to shun
Starting on a doomsday
