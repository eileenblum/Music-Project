In moonlight I saw my black shadow
Silently creeping through cursed earth, bringing fear and anxiety
My way through the dust, through the blackened ashes
Cold ashes, once former bodies, through laughter turned into tears.

What does jester's mask hide
Oh, it's touch of evil
Revenge of cursed tyrants
In the name of evil incarnation

Suddenly rising wind is streaming black flags which are bringing death
Do you fell how blood is freezing and cold of night is blowing into heart?
Calm yourself ' I'll take you to theatre of my dreams
Under a colored jester's mask beyond the seven gates of hell

I'm calling north wind and red glow of fire
I'm inviting universal evil and lord of the dark
I hear already rising laughter from the graves of eternal tyrants
I see brimmer full of blood, only fire and blood

Somewhere in time my hardening eyes are burning black fire
In transaction with fallen angel, in ages under jester's mask
My performance is still not over ' give me hand ' it's time for us to wander
Devilish laughter is still moving lips ' let me again into my bloody theatre
Do you hear me? - yes, do you hear me? - yes,
do you see me? - yes, yes, yes, yes - I'm coming!
