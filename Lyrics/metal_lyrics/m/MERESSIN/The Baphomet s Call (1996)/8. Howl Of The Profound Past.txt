Affected by magic theatre, drawn into profound, immemorial past
Awaked senses are easily mastered by force, it is radiating
My kind without obstruction, I'm proud I've escaped
Once my bloody legends were silently washed out
Now are ripped again like a healed wounds

Be born for mutilation
Tragic legend pierced my heart
Dreams are tied together with subconsciousness
In painful visions I see death, thirsty for sacrifice

I've moved three ages back
Like a zombie I'm searching for stream of light, that could enliven
I'll try hunger in the night
'This serried, true legend testifies cannibalism'

Be born for mutilation
Tragic legend pierced my heart
Dreams are tied together with subconsciousness
In painful visions I found an answer

My eyes directed at sunset are waiting for curse
Fire running out in the sky, I see sacrifices are crawling in the lane

Full uncontrolling of myself
Seizure of strangers from within
Violence of the mind in the ways of sufferings
Surrender to a call of the labyrinths, incarnation of fear feeling

Affected by magic theatre
Drawn into profound, immemorial past
Like a zombie I'm searching for stream of light
That could enliven poisoned roots of soul
