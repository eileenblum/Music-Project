A flash out of hell
Sounds of evil
The world is dark
No lights to see
Try to survive, you're better of death
Because all you hear
Sounds like evil
His screaming laughter makes everyone run
You will suffer in pain
When you hear his voice

Silence has been ended
He's back in the streets
Total destruction everywhere you can see
His voice is killing
It tares you apart
Try to run, you can't move

A flash out of hell
You wish you were me
Sounds of evil are in your head
The world is dark
Dark as hell
No lights as far you can see
