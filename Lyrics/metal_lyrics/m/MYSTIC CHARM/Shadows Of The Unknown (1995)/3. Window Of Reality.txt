Look through the window
The window of reality
Touch the streak of lightning
Let it enter the mind

Awakw from the dreamworld
Reality is no dancing shadow
That's mourning in darkness
Deceiving the body and soul

Look through the shadows
Provoke the prediction
Conjuring up the picture
Mirage of extinction

Evolution is alarming
Evil singleness of purpose
Awake from the dreamworld
Look through the window
