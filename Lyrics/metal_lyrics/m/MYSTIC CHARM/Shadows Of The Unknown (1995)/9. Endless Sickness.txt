Now I can see there is more than the trees in sight
Show me what rules, land seas and skies

Stop the demonium terror to take place
All fairy tales will end in these flames

Immortal sky 
demensionless high
Bring us the key 
to eternity
Give the orders
then we will obey
No more remorse
adoring the source

My mind cries from inside that injustice is done
The path we must take will be lit by the sun

The end has come for the human race
Doomed to live in a neverending disgrace

Awaiting the power that will rise in me
I will be ready, so let it be

No one will know the future may show
So be aware for the skies to glow

Immortal sky 
demensionless high
Bring us the key
to eternity
Give the orders
then we will obey
No more remorse
adoring the source
