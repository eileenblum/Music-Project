At the birth, the moon cremated
When it cried, the rivers flooded
When it was hungry, thunders kept on rolling
The circle opened, doom was sealed

At the birth, life was extinct
Insanity ruled, course of the disease
The world stopped turning, no one cared
The soul was saved, no matter the costs

It was made by the master of science
The resurrection is dead certain
Existence becomes like a cartoon
The circle opened to be never closed again

At the birth, the moon cremated
When it cried, the rivers flooded
When it was hungry, thunders kept on rolling
The soul is saved, no matter the costs

Forget one thing
Wisdom of life
Pay the price
Of power abuse
Beyond all control
It's called genetic
Manipulation
For all...
