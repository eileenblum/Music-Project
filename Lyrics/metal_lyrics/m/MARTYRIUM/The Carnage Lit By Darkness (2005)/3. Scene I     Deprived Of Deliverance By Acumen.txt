[Act II â From Sobriety To Depraved Delusion]

Welcome to this temple of sorrow
An unwanted gift from the saviour of man
Each day we are taught to be meaner and stronger
Until we drown in our own tears and remorse
We were damned from birth and will never find rest
Our mind tears us in two and shall never sleep
When we love our heart becomes our enemy
For it can distract you from reality and lead to pain...

But as usual the cross turns out to be
A reminder of broken promises...
He was supposed to save us
But all he did was let us rot and die in each otherâs hands
We were promised salvation, and some still believe in it
But I can only believe in what I feel and live through...
An eternal Martyrium!
