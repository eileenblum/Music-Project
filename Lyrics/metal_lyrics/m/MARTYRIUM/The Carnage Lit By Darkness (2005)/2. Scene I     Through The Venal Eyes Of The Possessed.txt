Innocence lost, heart is bare
Vulnerable to my deepest wishes...
I rip your soul
And diffuse into your conscience!

Blacker than darkness itself,
I stain your insides like a sycophant
I deface your spirit...

I am in control
Of your body and soul
You will do as I command
Obey me or perish!

I am your one and only Master
Worship me in the name of the 666
Thrust the crucifix into the orifice
Of any intruding exorcist!

Desecrate the House of God
Urinate in the Consecrated Chalice
Defecate on the Sacred Alter
And behold! The portrait of Christ!

With the image of the Holy Mother within your reach,
Masturbate with all your lustful fantasies,
Ejaculate your cum onto her Holy adorn
Stain her Purity with the Principal Vice

âHear me! Serve my ordainâ

I am in control
Of your body and soul
You will do as I command
Obey me or perish!

Angelic sculptures bleed your grief,
Cry! The tears of your Godâs throes,
Your tears mean nothing to me,
For they are worthless like your Jehovah!
I spew out my blasphemies,
Through my obscure pawn,
As I chortle at your stigmata
On the sacred hour of Dawn!
As the sun fades...
Like the faith of your followers
Darkness prevails!
As my vile intentions unfold...

Your futile wounds, haemorrhage with sacredness
As I thrust my serpent tongue,
To taste of you sour Entity
Your Holy acridness!

In all our wrath we are proud
Unlike your humble cloister tenants,
For they are all our prey
And we shall glut upon their way bleeding flesh!

Blacker than darkness itself
I stain your insides like a sycophant
I deface your spirit!

âThe fires of Hell rise higher, as our conquest is fulfilled!
Once again I predominate my throne, as the Prince of this World.
Lucifer, Belial, Satan, Leviathan, the Elements are for me to master...â
âAs for you my trustworthy gull,
Stab yourself with the crucifix and die, a noble death...
For you will rise triumphant in the scorching flames of Hellfire!â

Possession is the key to Eternal glory,
So prepare your conscience for my custody
For you might be the next to see;
THROUGH THE VENAL EYES OF THE POSSESSED!
