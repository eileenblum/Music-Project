Requiem,
What am I living for?
Solitude,
I can't take it anymore,
Where have you been oh God!
I am the son that you forgot.

Death welcomes me to a tragic end
To greet my want to meet the Creator
For I will blaspheme and mock the Almighty
Before judgment shall be passed...

... And I'll rot forever more...
