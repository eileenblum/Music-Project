Prince of the east
Personified perfection
Bringer of light
Angel beyond redemption

he who God defied
Will lead the armies to war
Against the pearly gates
The apocalypse shalt befall

Vengeance against the holy
For punished he was for pride
With sword of flaming thunder
All his scions he will guide

Lucifer! Be with us and guide our way!
Lucifer! In your name we will foray!

Lucifer! God from Heaven overthrown!
Lucifer! Rise up high and claim your throne!

Embraced by wisdom, branded with no scar
Born in the light of the morning star

Bearer of divine light
Grant us the supremacy
Holder of the astral sky
Instill in us the potency

Just like the graceful Phoenix
From ashes we'll be reborn
And the web of old false icons
Will be mangled and forever torn

Behold a new race
Under whom you shall kneel
Brought forth the light
We possess the Seventh Seal

All shall be blinded
By the Luciferian breed
We'll mock the Christian savior
On barren ground he'll crawl and bleed

Through the corpses of fallen seraphs
We shall inscribe our new creed
Branded angels under their new god
On their gashed wounds we'll spill our seed

Lucifer! Be with us and guide our way!
Lucifer! In your name we will foray!

Lucifer! God from Heaven overthrown!
Lucifer! Rise up high and claim your throne!

Embraced by wisdom, branded with no scar
Born in the light of the morning star
