In a dream of a twisted reality...
A distorted vision of an unknown land
Blazed in darkness under deserts of sand
In the berth of all evil I pace, speechless

The winds speak my name
For I am the messenger of the Gods
The one who found the formula
To pass Arzir against all odds

One thousand moons I've seen
I'm the prophet
Alsi ku nushi ya! Kia mass ssaratu!

Chosen to seek the serpent's children
To battle forth the liers-in-wait
Int he spaces where no mortal walks
Where the old ones sleep, in chaos, in hate

Ensnared by the unwelcoming hand
Of he who made the stars!
Charms against my spellbound path
Enki protect your ones!
I descend with the Three Seals of Masshu
Into the labyrinths of the Absu...

A column of fire with a blazing head of stone
It watches me as in the pit I am blown
From felon winds abominations come forth
Plague-wielder Pazuzu and Magick Lord Azag Thoth!
Lord of all fevers angel with four wings
Controls the storms controls the four winds

They haul me down in their realm
And lunged their curses against my charm
I dive the depths of the ancient sea
Gods! Hear your servant and come for me

The ancient mother I witness sleeping
Awaiting the necromancer's calling
For Tiamat ever seeks to conquer the stars
For the Battle of Old has left its scars

Ensnared by the unwelcoming hand
Of he who made the stars!
Charms against my spellbound path
Enki protect your ones!

Descended with the Three Seals of Masshu
Into the labyrinths of the Absu...
