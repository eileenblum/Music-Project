Mountains mask the tomb of thy eternal sleep
Guarded by the Seven Stars of Divine Power
Invoked only by the abominations of the abyss
Hordes of Utukki! The world will cower!

Xastur! Beloved of the ancient
Thy name is called! Awake and come to me!
Absu! Berth of all ancient evil
Stir the depths! Send forth your legions!

Kutulu rise from the seas of Nar Mattaru
To thy covenant you must hold firm
Sons of iniquity embrace your oath
Fulfill the prophecy in the Book of the Worm

Ninghizhidda heed my pledge! Sorceress of the Magick Wand
Those who dwell beyond the gate I came to seek beneath the sand
Hear me dormant spirit! Scourge of madness from your throne!
Open gate of Ganzir! Watcher of the land unknown!
Ia! Thou who art before all things
Ia! Born before man's reign begun
Ia! Thou art before legend and myth
Ia! Thou who art the ancient one!

In the name of Shammash! In the name of Ishtar!
Seven stars of seven powers
Ever-shining North Star
Iak sakkak Kutulu!
Come to me o ancient one!

Remember minions of the Great Old War
Beware the knower of the secret names
For all must perish for his power to restore
He wields the chariot with the disc of flames!

Guardians of the gates heed my calling
Answer to no other voice but mine!
For I have awoken the dead but dreaming
Resist.... and death shalt be thine!

May the dead rise
And smell the incense of my curse!
I summon thee...
Creatures of hatred and despise
I summon thee...
My words shall shatter the gate within!

The serpent awakes from silent slumber
Mother and queen of the world down under
The Absu yawns with jaws wide open
Behold the uprise of the ancient demon!

Xastur! Beloved of the ancient
Thy name is called! Awake and come to me!
Absu! Berth of all ancient evil
Stir the depths! Send forth your legions!
