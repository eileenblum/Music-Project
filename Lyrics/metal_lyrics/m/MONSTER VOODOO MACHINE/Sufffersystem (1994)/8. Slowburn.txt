blessed upon us
new to the day
given room to see
but taught how to obey
quickly carried from
cradle to grave
barely breathing
as one leans to behave
one world one choice is yours
face with so much confusion
but we've all been there before
slowburn - the hate is learned
fuel for the fire
and innocence burns
slowburn - awaiting your turn
fuel for the fire
and innocence burns
new direction
of your own
new infections spreading
in concrete and bone
simple pleasures
never far from hoe
but dogs smell fear
and they will not leave you alone
