give me just one
one reason to stay here
give me just one
one reason to care
I'd show you the door
but you know where it is
and I've got better things to do
asked all the questions
but gave us no answers
and never saw things through
give me just one
one reason to listen
give me just one
one reason to hear
my spirits were broken with me
there's no more compassion inside
it's all turned to hatred
got lost on a path to the void
understanding has long been destroyed
and it's all turned to hatred
