colours have turned to a grey wash
forever crawling as the rest watch
and it's obvious this light will fade
in an hour that lasts seven days
seeing/bleeding through sunspots
and I know when it's over
when it's all said and done
when the hate comes around to find you
you will always be the one
the sound of screams go on forever
blood and triumph mixed together
