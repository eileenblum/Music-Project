blood is passed from the soul to the machine
redirected giving life once again
New life giving flame
to a vessel of fear
from the shadows to the chamber of one
constant reminders of the work to be done
spellbound by the light
but the winter is near
no control cause the world keeps going
before the pulpit of a passive preacher
clearly defined is the student and teacher
woven into the form
are the thorns of routine
ceremony of the struggle and praise
abrasive truths bleaching dirt from the days
blatant power unrelenting
all too much to believe
threat by example
threat by example
too much to handle
threat by example
respect and power
in the darkest of hours
too much to handle
threat by example
shock waves are leaving scars under the skin
the simple ethics too intense to take in
control or contempt
or control and comply
the second coming in a citizen form
incubated in the eye of the storm
overdrive, clarified in the blink of an eye
