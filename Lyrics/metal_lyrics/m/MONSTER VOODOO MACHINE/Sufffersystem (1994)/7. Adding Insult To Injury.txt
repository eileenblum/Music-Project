a few cans short of a six pack
a couple bucks short on the rent
screws too tight to feel just right
but no one ever knew what it meant
alarms are going off as a warning
but they're always falling on deaf ears
forever bottling anger and ignoring the danger
and throwing a wrench in the gears
did you ever think about the consequences - no
did you ever think about the retribution - no
let's play a game called confrontation
did you ever think about your situation - no
did you ever take a look at your reflection - no
let's play a game called confrontation
always on the verge of a breakdown
and always left standing in dust
the lights are all on but nobody's at home
and you're never careful who you can trust
still it's only scratching the surface
and sure we've got a victim but we still need a witness
the failure or plans will stain the blood on our hands
and now it's only screams in the silence
it's time to add
insult to injury
mayhem to misery
to find identity
foundations growing thin
I can feel the roof cave in
I don't like where I have been
it's time to start again
