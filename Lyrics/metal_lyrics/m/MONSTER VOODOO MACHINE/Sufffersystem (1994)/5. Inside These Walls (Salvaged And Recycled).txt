inside walls a shelter
rest in hell there
mirrors and madness
the victim has felt it
lights shine brightest
darkness to whiteness
blood stains remain
the scarring is timeless
I'll find correction
in walls of protection
chance to gain focus
if you're losing direction
you can shut them out
what it's all about
walls are your own
a mask for your doubt
these walls
inside these walls
inside walls another
at war with the other
dare to do battle
with fate undiscovered
masks hide the master
tears and the laughter
screams of a victim
of another disaster
have no direction
truth or reflection
forever the victim
just another deception
lock doors tightly
the world come fighting
the walls have shelter
the war kills nightly
inside walls the darkness
power is harnessed
and given direction
to ones that want this
new language of one
spoken in tongue
riddled with guilt
the fortunate son
alone in the chamber
destiny maker
stranger to many
directional taker
crawl as reminder
someday expire
walls will cave in
extinguish the fire
