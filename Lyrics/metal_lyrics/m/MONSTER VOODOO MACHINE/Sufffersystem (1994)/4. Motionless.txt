one growing jaded
with your lives passing by
can't stand the common man
who buys his own hype
never liked the ones who said
I need to adjust
I can't find complacency
cause I can't find trust
what have I got
and where do I stand
haunted by memories
you can't understand
constant confusion
motionless time
in need of retribution
empty inside
something's gone wrong
I do not belong
nothing seems strong
I do not belong
sitting here on a pedestal
that I carved from stone
I'll sit here out of the way
so that I can carve alone
grey walls grey skies grey heart
that covers my mind
I do not run from man
I only run from time
