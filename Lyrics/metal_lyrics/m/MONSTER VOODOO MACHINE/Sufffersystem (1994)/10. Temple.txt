red lights are growing stronger
grey skies have moved along
nights of pain are getting longer
an my resistance ain't that strong
your hatred turned to laughter
your flame grows weak inside
weak side of a nervous reaction
blind to your fight with time
and if these temple walls
they should come crashing in
cast away just throw away the dead wood
and if these temple walls
they should come crashing down
relearn rebuild as only you could
this house is what you've made it
this house was yours alone
stood by as you abused it
and now you stand there on your own
this house has gotten colder
these walls are much too thin
this platform is boring and older
I need foundations again
