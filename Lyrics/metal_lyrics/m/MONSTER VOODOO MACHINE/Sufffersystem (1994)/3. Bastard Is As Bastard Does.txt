speedball whirwind of fury
becomes submissive to the notion
that to judge is to jury
whitewash vision turns blurry
coffee floods the veins
and clouds the mind in a hurry
hate fuels the war machine
for reasons never seen
darkside threshold of a holocaust
destructive in nature
prepared to win at any cost
so spell it out in blood
bastard is as bastard does
and nothing gets done
bastard is as bastard does
transparent and deformed
inherent from the core
so spell it out in blood
bastard is as bastard does
wasteland shelter to the monster
breeding ground for lies
and off limits to others
dark days keep the beast under cover
keeps the city in fear
until the truth is discovered
