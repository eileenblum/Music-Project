self-destructing
first-class loser with a second-rate life
down to nothing
locked away in hiding won't set it right
held tightly - a cradle of tension
so tightly - in fetal position
exhausted - a hollow condition
so lonely, so lonely
you know that they're all wanting something
a losers' game but no one said it was fair
too much to deal with too much to keep from screaming
screams that never reach the ears of one who'd care
overload inside the mind of an infant
lying helpless just a victim of luck
mass confusion floods the soul in an instant
drunk with hatred and won't get the hell up
