for every action
I'm the opposite reaction
I'm the blackest sheep amongst you
and I guess that's the attraction
I'm the one to pin the blame on
scarred by life as you can tell
where the hell is this
this is hell
I'm the spark that starts the fires
burning all dreams and desires
and the laughter in your nightmares
holding all that you aspire
every minute every hour
I'm the sweetest thought turned sour
I'm the bitter taste of losing
turning heroes into cowards
I'm disease inside your bloodstream
I'm infection in your mind
all the guilt that ever haunts you
and then eats you from inside
all crimes against humanity
where the brighter side of me
I've got hellish plans to cripple man
all yet to be seen
