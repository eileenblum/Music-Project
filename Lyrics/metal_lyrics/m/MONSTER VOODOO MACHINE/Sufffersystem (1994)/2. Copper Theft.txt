no one ever used to care
about pockets lined with copper
no one used to care
about people running around going nowhere
let's talk
about the violence
let's talk
about denial
let's talk
about the hatred
let's talk
about denial
somewhere dreams turn to nightmares
somewhere they live by treason
somewhere trust turns to blackmail
somewhere without a reason
no one ever used to care
about pockets lined with copper
but now thoughts turn to gold
and now they're lining up with hopes to rape another
