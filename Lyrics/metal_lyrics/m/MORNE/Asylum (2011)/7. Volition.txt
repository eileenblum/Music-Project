You were there
I could not see you
These eyes of ignorance
Look only within

See my conflict
My weakness is vast
An arrogant empire
Crumbles to collapse

Absence outweighs presence
My regret remains present
No wish no prayer
Can ever bring you home

The path was clear but I wandered
These eyes of ignorance
Look only within
They see pride a dead end
Loyalty a shallow grave
Being true won't bring honor
This stillness won't end pain

Now shattered under our disdain
Hearts will corrode
Falling through cracks
At the end of the road
