Through this void I can see all truth
I deny, yet you still force through
In my mind I confront my fate
Losing all that we fought to save

Darkness grows drowning out our screams
Silence breeds bloodstained fantasies
On my own I combat distress
Fleeting hope of the dispossessed

I am weak, I renounce my name
I withdraw from this vicious game
Memories of this war shall fade
Lost in time, nothing to remain
