Your eyes taken by the dream
That fell through you
Like a river
Crushing against the rocks
Your eyes taken by the night
That fell on you
Like a rain that took the sun from you
Took the light from you

When the tide is low, I'll see you there
When the fire calms, I'll see you there
I'll see you there
