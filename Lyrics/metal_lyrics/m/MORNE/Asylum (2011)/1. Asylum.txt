So many years have gone by
So much time
So many days have turned to nights
So many wasted chances

Wonder about days to come
I burn inside
Time is slowly running out
Memories won't turn to dust

Days when we were all like one
We were brothers then
Now like leaves we are falling down
Falling one by one

I can see you every night
But you always walk away
Dreams try to reach the past
Memories won't turn to rust

Pain makes me hope again
Pleasure helps to forget

We were running towards the sun
One by one
With fire in our hearts
Burning bright

Greener grass and brighter light
Burning strong
Like the bridges glowing on
When we're gone

I can see us at the night
Waiting for the dawn
Last toast for those who've gone
Their shadows will live on

At the night when the day has gone
The fire's calm
Will you hold my hand so tight
When it's time to go?

Pain makes me hope again
Pleasure helps to forget

The path of life the one we know
We will fall alone
We will fall unknown
This path of life, the one we know
We will fall unknown
We will fall alone
