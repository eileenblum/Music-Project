At the edge of the sky sun is burning on
Shadows of trees and the river flows
Through the fields of grain and the serpent roads
Day by day getting closer to the end of the road

Sound of the sea
Sound of the wind
We arise to fall

Our way through this valley floor
Don't you know?
Don't you know?

Another day washed out by the rain
Another step closer to the edge
