[2008 Demo Track]You walk by right him
Yet you never see
You chose to ignore
This deep rooted suffering of humanity
The living specter
The breathing ghost
Just part of the scenery
A hindrance at most

Ignorance is bliss, ignorance is bliss
Ignore their value, ignore their pain
Ignorance is bliss, ignorance is bliss
If you ignore the problem they'll cease to exist

When you need a scapegoat
He's the first one you see
Blaming the victim
For the life that he leads
A bleeding burden
Society's plague
A creeping virus
A hopeless disease

Ignorance is bliss, ignorance is bliss
Ignore their value, ignore their pain
Ignorance is bliss, ignorance is bliss
If you ignore the problem they'll cease to exist

Rejected
Abandoned
Forgotten
Forsaken [x8]
