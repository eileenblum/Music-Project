Cold sun sets as we break from the chains of fear
Our will is strong 
when covered by night we march against the invincible force, 
Which must be destroyed
We must carry on the faith 
Of victory that must be there, must be near 

Machine we're living for
Our hearts turned to stone
No more feelings left at all
Iron wheels that move this invincible form

So we march under blood staind clouds of lies
Towards black dead sun 
That stare at us
Criple bones of steel and blind eyes of glass
And this smell of death and decay,
Carried by wind of dying invincible force
That we have destroyed 
And now we must carry on the grace and wisdom
Of our mothers that we mourn

Machine we're living for
Our hearts turned to stone
No more feelings left at all
Iron wheels that move this invincible form
