[CD Bonus Track]Eyes close slow as my strength fades away
I walk through the fields, there are stones in my way
My feet are sore, I feel pulsing pain
It happend before now it happens again
(I know) I can't stop death, that slowly arrives
My senses feel dead but I know I'm alive
All that I loved all I have lost
Silenec that is louder then words

Shining like thunder 
Twilight burns in my eyes [x2]

Horizon burns as the sun goes down
Nights kill days and months go by
All I create and every time I fail
Everyone I hurt, everything I hate
Confusion grows on and this time feels real
Blood feels cold when it drips from my veins
I wait with patience for the final hour
My body hurts but I know I can't cower

Shining like thunder 
Twilight burns in my eyes [x2]

I fall on my knees, curse the sky
Every day I'm born, every day I die
All I have said all I was told
Nothing brings me closer to home
