[CD Bonus Track]Swimming through the seas
In my dreams,
Wounds that open up 
When eyes are asleep
Can't help falling apart 
At the weakest seams
Back stabbing lies, 
Singe the skin

All who I need
All I can't see
All I can think of
Bleeding love won't heal
All that I want
All I can't get
Something to live for

Something to live for

Thoughts that burn, 
Burning flesh
The storm is coming, 
All will change again
Eyes are blinded 
By dust on the wind
All like fog 
Above unknown land

All who I need
All I can't see
All I can think of
Bleeding love won't heal
All that I want
All I can't get
Something to die for

Something to die for
