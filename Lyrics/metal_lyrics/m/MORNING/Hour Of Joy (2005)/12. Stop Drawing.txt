[By Saskia van Heugten]

Our lives travelling gigantic
Over the landscape
Following the footsteps
That are left behind

We're drawing in the ground, the earth
Leaving our ways behind
Writing history again, over and over,
And over and over again...

Some thoughts flying around
From yesterday to an extreme
Leaving the footsteps
To follow another way

We're drowning in the ground, the earth
Leaving our ways behind
Writing history again, over and over,
And over and over again...

While breaking this world apart
Can see we're changing
Humanity's changing
Humanity's torn apart, I guess?
