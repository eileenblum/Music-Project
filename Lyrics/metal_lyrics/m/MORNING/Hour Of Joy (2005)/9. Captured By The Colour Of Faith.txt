Captured, here I am
Forcing the light to turn to me
But hereÂ´s nothing I can put to my will

Am I not strong enough to fight
Or is this struggle
IÂ´m going through useless?
Leave nothing to chance, as it is already deceided
IÂ´m captured by the colour of faith

Captured, here I am
Fighting these colours to turn to me
But here fighting seems useless

Am I not strong enough to fight
Or is this struggle
IÂ´m going through useless?
Leave nothing to chance, as it is already deceided
IÂ´m captured by the colour of faith

Captured, here I am
There is no use in forcing
There is no use in Fighting
There is no use in crying
There is no use in screaming
But itÂ´s a relief as IÂ´m still captured
