Thinking has made a mess of me
But as it is my state of mind
Maybe this will help you see
To eat me with your sharpest teeth
And beat me with your honesty

Hear my cry... Screaming loud!
You took place inside

Oh! This is a mess
That hasnÂ´t shown itself ever before to me
And I cannot bare to see the consequences
By not letting me know what it wants from me

Hear my cry... Screaming loud!
You took place inside

Is a piece from my mind
Is falling down...
