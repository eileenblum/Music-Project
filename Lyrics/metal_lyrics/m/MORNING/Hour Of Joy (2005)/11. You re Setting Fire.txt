[By Saskia van Heugten]

Your intentions are cruel
Thoughts they whisper to me
Emotional scars
You handed them

You can't wipe off the blame
You're like an evil creature
You'll burn in hell like a flame
You're setting fire! Yeah, you are!

Your intentions are cruel
Thoughts they whisper to me
Emotional scars
You handed them, to them, to them to them, to themâ¦

You can't wipe off the blame
You're like an evil creature
You'll burn in hell like a flame
You're setting fire!

Yeah you are!
Cause you are!
And you are!
Well you are!
