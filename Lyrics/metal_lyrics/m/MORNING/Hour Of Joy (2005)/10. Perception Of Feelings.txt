Watching you
In this state of great tension
I eagerly expexted by my inner life
To become more and more
In a state of self possession
My temper

The present day, it shows me a winding road
Coming up right in front of me
And there is no escape!
It seems like I have tried to find what IÂ´m need of!

This perception of my state of mind
Took away my irresolution
Finally I have chosen
To follow my own way
Yeah, follow my own way...
