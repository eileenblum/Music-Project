[By Saskia van Heugten]

I can see our shadows, playing on the wall, becoming one.

I open my arms
I can feel you
Breathing into me

You're flooding me with warmth
When you open
your arms.

It's feeling brighter
Then fire
A fire that's burning
A fire that's moving

Like our shadows, playing on the wall, becoming one.

When you open your arms
You move me, you heal me,
Oh what a feeling.
This is something,
Leading to this sensation of warmth.

It's feeling brighter
Then fire.
A fire that's burning
A fire that's been longing

Move me, heal me.
