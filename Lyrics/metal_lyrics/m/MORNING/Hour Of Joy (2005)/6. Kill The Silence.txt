[By Saskia van Heugten]

At this time,
You have stolen my happiness.
But maybe there's joy untold,
I might find it back some day.

'Cause there are feelings.
So much, too much

At this time,
I can hardly understand myself.
Why am I even listening?
Your shadows are too large.

When I'm feeling
So small, too small.

When my kindness falls apart,
Will I understand myself?
Or will all this fall apart in you
Fill you up with my anger, my hate
'Cause I hope it'll do, at this time.?

You darken my thoughts
So dark, so dark.

If these words could kill the silence between us
Then this one here is for you.
