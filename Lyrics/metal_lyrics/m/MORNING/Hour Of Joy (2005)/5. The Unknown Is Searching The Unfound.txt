[By Saskia van Heugten]

Turning around
circles in outer space
That's were it all began...

We're reaching certain movements
We've never been so close before
Watching eachother passing by
While following, following, following

Moving too fast, once we'll get stuck
Moving in circles, just call it bad luck
try to keep out, this is the danger zone

It seems to be a frozen summer
We'll be melting down?
No don't worry, it won't hurt,
It'll take a while before
We'll cut ourselves back into the ground
Turning around in circles..I won't!

Oh we are turning around, turning around, turning around in circles...
