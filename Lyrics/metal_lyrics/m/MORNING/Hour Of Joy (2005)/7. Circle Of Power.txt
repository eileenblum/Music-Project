[By Saskia van Heugten]

I cast around me
This circle of power
Inviting you with your charms
Now let this space around us
Be protected from all forces
That might come to do us harm...

Let's send out my wishes
Empower this circle
I ask of you
To take me along into serene ecstasy
Feel the energy passing through!

Blood is rushing
I feel you exist
Between my moves and thoughts
Your looks are mysteriously
Your words are fully decorated in that sense
So take me along

Let's send out my wishes
Empower this circle
I ask of you
Take me along into serene ecstasy
Feel the energy passing through!

I cast around me
This circle of power
Inviting you with your charms
Now let this space around us
Be protected from all forces
That might come to do us harm...
