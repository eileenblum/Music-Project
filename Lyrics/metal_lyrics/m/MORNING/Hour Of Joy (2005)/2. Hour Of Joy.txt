Welcome to this joyfull hour
Now is the time to realize
An iron will shows you the mood weÂ´re in tonight

This is where we gather
This is the great escape
Where itÂ´s happening
So now letÂ´s rock this stage!

I close my eyes
And listen carefully
Everthing is standing still

Accept for a shiver, this silent smile
Now let the speakers blow up your ears
Share your excitement
And weÂ´ll set the feast, we will
