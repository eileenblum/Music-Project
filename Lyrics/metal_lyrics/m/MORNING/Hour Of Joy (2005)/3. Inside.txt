[By Saskia van Heugten]

The air I feel tonight is curious
I can let the whole world see
what is inside of me.
You catch my breath again
You read my words again
You hear my voice again
Do you know me, do you care?

If I had wings
My feathers would be like leaves
Colouring with the coming of every new season.

All these feelings and thoughts
They are together as one, but broken
For a moment.
That's when you get curious about me,
Is it?

The people I feel tonight are curious
I hope your pleased
to meet the woman inside of me...

They catch my breath again
They read my words again
They hear my voice again
Do you know me, do you care?
