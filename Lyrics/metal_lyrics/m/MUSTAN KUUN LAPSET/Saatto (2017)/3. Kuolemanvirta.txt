I was a child when the fear found me, 
Itâs cursed thoughts coiled around me 
Alas, I sought a path, to escape its sadistic reality 
My senses flood, with fire and blood, 
Presented in such simplicity 
The clean line quakes, splits and breaks, 
Liken to roots beneath a tree 

The one divides 
Before my eyes 
Spreading out like veins, the imposters now ingrained 
The golden streets will flood 
With warring siblings blood 
An endless strife to prove, their pathway is the truth 

As their battlefield burns, I walk away 
On one another they turn, I turn away 

Splintered by survivalâs self-serving feral jaws 
Accompanied by its prideful, non-lamenting claws 
Youâve created and summoned 
The Destroyer of Mercy 
And 
The Maker of Lost Ways 

Detached I am drawn into the empty, expanding horizon as it is 
slowly unfolding itself 
My vision is fixed on the smoldering sun, sitting low in the 
formless hands of space 
Rays of light not unlike glowing swords ride in strange 
patterns through the skies 
Violent waves of hiltless blades shift and shake, turning calmly 
from gold to white 
They sever all that is within their grasp until this world bleeds
soft and quiet before me 
In the void I hear the whispers of long dead stars tell tales of 
order through disarray 
They say behind the veil of chaos lies peace 

Possession triggers change into tangible signs to see 
Barren of the fruit to bear, theyâre all strangers to me 

I wish them peace 
Respectfully
