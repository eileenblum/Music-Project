Here I stand
Alone
No-one by my side

I'm a dread to my friends
and everyone
Flees from me

But in You I put my trust
Let your face shine on me
My times are in your hands
Deliver me from my enemies

'Cause You are
My stronghold
My fortress
My shield and strength
When everything else fails

My eyes grow weak with sorrow
My soul and my body with grief
As I fall like a dying sparrow
And I feel there's no one to reach

But in You I put my trust
Let your face shine on me
My times are in your hands
Deliver me from my enemies

How great is your goodness
which you bestow in the sight of men
on those who take refuge in you.
In the shelter of your presence you hide them
from the intrigues of men;
in your dwelling you keep them safe
from accusing tongues.
[Ps. 31]
