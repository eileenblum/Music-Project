I have never done anything wrong...

Search yourself
See the light you thought you had is darkness
Hear me calling
I'm the one who's wounded for your transgressions

I dry up the sea
But I also make rivers to the deserts
I clothe the heavens with blackness
And also let the sun shine on everyone

You burdened ones come to the waters
Drink from the unfailing source
Everyone of you devastated
Call upon me while I'm near

Brace yourself
Your covenant with death will be annulled;
Hear me saying
Your agreement with the grave will not stand
[Isa. 28, Mt. 11]
