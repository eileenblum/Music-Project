You never change
Although this world cries in travail
You took the blame
'though through your word this world was made
You chose the pain
Although in glory you were born to live
You didn't die in vain
You won the death and rose up again

You are the only one
Whose power reigns forever
It shall be complete
That you have won the enemy

You gave your life to save
Us from the sheol's dark despair
Through your wounds you paid
The price that brought us freedom
The life will never end
The death is only a door to pass
You didn't die in vain
You won the death and rose up again
