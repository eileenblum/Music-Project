The things that you see
Will be destroyed
They will be torn down

The days will come
When not one stone
Will be left on a stone

There will be signs in sun
And moon and stars
...Awaiting...
And on the earth distress and confusion
At the roaring of the sea

Men will faint
Because of fear
Of what will come on the earth

The days will come
When not one stone
Will be left on a stone
[Lk. 21]
