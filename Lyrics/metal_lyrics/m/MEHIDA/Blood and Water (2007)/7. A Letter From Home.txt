I saw you there
Standing near
Waiting for a train
To take you away from here

I was there
Beside you
On the platform
You decided to go on your way

The wind is cold
Silent breeze of a memory makes it colder

Where have you been sweet child of mine?
I've cried so many tears knowing you suffer
No matter what you've done
All this time I wanted to tell you
You're welcome home

I'm still here
To hold you near
To let you heal through my wounds
I never left you alone
[Lk. 15]
