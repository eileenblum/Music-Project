Here, look at me
From your cross
I'm not worth a penny
I'm the biggest loser of all
I'm guilty under suffering sun
Shining above me slowly killing me

I only deserve to die
But please remember me in your kingdom

As a man
Condemned to die
Idesperately turned out to you
Then I heard the words of grace and truth
Piercing through my soul
Today you'll be with me in the Paradise
From now on you're mine
And I'll never let you go

It took some time
To walk my way
Got no reason to be proud of
The things I did and said
I was guilty under suffering sun
Shining above me slowly killing me...
[Lk. 23]
