A boundless slaughter
That you've been to me
Now I swallow your guts
Your fucking guts
A pleasant time
Your victim is mine
The fallout from mourn
Your beauty is far away
I'll slit your throat
Slice off your skin
I'm gonna take every fucking thing
From you
I am the reaper of your soul
Darkness fills my eyes
How many
How many peaces of my heart I've waste for you
And now there is not enough to live
Get the fucking bitch
The sun goes down with you
A boundless slaughter
That you've been to me
