The truth is what we deny
A part of us remains,
Where ever we have been
And tears will be shed
Let your eyes be mine
A time lapse
Through a cold winters night
That comes without a star
The sundown won't break the silence
I'll be left in darkness
I'm on my own again
Moments, just a fading memory
Of what I held
Losing myself in it
Tears will be shed
There is always an end to it
You are different
The path you walk has no end
Each step you take is paved with memories,
Never trail away
Further your soul will live in my heart
Only who's forgotten is dead
