Even if we expect heavy seas ahead
We abandon from our paths
The light at the horizon draws to a close
And darken clouds soared above us
The day I turn my head down
And found me forsaken
Is still far away
For all what's taken from me
And left unfinished
With every passing day
I don't need a handkerchief
Cause I have no more tears to shed
I don't need your charity
Ashes and ruins are left behind
Even in a lake of emptiness you can set an anchor
Grey reminders of bygone times,
I've payed heed for my life, instead of living it
Are gone with the wind so far
That's drifting me closer the horizon
I've payed heed for my life, instead of living it
