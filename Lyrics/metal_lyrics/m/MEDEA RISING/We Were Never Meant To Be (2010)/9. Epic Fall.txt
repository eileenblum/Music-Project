I've tried to figure it out
Why we have failed
Failed the story you've told me
When I fall asleep
In serenity
Forsaken
The dreams we live to see together
The dreams that say forever
I'm going step by step now
And leave behind the things you've said to me
No runaway just keeping the distance it deserves
Thanks for the secrets we've kept inside our hearts
Claiming them, to never let out
The seconds we've count,
Holding to never let end
And to forgive is to forget
And all that's left
Is an abiding memory
I'll always keep by my side,
Forever next to my heart
So it won't tear apart
Thanks for showing me who I never want to be
