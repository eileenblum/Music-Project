For so long
You've spreading lies around
Like a plague defiling the air
As far as you've gone
Telling the truth means
Believing the own lie
There is so much selfishness,
That you can fill an ocean with
A fucking ocean with
Hang her higher
So she's obvious for every open eye
Hang her higher
Count every single second she trembles to demise
Hang her higher
So her body won't soil the earth again
You wanna to see boundless skies
I'll show you god
Tearing off empty pledges
Out of your chest
A few heartbeats away from the end
The final stage won't be relent
This will be relentless
She gets what she deserves
