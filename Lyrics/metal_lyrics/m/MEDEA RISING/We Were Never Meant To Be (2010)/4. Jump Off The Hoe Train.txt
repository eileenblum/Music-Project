So what you're waiting for
She'll no longer meant to adore, you
Sucking dicks for dough
If she would be the epitome of a hoe
She would sit in the first row
Her heart will ever belong to any man
Jump off the hoe train
As the story goes:
You found a hoe that you like
Anything but that! you can't turn a hoe into a housewife
It's like trying to get blood from a stone
So show no remorse by crunching her every single bone
These nights you've prayed for her to don't be unfaithful
Are count till she bleeds everything her body contains
Without limitation
Are you aware that
The only love she shares
Rests between her fucking legs
My time has come
As her body
Rests six feet deeper
My time has come
As I bury her underneath
