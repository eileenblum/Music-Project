Let's take a walk a sunny day
And find those hidden roads
Which goes to secret places
And to magic nooks
Can you hear the whisperings
From the trees
They're fortelling memories
Creatures you've never seen catch
The gossip from the sizzling leaves
When we walk the alley of the oaks
To where those diffuse shadows loom
Underneath that mound of stone
There lives the beings of your denial
Shadows, luring eyes behind trees and
boulders, oh world of wonders
Can you see, can you see them
They are here closer than you
Wanted them to ever come to you
But it's for real not a fairy-tale
When we walk the alley of the oaks
To where those diffuse shadows loom
Was there something behind me?
What did move over there?
Hear voices and laughter
It's something else here!
