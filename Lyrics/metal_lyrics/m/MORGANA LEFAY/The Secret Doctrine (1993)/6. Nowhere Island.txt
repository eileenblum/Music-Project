I miss the evenings the small talk that we had
I miss your presence the good things and the bad
I smell the morning air the colours of the dawn
Things that matter now when it's out of reach
All the things I took for granted
I do now esteem
Every thing that I neglected
I wish to redeem
In this silence on nowhere island
I can see the life I had passing by
In the place of dying I'm weeping crying
Too late to be forgiven for my sins and lies
In this nowhere I'm looking back on life
What was my vision in life before I died - I know
That this place of emptiness a castody for souls
Will not bring me back no one hear my calls
All the things I took for granted
I don now esteem
Every thing that I neglected
I wish to redeem
In this silence on nowhere island
I can see the life I had passing by
In the place of dying I'm weeping crying
Too late to be forgiven for my sins and lies
My destination the cold eternity
I will forever roam through infinity
And I am doomed to silence in this astral skies
I want to be again I wish I were alive
All the things I took for granted
I do now esteem
Every thing that I neglected
I wish to redeem
In this silence on nowhere island
I can see the life I had passing by
In the place of dying I'm weeping crying
Too late to be forgiven for my sins and lies
