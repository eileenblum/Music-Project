What a cold world we rule
Preparing for war to keep the peace intact
White lies, politics and dirt
Thrown in our eyes
And where do we stand
And what are we thinking of
When so much is wrong
Why do we not care
Segregation and hate
Opinions and words of the fools who seek to rule
Shaved heads, lunatics with flags
Marching the streets
Oh, where are we now
And what are we going to
Is the world so insane
Are we doomed to lose
I will speak my mind if I so want to
This cold world sucks have we all gone crazy
When religion decays
Bullshit will save the faith, praise the lord
Brainwash, talk in tounges to god
Who'll never appear
Where will we be
And what will the future hold
We're listening to fools
And play by their rules
I will speak my mind if I so want to
This cold world sucks have we all gone crazy
