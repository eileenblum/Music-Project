I am the lord of the fallen
The ultimate rebel from paradise
A philosopher free thinking breed
The sovereign of anarchy
Legionaries of every tribe
This is where we dwell
A place of eternal dusk
We are the dignitaries of hell
Here we shall rule
Even though it isn't hell
I will retake
My lost paradise
Into the garden of Eden
As a serpent I come to tempt
I offer you to taste the fruit
From the tree of knowledge
I make you a demigod
I give you my thoughts
I want to make sure that you will be
A rebellion to the trinity
Here we shall rule
Even though it isn't hell
I will retake
My lost paradise
Fallen into the abyss of fire
Fallen into the abyss of fire
