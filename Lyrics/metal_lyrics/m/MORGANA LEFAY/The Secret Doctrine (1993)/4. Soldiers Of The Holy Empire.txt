Look into the dragons eyes
In the mist of dark forgotten times
Summon up the beast of flame
Unchain the warlord call its name
Children of the sun
Let him reign the chosen one
And save you from the night
In which you fear to die
The dragon rule with iron hand
Through blood - he'll reposses the land
From the dungeon to the throne
From the darkness freedom has been born
Soldiers of the sun
Let him rule the chosen one
And save you from the night
In which you fear to die
Soldiers of the holy empire
Hail the dynasty - the dragons eyes forsees victory
Soldiers of the holy empire
Hail the dynasty - make the enemy crawl
Soldiers of the sun
Let him rule the raging one
Into dawning light
The time of fear will die
Soldiers of the holy empire
Hail the dynasty - the dragons eyes forsees victory
Soldiers of the holy empire
Hail the dynasty - make the enemy crawl
