Dreaming - hagridden through my fear
By the circe of awakening
Stranger - take away the dark and
Save me from insanity
In this place unknown
They seek for souls
From the shadow zone
They're crawling into rooms of sleep
Creatures - are haunting my domains
Seeds of hell in my paradise
Screaming - dreaming that I dream
That I'm awake in this evil dwell
I am awake but I only dream
That I'm awake in the dream within
In a place unknown
They seek for souls
Hear the demons call
When they're crawling into rooms of sleep
Into rooms of sleep
Drowning - in my bed of pain
Falling deeper and deeper down
Stranger - take away the dark and
Wake me up from insanity
I am awake but I only dream
That I'm awake in the dream within
In a place unknown
They seek for souls
Hear the demons call
When they're crawling into rooms of sleep
Into rooms of sleep
