In this time of desolation
In this time of apathy
In the age of desperation
We're dying to be free
I will live in hell until I die
I will crawl this earth of dust and fire
My dying expectations
My dying will to live
The plague of radiation
I have no more to give
I will live in hell until I die
I will crawl this earth of dust and fire
This barren desolated place
Where evolution dies in disgrace
Dying evolution
We hailed the war
That devastated earth
We're now before a
Dying evolution
In this time of desolation
In this time of apathy
In the age of desparation
We're dying to be free
I will live in hell until I die
I will crawl this earth of dust and fire
This barren desolated place
Where evolution dies in disgrace
Dying evolution
We hailed the war
That devastated earth
We're now before a
Dying evolution
