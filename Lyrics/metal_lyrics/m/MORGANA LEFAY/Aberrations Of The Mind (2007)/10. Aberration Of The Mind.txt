It's a twisted reflection
On the door to my withering barrier wall

I burn

Strange are the roads
That lead to insanity
And thin is the line
Between sane and deranged

Just a little touch of...searching
Coming closer now
Just faces these bad illusions

Master I call!

Strange are the roads
That lead to insanity
And thin is the line
Between sane and deranged

So many times that I"ve been waiting here
For pieces of my life to come clear

Help me now - help me father
Help me tear out my mind
I was just a little claustrophobic
Evil these walls are

How many times have I been screaming in here?

You said that you'd be waiting for me sir saltwater
I never heard the charge!

What?

Do you care what I say?
No I don't

Pssst!
Help me!

Strange are the roads
That lead to insanity
And thin is the line
Between sane and deranged
