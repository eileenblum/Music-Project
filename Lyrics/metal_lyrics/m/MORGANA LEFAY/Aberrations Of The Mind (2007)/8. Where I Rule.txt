Go back to heaven
I don't need your lies
Oh, you fettered me down here
Far away from paradise

But now you need me
'Cause I hold the light
And the road to heaven is getting darker than the night
Darker than the secret of your might

Here I rule
In the shadow of your lies
Where I rule
In the shadow of your lies I crave their souls

Here I dwell
In the absence of your might
I rather rule in hell
Than be a slave in paradise

Why do you bother
Why do you care
You threw me down to earth
And made me your worst memory - your enemy for all eternity

Here I rule
In the shadow of your lies
Where I rule
In the shadow of your lies I crave their souls
