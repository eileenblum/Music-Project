Slowly waking up again
Holding onto dreams that fade away
Painted windows hide the light
I can't tell if it's day or night
Tired body - restless head
Getting up or stay in bed - I guess that time will tell

I think there is no show today
Oh, this timeless time
Or maybe that was yesterday
Confused, all the days go by
The sleepy sound when wheels go round
Travelling unknown roads
And miles go by while I am asleep
In this scalding heat

Over and over and over again

Broken cars and broken planes
Broken cases long delays
Missing the silence and peace of my home

I pull the curtain as were slowing in
Slowing in
Get undressed and go back to bed again
Hours of waiting
Drink some lukewarm bottled water
Heave a deep sigh try to sleep
Were at the venue that's OK
I should get up and try to seize the day

Before it's fading away

Broken cars and broken planes
Broken cases long delays
Missing the silence and peace of my home
