Stare in a hole that never lies
With the twinkle of an eye
And the shadow of a thought
You know that you'll die

Do I know
Do I know

Dead eyes face the sky
They are caught in the point of time

Do you know
If there's a tomorrow

See his fear
See how the soldier cries
If he moves he will die
See his fear
See how the soldier dies
With tears in your eyes

There's no retreat on this field of mines
In this hell that never ends
like beasts on a supper they feast
On their meals of soldier meat

Do you know
If there's a tomorrow

See his fear
See how the soldier cries
If he moves he will die
See his fear
See how the soldier dies
With tears in your eyes

Reflections of war

See his fear
See how the soldier cries
If he moves he will die
See his fear
See how the soldier dies
With tears in your eyes
