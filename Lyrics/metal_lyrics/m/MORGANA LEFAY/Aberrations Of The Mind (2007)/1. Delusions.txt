You think you're it
You think you're God
You think you're the meaning of life
That universe
Is spinning around you

I know your kind
Inflated mind
I know why you're going so blind
Your egotism
Your hyperbolic style

Delusions

Come back from the self-centered shadows and lies

You think you're it
You think you're God
You think you're the meaning of life
Why don't you see you're nothing
You're nothing at all

And no one else
Is good enough
So you're always there to correct
I see you die in solitude - alone

You pompous ass
Your eyes are shut
You think you're the center of earth
Just give it up
Your train of thought - absurd

Delusions

Come back from the self-centered shadows and lies

You think you're it
You think you're God
You think you're the meaning of life
Why don't you see you're nothing
You're nothing at all
