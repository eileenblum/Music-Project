They rise from the sea
Spreading their arcane philosophy
They prey on the weak
With cold and ruthless greed

Charlatans of hell

Vultures revolving
Awaiting their time, while darkening minds
Lying, deceiving
Evil in a saint's disguise

How they lie

Pestilence, war, famine and death
Spreading their wings - darken the light for us all

They promised you gold
Blind - like a fool you bought what they sold
Their powers unleashed
Sinister forces are free

Charlatans of hell

Vultures revolving
Awaiting their time, while darkening minds
Lying, deceiving
Evil in a saint's disguise

How they lie

Pestilence, war, famine and death
Spreading their wings - darken the light for us all
Pestilence, war, famine and death
They darken the light for us all
