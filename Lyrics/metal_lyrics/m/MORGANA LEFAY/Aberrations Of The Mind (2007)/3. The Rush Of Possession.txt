Behold the power of demons
As they crawl into hell
You are the sulphur the fire
The purple - the place where they dwell

I see shadows that move on the moon
And they seek for your dreams
You feel lust and temptation
You sweat then you freeze to the bone

The rush of possession

They are crawling in us all
Black spots inside our souls
Gloomy dark and devastating thoughts

You can breathe you can move you can think
But you've ceased to exist
There's a thought deep within
It's so dark - full of sin and destruction

And now the shadows command you
You are possessed by their wrath
And all the demons inside you
They feast on your shivering soul

The rush of possession

They are crawling in us all
Black spots inside our souls
Gloomy dark and devastating thoughts
