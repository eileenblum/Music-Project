Biding the time while a soul
Will transform into me
Satanica demonical, a miracle

Into the mind of my host
I my knowledge imbibe
Terrorized, hypnotized, equalized

Aligned with his powers
At last I receive my reward
Insanity, infinity, divinity

Twenty years I've sacrificed
To demonize a soul, and I know

Black is the color of darkness in total
Obscurity rules and in shadows I wait
In shadows I wait

I am the author of pain
The begetter of death

Corrupter of justice and innocence -
Stealer of life

I'm injustice, I'm torture, disease
I am hate

A spirit of malice -
Sworn enemy of all human race

Black is the color of darkness in total
Obscurity rules and in shadows I wait
In shadows I wait

Sometimes my sorrow awakes me
From torment and horror
Whenever I cry
In darkness I can't see
I long for the time when I was me
The voices return
And take over control

Black is the color of darkness in total
Obscurity rules and in shadows I wait
In shadows I reign
