I'm the man who is caught in the tread wheel
Born to live, work to die
You depend on the time between nine to five
Then you cheat on yourself with a lie

I just exist in a life without meaning
Without ambitions or dreams
Whenever you want then you say that you don't 'cause
A dream is a dream is a dream

Let's walk the way of adventure

So afraid - you never ever really walked this way
I am so sad to say - you never ever really seized the day
Nobody's crying for your wasted tears
For all the devastated wasted years
Let loose of all your apathy
When we break the rusty weakened chains

The spell that I'm in is not easy to break
I'm too scared and too set in my ways
Jump of the cliff take a chance and a risk
It's a wonderful world to explore

I hold my breath for the rest of my life
I cover my ears and close my eyes
Live in your dream (and) let's flow with the stream
Ponder the years of your life

Let's walk the way of adventure

So afraid - you never ever really walked this way
I am so sad to say - you never ever really seized the day
Nobody's crying for your wasted tears
For all the devastated wasted years
Let loose of all your apathy
When we break the rusty weakened chains
