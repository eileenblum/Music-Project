I only dream of evil - it's my affliction
I never see the light and I seek
in this dark and lonely place
Safe and out of sight
Totally forgotten
I am waiting to be found

Satisfaction lies within
A wish of vainly sin
Release my cunning deeds

Command

You only have to find me
In this darkness trapped within
A jaded stone of evil
I'm a shadow - I'm a djinn

Satisfaction lies within
A wish of vainly sin
Release my cunning deeds

Your wish is my command

Whatever you wish for
I make it come true
But my interpretation
Is in practice a spell over you

Whatever you wish for
I make it come true
