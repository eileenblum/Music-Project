[Nazareth Cover]

Weâve got to get it together
You bring the wine, weâll bring the weather
We havenât come to be clever
Letâs make it now cause this could be never
Were gonna Razamataz ya tonight
Were gonna razamanaz ya all night
Razamataz razamanaz up on your feet
Letâs see ya dance, dance, dance
Now that weâve come to a showdown
We wonât allow you a second to slow down
The moment has come to deliver
You as the taker, and we as the giver
Were gonna Razamataz ya tonight
Were gonna razamanaz ya all night
Razamataz razamanaz up on your feet
Letâs see ya dance, dance, dance
All of the world loves a raver
Weâre playin for ravers who savor the flavor
You all appear calm and collected
Razamanazinâ you never expected
Were gonna Razamataz ya tonight
Were gonna razamanaz ya all night
Razamataz razamanaz up on your feet
Letâs see ya dance, dance, dance
Were gonna Razamataz ya tonight
Were gonna razamanaz ya all night
Razamataz razamanaz up on your feet
Letâs see ya dance, dance, dance
