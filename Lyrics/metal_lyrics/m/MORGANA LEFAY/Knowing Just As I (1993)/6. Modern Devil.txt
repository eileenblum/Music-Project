I'm rumbling down that street of mine
There is no sun, but my car still shine
I'm burning rubber on that road
With my four-wheel drive
With explosive load
Born to drive, drive to die
Die to live, then drive again
I know that for me there ain't no grave
Because I am the death in a black beret
Horny girls, they wanna ride
So I take them in and fuck their pride
Razamanaz, I feel so alive
In my satanic turbo four wheel drive
Born to drive, drive to die
Die to live, then drive again
I know that for me there ain't no grave
Because I am the death in a black beret
I'm rumbling down that street of mine
There is no sun, but my car still shine
I'm burning rubber on that road
With my four-wheel drive
With explosive load
Born to drive, drive to die
Die to live, then drive again
I know that for me there ain't no grave
Because I am the death in a black beret
