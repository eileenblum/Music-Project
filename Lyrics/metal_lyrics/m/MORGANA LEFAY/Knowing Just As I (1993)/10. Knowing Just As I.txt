A small pain
A little pain
A big pain
A great pain
Growing here
Growing there
Growing slowly everywhere
The creature chants
While the spirits rise
While a dead man lives, a living man dies
Growing here
Growing there
Growing slowly everywhere
Choke, choke, choke
Devils we awoke
Thirst, thirst, thirst
Suffer until you burst
Cry, cry, cry
Fire burn your eye
Die, die, die
Knowing just as I

Line-up:
Charles Rytkonen - vocals
