Dark eyes staring through crystal
Wild laughs, demons of wisdom
Recall all the heretics of the dawn
Cry out the names of the angels
Spell god as in the beginning
Profane is the devil's grimoire

Salute the sage, he's the last in line
He sin too, well but so do I
He's in all, he's you and me
He is the king of infinity

Rise up, enter my shadow
Siege me, make me eternal
Save me, give me that piece of harmony
Pure me, sermon by fire
Burn up, envious liar
Black skies will darken
The world forever more

In a world of mystery
He shall rule, yes you shall see
He's in all, he's in you and me
He is the king of infinity

Dark angel of sin
He's calling to bring
Dark angel of sin
He's calling to bring

Preach me the sefer Jezirah
Dark years, Fata Morgana
Black tears falling for the Antichrist
Rise up, enter my shadow
Dark eyes, demons of wisdom
Black skies will darken
The world forever more

Salute the sage, he's the last in line
He sin too, well but so do I
He's in all, he's in you and me
He is the king of infinity
Dark angel of sin
He's calling to bring
