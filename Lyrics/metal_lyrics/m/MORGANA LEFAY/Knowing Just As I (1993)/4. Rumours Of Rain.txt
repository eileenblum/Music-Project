We are the elder of a race
We are sent to see we are one
And I am them all
We are neither black nor white
I am a paler shade of eternity and what
You can see
From the depths of humanity
You have let it loose
The tide of destiny
As I search for the holy one
Your life is running out of time
There's a rumour of rain
Pouring water so sustained
There's a rumour of rain
Pouring water in her veins
I'm making circles in the sand
With magic herbs I forfill
These pentagrams
Among the living I have searched
I can't find the truth
That's why I'm calling you
Deat father time, do not deny this call
As Lemuria, the Earth will fall
Veil the legacy of sinister
And all the evil that man do
There's a rumour of rain
Pouring water so sustained
There's a rumour of rain
Pouring water in her veins
Black dust of evil wars
Bloodsheds and broken laws
Blue skies are turning grey
Nuclear and gamma rays
There's a tomb for everyone
And for the deeds that you have don
I hold the keys to paradise
You hold the keys to sin and lies
I can't deny that we have laughed
At your society, power games
And technology
You fool of man, you inquire into things
You're not supposed to know
You don't know where the limit goes
From the depths of humanity
You have let it loose
The ride of destiny
As I search for the holy one
Your life is running out of time
There's a rumour of rain
Pouring water so sustained
There's a rumour of rain
Pouring wated in her veins
The darkest places
Are not paradise
I am the shadow
I am the depths of your soul
The tribes of earth have died
By the wave - the mighty tide
I have walked tomorrow's path
There I saw the shame of the past
There's a tomb for everyone
And for the deeds that you have done
But every sin and every crime
Shall be forgiven by the river of time
We have to go back to where we belong
Poor Mother Earth
We've been here far too long
We are flying back to paradise
On our wings of destiny
To a place where sorrow dies
From the depths of humanity
You have let it loose
The tide of destiny
As I search for the holy one
Your life is running out of time
There's a rumour of rain
Pouring water so sustained
There's a rumour of rain
Pouring water in her veins
