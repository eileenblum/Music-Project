Have I seen all there is to see?
Or is there more left to be?
The deepest of thoughts
The fantasies, the neverending
Harmonies
Here I am, locked in reality
In a world of anxiety
I have to escape
Explore the possibilities
Can dreams become true?
On a unicorn I am riding
To the wonderland
I'll hold her silver mane, face a dream
I wonder if I will return
From my journey to the wonderland
Far away, deep within universe
Through the arcades of mystery
The dullness is gone
My mind collecting pieces
Of a life I will live
On a unicorn I am riding
To the wonderland
Me they will rehabilitate with
A strait-jacket on
They wonder if I will return
From my journey in the wonderland
They are searching, but they can't find
I am hiding inside my mind
Can you keep a secret? I'm not me
I am forever in my fantasy
On a unicorn I am riding
To the wonderland
I'll hold her silver mane, face a dream
I wonder if I will return
From my journey to the wonderland
Wonderland, wonderland
Take me to that neverland
Wonderland
