In the chilly mist I stand
Petrified by her eyes
Dark but blazing eyes of
Endless night
Her velvet veil in silver grey
Shining through glistening tears
And while the colours fade
Around her, I can feel her sorrow
She can feel no happiness
As she feeds the night
And she cries for all the ones
She loved in life
So alone she weaps the dying
There is nothing she can do
Just guide us to the dark and
Lonely skies
She is the end
The stars will fall
Eternal night
Her sorrow calls
In the chilly mist I stand
Petrified by her eyes
Dark but blazing eyes
Dereaved of light
She is the key to the other world
And to the endless night
And her veil, embraces my soul
Combined, we fly away
She is the end
The stars will fall
Eternal night
Her sorrow calls
She's for real, no mirage
The incarnated night
Her sorrow calls, I must follow
And leave this life
What is life, what is death
Just a state of being
Nothing matters anymore
I must follow her call
She is the end
The stars will fall
Eternal night
Her sorrow calls
