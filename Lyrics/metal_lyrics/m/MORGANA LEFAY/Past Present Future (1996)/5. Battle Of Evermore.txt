The wise man and the vagabond
Walking on a mission
Searching for an answer
Looking for a sign
See, the seven seals have been broken
And the world has taken end
Manifestation on the horizon
The battle has begun
Angels fighting angels
Heaven is painted red
A crimson rain is falling
Down on the earth
That we have lent
Battle of Evermore
This is war
The battle of Evermore
Of Evermore
This is war
The battle of Evermore
The battle of Evermore
The battle of Evermore
The battle of Evermore
