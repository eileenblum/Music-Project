Why?
Taken away and gone forever
Cry
I will always remeber you
If I could turn back time
And make a new tomorrow
Lost
In memories I cry
These tears are meant for you
I'm crying over you
Why take away the life
Of an innocent child
A part of me will always
Be a part of you
Pain
A broken heart, a darkened soul
But life must go on
Even through the darkest times
These tears are meant for you
I'm crying over you
