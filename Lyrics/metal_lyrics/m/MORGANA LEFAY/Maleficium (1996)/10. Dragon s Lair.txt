[The Guardian - The Myth]

Dragon guarded the treasure
Glittering gold and silver
Smell of sulphur and fire
In the dragon's lair
Hidden in his mountain
Upon the bones of those who failed
With their heroic mission
To kill the sleeping beast
One eye always open
Watching you
Guarding gold and diamonds
Breathing doom
Greedy in his nature
But he can give, to the unarmed
A shiny piece of silver
To hold close to their heart
That they can keep his secret
Until it's time to fly
To bargain in Mangonia
A place beyond the sky
One eye always open
Watching you
Guarding gold and diamonds
Breathing doom
The dragon's lair
The guardian
The dragon's lair
The guardian
The dragon's lair

He gathers all the chosen
To worship mother earth
Charm them with his treasure
The knowledge they all need
They're waiting for transcendence
To walk the dragon's path
And spread his wisdom
The myth that they shall feed
One eye always open
Watching you
Guarding gold and diamonds
Breathing doom
The dragon's lair
The guardian...
