Before god you must tell the truth
As you know this is a trial
What have I done? I am innocent.
I do not understand
Oh, I see you deny the crimes
Let us find out what is true
What do you do, What's going on?
Tell me where I am

Welcome, to the cellar of pain
Let the questioning begin
I'm the chief magistrate
In god I put my faith
Blasphemous lying beast
The devil is your lord
Insane, a big mistake
What have you been told?

I want you to tell me
Kneel and confess what you are
I'm a master of torture
But the pain that you feel is the dark

The source of...
The source of pain
To the end of your life and forever more

The source of...
The source of pain
To the end of your life and forever more

Look around, what you see
Is gonna make you talk
Chains and racks don't frighten me
I'm innocent and free
Is that a sarcastic tongue
I hear in front of me?
I don't care what you think
But scare me you cannot

I want you to tell me
Kneel and confess what you are
I'm a master of torture
But the pain that you feel
Is the dark

The source of...
The source of pain
To the end of your life and forever more
