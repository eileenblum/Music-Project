[The Chief Magistrate - A Message from Beyond]

Child of life, hear me cry
I'm calling from the other side
On forgotten waves, beyond my grave
I send you thoughts so save your prayers
Never say die, you have to rely
On your inner strength that never dies
I'm relieved, my spirit's free
From here I rule my own destiny

The retribution, fly on wings
Eating falseness, blame and sin
Endless rows of crucified
All tormentors that us denied
Here they suffer, here they pay
Here they will forever stay
Understand my situation
I am a revenging angel

Where fallen angels rule
I've seen the future in my dreams
Evil is a giant wheel
That's rolling on through endless time
With its perfect flawless chime
Manipulating man and mind
Make 'em greedy, senseless, blind
But here they hang, the wretched fools
In this land where angels rule
Where fallen angels rule
