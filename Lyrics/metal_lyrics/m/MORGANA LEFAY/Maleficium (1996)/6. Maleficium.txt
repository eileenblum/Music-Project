I'm burning - in fire
So hard to stand against the flames
Deception - who told them
About the magic I possess?
The power - from your well
Are slowly peter out
Mother - of Tellus
Give me strength
To cast a spell

You burn me now
Before them all
You fear my kind
Because of the things I know

Magic knowledge
Ancient secret rituals
Black forbidden
Maleficium

Save me - I'm dying
Give me a shelter after life
Curse them - my tormentors
Give them the spell of the purple sand

You burn me now
Before them all
You fear my kind
Because of the things I knwo

Magic knowledge
Ancient secret rituals
Black forbidden
Maleficium

I'm boiling - I'm coming
Hail you, the guardian of the earth
I'm burning - and dying
But wait and witness my rebirth

You burn me now
Before them all
You fear my kind
Because of the things I know

Magic knowledge
Ancient secret rituals
Black forbidden
Maleficium
