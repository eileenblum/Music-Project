[The Guardian - The Secret Truth]

In secret I am, earth and hell
Beginning and the end
In darkness I dwell, inside my shell
With honour to defend

Let my spirit grow in peace
Take away your false beliefs
Witches' garden - mother earth
I am death and I am birth
The secret knowledge

In dust of thoughts, from open doors
I watch you rape my soul
By torturing the secret truth
The keepers and my youth

Let my spirit grow in peace
Take away your false beliefs
Witches' garden - mother earth
I am death and I am birth
The secret knowledge

Christianity, a try to rule
A tribute to the fools
You've set me free, the entity
That holds the mystery
Let my spirit grow in peace
Take away your false beliefs
Witches' garden - mother earth
I am death and I am birth
The secret knowledge
The secret knowledge
