[The Guardian - The Awakening]

You have awakened me
From my deep lethargy
Finally, you have gone too far
With your deeds
How many innocents have you
Killed, you hands of god?
You practise the evil that you
Accuse your victims to conduct
In the end you will be punished
Into the purple eternity
And I will live forever
Because I can't be defeated
