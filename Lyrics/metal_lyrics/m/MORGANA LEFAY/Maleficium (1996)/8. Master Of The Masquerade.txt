[The Guardian - Anger and Damnation]

Pain - doesn't matter much to me
I was born out of chaos of time
So I knoe what suffering means
Rage - I am black inside my soul
Don't you know that I'm hiding inside you?
I am the master of disguise
A new wind of justice shall blow over earth
The soul that you keep is going to be reborn

Awake - I will conquer once again
My power shall rule over you
And crush the evil that you do

Shame - what do you think I am
You moulder my roots with your trials
How many victims have died
A new wind of justice shall blow over earth
The soul that you keep is going to be reborn
The master of the masquerade
I am
The master of the masquerade

Die - wither in my hell
My black soul is all over you
I'll get you, you know that I will
Lies - you charlatans of Christ
You indoctrinate all the ones you scare
Then - you control, their fear

Shame - what do you think I am
You moulder my roots with your trials
How many victims have died
A new wind of justice shall blow over earth
The soul that you keep is going to be reborn
The master of the masquerade
I am
The master of the masquerade...
