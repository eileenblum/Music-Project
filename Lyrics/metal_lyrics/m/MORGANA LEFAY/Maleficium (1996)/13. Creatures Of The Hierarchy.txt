[Vultures Fete]

Beyond the wall, there's a land of gold
Hard to believe, but it's for real
A prolongation of your dreams

It has been there since the dawn of time
In astral skies, there live the allies of the
Secret hierarchy

Eternal hunger, rule their destiny
They're taking care of
The malice and malignity
Eyes of fire, tremendous signity
Screaming flyers
The creatures of the hierarchy

They are the servants of a thousand kings
They ride the wind, on giant wings
Obey their masters, eating sin

There is a place in this paradise
A purple hell, a desert land
Where darkness suffer to the end

Eternal hunger, rule their destiny
They're taking care of
The malice and malignity
Eyes of fire, tremendous dignity
Screaming flyers
The creatures of the hierarchy
