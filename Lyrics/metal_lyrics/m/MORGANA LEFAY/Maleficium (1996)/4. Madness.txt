[The Chief Magistrate - Beyond Pain]

The crazy man inside my head
Waking up with empty eyes
He envies me, wishes that I was dead
My common sense wants to see him die

Taking over more and more
He's screaming through my soul
He uses my eyes to make me see
The world in a twisted reality

The power of madness
Is tearing down my mind
Into the darkness of fools
Where shadows lurk and madness rules

Madness, madness, madness
Madness is tearing down my mind
Madness, madness, madness
Madness, my senses going blind

Too late for me, insanity
Is spreading like a disease
My body shake, a nervous ache
I'm going crazy
Help, for god's sake

The power of madness
Is tearing down my mind
Into the darkness of fools
Where shadows lurk and madness rules

Madness, madness, madness
Madness is tearing down my mind
Madness, madness, madness
Madness, my senses going blind

I'm laughing at god
And I'm laughing at satan in hell
I'm fettered in chains on the rack
Suffering god's torture and pain
Inquisition, a demon you are
Take a life to find out a false truth
But after you've stolen my life
you'll suffer the vultures' fete

I confess, I'm the one, take my life
Make it done, once and for all
I feel no more, care no more, see no more
The pain is gone
Madness is stronger than mind

In this land where I am
Everything is fine
You torture me, but I am free
I feel nothing, crazy me
The power of madness
Is tearing down my mind
Into the darkness of fools
Where shadows lurk and madness rules

Madness, madness, madness
Madness is tearing down my mind
Madness, madness, madness
Leave the common sense behind
