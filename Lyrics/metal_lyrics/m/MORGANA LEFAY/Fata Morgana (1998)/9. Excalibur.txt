The battle's lost
The army scattered in destruction
The king is dead
He drove his sword into a stone
A land without a king
Who'll be the one to follow?
No one managed
No man worthy of the throne
Break the spell, you son of a king
Excalibur awaits you
Rule our land, guide us the way
Give us back the glory we once had
In his court of Camelot
The knights of the round table
To lead the Britains
Is his life and prophecy
Deceived by Morgana Lefay
His bastard sister
Berawed, was left the nation
Of sorrow and of plague
He's the eyes of the war
He's the force of the law
Magician absolute
He's the eyes, he's the ears
Knowing lies and your fears
The sorcerer supreme
He's the eyes of the war
He's the force of the law
Magician absolute
He's the eyes, he's the ears
Knowing lies and your fears
The sorcerer supreme
Must solve the quest of time
The grail is the salvation
Saved from evil and
Abandoned to be found
Hail the king
Heed the dragon's fire
Called up with anger
From the deepest agony
Break the spell, you son of a king
Excalibur awaits you
Rule our land, guide us the way
Give us back the glory we once had
