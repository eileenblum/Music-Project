Three rings for the elven-kings under the sky,
Seven for the dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,
Nine for the mortal men doomed to die,
One for the dark lord on his dark throne
In the land of Mordor where the shadows lie
One ring to rule them all one ring to find them
One ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
In the land of Mordor where the shadows lie"
The lord of the rings
The one of them all
The lord of the rings
Gets into your soul
Three rings in the elven-land defying the dark
The dwarf-lords have lost their rings three have been found
By the mortal men now bearing Sauron's mark
The war of the ring begins on evil ground
In the land of Mordor where the shadows lie
One ring to rule them all one ring to find them
One ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
In the land of the dark lord where freedom dies
The lord of the rings
he one of them all
The lord of the rings
Gets into your soul
