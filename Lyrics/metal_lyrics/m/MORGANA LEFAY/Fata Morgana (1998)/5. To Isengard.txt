To Isengard though Isengard be ringed and barred with doors of stone
Though Isengard be strong and hard as cold as stone and bare as-bone...
We go we go we go to war to hew the stone and break the door
For bole and bough are burning now the furnace roars we go to war
To land of gloom with tramp of doom with roll of drum we come we come
We come we come with rool of drum with horn and drum we come
