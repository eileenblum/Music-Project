You twist and burn -
In the hell inside your head
Come back - return -
From the valley of the dead

You live - it's a miracle you can't resist
You live your life - it's a miracle can't resist

Don't cry
It's your life and you are free
Don't cry
There's no time to die

You are blind gone and suicidal
You try to die but you live and it's not too late

You are the face of all your fears
You have to face all of your fears

You burn -
It's a feeling you can ignore
Return -
From the deplorable state of mind

You are blind gone and suicidal
You try to die but you live and it's not too late

Why
Why do you stare into death
Try
One step at the time

You are blind gone and suicidal
You try to die but you live and it's not too late

You are the face of all your fears
You have to face all of your fears
