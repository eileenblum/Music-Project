In nomans land between
Heaven and hell
Madness is chanting my name
Thousand souls
Erratic in life
Chained in noplace
Berawed their heaven
Out of tune noises
Pulsating my mind
A fatal opera
Inferno of sounds
My conscience fading
Fading

Nowhere in time
Yesterday is tomorrows today
Yesterday is tomorrows today
Shadeless faces
Souls with no name
Standing hypnotized
Going insane
Hearing helplessly - listen

To the symphony of the damned

I search for light that I can't find
I search for shadows in this life behind
From south of heaven they are calling for me
Through this hysterical psychic custody
I feel hands of compact nothing
Tighten its grip on me

Symphony of the damned

Corridors blindly I can see them
Flashing by in the shadows of my conscience
There's a voice calling for my soul
In my mind the senses overflowing
To a peak past of what is human
As a god I spread my wings - I fly
I am alive, I got the fire, got the rage,
Like a giant bird of prey
I am the night, I'm the dark, I'm the raven,
I'm the one that you would call
Descended from the sky
Like tears lost in the rain
That music fades...
I'm sweeping over paradise
Where this god rules in disguise
Further on to a higher plane
Where I'm promised to be born again
Like tears lost in the rain
That music fades...that...

Symphony of the damned
