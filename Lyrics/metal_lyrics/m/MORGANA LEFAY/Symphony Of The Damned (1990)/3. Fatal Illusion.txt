Staring through a dusty window
Feel the cold from the barren walls
Inside his mind the voices calls

A portrait hanging face betraying
Wicked gleaming eyes from hell
The portrait knows his name
Is he insane

Nowhere to run
From the things that he have done
Sally screams his name in his mind
Sally's eyes the portrait tell no lies
Sally wants his life

She's sweeping through the dark horizons
Through the astral planes of earth
Sally wants revenge a second birth

From the pictures eyes she sees him
Sees the man that took her life
He's going mad he's lost reality

Nowhere to run...
From the things that he has done
Sally screams his name in his mind
Sallys eyes
The portrait tells no lies
Sally wants his life
He's screaming

Help me - Sally's calling
Save me - insanity
Help me - Sally's calling
Save me - insanity

She cause him pain
By haunting him insane
Hysterical laughs
She force him to his grave

Feel the cold from barren walls
His body holds his soul
For all eternity he's sold
Crying for some peace of mind
He's crawling on the floor
To high to reach
To low to fall
Nowhere to run...

Help me - Sally's calling
Save me - insanity
Help me - Sally's calling
Save me - insanity
