Fourty tons of armoured death
Still is rolling
Onward through their trenches
Damnation bell is tolling

A war without survivors
Destruction is in hand
Morbid mad mutations
Walking desolated land

In the end mankind
Pay the price
Of powerhungry nations
And generals lies

War without end
War
War
War without end
War war war

Killing fields that never ends
Open graves remains
Death lurks in all that lives
A barren tomb for us is calling

Fourty tons of armoured death
Still is rolling
Onward trough their trenches
Damnation bell is tolling

In the end mankind
Pay the price
Of powerhungry nations
And generals' lies

War without end
War
War
War without end
War war war
