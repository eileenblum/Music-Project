The day after the night before
Remember nothing as I face the floor
A pounding headache a smell of death
I guess it must be my own breath

Remember girls
And plenty of booze
And my tequila desire

Striptease
The metal police
Then I remember nothing more
Because I was
Passed out on
Tequila - blackout

Rise and shine stupe and puke
Shit I'm freezing oh god I'm nude
I've been arrested that's for sure
Else I wouldn't face
This god damn floor

Remeber girls
And plenty of booze
And my tequila desire

Striptease
The metal police
Then I remember nothing more
Because I was
Passed out on tequila - blackout
