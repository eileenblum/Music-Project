I'm your nightmare
Longing just for you
You can hear my breath
And I can hear yours to

Like a creeping shadow
Hiding from the day
Wait until the darkness
To take your life so pray
You can not run
You can not hide
I gonna catch you if you try

You're longing for the morning
And for that special light
It makes you feel safe
But it'll be another night

Your blood is boiling
It makes you paralyzed
You are my only
You are my sacrifice

You can not run
You can not hide
I gonna catch you if you try
