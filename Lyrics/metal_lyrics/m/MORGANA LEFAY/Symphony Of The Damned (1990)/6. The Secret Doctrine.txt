In the secret doctrine I have read
From the creation
And its manifoldness has sprung
And that the hord of evil is not dead
And that armageddon already has begun
About forgotten places I have read
And secret paths to heaven and hell
Names of angels, life and death
All that is mentioned clear and well
In the secret doctrine of heaven and hell
