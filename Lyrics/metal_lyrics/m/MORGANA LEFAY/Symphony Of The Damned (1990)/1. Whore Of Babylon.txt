There's a woman causing shame
To sacred thoughts she holds
The chalice with every man`s sin

Her alabaster skin is covered
With purple and gold
There she rides on a desolate soul
Her nefarious actions and
Fornications are known
By this world and the kings
Who shall come
Her influence will grow
As she saws the seeds of sin

There she is
The whore of Babylon
Rinding with the devil
She will live forever
Hail the whore
The whore of Babylon
Spreading sins and shame
Forever more
The whore of Babylon

Man built their empires
All over the world, the whore
Built them to crumble and fall

Her legacy follows
The new generations to come

There she is
The whore of Babylon
Riding with the devil
She will live forever
Hail the whore
The whore of Babylon
Spreading sins and shame
Forever more
The whore of Babylon

As the sun commands the shadow
To darken the world she forces
Our cities to fall to decay

And without knowing
You hold the ember of sin

There she is
The whore of Babylon
Riding with the devil
She will live forever
Hail the whore
The whore of Babylon
Riding with the devil
She will live forever

The whore of Babylon
