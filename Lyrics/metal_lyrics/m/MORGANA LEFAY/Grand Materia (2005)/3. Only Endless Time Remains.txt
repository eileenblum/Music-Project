Sometime I miss the life before
When there was no forever more
It's bittersweet to live forever
All the friends around me died
So did my emotions and cries
It took me a long, long time to learn to live my life

In the mists of my memories
And on the shores of the centuries
I do sometimes find a piece of harmony

But I recall pain as well
Tremendous sorrow and regrets unveiled
It's bittersweet to live and never die

I have seen it all and even more
I have lived through countless wars
But love torments me more than anything I know
In the corridors of time
Behind the doors to my deepest mind
I will always keep the ones I loved alive

In the mists of my memories
And on the shores of the centuries
I do sometimes find a piece of harmony

But I recall pain as well
Tremendous sorrow and regrets unveiled
It's bittersweet to live and never die

Only endless time remains

In the corridors of time
Behind the deepest of my mind
Well, only endless time remains
