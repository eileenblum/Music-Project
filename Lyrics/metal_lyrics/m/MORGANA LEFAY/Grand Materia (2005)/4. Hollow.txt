[Nicholas Flamel:]
Something's here, it's everywhere
It's sad and cold, it's in the air
Hollow voices, mumbling talk
Limping steps, when someone walks
Staring eyes, from a sallow face
In the mirror, in the haze
A bell that chimes, from behind
The walls or doors, or from the other side

Hollow â there's the hollow sound of a bell
Hollow â hollow sound of hell

The soul: I want you no harm, just make a friend
In this lonely endless end
I sense your fear, I feel it well
I hear it too, the sound of a bell

Hollow â there's the hollow sound of a bell
Hollow â hollow sound of hell
Hollow â there's the hollow sound of a bell
Hollow â hollow sound of hell

Entity: you deny me, when I'm there
As if I was just, mist and air
I will reach you with my chime
I'm the ringer of infinite time

Nicholas flamel: shadows move, haunting me
Sucking all my energy
The soul: why don't you come, when I call
You never speak, no never at all

Entity: I summon you, with my chime
I want your soul it is mine
The more I crave, the more you die
The more I sense that I'm alive

Hollow â there's the hollow sound of a bell
Hollow â hollow sound of hell
Hollow â there's the hollow sound of a bell
Hollow â hollow sound of hell
