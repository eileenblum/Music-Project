Black eyed strangers trapped in time
Oh, bitter angels caught behind
The thought â given only to mankind
Legions of the seraphim
The fallen army stained with sin
Patiently they're waiting for the end
The fall of time
From where fallen angels rule
The hatred never seems to fade
Their malicious dark deception
Closing in

From where fallen angels rule
The hatred never seems to fade
Their malicious dark deception
Soon fulfilled

Giving coded secrets to
Some chosen of the race of man
So that grand materia can be found
Eagerly they're waiting for the
Monumental moment when they fly
Once again free and unbound
They are trapped in time

[x2]
From where fallen angels rule
The hatred never seems to fade
Their malicious dark deception
Closing in

They are trapped in time
In terrestrial skies
Fallen angels, darkened angels, blinded angels, poisoned by their hate

From where fallen angels rule
The hatred never seems to fade
Their malicious dark deception
Closing in
