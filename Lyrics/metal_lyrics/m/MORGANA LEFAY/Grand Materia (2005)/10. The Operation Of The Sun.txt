As below, so above;
And as above, so below
With this knowledge you may work
Miracles (I know)
And all things emanate,
From the one who is the cause (fate)
All things are born (after their kind)
From this one

The sun is the father, its mother is the moon
Earth â the guardian and its nurse
It's the father of all things
Eternal will is contained (within)

This is the truth, with out falsehood,
Certain and most true

I possess the three
Parts of the philosophy
Of the whole world
The operation of the sun

This is what I know
The consummated sum
Of the work â
The operation of the sun

(Thou shalt) separate the earth from fire
The subtle from the dense (bla bla)
Gently with, unremitting care (and wisdom)

It ascends from earth to heaven
And again descends to earth
And receives the strength of the
Superior (and the) inferior

This is the truth, without falsehood,
Certain and most true

I possess the three
Parts of the philosophy
Of the whole world
The operation of the sun

This is what I know
The consummated sum
Of the work â
The operation of the sun

By means of this one thing
All the glory of the world
Shall be yours
And all obscurity (shall) flee from you

It is power of all power
It will dispel all ignorance
By this one, the world was created

This is the truth, without falsehood,
Certain and most true

I possess the three
Parts of the philosophy
Of the whole world
The operation of the sun

There's nothing more to say (nothing more to say about)
The consummated sum
Of the work â
The operation of the sun
