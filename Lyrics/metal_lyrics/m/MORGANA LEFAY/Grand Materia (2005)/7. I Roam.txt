Wherever I walk no shadow will fall
I hold it inside me, the angel my soul
This dark opacity-following entity fly
Inside my domains, prisoned in mind

I tamed my shadow and
I roam â in my non- existing shadow
I roam â in a world that goes round and round

Can the eyes of a man understand what they see
When they see the loss of the shadow of me
For your eyes non existing, invisible, missing and gone
But your brain's apprehension will tell that it's there in the sun

I tamed my shadow and
I roam â in my non- existing shadow
I roam â in a world that goes round and round
I roam â with my invisible shadow
I roam â in my non- existing shadow I roam

You walk - this earth - with a dark reflection - a curse
That has to wait â until the end â of your life to get free and transcended
But not the shadow of me â no, not the shadow of me.

I roam â in my non- existing shadow
I roam â in a world that goes round and round
I roam â with my invisible shadow
I roam â in my non- existing shadow I roam
