I have found a little hideaway
It's a place not so far away
Like a nest in my mind
Where I rest and sense no time
There I am as much as I can
As an old and crumbled man
And I hide from the pain and sorrow
That I fear

Behind this barrier I can
Just deny all the thoughts
No cause and action (effect/consequence) there at all

An emotional sanctuary
Time has gone too far to turn around
The pain I feel
Will fade away
â cause life goes on
In a colder way
An emotional sanctuary

Like a spider in a web of dreams
I control my sanctuary
And the walls that I've built
Are my lost memories

Cause I'm living in aworld of madness
And the only place to heal
Is the place too close for man to find
And feel

Behind this barrier I can
Just deny all the thoughts
No cause and action ) there at all

An emotional sanctuary
Time has gone too far to turn around
The pain I feel
Will fade away
Cause life goes on
In a colder way
An emotional sanctuary
