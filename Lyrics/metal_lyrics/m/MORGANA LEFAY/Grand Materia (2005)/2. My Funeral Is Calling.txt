Heartbeats pounding - almost sounding
Under my skin
In disguise â I'm about to begin
To stage my plan â my decease
Am I insane
Qualms of remorse â what a sinister deed
Betrayal â they're close to reveal what I am
Brothers I thought that I had
Greed takes possession of man
My funeral is calling

Dead man poor man - you'll die twice
To cover my life
Decomposed â in a chamber of mine
My death is done â soon I'm free
Vanished and gone
A dead man lives â a living man dies

Betrayal â they're close to reveal what I am
Brothers I thought that I had
Greed takes possession of man
My funeral is calling

Inquisition, church, disciples
I fooled you all
Veiled and secured â is the secret, my soul
O'er that grave â they will pray
For a dead man unknown
I will live on â through time and beyond

Betrayal â they're close to reveal what I am
Brothers I thought that I had
Greed takes possession of man
My funeral is calling
