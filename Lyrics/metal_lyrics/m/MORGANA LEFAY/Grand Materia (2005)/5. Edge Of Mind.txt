Life â deep within all lies a
Shadow a soul
To find â and to hold it is to hear
How insanity roars
Something comes with the
Knowledge of all
That is deeper and darker and
See through my soul

Face to face â I crumble before
The being of all

The edge
At the edge of all life and beyond
The edge at the end of my mind

Time â is wrapped all around me
And choking my thoughts
And eyes â staring right through me
For secrets I hold

Trying to find
The shadow inside me â
Find it and take it
While I'm petrified

Face to face â I crumble before
The being of all

The edge
At the edge of all life and beyond
The edge at the end of my mind
