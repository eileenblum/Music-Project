Knowledge
Beyond the knowledge I had
A fool was I for sure
Still my thoughts belong to my mind
But slowly they are fading
Away to become
A part of timeless time
I wonder who I am and why
Where am I and why am I alive
It's time to rest now
Rest and reconcile with time

Silence I'm drifting away with the currents
Of time to become
Absorbed by timeless time
And there by the shores â the beginning of all
My shadow is waiting for me to be whole
I'm the essence of my soul

I wonder who I am and why
Where am I and why am I alive
It's time to rest now
Rest and reconcile with time
It's time to rest now
My task is done

I wonder who I am and why
Where am I and why am I alive
I thought that I was doomed to die
But here I am to face a blood red sky
