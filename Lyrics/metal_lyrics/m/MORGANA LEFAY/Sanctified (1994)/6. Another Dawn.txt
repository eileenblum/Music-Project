Oh Daddy come and see please come and talk to me I am so alone and scared
No, you must not cry I know I am gonna die but I need to see you strong
Death is getting close within please hold me in your arms when I fly away
Daddy, are you here can you see her eyes they're gleaming like the stars
An angel from above she wants me to come to the shining light
I see visions giant birds of prey will come to take me far away
I ain't scared no more the place where I will go will take away the pain
you are fading away to a shade of grey and I meet another dawn
