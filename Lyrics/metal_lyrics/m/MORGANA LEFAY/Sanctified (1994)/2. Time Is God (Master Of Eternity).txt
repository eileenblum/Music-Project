I have been in tomorrow there was not much to see
I was the only one cause no one else could be
Well time was there as an insult to the watch he is the master of eternity
There is time to gain there is time to lose we are ruled by its course
we live and we die but time goes on through every now
forever more- the time is god

He is a collector of everything we do and every scene goes on forever more
I have seen the echoes from the past in a dimension never known to us
There is time to gain...
Always presence and never late he does not care he is just watching our fate
And whatever we are supposed to do
we cannot change the fact that we are ruled
There is time to gain...
