Mad Messiah falls but hallowed you were sanctified
your fantastic lies were followed by the weak and blind
they believed in you so badly and practised what you preached
you took the name of god in vain were you man or beast
Your assembly and requiem your prophecy of doom
the redeemer in the sky did he laugh or cry
You lead them to the doom god's almighty lord praise the fools of earth
Mad messiah salvation by fire
If he told you what to do god must be evil too
in desperation humiliation you took their lives away
Your bad religion and sectarianism it is all a mad man's work
dehumanized then sacrificed to an empty sky
You lead them to the doom god's almighty lord praise the fools of death
Mad Messiah salvation by fire
Mad Messiah you were a liar just a fraud and fake
what is there to say you burned in hell I hope you were satisfied
You lead them...
