Leviathans from my bed everything is spinning around my head
in the ceiling there is a hole a black nothing wants me to come
I believe that all our fantasies becomes real in the void and in our dreams
I embark the cimmerian skies and I see a man with flagrant eyes
I penetrate his empty shell he is the oracle of hell
I believe that all our fantasies becomes real I believe in evil dreams
Out in the silence of death into the palace of darkness
is this a dream where I die
In this emptiness I fly my memories begin to fade
I don't remember who I am I was and now I am again
Out in the silence of death into the palace of darkness reincarnation new life
