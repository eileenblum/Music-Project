[Dedicated to Jens Roos 1978-1986]

Why? Taken away and gone forever cry I will always remember you
If I could turn back time and make a new tomorrow lost in memories I cry
These tears are meant for you I'm crying over you
Why take away the life of an innocent child
a part of me will always be a part of you
Pain a broken heart, a darkened soul
but life must go on even though the darkest time
