Embracing the fond nocturnal glow
While everybody seek weak heavens
Regress and push our wrath on, your curse does not affect us
Never infect us, no slight chance to defect us
We are obsessing, obsessing with power
With shadows so dear protecting all that lies, attacking their rear

This ink is our blood, it lays down written in undying sphere
Conjuring as wizards in order of fear, the saturnine chapter is here

Rejecting the devious path of men
While filling out the void so savage
Progress and put the stones on, your curse does not affect us
Never infect us, no slight chance to defect us
We stay on course in the final hour
With shadows so dear protecting all that lies, attacking their rear

This ink is our blood, it lays down written in undying sphere
With devilish oppression, striking down the ones not willing
The gateways wide open, our demons are tramping near
Conjuring as wizards in order of fear, the saturnine chapter is here

Corporate disease, it's not a question of getting closer
Fraudulent it seems, gonna bury it and make them undone

Conjuring as wizards of fear, the saturnine chapter is here
Divided we are standing, obsessing with power
