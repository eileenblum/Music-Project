This planet of disgust, where worms will bite their way
So foul and devouring, they soil our sacred
Light which is fading, expiring once for all now
Feels like solitude has set in
We will carve this sign into our bones, never taste defeat

Strike with a vengeance, to cut these rotting bonds
So loose and dispensing, they will not hinder
Fire which is burning, extinguishing nevermore now
Feels like attitude's not breaking
We will walk this path until the end, defile their fucking graves

Abominations receive our sharpened knives
Distract with pain and deceit, they all die
We bow down on our lord's killing fields
Never have been pushed back, the brotherhood of destruction

Time for a shutdown, of this despicable system
So dead and remaining, no further asked now
Liars in our inferno, eternally glowing bright now
Feels like we have claimed our kingdom
We will save this light and never let it fade until the end

We see, now we feel and we never
Never allow the black flame's fading
