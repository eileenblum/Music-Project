Cathartic enhancement, unravel the secrets of this world
Unlocking infinity, all powers to the flesh
Which holds the spirit, containing all the patterns to be

Trail of the heretic
These eyes were meant to see
Path beyond the veil, malevolent sorcery

Demonic possession, unfolding the pleasant taste of death
Expelling ambiguity, all senses to the core
That molds the essence, destructing all the frailty I see
Tearing down these walls of deities with blood and iron

Deadly, accessing this lycanthropy
Unholy order laying awake
And time's distinctive features are living through me

Augmented is my strength as I'm coming down for you
Overpowered are your repellents, the wolfs bane is cut through
These creatures that are real, I'm becoming one tonight
Vulnerability is never concerning me again

Trail of the heretic
These eyes were meant to see, beyond the veil
