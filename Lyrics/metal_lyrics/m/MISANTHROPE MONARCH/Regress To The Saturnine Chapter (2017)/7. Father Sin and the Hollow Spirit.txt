Stumbling forward on his ways so arcane
Tripping with innocence, killing all my beliefs
Surrender so nerveless to hallowed authority
Feeble minds crawling up on my back
Occluding my very eyes with their filthy claws
Pretender so ruthless, as I try to behold

This misbelief I cannot accept in leading my fate
Discarding, cast them away

Never will I take a step back again on hollow ground
Profane reality the mundane aid that cures disease
Illuminate me with thy bright flame, gain me my sight

Blessing the irrelevant and impotent
Them sheeps are falling down
Scattered so careless into obscurity
Weakling, go and carve your own epitaph
Strolling on no man's path with your mendacious laws
Molester so helpless, as I try to behold

Misbelief I cannot accept in leading my fate
Never will I take a step back again on hollow ground
Gain me my sight
