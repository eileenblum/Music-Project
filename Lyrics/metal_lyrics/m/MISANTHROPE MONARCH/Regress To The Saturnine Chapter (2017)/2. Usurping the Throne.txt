Usurping the throne, lies are stepping up with languished limbs
The dormitory hides, it's arcanum, it's mysteries, not wasting away
Lines of wisdom which many accept, but few will comprehend
This suffering, this malady, the key to existence

I'm guarding treasury with blackened steel
Ascending the stairs through my persistence
As my sword acquires a blessing for its atrocities

Expelling unworthy faces into a purgatory smile
Where they're combusting, they're scorching, befouling no more
My sacred kingdom, which many aggress, but few will apprehend
This offering, divinity, the key to existence

Pristine redemption relieving from pitifulness
True devils and archfiends protect me, they are paving my way
As I walk on severed heads until I'm fading, never lose

This suffering, this malady, divinity, existence
