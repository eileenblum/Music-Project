I am lost in a circle of torment, never been up to the package
Faith is dead and corroded, horizons are blurring away
This devastating impact of my past, is lasting forever on
But I like my wounds to be open

Strife, discord and hate are ripping apart everything
I have ever built in my dreams,
Fate which is hollow, derogating magic will soon be dispelled

Consciousness demands the willing of a free mind
To relocate, separate, to sacrifice
But vanity's going to dun me, sleeping until the end
And beyond, those precasted ways give me nothing
How they dare to obstruct this process?

The living blindness, in mires of doubts I'm forsaken
Let it get washed away, away into oblivion, reunite with nothingness
Dispersing, I'm floating toward the dark
Embracing me, I am without passion
Cut their intangible chains, time to leave mirrors and urge
Crimson tides sweeping this countenance off from this earth

As we finally reaching the end, there's no need to be bitter
Derogating illusions have been dispelled
