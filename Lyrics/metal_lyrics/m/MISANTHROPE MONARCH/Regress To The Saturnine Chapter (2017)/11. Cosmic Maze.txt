Unaware, I wander to the edges of this mortal world
Distance, that I have never seen in all it's purity
Barriers devoted, across the bridge where only mist bounds
Anxiety, as my breath grows short with all it's sudden dread

My heart pounds in tense with a strange pulse inside
Summoning this new realm, with a galaxy to divide
Stepping through gates, gates that lead to wisdom
The cathedral of my mind, my mind

Remnants of civilizations, I'm passing by these shattered
bones
Like a madman with vile intentions
On his journey, aiming for the grave
Hands of a thief, with skills of a disciple
Blind, corrupted and cast into the mirror
Novitiate of the night

Finally a storm is coming, sweeping everything away
A fire leaving all in disarray

I witness the burial of flies
While everything, everything is covered
In silence and death
