A decade, has gone so fast, as memories passing by now
So timeless the offering, an offer you can't reject
This manifested coven, so closed, so broken

An aeon in full circle, killing skies, cosmic demise
The answers laying way too far, way too far

Deeper the path, exploring the darkness
Liberty through the omega embrace

With birthmarks, obscure and sinister
Have been made pure and visible
Prepare for the unknown
Wiping this slavery away as it's foreseen
This manifested coven, so closed, so broken

No acceptance, using them as a tool
Never adopting to this sickening ways to be
Been in charge, in charge of yourself
Washing all hardships away

Remaining strong within your spirit, the omega embrace
