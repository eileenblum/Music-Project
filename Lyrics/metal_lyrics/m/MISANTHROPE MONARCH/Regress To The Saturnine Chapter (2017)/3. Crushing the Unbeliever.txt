Sandblast thy face with the ash of your pretentious words
Do you like the taste of your lies?
Within, I can smell the disease that infested my mind
So weak, so numb, so blind, I can't see

Force fed, my heart still is alive and well, unhand the fright
This is a nightmare from which I wish to turn my gaze away
Running, dashing to pieces, this stronghold of pure mockery
Reset the clock

Shatter, the mace is wrecking your skull
Weakness, will be cast aside
Compassion is not an option, rigid I will unmake you
Crushing the unbeliever

Demoralized in between battles, already lost the trace
Laid down so elaborate, I try to grasp this ray of light
I must fight and embrace my animal instincts
Only initiative precipitates the ruin
Walking side by side with fear
This little death is wearing me down

Bearing the pain deep inside, the question how much can you stand
Before the boiling point is melting you down
Delivering this dead freight of love
Puking it in the face of the world
For sure I'll leave some scars to remind them
