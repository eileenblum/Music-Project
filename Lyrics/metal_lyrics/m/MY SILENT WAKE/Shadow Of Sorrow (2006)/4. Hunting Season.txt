Why run my friend?
There's nowhere left to hide
Why search the ruins?
There's nothing left to find
We live, we breathe
But we are numb to life
We grieve
The tears have dried in our eyes

And beauty - we pass it by
Purity - cast aside
We carry a crushing weight
Our fear, our lust and all our hate

Our fears and all our hate
Our fears and all the violence of all these years
The burden of all our fears
Where will it end
There's nowhere left to hide
There's nothing left to find

Such beauty we do not see
We pass it by
While we destroy each others lives
Still we kill, still we maim
We ruin, we blacken
We're still those children
The ones who mock and threaten
With our own rhyme and reason
This is our hunting season
