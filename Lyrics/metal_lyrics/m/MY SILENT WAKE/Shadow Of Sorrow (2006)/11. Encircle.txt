For years I was held in a suffocating grip
I closed my eyes, I bit my lip
I cried to you, too young, too weak to fly
Afraid to move, Would I suffer if I tried?

Does the sun still shine like in my dreams
Does it light up the outside of the walls that encircle me
Is it just an illusion the things I see
Through crumbling stone, light begins to bleed

As I become someone I do not recognise
Caressed by fear, afraid to open blinded eyes
Behind the walls the naÃ¯ve one so frightened
Cannot loosen the grip, it just keeps getting tightened

I know I saw the light begin to bleed

There's a world outside, it lies before me
A world on the outside of love and dreams
I wish to lead my life, I wish to walk the path of freedom
(But) if I hate, I'll never escape
The pain that imprisons me

With you I learned to live and breathe again
Learned to loosen the grip, then I broke the chains
As the ghosts of fears fade, I see in perfect clarity
Leave behind the ruins of the walls that imprisoned me

And the sun still shines like in my dreams
The world still turns, but not as once it seemed
My mind is clear, my eyes, my spirit see
As your broken hands are healing wounds in me
