I ran with you through greenest meadows
Entranced by you, (in) slow fading evening glow
You led me through where purest waters flowed
Remember you felt so safe in my arms
Long, long ago
So long ago
But now let me take you back
Through greenest meadows

I stand and stare at the distant hills
December sun falls on faraway fields
I'd do anything just to reach you again
To lie in your arms, for these wounds to heal

Let me take you back through greenest meadows
I want to see your eyes without tears tonight

Sunset streaks across the sky
Winter came, flowers died
Beautiful things, must they come to an end
So will tomorrow be the day our love dies

Walk with me my love
By flowing streams
Take my hand on the shores of the sea
Live again tonight with me

I stand and stare at the distant hills
December sun falls on faraway fields
Let me take you there again in my arms
For only as one are our dreams fulfilled

See me lying here
I cannot sleep
Can't sweep these cobwebs away
Solitary, with just a distant memory
These walls are closing in

I ran with you through greenest meadows
Entranced by you
We danced
So long ago, my love
But now let me take you back.
