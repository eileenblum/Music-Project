Have mercy on me as I plead for forgiveness
Observe with compassion, these tears of remorse
I awoke in a prison enshrouded in darkness
Out of my depth with my face to the floor

Please reach out
Rescue me
Take my hand
Do not forsake me
With blood cleanse me
As I yearn for salvation

Look upon the face of a man lost in sorrow
Who lives out his days with a burden of fear
But now as you lead, help me to follow
As a prisoner no more, for I am released

Have mercy on me
