As the last autumn leaves are falling
Blackened skies yield rain, has the sun disappeared?
Another winter descends like dying hope
Let me see through it all that you're still near

Oh Lord
Never let me lose hope

If I stumble in the shadow of sorrow
Will you lift me, will you carry me through the years?
If the weight of the world brings me down to my knees
Will I feel you dry my bitter tears?

Oh Lord
I need to see you through my tears
Never let me lose hope

Lead me through, lead me on
lead me over the gates to a new tomorrow

In the days of disillusionment
Frustration and discontent
In the hours of doubt and disbelief
Days of mourning and of grief

Oh Lord
On the edge of the depths of despair
Never let me lose hope

Hear my cries!
Desperate hands reach out to you
Washed in tears of pain
In these eyes, remain the shadows of yesterday
Will you steal them away?

Hear my cries
Desperate hands reach out to you
You who suffered pain
In my mind, I see the weight that fell on you
To bring me home again

Give me hope again
