Where is your hand oh my love
Lost in the mist I can't see
Paths where we walked are no more
And the light in your eyes has grown dim
Oh my love
Light in your eyes has grown dim

Once I could I could hear through the woods
Your voice as you called out my name
Finally fading away
Silence is all that remains
Now my love
Silence is all that remains

And that which I deemed without end
Draws to a close without time
Find for yourself a new dream
Though in our hearts we will grieve
For lost love
Though in our hearts we will grieve
