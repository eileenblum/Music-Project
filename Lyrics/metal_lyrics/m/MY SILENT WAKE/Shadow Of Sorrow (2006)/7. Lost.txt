I've been to the depths where they show you
The meaning of sorrow
I kept my life because I still needed tomorrow
There is always something remaining
In the back of my foolish mind
To keep me searching the pathway
For an answer that I left behind

Don't leave me behind

When you've taken all you can take
There's really nothing left
Of what you thought was living
Now it's so much worse than death
There's nothing left to offer
And now you're falling blind
Can't seem to find a way back
A feeling that you're lost this time

So take my hand
And walk with me
All is not lost

I've been to the depths, so don't tell me
I've never known sorrow
Still reeling from yesterday
Still bleeding tomorrow
But there's always something remaining
At the back of my foolish mind
To keep me searching the pathway
Till I stumble at the end of my time
