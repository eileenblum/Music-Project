Losing my mind
Black oil on blue sea
Lost little child
But nobody knew me
Carnival ride
Spinning alone in the darkness
Far from the crime
Yet still I would confess

Love me so deep
Then bury me deeper
Put me to sleep
Like arms of the reaper
I am your child
You are my keeper
I'm so afraid
Now you cannot be here

Mindless
Existence
Turned from flesh to stone
No resistance
Engraved with bitter loss
Burning bridges crossed
Future yet unknown
Crippling fear of dying alone

And as you clean my wings
You will see that the damage is already done
In my eyes, in my skin
See the sickness that can't be undone
Feel it seeping deeper within
To the heart of all I have become
As the journey begins
Through the valleys that banish the sun
