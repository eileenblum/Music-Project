Thieves of innocence
Cursed be your birth
The world forever blackened by you
Tell me please, where is your worth?
Cast your shadow
Upon the meek
You have power now
Inside you know that you are weak

Destroyers of innocence
Cursed be your birth
The world forever blackened by you
Tell me please, where is your worth?
Cast your shadow
Your foul disease
You manipulate
Insidiously preying upon the weak

Alone in your captivity
Now stripped of your authority
Inflicting no more your savagery
On the lives of those we try to protect

How can a man sink down to this?
Lower himself fully into the abyss
In your shadow
Twisted and bleak
Wake up and see
The destruction you wreak

Now the world
Has become a greyer place
With one more scar upon its face
You take what's good and in its place
Leave the lasting legacy of your disgrace

What have you done to the innocent children?
You selfish bastards, your deeds have ruined them
How can they ever be free from this?
Innocence gone, and childhood forever missed

Alone in your captivity
Bars of steel and bitter regret
Inflicting no more of your savagery
On the lives of those we try to protect
