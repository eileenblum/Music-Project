From the distant waters
Her siren's song came
Now their hell, then your heaven
As you whispered her name

This moment changes everything
Nothing will ever be the same again

And in your faces
Joy has drained from your eyes
The dream, the journey is over 
Can you rebuild the empty shell of your lives?

This fleeting moment in time

When you come to your senses
There is nothing left to look upon
Finality the bitter pill
And the clocks keep ticking on

Another midlife crisis
Trust slipping away
Does it seem worth the price now
In this cold light of day?

This moment changes everything
Nothing will ever be the same again
This night rearranges everything
No words to defend
And so it goes
And so it comes to an end

Fleeting moment in time.
