This love was dangerous
And now it destroys
Brings us down to our knees
Such foolishness our sorrow breeds
So tired of all the pain coiling up inside
Lead me here
This is where I hide

Dragging through all our failures
All our regrets
Yearning to feel the love and innocence
Lost to neglect

To any other wraith no longer I belong
What's loved is broken
Words can never be unspoken
So tired of all the pain coiling up inside
Leave me here
To rise again in my time

Entrenched in all my failure
All of my shame
I don't need you
I don't need anyone
To share the pain

Face another day
Face a new nightmare

Open your eyes
Once you're aware

Finding reasons
Finding truth
All you need right now is precious solitude

No fight goes on forevermore
You had the one you think you battle for

Perfect love let disappear
Was it ever real?
Can it ever reappear?

Now it destroys
