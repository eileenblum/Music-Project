Turn me around
The world spins above me
I'm falling down and the chaos enfolds me
Where are we now
And where are we going?
Lost to these dreams
Growing and growing

Time to move on
Time to retreat
Turn back the clock
Did we ever meet?

Turn back the clock

This is never going to work
Stand well back and look away
This is always going to hurt like nothing else
Watching all we built burning away

Lift the lid and look inside
Into the darkness we have found
All is given then denied
All our ships have run aground

Turn back the clock

This is never going to work
Stand well back and look away
This is always going to hurt like nothing else
Watching all we built burning away

Could this have been an illusion from the start?
We trusted in this and we ripped it apart
And I knew you once like the back of my hand
Separation so final
Never part of the plan
