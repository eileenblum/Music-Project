Purveyor of imperfection
Let the healer bring disease
Preacher of confusion
Thomas doubts to our beliefs

While a face from the past
With no warning recast
Brings the once beating heart to life
I want to be me and somebody else
Cut me in two in the darkness at night

Piss on the bonfire
Grease on the highwire
Why in the world did you have to come here?

You're a fly in the ointment
Let the healer bring disease
Imperfection
Doubts to our beliefs

To your fanatic I am your heretic
Empty handed now unknowing
As you labour with your burdens
Asking why you feel so alone
Question all you think is true
Never lose that part of you

A face from the past
Brings the once beating heart to life
I want to be me and somebody else
Cut me in two in the darkness at night

You're a fly in the ointment
Let the healer bring disease
