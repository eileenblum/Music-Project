I need to redeem myself
Need to release my tortured mind
You know this wasn't my choice
The words are mine in another man's voice

Darkness came down upon me
Sickness tore right through me
Pressure, the depth of that misery
Felt just like suffocation

You can look anywhere for answers
I looked for too many answers in you
This fool thought it lasted forever
Trying so hard not to witness the truth

Lost to supplication
Forever beyond the pale
Tribulation, sorrow and pain
Burning deep within my veins

All we have is ourselves now and we are alone
All we hear is the silence, the empty unknown
We kept turning the key but this wasn't our home
Looking up at the skies when the follows had flown

This is not me
This is not my voice
You look at me with tears in your eyes
Believe me now
This was not my choice
Wait long enough and everything dies

Love lost and found
And lost and found
Moving forward then turned around
Feeling alive then feeling alone in this garden of thorns and neglect
Gaining our strength and losing ground

I need to redeem myself
Need to release my mind from this
I will live on in hope of something better than this
Until I breathe my dying breath
