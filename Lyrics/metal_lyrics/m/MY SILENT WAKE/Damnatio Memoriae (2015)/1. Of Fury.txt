Then we crafted beauty
Our transcendent art
Until the hands of fury
Tore our work apart

We're the music playing
In a distant room
From another lifetime
Echoes of the tomb

They will come for you
Mindless destruction
Split your world in two
In the name of some god

Your genius unruly
You could turn the times around
Simple men of fury
Will bury you and your theories underground

Hear the children playing
In a distant room
Casualties of conflict
Damned within the womb

They will come for you
Mindless destruction
Split your world in two
In the name of some fool

For these destructive ways
There is no defense
Intolerance born of ignorance
So much damage done

Shattered bloody pieces
Lying on the ground
Bodies of the innocent
Scattered all around

All their futures lost to violence
Hatred so ingrained
In the end what has been gained?
For nothing will survive

Shattered bloody pieces
Littered on the ground
Bodies of the innocent
Scattered all around

They will come for you
Mindless destruction
Split your world in two
In the name of some god

They will come for you
Mindless destruction
Split your world in two
In the name of some tyrant
