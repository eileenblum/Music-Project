Cast out
Exiled
Burn each memory
All defiled

Erased us from time
A living death now asigned
Damnatio memoriae

Broken
Confined
Scared and paralysed
So reviled

Erased us from time
A living death now asigned
Damnatio memoriae

Living through death - everything melting away
Crying out crying out - everything falls away

Facing separation eternal
From days of suffering darkness
Nothing left but the end of life
Nothing left but the silence

I see no remorse
Erased from time
No sorrow, no shame
Curse us in our pain.

Reject
Decline
Forget the years
Hateful lines

Erased us from time
A living death now asigned
Damnatio memoriae

Living through death - everything melting away
Crying out crying out - everything falls away

But something has warped inside
A world of selfish excuses
And now compassion has bled and died
So goodbye so goodbye so goodbye.
Damnatio
Memoriae
