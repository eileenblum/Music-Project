With sorrow you row to a land sick with rot
That which has passed may not be undone
Yet guilt wars with love and coldly compels
To seek salvation through suffering

Your trials, your flaws
Made for you a shroud
You turn from the darkness
But running, it grows
Truth is a sword
To plunge in your heart
Or make battle with gods
Who won't hear your prayers

The hardest battle, fought in your mind
It's not your own end that you fear
The corpse-fog swells, within hides death
Even obscured you still know the path
Darkness speaks and you listen, why?
A voice screams "Turn back!", another cries "On!"
Your own mouth is silent
Save for wails and screams

Through fear you persist
Your blade, your redemption
Your shame, your armour
Your bleak killing flaw
Those gods lie defeated
Blood flows 'cross your skin
It nurtures the earth
Brings flowers of light

This land you now claim
Raw and absolved
In hell how you've suffered
You've strived and you've won
Yet still the weeds grow in
Your garden of remorse
Your pain was for nothing
Your bleak killing flaw
