As he lay on the verge of death
The house soaking in grief
A last request while blood flows in his veins
A valediction
Time enough before the beckoning grave

Who would deny a dying man's wish?

Too late to wake up to the fullness of this cruelty
Feel his desolation curse this callous fucking vanity
I see no way back, a closing door, so plead no more
And as he slips away, severed cords fall.

Who would deny a dying man's wish?
Who would decline this final wish?
Too late now this loss is eternal
No healing this agony ingrained.

Sorrow seeps,
Freezing cold beneath my skin.
Hope lies broken
Dead within

Your choice
No I won't be here
Wretched and scared
Your choice
No I won't be here
Broken frail
Your choice
No I won't be here
Denied, forsaken, rejected, blamed
Your choice
No I won't be here
Dead and gone
I am ashes
I am ashes
I am ashes

I cannot reach you.

Who would deny a dying man's wish?
An angel to all, innocent soul
