The fight is really over this time
They had to win the war
And showed us the depths of their cold indifference
Walls within walls
Impenetrable distances
Relinquishing the hopes of many years
So much foolish hope
So much regret
So much pain

Everything in black and white in their eyes
Everything in black and white is disguised

The colours and greys moving in and out of shadows in my world within
Walls within
And one day I understood
Some things can't be saved
Nothing will remain
Where nothing has been changed

Open your eyes

Even decay, even the broken things
Everything looks good in their black and white
You can't see the blood or the filth or polluted skies
You can't see the world like that this time
Outside the walls it's another crime
inside the heart it's another crime
There on the screen it's another crime
They've tainted our world
They've broken mine.

Everything in black and white is disguised
Nothing left in black and white in my eyes
