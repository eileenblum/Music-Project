Hands are held
Within your hands
Every breath a gift
Laughter rings within your walls
A room they fill may silent fall

My Sorrow is yours

Photographs adorn the walls
Where autumn sun
Long shadows cast
Memories of treasured times
Burning hearts lock tears inside

Hands were held
Within these hands
Every breath a gift
Laughter rang within these walls
A room they filled now Silent falls
