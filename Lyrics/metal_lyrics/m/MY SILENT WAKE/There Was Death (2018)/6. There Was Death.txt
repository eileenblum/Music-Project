In my death
All will die
We will be
Freed from time
Fraying ends
Of our lives
Fly as one
All in line

In an instant
Everything melts away
Universal and swift our decline
Ending all time

There was death
There was grief
Were you here
Did I leave?
Voices spoke
There was light
Without thought
Without sight

Braced myself and I watched you cry
Felt the outside rushing by
Where was the ending, when did we die?
Watching, waiting as we fly.

--End of--

--Nothing--

Beginnings, endings all in line
Something exists outside of our feeble minds
And so we were mistaken
Imprisoned in our time
Tied up in the boundaries
Of our symbols and signs

Of Science of religion
Chained to these confines.
