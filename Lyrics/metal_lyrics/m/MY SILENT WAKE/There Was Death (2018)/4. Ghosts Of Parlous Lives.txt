Ghosts of vanquished lives
Haunt your oppressers
You were spared nothing
To supply their greed
Ghosts of enslaved lives
They had their heaven
You who had nothing
Show them suffering

Helpless, you watched your children die
One by one
Each one damned from birth
You loved them all, your pride, your joy
No one knew their worth
Their children thrive and revel in riches
Gods who watched you fall
They have more than they will ever need
They will ask for more

Ghosts of parlous lives
Paupers and pilgrims
Broken and blinded
You have lost your way
Ghosts of erased lives
You have no headstone
To mark your passing
From a cursed life

Imprisoned for trying to survive
Taking enough to stay alive
From their stores of plenty
Caught in your misdeeds
Paid in blood for your crimes
Broken down before your time
Nothing of you remains behind.

You who worked so hard for pittance
You who had nothing to call your own
Helpless you watched your beloved suffer
You who begged before their thrones

Haunt them all in their filthy splendour
And bring them broken to their knees
Haunt them all in their filthy splendour
And bring them broken to their knees
Haunt them all in their filthy splendour
Observe them crawling at your feet.
