[Lyrics: K Hamilton. Music: K. Hamilton &amp; I Arkley]

Cast down your eyes to the shameful ground
The shattered Earth foretells a devastated land
Shelter from the rain that clouds the darkening sky
The ones who love their ignorance shall lead us all to die

We saw the falling of the Sun
The light has gone, the greatest deed has been done
The moon will rise, the dusk will veil my face
This is the end of the longest of days

We will fall,
We will rise
We will rise,
We will fall
Condemn the Earth,
The story of
Our own demise.
A fatal flaw

The new dawn appearing
Appalling and vivid
This cannot be the land of the living

For we have become the stories we told
Now we shall weep for the lives that we sold

Taking it all, the thieves of the mind
Denying, forgetting the souls left behind

Sweet tears of remorse fall and gather in vain
Bitter consummation with the ever vengeful rain

The inertia is growing, engulfing the sky
Betrayal of many unready to die

A voyage of honour, misplaced sanctity
The pilgrims have poisoned the world of the free

The civilisation that learned how to lie
Preparing to make the last sacrifice

Praying to wake, and waking to pray
This is the end of the longest of days

Tear down the walls and strengthen the Earth
After the winter the time of rebirth
Tear down the walls and strengthen the Earth
After the winter the time of rebirth
Tear down the walls and strengthen the Earth
After the winter the time of rebirth

Gone is the power in which we entrusted
Through lies and deception the good were corrupted

Herald the dawn of the longest of days
Farewell to the fortunate, laid in their graves

Tear down the walls then and strengthen the Earth
After the winter the time of rebirth
