The life you lived before is gone
Led beyond the pale by the cruel and distant Sun

Forever now beyond our reach
Your features frozen in a callous mimickry

Twilight sounds
Outstretched hands
Those you loved were the ones that watched you drown

The light that lit your eyes is gone
Turned to alabaster as your life had just begun

Stood alone in empty space
Eternal child with age now etched upon your face

Cursed to see you turned to stone and cursed to watch you fall
Cursed to see you take your place among the bright and beautiful

Twilight sounds
Outstretched hands
Those you loved were the ones that watched you drown

Those that survive bear the burden of blame
No mention be made of the forbidden name
Stand fast against the cruel winters rage
Wait for the dawn and the light of a wiser age

Et lux perpetua luceat eis
