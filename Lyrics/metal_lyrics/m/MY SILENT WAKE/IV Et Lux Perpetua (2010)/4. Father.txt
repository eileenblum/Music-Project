Losing ground 
Numbed and bound
Silent tears
Burn these eyes
Loved once, now despised

Wake
Face this day
As hope recedes
See this light
Fading in time

When do you
No long try in vain?
To reach out one more time
Opened doors
Closed again and again

You are always in my thoughts
Two summer children
Never forgotten
Shadows have fallen
On me

Walk away
One with pain
Within my room
All these words
Never heard

So far away you cannot know
My children
Never forsaken
Your light is fading
From me

You are always in my thoughts
Never forgotten
Never forsaken

Father bid farewell to your children
No longer there to watch over them
Hear their express their disdain for you
Too far away to explain
While someone else has taken your place

She is their keeper and their defence
Shielded as they are from your influence
Watch as they drift far away
Never again will you see them play
No one else can take their place

Sometimes living is all that is left
Some say another day us coming soon
So much time is lost
So much time.
