Another wasted night
Running from a falling star
Waking in the shadows
Wondering who and where you are
Longing for the morning 
Wishing you were far from here
In another lifetime
Where the lies and truth are clear

Onwards we travel 
Always moving forwards
Our damned curiosity
Self destructive vanity

Must we take this path again?
What knowledge will we gain?

I won't be alive
When the changes come around
How can we survive
Running to the siren's sound
No one lives to see
What becomes of all we knew
Another tragedy
Another rage is coming through

I am wandering far from here
In another time and another place
There is no one left but me
Set adrift  from the rest of the human race
I can see what I want to see
And become anything that I want to be
Drinking from poisoned streams 
Losing touch with self in a fraying reality

I see it all coming down
All journeys end.
