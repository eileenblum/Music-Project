Summer long gone
Autumn passed on
Winter
Took away the fading light

Now as I look upon the earth
I cannot grieve
As I wait for my rebirth
For my reprieve

Goodbye sweetness
Bitter regress
Darkness
Bleeding through my waking hour

Now as I look beyond the earth
I cannot grieve
As I wait for my rebirth 
For my reprieve

This empty grave
I lie still
My silent wake
Yet I breathe

Your will be done
I am no one
I run
Far away from their approach

Now as I look within the void
I cannot see
Must I wait for evermore
For my reprieve
