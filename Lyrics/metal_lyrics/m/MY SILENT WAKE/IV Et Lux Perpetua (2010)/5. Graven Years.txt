At times it seems nobody knows, nobody cares
The road I've walked, the weight I've borne

The blood I've given the blood I've shed
The graven years upon my face

When all that is sure turns to dust in my hands
I find myself in a place where no one stands

And there is no one here to find
No one to turn my heart to gold
No light to pierce my blinded sight
No hand to nourish this dying soul

I was wrong, was lost, was gripped by fear
had pain, had loss, had wounds to heal
You were there when I was consumed
To hold and love and whisper dear

Found here as a man laid bare
