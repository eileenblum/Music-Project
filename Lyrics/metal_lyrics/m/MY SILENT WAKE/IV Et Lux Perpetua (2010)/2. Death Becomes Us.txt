It's coming to us all
No matter where we run
Here and now is all we have
Let all be said, let all be done

Every second closer
I think I see the shadows approach

No one knows the hour
No one knows the day
In one moment
Death Becomes Us

We trim the branches
But still one thing holds true 
When the flood approaches
We are bound to the earth by the roots

All is loss and all is vanity
A chasing after winds

In shadows grasp at shallow sanity
Life ends as it begins

The whispers of our own humanity
Remind us of our sins
And our pride and in our vanity
We try to catch the winds

A quality of life
A true and loyal friend
A still and quiet mind
with which to face the end

No one knows the hour 
No one knows the day
In one moment
In one final breath
Death Becomes Us
