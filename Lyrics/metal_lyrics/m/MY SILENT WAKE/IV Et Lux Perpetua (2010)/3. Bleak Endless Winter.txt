Bleak endless winter
Curse this cold
Never ending night of misery

You are silent
Will you save me in the end?

Nobody can carry your burden
Bowed low in the grip of disease
Crestfallen, forsaken
Please take this bitter cup from me

Soul wasting sorrow
Broken again
I close my eyes, let it wash over me

Lost in darkness
Will you save us once again?

Futile listless cries
A slow demise
All is wasted

Stone cold faces
Look away
Far below them, slowly we creep

Sometimes this feels like there's nothing left
You failed the test is this punishment?
They twisted your words to condemn us
Was it ever the way they were meant

They fall silent 
As they turn
From the helpless, from the weak

As they turn from the weak
