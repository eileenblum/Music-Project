Encroaching and swamped
By decisions made resolute
Time sails swiftly on leaving its wake
Stolen are the fineries of life
In never ending menial tasks

Rushing between wake and sleep
And neither fulfilled

Service is not slavery
When done in love
What a weight love can carry
Through open eyes lust deprives
Lord where is strength
Where is salvation

See the work of calloused hands
Hear the weariness of breaking voice
Feel the ropes bend a faltering back.
