Clouds scatter across the sky
Aimless, wandering, like ancient lands
Never noticed, the years pass by...

Gathered on beaches, the old will recall
The pride of their fathers and their fathers' fall
Is it our fate to be held to account and be found wanting
By consciences yet unborn and unknowing?

For we relinquished so little and promised more
And our children will follow us in from the shore...
