Night falls swiftly upon this sullen earth
Nothing lasts
Tomorrow all is gone
Tomorrow all is one
Again
All around I see rebirth, decay
It cannot last
Tomorrow all is gone
Tomorrow all is one
Again

Nothing lasts
Tomorrow all is gone

Time passed us slowly long ago
Within the woods and fields we roamed
Our joyful voices carried far away
To echo around the trees and stones
And in the end return us home
The glow of summer evenings falling on our way
But childhood ends, the wars begin
We chase our dreams-we break, we mend
Then wonder what became of yesterday
We make decisions through our pain
And bow our heads to run through flames
As revolution finds us once again

We know we each must walk - as all must walk
We each must walk alone
And we all must stand, blindly with our outstretched hands
To face this world alone

Where is the life we longed for?
What happened to the dreams we dreamed together?
Where is the hope we longed for?
What happened to those dreams now lost forever?

All alone in mourning
Is there any more?
See the leaves are falling
Lost forevermore
As the fires are burning
Only ash remains
Today as always
Dust to dust again

Again

Take me away
Take me so far away
When I lie in the earth, I so loved to roam
As it takes to itself my broken form
I'm falling away
Falling so far away
As I sink ever deeper I cry to you
Lift me out of the depths of this sullen earth
