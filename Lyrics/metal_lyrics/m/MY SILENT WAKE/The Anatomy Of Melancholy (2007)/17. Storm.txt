Come now to me
From this hell you've seen
Lost to the sea
I have seen you grieve

Your tears have torn
Shot down in your wars
Weather the storm
I've lived through them all

They bleed they fall
So few hear my call
I am the door
I would gather all

Do you hear my call
I have lived through the storm
Shot down in all your wars
I have bled and given all
