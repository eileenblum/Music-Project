We see the sin before the saint
We see the curse before the blessing
We shake the little that remains
Until we are left with nothing

Look beyond the flesh, look beyond the mind

We see the freak before the person
We see the scars before the healing
We hear the lie before the reason
We crave the answer not it's meaning

We seek the judgement and not the understanding
We see the house and not the place we shared
We look past the story to the ending
We see the tears and not the soul you bared
