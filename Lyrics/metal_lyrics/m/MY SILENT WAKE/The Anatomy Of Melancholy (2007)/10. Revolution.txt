You hope one day to feel less of this confusion
To find that lasting peace is more than an illusion
But then you wake to face another revolution

And as the world keeps turning
You feel you're left behind

Is there another world beyond this cold existence
Can hope return to us despite our own resistance
I wish the light would come and filter through this distance

I hope one day to feel less of this confusion
To find that lasting peace is more than an illusion
But as I wake each day it is to revolution
