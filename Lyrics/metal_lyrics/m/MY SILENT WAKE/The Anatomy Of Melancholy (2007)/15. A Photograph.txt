On the mantelpiece stands a photograph
Soldier and his bride
One of many who had to leave
To march, to fight, to die

She will always remember you and the look in your eyes
One of many who had to leave

And they pushed you to the limit
Fighting man, a frightened child
And you saw her on the battlefield
The closing moments of your life

They will always remember you and the look in your eyes
One of many who had to leave

She is old now, she has lived long, and not a day goes by
Without a thought of you

An unspoken hope
To walk with you beyond the skies
