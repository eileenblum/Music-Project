Shadows will fall soon on all we have loved
Leaving forever

We are swept away
Lost on oceans of time
Seems like some other heart beating

When you look back on all we have lost
As tears fall

Are we just swept away
Children running from time
Seems like some other heart beating

Whatever happened to mine?
