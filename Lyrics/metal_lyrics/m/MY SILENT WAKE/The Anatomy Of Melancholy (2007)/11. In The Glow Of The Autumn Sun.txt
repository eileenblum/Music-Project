In the glow of the autumn sun
We walk again in fallen leaves
And as I draw you near
I hear the sound of the bells from faraway
Carried on the breeze
Bringing with it all this yearning
To be at peace again

In the chill of the winter wind
I walk again in solitude
And as I bow my head
I hear the echoes of things long passed away
Carried on the air
Bringing with them all this yearning
To be at peace again
