Dying from the fear of death
Could this be my final breath
Hold my head up to the light
Darker now my fading sight
Carried on the turning tide
Further ever from your side
I have felt the longing grow
All my deeds lie wasted now
I am longing to be free
I am calling out to thee
But your voice is gone from me
Now your voice has gone from me
