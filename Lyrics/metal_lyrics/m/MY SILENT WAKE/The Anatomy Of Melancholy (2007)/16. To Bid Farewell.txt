Too soon, you slipped away
Those doors opened once again
My friend I miss you so
But you left something here below

Today, through meadows of our minds
We remember your dear life
Goodbye - and though we weep
Painless now you sleep

Gathered here
Each to relay
The love, words fail
We all try in our way
To bid farewell
