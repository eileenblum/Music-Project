Did you get a glimpse of how it's meant to be?
As a child in a perfect world, lost within your dreams
And did you wake one day to find you've lost it all?
Take refuge in your memories

Time keeps moving on
Yesterday is lost forever
Those precious dreams forgone
It leaves you cold inside

Now the hour has passed from us
Into silence

So is this how life's supposed to be?
Do you remember now, how you used to feel?
And do you weep alone and grieve for passing years?
Take refuge, my friend, in your memories

Time keeps moving on
Yesterday is lost forever
Those precious dreams forgone
Still we yearn for something more

The prison of lifeless apathy
Creeping slowly, endless entropy
This burden-our mortality
All our fears, all our vanity
Rise above this numbing agony
While there's something left to feel
No refuge in my memories
Today, tomorrow is everything

Today we make a path to walk upon
Tomorrow to wake, and then to journey on

For the hour is now upon us
