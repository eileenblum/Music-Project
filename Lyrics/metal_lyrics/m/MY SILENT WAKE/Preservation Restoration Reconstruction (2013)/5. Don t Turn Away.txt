From the eyes that drew you in
From confessions of our sins

My love
Don't turn away

From the beauty of our song
From the days we knew no wrong

My love
Don't turn away

From the ties within our hearts
From the world we've torn apart

My love
Don't turn away

From the arms that long for you
From the pathways we walked through

My love
Don't turn away

From the tears of pain and love
From the wars we rose above

My love
Don't turn away

From the hands now quivering
From these unseen golden rings

My love
Don't turn away
