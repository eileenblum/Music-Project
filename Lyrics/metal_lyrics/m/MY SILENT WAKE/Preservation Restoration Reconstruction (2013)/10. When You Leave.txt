You can stay and never question why
You may be afraid of nothing
You may wonder what horizons hide
And become a slave to yearning

No one can go
Where you must go
Find your way home
When you leave

And who knows where these summers go?
How the winter comes so quickly
We can stay here as seasons ebb and flow
As we watch the endless flight of the free

No one can go
Where they must go
To find their way home
When they leave
