I wish for you the very best
As selfish love I lay to rest
The years which you have given me
Brought me strength and liberty

So go in love and peace now and in remembrance of our heaven

The skies grew black with clouds of rain
The nights so long with no refrain
Where once was light and beauty here
Our days were darkening in fear

I long for her and for our love
I long to see blue skies above
My eyes are dim and weakening
No refuge in this world of sin
