Down to my world came a shining star
Down in the deep where the darkness rolls

Where she illuminated night and day
She took my hand and I was born in flames

She came in storms that made the windows shake
Behind rain misted panes I'd look and wait
That night forever stays within my thoughts
Loved her from then until I breathe no more

And if this should be my last song to thee
Sing beside my grave
Shine your light on me

See the woods where we would walk in leaves
In our first autumn in the smoky air
Like a child I carved our names into a tree
It stands within those woods two lovers once walked free

And if this should be my last song to you
Walk beside my grave in the morning dew
Though my heart death has claimed
Let my words of love remain.
