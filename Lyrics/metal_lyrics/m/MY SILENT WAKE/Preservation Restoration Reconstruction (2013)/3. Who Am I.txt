In the words of many I'm your saviour
In the words of many I am lies
In the words of many I came down to Earth from the heavens
In the words of many I walked blind

If you see me
Who am I?
If you know me
Who am I?

Some may say that I deceived you when I promised life
Some may say that I left you here alone in the depth of night
Did I conquer the grave, can I save the lost?
Or forever a figure carved and broken on a cross
