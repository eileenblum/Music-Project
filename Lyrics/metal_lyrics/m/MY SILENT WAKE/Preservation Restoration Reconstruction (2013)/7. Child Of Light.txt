Many times you've laughed with me
Your smile stays with me
Lights the darkness that found me
In this emptiness
Til I walk with you again
Time is slow to heal this pain
Light is dimmer than before
Even though I'm seeing more
Beacons shine throughout the night
Even for you child of light
A passage to another shore
Distant friend and open door
Yours forevermore
