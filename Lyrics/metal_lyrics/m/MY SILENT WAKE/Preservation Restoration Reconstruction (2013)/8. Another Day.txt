My summer child
I remember you
Running through the leaves
And hiding behind trees
Now you wonder what is true
Don't you remember good things too?
Another day slips away

In these times of separate lives

Mine is still calling out to you
Is there nothing I could do?
Such a trial you've been through (my child)
So many paths
You will journey on
One day come find me
Upon this distant shore

I know you wonder what is true
And you remember good things too
Another day drifts away
