See the shadows you leave behind
As your final share of time
Draws nearer
Who is standing by your side
Grieving as you cling to life
Growing weaker

So all these years come and pass us by
Fallen leaves that feed the earth
From which another tree grows
From seeds we have sown
And none of us knows when the cycle will end

See the light you leave behind
As your final share of time
Draws nearer
see their faces by your side
They bid farewell to a precious life
Growing weaker

So all these years come and pass us by
Fallen dead leaves feed the earth
From which no other trees grow
though seeds have been sown
The living must know now
The cycle has ended

But what have we sown?
