From the open fields they beckon us
Tunnels
As the rains fall down they cover us

I knew my time had come to run where I had never run
Without the warmth of the sun
Circle of light to lead me on

And the light at the end never gets any nearer
Alone in a dream where you know it's too late

How can I ever feel the sun again?
Never ending the walls of fear and decay
Far behind I can still hear the rain
Circle of light still draws me away

I think I'm lost forever within this cursed place
Damned to search in darkness for the light I can't embrace
Haunted by the silence of the words I never spoke
Forced to face the violence of the madness we invoke

Is this real...is this just a dream?

Open fields - I remember you
Blue skies - I still yearn for you
One light shines within these walls
I walk where the circle falls

Are you real.....Are you just a dream?
