Crimson drops on the scarred white sand,
Blood spilled in an unknown land.
Contours of hills
In the distance like bone
Shrouded in mist they remind me of home.

The singer forgiven for you loved his song,
Choking on words that froze on your tongue.
The waves rush in,
As my footsteps fall,
Flightless I leap, silent I fall.

So many tears,
Cried at night.
Distort the past,
Deny my sight.

Dissolution of envy.
Vanity was always on your side.
Blinded by the giving sun,
I close my eyes and see what I've become.

Unspoken words can never lie,
But in your eyes the fascination fades.
Hold my gaze and look away,
The changing stars that lead me astray.

So many tears
Fill my dreams
Follow the tide
Defy the sea (Defy my dreams)

Flightless I leap.
Silent I fall.
Falling from grace,
I can wait no more.
