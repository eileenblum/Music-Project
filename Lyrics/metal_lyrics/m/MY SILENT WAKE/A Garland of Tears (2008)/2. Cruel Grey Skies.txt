Cruel grey skies - Run for cover
In her eyes see her lover
Fear the falling rain as you shelter
Your world drowned, lost forevermore

Reaping a harvest of ruin
Nothing remains
Leave it behind as your ships sail away

He has reaped where he did not sow
And keeps what he did not own
In her arms he lies, where you used to be
Her chains broken - merciful release

Nothing remains
Searching for yesterdays dream
Reaping in vain

Long ago you were standing there
No-one knows, no-one can prepare
He beholds your world, now your eyes are blind
You let it slip away, now you're left behind

Let your ships sail away
Leave behind all your tears
All your hate
All this desolation
Drift upon open seas
Distant shores rise for thee
For you, for your salvation.
