Feel the fear
Grow sharp as silver under midnight
Your time is here
The will to fight begins to disappear

Bright lights linger on a distant shore
A flickering spectre of a temporal semaphore

Forge the years
Martyr to the world I though I'd lost
Cold wind blows through me
Forlorn the birds fly home

Creator of worlds
Legacy of broken dreams
Destroyer of worlds
Driven by egregious fantasy

Master of my own horizons
Come within my reach once again
Master of my fate
Come within my reach

Not another soul to be seen
No one needs to see how the slate is wiped clean
I am overwhelmed by this raging sea
I long to disappear in a grey eternity

Feel the fear
Forge the years
My will to fight begins to disappear
