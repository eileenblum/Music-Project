You take the form of all our fears
Broken minds for twilight years
No return and no remorse
Imprisoned in the here and now

We fight the wars we used to play
Kill and destroy for those we obey
One man decides another's fate
Don't hope for change, we know it's too late

More bloodshed
More destruction

Turn the page and nothing's changed
New leaders, new conflicts
Death all the same

We show our children how to hate
Never learn from all our mistakes
Look at the wasted world we made
Look at the bloodshed, the sorrow, the graves
