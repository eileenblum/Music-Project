Rising and falling
From cradle to grave
And all of our precious, fleeting time
Is slipping away

Millions of pitiful fading lives
Running in vain from the shadows of death

Our worlds formed and faded
Like the words of the dead
Another generation sliding into oblivion
To the darkness ahead

Look upon the corpse, your captor
Taunting silently of our demise
Leaving all behind forevermore
Even yourself, even your mind

Why can't we live again?
All these riches lost to time
Skills and knowledge lie buried, forsaken
With all those lives

Millions of beautiful fading minds
Searching in hope through the shadows of death
Falling blind into the shadows of death
