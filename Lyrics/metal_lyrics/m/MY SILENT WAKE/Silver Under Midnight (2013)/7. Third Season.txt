These beautiful mornings
Dreams turn the key
Light on our world dawning
Wake, awaken me

Soon they would come calling
Capture the free
When they bring the storms in
Come away with me

After all these years
Still the blessed one
From the battles lost
So much has begun

This is our season
When the leaves fall
Early twilight
Keep me in your warmth

Here within your arms

This is our season
When the leaves fall
Early twilight
Keep me in your warmth

No more tears may fall
From these weary eyes
Still I see the sun
And my spirits rise

In the autumn air

As we fall to the winter
Keep me here by your side
Far away from tears and mourning
From the world where they reside

When we wander through the wasteland
Through the darkness, through the night
In the spring life will awaken
Warmth of summer comes in sight

From cruel skies
She was my shelter
Cold in my grave
In darkness I beheld her
From dying light
New paths discovered
Lives intertwined
Two exalted lovers

Cold in my grave
Broken I held her
