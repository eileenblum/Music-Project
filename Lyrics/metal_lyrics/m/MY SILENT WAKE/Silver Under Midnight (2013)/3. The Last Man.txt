Tomorrow as he wakes to find he is the last man
All that went before has no meaning anymore

Nothing left behind for the last man
Living out this remnant of time in solitude

And he will seek the end - final days for the last man
Too much weight to bear
No one left to share this dying sky

Everything left to decay
Everything just a memory
For no-one ever to recall
