I feel it twisted
The blade within my flesh
Silent words are spoken
In the stillness of death

These dying eyes
will turn away
From this torment
From this slaughter
From my killer

You can have your share
But mine as well?
Life is fleeting now
Only time will tell

This illumination
Burns hell from my eyes
My vindication
A thorn in your side
And as the blade keeps twisting
I feel no pain
Frozen still as the world keeps turning
Dust to dust once again

I'm far away
I'm lost to you
Devoid of fear
