Today the ghosts of all my days long gone
Came right back
Taunting, haunting me
Showing that there's nothing in this Godforsaken place
Left to understand or hold on to anymore
My love what's it for?

I've taken stock, I've questioned everything
But nothing lasts
That much is clear
Even to the fools
I wish for change but seek the comfort that was once the antidote
To all my fears it's all come and gone.

When we were young nothing seemed to hold us back
We thought we could be free
That life went on forevermore
Significant endeavours
Let on by grand designs
Unending time
Was yours and mine.

It seemed so perfect at those times
And nothing could have been more complete
It fell apart
It lay there dying at our feet

I look around and see the past destroying parts of me
Like breaking waves upon eroding shores
Im pressing on
But looking back
I have so much but always search in vain for more
I wanted it all.
