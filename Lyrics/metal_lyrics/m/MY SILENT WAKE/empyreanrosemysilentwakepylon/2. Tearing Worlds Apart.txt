[performed by My Silent Wake]And who knows what will be in the end?
Who knows where we'll be?
And who knows what we'll see in the end?
Who knows who we'll be?

Do you want to face me still
Search a ruined heart
The process has begun
Tearing worlds apart
I cannot save you from this
I have no words to say
My mind is frozen too
Will you meet my eyes again
See me as I am

All these worlds torn apart
Tearing our lives apart

Do you want to burn it down
Just to feel the fire again
Is it final for us now
Fading dreams, the call of something new
It hits you once again
While we lose our way
Stripped of every disguise
Will you meet my eyes again
See me as I am

All the walls we made drag them down
Every foolish word forgotten

All these worlds
All these years
Every one of us
Live with tainted memories

All these years
All these worlds
