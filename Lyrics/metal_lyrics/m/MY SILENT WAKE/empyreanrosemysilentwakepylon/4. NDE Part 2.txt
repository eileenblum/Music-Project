[performed by My Silent Wake]Time to say goodbye
To all you ever knew
Time to see yourself
See where you walked through

See the light shine down
Kaleidoscopic walls
Distant glow ahead
Into the golden halls

No more sorrow here
Bright celestial guide
Flowing warmth and beauty
Leading me inside

Gathered in this place
You can see them all
Once you knew them well
Lost familiar forms

Taken far from pain and sorrow
A glow that lights my way
Searching through the days I follow
A patchwork past replayed
Once forgotten dreams
All the years of pain
Just a memory
Lost on endless plains

For you, was I good enough?
In my time
In my way

We're all searching
Something so unknown
Our questions
Never ending drone
Am I dreaming?
I recoil
Look back down
See them all
Loved ones gathered round
Healers gathered round
See my former self

See my body broken
Broken frame
Mind bereft
Of thought or reason

Fading now
Falling down
I can't remain here any more
This urge to linger on
This place is now where I belong

See my body broken
Broken frame
Mind bereft
Of thought or reason

Nothing can compare to this
In the suffering world
Never knew such a state of bliss
In the world of sorrow I used to know

See my body broken
Broken frame
Mind bereft
Of thought or reason

Nothing can compare to this
In the suffering world
Never knew such a state of bliss
In the world of sorrow I used to know

Entering in and looking back on it all now
The sadness of the world these shoulders bear no more
Is this just the way dying feels for some?
Chemical reactions
A final urge to go on
I fell back again and go on living here
To walk a path no longer ruled by fear
Leaving this room in which I saw so much
Nothing is certain now but truth and love.
