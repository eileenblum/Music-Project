Let us cross our hands and mix our bloods
For the black messiah has spoken
Let us prepare the arrival of the overlord
Ruler of the new kingdom about to come

The overlord, the prince of darkness
He is the one who can see all
Fear his anger and speak his world

Demon supreme

The overlord, the prince of darkness

Goated-headed and dressed of a black cape
Smarter than human, stronger than beast
No one imagine the power be owns
Destinated to burn the weackest soul

Demon supreme

The overlord, the prince of darkness

Blind are the ones who ignore
His strenght supreme, his magical force
Cursed will be the unfaithfull
Those who still follow an important god
[bis]

The overlord, the master
The demon supreme
The guardian of sin
The overlord

Blind are the ones who ignore

[Repeat first verse]
