Blessed is the embrace of hermes Trismegiste
The ogerie of power through knowledge.

Mystic mysteries have not resisted my assaults
Soon, the atavism of the untiring will flow through my veins.

Only the devil is missing to my realisation.

And I lauch my call beyond the well of the seven seals,
Beyond the moor where the double headed worms reigns.

Earth dust of oblivion
Water gathering place of tears
Air gates toward the invisible world
Fire incarnation of Nemesis

"I heard your call and I crossed the stream of fire"

Now, my power is satisfied momentarily
Knowledge offers me an opportunity of domination.
