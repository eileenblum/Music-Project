Visions, O' visions of nightfall internal.
I dream the dreams of redemption, a reflection of what I am, and what I 
could have been.
I gaze within that frame;  I look upon eyes, hands and body.
They capture the light and darkness, they shape all eternity.
Of passions in shadows burning, like leaves upon embers glowing...
I am the dark night of Nirius...in the eyes of the Jaded Serpent.
I seek a journey unto temptation within that scarlet pane, deep inside its 
belows.
Before the ivory candle wanes.
Well within its depths I wade, by loving hands in velvet dreams.
In her eyes of lupine tears, like oceans without shores...
