Be attentive --- for you may be allured by its presence, by its charm.
Deep in the cosmos, upon this throne of void and star.
Each word spoken, invocating.
Each syllable, a rune.
For every emotion shall be accountable, like the sands of time long since 
fallen.
A singe upon pale flesh.  To form the darkness growing inside the heart,
Inside the mind, like the fall of a thousand gods.
Solinari
