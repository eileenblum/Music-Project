i feel a blacksun
cast upon my withered brow
the dancing of embers
peace of eternal flight

the deepest of blue
in crimson night
shadows my russet skin
in views beyond a winter gate

vivid days of a child
green are the trees of age
my love for the everlasting sky
foreboding flames abode 

i will dream under a blacksun
no shelter to hide my skin
tainted rain will taste so pure
like black painted earth 

i can see beyond my time
cast my disgrace on fall
foretell my name in honor
under a black dawning sun
