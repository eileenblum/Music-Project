for it is, thus that i
wallow within my own despair
drowning hearts outside my lust
creep around wallowed pairs
waves of gray, trees of dust
following paths, without trust 

can you hear within your soul
will you cry for me
an unbridled view, far beyond
shielded from dawning skies... 

you play among the deadened groves
cannot see nor care to show 

many faces carved in false belief
shallow mouths speak your grief
winds carry our unmatching thoughts
in ashen tears, thus i cry
into a world i have never known
