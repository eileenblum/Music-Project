behold, i am your deliverance. look upon this nether steel: tearing away your soul, relentless. i am the dark night you fear.
seek your ruin before me, upon this earth your blood shall stain. a reckoning beyond all reason, hear the cries of your brethren,
lament. a thousand score i did fell. no spear did render, or axe did cut. your women shall carry my seed; forsake your children
to the wheel. upon the frost shadowed earth, lay the keep i shall homage. within i shall bury my riches, to count for centuries
here after. waiting and watching...watching and waiting. even after the last morrow i shall ponder, in a madness of my own
design. after this body is time, worn to dust, the nether blade is still mine forever.
