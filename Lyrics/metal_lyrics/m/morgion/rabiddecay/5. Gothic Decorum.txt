gothic decorum, a new age
as nature's cycle slowly ends
blackened earth and chemical rain
desecrate the land with plague

a morbid land and signs to show descrupted faith
destruction, death and decadence perverted reality
sections of life, terminal and fested with disease
mother nature's control, incest of purest fidelity 

rabid decay

living creature of once man's origin
bless with the mark of the plagued
consistency to roam a baron life
structured plane for the master
morgion 

life again
