a future world
where life's a blessed gift
industrial obsession
disease is the material grown 

life is something not to molest
oppressed screams of a cancered fetus
birth is pain blistering inside
reproduction is a final regret

there's a question to be answered
destined choice to condemn
in the process future impressions
death's evation to the end

ignorance to this day
will destroy all hope, life betrayed
fear an easy way out
regret your sins, end all hope
