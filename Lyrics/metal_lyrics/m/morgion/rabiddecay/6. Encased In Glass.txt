suspended for all time
to die would be too kind
the end will never come
it can't be done 

dormant sleeping state
find no way to escape
animate in a coma of glass
years go too fast
my soul unites with the world
eternity's story untold

no site i can't see
hate to freedom lies in me
coffin of ice, stone cold
cage of glass i mold 

encased in glass, perpetual to my blood
the glass takes possession of my soul
to feel a dream is only to me
my prison encased in glass
