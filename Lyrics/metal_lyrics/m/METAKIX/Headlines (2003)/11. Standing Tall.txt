This is to all my friends
Whom I can't defend
But I got a helping hand to lend

If someone puts you down
Reach out for his crown
Just take him to the ground

Keeping it all within
Is a dreadful sin
Just show them where you've been

As far as I recall
Someone heard my call
And now I stand tall

This could be your fate
Just control your hate
And it's time to liberate

The path may seems too long
The meaning of this song
Is to right that's all wrong
