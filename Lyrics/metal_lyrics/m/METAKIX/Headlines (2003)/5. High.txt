There in the wilderness, nothing seems to be
Life's been such a mess, ever since I met me
Only darkness in my dreams, an unknown entity
A whisper is like a scream, a hoax a reality

Am I me, Am I myself, Am I I
Am I me, Am I myself, Yes I'm High

Get away from truth, it's a passion
Hate and Love in black sessions
Days of the past I must confront
I get dazed so fast...a force to Reckon

My head rattles to the beat, cos I feel the spin in me
Well it surely is a treat, you do it or you flee!!
Oh I ascend from the ground and I think I'll touch the sky
But this voice keeps coming around,
It says...I'll soon pass by!!!

Am I me, Am I myself, Am I I
Am I me, Am I myself, Yes I'm High
