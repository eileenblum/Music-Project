Everybody let's hold hands
And move on to the promised land
When we reach the Preacher's tent
Tell me all this was a stupid accident

One by one our minds are scanned
Lying, for us is strictly banned
Just then I deliver those promising lies
Soon I'm left to be idolized

Try to keep a lock on my tongue
Still keep lying like the ones I'm among
My medications, they're supposed to help
Yeah, they aid me through the lies I must tell

Then comes the 31st of December
Something I can remember
It's the day I make all those promises
That I break in the coming year
