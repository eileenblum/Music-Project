Moments and Smiles
The empty room prepares for the play
Consuming Malice
I stay strapped to the wires

Injecting Belief
Mindless and thoughtless
You'd like me to be
Push the levels
And ensure I enact

My shuddering spine
Electric questions asked
till the answers I bleed
Repeat the process
Double-check for denials

Now everything is so pleasant
Right from my jaw-bone to my dying day
...my dying day
Falling of the Autumn Leaf
Doesn't seem to make much sense
To my foolish brain
...the one they turned insane
Nature has it's own way of subtle comparisons
Can you tell me...What is reality??
In reality?
