At first just a stimulus
Now a growing impulse
She's in my domain
feels like she wants to remain
Her enticing...for my collapsing
She's winning as she flows through me

The Shaman's arrived
His feather crown quivers in the wind
He says a word of advice to you
"Need to let her come on out!"

She's The Incubus
And what I feel is such
I'm one with her realm
The shine of her gem

I said, "The speed has just begun...
And I'm not yet done."
He said, " She'll kill you my son...
Gonna be too late till your done!"
The Indian wants me to bleed
Says it will wash away her deeds
I place the blade in the fire
Cause he said it's a real purifier

She's The Incubus
And what I feel is such
I'm one with her realm
The shine of her gem

Use the knife my son
Carved a Z on my arm
She's flowing out of me
Not glad to have...set her free!
The healer tears off his stained scarf
Melts platinum in the flame
Pours it on to my scar
But she'll, still... possess me!!

He's got her in chains
Says, "You won't see her again."
Told her I liked the onslaught
The things that she was about
As they fade into oblivion
What a scenario
Things repeated themselves...
But this time I was on the 'watching' end!!

She's The Incubus
But what I feel is such
I'm one with her realm
The shine of her gem
