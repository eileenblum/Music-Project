Spaced out of society
Discrimination takes its toll
Sinister it shall always be
Tattering my soul

Who do they think they are
To tell me what to do
Pulling the plug on me
Then they blame my attitude

Accusation, Domination, Termination
Face what they are doing
Manipulation, Strangulation, Confrontation
A suspended state of being

To be or not to be
A question in my mind
They'll drain your sanity
They're many of a kind

Who do they think they are
To tell me what to do
Pulling the plug on me
Then they blame my attitude

Accusation, Domination, Termination
Face what they are doing
Manipulation, Strangulation, Confrontation
A suspended state of being
