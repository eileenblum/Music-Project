All I see in your eyes
Is this hatred for me
And I don't know just why
You can just let me be

No I never even tried to forget you
And you never even tried to forgive me
Oh don't let me go so far away
Taking me low though I wanna stay

Now I lie helplessly
Can't slip out of your grasp
Thought you were an Angel to me
Now I see Death behind your mask

No I never even tried to suppress you
And you never even tried to caress me
Oh don't take me away to the other side
With my life you only play,
then you say, "It's SUICIDE!"

Will you punish me
For the sins I've never done
Can't I be free for the time that's to come
Showing no mercy you will follow the myth
Unknowingly...A fire you have lit!
