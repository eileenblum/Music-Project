Treason out to reason
with the self-righteousness of man
Twisting into phrases no one understands

A High-priest, endless deceit
for the countless confused minds
If the spell is countered
Wastelands they will find

Search and Seek the wise
No Distrust, No Sacrifice
13 in all, they'll...draw the light!

Fields of Hope
Draped sunshine
The end was on time!
