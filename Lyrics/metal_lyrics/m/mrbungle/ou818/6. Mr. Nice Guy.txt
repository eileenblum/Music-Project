There's nothin' that I wouldn't do for you 
Cuz I'm pottie trained like a great dane 
Have a nice day 
Incubus in disguise, lord of the flies 
A pile of shit dressed up to appetize 
The main course - degradation a la mode 
You accept the invitation 
I know how to treat a lady 

I'm a fountain of love, like Christ 
So shower in the golden jewelry of my balls 
Eagerly you suck it down like a pig in a toilet 
In a vacuum in a tornado in a black hole 

Turbulent ... Whirlpool 

Like yin and yen, the doggie is my best friend 
I think I need a foxy terrier 
With a capital T, that rhymes with D 
That stands for derriere 
To bark for me and keep me company 

You look so nice 
With your nose in the dirt 
You're my puppy 
Bend over and lick yourself 

And when you sleep I'm sitting on your chest 
Say it's a dog's life so you do what you gotta doo doo 
Doggie bitch, let me drill my own hole 
I don't need a seed to grow my dickweed 
I'm the one you want, the one you get 
Shit sucking butt fucking nerd 

I'm a sadist, I'm a geek, I'm a coprophagist 
I shit, you eat my poop, you shit, I eat your poop 
I shit - an infinite push-pull 
Hedonism trading fours 
You scratch my back I'll scratch yours 

Incubus ... Suck your butts 

Like Dick and Jane, the K-9 method is fucking insane 
It's love, it's dog eat dog eat dog 
With a capital D, that rhymes with tree 
That stands for pee pee 
Your knight in shining armor 
Ain't no nice guy at all 

I am the devil who's under the skin 
I hide in the smile and aim for the quim 
God is my tactic and nature's my game 
Forget all your opinions baby 
Because I will always win ... Lesbian 

O-U-8-1-8 

The ritual 
I urinate chivalry 
Instinctual 
Cuz I'm such a gentleman 
You look so nice 
With your nose in the dirt
