When life comes down to a sharp pointOnto the head of a pinSomething relieves the pressureAnd the cycle beginsAll the ladies run to the barstoolsAnticipation growsMother nature adds the ingredientsThe women sip it slow One day God had to get off his assHe had to walk to the kitchen and get his own glassTo this glass he had to pour his own boozeFor this, his woman had to pay the duesNow all women must pay this terrible billThat arrives every month against their willA crescent hang over, half-irritated smirkFull migraine cramps, and Maxi-pads don't work! Have another round nowComplete the recipeAll your pain and angerWash into a crimson seaHe who filled your oceanSinks not but bobs afloatYour sweet menstruation Will capsize his boat Don't you think it's scaryLife's a Bloody MaryBlood and alcoholMakes you think that nothing's wrongHowling at the moonWhen the wolf bane bloomsRaise your glass and toastTo the thing that hurts you mostDrink hard drink deep! When life comes down to a sharp pointOnto the head of a pinSomething relieves the pressureAnd the cycle beginsAll the ladies run to the barstoolsAnticipation growsMother nature adds the ingredientsThe women sip it slow Concentrated into a liquid stateReleased out of a spigot, the tampon awaitsFlowing out of the nozzle and into your cupAlthough you've had too much, it's bottoms upEvery woman's got a secret with Mother SunSaying we'll meet same time same place next monthWe'll drink till dawn and we'll reminisceAnd we'll bleed for each other with no remiss Have another round nowComplete the recipeAll your pain and angerWash into a crimson seaHe who filled your oceanSinks not but bobs afloatYour sweet menstruation Will capsize his boat Don't you think it's scaryLife's a Bloody MaryBlood and alcoholMakes you think that nothing's wrongHowling at the moonWhen the wolf bane bloomsRaise your glass and toastTo the thing that hurts you mostDrink hard drink deep! Excuse me bartender, fill it to the rimAnd fetch me a sanitary napkinTo wipe off what's dribblin' down my chinAnd forget about the troubles of this month's sinEvery girl washes out the month's bad timesBy flushing her cares out into her panty linersTabasco sauce stings the memoriesNo release Dreadfully eternalThe stain of tomato juiceNever understand whyYour crotch is singin' the bluesStirring up emotionWith a celery stickSickening combinationYour blender loves to mix
