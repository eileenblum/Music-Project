Old age wisdom and the world grown baldBut you're still amazed by every little hair that fallsAnd I wonder if repetition makes one forgetCuz I'm under the impression that you're fraudulentYou're not really old Tantrums reveal that rich experienceAnd those naked gums - the loss of all your confidenceThen you serve a dish I try hard to avoidAnd it's backwards, my learnation is going to be destroyed Finding worth in the worthlessTime spent learning to regress I listen, try to care, say "mm-hmm" here and thereBut there's something else insideI try to be polite, make you feel all rightI can be anything you likeI'll be a virgin forever Cataracts - everyone's the same old blurAnd those stale snacks make me feel and feign inferiorBut I'll make believe, trying to cooperateAnd I hope you don't see me hide it underneath my plate I'll get a backache and stumble over both left feetAwake nervous knowing that we'll meetMust I tolerate this useless game we dance and sing?Cuz I don't relate, and I'm not learning anything at all Force a circle into a square danceInsist the future try and relive the past I listen, try to care, say "mm-hmm" here and thereBut there's something else insideI try to be polite, make you feel all rightI can be anything you likeI'll be a virgin forever I don't wanna dance, na na na...
