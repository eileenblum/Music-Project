Drowning in your eyes, the brown pools overflowImmobilize and hypnotize, gimme the chills from belowI'm talkin' to myself, thinking that you are hereI turn around, into the black your shadow disappears Blood freezes in my veins with your frigid touchMy vital signs are vanished by your gravity into mushYou're so beautiful you scare me to deathMy hair stands on end with the warmth of your breath If I look at myself in the mirror I see a part of youUnfolding mysteryYour magnetism pulls me closer and out of the blue You give me the goosebumpsYou send shivers up and down my spineYou give me the goosebumpsYou make me quiver and stumble my mindYou give me the goosebumpsMy knees weaken when I look in your eyesYou give me the goosebumpsFor my love I can find no disguise Beneath the light of the moon I soothe your neck with a kissI feel the sting of your blood trickle onto my lipsYou're so delicious I taste your poison juice on my tongueInfinity is killing me and you where we belong Passion's grip around your throat, strangling in a cartoonYou ooze between my fingers gasping for your last daily woundI watch you suffocate my pulse accelerates to a blurA tear falls from my eyes love chokes in a slur If I look at myself in the mirror I see a part of youUnfolding mysteryYour magnetism pulls me closer and closer... You give me the goosebumpsYou send shivers up and down my spineYou give me the goosebumpsYou make me quiver and stumble my mindYou give me the goosebumpsMy knees weaken when I look in your eyesYou give me the goosebumpsFor my love I can find no disguise
