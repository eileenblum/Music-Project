Ideas from the bottom of the ocean
Refracted by the different densities
Mr. Fisherman don't catch a full load
He just keeps floating on the surface endlessly

These morals are lines
Drawn around this shape of mine
Enclosed in the perfect design
Into this ethics mold confined
Define sense

One man's sin is another man's goal
One man's bowels is another man's soul
One man's god is another man's slave
One man's god is another man's slave

One man's cartoon is another man's creed
One man's jelly is another man's dickweed (what?)
One man's flirt is another man's rape
Two definitions for the same shape!

Assumptions from an invalid standpoint
Trying to prove an argument formed amoronically
One place you won't find me Mr. Logic
Is in your dictionary

These morals are lines
Drawn around this shape of mine
Enclosed in the perfect design
Into this ethics mold confined
Define sense

One man's sin is another man's goal
One man's bowels is another man's soul
One man's room is another man's grave
One man's god is another man's slave

One man's cartoon is another man's creed
One man's jelly is another man's dickweed (what?)
One man's flirt is another man's rape
Two definitions for the same shape!
