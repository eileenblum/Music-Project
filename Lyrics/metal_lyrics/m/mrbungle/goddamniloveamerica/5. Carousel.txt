A carnival for the human raceCotton candy, happy faceA child talking with his mouth fullGirlfriend gets stuffed animal A festive mood is all aroundAnother world is what we've foundStep right up, let's make a dealLet's ride on the ferris wheel You know there's something lurking underneath the shapeWith a mask over it's head and makeup on his faceInto the house of mirrors goes a clown and his elfTake a look in the mirror and see the clown in yourself SpinningGrinningBelievingDeceivingWhirlingTwirlingConfusingAmusingDiscoveryRecoveryInherencyTransparencyFusionConclusionRealityFatality If you want to know what's behind the showYou ride my carousel and enter life's jail cellLove and blood begin to meld, you've lost the self that you once heldMerry go round your head - awake, asleep, alive, or dead. The clown that painted a smile on youIs now the one unmasking youAnimated scenes unwindDormant figures come to life Entangled in your own webA twisted tunnel overheadA glimpse of light, a drop of dewYou slide into the swimming pool A roller coaster ride into the rivers of your mindThe currents merge, your feelings surge, your life's a pantomimeBeauty is the spiral going round &amp; round the beastWithout the vampire effect the carnival is deceased Fun. Roly PolyTopsy turvyHang upside downFall to the groundI think I'm going to be sick
