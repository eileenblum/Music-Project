(Constant bickering while the clock is tick tock ticking, will get you nowhere fast. Double penetrated debates expelling form a country which I masturbate, for if I were to die I would wish my fellow man not to resuscitate, thus nothing is stopping me from this overcast mockery. Here is just one example of placebo subject matter, to which sparks much laughter). Abandoned children left in mass graves that have turned into permanent orphanages. Yet silent because the dead can not cry. Governmental fore fathers left their biological counterparts in holes to die. Yet they ask why their children are comforted with foster care blankets covered in lye. Spread legs. Give life. Pro choice the freedom to destroy? Religious fanatics bomb abortion clinics. Neither side is right. Pro life makes it religiously and morally justified to take another life? Because it's the idea that you are only innocent as a child. But never when you have recognition of body and mind. Age does not define innocence. There is never a point in time. When it is okay to dictate when someone lives and when someone dies. Don't look for 100 percent justification on either side, because I will tell you to spare me each and every time. Tell me I hold no weight until I choose a side, and I will tell you to fuck off each and every time. Ask yourself this question: is it more admirable to live for an eye for an eye, or give up your own life so that another may be alive? Because if it is bloodshed you want, then let it be your own. Not their's and certainly not mine.
