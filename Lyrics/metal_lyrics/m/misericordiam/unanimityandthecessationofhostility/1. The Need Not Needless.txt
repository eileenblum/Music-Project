Pacifism and patience, the birth of a new generation.
Pacifism and patience, ever changing a population.
Pacifism and patience, new forms once spawned from hatred.
Pacifism and patience, bringing total liberation...
This is thought to be... The unexplainable unobtainable...
Where their lies a dull and docile society pseudo therapeutic psycho analysis bed rests.
Confusion chemical imbalances convinced you possess nonsense talents.
Societies expectations lead to suicide blood sprayed head rests.
Unable to keep up the average droids and drones an inescapable death sentence.

To achieve the need not needless....

When you are unhappy with the turnout and outcome of your life.
Years spent with your nine to five and so called achievements.
Countless hours being a conformed consumer worker slave and still nothing to show.
Your children then ask, " Why can't you feed us?"
(Would quickly lead you to say, " Why has it come to this?"
(Life)
Work to live. Do not live to work.)
What is wrong with this?
Without dreaming of a better life. Life is rendered meaningless
The Majority of people who watch their statistic IQ's plunder.
Banks foreclose and their fucking existence goes under.

(Told they do not possess genius.
Brainwashed childbirth life stopped. No ribbon to run through.
Instead chose to eat the painkiller, ambition relaxer way out.
A new species dubbed as unmotivated leeches...
To abstain and obey.
Government mob mentality, persuasion tactics, payed off teachers.
To abstain and obey.
From live birth to stillborn livelihood. This is what you teach us? And this is what i wish to teach you.
Do not live to work!
I am not lazy, I just don't let a job define me. Barely getting by does not in the least bit phase me.
Live under that idea and you should not have to work to live.)

Because if you love what you do and you are happy.
Then you will know what it truly means. To live....
One life, Job free.....
