Mutilated and left for dead. A random? act of homicide has left on individual repeatedly stabbed with a shotgun blast to the head. ( Rotton entrails settle in.) The thought process ended three minutes after she was pronounced dead. The brain or what was left of it continued to function. Lifeless? With one word 'FREEDOM' carved across her chest. This person has passed away! And no matter how you look at the situation. She will never have to experience the human condition for another day. To feel indifferent for another day. What is there left to worry about? No more social and economic divides. No more living in a world where money is valued higher than life.  (Rest in peace and rest in pieces.) If I was left dead in the gutter I would be thankful (because so many of the living walk aimlessly without the consideration of others. There are still so many to die.) Random or intentional? Physical or mental? Closed casket identifying strictly through dental. Was this a message sent from a being capable of thinking? Delivered by the dead and administered to the living? (I know of one thing.) The dead all have one thing in common true equality through rotting. (This is the day in the life of a decomposed body) Isnt she so lucky? To be taken from this place. We should all admire the girl without a face. Someone's life has been reduced to nothing. Left to be cleaned up by somebody. Shouldnt we all be so lucky?
