What if I told you this was already planned?That we have all been deprogrammed and reprogrammed? That we are not the masters of our own destinies? This can not be for i am man not machine!We are all human or are we? The answer tends to fluctuate when we stop thinking with our minds and thrive on hate. Your basic primitive animal instinct. To kill...To gather...for what we need. To kill...For thrill...Out of greed. Caste aside this selfish way of life When human life is given a price. Imagine life priced at ( $ 2.50...$3.50...) a gallon? Stop making measurements through borders. Stop making assumptions through politics. Or we can just say fuck this world and willing fully stand in line and wait to be crucified. The only problem is its not my time to die. Die! I dont think you will ever understand me or the message im trying to send. Human life is Human life. ( Food is not the only thing that makes this world starve) and the only apology you can give us is that... "I should have fucked you so hard" Fuck earths womb impregnate. Modern man is insane...
