Take away free speech. Leave us kneeling at our nations feet. Turn this countries population into a thousand starving mouths just so we have to beg for something to eat. A different day, the same struggle. To promote life. Why is it that we are still being misled by the same conservative mentality I have spent the last five years trying to fight? GET THEM AWAY! Know that the strength of one man is greater than any god created, or weapon ever made. We all possess this inside of ourselves to never speak softly and carry a big stick. We must leave our nations leaders in a random ditch. Line them up and put in the clip. As far as self incrimination goes fuck you because I plead the fifth. Anyone that tells you cant change the world, fuck them. Always try! Use your words. Use your mind. ( When people stop caring punch in your time card and commit suicide.) As cliche as it may sound NEVER GIVE IN because we all need to make this a safe world for our children to live in. I want to make this world a better place for you and me. So take my hand. This world has promise. We can stop this! There is a thin line between man and machine..so it is up to you and me to rise above the hypocrisy... I'M FUCKING UNSTOPPABLE
