Time has run out for you, your last rights are now due
Has life come to an end?
No it's all just begun

Now your bodies drifted from your soul, from your corpse dead and cold
See the people round your bed they're all cryin' cause your dead

[Chorus:]
Enter the darkness
Enter the light
Enter the darkness,
It's your death tonight....

As you walk through the gates, your soul is cold and sedate
As this nightmare in you, is now tearing through...you

[Chorus]

Now which way will you go?
Up or below because...
The devil wants your parted soul, for the evil things that you do
Heaven's hands reaching through,
Hear hell's angels calling you
