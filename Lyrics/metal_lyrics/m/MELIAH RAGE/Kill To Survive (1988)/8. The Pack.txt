As this day of hell comes to an end
Hear the pack emerse, from their den
See them moving towards your mighty prey
See the closing in, your final day
They can sense your fear, deep inside
You're their prey tonight so pray for life

[Chorus:]
The Pack
The Pack

You can feel death's grip from the pain
Ripping through your flesh, like a blade
Their piercing teeth, and their iron claws
The pack moves in now, nature's call
Try to run, Ha ! Ha !
try to hide
No escape,
The pack will find....

[Chorus]

The sun now shines across the grounds,
Revels the feast last night but not a sound
the snow now stained with human blood
For these lost souls life is done
So pray for souls, wandering endlessly
Until the next feast, the pack sleeps

[Chorus]
