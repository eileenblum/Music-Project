They gather in the fields
For satanic sacrifices there
They burn cut flesh
To give us presents to their Gods
The moon will light the way
Where the meat will soon lay
The orders given to slay.

Now they take away your lives,
Impaling doom is here tonight
Death calls for you!
Feel the blade rip through you

No way to escape your death
The hills have eyes and they see
Devils, demons sent from Hell
Will bring your bodies back to me
Dagger awaits you tonight,
Your blood I drink in a toast
For human sacrificial roast.

Now we take away your life
Impaling doom is here tonight
Death calls for you!
Feel the blade rip
Feel the blade slice
Feel the blade tear through you

You wait in the dark,
To meet your fate
Demons laugh and scream,
They love to slay
You die and see red,
Now you know
You're a serpent Lucifer's pet
You're down below

Now we take control of you.

Now as you see through death,
And taste the blood you just received
You drink and feast on flesh,
Dismembered bodies still bleed
Your fate lies below,
The master now has control
Of your lost forgotten soul.

Now we take away your life
Impaling doom is here tonight
Death calls for you !
Feel the blade rip
Feel the blade slice
Feel the blade tear through...you
