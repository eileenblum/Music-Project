The fighting's started
the war's just begun
Screaming soldiers blindly run
Smoke and fire claiming your last friend
And the bodies bleeding on the sand, it's the...
Beginning of the end

Broken heroes live through these wars
All the thousands remembered never more
Shattered pieces drift with the tide
Shot up faces, screaming through your mind

Marching towards your death
take your last breath...Now !

Feel the hand of doom
take control of you...Now !

The fighting's over
the war is done
Battered soldiers are dead and gone
Smoke and fire light up the light
Remaining nightmares rip through your mind

See the war is done
you're the only one...Now !
