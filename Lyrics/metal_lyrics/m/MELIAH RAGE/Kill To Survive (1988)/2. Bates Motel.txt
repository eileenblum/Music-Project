Into the night you can see her go
Down to the Bates Motel where her blood will flow
Psychos are everywhere
death is in the air
Norm's eyes drift then stare his mind ain't all there

[Chorus:]
Bates Motel

Room one the scene for craines last living days
Marion's sick way out was with Norm's blade
Stabbed times she died in her own blood bath
Not a single word was said and no last request

[Chorus:]
Bates Motel
it awaits you...

Stabbed sliced flesh torn away
She fell to her knees
Blood flowed out her veins
She was down but they stabbed her again
Stabbed sliced flesh torn
Bitch fell to knees
Blood flowed out veins
In Bates Motel
