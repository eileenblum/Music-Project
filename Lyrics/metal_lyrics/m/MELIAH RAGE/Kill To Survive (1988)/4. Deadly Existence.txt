As the fire's burning
death in the street
Smell the masses burning
commies at our feet
Teach us to kill
teach us to hate
Teach us to rip away
and to seal your fate

[Chorus:]
It takes you away

Hypnotized &amp; Paralyzed,
the killers are all here
Decay of rotting bodies lingers in the air
Suicidal rampage,
immense mental death
Silver bullets rippin,
claims all the rest

[Chorus:]
It takes you away
Your final day
It takes you away

Beaten battered tortured men slain in the night
Breed man for puppetry to kill and lie
Flaming flesh bodies burn the scene and sight
Lies, cries, screams of pain dissolve the brain
Feel my clenching death, it takes you away
Feel impaling you life's sucked away
Slaughtered bodies fallen, fallen down to me
I see corpses coming, nothing ever leaves

[Chorus:]
It takes you away
Your final day
It takes you away
