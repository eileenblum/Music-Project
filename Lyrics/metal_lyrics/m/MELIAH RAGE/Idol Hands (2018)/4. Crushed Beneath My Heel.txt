All your dreams and your desires
All the things that light the fires
All the passion that you feel
Crushed beneath my heel

All the things that you possess
All the joys of your success
Everything you think is real
Crushed beneath my heel

All your anger and all your pain
All the memories that remain
All the truths that you reveal
Crushed beneath my heel

You can't run - Can't hide - From me
There's no time - To waste - You'll see
You will feel - The pain - I feel
When you're crushed - Beneath - My heel

All the secrets that you hide
All the things you keep inside
All the thoughts that you concern
Crushed beneath my heel

All the things that you believe
All the blessings you receive
Everything that makes you kneel
Crushed beneath my heel

You can't run - Can't hide - From me
There's no time - To waste - You'll see
You will feel - The pain - I feel
When you're crushed - Beneath - My heel

You won't be able to deal
When you feel the pain I feel
You will be done for real
When you're crushed beneath my heel

You won't believe your eyes
When you look up and see pitch black skies
You won't be able to deal
When they finally serve you your last meal
You won't be able to feel
When you're finally crushed beneath my heel

You can't run - Can't hide - From me
There's no time - To waste - You'll see
You will feel - The pain - I feel
When you're crushed - Beneath - My heel

You won't be able to deal
When you feel the pain I feel
You will be done for real
When you're crushed beneath my heel

Everything you've ever known
Everything you've ever owned
Everything you think and feel
All the moments that you steal
Crushed beneath my heel
