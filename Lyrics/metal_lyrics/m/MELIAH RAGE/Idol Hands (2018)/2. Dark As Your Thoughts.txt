Darkness seeps like an evil mist
That creeps into your brain
You can't sleep, you're in too deep
Making you feel strange

Trapped inside your wildest dreams
Trapped in!
Trapped inside your wildest dreams
Trapped in...

Close your eyes, you can't disguise
The feeling in your soul
All is fine 'til you realize
You're not in control

Trapped inside your wildest dreams
Dark as your thoughts, dark as you scream
Hung up on the line between
Pleasure and pain, it's all the same
Overloaded circuitry
Dying to make your fantasy
Trapped inside your wildest dreams
Dark as your thoughts, dark as you scream

No turning back
No recompense
No second thoughts

No way out
No safe words
No second thoughts

Nobody heals
Nobody knows
Nobody cares

Thoughts are racing frantically
As you try to escape
Be careful what you wish for
'Cuz it might come your way

Visions flash
A million miles an hour in your head
In and out of consciousness
Wishing you were dead

Trapped inside your wildest dreams
Dark as your thoughts, dark as you scream
Hung up on the line between
Pleasure and pain, it's all the same
Overloaded circuitry
Dying to make your fantasy
Trapped inside your wildest dreams
Dark as your thoughts, dark as you scream
