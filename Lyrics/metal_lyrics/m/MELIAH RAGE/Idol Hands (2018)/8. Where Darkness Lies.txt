Night
Never was your friend
Nervousness on end
You can't comprehend
Why it makes you scream

Outside
Murder on the street
You can't go to sleep
So instead you dream
Dream your last dream

And when the night is here
The end is near
It's your final hour
'Cause everything dies
Where darkness lies

Despite
All that you believe
You will still receive
The fate of the naÃ¯ve
Darkness at your door

Inside
You will try to hide
But you will be denied
The perfect suicide
Who could ask for more

And when the night is here
The end is near
It's your final hour
'Cause everything dies
Where darkness lies

And when the night is through
There'll be nothing left of you
Except your cold remains
To wake the light of day
Night
Never was your friend
Nervousness on end
You can't comprehend
Why it makes you scream

Outside
Murder on the street
You can't go to sleep
So instead you dream
Dream your last dream

And when the night is here
The end is near
It's your final hour
'Cause everything dies
Where darkness lies
