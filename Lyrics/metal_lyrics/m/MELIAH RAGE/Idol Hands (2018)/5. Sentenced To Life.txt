Living with a pain inside
That never goes away
Dreading every second
Every minute, every day

Trapped inside your body
Locked inside your head
Dying to be someone else
Wishing you were dead

Sentenced to life
Where no one escapes
Nothing to live for
No one to blame
Sentenced to life
To live out your days
Locked in a world
Where no one remembers your name

Thinking you can't imagine that
Anyone could live this way
Not looking forward to the pain
Of another desperate way

Lying awake at night
Nightmares fill your dreams
Everybody is against you now
At least that's how it seems

Sentenced to life
Where no one escapes
Nothing to live for
No one to blame
Sentenced to life
To live out your days
Locked in a world
Where no one remembers your name
