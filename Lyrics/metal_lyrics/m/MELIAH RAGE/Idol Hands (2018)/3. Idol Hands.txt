Sitting all alone inside your room
Inside your head
Counting every second of your life
Until you're dead

Staring out your window as the world
Goes racing by
Staring into darkness
You start to wonder why

These idol hands
Will never shake and never pray
They are beholden to
The evil and depraved

Keeping all your thoughts inside a box
Beside your bed
Trying to ignore the evil voices
Inside your head

Wishing that your days
Were up and done
Trying to ignore the hopeless stares that come
From everyone

These idol hands
Will never shake and never pray
They are beholden to
The evil and depraved

These idol hands
Point you to your grave
Nothing to live for
Nothing lost and nothing saved

Sitting all alone inside your room
Inside your head
Counting every second of your life
Until you're dead

Staring out your window as the world
Goes racing by
Staring into darkness
You start to wonder why

These idol hands
Will never shake and never pray
They are beholden to
The evil and depraved

These idol hands
Point you to your grave
Nothing to live for
Nothing lost and nothing saved
