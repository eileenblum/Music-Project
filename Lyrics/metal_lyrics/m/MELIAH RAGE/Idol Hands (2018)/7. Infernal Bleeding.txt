I can't escape this pain
It's burning in my veins
A fire out of control
It's heating up my soul

It's got a hold of me
Why can't shake this thing
Just when I think it's gone
It comes back stronger

My blood is boiling with the fires
Of broken dreams and bad desires
And as I try to make things whole
Infernal bleeding takes its toll

I try to run away
But there is no escape
It calls me from inside
A place I cannot hide

It's like a bad disease
Of constant miseries
And once the need is gone
It comes back stronger

My blood is boiling with the fires
Of broken dreams and bad desires
And as I try to make things whole
Infernal bleeding takes its toll

It burns inside the tracks I've laid
Until my mind becomes its slave
And then before I even know
Infernal bleeding takes control

And as the needle breaks my skin
Heaven, then back to hell again
And as my eyes fade close to sleep
I know I've spiraled way too deep
It is the sickness unto death
It's stealing my last breath

It is the deadly lure
For which there is no cure
The hole I cannot fill
It is my final thrill

It's got a hold of me
Why can't I shake this thing
Just when I think it's gone
It comes back stronger

My blood is boiling with the fires
Of broken dreams and bad desires
And as I try to make things whole
Infernal bleeding takes its toll

It burns inside the tracks I've laid
Until my mind becomes its slave
And then before I even know
Infernal bleeding takes control
