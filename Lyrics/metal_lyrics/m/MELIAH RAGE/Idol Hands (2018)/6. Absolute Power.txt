Withholding information is the nature of the game
With absolute power comes absolute reign
Total annihilation is the only way to play
With absolute power comes absolute pain
Racial degradation is the flavor of the day
With absolute power comes absolute shame
Spewing from his shit hole comes a message of disdain

Build a wall of paranoia
Build a wall of hate
Build a wall of ignorance
With absolute power comes absolute pain

The Emperor of Collusion and the King of Twitter Space
With absolute power he's hard to embrace
He's playing with the fate of the entire human race
With absolute power he's an absolute disgrace
And when he hits the button we'll be gone without a trace
With absolute power comes absolute reign
Total insurrection is the best way to erase

Build a wall of paranoia
Build a wall of hate
Build a wall of ignorance
With absolute power comes absolute pain

Fear, your castle
Take it away
Fear, your castle
Take it away
