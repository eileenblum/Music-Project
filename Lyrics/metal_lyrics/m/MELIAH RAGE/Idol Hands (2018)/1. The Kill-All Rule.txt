There's no exceptions, there's no escape
And you can't hide your thoughts away
You're afraid

It's coming for you, it's at your door
And you can't hide from it anymore
This is war

Your enemies are your own mistakes
They give you away more than you can take
You're a fake

It's killing you from the inside out
And filling you with fear and doubt
No way out

When everything appears as lost
You bury the bodies and count the cost
No clues left behind, you fool
Everything must run its course
They will die to enforce
The Kill-All Rule, the Kill-All Rule

No one here gets out alive
No prisoners
Accept no bribes
You cannot leave a trace behind
'Cause what you've done
Is a disgrace to mankind

The Kill-All Rule, the Kill-All Rule

There's no reset
There's no resource
There's no resurrection
There's no recourse
There's no reset
There's no resource
There's no resurrection

When everything appears as lost
You bury the bodies and count the cost
No clues left behind, you fool
Everything must run its course
They will die to enforce
The Kill-All Rule, the Kill-All Rule

Fear
Like nothing ever feared before...
