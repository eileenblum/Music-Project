A child, a boy, a girl
A legacy bestowed
How do you view the world?
And how do you fill that hole?
Is there a consciousness?
To seek our righteousness
The mirror can't reflect
What's absent from your soul

History will tell, if firm foundations last
Where will we end up? Living in the past
History will tell, if we rose or fell
Where we have landed, History will tell

Nations will come and go
Just look around the world
But, I'll keep my family whole
With love, and faith, and hope
I'll take Him above it all
The Word my All and All
The Son, my Cornerstone
His blood it does atone

History will tell, if firm foundations last
Where will we end up? Living in the past
History will tell, if we rose or fell
Where we have landed, History will tell
