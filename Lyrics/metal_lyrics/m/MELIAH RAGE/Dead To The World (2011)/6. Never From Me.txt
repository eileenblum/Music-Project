There's something taking over me
A darkness that I cannot see
It's multiplying
From the smallest cell
'Til it becomes my living hell

Apathy... Growing in me
Take a look around you
That's all you'll see
Like cancer of the soul

Sympathy... Never from me
I'm not here to soot
He your insecurities
I'm cold as stone - yeah

Destiny... Dead end street
Never really sure
What I'm supposed to be
The beauty or the beast

Enemies... Coming at me
From every direction
And it's turning me
As cold as stone - yeah

There's something pulsing
Through my veins
And it's the source of all my pain
An angry pulse disguised as hate
So strong it steals my breath away

My life will deny me
All the pleasures I have known
Darkness will devour me
With a vengeance of its own

Like death cells multiplying
In dark corners of my soul
My fate will be decided
In a place as cold as stone

There's something taking over me
A darkness that I cannot see
It's multiplying
From the smallest cell
'Til it becomes my living hell
