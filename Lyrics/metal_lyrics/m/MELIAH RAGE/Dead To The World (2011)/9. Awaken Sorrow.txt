"This song reflects my time in Haiti. Amidst the darkness there was an overwhelming light. Amidst the sorrow, an all consuming fire. Thank you, God. May this song bring you the glory."
[Mike Munro, June 2011]

Load'em up, climb on board
Take a seat and pray
Am I ready to see it now?
How they live day to day
Look around, I can see it now
But can I fix their misery?
I know of One, the only Son
That can heal, hands free

It seems so clear
Why he sent me here
The faces, the places
His Grace among the strangest
As I walk the valley
I show no fear

Shocked and amazed
Crushed and blamed
Those words cannot describe
All the things revealed to me
About myself will now arise
Hope is strenght a bridge to be
Lord help us all to see
Brought to light my darkest pride
Revealed to me, I can't deny

It seems so clear
Why He sent me here
The faces, the places
His Grace among the strangest
As I walk the valley
I show no fear

Awaken sorrow
Dream tomorrow
Awaken my sorrow
Dream tomorrow...

Back to the grind,
Haven't missed a beat, our reality
Never be the same, bringing change
Like the Potter's clay
I saw the hope on a child's face
And I'm blown away
I know of One, the only Son
That can heal, hands free

It seems so clear
Why He sent me here
The faces, the places
His Grace among the strangest
As I walk the valley
I show no fear
