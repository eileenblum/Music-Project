Right now
I'm coming
After you and there's no escape
Right now
I'm giving
Out more punishment than you can take
Step off
I'm not kidding
I'm armed with hate and I'm on a roll
That bomb
Where I'm sitting
There's not a chance in hell
To save your soul

It's a cold cruel fate
When they beat you down
You try to crawl away
Never to be found
And there's no escape
It's a cold cruel fate

Right now
I'm willing
To sacrifice your mortal soul
Right now
I'm winning
And you can't escape
My strangehold

Right now
Submission
Is all that I'll accept from you
Right now
I'm wishing
That I could break your will in two

It's a cold cruel fate
When they beat you down
You try to crawl away
Never to be found
It's a cold cruel fate
When they rape your soul
You try to hide your shame
Underneath your sorrow
It's a cold cruel fate
It's a cold cruel fate
And there's no escape
It's a cold cruel fate

When there's nothing left
But a pile of bones
I'll dig a hole and bury your soul
'Cause there's no escape
From this cold cruel fate

Right now
I'm coming
After you and there's no escape
Right now
I'm giving
Out more punishment than you can take
Step off
I'm not kidding
I'm armed with hate and I'm on a roll
That bomb
Where I'm sitting
There's not a chance in hell
To save your soul

It's a cold cruel fate
When they beat you down
You try to crawl away
Never to be found
And there's no escape
It's a cold cruel fate

It's a cold cruel fate
When they beat you down
You try to crawl away
Never to be found
It's a cold cruel fate
It's a cold cruel fate
