Ever since I came to be
Evil surrounding me
Like the shadow of a thief
Stealing my identity

I know that hope is blind
And there's no truth to find
Somebody help me please
Before I lose my mind

Darkness enlighten me
With the things I cannot see
I'm sliding down below
To a place only the demons know

Everyone's forsaken me
My cold reality
Every time I plant a seed
It flowers misery

Seeing things I can't explain
Lost in a world that I never made
Crawling through the desert of my soul
Living in a place
Where nothing ever grows

Ever since I came to be
Evil surrounding me
Like the shadow of a thief
Stealing my identity

I know that hope is blind
And there's no truth to find
Somebody help me please
Before I lose my mind

Feeling things I can't explain
Trapped in a world that I never made
Burning in the desert of my soul
Dying in a place
Where nothing ever grows

Nothing but darkness as I rot beneath the soil
A soul in limbo left to suffer and toil.
Outside the gates of Heave where my soul will be detained.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained

My faith is here beside me
In a cloak made out of tears
If you could peer inside me
You'd see my greatest fears revealed

Feeling things I can't explain
Trapped in a world that I never made
Burning in the desert of my soul
Dying in a place
Where nothing ever grows
