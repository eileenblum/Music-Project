Evil surrounding me
So dark I cannot see
So I turn on my TV
And watch the world go up in flames

Everyday the news is worse
It's as if the world was cursed
And I'm gonna get there first
And watch it all go up in flames

This nightmare is complete
So I'll accept defeat
For a chance to escape the heat
As I watch the world
Go up in flames

I'm running out of breath
The sickness unto death
Until there's nothing left
As the whole world goes up in flames

The flames fly high into the night
And bring to light our sacrifice
In the gaze of Satan's eyes
Nothing sacred will survive

The planets have aligned
It's just another sign
Earthquakes and hurricanes
And soon the world goes up in flames

Another killer wave
Radioactive brave
They're screaming to be saved
I want the world goes up in flames

A terrorist attack
The seas are burning black
Somebody light a match
And watch it all go up in flames

Another fucking crash
We're running out of cash
We need a blacklash
We watch it all go up in flames

Fly high into the night
And bring to light our sacrifice
In the gaze of Satan's eyes
Nothing sacred will survive

The overzealous underworld
Will stake its claim
With flags unfurled
Every soul must choose a side
In the final battle to divide

Evil surrounding me
So dark I cannot see
So I turn on the TV
And watch the world go up in flames

Everyday the news is worse
It's as if the world was cursed
And I'm gonna get there first
And watch it all go up in flames

This nightmare is complete
So I'll accept defeat
For a chance to escape the heat
As I watch the world
Go up in flames

The flames fly high into the night
And bring to light our sacrifice
In the gaze of Satan's eyes
Nothing sacred will survive

The overzealous underworld
Will stake its claim
With flags unfurled
Every soul must choose a side
In the final battle to divide
