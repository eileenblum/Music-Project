My days are caving in on me
Before I know it
I work my fingers to the bone
With nothing to show for it

Time won't let me breathe
I can't believe it
It's scaring me to death
That I can't catch my breath
Time won't let me breathe

The nights are chasing
All my dreams of light away
Before I sleep
I pray I'll see another day

Time won't let me breathe
I can't believe it
It's scaring me to death
That I can't catch my breath
Time won't let me breathe

The nights are chasing
All my dreams of light away
Before I sleep
I pray I'll see another day
Before I sleep
I pray I'll see another day
