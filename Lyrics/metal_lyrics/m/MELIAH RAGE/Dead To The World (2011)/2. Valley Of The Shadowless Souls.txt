Trapped in the valley of the shadowless souls
Drowning in a cold, black sea of sorrow
Screaming down at hell to look out below
Running out of time 'cause there's no tomorrow

Trapped in the valley of the shadowless souls
Drowning in a cold, black sea of sorrow
Screaming down at hell to look out below
Running out of time 'cause there's no tomorrow

The window's closing now
It's cracked behind the shade
I sit alone in darkness
Waiting for the day

The wind is cold
And blows away
The candle's flame
There's not a soul alive
Who understands my pain

Trapped in the valley of the shadowless souls
Drowning in a cold, black sea of sorrow
Screaming down at hell to look out below
Running out of time 'cause there's no tomorrow

Trapped in the valley of the shadowless souls
Drowning in a cold, black sea of sorrow
Screaming down at hell to look out below
Running out of time 'cause there's no tomorrow

The days are shorter now
My time is spiraling in
There is no penance
That can wash away my sin

I'm barely clinging
To my own pathetic life
Someday wake me up
Before I say goodnight forever

Trapped in the valley of the shadowless souls
Drowning in a cold, black sea of sorrow
Screaming down at hell to look out below
Running out of time 'cause there's no tomorrow
