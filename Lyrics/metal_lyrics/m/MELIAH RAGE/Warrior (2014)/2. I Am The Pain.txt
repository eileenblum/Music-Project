Nice to meet you, here we are again
Do you remember this relationship we have
We are one, empty symptom to our decay
I am the destroyer of your waking day

I AM THE PAIN
I BRING THE REIGN UPON YOUR WORLD
MY DOMAIN / TO STAND ALONE IN ITS DEFEAT
I AM THE PAIN

I'm the master, a ruler of your mind
Let me take you to a place so divine
Bound by pleasure, numbing sense of flesh or time
Altered heavens or am I in a lake of fire

I AM THE PAIN
I BRING THE REIGN UPON YOUR WORLD
MY DOMAIN / TO STAND ALONE IN ITS DEFEAT
I AM THE PAIN

THIS DARK DESIRE / HOPELESS LIAR
WASH BLOOD ALL OVER ME
TO STAND ALONE IN ITS DEFEAT
I AM THE PAIN

Loneliness in flames, sacrificed in vain
Disciplined pain, carry me away
