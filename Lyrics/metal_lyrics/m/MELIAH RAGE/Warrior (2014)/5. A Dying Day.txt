By dust we commit thee to a faith
Thy tongue, it violates our way
Sanctity, enforced on me, silently wade
Resurrection of the pain

A DYING HOUR IN A DYING DAY
SALVATION BY FEAR IN A GOD'S NAME
IS WHAT WE SEE OF OURSELVES DECAYED
OR DIVINE
A DYING HOUR IN A DYING DAY

Creature, devil's preacher, blood soaked infamy
Suffering soul search, death's company
Fear follows here, shame becomes blame
On your knees, you sever away

A DYING HOUR IN A DYING DAY
SALVATION BY FEAR IN A GOD'S NAME
IS WHAT WE SEE OF OURSELVES DECAYED
OR DIVINE
A DYING HOUR IN A DYING DAY

Enveil, impaled, saints torturing
Voice to mind to structured lies, imprisonment
Quietly speaking, the books are all bleeding
Redemption is for sale!
