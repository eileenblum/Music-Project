I'd rather twist my mind, rip your world apart
Leave you to wonder, am I hiding in the dark

GIVE MY LIFE AWAY / AGONIZING DEATH
HOPELESSLY PERVERSE DECAY
ADORING BLAME / ENTICING SAINTS
SHROUDED IN FLAMES FOREVER
IN HATE WITH YOU

Every waking moment, I desire hurting you
Insatiable hunger, blood, soul, will of you

GIVE MY LIFE AWAY / AGONIZING DEATH
HOPELESSLY PERVERSE DECAY
ADORING BLAME / ENTICING SAINTS
SHROUDED IN FLAMES FOREVER
IN HATE WITH YOU

Anger bleeds my soul away
All that's left of me embraced
Hollow man, empty, torn
Sweet hopeless blame

Like silence after question
Mad laughter, only friend
What remains after judgment
This anguish never ends
