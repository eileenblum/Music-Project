The dirty color of red, scarred across your face
Truth plays a dangerous game, a fine line between here and fate
Dying need, false belief, punctured walls of lives, deceit
Never spoken, tight fist of hand... Into rage

STRANGER TO YOUR SYMPATHY
ANGER / RAGING AGONY
STRANGER TO YOUR SYMPATHY
ANGER / CONSUMING ALL OF ME

I never spoke with God you said
Start to pray for heaven sent
Appalling wisdom tortures me
Abrupt seamless soul set free
Enemy, captivity, mourning loss of self-pity
Dark parade to the house of death
In a rage

STRANGER TO YOUR SYMPATHY
ANGER / RAGING AGONY
STRANGER TO YOUR SYMPATHY
ANGER / CONSUMING ALL OF ME

The dirty color of red, scarred across your face
Truth plays a dangerous game, a fine line between here and fate
Dying need, false belief, punctured walls of lives, deceit
Never spoken, tight fist of hand... Into rage
By my command
