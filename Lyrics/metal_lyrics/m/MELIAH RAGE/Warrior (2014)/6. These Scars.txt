Staring down from my crucifixion unto myself
Hunched and torn, quivered out, the pendulum strives twelve
Triumph and agony, fear and pain consume my will
A thousand words of hate, constant pounding fate
Beating, breaking, breathe to defy

THESE SCARS DEFINE THE LIFE I BREATHE
THESE SCARS DFINE MY BLOOD AND NEED
TRUTH BEHIND LIES / WORDS SPOKE DENY
UPON MYSELF THESE SCARS DEFINE

I felt a funeral in my soul
Monsters treading, endlessly to toll the bell to sell
My passion too wretched
Concernies drones, goodbye to all I know
A ghost of myself
Heartless, unfelt, hallowed
Beating, breaking, breathe to defy

THESE SCARS DEFINE THE LIFE I BREATHE
THESE SCARS DFINE MY BLOOD AND NEED
TRUTH BEHIND LIES / WORDS SPOKE DENY
UPON MYSELF THESE SCARS DEFINE
