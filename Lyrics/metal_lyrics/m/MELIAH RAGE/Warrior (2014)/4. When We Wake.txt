Sun falls into artificial night, last breath of a stranger
Is what we see, what we see or seems
All a dream, fractured reality

Until our minds are not our own (Suffocation)
Awaken endless nightmare (Intoxication)
Forsakened eyes from what you've known (Annihilation)
Enslaved Creation

WHEN WE WAKE FROM MASS DELUSION
TEARS AWAY WORLD ILLUSION
WHEN WE WAKE TO CONTROL
OUR OWN LIVES BEGIN

Bring down the sky, become the day
Like a small child, innocence away
Quickening, a pulse to the system
Reverse conscience decay

Until our minds are not our own (Suffocation)
Awaken endless nightmare (Intoxication)
Forsakened eyes from what you've known (Annihilation)
Enslaved Creation

WHEN WE WAKE FROM MASS DELUSION
TEARS AWAY WORLD ILLUSION
WHEN WE WAKE TO CONTROL
OUR OWN LIVES BEGIN

No more lies, fear now dies
