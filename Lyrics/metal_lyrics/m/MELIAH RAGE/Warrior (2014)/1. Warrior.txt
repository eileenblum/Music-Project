Now ever engage the world, follow the path to be
In front of us, attention to ordinary reality
Take from it, draw from it
What you need of it for open eyes to see
Alert, attuned, moment's presentness, mindful absolution
Life, death, love, hate, belief, no fate

Fearlessness is the willingness, to arise and face your fear
To acknowledge it, you must embrace it
Accept, become a friend
Heartbeat, heartbreak in suffering
Sustaining life by denial's hand
My rising wind horse, conflict strikes, engage to kill
Life, death, love, hate, belief, no fate

I AM A WARRIOR / THROUGH THESE EYES
I SENSE A WARRIOR / IN OUR LIVES

Only I remain
Where has fear gone
What drives the want of more
Lead by heart, intent of difference
Strong, ready, sight line of victory

My adversary of death, always present left side
Awareness of him near makes us feel more alive
Virtue, absolute, honesty, impartial truth un-denied
Today, tomorrow, eternity, morality will exit
Life, death, love, hate, belief, no fate
