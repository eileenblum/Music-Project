Fire clouds pass through a snow filled night
Reflecting frames eyes of diamond shine
Standing alone you feel the shiver cold
Naked and stoned in frozen winds of sorrow

You take every breath
It burns your heart dead
You drain your life now
Silent death renown

Laugh while you may now
Who are you with
Dance while you may now
Dance with the blacksmith

Dragons burn through your veins tonight
Strangling bloodline injecting suicide
Jesus Christ I cannot break these chains
My sin rips up my self restraint

Laugh while you may now
Who are you with
Dance while you may now
Dance with the blacksmith

Dance

Forgive my sins my addiction stain

Burn deep the pain you bring to me
tell lies if the truth reveals reality
Time stands you're drifting to the sky
Standing upon a crystallized high

Laugh while you may now
Who are you with
Dance while you may now
Dance with the Blacksmith
