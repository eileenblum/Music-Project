I'm wide awake I can't be dreaming
Still disbelieving what I see
I hear a distant voice is screaming
I know that voice belongs to me

And I wonder as I fight will I die tonight?

This is a nightmare from out of nowhere
This is a nightmare from out of nowhere
Death Valley Dream

My life unfolds before my eyes
As I lie broken and alone
I feel my soul begin to slowly rise
Leave behind blood and broken bones

And I wonder as I fight will I die tonight?

This is a nightmare from out of nowhere
This is a nightmare from out of nowhere
Death Valley Dream

My spirit soaring through the desert sky
I watch the scene unfold below
I know it's not yet time to die say goodbye
How I cheated death I'll never know

And I know because I fight I will not die tonight

This is a nightmare from out of nowhere
This is a nightmare from out of nowhere
Death Valley Dream
