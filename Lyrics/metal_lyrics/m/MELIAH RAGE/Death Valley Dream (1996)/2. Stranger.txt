Here I am with a bible in my hand
Trying really hard to understand
Something I don't think anybody can
Namely man's inhumanity to man

Here I am with a bottle in my hand
Trying to escape from my fellow man
Trying to remember what it means to be a man
Feeling like a stranger in a strange land

Nobody here can tell me
I fight a losing fight
Nobody can convince me
I don't know wrong from right
You call each other brothers
And when you turn your backs
You try to kill each other
Mad dogs in a pack

Stranger
All my life I've been a stranger
Stranger
And life keeps getting stranger
Stranger

Here I am with a weapon in my hand
Trying to defend myself from my fellow man
Hanging on to sanity by a slender strand
Violence was never any part of the plan
Common sense doesn't seem to apply
Good advice cannot help me to get by
Over time all the rules they have been changed
Overnight things have really gotten strange

Nobody here can tell me
I fight a losing fight
Nobody can convince me
I don't know wrong from right
You call each other brothers
And when you turn your backs
You try to kill each other
Mad dogs in a pack

Stranger...
