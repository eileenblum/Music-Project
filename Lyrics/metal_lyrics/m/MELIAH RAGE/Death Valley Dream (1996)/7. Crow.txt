Feeling lonely feeling used
I think I'll fly awhile
Escape the demons escape it all
Take on a new style

Give in to the darker side
Let the rivers flow
Rip it up raise some hell
You're flying with the crows

Fall from grace fall from glory
I saw it coming in my mind's eye
Fall from grace fall from glory
How many times does a dead man have to die

Are you crazy are you lost
Nothing seems the same
Search your heart search your soul
Can't find the things you need

Consumed by a lying world
Never turn your back
Flying higher seek and conquer
Feel the crow's attack

Fall from grace fall from glory
I saw it coming in my mind's eye
Fall from grace fall from glory
How many times does a dead man have to die
