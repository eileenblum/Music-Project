I wonder can I weather the storm?
Been fighting since the day I was born
I've always had a right to be wrong
I wish I knew that all along

Force of fate can't tear me down
Time &amp; tide won't wear me down
I've had more than my fair share
All this wear &amp; tear

As each day goes flying by
Another chance another try
As soon as this day is done
Another one has begun

Force of fate can't tear me down
Time &amp; tide won't wear me down
I've had more than my fair share
All this wear &amp; tear

When each step could be your last
Don't follow them back into the past
All I need I carry deep inside
Where I stand the future's open wide

Force of fate can't tear me down
Time &amp; tide won't wear me down
I've had more than my fair share
All this wear &amp; tear
