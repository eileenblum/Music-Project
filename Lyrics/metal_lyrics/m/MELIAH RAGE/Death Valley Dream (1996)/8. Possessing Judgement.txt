They damn this life before me
Then choose to criticize
Closed minded peasants
They hide behind their lies
Hide in disguise

Enchanted by this power
The all mighty we must serve
Hostility still beckons me
But who shall burn to learn

Feeding you lies
See right through your eyes
Cure the pain
Sins bleeding and breeding
Challenging the blessed
Possessing judgement

Signs given pray for the healer
In sickness and disease
Taken us for all we're wort
Sentence of blasphemy
No honesty

Wolves in sheep's clothing
Stalking out their prey
Sensation from degradation
Deceivers the mind's array

Feeding you lies
See right through your eyes
Cure the pain
Sins bleeding and breeding
Challenging the blessed
Possessing judgement

Judge not how you shall judge yourself
Altering egos
Represent themselves from hell
On grows you power
This nation built your strength
Who will you crucify
When we abandon faith

Feeding you lies
See right through your eyes
Cure the pain
Sins bleeding and breeding
Challenging the blessed
Possessing judgement
