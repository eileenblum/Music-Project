Science and magic
Beautifully tragic
Secret obsession
Manic depression

In the thundering distance
I hear voices that say
That I am the master
Of all I survey

Through the deafening silence
Comes a message for me
I see beauty in chaos
Like some mad poetry

Under hypnosis
Severe psychosis
Mild paranoia
State of euphoria

Through the deafening silence
I hear voices that say
That I am the master
Of all I survey

In the thundering distance
There's a message I see
There is beauty in chaos
Madness &amp; poetry

Schizophrenia
Bi-polar mania
Self destruction
Major malfunction
Bury the pain
Scars remain
Twisted psychology
Madness &amp; poetry
