Yeah I cannot take this
Can't take this anymore
Yeah all this hatred
Can't relate with it anymore

Yeah never felt so
Never felt so damned confused
Everyone around me
Tellin' about the same scene
Sick to death of it all
Sick to death of it all

Turn the channel turn it up
Some guy axed his wife
Read the pages between the lines
Have you read enough
Make a stand raise a voice
The future's in your hands
