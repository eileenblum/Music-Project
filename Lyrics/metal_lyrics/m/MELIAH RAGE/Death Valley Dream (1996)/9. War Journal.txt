War journal final entry
Guns silent chambers empty

Thousand pages tell the tale
Wars no one will know
Final chapter writes itself
One more left to go

War journal final entry
Stand silent soul is empty

Thousand pages tell the tale
Wars no one will know
Final chapter writes itself
One more left to go

War journal final entry
Guns silent chambers empty
End transmission
Over and Out [Repeat]

War journal final entry

[Repeat and fade]
