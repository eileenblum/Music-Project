Born into a lying world
torn apart by righteous pain
Thrown into a well of despair
Raised upon this desert plain

Take my hand trust my words
We are brothers of this world
Steal your land lying words
Superior race rape this world
Broken hearts bloodstained land
Torn and ravaged by fellow man
Watch in horror as tears and blood
Flow together in a flood

Scars they now remain
Upon a land never the same
Waste a wasted race survives
Pride it tears them up inside

Take my hand trust my words
We are brothers of this world
Steal your land lying words
Superior race rape this world
Broken hearts bloodstained land
Torn and ravaged by fellow man
Watch in horror as tears and blood
Flow together in a flood

Born into this dying race
Torn apart by righteous ways
Waste a wasted place survives
Pride will never be denied

Take my hand trust my words
We are brothers of this world
Steal your land lying words
Superior race rape this world
Broken hearts bloodstained land
Torn and ravaged by fellow man
Watch in horror as tears and blood
Flow together in a flood
