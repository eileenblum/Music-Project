Sometimes, I wonder
Where have I been
All these years invisible
Too much, too little, too late
My life, an illusion
Of shadows in the dark
How can I reason
My mind torn apart

Oh lord I believe
Oh lord I receive
All I can say
Is except my belief
Pray to the son
My hallowed one
All I can say is
Accept me your son

My time falls away
Soon life will pass
Confusion frustration
This anger drives me mad
Now searching for a feeling
Of strength, now I pray

Oh lord I believe
Oh lord I receive
All I can say
Is except my belief
Pray to the son
My hallowed one
All I can say is
Accept me your son
