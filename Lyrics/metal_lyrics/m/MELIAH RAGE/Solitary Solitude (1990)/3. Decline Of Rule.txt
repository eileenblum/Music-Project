The iron curtain
Across the northern sea
A nation's deviation
From all honesty
Deception lingers
In malevolent minds
Defiant races
They shall survive

Stalinism
Control through fear
Dictorial methods
Brought blood and tears
Rebel forces
Revolt through war
Incised steel
Brings pained remorse

Communistic way of life
Peace is hell
Free their lives freed by death
Die or kill
Drink the wine stimulate life
Live in hell
Rebel against government rule
Kill at will

Despised ruler
The most abhorred
Cynical loser
Hooks their hordes
Staged and caged
Plagued with rage
Degraded age
Their medieval ways

Communistic way of life
This heaven's hell
Free their lives freed by death
Die or kill
Drink the wine stimulate life
Reap in hell
Rebel against government rule
Pray at will
