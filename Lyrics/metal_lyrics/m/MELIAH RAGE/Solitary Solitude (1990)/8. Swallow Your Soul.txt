A hidden passageway
To evil worlds beyond man
Was written long ago
When seas ran red with blood
Hell's blood wicked and demised
Was used to ink their dark book
In thirteen hundred A.D.
The opus lost for centuries

Conjuring demons
From the book of the dead
They prey on your mortal life
And dance in the darkness
Conjuring demons
From the book of the dead
They prey on your mortal soul
And take you to dwell in hell

This book is said to speak
Of a spiritual presence that reaps
Evil that roams in vain
In the forest and dark, bowers of man's domain
Recital of passages
They possess the living, to feed their dead
Evil confrontate
The things that were shall be again

Conjuring demons
From the book of the dead
They prey on your mortal life
And dance in the darkness
Conjuring demons
From the book of the dead
They prey on your mortal soul
And take you to dwell in hell

Evil dead decapitate
Bodies bleed reincarnate
Demons scream abominate
Witches hang in levitate
The chant you speak controls your fate
Dead by dawn, they laugh and wait
Evil dead will take you now
Evil dead will take you down

An open passageway
To evil worlds beyond man
Swallow your soul they say
To the world it came and death began
Final passage never spoke
Dark spirits and souls now ascend
Your life is twisted sucked away
Swallow your soul end your fate

Conjuring demons
From the book of the dead
They prey on your mortal life
And dance in the darkness
Conjuring demons
From the book of the dead
They prey on your mortal soul
And take you to dwell in hell

They take you down to live in hell
We take you down to dwell in hell
