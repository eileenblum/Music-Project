Sequestered, secluded
Locked up, shackled, chained
He's ruled insane
Madman - killing any woman, child, man
Maniac - crazed by the pain in his brain
Madness - ceased by a shot to his vein

Solitary solitude
He's isolated in fear
Solitary solitude
Your isolated nightmare

Like Manson, like Bundy
A sick lust to end humanity
Malevolent - evil-minded molester of chastity
Savagery - morbid venomous dead brutality
Infernal - ruthless retched sleaze no sanity

Solitary solitude
He's isolated in fear
Solitary solitude
Your isolated nightmare

No doors plainted walls all he sees
Named aberrant, neurotic and diseased
Outcast devil
Deranged and malign
Sickened repetition
Focus in his mind
Abnormality, ferality
Not of the earth to be
Vitality, stability
His insincerity now
Electrocution persecution
Shock treatment today
Ten thousand bolts ten thousand volts
See his brain decay
Vested now, shredded
His life begins to fade
Desolating excruciating
Pain of life it drains from him
