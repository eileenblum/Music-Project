Sun sets, the sky is black
House of horror is in your path
Too young to die, too old to live
On this night your soul you give

Your flesh burns, plagued fear
Stygian shores now appear
She rises up from her grave
She came back, death day

The witching - lives are burning tonight
The witching - souls are burning tonight

The room below, her grave to be
Buried alive for centuries
A book of magic holds the key
The rhymes and verses have set her free

Your flesh burns, slaughters here
Stygian shores have appeared
She rose up from her grave
She came back it's your day
You're spellbound, frozen in fear
Her wicked ways cast you there
The pain and torment a smothered life
Damned and cursed, she takes your life

The witching - lives are burning tonight
The witching - souls are burning tonight

Black magic, chants and spells
Revenge tonight, damned to hell
No way to live, just to die
Through centuries, all must die
