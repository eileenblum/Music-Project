You - you're gone
You've stuck that needle in your arm
Now you - you're lost
You kill for a fix at any cost
And you - a slave
Hooked on that shit a wasted state
Blind loser's fate

Lost hope, lost life, lost soul
You lost your life
Lost hope, lost life, lost soul

You - you're gone
Roll up that bill and make your straw
Now you - you're lost
You lay out your line a white-collar crime
You're infected
You smoke all your coke your brain is dead
Brain burnt up dead

Lost hope, lost life, lost soul
You lost your life
Lost hope, lost life, lost soul

Cocain, heroin, marijuana, crack
That new shit ice, that old crap smack
All can thrill, all will kill
But will you risk lost life

You - you lost
A bullet through the brain a silent shot
Now you - you're dead
Your corpse on the floor life decayed
See your life gone
A game that you played and lost
You played and lost

Lost hope, lost life, lost soul
You lost your life
Lost hope, lost life, lost soul
