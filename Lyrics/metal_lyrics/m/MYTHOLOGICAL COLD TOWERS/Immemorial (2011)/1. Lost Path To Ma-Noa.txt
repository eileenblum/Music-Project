I roam to the lost city
And proceed towards the recesses of Antichthon
Beyond the gorges of Kish
Beyond the mist of Tanum

Over and above the gates of Salazere
A poisonous fog blinds my eyes
An enigma of desolation
I'm in front of the forgotten portal

On it, inscriptions of an indecipherable alphabet
Walls of illusions, a Faustian dwelling
I roam to the lost city

A golden mirror, quintessence of the Sun
I advance under the veil of the Amazon
Just ahead.,.a skull, an evil omen

Through the jungle towards the legendary Paititi
Stricken by the arrows of Kalapalos
At the meeting with the Mavutsinim
