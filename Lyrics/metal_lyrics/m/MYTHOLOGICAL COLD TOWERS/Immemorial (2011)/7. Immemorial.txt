Move away from the blowing winds
Between the columns from the Chthonian Temple
Fall upon thee the glaring light of the great Sun
That exile in the islands beyond the sea murmurs
The deadly burden, unbearable, invisible dim in the tank of the night

Immemorial

Thou shalt come, without the glaring light
With oblations to the Demigods from the BÃ³thros
Thou shalt come, between animals and gods, extinct giants
Thou shalt come, blazing swords protected by deal! stars
Now on your lapis lazuli scepter will brandish never seen before dimensions.

Immemorial
