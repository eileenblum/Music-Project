From the arid soil of my soul
In the name of the ancient Korafas

The crawling forgotten glory
From kings of the wood of Gondwanas
But the trumpets shall sound
And spearls shall reach them

Between ice and eternal fire

Many nations, the breed of Mut
Were facing the twilight
They've heard a lugubrious rumble

The roaring wind
At no man's land
Outshines the naked stone

Heavy untouched remains
Have dominated the dusk for ages
Offering silences drowned in swamps
Trapped immense lament

Unspeakable distance from its rising
Home of the austral ghost
Eve of the fall

Thou shall enter the halls of power
Thou shall enter the halls of of time

They were cyclopic living walls
That enclosed them

A voice from the pleiades have guided them
Thy home is not here
But beyond the seas

There thou shall find Tecum Uman again

I invite thou to enter the halls of power
I invite thou to enter the halls of time
