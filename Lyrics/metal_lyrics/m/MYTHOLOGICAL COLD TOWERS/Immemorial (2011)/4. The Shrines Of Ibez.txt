Sunset in El Dorado
Behind the lost veil

I am the basalt enlightened by the full moon
Mirroring the stone gateway
LÃ©tha, Cyclopean end

I run deep into the forest
An inexpugnable maze of luxury
I am an intruder here
I witness the unseen rites
I have discovered the secret
I am acallas' temple
Enlightened lost gate

Thus i can adore the ancient nights
