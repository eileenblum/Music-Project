The majestic Atuahualpa slept in this supreme kingdom
Contemplating the golden light that the sun irradiated

And in the empire built between the stones in this misty plateau
Pachacutec rises to the meeting of the solar kingdom

The incan emperor, the ancient dream in the endless nights, with the sight of shiny gates which open
Before this monument vision, endless windows fly over eternal flames

This walls which endless cross the immensity of the great empire, like sand
Covering the green of the mountains, a black unconquerable world. Condors fly over the throne of the ancestral inca

This language points out the ornaments and the pyramids built in moche
Effigy in the nocturne cults

Hills and valleys guard the sleep of the south emperor
The receiver of the great treasure of the lost kingdom of the Chimor...

Hills and valleys guard the sleep of the south emperor
The receiver of the great treasure of the lost kingdom of the Chimor...

An instant in the world of the forgotten eras
The great warrior runs among the debris of the ruins...
In hours it'll be turned to dust, fiery landscapes never to be seen again

After the fall of the emperor of the south
And the splendid city of monolith towers
Unusual opulence, secular niches, the kingdom of the thin bloody atmosphere

The black sun hides towards the zenith, through the golden camera I see...

The fall black winds...bringing the prophesized ones
Cataclysm and beings wearing Tumi
Are seen walking on the hills
The fields lightened by the primordial stars are being used...

And the plains don't keep the millenary silence
My funeral ritual envelops this vision
And I seek the art to reveal it to the sons of this race

I see shadows of the past in these sacred lands

In this misty valleys, the sons of the sun used to fight
The echo sounds in the mountains of the Andes
The hiss breaks the sacred silence
I see shadows of the past in these sacred lands

And the trumpets in the face of the sun reveal the catastrophe
Eras disappear like hieroglyphs....
Symbols destroyed by time

Invading the city of god
The voice of Manko Capac sounds and his vociferations bring the fast winds which claim revenge!

The voice reappeared in the great kingdom, the pyramid of Kalasaysaya shook
Then came the prophesized apocalypse and the king empire of the sun
Went to the fortifications of the mountains of the moon

And the trumpets in the face of the sun reveal the catastrophe
Eras disappear like hieroglyphs....
Symbols destroyed by time

And the voice reappeared

The flutes became mute forever
The knowledge illuminated the reminiscing inca
Rivers of blood, scary awakening invade the ruins
