Like the winds of remote eras
I see the seven tribes contemplating
The past and the relics of the obscure
Fascination and ecstasy in the silver city

Kronos, dump your antique knowledge
Beyond the lands of the clouds
The gold and bronze shine...
Orichalchum!!

I discovered the sacred hermetic symbols
The codex Troano Naacal, cradle of the third root of the ancient world

Eternal mystery which crosses the distant lands of the sunset
Shine, petrified monuments, superb forgotten statues!!

Born again in the winged hall of Corsabad,
In shape of the absolute throne of the master

Eternal mystery which crosses the distant lands of the sunset
Shine, petrified monuments, superb forgotten statues!!

A king here commands in the name of the God of the winds
The silver sphere illuminates the steps of a traveler who falls in deep
And I visualize an endless field down by a taciturn sadness

Colossal megalithic monument [x4]

You are like statues, cold to the nature wishes
They see the emptiness

I have the ultimate vision
The unusual beauty
Of the vision of the land of the fire

I discovered the sacred hermetic symbols
The codex Troano Naacal, cradle of the third root of the ancient world
Tolteca domain...a shadow in the opaque image of the stars

Tolteca domain...a shadow in the opaque image of the stars
In the golden era of knowledge those which sang odes
Isolated splendours
Giants in the vast shadows mountains
