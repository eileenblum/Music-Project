The herald of darkness applaud the impious divinity
I'm the host of the knowledge's voice
My offer is the roar of the fire
Striking the air with fiery light

She dances while the cold winds sing
Summoned by the Yacarcaes sorcerers
Mighty ascension of the flames, Girra!!
The destructions will come to my enemies

Mighty ascension of the flames, Girra!!

The chamber consumes, the fragile surrender
Forget the sword and the golden shield
Burn the white wings of the ignominy

Contemplating the brandish of the torches
The fire burns the chamber of the pyramid
Oh, wonderful call of the southern stars
