I consecrate the great monument
So far is situated Nimrud Dagh
Marveled by the spirit of the wind,
I scream beside the ruminant unicorn
It reflects my spirit illuminated by the opulence
Seven rays emanate from the triangle's eye
Fulminating me and filling me with knowledge
Clangor of shields fortify my battle

I fix my eyes in millenary monuments
A distant and eternal sunset
The fall of the power of the light
Brings the triumph of the rebel hordes

I'm holding a scepter
And I shout as a titan
Endless storms pour down
The arch opens and across it the fire

And light of the fall pass
My eyes get blackened due to the fiery aurora

On the high plateaus, the mythic ritual begins

This way i asleep the discoveries of this land

On the high plateaus, the mythic ritual begins
The light of the crepuscules, in the Taurus hills
Inscription in the forgotten gravestone
In the volcanic lost valley

Monolith keep the Olmeca cult

Perfection of a constellation
Inside the holes they dance
With the mother of darkness
Cuneiform writing ennobles me, fascinating oracle...
Receptacle of my solitary voice
Enlarge the perennial invocation
The shadow of my cloak covers the stone
The omega of this tribulation
Is the wonderful throne
Of the ancient emperor of Ur

Symbols adorn the faceless God
Temporary is the vision of totems of the clan

Symbols adorn the faceless God
Temporary is the vision of totems of the clan
Dimensional oceans in rebellion
Their black waves collide with the rocks

The wind blows the sand, revealing an obelisk in it
Apis hieroglyphs and tales of the giants epopee
Hermetic diagrams of the cosmos, opulence of the signals

Enigmatic reminiscences of a remote and mighty past
