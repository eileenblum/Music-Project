Oh, King of the stars, the sun, your shine is splendorous
Illuminate Inti, the royal scepter, and the misty of the lake, the crystal universe

Inti, appear in the mountains and in the golden valleys
Serpents reach your feel, the gold is your tear and the Virgins of the sun your immortal brides

Mighty sun, come from your radiant kingdom
Pour down your splendor in the meridian lands
Burn us with the fiery triumphal flame
The scarlet horizon in the end of the world
I raised and summon the spirits of the sacred stone of the sumptuous temple

Oh, King of the stars, the sun, your shine is splendorous
Illuminate Inti, the royal scepter, and the misty of the lake, the crystal universe

Inti, appear in the mountains and in the golden valleys
Serpents reach your feel, the gold is your tear and the Virgins of the sun your immortal brides

Hails, Olija, I contemplate your earthy kingdom
The Wirakocha, I am your eternal serve
In the shadow waters, in the burning fire,
The resplendent shine over me, I venerate the solstice in Coricancha

And dance of the giants
To the glory of the world of the forgotten races
Known as AmairÃ¡

Inti Tutayan yqelluy, Inti Tutayan
[repeat]
