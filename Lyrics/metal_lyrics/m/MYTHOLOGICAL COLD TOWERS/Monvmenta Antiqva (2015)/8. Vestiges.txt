Footsteps erased by the twilight
A desolate warm silence
I still can see signs
Fading before me

Fragments of golden ages
Carved in fallen lintels
Distant, buried, forgotten
Unknown land of dreams

Ruins, solitude of paths
Nostalgia of a golden decadence
A vague fog fades away
Decaying soul, infinite memories

There is a sound coming
Echoing in my soul
A cold prophecy being recited
Fallen dreams

Adorned legends are born in this fog
Fading bridges, silent witnesses
Swept by the wind, roaring in the ruins
The skies witness ascension and fall
