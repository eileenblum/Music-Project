Taking off the sand
I find strange ancient artifacts
Hands that shaped the frescos
Obsolete machine of Antikythera

Posthumous builders
Invisibly manufactured
Shaped in a mysterious matter
Sacred death relic(s)

Destruction of wisdom
Devastation of the unspeakable
On this mysterious land
Worshipping the dust

Find the code to decipher
The unreal and strange instrument
Amulet of the hateful
Disturbing creation

Through strange artifacts
I can see the past emerge
Like a dark dream
In shades of copper
Of strange artifacts

In this endless desert
These arid plains
Where death enchants us
