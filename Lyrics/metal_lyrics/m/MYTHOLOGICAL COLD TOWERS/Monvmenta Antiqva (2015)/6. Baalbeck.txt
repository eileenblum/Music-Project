Cyclopic ruins consecrated for the thunder
Dark holy stones under the sign of Venus
The temple of Jupiter Helios interrupted negligence

In the temple of Bacchus Debris
Magnanimous trilithon timeless colossus
Reflection of the sun forgotten illydium
A forgotten temple gathers our spirits without faces
carved in stones

A tomorrow lost among stones now fallen, dead
arcane labyrinth that is the legendary city
Wilderness of a dream Baalbeck
Frightening living blocks vestiges of grandiosity

Royal path still unwalked
Vast solitude unfathomable mystery
Like the stars that wandered here
A forgotten temple gathers our spirits without faces
carved in stones
A tomorrow lost among stones now fallen, dead
kings like Nimrod under Baal-Astarte lar
Erected their eternal deity

Shining guardian pride of ancient times
With horns on the moon a symbol of power

Cosmic region on earth
Outshined, death hidden

Altar of blood of primitive deaths
Nobody has seen the silent fall
