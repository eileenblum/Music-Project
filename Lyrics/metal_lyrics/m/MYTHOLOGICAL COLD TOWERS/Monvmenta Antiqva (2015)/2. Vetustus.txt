Oh, behold the encrusted laurels
In glorious fronts intangible holy Aristocracies
Mythography exposed to the mortals to delight my eyes
Dark hidden reasons, a wandering labyrinthine journey

When in the heights of the pediments, bleed the memories of 
strains
A cold fea descends the pillars, an endless fareweel by the
horizon
When rocks and fire are forged in blocks
stone voluptuousness, ancient maryrdom

A repose with death, an unleashed light
Twilight of the myths, thou art so
glaring memories, sound the trumpets
they cease, the end

The scent of the halls
of the secrets
Nostalgia and distance
Immortal remembrances

Primeval altar
Where are you ancient skies?
Falling stars
All the lost glory
