These beings, solar breed
Demetrius and the iranian kings
Priests of blood and spirit
Abolishers of new laws
Quencheps of knlowledge

With tragic splendour
Solar motive buried for centuries
Inscrutability of visions
Sand relics
Masks of dead faces

Golden tears incursted in chalices
Fabulous secrets pale beyond the twilight
Searching for sinister jewels, cursed rings
from forgotten kings
Cursed pillage sand relics

The sands hide
The shine of golden ages
Lost knowledge
A sleeping past

Opaque relics
Now a lost treasure
Curse for the violators
Curse...
