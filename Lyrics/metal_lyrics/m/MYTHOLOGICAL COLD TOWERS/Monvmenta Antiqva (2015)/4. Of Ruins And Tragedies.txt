Dreams will collide with the tragic sunrise
Thrones above cloudy skies horizons gleam

Wandering under the sun ancient kings beyond the seas
Visitors from the realms above

Legends perishing on the sands they say lions guard their
sleep doomed slaves... Souls soaked in tears

Suffering is present a restless mourning
The garden of afflictions an enlightened weeping

So sad is the way down in the lands of silence
Ancient immortal verses long forgottenworshipped in
processions

Mourning of legends buried by the sand
Moruning of legends buried by the sand

Suffering is present a restless mourning
Suffering is present a restless mourning

A storm of dark memories a supplication for forgiveness
and curses
A loud cry of pain sons of...

Chant of despair
Chant of pain
Chant of cold
Chant of rain
