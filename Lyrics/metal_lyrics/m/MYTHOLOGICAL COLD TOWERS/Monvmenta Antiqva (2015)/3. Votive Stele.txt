The fog of longing bleeds
on the friezes and white stairs
Silent steps behind and Atlantean shadow

Fragments of light and honor a mirror reflecting
Infinite beauty give me the absolute silence
of broken and fallen statues

Votive landscapes of crowns and laurels
White and golden shadows
Beautifully sculpted columns
Erected for the solar triumph

The erect stone, alive lithophane
On the unreal trails of the myth
In the center of the intaglio
The last days of the empire are told

Indecipherable stele
Tells the fall of the suns
Immaculate kings
Divine dynasties

The odd stele reveals orders and oaths
Fateful dates infinite strives

Show me your ruin god-king Anunnaki
Show what what was written
Votive stele
