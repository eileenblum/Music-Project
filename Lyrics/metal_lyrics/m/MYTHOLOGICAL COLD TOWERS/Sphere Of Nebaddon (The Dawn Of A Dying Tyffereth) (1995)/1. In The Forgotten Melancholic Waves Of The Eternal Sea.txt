As the leaves of a autumn end
The winter has envolved then
In it's cold sensibleness
The dreams were envolved
By the last breath of the contempt

In awaked darkness of a forest
The paleness of the illusions
Then absorved my essence
In the sepulchral forms of the forms
We fall a sleep
Envolved by the death

A dark day left on my life
My tears to it
In the solitary caves, in the silent camps
In the forgotten melancholic waves of the eternal sea
In a dark day of the existency...
