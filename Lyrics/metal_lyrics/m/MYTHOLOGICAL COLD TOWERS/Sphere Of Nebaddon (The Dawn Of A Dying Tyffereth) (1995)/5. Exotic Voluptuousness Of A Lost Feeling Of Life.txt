Oppressed sadness in the eyes prison
A agonizing manifestation
Repressed feelings, emerged
Rough happenings covers an atmosphere
"That mix to depressive wishes"

The discontentment open their wings
Sheafs drags a grand voluptuousness
The morbid voluptuousness of death
Characterizes the lost feeling of life

There are bridges leading to nothing
There is the nothing waiting for the bruises

Commotions forms layers of emotions
Desolated emotions
Like an only candle in the darkness
The brutal darkness absorbs the hope
Of a sentimental universe
