Deeply the sadness invades
Standing out with himself the isolated
His benevolence expresses the darkness
The darkness of the forgotten souls
His tunic suggests the depressive friendship
The black, the black depressive friendship

The invalidity of the decaying pleasure
The beauty exhales the last contrast
Brutal despairs hallucinates the extreme animation
The furor of death is challenged by the existent

And aloneside this desolated glory
The ascension of the silence suddenly stands
The inquietude dominates the impulse of the shadows
"the shadows of the sad depressive tears"

The ascention of the silence suddenly stands
And aloneside this desolated glory...
The shadows of the sad depressive tears...
And aloneside this desolated glory...
The ascention of the silence...
The shadows of the sad depressive tears...
The silence suddenly stands...
