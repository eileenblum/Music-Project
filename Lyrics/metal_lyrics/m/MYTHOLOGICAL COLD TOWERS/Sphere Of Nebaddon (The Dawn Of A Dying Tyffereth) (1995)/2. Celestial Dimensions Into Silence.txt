Celestial dimensions to be reached
I see abandoned, waiting...
On your Quietness, rest the harmony
A dead harmony, but who one day "Feels Life"

When more distant I am
More I can judge the celestial despair
You are art of dreams that materialize
By pale faces, make me feel myself
Your words like a passion...That's over
And ever will be making
To me
The Ethereal Emptiness
Above a live harmony, Who feels...
Finally I see
And meet them...

Finally I see
And meet them...
Celestial Dimensions into silence
