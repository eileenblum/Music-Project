My body lies
Covered in blood,
Surrounded by grief...
Hear the swords clashing,
Warriors screaming!
My soul is trespassing
Into the realm of Death!

My last breath, my life ends!

Nothing is the pain;
Nothing is your life!
You are but a whore!
Worm,
You surely will die!

My last breath, my life ends!

I remember the battle that I have fought and lost;
The swords and the wounds on my back...
I gasped in pain without feeling in my legs!
I know my time is approaching the end...
Blue is now red, and white turns to grey...
And now I'm breathing with one foot in the grave!

I've paid with my life!

My body lies
Covered in blood,
Surrounded by grief...
Hear the swords clashing;
Surrounded by shadows and pain!
Surrounded by death and grief!

My last breath, my life ends...
