Deep in the shadow
Of utter darkness
A figure awaits in silence...

Rising from the pit of hate
Towards the bloodred sky
His mighty strength
Is overwhelming them...

Soaked in blood--
Infamous butchery,
They watch in tears;
Their god is draining!

I drank his blood!
His deeper wounds--
My immortality, his agony!

I have sipped the blood of christ!

Bastard, liar, fake--
Healer of the evil minds--
Bastard, fake, liar--
I laugh as you die!!!

I have sipped the blood of christ!

Soaked in blood--
Infamous butchery,
They watch in tears;
Their god is draining!

I drank his blood!
His deeper wounds--
My immortality, his agony!
