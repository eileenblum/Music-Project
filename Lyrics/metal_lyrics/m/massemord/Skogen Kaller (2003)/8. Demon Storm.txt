My eyes are bleeding!
The blood is pouring on the floor!
Unbeliever:
Do you really think that man is your god?

I have seen you crying.
I have seen you gasping in pain.
I have seen you lying
Upon the altar of the horned god!
You are my victim,
Another prey from the temple of god!
I'm not a liar!
I'm not a man, and I'm not a god!

It's a Demon Storm!
Follow your lord...
In the deep of the Demon Storm!
