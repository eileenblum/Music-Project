You have never been so great
As your unsinned creator
All the time you all were under the doom of your faith
And under the hoof of the only malfeitor

But now the skies are keeping dead silence
There is no sound except ravens cry

Dust and void in empty paradise
Painted in colors of sepia
Dust and void in empty paradise
Nothing can save of the god killing pandemia

Lizards and snakes are keeping the throne
Of empty and forsaken heaven
And even horned lord has died somewhere there
Deconstructed now and forever

Dust and void in empty paradise
Painted in colors of sepia
Dust and void in empty paradise
Nothing can save of the god killing pandemia
The heaven and hell are gone in a darkness of ages
