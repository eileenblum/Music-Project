again and again, beyond every 'again'
I desire to despise wisdom falsing
and thirst for defining virtues universal
escaping from gibbering 'cause in the black hole
an element of authentic substance smoulders
artificially placed within
this remnant is worthy of ignorance
for words and emotions that steal my oxygene
of abysmal arrogance
as an act of revenge for sentence of necessity
your falling into apple of my eye
thus I answer: I shall pay every price
so as to wallow in a bile
and throw my thunders of derision
in similar madness
I reject the idea of answers
so as to cut off perversely
mould of your existence
within life of mine
because horror prays on breath unpredicted
insane senses and emptiness devoured from reasons
for I am everyone
baptised by water of compulsion
of ordering world in signs
and defining the time present
for the first time however
running amok distant became
yet scalpel of curses in torments of neurons
still depicts the depths of hell
satiated graves and gallows crooked under weight of their own
night of today which may become
the night of your lives
winter of mine

I am each and everyone
baptised by anonymity
I am each and everyone
I terrify!
