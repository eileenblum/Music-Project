staring at this depths
enlivens a cold flesh
that only chemicals &amp; embers
are able to stimulate to rot
inside volcano full of lava
of prejudices and disgust
hotter than the core of the earth
this hour opens the gates of hell
gives life taking life away.
heresy complete!
wringing blood out
from wounds of christ
and divine tears of anticlimax
stronger than hammering of sin
crucifies salvation with oblivion
i am reborning within
drowning in this shadow
whose presence
reveals the path of perdition
regardless to the whims
of my mercy.

in this definite euphoria
of negativism
i am burning to burn again
i am alive again!
