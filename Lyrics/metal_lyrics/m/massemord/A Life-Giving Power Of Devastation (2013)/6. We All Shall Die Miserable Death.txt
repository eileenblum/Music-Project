I smell the same sweat of fears
bewitched before night
of holding life tightly
with simultaneous pledge
that soul is bursting
and eager to wander towards stars
this painful awareness
cannot be neutralized
neither by faith in trees
nor in a whiteness of snow
even nor by epic of blasphemy
towards whole world beyond world of mine
every single dawn crushes me harder
intoxicates with smell of the ground
the returns are more and more distant
so as the conciousness where we had come from
and bile of envy and malignancy furthermore
neurotic displeasure with lack of influence
on decisions taken by seven milliards
of egocentric constellations
poison maliciously every single cell

even the ultimate disaster that is drawing nearer
provides me pleasure any more
wakes up demons of yours
while I filled hell with devils of other kind:
with emptiness left after all I had become intimate with!
we are sickening together and together
we shall die miserable death
decorating agony with brocade of mysteries
praying over soulless common matter
that decided about quality of our journey to the ground
without raw knees and conviction of a mission
of dragging suffering on our back
impiously we are losing the beauty
and everything righteous left within us
we are abandoning in filth every single virtue
in a void of damnation, so as today
we shall be only wasting them still...

upright into the ground we shall be absorbed
regreting the only sin
that blade is still too clean...
