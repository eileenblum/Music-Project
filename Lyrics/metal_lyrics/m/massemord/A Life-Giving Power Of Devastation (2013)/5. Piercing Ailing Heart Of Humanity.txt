insolently, rudely and without submissiveness
despising charities of remains of lust
with knees by prayers unharmed
and without heads inclined
the ends we demand
yet not in impotence
but in rapture of malediction
we're opening gates of our souls
to the demons of all kinds
within embrace of the night new, inhuman life
twilight of human pseudo-dignity
a dim stains smothering dreams
feebleness and the greatest potency
of tormenting all biographies
shameful so far animal call
deadened by utopia of free will
shall mean more by milliards of expectations
voice of the reason by divinity rotten
shall take a form of a spear
piercing ailing heart
of few thousand years of humanism
and pile of victims and golden thoughts
a burden of regret and remorse
because of unpicked blossom
blood and sperm unshed finally
within seconds human tears shall lose its depth
and all flowers of wisdom and abstract thinking
shall feed the flames of affection
infidelity clothed in tunic of desires
will poison the future
and the most beautiful memories
because plundered must be all
insolently, rudely and without submissiveness
plundered must be all...
