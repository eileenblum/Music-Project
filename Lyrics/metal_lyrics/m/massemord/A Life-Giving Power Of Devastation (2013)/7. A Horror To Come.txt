For I am a fratricide
When bonds of blood are joyless desires
Or rather a whining of tears shed
And moments of oblivion
When persistance gains features divine
Or clenched fists dignified in blood
Crimes commited but for splinter of penalties
And attachment to achievements and properties
I am not the one but exclusivity I demand
For I am your enemy if you are worthy
Of homage paid to volatile visions
Bastards spawned in hiding
Whose provenance embarassingly unveils
A lust of superpower
And lust to control at least one fate!
And if they are not ignoble enough
Then for insolence of delusions
Where hellfires and the damned
And all demons from five sides of the earth
Support to overthrow something
There is no more place in the universe for
You are closer to victims
And narcotic nonsenses
Execrated just by yourself!
For I am the mocker
When you poison the silence with words
That while meaning nothing
Embrace with despair and anger
Stronger than rags of affection
Of villainy against humanity
When you mutilate the serenity of thoughts lost
By wasted exhalation
Providing same dryness
As dried holy flesh upon the piece of wood

For the first and last time
I shall throw this stone
And my shadow shall become
The grievance and the answer.
