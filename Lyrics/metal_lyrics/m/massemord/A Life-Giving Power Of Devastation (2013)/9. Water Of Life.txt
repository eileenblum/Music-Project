in the glare of a sin
I am the lord of the deepest circle of hell
greedy womb stuffed with scraps of frustration
for those who had sworn too early their fidelity
without taste but the taste itself
in the smoke of dying
resistance against ignorance
poisoned with hideous conviction
of injustice of flames,
loss of my own and withered days that have passed
which thorns are my crown here and now
leaving behind a quintessence
of this schizophrenia
...loss of my own is my crown here and now...
within anonymous mediocrity
a whim of contradictions of striking blindfolded
in desperate and forced defence of living
meanwhile within grey depths
aftermath of fierce fires
of which life-giving power of devastation
I atoned with chemical blood
and oppressing the saviour
with grimace of anger attempting to pierce my skin
and announce to the world:

ever and for ever
the curse and water of life
wasting, faith in despair
and loyalty to NONE!
