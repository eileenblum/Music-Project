immensity of glances at distorted fingers
precisely drawling every scream with concern
murderous words and strictly essential
for to fill a black whole of hearts of a few
with stench of lust once
now with spikes of egoism
I'm piercing all of these eyes
worthy of those marble wounds
villainy carved in paper
human words against divinity
and against notions to fall
countless enormous spaces
aquired before by thoughts
perhaps written, trivial, repeated
with difficulties I overcome
and with greater effort
I compose them in few known signs
albeit I didn't want to get to know
anything at all throughout my whole life
sufficent was the acid that anaesthetizes
absolves and puts me to sleep within horror
where even though I am the sun
I am capable of heating only other stars
yet by rays of frost I'm craving to slaughter my own galaxy!

how odd to you is the taste of this opium!

while wisdom is completed with uncertainty
yet not inborn and fed with anger
but with bitterness that accompanies
falling of every temple
the falling of meaning above all
therefore thick emptiness beyond first exhalation
that should feed with hunger and answers not to come
so as to absence of values of values deprive
and make comprehension a trophy of mine
trophy of wasted breath.
