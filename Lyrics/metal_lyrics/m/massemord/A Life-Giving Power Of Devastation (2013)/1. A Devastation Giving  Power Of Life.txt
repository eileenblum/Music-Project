like an ancient curse of heavens
drowning litanies of endless pleading
in the grace of life
greasy pitch filling blackness of my firmament
flooding rotten fruit of your benevolence
carved on your faces with chisel

and cruel in equality
burying hearts which neither potency
to righteousness nor infamous deeds
cannot change their nature of meat
nor destiny of being fertilizer
for another human larva!
then admiration for heroic denial
carrying in right hand a mace of despair
despite morbid fascination
within walls of disability turns into jealousy
blasphemous consumption
and transcendental hallucinations
unworthy of heart beating become
the furious flames are dancing high
yet deathlike frost around
a fierce thirst is oppressing still
though we've been drinking from wells of many
in ashes and shadows we straighten up
devastating through creating not!
clasping handful of soil
into the abyss ready to plunge ourselves with
this hour opens the gates of hell
gives life taking life away
the furious flames are dancing high
yet deathlike frost around
a fierce thirst is oppressing still
although we've been drinking from wells of many
in ashes and shadows we straighten up
devastating through creating not...
