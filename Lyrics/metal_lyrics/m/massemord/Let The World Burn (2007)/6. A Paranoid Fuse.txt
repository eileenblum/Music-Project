There's no difference between my fury
and cold neurotic inhuman calculation
Silence congealed within my ventricles
and scream of fire that I speak through
Scream of fire I teach by
Because I am

So I destroy temple, you've been building with your brother
living for neighbour in gratitude for death
And by silent whisper I stir up the torment
because world is burning bloodred in my eyes for so long

I despise your sacrifice of life
Because you have never had anything
Anything won't be given to you any more

And in my madness and my tranquility
in blood and in tears I may destroy sweet dream
By thought, by act, by word and by flesh
without words and sounds, without pictures and faces

So that life has no context
so that I could exist still

I despise your sacrifice of life
Because you have never had anything
Die because of me
So that anything won't be given to you any more

This coldness of thoughts and passion of madness
upon closed eyelids paints a death portrait
With echo of million burning faces
the purest and eternal is my voice of choice

It always shall be me
