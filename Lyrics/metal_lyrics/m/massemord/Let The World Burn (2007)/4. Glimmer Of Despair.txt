And I saw, that path filthy with your dream
reaches the end where I gaze today
And skies propped up by gallows and stakes
by lightnings of blood crack bones and trees

I teach by despair and unfinished life
burning with anger with no tomorrow

I'm timing by ticking of your hang son's flesh
your brother's beheading horror
by blood and sperm in a womb of your daughter
I'm constructing tomorrow
Because I've chosen madness to see death
devouring your flesh in charming contempt
as swallows your eyes and robs you from virtues
to stand and behold and live through your pain

I w ogniu stanie twÃ³j dom

But I am able to cut off the breast
which have been feeding myself

You cannot see how bile is flowing
from clefts of social life
As sweat and screams are stinking at home
beneath stars a mustiness of values

W pÂ³omieniach stanie twÃ³j dom

You handle patiently pain of leprosy
though wounds are bursting with pus
Which into lava changes you breath
and pulls a curtain of indignity

Since now (as ever) only I will matter
and Iâll reject everything in flames
Smile of not mine I'd drive into despair
and distress Iâll gag by a painful scream

Through tenderness of violence and love of the rape
I will perfect you flesh
With throat wide opened Iâll extol a peace
Peace of burning world

Slime is merging into stench of you
a larvae has grown to become your heart
The end is so near the end I will make
your future so close future I will destroy

Through tenderness of violence and love of the rape
I will perfect you flesh
With throat wide opened I will extol a peace
peace of burning banners of man

I will always see the last breath of life
of faces so far untouched by flames
I will be always seeking your eyesight
in spasms of fear when you naked become

And the future with purulent tongue
won't tell you anything
Beyond smoke of horizons and smoke of your house

Through tenderness of violence and love of the rape
I will perfect you flesh
With throat wide opened I will extol a peace
peace of burning world

Slime is merging into stench of you
a larvae has grown to become your heart
The end is so near the end I will make
your future so close future I will destroy

End I create
Future I destroy
