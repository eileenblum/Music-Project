To force you to believe, to make you a follower
To degrade yourself, to eat your own shit
Create the end that shall lead us further
Than blood and bones could ever make

Behold, a murderer so deep
Never posing question how much pain you can give
Not pure enough to breathe through blood
By sperm to spawn not only a life

Ignite
Reach the core
And do not spare mercy

Destroy tomorrow submitting to lust
That doomed your kind with first word spoken
As future collapses the current day
Only casualties are yet to be born
Weâll breed some more

Decline the enemy
Restraining your will
And guide a torch
Through harm of the innocent men

We will set the world afire
Crushing all worth of contempt

With swarm of locust spit in the air
We sow a decay igniting the fuse
That will set this world afire
Crushing all worth of contempt
Let the world burn!

You will never understand
Those who did are already hung
We stand in the queue

Instead of churches we claim
To burn delivery wards
