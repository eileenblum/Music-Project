The Light of eternal stars
Burning my eyes and torturing my soul
I'm entering into eternity
Curse the God of no hope

Damn you! Burn your wings of slavery!
Dissolving into the cosmic chaos return to the nothing

Red vines of ruptured veins
Will not sprout as a new triumph of strife
I spill blood into the face of death
Curse the God of no life

Falling into the abyss of nightmares
Closer and closer to the timelessness
I feel them, under my skin
The Light is fading; this is the end of my life

Night falls, the time has come
I'm drinking your soul from a chalice skull

Kneel before the master of shadows!
Gestures rise from his knees
Worthy to stay before his black throne
Clock strikes midnight, the time goes to dawn

Winds of the abyss
Aching my bones, torturing my soul
I'm entering into eternity
Curse the God of no hope

Falling into the depth of self torture
Light is fading; this is the end of my life
