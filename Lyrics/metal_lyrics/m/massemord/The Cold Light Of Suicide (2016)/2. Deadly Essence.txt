Streams of bright light cut between my fingers
Breath of emptiness flowing through my hair

Waiting on the other side of timelessness
Waiting on the other side of cosmic winds
Waiting on the other side of nothingness
Come to me my fallen soul, heal my wounds

Dissolving in voids of the universe
Becoming dust in the abyss of chaos
I'm waiting for redemption or eternal peace
I want to rest in peace

Rest in peace!

Extinguished stars in the sky
And all are painted red

Waiting on the other side of timelessness
Waiting on the other side of cosmic winds
Waiting on the other side of nothingness
Come to me my fallen soul, heal my wounds

And once again through the twilight
The sun has gone into other worlds

Once again, this is where it begins

Waiting on the other side of timelessness
