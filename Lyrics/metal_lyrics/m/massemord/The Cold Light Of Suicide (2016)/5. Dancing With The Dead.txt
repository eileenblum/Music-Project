This world has changed, from beautiful colors into rust and dust.
Whatever happens... I know that death is always near.
Dance! Dance with me..
Dance beside me..
Dance with the dead..
Dance with no fear.

I go to the place of nothingness
Where suffering ends
And the emptiness seals each fate.

That's the hour of our parting existence,
Flowers born within the mound of the loose ground
As the petals dance last for an eternity

Dance! Dance with me..
Dance beside me..
Dance with the dead..
Dance with no fear.
