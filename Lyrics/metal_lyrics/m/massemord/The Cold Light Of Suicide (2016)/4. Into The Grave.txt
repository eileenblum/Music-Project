Rain drops on the earths soil
Messengers of grief hiding in their nest
I cannot hear any sound
Only the noise of rain drops

See you all in hell! Beyond the grave
I'll see you all in grey realm of silence

The shadows of those who no longer exist
Wandering along the bottom of the cold river

See you all in hell! Beyond the grave
I'll see you all in grey realm of silence and abyss

See you all in hell! Beyound the grave
I'll see you all in grey realm of silence

I gather my concentration within my mind and in eternal piece.
The millennium rushing past my soul, but time is nothing

See you all in hell! Beyound the grave
I'll see you all in grey realm of silence and abyss
