yes wide open, watching the cold skies
throwing hand in hand, merging with the plasma flow

There was nothing, except the lifeless within darkness
Time ran like sand and centuries flowed like water

Black wings of cold eternity hovering over the sleeping world
Mind lost in the fog of oblivion burns in black tar madness

One more dose and the gates of hell will open wide
But now, thousands of ugly creatures tearing at my flesh piece by piece

Lifeless existence!

There was nothing, except the lifeless within darkness
Time ran like sand and centuries flowed like water

Eyes wide open, watching in cold skies
I lay on the ground, with my arms stretched out, but I am no longer here
