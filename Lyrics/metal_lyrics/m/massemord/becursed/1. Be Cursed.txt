Be cursed his image and name
Got burnt into ashes a book of insane
A sword of revenge is sharpened well
For sacred and scapeless godslay

Oh bless me my Lord for this dangerous quest
And let me set fire of my unholy protest

I saw the master of shadows
And demons were calling my name

Be cursed his image and name
Got burnt into the black flame

Oh I saw the great Creator
And angels were cursing my name

There is no heaven
There is no life after the fire of redemption
There is no God
There is no sanctity
Curse them! Crucify their idols!
There was nothing on the other side of emptiness.
Just a cold and dark nowhere
