Who will answer me? Where my country?
In stability or in shit?
On what now it?

Where dawn of our ideas?
Where the Jewish villain is concealed?

Who will answer me? Where my country?
In stability or in shit?
On what now it?

I believe that scarlet dawn will come once.
And our mean enemy will be prostrate.
And our free spirit will rise as before again.

And to the death, to the latest last breath,
to the death, until the last second the existence
I will heat this hope in the heart.

Barren â All instruments
Aeternus â Drums
