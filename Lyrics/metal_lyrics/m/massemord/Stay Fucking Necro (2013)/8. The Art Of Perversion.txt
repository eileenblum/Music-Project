Evil inside your putrid brain
Is piercing slowly feel the pain
The dead awaken from their sleep
To tear out pieces of his heart
Body eaten soul torn apart
Internal organs mutilated rotting flesh
Desecration of the holy son of god
Hung and nailed
Collapsed lungs... suffocate!
Destroy the remains of Jesus Christ
Into damnation - deprived of his life
Glory deceased - suffer in dismay
2000 years of abomination
Your soul is swallowed by humiliation
Unsilent massacre
Sacriligious torment
The art of perversion
Fires of depravity - burn all your lies
Agony - Christ will rot
Ready to feast on the corpse
Lord of the flies we defy
Obliterate the trinity
False messiah in despair
We'll triumph in blasphemy!
Lord of the flies we defy
Obliterate the trinity
False messiah in despair
We'll triumph in blasphemy!
Destroying his sacrament
The feeble Christ I will deny!!!
