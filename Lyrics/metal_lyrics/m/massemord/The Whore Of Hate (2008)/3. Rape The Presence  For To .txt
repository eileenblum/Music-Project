iâm shattering the hours of belief
'cause not through but by death i want to breathe
and by glowing metal upon my skin
i'm drawing the only true path
i'm yearning
i hear the voice of mine, but i will roar the voice down
when in deepest devotion my flesh
a flame or a knife becomes
when my flesh in deepest humility
with arms wide open a dagger in my entrails hosts

when you speak through me
do not spare no-one
do not spare me

let the madness speak today by embers
and let fists tremble in convulsions
while fire is burning out my eyes
and iâm bleeding with smoke
stench of molten skin and fear

i have created the nightmare, for its fangs
i'll hang children of mine and sell my own friends
for these shallow gasps when i tear my face off
when my robes are torn apart by filth of damp soil
from which i have grown and owing to you i've returned to

let the madness speak today by ice
(and in veins clotted blood pull down
livid lips and eyes behind the fog
shall let you live anyway)

i have created the nightmare for to curse it for nine times
and its steel claws plunged into universe
dead body opens its mouth today and the purulent tongue speaks
with the voice of madman tied in chains
though this yelp soundless remains

so let the madness speak
so let the madness speak
but always let the madness speak through me

and do not spare no-one
do not spare me
