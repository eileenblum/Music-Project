let the stars tremble and let the earth in convulsions toss
let the decay-eaten foundation of the world open wide its thighs
for the seas, the forests, the mountains and the human dreams
crash into heart of the earth
which not by lava but with hatred of one man was filled
within this womb a stench of abortion
in this very moment, all fires of wars and cataclysms
all spilled blood of every crime and human suffering
all rapes of mothers, daughters, sisters and wives
with resounding thunder of scream lasting for few thousand years time
bow before me
for to give you or not the alms of tomorrow
with a single motion of my thumb

i do not know myself neither i recognize my voice
i listen to words i didn't mean to speak
i see the motion, not the intention
i see the blood not feeling the pulse

waking up to life stabbing out a cigarette upon my genitals
with claws through throat extorting my liver
disfiguring my face and shattering my flesh
(for my own, silent, anonymous harm)

i scare to open my sweat-flooded eyes
to tear my hand off from my molten skin
hear a gust of fury
and into her womb plunge a glowing crowbar
until that whore spit with sparks

once again in revenge i shall burn down her entrails
i shall hurt, humiliate and disfigure her
for the passionate kiss of pain would taste better than ever
i am yours
i am yours with crime in my hands
