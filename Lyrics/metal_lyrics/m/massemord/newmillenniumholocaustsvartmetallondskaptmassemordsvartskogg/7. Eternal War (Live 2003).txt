[performed by Massemord]Eternal War!!!
In an ancient kingdom of madness,
Far beyond the false light...
Beneath a starless sky,
In an astral dimension,
The scourge of war soon will be reborn
And fall upon your feeble souls!
Betrayers of an endless damnation
Their fate will drown their lives in darkness!

Eternal War!!!

On the frozen battleground
Victorious stand the forces of the dark!
Dead shadows upon the earth,
Abducted minds,
Blind illusions of peace
Swallowed by the Dark Abyss
Their silent cries now echo in the night!
Eternal War!!!
