[performed by Massemord]The nail is piercing my skin
The hatred I feel
Is now my lethal weapon
To sacrifice myself
My life is over
I commit suicide!
I don't belong to this race
I don't belong to this world
I'm a chosen hero
From a chosen race
My life is over
I commit suicide!
I want to die! I want to disappear from the world
I want to die! I want to disappear from
The fucking world
Once I've looked deep into the nightsky
And the truth got revealed to me
I've seen soldiers marching
Toward the final victory
They were immortal soldiers of death
The nail is piercing my skin
The hatred I feel
Is now my lethal weapon
To sacrifice myself
My life is over
I commit suicide!
I don't belong to this race
I don't belong to this world
I'm a chosen hero
From a chosen race
My life is over
I commit suicide!
