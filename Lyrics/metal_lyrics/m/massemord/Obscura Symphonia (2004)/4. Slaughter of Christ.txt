Side by side we ride against the hordes of christ! 
We rise from our graves... to annihilate! 
Rippers of flesh... internal delirium 
Destroyers of hopes; 
Demonized! 
Thousand years will pass again but terror never ends 
IN AETERNUM IN TRIUMPHO 
TENEBRARUM 
Slaughter of christ 
Thorns in his eyes 
Death to the weakling 
Wealth to the strong! 
Time will pass and we wait 
'til we'll slaughter and nail him 
again and again... 
Your crucified saviour now cries in despair 
We'll torment his soul 'til his death: 
NAIL HIM! NAIL HIM!
