You created SATAN to blame him for your sins... 
Fall to your knees, impoten mad redeemer! 
I breed hate-- my soul is drenched with blood! 
I breed hate and evil takes control! 
No stifling dogma shall dim my thoughts! 
No more falsehood shall be truth to me! 
I spit in the eye of your weakling jehova! 
I refuse to serve your putrid will 
I refuse obedience to your lies 
I refuse to be the slave of god 
I refuse to serve the bastard son 
I'm the plage-- I'll spread my seeds of hate! 
You shall flee and never find your peace... 
Slaves of christ, obey his fucking lies... 
Slaves of christ, there's no paradise!
