Burn what he once created; flames 
swallow your deceptions! 
Drown in the whirlwinds of fire, 
abomination; I want your cremation! 
I'm the son of torture! 
I'm everything you despise! 
I'll destroy your kingdom of lies! 
I'll see you suffer before my eyes! 
Now hell is on the earth... Beware... 
a Satanic rebirth! 
Pain, chains around your neck, 
crucified by your holy faith... 
House of god: human lives erased... 
son of god eternally condemned 
From the ashes of these cursed liars 
SATAN rise among your true believers! 
Burning the church! Burning the house of god!
