Under the banner of our gods
We ravage this land of heresy.
In the name of the Aesirs we are chosed
To fight this invading christianity.

Under the banner of might
We mock their religion of submission.
They may pray to their selfish god
But we'll never give them remission.

Under the banner of the elders
We march towards them in despise.
We are the sons of Midgaard
Bound to defy their glorious lies.
