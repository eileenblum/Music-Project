We the kingdom's best men
Proudly walk the fields,
The forests and the mountains
Ready to defend it with our steel.

We march towards the battlefield,
With hate in our eyes we march.

Knighted men we all are.
Let the enemies fall for my hand.
We shall crush all resistance
And once honour our land.

We are the royal force
Dubbed with the power of steel.
Protected by the wizard's spell
Forcing every enemy to kneel.

When our swords has sung
The battle's last tone,
Only one side shall stand.
On the bloody battlefield we'll stand alone.
