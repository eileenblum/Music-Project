Troops at attention in shining armour
They stand before me in total loyalty.
Raising their fists into the air
And swearing their allegiance to me.

Upon a stallion of finest blood
I sit with the greatest of pride.
As I behold my vast empire
I hold the royal standard high.
It dances in the roaring wind
As the salutes are heard in the sky.

The foretold master I am.
My future is already revealed
In the scrolls of the prophecy:
"...And he shall conquer the world
And rule it with great majesty."

Hail me as the man of steel.
Hail me as the son of gods.
Hail me as the king of yours.
I am the chosen one.

We are the undefeatable
So be proud of what you are.
Against the threats of the world
We stand united today.
Let's not take their mocking,
Let's invade and make them obey.
