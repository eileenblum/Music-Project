The mountains and forests is his fortress
The primeval starfilled nightsky his roof.
He is the king of the forgotten realm
Ruling with a power unknown.

The mightiest of elvenkings
Who dwells in the lands far away.
Far away where the rainbow ends
And ancient gods still are hailed.

A face torn by time
His cloak old and grey.
Leading his people with the greatest wisdom.
Learned from the old days until today.

He is the king of the distant forest.
He is the king of the distant forest.

The tales we are told
Is their only known reality.
They have lived in solitude and will do so
For all of eternity
