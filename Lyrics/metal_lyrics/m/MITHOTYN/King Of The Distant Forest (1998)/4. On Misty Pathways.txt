I walk on misty pathways.
Where my journey leads I do not know.
I just follow my inner voice.
Longer and longer on misty pathways I go.

I travel into an unknown vale.
Through forests over hills and far away.

the chilly breezes of night surrounds me
With their smooth gentle touches.
the fog hides the path
Which I walk upon.

Voices I hear from inside the dark
And dusky the night have laid.
Observed by the forgotten shadowpeople I am
As I wander through their realm.

The silvery cold moon looks upon me.
As I strive through these spellbound forests.
