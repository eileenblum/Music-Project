The peace has been broken.
My brothers has all fallen
By treacherous mens betrayal.
Their blood painted the plains red.
I swear this act will be their last
I'll see that the wolf will be fed.

On a mission
Behind enemy lines I am.
My heart pounds
With anger and with hate,
As I ride with their souls at my side.
Heading towards my glorious fate.

Back to you domains I return
With bloodshed in my mind.
Come forth you treacherous foe,
Test my steel and death you'll find.

I've carved runes into my horn
And painted them with my blood.
I raised up to the sky
And proposed a toast to my brothers
Who now fight on the vast plains
Outside of Valhalla.
