The frost comes, hand in hand with dawn.
It turnes all lakes into mirrows,
reflecting the moon.

Freezing storms of snow,
come let me feel your purity.
Freezing storms of snow,
may you whine herefor eternity.

As I walk throng the frostbitten forests
I get enchanted by the harshness,
alive by the chill and allmighty
by my solitariness.

There is not a more
as far as the eye can see.
Frej, god of seasons!
Let this forever be.

In this desolated land I am everything.

Freezing storms of snow,
come let me feel your purity.
Freezing storms of snow,
may you whine herefor eternity.

Let me be enchanted by the harshness,
alive by the chill and allmighty,
by my solitariness.

In this desolated land I am everything.
