The moons pale light falls over the trees,
and they cast their black shadows
over the snowcovered heaths.

Behold this land, embraced by frost.
Life and fertillity, forgotten and lost.

A mirrow of ice upon the lake.
I praise this land of ice and snow.
Snowstorms whining among the trees.
I praise this land where freezing winds do blow.

Fallen snowflakes in the starlight,
lies silently and still.
A lonely wolf barks in the winternight.

Behold this land, embraced by frost.
Life and fertillity, forgotten and lost.

A mirrow of ice upon the lake.
I praise this land of ice and snow.
Snowstorms whining among the trees.
I praise this land where freezing winds do blow.
