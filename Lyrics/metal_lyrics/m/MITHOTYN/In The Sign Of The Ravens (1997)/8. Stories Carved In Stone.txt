In a time now long gone
wise mans hands
was carving stories into the stones
all over our land.

Stories carved in stone.
To last for eternity.

The runes speak of forgotten times,
forgotten times of the elderly.
A time when man stood up strong and proud,
not afraid to fall for the almighty.
Warriors from the north lands,
sailed east for wealth and glory.
Their destinies immortalized in stone,
from which we are told these stories.

In the age of the ravens
men bravely gave their lifes
to the high ones in the sky,
to be brought up high.

Stories carved in stone.
To last for eternity.

The runes speaks of forgotten times,
forgotten times of the elderly.
A time when man stood up strong and proud,
not afraid to fall for the almighty.
Warriors from the north lands,
sailed east for wealth and glory.
Their destinies immortalized in stone,
from which we are told these stories.

Runes - everlasting.
History - evertelling.
