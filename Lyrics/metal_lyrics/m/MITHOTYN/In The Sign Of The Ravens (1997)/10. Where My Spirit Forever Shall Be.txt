Where the moon in the solitude shines.
Where the owl has it's nest.
Where the spruceforest lonely whines,
there I will find peace.

Over every log and stone
the fog lies.
In the cold and pail light
of the moon,
the wolf barks at the sky.

Where the moon in the solitude shines.
Where the owl has it's nest.
Where the spruceforest lonely whines,
there I will find peace.

To this untouched primeval forest,
shall my spirit forever belong.
Here shall I die in solitude under
the tones of an elvrong.

This is where my spirit
forever shall be.
