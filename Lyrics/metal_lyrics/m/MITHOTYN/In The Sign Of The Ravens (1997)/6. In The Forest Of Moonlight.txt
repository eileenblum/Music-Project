In the forest of moonlight
the secrets of ancient battler are hidden.
But in the northern lands
the memory of the brave still remain.

Between the trees at the meadow
the sounds of war still echoes.
In the grass at the meadow
the blood still flows.

In the forest of moonlight
the secrets of ancient battler are hidden.
Forever they are lost.

At the meadow in the forest
all of them died by sword,
to step into the neverending fight
at the hall of our lord.
