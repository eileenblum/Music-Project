Watch me riude the sky
with anger and rage.
Hear me rule the air
making lightenings all around
with my hammer of magic steel.
My thunder shakes your ground.

With my powerbelt
and my magic hammer of death
I'm the titan number one.
Admire my successful crusade
as I'm victorious up high.

Behind my goats
I'm crossing the clouds,
smashing giantheads
to splinters realt loud.
So hail my existence in songs of glory.
Immortalize me in tales and stories.

Chariot of power.
Defending the wolrd,
protecting the welkin in my
chariot of power.
