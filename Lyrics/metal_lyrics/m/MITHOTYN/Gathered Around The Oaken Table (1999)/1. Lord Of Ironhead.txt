Master of the dictatorial realm
controlling the peolple with tyranny.
With a hand of iron
he is the total majesty.

Lord of Ironhead is his name
sitting upon his mighty throne
with his scepter and sword,
and with a face carved in stone.
Lord of Ironhead.

Invade and slaughter,
conquest is the priority.
Terror and torment,
the law is brutality.
Blood, sweat and tears,
the demand is victory.

Baptized in fire and blood,
crowned in thunder and lightening.
Living in the joy of oppression.
Towards the end of freedom he's striving.
