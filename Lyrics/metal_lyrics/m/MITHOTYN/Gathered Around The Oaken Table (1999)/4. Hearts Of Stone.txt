Upon strong and fast horses
thousands have ridden beyond our borders.
Our standards has been brought
across the whole continent

Hearts of stone
and minds of steel.
Defiel all foes
and crushed their bones.
Gathered under the respected flag
with minds set on conquering.
Hearts of stone
and minds of steel.
Defied all foes
and crushed their bones.
Bonded by their nation
they pledged allegiance to the king's crown.

I'm pulled into the endless theories
in the chronicles of crusades.
Lost in a time of blood and steel
as I'm enchanted by the things they tell.

Most of the soldiers who rode into war
courageously fell for the enemy's sword.
The few who finally returned
carried the light burden of gold.
