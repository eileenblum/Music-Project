From the highlands they come
riding at black stallions at night.
Restless chaotic souls without peace
ravage the countryside and killing
all in sight.

Empty eyesockets shining of red
and bodies of black shadows.

The hordes of darkened souls
awakening at night and dissolves
at daybreak.

Nocturnal riders - Unholy dark spirits.
Nocturnal riders - Risen from the graves.
Nocturnal riders - Slays every life of the light.
Nocturnal riders - On their nocturnal crusade.

Beware of their rage of envy,
do not try to save their souls
if life is precious to you.
Nothing can stop their crusade of death.
