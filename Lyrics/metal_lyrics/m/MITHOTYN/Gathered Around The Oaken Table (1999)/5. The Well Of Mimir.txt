Climb the divine rainbow
in the endless skies.
Behold the world down below
and seek where wisdom lies.

The well of Mimir
filled with water of wisdom.
The well of Mimir
waiting to give you the power
of heathendom.

Stand with the heaven's guard,
the great and white one who defend
the god's residence in Asgaard.
Search for where Yggdrasill's second root ends.

The well of Mimir.
Trade an eye with the old and wise.
The well of Mimir,
where everything in time
and place lies.

Look into our fate,
tell us what we can await,
before it's too late.
