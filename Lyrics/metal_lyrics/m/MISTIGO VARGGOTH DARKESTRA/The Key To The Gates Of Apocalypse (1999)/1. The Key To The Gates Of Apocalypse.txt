I light the candles of my sorcery
The blood is on the altar
It flows from the sacrificed
And fills the bowl to the top
The visions of the ones
That are impossible to call
Gash through the mysteries
That was summoned by me
The steps of vicious Apocalypse
Beside the gates of Armageddon
Where the death tears its mask
And I see its triumphant smile
On the cold damned face
This is my triumph too
I am the keeper of the key
I left the future and abandoned
To the unknown
The gates are opened
The visions of the ones
That are impossible to call
Gash through the mysteries
That was summoned by me
Beyond the nature
Beyond the understanding
Somewhere it evilly opens the maw
From which it discerns the hollow
In the expanse
On the both sides of goodness
And evil
You can't confront it
It's out of the understanding
The top of creation or creator
Wrathfully throw in the time
The billows of the poisoned unknown
Darkness and cold
There is no light
There is no words inside this thought
To stop the time means
To live with it

The space opens the gates
Straight to Algol where its clack light
Burn the rest of life. The wind of my
Glide to the purgatory
I am here face to face with the unknown
Here is the key to Apocalypse!

The soul is wiped
By the asteroids of lie
To find the way is the fate
Of the powerful race
Gliding to the top of awareness
Fall to the pit of unknown
Where's the end of the way?
The endlessness and darkness
Are in front
There is no comprehension of belief
It was not borne here
The triumph of the powerful race!

Goodness, evil. I see the edge
But I can't understand it
It's out of my nature
The one that could flood
Drown here
The one that could kill
Die here
The strength dies here
Only to be borne again

The caravans of stars
Gash to the past
The future was long ago
I'm closer to the stars birth
In the billows of misty emptiness
Appears the borders
Light Darkness Cycle
The dying and galloping back
Through the time nowadays

Born in the circle of the past death
Giving the life to certain parts
Of the universe (where there is nothing
Of my habits)
Against the theory of perfection
Dissimilar and separate all clear
From being misunderstood, Light from Darkness
I see the silliness in it
But this is my nature
I feel how it breaks in me
And I leave that, which
haven't been ever seen
Evil or Gods are borning in me
And now discerning maws of
The Black Holes
Surround the shell of this
That I have seen
The past is born here
And I see it carrying the awfulness

What is involving me here
Through these mysteries?
Misunderstanding or intelligence
That reach the perfection
I will not give answers
To myself, because there are
Not any
Drowning in the rivers of
Ignorance and emerging
In the seas of mind power

The giving hand will take all back
The tear will not drop
It will leave out of time
And the top of that (its bottom) will leave it
Out of nature
Another dimension
Where mountains are pits
And gulfs are peaks

Don't need to continue
We can't understand it
It's far from our understanding
The thought dies at first
And then born here
The law? There is no of it!
It's so far but situated near
In magic rituals it flies as trice
It is impossible to see it
But it involves in its nets
And coldness kills the warmth
The absence of movement and
You are forgotten in eternity here
Ancient symbols tell about great race
The faded flowers borne again
On the ashen rests of the skies
And space opens the gates!

Somewhere in the darkness
I lost my name
But found something different
The opened eyes looking farther
Than only trice
There are no borders from this time
The black ellipse through which
The time die is in front of me
Where the dances of black holes
Don't assemble with consciousness
There, where the road
With further landscape of
Unnatural admitting leads
Where the eternity is equal
To trice, where the trice doesn't
Equal to everything and eternity
Doesn't have equality

Light Darkness Cycle
The outcome - unknown
The straight understanding and that
which is impossible to describe
all change around
my fall into the heights of
our gates of nature...

I opened my eyes
I saw that candles already dimmed.
