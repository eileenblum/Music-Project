Majesty! listen to my words
as I live in your embrace
Breathing your cold air
throughout every seasons
this is a tribute to you

The great pyramids were built at night
all the oceans were filled at night
this my sword was forged at night
Creation happed at night
and it's at night that I work
Nocturnal genocide employee
annihilation of peace that was
I am the prowler

The sun burns my eyes
and leave me blind for months
the day burns my lies

Immortal majesty of the night
In all it's eternal glory
Immortal majesty of the night
leave me to abysmal darkness
