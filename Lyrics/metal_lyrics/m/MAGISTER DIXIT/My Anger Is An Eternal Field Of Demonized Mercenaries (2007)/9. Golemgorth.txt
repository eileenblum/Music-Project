He's the king of mitgon hordes
respected by his battlemates
Idolating their creator
a mitgon is a warrior since birth

his name is Golemgorth, the strongest mitgon of the valley
he lead his people to war and to fury
he never give up in a fight
he is the leader to eternity
after and forever

In the valley of Anoryl
an ocean before The Firestorm
the king of mitgon starts to realize
this anger is worthless
are blades are pointing (in) the wrong side

spirit of a warrior dead a long time ago
his resurrected soul visit them at night
he is the guide of all mitgon
...azagath's slaves anymore

azagath's slaves anymore!

breaking the chains and now look for a better goal
but the reject of azagath is the key to our destiny
Golemgorth speak to his men
the guards with blood-red eyes
all against one
but a really mighty one

azagath, wizard of supreme evil
Hyldeon already knows
that nothing is won

his name is Golemgorth, the strongest mitgon of the valley
he lead his people to war and to fury
he never give up in a fight
he is the leader to eternity
after and forever
his name is Golemgorth the strongest mitgon of the valley

Golemgorth!
means pride and glory for all the mitgons
he's the leader of war
Golemgorth!
he's the true king of all the mitgons
he's the leader of war
