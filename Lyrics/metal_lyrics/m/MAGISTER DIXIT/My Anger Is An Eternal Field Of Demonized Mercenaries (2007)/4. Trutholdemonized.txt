I possess the truth I am the truth

Follow me in my realm
of darkness and power
fear! see the fire of desolation rise

I am the only witness of the last solstice
I know something that must remain a secret

Until the great cataclysm comes
to annihilate this world forever

I am the only witness of the last solstice
I know something that must remain a secret

Until the great cataclysm comes
to annihilate this world forever
I am the chosen one for (some) reasons
my hand can hold the fire

My shadow is always over me
like the sword of damocles
my ang er is an eternal field of demonized mercenaries
my fist was made to destroy the holy
and all the people of their kind
grind their souls
and release their impure blood
'til the last drop

Golemgorth!
means pride and glory for all the mitgons
he's the leader of war
Golemgorth!
he's the true king of all the mitgons
he's the leader of war
