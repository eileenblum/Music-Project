Remember the ways of our pagan brothers
See that the blood wasn't spilled without any reasons
Those who live under the banner of a 2000 year legend
Are false. Let our brothers be unjewed

Their is no church worth your god
Their is no pain worth your church
Still they await their savior
Our swords shall be the savior

With victorious weapons only
We shall honor our ancestors
rise back to the basis of life
To feel the embrace of true nature once again

Let em be juged for their treason
Those who refuse to admit
Those who will perish from their cration
They bring eternal sorrow to our race
