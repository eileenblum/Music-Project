First you hurt yourself
So hard that you can feel
and appreciate 
The real thing called pain

...don't be afraid of your reaction
it will comeback forever

Martyr you are the plague of men
time is standing still
Martyr you are the plague of men
Dead is not for now

An eternity of pain and suffering

Feel what it feels to be burned
Feel what it feels to be cutted
Feel what it feels to be shooted
(by a shotgun blast)
Feel what it feel... to suffer the suffering

The need for pain is growing
Now you're ready to live forever
Addiction is rising inside
