Awaken by the winds of warning
as it been told in the legends of the past
we own the north together
united until the world ends
we come from the first of men
we hear the sign of the wolf
we gather to our tree
hope for long summer... of war...

We come from the last battle
raising the flag of grey
we move south to save honour
...of the king of winterfell

The blizzard king

"Seven families locked in the battle for the iron throne
your sons and daughters will avenge your death
so is the way, the Nordic way"

stormy winds of revelation
telling stories of a winter to come

Stark!
winter is coming
watch for traitor â vision the future
for all that we've saw
who is the law?
calling us betrayers
so is the kingslayer
