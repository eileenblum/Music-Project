Where is your promised light
for all those who worship, are enslave
and divided. The son of god. L'hÃ©ritier du mal

You broke the spirit of man
To now be driven by non sense
Left to agonize in this bucketful of human meat
the abyss empty as yourself

It's so easy to use weakness
to breed a new legacy
based on fraud

In front of volcano
seem so tiny and innofensive
When the beast rise
Everything turns into blood red darkness

L'hÃ©ritier du mal
celui qui porte la malÃ©diction
The curse from below
celui qui dÃ©termine la souffrance

Rising (of the beast)
Grace anihilated
No traces of beauty left
The beast is back
