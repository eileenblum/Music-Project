Somewhere in the labyrinth of misery
seeking hands to get free
running through roads of temptation
into the corrupted lands of deception
into the falling cities of nihil
the gates of shame that keeps the master's house
is shining under the moon
citizens remain all silent
somewhere in my lost body, slave of my flesh-unit
into the costume... living the character
I belong to the lost race
I need a fix of pride
give me a weapon  to escape my ignorance
maze of thousand ways
never ending circle of systematic failure
under a dark sun, world's depression
