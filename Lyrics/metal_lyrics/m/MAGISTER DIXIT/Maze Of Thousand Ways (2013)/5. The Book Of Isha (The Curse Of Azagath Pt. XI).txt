[Thularis:]
"I now understand what is going on
I've got an army of five thousand men
where is that book you're talking about
I will hear the task myself"

[Hyldeon:]
"Well my friend it's harder than it seems
the book is well hidden in the temple of DarÃ¼nh
high in the mountains of dead sun
ten thousand miles from here
we must stand together for victory"

[Thularis:]
"Anything I would do to bring back
the earth the way it was"

[Golemgorth:]
"I don't even know how it was before
what I know is the death of the black lord
to unchain the mitgons ...forever"

Pages of forbidden incantations
words to remake words to recreate
the world the it was
union of men and mitgons
a simple army of two hostile races

[Hyldeon:]
"Be patient my friend, it's only a matter of time
we must make a plan, we will bring it back"

The book of Isha, formulas of a forgotten magic
The book of Isha, four elements, unspoken language
Thularians and mitgons now united
with swords, grotesque axes and their raging hearts
they're walking days and weeks
to the mountain of the dead sun

[Hyldeon:]
"Follow me, I will lead you to the temple
but beware of the grey spirits, they are controlled by him"

then storms of terror suddenly rises
the power of azagath is supreme
on the mountain of dead sun...
where the sun used to shine one day
men and mitgon had been killed
but the quest still continues
the temple of Darunh is getting closer
ignoring the obviousness of a four-element spell

earth!.. air!.. water!.. fire!
grey spirits are falling, the union is too strong in numbers
reaching the temple, face to face with the main lord
