Trumpets of battle, trumpets of war
marching forward to the great temple of darunh
grey spirits are slowly falling down
thularians are strong mighty fighter
the sky is darker than it ever been
this is the era of thousand prophecies
storm-thunder-lightning and frozen winds
it's the epoch of unblessed tragedies
at the gates in front of temple
the mage of chaos is casting more and more to re-enforce

then thularis opens the door the final fight
all he saw was an orb of light, a menacing sphere
as he grab his sword, a lightning struck his hand off
but he could see the book on a table
the sky is darker than it ever been
this is the time to crush the enemy
storm-thunder-lightning and frozen winds
it's the epoch of unblessed tragedies

Trumpets of battle â battle!
trumpets of war â war! fight!
at the gates in front of the temple
the mage of chaos is casting more and more to re-enforce

[Thularis:]
"I need your help, Golemgorth"
as the mitgon king struck the mage with an axe

Golemgorth took the book in his hand
while azagath was still alive
but could not read simple word
hyldeon knows how to read this
earth! air! water! fire!
then azagath simply disappear
grey spirits left without master
the ghost of hyldeon was only a dream...

The end
