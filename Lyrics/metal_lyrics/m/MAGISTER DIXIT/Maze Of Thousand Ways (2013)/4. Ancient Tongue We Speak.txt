Immortality lies in the dark
envisioned destiny
still ancient tongue we speak

darken lifeform rise
from the ashes
forbid eternally

Undivinity transcend, graceful is your stench
we're bound to your every words
and chained to your beliefs
Ceremonial oath - deadly words are spoken

this is the triumph of mortality
pungent odour of putrifying devoters
ships of hatred sailing the bloodoceans
ancient tongue we speaks
elder words we scream
hordes of ancestral traditions
summoning the splendour of obscurity
