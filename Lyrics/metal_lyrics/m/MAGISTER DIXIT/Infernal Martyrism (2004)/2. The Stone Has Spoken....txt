The stone has spoken
The scriptures of the older ones
That shown me the truth,
The way of before a forgotten message left on my path
Now, should I believe in destiny?

The stone has spoken
The scriptures of the older ones
That shown me the truth,
The way of before a forgotten message left on my path
Now, should I believe in destiny?

Under a silver moon
For me the world means cold
All I have in shoulder is my pain
Emptiness has been now shine
For me the world means cold

Under a silver moon
For me the world means cold
The scriptures of the older ones
That shown me the truth,
The way of before
All I have in shoulder is my pain
Emptiness has been now shine
A forgotten message
Left on my path

The time has come for me to translate and to see...
To translate and to see
What will happen to me?
What will become of us?
The stone will tell me

La roche a parlÃ©
LâÃ©criture des anciens
La pure vÃ©ritÃ©
La voiÃ© de jadis
Un message oublie su mes pas
Dois-je croire en la destiner?
