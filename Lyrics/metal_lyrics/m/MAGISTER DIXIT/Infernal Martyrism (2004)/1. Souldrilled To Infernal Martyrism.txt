We all think we own divine protection...
It only takes a second of non-attention
To be enslaved in torture, extreme pain...
To be face to face with death!

Mortality and poetic horizons
Contradiction of suffering
From now, things have changed in importance
Feelings I want to materialize
To show my will and create a comfort
An artificial pillow to hold my dreams...

"A nightmare-like trauma... an ever repeating movie"

Mortality and poetic horizons
Contradiction of suffering
From now, things have changed in importance
Feelings I want to materialize
To show my will and create a comfort
An artificial pillow to hold my dreams...

Souldrilled... the true meaning of pain
Souldrilled... to infernal martyrism
Souldrilled... fall down to the floor
... And saved from death claws!

"A nightmare-like trauma... an ever repeating movie"

Can you feel the darkness of steel,
The power of mechanic forces
Can you feel the loneliness

Souldrilled... the true meaning of pain
Souldrilled... to infernal martyrism
Souldrilled... fall down to the floor
... And saved from death claws!

We all think we own divine protection...
It only takes a second of non-attention
To be enslaved in torture, extreme pain...
To be face to face with death!
