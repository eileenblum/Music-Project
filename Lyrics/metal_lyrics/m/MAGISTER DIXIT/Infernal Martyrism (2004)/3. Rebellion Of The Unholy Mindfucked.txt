Thereâs a prison for everyone and idiots are the cause....
Order and laws are to our minds horrible consequences
Surrounded by divisions of what is now true...
Make your way inside of it or suffer
Do what is allowed to do or pay the price...
This is your chain very hard to break...

Never follow!
Just make your way... rebellion is in your hands
Never forget!
Never obey!
Make the trendy one bleed
Never follow!
Just make your way... rebellion is in your hands
Never forget!
Never obey!
Make the trendy one bleed

Get rid of all these structures just leave me alone
My social card is disabled...
And so is my mind!

Put an end to the cancer....
In a world dominated by total hypocrisy!
Create an island for us, a nation of our own
In a world dominated by total hypocrisy!

We are the detecting spy-eyes
Ready to know whatâs true
We are the messengers...
We are the detecting spy-eyes
Ready to know whatâs true
We are the messengers...

We have been further or will in the future...
We abolish the structures

Never follow!
Just make your way... rebellion is in your hands
Never forget!
Never obey!
Make the trendy one bleed
Never follow!
Just make your way... rebellion is in your hands
Never forget!
Never obey!
Make the trendy one bleed
Make the fucking trendy one bleed

Thereâs a prison for everyone and idiots are the cause....
Order and laws are to our minds horrible consequences
Surrounded by divisions of what is now true...
Make your way inside of it or suffer

We are the detecting spy-eyes
Ready to know whatâs true
We are the messengers...
We are the detecting spy-eyes
Ready to know whatâs true
We are the messengers...

We are the children of cold
