Born in the epoch of unblessed tragedies...
Dead by the hands of this evil wizard...
Reborn by magic of eternal wisdom...
Hyldeon, the mighty knight of war...

He is the paladin of his majesty; he is the savior of this nation...
Once killed by Azagath his soul stayed on earth as a ghost

"A hard task is my mission but the spell must be broken"

Hyldeonâs destiny...
To realize the prophecy
After the firestorm thereâs an hope to reborn...
Thereâs a land to remake and so people to wake
A hidden power in the ground, a secret we must never find

Hyldeonâs destiny...
To realize the prophecy
After the firestorm thereâs an hope to reborn...
