Listen to the chants of misunderstood memories
Hear their lamentations,
Accept what they want,
Their revendications of a medieval future

Now you can see theyâre coming
The others are misunderstanding
Donât give up you will have your war...
Now you can see theyâre coming
The others are misunderstanding
Donât give up you will have your war...

Hordes of man are passing the gates
Gates of never-ending time
Through the centuries, mage, warriors,
By thousands coming for war
By thousands coming for war

Civilizations of the new days
For hundred years
Enter the gate of never-ending time
Enter the gate of never-ending time

Listen to the chants of misunderstood memories
Hear their lamentations,
Accept what they want,
Their revendications of a medieval future

Killing the impure to bring forth the new blood and quench our thirst for demise
Hail the new order
Raise a sword toward
Under the banner of the pagan hordes

Beware the holy one
And so you respect your ancestors
And the fire can rise again

They will never see the day again
The world is clean at last
I shall remember the new days
