Tremble for me wildest species
Predator is now inhuman
A demonoid race with titanesque virtue
Blinded by anger, building bizarre statues to the effigy of Azagath

Hyldeon has an open eye, he saw all his people die
In a new form, the same soul
A mission... a role

The Mitgon race
The Mitgon race
The Mitgon race

The Mitgon race
The Mitgon race
The Mitgon race

Sat on his throne
Golemgorth, the greatest king of Mitgons
As every days Mitgons are going to never-ending war
Then he saw all those Mitgonite genocides, automatically recognize the work of Azagath

"My name is Hyldeon the proud
Paladin of king Haerdien"

The Mitgon race
The Mitgon race
The Mitgon race

The Mitgon race
The Mitgon race
The Mitgon race

Four elements together
Azagath reunite them
Heâs the creator of all
The conceptor of mitgonity

Pray in homage to the lord and create infernal hordes
Land of wilderness, left in emptiness
From dusk till dawn their days sleeping while the sun is high
Mystical is their ways
Careless to live or to die

"Hundred of years has passed and this slaughter race is still going
I must admit they seem well that way, but I have a mission and I shall respect my task
I shall take some of them to defeat Azagath"

But one day deep through Golemgorthâs sleep
A voice and a face to tell the truth
"Youâre only puppets of your lord,
Break these chains and be the one master"

An ambitious Golemgorth woke up that night,
To start thinking about what he dreamed of...
Could it only be a dream?

The Mitgon race
The Mitgon race
The Mitgon race

The Mitgon race
The Mitgon race
The Mitgon race

Tremble for me wildest species
Predator is now inhuman
A demonoid race with titanesque virtue
