Loneliness my destiny
My ugliness eternally
All these tears I try to hide
I feel now to kill my soul
Nobody ever wanted of me
My ugliness eternally
Everybodyâs angry at me
Sometimes a smile, but not really sincere
And if one day I try to hide
I go out but I realize the light of sun will drive me blind
Iâm alone of my kind
I hang myself!!!!
