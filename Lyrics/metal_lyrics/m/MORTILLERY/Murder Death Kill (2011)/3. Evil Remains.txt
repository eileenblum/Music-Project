Hell on earth the day has come 
The beast is here donât try to run 
Bodies decaying nothing is left 
Burning your churches; evil remains 
The Army of Darkness is finally here 
The Angel of Death is nothing to fear 
Demonic forces are hard to resist 
Feeding your hunger beyond the mist

Evil Will Rise 
The Beast Has Survived 
Ruling The Night 
Taking Your Lives

Human survivors are taking a stand 
Fighting together, they do all they can 
Screaming for help they die one by one 
Your Life is over the damage is done 
Evil is back now, the day has come 
From hell they came to claim his throne 
Demonic forces are hard to resist 
Feeding your hunger beyond the mist

Evil Will Rise 
The Beast Has Survived 
Ruling The Night 
Taking Your Lives
