Euphoria flys a recreational dream 
Rewarded circuitry 
Blazing so fast up narrowing roads 
The path is decieving 
Sweating away all misfortunes 
A numbing therapy 
The red flags descend soaring at half mass 
As the mind begins to fade

As the plateau drops 
The spiral burns 
Separation from normality 
Despised by blood 
Rejection burns 
No sympathy 
For the plague of self distructivity

Dysphoria rides a dependant nightmare 
Solitude secrecy 
Chasing the dragon into its cave 
And no re-entry 
Scratching away at the walls of infection 
Into eternity 
The red flags descend soaring at half mass 
As the mind begins to fade

As the plateau drops 
The spiral burns 
Separation from normality 
Despised by blood 
Rejection burns 
No sympathy 
For the plague of self distructivity

Destiny enslaved 
The plague of self destruction 
Into nameless graves 
The plague of self destruction 
All shunned to shame 
The plague of self destruction 
Bridges burnt in vein 
The plague of self destruction

Chasing the dragon into its cave 
And no re-entry 
The red flags descend soaring at half mass 
As the mind begins to fade

Destiny enslaved 
The plague of self destruction 
Into nameless graves 
The plague of self destruction
