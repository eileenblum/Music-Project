Sacrifice the virgins blood 
We kill with no remorse 
It's bloody murder don't loose control 
We fight a deadly force

Darkness fills the void inside me 
I dare to call his name 
When you scream there's no one near 
It'll make you go insane

It's getting late and there aint no way 
You'll get to sleep tonight 
The stench of fear is in the air 
You know it won't be alright tonight

It's getting late and there aint no way 
You'll get to sleep tonight 
The stench of fear is in the air 
You know it won't be alright tonight alright

Darkness fills the void inside me 
I dare to call his name 
When you scream there's no one near 
It'll make you go insane

It's getting late and there aint no way 
You'll get to sleep tonight 
The stench of fear is in the air 
You know it won't be alright tonight

It's getting late and there aint no way 
You'll get to sleep tonight 
The stench of fear is in the air 
You know it won't be alright tonight alright

Surrender your lives theres no escape 
Pain is all you know 
We rise from the ashes of the unknown 
The eternal fire glows

Darkness fills the void inside me 
I dare to call his name 
When you scream there's no one near 
It'll make you go insane

It's getting late and there aint no way 
You'll get to sleep tonight 
The stench of fear is in the air 
You know it won't be alright tonight

It's getting late and there aint no way 
You'll get to sleep tonight 
The stench of fear is in the air 
You know it won't be alright tonight alright
