We've conquored great mountains 
Scaled boulders through trees 
You've guided me 
By my side always on each path i take 
You trust in me

Final journeys together on earth have come 
Without weapons 
We'll fight for life our wits stand strong 
Untill the end

The owl is watching as she protects her nest 
She sweeps down her talons scrape across your back 
I'd invoke your pain upon myself if I could 
But that would not display enough gratitude

When death comes I will give you my soul 
It's yours to keep I don't need it anymore 
Your wisdom is how I've succeded to mend 
Such knowledge will never be forgotten my friend

We've seen so much yet so little it seems 
You've guarded me 
Through violence and fear i now stand my ground 
You've taught me

Your blade inside me will never grow dull 
Without weapons 
I'll fight to survive with memory 
Untill the end

The owl is watching as she protects her nest 
She sweeps down her talons scrape across your back 
I'd invoke your pain upon myself if I could 
But that would not desplay enough gratitude

When death comes I will give you my soul 
It's yours to keep I don't need it anymore 
Your wisdom is how I've succeded to mend 
Such knowledge will never be forgotten my friend

I cannot tell you what will be 
Without weapons I'll fight untill you're free 
Death will part us but we will meet again 
For eternity I'll search through dimentions

We will meet again 
Unwhole I will remain till then 
Our journeys will go on and on and on

I cannot tell you what will be 
Without weapons I'll fight untill you're free 
Death will part us but we will meet again 
Our journey never ends 
We will meet again 
Woa without weapons
