Held underground for 24 years in an Austrian torture vault 
The concrete walls sweat visciously with memory to why they stand 
8 doors must be crossed to reach the horror thats inside 
The invasive stench of incest and murder lingers in the air

The fear of being gassed overrules the plan to escape

Above ground a family man hides his workshop to the world 
Raising 3 of his cellar children as orphans found outside 
Rosemarie lies and states that she was not aware 
Of her daughter's life being entombed a few feet below

An accomplice from the begining turning her head to early abuse

Descending to the cellar several times a day 
Re-enacting porno scenes with his own DNA 
Beatings are fierce resisting brings them on 
Elizabeth's will was broken all her hope was lost

Captive slave 
Prizoner of the dark 
Captive slave 
Of Fritzl

Forced to bare their children alone 
With only a pair of sissors to cut the umbilical cord 
Their offspring will have genetic dissabilities 
Along with other side affects of inbreeding

Captive slave 
Prizoner of the dark 
Captive slave

7 born 
6 to survive 
3 in the darkness 
3 in the light 
1 of them died during infancy 
And then cast into the furnace

Captive bred eyes burn from the light 
No more walls of incest 
Now try hard to piece together something that never existed
