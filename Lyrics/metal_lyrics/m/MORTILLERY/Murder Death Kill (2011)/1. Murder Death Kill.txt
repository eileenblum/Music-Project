Nightstalker they say, eyes glowing bright
blood on the moon when we rise
fired up with lightening charging through your veins
as mayhem burns in the sky

murder death kill
murder

we're marching till dawn gonna take our revenge
deadly assassins tonight
feel that shiver run down your spine
murder death kill all in sight

murder death kill
murder

KILL KILL KILL the violence lives
no sympathy or guilt
MURDER is power, better stand clear
our homicidal disease
DEATH to all who stand in our way
a powerful satisfaction
MURDER DEATH KILL the final count
bleeding from your wounds while we stand proud

murder death kill

we come like thunder rip you from your bed
snarling and starving we tear off your head
we thirst for death you will never see the light
doing it again and again every night

murder death kill
murder
