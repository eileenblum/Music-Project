The age of war's alive and it's time to pay our dues
The sound of chaos thickening as the havoc intrudes
Decimate in numbers and try to salvage what you can
In this ruined world of war I don't have a friend
Silence now, the calm before the storm, be aware bombs are gonna drop
Enemies closing in I can't see through the smoke, scavengers moving as a last resort

Nuclear death, there is nothing left from this, detonate
A world of self destruction, fight or flight, the fate will be the same
Toxic war, it's too late to change, there's no way out

We have stood for nothing and will fall for nothing, we pose as Gods
And yet our race has failed, the dawn of the new world cries out for mass extinction
The will inside me gives in as sacrifice

Silence now, the calm after the storm, the horizon stares at the unborn
All that was, now is not, and will never be the same
Stillness glides through the trees as the winds begin to change

Nuclear death, there is nothing left from this
Detonate.  A world of self destruction.  Fight or flight
The fate will be the same, toxic war, it's too late to change
It's too late to change 
There's no way out!
