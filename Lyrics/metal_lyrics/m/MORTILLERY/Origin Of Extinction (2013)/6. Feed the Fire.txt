Fire burning proud in our veins, we await the thrill 
Feeding the darkness as we charge to the front, blood turns to boil

We cannot change the fate of the night, flames are burning hot
Turning our heads to the left and to the right
We're aware that something's just not right
Some faces just don't belong, their howls spread like disease
And it's spreading fast

As the lion hunts the gazelle, I feel you creeping near
As my body embraces the ground, my vision is reddened 
You've fed the fire, now you're committed to your fate
Adrenaline feeds my hunger now, you cannot escape the flame

Feed the fire, feed the fire, I've lost all control
Feed the fire, and burn 'em slow

You've fed the fire, now you are committed to your fate
Adrenaline feeds my hunger now, you cannot escape the flame

Something snaps inside of me, my hell is breaking loose
The fire is unleashing, the pain that is hunting you
I light my torch, carborize the flame, melting your eyeballs to your face
Hang you up high, waiting to die
I watch and eat
Whatever hits the ground 
Feed the fire
We cannot change the fate of the night
Flames are burning hot
Blood vessels dilate 
Animal thirst annihilates 
I lick my bloody fists
While you spit up crimson mist
