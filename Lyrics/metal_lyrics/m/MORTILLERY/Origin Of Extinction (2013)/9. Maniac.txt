Look in my eyes. And what do you see?. Pain and confusion
Schizophrenic psychotic dreams. Is this an illusion?
Never stop to think about what led to these events
All that seems to matter now is the pain that I create

Maniac Maniac Maniac

There is no excuse for the horrors I have done
Look into my soul and you will find a smoking gun
Society has made a monster out of me
Don't believe everything that you see on the T.V.

Maniac Maniac Maniac

In my sickness I have found.
A form of pleasure. I can't be bound
No restrain, no more chains, it's madness!
Padded walls; is this a joke?
You see the room, it fills with smoke
No restrains, no more chains,
its madness!

Look in my eyes
And what do you see?
Pain and confusion
Schizophrenic psychotic dreams
Is this an illusion?
Never stop to think about
What led to these events
All that seems to matter now is the pain that I create

Maniac Maniac Maniac
