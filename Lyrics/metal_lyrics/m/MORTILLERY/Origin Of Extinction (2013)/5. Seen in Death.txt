Erie beads sweat of chill my face as I lay awake
Succubus steals my breath every night and holds me in place
As the heavy air fills my lungs, I begin to fade
I dread what is yet to come again, I fear I'm still awake

Seen in death

I've entered a timeless place, a new dimension, a wall-less space
Matter is dark like carbon smoke, forgotten beings roam weightlessly  
Energy cannot be created or destroyed
Missing mass, seen in death
I've entered a timeless place, a new dimension, a wall-less space
Matter is dark like carbon smoke, forgotten beings roam weightlessly 
Energy cannot be created or destroyed

My eyes are seeing what cannot be, the dead and the damned are chasing after me running through uncured cement, I feel their chilling breath
I cannot wake from this place
Missing death is seen in death

I cannot prove what I have seen
There is truth behind this dream
I have another space
I shall return to this place
Hidden worlds exist together
We all enter without power 
You will see with your last breath
Missing mass is 
Seen in death

Seen in death
