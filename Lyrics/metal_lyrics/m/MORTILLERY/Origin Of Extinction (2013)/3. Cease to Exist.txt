Weeping bloody tears
Parched and caving in
Draining life by gallons. Wasted!
Drowning in the sand

[Chorus:]
Pestilence has begun, famine, crops to dust
Proliferation, war, self-destruct
Infernal massacre, death by the masses, good riddance
Some make plans to flee to the sky
They won't survive this, greed will reign in time

Invade other worlds, to renew, life that destroys itself
Infest other worlds, history will repeat itself
Destroyed our world, life cannot sustain

[Repeat chorus]

This generation will see the war
Drained and ingested, the one to end it all
Infest other worlds, history will repeat itself
Destroyed our world, life cannot sustain itself
