Take on the night, don't walk away, let's show them how we never quit
Leather and steel, weapons of choice, the time is now to take control

[Chorus]
We will fight until we die, our souls soar into the sky
We return to the hunters' lair, don't fight it we will suck you in
Turning good into sin
We strong thrash out in the hunters' lair

Full speed ahead, fired up, the triumph of metal
With punk to back, the alliance will reign
Faster than light, we're coming to get you
Speed thrash attack!

[Repeat chorus]

Sworn by blood we will fight until the end
