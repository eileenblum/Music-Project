Arboreal cavity hollowed and tunneled
Monogynous colony shaded and guarded
Nesting chambers closely stacked in tiers
A cartridge of conscripts
Infantry worker-fashioned cells
To hoard their brood

Bullet fires excruciating pain
Venom flowing fiercely in your veins
Disturbing peace is an act of war
Neurotoxin brings agony to their foe

Crepuscular foraging is vital and determined
Workers strive to scavenge along the canopy
Landmarks guide the troops as they return
With instinct they come
Bearing rations to feed their kin

A founding queen; the nuptial flight
Leaving her nest mates behind
Soaring high into the air
She meets her mate; her wings she tears

Eusocial through primitive
A lifetime of seed he gives
Workers thrive; the caster forms
Soldiers slay defending their home

Defenders swarm from deep within its core
