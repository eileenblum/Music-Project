Brewing to the west
The climate schemes and collides
Foothills feed the drifter cold
Stirring to the east
The violent cell is unleashed
The cluster of storms approached

Vortex gathering speed
Refinery Row at its peak
Abate when the kill is weak
Annihilate then dissipate

Brilliant sky stares
Onto its swath of destruction
Hail beats down
Like boulders from above
Vicious eye channels
All its wrath onto the chosen
Supercells give birth to the F5

The roaring freight train
Announces its arrival
Many can't escape the tornadic storm
Encircled by debris
Lives are lost and left broken
Stillness guides the beast
Back to the core from which it came

Black Friday
