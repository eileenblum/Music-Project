I shovel the coal while you bring me pain
Ignorant to the lashing
Torture is certain, I cannot escape
Reality kick to the face

I fear this life
I fear the end
Torture

Fire is burning at both ends
Weary of drinking poison
Reclusive, I scream at the night
Re-born from ashes again

Appearing with nobility
I give it all or nothing
With words that rip flesh from bone
I should've hit the ground running

I fear this life
I fear the end
Torture is certain I cannot escape
I fear this life
I fear the end
Torture

To gaze upon the world as one
And glide through all the madness
With timeless thoughts of what can be,
Restricted by your darkness

Ride upon the midnight sky
To see it all but come back blind
Desire clouds reality
I am all out of fight

Torture
Quartered as the horses pull
Torture
Shunned and dragged then left alone
Torture
Oblivious to loyalty
Torture
From lust I beg to be set free
