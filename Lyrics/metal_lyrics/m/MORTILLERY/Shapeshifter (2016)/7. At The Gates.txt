A soul breaks free from a corpse
The journey begins to the end of the earth
A realm invisible in human form
A greedy god's kingdom of the dead

A dying wish of coins on lips
To pay the fair
Or forever be trapped between worlds

Spirits of the dead
Passing one way to the underworld

Acheron river of pain
Cocytus river of lamentation
Phlegethon river of fire
Styx river of hatred
Lethe river of oblivion

Alone he stands at the gates
Watching ferryman drifting in
He who enters cannot escape
A thirst for souls from flesh stripping heads

Kneel and be judged; eternal fate
Frozen in time skeletons roams weightless

The living shall not enter here
He sees the past, present and future
