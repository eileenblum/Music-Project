Climbing the summit with pride
Driven by famine and honor to die
The elders call out through the wind
With guidance to the custom
Established long ago

Bareback and moral on an offspring steed
Breaking twigs off of the trees
Maternal wake to provide a safe return
Mist break reveals a desolate place
Cold air strikes hard on the face
A son carried his mother to her death

Come forth into the sea of trees
Open your darkest thoughts to me
A curse laid by Ubasute
Extending my limbs in a desperate embrace

Ignore the signs and never look back
My branches are your gallows
Tortured by society you'll break
Shadows taunting sanity
An attempt to die with dignity
We both know you're not hesitant to die

Behold the icy caverns
Gathering of Yurei
Pristine and enchanting
The perfect place to lie
Volcanic detritus
Concealing the macabre
The only being by your side forever is yourself

I feed off the corpses spread throughout
The lost give me the strength that I need
To let my demons out
