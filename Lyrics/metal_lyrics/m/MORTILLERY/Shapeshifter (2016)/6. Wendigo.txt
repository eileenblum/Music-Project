Human becoming cryptid
Struggling to survive
Famine from dead cold winters
Canadian woods

Catabolysis claims tissues
Atrophy weakening the mind
Seeking the weak or children
With hunger behind the eyes

Satisfy with flesh form others
Gaining great strength and speed
Sacrifice based on survival
Awakes a demon's sleep

The evil that devours haunts northern forests
Controlling the sky using dark magic
Elongated tongues mimic human voices
Stalking the host in the dark

Returning to mortal land
After years of hibernation
The lone creature is hungry
And possession is his passion

Wendigo made of ice
Wendigo bloody eyes
Wendigo pale yellow skin
Wendigo is razor thin
Sight of the Wendigo means death will follow
Wendigo fifteen feet tall
Wendigo the cannibal

Keeping victims alive to keep them fresh
Underground in caves he makes his nest
Man-beast with a venomous bite
Leaving starved victims to change

Host turns to beast running naked through the trees
With threats of violence spewing from its jaws
Cravings begin; blood and flesh hang off the chin
Of he who was too selfish to die
