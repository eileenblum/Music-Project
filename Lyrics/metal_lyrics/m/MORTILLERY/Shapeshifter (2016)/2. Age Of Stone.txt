Ancient sun descends
Quieting the land
As the night frosts life into the dawn

Moonlight takes command
Predators ascend
As the hunt feeds life into the dawn

In the ruthless Pleistocene
An ice age swept across the earth
Bearing grasslands that were sparse
Avid ice sheets claim their turf

Aurochs grazing in the fields
Ibex gather to survive
Mammoths heard together in fear
They are hunted

Carnivorous are the apex predators
Exploiting bogs they close in for the kill
Thrusting spears leaving stone tools in their wake
Smashing bones into rock sucking marrow out

Strategic slaughter taking down big game
Powerful musculature; they kill at close range
Skinning quarry; knives made out of stone
Antlers to shaft; the first craftsmanship is born

Fires burn in a musty grotto hearth
Emeralds glow in the sky

People of great mystery
Bred out by homo sapiens
Lived and died by the rules of carnivores
Extinct never to be seen again
