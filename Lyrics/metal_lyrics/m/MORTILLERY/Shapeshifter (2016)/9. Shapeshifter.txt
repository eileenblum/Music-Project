The dendrites crawl
Upon the trees
Casting moonlit shadows on the snow

Beneath the frost the rot
Emanates from the kill
Ravens scavenge on the crimson ice

Free the beast within
Therian

Suppressed, bound up tight and backed against the wall
Gripping to the sanity that always seems to fall

(Shapeshifter)

Change what is hated and what is not real
Never look back

Peering from a deepened den
Behold the road that lies downwind
Thrusted down on hand and knee
Dripping flesh and snarling teeth

Bursting from frostbitten skin
Hackles raised; howling breath

Change what is hated and never ever look back

Shapeshifter

The dendrites crawl
Upon the trees
Casting moonlit shadows on the snow

Beneath the frost the rot
Emanates from the kill
Ravens scavenge on the crimson ice
