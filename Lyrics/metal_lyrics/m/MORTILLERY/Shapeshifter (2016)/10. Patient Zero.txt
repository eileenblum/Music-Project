Hijacked on a dreary night
Cast to live amongst the dead
Through a teal lagoon of corpses
On land of human

Beak masque doctors pull ashore
The freshly incarcerated
Interns shovel swollen bodies
To ignite them in plague pits

Patient Zero
Never getting out 
Patient Zero
Here is where you die

Ghostly wails from the lazaretto
Echo through the institution
Each era has its own terror
Quarantined in crumbling walls

The warden bell tower
Hovers above the nameless graves
Waiting for bells to chime again
Upon a modern age

Patient Zero
Never getting out 
Patient Zero
Here is where you die
