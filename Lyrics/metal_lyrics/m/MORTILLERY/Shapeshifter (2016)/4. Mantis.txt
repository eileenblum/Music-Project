Quietly she awaits on foliage for her mate
The sweet smell of death fills the air
With a traitor's smile and animal lust
She will breed

He descends from the canopy
Swaying with alpha pride
Guided by a promiscuous scent
Drawn in by a luring dance

A brilliant display of instinct
Far from human instinct
Their words shall never intersect
They are pure

Patiently camouflaged awaits to take
Stalking past memories to better ones own fate
Innocent prey absorbs betray
From the ravenous deceiver with clouded eyes

Shredding the mind
Cannibalistic traits cut deep
The scent is so strong
Predator eyes tease naked meat

Mantis the aggressor
Mantis enchanting predator

Molting old skin
Uncovers true hate from within
New stained traitor lurking in the mist
Awaiting the next victim to submit

Forming the lies
Enchanting aggressor will soon arise
The endless slay and mental decay
When your back is turned she will strike

She strikes so fast
She strikes to kill

During copulation she'll chomp off his head
Continuing to gyrate after he's dead
The seed has been planted and life shall go on
Humanity's loyalty remains forever lost

Shredding the mind
Cannibalistic traits cut deep
The scent is so strong
No solace for the weak
