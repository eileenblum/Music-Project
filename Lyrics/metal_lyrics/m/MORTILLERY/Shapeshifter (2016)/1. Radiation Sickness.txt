The rising sun brings a new day
Splitting the atoms, creates a new hell
Thousands dead in an instant on the streets
Only their shadows remain

In a flash your life is taken away
The mushroom cloud is a symbol of death
Feel the shockwave, hear the sound
Hiroshima city burns to the ground

Deception is key to enter the war
Many will suffer to settle the score
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Destroying lives, leaving nothing behind

Radiation sickness
1945
Necessary evil
Now prepare to die
Blackened liquid matter rains from the sky
Contaminated substance of life

The streets are filled with agony
People charred and the barely alive
Creeping slowly dragging their feet
Looking to escape this blazing inferno

In a flash your life is taken away
The mushroom cloud is a symbol of death
Feel the shockwave, hear the sound
Hiroshima city burns to the ground

Deception is key to enter the war
Many will suffer to settle the score
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Destroying lives, leaving nothing behind

Radiation sickness
1945
Necessary evil
Now prepare to die
Blackened liquid matter rains from the sky
Contaminated substance of life

Come on

Spared from the fire bombs
A test to measure hate
Three were chosen but two will fall

Radiation sickness
1945
Necessary evil
Now prepare to die
Blackened liquid matter rains from the sky
Contaminated substance of life

Deception is key to enter the war
Many will suffer to settle the score
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Destroying lives, leaving nothing behind, nothing behind, nothing behind
