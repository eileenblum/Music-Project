Blood from the wounds of the one you call Christ
Fills the empty void; evil is alive
Feel it inside it's burning you away
Rotten to the core my body will decay
I see it in your eyes the fire's burning bright
Demons want you soul, they're hiding in the night
You're hoping to be saved but God is just a lie
Everyone obey now or you'll fucking die!

Shout at the devil, evil all around
Powerful and merciless, Satan wears his crown
In the final battle,  we must choose a side
Apocalyptic nightmare wont you run and hide?
Fighting till the end with Satan at my back  
Killing Gods angels an all out attack
Thrashing through this world spreading hate and fear
Into the gates of hell you see me disappear.

Vengeance rains
Highest in the end
And its gonna burn

You cant tame
The beast
He's far too strong

Choose a side
Walk with us and be proud
Or he'll suck out your soul

Hunt you down
Suck it out
Woah!!!!!!!

Marching to the fields, leaving all behind
The stench of burning flesh is making me go blind
Bliss and satisfaction is what we get for hell
Take away your soul, your just a empty shell
Kill with no remorse, a total genocide
Dance with the beast and no ones left alive  
You're hoping to be saved but God is just a lie
Everyone obey now or you'll fucking die!
