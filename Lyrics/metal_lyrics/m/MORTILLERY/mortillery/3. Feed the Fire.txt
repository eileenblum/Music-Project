Fire burning proud in our veins
We await the thrill
Feeding the darkness as we charge to the front
Blood turns to boil

We cannot change the fate of the night
Flames are burning hot
Turning our heads to the left and the right
We're aware that something's just not right

Some faces just don't belong
Their heat spreads like disease
And it's spreading fast

As the lion hunts the gazelle
I feel you creeping near
As my body embraces the ground
My vision is redeemed

You've fed the fire now you are committed to your fate
Adrenaline feeds my hunger now
You cannot escape the flame

Feed the fire
Feed the fire
Feed the fire
I've lost all control
Feed the fire
And burn 'em slow

Something snaps inside of me
My hell is breaking loose
Fire is unleashing
The pain that is hunting you

I light my torch; carburize the flame
Melting your eyeballs to your face
Hang you up high; waiting to die
I watch and eat whatever hit's the ground

Feed the fire

We cannot change the fate of the night
Flames are burning hot
Blood vessels dilate; animal thirst annihilates
I lick my bloody fists while you spit up crimson mist
