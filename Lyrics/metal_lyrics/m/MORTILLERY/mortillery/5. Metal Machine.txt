Lurking in a shadow not far from hell 
Silence in the bone yard before the storm
666 is the mark of the maker
Awake the metal monsters to begin domination

With nothing to loose
High tensile they stand
To battle they soar

Metal machine 
Peening your skull
It's an attack!!!

Eternal destruction they spare no lives
There is no hope total genocide
Metal machine with pride they ride
The toughest anvils bareback and free

Metal machine
Metal machine
Metal machine

Metal machine 
Metal machine
It's an attack!!!

Grinder to the faces of those who breathe
Chop sawing bones into little pieces
Pile drive the mess into human stew
Metal machines ruling the world

Metal machine
Metal machine
