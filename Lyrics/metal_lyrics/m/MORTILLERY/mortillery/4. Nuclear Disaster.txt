Nuclear disaster there's nowhere to hide
They're taking no chances, I'm losing my mind
Faster and faster I'm not looking back
Start the reactor It's time to attack!
So gather the troops and get ready to fight
Slashing the head of the queen in the night
The bombs are falling we ran out of time
Women and children the first ones to die!

Nuclear disaster,
Pile up the corpses get ready to die
Just a disaster, 
Start the reactor it's time to attack!

They scavenge the planet they're searching for gas
Killing for money, just sign on the line
Living and dying is just part of life
Give me a gun or just give me a knife
Filling your head with deception and hate
Don't try to run, it's just too late
Leaving behind all the humans remains
Mindless destruction all over the place.

Nuclear disaster,
Pile up the corpses, get ready to die
Just a disaster,
Start the reactor, it's time to attack!

[Solo]

[Repeat verse 1]

Nuclear disaster,
Pile up the corpses, get ready to die
Just a disaster,
Start the reactor, it's time to attack!
Nuclear disaster,
Start the reactor, it's time to attack!
