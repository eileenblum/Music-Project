Hell on earth the day has come
The beast is here don't try to run
Bodies decaying  nothing is left
Burning your churches; evil remains
The Army of Darkness is finally here
The Angel of Death is nothing to fear
Demonic forces are hard to resist
Feeding your hunger beyond the mist

Evil Will Rise
The Beast Has Survived
Ruling The Night
Taking Your Lives

Human survivors are taking a stand
Fighting together, they do all they can
Screaming for help they die one by one 
Your Life is over the damage is done
Evil is back now, the day has come
From hell they came to claim his throne
Demonic forces are hard to resist
Feeding your hunger beyond the mist

Evil Will Rise
The Beast Has Survived
Ruling The Night
Taking Your Lives
