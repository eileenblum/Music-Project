what if this all was the end 
and everything you've known was wrong
what if we'd all been convinced there was still room for the lost?

well if heaven's a mystery and god stopped believing
would we belong here anymore?
and if no one had answers and love had no meaning
then what the hell are we fighting for?
would we all just be strangers knocking on empty doors?
we'd all just be strangers knocking on empty doorsâ¦

was it a part of the plan to be the anchor of man?
what if the pages of time were full of fiction &amp; lies?
