I try to reach but I don't know why
you lie to me in the fear of the night
I'm not the one that you believe in
I can never put the fear inside of the pain

I'm not the savior that you've become
I'm not the fear, I'm the only one
I don't believe you're the only one

open your eyes! can you see I am inside of you?
can you feel me in your veins? watch me take it all awayâ¦

what's in your head? I don't know how
you scream at me without making a sound
and in this moment I am guiltless
but I promise you will feel this inside of your veins

you will love the way it feels to believe in nothing
you won't tell me when you've had enough, I'll tell you
