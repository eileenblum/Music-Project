take me under, it feels so good to be so low
and I can't get over, still trying to learn how to let you go

I can't go back when life did not exist
is this the end?
these highway lines &amp; dying rooms
they took the most out of me

hate you, hate me, sorry you got the best of me
break loose, I'm free: you won't be the one to bury me
the roles you play tell them you're okay
and kill the lights inside of me

all hail the queen!
it was you that sent me to this place
I'm just a passing shadow
so alone and I can't get close to you
