into the night burning so bright: no one is safe
into the fire feeling the high
well no one is safe, you're all the same

save me, something inside of me is changing
I feel it taking a part of me is slowly fading
the voice says found me another one

am I alone tonight, I hear a voice inside
it's preying on my mind: the fear has spoken

it's running through my veins, there's no saving me
can't hide to survive: the curse is coiling
