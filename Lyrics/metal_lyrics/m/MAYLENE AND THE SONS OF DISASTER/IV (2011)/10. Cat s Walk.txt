I got an itch burning up my skin, I feel the twitch now
and she stares at me, it's got me going
I can feel my blood boiling, yeah I know where she's going

way down back in the woods
when they find you were up to no good
caught a glimpse of the devil's eye
cause what I'm about to do is gonna make your momma cry

I feel the weight of my sins never gave the girl a chance
she struck me with those eyes
I took my lover with a hammer and now she doesn't matter

can you hear 'em coming now? yeah well here they come now
