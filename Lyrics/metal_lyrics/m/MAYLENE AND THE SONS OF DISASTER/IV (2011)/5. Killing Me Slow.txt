into the darkness dancing in flames
you and disaster are one and the same
professional victim, a beautiful thief
disguising with laughter what's dead underneath
born to be your enemy, hold onto what's left
dying to get rid of me, I've unlocked the door to hell

killing me slow
come on you're bleeding me out until there's nothing
don't let go, leave me cold, all night long
you love to hurt the ones that you love
you know you're killing me slow

innocent bastard so eager &amp; young
nothing can please you, it's never enough
so twist a little tighter cause I can still breathe
still waiting for the ending, my only relief
sleeping with the enemy ashamed of myself
dying to get rid of me, on and on it never ends

I just can't get you off my mind
everybody knows that I'm over you
I told myself a thousand times
everybody knows that I'm over you but me
everybody knows but me
it goes on and on, it never ends
