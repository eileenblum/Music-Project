well I just don't understand why you couldn't let it in
did I try my best for nothing, well I hope you got your fix

now I'm sick of all the reasons I just can't let it go
I get caught up in the feeling well by now you think I'd know

every time I fell into pieces 
you were always the last one found
all the moments I gave to fixing you 
was never enough somehow/were turning me inside out
so was it worth it, did I deserve it?

you hurt me cause it felt right, you hurt me for control
so I lied and said that I'm fine and I left you with the ropes
