turn the page and turn away
left the broken pieces where they lay
all the nights you laid awake
planning your escape and no one ever came
it's 2 AM and you missed the call
you've been climbing up and down the walls
for a friend that means the most
killing all your hopes of ever being more

whenever you're about to break you never have to be afraid
baby I will come for you, comfort you, carry you home
when you're in your darkest days, even when you lost your way
baby I will come for you, comfort you, carry you all the way

watch and wait, hesitate
the more I push the more you separate
I would walk the ends of Earth
just to set you free from the misery you've made

so you've made regrets that you can't forget
baby I will come for you, comfort you, carry you home
when you find yourself when there's no one else that's around
