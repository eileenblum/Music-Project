feels like I'm just walking blind
will these empty eyes see you again
mistakes sent you down that road
to face the nightmares on your own

running away from all the feelings inside
holding my heart in hopes that yesterday lied
I reach for hope and try to survive
because I'm taking on water tonight

looking back on all we had
did we ever even have a chance?
all the notes left by your side
are the reasons you can't sleep at night

trying to run down the days so I can find an end to the race
in time maybe I can find a better way to let it go
