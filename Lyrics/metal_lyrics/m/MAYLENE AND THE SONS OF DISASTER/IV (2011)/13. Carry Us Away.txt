[Deluxe Edition Bonus Track]dreams of swinging in the wind, the fear of what's beneath
has you shaking in your soul, the echo of defeat
the choice you make, this life to take, I swear it is the end
god will put us in our place, I swear it is the end

as the leaves start to change and the people stop to pray
end it all, end today and carry us away

when I'm gone I'll set you free from my disease
winter has come to take me home, death loves the weak
the choice I make, this life to take, I swear it is the end
god will put us in our place, I swear it is the end

give and sing oh praise the lord free from all his scars
your sons &amp; daughters will never know it's you that killed my heart
