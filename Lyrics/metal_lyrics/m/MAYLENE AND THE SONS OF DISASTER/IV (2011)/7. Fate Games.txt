I've been taking my chances, living life on the wire
and everything in between and it's caught up to me

come and take me away, angels singing my name
the final march still awaits, fate has taken its place

all my heroes are shadows
will our end be the same, will I follow their lead?
these walls are coming down, they're closing in on me

misery is all that I've found
there's no way out: it's coming down on me
