what have you done to make me completely lose my mind
I'm just a wreck without you, a requiem to lead the blind
innocence is walking out tonight
we're arm in arm and waiting here to die

lay your hands upon my shoulders, lay your hands across my brow
give me something to believe in right before you bring me down
make me want to sing with angels until my faith has all run out

no sympathy can find me
lost like a stranger in these clothes
all pump &amp; celebration, you lie enough to keep me close
oh scrapes and cuts like paper cups we fold
with looks that kill to heal the broken bones

I never wanted a war
I just wanted to believe in something more
just before I let go I need to know if you're close
