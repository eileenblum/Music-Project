We have all been cursed by the dark horse
Second chances few and far between
There's no halo hanging up above me
The ministry is equal to the disease

(Let's go down into the water)
Hear the choir on the shoreline sing
(The Mississippi ain't the river Jordan)
It won't wash me clean

Harvest moon hanging in the night sky
Medicine is flowing through my veins

(Take that anyway you want to)
I would consider it some sage advice
(There's a devil sitting on my shoulder)
He's speaking to me tonight

There is a struggle inside me, salvation keeps pulling me
I go back and forth and back again

A thousand pills won't cure my bad luck
I think this is who I was born to be
Another day standing at the crossroads
The holy ghost creeping up on me

(Let's go down into the water)
Hear the choir on the shoreline sing
(The Mississippi ain't the river Jordan)
It won't wash me clean

There is a struggle inside me, salvation keeps pulling me
I go back and forth and back again

(There's a revelation when you come undone and your
whole world comes unwound)

I'm unwound it keeps coming
(Every shadow comes from the sun)
So let the sun shine down upon me

Salvation keeps pulling me
I go back and forth and back again
Let the circle be unbroken swing low sweet chariot
Stuck in this broken life trying to be divine in the eyes of God
