Lying here in wait on my deathbed
Open air still fills my lungs
Not proud of everything I've done
But at least you know I did it well

(Feels like I'm walking on a tightrope)
Can't step on either side
I'm a hollow man but you still know who I am

I'm not going down until I get there
Break my back cause this is all I know
Still living life out on the edge
Still moving on the narrow path

For every dream I threw away on a dirt road
I've been dying way too long
I looked fate in the eye, kissed her good-bye
And I keep moving on
This mission ride is where I found my life
Say what you will, make no mistake
It's time we put up a fight
A hollow man but you still know who I am
