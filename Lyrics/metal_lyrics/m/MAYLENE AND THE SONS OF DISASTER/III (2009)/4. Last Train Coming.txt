I'm left standing alone
The last killer in the killing field
You said goodbye through gunshot fire
I'm still left here breathing

Sold on surviving but what's the cost?
You had your one shot and you took them all

"Woah"... Hear the last train coming
Roll the dice and spin the wheel
Hanging by a thread but at least I'm holding on

"Woah"... Full moon rising
Last dime in the wishing well
Fighting for my life because it's all that I have left

It's a resurrection
Siphon your blood straight from the ground
Vaccinated with the lead of a thousand rounds
Hell hath no fury?
Well, it does now!
Once I was lost but now I'm found
