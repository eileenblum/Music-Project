I'm still waiting for smoke to clear from this funeral fire
My ears are ringing, forced into what it means to be alive

Revenge is pounding, I feel it cold in my veins
You're gone but not forgotten

Familiars laid out on their backs
Parts of the whole are missing
But the black sheep left keeps it complete

(Will the twilight come as darkness
Creeps across the southern sky?)
Let it come down (tonight)

Don't count me out, this will not die
Heavenly Father's wrath and Hell is in my eyes
Rain down these shadows and regrets
Hear Angels singing while the Devil sits and smiles

Don't count me out, this will not die
Keep things right on course and leave no loose end untied

Tried to speak through your final breath, your final sighs
Just to tell you I can do this my weakness ain't my pride

Revenge is pounding, I feel it cold in my veins
You're gone but not forgotten

Now here I stand in front of you with a crooked heart, broken and unglued
I've got a new thing
I wrote it down in Alabama clav
A swan song for the rest of us
