Oh Death, has my time come?
You took my kind, left me behind, please take me home
I'm done with this old life please take me home
My lonely grave calls out to me
Heaven or Hell to call my own
I'm coming home

Who cheated Death cause death cheated me?
You stare into the face of God while man just stares at me
Lord strike me down!

This accident of surviving, you see me as a failure
I feel you looking down
Sing to my maker somewhere...
A bullet bears my name, come and take me now

For every shot that rang out not one was your sound
Not entitled to what you felt owed to you
Condemned to see another sun

Matriarch abandoned
Commend her spirit to your hallowed ground
The light of understanding
The silence when you're not around
Holy Father I pray
You wrap my brothers in your warm embrace
When my time comes I won't go quiet
Even in death I'm second place
