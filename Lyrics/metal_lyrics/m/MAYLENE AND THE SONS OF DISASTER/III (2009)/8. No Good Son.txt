I'm the first man up to tow the line
Shot down. Light up whiskey bottles of turpentine
Written out a eulogy for anyone who tries to cross my path
I fill the ranks of saints and sinners, the futures and the aftermaths

Say a prayer for me God knows I can't control myself
A new storms coming, and it won't be long
Mama said I was a no good son
I think it's time for me to make my mark
Headlines and police cars...
A tragedy from the start

I'm the poison in the well
I'm the fruit rotting on the vine
You still don't believe me?
Out of many will come one
Let the gates of hell swing wide for me

Say a prayer for me God knows I can't control myself
A new storms coming, and it won't be long
Mama said I was a no good son
I think it's time for me to make my mark
Headlines and police cars...
A tragedy from the start

It's a new religion come get in line
Hellhounds are barking and they're close behind
A promise land awaits this odd man out and its all mine
You just lead and I will follow

Say a prayer for me God knows I can't control myself
A new storms coming, and it won't be long
Mama said I was a no good son
I think it's time for me to make my mark
Headlines and police cars...
A tragedy from the start
