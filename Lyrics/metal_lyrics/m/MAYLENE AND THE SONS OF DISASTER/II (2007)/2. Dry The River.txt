Saw my life flash before my eyes.
I've kissed the dark horse.
Random lines not sure if they came out right.
This is going so wrong
But you just can't stop laughing when you feel the fall
So head on down my world is ending

I'll take back everything if you'll stay by my side
Cause I'm told the river went dry
Believe me when I say that you'll see greater days
I didn't want to leave

Listen close to the other side
Like a storm on a summer's night
What's more to hate the thoughts or the mind?
This moments taking me. I'm falling... Fallen

I'll take back everything if you'll stay by my side
Cause I'm told the river went dry
Believe me when I say that you'll see greater days
I didn't want to leave

Been uneasy so long I feel we're not alone
Someone needs to speak to you it feels they're inside me
Writing from the lost 30's
Take caution if you chose to read
These are not my beliefs
Writing from the lost 30's... We're not alone

I'll take back everything if you'll stay by my side
Cause I'm told the river went dry
Believe me when I say that you'll see greater days
I didn't want to leave
