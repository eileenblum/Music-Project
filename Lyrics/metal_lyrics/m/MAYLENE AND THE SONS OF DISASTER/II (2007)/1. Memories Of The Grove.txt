Time was a drifter, almost tasted the wrath.
Bitter so easy undiscovered.
Stranded and I'm frightened to step out
Change moving my way, I won't let it take me
I feel I'm spinning.
just wanted something to believe under it all
Imagination is reality.
Too much to quick so I back up and tell you this.
This is feeling hopeless at it's finest.
Just wanted to believe. It's somewhere I'd rather be.

I thought we'd make it to the end.
Brick Walker don't leave me stranded.

I think they might take it all away.
Glance through a crack
It seems the scavengers are asleep.
Thank God grace has come my way.
Tomorrow hope awaits living closer to the end.

I thought we'd make it to the end.
Brick Walker don't leave me stranded.
