I'm sick of standing still.
Searching for answers to random things.

So I draw a conclusion:
I'll never stop believing, but today I'll stop the pleasing.
Lay it all down and the judging will come.
To people like you we'll never be good enough
MOMMA DIDN'T RAISE NO FOOL.

Steady Steady and I move
Cause you know Momma didn't raise no fool!
Please tell me again why you seem familiar?
I've seen your likes before hangin' round these junctions.
That's where the good Lord reigns, and he ain't going no where.
Momma didn't raise no fool. Steady Steady and I move.
Searching for answers, to random things.

So I draw a conclusion:
My mind has fallen far from the tree.
Lay it all down, and the judging will come for people like you.
Cause you know Momma didn't raise no fool!
Come on now!
