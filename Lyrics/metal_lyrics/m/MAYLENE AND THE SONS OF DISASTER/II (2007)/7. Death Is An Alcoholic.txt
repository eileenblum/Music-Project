Pacing back and forth it's shut. But I keep making sure.
Put the hurt at some ease
Keep thinking how we've helped each other lose our face.
It's closer than you think.

Empty moving, place to place
Broken on the inside is my purpose in life.

I'm heading home alone. Living out this call.
Don't give up your stronger than you look
Just know I've loved you both.

When you fall apart you tend to change.
I won't be breathing for too long.
There's more to me than this moment, I do believe.
There's more to me than this moment, feeling more than I can see.

Empty moving, place to place
Broken on the inside is my purpose in life.

I'm heading home alone. Living out this call.
Don't give up your stronger than you look
Just know I've loved you both.

And keep holding on, even after I'm gone.
In this you can always find me, always find me.
You're stronger than you look.
Believe that things are getting better.
All these things are getting better
You're stronger than you look.
