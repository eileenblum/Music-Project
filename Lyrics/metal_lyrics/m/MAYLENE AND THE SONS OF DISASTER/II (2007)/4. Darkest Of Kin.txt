All of you go about your day,
never truly living
Walking so close to death lets me know what it means to be alive.
It's where I find my high
Terror like this world has never seen
Look in my eyes, see what I've done
Always on the move, hell comes along.

STAND UP, FISTS OUT - I WOULDN'T HAVE IT ANY OTHER WAY!
STAND UP, FISTS OUT - THIS IS THE REAL THING!

Been to the midwestern lights, fed on the fear in her eyes.
Family's begging for their lives but, giving in's no trait or mine.
Hit your knees and pray, pray you never see this face
I've been called the hypocrite to bring down

STAND UP, FISTS OUT - THIS IS THE REAL THING!
STAND UP, FISTS OUT - I WOULDN'T HAVE IT ANY OTHER WAY!

Baby I'm bad, I'm the fear in your eyes.
That hate in your heart has been branded with my name

You oughta been warned
Not to cross the tracks to my side of town
Dark clouds will follow
GOD MAKE ME PAY LIKE THE DEVIL I AM
