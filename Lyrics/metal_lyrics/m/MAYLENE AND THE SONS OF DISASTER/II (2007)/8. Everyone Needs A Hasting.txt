Put a notch on this belt when I leave a toll is taken
My head is traveling way too fast.
I gotta slow down for the sake of overlooking
The silent rituals need to be caressed
let me stay here and hide my eyes from the bitter world.
LORD KNOWS I'M NOT READY TO SHINE.
Let me stay here and save my breath for the coming flood.
The clocks ticking wearing out the time.

So obsess a little, it's coming fast.
You better hope that you're ready.
So obsess a little, cause when it's passed

I plan to be left standing.
Let me at the cruel outside chances are turning over.
The vessel is on it's way.

My wrist won't talk, I know I've tried.
LET THE MOVEMENT TAKE YOU BY THE HEART.
The closer I get, the louder the lifeline.
LET THE MOVEMENT TAKE YOU BY THE HEART.
The closer I get, the calmer inside.
