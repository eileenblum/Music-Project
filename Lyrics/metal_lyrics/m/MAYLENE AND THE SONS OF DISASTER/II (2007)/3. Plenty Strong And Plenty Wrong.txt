Coming back after a long time gone.
I'm just another walking dead.
Deadlines tell me to write
and it feels so cold at home.
Everyone has learned to live without me

I'm feeling second place
This hole is right where it needs to be
It's not a static pace
Just a little kink in the year...

This isn't what I expected always letting you down
I can't remember that wrong turn
Try not to feel it, cause I know I'm your mistake
Those excuses are hiding us.

I'm feeling second place
This hole is right where it needs to be
It's not a static pace
Just a little kink, just a little kink

Don't bother askin' where I've been,
Or expect me to go back again
Those memories never were...

I'm feeling second place
This hole is right where it needs to be
It's not a static pace
Just a little kink, just a little kink
