Another recovering dependent lost on your shift, the reasons still remain blank.
These pages I hoped to never write.
Another ordinary panic day involved in past stories.
My best didn't come close.
In love with the past I hate more than you.
Wasted away for a while at this farewell.
Take me home to southern remedies come on baby.
And for all your hate just blame me.
Just like your love by the beach.
On your way to the top.
Always had a feeling you seemed like the perfect enemy.
I'd wish this all go away.
I'll do what it takes to burn yesterday.
When you're blue and beautiful you'll see what you've become.
