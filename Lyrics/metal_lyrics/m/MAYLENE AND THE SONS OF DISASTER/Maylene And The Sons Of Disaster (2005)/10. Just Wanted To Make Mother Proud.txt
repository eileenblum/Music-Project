I couldn't catch my breath laying there.
Fading in and out and I can remember mother telling me,
"Home is where the heart is," but my heart has long been black.
Coming to the end of my road, but I never wanted it like this, not like this.
Looking over there lay mother and louder and louder I screamed her name,
But she wouldn't say anything.
This was all too familiar, but I've never been on this side of things.
Memories of my brothers racing through my mind, and soon I know we'll all be together again.
The sound of gun fire so loud and rapid, but it seems to be so quiet around me.
And out of nowhere I feel peace cover me.
I reach down and reload my ticket home.
The taste of cold steel on my lips, and a second later silence fills the January air.
They carried us off and laid us in the city to let the public see of our defeat
But we still live on, we live on.
Years may pass but the story will be told of Mother Maylene and us her sons of disaster.
