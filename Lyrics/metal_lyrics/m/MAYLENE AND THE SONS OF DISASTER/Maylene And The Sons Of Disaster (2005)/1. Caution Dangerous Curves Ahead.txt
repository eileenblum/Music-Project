The ones that carry never back down.
I want to be the bullet that brings you to your knees.
You ran, I'm still swinging.
Feel your insides as they grow weak.
Forgive me for this on the other side I won't hurt you.
Angels a stage that never ending hell in your eyes.
Your truth those secrets your regret, but you always go back.
Give it sometime sweet one he'll show your soul for all who believe to see.
Your wrongs will not go away.
Hard times are coming.
You wanna feel this.
Come a little closer it's time you see these scars a true friend takes without giving.
Was it worth the while burning us up.
When the oath that bound us was more than words.
Heretics claiming the savior as their own.
I have the book and it's warned me of you.
And you think hurting me really helped.
Believe me it's coming around.
When you panic tonight just think of me.
