You've ruined all my endings.
Stay safe I'll drown in time.
The abuse had you and it was long overdue to let go.
This love division casting stones fighting for you.
I don't think you heard me I said fighting for you.
So close to commitment did I miss out or make it away just in time.
We don't care they say call it off, and what's said by many goes.
I feel abandoned, but it feels good.
No screams from you this time.
Stronger and better without you.
Face the facts I ain't coming back.
