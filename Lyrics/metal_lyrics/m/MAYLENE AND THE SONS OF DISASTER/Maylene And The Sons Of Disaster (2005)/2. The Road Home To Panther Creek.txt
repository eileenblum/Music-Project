Here we go again.
I believe you, but I've always been one to take advantage of.
If the blinders where just gone would you then feel Jesus.
You've seen miracles I know you.
Faith comes like the waves.
Not much for leaders to little control.
And the joy is all material real as you want to believe.
Now is not the time for reality.
Salvation just an emotion like the one you're riding now.
The foundation was never there.
Turn on burn not the most peaceful thing, but truth is out of my hands.
Love is never easy.
Not too attractive for the weak.
