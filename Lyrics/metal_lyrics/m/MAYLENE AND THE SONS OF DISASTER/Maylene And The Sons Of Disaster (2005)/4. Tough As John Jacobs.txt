Always knew the pyro would come out in you.
Just took some patience then again I'm always right.
You'd think you were dying so you drift it passes time.
Brings out the lesser in life.
All is mine in the closed eyes life.
Frustration's about to break the silence.
The dark so nice when twitches progress.
I make the calls sweat pouring by thousands.
Set up the lights alarms should not come like this.
All is mine in the closed eyes life.
Frustration's about to break the silence.
I'm not ready to part come on you can't leave me like this.
Make your move fast so reliving this will last through your passing away.
Your passing away.
All is mine in the closed eyes life.
Frustration's about to break the silence.
