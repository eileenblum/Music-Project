So this is what we've become?
Strangers in this world alone.
There will be a day when our paths converge and I will never speak with you.

With all this hatred, consumed by grief.
Led to walk the world in my own disbelief.

Basking in darkness, expelling the light.
It's not on the outside, it's held within.

These are the masks we've created!

As I rip off this face, exposing disgracing.
As I walk out this place, without a trace.
As I rip off my face. I'm such a disgrace.
