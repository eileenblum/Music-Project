Arise my child
You are my pawn.
We will begin the path to your self-destruction now.

"Forgive me father for I've betrayed mankind. I have deceived the light, and there's no going back."

Look into the void of my eyes.
Do you see the souls of the damned?

The voices are calling out to me.
As I travel down this path of (treachery, misery)

A bed of flowers lays for thee
For you've deceived your family.
Devils grasp, he's got a hold on me.
Body left to the Templar
For no one remembers.
No one remembers your name

As the shroud envelopes
The body remains
You only have yourself to blame
