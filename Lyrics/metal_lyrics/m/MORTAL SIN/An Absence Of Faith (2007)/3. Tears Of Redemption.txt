Orphaned children everywhere
In the mosques of Lebanon
Families gathered round in prayer
But the chance for peace is gone
20 years of bloodshed
Victims of the war
13 brothers all shot dead
But your faith is not secured

Can you feel all the racial tension?
Can you feel the violent hate
As you pray for the tears of redemption
You pray but it's all too late

The misery of the Blood Death Hatred
As you're thrown into the fire,
As you fear for the mortal slaughter
They're branding you a liar

Can you believe the gall?
They've tried to claim the wall!
That once was built for all!

They're trying to deceive me believe me
They think they can control me console me
Islam has betrayed me repaid me
Your god has abused me confused me

Our lives, your fate
Are bound by illusions you create
Your seeds of hate
Your god, your creed
Bound &amp; tied by the hands of greed
You won't succeed

[Chorus:]
You amuse me, You abuse me
I refuse to be a Muslim
You forsake me, you can't break me
You won't make me be a Muslim

Your rules, your race
Are drawn to the power of the holy place
You breed disgrace
We hear your cries
You feel the need to criticize
You need your lies

[Chorus:]
You amuse me, You abuse me
I refuse to be a Muslim
You forsake me, you can't break me
You won't make me be a Muslim

Your war -- your fear, is haunting me
Your war -- your fear, is haunting me
Your war -- your fear, is haunting me
Your war -- your fear, is haunting me

Can you believe the gall?
They've tried to claim the wall!
That once was built for all!
