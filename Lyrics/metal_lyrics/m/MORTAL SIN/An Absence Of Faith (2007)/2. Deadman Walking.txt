The symptoms are showing
Diseases are growing
Psychosis is playing on your mind
Your skin cells are shedding
Bacteria is spreading
It's warfare so kill the mastermind

[Pre-Chorus:]
Can you hear the warning?
Can you hear the warning?
Can you hear the warning -- this time?

[Chorus:]
Humankind never heeds the warning
Realise that the day is dawning
Outside - the dogs are talking
Outside -- A dead man walking

There's no use in praying
Your sanity is fraying
You know there's no chance to find a cure
The Government is lying
While millions lay dying
Your future has not quite been assured

[Pre-Chorus:]
Can you hear the warning?
Can you hear the warning?
Can you hear the warning -- this time?

[Chorus:]
Humankind never heeds the warning
Realise that the day is dawning
Outside the dogs are talking
Outside A dead man walking

[Chorus:]
Humankind never heeds the warning
Realise that the day is dawning
Outside - The dogs are talking
Outside -- A dead man walking

Deadman -- walk the earth
Deadman -- walk the earth
Deadman -- walk the earth
Deadman -- walk the earth
They got their eyes on you
