Satisfied that you lied
The people want you crucified
Won't you tell the truth?
On the side I'm terrified
Of all the rules that you've implied
Won't you tell the truth?

[Chorus:]
No need to make broken promises
No need to tell those lies
No need to make broken promises

You can't ignore the deaths of war
They're picking bodies off the floor
Won't you call a truce?
And furthermore you've closed the door
On all the troops that you withdraw
Won't you call a truce?

[Chorus:]
No need to make broken promises
No need to tell these lies
No need to make broken promises

I know you can't keep making these promises
I know you can't keep telling those lies
I know you're just the American president
It's not your son who regretfully dies
Why can't you see what you need to see
Why can't you be what we need you to be

I know you can't keep making these promises
I know you can't keep telling those lies

[Chorus:]
No need to make broken promises ("No need! No Need!")
No need to tell these lies ("No Lies! No Lies!")
No need to make broken promises ("No need! No Need!")
No need to tell those -- tell those lies!
