The air that I breathe is suffocating me
These things that I do, confusing me
The eyes of the blind are staring at my soul
My time on this world has taken its toll

[Chorus:]
How far -- Can you go before you break?
Can your mind and body take?
If you make just one mistake?
How far -- Can you go before you break?
Can your mind and body take?
If you make just one mistake?
Before the Bough begins to Break

This life that I lead is aggravating me
These thoughts in my head confusing me
This switch in my brain is turned to overload
I'm going insane -- I'm about to explode

[Chorus:]
How far -- Can you go before you break?
Can your mind and body take?
If you make just one mistake?
How far -- Can you go before you break?
Can your mind and body take?
If you make just one mistake?
Before the Bough begins to Break

Did you get what you want?
Did you get what you need?
Did you get what you want?
Did you get what you need?

[Chorus:]
How far -- Can you go before you break?
Can your mind and body take?
If you make just one mistake?
How far -- Can you go before you break?
Can your mind and body take?
If you make just one mistake?
How far -- Before the bough breaks?

Every time you look at me I feel like I'm the enemy
How far? Before the bough breaks?
I don't think we'll make it through, you can't see my point of view
How far? Before the bough breaks?
Always criticising me sapping all my energy
How far? Before the bough breaks?
I wish that it was yesterday -- same old shit everyday
How far? Before the bough breaks?
