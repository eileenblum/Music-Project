I'll show you something, but you won't see
I'll give you nothing, nothing for free
You crossed the dark side, you sold your soul
No turning back now, you've dug your hole

[Chorus:]
Out of the Darkness, and into the black
Out of the Darkness, and into the black

You have the power, inside your mind
To make a difference, to all mankind
Your time is ticking, you beat your drum
They criticize you, what you've become

[Chorus:]
Out of the Darkness, and into the black
Out of the Darkness, and into the black

Can you be what you wanna be
Can you forget your past
Are you all that you oughta be
Take you into the black
Can you be what you wanna be
Can you forget your past
Are you all that you oughta be
Take you into the black

You make decisions, you must decide
The force of evil, You can't deny
The truth is out there, you force your hand
You must believe it, to make a stand

[Chorus:]
Out of the Darkness, and into the black
Out of the Darkness, and into the black
