Staring at the mirror
Can you see what the mirror sees?
Where is the reflection?
A blank mind staring back at me
Watching the reaction
Trying to fake the reality
Missing in the action
I need someone to set me free

[Chorus:]
I'm lost - within my mind, within my head, within myself
Lost - within my mind, within my head, within myself

Looking through a window
Faceless strangers watching you
Staring at the victim
Trying to change my point of view
Feeling like a failure
Those who just don't have a clue
Actions of a saviour
Heartbeat kick start overdue

[Chorus:]
I'm lost - within my mind, within my head, within myself
Lost - within my mind, within my head, within myself
Lost, Lost Within
Lost, Lost within

I'm losing my mind, don't believe what I said
I'm losing the things that live inside of my head
So give me a needle but don't give me no drug
Don't give me your freedom I'd rather be dead

Picking up the pieces
Pull this dagger from my chest
Looking like a newsflash
Put this dead man to the test
Asking all the questions
Why my body's being possessed
Finding out the answers
Lay my body down to rest

[Chorus:]
I'm lost - within my mind, within my head, within myself
Lost - within my mind, within my head, within myself
Lost, Lost Within
Lost, Lost within
Lost within my head
