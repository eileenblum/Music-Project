All of my life you dared to abuse me
Drowning my dignity
How could you leave me scared and defenceless?
Leaving a scar on my memory

[Chorus:]
Say your prayers
Good luck to your health
He who dares -- Is hanging himself
Say your prayers
Good luck to your health
He who dares -- Is hanging himself

No use pretending you never hurt me
12 years of misery
Counting my bruises mending my fractures
You say it's nothing well I disagree

[Chorus:]
Say your prayers
Good luck to your health
He who dares -- Is hanging himself
Say your prayers
Good luck to your health
He who dares -- Is hanging himself

This morning I woke and I had to react
I can't take it no more I decided to act
With my hand on my gun I walked up to his bed
I pulled back on the trigger the fucker is dead

The fucker is dead -- I did what you said -- Get out of my head
The fucker is dead -- I did what you said -- Get out of my head

[Chorus:]
Say your prayers
Good luck to your health
He who dares -- Is hanging himself
Say your prayers
Good luck to your health
He who dares -- Is hanging himself
Say your prayers
