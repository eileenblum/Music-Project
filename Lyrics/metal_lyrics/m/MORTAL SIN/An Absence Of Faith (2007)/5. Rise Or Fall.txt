You can walk the streets, or live the dream
Who's to blame for your low self esteem?
You can live your life or take it away
No one will notice if you live another day
Live another day

[Chorus:]
Rise or Fall -- You don't have to be another brick in the wall
Rise or Fall -- Take it or leave it if you're sick of it all
Rise or Fall -- You're learning to run before you're learning to crawl
Rise or Fall -- Just rise or fall

You can hide your face, or face your fear
Who will notice if you disappear?
You've lived your life under scrutiny
There's no use fighting for your destiny
For your destiny

[Chorus:]
Rise or Fall -- You don't have to be another brick in the wall
Rise or Fall -- Take it or leave it if you're sick of it all
Rise or Fall -- You're learning to run before you're learning to crawl
Rise or Fall -- Just rise or fall

[Chorus:]
Rise or Fall -- You don't have to be another brick in the wall
Rise or Fall -- Take it or leave it if you're sick of it all
Rise or Fall -- You're learning to run before you're learning to crawl
Rise or Fall -- Just rise or fall

Rise or Fall
