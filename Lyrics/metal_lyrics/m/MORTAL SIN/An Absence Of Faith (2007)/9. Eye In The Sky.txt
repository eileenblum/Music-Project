Blood on your hands
Fear in your eyes
Your retina scans have been recognised
Your running for miles
They're running your files
Your DNA has been analysed

[Pre-Chorus:]
Can we trust politicians won't misuse their trust
Mass surveillance they all know who we are
You can't pretend anymore
Keep your mouth shut you know you've broken the law

[Chorus:]
Eye in the sky
Eye in the sky
Big brother big brother discovers your lie
Eye in the sky
Eye in the sky
The political machine has recorded your lie

Blood on the streets
A young girl cries
No one is safe unless a minster dies
The governments rules
The governments fools
The CIA has you terrorised

[Pre-Chorus:]
Can we trust politicians won't misuse their trust
Mass surveillance they all know who we are
You can't pretend anymore
Keep your mouth shut you know you've broken the law

[Chorus:]
Eye in the sky
Eye in the sky
Big brother big brother discovers your lie
Eye in the sky
Eye in the sky
The political machine has recorded your lie

Hey you! On camera two!
Why do you think the camera's pointed at you?
Can't you see on camera three
A dirty politician doesn't matter to me

[Chorus:]
Eye in the sky
Eye in the sky
Big brother big brother discovers your lie
Eye in the sky
Eye in the sky
The political machine has recorded your lie
