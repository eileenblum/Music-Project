Mistress in metal rules the night
Her body's in command
Driven by lust, a bestial sight
Crushed cities of the land
Perverted mind, can't be tame
Smell leather in the air
Gleaming studs, hell's the blame
We all know who cares

Teasing our minds, this isn't for real
I know I must be asleep
Trying your best to touch and feel
Thrusting you into the deep
The world turned black the earth stood still
The mistress in metal is here
She treads her ground she wants to kill
The world's in the grip of her fear

The play is complete, shout it aloud
Hail the mighty king
Shriekings of flesh, lie dormant and proud
This is a mortal sin
Agony and pain, incisions flow red
Wishing it was a dream
Taste my sweat, almost dead
Give it a final scream...
