Screaming for mercy your blood's running cold
You worship the devil your soul has been sold
Give birth to the beast at the black witches feast
Give rise to your son he's a star in the east

[Chorus]

Blood, death, hatred - sacrificial right
Blood, death, hatred - murder in the night

Prepare for the jackal with bloodlusting hate
Your mind has been tortured your body's been raped
Your world's turning to blackness, your soul has been burned
Give praise to your god cause the Master's returned

[Repeat chorus]

You battle temptation your freewill is gone
Subside to the devil his power's too strong
You fight for your kingdom you've people to save
Send them to heaven or send them to their grave

[Repeat chorus]
