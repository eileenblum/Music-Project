Mayhemic destruction, death's the call
Crushing with abduction, wants to kill them all
Eternal devastation, oozing with pain
Manifestation, live for Satan's reign

Mayhemic destruction!

Total distortion, blood from your ears
Living with abortion, memories disappear
Facing your destiny living just to die
Christian immunity reaching for the sky

Mayhemic destruction!

People fleeing cause they're scared
Yet no place to go
Fire and brimstone in your blood
Fuck who told you so
Take your heart, send it down to a firey death
Got no chance to live, we drain out your last breath
You were warned of this
Your unholy book
Devouring vermin destroy a corpse
Dare you take a look
Armageddon went too far
What is left of life
Pity up there in heaven
You missed your cut of a knife
