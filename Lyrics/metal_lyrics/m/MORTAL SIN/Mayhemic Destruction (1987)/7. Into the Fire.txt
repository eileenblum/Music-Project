Calling all gods from heaven and hell
Return to the chapel and ring the bell
Punish all the sinners, cleanse their souls
Drive the evil spirits back into their holes

[Chorus]

Into the fire, the bodies burn
Into the fire, there's no return
Feel the heat, the temperatures rise
Feel the heat, it's in your eyes

Raised from the dead, your body's alive
Escaped from the torture, you have survived
Your face is scarred to skin and bone
Scream for mercy with a howling moan

[Repeat chorus]

Calling all sinners who paid the price
Return to the chapel your sacrifice
You fought the black spirits, you thought you'd won
The battle of evil has just begun

[Repeat chorus]
