His eyes burn like fire, they burn like the sun
He's calling you a liar, he knows that you're the one
The judge will pass his sentence, he'll sacrifice your soul
He won't give you repentance, he'll send you to the gallows pole

Subjected to a means of eternal misery
You've fallen in the shadow of a public mutiny
You listen to your followers, you hear them start to cry
Shouting strains of madness they want you to die

[Chorus:]
Liar - they'll drive you insane
Liar - they've caught you again
Liar - they want you to die
Liar - should never have lied

You struggle for your sanity your brain's about to blow
You want to hear your punishment you think that you should know
They'll pierce you with the sword of death they'll push it through your side
Now everybody's laughing you took them for a ride

[Repeat chorus]

You're entering the gates above they'll tell you to return
Send you down to the fires of Hell and let your body burn
Stay down there with all your mates and lie yourselves to death
Fill yourselves with laughter and draw another breath

[Repeat chorus]
