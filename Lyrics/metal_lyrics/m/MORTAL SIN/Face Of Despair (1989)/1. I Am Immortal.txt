I fear no foe, I haven no fear
See me laughing when death comes near
Pain is sweet and life is cold
There's no repenting when you grow old
I seek revenge, my master's hell
Crumbled ruins as his kingdom fell
Must take your life, to set me free
Turn your back on immortality

I am Immortal got no right to die
I am Immortal no one can deny
I am Immortal 'til the end of time
I am Immortal

I have no guilt there is no law
My blackened heart's rotting at the core
Break the rules a crying shame
Nothing matters 'cos it's just a game
Take your aim, the life you choose
Just one chance if you win or lose
Fight 'til death the battle is won
Revenge is mine the superior one

I am Immortal got no right to die
I am Immortal no one can deny
I am Immortal 'til the end of time
I am Immortal

Take you chances if you dare
Time will break your evil stare
Legend says it's you or I
Destroy the myth and you will die

See the sound of slashing swords
Piercing through your heart
The screaming of the civil lords
Wash away the weeping wounds, tearing you apart
The weaving of the evil hordes
The Master will scorn you, he'll even forlorn you
He'll give you a price to pay
There's nothing he gave you, no reason to save you
Have mercy you bastard, take your soul away

Traumatic tales of torrid tears, chopping off your head
Trapped into a terror state
Forcing off those fractured fears, finding out your dead
Forget about your future fate
The Master has cursed you, his spell has dispersed you
He gave you the price to pay
Revenge has been won and a new life begun
'Cos I am immortal
