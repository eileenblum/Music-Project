No one finds their peace of mind
Manipulation of mankind
An indication of the blind
There's no answer you will find

Freedom of choice freedom of mind
Freedom of speech don't waste our time
We know what we want we'll take it in our stride

Money making is what it takes
It's your decision there's no mistakes
Hear the voices crying out
You'll see the poor go without

Don't ask them the reasons why
They've all the power money can buy
Don't ask them to split their share
Don't waste your time 'cos they don't care

Destitution is not a crime
Revolution's a waste of time
Administrations enjoy the ride
The government is on their side

Don't ask them the reason why
They've all the power money can buy

The rich get richer, the poor stay poor
The rich get richer always wanting more
The rich get richer the poor stay in poverty
Why did they decide to call it a democracy
