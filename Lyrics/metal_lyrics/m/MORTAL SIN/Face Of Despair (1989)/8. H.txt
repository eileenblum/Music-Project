Trying hard to survive the nuclear devastation
Under shelter for a year maybe more
Scrounging for food that may have survived the source of radiation
Amidst the darkness lying below the floor
The tragedy of Hiroshima, the killing of a nation
A logical way to end a bloody war
The lone survivors all together in a congregation
Praying for mercy behind a leadened door

Sheltered, sheltered from the storm, shattered

The kamikazes and the Maxis suffering condemnation
Wondering if they'll ever stay alive
Looking for ways to pacify the constant aggravation
Under pressure to let them all survive
The Tragedy of Hiroshima, the killing of a nation
Hundreds of thousands of people left to die
Nuclear clouds surround the tombs with little admiration
The children in the shelter start to cry

Sheltered, sheltered from the storm, shattered

Taking away the prisoners, taking away their lives
Taking away their freedom
They won't survive the shelters, they won't survive the pain
They won't survive the memories
Crying out for peace, crying in disgust
Crying out in ignorance
Fighting s losing battle, fighting s lost cause
Fighting against the hypocrisy of fighting a nuclear war
