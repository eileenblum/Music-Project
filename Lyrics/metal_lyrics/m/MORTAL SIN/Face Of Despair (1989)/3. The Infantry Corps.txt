March through the mist when the armies enlist
All the children who fight for their older
They storm through the night in a half state of fright
Their future is strapped to their shoulder
They battle their shadows on the wall
They jump when the major gives the call
They fight for their freedom, their country don't need'em
The war will eventually kill'em all

They live for tomorrow in agony and sorrow
And learning that the strongest will survive
They're dodging for cover, they scream for their mother
They struggle just to keep themselves alive

The children of the infants corps
Don't know what they've been fighting for
They're only young, they know they've paid the price
Their innocence unselfishness
And all in all defencelessness
The government has made the sacrifice

Who's responsible for the Infantry Corps
Who's responsible for the Infantry Corps

Young bodies are lying everywhere
Lifeless but no one seems to care
Hooray for the children, the country just killed'em
The blame's here for everyone to share

The children of the infants corps
Don't know what they've been fighting for
They're only young, they know they've paid the price
Their innocence unselfishness
And all in all defencelessness
The government has made the sacrifice

The Infantry, the Infantry,
You're in the Infantry Corps,
The Infantry
