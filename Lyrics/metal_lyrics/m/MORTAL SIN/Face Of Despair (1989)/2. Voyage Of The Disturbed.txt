Dreams, looking for a sign of intelligent life
Screams, trying to realise the American plight
With dignity and pride, the government denied
Pushing to the limits 'cos they're never satisfied
Please, look at what you've done

Voyage of the disturbed
Challenging another world, voyage of the disturbed
Voyage of the disturbed
Challenging a future world, voyage of the disturbed

Fear, succumbing to the needs of political might
Sheer, astronomical pressure as you hit the speed of light
Another seven faces, another misery
No one seems to realise the fate of history
Please, look at what you've done

Voyage of the disturbed
Challenging another world, voyage of the disturbed
Voyage of the disturbed
Challenging a future world, voyage of the disturbed
