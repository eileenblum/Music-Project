I'll show you something, but you won't see
I'll give you nothing, nothing for free
You crossed the darkside, you sold your soul
No turning back now, you've dug your hole

Out of the darkness, into the black
Out of the darkness, into the black

You have the power inside your mind
To make a difference to all mankind
Your time is ticking, you beat your drum
They criticize you, what you've become

Out of the darkness into the black
Out of the darkness into the hahahahaha

Can you be what you wanna be?
Can you forget the past?
Are you all that you oughta be?
Take you into the black
Can you be what you wanna be?
Can you forget the past?
Are you all that you oughta be?
Take you into the black

You make decisions, you must decide
The force of evil you can't deny
The truth is out there you force your hand
You must believe it to make a stand

Out of the darkness, into the black
Out of the darkness, into the black
