Sound of bombs runs through the air
In the streets of Lebanon
Hate filled soldiers everywhere
The troops of Babylon

Bloodstains on the footpath
Madness on the ground
Senseless forms of bloodbath
As you hear the bugles sound

Dodging the machine gun fire
Fighting for their lives
Killing with their hearts desire
No one can survive

[Chorus:]
The battle of Lebanon - a killer
The battle of Lebanon - destruction

Trenches filled with Muslim guards
Rifles set to fire
Left the enemy battle scarred
Terrorist guns for hire

[Repeat Chorus]

Planning all the strategies to break the enemies back
Send out the kamikazes on a suicide attack
The Muslims and the Christians are fighting for their rights
Take the war of Lebanon to masochistic heights

Massacre and bloodshed are just a part of war
The children are defenseless and washed up on the floor
Aerial destruction and submarines below
Shooting guided missiles to give the final blow
