[Eftichiou / Carawana / Hughes / Sly]

So fucking easy to believe it
Too hard to comprehend
How you sleaze with perfect ease
To the constant changing tides of trend
Breathing carbon copy
From the pages of a glossy magazine
Prototype to prototype, addicted to the norm
In a crazy world of mad machines

Itâs not easy staring at a T.V.
To prove to me that moneyâs got no soul
Hoping for a blind spot, gotta fill a time slot
Collecting cash wrapped in a bullshit role
Have to laugh when Iâm watching
Those perfect families shining on the screen
Prototype to prototype, distorted in its form
In this unreal world of dreams

Inside, outside, inside out
Who knows where theyâre going
If they donât know what theyâre doing
If they donât know what theyâre about
Inside, outside, inside out
Is someone gonna sell me what Iâm about ?

Never claimed to be the one and only
An original non emulated style
Prototype to prototype, canât differ anyway
When thereâs passion and fame all the while
Never easy to be original
The evil of an influence can often sway the mind
Of what you feel, and what you see
In this world of identity

Inside, outside, inside out
Who knows where theyâre going
If they donât know what theyâre doing
If they donât know what theyâre about
Inside, outside, inside out
Is someone gonna sell me what Iâm about ?

Inside, outside, inside out
Who knows where theyâre going
If they donât know what theyâre doing
If they donât know what theyâre about

Stylistic addiction, so set in its way
Prototype people wonât differ, canât change
Taught how to lie, act and to breathe, thatâs not me

A breathing carbon copy
From the pages of a glossy magazine
Prototype to prototype, distorted in its form
In this unreal world of dreams

Inside, outside, inside out
Outside, inside, inside out
Inside, outside, inside out
Does someone wanna sell me what Iâm about ?
