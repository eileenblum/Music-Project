[Narration written and spoken by Steve Sly]

The year 2018
Life as we know it destroyed through ignorance
Life unsustainable outside of the sterile City limits
Your every breath and movement monitored
Violence and crime will not be tolerated
Your first mistake will be your last

You are now entering Sector One
Please insert your life control card

S129434
You have sinned against your own people on Central City
Now you must pay the ultimate price: your access denied...

Blazing arid wasteland, motionless distress
As a red synthetic sunrise distorts the naturalness
Summoned by the signal, natureâs only point of view
As the system of the new world begins for those who do
No need for the seasons, destroyed inevitably
Eternal burning winter divorced the other three
Living under shelter, our existence doesn't change
To the regulated programme that's too dangerous to tame

Condemned to life, where you don't even die
Condemned to life, where emotion denied
Condemned to life, where you can't even ask why

Your condemned where it's access denied
No escape, there is no other side
Access denied, request denied

Monitor systems check emotion control
No room for resistance
Access denied, request denied
A digital readout shows the meaningless time
You may never speak out

Your condemned where it's access denied
No escape, there is no other side
Access denied, request denied

The silence that was louder now shattered by alarm
Shows a frenzy of obedience of safe but sterile charm
Blue and pink in sectors, unite but rarely meet
Just a basis for production, so that logic is complete
No need for assessment, do just what you do
Your emotions are illegal in this electronic womb
No chance for a rebirth, no chance to decide
Can we trust ourselves to run us if emotion is denied ?

Condemned to life, where you don't even die
Condemned to life, where emotion denied
Condemned to life, where you can't even ask why

Your condemned where it's access denied
No escape, there is no other side
Access denied, request denied

Sector One, it's our world, why let it die ?
Sub-divided, by nature can we ever decide ?
Nature's orders, pre-programmed through mother earth
Man's existence, decided through science and thought

Can't monitor emotion, can we limit control ?
Can't resist our own destruction
Our reactional readout shows the means to the time
Why did we leave it so late to speak out ?

No escape from a world of emotionless machines
Can't speak out, no logical point of view
Access denied, request denied
Life control by number, not a name
Access denied, time's running out for you
Access denied
Access denied
Access denied, access denied
