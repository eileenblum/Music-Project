[Eftichiou / Carawana / Hughes]

Ha ha ha ha ha...

Do you hear me ? I know you do
You always have and you always will
The medication to cease my voice
You wanna kill me, youâll kill yourself

Hey, youâll get so lonely without me friend
Yourself alone inside
Youâll have to like me, or hate yourself
You know we coincide

But it never ceases
Medication increases the abnormalities I contend without choice

Administer the cause, the voices on pause
I must suffer the clause of side effect

Prepared for my hell inside myself
Itâs out of my control
I start to grin my, my morbid smile
Await my private hell on earth
But it never ceases
Medication increases the abnormalities I contend without choice

Administer the cause, the voices on pause
I must suffer the clause of side effect

I get so lonely without you friend
Myself alone inside
Donât have to like you, to hate myself
I live behind your eyes

But it never ceases
Medication increases the abnormalities I contend without choice

Administer the cause, voices on pause
I must suffer the clause of side effect
Administer the cause, the voices on pause
I must suffer the clause of side effect

Side effect, side effect, side effect
