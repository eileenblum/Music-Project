[Eftichiou / Sly]

Judgement was swift, it came
It came without warning
As the black moon rises once again
Another murder on a downtown street
In the stone cold December wind
One step to heaven Lord, no
No, too many temptations to sin

The world keeps spinning round, racing with the wind
Light in the dark unseen, we're biting the bullet again
Lies and promises, sick of man's inhumanity to man
Why should such a peaceful man
Die by the bullet of the assassin's hand ?
Brother, brother give me shelter from the storm
There's something missing in our world
Trodden down by the uniform archaic
Methods of rule
Never to laugh again
The walls came down to break the curse
Not a moment too soon

The world keeps spinning round, racing with the wind
Light in the dark unseen, we're biting the bullet again
Lies and promises, sick of man's inhumanity to man
Why should such a peaceful man
Die by the bullet of the assassin's hand ?

Take a look inside yourself
Don't cast aspersion to what you think, others are worth

Make your choice, believe in what you must
A guiding hand may sometimes betray your trust

The world keeps spinning round, racing with the wind
Light in the dark unseen, we're biting the bullet again
Lies and promises, sick of man's inhumanity to man
Why should such a peaceful man
Die by the bullet of the assassin's hand ?

No more lies
No more lies for promises
As the world keeps spinning round
No more lies, no more lies, no more lies

We're racing with the wind
Biting the bullet again
Sick of man's inhumanity to man
Why should such a peaceful man
Die by the bullet of the assassin's hand ?

The life is stolen, taken for granted
Stone cold, concrete and steel
The cutting edge unchained without a warning
Brother, brother give me shelter please

Nothing has the fury of a loaded gun
In the hands of a madman
Nobody seems to learn from passed mistakes
As the world keeps turning around
Judgement comes swift and deadly to those
Who are in the wrong place at the wrong time
Lies and promises
I'm sick of man's inhumanity to man
Why should such a peaceful man
Die by the action of the assassin's hand ?
