[Eftichiou / Sly]

Still they send them out to fight another stupid war
The weak, the brave, the innocent and poor
Judgement is passed so easily without a thought
Political lies hide on the other side

They see no evil truth, they hear no evil truth
The blood they spill will stain their land
They see no evil truth, they hear no evil truth
Don't wanna die

Staring down the barrel of aggression's loaded gun
A useless loss of life, no war is ever won
No taught me how to fight, did not explain the cause
Just sent me out to fight in someone else's war

They see no evil truth, they hear no evil truth
The questioned sanities of man
They see no evil truth, they hear no evil truth
Don't wanna die

They see no evil truth, they hear no evil truth

[Narration: John F. Kennedy]

Still they send them out to fight another stupid war
The weak, the brave, the innocent and poor
Judgement is passed so easily without a thought
Political lies hide on the other side

They see no evil truth, they hear no evil truth
When life is lost, can't understand
They see no evil truth, they hear no evil truth

Won't they ever see or ever understand ?
