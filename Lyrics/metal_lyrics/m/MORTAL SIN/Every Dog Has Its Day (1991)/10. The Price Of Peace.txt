[Eftichiou / DeFrancesco / Sly]

[Narration: Franklin D. Roosevelt]

Recollection of the past, destiny is falling
History ignored again as the war machine is calling
Strategy and diplomacy now apart as black and white
Armageddon final warning by the sword to live and die

The innocent will pay the price of peace
Sanity restrained again to reach a price of peace
The tyrant survives, the innocent burn, is this the price of peace ?
Environmental nightmare, the price of peace

Hostage to a world insane, bureaucracy will make your mind
Prisoner of innocence can't break free, their hands are tied
Hostage soldier broken man, all is fair in love and war, ha !
Pain and suffering to the world, won't somebody heed the call ?

The innocent will pay the price of peace
Sanity restrained again to reach a price of peace
Environmental nightmare, is this the price of peace ?
The innocent will pay the price of peace, no !

People's lives, the pain to pay
No relief could wash away
Indignity forced, lives decay
The price of peace too high to pay
The innocent will pay the price of peace
Sanity restrained again to reach a price of peace
Broken dreams are all I see, is this the price of peace ?
Environmental nightmare

No means to justify an end, all a dream of yesterday
Level it all to the ground and build it up again
Shattered dreams are all I see, the sky, a blackened haze
Lessons will we ever learn, the price of peace these days ?

The innocent will pay
Sanity stripped away
Is this the only way ?
Human lives decay

Time is now, what is the price of peace ?
