[DeFrancesco / Eftichiou / Sly]

Open up your eyes
Spare a thought for the children
From the gutter to the grave
No, that's not what we taught them

Fifty thousand kids out on the streets of the Lucky Country
From the gutter to the grave ain't a long way to fall
Responsibilities breakdown, no real fault of their own
No one to cling to, and no place to call their own

From the gutter to the grave, nowhere to run
Nobodies daughter, nobodies son
Time stands still, nowhere to run, no sanctuary

A desperate time
A desperate measure
All lost children
In the arms of the world

Misbegotten old and young, yesterday's deception
Forgive them our sins, deliver us right from wrong
Open up your eyes to the real world
And don't let crime become their only saviour

From the gutter to the grave, nowhere to run
Nobodies daughter, nobodies son
Time stands still, nowhere to run, no sanctuary, no

Screaming in silence
Reaching out, no one there to catch their fall
Running through madness
Alienated by society that they call

Socially outcast
No prison cell should hold discarded youth
Living on a daydream
Is this the end of honesty and truth ?

Playing with fire
Always guilty 'till proven innocent
Living in darkness
Now they live survival of the fit

Millions of people on the streets, could be your country
From the gutter to the grave ain't a long way, long way to fall
Open up your eyes, open up
From the gutter to the grave ain't a long way to fall
Open up your eyes
Don't let crime become their only saviour
(Ainât a long way to fall)
