[Sly / Eftichiou]

Risking it all on the chance of a loaded dice
This ain't no game, you'll hear the voices cry
Shattered dreams turn the page to another world

Riding on that thin white line again
Just can't decide, reality or dream
Living life on the edge of a heartbeat...

Get the message
Don't play with fire, don't let the needle in
Street level justice
Blackout, blackout

Bleeding you dry, convinced it's the only way
Inch by inch, day by wasted day
The pattern never ending, the outcome stays unchanged

City streets, they scream another name
The white lady feeds it all the same
It's in the blood, you're the loser once again

Get the message
Don't play with fire, don't let the needle in
Street level justice
Blackout

Stare into the mirror to try and take away the pain
Try to see the truth with all things equal and fair
But the haze now all too familiar exaggerates my thoughts
Reality or dream, hard times and no excuse
A small price to pay for the poison that eats away your valuable life

Inch by inch, day by day
Blackout

Slowly but surely you ask yourself
Is it all really worth the pain ?
Continual path of self-destruction
Living life on the edge of a heartbeat

Inch by inch, day by day
Inch by inch, day by day
Inch by inch, day by day

Get the message
Don't play with fire, don't let the needle in
Street level justice
Blackout, blackout

The pattern is never ending, the outcome stays unchanged
Corruption on every corner hides its face in the crowd
Oppressive existence, no place to wear your heart on your sleeve
Money talks and money can make you bleed

You're not immortal
You can't escape, you're not the chosen one
Don't play with fire

Blackout, blackout
