[DeFrancesco / Sly]

Two, three, go !

Itâs always been a deep dark mystery of life
Behold, your eyes they will see
I hear your voice, it echoes on the whispering wind
Weâll take this evil world, wash away the sin

Releasing the grip of the evil that taunts me
Iâm washing my hands of the blood and the sin
Behind the lies

Evolution of mankind, prevails to be seen
Living deep inside the tormented soul
Turn your back and walk away from these evil dreams
Saving yourself from the torment of the fires that burn below

Releasing the grip of the evil that taunts me
Iâm washing my hands of the blood and the sin
Behind the lies

And as I walk the evil hallway
I shall not stumble or shall I fall
Always carrying with me the trust, the honour
Created as an equal, the choice is mine to uphold

Donât turn your back and walk away from the loaded gun
Hiding your face wonât get you through, thereâs nowhere left to run
You made the mistake, you sold your soul to the highest bidder
Forever to wander deathâs dark hall, the eternal sinner

Releasing the grip of the evil that taunts me
Iâm washing my hands of the blood and the sin
Rescue me now from the fire and brimstone
Evilness will crash and burn
Paying the price for lies once again
Behind the lies, behind the lies

And as I climb the evil stairway
I shall not stumble or shall I fall
Always carrying with me the trust, the honour
Created as an equal, the choice is mine to uphold
