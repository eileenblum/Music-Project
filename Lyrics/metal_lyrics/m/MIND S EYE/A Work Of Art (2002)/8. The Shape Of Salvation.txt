My eyes fell on to the frame
A picture of freedom
A dance for the next day
And into eternity
And if you keep telling me
To look for the answer
In things right before me
I won't look the other way 

This mask that I'm wearing
Conceals all my fears inside
I hold my head up high
While memory fades
I remember those days 

The shape of salvation
Sometimes in the strangest of ways
Just believe, It's not who I used to be
I'm the captain of my soul
The master of my own faith
Just believe, I'm not who I used to be 

My conscience can't tolerate
The fact that I'm lonely
There's so many pages to read
There's to little time to kill
So don't put their lights on me
I'm just chasing shadows
An old fortune teller
Writing his last story 

This mask that I'm wearing
Conceals all my fears inside
I hold my head up high
While memory fades
I remember those days 

The shape of salvation... 

Feels like somebody is watching
Over me 

The shape of salvation
Sometimes in the strangest of ways
Just believe, It's not who I used to be
I'm the captain of my soul
The master of my own faith
Just believe, I'm not who I used to be
