[Verse:]
Donât need to shout
I can hear you clear
Donât need to see
What was never there
And nothing will come unless they never end
These voices in my head
Walk into the light
Canât see your face
If you had the life I had
Youâd never stand here
How far can we go without falling down the edge
What is there to expect?

[Bridge:]
Now my only hope Is to cut of my tongue
These are my last words
Hear me now

[Chorus:]
Without destination
We donât have a thing
A moment of honour
For those who dared to climb that hill
Throw away your ball and chain
You can take my freedom
But you wonât take my words away

[Verse:]
Put out the lightâs
The words echo in my head
I will survive
Something tells me that
I may just give up and be free again
Free in a bigger cell
All the torture, all the pain
Can it stop now?
Canât take another day
And nothing I say means anything to them
All I can do is pray

[Bridge:]
Now my only hopeâ¦

[Chorus:]
Without destination â¦

[Stick:]
All the torture all the pain

[Chorus:]
Without destination â¦ [x2]
