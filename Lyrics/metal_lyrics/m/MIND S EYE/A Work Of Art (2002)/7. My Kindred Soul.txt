Something in the air today
Reminds me of the town, that I was born in
I hear some children play outside
And I think about the friends
I had to leave, in my hometown 

There were hills not far from my house
Where I could sit for hours and think
The memories will stay with me
And never, ever, never leave me 

My dreams and goals where born there
Decisions that made me, the man I am
I realized by early age
That wishes don't come true
Without the will
And a bit of fortune 

There were hills not far from my house... 

Looking through these eyes
I can see who I am
Hoping that the mirror will show someone younger
Kiss the past goodbye
For my kindred soul 

It almost feels like yesterday
When nothing was for real
Only in pretend
The innocence you can see in our children's eyes
We had it to
Somehow it's gone
And noone knows why 

There where hills not far from my house... 

Looking through these eyes
I can see who I am
Hoping that the mirror will show someone younger
Kiss the past goodbye
For my kindred soul 

Fate will make you choose in two different directions
No matter what you do don't look the other way
All you need is your hands and heart
To make a kindred soul
