Days of thunder
Nights of lightning
Turn the hands of time...

I'm drifting down a shore
Waving goodbye to humanity
Now we're all in the same boat
Sinking slow
For each day that goes by
I try to be strong with nerves of steel
Who could have known that you and I
Would share the same goal 

Paint my hart, Paint my heart
Color my blood
Mend my soul, Mend my soul
The weight is too much for me
One word for each mouth
Don't ask for miracles
Hold on, for what reality might bring 

Turn the hands of time
Feed the vein of life
And let the curtain fall
Days of thunder
Nights of lightning
Turn the hands of time
Watch the world burn
Pull the trigger
and the beginning will be the end 

She's nowhere to be found
The lady who gave birth to me
I was deserted by my own
Flesh and blood
Emotions can be drowned
But nothing can heal an inner scar
Keep the secret to yourself
Close your heart 

Paint my heart, Paint my heart...

One word for each mouth 

Turn the hands of time... 

Someone told me in the haze
That the wounds of the world are slowly healing
Embrace the words the spirit shout
"Walk on the broken glass"
"Drink from the poisoned wishing well"
"Share the same pain as me"
Show yourself to me, to me 

Turn the hands of time...
