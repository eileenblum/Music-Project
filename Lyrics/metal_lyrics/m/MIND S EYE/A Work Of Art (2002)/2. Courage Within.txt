[Verse:]
Have you heard the news?
Yesterday was just the beginning
Of another time
Is it true or false?
When everything depends on tomorrow
Can't you read the sign
All that we know could be wrong...
Climbing up the rope
Nothing will be left if we give in
Leave it all behind
Did I wake you up?
Forever is a very long time
Turn the hourglass
All that we know could be wrong

[Bridge:]
Standing in the scene of the crime again
As we move on, with our lives

[Chorus:]
Cover your eyes when you face the storm
And the world outside, doesnât mean a thing
Courage within, and youâll brake the fall
Bring down corrupted nations
Prevent their suffocation
And you will break through the wall

[Verse:]
Going nowhere fast?
Simon said that nothingâs the matter
Read between the lines
Did you know the score
Information only for in-laws
Carefully confined
All that we know could be wrongâ¦
Have you seen the news?
Politics are just an illusion
Projected in your mind
Did I wake you up?
Forever is a very long time

[Spoken:]
Especially when youâre blindâ¦
All that we know could be wrong...

[Bridge:]
Standing in the scene of the crime again...

[Chorus:]
Cover your eyes when you face the storm...

[Stick:]
Walking a fine line, claiming what is mine
Will you take my advice, against intended lies
Secured immunity- Two for the price of one, two for the price of one

[Chorus:]
Cover your eyes when you face the storm...
