Another tear, another time
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
Cause words can hurt so much
And I just have to see you smiling
Two worlds apart
Two different minds
Trying to hold on
Pretending nothing's wrong
But that's not in our hearts
Who are we fooling whit this acting? 

I watch the sun go down
As I count the days, I count the days 

It was the light
We saw that made us so blind
Can we turn back the years
Cause time hasn't healed my scars
These open arms
Won't wait forever for you
So if you want me to forgive
Show me a good reason
And I'll forgive 

Loneliness can give you time
To figure out what's troubling your mind
So don't be afraid to cry
Just let it out don't keep it inside
I see my life through different eyes
Now that the fog has cleared, there's room for me
Don't like the irony
But that's the way my wind keeps blowing 

I watch the sun go down
As I count the days, I count the days 

It was the light...
These open arms are tired
Of waiting for someone to walk trough that door
I am a sinner in paradise
I am the clown who makes you cry
You know I don't belong here 

It was the light...
