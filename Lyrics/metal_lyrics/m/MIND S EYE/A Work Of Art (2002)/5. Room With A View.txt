The color of her skin is fading
These flowers need water
She's caught between two worlds
Unable to make a choice
I hold her hand in hope of answer
Her lips to form a word
All those promises we made
Should I still wait or give up
Is this the way
This is going to end 

In this room with a view
I can feel time standing still
In this room with a view
The dawn is breaking in
