A complex situation isn't easy to understand
Even harder to comprehend
Just a few out there amongst us, have the capability
Of judging instantly 

No you can't ignore the fact
Cause ignorance is no excuse
When every trace of competence is vanishing
Being misunderstood 

Writing a story, telling how things really are
The secret's been kept all too far
Lack of acknowledge, leaves for us here to pay the price
Equal reward, just roll the dice 

Like those endless conversations
Explaining for those without the shadow of a doubt
That they're all up for promotion
By foreseeing the shortest trend
Though it all coming to an end 

No you can't ignore the truth
It's hard to be the different ones
When almost all the rest are on the other side
Tearing all of it down 

Writing a story, telling how things really are... 

How can I make this world understand
This warning is a monument
Don't tear it down 

Writing a story, telling how things really are
The secret's been kept all too far
Lack of acknowledge, leaves for us here to pay the price
Equal reward, just roll the dice
You can't ignore the fact, we're telling how things really are
A lack of acknowledge, leaves for us here to pay the price
Equal reward, just roll the dice
