If you could see what I have seen
If you could touch what I have touched
It's like a simple rainbow surrounding us
Each color means a tiny little thing 

The bridge that we once built
It's too weak to hold us both
Too blind to see you walk on broken glass 

Have it your way, it's your world
It's out of my hands
Remember your pride
It's one of a kind
While you dig into your pocket for lies
Somebody is gonna steal your world 

So much to tell, so little time
The more I talk I fall behind
Correct me if I'm wrong now
Are you surprised?
You?re just as transparent as your lies 

The Bridge that we once built
It's too weak to hold us both
Too blind to see you walk the broken glass 

Have it your way, it's your world
It's out of my hands
Remember your pride
It's one of a kind
While you dig into your pocket for lies
Somebody is gonna steal your world 

Your world...
Someone holds the key 

Have it your way, it's your world
It's out of my hands
Remember your pride
It's one of a kind
While you dig into your pocket for lies
Somebody is gonna steal your world
