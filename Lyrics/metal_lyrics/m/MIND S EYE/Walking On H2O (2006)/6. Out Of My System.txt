You used me to get what you wanted from me
Used my hands, yours never even got dirty
Experimented on my like on a laboratory rat
Injected me with disease, no cure for that

Now that I'm lost and you are free
Questions run too deep
Just like that needle in my vein
Feeding on my wounds
Resurrection darling
I will be there soon
To remind you of betrayal
Cause I left you much too soon
Once I carried my fait
Played my last ace
Please, meet my doom

Now I'm getting you out of my system
For I'm getting you out of my life
Temper rising, explode thermometer
You must understand
Can't reveal my true self to you, No

You robbed me my youth and things I wanted to be
Once a fragile kid now more looking like a freak
Can't you see how I live, like a laboratory ape?
At least I live in my dreams, for how long?

Now that I'm lost and you are free...

Now I'm getting you out of my system...

Just like the poison in my veins...

Now I'm getting you out of my system...
I cannot fail...now
