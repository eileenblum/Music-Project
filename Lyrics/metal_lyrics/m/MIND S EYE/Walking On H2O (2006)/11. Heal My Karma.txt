What light is shining there?
Where am I floating to?
Who chose to bring me here
To this beauty that I see
In this world where I feel free

A pleasant stranger greets.
He takes me by the hand.
Revealing secrecy (of)
New knowledge that we need
In this world where I can

Learn my past,
Cast my fear,
Opening for guidance

I know I can change
If you heal my karma, don't let go
Even when I speak to the gods
I know I can learn
If you heal my karma, don't let go
Even if you're holding my arms
There won't be a second chance

The stars have shown the way
To reunite our worlds
But why these cover ups
To keep us from exploring
This new world that's giving

Millions of answers to mankind
Do you accept the new truth?
Can we share science across our spheres that we rule (that we rule)
In this world where I can

Learn my past...

I know I can change...

Do I dare return to planet earth...how soon?
How do I explain my little visit? Is it better to stay here?
Thought of never seeing my true love...hurts bad
I'm torn between two minds of decisions that cannot be combined
Not for a while
But for now
I belong back home

Now that I've changed
You can heal my karma, let me go
Even when I speak to the gods
I know I have learned
When you heal my karma, let me go
I know I belong in those arms
There won't be a second chance

Lights are fading out
A voice that echoes loud
It reminds me of you
And the love that we have
