The light became my only friend
I tried to hide my thoughts, the images I see
I must be mad? I'm loosing it?
Give me room
Space to stretch my wings
Should I consider this a gift?
I'm able to see life in my own fantasy
Am I predicting the future?
I hope not
Everything's so clear

I had to let you know
Can you live with this man?
Still have allot to learn
Will you give me a hand?
Seems like I've always lived in fear
Do you know the reason?
Got to know the reason
Why we're all here

It took two lives to discover
The corridors painted blue in my mind
I slaved two lives just to reach you
Embrace Mrs. clairvoyance
She opens your eyes

Come join my life I don't need eyes
People, they speak their hearts, but never honestly
You self-destruct, how can this be?
Headless dolls, is everything I see

I had to let you know...

It takes two lives to discover...

As you start to lose control
Of your body, mind and soul
Don't deny this special gift
And a New World will begin
I don't feel your pain
Don't mind the world's insane
Under this tree with my ancestors

It took two lives to discover...
