Heaven, pushing me under the clouds
Crossing the ocean to gain sense, learn more
Riddles rime, just like the time, it's late
Tick, tack two minutes until we dive
Into this legend we can't tie us to
People rise, hail this grand design

Must admire, pure perfection
Count to ten then all the world will smile to your face
Los Andes Mountains offer a clue
Did the mighty Indians knowledge vanish in the past?
Enter the white savior's rules
Succumb to the fools
Succumb to the fools

Watching the Nazca lines from up here
I fear the world is out of place
A souvenir? A helping hand? You decide
Watching the Nazca lines through a lens
We humans don't know how to place
Enough to dream? Enough to drown? You decide

Ground signs, can't help to wonder how we
Lost all this knowledge, why did we leave this?
Ancient skies mirror what we can't find

This is unexplainable (Must admire, pure perfection)
Even for science today (Count to ten and All the world will smile to your face)
They don't know what they see

Watching the Nazca lines from up here...

Mathematics, Astronomy, burn the proof

No matter how much I watch this, I don't see the trace of man
Succumb to the fools

Watching the Nazca lines from up here...
