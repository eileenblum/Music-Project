It's a hateful world
So much anger locked inside of us
That's how we are
Like a pack of wolves searching for food
The pain grows
And some people just can't take it more
Revenge is wrong
When there are innocent people involved

Don't count on consequences, don't
Don't ask for answers
Was it all worth the lives it costed?
So much for reasons

I still think we can change
I believe in the fact
We're all created as the same
Equally Immortal

Can you hear their cries?
From the restless ghost's we must mourn
No that's not enough (not enough)
All this money can't replace my son
I'm tired
Of the excuses you plant in our heads
Let's blame someone (Anyone)
And let's wipe out his entire race

Don't count on consequences, don't...

I still think we can change...

Look in the barrel of a gun, what do you find?
Bullets don't take lives, even if you don't see the light
We can break waves if we unite
What are the heroes of our time?
Immortal?

And today I wake up, wishing yesterday was just a dream...

Don't count on consequences, don't...

I still think we can change...
