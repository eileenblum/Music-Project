Here we are
We're standing in the ruins
Of what God left us
Who's to blame?
It all seems so unfair
We are asking "why us"?
By our own hands
We built monuments
Inventions we trust
Don't you dismiss us, we need your help
It's simple, we've lost so much

Mother nature's response is oh so clear
She wants to breathe again
Rain tastes like tears
Volcanos will erupt (in a land of far beyond)
The sky will open up tonight

There's a river where you will see your true reflection
Dive in or grow some feathers
Comets will fall with heavens rage
You're just as bright as umbrellas under the sun

Here we stand
We're laughing at the moon
Is it really ours?
Hand in hand we grow stronger everyday
So don't throw in the towel yet

Mother nature's response is oh so clear...

There's a river where you will see your true reflection...

Diving inside tsunami's rage
To learn its sad purpose
The ozone layer is making threats
This world is safe no more

Mother nature's response is oh so clear...
There's a river where you will see your true reflection...
Comets will fall with heavens rage, tornadoes heading west
You are just as bright as umbrellas under the sun (open your eyes, here is the sun)
