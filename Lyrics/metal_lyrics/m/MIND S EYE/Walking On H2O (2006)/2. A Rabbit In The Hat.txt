Show us where to draw the line
Now, make up your mind
One has to go into the dark
Into the unknown
So what you're waiting for fool
Don't you feel the fear
Pouring down on your eyes?
Pack up your bags, see you on TV
No one has to know...

The moon is right there
Waiting for us to win
A rat race in name of science
We'll carry our flag like the pirates we are

So who is the one behind the mask?
Plant a rabbit in the hat
Tell me, who is the one behind the glass?
So who is the brain behind this plan?
One steep backwards for mankind
I'm sure there are million reasons why you hide
Give me one!

Lets win the cold war man
While the nation sleeps in front the screen
Lets feed them with what they want to see
On 60 minutes

The moon is right there...

So who is the one behind the glass?

Waving flags when no atmosphere
Really makes my stomach crawl
We just eat the hoax of the century
Served on silver plates by Marsians
Yeah, but you don't fool me

So who is the one behind the glass?

This is where I draw the line
I've made up my mind...
