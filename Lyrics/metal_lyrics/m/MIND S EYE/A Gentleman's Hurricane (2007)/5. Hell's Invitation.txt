My son, why won't you see the light in heaven?
I rather rule in hell than to serve in heaven, father...

Your job's to rescue me today
So don't fill my head with empty thoughts
From where I am there's no return
The power of your mighty words
Claiming my crown is made of thorns
Made to keep the evil out

I'm here to find out
If there's more to life than death
Ironic how god slaps your face
And he will always be

Like a cockroach in your mouth
Laying eggs inside your brain

I will not make it, through the pearly gates
Carrying chains of doom
Hell's invitation is burning out
The devil sends regards
Let me taste the apples again

Wouldn't want to ruin your plan
Like I did the last time
So please release me
From these chains of doom

I felt the weight of that day
Thought I was not the only one
To cast the first stone in the crowd
A punishment for changing lanes
Nobody likes the way you talk
The way your X is held up tall
So rest in my arms
While you finish your last breath
Ironic how god slaps your face
And he will always be
Like a cockroach in your mouth
Laying eggs inside your brain

I will not make it, through the pearly gates
Carrying chains of doom
Hell's invitation is burning out
The devil sends regards
Let me taste the apples again

Wouldn't want to ruin your plan
Like I did the last time ha ha ha
So please release me
From these chains of...

Hell belongs to me
You can walk the clouds
Promises to keep
before I claim my crown
Heaven is a trick
You can hardly wait
For the punch line is
Endless Emptiness

I will not make it, through the pearly gates
Carrying chains of doom
Hell's invitation is burning out
The devil sends regards
Let me taste the apples again

Wouldn't want to ruin your plan
Like I did the last time ha ha ha
So please release me
From these chains of doom

Paradise will never open up
For a man with chains of doom
The gates of hell open for anyone
Surely I can never be included
Only spotless lives approved
Wouldn't want to ruin your garden there
I'm here to find out...
