Scenery was drawn
Easy to obtain
Help from media
Camera everywhere

Time to make my move
Safe behind my lens
Fast decisions
Breathing down my neck
I'll be...

Like a shadow on your back
Like the beggar flips a coin
Like clockwork I will hit

How can you sit there?
While there's so much chaos, been unleashed
A penny for your thoughts
The TV is rather calm
Watching all this chaos caving in
It's all caving in...

Lights are blinding me
Sun is burning me
In broad daylight
Suspensions killing me
Then I get a go
The bullet leaves my gun
Rest in peace now
A martyr you shall be
I'll be...

Like a monkey on your back
Like the beggar flips a coin
For like clockwork I will hit

How can you sit there?
While there's so much chaos, been unleashed
A penny for your thoughts
The TV is rather calm
Watching all this chaos caving in
It's all caving in...

Right on your face
Like a fly landing on the tip of your nose
Your TV dinner tastes
Like the blood on my hands
Crime on prime time is on today's menu

How can you sit there?
While there's so much chaos, been unleashed
A penny for your thoughts
The TV is rather calm
Watching all this chaos caving in
It's all caving in...

So how can they sit there?
