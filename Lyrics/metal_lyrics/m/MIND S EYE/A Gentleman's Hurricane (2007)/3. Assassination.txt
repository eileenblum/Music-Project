Hope is at large
Sweet Novocain
Condemnation
Frozen in time, covering my years, you are the savior

Take these pills, you say
Chase the world away
I rush to drink some water
Holy water boils
Say can you heal this sad headache
The morphine of my life

The bells of desecration
Always ringing in my ears
As the shadows of deception
Might arrest the best of me
Oh priest, please help me

Assassination
It's in my nature
Show me the gold
A hand full for a restless tomb
Assassination
Sowing this nation
Cynical world
No matter how rich you are
Always a price on your head
The joke's on you

Three shots in the head
Enough to clear his mind
A rather fading color
Weakening your bones
Crossing the lake
Baring the flame
Intentions have gone mad

The bells desecration
Always ringing in my ears
As the shadows of deception
Might arrest the best of me
Oh priest, please help me

Assassination
It's in my nature
Show me the gold
A hand full for a restless tomb
Assassination
Sowing this nation
Cynical world
No matter how rich you are
Always a price on your head
The joke's on you

All we are is dust
Pointless lives, crying when there's loss, broken there
I shall liberate you from your walls
Help you cross that border
Climb and fall, climb and fall

Crossing the lake
Baring the flame
Dimensions have gone mad
Like the intentions of a child

Assassination
It's in my nature
Show me the gold
A hand full for a restless tomb
Assassination
Sowing this nation
A cynical world
There is no room for the facts
Proof is a slap on your face
The joke's on you
The joke's on you
