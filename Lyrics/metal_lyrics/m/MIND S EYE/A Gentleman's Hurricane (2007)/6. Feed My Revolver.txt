A disgraceful kind of trap
For a democratic rat
To drive into my sight
I am sweating in the crowd
In this desert dollar town
A shot for mercy calls

The world is mine
Soon as the bullet goes
Through your brain
Come thunderstorm and rain
Flush your blood down the drain
One last with before the flood

Then I knew that I've become
My own nightmare with a gun
Feed my revolver
Every corner that I turn
Every eye ball I confront
Feeds my revolver
Feed my revolver
Guess it's time to reload

Someone else will take the fall
For the sins that I have caused
The media will fail
And the other they won't know
As they shot into the dark
For answers, come to me

The world is mine
Soon as the CIA cuts your face
Come former presidents
Wash Jackie's tears away
One last toast before the fraud

Then I knew that I've become
My own nightmare with a gun
Feed my revolver
Every corner that I turn
Every eye ball I confront
Feeds my revolver
Feed my revolver
Guess it's time to reload

The facts don't lie
I'm practically just shoving them deep down your throat
I am free from the guilt
Forgive me
May I have this last dance?

The world is stunned
It's like I killed a butterfly
My job here is done
I wash my hands
In grassy knoll

That's when I knew that I've become
My own nightmare with a gun
Feed my revolver
Everyday I'm getting worse
Killing time in my own terms
Feed my revolver
Feed my revolver
I guess it's time to reload
Feed my revolver
