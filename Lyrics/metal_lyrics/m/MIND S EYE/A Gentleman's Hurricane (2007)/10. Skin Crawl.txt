I am the war you cannot end
I am the scent you cannot stand
The cancer of a cigarette
I hide my tears from your demands
I hate your guts still here I am
A rotten corpse on your behalf
Treated like a teddy by a lonely child

Just like a snake I change my skin
Open your eyes and realize
Living in shadows I can see
Who has grown horns and wings

Constant craving
For the innocent blood of yours
Save your praying
For it's making my pale skin crawl
Skin crawl

So let them think it's suicide
You know the mob is water proof
Nothing can move that mountain there
They think they know how brought this mess
The hammer falls but once again
Justice prevails blind as a bat
One hundred red steps away from his door

Just like a snake I change my skin
Seeking the truth, door slams on you
Living in shadows I can see
The raven is passing me

Constant craving
For the innocent blood of yours
Save your praying
For it's making my pale skin crawl
[x2]
Skin crawl
