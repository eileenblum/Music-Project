Who is this crying woman?
She claims she's blood with me
The only proof she carries plays a melody
A gift from me
As I dismiss her reasons
She hands me one last thing
A picture of her mother
Suddenly I see

Open my wound, pour salt on it
The grave digger's big shame
Ask em what purpose I fill
Bless your heart for it's so pure
I sleep with the lights on
Hug a pillow up front
The lullaby song the sandman hums
Might come true
Twist the dagger out of my old wound
Ashes to ashes in land lullaby

That night I had to head out
The men of light insist
The cleansing of a member
Whose powers had grown weak
Must separate the two roles
Of father and a beast
I just can't close the door now, it's reality

Open my wound, pour salt on it
The grave digger's big shame
Ask em what purpose I fill
Bless your heart for it's so pure
I sleep with the lights on
Hug a pillow up front
The lullaby song from your music box
Makes me fight for you
Even if it's the last thing I ever do
Ashes to ashes in land lullaby

She's a fraud
Cast away the music once played to you
The voice of reason
Commands you now
The beautiful illusion
Of a ticking bomb
Waiting for the finger of destiny
Maybe you are right and I am wrong

Open my wound, pour salt on it
The grave digger's big shame
Ask me what purpose I fill
Bless your heart for it's so pure
I sleep with the lights on
Hug a pillow up front
The lullaby song the sandman hums
Might come true
Twist the dagger out of my old wound
Ashes to ashes in land lullaby
In land lullaby
Keep living in land lullaby
