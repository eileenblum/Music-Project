Higher
Embrace the filthy sky
The point of no return
Is here upon us
Dust to dust
The fear taught you to fly
Gravity is for them
Those non believers

So the thread that you proudly hang on
Eventually it will snap
The perfection is ruining your temple
Tickles a smile on my lips

For when I say goodnight it always means forever
You'll see your life flash by for a second
And when your eyes roll back
I'll cry the tears of joy
Count your blessings now, it's better
Time to say
Goodnight

Rest assure
Your legacy will die
The serpent is the fool
He's out of venom
Feed the crows
Their feathers are like mine
Waiting for a dove
We long for supper

So the thread that you proudly hang on
Eventually it will snap
The perfection is ruining your temple
Tickles a smile on my lips

For when I say goodnight it always means forever
You'll see your life flash by for a second
And when your eyes roll back
I'll cry the tears of joy
Count your blessings now, it's better
Time to say
Goodnight

Here's a chair
Here's a rope
You know what to do
Make sure the knot is tight enough for me, for you

If you find heaven
You got nothing to fear
Not at all

[Spoken:]
Garden of Eden
Is a cemetery
Not far from hell

For when I say goodnight it always means forever
You'll see your life flash by for a second
And when your eyes roll back
I'll cry the tears of joy
Count your blessings now, it's better
Time to say
Goodnight
