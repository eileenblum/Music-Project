Moscow is quiet tonight
It's cold out here
I'm dazzled by the lights
And this snow
The trees all painted white
It's plain to see
My coat is not enough
Against this snow
It's this snow
I believe

Is it true what they say
That all beauty must fade
Something woke in me
When that light bulb screamed
I stopped to catch my balance
No, cold sustains me
Soon I blame this snow
I'm sure it's this snow
Yes I believe

The mission is today
The men of light are watching me

Last time I had heard from him
Was during the cold war
Our differences had grown much further
Since bombing London
Back then
Where we shared a cold drink
Not knowing it was your blood
Running down my veins now
Poisoning me

The policy of a rotten state
Chokes anyone who makes a fist
Death is confusing man like
Red winter sirens
The legacy of a new born faith
Dies from the taste of mother's milk
The come retaliation
Feeding you silence
Eat all you can
It's only sand

Nothing could prepare me less
For the terror I was up against
We were broken, out of bullets
Loading our half loyalty
Back now
Shaking hands for the last time
I can only imagine how to tear your heart out
How can this be

The policy of a rotten state
Chokes anyone who makes a fist
Death is confusing man like
Red winter sirens
The legacy of a new born faith
Dies from the taste of mother's milk
The come retaliation
Feeding you silence
Eat all you can
It's only sand

It's only sand but it's tainted with your blood
And yet still they try to make you eat your name
It's only sand

Look how far we've come with these loaded guns
Blame human race
Blame this damn rat race

The policy of a rotten state
Chokes anyone who makes a fist
Death is confusing man like
Red winter sirens
The legacy of a new born faith
Dies from the taste of mother's milk
The come retaliation
Feeding you silence
Eat all you can
It's only sand

The fountain of trust
Has dwelled into dust
The old tree has been offended
A fellowship has ended
