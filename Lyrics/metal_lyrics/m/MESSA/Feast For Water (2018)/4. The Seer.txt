You troubled all the still air
Boundless things shine on the sand
Your drunk voice low at dusk time
Carving bones deep like oceans
Would you hide me?

Glazing moonshine hanging
My voice now belongs to you
Pillars burning slowly
Blooming flames over my head
Would you hide me?

Hide me in your wine-coloured seas
You are my brother
You are the seer

I am nothing, I know nothing
You are the devil
You are the seer

You are the devil
