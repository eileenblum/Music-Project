Silent waits
As long as I keep
Longing
And turning away
With emptiness
Cold hearts and wet eyes

I bled it out from my mind
And it was not of my kind
I bled it out from my mind
Been scraping out this hollow nest

Sunset fades
As long as I keep
Waiting
And then turning away
With my own peace
Cold minds and wet hands

I bled it out from my mind
And it was not of my kind
I bled it out from my mind
Been scraping out this hollow nest

And say to me
All the things you thought
