Swirling on the chosen spine
The knife, begging to cut
Flesh burning, to reborn, again

Vision rebuilt with a new seed
Harvesting fruits near the highest shores
Mirroring child, we are here together

Hiding another realm under your blanket
Searching the fire but still not pretending
Staining flood with blood, while you drank it
Baptising waters red, without reflecting

Shinier the fruits in your fabulous basket
Searching your saviour
But still not ascending
Drowning void of mud
While you keep scratching
Tightening my head
Like a devouring magnet
