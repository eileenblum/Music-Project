Through the mountains
You were born
Ape of Thoth

Realized the concrete
Translated reality
Into new aeon

Raise your chalice
For your guide sublime
Raise your chalice
Mother of abominations

Gifted your body
And your mind
To the great work

Near the seagulls
You chose to go
Ape of Thoth

Of chaos, you were the bride
Knew and loved the god, not the man
The only one to witness
The only one to know

Raise your chalice
To your guide sublime
Raise your chalice
Mother of abomination
