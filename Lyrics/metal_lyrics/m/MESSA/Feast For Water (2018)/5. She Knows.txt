She Knows
How to crack up your ego
How profound
Can be the tremble

She knows
The perfume, the depth of your heart
Your laments and all your odes

She knows
She knows
All inside you
She knows
She knows
And she knows where
Aim descents
Death and its scent

She knows
Where's the border for the things you fear
When's the end
Of the things you love dear

She knows
The great joy of dissemble
How the wind streams
And how it's forgot

She knows
She knows
All inside you
She knows
She knows
And she knows where
Aim descents
Death and its scent
