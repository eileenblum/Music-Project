Growing on my conscious hands
Adorning child, regarding sun
Balance all the trouble deep
Heal my throat cut now

Restore all the strong impulse
Misty runner through the pines
Ashes submerged, coming, alive
Heal my throat cut now

All your leaves
Through my fingers
All your leaves
Somehow they linger
Melting my chains
