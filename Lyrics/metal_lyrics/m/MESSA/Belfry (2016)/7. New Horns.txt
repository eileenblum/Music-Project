From the devastated ground
Some new shapes, they will create

What offends your tiny eyes
Will become something you like

We have cried forevermore
In long night without no end

Â«Fear not at all, neither man nor fates, nor gods, nor anything. Money fear not, nor laughter of the folk folly, nor any power in heaven or upon the earth or under the earth.Â» a.c.
