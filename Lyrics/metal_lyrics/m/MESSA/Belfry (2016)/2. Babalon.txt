City of golden dawns
They told
You'd be dying in one hour
So fastly you'll be destroyed
And you will burn
I know that day would've come

The day had come
Oh lord, it's a new dawn rising.

City of golden dawns
They told
You'd be killing all of ours
You've seen the hordes passing by
For so long
I know that day would've come

The day had come
Oh lord, it's a new dawn rising
