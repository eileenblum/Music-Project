The knowledge of being unheard
Kills my soul, makes me drown in the abyss
There ain't no love to die today
It burns my eyes to see nothing right
All I see are shadows
In my suffering bleeding eyes

Blindness comes along with the light
Cuts the atmosphere then it's quiet
The dead stay in their sleep
They don't caress

I've been holding all my pain
Knowing I'm not the one to blame
Nothing was worse than that day of may
He told me not to be afraid
But I'll never be that
I will never be that brave

Blindness comes along with the light
Cuts the atmosphere then it's quiet
The dead stay in their sleep
They don't confess
