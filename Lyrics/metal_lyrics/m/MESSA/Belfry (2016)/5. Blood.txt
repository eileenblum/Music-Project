The devil is blood
He is subtle
He calls you at night
When you suffer
Burning paths he walks on
Through dark tunnels
His voice pulls you through
All this magma

The devil is blood
He is subtle
He welcomes you hiding in his coven
Burning paths he walks on
Through dark tunnels
His hand guides you down
To the others

Hide from the sun
Hide from the light
Discover wisdom and truth
In your mind
