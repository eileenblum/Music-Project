In the dark thoughts of my soul
Staring at the candles
She stood awake by my side
On the nights I couldn't sleep
These figures would come to me
And wake me up tormenting my mind
They whispered in my ears
And revealed me all my ghosts

I believe them to be demons
They engulfed my soul

She found all my letters
Under the bed
Showing my deepest fears
Between night and dawn we walked
To the surreal crystal castle
Where everything seemed untrue
These demons were haunting my visions
Creating strange dreams

I believe them to be demons
They engulfed my soul
I believe to be demons
These demons conquered by world

I came back to the cliffs
They were obscure and noisy
A dead boy was lying on the ground
This encounter was real or imaginary?
The demons stood there and talked to me
One night they drove me
Further inside my nightmares
