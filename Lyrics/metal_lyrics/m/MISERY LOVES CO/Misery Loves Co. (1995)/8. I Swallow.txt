Feel your pressing
Closer closer
Pilot's open - (open, open)
Wet stain on my lips
Won't forget it - (forget it, forget it)
Push it apart, tear it apart
Abuse me, amuse me - (abuse me, amuse me)
Wouldn't have it any other way
But I want this to end right now

Still I follow
I swallow
Here I swallow
I swallow
Deep, down, loads
I swallow
Breathe, sore, fist
I swallow

I'd like to kill somebody

Treat me like the punk I am
Stuff this down
Follow the cross on my skin
My flesh - (my flesh, my flesh)
Cannot move
Cannot touch
Your touch is all pressured
Pull on my strings as you always do
A flick of your switch
And I'm yours

Deep, down, loads
I swallow
Breathe, sore, fist
I swallow - I swallow
Deep, down, loads
I swallow
Breathe, sore, fist
I swallow
I swallow

I've never killed so many

Looking for work
Take it easy easy
You know how it is
They deserve to die

Still I follow - (I swallow, I swallow)
Here and now - I swallow
Deep, down, loads
I swallow
Breathe, sore, fist
I swallow - I swallow
Deep, down, loads
I swallow - I swallow
Breathe - I swallow
Sore - I swallow
Fist
I swallow
Still I follow
I swallow
Here and now
I swallow
Still I follow
Here I swallow
