Confused
Tired of life
Feelin' ill
Just give me a call
I deliver the bill
Killing is my business
Business is good
Send your money
And I'll do what I should
This is no dream
This is no dream

Fifty minutes of hell
Then eternal sleep
Pray the lord your soiled
Fucking soul to keep
I lock the door
Throw away the key
Another for the flies
That's what you'll be
This is no dream
This is no dream
This is for real

Here it is
Fight it man
You know who I am

I'm the new-born
Messiah
With a viscious grin
The holy spirit
Will preach your sin
So just take my hand
And I'll put you to bed
I'll sing you my lullabies 'till your dead

I'm the new-born
Messiah
With a viscious grin
The holy spirit
Will preach your sin
So just take my hand
And I'll punch you to bed
And I'll send you my lullabies 'till your dead

No dream
No dream
No dream
This is no dream
For real
For real
For real
This is for real

Let me end your day
In my own way

Let me end your day
In my own way

This is no dream
This is for real
No dream
This is no dream
This is no dream
This is for real
No dream
No dream
This is no dream

This is no dream
This is for real
No dream

No dream
No dream...
