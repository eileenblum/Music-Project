The body of a junkie
2 seconds
Before the needle reaches it's target
2 seconds
2 seconds
I can't hear you being repulsive
For I'm normally cut to pieces
Unrestrained violence
And the warm between my legs
More, more
Whatever I do I need twice as much
Something that makes my heart explode
Anything
2 seconds
Yeah I know I'm good at being nobody
I could have been sludge
At least I have the time now
2 seconds

On weekends I send sick photographs
To the ladies of my residential neighbourhood
That's my way of expressing something
I'm barly inventive when it comes to playing games
2 seconds
2 seconds
I like to look at the dark side of things
And I always give a big smile
When I smile I feel like one of those
Doing commercials for candy
Kinda cute
I'd still like to kill him though
2 seconds
A lifetime 

The bullet from your weapon
Watch me explode
Closer, closer
Now I'm staring at you
2 seconds - 2 seconds
2 seconds - 2 seconds
The body, all I'm touching
Used to be impressed
Closer, closer
Now I'm staring at you
2 seconds - 2 seconds
2 seconds - 2 seconds

The body of the junkie
2 seconds
Before the needle reaches its target
Give me 2 seconds
2 seconds
A lifetime

2 seconds - 2 seconds
2 seconds - 2 seconds
2 seconds - 2 seconds

The body of the junkie
Used to be impressed
Closer, closer
Now I'm staring at you
2 seconds - 2 seconds
2 seconds - 2 seconds
2 seconds - 2 seconds
