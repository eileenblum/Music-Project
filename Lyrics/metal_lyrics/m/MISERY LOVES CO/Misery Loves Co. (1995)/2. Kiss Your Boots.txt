You push me up
Against the wall
With your so called truth
Behind your back
I know you built your conviction on hollow ground
But time as time you rise again

I wanna kiss your boots
I wanna kiss your - boots!
I wanna shine your boots
I wanna kiss your boots

Gotta go to - learn!
Put a bullet you cannot touch - die!
You play your game for self pitiness
You start to cut the crap
Open up your mind

I wanna kiss your boots
I wanna kiss your boots
I wanna kiss your boots

Let's smash the face of decision
Let's smash the face of decision - You
Let's smash the face of decision - Ladies and gentlepersons

You push me up
Against the wall
With your so called truth
Behind your back

I wanna kiss your boots
I wanna kiss your boots
I wanna shine your boots
I wanna kiss your boots

Live in fear
Lets smash the face of decision - Do
Lets smash the face of decision - Live in fear

Wanna kiss your boots - Live in fear
Kiss Your boots
Wanna kiss your boots - Live in fear
Kiss Your boots - Ah! hahahahaha!
Wanna kiss your boots
Kiss Your boots - Live in fear
Wanna kiss your boots
Kiss Your boots - Ah! hahahahaha!
Wanna kiss your boots
Kiss Your boots

Live in fear
