Could I have the image of doubt?
Believe the 'picture walls' were so clear
The perfect human end with spite of word
That's what I thought I was about
The barrel was born straight through my head
Now you watch my everyday

Oh god understand
It wasn't me
Your nothing in common with the grief
You see, yeah
I'm not shouting
Pointing at you
You know that's something I wouldn't do
But there I was
The love of your life
Willing enough to kill us both
I cried

Sonic attack
Sonic attack
Sonic attack
Sonic attack

He's out of control
He's out of control
He's out of control

Wanted you to feed my strange desire
Can I ever face myself
What have I done
I really wanted to humiliate you
I really wanted to violate you
So there I was the love of your life
Insane enough to kill us both

Sonic attack
Inside my head
Sonic attack
As I toss you into bed

Sonic attack
Get off my back
Sonic attack
Get off my fucking back
