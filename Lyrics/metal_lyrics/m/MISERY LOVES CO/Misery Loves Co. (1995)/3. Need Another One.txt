I'm shaking like a leaf
Everybody's staring at me
I would give up my belief
If you'll only help me breathe
If you'll only help me breathe

Nervous moves, only makes her smile
There is no chance to get away
Dying seems like a waste of time
But doesn't matter anyway

Need another one
Give me another one
Got to have another one
Last one didn't do me no good

Need another one
Give me another one
Got to have another one
Last one didn't do me no good

The brain is trying to communicate
In a language I didn't learn in school
I guess I'll just have to wait
Who am I trying to fool
Who am I trying to..

Need another one
Give me another one
Got to have another one
Last one didn't do me no good

Need another one
Give me another one
Got to have another one
Last one didn't do me no good

(Need another one)
(Give me another one)
(Got to have another one)
(Last one didn't do me no good)

Need another one
Give me another one
Got to have another one
Last one didn't do me no good

Once I'd try
But now I've given it up
Don't want to hold it back
Or think it through
I'm getting ready for the crash
Nothing really matters anymore

(Nothing really matters anymore!!)

Need another one
It'll be justified
How come we never played
Russian roulette?
An eye for an eye
The ultimate high
We might as well play some Russian roulette!

Need another one
Give me another one
Got to have another one
Last one didn't do me no good

Need another one
Give me another one
Got to have another one
Last one didn't do me no good

Need another one
It'll be justified
How come we never played
Russian roulette?
An eye for an eye
The ultimate high
We might as well play some Russian roulette

Need another one - Need another one
Give me another one - It'll be justified
Got to have another one - Got to have another one
Last one didn't do me no good

Need another one - Need another one
Give me another one - It'll be justified
Got to have another one - Got to have another one
Last one didn't do me no good
