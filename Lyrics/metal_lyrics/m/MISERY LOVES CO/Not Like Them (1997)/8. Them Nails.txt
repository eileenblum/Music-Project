So small, so sick...
deny the truth,
hurts so much 
can't face it no more
Can't turn around...
everyone is a pig,
upholding themselves 
through exploitation

The end justifies the means,
no pleasure without pain
you push the limit
further away

I'll go anywhere
that ain't here,
wanna be anyone but me
I want everything at once,
I am looking for something else

Them nails [x2]
Them nails

I hate what's mine...
can't sleep at night,
walls are closing in on me
Effective, destructive...
humiliation, disintegration,
your God can't fix what's broken

You have taken this too far,
a manace to yourself
you push the limit further away

I'll go anywhere
that ain't here,
wanna be anyone but me
I want everything at once,
I am looking for something else

Them nails [x4]
Them nails

I hate what's mine...

The end justifies the means,
no pleasure without pain
You have taken this too far,
a manace to yourself
you push the limit further away

I'll go anywhere
that ain't here,
wanna be anyone but me
I want everything at once,
I am looking for something else

Them nails [x4]
Them nails

I hate what's mine... [x2]
