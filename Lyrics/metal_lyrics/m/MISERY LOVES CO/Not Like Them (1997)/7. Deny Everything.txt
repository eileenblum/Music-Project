The wait for something,
the wait for someone
wish I could give it all up,
for the unknown
Hide behind the big nothing,
afraid to breathe
the cruicifixion of christ,
forever

Deny everything - deny everything
Deny everything - deny

What I don't know,
is what hurts me the most
what I can't see
is what scares me at night
It feels so useless,
everything turns black
I am back where I started,
over and over again

Deny everything - deny everything [x2]

Hide behind the big nothing,
afraid to breathe
the cruicifixion of christ,
forever more

Deny everything [x2]
Deny everything - deny everything [x2]
Deny everything
