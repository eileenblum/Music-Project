Never learned to fake it,
even though you want me to.
Don't belong in your world,
won't be coming back no more. 
Don't want you near me,
don't need you in my life.
Leave it all behind me,
I close my eyes and
it's all gone
Now I'm on the outside,
my reflection on your wall,
bite the hand that feeds me,
in order to stay alive

You could never hurt me,
the way you hurt yourself.
Nothing lasts forever, 
I close my eyes and you are gone.
You are gone. [x2]

I am what you made me,
don't put the blame on me.
You are safe as always,
in your world of make believe.
I owe you nothing
I gave it all away.
Won't see me crawling,
seems like you have lost control.

You could never hurt me,
the way you hurt yourself.
Nothing lasts forever, 
I close my eyes and you are gone.
You are gone. [x3]

I owe you nothing.
You are gone
I owe you nothing.

Now I'm on the outside,
my reflection on your wall,
bite the hand that feeds me,
in order to stay alive
You could never hurt me,
the way you hurt yourself.
Nothing lasts forever, 
I close my eyes and you are gone.
You are gone. [x5]
I owe you nothing [x4]
