Getting further and can go??
Do what your doing again
The only thing that makes you feel anything at all
and you will love the one that hurts
don't whip me for forgiveness
and I would never be spared
No policeman could ever fit your crime
to turn your back and close your eyes

Nothing remains [x2]
Moving closer to you
you refresh from the corpse
can't remember my name
as I descend into the dirt

Slowly laughing their names
someone has got to fade

The only thing that makes you feel satisfied
can only look the one that hurts

Nothing remains [x2]
Moving closer to you
you refresh from the corpse
Can't remember my name
as I descend into the dirt
Nothing remains - nothing remains [x2]

Nothing remains [x2]
You move closer to you
you refresh from the corpse
can't remember my name
as I descend into the dirt

Nothing remains - nothing remains [x2]

Moving closer to you
You refresh from the corpse
can't remember my name
as I descend into the dirt
