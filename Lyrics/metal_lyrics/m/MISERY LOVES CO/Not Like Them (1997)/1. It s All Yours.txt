Sometimes I wish I could be like you
Never easy to be me
I keep hurting myself
Without knowing why it had to affect me
The blackness of everything
didn't matter much to you
But did you ever say something
that wasn't a lie, something worthwhile

Burned a hole for all to see
to prove there is no God
Just don't ask me how I feel
I always hated to lie

It's all yours [x2]

We've got a failure to call our own
a reminder of what's to come
Thinking only of you as I'm
crawling to the point of no return
Do I need to erase myself
to cover up the scars?
Is there anything left?
the loss of it all nothing's worthwhile

Burned a hole for all to see
to prove there is no God
Just don't ask me how I feel
I always hated to lie

It's all yours [x2]
It's all... [x2]
It's all
It's all... [x2]

Burned a hole for all to see
to prove there is no God
Just don't ask me how I feel
I always hated to lie

It's all yours [x2]
It's all yours [x4]
