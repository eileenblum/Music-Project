Information gave me a choice,
Kill everything or more
I'm so very happy now,
according to my teenage whore
Hear my voice but it's not me,
I will always disagree.
Inhale then fade away
everything's different today.
Now I got me a new religion,
It will get me into shape.
I've changed personality
the old one always made me hate
So comfortable to stand in line
Keeps the voices out of my mind
The real thing's never what it seems 
in a world of a million lies

A million lies - A million lies
A million lies - in a world of a million lies

Those insects drove me mad
always there to distract
To show my disbelief
I painted every fucker black
Wanna crawl all over you
Suck the smell of your dirty skin
Who could ever ask for more
in a world of a million lies

A million lies - A million lies
A million lies - in a world of a million lies

Suck the dirt of my skin... [x2]

Information gave me a choice,
Kill everything or more
I'm so very happy now,
according to my teenage whore

A million lies - A million lies
A million lies - in a world of a million lies
[Repeat x3]

Suck the dirt of my skin... [x2]
