Between these walls,
we were so safe
our perfect home would not
let anything disturbing in.
A swastika's been carved,
everything's so quiet,
no one's seen or heard a thing

Smell the fear, feel the heat
Burn my skin, paint it black

Forced to submit, silent agreement
something clean wasted by disease
Seek for strength,
in the common weakness
what gave you the right,
you had no...

Feed the creep [x4]

The only thing is absence
???

Now, the message is clear,
we've all gone blind,
can only see
what we wanna believe.
A swastika's been carved,
everything's so quiet,
what gave you the right,
you had no fucking right
no fucking right

Feed the creep [x8]

Smell the fear, feel the heat
Burn my skin, paint it black
paint it black
Smell the fear, feel the heat
Burn my skin, paint it black

Feed the creep [x8]
