Who will make the decision
to kill what's already dead?
The silence kept drowning my voice
When I had so much more to say

I pretend I'm asleep again
because I don't want you to know
Can I escape from myself
and my fear to meet your eye?
I can smell your inside,
It's all over me by now
Though I'm as close as can be
I have never felt so alone
We fuck cause we have to
If we don't there's something wrong
pushing each other downhill
At least we're partners in this crime.

Why don't you prove me wrong,
show me what I can't see,
make me understand,
help me to understand...
Why don't you prove me wrong,
show me what I can't see,
help me

So things come and go,
and they sure went fast this time.
Strong hands big promises
gave me nothing to believe at all.
Turned me into a timebomb,
ready to explode in everyone's face.
Who would hear my confession
We don't listen anymore
No one can say we did not
carry the missing well.
Forever in debt to you for not
being what you wished of me?
Things got so difficult when I knew
that I could never win
thought I was out of my mind
to even think the way I did.

Why don't you prove me wrong,
show me what I can't see,
make me understand,
help me understand...
Why don't you prove me wrong,
show me what I can't see,

Why don't you prove me wrong,
show me what I can't see,
make me understand,
help me understand...
Why don't you prove me wrong,
show me what I can't see,
make me understand,
I wanna understand...
[Repeat x3]

We fuck cause we have to
If we don't there's something wrong
pushing each other downhill
At least we're partners in this crime.
