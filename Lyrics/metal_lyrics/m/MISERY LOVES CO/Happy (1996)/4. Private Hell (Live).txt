I know we're going up
I know what brings me down
what brings me down
the look on johnny's face
tells me how I feel
just how I feel - how I feel
got to go away
no reason to stay
until you fuckers fall down
no longer wanna kill myself
suicide is cheap
the rest of the world can die
the rest of the world can die

see them all break down
see them all break down
see them all break down

voices around me so strong
words that drown the thought
hard to tell right from wrong
didn't know how to figure it out
but the look on johnny's face
I know it is for real
I'm living a lie
but so are you
your not the one who's locked in a zoo
could do without your good advice
so get the fuck out of
on my private hell
my private hell
my private hell

see them all break down
see them all break down
see them all break down
pull!
see them all break down
see them all break down
break down

gotta get away
no reason to stay
they all get their share on judgement day
watching them all fall down and die

see them all break down - see them all break down
see them all break down - break down
see them all break down - see them all break down
see them all break down - see them all break down

in my private hell - my private hell
in my private hell - my private hell
in my private hell - my private hell

in my private
in my private
in my private hell
in my private hell
