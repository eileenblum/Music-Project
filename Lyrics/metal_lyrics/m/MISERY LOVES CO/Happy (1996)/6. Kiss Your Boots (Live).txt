you push me up
against the wall
with your so called truth
behind your back
I know you built your conviction on hollow ground
but time as time you rise again

I wanna kiss your boots
I wanna kiss your boots
I wanna shine your boots
I wanna kiss your boots

gotta go to - burn
put a bullet you cannot touch - die
you play your game for self pitiness
you start to cut the crap
open up your mind

I wanna kiss your boots
I wanna kiss your boots
I wanna kiss your boots

lets smash the face of opposition
lets smash the face of opposition - you
lets smash the face of opposition - ladies and gentlemen

you push me up
against the wall
with your so called truth
behind your back

I wanna kiss your boots
I wanna kiss your boots
I wanna shine your boots
I wanna kiss your boots

live in fear
live in fear

lets smash the face of opposition - do
lets smash the face of opposition - live in fear

wanna kiss your boots - live in fear
kiss your boots
wanna kiss your boots - live in fear
kiss your boots - ah! hahahahaha!
wanna kiss your boots
kiss your boots - live in fear
wanna kiss your boots
kiss your boots - ah! hahahahaha!
wanna kiss your boots
kiss your boots

live in fear
live in fear
live in fear
