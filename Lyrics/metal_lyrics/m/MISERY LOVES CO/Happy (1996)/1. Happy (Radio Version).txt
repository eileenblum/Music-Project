always want what I haven't got
wanna be what I am not
you wish me somewhere I can't be seen
I am caught where I've never been
your feelings become mine for a while
as I realize your stronger than I
the freak show is about to begin
as I turn around and let you in
and let you in
I don't know what I wanna be
searching for someone, don't look at me
I just want what I haven't got
I just shoot and something dies
find it hard to explain
so how can you understand
I'm killing things with this razor blade
makin'' sure a price gets paid
a price gets paid

I'm happy with my misery
please leave me be
there's nothing wrong with me, you see
I'm happy with my misery
I'm happy
I'm happy

get the phone - get the phone

though I try to kick you out of this haze
been like this for weeks and days
what is now and what have I said
I really don't know
I really can't tell
creeping along these walls of hate
quiet, don't wanna complicate
saying to myself once more
forever never, never more
never more

get the picture - get the picture
get the picture - get the picture

I'm happy with my misery
please leave me be
there's nothing wrong with me, you see
I'm happy with my misery

happy with my misery
please leave me be
there's nothing wrong with me, you see
I'm happy with my misery

happy with my misery
please leave me be
there's nothing wrong with me, you see
I'm happy with my misery

happy with my misery
please leave me be
there's nothing wrong with me, you see
I'm happy with my misery
