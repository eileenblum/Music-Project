don't choose
try to lie
in error
just give me a gun
I deliver the bill
killing is my business
business is good
soon you worry
I won't do what I should
this is no dream
this is no dream

fifty minutes of hell
then eternal sleep
pull along your sleigh
for your soul to keep
I lock the door
no etiquette
not a border pass
that's what you'll pay
this is no dream
this is no dream
this is for real

here it is
fight it man
you know who I am

I'm the new lord
stay away
a viscious grin
the holy spirit
will preach or will sing
just take my hand
and I'll put you to bed
I'll sing you my lullabies till your dead

I'm the new lord
stay away
a viscious grin
the holy spirit
will preach or will sing
just take my hand
and I'll punch you to bed
and send you my lullabies till your dead

for real
no dream
dream
no dream

this is no dream
this is for real
this is no dream

let me
and shoot me
in my own way

let me
and shoot me
in my own way

this is no dream
this is for real

this is no dream
this is for real

no dream
this is no dream
this is no dream
this is for real
no dream
no dream
this is no dream
