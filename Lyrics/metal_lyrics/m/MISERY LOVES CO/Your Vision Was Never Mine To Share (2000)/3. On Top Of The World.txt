I could see it coming, I had my fingers crossed,
behind my back this time
Tonight we'll celebrate every garbage win
we've ever lost in this world
Movin'to the beat, of the rain that falls,
just like you will:Just like I will:

A fantastic failure, one to remember,
when tomorrow comes
And I don't care no more, I just wanna touch
that magic escape over again
If there's a time and place, will you tell me when,
bring me consolation on a plate

No one can stop us now
cause we got nothing more to lose tonight
We're standing on top of the world tonight
Arms held out in a state of mind
a perfect failure for the ones outside

The personal failures are out of sight
when all is forgotten will you help me rewind?
We're standing on top of the world tonight
We're on top of the world tonight
