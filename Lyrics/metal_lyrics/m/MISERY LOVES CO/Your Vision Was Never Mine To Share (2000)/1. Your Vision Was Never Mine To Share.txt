Your vision was never mine to share
To occupied with your shit to even care
I smell a world filled with dirty green
Wanna refill it with gasoline

To live for tomorrow seems so sad
Smalltown revolution in this dream I had
Ever felt you're being pushed aside?
Their piece of the cake, always oversized

Reality's far to unreal for me
The kings and the queens won't get my sympathy
They stumble and fall blinded by dirty green
Fake communication through tv screens

Your vision was never mine to share
