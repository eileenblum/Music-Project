There's a thousand eyes in my bed
keeping me awake at night
And it's so frustrating to see you drown
your face under water drifting away

Did I ever do something good
or anything really bad?
How I wish it could have been me instead
I've played the part so many times
in this fucked up world

This just might be our last night on earth
I'd really like to spend it with you, inside of you
You bring me close to heaven, I'm hanging to dry
Soon your eyes will warm me up
You say that:

This just might be our last night on earth
It really does'nt matter to me, let it burn tonight!

This fucked up world did'nt give us a choice
The taste of a touch burning under your skin

I'm willing to loose myself, I'm ready to tear a hole
To rise and fall back down
Now I wanna float inside, I need to do it right
To rise and fall back down
