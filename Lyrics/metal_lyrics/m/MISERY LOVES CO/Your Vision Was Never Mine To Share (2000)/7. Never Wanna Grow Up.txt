Day in day out feeling so incomplete
Living under their thumb
So much to say but nothing comes out
With every thought comes the doubt

It falls, it breaks
Same moves, handshakes
There is no surprises
Legendary crises

No friends to embrace as the going gets tough
Everyone is gone
Swallowed every lie about a place in the sun
Can you feel it grow:Let it show!

It's not my world
I am never gonna grow up
There is nothing in it for me
The way you speak
makes me wanna stay a child
There is nothing in it for me
