I tear it open wide, then I watch it heal
A thousand reasons why I am damaging the surface
A scratch gently pulls me out, beautiful second, such a relief
I'm always stuck in the fall, as I cut it open, watch it heal

I tear it open wide
Then I watch it heal
A thousand reasons why

I let it be revealed, no one told me to stop
Movin'faster now, have to damage the surface
I might be breathing still, I only wish I could understand
The taste of a sacrifice as I cut it open, watch it heal

Disconnect the pain
Damage driven creep
Going further down
