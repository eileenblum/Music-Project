White walls, a room that's much to small,
I can't move
How did I get here, who's to blame,
every fuckin'one
Burnmarks on the floor, we've waited to long,
can you see me?
Is this a place where we begin' Maybe this is
where it all ends:

The broken glass explains it all,
I want out
I've been here once before,
seeing what it did to you
So many reasons to escape,
am I someone?
What you accomplished I despise,
I can never go back there again

I can't move:
How did I get here, who's to blame?
Every fuckin'one!
Burnmarks on the floor we've waited to long,
can you:

Dive! So follow me down, it's so much scarier
Crawl! Don't turn around cause I will follow you to
Follow me down, no easy way out
Don't turn around, there's no exit this time
