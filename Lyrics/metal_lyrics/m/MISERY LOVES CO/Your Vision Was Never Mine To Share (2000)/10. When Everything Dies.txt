Create, rearrange, wish the rain could stop
My blood, tell no lie, coming out of my veins
Colors disappear, I need a breakthrough
This place is somewhere I never believed in
Don't know what it means when everything dies
When everything dies

Be there instantly when two worlds collide
Disrespect a fake, facelift for the sick
Leaving me the same way as you found me
I think I'll stay with my imaginary friends
Wish the rain could stop when everything dies

This is somewhere I never believed in
I will be there when two worlds collide
This is somewhere I never believed in
I will be there when everything dies
