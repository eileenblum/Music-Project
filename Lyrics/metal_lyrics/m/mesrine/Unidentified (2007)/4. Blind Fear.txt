I awake
Blindfolded
My hands tied to my back

My mouth gagged
I can't scream
I don't know where I am

Blind fear, misunderstood
Blind fear, out of control

Painful screams all around me
Odor of death
I hear footsteps near me
I don't know what will occur

Panic builds up inside
Feelings of impotence
Is this my last hour?
Is this my last breath?

Blind fear, misunderstood
Blind fear, out of control

I make a prayer
My good-byes to this life
When hands
Seize me...
