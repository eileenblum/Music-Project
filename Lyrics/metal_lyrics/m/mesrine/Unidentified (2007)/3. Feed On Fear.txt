I want to feel, to see, fear in your eyes
Sorrow, despair, gets me so high
I have control, you'll never be free
I want to feel, you sink in distress

Victim of situation
Tool for my satisfaction
Object of my perversion
Observer of my perdition

To see you trembling, makes me cum
Terror in your face
And the pleasure comes
