9 to 5 little worm
Take it in the ass
Shut up and obey

Humiliated, dominated
Everyone shits on him

When the night comes
The little worm
Becomes a monster

Humiliation, domination
You will pay for the others

Strangulation, mutilation
In my life I'm nothing
I'm rejected
Here, I have the power

Strangulation, mutilation
Finally I'm someone
With your life in my hands
Here, I have the power

9 am go to work
Become the shit
That nobody
Can suspect
