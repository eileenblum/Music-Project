Years and years, repressed desires
Now is the time, fantasy becomes real
You'll realize your deepest wishes
King for a day, be the master today

Stronger than all, you must continue
Someone must stop you
You can't stop by yourself

This is the first time but not the last
The taste to do it again
Comes back quickly

Prisoner of your passion
It's not a choice now, anymore

Breaking the ice, breaking life
Vicious circle, again and again...

Your first victim
Again and again...
