Deadly star-system
Created by the media
Keeps the violence
To sell their bloody shit

More fuckin' money
On collective paranoia
Deification
Of best-selling killers

More blood means more money
Exploiting to fill their pockets

People know the criminals
The victims nobody cares
The world is upside down
Serial killer superstar

The media is also guilty
Making shows with misery
