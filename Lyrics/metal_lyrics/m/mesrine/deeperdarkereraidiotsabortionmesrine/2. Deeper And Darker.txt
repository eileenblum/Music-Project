[performed by Mesrine]Welcome in this trip
To the dark side of your mind
Take a seat and we'll go
Deeper and darker

Deeper and darker
The trip will be long
Deeper and darker
You won't come back intact

We'll go far away from the light
To see all that you repress, all that you hide
A trip behind the mask
At the heart of what you are
What nobody will see
What yourself will deny

Concealed in the shadows, at the darkest point
Your worst thoughts are hidden down in the dust
We'll open all the doors that you keep locked
You'll see all your weaknesses, fears and humiliations
It's useless to close your eyes, useless to play the fool
'Cause all you see here is in you, all you see here IS YOU!!
