No one really knows who I am, or what Iâve done in my life
We all have things we want to hide, we donât want others to know
I did terrible things that Iâm not proud of
There is no witness, no one can speak
God only knows who I am
Even my victim does not know

God only knows
[2x]

Only between me and god, my secret is well kept
And if it does not exist, it is even better

A life lived without saying anything, only between me and god
You donât have to know everything, we all have our secrets
