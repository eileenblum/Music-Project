[performed by Mesrine]Fate of a life in one hand
A loaded gun in the other one
Mother gives life and killer takes it back
Power to give life or power to give death

Now I'm the king of your world
The hand of God over your head

I have the choice, a divine strength
All depends on me, becoming God
I have control, I decide how and when
Shut up and obey, now I am God

Get down on your knees and pray the fuckin' Lord
For your salvation, my mercy, but it never comes

Get down on your knees and pray the Lord between my legs
Get down on your knees and pray the Lord before you die
