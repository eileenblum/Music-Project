[performed by Mesrine]Me, myself and I
I don't care for your life
My pleasure is my goal
You're my tool for more

My pain or your pain
It's not your lucky day
I'm a serial selfish
You're nothing in my eve

My ego go through yourself, take off your life
Delete you, erase you, my ego destroy all in you

I am, I can
I want, I do

I am, I can
I want, I take
