Within a shrine
A sacred seal is hidden
The power of infinite life
Wisdom of the gods

Symbolic Immortality!

Ancient rites
Secrets not mean to be known
The preserver of youth
It's a curse of the damned

Beyond the walls of sleep
Lies the secret to immortality
Through the threshold of dreams
This truth is revealed

Inverted truth
False tale of madness
Jest of the elders
It's all a fools game

Symbolic Immortality!
