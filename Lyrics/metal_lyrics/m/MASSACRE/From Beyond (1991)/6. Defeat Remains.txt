Sit beside the fallen slain
In rivers of agony flows their tears
The prophets dream fades
No light shines from his face

Hear the morbid call
Across the ruins of crawling death
Warriors heads bowed in shame
For they have failed their king

Distorted balance as the gates torn free
The enemy roams in the lords domain
His soldiers lay in havoc
And nothing but...Defeat Remains!

Within the darkest soul
Lies the reflection of man
In the fears of the innocent
Lies the answer to this all

From beyond shall cometh doom
Chaos will now return
An overload reigns in terror
In the - Kingdom of the damned
