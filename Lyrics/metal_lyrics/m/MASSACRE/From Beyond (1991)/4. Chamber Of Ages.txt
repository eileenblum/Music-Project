Deep within the death chamber
Of rancid infectious decay
Torrid bodies sent through ages
Of roten deteriorating life

[Chorus:]
Ash To Ash...Dust to dust
Life after death

Rigor mortis cadaverous remains
Cremation into ash
Journey beyond eternity
Bones disintegrate to dust

[Repeat chorus]

Agony and pain seems to exist
Tortured as maggots infest
Torment bodily dismemberment
Transmutate into rot!
