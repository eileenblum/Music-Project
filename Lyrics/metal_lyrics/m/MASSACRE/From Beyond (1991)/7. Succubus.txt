Invoked from the cruptic realms
This grotesque spirit calls...
Invader of the beds of man
To rob the liquid of life!

[Chorus:]
Harlot of Death - spectre in red
Mistress of Lust - the Succubus!

Invisible fiend of nocturnal haunts
She rapes the will of man...
To impregnate her feverous womb
With the larvae of the damned!

[Repeat chorus]

Infused with the human seed
The screaming shade fades...
Only to return to darkness
To birth her morbid child

[Repeat chorus]
