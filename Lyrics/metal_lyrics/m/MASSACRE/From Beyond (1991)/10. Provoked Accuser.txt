The prphet dreams
Tragedy shall prevail
Apocalyptic horror
A revelation of death
Journey into fear
Where the hordes of chaos lurk
Ride of tempest winds
Across the mountains of madness

Phantasmagoria begins
Delusions of terror
Resurrection done
Frome beyond it comes

Hopeless fate
Domination from the inner void
The astral gates
Reopen for exilement

Provoked accuser awakes
Arise from the cryptic realms
Crawling chaos near
As the watcher peers through fearful eyes...

Cross the spheres of reality
Out of a world of shadow
Aggressive tyrant returns
To bring the terminal end!
