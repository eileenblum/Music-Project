Why make a promise you wonât keep
You know I donât believe in your lies

You lied (all lies)
You bend the truth
Iâm blind (so blind)
Iâm such a fool

Why even say that youâll be with me forever
You know forever is never forever

Iâm depressed (depressed)
With a heavy heart
No hope (so hopeless)
Iâm at a loss

Suffer me (suffering)
Unto this agony
Drown in me (drowning)
In depths of misery

Broken down (so broken)
In grim visage
Watch me laugh (Iâm laughing)
On the wrong side of the mouth

Suffer me (suffering)
Unto this agony
Drowning (drowning)
In depths of misery

I feel the sorrow so deep inside
This anguish I suffer from all your lies
I seek release from all this madness
Shrouded in despair â consumed by sadness

Suffer me (suffering)
Unto this agony
Drowning (drowning)
In depths of misery

I believed her, she lied
Where dwells sadness, inside of me
Where stems the madness, in me!
She lied
