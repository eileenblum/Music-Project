Thereâs a crack in the mirror
And a bloodstain on the bed
Thereâs a crack in the mirror
And a bloodstain on the bed
O you were a vampire and baby
Iâm walking dead
O you were a vampire and baby
Iâm walking dead

I got the ways and means
To new Orleans Iâm going
Down by the river
Where itâs warm and green
Iâm gonna have a drink, and walk around
I got a lot to think about oh yeah

Thereâs a rocking chair by the window
Down the hall
I hear something there in the shadow
Down the hall
O you were a vampire and now I am
Nothing at all
O you were a vampire and now I am
Nothing at all

I got the ways and means
To new Orleans Iâm going
Down by the river
Where itâs warm and green
Iâm gonna have a drink, and walk around
I got a lot to think about oh yeah

They used to dance in the garden in the
Middle of the night
Dancing out in the garden in the
Middle of the night
O you were a vampire
And now Iâll never see the light
O you were a vampire
And now Iâll never see the light

I got the ways and means
To new Orleans Iâm going
Down by the river
Where itâs warm and green
Iâm gonna have a drink, and walk around
I got a lot to think about
I got the ways and means
To new Orleans Iâm going
Down by the river
Where itâs warm and green
Iâm having a drink and walking around
I got a lot to think about oh yeah
