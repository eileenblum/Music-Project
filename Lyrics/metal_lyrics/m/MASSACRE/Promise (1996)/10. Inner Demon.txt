I infest your mind
Youâre not part of me
I possess your soul
Get the fuck out of me

Twisted voice from deep inside
Twisting schemes in my mind
No room for reason
Screams my inner demon
Inner demon

I enhance your hate
You just bring me pain
I distort your love
Itâs already been slain

Broken feelings transform my thoughts
Mistaken senses begin to rot
No chance to reason
With my inner demon

Omni-presence felt â everywhere it dwells
Sanity departs â domination starts â ya
Inner demon

I control your life
Youâve already begun
I command your being
Itâs already been done

Grotesque visions become so real
Distorted dreams now prevail
I now have reason
To unlock this demon

I have opened your mind
I unite with you
I now own your soul
I give myself to you

Understand what itâs all for
Realise itâs how I endure
Done for this reason
Release my inner demon
Demon
Demon
Demon
