Black soil nest
Where she remains
Hamony cracked
When she died

You know what Iâve always enjoyed
Was the smell of the dead â ya

Remember her promise
Together forever
Not even death
Will keep us apart

Like a moth to a flame
Iâm drawn to her
I hunger for her touch
I long for her

I never could understand that boyâs
Obsession with dead things

Black soil nest
Black soil nest

Like a moth to a flame
Iâm drawn to her
I hunger for her touch
I long for her

The time has come
To be reunited
Down in this grave
Her caress is cold

Like a moth to a flame
Iâm drawn to her
I hunger for her touch
I long for her

Black soil nest
Black soil nest
Black soil nest
Black soil nest
