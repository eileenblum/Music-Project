What is it you want from me
Iâve nothing to give
Youâve taken everything
You didnât leave me shit

Not even worth mentioning
Not even worth a thought
Not worth the pain
Not worth speaking of

I thought that once I meant something
But now I see Iâm nothing â nothing

What is this youâve done to me
What is it you thrive
Do you enjoy making me
Feel unalive

Not even worth mentioning
Not even worth a thought
Not worth the pain
Not worth speaking of

I thought to you I meant something
But now I see Iâm nothing â nothing

Itâs you Iâll always love
I know you donât care
You left me, in despair

Why do I feel this way
Why do I even care
I have no self esteem
Thereâs nothing there
Iâm so unimportant
- insignificant â
The way I truly feel
Makes no difference

I wish for once I could be something
But I guess Iâll always be your nothing
Nothing

Itâs what Iâll always be â nothing
Nothing - nothing
Nothing - nothing
Nothing - nothing
Nothing - nothing
