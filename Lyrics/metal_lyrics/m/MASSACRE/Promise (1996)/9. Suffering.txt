I suffer
And writhe in pain
The agony I feel
Bares your name
Iâm trapped
In this hell you create
Your lack of love
Fuels my hate

I live for tomorrow
But I die each day
Iâm lost in sorrow
Take the suffering away

I remember when there wasnât any pain
I remember when it didnât hurt

I laugh
At the promise you made
The stab in the back
xxxxxxxxxxxxxx blade
I scream
At your lies and all
The depths of this misery
From the nightmare you cause

I live for tomorrow
But I die each day
Iâm lost in sorrow
Take the suffering away

Iâll show you what itâs like to suffer

Know what itâs like to wanna die
Take your life â suicide
This agony you caused me
I need to end â the suffering

Suffer â suffering â suffer

I suffer
And writhe in pain
This agony I feel
Bares your name
Iâm trapped
In this hell you create
Your lack of love
Fuels my hate

I live for tomorrow
But I die each day
Iâm lost in sorrow
Take the suffering away
Take the suffering away
Take the suffering away
Take the suffering away
The suffering
