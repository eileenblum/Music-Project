I am alone
My grief eternal
All love is lost
Iâm shrouded in despair
Despair â despair

Iâm cast onto shade
I hear tragic serenades
And her promise stings
In the back of my mind

Her promise stings
With tears in my eyes
With tears in my eyes
So sadden and worn
So sadden and worn
Set me free of this pain
Set me free of this pain
I forever torn
I forever torn

I fade to black
Escape memories that burn
Paradise is drowning
Deep on waters of lethe... ya

Unremembered harmony
Massacred adoration
Deviated truth
Sink into oblivion

Her luke warm amorous
So lucid and clear
Tender hands to ravage claws
Ripping out my heart

This pain is forever
With tears in my eyes
With tears in my eyes
So sadden and worn
So sadden and worn
Set me free of this pain
Set me free of this pain
I forever torn
I forever torn
With tears in my eyes
With tears in my eyes
So sadden and worn
So sadden and worn
Set me free of this pain
Set me free of this pain
I forever torn
I forever torn
