You say Iâm so different
So apathetic and smug
What the fuck do you expect
After what you have done

The way I live my life
To the bitter end
Full of hate and rage
To the bitter end
I truly hate you
I fucking despise you

Donât ask forgiveness
You wonât get shit from me
I donât forgive, I donât forget
You wonât get off that easy

The way I live my life
To the bitter end
Full of hate and rage
To the bitter end
I truly hate you
I fucking despise you

I canât believe what you have done
After all, I thought we were friends
I thought weâd always be together
Forever together to the bitter end
You told me so many fucking lies
Youâve become such a fucking whore
I wonât take your shit anymore
I wonât take your shit anymore

You say Iâm so hostile
A malicious spiteful jerk
Well my unbeloved bitch
Thatâs how I act when Iâm hurt

The way I live my life
To the bitter end
Full of hate and rage
To the bitter end
I truly hate you
I fucking despise you

Thatâs right, you stupid cunt
I fucking hate you to the bitter end
