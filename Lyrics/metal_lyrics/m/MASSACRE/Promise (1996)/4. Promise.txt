Promise

Tell me why youâve become so damned unconsenting
The way you make me feel is so condescending

So help me!
Cross my heart and hope to die
You swore on your God
You never told a lie

So commit yourself to me
Under hand and seal
Undertake this sacred oath
Immolate this deal
On your word of honour
Consummate this pact
Bind yourself with me
Finalise this act

Promise me...promises...promising...
Promise me the world
Promise me...promises...promising...
Promise me the world

Make vows you wonât keep
I canât trust in your word
If you think you can fool me
Then you must be absurd
You say youâve been faithful
On this you swear
Thereâs nothing to see
Cause nothingâs there

Do you really expect me to give credence in this deception
When I know your truth is nothing but perversion

You think you can lie to me
And get away with it all
You think that Iâm a jerk
Canât believe your gall
I should have always known
It would never last
Iâll never forget
Lies form the past

Promise me...promises...promising...
Promise me the world
Promise me...promises...promising...
Promise me the world
Promise me...promises...promising...
Promise me the world
Promise me...promises...promising...
Promise me the world
Promise me...promises...promising...
Promise me the world
Promise me...promises...promising...
Promise me the world
