The end has come to see with Armageddon drawing near
Millions fall to their knees, fools begging for salvation
Why don't they open their eyes
And realize no one will save them?
Lost revelation of lies unanswered is their plead to live

Blindly they followed false faith, the time of judgment waits
The flock's been laid to pasture, you will succumb to rapture

Hatred rising with destruction of man
Chaos rampant no affirmative plan
Only the rich find a way to survive
The poor and desolate surely will die

Overactive minds will think
Destined for extinction
Within the written passages
Invoke the master plan

Who will answer your prayers, when all is said and done?
Arms outstretched to the sky, embrace the days of darkness

The end has come to see with Armageddon drawing near
Millions fall to their knees, fools begging for salvation
They never opened their eyes and now they won't be saved
We're meeting our demise, the world is engulfed in flames

Blindly they followed false faith, the time of judgment waits
The flock's been laid to pasture, you will succumb to rapture
