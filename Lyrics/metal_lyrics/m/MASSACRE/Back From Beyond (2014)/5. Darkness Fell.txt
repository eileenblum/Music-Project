Lockdown, the system has failed
No concern for impending repercussion 
Crippled government unstable to sway
Leaders divided, unwilling to devise
Plans of intent to save a nation in decline
Motion to direct

Bankrupt in denial, spitting venomous lies
No one held to task, heading for disaster
A country in the black, poor is just a word
There's no relief in sight as darkness fell

The calls to impeach these powers that be
Internal suicide what else don't we know
Deceitful to the masses dishonest clandestine
Defaulting for our weakness impoverished we've become

Bankrupt in denial, spitting venomous lies
No one held to task, heading for disaster
A country in the black, poor is just  a word
There's no relief in sight as darkness fell

Convention of the senate, lawless union the assembly
Broken council has fallen, convocation to deflect
Converging on a hill in the chambers of stupidity
Constitution torn to shreds, the people now asunder
Attribute to the bribes what money cannot buy
Society unhinged pray there won't be all out war!

Bankrupt in denial, spitting venomous lies
No one held to task, heading for disaster
A country in the black, poor is just  a word
There's no relief in sight depleted and drained
Authority deformed, paralyzed regime
Bureaucracy impaired as darkness fell
