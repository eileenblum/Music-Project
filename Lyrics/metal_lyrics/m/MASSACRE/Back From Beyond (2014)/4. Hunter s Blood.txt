Stained is the kindred's soil
Media reaper, lust the gore
Kept under glass to never question
Paid off by the hounds of war
Silence must never be broken
Your dreams are all but lost
Carry the corpse of freedom
Demise at all cost

Our own killing fields, scapegoats taken of life
Enshroud in mystery, deaf ears fall on the blind
Stalked target, a causality, swarm for the hunter's blood

Numb to murder unjustified
Vultures circle the mass grave
Inhale the stench of the dead future
Unworthy to be saved
Crushed by the fist of vengeance
Conflicts of power cannot be won
Retaliation in disguise
The massacre has begun

Our own killing fields, scapegoats taken of life
Enshroud in mystery, deaf ears fall on the blind
Stalked target, a causality, swarm for the hunter's blood

Sacrifice from above
Desolating ghost machines
Drones set out for the kill
Eradication doom from the skies
Bringers of mortality
Condemned absent judgment
Humanity led astray
Liberty shattered prepare for revolt

Our own killing fields, scapegoats taken of life
Enshroud in mystery, deaf ears fall on the blind
Stalked target, a causality, swarm for the hunter's blood
The blood of the hunted
