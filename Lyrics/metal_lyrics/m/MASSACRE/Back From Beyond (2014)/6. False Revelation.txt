The truth of man it is untold
Since the beginning of time
To evolve from nothing
Creation divine
Find ourselves in constant question
What is known it makes no sense
They say the body has a soul
That can never die

Following tales of apples and snakes
Claims written and doctored through time
Salvation is at stake, in doctrine a testament
Confirmation of the golden shrine
Penance through prayers, to clear the sins of mankind

People fear in their beliefs, the idols that are praised
Taught to live by the book and words will show them the way
And by the seventh day all was made

Following tales of apples and snakes
Claims written and doctored through time
Salvation is at stake, in doctrine a testament
Confirmation of the golden shrine
Penance through prayers, to clear the sins of mankind

Promises through worship
Damnation cast out
The body and the blood
And still we're disavowed
Warnings of the impending wrath
Like that of the worldwide flood and plague

The offering of tides, helping guilt slip by
A stranglehold on faith, as you kneel and pray
Does this deter the end? Or is it all just pretend?
No afterlife has been shown
With all this, what do we really know?

Feelings of peace, tranquility, blinding light
Revelations of nothing

Following tales of apples and snakes
Claims written and doctored through time
Salvation is at stake, in doctrine a testament
Confirmation of the golden shrine
Penance through prayers, to clear the sins of mankind
