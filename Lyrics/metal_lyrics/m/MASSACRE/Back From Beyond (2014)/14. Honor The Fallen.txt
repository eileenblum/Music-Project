Hail the valor, the sacrifice was made
Only the dead have seen the true end
A legacy built by years of memories
Suffering so tragic to always remind

The shock of this is so unreal
To mourn this loss would be unjust
We celebrate the inspiration that was given
To always honor the fallen

All you created will always live on
Those impacted would never have been
Force of essence will never be destroyed
Even though sadness flows deep inside

The final vision in exile
The thought so hard to believe
Pay back the praise for all the years
Your cult built to the extreme
Disciple gone but not forgotten
Your bloodline never will cease

The shock of this is so unreal
To mourn this loss would be unjust
We celebrate the inspiration that was given
To always honor the fallen

To forever rule in blood
Prepare for the guardian of death
In the equinox of the abyss
At sunrise you shall sleep
