Republic tyranny, in a time long since past
Arose a power, fierce, engaged to overthrow
Within one man, born, his destiny to lead
Absent fear, dominant, his strength from the gods

Revenge set forth the goal, Warriors free from slaves
Unshackled from control, dictatorship to be seized
Rebels oppressed no more, determined to be free
Shadow of death, to meet the bitter end
Legacy of legends, paths have been entwined
Empires are left shattered, in the lost sands of time

Defeating legions, carnage in the wake
Controlling victory thousands fall from ranks
Tacticians plotting, decipher every move that's made
Apostasy unbound in the war of the damned

Revenge set forth the goal, warriors free from slaves
Unshackled from control, dictatorship to be seized
Rebels oppressed no more, determined to be free
Shadow of death, to meet the bitter end
Legacy of legends, paths have been entwined
Empires are left shattered, in the lost sands of time

Gods of the arena, vengeance since enslaved
Battleground the butchering, armies of mass graves
Enemies of honor, wolves are at the gates
Acts of decimation, the spoils of their fates

Revenge set forth the goal, warriors free from slaves
Unshackled from control, dictatorship to be seized
Rebels oppressed no more, determined to be free
Shadow of death, to meet the bitter end
Legacy of legends, paths have been entwined
Empires are left shattered, in the lost sands of time
