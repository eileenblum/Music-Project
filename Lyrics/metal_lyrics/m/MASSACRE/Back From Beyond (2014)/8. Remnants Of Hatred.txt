In the deepest places of the mind
It cannot hide, labeled insane
Thoughts of grandeur the psycho kind
Visions of murder that turns real
Watching frantic as you sleep
No one will ever hear the screams
Schizophrenic but who cares
Delusions steal the wakened state
Hedonistic in every conceived way

On the hunt looking for prey
Thirst to kill completely deranged
Without care destroyer of lives
Remnants of hatred reborn from inside

The thrill to see victims in pain
Absorb the lust that they obtain
Domination as your life is drained
Control of power comfort bleeds
Shackled entombed by this disease
The media make them out to be like kings

On the hunt looking for prey 
Thirst to kill completely deranged
Without care, destroyer of lives
Remnants of hatred reborn from inside

Dismantle, desolation, ravages of devastation
Destroy, consume, animal instincts from the womb
Confusion, erase, extirpate without a trace
Abolished, suppressed, captured and now put to death

On the hunt looking for prey
Thirst to kill completely deranged
Without care, destroyer of lives
Remnants of hatred reborn from inside
