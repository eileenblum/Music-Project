Within these walls of madness
Piercing screams can be heard
That which has been lying dormant
Has risen back to life
Torment enslaves the masses
Malevolence through hate
Revenging those once scorned
Sealing of their fates

Buried and forgotten
Never to return
Havoc has been reawakened
Back from beyond

Dark seed abomination
Animosity unleashing pain
Witness horror disguised
Loathing all hostile contained
The scriptures prophesied
Aligning of the path
Uncaging rabid beast
The visions of their wrath

Buried and forgotten
Never to return
Havoc has been reawakened
Back from beyond

Back...Damnation unfolds
From...Where no light is cast
Beyond...Faded to obscurity

Creation unshackled alive the spirit
Witness second coming divine decree
Condemned to the shadows
Damned to be reborn
Hail the promise tyrants of death
Tyrants of death
The masses will crumble
Under remains of defeat
Within these walls of madness
Piercing screams have been heard
That which was dormant
Is now back to life
Torment enslaves the masses
Malevolence through hate
Revenging those once scorned
Sealed are their fates

Buried and forgotten
Never to return
Havoc has been reawakened
Back from beyond
