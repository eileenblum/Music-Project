Look deep into these crazed filled eyes
Bloodshot and filled with rage and hate
Damned and cursed long since birth
Body bound, confined to chains
Anxiously they wait for me to die
But not of the human kind...

Immersed into flesh, the mental scars awaken
Metamorphosis suppressed and now it must dominate
Arise from the shadows, the brutal beast with vengeance
A slave to the curse, bringer of all man's demise

Destroying all within its grasp
Blood foamed dripping from the teeth
To recreate all in its image
Or leave all to be extinct

Immersed into flesh, the mental scars awaken
Metamorphosis suppressed and now it must dominate
Arise from the shadows, the brutal beast with vengeance
A slave to the curse, bringer of all man's demise

What could kill this abomination?
An atrocity in creature form
Species survived through generations
Thriving on human blood
This entity must be erased
Cast out from existence
The only means....Riddled with silver

Immersed into flesh, the mental scars awaken
Metamorphosis suppressed and now it must dominate
Arise from the shadows, the brutal beast with vengeance
A slave to the curse, bringer of all man's demise

Hail the wolf
