On the loose, lunatic
Contorted mind, victims in search to find
Embrace this wicked, malevolent
Eternal agony, nightmare of wretchedness
Unsedated, scavenger of torment
Time to feed, the voices are controlling me

Hell no to mercy, no end to this pain
When blood isn't enough to satisfy the taste
Denying all that is sacred, compelled to betrayal
Septic thoughts give into temptation, it is the killing hour

On the loose, lunatic
Contorted mind, victims in search to find
Embrace this wicked, malevolent
Eternal agony, nightmare of wretchedness
Unsedated, scavenger of torment
Time to feed, the voices are controlling me

Deep in the eyes of madness
Vision forever stained
There's no use in running
But I'm down for the chase
Screams fill the hatred, giving life to the fiend
Taking in your terror before soul devouring

It's time to die (suffer)
You're caught in the fucking web of death (suffer)
A purgatory of misery infernal abyss (suffer)
No one can hear the cries of pain (suffer)
As daylight draws near, feel life fade (suffer)
This shattered tomb shall be your grave

On the loose, lunatic
contorted mind, victims in search of fiend
Embrace this wicked, malevolent
Eternal agony, nightmare of wretchedness
Unsedated, scavenger of torment
Time to feed, the voices are controlling me
