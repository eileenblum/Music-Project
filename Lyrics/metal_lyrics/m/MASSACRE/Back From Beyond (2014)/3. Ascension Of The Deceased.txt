Waking from an extensive sleep
An eerie feeling cold it looms
Nothing is really what it seems
Alone the fear it now consumes

What is seen and heard it begins to scare
Mutilated bodies, blood and gore, a living nightmare
Looking in the distance could it be the saving grace
What has been witnessed changed the human race

Ascension of the deceased

Fighting for survival
Instincts now arise
Mass loss of humanity
The end to all mankind

What is seen and heard it begins to scare
Mutilated bodies, blood and gore, a living nightmare
Looking in the distance, could it be the saving grace
What has been witnessed changed the human race

Ascension of the deceased

Mindless animated corpse
Rise of the inhumane
Quest for flesh, no mercy
Driving them insane
Disembodied spirits
Outnumbered, overrun
Phantoms of the living
Extinction crisis has begun

Ascension of the deceased

What is seen and heard it begins to scare
Mutilated bodies, blood and gore, a living nightmare
Looking in the distance, could it be the saving grace
What has been witnessed changed the human race
