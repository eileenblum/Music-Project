Do you need the walls to spread apart? something has been sent here,
To free you, I am told a rising power that will break you,
Break you out you will see your fantasy unfold.
It can be won We will be one.

So many eyes that never open too many chains that bind
The dreams that make us see there are no prisons in our kingdom.
Will you give your hand? Say "yes, Your Majesty!"
It can be won We will be one.
Always go on never saying you are done.

We are always looking for a place where magic passion soars.
You will find that if you're with us the magic is in your heart!
It can be won We will be one now can you see
The gift we bring Your Majesty!
