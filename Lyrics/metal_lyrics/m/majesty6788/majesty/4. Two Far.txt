Reaching too far away distance control no contact today waiting empty again
Leaving me here is there no end? Transcend!
Wait for me cannot you see it is only time?
Here for you hearts combined can only climb

Distance emotions on trial
We close our eyes transcending miles
Wait for me cannot you see it is only time?
Here for you hearts combined can only climb
Wait for me pour your heart inside of mine
Here for you love must stand this test of time
