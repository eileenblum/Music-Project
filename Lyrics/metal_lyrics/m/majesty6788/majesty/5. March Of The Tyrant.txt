The God of Emperor deliverer of rakis stages his royal ascent
For the time has come for the tyrant to unleash the golden path
The lease of their lives has been spent
Revealing shadows of his past taking charge of his own life
Distant to all mortal eyes never again the tyrant

The shock, the awe, the elation
There is no time, no distance ahead to continue
The fixity of visions determined
As God of emperor seizes thy Infinite grace
Transcending mystic worlds and time

Rage and confusion war for supremacy
Valuable insight producing effect
As he marches down the royal road
His entourage embraces never again
The shock, the awe, the elation

As Arrakis undergoes a ghostly shift
The lessons now learned capturing reality
As the long awaited sacrifice unfolds
The march of the tyrant will end
