Leaving the lives that have made us a wish in our eyes as we go
Tomorrow will speak for us wanting today finding strength as we take hold
When time comes to reach for a star how seemingly endless
And dark space can be look straight ahead through the blackness
So brilliant the light you will see!

We have already chosen our direction standing our ground while the clouds take us high
Some not as fortunate hearts still asleep can we stir their blood? can we teach them to fly?
Our elders have seen us grow strong a wish of the past has proven to be
Us, Vital we keep them alive as we remain loyal to our destiny

Vital Star a sanctum deep within our souls
Lights the way reach within you are not alone
This lifeblood flows inside us all
Infant dreams need full attention
Half a heart beats half as fast
