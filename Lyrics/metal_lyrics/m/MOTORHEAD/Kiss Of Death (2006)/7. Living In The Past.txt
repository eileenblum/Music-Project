Don't you speak of lies to me,
After all the deeds are done,
After all the smoking guns,
Don't speak to me of lies.
Don't you try to scold me now,
Don't you try to hold me now,
Don't start acting cold right now,
Don't you even try.
Nothing is the same for us,
All the times are changed for us,
All things fault and blame for us,
Good times laid aside.

So now we are the lost,
And now we are the last,
Living in a nightmare,
Broken dreams, love turned mean,
Living in the past.

Don't you speak to me no more,
After what you said before,
After all the things you swore,
Don't speak to me no more.
Don't you know the way we are,
Black enough to hide the stars,
Made us take our rage too far,
Don't you know at all.
Nothing is what we have now,
Nothing is what we're allowed,
Nothing but an echo now,
Nothing like before.

So now we are the lost,
And now we are the last,
Living in a nightmare,
Broken dreams and love turned mean,
Living in the past,
Living in the past.

I ainÂt gonna take the blame,
Don't twist the truth, don't be a whore,
Tell the truth &amp; shame the devil,
Don't you lie no more.
I will never understand,
How we came to this sad place,
Just to look at your sad face,
Castles made of sand.
 but Here we are, so we do,
What we had is now untrue,
What there was is lost and shamed,
Here we are again.

So now we are the lost,
And now we are the last,
Living in a nightmare,
Broken dreams and love turned mean,
Living in the past.

So now we are the lost,
And now we are the last,
Living in a nightmare,
Broken dreams and love turned mean,
Living in the past,
Living in the past.
