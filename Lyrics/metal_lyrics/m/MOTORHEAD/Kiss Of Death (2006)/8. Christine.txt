Hear her coming, 'bout 5 miles away,
That girl is something, know she gonna make my day,
Ah, She is so fine, real good friend of mine,
I just wanna jump her bones all the time,
See her walking, she knows all the moves,
Fortune cookie, stand your toes up in your shoes,
Oh you can't believe, what she got up her sleeve,
Likes me fine, and that's just fine with me,

Christine, I'm going out of my mind, Like to drive me wild,
Red hot mama ain't no lie, So glad I caught your eye
Christine, you put your hands on me, I got electric blood
Come on over &amp; do it again, Just like a bad girl should.

She moves like a rattlesnake made out of razorblades,
That girl can't help it, just the way she's made,
I would run all around the world, Just to see that girl,
She sure loves playing with the Ace of Spades.

Christine, drive me out of my head, Like to drive me wild,
Red hot mama ain't no lie, So glad I caught your eye
Christine, you put your hands on me, I got electric blood
Come on over &amp; do it again, Just like a bad girl should.
( come on!)

Christine, drive me out of my mind, Like to drive me wild,
Red hot mama ain't no lie, So glad I caught your eye
Christine, you put your hands on me, I got electric blood
Come on over &amp; do it again, Just like a bad girl should.
Christine, christine
Christine, I just wanna jump her bones,
She's my baby.
