Dr Rock is gonna shoot you full of rock &amp; Roll,
We do it real good,
Loud &amp; clear, we beat the drum,
We gonna make you run.
In the name of Rock &amp; Roll, fire in the sky,
Going down, going down,

You can't mess with Dr Rock,
So don't you even try,
We run through the city, got everything we need,
We got all the aces &amp; we got them up our sleeve,

Gonna see the Dr, take away your pain,
We do it real fine,
We say what we mean, we mean what we say,
We're gonna make your day,
In the name of Rock &amp; Roll, fire in the sky,
Going down, going down,

You can't mess with Dr Rock,
So don't you even try,
We run through the city, got everything we need,
We got all the aces &amp; we got them up our sleeve,

Crossing over rivers, over mountains, over seas,
Coming to rock your world,
Hear us scream, whatever can it mean,
We're gonna steal your girl,
In the name of Rock &amp; Roll, fire in the sky,
Going down, going down,

You can't mess with Dr Rock,
That's right, don't you even try,
We run through the city, got everything we need,
We got all the aces &amp; we got them up our sleeve,
Right now
