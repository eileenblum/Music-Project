Make out, make out, you must run,
Divide &amp; rule, more &amp; more,
Say the word, hardcore, hardcore,

You live your life, behind your eyes,
You got no life, no disguise,

Be my baby, I ain't gonna cry,
Shut your mouth, wanna do the dog,
Sex with needles, gonna get you of,
Outlaw, outlaw, no ma'am, no way,
Turn me down, damn shame, I'll say,
Going to freak show, to take my pain away.

Breakout, breakout, You must dance,
Divide &amp; fall, more &amp; more,
Save the world, high score, high score.

You live your life, behind the wall,
You got no life, not at all,

Be my baby, I ain't gonna die,
Shut you down, wanna do the dog,
Sex with monsters, gonna get you of,
Outlaw, outlaw, no ma'am, no way,
Turn me down, damn shame, I'll say,
Going to gun show to take my brain away,

Fake out, fake out, you can't leave,
Divide and stall, more &amp; more,
Say the word, webcore, webcore,

You crawl with life, behind your face,
You got no life, no disgrace,

Be my baby, I ain't gonna die,
Stay right there, wanna do the dog,
Sex with killers, ain't gonna get them off,
Outlaw, outlaw, no maÂ am, no way,
Turn me down, damn shame, I'll say,
Going to a mode show, to take my shame away.
