Where are we to go from here in time,
Do you see the future, do you know,
What can you expect from years to come,
And what can you do now to make it so,

All of history is there for you,
All the deeds done in the world are mad
If you don't know what has gone before,
You'll just make the same mistake again &amp; again &amp; again.

Soldier, soldier, see where we were,
You have to know the story,
Older, colder, life isn't fair,
Got to grab the sword of glory,

If you can't see what bloody fools we were,
Then you were also born a bloody fool,
Listen to the hundred million dead,
They didn't know it, but they died for you,

All you know is that you're young &amp; tough,
Don't you think those millions thought the same,
If you don't know where it all went wrong,
You'll just make the same mistake again &amp; again &amp; again.

Soldier, soldier, see where we were,
You have to know the story,
Older or colder, life ain't fair,
Got to grab the sword of glory,

Read the books, learn to save your life,
How can you find the knowledge if you don't,
All the brave men died before their time,
You'll either be a hero, or you won't,

Don't you realize the only way,
Is see why all those brave men died in vain,
If all that slaughter doesn't make you sad,
You'll just make the same mistake again &amp; again &amp; again.

Soldier, soldier, see where we were,
You have to know the story,
Older or colder, life ain't fair,
Got to grab the sword of glory.
