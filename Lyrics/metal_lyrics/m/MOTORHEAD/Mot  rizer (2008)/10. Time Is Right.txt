You better stand right there,
Get a clue and be aware,
You're just an inch or so from your immortality,
Don't you get the meaning,
You might still be bleeding,
You might be rich but that don't mean a thing to me,
Go ahead and laugh so many have before,
But now they're dead,
They're not laughing anymore.

[1st Chorus:]
This is our time, we have you now,
You are our great delight,
Scream to your God, who never hears a thing,
He's not with you now,
The time is right, the time is right.

You better keep quite still,
Get a drink and take your pill,
You're just a mile or so,
From the dreaded hanging tree,
Don't you understand,
Now you're in our hands,
You might be innocent,
But I tend to disagree,
Go one and smile, many smiled in here,
But not for long, the story always ends in tears.

[2nd Chorus:]
This is our time, we are in luck,
You're going to see the light,
Scream to your God, who doesn't even care,
He is not here now,
The time is right.

You'd better bite your lip,
Get a focus, get a grip,
You're just a step or so from the endless yawning pit,
Don't you recognize,
The lust for torture in our eyes,
You thing that I don't know you,
But I see through your disguise,
Go ahead and plead, begging is so nice,
But then I'm deaf, I just like to watch your eyes.

[3rd Chorus:]
Surrounded by foes, faces all grim,
You'll lose the will to fight,
Scream to your God,
Who laughs at your pain,
He is not here now,
Do you recall, how you felt then,
Back when your world was bright,
Scream to your God, who left you here with us,
Guilty as charged,
The time is right, the time is right.
