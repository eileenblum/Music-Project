We're out of time, we're out of line,
We're all out here waiting for a crime,
We don't mind, we ain't folled,
We're gonna read you the real bad news,
Fire in the hole, bullets in the sky,
We know something and we can't tell a lie,
Gonna run away, gonna run amok,
Gonna run my mouth 'til I run out of luck.

Alright,
Leave me out, give a dog a bone,
Been a long time since I've been home,
Running over land running over sea,
Get on the dog and talk dirty to me,
Running up a street, running up a hill,
Hotel telephone running up a bill,
Chase my tail, catch me if you can,
Don't wanna mess with the Runaround Man.

We're out of cokes, clean out of smokes,
It's not funny 'cos we run out of jokes,
Going to the movies, babes in the wood,
Gonna get a telescope, look real good,
Gonna run out, rolling like a rock,
Gonna get a girl and she gonna get me off,
Gonna be a man, gonna be a fool,
Gonna be a dog with a mouthful of booze.

Oh yeah,
Gonna be free, run away to the sea,
Gonna be a pirate you'll never find me,
Going over sea, going over land,
Get made up like the Elephant Man,
Stand in line, waiting for a break,
Live in California waiting for a quake,
Chase my tail, catch me if you can,
Don't you mess around with the Runaround Man.

We're in a hole, we're in a fix,
Give the dog a bone and throw me a stick,
Don't be a bitch, singing the blues,
Don't like the shirt and we don't like the shoes,
Gonna walk out, gonna walk away,
Gonna walk the dog honey every other day,
Gonna be strong, stand your ground,
Gonna be funny when they send in the clowns,

Hey hey,
Give me a clue, show me a trick,
Go to Brazil and see what you missed,
Getting too close getting too near,
Don't even know what I'm doing out here,
Going too fast never gonna stop,
Know how to roll and we know how to rock,
Chase my tail do the best you can,
You can't mess with the Runaround Man.
