Look over on your left,
Look over on the right,
There's nothing you can see out there,
But this ain't no fair fight,
A lot of people dying, men driven raving mad,
They scream out there for hours,
And it makes you feel really bad,

Heroes, heroes,
Nobody wants to be here,
Nobody wants to fall

Fools, fools,
But no-one walks away from here,
Backs to the wall.

[Chorus:]
Stand your ground and fight,
You know that our cause is right,
We are the ones, whose hope has gone,
Hold and stand fast,
Stand and do your best,
Stand and face your test,
Until you fall, you must obey the call,
For we are the last.

Do you understand how you became a fighting man,
You must be hard as nails,
And kill with sword and hand,
You march on our command,
You fight until the death,
You fight 'til life runs out of you,
And you draw your final breath,

Heroes, heroes,
We must hold them on the line,
They must not advance,

Fools, fools,
So if you would be legends, boys,
This is your chance.

[Chorus:]
Stand your ground and fight,
You know that our cause is right,
We are the ones, whose hope has gone,
Hold and stand fast,
Stand and do your best,
Stand and face your test,
Until you fall, you must obey the call,
For we are the last.

One day men will look back here,
To see the bloody day,
When we stood at the edge and fought,
And no-one ran away,
The story will get bigger,
As it's handed down the years,
And so pass into legend,
To tell what happened here.

Heroes, heroes,
We know we can't win here,
But we must not run,

Fools, fools,
Now get yourselves ready,
For the last attack comes.

[Chorus:]
Stand your ground and fight,
You know that our cause is right,
We are the ones, whose hope has gone,
Hold and stand fast,
Stand and do your best,
Stand and face your test,
Until you fall, you must obey the call,
For we are the last.
