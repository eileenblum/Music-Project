My mama told me lots of things,
About the live we lead,
Told me it was too easy,
To live a life of greed,
She said you be a good man,
And I'll be proud of you,
'Cos you can't do no better,
If that's all you learn to do.

[1st Chorus:]
All we got is one short life,
Far as we can find,
And if you don't know how to live,
The world will be unkind

No, no curse upon my name,
No way I look at a bad guy,
And think that I'm the same,
No I won't be blamed,
I live without dishonor,
I won't have to die ashamed.

Old lady told me plenty,
Told me what to do,
How to act in society,
How to make it through,
She said always mind your manners,
And don't you talk no trash,
And if you hear somebody dissing you,
Go over and kick his ass.

[2nd Chorus:]
One thing is for certain,
By all we know and love,
If you compromise your integrity,
You should drown in your own blood.

Now even though I'm old and weird,
I remember what she said,
I always knew she was right,
So I kept it in my head,
I never tried to hurt the world,
Never was drove by greed,
Believe I mostly did my best,
What more do you want from me?

[3rd Chorus:]
All there is is one short life,
Far as we can find,
And if you don't know how to live,
You're gonna lose your mind.

No no dirt upon my name,
No way I look at a bad guy,
And thing I share blame,
No I'm not the same,
As I love and die, I'm certain I,
Refuse to die ashamed.
