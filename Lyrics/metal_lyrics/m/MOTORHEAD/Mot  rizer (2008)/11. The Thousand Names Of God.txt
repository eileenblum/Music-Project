Walking forever is a long long time,
Destiny is just the same old line,
The war has come and we have let it come,
The war for the blood of the chosen one.

All you see is illusion,
And all you feel is mute confusion,

The war is never over,

No one ever sees the black machine,
You'll never fill my shoes,
Out on the killing floor where the eagle screams,
Bad man luck and bad man dreams.

[Chorus:]
No you cannot kill the time,
You will not have to choose,
And then you'll have to pay your dues,
You don't care about the pain,
You will survive the day,
To speak the thousand names of God.

Outside the law is such a lonely place,
Running and hiding trying to change your face,
The war is come and we don't understand,
The war for the world and the future man.

All of your days are dying,
All of the doomsday birds are flying,

The war is never over,

Nobody ever wants to hear the truth,
Too much like taking blame,
The way we are we are the living proof,
Bad news boogie and sunk in shame.

[Chorus:]
No you cannot kill the time,
You will not have to choose,
And then you'll have to pay your dues,
You don't care about the pain,
You will survive the day,
To speak the thousand names of God.

Under the world is only dead and cold,
And you still think that you can save your soul,
The war is come and we have washed our hands,
Bathed in the blood of the fighting man.

All of your hearts are broken,
And all the magic words are spoken,

The war is never over,

You'll never walk out of this poison ground,
You'll never be the one,
Your head will never get to wear the crown,
No luck left when hope is gone.

[Chorus:]
No you cannot kill the time,
You will not have to choose,
And then you'll have to pay your dues,
You don't care about the pain,
You will survive the day,
And speak the thousand names of God.
