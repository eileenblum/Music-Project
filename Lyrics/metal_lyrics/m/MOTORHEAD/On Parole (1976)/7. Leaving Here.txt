Hey, fellows have you heard the news,
The women in this town are being misused,
Seen it all in a dream last night,
You'll be leaving this town 'cause you don't feel right,
'Cos I'm Leaving, Leaving Here

Hey fellows, better change your ways,
Or they'll be leaving this town in a matter of days,
They all say, and everything's so true,
We fellows run around with someone new,
'Cos I'm Leaving, Leaving Here,

Yeah, one by one, yeah two by two,
Yeah three by three, yeah four by four

Hey fellows, better change your ways,
Or they'll be leaving this town in a matter of days,
One day, one day and it won't be long,
And all them fine chicks will be gone,
'Cos I'm Leaving, Leaving Here,

Yeah two by two, yeah four by four,
Oh yeah, I'm Leaving Here
