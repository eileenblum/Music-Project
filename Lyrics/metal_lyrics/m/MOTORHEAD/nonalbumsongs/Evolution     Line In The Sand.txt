["ThemeAddict: WWE The Music, Vol. 6" compilation track]Evolution is a mystery
Full of change that no one sees
Clock makes a fool of history
Yesterday's so long ago, don't agree with what I know.
Tomorrow got no place to be.

I see the line in the sand
Time to find out who I am
Looking back to see where I stand
Evolution
Evolution

See my reflection change
Nothing ever stays the same
But you know the name's The Game
We all know what it means
Nothing's ever what it seems
Unforgiven, unforseen

I see the line in the sand
Time to find out who I am
Looking back to see where I stand
Evolution
Evolution
