[from "Hellraiser III: Hell On Earth" soundtrack]Welcome to the days of bane
Welcome to the feast of blood
Now you are once more ensnared
All your wounds are in again

Speak into the face of glass
Ride upon the spikes of lust
See the wheels turn for you
Know the final truth at last!

For we are here, we are here
We are here and always were
Wait to know so patiently
Welcome now to hell on earth!

Hook and blade reach out to you
Come and find your destiny
We have waited oh so long
You shall make us born anew

Choke upon the guts of blood
Laugh into the wounds display
Now you understand the law
Enter now the endless maze!

For we are here, we are here
We are here and always were
Waiting oh so patiently
Welcome now to hell on earth!

Ride and dance, turn and bleed
Shout as torment turns to lust
Come with to hold our lovers
Where the knife injects the seed

Sweet red lips are in her now
Sleep be on your knee of bliss
Steel teeth reach for your mouth now
Receive your final kiss!

For we are here, we are here
We are here and always were
Waiting oh so patiently
Welcome now, welcome now, welcome now to Hell on Earth!!!

We are here...
