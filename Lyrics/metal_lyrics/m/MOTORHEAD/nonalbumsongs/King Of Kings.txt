[2006 "WWE Wreckless Intent" compilation track]Behold the King the King of Kings
On your knees dog all hail
Bow down to the King bow down to the King

The King grinned red as he walked from the blaze,
Where the traitor lost both his name and his face
Through the halls and the corridors stinging in blood
He tasted his grin and it tasted good
The King took his head and left him broken and dead
Bow down to the King bow down to the King

The King left none living none able to tell
The King took their heads and he sent them to hell
Their screams echoed loud in the place of their death
Ripped open they died with their final breath
They hailed to the King the King of Kings
Bow down to the King bow down to the King

Into the dirt his will be done
Now feel your fear there can be only one
Bow down to the King bow down to the King
The King is here now feel your fear the King of Kings
All hail the King on your knees for the King
The King of Kings there is only one.

Thanks to spyros88 for sending "Hell on Earth" lyrics.
