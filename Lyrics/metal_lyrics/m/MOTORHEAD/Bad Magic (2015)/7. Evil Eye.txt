Look at me what do you want
I'm a man as well as you know
Evil in the air tonight, we better make it right
Dollar for my mercy, tell you what I know

Look see, look see, see you down upon your knees
I see sorrow coming down, quick and sly
You must leave don't come back, there is something on your track
Bad Magic evil eye

You better watch your step
Time be getting hard if you don't go
Rattlesnake in your hand, don't you flinch be a man
One silver dollar, help you if I can

Look around, look around, look for sign there on the ground
I see sorrow in your way by and by
On your way lonesome road, poor boy heavy load
Bad magic evil eye

Swamp mud can't get free
Don't look back you don't want to see
Voodoo coming on your trail if you live to tell the tale
Give me a silver dollar, I'll try to make your bail

Listen up, listen up, listen good, keep it shut
I see you in the fire, flame &amp; die
Leave me now and change your shape, put a mask on your face
Bad Magic, evil eye
