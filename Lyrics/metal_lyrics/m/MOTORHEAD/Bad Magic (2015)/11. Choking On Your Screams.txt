We are the homeless, lost in space
Wandering searching out of place
Now we find you, our journeys end
You must vanish, your world must make amends

We are coming to kill you, declaration of war
You have seen us in the sky, now you must die

We bring you sorrow, no time to say goodbye
You have seen a thousand years of fire in the sky
We come to battle we will end your hopes and dreams
So die now choking on your screams

Oh

You will not see us, but we are here
Breathing deep, your atmosphere
Your world is ours, and now we call
We are the others, inside your walls

We all come to waste you, to watch you die
Some of us among you, our trusted spies

We are your masters, we feel no remorse
You have no chance against us, we live for war
You will be gone forever, no fever dreams
Die then choking on your screams

Your time has come now, accept the fact
We are the stronger race, you will die like rats
Bow to the eternal law, cruel and extreme
Die choking on your screams, on your screams, choking on your screams
