I didn't see the fire, I didn't see the smoke
The only thing that speaks to me is the way the spirit spoke
I wouldn't want to be here when the shooting starts
The only way, to tell the tale is shoot them through the heart

Stop and look and wonder
Breakfast in your cell
You better keep your head down
In the fire storm hotel

I want to understand it, I want to believe
The only way to make you play is roll up your sleeves
You'll never know the story, you'll never see at all
So wear a grin while the walls close in at the monsters ball

Slide in nice and quiet
Stop and listen well
Hope your luck don't give you up
At the fire storm hotel

Woo, burn

So wait and I will tell you what happened here
The hotel burned, no lessons learned, only ghosts got clear
They say the rooms are empty but I know they're not
The way things are in the hotel bar, the devil buys the shots

Look into the windows
The shadow rings the bell
Chaos rules in the empty pool
At the fire storm hotel

Take a look at all them people
They don't look too well
They burned and screamed, in a fever dream
At the fire storm hotel
