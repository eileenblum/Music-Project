[originally by The Rolling Stones]Please allow me to introduce myself, I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year, stole many a man's soul to waste
And I was 'round when Jesus Christ had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate washed his hands and sealed his fate

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game

I stuck around St. Petersburg when I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Tsar and his ministers, Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, Held a general's rank
When the blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
Ah, what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, come on, come on, come on

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
Ah yeah, what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game

I watched with glee while your kings and queens, fought for ten decades for the gods they made
I shouted out, who killed the Kennedys? When after all, it was you and me
Let me please introduce myself, I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours who get killed before they reached Bombay

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
But what's confusing you
Is just the nature of my game

Just as every cop is a criminal and all the sinners saints
As heads is tails just call me Lucifer 'cause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me, have some courtesy, have some sympathy, and some taste
Use all your well-learned politeness or I'll lay your soul to waste, mm yeah

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, ah yeah
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, ah yeah, get down
