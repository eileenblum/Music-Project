What is it you're looking for
I don't think you will ever find the gold
What got your curiosity
My name is on the list of places you should never go

The Devil, he looks at you
The Devil, steals your breath
You'll never know the law
Go, look into the face of death

Are we still talking now
I know you'll never tell another soul
Is it a catastrophe
Be my friend and tell me what nobody else should know

The Devil knows you now
The Devil will break your neck
Nobody will hear your call
Go, stare into the face of death

Come on

If you speak I'm out of here
I don't know you how can that be so
If you want I can be sincere
Speak my name and I will tell you everything I know

The Devil, seeks your soul
The Devil, see what you get
Abandon all hope now
Go, look into the face of death

Right now
