Nobody's mad like me, I don't know how to speak,
Sometimes my eyes are open, sometimes my knees are weak.
Nobody's mad like me, I like to see the sky,
But I would rather see it baby from the other side.

Riding on wings of fire, nothing could get me higher.
Nobody knows me, knows what I desire.

I know where the lightning strikes,
I know why the vampire bites,
I've spoken with the restless dead,
I know the minds of rats,
And the wrong side of the tracks,
I hear the devils in my head.

Nobody's on your side, forgotten how to scream,
Sometimes your eyes are blind, sometimes you're in my dreams.
Nobody's on your side, you think you're oh so smart,
But you got a stone cold stone, not a beating heart.

Riding on wings of flame, never be this high again.
Nobody sees you, nobody sees your pain.

I know where the black flags fly,
I know where immortals die,
I have heard the mountain giants tread,
I have seen the death of worlds,
I know the wizards words,
I hear the devils in my head.

Nobody crazy like me, I'll make you believe,
Sometimes I wear other faces, sometimes I sit and grieve.
Nobody's crazy like me, I know the nights alive,
But you can't be too sure just who's on your side.
Ride the electric storm, to the infected dawn.
Nobody would believe what we have spawned.

I know the way to hell,
I know the padded cell,
I have seen many heroes die.
I know your nightmares too,
And who sends them to you,
The one who makes the children cry.
I see the cruel insane,
I feel their unknown pain,
I feel the knives inside their heads.
I see we are all doomed,
I see blood on the moon,
I hear the devils in my head.
