You don't know me baby but I know you so well,
Tried to make a fool of me, tried to ring my bell.
Sneaking round behind my back didn't make me cry,
But I'm gonna have my sweet revenge; pay back all your lies.

Gonna make a fool of you, watch out.
Make your life a misery; make you shut your mouth.
Gonna tell a tale on you, make your blue eyes cry,
And then you know we're truly through, bye bye bitch, bye bye.

You know all the reasons and I know all their names,
Trying to keep secrets babe ain't your strongest game.
Running round this city, running outta tales,
I'm gonna make you sorry honey, I'm gonna make you wail.

Gonna be a sad day for you soon.
Make your life a mockery, twist you out of tune.
Gonna do some work on you and only you know why,
And then it's time to say âso long', bye bye bitch, bye bye.

You don't know a goddamn thing about the real world,
Here's a short sharp lesson, and I mean every word.
You tell me that you love me but I'm just some other fool,
So bite the bullet, eat your words, I'll teach you the rules.

Gonna make a fool of you, watch out.
Make your life a misery; make you shut your mouth.
Gonna tell a tale on you, make your blue eyes cry,
Then you know it's adios, bye bye bitch, bye bye.
