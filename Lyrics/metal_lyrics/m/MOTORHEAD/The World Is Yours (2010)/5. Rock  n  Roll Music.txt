Time goes by real slow, and you know how it feels.
Time goes by in its own bad way, your life stuck under the wheels.
Time is tight but that's alright, we give it room to breathe.
Time crawls by and time's real sly, but you can keep time with me.

Rock n Roll music is the true religion.
Never let you down you can dance to the rhythm.
Stay home and watch it on your television, walk out across the sky.
Rock N Roll even gonna set you free.
Make the lame walk and the blind to see.
Gonna take you back to where you wanna be,
Do it till the day I die.

We can shake it all night long, everybody got to dance.
Romantic fool trying to be cool, hoping he's in with a chance.
Get out tonight, high as a kite, under the yellow moon.
Make you feel good, get some real wood,
Put that together real soon.

Rock n Roll music is the true religion.
Never let you down you can dance to the rhythm.
Stay home and watch it on your television, walk out across the sky.
Rock ân' Roll even gonna set you free.
Make the lame walk and the blind to see.
Gonna take you back to where you wanna be,
Do it till the day I die.

Rock music can wake the dead.
You know it's true when it fills your head.
Better remember what I said, you never get enough.
When the band hits the road, that's the time to save your soul.
That's the time to reach for the gold, you know it ain't so tough.

Rock n roll music is my religion; I don't need no miracle vision.
I don't need no indecision, look me right in the eye.
Rock n roll music gonna set you free?
Know its gonna knock you outta your tree,
Gonna get you right to where you wanna be, do it till the day I die.

Rock ân' Roll, Rock ân' Roll, Rock ân' Roll,
Rock ân' Roll, dance to the music.
Rock ân' Roll, you know you can't refuse it.
Rock ân' Roll, don't you abuse it.
Rock ân' Roll, Rock ân' Roll, Rock ân' Roll, save your soul.
