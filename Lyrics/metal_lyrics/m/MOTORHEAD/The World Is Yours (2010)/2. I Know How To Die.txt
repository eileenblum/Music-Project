Say the word and I'll be yours, save me from the killing floor.
Outta time outta sight, creeping up on you tonight.
Can't see your face no more, hanging in the sky.
Might be gone forever and that's a long long time.

If I could find the cure I wouldn't have to cry,
I know the law I know how to die.

Thousand years lost in time, outta shape and outta line.
Flying high you know it's true, searching all the world for you.
Take the wild ride, teach you how to fly,
Be on my side I hate them long goodbyes.

Don't believe in miracles and I won't even try,
I know the law I know how to die.

No more lies no excuse, walk a mile in my shoes.
Outta luck out on bail, run like hell stay out of jail.
Can't see the way no more needles in my eyes,
Rotten to the core hang me out to dry.
Give me satisfaction or a damn good reason why,
Cross your heart and hope to die.

Stay on the right track; you can't live a lie,
Make sure you don't go back, look me in the eye,
Know I ain't no angel, broken wings don't fly,
I know the law I know how to die.
