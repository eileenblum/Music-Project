Live or die, stand or run, shoot âem down, smoking gun.
In the time it takes to tell, another dreamer sent to hell.

Just like movies, time to move, bad gunslinger, evil dude.
Know you're fast, hope you're quick, quick draw gun law make your hit.
Born to shoot, hope it's true, today you know the slow one's you.

Outlaw, cut down in your prime,
Outlaw, see the blue sky one last time,
Outlaw, that's all.

Live or die, win or lose, can't be sure, no excuse.
In the street a man lies dead, another dreamer bloody red.

Just in time, lightning speed, frozen moment, time to bleed.
Know it's all about to change, try, die, or live again.
Born to die, we all know that, today you know the first is last.

Outlaw, cut down in your tracks,
Outlaw, so much for the man in black,
Outlaw, that's all.

Die or live, shoot to kill, the old routine you know so well.
Gun law rules that's what I said, another dreamer woke up dead.

Justice means the fastest gun, no appeal, done is done.
Know it's quick, hanging tree, courthouse, whorehouse set you free.
Born to live, don't know how long, never know right from wrong.

Outlaw, face down in the dirt,
Outlaw, the one that kills you never hurts,
Outlaw, lying in the street,
Outlaw, the last gunslinger you will meet,
Outlaw that's all.
