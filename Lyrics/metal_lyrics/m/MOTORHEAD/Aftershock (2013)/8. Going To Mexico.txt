We saw the others crying in fear
We saw your mothers be of good cheer
Going to run
Away from the gun
Better be safe than be sorry my son

Fly - I don't count the miles going by
Know it's no lie

Give us the time
And we'll do the crime
Only one place to go

South of the border
Crossing the line
Going to Mexico

Running the miles
Pretty damn quick
Run through the wilds
Run until you're sick

Going to win
Sin after sin
Better be here
Than where we've all been

Go, like Lucifer's right at your heels
Roll like a wheel

Give us the time
And we'll do the crime
That much we all know

South of the border
Crossing the line
Going to Mexico

Looks like we made it
Made the frontier
Rio Grande wash away all of your fears

Ain't gonna fall
No sleep at all
Run for the river
Follow the call

Go, run like a wolf in the night
In the pale moonlight

Give us the time
And we'll do the crime
Only one place to go

South of the border
Like it just fine
Going to Mexico
