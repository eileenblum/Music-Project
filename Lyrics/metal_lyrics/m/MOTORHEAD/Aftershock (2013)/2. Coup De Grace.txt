Make it quick
The Coup de Grace
Makes you dead
Kills your ass
Gives you nightmares
Bad dreams
Panic in the dark
Don't you go there stay right here
Dinner with the sharks

Open up your mind
Life is so unkind
Shine a light on me
Tell me what the hell
I was sleeping like a baby
Trying to make me well
If you will not play the game
You will be cast out
No disgrace
Smiley face
Work it out

Make it quick
Run like hell
They will catch
You as well
Give you time
Years and year
Bars on all the doors
Don't you do it
Stick around
Random to the core

Don't believe a word
Don't run with the herd

I don't like the news
Watch it every week
Just because
I don't believe it
Don't make me a freak
If you knew the real stories
Can't be fooled no more
You can kiss
Or you can tell
Parasite or whore

Make your way
Seize the time
Your life is as fucked as mine
No one's going anywhere
Without a buck or two
Wait a second
Stay right there
I'll be back for you

Don't believe the lies
Truth will make you wise

Stay here in the room
Show me all your tricks
I know all the things you need
I will get you fixed
If you tell me dirty stories
I'll be on your side
Then we know just where to stand
Nationwide
