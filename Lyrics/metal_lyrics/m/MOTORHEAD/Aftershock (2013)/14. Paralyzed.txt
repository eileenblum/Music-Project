Running through the jungle
Looking for a light
Running like a bastard baby
In the jungle night
Looking for a temple
Looking for the gold
Looking like a hero
When the story's told
Now we're lost
All hope gone
All my life
The same old song
Out of breath
Out of true
You'd be the same
If it was you

Win the prize, paralyzed

Flying over mountains
Flying over seas
Flying through a hurricane
Praying on your knees
Searching for a fortune
Searching for a clue
Flying in the face of death
Flying into view
Now we're lost
All hope fades
All my life
Under the blade
Out of booze
We sank a few
You'd o the same if it was you

Win the prize, paralyzed

Running through the jungle
Shadows at my side
Running like a maniac
I don't want to die
Looking for the answers
Looking for the place
Looking through the jungle
Gonna win the race
Out of time
We can't win
Tropic night is closing in
Mosquitoes dance
Sting you too
You'd be the same if it we're you

Win the prize, paralyzed
