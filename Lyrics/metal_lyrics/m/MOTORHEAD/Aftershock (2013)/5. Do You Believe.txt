Don't know what I did last night
But I sure did it good
Running wild
Out of sight
Lost in Hollywood
I believe in Rock'n'Roll
I believe in songs
Put your faith behind it
And you wont go far wrong
Good or bad I love the work
Don't make me wait
Dance with me, romance with me
Hell on roller skates
Rockin' like monsoon
Twisting like a typhoon
You know
Just what I need
Rock will turn you loose babe
Tell you the truth babe
Rock'n'Roll
Do you believe?

Good or bad I love my life
Don't make me wait
Dance with me, a chance with me
Hell on roller skates
Rockin' in the whole world
Rockin' every boy and girl
You know you're built for speed

Rockin' like you're insane
Rockin' like a hurricane
Rock'n'Roll
Do you believe?
