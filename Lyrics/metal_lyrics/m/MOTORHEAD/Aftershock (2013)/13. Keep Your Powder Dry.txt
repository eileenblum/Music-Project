You must do what you desire
You must save your soul entire
You must figure out what works
And don't you be a liar
Can't be a liar

Do what your soul demands
Your future in your hands
Don't forget the left behind
The faces of the damned
The faces of the damned

Don't wait keep right on
But be aware
Don't take too long
The time just seems to fly
Just keep your powder dry
Keep your powder dry
Keep your powder dry

You must be brave and bold
You must be hard and cold
You must forget the rules
Before you're bought and sold
Before you're bought and sold

Do what you know is right?
No need to start a fight
No need to raise the ghosts
In the haunted night
In the haunted night

Don't move, hold your tongue
Don't take too long, don't get it wrong
Time has other first to fry
Just keep your powder dry
Keep your powder dry
Keep your powder dry

Right there

You know what's right and wrong
You should know what's going on
Just hold the line my friend
Keep holding on
Keep holding on

You really have no choice
You have to make a noise
Silence ain't an option now
We have to hear your voice
We got to hear your voice

Don't move brace yourself
There's no one else
There's no one else

No need to be so shy
Just keep your powder dry
Keep your powder dry
Keep your powder dry
Keep your powder dry
