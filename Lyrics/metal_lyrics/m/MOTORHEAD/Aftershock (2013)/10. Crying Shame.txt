Long time coming
Long time gone
Seen you coming
You've been gone too long

The only human in a one horse race
Try to get away without a trace
Stick it to them, stick it through them
Stick it out and you might still do 'em
Nice one mama come on down and see

Know your face, never knew your name
Never quite the same
It's a crying shame

Long way out, long way home
Walking past faces made of stone

Way I see it, get it while you can
Gotta be tough, a self made man

Stick it in 'em, stick it on 'em
Stick it fast you might have got 'em
Come on mama get down on your knees

Know your face, never knew your name
Never been the same
It's a crying shame
Never mind

On the line, on the line
Don't know about you but I feel fine

Looky here honey, I'm the one for you
Just a bit further, we'll make it through
Stick at nothing, keep on pushing
Stick to me your might get nothing
That's right mama, tell me what you see

Know your face, never knew your name
Never beat the game
It's a world of pain

Know your face, never knew your name
I never could explain
It's a crying shame
A crying shame
