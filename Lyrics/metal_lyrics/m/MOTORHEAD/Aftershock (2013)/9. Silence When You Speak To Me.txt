There ain't no answers
For me in here
Tell me all of your childhood fears
I live on emotions
I eat your dreams
Nothing's ever what it seems

Remember, remember me
Remember, and disagree
Silence, silence

Truth all a children's game
Reality a bitter pill
We do not come to set you free
Silence, silence
Silence when you speak to me

You better believe me
Every word
Tell me secrets you might have heard
Ugly rumors are all we need
Tales of murder, guilt and greed

Remember, remember this
Remember treachery sealed with a loving kiss
Silence, silence

Truth is lies stand on me
Reality a fairy tale
We do not come to bend the knee
Silence, silence
Silence when you speak to me

We all are liar's every one
Sure as the moon, the stars and sun
We all are truthful on and the same
No one to answer, no one to blame

Remember, when you were mine
Remember, and walk the line
Silence, silence

Bite your tongue dance and burn
Reality a world of hurt
You may say no but not to me
Silence, silence

Dreams of lust hang your head
Reality a cruel joke
We will not buy what we can't see
Silence, silence
Silence when you speak to me
