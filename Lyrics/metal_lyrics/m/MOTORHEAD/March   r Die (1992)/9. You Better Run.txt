I got no reason, to lie to you
What's in the cards, that's what I do
I was born a-running &amp; laughing out loud
With my feet on the ground &amp; my head in the clouds

You better run, oh baby you better run
I got a blade like lightning, silver bullets in my gun

I'm short &amp; I'm tall, I'm black &amp; I'm white
Sometimes I be wrong, sometimes I be right
I'm iron &amp; steel, I'm bad to the bone
You come looking for trouble, honey don't you come alone

I seen 'em come, &amp; I seen 'em go,
I seen things &amp; been people, that nobody knows
I'm talking in pictures and I'm painting them black,
I seen Satan coming honey in a big black Cadillac
