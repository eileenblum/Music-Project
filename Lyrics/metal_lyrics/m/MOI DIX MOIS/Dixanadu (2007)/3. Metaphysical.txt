Behind the shape of things, deep in that phenomena, there appears form in illusion.
Represents the day dream.

Expel the latent, what exists in truth, in essence.

Throw away rigid style. Break the swing.

Sou anata ga te ni shita euphony
Shirushita hisoyaka na sign wa kakusareta tobira wo
Me ni wa utsuranai yumeutsutsu ishikika de
Me wo tojite konpeki ni kagayaku Philosophia

Affected material culture. Reclaim humanity.

Free of shape, natural moment, describe as dot image

Seek, feel, throw away rigid style.
Rest, awake, break the balance and swing.

Ah kowarekake no euphoria, idea ni dakarete
Hane wa kagayaki wo ushinai
Kago naka ni ireba yumegokochi ni yurarete
Kagirareta sekai to kiete yuku Realist

Kagami ni nemuru Philosophia

Fated, "raison d'Ãªtre"
