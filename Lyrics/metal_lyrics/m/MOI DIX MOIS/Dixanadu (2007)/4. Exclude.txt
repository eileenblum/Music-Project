The moth spreads its poisonMultiplying parasiteTaken by visciousnessToo many ghosts Anata ni wa kao ga nai Chisei wa okizari ni shiteShinin no gigen nado Kono yo ni wa sonzai shinai e-x-c-l-u-de, fade away, vanishe-x-c-l-u-de, fade away, vanish You have no face Your intellect is left behindEgoist Stained with jealousyWhere is it, your being?You are fixed by a spell Akui wo daku mitometemoSono utsuro na yume kuuhaku no mamaSonzai sura kizukarenaiAgasthiya ga egaku hametsu no scenario If you don't belive to your self in the endless void,The problems of this world are made by your desires. The moth spreads its poisonMultiplying parasiteTaken by visciousnessToo many ghosts Anata ni wa nani ga aru dokuga wo migaku kotoshikaShinin wa kan no naka de yasuraka ni nemurebaii e-x-c-l-u-de, fade away, vanishe-x-c-l-u-de Akumu no naka nigenobitemoAgasthiya wa sou azakeriShinu made daite nemuru ga ii If you don't belive to your self in the endless void,It's a sad world to hold grace, nihilism Agasthiya to tomoni hametsu no scenario
