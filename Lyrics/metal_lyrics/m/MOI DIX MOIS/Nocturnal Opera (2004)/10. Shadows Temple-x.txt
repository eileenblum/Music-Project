You were selected to be on this stage by a stroke of fate.

naze eranda watashi o kono sekai ni
This stage is just like illusions you made.
naze koroshita tozasareta kono sekai de

Lonely night, I hold a ceremony of darkness.
Changing mind is an omen of tragedy.
You are all mine.

kagee no tawamure mayonaka no tousaku
shinku ni somatta anata o dakishime kono te de...

Cut off the whole things.
nagareru chi ni
Set your reason free.

kuchizuke shite
Follow instincts.

Shadowâs dream of truth and false.
butai no tsuzuki o misete
aozameta shitai o aishi-tsuzuke...
Such a thought inspires me.

You were selected to be on this stage by a stroke of fate.
naze matta watashi no sekai o
This stage is just like illusions you made.
naze kie-yuku sourei na kono sekai de

kyouki no tawamure mayonaka no kousaku
tsukiyo ni terasare anata to kono mama tokeai...

yoru no hate made

Shadowâs dream of truth and false.
butai no tsuzuki o misete
aozameta karada o aishi-tsuzukete towa ni

Shadowâs dream of truth and false.
kikaijikake no kokoro
aozameta karada ni tsumi no akashi o kizami

Shadowâs dream of truth and false.
