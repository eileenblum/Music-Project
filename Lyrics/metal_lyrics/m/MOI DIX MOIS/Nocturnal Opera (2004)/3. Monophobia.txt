I canât see I canât hear

I think you are close to me

I feel something I feel you in the chaos

I think you are close to me

Hikari ni tsutsumarete-iru watashi o anata wa miteiru

shinkirou no youna sono kage wa dare mo kizuku koto wa nai

Share this world with you again
in the whirlpool of delight and sense

tomo ni butai o

kono uta wa anata no tame ni sasageru...

Break a spell, now return to the sky
As time goes by, meet again by destiny

mou ichido onaji sekai de

Break a spell, now return to the sky
As time goes by, meet again by destiny

kanki no uzu ni tsutsumarete

anata wa kodoku no naka watashi ni te o sashinobete-iru

watashi wa mieru anata ga kono kyoku to tomo ni

Now return to the sky
As time goes by, meet again by destiny
mou ichido onaji sekai de

Break a spell, now return to the sky
As time goes by, meet again by destiny

hikari no uzu ni tsutsumarete

Now return to the sky No phobia
kanki no koe ga yonde-iru

The only way to get away from loneliness is to love it

I remember with beloved tune
The unfinished stage is still shining
