Meltdown in the furnace
Crumble down

You don't need eyeballs that see everything distorted
Beautifully transparent glass spheres could suit you well

Dig them out
Tear it out
Rumble down

You should split your lying tongue
And show it like a snake

You're a lie
All lies

Your inside
Kusarihate houkai shite yuku
Your surface
Hyoumen dake wa kagayaite iru

It's a pity that you don't notice

Shinshoku sarete iru no ni anata wa kizukanai
Asamashii gaki domo ga anata no naka de

Your inside
Uji ga ubawaku kurutta atama wa
Your surface
Nata furiotoshi kusatta atama wo

Kick around
