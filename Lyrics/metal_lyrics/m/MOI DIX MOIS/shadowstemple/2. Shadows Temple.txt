[Lyrics and composition by Mana]

Shadow's dream of truth and false.

You were selected to be on this stage by a stroke of fate.
Naze eranda watashi wo kono sekai ni

This stage is just like illusions you made.
Naze koroshita tozasareta kono sekai de

Lonely night, I hold a ceremony of darkness.
Changing mind is an omen of tragedy.
You are all mine.

Kage no tawamure mayonaka no tousaku
Shinku ni somatta anata wo dakishime kono te de...

Cut off the whole things.
Nagareru chi ni
Set your reason free.
Kuchizukeshite
Follow instincts.

Shadow's dream of truth and false.
Butai no tsuzuki wo misete
Aozameta karada wo aishi tsuzuke...

Such a thought inspires me.

You were selected to be on this stage by a stroke of fate.
Naze enatta watashi no kono sekai wo
This stage is just like illusions you made.
Naze kieyuku sourei na kono sekai de

Kyouki no tawamure mayonaka no kousaku
Tsukiyoru ni yurasare anata to kono mama toke ai...

Yoru no hate made

Shadow's dream of truth and false.
Butai no tsuzuki wo misete
Aozameta karada wo aishi tsuzukete touwa ni

Shadow's dream of truth and false.
Kikai jikake no kokoro
Aozameta karada ni tsumi no hakashi wo hizami

Shadow's dream of truth and false.
