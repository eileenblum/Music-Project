I saw the world end last night in my agony
The end
I know the world ended last night in my sadness.
The end

My sight

I am killing, I am killing, you're killing satisfied

The death scape, beautiful ones encountered at the edge of my death
In side
my brain
In a hole

aa　utsukushiki hana　sakimidareteiru　kono yo no hate ni
ima　ushinatta hibi　torimodosu tame ni　kono yo no hate de　anata to
