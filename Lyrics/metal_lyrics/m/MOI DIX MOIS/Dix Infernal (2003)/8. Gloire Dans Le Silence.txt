[Lyrics and composition by Mana]

I cut myself in the silence, and it still hurts
I have sorrowed the wrong god in the silence

In the world of hurt, nothing ever changes
Bleeding with scares, pride world is dying

The sad black knight crosses his heart

Gloria in the silence [kyrie - requiem]
Black frosty night
Brilliance in the silence [kyrie - requiem]
Black frosty night
