I know the life could be really hard to live
In the way you've always wanted it to be
There is no glamor, fame only ice and flame
Rude awakening at the dusk
I told you not to let it get you
You told me: I won't forget you
I didn't know what was going on
Even now it's still unknown

I know the love could be based on lie and sin
Breaking all rules that's what it is
Sometimes it also fades leaving empty space
Don't trick yourself: it's what it is

I can't believe, I can't accept
I can' t believe that you are dead

I got a call from friend I remember shaking hands
A drop of cold sweat on my back
He told me you were gone they found you laying dead
I was in shock and still I am

My dearest friend of all I will regret your fall
Why didn't you let us know?
You were not alone in this conflicted world
But you chose to let it go...
