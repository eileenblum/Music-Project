You were born, You will die
Always with me by your side
You pretend you're someone else
Blaming others for your mess
You got mastered in conceal
Being assassin, that's your deal
But I'm with you, I'm the reason
So hear me out!

Don't ignore me, deny me
or try to betray our name
You won't kill me or hide me
I'm always there, I'm just for you

Frankly speaking - we are one,
One for all and all for one
So don't doubt me, 'cause you know me
I'm the only closest crony
Only I know what you are
Only I know what you've done
There is no treason, I'm the reason
So remember!

Don't ignore me or deny me
or try to betray our name
You won't kill me or hide me
I'm always there, I'm just for you

There was a time when you were lost
I was the one who gave you hope
Your desire is my lust
and your burden is our life
