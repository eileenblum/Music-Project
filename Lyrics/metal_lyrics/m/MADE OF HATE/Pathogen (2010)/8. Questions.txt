Why did you wear the mask?
Why did you tell me lies?
Why did you step in my life?
Why didn't I see you through?
Why did I get fooled by you?
Why did I trust the snake?

Where did you go?
Why did you go?
Why did you left me all alone?
What did I do?
What did I say?
Should I be the one to blame?

Why did you disappear?
Why did you fall in fear?
Didn't you know what was inside of me?
Didn't I warn you?
Didn't I try my best?
Didn't I know that it would end up this way?

Those questions...they come around...
