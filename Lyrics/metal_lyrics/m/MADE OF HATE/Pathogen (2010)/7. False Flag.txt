A made up army a made up act
That's how they roll and others fall
It's like a masquerade - they all wear masks
The play's just started it's almost done

Some say it's real others: it's fake
A clever setup without a trace
That's what we hear That's what we see
That's what they think people need

This is false flag
An act of anger, fully disguised
This is false flag
We've been deceived, some have been killed

No one cares to find out the truth
Since television brings it to you
So don't stop thinking don't let it go
You know they're hungry, they'll ask for more

The flag is waving up on the wind
It's up to you whom to salute
that's what they think
People always need
