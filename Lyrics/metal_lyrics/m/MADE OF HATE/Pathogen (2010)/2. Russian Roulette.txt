We finally meet again
Let's play the game
I have a lot to waste
So we better raise the stake

You know all the rules
You know the drill
You just can't walk away
Unless I drop dead

This is the game of our lives
So let's find out who lives, who dies

Russian roulette is the name
Of this exciting game
There is a chance to survive
But as well you may die

Spin cylinder, spin it well
Adrenaline fills the veins
Place the barrel to your head
I can see your shaking hand

This is the game
Where someone dies
Other gets lucky
And wins his life

Pull the trigger and wait a sec
This may be your very last breath
This is a moment of truth
Is it the end for you?
This is where the story ends
Brain on the wall, what a disgrace
I'm still alive, what a luck?
But my friend lost his life
