The time has come for us
To say our last goodbye's
And now it's finally the time
To leave it all behind

New era has begun
We've double checked our guns
And now it's right time for you
To make our dreams come true

We Own the night
As daylight dies
We Own the night!
Flash, strobe and smoke
That's our scenery's theme
Our intro is getting through
Let's get it started

We play our tune
People go crazy in pits
We've just started our show
Let there be rock and roll
