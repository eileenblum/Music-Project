A scar for a scar,
Your nails wound your enemy to bleed
Like biting beast,
His reaction is the same : attack!

An eye for an eye makes that world blind!
An eye for an eye!

Oh Can't you see
Desire for vendetta's covered your eyes
You've ruined your life
Family as wall, It is an obsession

Release your weapon,
Put down your shield, rebuild your life instead
Time's running out,
So better stop before you'll be
Destroyed by your own hate!
