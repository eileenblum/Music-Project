I've finally found the key
To the passage locked till now
Behind that gate
I guess I'll find my space
But maybe I am wrong

Thousand questions I want to ask
But there are no answers
I'm getting furious, weak and lost
Because I'm on the edge

I'm on the edge
I am mistaken-
I'm looking for some clue
Which way should I turn?

So I got stuck here
in this crossroads
Considering new step
Just like to be or not to be
Which is to go or not!

I have enough of present life
I want to try something else
I'm about to cross the line
And i will face new life-
I'll face new world
