I'm waiting in your shadow
And I hope my turn will come soon
I know your thoughts, what you feel
I know you...

Your heartbeat is my clock
And it's counting down your life, time
You can run, disappear
But know I'll be near

Don't you think You where wrong
You did your greatest fault
Now forgiveness has been gone
There is no hope

Yelling voices in your head
They are driving you insane
Rude shadows of your past
Have awaken from the chasm

Slowly I'm taking command
While the Needle is heading to the end
There is no time, even while
In the Darkest time I will end tour life
