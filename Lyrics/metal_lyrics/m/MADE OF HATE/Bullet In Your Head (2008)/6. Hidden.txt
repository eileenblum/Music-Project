I am escaping
from the source of my desire
Trying to fool my heart and mind
It's my nature,
it will chase me my whole life
Until I accept it or die

I am one, made by two
Different worlds and different muses
Hidden nature comes out when
Dreams come true!

The darkest side of me,
which you can't see but only feel
Won't let my mind set me free!

It's like my shadow,
always with me,
hidden in the dark
My nature and myself is one
