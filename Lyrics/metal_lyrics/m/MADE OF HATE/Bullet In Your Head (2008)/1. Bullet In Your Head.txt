9 millimeters, the heart of lead,
That's my answer for your hate
Only quick flash, a sec. of pain
One for all dreams you've ever slain

Haven't forgotten your all crook deeds
Your fate has sent you little gift
Only one bullet, only one shot,
This one has written down your name!

You bitch!
Bullet in your head, I'm sending you, Bullet in your head
I'm pulling my gun's trigger and all you can hear is shoot
Bullet in your head, you motherfucker, Bullet in your head
Barrel's hole, flash, you are dead!

Don't even dare to tell your lies
This is the end of your disguise
Sand is falling down, day turns onto nights,
You had your time but you failed

I am the chosen one that you wish not to meet
I'm here to end your useless life!
So say your prayers, fall on your knees,
I'm aiming at the middle of your eyes
