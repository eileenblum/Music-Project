How does it feel
To take the blame
How does it feel
To be behind the drain
Because you take what you can get and ask for more
You never get what you deserve
And thatâs the score
Remember that the life you save may be your own
But when youâre bankrupt you wont get another loan
I hope that youâll accept my sympathy
But understand I gotta think its better him than me
Itâs better him than me
A chain is just as strong as itâs weakest link
When you endure the strain itâs always later than you think
Itâs later than you think
Resign to a life of chronic cellibacy
With fond memories and cheap pornography
God forbid I ever wanted intimacy
No more, that out out of the door
God forbid I should feel
I know that ainât real
But now I feel like I could rape a nun
And itâs always the first kiss that gets you drunk
That gets you drunk
So I keep a habit on her face
While I listen to that Yes song
Yours is no disgrace
Mine is no disgrace
No, no disgrace
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
How does it feel
To fade away
How does it feel
To be beneath the train
The life diguised behind the backward mask
A little dignity is all I ask
Many people cross the beach and leave no trace
Well Iâm hoping for my footprints to remain
I know that ainât real
But now I feel like I could rape a nun
And itâs always the first kiss that gets you drunk
That gets you drunk
So I keep a habit on her face
While I listen to that Yes song
Yours is no disgrace
Mine is no disgrace
No, no disgrace
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Mine is no
Mine is no disgrace
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Mine is no
Mine is no disgrace...
