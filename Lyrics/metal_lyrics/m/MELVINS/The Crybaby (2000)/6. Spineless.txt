I'm made of clay
Anything you say
Will determine the shape I take
And look my way
A vast delay
Between love and hate
And I'll sit on the fence 'til I sense
What's appropriate

Because I'm spineless
Yes I'm spineless
And the only suit I'll get into
Is this

I'll betray
My friends and mates
And I'll laugh at the jokes of folks
Prepared to pay

Because I'm spineless
Yes I'm spineless
And the only suit I'll get into
Is this

The crowd comes in
So full of sin
And I'm a hit
So full of shit
My bones go soft
My mouth goes off
My hand goes out
Just watch me mould
Just watch me mould
Just watch me mould

I'm behind
Your your party line
But I'll step on a dime anytime

Because I'm spineless
Yes I'm spineless
And the only suit I'll get into
Is this
Yes I'm spineless
Yes I'm spineless
Cause I'm spineless Completely spineless
