At easy, men
Your brain's in your palm again
Yay, yay
You'll do no harm, my friend
Yay, yay
Will you be my G.I. Joe?
In the boot camp of my soul
In my boots I've dugged a hole
And see I'm a P.O.W. whore
Bow my head and salute the crowd
Together we'll beat this redneck town
Pull the pin and blow me cold
Will you be my G.I. Joe?
Will you be my G.I. Joe?

You've blown mine
Stuck in his heart, yeah
Yay, yay
Don't think too long, my friend
Yay, yay
Yay
Ahaaahaa
Ahaaahaa
Shoot my eyes all full of lead
Cause my liver is thin like bread
And I faint when I see red
Without this camouflage I'm dead
Pull the pin and blow me cold
Will you be my G.I. Joe?
Will you be my G.I. Joe?
Will you be my G.I. Joe?
Will you be my G.I. Joe?
Will you be my G.I. Joe?
Will you be my G.I. Joe?
Will you be my G.I. Joe?
G.I. Joe
G.I. Joe
