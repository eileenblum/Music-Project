[Merle Haggard cover]

We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee
We don't take our trips on LSD
We don't our burn draft cards down on Main Street
We like living right and being free

We don't make a party out of loving
But we like holding hands and pitching wood
We don't let our hair grow long and shaggy
Like the hippies out in San Francisco do

[Chorus:]
I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee
A place here even squares can have a ball
We still wave Old Glory down at the court house
And White Lightning's still the biggest thrill of all

Leather boots are still in style for manly footwear
Beads and roman sandals wont be seen
Football's still the roughest thing on campus
And the kids here still respect the college dean

[Chorus]

We still wave Old Glory down at the court house
In Muskogee, Oklahoma USA.
