[The Jesus Lizard cover]

Your first mistake was to think you could fuck with the ranch
Here I come, here I come, with my dick in my hand
Do you think you'd like to have a blockbuster up your ass
Do you think you'd like that, well do ya motherfucker
Do ya, motherfucker
Do ya

We'll smash your eggs and then your head and we'll nab your kids
Take 'em outback on the deck and barbecue their ribs
Throw their heads into your ivy, water them with piss
Do you think you'd like that, well do ya motherfucker
Do ya, motherfucker
Do ya

Your first mistake was to think you could fuck with the ranch
Here I come, here I come, with my dick in my hand
Do you think you'd like to have a blockbuster up your ass
Do you think you'd like that, well do ya motherfucker
Do ya, motherfucker
Do ya, motherfucker
Do ya, motherfucker
Do ya
