When his hand began laughing, it was Johnny open wide
The riddle still unsolved, smoke rings subside
Untied, unravelled, unthought, unsaid
The man with the laughing hand is dead

Shaking under Pedro's head, train-crushed legs and arms
Wicked, wicked hero, little wiggle arms
His shoes are desterted, the box is all alone
No voice is perverted by tuxedo or 'phone
Untied, unravelled, unthought, unsaid
The man with the laughing hand is dead.
