Maybe since I'm mad inside my heart
Nasty gonna let it affect on me
Tried hard
To let her stay
When she's like piece of candy I know
Bless you gonna let it toss away
Hey

Pigs don't let it
Pigs don't let it
Pigs don't let it
No no no
Like a hole when I needed somebody I know
Pigs don't let it
No no no
Like sinners watch and rock and roll
No no no
No!!!!!!!!!

When she's like a piece of candy, I know
Nasty gonna let it toss away
Tried hard
To let her stay
Maybe since I'm made inside my heart
Bless you, gonna let it toss away
Hey
