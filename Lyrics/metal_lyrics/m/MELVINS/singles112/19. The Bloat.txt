I ain't nothing to the notice
800 miles of Prime
We be plain Jack belt loaded - Ha!

I pause I holler
Still powder line
Selling bulge egg tourniquet - Ha!

The more you know the brain
The more it homicide
Belt strip telephone - Ha!

Give me forty six
Give me forty five
Can't place down dance stone - Ha!
