[Flipper cover]

There are eyes that cannot see
And fingers that cannot touch

That's the way of the world

There are dreams left empty and blank
And legs that have ceased to walk

That's the way of the world

There are kisses undelivered
And Sighs and moans unuttered

That's the way of the world

There are hearts no longer beating
And there's entrails spilled on the floor

That's the way of the world

There are eyes that cannot see
And fingers that cannot touch

That's the way of the world

There are hearts no longer beating
And there's entrails spilled on the floor

That's the way of the world
