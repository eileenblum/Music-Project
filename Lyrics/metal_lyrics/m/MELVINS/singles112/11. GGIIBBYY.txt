I take my feel good lord your gonna be
You make my half done witch make chance to be
Have I a feel good lord your gonna make the past
I can't take opinion of your ways
Forget we were left my overhead
I can't make it go away

I eat fried chicken being happy dastardly
Time is every pig meat salary
Pine that car seat seemed to go with everything
As with most of my egg show it
Forget we were left my overhead
I can't make it go away
