(You'rea fucking hereRight here with the stainSecret cost for you and IYou have the wheel) Behind my witch I watch your nightmaresAnd all that I spy is reaching through my lonelyMy sin has made nowI smell something nastyI'll start in the begining,I stole all that I'll be (What made you come here?We broke it allGive it upWhat meaning makes you so coldNothing, not at all) Behind my witch I watch your nightmaresAnd all that I spy is reaching to meMy sin has made nowI smell something nastyI'll start at the beginningI stole all that I'll be
