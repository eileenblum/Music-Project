There's a little animal, way up in the airMy nose and tongue are roving, but maybe it's not thereThere's a little man now, in the middle of the earthHe gives himself these orders and let it all be burnedThere are lots of makeshift wonders, seven in the worldFive of them will not be noticed and three will not be heard There's a meal there's a window, there's a face that you can't seeYou can keep what you've stolen, just give it back to meI vow to taste my vengeance, even if they dareMaybe his time is coming, and maybe he's better off
