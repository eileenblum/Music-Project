Red knight #1We were windBlue blind right enough One of my babiesIs right with none My own wheel's gone low nowCuz he's right, and simple The four-eyed musclemanNothing more big andThe true are not enough I was lookingRed nine #1My own wisdom's won nowCuz he's right and simple Mastered in the morning of my heartDrove away and takes someI found the number oneThe raging life for we menSimplyOnlyLessons Before we dieShe'll only kiss it wayBefore you fit to the sand then be shocked to revealIf you live for the seasonYou have more than a reasonCould you tell motion?Could you tell by the light?Can't you tell that it's you? A matter of stateWhat makes you live past annoying thingsIf it's all a mistakeWell it's real good looking
