Now look at that cross man talkingWithin an earthenware dug in Within that dog and fakingNow look at that frog man talking Let it goLet it beLet you and me believeIn your hairdoAnd your ragingAnd your baby blue is dying Let it beLet it goLet you and me believeIOn your hairdoAnd your ragingAnd your baby blue is dying Now look at that frog man talkingWithin that dog and breaking
