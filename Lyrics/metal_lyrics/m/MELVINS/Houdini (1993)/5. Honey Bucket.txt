Eight times a fell a foe fi
Like overcast and clean
I gotta motor felt the wheel
Real fashion peel.
Try jacking blacken for more
Handcuff for special keys
Tribblize and neck down divide
This'll be his size.

Throw the case a plasticine down
Maybe after you more lay
Ain't about to pick my rounds
Sister's in my way.
I'm as fast as my own stand
Clean glass and most of all
Been around the sore retain
Language in the wall.
