Moss in the morning let's you in
Is it a field day make me sin
It's only warm, might let you stay
Moss in the morning might be way

Chase
Learnin'
Finally
On your ray
Might be bey
Lucky day
Now

How could you ever morse it down
Extra often is not my sound
She'd better hope an you better mind
Mix me over might left be wide
