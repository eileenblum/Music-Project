I know something that you would never believe
I wish I was able to finally make you agree.

Now you set me straight
And you told me things
Then erased my slate
I'll do what you say
As long as you feel
And I can be had
Without sex appeal

I know something that you would never believe
I wish I was able to finally make you agree.
It's times like this, baby, that makes it all seem worthwhile
I'm lookin' for something that I can find in a smile.

Now you set me straight
And you told me things
Then erased my slate
I'll do what you say
As long as you kneel
And I can be had
Without sex appeal.
