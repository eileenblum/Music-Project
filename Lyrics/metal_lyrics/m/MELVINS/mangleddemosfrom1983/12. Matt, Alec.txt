I'm sick of trying, I'm sick of trying oh my
my useless crying, my useless crying gets me
it gets me nothing, it gets me nothing i know
I'll never beat you. And so I bang my head
pounding the walls til I see red
I bang my head, I'm biding my time until I'm dead.
It gives me courage. It gives me courage to be
so discouraged and I don't have to worry
don't have to worry I know I'll never beat you
so I bang my head. Pounding the walls til I see red
I bang my head. biding my time until I'm dead
give up. give up submit and say you're wrong.
give up. give unto me. give up, give up submit
and say you're wrong. give up
I'm sick of trying. I'm sick of trying all my
my useless crying, useless crying gets me
it gets me nothing I know, I'll never beat you
and so I bang my head. pounding the walls til I see red
bang my head. biding my time until I'm dead
give up. give up submit, and say you're wrong.
give up. give unto me
