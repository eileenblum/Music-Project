Two sides of half-breed
And we both begin to bleed
And don't know which folks go to follow thee and make'em me
It's heartbeat try and mock me
And it looks O.K. to me
My Saturday never Sunday
And a moat a fall of thee
Lay down pent up thank god
I got you wanna see
They made it out like a child
Of the modern day anatomy
It's dirt ten and monologue
And it make it's wall deplete
Like Saturday and night may
And this is all I made
Black dog and distant crawlin'
On a watch you for the reason
They made it out like the child on the mind more look and find you'll see it
It's a hell indeed and a seventy
And it look O.K. to me
My Saturday never Sunday
And moat a bite a lee
Two sides of half-breed
Now it's just me to bleed
The count of four forty-five that leaves now five chop the speed
It's a dirty war and mind law
And makes it five to fourteen
It's a heartbeat never Sunday
And it looks O.K. to me
