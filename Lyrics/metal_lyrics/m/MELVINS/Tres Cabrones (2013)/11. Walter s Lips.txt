[originally by The Lewd]Now he tells it straight and he makes it short
With a station break in his nightly report
I work all day and then I come home at nite
And I wait for Walter to recite
"And that's how it is" And he gave me the date
With a smirk on his face, he tells it straight
Foreign correspondents and film clips
I got the scoop from Walter's lips
Walter Cronkite, won't you tell me the news
I wonder if you're wearing shoes?
Walter Cronkite - sitting in your seat
Why don't you ever show us your feet?
"And that's how it is" And he gave me the date
With a smirk on his face, he tells it straight
Foreign correspondents and film clips
I got the scoop from Walter's lips
He allways gives me an explanation
He tells me about the world's situation
Walter Cronkite is such a gent
Walter Cronkite for president!
"And that's how it is" And he gave me the date
With a smirk on his face, he tells it straight
Foreign correspondents and film clips
I got the scoop from Walter's lips
