My batteries are low. Please change my Triple A batteries.

Peace sign be a time be a part of the grind.

And If I'm gonna say it with a hole in the bottom what
I want said I really want it in line

even though Dear God She just wanna blend

be a max Take ball of wax of backs until it coming from our hand.

Can I foresee the dimes a cross and the ceiling
thereâs a Boner on the horse you wish I ride.

Now I pulled into line to do see (she?) do pulled by
for a look for a little bit of light
see the boss cause heâs gonna ride my mind
sheâs gone tonight

be enforced with the rack cause sheâs goin to dododo
to the peni for the petal in the eyes.

That is right Mr. Cool
I donât listen to you

motor mouth talking shit when your living up the the
corpse of a body of a simian that is dead
and the crime for eternal

and his soul is hole in my mind that I leave with a
fore and itâs a forehead traction too blue site feel
full and a bullet for the real..

Sheâll get it sail

Look-into to rip your mind out

The big sail
Rip your tail
Weâre driving in an no wind

What you find
what you need

All you wanna do is sit and breed

"A tea bag ha ha ha"
