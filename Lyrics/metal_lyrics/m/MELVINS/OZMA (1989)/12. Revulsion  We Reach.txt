[Revulsion]

Repelled by just the sight
You take me you feel me coming on
It repells the big strong man
Now you want to take me for everything I am
Gotta word that's coming up coming up my throat.
It's a long ass word, gonna make me choke.
I like to hold my pride
Right in between my hands.
So I can feel it hang.

[We Reach]

I could have hoped for a better piece of your man.
Better times I wrote for glass, less, wind.
From both behinds in back, we're reaching one of each, in time.
Heart like a picture to be.
Hardly, we reach.
