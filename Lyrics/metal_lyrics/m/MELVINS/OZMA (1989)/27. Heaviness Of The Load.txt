You're little heavy
Of your dropping down load
You're thinking of your influence
With a right to unload.
'cause you're ready for your tenure
And the dropping down disease
There's something in your influence
Take the right to unleash.

Your whistle rolly
Sneaking up behind me.
I'm going lots o' lonely
But never gonna know it.
You're the one that takes it to the.
