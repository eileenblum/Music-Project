[Green River cover]

Firmly attached, always at my side
I'll let you go while I can still walk alright
I'd rip you out but you'd tear my flesh
How'd I get into such a surgical mess?
Oh, Leeech.
Coughing up blood, I'm coughing up love.
Coughing up blood, I think I've had enough.
I've had enough of you.
