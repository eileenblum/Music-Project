Let's begin
Let's all martyr my mother
I forget
Youâre the wonder walker.

What is there
This is true our cage misses
And is it mine?
And can it be your mouth?

We all are here
We all are just right near
And in my ear
I hear what you are now.

Albion, Albion, Albion, Albion

Underneath the Magick
Under all the Law
What is this thing I see?
Ordinary, ordinary

Albion, Albion, Albion, Albion

Let me tell the world
How you are
What will your wife remember?
Ordinary, ordinary

Albion, Albion, Albion, Albion

Now that you've opened
All of our dull minds
Let me thank you most repeatedly
Hands, eyes, tongue.
