Liar
Lies on and anyway
Leader
He cannot forget
The world needs now
And anyway I hate it
Leave it on the floor
The seer
Lies on and anyway
Maybe
Attach it to the wall
The world needs now
And anyway the crosses
It's later than you think

We all need
An old and all
Lately
He cannot forget
Holding out
And everywhere
I seen it
And we can all belong
The wheel
Sized up and everything
And feeling
Back against the wall
The world is now
A motor, yeah
The native
We are not alone
