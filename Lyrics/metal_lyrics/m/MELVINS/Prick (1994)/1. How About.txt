I remember how I used to walk up and down the streets of the city of New Orleans.
Bound by drugs, bound by alcohol, committing the different acts of sin, living beneath my privilege, doing things that were contrary to God as well as the law.
But after all the things that I did and after all the sins that I committed, one day I heard about Jesus.
I'm just like the woman that heard about Jesus coming through the city of Jericho, and she had a problem.
But I had a problem with lying too and lying was sin.

I was living in sin, living and doing things I wanted to do, living and seeing what I wanted to see.
But one day Jesus touched my life and when Jesus came in the liquor went out, the drugs went out... my old lady... the lord ble...
I thank God my sins and judge every, and I have a right to the tree...

Doesn't mean jack to me and everyone that knows Jesus and everyone that's been born again and everyone that's been washed in the blood you heard the brother singin' about the blood, it's stuff about the blood, it's stuff about the blood of Jesus and wash away your sins and wash your mind and wash your heart and wash your life, oh praise God.

I thank God for that opportunity, and I just wanna let you know that he loves us and the Bible backs it up:
"That God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whoever should believe in him shall not perish but have an everlasting life..."

What's the plan when he comes through this door what happens?
Speak up, Butch, please.
Well he goes on and goes up to the elevator, gets drunk.
But I mean what does he do? He comes through this through this door?
Why donÂt you just tell me?
He comes through this door goin' around and takes the elevator.
What is this the kitchen or
No this is the freight elevator.
Do you have lots of people coming through like that?
Well, there's one.
Do you have a lot of celebrities coming through?
Well no holiday, uh, conventions and things in the back just coming up this way.
What do you think about Elvis Presley coming through here?
Oh it's wonderful.
Do you know anything about him?
Yeah. Do I know anything about him?
Yeah.
I was raised in his home town.
Are you gonna be saying something to him or be talking to him?
Well that's just gonna depend.
Are you looking forward to seeing him?
Sure.
Why don't you show us where he's coming in?

He's coming through this door here, there's two doors in this entrance, he's coming through this door here and this is and it opens back like this and we have this one the other door goes back like this...

You gotta have the blood of Jesus Christ the love from... to man he died on that cross so that we might have a right to the tree of life I come to tell you this my beloved...
