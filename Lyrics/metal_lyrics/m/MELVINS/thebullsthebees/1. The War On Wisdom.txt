They maybe moving
I must have missed my calling
Circle and a cover for the night
Semaphore

The world is watching
I must have missed my calling
Target on a mission for the head
Nothing's gonna matter now

The time is perfect
I must have missed my calling
I don't want to ruin to the raw
Civilize

Devout, you're the one that they're talking about
Only the living will have to find the way
Clean house, not even a mouse
They take one good look and they figure it out
Mice have the sense when to go and when to stay

Breathe uneasy
Sold a sea
To washer women and chasing eyes
Secret on the passing passage of the right
