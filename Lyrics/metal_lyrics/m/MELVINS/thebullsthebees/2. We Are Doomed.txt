It's amazing
Turn around and look at the whole thing
All together and take a big black bite of me

I was lonely, and there ain't a whole lot of holding on, going on

You were dreaming
I slept while you did the thinking
Thought a long time and took a big green bite of me

He was crazy, and there ain't a whole lot of holding on, going on

We were happy
Don't know which way I was crawling
Shook around here, and stole a big mean bite of me

It was heavy, and there ain't a whole lot of holding on, going on

Monotone gaze and I won't forget it
Mini tone monster tower now you won't need it

You said no one cares, no one cares about you
I'm amazed how you move around like you have to
