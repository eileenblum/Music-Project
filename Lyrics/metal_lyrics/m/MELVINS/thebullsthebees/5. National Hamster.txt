Better notice
And I want to be so falling down and foreign now
And it takes my sign along

Front and backwards
Keep my hands away and keep my wicked deadly nine
Hand it over

Can you ever try to guess my name
You can save it for a lady single
Running up like a local hero
You won't be here tonight
I can tell you that I'm overjoyed
Nothing more will happen to you
