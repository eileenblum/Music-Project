How - How does it - How does it feel?
How - How does it - How does it feel?
How - How does it - How does it feel?
Do you - Do you feel inclined?
Tense
Just tense
I got friends
Do you know
Not so easy as mine, is it?
Been telling lies
Go blind
How's your protocol?
In order to, uh,
Just beg, show the times
In the wrong state of mind
What do you mean? My lungs are fine.
