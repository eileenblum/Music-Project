Maybe once and maybe came away
I took a quarter of your witches
Fed them all aside
The weaker of the fortunes mystery
Hasn't yet all appeared to me
But then I never wanted more than three

Shade's know any reason
Flames are all I see
Reality's been forsaken maybe
Stirring all on a lee

So it seems and so it's came away
Might be the voicing frighten
And so it's gotten me
The weaker of the fortune's mystery
Has finally pissed indee
Indeed, made it for the eve

Shade's know any reason
Flames are all I see
Reality's been forsaken maybe
Stirring all on a lee
Now they're gonna burn me
Make all my flesh away
Real green turning half ball shaken
Leave me for a day.
