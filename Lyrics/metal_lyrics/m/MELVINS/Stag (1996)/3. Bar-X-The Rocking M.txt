Big slide across bitter by hiding hold a hail
Sit down and hold this town in fever
This mind is most of all like a vulture on a nail
And now he knows distorting feeler hell
this time he knows distorting

Be now the first of all by the low end on avoid
It's a pig in's an eye it's a soul it's a seether
Big eye and hold it all by the riding on a head
Dig down in the voice dic-storting feeler hell
Chicks hide the most dic-storting
