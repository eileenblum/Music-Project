Day light
time of ten
feel of a monster

Right here
the wilds grow
we ain't got a foot hold

Be nice
afraid the future
to be in now

Neck ties
fit survive
rest to be only forty nine

B-rown
body sez
pull in full red

Light so
protect and demand
but I it ride

Be damned
gonna lie here
all a land lone

Next size
lotus alive
rest to be only forty nine
