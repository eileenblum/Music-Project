See the faulty now
See the dawn - see clear
Five six it's gonna be narrow
By written law
For right of hollow form
By thy all night
Figure five fourteen motorized
She wants the price
Much play in wise paradise
Each time you raise the wire

On fire for me
My plane is happily
Gotta show gotta leave
Which indeed I'd like to

He's afforded final ten
Every damn one been done
Pick the part of me to fun around
Diggie forty Bodie innie
Master come un by gun
Last choice last chance chance
Peace time for the stonified
I can't stand the high design
Give me one of those whys to write
