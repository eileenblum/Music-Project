Ty plays the battle fold though bastardly
Follow said criminal in the form of his hand
He'll chance the overload when it's all about the end
Maybe the size and soul will settle in

Everyone is shifting all around his agonize
Can't make the sort of sound this and dust could sanitize
Gonna see in Earth all the edge

Wishing I was at the where all dull razors all began
Shoulder only angel seven half of every golden an
on those who really help me time unveils
Ty regarding visionary

Give it all to me I didn't wanna be
Singled out for the fire you little tangy
Make a mind make a friend give it up toenail
Too old for that buy me a big one
To say what's real your not the boss of me
Meet my old man he's just a funny
He makes more than you will take it away
I've got the only wisdom we're still friends
In time it will all be over it will be good
But I'm old and I'm getting older knew i would
Later days finally coming on to take me away
Little place near the holy one and let's run
