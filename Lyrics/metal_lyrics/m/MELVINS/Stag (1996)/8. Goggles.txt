Of weak intensity of sheer velocity
Silver boy gone but he left his heart
Happy to chain
Leave all his things
Get right and heave it
May be taste a few

Disguise dis all of you
Violence try to make me follow
I'm not a dog
But yes I will

Until my visions clear I'll not fight here
The last thing I need is time to feed
