I cut the throat of a billy goat and let it bleed
His frozen eyes were far more than I
It's kind of nice to know the things that make me happy
Just realize keep the dog away from me

I found it don't matter when
It's not nice to feel alone inside
This little goat won't mind
All my fears are just vanishing
And the blood will let me find a way
Will open heaven
Down in here all my dreams are filled
Good and bad they seem to be the same
And never lonely
If I just let this power in
It will work it will make me feel O.K.
Be sure forever
