You should have told but I couldn't find her
And tell her I can't see
Be steady got a line on a system for that's right
Be ready to mind it on distant man of war
Get another hold over or wheel in dee

Jimmy boy got a knock on a lead but it sold so rare
And funny but it's cold for this here time of year
Been days and a night for sitting on his knee
Bandanna in hail and he
