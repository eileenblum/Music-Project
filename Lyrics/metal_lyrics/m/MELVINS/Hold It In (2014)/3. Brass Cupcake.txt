And She had what she wanted from me
and shes got a nice centipede
and their nose and their mouths will bleed
Because they got a lot of mouths to feed

(Because they got a lotta mouths to feed
and their nose and their mouths will bleed)

And their nose and their mouths will bleed
because they got a lot of mouths to feed

(Because they got a lotta mouths to feed)

and she knew what she wanted from me
and I ate it accidentally

(And I ate it accidentally)

wonder world
wonderful worries
I dont Wonder when the dogs are hungry
I never think
I never have to
they do their best to remind me

Rot away
and the world looks like its ending
pick a knee
have it in my arrow
From your knees it all looks like its over
come alive and leave it for myself
From your bottom knee
I dont know whats parking lot
check your bottom knee maybe once or probly twice
I dont wanna see anything and a corpse you might
from your knees it all looks like its hell
leave it for myself
