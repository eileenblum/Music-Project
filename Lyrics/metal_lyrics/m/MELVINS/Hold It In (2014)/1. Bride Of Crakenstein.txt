What was that shit you sold me?
We both know, you should have told me
Got me spinning round the wrong way
Itâs gonna be a long day

Spinning round the wrong way
Spinning round the wrong way

Donât think Iâm coming down soon
Canât tell if thatâs a full moon
Wanna know my opinion?
I donât respect the thoughts of minions
I got a thought, itâs in this light bulb
Itâs burning bright, the bitch is over though
Got me spinning round the wrong way
Itâs gonna be a long day

Spinning round the wrong way
Spinning round the wrong way

Spinning round the wrong way
Spinning round the wrong way
