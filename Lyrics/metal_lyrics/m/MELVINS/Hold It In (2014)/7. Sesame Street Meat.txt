Watch it boy with the large tin mouth
And theyâre rolling, as itâs going south
Theyâre turning green
They left the oven open
Now itâs all up to me

Follow into an exit grave
Cosâ I got another life to save
I walk in circles
I scream and doubt
But I wonât believe, Ah!

You think I was a pain to mind?
And Iâd like to see it from behind
I paint it green
I turn the other over
I wonât breathe and I will no law

I could wait for the paint to dry
So I told him how to get me high
I made them leave
I open train, but I cannot sell the lie

Several days I was left alone
But I wonât cosâ I will not hold
I walk in circles
I scream and doubt
Was confused, but never in light

Sometimes words that I cannot read
Any loose live, they can believe
I look at him, I hold at me
I wonât confirm, and I will not speak
