I dreamed in wings of yesterday
Divide it seem to float on the line
Don't mean to be so empty
My baby walks it twist and turn
Black lazy lady sleep or ride?
She lay in pain up every night

The wolves are always near me
And never hardly hear me
I hold the forward drove
It makes me right
The wheels are always near
And twist and turn like a baby
