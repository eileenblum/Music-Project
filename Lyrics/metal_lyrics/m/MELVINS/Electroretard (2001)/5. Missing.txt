[Cows cover]

He had to switch to gin, 'cos jagermeister was giving him the shakes

I'm gone 'cause I'm missing.
I've lost sight 'cause I'm missing.

I can't stay, I can't stay.
I can't stay, I can't stay.
I can't stay, I can't stay.
I can't stay.

I don't care 'cause I'm missing.
I can't try 'cause I'm missing.

I can't stay, I can't stay.
I can't stay, I can't stay.
I can't stay, I can't stay.
I can't stay, I can't stay.

I can't hear 'cause I'm missing.
I'm not right 'cause I'm missing.

I can't stay, I can't stay.
I can't stay, I can't stay.
I can't stay, I can't stay.
I can't stay, I can't stay.
