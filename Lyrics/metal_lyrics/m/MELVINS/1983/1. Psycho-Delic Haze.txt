There's a place down the motorway (concrete)
We'll have our beaks - trust me, I can see (gone today)
I got a friend, Jesus, all I need
Another chicken broken, forward-looking beak
There's a time when the chicken lay
I won't care, 'cause I had it anyway
Livin', lovin', like a leap of faith
Somehow, it's a very lonely place
