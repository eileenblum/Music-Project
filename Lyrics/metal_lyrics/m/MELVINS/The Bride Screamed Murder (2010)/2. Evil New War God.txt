Listen to the bird its a lie
My monkey boiling me at night
Hole in the heaven and the world

Not likely, not slowly

You and me gotta look dead
The monkey king is mating
Boy to the brain in the world

Not slowly, not suddenly

What good is a dead beast?
Unleashed you left it following
Hole in the heaven in the world

Not suddenly, not likely

Plebeian, and waiting the harbinger invisible
Last in line, and boring like its heavenly

Right now!

Tired lung, the father what you said to me
My baby
Last in line, and waiting like its heavenly
You're blinded, right now!
