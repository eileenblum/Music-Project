[originally by The Who]People Try To Put Us Down
Just Because We Get Around

Things They Do Look Awful Cold
I Hope I Die Before I Get Old!

This Is My Generation
My Generation
This Is My

Why Don't You All Fade Away
And Don't Try To Dig What We All Say

I'm Not Trying To Cause A Big Sensation
I'm Just Talkin' 'Bout My Generation

This Is My Generation
My Generation
This Is My
