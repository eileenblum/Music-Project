Wake up, you never looked so glum
Tell me how will we know they can't hear us coming?
It's easy for me, I got a headstart running away
Keep up or your disease spread quick
So how did you learn to be sick, so cunning
It's easy to sing but you just keep on humming along
Did you hear that, I got a real bad feeling
How many moles do you suppose they're keeping?
Don't make a sound they're not dead, just sleeping

Dire, dire, dire, it's fleeting
Dire, dire, dire, it's fleeting
Dire, dire, dire, it's fleeting
Dire, dire, dire, it's fleeting
Dire, dire, dire, it's fleeting
Dire, dire, dire, it's fleeting
Yeah

Wake up, you never looked so glum
Tell me how will we know they can't hear us coming?
It's easy for me, I got a headstart running away
Keep up or your disease spread quick
So how did you learn to be sick, so cunning
It's easy to sing but you just keep on humming along
Did you hear that, I got a real bad feeling
How many moles do you suppose they're keeping?
Don't make a sound they're not dead, just sleeping
