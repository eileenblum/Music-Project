We move more, man I would like to gamble
I came with my poor four eyes
Crawling weakly warning my favorite come and lie here
Under my bed or deep under my fingers
Where are my hands and knees in times of winding
We night, it's only when we civilize that worm
For vagrant times we need it
What secret of your knowing is the beginning

WHOA!!!
Fine chance to be home, believe it, believe it
His widow's nest is growing cold
Set sail and hide your head
Look alive your going home
Look alive your going home

Wait Wait Wait Wait
Fine chance to be here, believe me, believe it
This widow's nest is growing cold
Set sail and hide your head
Walk the line your going home
Walk the line your going home
