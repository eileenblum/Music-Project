Take care of my princess,
Take her cause we live alone.
If you weren't so simple,
I would never come alone.
Raise your hand to heaven,
Now raise the one thats half alive.
You said you'd give a fortune,
If you could have it everynight.
The world is full of evil,
Now which of those are one of you.
Where is my one true angel,
With her golden wings so open.

Some would call it heaven,
Some would call it bravery.
I would call it neither,
I would call it thievery.
