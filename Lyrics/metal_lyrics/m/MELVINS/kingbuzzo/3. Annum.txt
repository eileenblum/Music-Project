And so he takes it once again
I didn't like you having one
And I could dream I can tell you to
That overboard with happiness
Be so fun be so free with ever
Every moment make it sure
You can deal with the dream
But have a picture taken over there
She can kneel she can scream
Until caught screamers have it like they say
Can you feel like a teen
That knocked on know the nowhere

But I can peel you at the seams and I can
Be on one knee you don't seem unnam
With all the houses at your feet
And I can leave all lonely
Let it beat away

And I wish books that read for me
And she could never lie you were
And I can deal I can deal
And so did morning might be like we said
You grow like a hundred lies
She never takes you as you know
Like a sword like a bill
Of certain money money

But I can peel you at the seams and I can
Be a lonely you don't seem unnam
With all the houses at your feet
And I can leave all moanin'
Let it beat away

And how's about those left once there
Do you feel like you're the same
And I can know like a million times
You never left me over there
Possible I could hear your song
In mourning I know I would know
I can feel I can scream
And feel you never like you have again
I can know I could see in the dawn
As mine we're moanin' where's your fist
Like a toe like a feelin'
Only many many
