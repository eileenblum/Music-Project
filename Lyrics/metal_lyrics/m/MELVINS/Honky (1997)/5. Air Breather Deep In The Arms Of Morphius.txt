And all this time free from the void
The world's drawn in for me
And I can't fight
The wheels all the way
The underside
And all this time free from the void
The world's gone in for me
And I can't fight
The wheels all the way
The underside

Don't break me down (to sleep)
Don't ?
Don't ?
Don't ?

Please be clear
Die, sleepy
First we appear, then we sleep
Fast asleep, fast asleep

Don't break me down (to sleep)
Don't break me down
Don't ?
Don't ?
Don't ?
