You'll always have a home here to make whatever kind of records you want
We don't do special packaging for bands that haven't gone gold!
They rejected your video, so what do you want us to do?
You should consider yourself lucky, any other major label would've dropped you by now.
The people here in radio just don't like your band.
At least your records are in the stores.
Well we won't do a thing unless the single moves
He's in a meeting,  he'll call you back.
