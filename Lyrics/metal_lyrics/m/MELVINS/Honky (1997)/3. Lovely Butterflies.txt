Nasty nature done for meat
Have you cut with all three knives?
Sing light for empty suite
The lovely butterflies

Have you ever only eaten what's alive?
Cut the thing for meat
Skin cooker for the hide
Cooked on the inside

I got a belly full of prime
Crawling through my intestine
Gristle-thick pork chop rot tan
The lovely butterflies.
