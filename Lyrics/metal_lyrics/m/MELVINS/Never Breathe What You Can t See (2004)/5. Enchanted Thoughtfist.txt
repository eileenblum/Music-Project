I am a product of the television ageZoom in on what's importantGet the point right awayA modern lack of patienceis it a virtue?Hardly ever read booksdevours easily few I say it againWe all believe what we want to believeDon't just question authorityQuestion everything Felt I had to confessIn Ginsberg's apartmentMy literary background's mostly songs and cartoonsHe said 'Oh, that's just fine'I sort of felt relievedBut when I hurl my word bombsHow much should be believed? I say it againWe all believe what we want to believeDon't just question authorityDon't forget to question me!Oh yeah, that's rightit takes nightswith insight The pressure of being taken seriouslybreathing down on meto keep up with my extremesand keep on planting seedsjoyous sabotageso far so goodnow where do we go from here?it always feels weirdwhen people come up to meand say I changed their livesI say 'Now it's your turn to start a fire!' Fire!Start your own fireBring the world fire
