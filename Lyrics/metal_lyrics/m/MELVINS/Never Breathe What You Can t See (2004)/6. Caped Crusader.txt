When I die you will findMy body clean and shavedDo not touch my genitalsWithout gloves on your handsLet no one come near meIf they are femaleWatch on my left handPerfume made just for menPurify my soul from unclean things Pray all nightSharpen knives to slaughter swift and cleanProphet says the animal should not feel any painOh God forgive me for all my sinsThe time of fun and waste has goneJudgment has arrivedWedding in paradiseThe black-eyed virgins callCome hither, friend of god God is great God is loveWe must kill infidels I don't care if I doWhat's right in the sight of menImportant thing is for meTo do right in God's sightAnnoint me with cooking oilI'm Daniel in the DenBaby killers and calico catsYou shall feel my wrath Yeh yeh-eh Yeh-eh God is GreatYeh yeh-eh Yeh-eh God is LoveNo No-o God but GodWe must kill in-fi-dels. I am ready to become a martyrGive the most precious thing I haveFight with my heart to the last dropOf blood... Blood Why do we hate you soTo blow ourselves up to blow up youEvery time you bomb our landsIt might be time for you to askWhat will their kids be like?What will their kids be like? Killin' time, blending inA smile and a paper hatFeel jihad each time I askWould you like fries with that?Our Bruce Wayne, complete with caveDispatched crime-fighting batsThink like me for a minute or threeYou'll come up with a wayTo slip right though your gates You'll never be secureYou'll never be secureThere is no GodBut God
