We are the locustsAnd it's time for the plagueThe Chick tracts and gun nutsWarned you was here Profiled as bad seedsSince before we could readMonkey wrenching world ordersIs how we party Red alert, orange alertEvery flavor of Fruit loops alertYour precious way of lifeIs under attack from inside We won't buy and we'll tryTo rot your house of cardsFrom the inside out Sacred Corporate logosAre the new swastikasTo the proud to bePatriotically incorrect hordes Deep fried societyHas gone to the wolvesWhile we eat awayFrom inside the bones Gnaw Gnaw Nibble NibbleChew Devour Scrape DeflowerThey know who we areSo why not just get worse? We won't buy and we'll tryTo torch all you hold dearFrom the inside out We've come for your childrenWe've come for your friendsTo save them from becomingRespectable citizens A prank a dayKeeps the dogleash awayJoin the new Boston Tea Party You can't have us, You can't have usYou can't have our moneyYou can't have our timeYou can't have our soulsYou can't have our lives Termites are loose in the house of cardsRise! RISE!All hail the Magic Plague
