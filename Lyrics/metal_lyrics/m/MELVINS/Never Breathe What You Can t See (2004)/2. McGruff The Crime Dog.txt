Thank you, OsamaYou are the saviorOf our economy todayNow that the dot comsChoked on their stock fraudsGoldmine's Homeland Security Why not hire half the countryTo spy on the other half?No more unemploymentOr privacy enjoymentThink of the dividends Who can we trust?We trust McGruff The Crime DogOur O.G. TV Narc Since you've accepted being drug testedAt work, At school, At play, At homeYou'll each rejoice atYour new companionWho follows you everywhere you go Always dressed in a trenchcoatAnd a McGruff doggie maskNever know who they areKuz you know better than to ask Who can we trust?We trust McGruff The Crime DogTotal Awareness He sees you when you're sleepingHe knows when you're awakeHe knows when you've been bad or goodSo be good for the sake ofMcGruff the Crime DogWatching your every moveYour guardian angel in a doggie mask In bed while you're asleepNo home invasionsBeside you when you get it onNo date rape Stick a thumbtack up your buttWhen you're slacking on the jobTogetherWe will protect our way of life Report all suspicious activityTurn in your friendsKeep your home terrorist free Take a Bite Out of CrimeTake a Bite Out of Crime!
