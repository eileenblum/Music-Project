If Stewart talked, what would he say?Enough to keep you here ten more yearsWhere we zap ya with our 'therapy'Throw the switch on your fantasies With our little electric ringClamped around your love thangFlash ya pictures, Clockwork Orange-styleLet's see what makes Stewart smile Yow! Yow! Yow! Try not to expandYow! Yow! Yow! Don't trip the Plethysmograph If the machine catches you erectAin't no way you're getting' outta hereBack to aversion therapyAs we watch our toys watch you Flood your face with ammonia gasAnd scent of rotting placentasLittle electric shock or twoThis is how we cure you Yow! Yow! Yow! Don't let it expandYow! Yow! Yow! Can't trick the Plethysmograph Little girls and boys, Panties past their thighsTry not to rise 3 strokes you're out! Comely amputees scratch themselves for fleasDown at Muscle Beach 3 strokes you're out Grand Wizard Newt in a sailor suitDancing with a flute3 strokes you're out! Brazilian babes titties made of claySpread their waxy legs for Great Danes Who invents this stuff? Do their kids join cults?What do they fantasize to get themselves off Wanna see child porn? Join the vice squadIn the name of correction we play with all we want Nothing is private any moreLie detectors were never this funSays the Attorney General ManAs he ends the morning prayer meeting Back to his office for electronic ringClamps it on his sinful thangRewind the tape, lemme see some moreSo I can feel my eagle soar Yow! Yow! Yow! He's speaking in tonguesYow! Yow! Yow! Now he can't shut it offYow! Yow! Yow! Crashing through the glassYow! Yow! Yow! Praise the Plethysmograph
