Cruisin' down the freewaySlupin' latte in my BM'er RoadsterI won for being Sales Rep of the WeekAt my now failed dot.com Then it happens againS.U.V. damn near killed meThey made the roads so unsafeI bought me one the very next day Why do I eat up so much gas?Why do I cut you off to pass?What do I drive like such an ass?Because I can! Yuppie Yuppie Yuppie Cadillac But I need my armored luxury tankTo drive to work and drive homeKeep my children safeAs I run down yoursWhile I talk on my cell phone Better you than me,Got important places to beSchool, soccer, psychiatrist,And then the wine boutique Why do I flaunt my upper class?Hogging two parking spacesWhy do I act like such an ass?No boundaries, man Yuppie Yuppie Yuppie Cadillac Blow them up! Key their hoods!Run them out of the neighborhoodMelt them down for Blue Chip scrapWar for oil? Draft them! Got a big hummer with monster tiresIt's the latest crazeWhen S.U.V.s are not enoughTo break a traffic jam Up and over I goMy terminator crushing cars belowI'm late for a meetingMore important than yoursMy Krispy Kremes are getting cold #! **#! What is it 'bout the NavigatorEscalade, Suburban, Explorer, YukonsThat brings out the road-rage macho dickIn everybody who drives one Icy curves, slow down'Nother pathfinder found it's way to HellWhat a great way to think the herdBut why should we have to share the road with Yuppie Yuppie Yuppie Cadillac
