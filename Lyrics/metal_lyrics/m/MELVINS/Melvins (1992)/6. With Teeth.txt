You've got the part that's living now
It's a tiny bit nasty
But it's a part now just the same

Have you the time to make it right
Lord knows I'm gonna let it fly

I know it's not very evil
But you've just got to learn to let it go

Sometimes when the heart beats wide
You can take it on the toe

Like seize the well known one
Like seize the well known one.
