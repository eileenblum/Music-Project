Lysol to get me high,
Two shots dispel my fear
Baby you need to sniff sum 'sol,
and I to be

She walks like animal,
I can walk &amp; be so free
She walk in like animal,
but I can walk like man

She knows this world on war,
I could be one, my one took a little world

Hyponeedle will get so sore,
I will go too well for me
It's sure to get you there,
I'm made to see

She walks like animal,
I can walk and be so free
She walks in like animal,
but I can walk like man!

She knows like a world of war,
I could be one,
my one would a little world

I could've felt no woman like you,
Under the world war tears to find
I could have felt no woman like you,
under the world war tears to find now.
