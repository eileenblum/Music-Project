Can you hear the war cry?
It's time to enlist
The people speak as one
The cattle, the crowd
Those too afraid to live
Demand a sacrifice
Of your life

Can you smell their stinking breath?
Listen to them
Wheezing and gasping and
Chanting their slogans
It's a grave digger's song
Praising God &amp; State
So the Nation will live
So we all can remain as cattle.

Can you smell the fresh blood
Steaming into the soil?
As our patriots,
Fathers, mothers and lovers
Admire the military style
Praising God and the State
Crying tears of pride
For all the fools slaughtered
For the maimed, the dying
And the dead
So the Nation will live
So the people will remain as cattle.
