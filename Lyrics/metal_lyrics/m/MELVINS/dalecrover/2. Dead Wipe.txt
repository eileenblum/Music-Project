Dead wipe dirt across your skin
Don't hex me with that scare
Blame me for the mess that you're in
You're one with the open head

Acrid sound
Jackin' me around.

Didn't ever want to come in this place
With a ragdoll squeeze on me
Dead wipe burdens on my face
Some kid I'll never see

Simple now
Bloated now.
