I like your hands
Mr Cancer see
Fell the timber
I felt you be
And if you were
Just like your will
We can end up
And we can turn up
And we can bleed

When man's only distant relative
Has descended on his own
You will know

Your blessened
I can feel your pain
You're man-like
You're friendly
You're me
