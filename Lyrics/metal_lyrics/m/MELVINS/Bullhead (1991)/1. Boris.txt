I'd like to take, I'd like to feel wanted
Take 'em up and take 'em down
I'd like to make a lot of, Generate the one eyed males
Build 'em up and let 'em fall
Just lay 'em on and leave the lily tight
Take 'em up and take 'em down
Generate, lay 'em flat like monkey eyed man
Leave 'em built right?
Stand 'em, tie 'em down
It's like sin
Boris likes a lot of little pigs to kick
Makes every single weapon he could ever feed
Boris feed
Let friend stone friend stone lie
Let's make, let's feel wanted
Take 'em up and take 'em down
My shake, mines monkey metal
Boris knows and Boris likes it all
It's like sin
It's a killer, she's killer maker
It reaches in and takes from a value mind, and not awake, still live
20 bulls have the back and see the lions
I got a small, got what they call a lack
A lack of half-way good, but it's all my own
I say I can't, but I really mean I won't
In their arm, or maybe up a nole
I see it all
See Boris has a way of seeing through my eyes
