Yellow decision
Within it till the end
I met a blue bear
I'm more wire
What am I?
Wrote a man and lady
But that's not why you're here
Separate your leader
And mine keeps lower
B-O-T-O-C-I

I just wanted bother
To live with civilized men
In change, only silence
Decide if you were angry
I do my breathing
And sit here on the hill
Borrow your meager
And I will go and B-O-T-O-D-I

But needs and teeth
At night we'll lead
At 90 degrees
My leopard skin
My needle bin
My autograph
A turnaround
