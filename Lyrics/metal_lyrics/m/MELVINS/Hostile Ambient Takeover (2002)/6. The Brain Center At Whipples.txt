Where is my fortune?
It's in my forced reaction
Doesn't one hand help me read now?
Doesn't one hand help the other one?
Put down the wild
Cooking like the face of banality
I've got it in my brain now
I've got it in my center

What are you talking about?
You started loud
So am I

Is it my woman?
Is it my head?
I hide up with my motor
And hide up with my hot goal
