I can feed
From the angel
On down here to blow my mind.
I'm away
From the nail
All we be will come alive.
And you are
My horrid
Rotten rings are wrong
Away from the mangle rare we don't need
I got the one to make me all right.

We ride
For never
Nothing can or will arrive
We fight
At zero
On holy right is round.
Do you well
We're willing
Hired hand for the eye
They are alive and wasted on me.

You are so in there
Will you leave me?
You as intended
But I'm not worried
Are they really harmless?
I don't believe it.
