If I could get the nerve
And move
I'd put them all to sleep.
That would not be wrong
For either you
Or what it is we see.
Somewhere there's a king
Who keeps his days for forgiving
Everyone.
If I could hold one thing
An anti-vermin seed
That I won't ever need.

Only for real
Will we all pretend
It over now.
Over my hand
I remembered all
And what it do to them.
And when you search your soul
You had better damn well tell
Green from gold.
And when I look for hope
If it's in my head
I'd say it's a bargain.
