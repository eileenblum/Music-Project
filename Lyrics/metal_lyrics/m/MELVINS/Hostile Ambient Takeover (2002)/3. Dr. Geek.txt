Now Dr. Geek
The key it's our job tonight
It's sanitary
And crazy with delight
And people say
Ignores about the light
And tips away
And now it's all right

It's time to deliver
And it'll make my day
And we'll be crazy
For free

Now Dr. Geek
The years are gone to our lord
It comes to me
That maybe it's too hard
And hopefully
It falls and stuffs in far
The falsify
By clean and air it's all

It's time to deliver
And it'll make my day
And we'll be crazy
For free
