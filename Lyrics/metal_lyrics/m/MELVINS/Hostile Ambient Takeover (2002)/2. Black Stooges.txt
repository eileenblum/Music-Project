Why deal?
And then a wheel
To fire along
And it's not not not a lie
I don't know
If I can leave
To live in peace
As it's wh... wh.. wh... white
Sodding line
And I'll go away
Hot in here tonight
And it's not not a lot of light

So what are you?
And what is he?
They're both to war
And I share share share aloud
Monterey
And in my way
The wing collides
And it's low low low to lay
As sin to breathe
To learn to kneel
To go to war
And I'm wow wow wow wowed
