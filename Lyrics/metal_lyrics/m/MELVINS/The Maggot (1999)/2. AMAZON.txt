By the time youâre natural
By the time you die
Iâll take my head and spin it for you
Iâll just look around
And I call you liar
And I call you dead
You come and poisoned all the things that I once set up on
Everybodyâs hungry
Everybodyâs high
Weâll sit around and ask ourself if it was all a lie
And I already told you
And I already say
But you have got to know yourself and so I let it slide
Can you get together
Can you hold my hand
It takes forever for the sound to get around
And I already love you
And I already want
But will we all just sore
