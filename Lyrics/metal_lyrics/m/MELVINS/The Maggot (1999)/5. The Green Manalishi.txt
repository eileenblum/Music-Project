[with The Two Pronged Crown]

[Fleetwood Mac cover]

Now, when the day goes to sleep and the full moon looks
The night is so black that the darkness cooks
Don't you come creeping around - making me do things I don't want to

Can't believe that you need my love so bad
Come sneaking around trying to drive me mad
Busting in on my dreams - making me see things I don't wanna see

Cause you're the green manalishi with the two prong crown
All my trying is up - all your bringing is down
Just taking my love then slipping away
Leaving me here just trying to keep from following you
