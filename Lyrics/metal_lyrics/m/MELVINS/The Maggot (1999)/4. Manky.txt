We need and be relieved
A sick animal come on believe me
We seize to be released
But we don't want to laid
Lesson died and lesson done
We bleed and that's my secret
I've burned to keep it down
But that sick keeps coming around

I gotta crawl and beg to buy
This sick just makes me stronger
Stoppin sick and stomping lies
And I will kill them off
I hate days and all at once
I hate misery and it's no wonder
I'm born to keep them down
But that sick keeps coming around
