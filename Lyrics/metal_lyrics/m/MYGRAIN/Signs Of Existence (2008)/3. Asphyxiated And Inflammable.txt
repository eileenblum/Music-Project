Look inside
To redefine me as your reflection
Grasp my breath
I don't wanna wake up with my head on a plate

Clutch my soul
Asphyxiated and inflammable
Seek and hide
Translucent truth in your mind

Scattering fathomless in depths
Trapped negligent and meaningless
This earthly cage is scorching out
Sweltering at every breath

All I can serve is to stack the bones
Swan dive in consciousness' black holes
Crumbling beneath the cracking skin
This shell I can't hide within

Asphyxiated and inflammable

Tearing this scatterbrained world down
Parting consolation's crown
Float in the tunnel of misconception
A living labyrinth of deception

Imagine the life as a delusion
Morphing to the flames of illusions
Penetrating trust to disarm
Beneath the crust there's a boiling calm

Look inside
To redefine me as your reflection
Grasp my breath
I don't wanna wake up with my head on a plate

Clutch my soul
Asphyxiated and inflammable
Seek and hide
Awaken back in life
...Redefine!

Asphyxiated and inflammable
Unavoidable settles inside
Impact of a weakening heart beat
Open the box, ignite the hell on earth
Obsessively pursued to perfection
Diabolical signs of resurrection

Look inside
To redefine me as your reflection
Grasp my breath
I don't wanna wake up with my head on a plate

Clutch my soul
Asphyxiated and inflammable
Seek and hide
Awaken back in life
