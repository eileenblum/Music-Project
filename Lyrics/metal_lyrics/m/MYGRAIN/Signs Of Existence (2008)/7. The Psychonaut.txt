Dominion of modern bestial sense
Premonition come into existence
Crack the crust to solve the cipher
Mystery radiating indistinct signs

Eyes conceal untouchable fury
Immersing in mind as a burning reverie
Recharging the lights of dismissed memories
Explore the void, expand vacuum nothingness

Subliminal disorder beneath the crust
Atonement with a pound of dust
Hooked to its empty shell
Kept inside 'till there's no more stories to tell

Like a precision-guided bomb
Residing in the core and waiting to explode
Creature from a distinct evolution
Breeding idiosyncrasy to revolution

Virus proven cybersoul, never alone
Your solitary kingdom is my home
Planet tearing passageways
Hack the ways to your shelter
To cross the burning point
Freeloader of an emptiness
Scaremonger scything completeness
Steering this endless labyrinth

The Psychonaut
He narrates miserable lives like a disease
He stabs you where it hurts the most
And makes you bleed

Weakened to cast own shadow
Sense the feet falling through the ground
Crawl beneath to reflect a mirror
The air is heavy and pressuring down
Red clouds pouring through rapid eye movement
Emulated madness to adjust the trembling imbalance

It climbs to the top of your world
To run the engines spitting death and hurts
Retaining the gaze of your God
Residing in the pain that never stops

The Psychonaut
He narrates miserable lives like a disease
He stabs you where it hurts the most
And makes you bleed

Virus proven cybersoul, never alone
Your solitary kingdom is my home
Planet tearing passageways
Hack the ways to your shelter
To cross the burning point
Freeloader of an emptiness
Scaremonger scything completeness
Steering this endless labyrinth
