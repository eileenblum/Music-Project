Fear casting this sight with its monumental shadow
Descent to the earth wearing unidentified doom

Freezing sun beyond the curtains of black
No escape from falling past the event horizon
Falling empires fading into the landscape
Shape of the formless mass of attracting everything

(Lost inside escape velocity
Falling in particles, fight the lost gravity
Celestial bodies, colliding interstellar clouds
Rendering its dense invisible interiors
Morphing to the darker space phenomena
Sucked into a new era)

Inflamed world taking stranger turns
Fight the gravity in trembling imbalance
These polluted shades, pixilated rooftops in flames
I distort my appearance

Drifting to the void with no soul
Smoke the freedom with your ashes
Grasping widespread warning, the day of reckoning
Foredoomed to wander, shaken and stranded
Transparent snow globe world
Imbalanced atmosphere shatters

Subdued to explode, the host of new life
Appearing from these reptile eyes
The scattering of light
Capture my breath as I plunder away
I, the Blind Visitor - the explorer of empty skies
Tormented lives
Worms to a cosmic storms
I diverge from the form

Reformation evolving to cascade
Purging and taking our thoughts and memories away
Encroaching inside, spreading disease threadbare
Strangler of the universe, take and disperse

Warped minds disconnected - Lost in reality
Reprogrammed to forget everything!

(Hypnotizing circles in the smokescreen
Cycle repeats - Rebirth of a different scene
Weakened breath forming a dark nebula
New dawning of a darker era)

Dark kinetic energies invade our souls
Oblivions forming eternal black holes

Drifting to the void with no soul
Smoke the freedom with your ashes
Grasping widespread warning, the day of reckoning
Foredoomed to wander, shaken and stranded
Transparent snow globe world
Imbalanced atmosphere shatters
