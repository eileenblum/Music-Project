Soaked to the skin
Illusions injected and way out rejected
Nothing's for free, so what you wanted to be?
Black ocean emptiness, explore my ignorance
Chew up my dirty flesh - ignorance is a bless

Shining in a dying light
...narcotics in a frantic sight
Take my hand - let's burn together
...rise to another level

Linking into radiant winds and storm
In this bleak reality I've been reborn
Dig under my skin with your claws
Camouflage your flaws

My muted speech sticks like a leech
Complex love turns a mess - a paradoxical happiness
Mirthless divine devouring me raw
Unavoidable disaster turning around my jaw

Shining in a dying light
...narcotics in a frantic sight
Take my hand - let's burn together
...rise to another level

Linking into cosmic winds and storm
Scrounging and emptying every core
Dig under my skin with your claws
Disguise your flaws

Parasite in an fool's paradise
Playing god now throw the dice
Steering madness completing perfect puzzle
...the hand that rocks the cradle

This perfect chaos re-forming to reign
It's back never to leave again
Cross the boundaries of dream an true
...forsaken passages to refuel

Connecting into breeding engines
Spewing out inhuman purgings
All memories are left in slumber
No one hears you're going under

Stretching out from minority
Playing god by atrocity
The hand that rocks the lachrymose cradle
This perfect chaos - euphoric and fatal

Parasite in an fool's paradise
Playing god now throw the dice
Steering madness completing perfect puzzle
...the hand that rocks the cradle

This perfect chaos re-forming to reign
It's back never to leave again
Cross the boundaries of dream an true
...forsaken passages to refuel
