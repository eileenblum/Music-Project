(Something has died that once lived inside
The undying atrocity benumbs to feel no pain anymore
Bias residence with contaminant rage that has no boundaries
Created with a slay-conceived spirit
No mercy for the weak in this...grand human machinery)

Dispersing from the shades of grey
Blazing through everyone and everything
Inaccurate and rapid moves
Heart beats echo in vacuum
The core scraping pulsation
Thrusting closer to the edge
No escape from myself
This delusion is my shallow grave

In your head, in your mind
Emptiness will fill the void
Blood runs still and cold, stand at the ruins
Humanity's deserted zone

Bleak sunshine burning to dust
Invisible tissue between us
Lost generation guiding the way
Foreshadowing angels to fall astray
Bloodshot eyes, blood painting the world
Adjusting to pain and venom words
This mental masturbation
Breeding progenies of a bastard nation

In your head, in your mind
Emptiness will fill the void
Blood runs still and cold, stand at the ruins
Humanity's deserted zone

Underneath the empty appearance
The weight of absence so unbearable
Human wasteland, sinking quicksand
The Kingdom of Devastation
As I change my shape everything fades
Spirit withers and body turns into a cage
In too deep, silence turns to rage
Covering this shallow grave

Stuck in this instant forever
Feelings never to sever
Empty shell within a gunshot
Everything you ever loved has turned to dust
Trivial goals to price your name
Revival of incomplete human race
Every breath reflects a disaster
Intertwined to the limbs - Faking every laughter

In your head, in your mind
Emptiness will fill the void
Blood runs still and cold, stand at the ruins
Humanity's deserted zone

Underneath the empty appearance
The weight of absence so unbearable
Human wasteland, sinking quicksand
The Kingdom of Devastation
As I change my shape everything fades
Spirit withers and body turns into a cage
In too deep, silence turns to rage
Covering this shallow grave

(Fainting prayers in the street
Painted in these blood-red sheets
Swarming army of paper dolls with scissors
Burn and modify my thoughts, take my figure
Condemned to forget, forever wandering
My shadow companion is my only friend
Beneath my transparency I'm nothing but a mystery
We're nothing and everything
The Embodiment of Withering)
