Hates grow colder, detach the weight from my shoulder. 
Be aware of stepping back to the hole, my undressing stare makes me you swear on the role.

Underneath - the undercurrent of smothered.
Discontent - burn imprisoning pain.

Approaching guiding lights to set you lose, free fall inside to pass the noose. 

Subside to my resilient dark halo. I reside in your subdued sparks and make you follow. 
Submerge into my shadow!

Collide my absorbing dark halo, I reside in your blackened heart and make you follow.
I'll cover you up with my infinite shadow!

Inhale, come closer. Come and listen to the whisper of the serpent tongue.
Every heart beats gets you hurt and sore, every heart beats gets you killed once more and more.

Underneath the surface - smothered fire - to numb to separate wrong from rights.
Truth lies naked where you don't belong, falling back into pieces with abysmal song.

This I tell you now...

Justify my means it makes no difference like pure evil in the flesh replacing ignorance a ghost of human soul once kept lies behind my burning eyes I'm cold as ice.

Inhale this perfect control, disappear beyond your house of glass in a blink of an eye falling through the time. 
I'm your security, the one to shed your second skin. I will chew you up and spit you out.

Now she exudes inflammable desire. Wreaking havoc with her smothered fire imperceptibly accelerates my time.

Underneath - the undercurrent of smothered.
Discontent - burn imprisoning pain. Truth lies naked where you don't belong, falling back into pieces with abysmal song. 

Inhale this perfect control, disappear beyond your house of glass in a blink of an eye falling through the time. 
I'm your security, the one to shed your second skin. I will chew you up and spit you out.
