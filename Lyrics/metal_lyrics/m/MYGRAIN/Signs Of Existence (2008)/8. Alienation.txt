Define my conscience what is real
Characterize the ways world disappears
I try but I can't decide from reality and fantasy
Glittering darkness room by room
Nothing satisfies as I enter bloom
Fear my world so puzzled and mystified
Stage of pleasure and pain is what I hide behind my eyes

My inability to feel real
Hyperreality feeds me
Falling into my secret window
As I walk the Earth unhallowed

Anything, everything
Tricking, conscience what I've seen
Detached from engagement of emotions
Meaningless identical devotions
Rapidly taking any given shape
Filtered experience - Depicted in hate

Your demons - my angels
Capsized parallel dream world
Parting ways to breathe, to be alive
Crusade of perfect stranger
Disconnect the splendor
Alienations steers 'til the end

Split apart from a faculty of mind
Non-existent world in a glimpse of an eye
Simulation of something to never exist
This authentic fake - Mind misled

Light years away from here
Hyperspace to escape my fear
Simulation of familiar place
Reproduction of empty appearance

My inability to feel real
Hyperreality feeds me
Falling into my secret window
As I walk the Earth unhallowed

Your demons - my angels
Capsized parallel dream world
Parting ways to breathe, to be alive
Crusade of perfect stranger
Disconnect the splendor
Alienations steers 'til the end

(Your demons - my angels
Crusade of perfect stranger)

I'm sick of spewing my words out
So puzzled that I won't wake up
I'm sick of spewing my words out
So puzzled that I won't wake up
