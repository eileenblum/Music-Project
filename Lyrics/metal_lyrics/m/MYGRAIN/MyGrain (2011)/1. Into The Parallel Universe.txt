Into Eternity...

In lucid dreams I detach

Teardrops of deliverance
Quantum erasing science
â¦ Obscure and esoteric
Beyond the hollow face
Extending time-space
Once concealed ignites to decipher

As I lay in absence
Leap into my dream-state
â¦ The parallel universe

Away terrestrial home
You're grown into cold
â¦ The very substance of implanted truth
Avatar's view to unfold
In lucid drams I control
Astral projection, my interstellar throne

Awakening to my judgement day
In absence, the flash before my eyes' strained dream domain
I revive to paint the stars, my grains of sand
Flying within space and time
Departed for redeeming

As I lay in absence
Leap into my dream-state
â¦ The parallel universe
I'm set free eternally
By my dream-like silver cord
I re-align

I am the particle storms, beyond the conscious black holes
â¦ In the falling dark that grows
Shifting dreams entwined, to a tranquil terminal time
The pulse intensifies, now re-align.
