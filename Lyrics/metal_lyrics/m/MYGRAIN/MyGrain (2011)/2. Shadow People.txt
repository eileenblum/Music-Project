Take my hand and breathe me in
I'm the vile shadow within
Passing sands of space and time
Distorted face of the new formation

Worlds apart to entertain
Apparition beyond pain
Drift between dimensions
Traverse all the lights and shades
Escape through the astral door
Aside another downfall

My emptiness will dig a hole in your chest
The subliminal void guiding your quest
Dreams in a slumber, you're in my control
Reforming the pathway, I'll topple your throne

Deep inside (off) this mortal coil
Weakened light that casts no all-absorbing shadow
Drift between dimensions and take another form
Shadow people, rebirth of morphogenetic code
â¦ New formation

Worlds apart to entertain
Apparition beyond pain
Drift between dimensions
Traverse all the lights and shades
Escape through the astral door
Leap to another life-form

Omnipotence of a mutinous self â orchestrate the multidimensional clash
Demonic chaos of a silent surface â cruse and effect in a soul furnace
Quality intertwined, the serpent divine that takes you...

In immortal streams I see you
Mirrored and lit by this heathen glory
These mortal realms are now overthrown
Desire for my infinite story
Shadow People
