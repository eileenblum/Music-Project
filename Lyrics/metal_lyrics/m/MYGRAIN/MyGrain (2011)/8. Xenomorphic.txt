Phantasm of deserted realms
Approaching glowing red
Felt the burning in my soul
Captured all... All I've ever known

Lost in xenomorphic temples
Euphoria of non-existence
Six hundred light-years away
An explosion driven shock-wave

Nebulous speed of light-years
Cosmic collision of imminent mind override
Sight of my burning eyes
Xenomorphic shadow, reaching the light of days... The light of days

Xenomorphic

This celestial sphere breaking
Consciousness in the taking
Invading miraculous sway
Dark particles strain

Life craving binaural threat
Encroaching pulse of death
Transfixed like a deadweight bait
Waiting phantom limbs paralysed
Felt the burning in my soul
Captured all... All I've ever known

Ageing and dying eyes closed... Ageing, dying
So many questions unsolved
Forever night unfolds
â¦ I don't belong

Mesmerized ignorance
Settling for non-existent will
Asepticism, schism, drilling in
Xenomorphic all consuming holographic thoughts
Departure of our will... Demeaning
