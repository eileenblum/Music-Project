Hordes of the metamorphic kill filling the sky
Reflecting the total
Termination in a blinding blink of an eye...

Intoxicated bliss...
Decayed, one last kiss...
The countdown starts from here

Shape shifting face of deformed quality
Blazed by sun winds
Smokescreen beyond polluted unreality

Under oath for tainted declaration
Wandering soul alone, so astray
Sworn to ungraceful definition
Fulfilling demise
I've forseen the end of the prayers' epic fail
By the fallen angel of retributions trail

Come and taste the flavours of the failed breed
Living to die for satisfaction guaranteed
Eye of the void â the show of your tainted dreams
â¦ Children of abysmal machinists of the end

Travelling without a movement â time without an end
Shadows fading among the planetary collision
The fathomless descent
Deadweight world â nexus for perdition
Breeding from within â the void resurrecting
â¦ So depraved
Peel the rotting fruit of your extinction

A God-puppet of abject transgression
Salvation through the joyride of devastation

So I lay my darkness on you
New residence for my poisonous bloom
