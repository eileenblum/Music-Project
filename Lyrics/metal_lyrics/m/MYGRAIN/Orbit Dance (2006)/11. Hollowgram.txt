Hey I'm suffocating
No need for anticipating
My deepest sight is turned off
Without a light
Depression gives me
The permission to live my life
Without a fight

Alienating from you my friend
We'll be separated till the end
Until the end
Attain new things and seek new trend
My heart inside I'm trying to mend

A hollow gram in fashion
With deceiving quicksand
Tearing it all down
45 degrees will ease the pain
Smoke the asylum haze and abide forevermore
Set the pyre of a broken core

Hate breeds new life
With pain and breathtaking strife
Trying to live my life without the blame
To refuel my flame because I'm not the same
Your rules are made to keep me down
That's why I'm wearing this frown
45 degrees is all I got left
Anger is a policy not a theft

Trying to make things as simple as I can
In the end I don't think you even give a damn
Won't give a damn

Past moments are stealing the sense
Giving all a new presence
Tripping to seek the cache of ease
I never heard you say "please"

Quicksand draining through my fingers
Wandering on but doesn't stay
I know you have to fade away

Feelings are hiding from me I say
The pain is binding my way
Sugar coated sky is turning black
There's no coming back
