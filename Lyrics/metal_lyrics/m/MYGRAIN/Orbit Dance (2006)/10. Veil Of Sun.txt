Cover my dreams with veil of sun
This sight obscured where it all began
Ascending from blear, burying all sincere
Hiding light unmasks my deepest fear

Waves abandoned the shore
Dead calm
Like a preceding crackle of the choking fire
Slowly I taste the blindness we fed
Inch by inch I draw inside to recoil
To split my first drop of turmoil
With splitting hand I turn the page
Into the next blistering rage

Taking of tomorrow
Breaking from shadows
It's forming and lightning the wall
Repel and hollowed
To fight back against it all

I'm the nameless as I'm pushed around
Like the countless faces unknown
Next in the line to blow
Pleasure we negate, locked inside our hate
In surrounding hate!
There's no one else for us to open the gates
Until we loosen up
The wires to find the lost faith
Stuck inside the roulette
Awaiting the revolving lead
Drilling in your head!
