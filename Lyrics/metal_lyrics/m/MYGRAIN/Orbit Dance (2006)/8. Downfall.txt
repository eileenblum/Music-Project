Get down with this, yeah

Alone I stumble here - living in a lie
Come and use my ferocity - giving all my life
I swallow this love so lean
A flickering strife
I fall down on you skin
Like a free fall in and out, yeah

Blindfold steps in a solitaire
Gave my eyes for the pain
Please tell me your name and come
Live for the game
Crystal clear but whacking insane
I strive through the pain
In this cynical rain I'm on the downfall

Downfall burning my fire
Strokes my empire entirely insane
And my chords were being so deprived
One more time my tongue is burnt of this free fall

Come by my side to take this ride
And cut my thorns to release my sanity
To believe is the only way to see
Peel away my impurity and set me free

These words are not a claim
But a prayer out of astray
Awaiting the last dance
That gullible glance to exhale
Made to digest all the things
That are not for sale
In the last curve
We come and blow the nerve

Blocking revelations
Stroking your creations
Push it out
Block the way and give a shout

One more time I hold the key for you
Try to make it last for good
One more time to turn it all over
Trying to uncover
But I will not bend
You can't take me to the end
I still got my words to say
I still hot this place to stay
