I'm distracted, can't concentrate
Wrapped around all the things I hate
Sucking up the juices and leaving bruises
Underneath the spoiling level
It's rising up and ringing the bell
My lunar howl binding your shell
Slowing turns of orbit dance
Taking the last chance
Descending sky I watch in distance

Feeding on this transgression where I stumble
Searching for the reasons when I crumble

Reigning... Memories flashing from the distance
Reigning... The slowing turns of orbit dance
Scars open wide I follow you

Shut up and owe this laughter
Shut up and bereave dismay
Shut up and return this favour
Shut up and detach yourself

Asking those questions "why"
Under descending sky
Memories drilling to my bone
I walk this path alone
It's pouring tears like a flood
Thicker than my blood
Anxiety caters hollow
I had a feverish dream to follow

Memories flashing from distance
Slowing turns of orbit dance

Lust to dust
Waking up the rust
Trading our souls to the caustic blast
Descending sky I scrape in distance
Prizing idles in the cosmic chains within
Life scatters and serves us
The new beginning of everything
Slowing turns of orbit dance
Taking the last chance
Descending sky I watch in distance
