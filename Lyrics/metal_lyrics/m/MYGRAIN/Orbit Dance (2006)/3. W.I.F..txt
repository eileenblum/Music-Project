Tied my flashback in thousand frames and
Bound the waves in amorphous sand
Fed my will with the grains of a broken land
For the memories I yearn to rise and stand

One-track mind
Leaving the frozen pulse of entity
Turn the solitary tide
We'll meet again in the place that we used to know

Still, you're my intoxication overall
You're my only drug for the pain
And you're my world in frames
I need to turn the stones and carve these letters
(High!)

Rewinding the years back in the place it all begins
This poor acceptance is for me to inhale
Angling the stars in the mind stream
To make 'em shooting till we see
The stairs conducting to that fainting edge

To the thrones of my silence
Abandoned discipline's steep fences
Once it all used to be mine
Now it's set to turn back the time
Let my soul refine

(The polluted mind, world in frames, we are...)

Clarifying distress for a triumphal re-action
But my mind is just so closed
Redefine before the ray of dawn and we are
On the page to a place called home
