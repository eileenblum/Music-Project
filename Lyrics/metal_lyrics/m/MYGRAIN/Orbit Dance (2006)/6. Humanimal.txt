Going backwards and feigning dead
Dodging the stares with fainting head
Excuses staking your only dread
So you plunge forth and detach the red
Presence of duality lies on the top of the crest
Feel the gravity of this insanity
Underneath your chest

Dark curtains will fall and burst
Should I restrain my endless thirst?
Noise of vanity springing out
Stealing the choice of drugging without
Presence of duality lies on the top of the crest
Feel the gravity of this insanity
So go - fuck the rest

It's in my fate
Within my hate
It's in my every insomniac place
Living in my dreams
Forcing my head
Twisting everything I've felt

Humanimal drugged is clarity
Bloodline in history, settling the mystery
Unconscious, parallel reality
Puzzles all, piece by piece so blithely

We're the spiteful creatures of twilight
When the moon shines so bright
Humanimal...

I'm the perfidiousness lurking for a prey
And I scent the dread in your way
Crossfire of living mess
Kneeling down for a soothing ignorance
