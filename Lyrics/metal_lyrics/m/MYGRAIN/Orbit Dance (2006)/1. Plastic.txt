You shed your soul to be content
Claimed it's worth every cent
Into this, blasphemous bath you went
So take a glimpse of happiness for rent...

Filtering thoughts with material
Distress is now here to enter you
Days passing through your fast lane
Licking the red carpet to end your pain

Plastic inside
It's all in your mind
The secure of a synthetic love
Collide in my love proof exterior
Take my hate's interior
Fall down from grace
Crowning for disgrace

There lays intoxication of self-assertion
We're about to break
There bleaks of illumination of realisation
When we are to speak

It's the prison of material so blue
A plastic bath for me and you
We're the prey of reality
For these moments of mortality

Those little things invite you inside
Sparkle of a plastic mind makes a misery-park
I'll be watching at you outside, so take a free ride
(And) I open myself to your emptiness tonight

Lingering spark of something so ordinary
It twinges and turns until I calcify
