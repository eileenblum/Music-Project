I walk alone in this world
The night is my guide
Embraced by darkness and shadows
The moon is my bride

Through the endless path to the abyss
I am guided by the light
By the light of my dark soul
That shines in the night

The way is long
And this life is short
But the night is my guide
Nothing else i'll need

Eternity i'll reach
When the darkness come to me
And then i'll be free
'cause the night is my guide

The wind caresses my face
And the rain cleans my body
My mind projects all the stars
The night is my guide

As the years are passing by
Still the moon is my bride
I am the bearer of the light
I am guided by the night
