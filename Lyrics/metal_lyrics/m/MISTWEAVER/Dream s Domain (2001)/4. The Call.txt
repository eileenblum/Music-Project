In the fall of the night
When the darkness descends
There's a place far away
Where the souls are free

They wander wide
With no fear to this life
And they always appear
In the misty fields

'come with us' they call
You will always be free
'come with us' they call
Here you'll find the peace

When the angels dance
Into the eternal night
Then the time will be stopped
And the gates will close
