Hidden in your mind
Beyond your imagination
Where the dreams die
But reality's a dream

Memories from the past
And sad visions for the future
Will come to you
When the realms of death arrive

Through the caves of the unknown
Through the abyss of your thoughts
You will find the truth
In your sickest fantasies

And the night is so dark
And so long to be asleep
And to dream with things
That you wish better forget

Morpheus is descending
From the throne of the dreampower
Prepared to rule your life
And to guide your dreams

He's the lord of dreams
He's not man nor beast
He controls your thoughts
And the nightmares that you see

The night becomes a hell
Where the demons dwell
And this endless torture
Won't let you rest

The dead raise from the tombs
And they'll come for you
And if you are caught
Then you'll be lost

I want to get away
To a place where i can rest
And i want to escape
From these dreams of death

I want to get away
To a place where i can rest
And i want to escape
From this dream's domain
