Now everybody is dead
See their corpses all around
Their faith led them astray
They were blinded just by pain

Away left all the hopes
Of a life in peace
A salvation through martyrdom
Your souls will burn!!!

Kiss me now my lord
They said- just before they were impaled

Here is your lamb
Take me- take my heart, spill my blood

Save me now my god
Kill me- send my soul to the abyss

I'm prepared to live
With you- in hell forever and pay my sorrows

ritual of death

Mutilated - slain by their faith
Mass suicide - pay the price

I am the one- obey my words
The one who was- the one who'll be
I am the word- i am the flesh
I am the blood- the word made flesh

Believe in me- i am your saviour
The dark messiah- that brings the light
The light of day- the light of night
The light of souls- that fades in life

ritual of death

Now everybody...
