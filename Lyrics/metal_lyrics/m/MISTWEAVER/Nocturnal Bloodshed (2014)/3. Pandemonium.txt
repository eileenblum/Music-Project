Pandemonium

iÂ´ve been waiting for so long
for my time to come
the hour has arrived

followed by demons
and by evil creatures
now they will shrink for fear

ageless i am
and so my patience
my wrath increased through the centuries

a feeling of impotence
horror in their eyes
my kingdom has come

unbury the sinners and the martyrs
they shall seve under my domain
i will bring a new order
may my will be done

pandemonium is the place where i belong

ours in the glory
eternally from the living darkness
embraced by the cold night
whose beauty mesmerizes us all

your breath surrounds me
in this journey towards the infinity
towards my beloved home
pandemonium

forever pandemonium
my kingdom shall come
pandemonium
