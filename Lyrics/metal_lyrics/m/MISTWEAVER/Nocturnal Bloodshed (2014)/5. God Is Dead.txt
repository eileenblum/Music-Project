The dying embers of fire
are fading away
like day into night
on the sky in the horizon

lives were wasted
in a reign of ignorance
embittered by religion
from the cradle to the grave

helpless and alone
in the midle of nowhere
your destiny been taken
among prayers and cries

nothing is left
nothing will be
once you realize
youÂ´re alone

god is dead
Jesus cries his loss
the triumph of darkness
the day when hatred killed the light

an aimless existence
where will the sheep how go?
heavenÂ´s gates
are locked forevermore

there is no future
salvations gone
god is dead
the end is completed
