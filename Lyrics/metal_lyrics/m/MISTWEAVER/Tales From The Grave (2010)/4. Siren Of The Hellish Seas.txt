I cross the seas of destiny
In the darkest night
When the thunder strikes

Eternal hours of eternal pain
Endless oceans of fiends and rage

Departure is sad but i chose my way
To never return from the seas of hell

My eyes are blinded
By this frightening beauty
What will i do when the siren comes

Siren of the hellish seas
You've been time waiting for me
Now can't escape from you
Prisoner forevermore

Seduced by those songs
Mesmerized with that beauty
Paralyzed my heart
Hypnotized i stay
Siren of the hellish seas

Siren of the hellish seas
You've been time waiting for me
Now i can't escape from you
Prisoner forevermore

I descend into the depths of the ocean
Surrounded by creatures
I don't reach to see

Into a black well which leads to the abyss
There, i'll forever be
Siren of the hellish seas

Seduced by those songs
Mesmerized with that beauty
Paralyzed my heart
Hypnotized i stay
Siren of the hellish seas
