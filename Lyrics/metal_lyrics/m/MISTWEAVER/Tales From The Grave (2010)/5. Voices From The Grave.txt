Tormented souls
Never rest
Wandering in the mist
For all eternity

Sins not forgiven
A tragic death
Trying to return
From the grave

Manifestation
Through a new dimension
Bloody signs
In the night

Lights in the sky
The old cemetery
Where the last hopes
Are dead

From beyond the nothingness
From the realms of the dead
Hear the call
Voices from the grave

From beyond the nothingness
From the realms of the dead
Hear the voices
Voices from the grave

When the moon is full
And a cold wind blows
An eclipse will be formed
Then the spirits will gather

Forces from an unknown origin
Will reign over the earth
Submit to this power
Or die in vain

Voices....from the grave
Voices....from the dead

The time has come
Just hear the call
