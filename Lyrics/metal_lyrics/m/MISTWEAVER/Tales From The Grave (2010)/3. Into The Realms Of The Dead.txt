In the deep of the forest
Where no sunlight reaches the ground
A mournful scenery
Surrounded by demonic faces

Sinister eyes
Beholding their victims
Imaging the horrors
For the ones soon to be dead

Impure are the thoughts
That the cursed to their victims feel
But once in this realm
There is no turning back

Into the realms of the dead
Just the anteroom for the end

Judged for a life of evil and sins
A painful sorrow
You'd not believe in your dreams

This apocalypse before your eyes
No salvation for the wicked to die

Souls of black welcome you
To the endless journey through the past

Watching your life, your facts and faults
But now you are into the realms of the dead

Time to swear the oath
To obey the commandments
Swearing loyalty to the order
To the order of the dead

Give up your soul
To the ones that live in the darkness
Submit yourself
To the timeless force from beyond

Follow me and enter the door
To the hall of the soulless unborn
A life that never was
A certain death now awaits
