It's a long path
Through the warp
There's a light at the end
A shining white light

A strange state of mind
Unconsciousness and insomnia
Fading away

Through gate of timeless departure
Crossing the threshold of death
There's no fear, no regret
Now i'm dead

There's no fear, no regret
I may see a rainbow
My whole life in a moment
And voices calling

Falling into the infinity
Falling into the oblivion
May no one remember
May no tear fall for me

Through the gate of timeless departure
Crossing the threshold of death
There's no fear. no regret
Now i am dead

I now enter into the realm of the fallen
Crossing through the halls of despair
I feel beholded by the eyes of the tyrants
Of the ones who fell before me

So in silence with my head down
And my face looking at the ground
I go walking all alone to that light
I become undead

Through the gate of timeless departure

I've got my soul in my hands
Waiting for someone to pay me for it
Heaven or hell, peace or suffering
Do judge my life with justice in your hands

I am ready for burning
To consume my soul in the flames of hell
As my heart was black
I now burn in the sulphur of gehenna
