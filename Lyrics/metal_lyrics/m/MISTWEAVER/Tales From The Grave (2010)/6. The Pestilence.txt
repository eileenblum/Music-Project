Just close your eyes
It s time for mankind's fall
Into the abyss
Where the tortured souls dance

Blackened clouds
In a dark horizon
An aura of death
Coming enraged

It's the pestilence
A heaven' sent
To punish all mankind

Pestilence descends upon the land
Now it's time to praise your saviour
Of remembering those happy days
When your were alive

In horror diseased
No discrimination there will be
Awakening and waiting
For a certain death to come

Your god now has left you alone
Alone to die, alone to cry
The fears of your lives, fears to die
Face your fates now it's too late

Pestilence- suffering
Death- god s rage

In my dreams i had a vision
Of destruction and desolation
People dying, screaming in pain
Terrorized in fear and cries

Praying to a god that never existed
Alone and hopeless, their last agony
Last look at the sky, awaiting to die
Heaven will be yours tonight
