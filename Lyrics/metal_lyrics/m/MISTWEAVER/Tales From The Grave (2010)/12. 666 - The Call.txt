Since i was born
It was always with me
Deep into my heart
Six six six

The magic of that code
Was what i loved
In my dreams
Satan appeared

Revelations
In my dreams
Clear visions
Six six six

The force of the unnatural
Seduced me soon

Giving up to the power of darkness

Hungry for the secret delights
My mind was blind
So i crossed the line

Six six six
Six six six

The call from hell
Whispered my name
Now i go
I obey

Others before
Went to that realm
Where the silence
Breaks by cries

No place for wears
No place for liers
No place for lambs
Praying to their god

So my powers increased
I became an angel of sin
With strength i shout it loud
I am the one six six six
