Centuries of slavery
Lives were wasted
Justifying the death
With promises of a paradise

Blind faith in nothing
To nothing ever seen
Why do you pray
If you're just getting punished?

May god deliver death
Feel pleased with your fate
May god deliver death
You'll get death

Say our lord gave us all
Our lord cast all away
If his will is out to die
You're so night

Follow the light
The light of his heart
Fallow the path
The right hand path

May god deliver death
Feel pleased with your fate
May god deliver death
You'll get death

Open your eyes and realize
You're your own god, christ is forlorn
Destiny will come that's just a fact
Never waste your time praying to no one
