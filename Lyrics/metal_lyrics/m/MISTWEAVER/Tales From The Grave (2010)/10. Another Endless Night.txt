In a time of forbidden dreams
In a land where time once stood still
Legends are told by those ones
Who could survive to the night

When the sunset yielded to the dark
And the call of the darkness was hard
From the fields, risen with wrath
Another endless night to come

I left home many moons ago
Following the north star
With my sword and my horse
Just listening to my heart

My health is week
But my purpose is strong
I must go to the land where i'll die
To the land that once saw me born
I must go

Alone i ride in the distance
My silhouette makes out in the hills
Fading the horizon and sun
Reaching all the stars in the night

Sadness surrounds me forever
My life isn't worth anything
I'll dare my fate and i'll face the death
Now i will

Beast from the abyss confronts me
Sulphur breath soon you'll be dead

The seven headed snake died by my sword
The peace we all once dreamed with
Would never arrive

The magic of that age
Was carved in our minds
The fear we once felt will come again

But now i feel the snake is in me
I feel the rage and the evil inside
The only way is to kill myself
I take my sword and i insert it in my heart
