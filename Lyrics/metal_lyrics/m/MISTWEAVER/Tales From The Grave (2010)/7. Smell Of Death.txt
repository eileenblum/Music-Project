Buried alive
Into these walls
Trying to scream
None hear my words

I see only dark
Feel only fear
Soon the air will be over
Time to die will come

I want to escape
Try to scratch the wall
My nails turn into blood
I give up

I see only dark
Feel only fear
Soon the air will be over
Time to die will come

But my soul will never rest
One by one you all shall die
Returning from the darkness,
From the depths of hell
I'll kill you in your dreams,
Never sleep again

You'll feel a lack of air
And you'll soon be dead
I'll suffocate your souls
Say goodbye to the world

I see only dark
Feel only fear
Soon the air will be over
Time to die will come

But my soul will never rest
One by one you all shall die
Returning from the darkness,
From the depths of hell
I'll kill you in your dreams,
Never sleep again
