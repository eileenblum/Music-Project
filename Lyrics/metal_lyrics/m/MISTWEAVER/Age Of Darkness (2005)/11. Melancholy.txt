Freezing winds
In a painful dream
Where I stand alone
Waiting just for a sign

My face reflected
In the lake of time
I hope one day
I may reach the other shore

A dream nothing but a dream
A wish full of melancholy
Tears falling from my eyes
I just say goodbye

Mirror mirror on the wall
You once told me something
But now dreaming from this place
I may only cry

Freezing winds
In a painful dream
Where I stand alone
Waiting just for a sign

My face reflected
In the lake of time
I hope one day
I may reach the other shore

I hope one day

I may reach the other shore
