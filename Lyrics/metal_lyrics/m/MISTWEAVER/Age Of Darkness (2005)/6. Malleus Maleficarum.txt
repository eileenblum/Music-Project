Written in blood
A book of atrocities
Under the hand of the church
Innocents dying

Hammer of the witches
Malleus
Hammer of the witches
Maleficarum

Absurd questions
With any choice
Forced answers
Wishing to die

How did you become awitch?
Why did you decide to be one?
How much plague and pestilence have you created?

When did you get married to satan?
Where do you wear the mark of the devil?
How many children have you bewitched?

You are a witch
You have to die
Devil worshipper
Your presence poisons the air

You've denied christianity
You refused the words of god
It's too late, you have to burn
God will take pity on your soul
