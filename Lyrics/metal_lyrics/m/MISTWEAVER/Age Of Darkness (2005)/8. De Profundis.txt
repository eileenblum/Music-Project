De profundis clamavi ad te domine
Domine exaudi vocem meam

Lord hear my voice
My soul is free
I am prepared
To reign with you

Show me the path towards the black light
Teach me the secrets of the black arts
We'll dominate when darkness covers the earth
This is the coming of the one who once fell

Joining our forces our power increases
As the fear of the accusers that soon will be punished
We who are the bringers of darkness
We who bring hell to our enemies

Lord hear my voice
My soul is yours
Guide me now
Through the threshold of death

De profundis clamavi ad te domine
Domine exaudi vocem meam
De profundis clamavi ad te domine
And from the depths now I call your name

From the depths I have cried to thee o satan
Hear my voice

Let thine ears be attentive: unto the voice of my petition
If thou wilt observe iniquities o lord:
Lord who shall endure it?

From the depths I have cried to thee o satan
Hear my voice
