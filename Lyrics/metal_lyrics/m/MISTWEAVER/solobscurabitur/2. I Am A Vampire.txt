Blood- sign of life
A kind of living I always wished
Human sacrifice
To satisfy my intense need

Immortal- eternal youth
Marching the times but I'm here forever
Sleeping all day
To hunt a victim when the night falls

Darkness descends upon the earth
Hungry for blood I will attack
My jaws are arising your neck I will bite
Blood makes me hard in my solitude through centuries

I am a vampire
Living for all eternity but I'll always be damned
I am a vampire
Cruelty and pain- what I need to survive

Resting in my coffin
Waitting for the night
I'm hated for the mass
They want to hunt me

Protected with a crucifix
Garlics and holy water
They will come to me
With stakes in their hands

Darkness descends upon the earth
Hungry for blood I will attack
My jaws are arising your neck I will bite
Blood makes me hard in my solitude through centuries

I am a vampire
Living for all eternity but I'll always be damned
I am a vampire
Cruelty and pain- what I need to survive

Wolf- my eternal guardian
Will warn me so I will escape
It's hard to live always hidden
But it's the price I have to pay

Darkness descends upon the earth
Hungry for blood I will attack
My jaws are arising your neck I will bite
Blood makes me hard in my solitude through centuries

I am a vampire
Living for all eternity but I'll always be damned
I am a vampire
Cruelty and pain- what I need to survive
