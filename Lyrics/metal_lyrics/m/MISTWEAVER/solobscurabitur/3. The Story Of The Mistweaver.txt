If you listen I'll tell you a story
About things you'd not believe
About magic and strange lands
In a world beyond in time

Once upon there was a man
Who lived in a dark tower
At the top of a great mountain
At the end of a long path

When the sunset came each day
And the realms of the night got closer
All the living beings disappeared
They had to hide for cover

'Cause the man in the dark tower
To the depths of the earth invoqued
And with a pale and dense mist
Dominated the land to his will

A spell was cast and the gates of hell were open
Then the mist covered the realm
The man with his books, a wizard or just a fool
So he was called the mistweaver

Through the mist in the darkness
Many brave tried to cross
But the creatures of the damned
Made them go astray

In the morning of the next day
When the sun rays started to shine
Only their corpses remained
Their souls went with the mist

A spell was cast and the gates of hell were open
Then the mist covered the realm
The man with his books, a wizard or just a fool
So he was called the mistweaver

And sometimes in my dreams
I can hear him calling me
I see my soul wander in the mist
