Into the enchanted forest
Where time stops forever
Souls wander in the mist
Of the ancient warriors fallen

Walking through the mist
There're eyes beholding me
The black raven looks sinister
At the top of the dead tree

Skulls and broken bones
Hang all over the path
Every step a mortal trap
Don't know if I'll arrive alive

To the dark mountain
Where the dragon keeps the treasure
Obtained through centuries
Frightening the kingdom

I am into the enchanted forest
Misterious eternal place for spirits
Danger surrounds me every while
And death I feel it so near

Now in the night
The trolls are haunting gnomes
Torturing all the creatures
Plundering their nests

But they must be prepared
When the dawn enters again
Because the sun rays
Will become them to stone

Light shines far away
The elves are dinning there
They sing around the fire
Drinking to forget

If they are discovered
They fastly disappear
Because they are care
When the danger is near

I am into the enchanted forest
Misterious eternal place for spirits
Danger surrounds me every while
And death I feel it so near
