Afraid
In the night i hear those cries
Away
From a place drowned in silence

Don't go out tonight, beware
A shadow falls when you're out there

Afraid
In the night i hear those cries
Away
From a place drowned in silence

Coming from the dark
The reaper is back
With fear you'll cry
But now you'll die

The streets are cold and dark
A carriage's coming
The fog is dense and wet
Here comes the death

The time for suffering has arrived now
Remember those days when the pain was still away
As your blood is flowing, memories are going
You're just another victim, you're helpless and desperate

Die!!!

Take these grapes girl
Taste the fruit of the gods
Eat these grapes girl
And prepare to die

Blood...in the night
Blood...in the night
