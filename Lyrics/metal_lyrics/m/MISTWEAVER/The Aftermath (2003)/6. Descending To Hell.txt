I close my eyes and i descend
To a place where i've never been before

Full of fear and paralized
I try to escape but i can't

In my travel i see the end
And i see you dead
I see souls in regret
Suffering in pain
Screaming in vain

In the purgatory, where the not-bad lie
At the end is the hell, where you will burn

burn!!! Burn!!!

I want to wake up
I am linked to the world of the dead
And i cannot come back
'cause i am descending to hell
