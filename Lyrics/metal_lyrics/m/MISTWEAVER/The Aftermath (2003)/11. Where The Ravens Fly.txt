There's a place far away
Where the ravens fly
It's lost in time
Near the underworld gate

The light never shines there
Only darkness reigns
Lost souls seeking for deliverance
While they wander in pain

Follow me
I'll show you this place
Be prepared
'cause there's no return

Hear the voices
They are crying for us
See those views
See the seas of despair

When the night comes
We all shall gather beyond
Beyond the eternal refuge
Where the ravens fly

Whispering voices summoning our names
Resounding echoes torturing our heads
Evil eyes behold from above
Raven's domain controlling the lands

There's a place far away
Where the ravens fly
It's lost in time
Near the underworld gate

The light never shines there
Only darkness reigns
Lost souls seek for deliverance
While they wander in pain

Those ones who came never returned
Their souls are retained by the raven's will
Now they scream and scream but noone hears
No chance to hide where the ravens fly

Where the ravens fly

Share all your pains
Agony is an ecstasy
Empty out your brains
From where the ravens fly
You'll never return

You'll never return
