The time is coming
The final combat is near
Prepared to the last gathering
Only the strongest survives

Centuries have past
From the dawn of time we come
Condemned to live
Doomed to die

Days are passing, sunsets and dawns
Living the eternity, the future is locked
The world's moving around
Hopeless, alone, here we stand

We don't know when it all began
Don't know why were we chosen
The pain is growing inside
From this curse we cannot hide

Crusades and wars, the evolution was lost
And outbreak of chaos, mankind was foolish
Plagues, diseases and slaughters
Trapped- we couldn't die

But now the time has come
The swords are in our hands
Without pity we'll fight 'till death
Tonite you'll sleep in hell

"from the dawn of time we came, moving silently down through the centuries 
living many secret lives, struggling to reach the time of the gathering. 
When we few who remain will battle to the last. No one has ever known we 
were among you...until now"

Our wisdom is wide
Our eyes have seen things untold
Memories are kept in our hearts
To remember those years with pride

May we rest in peace
When deliverance come
The candle will fade
And our souls will be free
