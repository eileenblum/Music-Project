The news have been spread
The last dragon lies dead
A sword in its heart
And the end finally came

I still wonder
Why it had to die
Now the world is empty
With a lost eternal

The knight who killed the dragon
Victorious marchs
Proud of his fact
He laughts to the mass

He will be a hero
His glory will last forever
But the world now
Will submit into darkness

The dragon died and the legend began
Another story was told to remember
The minstrels sing what people want to hear
As the dragon died by the sword of the bravest knight

It's already too late
To repent of that death
Now the dragonslayer
Has no victim to kill

Sometimes i feel
That my heart is lost
Due to the lack
Of the dragon who filled my soul

The dragon died and the legend began
Another story was told to remember
The minstrels sing what people want to hear
As the dragon died by the sword of the bravest knight
