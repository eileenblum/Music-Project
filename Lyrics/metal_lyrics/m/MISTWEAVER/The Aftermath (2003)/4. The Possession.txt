Damned snake
Leave the daughter of god
Depart of her body
Go straight to hell

the possession

Hear my words
Obey my will
Show me your pressence
I order you now

the possession

Liar's your name
You blur with lies

As a sword i'll rip your heart 'till death
Your poisoned tongue i'll cut- blasphemous
I'll destroy your soul, you're weak- i'm strong
Your seeds won't last long time 'till perish

You are the bornless one
The morning star
The one who hates the light

Many names to name just one
One damned between all
Kind of beings
