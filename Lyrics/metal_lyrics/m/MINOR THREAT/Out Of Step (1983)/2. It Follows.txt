I thought I had left it behind
In another fucking time
When boys were boys, girls were girls
And faces were hard to find

IT FOLLOWED ME

All the stupid thinking
Stupid people thought
The rules that we lived by
The friends that we bought
The asshole with a strong arm
In the shape of floating friends
The young ladies and their secrets
In the soap that never ends

IT FOLLOWED ME

I thought I had outrun it
When I crossed the tracks
I thought I had gotten away
When it tapped me on the back

IT FOLLOWED ME
