How do you do?  I donât think that weâve met.
My name is Ian and Iâm from Minor Threat.
You know I tell them, usually, to be at their best.
Catch me in town after every set.  Yea, yea.

We donât care.  We donât pose.
Weâll steel your money.  Weâll steel your show.
I got your money and I feel fine.  
A couple of dollars and realy good time.
Well, you know Iâm gonna be alright
with the money Iâm making off of you tonight.  Sucker!
We donât care.  We donât pose.
Weâll steel your money.  Weâll steel your show.

Know something?  The problem with money is I want more.
Letâs raise the price tour.  Starting tonight, 3,000 or four.
Then weâll make a million when we go on tour.
Yeah, thatâs the way Iâm gonna think about it.  

We donât care.  We donât pose.
Weâll steel your money.  Weâll steel your show.
And thatâs the way it is, manâ¦Dog eat dog.  
Iâm taking a walk on the yellow brick road.
I only walk where the bricks are made of gold.
My mind and body are the only things that Iâve sold.
I needed the money cause Iâm getting old.
Right?  Thatâs the way it goes isnât it?  Yeaâ¦
We donât care.  We donât pose.
Weâll steel your money.  Weâll steel your show.
Yeah, we donât care.  We donât pose.
Weâll steel your money.  Weâll steal your show.
Thatâs the way it is in this world. 
Right?  Isnât that right?  Boyâ¦you had us pegged all alongâ¦damn.
Thereâs no place like home.  So, where am I?
