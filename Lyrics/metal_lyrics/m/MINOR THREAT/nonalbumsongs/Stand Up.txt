something's fucked up 
something's not right 
i came to have a good time 
you came to fight 
but if i do fight nothing to fear 
'cause i know my friends are here 
i don't like to fight 
i don't like getting hurt 
got my guard up state of alert 

something's fucked up 
something's not right 
i came to have a good time 
you came to fight 
but if i do fight nothing to fear 
'cause i know my friends are here 
i don't look for trouble trouble finds me 
needs my friends in an emergency 

something's fucked up 
something's not right 
i came to have a good time 
you came to fight 
but if i do fight nothing to fear 
'cause i know my friends are here 
don't go out alone go with a friend 
you might need him in the end 

something's fucked up 
something's not right 
i came to have a good time 
you came to fight 
but if i do fight nothing to fear 
'cause i know my friends are here 
stand up 
stand up 
stand up 
stand up and be counted
