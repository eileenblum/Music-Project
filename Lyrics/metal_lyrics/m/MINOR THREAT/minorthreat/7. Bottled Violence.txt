Get your bravery from a six pack
Get your bravery from a half-pint
Drink your whiskey, drink your grain
Bottoms up and you don't feel pain

GO OUT AND FIGHT, FIGHT
BOTTLED VIOLENCE

Lose control of your body
Beat the shit out of somebody
Half-shut eyes don't see who you hit
But you don't take any shit

GO OUT AND FIGHT, FIGHT
BOTTLED VIOLENCE
