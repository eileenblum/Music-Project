I don't want to hear it
All you do is talk about you
I don't want to hear it
'Cause I know that none of it's true
I don't want to hear it
Sick and tired of all your lies
I don't want to hear it
When are you gonna realize...

THAT I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT
KNOW THAT YOU'RE FULL OF SHIT

Shut your fucking mouth
I don't care what you say
You keep talking
Talking everyday
First you're telling stories
Then you're telling lies
When the fuck
Are you gonna realize

THAT I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT
KNOW THAT YOU'RE FULL OF SHIT
