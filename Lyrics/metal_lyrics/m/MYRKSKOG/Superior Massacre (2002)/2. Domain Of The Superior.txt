Die!
Die under the plague
Taste it as you suffer

You are forever haunted by the Beast
Never to escape from a certain Death
Massive killings by the One, judging you to die
Turn around and face the Beast

Fear!
Fear your Doom
Crumble in Agony
Accept and Die!!!

With cold blooded skinpeeled aggression
Comes forth a Storm of Terror
A supreme force, bringing you all down
To the final massacre

And the Domain of the Superior shall rise
Above the pile of a thousand murdered
