Like ice, no life
All soft
Stunned by its beauty
Coldness captures my mind
Dreams will be experienced!!

House of Pain, Sorrow
Can not affect me, only make me stronger
Liquids of Rage and Lust in my veins
As I enter the hall of Death

Unnaturally exited
Rigor mortis   a struggle!!
Disorderly impatient
No control   explode!
Indisposable Deaths
