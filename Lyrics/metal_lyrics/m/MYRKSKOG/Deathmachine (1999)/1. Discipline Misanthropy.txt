Staring through sonic glass walls, your view may seem distorted
Innovative destruction - Destructive creation
Discipline misanthropy - Arrogant turmoil
Discipline misanthropy - Master plan within
Take you down with me, you clean humanoid
Stain you!
Look at you - dirty - filthy
Low, down 'n fucking abhorrent piece of shit

Discipline misanthropy - Arrogant turmoil
Discipline misanthropy - Preservation of the elite
Discipline misanthropy - Observe machinery
Discipline misanthropy - Master plan within

Absorb the black liquid, as the stains will send off the beast

Error one - Man
Error two - Destruction of liquid
Error three - Glorifying the invisible

Strolling down devil's avenue 666
I long for satisfaction, I long for dedication
I long for determination, here is no salvation
Only extermination - Sin!
New breed - Misanthropic instinct supreme
Introduced to the world, in a Satanic audioscope
