I've drank 16 beers
and I'm ready so let's go
Don't look me in the eye
coz I'm likely to explode
I got a tattoo on my chest
that says fuck you
And a demon in my head
he's tellin me what to do

Coz I'm up all night
I got demons to fight c'mon
Coz I'm up all night
I got demons to fight

Haven't slept for days
it's the last thing that I want to do
Destruction is the only thing
that I'm keen to pursuit
A chicken lays an egg
outside my bedroom door
I smash it on my head
coz baby I'm ready let's go

Coz I'm up all night
I got demons to fight c'mon
Coz I'm up all night
I got demons to fight
Coz I'm up all night
I got demons to fight c'mon
Coz I'm up all night
I got demons to fight

I've drank 16 beers
and I'm ready so let's go
Don't look me in the eye
coz I'm likely to explode
I got a tattoo on my chest
that says fuck you
And a demon in my head
he's tellin me what to do

Coz I'm up all night
I got demons to fight c'mon
Coz I'm up all night
I got demons to fight
Coz I'm up all night
I got demons to fight c'mon
Coz I'm up all night
I got demons to fight

Coz I'm a danger to myself
Coz I'm a danger to myself
Coz I'm a danger to myself
Coz I'm a danger to myself
I'm thinking suicidal thoughts

Coz I'm up all night
I got demons to fight c'mon
Coz I'm up all night
I got demons to fight
Coz I'm up all night
I got demons to fight c'mon
Coz I'm up all night
I got demons to fight
