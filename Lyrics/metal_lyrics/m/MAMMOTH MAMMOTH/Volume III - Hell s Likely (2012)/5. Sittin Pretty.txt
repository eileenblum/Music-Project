Seems fittin' to me that
your sad so lonely,
To the enth degree,
You're a slow burner,

Seems a shame to me,
Now your lookin' so old,
Your desperate to stay young
But your youths been sold

Sittin' pretty,
Lifes a scene,
Sittin' pretty, lifes a dream,
Sittin pretty, lifes a test,
Sittin' pretty in life, death.

It's funny to me,
That your livin' so fast,
Your lifes a one way street,
Soon ya gonna crash

It's insane to see,
That you love feelin' so bad,
You like to push people round,
But you can't push me

Sittin' pretty,
Lifes a scene,
Sittin' pretty, lifes a dream,
Sittin pretty, lifes a test,
Sittin' pretty in life, death.
