Earth it opens up
Takin' me down low
To the valleys and beyond
The hate inside it grows
Clench these fists with fear
Won't be here tomorrow
Takin' me down
Takin' me down yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah...

Psychopathic
Psychopathic
Psychopathic
yeah, yeah, yeah...

Bare bones, bare bones
Psychopathic
Bare bones, bare bones
Psychopathic lido
Bare bones, bare bones
Psychopathic
Bare bones, bare bones
Psychopathic, yeah, yeah, yeah...

The mountains open up
Unicorn it dies
Satan spreads his wings
Looks me in the eye
Heart it turns to stone
This place is filled with sorrow
Takin' me down
Takin' me down yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah...

[Repeat Chorus]

Satan spreads his wings
The angels they all cry
The sky it turns to red
Bats they fill the sky
Bodies shed their skin
The noose will fall tomorrow
Takin' me down
Takin' me down yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah...
