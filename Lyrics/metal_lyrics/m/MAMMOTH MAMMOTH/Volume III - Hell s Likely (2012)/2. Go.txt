People say I'm a hopeless case
Always bouncin' from place to place
Every thought I think is a sin
Where the hell did this begin

C'mon I'm in a fight with my soul
It's hatin' me
C'mon, gotta take control
You gotta rescue me

My head is spinnin' I'm so confused
It's right or left now win or lose
Everything I had I've lost
It's time to win at every cost

C'mon I'm in a fight with my soul
It's hatin' me
C'mon, gotta take control
You gotta rescue me

Coz I'm ready go
I'm ready go
I'm ready go
I'm ready go
I'm in a fight with my soul

Coz I'm ready go
I'm ready go
I'm ready go
I'm ready go
I'm in a fight with my soul
