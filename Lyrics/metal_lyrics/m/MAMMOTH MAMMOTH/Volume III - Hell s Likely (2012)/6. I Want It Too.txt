Lovin' me, lovin' you
Lovin' me coz I want it too
Hatin' me, hatin you
Hatin' me coz I want it,
I want it too, I want it too
Yeah I want it to
I want it too
I want it, want it

The only thing that I need is a friend
A friend to be there to the very end
Someone to help me turn my shit around
Give me a smile instead of a frown
Someone who likes me just the way that I am
Tell me when I got my head in the sand
Pick me up when I've fallen down
Pick me up coz I want it, I want it too
I want it too
Yeah I want it too
I want it too,
I want it, want it

Lovin' me, lovin' you
Lovin' me coz I want it too
Hatin' me, hatin you
Hatin' me coz I want it,
I want it too, I want it too
Yeah I want it to
I want it too
I want it, want it

Be there as my friend
Be there till the very end...
