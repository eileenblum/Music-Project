My life is messed up
My heads filled with hate
I'm ditchin' this city baby
I'm shuttin' the gate
My foots flat to the floor
Full steam ahead
Death starin' me in the face man
I'm comin' prepared yeah

Hells likely, Hells likely
Hells likely, Hells likely

My life is messed up
Journeys just begun
Sweet smell is fillin' my lungs from
This smoking gun
Lights are flashin' in my eyes
It's full steam ahead
Death starin' me in the face man
I'm comin' prepared yeah

Hells likely, Hells likely
Hells likely, Hells likely

My life is messed up
My heads filled with hate
I'm ditchin' this city baby
I'm shuttin' the gate
My foots flat to the floor
Full steam ahead
Death starin' me in the face man
I'm comin' prepared yeah

Hells likely, Hells likely
Hells likely, Hells likely
Hells likely, Hells likely
Hells likely, Hells likely
Hells likely
