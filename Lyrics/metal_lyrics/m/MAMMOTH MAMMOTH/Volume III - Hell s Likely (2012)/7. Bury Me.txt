I'm hitchin'
Cross bridges,
Lifes a journey
Where do I begin,
I'm lovin'
Not knowin'
Bodies cursed,
I'm full of sin,

C'mon and bury me,
C'mon set my love free yeah,
C'mon and bury me,
C'mon my yeah!

Cross bridges, my sin,
Cross bridges of my deceit,
I'm loaded, my test,
My love is yeah!

C'mon and bury me,
C'mon set my love free yeah,
C'mon and bury me,
C'mon my yeah!

Television frequencies,
Television sets the scene,
I'm hatin' seven seas,
I'm the sinner, set me free!

C'mon and bury me,
C'mon set my love free yeah,
C'mon and bury me,
C'mon my yeah!

My indecision is my lifes disease,
It's mocking my love, set me free,
C'mon and bury me,
C'mon and bury me,
C'mon set my love free yeah,
C'mon and bury me,
C'mon my yeah!
