Lockdown
Got a feeling that you're messing around
And I'm head down
Close my eyes and not make a sound

So I rock round
Got a feeling that you're moving around
My head's spinning round in the city

Spellbound, spellbound, yeah
I don't care
Spellbound, spellbound, yeah

Go!

Helldound
Got a feeling that you're fooling around
'cause I'm head down
Keep it quiet, don't make a sound

I'm in lockdown
Wanna run but I'm bolted down
It's a let down in the city

Spellbound, spellbound, yeah
I don't care
Spellbound, spellbound, yeah

Spellbound, spellbound, yeah
I don't care
Spellbound, spellbound, yeah
