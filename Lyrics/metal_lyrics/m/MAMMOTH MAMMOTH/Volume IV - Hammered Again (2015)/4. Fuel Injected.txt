I was born to hate
And hate to feel
My life's never complete;
I've had ___ won and lost
But I can never be beat;

I keep a knife in the heel of my boots
You never know who's round;
I can use it in the blink of an eye, man
So don't you mess me 'round

'Cause I'm a fuel-injected suicide machine
And I'm built for speed;
A fuel-injected suicide machine
Speed's what I need;
Yeah!

I eat angel dust for breakfast
And then I microwave the cat;
No better way
To start the day
I can tell you that;

The hangman's loose on my rear-view
To remind me what to be;
One day it'll be 'round my neck, man
And then I'll finally be free

'Cause I'm a fuel-injected suicide machine
And I'm built for speed;
A fuel-injected suicide machine
Speed's what I need;
Yeah!

[Solo]

I live life top-speed
I like to bleed
It makes me feel alive;
I grew up tough
My life was rough
I had to fight to survive;

Drink a bottle a day
Keeps the demons away
I stay awake for days;
Locked in my room
With a brick and a spoon
Can't see myself through the heat;

'Cause I'm a fuel-injected suicide machine
And I'm built for speed;
A fuel-injected suicide machine
Speed's what I need;
Yeah, come on!

A fuel-injected suicide machine [4x]
Now come on!
