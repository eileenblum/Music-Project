It's time to celebrate it
The things I said to you
No need to overstate it
But dreams they can come true

I'm gonna hold your hand
I'm gonna dig that sand
It's time to bury you
And hide that old tattoo

Life's a bitch and then you die [8x]

Yeah

No time to celebrate it
Just gonna walk on through
Gonna try to sedate it
And what I felt for you

Good times now gone bad
Worst time I ever had
What did I see in you
Just left with a shit tattoo

Life's a bitch and then you die [8x]

Yeah

Life's a bitch and then you die [8x]
