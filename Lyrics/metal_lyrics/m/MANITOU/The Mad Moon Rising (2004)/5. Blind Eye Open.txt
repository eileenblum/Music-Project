There's nothing you can do
They are watching you
Your every single move written in black book
The shapes of a demon
Glimpse of death in his eyes
Your blind eye open
You can't see, you can't cry

Faceless figures
Makes you feel insane
Sweat fills your bed
To be alive is your pain

Wonderful dreams of night?
There is a beast inside
To rip all emotions
Wonderful dreams of night?
There is an angel inside
To fill all emotions

Voices telling you, it's your time to die
You want to go with them but devil's word is a lie?
Both tunnels open
Demon and angel pointing at you
Desperate both of them
They want your soul, nothing more
