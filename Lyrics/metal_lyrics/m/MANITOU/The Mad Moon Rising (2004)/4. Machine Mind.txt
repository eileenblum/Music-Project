These walls of thoughts, so strong and high
A war that just won't wait
Do I live tomorrow? Will I care tomorrow?
My poisoned veins full of hate

I'd like to give you mercy
But the trigger don't feel the same
I'd like to call myself a soldier
But the battle is so insane

These paths through the canvas of colors
I don't see outside of my machine mind
Do I kill tomorrow? A war that just won't wait

You warned me, war is all your soul can eat
Soldier, war is not end to breath
You warned me, until their bullets feeding you
Soldier, mission is not complete

Shooting around, my target was found
No time to waste, I have been faced
Chance to kill or chance to die
My path is clear. Is my mind free to fly?
