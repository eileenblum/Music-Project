So long as the sun will shine
And water is running wild
This land will be here
To give life for me
To give life for animals and an human being

We can't sell our lives
We can't sell our lands
The great spirit set it here
It don't belong to anyone
You may count your money
And burn them right here
As quick as the warrior kills the whiteman's chief

Ancestral lands, those what were taken from our hands
Way ended, fertile areas were raped and burned
Ancestral lands, those what were taken from our hands
Way ended, Some tribes surrendered
Vengeance is all they need

Take all what you can take
That's what we can give
But this land will be here
From here to eternity
