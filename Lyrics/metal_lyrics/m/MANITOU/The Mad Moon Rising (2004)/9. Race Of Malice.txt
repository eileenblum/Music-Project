The virus pollutes the land
Strange fever spreading around
Blood is smearing the sand
The agony kills survivors

All the life form dies
Faith in "God" it's honor to die
Fierce determination
Formation of greed and fame
Dreams are fading away
Faces of peace are burning in hell
The strong form of evil
Free in a world of lies

Weapons, wise and fair
Biochemical hunting for white trash
The end justifies the means
Terror, it's path to the darkside

Flying on the wings of fire
Spreading death with blast of toxin...
The race of malice, the race of malice
