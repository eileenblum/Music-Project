I race through the time
And when I die what will be left of me?
Am I the only one? Only one to take the blame?
The lie was mine, I played my game
I risk it all...
And I lost and still they make hero of my name
The lie was mine, I played my game
I risk it all...

I tried to fight the snake inside
I tried to keep it down
But in the end surrendered to my fears
I cannot hide much longer that I'm not what they believed
The shadow that I am will disappear...

I'm the shadow
I once believed in drifting shadow of night
