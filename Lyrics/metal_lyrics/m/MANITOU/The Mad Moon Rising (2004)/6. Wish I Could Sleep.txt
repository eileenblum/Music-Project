I paint myself with the tiger stripes
To keep the foe at the bay
It doesn't trick the snake
I cannot win

I hate to be so helpless
But the darkness breaks my will
Wish I could sleep but the fear keeps me awake

Wish I could sleep but the fear keeps me awake

To kill the beast I cut them down
To mask the hate with a pain
It cannot hurt the enemy within
