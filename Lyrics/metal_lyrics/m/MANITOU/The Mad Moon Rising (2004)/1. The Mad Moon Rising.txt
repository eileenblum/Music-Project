I walk on the water
Wide open sky above
The moon and the crystal stars farewell I call the sun
Beneath the sky shall be my bed
Shadows fall, daylight dies
Souls of abyss are sleeping
Now I walk on the water

The Mad Moon is rising, the last one I can see
Hand on heart I fall, to the darkest bed of sea

Last breath of air, I fall apart
My body struggles one more time
Gentle feeling lays on me
Fearless eyes stare without pain

Hidden in shadows the beast is coming
Raven black hair, fire in the eyes
Soft light above me, face of an angel
I'm numb, I can't move
Will they fight for me?
