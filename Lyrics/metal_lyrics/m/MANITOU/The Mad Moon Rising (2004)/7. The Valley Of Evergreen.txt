Behind the forest there's a valley
Where ice touch and snow won't fall
In the valley there's a village
Made of stone, now dead and cold

Many years ago summer was more than just a dream
Many years ago the world was alive and sun was shining bright

In the Valley of Evergreen

In the village there's a pillar
Made of stone, two houses tall

One fine day they took it all away...
One fine summer's day

On the pillar there's a raven
Summer's symbol, black and cold
