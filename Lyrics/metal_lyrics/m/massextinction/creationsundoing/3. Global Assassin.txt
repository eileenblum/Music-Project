Bombings through the cites of these nations afar
It seems the fate of this world is condemned
If history has proven anything, it's self-annihilation
Is the means that will lead to our end

Drastic measures for desperate times
Provoking the will to resist
Offensive alliance forged with contempt
For fellow mans right to exist

MATRICIDE we've leeched life's blood before it's time
DESECRATION the end all be all of mankind
Raised to worship ARCHAIC BELIEF
Unconditional faith in false deities
Divine praise? or ICONIC DEMANDS?
Succumb to the poison of God-fearing man

Driven beyond nihilistic obsession
Into realms of lunacy's reign
Fanatic oppressors devoting lives
To goals they can never attain

Brainwashed, the fumbling herd
With the fear of eternal damnation
Religion has caused more than cured through the ages
It is a blight on the fields of creation

MATRICIDE we've leeched life's blood before it's time
DESECRATION the end all be all of mankind
Raised to worship ARCHAIC BELIEF
Unconditional faith in false deities
Divine praise? or ICONIC DEMANDS?
Succumb to the poison of God-fearing man

The Global Assassin

[Lead trade-offs - Adam, Brian, Adam, Brian]

Shards of misguidance sever the fabric of rational minds
Blind to the terror this credence has caused
Through the annals of time

Fall to submission at the mercy of confrontational hordes
Then trawl through the wreckage
Of social ruins from ethnic discord

And so it has begun, our undoing is upon us
The twilight of life now descends
A feeble existence stricken from the Earth
That birthed the infection of Man

Parasites, we've ravaged our host
Resources are all but consumed
A mortal eclipse shall blacken forever
Eternally sealing us into our tomb

MATRICIDE we've leeched life's blood before it's time
DESECRATION the end all be all of mankind
Raised to worship ARCHAIC BELIEF
Unconditional faith in false deities
Divine praise? or ICONIC DEMANDS?
Succumb to the poison of a God-fearing
