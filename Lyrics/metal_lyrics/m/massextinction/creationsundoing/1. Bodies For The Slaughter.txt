Storm the beach at first light as daybreak scrapes the sky
Navy boats crash through the waves, backup troops deploy
Fallen soldiers writhe in pain pleading for the kin
As a hurricane of shrapnel carves its name into their skin

Legionnaires of butchery march into this abattoir
Blinded by their loyalty
Prepared to die on foreign shores

None will survive...bodies for the slaughter

The premonition of an elder war
Moving pawns under their thumbs
Generals pause to strategise, they are patriarchs of scum
Skilled in arts of conflict, waging wars without regret
Executive decisions send the infantry to death

Legionnaires of butchery march into this abattoir
Blinded by their loyalty
Prepared to die on foreign shores

None will survive...bodies for the slaughter

[Lead - Brian]
[Lead - Adam]

Torn to shreds by machine-gun fire...another massacre
Soldiers fall like empty shells in heaps of human fodder
Artillery takes out every foe, they follow their command
A hail of bullets wash away dead bodies in the sand

Legionnaires of butchery march into this abattoir
Blinded by their loyalty
Prepared to die on foreign shores

None will survive...bodies for the slaughter
None will survive...bodies for the slaughter
