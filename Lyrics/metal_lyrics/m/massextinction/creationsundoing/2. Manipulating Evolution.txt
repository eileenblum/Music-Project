Contorting form the anatomical structure
Prone to disease and destined to fall
A lesson to learn, we're far from immortal
The Lazarus quest must grind to a halt

Self righteous abuse of all things living
Has led to a time of immolation
Don't look to the skies with the hope of salvation
Rest assured it is not there to be found

FORCING LIFE Through shattered molds
Altering flesh for the greater good?
MANIPULATE, CAUSE AND EFFECT
We are left with no choice but to try

Process the flesh to revive this existence

Or cower beneath your hands
Worship the idols and prophets you choose
Fools you'll be made when all martyrs dissolve
Ideals so brittle they crumble to dust

Trials of endurance have set us a purpose
The foresight of self preservation
Savor this moment for as long as it lasts
As the darkest of times are coming to pass

FORCING LIFE Through shattered molds
Altering flesh for the greater good?
MANIPULATE, EVOLUTION
Survival is the product of life!

[Lead - Adam]
[Lead - Brian]

Defiantly toil with the burden within
Forgotten belief in deities unseen
Controlling appearance eternally scarred
Adapt through new flesh as ours has been marred

Organic, synthetic the meld into one
Erasing the flaws of nature's design
Splicing, corrupting molecular construction
Reduced to mere beings of function and form

MANIPULATE, EVOLUTION
Survival is the product of life!
Process the flesh to revive this existence or cower!
