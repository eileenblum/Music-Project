Three simple rules
Preach our faith
Stay within bounds
Obey the book
Obey
You are not capable of understanding his design
Godâs plan is not yours to render
You will think differently when you stand before him on judgment day
Weâll pray for you

You will watch me tear open the sky
You are helpless against my foresight
I am not a pawn in someone elseâs plan
I am a force youâre a fool to reprimand

UGH

I only grew without you
Without your god
Finally Iâm free
Watch me survive on my own
I will be stronger alone

Fuck your code!
If I regret
At least I self-reflect

Fuck your code!
If I regret
At least I self-reflect

Blind to true fate, your life is a waste!
Blind to true fate, your life is a waste!
Blind to true fate, your life is a waste!

I am awake
I am awake
I am awake
Imagined men canât own my life
