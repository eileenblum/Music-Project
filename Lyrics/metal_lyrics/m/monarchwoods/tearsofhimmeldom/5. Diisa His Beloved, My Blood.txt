I know itâs not my place to ask every question
I know I canât search every avenue
But a part of me canât stand by and sting
When no one else is bleeding

And still my biggest fear is letting go
And still my biggest fear is letting go

I know itâs not my fault that sheâs missing
I know I canât blame this commune
But a part of me canât sit quietly
When no one else is speaking

And still my biggest fear is letting go
And still my biggest fear is letting go

I have to let go

I will search the world for you
I will search the world for you

I know itâs not my job to save her
I know I canât do this alone
But a part of me canât abide by uncertainty
When her lifeâs on the line

And still my biggest fear is letting go [4x]
