Lady Mother, let me soak your wings
Lay your head down
Let your children weep
For we love you and thereâs no greater pain
Than not being able to see you again

Lady Mother, can you hear them sing?
Lay your head down, let your children weep
For we love you and thereâs no greater pain
Than not being able to see you again
