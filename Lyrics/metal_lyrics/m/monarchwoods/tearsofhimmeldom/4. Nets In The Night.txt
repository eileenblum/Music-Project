In the night, stitched cages drape the stars, destroying art
A string of death chokes elegance
Defiling a tribute to flawlessness

We are the cloudâs hidden treasure
The netters search to trap

Where are your courtesies?
Have you no shame?
Your princess is lost
These dreadful tales
Could be the death of Queens

You who would ignore these nets in the night
Youâre lucky that you are secure from their sight
Everyone else needs to hear the truth
The likes of us, ten to one, outnumber you

We are the treasure
They hunt to bind
We are the treasure
They hunt to bind

We are the treasure
They hunt to bind
You are the treasure
They hunt to bind

In the night,
Laces wait in the dark, disfiguring hearts
A curse of sin erases origin
Collapsing a sculpture of eminence

Webs in the sky
Drain wings dry
Crates of hex
Seize happiness,
Webs in the sky
Drain wings dry
Crates of hex
Seize happiness!

Where are your courtesies?
Remember your place
Your princess is lost
These dreadful tales
Are aiding our misery

Where are your courtesies?
Iâm commanding you
Your princess is lost
These dreadful tales
Are no comfort to me!

We are the treasure
They hunt to bind
We are the treasure
They hunt to bind
You are the treasure
They hunt to bind
You are the treasure
They hunt to bind
