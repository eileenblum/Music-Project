The blueprints in my mind,
Rapidly coming to life,
I built paradise from dirt and blood
I am steel in the breeze
I built paradise from dirt and blood
I am storm on the sea
I built paradise from dirt and blood
I am the god of kings

Stealing her womb formed the roots of our trees
Blood in her veins painted my masterpiece
Her demise contained in statues of Queens
She meant everything to me

Himmeldom rises as Ophesa falls
Himmeldom rises as Ophesa falls
