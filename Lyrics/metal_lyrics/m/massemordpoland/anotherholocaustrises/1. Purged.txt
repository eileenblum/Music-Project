Adorating beauty of face congealed in pain
Pain of being torn within
Delighting young skin humiliated brutally
Fucked in an act of carnal love
Blood shed upon thighs
Harmonic to tears moistening ground
Deformed submissivness figure
Hardly conformable to the doubtful attraction

Feel what this pain is for
Taste where this pain is coming from
Bitten from inside
Plunging into your juices
Plunging measurelessly
Purging all your juices
Purging from innocence

Powerless, harmless, defenceless
Seconds turned to decades
Disfigured by blade of humility
Marked with immortal filth
No sorry for collapse of all of your dreams
And carved in every seed
My orgasm remembrance
And carved in every ecstasic sigh
Your yell of pain while fucking you that night

Reflection of filth overfilling you
Reflection of filth digesting you
Uncleanable
