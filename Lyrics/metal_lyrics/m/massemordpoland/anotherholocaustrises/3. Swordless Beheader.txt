Glorious and triumphant, ineffable in strenght
Defying the power hold in a flesh
Eternally denslaved though not by death
Bruises decorates scars, reopened constantly
Raising new icons in this temple of agony
Paralysed by pain deafening thoughts
Copulating with death

Without sword, with single move beheading
Armourless, resistant for every spear
One of us
He is dying, dying like we

The self-mutilated messiah
Revelating new gospel to the earth
New heavens for strong enough
To kill within a man
The mental tormentor, tormented himself
Encrowned by human screams
Killing thousands of martyrs
Forgotten before nailed

Dying like others
But making death his own strenght
