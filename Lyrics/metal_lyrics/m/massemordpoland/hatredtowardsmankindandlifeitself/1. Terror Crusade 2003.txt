Every single human is my enemy on battlefield called my life
So breed, breed constantly - more people I'll have to kill!
Finally I understood what does it mean to live for someone without profits
Every single morning I wake up willingly to begin my crusade of hate

Terrorcrusade in my hateful mind,
Quintessence of hate towards human kind

I hate you so much I regret I can't hate you more
So lively inside, hatred keeps me alive
Hatred above all, my spirit manifesto

Now I'm staring at you from level you will never reach
Screaming how I love you and how I wish you're dead
The more you love me the stronger is my hate
The one which can't be stronger, then am I the most adorable???
I wish you were dead; I wish you were all fucking dead

Terrorcrusade in my hateful mind,
Quintessence of hate towards human kind
Black metal strike, crushing this worlds laws
Masshatred's rise with terror it has caused
You made me what I am so soon you shall pay

Czy slyszycie me psalmy nienawisci? nie zatrzymacie mnie!

Can you all give, as much I want to take
Can you withstand the rising of my hate?
This day is the day; beginning of our crusade
I hate you so much I regret I could hate you more
