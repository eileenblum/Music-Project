The mundanus armageddon is about to be unleashed
By sign from above within mind of the jester pawn

Your world built with such passion shall collapse within blink of the eye
Your thirst filled by torrent of life shall again be broken out
Left with obsession of cyanide only not too weary to commit suicide

Screaming in anguish, mutilated by irony of this entertainment you named life
Again on your knees bowing before the supreme trickster named naivly god
Are you going to reach for sword and become fooler that you really are
Or in coldness of blade you'll hide yourself prooving that your life was so far?

Not so long ago you humiliated every god not so long ago you conquered all their thrones
You were more dignified then all elderly men of all gospels and apocryphal rites
Not so long ago you threathened the sun diverted darkness and light
Now deplorably screaming to stars now deplorably bleeding all scars
History made a circle
Yet, I shall stand

And cursed shall be thee - you made me what I am
And cursed shall be thy breath - so soon you shall pay

Is there any sense to withstand that painfully rise up to fall once again
Is there any sense to heal your wounds conceal scars which are about to bleed again

Now deplorably screaming to stars
Now deplorably bleeding all scars
