Torments of the earth always seemed to little for me
Human scream far to silent
The sea of blood I sailed through honourly
Became a one single sip
WarToCome

And blade still too clean, my delight inherently miserable
Hatred towards mankind displayed impotently
Hunger for pain insatiable

I am the roar of beasts of war
I am hidden wrath of bayonet stabbed in chest
I am the greed of the rape
Executed child superfluous death

Kneel before me every siren sound
Kneel before me every thousand's fall
Kneel, every bullet tearing a brain
Kneel, every outbreak of terror bringing me fame

I am the roar of beasts of war
I am hidden wrath of bayonet stabbed in chest
I am the greed of the rape
Executed child superfluous death
