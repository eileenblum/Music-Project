[Carpathian Forest cover]

Come on dead man
You have slit your wrist
Bow down dead man
And slit your wrist again
Cut!!! Cut!!!

Razorblade baby
Kill yourself girl
You Christian women
You can't live like this
No!!! No!!!

He's flung high, he's flung low
But he still loves the purgatory glow
This long road leads to you
Feel the anger feel the rush
Search your heart
And get out before all heaven breaks loose
The blood hunger
The addiction
Night, cold night
The stars are not lit tonight

Ice bound river banks
Cold murky waters
The treacherous devilry
Coldest thoughts
Suicide!!!

The blood hunger
The addiction
Night cold night
Suicide!!!
Suicide!!!
