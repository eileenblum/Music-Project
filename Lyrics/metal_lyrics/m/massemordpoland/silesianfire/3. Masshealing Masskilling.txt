When you stare at me I see you hanging flesh
I see thousands of you torn asunder every time
Everything what you built I see as target to attack
Cause I'm in love with you my beloved human race
Your beautiful faces expressing how it hurts
Everytime when I rape your daughter
Your beautiful faces expressing how it hurts
Always while I drill her cunt

I want to see you dead
Your smile feed my anger
I want to see you dead
Your laughter prepares my avenge
Bloodspilling Masskilling

When you stare at me I see you mutilated
By hatred that is fed with your sympathy
I want to see you dead
Your smile feed my anger
I want to see you dead
Your laughter prepares my avenge

When you stare at me I see you hanging flesh
I see thousands of you torn asunder every time
Everything what you built I see as target to attack
Cause I'm in love with you my beloved human race
Fuck you all
