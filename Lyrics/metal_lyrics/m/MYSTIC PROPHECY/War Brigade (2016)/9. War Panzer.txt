Steeling monsters comes out to fight
Crawling death trough the haze of the blackened night
Fighting in the name of dead of the holy land
We are the signs of violence
For the war forever condemned
We are the death in silence
Fight and kill, like to the end.

Lightning strikes over the hills
Ready to fight... ready to kill
Heroes of eternity
Damned forever to be free
War-Panzer
War-Panzer
Ready to strike
War-Panzer.

No more return
In hell you will burn
The dead is the price and the devil will roll the dice
We are the signs of violence
For the war, forever condemned
We are the death in silence
Fight and kill like to the end.

Lightning strikes over the hills
Ready to fight... ready to kill
Heroes of eternity
Damned forever to be free
War-Panzer
War-Panzer
Ready to strike
War-Panzer
This is a War-Panzer
War-Panzer
Ready to fight
War-Panzer...
