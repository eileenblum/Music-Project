Screaming out your evil names
Millions of souls are lost
In the battlefield of deadly games
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Kingdom of eternity
The faith forever lost.

Millions of craves the signs
The sickened crim of history
All hope forever lost... The holocaust!!!

War of lies, apocalyptic dust fill the skies
War of lies, war... Damnation is the price
War of lies, silhouettes of death will deny
War of lies, governments of evil in disguise.

Never forgive and nover forget
Don't raised the flag of hate again
Against the nations that you made.
