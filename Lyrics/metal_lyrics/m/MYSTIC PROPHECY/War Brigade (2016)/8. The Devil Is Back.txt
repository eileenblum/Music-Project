My blood your blood
Despise my soul to god
You saints... You sinners
No matter no more wiiner
Blackened angels wild and free
His blood zero degree
RIP and kill with sword and steel
With godless destiny
Don't look in his eyes... There is no god
Armored and ready... For the final attack!

The devil is back... Yes, back
The dead... no more illusions
The devil is back... For attack
He brings death and confusion
The devils is back... Back in track
He fights for retribution.

The devil is back
Angel in black...
Never look back
The devil is back.

3-2-1 the bloodbath done
The dogs of hell arise
Baptized in blood the chosen one
The devil in desguise.

The devil is back... Yes, back
The dead... no more illusions
The devil is back... For attack
He brings death and confusion
The devils is back... Back in track
He fights for retribution.

The devil is back
Angel in black...
Never look back
The devil is back.
