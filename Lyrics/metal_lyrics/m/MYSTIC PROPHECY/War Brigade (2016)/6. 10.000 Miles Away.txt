10.000 miles away
10.000 words day by day
You are the sunshine in my life
In the rain alone I stay
Your sweet voice on my record plays
One smile enough to make my day
I know it's time to come back home
I feel so empty so alone
The yearning deep inside of me
My sorrow will be free.

10.000 miles away
Please forgive me... Don't release me
For me a brand new day
My view to find my way
10.000 miles away... Don't forget me
Don't forsake me
10.000 lonely days...
Yes!! Now it's time for me to come back home.

All the days I remember
All the times has been together
Your love surrounding me
Yes!! Surrounding me
In deine trÃ¤ume komm und trag dich
Glaub mir im dunkel is kein licht
Im dunkel ist kein licht
Glaub mir ich vermisse dich.

10.000 miles away
Please forgive me... Don't release me
For me a brand new day
My view to find my way
10.000 miles away... Don't forget me
Don't forsake me
10.000 lonely days...
Yes!! Now it's time for me to come back home.
