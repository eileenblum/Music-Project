Tell me the truth
What can we do
The future is dead for you
Don't follow the blind
Infected your mind
One nation in grind
The crime against humanity
Like serpents wait to bite
The architects of war is here
Disaster rule the night
Stand up and fight
Fight for your right.

Follow the blind
The desperation of lies
Infected your mind
Follow the blind
Between in heaven and hell
(the answer you find)
Beware
Follow the blind

Look in his eyes
Don't sacrifice
His hearts are cold as ice
The warlord of war
Want more and more
Rotten to the core
Don't believe his fucking thoughts
Disgrace shit on TV
Suicide society... His on eulogy
Betray... Decay... Democracy.

Follow the blind
The desperation of lies
Infected your mind
Follow the blind
Between in heaven and hell
(the answer you find)
Beware
Follow the blind.
