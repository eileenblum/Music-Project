Scream out...
Your consequence pretend
The sickness of religion is the temple of the dead
Rise out...
The violence in your hands
Suicide solution for the promise land.

So many dreams and illusions in pain
Drowning in blood... Dead again.

Burning out, illusions in my head
Burning out, tomorrow i'll be dead
Burning out
Extermination
Isolation
Mass confusion
Self destruction,
No more way out
Burning out.

Rise up... Burn down the flag of hate
Annihilate the monsters that you alone create
Burn out... the number on your hands
Saint and sinners are the governments of dead.

Burning out, illusions in my head
Burning out, tomorrow i'll be dead
Burning out
Extermination
Isolation
Mass confusion
Self destruction,
No more way out
Burning out.
