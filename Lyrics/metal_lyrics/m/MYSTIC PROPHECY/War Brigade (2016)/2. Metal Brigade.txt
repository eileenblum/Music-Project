Can you feel the fire
Can you fell the flame in your heart
Black magic desire
Heavy metal... The sound by your side
Restless and wild like a thunder in the sky
Like a eagle on a stormwind we'll fly
Never let go... Never running away
For the metal we stay!

We are... The flame and the fire
We are... Not lions in cage
We are... The hellfire in metal we made
We are... The metal brigade.

The number of the beast
Sick and destroy
Unleashed in the east
With Ozzy and Paranoid
And justice for all
Reign in blood
Heeding the call
Rob Halford the metalgod.

We're scream out loud like a thunder in the sky
For the metal we die!!

We are... The flame and the fire
We are... Not lions in cage
We are... The hellfire in metal we made
We are... The metal brigade.

The number of the beast
Sick and destroy
Unleashed in the east
With Ozzy and Paranoid
And justice for all
Reign in blood
Heeding the call
Rob Halford the metalgod.
