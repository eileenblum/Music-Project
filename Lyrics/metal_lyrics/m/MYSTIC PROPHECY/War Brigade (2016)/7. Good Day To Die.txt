The day to die can wait
The enemies have to burn
No mercy... No more pain
The war machine brings suffering
Will defend for the motherland
300 have to sent
Kill... Destroy... In blood descend
Without remorse and no repent.

Let start begin the mass, Ytan I epitas
His bones now burning to dust

Good day to die!!!
We rise from the ashes
Like thunder in the sky
We fighting for freedom
It's a good day to dies!!!
We march over mountains
Like a eagle we fly
The world set on fire
It's a good day to die!!!

Hell brigade come to desvastate
From this hell no more escape
Vengeance!! Take with the blade
In blood they drown and suffocate.
