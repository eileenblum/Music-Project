Welcome my friend
In my blackened land
Where blood is forzen
And souls are bent
Look in my eyes
I'm dead inside
Welcome to my world
The black in mind.

Inside the demon you never survive
Inside the demon you never decide.

Pray for hell
Summoning the demon
Under the altar of the evil spell
Made in hell
Haunting the evil
Unleashed the beast from the book of dead.

Don't be afraid and come and see
Gimme your hand
Welcome to my atrocity
I'm the lucifer by your side
The monster demon in your mind.

Inside the demon you never survive
Inside the demon you never decide.

Pray for hell
Summoning the demon
Under the altar of the evil spell
Made in hell
Haunting the evil
Unleashed the beast from the book of dead.
