You touch my deathly face
You now my only faith
This night before I fall
Bleeding shadows on the wall
This night they back to hold me
With his faces rotten to the core
With bloody wings embrace me
My soul is lost forevermore

Hungry demons coming up to me
Takes me far away
They drink blood from my veins
Death it's now my only way

Forever betrayed
Forever my destiny
I wanna find out a situation
Forever betrayed
Forever my destiny
I'm trying to find a new decision for my self

In darkness they reborn
So many hate and scorn
Legions rise up to fight
From the grave again this night
Holy angels ride beside me
They protect my cross and belief
Will destroy the darkness in me
And I pray to god for relief

Desperation rise
