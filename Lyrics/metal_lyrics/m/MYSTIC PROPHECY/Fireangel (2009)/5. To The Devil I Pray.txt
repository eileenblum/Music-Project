I wake up in a nightmare dream
And see the devil is walking in the front of my eyes
With fingers he scroll in the book of dead
And try to steal my breath
I'm your soul, survivor
From the first day you'll burn you be mine
Only the strong will survive

Burn down emotions
I rip my veins
Deep inside again
To the devil I pray
Deep down on my knees again
In circles I play his evil game
To the devil I pray... to the devil

The devil rules my world night and day
My god is dead no time to pray
Forever cursed
Forever deny
My blood will flow
High up from the sky
His spirit... all around
I'm six feet underground
