I call you my lord
From the depths of my heart
From the first day I was born
I carry your holy thorn
Every night the demon in me
Take this sickness out please set me free

Father... you forsake your son for his sins
I give my soul for you
And you break my heart in two
All night I fall grace
In all my darkend days
Like an angel lost in haze
My broken wings will blaze

So many hate and pain
Without a victory
So many blood remain
Last step of history

Revolution evil... evil!
Across upon the sky
My last salvation
Now it's time to die
Revolution evil
The devil in disguise
Down on my knees again
For evil I die
Revolution evil

Father please forgive me and forget
My soul and sorrow
For you will regret
I'm the fallen angel
Betray for victory
In hell show no mercy
I kill in ecstasy
