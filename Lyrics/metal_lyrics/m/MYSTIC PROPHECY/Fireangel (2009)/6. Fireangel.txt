Angel demon over me
Crimson on the sky
Sacrifice my face in black
Ripping out my eyes
Something evil dark in blaze
With deep scars in his eyes
Burning out my soul in hate
In hell black angel dominate

You're my angel you're my slave
Journey to my grave

The fireangel calls your name
Every nightmare be the same
In the darkness burns a flame
Call you ever again
The fireangel touch your skin
Will surrender deep within
From the depths of hell return
Fireangel burn

Angel come and set me free
The violence in me
Killing me and kill for me
Emotion dying victory
