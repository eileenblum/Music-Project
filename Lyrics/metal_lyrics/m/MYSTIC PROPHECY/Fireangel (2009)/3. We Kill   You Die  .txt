With evil by my side
My soul out of control
No mercy no more pray
The world will fall in grey
We are the legions of the damned
The god's creation
Before you die forevermore
In death dissection

Forever in my hands your soul now enslaved will reign
Infernal majesty the legion rise again

We kill! You die!!
You never reach the sky... I'm your killer I'm your sinner
Deep in your heart this night
We kill! You die!!
Black demons in the sky... I'm your sinner I'm your killer
Your soul be mine tonight

Before my resurrection
Oceans of blood I drink for you
Dark lords scream from the darkness
Last fight for me and you
In darkness demon shadows fly
For your extinction
In blood they're bathing like insane
Your last damnation
