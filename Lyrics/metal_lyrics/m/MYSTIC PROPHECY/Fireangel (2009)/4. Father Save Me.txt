Flying shadows across the sky
They rip my soul before I die
The seven gates of hell will present
Now I'm ready for my defence
My life... out of reaction
My mind... out of control
I feel his force of attraction
With blood he scrawl my name of the wall

Reborn to get his vengeance
Their blood in zero degree
Reborn to kill with hatred
The beast again now will be free

Father save me when I fall
Every night I hear you call
Father forgive me for my sins
Don't let the evil deep within
Father save me from my pain
I need you I go insane
Father forgive what I've done
Let me be your chosen one

In magic symbols he writes my name
They fight for hell and evil spell
He swear revenge from deep within
Conspiracy for my last sin
My blood... in devils obsession
My fight the edge of despair
I sold my soul for damnation
My burning flesh will smell on the air
