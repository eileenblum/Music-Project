The blackness and damnation deep in your soul don't lie
Now you search for destruction pain before you die
We hail... prevail
Tonight will be in hell
This last fight will give you immortal spell

The sadness takes my breath away
My last judgement day

Across the gates of hell
I'll never deny
The death will come my heart will touch the sky
Across the gates of hell
Forever deny
No way out
Across the gates of hell

I take my last salvation before I die this night
My bloodlust will desire revenge in a eternal fight
Redemption realise
Salvation - sacrifice
This night my blood will drown for afterlife
