They're born in the dust of fire
The seven god's awake no one can stop
His thirst of blood desire
Hell and fire will conspire
Take the world with false messiah
From the depths of hell they rise
Destruction is the price

In thousands they are fallen in the battlefield of lies
The warlord comes it's time to die!

The god's of war
Black magic surround me
Demons have found me
The god's of war
The fall one by one
The darkness forsake me
His faith will control me
The gods of war

Deadly warrior revolution
Wind and fire dead confusion
With bombs they take your tower
Their religion is the power
