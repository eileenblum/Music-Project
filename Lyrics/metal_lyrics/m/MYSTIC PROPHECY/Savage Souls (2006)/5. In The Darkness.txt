Evil spirit flies around me
And I feel my breath will fly away
Now the devils are beside me
And feel the madness in me
I can feel the strange inside
Dreadful shadows in my mind
Now my blood flows on the ground
When my dreams will turn around

Now I try to escape from the vengeance
Before I die this night in my blood

In the darkness
You can find the answer
There's a place between life and dead
In the darkness
You can find the answer
There's a place the edge of despair

With my hands I try to touch him
In the mirror I can see his face
They show me pictures of horror
And they betray his name

They play with my pain
And open new wounds everyday
Now the shadows coming back
And I try pray to god

Now I try to escape from the vengeance
Before I die this night in my blood

In the darkness
You can find the answer
There's a place between life and dead
In the darkness
You can find the answer
There's a place the edge of despair

Everyday I hear voices in me
Everyday I feel the pain inside of me
I walk alone this way in the dark
And in the haze I see shadows in black
The last night you stole my heart
This night I'll take my life for salvation
