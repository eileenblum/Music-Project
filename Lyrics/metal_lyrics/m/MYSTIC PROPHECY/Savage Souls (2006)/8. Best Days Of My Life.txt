I am the one
Who see the fallen angel
Now I am strong
And fight to survive
Now gone with the storm
Forgotten with the endless time
Can you remember the nights
As we fly hand in hand
Over the mountains
Over the clouds to the stars
So I can tell you

The best days of my life
Are the days at your side
This where the best -- days of my life
The best days of my life
Are the days at your side
This where the best
The best days of my life

Now you are coming every night
And whispering your name
Can you remember the days
As we fly day by day
Over the mountains
Over the sees of the sun
So I can tell you

The best days of my life
Are the days at your side
This where the best -- days of my life
The best days of my life
Are the days at your side
This where the best
The best days of my life
