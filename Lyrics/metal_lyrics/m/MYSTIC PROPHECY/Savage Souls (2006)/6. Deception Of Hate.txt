I am your new messiah
And I am deep inside your mind
Don't try to save your soul
I am your only salvation
Please tell me where you are?
I am the other side of dark and light
No evening in a land
Where shadows rule the world

I can feel the hate inside
I'm alone within my mind
Deception of hate
I can feel the morning sun
And my nightmares has begun
Deception of hate

Don't try to escape
Deom your fucking evil past
This damned world is mine
And you the victim of my line
Please help me out of here
I can smell the ripping burning corps
The madness coming back
Where shadows rule the world
