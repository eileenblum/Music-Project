They spread around us
Like evilized epidemic
Treason and death are strange words
With the power of evil and death
Dark forces they will rule and offer the world
Black power they desire
Lead to war with no end

Evil massage evil games going through your head in flames
Killing lies and killing thoughts nothing else
Than empty words

Evil empires -- evil empires
With lies they take your spirits away
Evil empires -- evil empires
Now it's time for breaking the chains

Corpse pile up on the stake
The fire swallow with it's flame
Everything and only a black smoke is what remains
The dust is death
Is riding on the horizon
Once more invasion is the new instruction
