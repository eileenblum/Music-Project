The time has come
The last sign falls
My prophecy will bring
The infernal firestorm
My home is -- the black in you
A angel with black wings will be reborn

For one second you are feeling strong
But the fear is inside you

When the silence ends
The death will take
Your sins and your sorrows

I have seen the angels fall
The last fight in heaven has begun
I can see -- the hate in you
The burning flame in hell is waiting for you

For one second you are feeling strong
But the fear is inside you

When the silence ends
The death will take
Your sins and your sorrows

In your heart and in your soul
You can feel the pain inside you
And the colours of your life
Will glow with me this night
