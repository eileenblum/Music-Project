Do you really want to die for
The freedom that don't exists in?
The ocean of the graves
In front of you
Is the result of the illusion of fate

Every candle a death
Now you loosing all your faith
In your heart and the future
Of your world

Wake up death
You come like a storm in the night
The nightmares of demons
Welcome death
And show me the final attack
The nightmares of demons are back

You are coming back
From another world
Meaning to be a real hero
The blood that is sticking on your hands
Is the blood of your own brother
