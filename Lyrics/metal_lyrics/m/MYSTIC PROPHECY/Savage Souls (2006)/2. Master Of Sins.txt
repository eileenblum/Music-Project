You're the one
You are the light in my dark mind
You open wounds but you close them again
Don't let me go -- please stay by my side now
You reading my thoughts -- and you believe in vain

You are a small part in my life
A part between living and dying
In eternity

Now!!! You're the angel of my dreams
You have colours on your wings
You're the master of my sins

Now!!! You're the angel of my dreams
You have colours on your wings
You're the master of my sins

Every night you protect me from the deep fall
You guide my mind and give me all I want
You're my fear please come and take my soul now
Now I am free -- until we meet in hell
