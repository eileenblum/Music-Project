Can you tell me
Is there dying wide before death?
Can you feel me -- now it's time to go!!!
Into the depth of my soul
I can feel the pain inside of me
You open my wounds again
And read my thoughts -- see who I am

You are the light that banish darkness and fear
You are my leader in the night you are the devil in disguise

When the night is falling
When the demons calling
We will burn into the fire

When the night is falling
When the demons calling
We will burn into the fire
In our sins this night

Every night you have a fight against yourself
And you are lying in an ocean of blood
And trying to write my name
A name which exists only in your dreams
With no sense and meaning
It's the last attemption
To wake up my spirit

You are the light that banish darkness and fear
You are my leader in the night you are the devil in disguise

When the night is falling
When the demons calling
We will burn into the fire

When the night is falling
When the demons calling
We will burn into the fire
In our sins this night

I try to deal my soul and concentrating
With the devil
I spread my wings and try to hold
You back again
