You promise me peace in this world
With your lies you sacrifice my life
He senses me to be something holy
And we kneel down
And pray for the promise land
You are the holy beast eating me and killing me
His words sound like velvet on my skin
But it's only a lie to be sacrificed
Since over hundred years he's tyrannizing us
They decide between life and death
He is the king of this world

Savage souls are screaming every night
They try to bring you in another fight
Savage souls dark spirits everywhere
With evil thoughts show you the promise land
Savage souls

He's hiding behind the cross of god
He's like a beast waiting for you
With a Judas kiss he's banishing me and burning me
You condemn my soul into another lie
They decide between life and death
He is the king of this world

Savage souls are screaming every night
They try to bring you in another fight
Savage souls dark spirits everywhere
With evil thoughts show you the promise land
Savage souls
