We are here to turn back the time
And we here to touch the sun
We are the parasite which tries to destroy the world
We are here have stolen your soul
We are here for killing you all
The only we believe is the force of the universe

We kill -- in the name of god and bathing
In his own blood
We kill -- for the history to get eternal life

Shadows beyond my soul
They will be hounding and killing as all
Shadows beyond my soul
They will be here to forsake your damned world

We are flying from the earth to the stars
And we feel the power in us
The future don't exist because the time stand still
When we fight in the battlefield
And the night falls over the hills
We are the sacrifice of this way to life

We kill -- in the name of god and bathing
In his own blood
We kill -- for the history to get eternal life

Shadows beyond my soul
They will be hounding and killing as all
Shadows beyond my soul
They will be here to forsake your damned world
