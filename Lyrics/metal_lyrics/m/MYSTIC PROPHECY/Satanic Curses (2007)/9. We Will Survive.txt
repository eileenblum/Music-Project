Can you hear the children cry?
Lonely screams before they die
Another day is gone with promises
And deadly crimes
Proclaimed messiahs with words
Manipulating your thoughts
They will control your life
With unreal fucking lies

Uncontrollable we destroy us all
Cry
Darkness everywhere
The future lost out there
With empty words don't let you hypnotize

Together we're strong
Together we're one
In sadness now
We will survive
Together we're here
Forever we fear
In darkness now
We will survive

Don't run away from mistakes
The death will come and takes
Alone we [are] standing at the abyss of despair
Now take your life in your hand
Together until the end
With endless reverence and pride
We are strong

Uncontrollable we destroy us all
With empty words don't let you hypnotize
