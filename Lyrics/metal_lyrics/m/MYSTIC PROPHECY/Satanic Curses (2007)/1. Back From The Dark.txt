The bloody oath of raven
It's back to kill again
The shadows of the past
Will come back to take revenge
We are resurrection
We will realize
We give yo illusions
We are the devil's eyes

When emotions and fear united
And your dreams will now be real

I'm back from the dark
I'm breaking your silence
Into your nightmares
I'm back from the dark

I'm back from the dark
I'm killing your sadness
With power and violence
I'm back from the dark

The path into damnation
The silence will die
You wait for redemption
In the ravage of my lie
We are immolation
We are genocide
We give you perception
We are the dead inside
