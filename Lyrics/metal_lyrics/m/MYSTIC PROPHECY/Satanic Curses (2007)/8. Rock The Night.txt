Somewhere in the world around
We can hear the metal sound
We fight with raising swords
Beside the metal gods
We create the dragons world
And let the kingdoms fall
We are the chosen ones who fight
Against the beast

We let the legends still alive
Reborn in flesh and blood
The name it's rock n' roll
The law deep in your soul

We rock the night
We rock your life
We create the sound
That's deep in your heart
We rock your soul
We rock your world
Resurrection thoughts
Between the two worlds

Every night with flames on the stage
With the glory to th e edge
We bring the metal back
Deep inside your heart
In your head and in your soul
Have a mission you want all
Feel the vision like a raging hungry firestorm
