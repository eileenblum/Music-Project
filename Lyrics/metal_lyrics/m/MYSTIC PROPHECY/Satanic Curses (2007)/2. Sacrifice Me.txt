Father please forgive my sins
Prepared my soul for you
The demons in my mind
Try to share my heart in two
Please don't forget me father
To fall into oblivion
The sadness is my mother
And that's my own destruction

Now you believe and you see
The sickness in my heart
You can be
The salvation in my soul

Sacrifice me
So drink my blood to be reborn
The underworld released my soul
Sacrifice me
So give salvation to my heart
My savior in my lonely world

Satan don't let me fall
Now I stand here and call
Can you hear my bleeding soul?

Blood shadows on the wall
