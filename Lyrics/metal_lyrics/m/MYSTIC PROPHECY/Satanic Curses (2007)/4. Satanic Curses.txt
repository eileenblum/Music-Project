In a dark demonic fullmoon night
The masters will now call
The armies of death
Thunder and lightning and fire from the sky
They burn you to ashes
And force you to lie
A world full of blackness
A world full of pain
This is the end of his evil game

Can you hear them?
They scream your name again and again
Can you feel them?
That's the final attack

Satanic curses
The demons are calling your name
Satanic curses
Now you burn in Hell
Dark shadows are over your head

The gates of hell - it's open again
Thousands are coming to get his revenge
The earth drowns in blood
The riders unbound
They try to destroy and kill around

Satanic curses
The demons are calling your name
Satanic curses
Now you burn in Hell
The riders of Hell brings you hate
Satanic curses
Now death is your fate
The demons are calling your name
Satanic curses
Now you burn in flame
Your soul now is drowning in flames
