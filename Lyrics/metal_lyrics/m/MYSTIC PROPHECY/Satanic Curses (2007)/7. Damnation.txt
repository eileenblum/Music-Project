When I close my eyes
The black birds come to hold his price
The blackness overcomes
And takes my breath away
Bloody shadows on the wall
Are trapped in an unreal world
Where the legions of the damned
Prepare the immortal souls

Incantation between two worlds
Abomination the spirits of your God's

In damnation
It's the answer of your lonely world
In the darkness and daylight
Damnation
For the faithless of your holy God's
It's your last fight of your life

I give you my last breath
And you give me eternal pain
My God forsake me
So hold me back in Hell
Through my flesh and sorrow
Black my soul and hollow
Bring me to your promised land
Lead me to my blessed end
