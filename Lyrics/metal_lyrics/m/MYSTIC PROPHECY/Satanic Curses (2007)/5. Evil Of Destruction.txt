The way to end it's now clear
For your smeared in your blood eyes
Betrayed and abased alone with
Your holy blackness destiny
The war in your head
The war is your death
That's the end and your deep fall
Black raven return to get his victims
Back to eternity

The hammer of war now is falling
All signs show on destruction
Forever in corruption

Evil of destruction
War flames will rise to the sky
Evil of destruction
Nothing can stop now this hate

Forever condemned to fight and suicide
For your sick own religion
With hatred and wrath
They try to destroy the God's creation
