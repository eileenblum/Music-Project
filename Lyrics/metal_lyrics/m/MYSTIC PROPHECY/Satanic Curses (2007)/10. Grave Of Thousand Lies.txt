World of lies and conviction
An evil plan will bring you death
Thousands are dying on the hill
Who stops the damned to kill
You leave only a deep cut into your heart
A lonely place with deep scars
Unholy wars

The angels try to save you
To save and hold you back
But shadows of the otherside
Bring you the last attack

The grave of the thousand lies
The real answers full of pain and sadness
The grave of the thousand lies
There's the place where the mothers cry

Don't forget the blackened days
You don't learn from your mistakes
The return will be in graves
Your blood flows in waves
His soul and heart now it's black
I hear them screaming
The spirits now forever lost
For those who are dreaming

The grave of the thousand lies
The real answers full of pain and sadness
The grave of the thousand lies
A place where life and death unite
The grave of the thousand lies
There's the place where the mothers cry
