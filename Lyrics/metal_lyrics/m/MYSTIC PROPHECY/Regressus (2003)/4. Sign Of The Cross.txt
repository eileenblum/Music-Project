[Music: Liapakis, Gus G. / lyrics: Liapakis]

Close your eyes
Can you hear me in the dark
I see angels in black
Visions of fire
Visions of pain
Whipped by the past
And you bleeding inside!

Only then
You will realize what you have done
I've seen visions of power
And rumors of war

The sign of the cross
It's a sign to your soul
The sign of the cross
It's a sign to remind
It's a sign to survive
The sign of the cross

Im the one who created your dreams
And im the one that steals them
Give me your hand and let me take you to places
Full of darkness and pain
