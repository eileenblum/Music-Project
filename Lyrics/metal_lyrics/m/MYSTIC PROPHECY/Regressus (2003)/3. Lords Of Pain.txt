[Music: Liapakis, Gus G. / lyrics: Liapakis]

When they returned from the storm
Turned by the bloodstains and dust
I stand alone in my altar
And blessed by the fathers of the dark
To give me my soul back again

Lords of pain
Hold my soul as I die
Lords of pain
Drink my blood
Lords of pain
Give me a sign from you
Lords of pain
Let me die

When I kneel before the pentagram
And call your name
I pray to my gods
To come back again
To kill me again
