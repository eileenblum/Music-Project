[Music: Liapakis, Gus G. / lyrics: Liapakis]

It's time to realize your dreams my friend
Relax and fall into my arms
With no fear
And you'll feel the mighty
Hatred I keep inside of me
You lick my wounds and now
You feel the pain

My life is not a dream
My dreams are dark and cold
I am the god of hate

Mystic prophecy
Black raven coming over you
Mystic prophecy
This is the sign for you and me
Mystic prophecy

The pain that I've been carrying
With me
For hundreds of years
Drink from my blood surrender
Your soul to me forever more
I am the sign you've been waiting for
