[Music: Liapakis, Gus G. / lyrics: Liapakis]

I'm fearing in the moment
When the sun goes down
In the darkness of the night
I hear the voices of dakness
They want me to go back
To their graven world
Where the night and death will reign

I can see them in the sky
They scream to me my destiny

In the land of the dead
The endless pain will begin
In the land of the dead
This is your kingdom of pain

The blood of mine that u took
Will not come back to you
I put my hands deep in blood
And let it drops fall slowly
On your head
This ritual this night u never will survive
