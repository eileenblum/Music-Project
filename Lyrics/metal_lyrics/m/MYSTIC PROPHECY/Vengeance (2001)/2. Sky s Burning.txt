My last breath
I hear they are coming
The ghosts on my curse
Surround myself
and drill into my lifeless body

And we are flying
In the dark black sky

They are whispering to me
I have to win the fight
Against myself
To write the names of the victims
With bloody hands into the sky
I can see the flames

Sky's burning in my eyes
Burning in my heart

And my soul forever
Let your dreams free
One more time
Never think back in time
Then you burn forever

Can you hear me
I shout your names
You will kneel to pray at me
To save yourselves
But it is me who delivers
All of you for eternity

They are whispering to me
I have to win the fight
Against myself
To write the names of the victims
With bloody hands into the sky
I can see the flames

Sky's burning in my eyes
Burning in my heart

And my soul forever
Let your dreams free
One more time
Never think back in time
Then you burn forever

I will come back -- to you
I will come back -- to kill you
Burn in hell -- forever
