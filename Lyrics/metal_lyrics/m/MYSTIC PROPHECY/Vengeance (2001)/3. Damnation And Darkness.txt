He was born again
Living forever
in time and space

Master of darkness
Servant for none
His eyes the fire
A soulless being cursed by sunlight
Excelled by the embrace of the night

In the name of fire

Is the secret of hell
In the name of fire
In damnation and darkness

Hunted by his sins in the past

Now he is back to destroy them
As old as the evil

Wicked like sin
We kneel by the force
He was the power

In the name of fire
Is the secret of hell

In the name of fire
In damnation and darkness

Damnation darkness
