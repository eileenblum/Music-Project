Are you yearning
The events of tomorrow?
Do you dream of the future?
I will unite with dark forces

We disdain the death
Fighting ritual wars
Nobody understands
The sky turns red
No one can be rescued

I will unite with dark forces

When shadows fall
Death is the only fate
When shadows fall
I'm your master of hate

When darkness swallow the day
The moonlight will guide you
The name in the tombstone
will be yours
Then the painful silence
I will burn

There is no hope
You have lost yourself
The dices have tumbled
now it's time to leave
When the sun will never shine

When shadows fall
Death is the only fate
When shadows fall
I'm your master of hate

With deep scars in the heart
on the way to see heaven
Innerly torn apart forever
