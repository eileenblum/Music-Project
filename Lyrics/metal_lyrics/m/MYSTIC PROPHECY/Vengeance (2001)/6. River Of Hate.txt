Can you hear my voice?
It tells you that I am wrong
I will see you burning
Darkness will cover
the death of the other soul
I wait for my own requiem
Or the end of all the time

I am an angel
I am the devil inside

Feel the pain in your soul
Your sleepless nights
will be mine
The gifts I will bring to you
Fire and the dust of my dreams

Someone you have never seen before
Somewhere you have never been before

No blood is running
Through my veins
Only ice on the
river of hate

You are the only and last witness
of the murder of an angel
There is another side of heaven
determined for you
The eclipse of eternity

No blood is running
Through my veins
Only ice on the
river of hate
