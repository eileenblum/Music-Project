I thought a lot about you
Longing with rage and greed
Suspending through the darkness
The earth is on flames

Lost in thoughts
in time and space
We kill the past day by day
To return into life come to me

In the distance
In my thoughts and
In my secret dreams
In the distance
In the darkness
Evil with angels skin

I have been captured
in a labyrinth of hate
Paralyzed and irritated
of your vision

The truth vanished
like a shadow in the dark
If we break the gate of eternity
We will witness the death

In the distance
In my thoughts and
In my secret dreams
In the distance
In the darkness
Evil with angels skin
