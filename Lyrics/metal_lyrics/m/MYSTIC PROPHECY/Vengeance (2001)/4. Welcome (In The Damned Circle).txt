Can you see me
Can you feel me
Burning deep inside you

I have been always near to you
I will bring you the new religion
You are the one who
raised me from the dead
I will steal your sleep
Every quiet moment
I have come back to deliver you

I see all your secrets

In your eyes
I feel the fear cause
I am inside yourself
My kiss survived
two thousand years

Changing the whole life on earth
Do you recognize myself?
I am the air that you breathe

Welcome -- in the damned circle
Welcome -- in a dark place
Welcome -- in the damned circle
Welcome -- where souls burn

Your old wounds are opened up
The hate will flow

Like a torrential river
Destroying all the moral barriers
In the raging storm

Welcome -- in the damned circle
Welcome -- in a dark place
Welcome -- in the damned circle
Welcome -- where souls burn

Welcome my friend
In the damned circle
You have to pass the labyrinth of evil
If you want to join

Come the light in the dark
Is not the end
Just the beginning
of your nightmares
It has been you
trying to be like god

Welcome -- in the damned circle
Welcome -- in a dark place
Welcome -- in the damned circle
Welcome -- where souls burn
