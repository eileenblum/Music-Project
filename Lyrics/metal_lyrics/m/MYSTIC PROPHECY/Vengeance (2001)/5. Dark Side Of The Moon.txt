I'm afraid of day and night
I'm breaking in two
thousand pieces
Hands are touching me
again and again
and I can't defeat myself

Is this only a dream?
Please tell me why!

It's the dark side of the moon
When I see your face in black

Every night
destroying my dreams
I'm crying and try to escape
Cause the pain is unbearable
When you close
The door behind you

I stay alone with my shattered dreams
and all the pain

It's the dark side of the moon
When I see your face in black

I'm trying to walk away
But I know that
you're coming back

And it will happen in the most
Beautiful parts of my dreams
And everything will start again
And I ask you why?

I'm trying to walk away
But I know that
you're coming back

It's the dark side of the moon
When I see your face in black
