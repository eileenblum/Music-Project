The look into the mirror
The evil awakening
I see the devil in my eyes
I am my worst enemy
I'm not the one you think I am
But I want to know
the taste of death
and move towards my destiny

Fallen angel of eternal flame
Lost in the garden of sins
Fallen angel of eternal flame
Lost in a twilight of despair

The blood of my enemies
and two dying doves
and a black angel will unite
Tomorrow will never end
Today will never come back again
Do you see the day
destroyed by the darkness?
And move towards my destiny

Fallen angel of eternal flame
Lost in the garden of sins
Fallen angel of eternal flame
Lost in a twilight of despair

Into my lost dreams
Spend one more day
Not to resign
Spend one more day
And wait for the night
When it's over you'll find the answer

This is a dark place
Because you made it
This is a dark place
And it was your fiction
Swallowed by oblivion
This was the name of the place
I have been before

I am the evil
I see the devil in my eyes
I'm your day and night
I'm the coldness in your heart
I'm your death
Now you pray for your life
But it's too late

Fallen angel of eternal flame
Lost in the garden of sins
Fallen angel of eternal flame
Lost in a twilight of despair
