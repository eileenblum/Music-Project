[Music: Gus G / lyrics: Liapakis]

The night falling over me
And the fear is your only friend
I'm your depression
Your inner beast is home again

Can you describe the pain
Now you feel all of my suffering

When I'm falling
I open my arms
I won't deny it
When I'm falling
I know you await for me

Now close your eyes
And let you guide to
The other side of the sea
A place of darkness
Where sin and death reign
All over the souls

What ever you do
Where ever you go my misery
Will follow you
