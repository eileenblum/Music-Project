[Music: Liapakis, M. Albrecht / lyrics: Liapakis]

When we are back
The seventh door of hell will open
The sky turns red and clouds shed tried
Crimson raindrops down to earth
In our hands the power and the force
We give you lies and reveal
You give your soul
And the world will be drowned in blood

All the spirits of evil are
Coming over you
And your wish to betray bring us
Back to you

We are the warriors of lies
We will bring you illusions
We are the warriors of lies
When you call we realize
We are the warriors of lies
We will bring you confusion
We are the warriors of lies
When you call you have to die

Death for death
Until the last drop of blood is spoiled
The end is near
For us you have betrayed your god

Now your blood omen has come to an end
And your cursed and full of hatred soul
Is now laying in peace... maybe we'll
Meet again someday maybe in your dreams
Maybe in hell!!!
