[Music: Gus G. / lyrics: Liapakis]

In my eyes you can see the grief
My face can not cover the times which
Have now passed by
Always on the search for eternal death
Do you think that I will live on
To see the day
When the times stand still
The earth stops spinning around?
But the fire still glows
Deep in my heart

I open my eyes and look to the horizon
And let my mind fly away

Never surrender
Never look back in the past
Never surrender
And your pain will no more last
Never surrender
In your lonely days and nights
Never surrender
In your heart and in your soul
You're alone

I have the dream to be a gentle breeze
One day
Free from all of the load in my heart
Insanity has no end
Give me your judas kiss
And leave for the world of dreams
There I'll wait for you
