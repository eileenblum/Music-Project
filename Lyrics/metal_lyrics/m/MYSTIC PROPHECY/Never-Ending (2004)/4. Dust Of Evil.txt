[Music: Liapakis, Gus G., M. Albrecht / lyrics: Liapakis]

Hounding shadows awake you
From eternal flame
You scream my name in the nocturnal wind
Crawling into the crypts below
Revenge burns in your veins again

And in the freezing vastness
You spill my blood on the altar again

The dust of evil... you can not espace the
Death is your faith
The dust of evil... the hatred is back and with
Him the legions of the death

I open the seventh gate
And see your face my lord
You touch my face and...
My eyes begin to bleed
You touch my soul and I feel your
Hatred deep inside
A hurricane that spreads
And destruction in its path

And in the freezing vastness
You drink my blood on the altar again
