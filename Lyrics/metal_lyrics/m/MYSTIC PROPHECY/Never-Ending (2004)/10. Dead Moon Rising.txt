[Music: Gus G. / lyrics: Liapakis]

Welcome in my world of suffering
Taste my blood and greed will
Steal your soul
When all the demons are howling
Into the night
Unleashing all their power
Deep inside your heart
And your underworld now ends
Before your eyes

Stand aside and fight with us
Rise or fall in the name of satan

See the darkness falling
And coldness over me
The dead moon rising again over
The mountains
I pray for relief
Out of the darkness I hear
The cries of victory
The dead moon rising again

God hates you for all what you have done
Smell my blood and rotting flesh
Fight against the one who gave you the
Eternal life
Kill him and eat his heart
Now stay by my side
And you will be damned in darkness forever
