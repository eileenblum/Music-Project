Evil spirit over my soul
Father don't try forsake me
Never 'gain try to break me
It's time for me to realize
Goddamn solution, evil lies (eyes?)
My soul betrayed and sacrificed

Legions of the other side
Rising from the sky
No one can stop them
Evil spirit never dies

Hate black
Sacrifice myself for my last attack
Hate black
Evil eyes with hate, my madness in my head
Hate black
Something wicked now turns me back in black
Hate black
Attack, attack, attack!
Hate black

Killing is my desire
Like a child that plays with fire
Killing from the godless hand
I am soldier, I'm the command

The spirit told the evil lie
Bloody angels fill the sky
And howling souls will burn in flames

Legions of the other side
Rising from the sky
No one can stop them
Evil spirit never dies

Hate black
Sacrifice myself for my last attack
Hate black
Evil eyes with hate, my madness in my head
Hate black
Something wicked now turns me back in black
Hate black
Attack, attack, attack!
Hate black

Hate black
Sacrifice myself for my last attack
Hate black
Evil eyes with hate, my madness in my head
Hate black
Something wicked now turns me back in black
Hate black
Attack, attack, attack!
Hate black
Hate black
