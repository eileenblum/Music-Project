Dark angel screaming my name
With hate take my dreams
In a dark room full of nightmares
Can you hear my silent scream?

Shadows with demons eyes
No dreams are realized
Hellfire made of sins
With the devil for the endless (...)

My heart and soul to my lord and son again
And see the dead deep in his eyes
My soul to take till the day I die

Welcome into my nightmares
Welcome into my world
The darkness is my friend
The children of the damned

Into the secret silence
My lord I pray tonight
Forever hell is send
The children of the damned

The children of the damned

The devil roll the dice
From the blackness they will rise
The ritual has begun
Satan's word forever done

My heart and soul to my lord and son again
And see the dead deep in his eyes
My soul to take till the day I die

Welcome into my nightmares
Welcome into my world
The darkness is my friend
The children of the damned

Into the secret silence
My lord I pray tonight
Forever hell is send
The children of the damned

Welcome into my nightmares
Welcome into my world
The darkness is my friend
The children of the damned

Into the secret silence
My lord I pray tonight
Forever hell is send
The children of the damned

The children of the damned
The children of the damned
The children of the damned
The children of the damned

The children of the damned
