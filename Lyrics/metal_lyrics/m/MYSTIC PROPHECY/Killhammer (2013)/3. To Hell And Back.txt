Every day I try to find the answers
The answers deep in my thoughts in my mind
My salvation I try to find
To heal my soul forever

Try to remember the good time we had
Hand in hand everywhere over the land
Promised forever love, forever
'til the end of my days
For you now here I stand

Why don't you know how I feel?
Why don't you know?

One day will come and take my inner fears
Some days I wish I will disappear
Every night in my dreams I would paint it black to hell and back

One day will take my soul and my tears
From the darkness I will ever disappear
Every night in my dreams I would paint it black to hell and back

Oh, no

I'll never forget these blackened days
The day I've been losing ... ways
This gotta be ... everything you betrayed
Like a butterfly you're flying away

Was your promise only a lie?
Baby, my loving for you â it'll never die

One day will come and take my inner fears
Some days I wish I will disappear
Every night in my dreams I would paint it black to hell and back

One day will take my soul and my tears
From the darkness I will ever disappear
Every night in my dreams I would paint it black to hell and back

One day I'm coming back to hell and back

One day will come and take my inner fears
Some days I wish I will disappear
Every night in my dreams I would paint it black to hell and back

One day will take my soul and my tears
From the darkness I will ever disappear
Every night in my dreams I would paint it black to hell and back, yeah.
