Self-proclaimed messiah insane
Father and son drown the world into flame

Higher over the sky the damnation roll over the world
Here comes destruction

Fight the fire - his desire
Eye to eye - soldiers die
Bombs ... - no delay
... - from the USA

One bullet will come over the ocean-wide
Crush your mind, three, two, one

Kill the beast
Said dictators from the east
Kill the beast
Killing monster is unleashed
Kill the beast
Atomic bombs rise from the east
Kill the beast
Killing bastard death ...

Angel of retribution and lies
The world will fall in eternal lies

Roll the fire, blazing soul
Death desire, thunder roll
Killing heart, fill that fist
Atomic count, kill the beast

One bullet will come over the ocean-wide
Crush your mind, three, two, one

Kill the beast
Said dictators from the east
Kill the beast
Killing monster is unleashed
Kill the beast
Atomic bombs rise from the east
Kill the beast
Killing bastard death ...
Kill the beast

Kill the beast
Said dictators from the east
Kill the beast
Killing monster is unleashed
Kill the beast
Atomic bombs rise from the east
Kill the beast
Killing bastard death ...
Kill the beast
Kill the beast
