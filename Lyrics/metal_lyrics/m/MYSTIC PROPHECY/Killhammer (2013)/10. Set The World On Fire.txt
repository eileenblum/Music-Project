Suffocated hate parade
Visions of the future carnage
Burning down barriers of law
No surrender, blood will flow

Shoot them down into the goal
Welcome into nightmare war
With these lies, sacrifice
Human children, future dies

Burning down this state of terror
Sole demise completely error

Are you ready?

Scream out loud what you know
The (...) down for false messiah
Set the world on fire

Never let them bring you down
Be no six feet under ground
Politicians fucking liars
Set the world on fire

Set the world on fire

Welcome in the show of lies
The dead will roll the dice
Politicians fake illusions
Evil TV revolution

Rolling fire over the land
Together pride we stand
It is (...)
(...) like a storm

Burning down this state of terror
Sole demise completely error

Are you ready?

Scream out loud what you know
The (...) down for false messiah
Set the world on fire

Never let them bring you down
Be no six feet under ground
Politicians fucking liars
Set the world on fire

Are you ready to go on?
Scream out and rise your fist up higher
Set the world on fire

Never let them bring you down
Be no six feet under ground
Politicians fucking liars
Set the world on fire

Scream out loud what you know
The (...) down for false messiah
Set the world on fire

Never let them bring you down
Be no six feet under ground
Politicians fucking liars
Set the world on fire

Set the world on fire
