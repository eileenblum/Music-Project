From the land of fire
Through the gates of hell
Heathen warriors, the chosen ones
Another evil spell

Have fire across the land
He is a ... he's dead
... masquerade
Holy warriors will descend

Killhammer
Kill and destroy
Killhammer
Destruction you cannot avoid
Killhammer
Fighting killing machine
Killhammer
Fight, kill, win

Killhammer

They're riding from the blackness
With the armies ... night
The warhead kills with madness
Resurrection, eternal fight

Damnation in his eyes
Spiritual deadly lies
Six six six is his name
Show no mercy, blood will reign

Killhammer
Kill and destroy
Killhammer
Destruction you cannot avoid
Killhammer
Fighting killing machine
Killhammer
Fight, kill, win, hey

Killhammer
Kill and destroy
Killhammer
Destruction you cannot avoid
Killhammer
Fighting killing machine
Killhammer
Fight, kill, win, hey

Killhammer
