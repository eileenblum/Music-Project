Through the darkness see they ride
The beast is back, will start to fight

The sky turns red
The moon stills black
Out in the clouds
For my final attack

Silent screaming through the night
The lord unleashed the beast for last fight

No heart and soul
No (...) sins and lies
The sadness (...)
Angel-devil (...)

Angels of fire
And your heart and soul are flying higher
Angel of night
See your wings are burning shining bright
Angels of fire
With your sins are flying higher
Into the fire
The devil secret of desire

Angels of fire

Screaming angels, the beast never banned
The battle of souls forever condemned
The lord fly again with blood on his wings
Down on your knees for the king of the kings

No heart and soul
No (...) sins and lies
The sadness (...)
Angel-devil (...)

Angels of fire
And your heart and soul are flying higher
Angel of night
See your wings are burning shining bright
Angels of fire
With your sins are flying higher
Into the fire
The devil secret of desire

Angels of fire

Angels of fire
And your heart and soul are flying higher
Into the night
See your wings are burning shining bright
Angels of fire
With your sins are flying higher
Into the fire
The devil secret of desire

Angels of fire

Angels of fire
