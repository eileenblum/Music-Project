Wake up with hate the dead in the night
A face in the mirror is broken inside
Flesh and bones everywhere
Smell of burning flesh in the air

Every corner out of my mind
Only hate is what you find
Madness and sadness in my head
Hollow inside, I'll be dead

Demons surround me over the sky
Suicide solution, it's a... die

Armies of hell
The seven souls in flames will burn
Armies of hell
Superdevil have returned
Welcome in hell
The legions of the dead will born
Armies of hell
Unleash the beast, that under the evil spell

I am back for breaking the law
Straight back from hell, begin the new war
For my sense I give you my breath
Screaming souls from the valley of death

Demons surround me over the sky
Suicide solution, it's a... die

Armies of hell
The seven souls in flames will burn
Armies of hell
Superdevil have returned
Welcome in hell
The legions of the dead will born
Armies of hell
Take his vengeance, hate, and scorn

Kill! kill! kill! kill!

Armies of hell
The seven souls in flames will burn
Armies of hell
Superdevil have returned
Welcome in hell
The legions of the dead will born
Armies of hell
Unleash the beast, that under the evil spell
