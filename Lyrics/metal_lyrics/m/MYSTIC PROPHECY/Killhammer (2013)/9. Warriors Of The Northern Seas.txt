Rolling thunder blaze from the sky
Only my Lord, only for you I have to die
Fighting heroes will be free
Eye to eye kill, destroy his enemy

Side by side we fight, no fear
Blood will flow, salvation is near
Faquirs never die in slavery
Faquirs only fight for victory

All men are ready to strike
All saints are ride. Ahoy!
Loaded cannons ready to fight
Kill and destroy

Now my soul rise to the sky
Forever for freedom I'm ready to die

Warriors of the northern sea
Show no mercy forever be free
Warriors of the northern sea
Over the mountains to the seven seas

To the seven seas, yeah!

Never surrender, never pretend
Show no mercy till the end, I will defend
From the glory we possessed, holy thunder
From the gods of war we pest

All men are ready to strike
All saints are ride. Ahoy!
Loaded cannons ready to fight
Kill and destroy

Now my soul rise to the sky
Forever for freedom I'm ready to die

Warriors of the northern sea
Show no mercy forever be free
Warriors of the northern sea
Over the mountains to the seven seas

Now my soul rise to the sky
Forever for freedom I'm ready to die

Warriors of the northern sea
Show no mercy forever be free
Warriors of the northern sea
Over the mountains to the seven seas

To the seven seas, yeah!
