Stand up, come out and fight
Through the darkness to the light
Wake up and stop your dream
Your soul decay and scream
Venom - snake of disgrace
Witches - who lose in flames
Demons - the deadly embrace of hell

Welcome in the land of lies
Reign of fire and disguise
The dead is your desire
Burn in endless fire
Welcome in a godless town
Magic spirit fly around
To the sky high and higher
Burn in endless fire

Forever divide and bend
Your soul in hell descend
With the prince of darkness you stand
Welcome to the neverland
God damned

Welcome in the land of lies
Reign of fire and disguise
The dead is your desire
Burn in endless fire
Welcome in a godless town
Magic spirit fly around
To the sky high and higher
Burn in endless fire
