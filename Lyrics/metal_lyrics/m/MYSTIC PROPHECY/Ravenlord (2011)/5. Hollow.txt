It's time for my decision
I'm coming back from hell
Return from my damnation
And running away to find a way
Nothing can't stop me escape from the dark
So many years from the evil apart
Locked like a beast in a cage with my fate
No more regret for my sins and hate, no

And all these years under evil spell
So now I'm straight back from hell

I'm gonna hollow
I'm gonna give you all my life
I'm gonna hollow
Screaming in the night
Black angels from hell flying through the sky
The demons surround me and screaming "You die!"
I'm gonna hollow
Hollow in my mind
Hollow inside

The scars in my face now will show you my faith
The shadows in darkness now will be my friends
Soldiers of evil - Creatures of death
They come from the blackness to take my last breath

Under the sign of reigning blood
Under the dark horizon
And all these years under evil spell
So now I'm straight back from hell

I'm gonna hollow
I'm gonna give you all my life
I'm gonna hollow
Screaming in the night
Black angels from hell flying through the sky
The demons surround me and screaming "You die!"
I'm gonna hollow
Hollow in my mind
