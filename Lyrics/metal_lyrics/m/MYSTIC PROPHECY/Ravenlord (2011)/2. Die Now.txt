What you see isn't real
Only ecstasy
And a big damned thrill
Fucking governments
Sentence to fighting on the hill
The only reason is for you
To kill or be killed
Now you're back with the flag
Your soul is black and dead

War kills generations
No future's the price
Death, self-destruction
For the deadly human race

Die now! I will take your soul now
Die now! Aha!
Die now! Betray and kill for me now
Die now! Die now!

Go away, leave me alone
With your fucking lies
Killing feels so fine
Like a thirsty beast for blood
With a bullet through your mind
Evilized, demonized
Fight like a killing machine
Have the devil deep within
And the deadly seventh sin

War kills generations
No future's the price
Death, self-destruction
For the deadly human race

Die now! I will take your soul now
Die now! Aha!
Die now! Betray and kill for me now
Die now! Die now!

Die now! I will take your soul now
Die now! Aha!
Die now! Betray and kill for me now
Die now!

Die now! I will take your soul now
Die now! Aha!
Die now! Betray and kill for me now
Die now! Die now!
