Never try betray your god
Never bring me down
Never try deceive me, you will burn, oh
Never try forget my name
You will play the game
And I'm the one who gives you the last flame, oh

Bring death and destruction
Stand up and fight
With the hordes of Hell I'm back
You'll never see the light

Forever be damned tonight
Forever be by your inside
In Hell you never see the light
Welcome in afterlife

Forever be damned tonight
Forever be by your side
Your nightmares will be true this night
Forever you be damned tonight

The seven gates of Hell for you
Are open to defy
Surrender and forever crucify, oh
Now it's time for me to go
Listen to me now
Scream out loud, be unbound
Six feet underground

Bring death and destruction
Stand up and fight
With the hordes of Hell I'm back
You'll never see the light

Forever be damned tonight
Forever be by your inside
In Hell you never see the light
Welcome in afterlife

Forever be damned tonight
Forever be by your side
Your nightmares will be true this night
Forever you be damned tonight

Forever be damned tonight
Forever be by your inside
In Hell you never see the light
Welcome in afterlife

Forever be damned tonight
Forever be by your side
Your nightmares will be true this night
Forever you be damned tonight
