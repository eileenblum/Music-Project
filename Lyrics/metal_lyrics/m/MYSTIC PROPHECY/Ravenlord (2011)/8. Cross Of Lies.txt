Thousands today will fall
For the eternal life
In the front the priest will call
Betrayer behind a wall
The knights of cross be unbound
Destroy and kill around
Armies of death collide
For the flags of faith we fight

Don't try to save your life
No way out to survive
Immortal religion lie
For the faith forever die

Deadly sacrifice
We come from hell through the night
Again the dead will rise
Under the cross of lies
Religion spirits and lies
The dead will arise
Under the cross of lies

In blood religions drown
Fight for the holy crown
The priest betrayed forever damned
For the holy promised land

Don't try to save your life
No way out to survive
Immortal religion lie
For the faith forever die

Deadly sacrifice
We come from hell through the night
Again the dead will rise
Under the cross of lies
Religion spirits and lies
The dead will arise
Under the cross of lies
