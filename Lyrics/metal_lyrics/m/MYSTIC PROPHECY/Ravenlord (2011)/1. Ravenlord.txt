He looks with evil eyes
The devil in disguise
The dogs of Hell will rise
All the nations sacrifice
Creator of the lies
Death detractor crucified
With the demons in the night
No religion dead inside

For the crown he comes to fight, oh
From the underworld inside

The Ravenlord!

With blood he'll capture the sky
When the morning comes you will die
Reborn in the underworld
Hail the Ravenlord!
He is the ultimate sin
Evilized the demon within
Eternal master of the war
Hail the Ravenlord!

From the darkness they will rise
Will revenge and sacrifice
With the legion of the damned
Come to take the promise land
And the beast of Hell will rise
Hell on Earth will evilized
From the Hell reborn in flame
Satan is the real name

For the crown he comes to fight, oh
From the underworld inside

The Ravenlord!

With blood he'll capture the sky
When the morning comes you will die
Reborn in the underworld
Hail the Ravenlord!
He is the ultimate sin
Evilized the demon within
Eternal master of the war
Hail the Ravenlord!

The Ravenlord!

With blood he'll capture the sky
When the morning comes you will die
Reborn in the underworld
Hail the Ravenlord!
He is the ultimate sin
Evilized the demon within
Eternal master of the war
Hail the Ravenlord!

The Ravenlord!
The Ravenlord!
