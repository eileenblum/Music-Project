The wind blows through the sky
And I smell the blood of hate
A last pray to my Gods
When I hear the sound of blade
Rage out - Blood flows like a rain
Scream loud - My inner pain
Burn out - My soul in flames
Hellfire blood - Now will reign
For the crown
Kill again in the battlefield of hell
Hail!

In the night when the kings are falling
And the warriors fight for victory
In the night when the winds are howling
Reborn - the wings of destiny
In the night when the kingdoms burning
And the dead will write new history
In the night when the gates are falling
Reborn - the wings of destiny
The wings of destiny

We march under the flag of death
For the force of evil my last breath
Black scar in heaven far away
The earth embraced in flames today
Fire crush the sky
Dead again - Welcome back in hell
Hail!

In the night when the kings are falling
And the warriors fight for victory
In the night when the winds are howling
Reborn - the wings of destiny
In the night when the kingdoms burning
And the dead will write new history
In the night when the gates are falling
Reborn - the wings of destiny
