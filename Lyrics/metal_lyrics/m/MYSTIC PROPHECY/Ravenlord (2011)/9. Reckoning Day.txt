Witches in a long time before
Sacrifice the world in black
And now they're back with the infernal storm
They come back to me tonight
For my heart ad soul will fight
I don't try to run away
In this darkest judgement day

All my bridges now will burn
With the blackness comes the storm
For my sins the devil takes his thorn

Never try to betray his name
Never touch the burning flame
No religion on his way
Reckoning day
Ever in the crimson sky
With the wings of death will fly
On your knees go down and pray
Reckoning day

Now I'm standing here in the dark
From the devil I'm a part
Suicide and killing me
Shadow spirits set me free

All my bridges now will burn
With the blackness comes the storm
For my sins the devil takes his thorn

Never try to betray his name
Never touch the burning flame
No religion on his way
Reckoning day
Ever in the crimson sky
With the wings of death will fly
On your knees go down and pray
Reckoning day
