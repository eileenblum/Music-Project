Welcome here in the dark
Your heart and soul with the evil
A deadly part
Fallen down from the Heaven's gate to Earth, yeah
With broken wings you wait for recreation
The beast unleashed again, yeah
Free and wild without existing law
And write with blood my name on the snow
Deep down below

Every night you call my name
Every nightmare will never be the same
Sacrifice for you my life
From the darkness escape to survive
You, the devil in disguise
I surrender my soul, with you will rise
You betrayed my soul with lies
For my sins I pay the price
Through the eyes of the devil

He's back from the black
With rage unholy attack, yeah
Like a desert-storm in the night
Take revenge with a last fight
Now, he loves extermination
The creature again is alive, yeah
Monster of self-deception
Lost soul of God's creation
Deep down below

Every night you call my name
Every nightmare will never be the same
Sacrifice for you my life
From the darkness escape to survive
You, the devil in disguise
I surrender my soul, with you will rise
You betrayed my soul with lies
For my sins I pay the price
Through the eyes of the devil, yeah

Oh through the eyes of the devil, yeah

You, the devil in disguise
I surrender my soul, with you will rise

Every night you call my name
Every nightmare will never be the same
Sacrifice for you my life
From the darkness escape to survive
You, the devil in disguise
I surrender my soul, with you will rise
You betrayed my soul with lies!
Through the eyes of the devil, yeah

Oh through the eyes of the devil, yeah
