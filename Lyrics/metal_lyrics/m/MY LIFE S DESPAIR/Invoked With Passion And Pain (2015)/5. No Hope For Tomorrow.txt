[Lyrics: Larshus, music: Larshus]

Befuddled and confused, as my world comes crashing down
There is nothing to do to save it, only emptiness to be found

There's no hope for tomorrow, she lives for the day
I no longer love you, is all she would say

Things we shared mean nothing, the pain of empty dreams
Shattered, like a glass, the coldness of reality

There's no hope for tomorrow, she lives for the day
I no longer love you, is all she would say
There's no hope for tomorrow, she lives for the day
Sitting in this empty room all alone, wallowing in pain

Starting all over, just seems bleak to me
Without you here by my side, you're just dead to me

There's no hope for tomorrow, she lives for the day
I no longer love you, is all she would say
There's no hope for tomorrow, she lives for the day
Sitting in this empty room all alone, wallowing in pain
