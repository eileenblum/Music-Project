[Lyrics: Larshus, music: Larshus]

My search ends in vain, only my love for you remains
Trapped in these walls of hate, last wish for us to embrace
Crying, to see you again, to hold you in my arms
And dry this empty sorrow, of life and regrets

Regrets

My search ends in vain, only my love for you remains
Trapped in these walls of hate, last wish for us to embrace
Crying, to see you again, to hold you in my arms
And dry this empty sorrow, of life and regrets

Regrets

So many things, left undone
All hope for redemption, lost in the waning years
Memories, my nightmares, will not let me be
And my cries, are all I hear

No hope, no love
Doesn't matter anymore
Our pride and arrogance
Has done us all in
