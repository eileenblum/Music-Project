[Lyrics: Larshus, music: N. Sanity/Larshus]

Look up, you will see, the entirety
Ancient entities, dead from eons ago
They travel through space and time
Apparitions of the sky, corpses rotting slow

I gaze and marvel .... at our majestic scenery
Shadows of life long gone, how peaceful they seem
Swirling madness of chaos, the patterns they form
I long for longevity, echoing through eternity

Count them!
If you try
Count them......watch them die

I have seen them fall
I have seen them darkened
I have seen them dim
Falling again

I have seen them bright
I have seen them daunting
I have seen them inspire
Always haunting ...me

Look up, you will see, the entirety
Ancient entities, dead from eons ago
They travel through space and time
Apparitions of the sky, corpses rotting slow

Your eyes turn misty, as you gaze upon the ancient gore
You bask in their perceived warmth, knowing they exist no more

Stunned by silence, struck by awe
Revered through knowledge, death comes for all
A last silent glimpse, as the their fading light gleams
We gaze and wonder, hopelessness is all it seems
