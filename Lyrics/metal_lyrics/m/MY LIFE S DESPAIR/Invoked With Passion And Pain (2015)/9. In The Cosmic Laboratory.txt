[Lyrics: Larshus, music: Larshus]

The search for meaning, we all partake
This world, is built on fakes
The worst thing I can think, for all of us
Is to die alone, and alone is what I am

No meaning, no goals
And the chaos pursues
No god, no soul
As they try to control you

No meaning, no goals
And the chaos pursues
No god, no soul
I still love you

Days slip by, and the years removed
Our death, is coming soon
Random multiverse, seeking comfort in the sky
We only ask why!

We are the rats, in the cosmic laboratory
But that still makes god, the vivisectionist

[break down]

I can not cope with this emptiness
Your dark eyes ascend thee
If only I could find the one
If only I could hold the sun
If only...

I can not forgive your betrayal, your weakness
Sadness and grief to find
Anguish, disbelief
Great me with a smile

Where's God!
The creator who cares

Still hanging on, with no expectations long
I regret my existence
I dream of the end so near, it seems so clear
And suddenly, I would feel no pain!

No meaning, no goals
And the chaos pursues
No god, no soul
I still love you

We are the rats, in the cosmic laboratory
But that still makes god, the vivisectionist
We are the rats, in the cosmic laboratory
