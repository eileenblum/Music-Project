[Lyrics: Larshus, music: N. Sanity/Larshus]

Dark days, dark ways
You will find,
The suffering of humankind

A quest to know, about our past
Cosmically seek,
How history repeats

[Carl Sagan:]
In our tenure on this planet,
we have... accumulated dangerous, evolutionary baggage,
propensity for aggression, ritual, submission to leaders,
hostility to outsiders,
all of which puts our survival ...in some doubt.

Amidst wars and fear, I search for truth
Superstition reigns, and idiocy gains
With skeptical means, I can show you proof
Religious bigotry hate, the catalyst of our doom

Try to find, the patterns in the chaos
The suffering is eternal

Ancient stains, knowledge reclaimed
So obtuse,
Our leaders who abandon truth

Some can see, what lies ahead
Knowledge decrease,
Ignorance plus tech equals us deceased

Try to find, the patterns in the chaos
The suffering is eternal

Look to find, the patterns in the chaos
Our search is in vain

Seeking out, the patterns in the chaos
The suffering is eternal

Need to find, the patterns in the chaos
To calm my soul, but it's in vain

Here me cry, the patterns in the chaos
Our only hope is each other...sigh
