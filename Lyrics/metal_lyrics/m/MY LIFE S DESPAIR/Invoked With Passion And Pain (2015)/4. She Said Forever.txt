[Lyrics: Larshus, music: Larshus/N. Sanity]

Two winters, are what we shared
Forever, on your mind
Past feelings restrain me
As we kiss and embrace

You said you would love me forever

Callous by past lies
I concede my soul to you
Opened up and exposed
For you

I weep to hear you say....you don't love me

She said... Forever!
