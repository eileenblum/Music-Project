[Lyrics: Larshus, music: N. Sanity/Larshus]

What dastardly deeds men do
Religion, a crux delivering scars
They are coming

The peasants surround, they have come to take my life
With a holy resolve, they have come to rape my wife
Say I'm in league with the devil, a perverter of faith
Call me a deceiver, cheater, a non-believer
The trial will seal my fate

[whispers of witch]

Bound and gagged, the trial begins in haste
A circle is made, the men of cloth begin to debate
Say I'm in league with the devil, a threat to their control
Call me a deceiver, cheater, a non-believer
Only fire can cleanse the soul

As flames ignite, they will take our life, as flames ignite

I beg, I plea, he has never hurt anyone, nor me
A man of science, seeker of truth, with integrity

My love, my dear, they wont listen to me,
I will remember what you shown, watch the stars in secrecy

I am bound, as I scream my only pleas,
Fire surrounds, as the flames reach my knees,
I can't distinguish reality, I can't stop the pain,
I am choking, smoking, the crowd is poking,
As the flames sears through my brain
