[bonus track]

I barely even know your name yet somehow I am aware
As I reach out through the longest night I stand beside the flame
And in my dreams you're always there

Each day I wake up and take it as it comes
I make the best of each and every day
Under the moon one summer night an angel came beside me
I spoke to heaven till the early morning light

Have we gone too far? Is it wrong or right?
Are we over the edge? Is it day or night?
Like a shooting star 'cross the burning sky
Your flame is only in my dreams
Only in my dreams

Today I'm feeling somewhat satisfied
And choose to think that nothing's wrong
The empty road lies up ahead, what fortunes will it bring?
'Round every bend I see you standing there, I believe

Have we gone too far? Is it day or night?
Over the edge? Is it black or white?
Like a shooting star 'cross the burning sky
Your flame burns only in my dreams
Only in my dreams
You're only in my dreams

I barely know your name

Have we gone too far? Is it day or night?
Are we over the edge? Is it wrong or right?
Like a shooting star 'cross the burning sky
Your flame burns only in my dreams

Is it black or white? Are we over the edge?
Is it day or night?
Like a shooting star 'cross the burning sky
Your name is only in my dreams
You're only in my dreams
My dreams
You're only in my dreams
Only in my dreams
Only in my dreams
Only in my dreams
