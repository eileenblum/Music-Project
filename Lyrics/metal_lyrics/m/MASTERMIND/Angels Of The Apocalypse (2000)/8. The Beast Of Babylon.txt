Questions of faith as we're toe to the line
If you believe then you're all out of time
Trumpets are calling from angels on high
As the world drinks of the wine of Babylon

So it was written and so it was told
Prophets and demons, the beast takes control
Fire and hailstorms rain down from above
As the world drinks of the wine of Babylon
Of Babylon

Hear me
Spare me your pain
I have no time for this
Taste the wine upon my kiss
And leave me on my own
We all die alone

Hear me
Leave me on my own
We all die alone
