Close my eyes and pray for sleep
Perchance to dream of a quiet place of refuge
I cannot take it any more, I'm down upon the floor
I tremble on my knees and pray in vain

Clear my mind in search of peace
Beyond the chaos of the day
Pushing and pulling and tearing the fabric of my life away

As we face tomorrow's world, thunderbolts are being hurled
Upon the face of man, was this part of the plan?
On the wings of war, are we insane?
Pray in vain

And as I face my own mortality
And the door is open wide, our dreams have all died
As the pushing and pulling is tearing the fabric of my mind away

Facing tomorrow's world, thunderbolts are being hurled
Upon the face of man, was this part of the plan?
I tremble on my knees and pray in vain
Burn in flames
