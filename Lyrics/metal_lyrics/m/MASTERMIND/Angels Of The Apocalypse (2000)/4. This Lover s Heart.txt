I believed in you
There's time to find your missing lover
I believe in time to find our dreams

And this old photograph reminds me of you
So many memories I hold to be true
Shifting sands of time have torn us apart
Left a gaping hole in this lover's heart

Time will find your missing lover
I believe there's time to find our dreams

And this old photograph reminds me of you
So many memories I hold to be true
Shifting sands of time have torn us apart
Can't kill the memories in this lover's heart

Sweet lover, I cried over you
