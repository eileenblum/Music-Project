I will dance for you and take away your pain
And in return I ask for nothing
This gentle kindness I give to you for free
As all my wealth in truth amounts to nothing
But I have questions that will put you to the test
Without the answers my soul will never rest

The Queen of Sheba
In perfume and gold
She seeks the answers
Of wisdom untold

I kiss you softly to take away the pain
And in return I ask for nothing
But still I have these questions that weigh upon my breast
And without the answers my soul will never rest

The Queen of Sheba
In perfume and gold
She seeks the answers
Of wisdom untold
The Queen of Sheba
In perfume and gold
Has seen the answers
As a new world unfolds

The Queen of Sheba
In perfume and gold
Has seen the answers
Of wisdom unfold
The Queen of Sheba
Of riches untold
Has seen the answers
As a new world unfolds
