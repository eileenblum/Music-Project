I lift mine eyes towards the heavens
And I pray that the light I shall see
Lord grant me strength and the wisdom
And the will to fulfill my own destiny

'Cause now the rules have changed
And it's a different game
You never know what's coming 'til it hits you
They speak with tainted tongues
There's nowhere left for peace of mind
And when I go you know I'll really miss you

And when I close my eyes I hear the angels sing
Beyond tomorrow I have seen so many things
And when the race is run, the final day is done
I have to know at least I tried

It's the end of the world and we're all out of time
Over the limit and 'cross the line
Live for the moment, there's no turning back
To the worlds we've left behind
How could we be so blind?

Step back, take a moment to catch my breath
I have so many things to achieve before my death
I will ride the lightning, dance with kings
Kiss the sky on dragon's wings
Build an empire, save the day
In the background the clock still ticks away

And when I close my eyes I hear the angels cry
Cast off my worldly things I am prepared to die
And when the day is done, the final race is run
I have to know at least I tried

It's the end of the world and we're all out of time
Live for the moment, we're over the line
Way past the limit, there's no turning back
To the days we've left behind

And if you had it all to do over again
How many changes would you make before the end?
Please don't tell me, please don't show me
I don't want to know

It's the end of the world and we're all out of time
Over the limit and 'cross the line
Live for the moment, there's no turning back
To the things we've left behind

Ride the lightning, dance with kings
Kiss the sky on dragon's wings
Build an empire, save the day
In the background the clock still ticks away

Please don't tell me, please don't show me
I don't want to know
