I hear you crying
Out here on my own
I wish I could help you
'Cause I know what it is to be alone

Another day rolls in to night
As another night fades away
You would think by now I would have it down
It just don't seem to be the way

Don't know what's wrong with me
I think I'm losing my mind

There's a light in the distance
It's shining my way
From beyond the horizon
A million miles away
I see it clear as day

My face in the mirror
All twisted in pain
As we stand in the aftermath
Things will never ever be the same

Don't know what's wrong with me
I think I'm losing my mind
Can't stop what's happening
From taking all of my time

There's a light in the distance
It's calling my way (my way)
Far beyond the horizon
A million miles away
I'll be there one day

And the light in the distance
Will show me the way (show me the way)
Far beyond the horizon
I will be there one day

And the light in the distance
Is so far away
From beyond the horizon
A million miles away
I see it clear as day

The light in the distance
So far away
A million miles away
A million miles away
A million miles away

There's a light in the distance
So far away
So far away
A million miles away
