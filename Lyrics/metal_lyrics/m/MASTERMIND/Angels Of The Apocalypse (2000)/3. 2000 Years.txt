Oh Lord, why can't you hear my prayer, are you still there?
Oh Lord, why don't you heal our pain, I call your name
Oh Lord, it's been 2000 years

I have befriended Beelzebub, and well I
I have his message for you
If you pay close attention here
I could show you a thing or two
But your little minds and uniforms are oh so predictable
Soon I will tire of this game
And if you don't take your place beside me
I will watch you go down in flames

Oh Lord, why don't you heal our pain, I call your name
Oh Lord, we've shed so many tears

There's a promise of Paradise
The world we have yet to find
It only exists in our mind

We have a friend in Beelzebub who could show us a thing or two
But your buzz cut brain and uniforms are oh so predictable
Just like the apple you chew

Oh Lord, why don't you hear my prayer, are you still there?
Oh Lord, why can't you feel our pain, I call your name
Oh Lord, it's been 2000 years (2000 years)
Oh Lord, we've shed so many tears

There's a promise of Paradise
A place we will never find
It only exists in our mind
