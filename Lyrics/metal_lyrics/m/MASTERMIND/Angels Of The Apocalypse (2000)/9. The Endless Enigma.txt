Why do you stare, do you think that I care?
You've been misled by the thoughts in your head
Your words waste and decay
Nothing you say reaches my ears anyway
You never spoke a word of truth

Why do you think I believe what you said?
Few of your words ever enter my head
I'm tired of hypocrite freaks with tongues in their cheeks
Turning their eyes as they speak
They make me sick and tired

Are you confused to the point in your mind
Though you're blind can't you see you're wrong?
Won't you refuse to be used, even though you may know
I can see you're wrong?

Please, please, please open their eyes
Please, please, please don't give me lies

I've ruled all of the earth
Witnessed my birth, cried at the sight of a man
And still I don't know who I am

Are you confused to the point in your mind
Though you're blind can't you see you're wrong?
Won't you refuse to be used, even though you may know
I can see you're wrong?

Please, please, please open their eyes
Please, please, please don't give me lies

I've seen paupers as kings
Puppets on strings dance for the children who stare
You must have seen them everywhere

Each part was played but the play was not shown
Everyone came but they all sat alone
The dawn opened the play, breaking the day
Causing a silent hooray
The dawn will break another day

Now that it's done I've begun to see
The reason why I'm here
