Searching for perfection
they can't escape collection of fools
Following the faker
They cannot see the breaker of rules
One by one - down the line...
We have been deceived

There is no believing that the web
they have been weaving controls us
In the heat of crisis they're hoping
their devices will hold us
One by one - down the line...
We were told believe

Please take me from here
and show me I was wrong
And ease this burden of mine
From the promised land
comes this last command
Can you stand it? Can I?
