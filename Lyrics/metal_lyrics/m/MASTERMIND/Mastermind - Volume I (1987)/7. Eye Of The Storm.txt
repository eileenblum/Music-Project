I hear the thunder in the distance
Nowhere to hide nowhere to run
Now it's much too late for our escape
There's nothing we can do
But watch the darkness take the sun
From the eye of the storm....

We had a warning but
we chose to pay no mind
We though we knew just what to do
Now the satellite in deepest flight
The early warning eye
calls on the mighty Titan II
From the eye of the storm...
Caught in the eye of the storm...

I can't believe that we would
do this to ourselves
It's clear to see that we will
spend some time in hell...
Let me out
