Open your eyes great centurions
Motions reflected in the sky
Knowledge has dawned on your empire
Light shines unveiling the lies

Starships transcend mortal energy
Bringing the words of the wise
Am I the child of technology?
Pandora's box was opened for mine eyes

Our machines have paved the way
Have we earned the right to stay?
Will they lead us all astray?
Who can say?

Bring forth the promise of our destiny
Rising from the silos to the sky
Am I the child of technology?
Pandora's box was opened for mine eyes
