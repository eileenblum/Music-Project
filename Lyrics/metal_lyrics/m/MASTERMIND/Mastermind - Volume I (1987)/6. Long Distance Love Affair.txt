One thousand miles to the earth below
Achieving orbit and ready to go
We get the signal to start our flight
Now we're headed out across
the void of endless night

Long Distance Love Affair
Trace the signals through the air
And shout his name to the empty sky
You wait in the rain but there's no reply
He looks down from high on heaven
and says goodbye

How many years since you've seen his face
She lost her lover to the human race
She waited patiently but he never came
And they don't known if they're
ever gonna see him again

[Repeat chorus]

She looks out across the heavens
and wonders why

Is anybody out there? Can anybody hear me?
Is anybody listening? Is there anybody out there?
He looks out across the heavens and starts to cry

[Repeat chorus]

She looks out across the heavens
and starts to cry
