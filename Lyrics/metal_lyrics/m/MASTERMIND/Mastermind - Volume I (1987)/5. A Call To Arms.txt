The single man will fail to achieve where
others gone before preconceive the glory trail
Inspiration dwells in the hearts of many
who have read it in the charts, we cannot fail
Strong declarations, high expectations
A call to glory... a call to arms

Sacrifice your life for no reason, mortal sins
will not heal your treason... live to tell
Lightening strikes the hallowed ground
causing harmony of spirits will sound...
Ring the bell - Stand at the gates of hell

Strong declarations, high expectations
A call to glory... a call to arms

Victory, oh noble victory... we know our
cause is true now, it's clear we're right
Sympathies, oh holy sympathies...
For those who did not make it through last night
Following the call of the wild
we've shed our innocence, but like a child
We've lost our way... oh holy way

Cat's claw, nature's law, destiny
Eagle's flight, the signal light is clear
to lead the way... oh holy way

Strong declarations, high expectations
A call to glory... Your call to to arms
