I get around as a matter of fact
I got the wind in my sails and I'm not looking back
I feel it coming on strong everyday
I got the power, I'm gonna have it my way

So get down get dirty and cheap
I want to play around but I won't be beat
Why don't you show me your point of view
No matter what you say I know what I gotta do

Reach for the Sky - I want to go higher
Feel the heat from my desire
Reach for the Sky
We've got to find a way out of here...

So get down, get ready to rock
I think you'll be amazed at the size of my...
Cock and Bull is what the game is all about
So get ready, scream and shout

I've known the view from up on top
I liked what I saw and now I can't stop
I feel it coming on strong everyday
I got the power, I'm gonna have it my way

Reach for the Sky - I want to go higher
Feel the heat from my desire
Reach for the Sky
I think that we can make it from here

Reach for the Sky - I want to go higher -
I'll withstand their trail by fire
Reach for the Sky
We've got to find a way out of here...

I feel the call of the power and glory
I know tomorrow won't be the same
And if you ask me to tell the story
I'd have to say that I'd do it over again

You've got to give it just one more chance
You've got to give it another try
It's just a matter of time
before we master the game...
Ha!

[Repeat chorus]
