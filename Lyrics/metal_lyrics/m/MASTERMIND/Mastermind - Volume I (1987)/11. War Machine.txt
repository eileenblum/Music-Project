Trumpets calling, banners fly
The blades of battle gleam
March across one thousand miles
The glorious war machine

Voice of thunder shakes the land
The weak and helpless flee
Leave behind the living dead
The starving refugee

Triumph! Glory! Gifts from God!
Victorious our display
Leaving only death behind
The dawn of freedom echoes from this day
