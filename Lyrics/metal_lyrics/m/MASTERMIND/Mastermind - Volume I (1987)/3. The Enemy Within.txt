Is this an image we've created?
Or is it a reflection of a dream?
Only you can answer all these questions
Even when you don't know what they mean

You find yourself without direction
You can't remember what they said... No!
Can't take the pressure building in your head
Sometimes you wish you were dead

Don't look outside yourself
For the enemy lies within you
How can you handle all the pain?
And if you lose control to the enemy that is in you
We won't be seeing you again...

Now mother earth is slowly dying
The sacrifice is great but must be made
And you can hear their mothers softly crying
Their little boys are marching far away

You find yourself without direction
You can't remember what they said... No!
Can't take the voices filling up your head
Sometimes you wish that you were dead

[repeat chorus]

I can't see you there
