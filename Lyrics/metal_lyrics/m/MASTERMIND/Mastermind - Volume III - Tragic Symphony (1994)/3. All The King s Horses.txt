Now the storm has passed and the winds have died
As it blows all out to sea. Through it all I thought
that we could last, but it was not meant to be...

And all the king's horses and all the king's men
They cannot put our lives back together again
Goodbye... Goodbye...

Now the lighthouse beacon that shown me the way
is a light that shines no more. Will my ship be
dashed upon the rocks that lie in my path?
Or can I make it safely to the shore?

It's as if you thrust a dagger right through my heart
It's red hot blade, it tore me apart. Was it arrogance?
Vanity? Like a fool up high on the wall...
Who never thought he'd fall

And all the king's horses and all the king's men
They cannot put our love back together again
So I turn out the lights as I close the door
Cause I know that you won't be coming home anymore

Goodbye... I wish you well
Goodbye... From the depths of Hell

Goodbye... You've broken my heart
Goodbye... Can't believe we're apart
And all the king's horses and all the king's men
They cannot heal a broken heart, I pray that I can

Not all the king's horses and all the king's men
Not all the king's horses and all the king's men
