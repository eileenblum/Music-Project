One ship set sail today, with it went my heart
Silhouette disappears on the horizon
Now and forever... worlds apart.
Each breath grows harder to draw as bitter tears
run through my hands. God's truth I find in
solitude that no heart can understand

Without a Word... Without a sound
The curtain fell, no story left to tell
The fruit of love has withered on the vine

The shifting sands of time
Have eroded through the years
Your ship set sail that day upon a Sea of Tears

Each day that passes is one less day to be
Each breath brings us closer To where our
souls are free. But God in heaven...
Has never promised the sun without rain
A thousand hopes have been shattered
A thousand dreams have slipped away

One ship sailed... across the sea
On that ship my love took my heart from me
Two ships pass... in the night
They never saw each other
They're gone by morning light

The shifting sands of time
Have eroded through the years
My ship set sail today upon a Sea of Tears
