They say it's better to love and to lose
But I can't imagine a worse fate to choose
Perhaps it is better...
Never to have known love at all

The game was played and everyone lost
The stakes were too high, can't measure the cost
It might have been better...
Never to have played it at all

But fate has decided - it's over and done
The battles were fought - but nobody won
Like an unfinished symphony no one will play
Empty hearts have nothing left to say...

They say it's better to love and to lose
But I can't imagine a worse fate to choose
Perhaps it is better...
Never to have known love at all

But fate has decided - it's over and done
The battles were fought - and nobody won
Like an unfinished symphony no one can play
Empty hearts have nothing left to say...
Nothing left to say...
Empty hearts have turned and walked away...
