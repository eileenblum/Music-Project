If you listen to the wind you'll hear the song of the birds
Listen pure and simple, hear the wisdom in their words...
To fight or flee, you must be free, your hero is yourself
You'll find you have the courage and the strength to
put down hell's fires! If you cast out the doubt inside...
Stand up tall and walk with pride... Take on an inner
revolution... Change your heart and constitution...

But don't let anger or fear set your course or
guide your actions. Dare stand where no one can stand
in the light... Seek the Power and the Passion
The truth has a way of shining through

And as you lie in the night it weighs heavy on your mind
Searching for the answers and running out of time
Yet if you lead them they will follow
Stand up tall and show us all the way
Mistakes mean nothing! If you cast out the doubt inside
A frantic search for redirection...
A suitable cause for insurrection...

And does the sorrow of your day wilt the flowers of
compassion. Dare go where no one has gone
through the night... Seek the Power and the Passion
The truth has it's way of shining through

And when you've past through the night, taste the sweet
wine of satisfaction. Dare stand where no one can stand
in the light... Seize the Power and live with Passion
The truth has it's way of shining through
