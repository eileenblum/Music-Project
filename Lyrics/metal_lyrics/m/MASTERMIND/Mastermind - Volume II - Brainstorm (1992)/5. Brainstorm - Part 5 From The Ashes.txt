When all is lost, and the fire dies
And the sparkle has gone from your eyes
From the ashes new hopes arise
And beliefs that are true
And now you're finding out... it's up to you

You had the answers when you were young
Back when times were light and things were fun
You didn't hear the starting gun
Still your aim is true
And now it's all up to you...

You made your mind up...so long ago
Your path is clear to see, you know the way to go
I guess it only just goes to show
Still your aim is true
And now it's all up to you
