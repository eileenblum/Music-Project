You better run for cover
you better run and hide
You blend in with the others
'cause you're always changing sides
To he left... to the right
And when we're in trouble
You're nowhere in sight

Now you're a little bit older
but no wiser at all
How can you trust your instincts? Tell me...
Which way will it fall?

As it rains down fire
hell from above and below
It's getting down to the wire. Tell me...
Which way will you go?
To the left... to the right
And when we're in trouble
You're nowhere in sight
