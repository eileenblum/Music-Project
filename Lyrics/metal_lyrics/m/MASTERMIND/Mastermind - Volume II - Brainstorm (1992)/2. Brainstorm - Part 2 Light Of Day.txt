A life so simple
The vessel of your mind and soul
On a finite journey
Destination yet untold
Then off in the distance...
A light begins to shine
Shall we make sail for it?
Or shall we take our own sweet time?

And when you find a way
You'll be facing the new light of day

And through the days of darkness
And your eternal strife
Maintain a higher vision
Searching for a better life
And when the sirens call
Will they lead your ship astray?
Can you find the strength to carry on?
Is this the only way?

And when you make your play
You'll soon find a way
You'll be facing the new light of day
