Cruel fortune before me is tempting my fate
But I can see no end in sight
My tortured soul cries out in pain
Yet takes me farther away from the light

So many suns have set... the picture is fading
The dream is just alive
This never ending series of misfortune's affairs
Has shaken my will to survive

Detestable life...
You heed my desire, then whimsically take them away
You place my wildest dream...beyond my reach
And then laugh at me while I pray

Pray to my God...

Pray to God!
	O cave dominus veritas!
Obumbrata et velata
O cave dominus veritas!
Dominus obumbrata

Mistress of fate... so heartless and cruel
You know that I put up a fight
My wounded heart cries out in pain
Yet takes me farther away from the light

And so many suns have set... the picture has faded
The dream has finally died
This never ending series of misfortune's affairs
Has taken my will to survive

O cruelest fate... [refrain] Hear me God!
O miserable life... [refrain] Is there God?
