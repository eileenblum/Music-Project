The storm became a gentle rain
Healing waters ease the pain
All is not the same as before
Turn my heart into stone

I came in search of forgiveness
To atone for all of my sin
The burden that I will carry is buried within me

And woe is me... for I am he
Who suffers hard... for my sin
Please don't forget me (or my sin)

The wind has died, the earth is still
A cold and empty place to fill
And all I have are memories
Tell me where have you gone?

I go in search of the answer
To question all that I see
And all I find is darkness... why must it be?

And woe is me... for I am he
Who suffers hard... for my sin
Don't forget me
