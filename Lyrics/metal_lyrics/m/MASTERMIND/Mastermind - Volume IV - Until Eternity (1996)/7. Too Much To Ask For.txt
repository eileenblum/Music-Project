You know the story's told
Long before you get old and grey
You make your own mistakes
And now it's much too late to change them

I've had that invitation - it's so hard to decline
But you just can't stay away
Your brain went on vacation
there's nothing there to find
But you must find your way

And where you've you made your tracks
There is no turning back again
You chose the road yourself
You sat up on the shelf forever...

I've had that invitation - It's so hard to decline
But you just can't stay away
Your brain went on vacation
there's nothing there to find
But you must find your way

One more chance is all I'm asking
One more chance to set things right
Is this too much for me to ask for?
And will I ever get it right?
Before I die

Can you resist temptation
like you've never known before?
Or you just can't stay away?
Your brain went on vacation
your heart fell to the floor
And you can't find your way....

[repeat chorus]

Before I die
