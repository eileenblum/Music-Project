I never had the answers, I never had a plan
I don't know where I'm going but I do know where I am
And it's all so clear after all these years
I've cast off my burden and dried my tears

Now I dream my life away - I'll be OK
Dream my dreams all day - I'll work another day

And though they always told me I wouldn't go far
I'd never own a big house or a shiny new car, well
I guess that it's a good thing that your life isn't mine
I'm sorry if it bothers you but I'll be just fine...

How dare you! Think youâre different! Something special!
Just who do you think you are?
As I dream my life away - I think I'll be OK
Dream my dreams all day - What can I say?

I'm living in a dream world, I know that I do
But I've known what I wanted my whole life through
And I'd give anything to make it true for a moment
Can't you see?

Now I dream my life away - I'll be OK
Dream my dreams all day - I'll work another day
Dream my life away, Dream my life away
