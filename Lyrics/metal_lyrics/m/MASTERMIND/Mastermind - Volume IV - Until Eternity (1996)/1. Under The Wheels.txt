There were five more murders in the city today
That makes 400 this year and it's only May
And they wonder why I have anxiety attacks
As I light up a cigarette and try to relax

Then some punk downtown breaks my jaw with a rock
So now I stay home and keep my doors locked
My next door neighbor he decided to cope
With a high powered rifle applied to his throat

This isn't the world I was promised as a child
With corporate and government greed gone wild
Now it's clear to see it's all lies we've been taught
As we're thrown under the wheels... of the juggernaut

Will you just stand there and watch the world in flames?
And point your finger at the one they say to blame
With all their answers enforced by massive wealth
It's their intention to protect you from yourself
See you in hell...

And government cures only make things worse
While they take their pay raise right out of your purse
And the poor have nothing but anger and hate
And murderous rage at their injust fate

And the world has become a far more dangerous place
As we fight for possession, religion, and race
You can see now it's all lies we were taught
As we're thrown under the wheels... of the juggernaut
