Time comes upon us when everything must change
And in the aftermath and the rubble that remains
It all seems so hopeless with nowhere left to turn
Under the gun and down to the wire,
it seems you would have learned
And where are the reasons that once stood out so clear?
In a haze of compromise they've all seemed to disappear

When the winds of the tempest... tear your world apart
Stay true to what you believe and follow your heart...

As the sun beats down upon your back in burning pain
Crawl across the desert sands, it all seems so in vain
Reach for the highest heights but pray don't fall from Grace
It's not so important if you win or if you loose the race
Will the winds of the tempest tear your world apart ?

And now the storm is gone - the winds have passed
The Sun will shine and I am free at last
I'm free at last...
In in my past...

When the winds of the tempest... tear your world apart
But no need to be afraid if you follow your heart
Follow your heart...
