There were times when I was angry
but they really weren't so bad
Cause I never could seem to stay mad at you
And sometimes I get lonely and feeling sad
but I always had hopes to hang on to you

Like a beacon of hope that has
cut through the dope and the circumstance
Like a light at the end of the tunnel
if your willing to take the chance
One step closer

Time passes slowly and never seems to change
Face each day on down the line
When there's nothing left to do but pray for rain
Change the water into red wine

And a beacon of hope has
cut through the dope and the circumstance
Like a light at the end of the tunnel
if your willing to take the chance

One step closer - to your heart's desire
Feel the fires again
One step closer - take a chance on you
For a love as true... on earth as it is in heaven.
