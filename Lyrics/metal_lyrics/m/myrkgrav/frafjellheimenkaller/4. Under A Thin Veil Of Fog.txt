A thin veil of fog
inbetween the trees, hiding a secret from below
At the swamplike ground of this wood
a secret layes, which has never been told

For too many years
it has rested here,
but now it is building up again
This dark, evil force gathers for attack,
it is now ready to possess our souls again

In the future from now
everything will be only suffering and death
Pain will prevail, the only thing we can feel
The time of joy is over,
suffering is to come.
From this dark, unholy place suffering is to come forever!
