Det var mye som var vondt, og mye som var gÃ¦li
Men en gang i tia, sÃ¥ dansa dem bekhette
Var dem plaga grÃ¥dig av skurv, og ikke orka Ã¥ leva...

Det var en liten legdegutt
Og alt dem skrubba
SÃ¥ vart'n ikke rein
Dem bekabredde heile huet pÃ¥'n
Og han fikk slik ei lue
Som skulle sitta heilt tel'n hadde vÃ¸ksi fast

Dem hadde en tom i taket
Og en i lua au
Dem stelte gutten oppÃ¥ en stol
Men den sparka dem vekk under beina pÃ¥'n

Da vart bÃ¥de hÃ¥r og hud rivi tor skallen pÃ¥'n
Og bare raude kjÃ¸ttet var att
Dem mÃ¥tte gjÃ¸ra det sÃ¥nn sies det
For hadde dem drii smÃ¥tt, hadde'n ikke tÃ¥lt det

Ã'n budde, og Ã¥'n hette, det var glemt for lenge sia
Dem brydde seg ikke om Ã¥ husse legdegutt, kan du veta
Men hÃ¥ret og huden, det fekk'n att

[English translation:]

To Dance With The Pitch-Hood

Many things were bad and many others were crazy
But once they make them dance with the pitch-hood
They were fiercely tormented by the ringworm, and didn't desire to live on

There was a harvest-boy
And however they scrubbed him
They didn't manage to clean him
They smeared the whole head with pitch
And put a cap on him
That should stay until all firmly overgrown

They had a hook on the ceiling
And one on the cap too
They fixed the boy on a chair
But kicked it away from below his legs

Both hair and skin were torn off the boy's skull
And only red flesh was left
They said they had to do like this
Because if they had to do it meticulously, he would have never tolerated it

Where he lived, what was his name, this was forgotten time ago
They didn't care to remember a harvest-boy, you know
But hair and skin, they grew again
