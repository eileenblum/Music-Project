Et sted uti skauen her
Et sted ute av manns minne
For lenge sia brant ei mil
For lenge sia fretta kÃ¸labrenner'n

Tre skygger ut av natta en gang kom
Tre karer tynne som stÃ¦lker
Bleike som skrÃ¸mt dem var
Bli med vÃ¥rs, dem lokka

KÃ¸labrenner hÃ¸r pÃ¥ vÃ¥rs
Krass som du enn er
Fri deg sjÃ¸l fra en hastig dÃ¸d
FÃ¸lg vÃ¥rs inn i skauen

Ingen med vett i behold
Ingen anna enn dÃ¥ra
FÃ¸lger skrÃ¸mta inn i skauen
Enda fÃ¦rre kjem att med livet kjÃ¦rt

Lei av brennern's motvilje
Lokka tebakat av skauen
Atter inn i mÃ¸rket forsvann dem
Aldri sÃ¥g han dem igjen

Sola gjekk atter over fjellet opp
Snart var vinteren til endes
SÃ¥ kom da'n sÃ¸nnen hass
Sku smis i hymens lenker

Kort om spellemenn varre heme
Karre seg over Steinsfjorden han mÃ¥tte
Aldri sku han komma igjen
Aldri finni blei hass legeme

Grein det gjorde de nÃ¦rmaste
Gjennom isen han mÃ¥tte ha gÃ¥tt
Hastig kom endelektet tel
Han som skrÃ¸mta ikke lokka hem

[English translation:]

Three Shadows Came To The Charcoal Burner

A place in the wood
A place out of man's memory
Since a long time a charcoal kiln burns
Since a long time the charcoal burner knows it

Three shadows once came at night
Three persons as thin as a flower stalk
They were as pale as ghost
Come with us, they allure

Charcoal burner listen to us
However loathsome you are
Free your soul from a rapid death
Follow us in the wood

Nobody with a little sense in his head
Nobody else than a fool
Would have followed the ghosts in the wood
Few came back alive

Tired of the charcoal burner's reluctance
They came back in the wood
They disappeared again in the dark
He saw them never more

The sun goes up again over the mountains
Winter was coming to an end
His son arrived
He had to get married

Shortly the musician was at home
He had to come across the Steinfjord
He would never come back again
His body never to be found

His closest relatives wept
He possibly fell through the ice
He came rapidly to his end
He who the ghosts didn't invite home
