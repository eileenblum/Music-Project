I see your end
You rotting in your sins
Believe me when I say stop it
before you die
But now stand up and look in my eyes
And come with me
We'll go back to reality

Back to reality -
out of the circle back into your life
Back to reality -
out of the spirit into your mind
Back to reality -
out of the chains of the slave
Back to reality...
You live in a circle where you can't escape

Don't look back but follow me
to the other side

But now stand up and look in my eyes
And go with me
We're going back to reality

Back to reality -
out of the circle back into your life
Back to reality -
out of the spirit into your mind
Back to reality -
out of the chains of the slave
Back to reality...

[Solo]

Back to reality -
out of the circle back into your life
Back to reality -
out of the spirit into your mind
Back to reality -
out of the chains of the slave
Back to reality...
