White walls white coats
Tubes of death in my arms
Why am I living?
Not being with him?

We've planned to die voluntarily
But now I open my eyes to see
that aren't free

I am running away
From this world to another one
Where my loves waiting for me
To touch me to hold me to kiss me
I am coming!

Addicted to heroin
But our love so splendid
Chosen death with a clear mind
Why did you come to rescue me?

We've planned to die voluntarily
But now I open my eyes to see
that aren't free

I am running away
From this world to another one
Where my loves waiting for me
To touch me to hold me to kiss me
I am coming!

[Solo]

We've planned to die voluntarily
But now I open my eyes to see
that aren't free

I am running away
From this world to another one
Where my loves waiting for me
To touch me to hold me to kiss me
I am coming!
