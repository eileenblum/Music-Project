The times strange eyes
Without our souls
A ship of fools
Like my toys

Can't see the sign
Birds fall from the sky
Into our minds

Lay and die time to heal
Look and steal nowhere to hide

The hate controls our mind
True lies and opening hands
Believing and searching, respecting
But what's to respect

Lay and die time to heal
Look and steal nowhere to hide

Oh... Save this world!
Oh... Save this world!
