Your work is done and you feel tired
Again you start your long way home
You think of nothing inspiration is your key
to the new world

You're asking why
Now I have to be afraid to die?
This bloody madness
Is systemized!

This never ending dreaming
Of harmony in this dying world
This never ending dreaming
Scream it out what you think!

These never ending dreaming
Of harmony in this mystic world
These never ending dreaming
Scream it out what you feel!

Look in her eyes
You can see lies
People cry don't live this life

You're asking why
Now I have to be afraid to die?
This bloody madness
Is systemized

This never ending dreaming
Of harmony in this dying world
These never ending dreaming
Scream it out what you think!

This never ending dreaming
Of harmony in this mystic world
These never ending dreaming
Scream it out what you feel!

There's the need to join together
Inside your mind
You see the reign of blood
You see the end

[Solo]

This never ending dreaming
Of harmony in this dying world
This never ending dreaming
Scream it out what you think!

This never ending dreaming
Of harmony in this mystic world
This never ending dreaming
Scream it out what you feel!
