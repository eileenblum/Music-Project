Pushing and raging your power
starts fading
Your head aches
Trying so hard to please anyone else
Your head aches
Running and hiding
you just keep on winding up
Your reputation
Under surveillance from liars and fakes
No liberation

Weight of emotion
the pressure keeps rising
Your head aches
Still someone out there
is pointing his fingers
Your head aches
Caught in a circle that's made out of agony
And resignation
You keep on spinning around
and around again
No destination

All... all my dear enemies... all
All my dear enemies... all
All...

Tired of fighting and tired of hiding
Your head aches
Just turn your back on all liars and fakes
Your head aches
Running and hiding
you just keep on winding up
Your reputation
Under surveillance from liars and fakes
No liberation

All... all my dear enemies... all
All my dear enemies... all
All...

[Solo]

All... all my dear enemies... all
All my dear enemies... all
All...
