Can you cure my sickness
Can you wash away the sins
Can you take hold of me
Can you keep the beast within

Now, do you hear the voices
As I kneel in front of you
Now, do you hear them calling
Calling out to pull me through

Where were you when I needed a friend
Where were you my friend

Can you fight the power
Can you push away the night
Can you strike the forces
Color black just shines so bright

Now, as I cross the barricades
Will you try to hold me back
Now, as they turn the lights off
Will you leave me lost and torn

Lost and torn... Is in my soul
Lost and torn...
Lost and torn... is in my mind
Lost and torn...

Where were you when I needed a friend
Where were you my friend

Where were you when I needed hope
Where were you my friend

[Solo]

Where were you when I needed a friend
Where were you my friend
Where were you when I needed hope
Where were you my friend
