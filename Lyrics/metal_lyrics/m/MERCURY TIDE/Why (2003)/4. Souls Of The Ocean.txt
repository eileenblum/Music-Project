I close my eyes
I feel my life is over
Candlelight surrounds me

An appearance leads me into the light
The light of nowhere
I am ready for this way... I'll go

I stand here in the circle of the sunrise
I hear the voices freeing

An appearance leads me into the light
The light of nowhere
I am ready for this way...

I see - I feel the light of heaven
I see - I see the point of entry
I see - I see the souls of the ocean
Now... now... now...

I see the light
The light from the ocean
I see my own reflection

An appearance leads me into the light
The light of nowhere
I am ready for this way.. I go

[Solo]

I see - I feel the light of heaven
I see - I see the point of entry
I see - I see the souls of the ocean
Now... now... now...
