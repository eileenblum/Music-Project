From nowhere to the other side
Where the sun shines so bright
I feel like a morning star

A new skin it's hard but thin
The dream has come true
And the place it's new

The time has come I see the heaven
The time has come to change my mind

Set me free - I'm running into the sunrise
Let me free - My private hell behind

Broken mirror on the floor
I walk over the broken pieces

The time has come to see the heavens
The time has come to change my mind

Set me free...
Set me free...

[Solo]

The time has come to see the heavens
The time has come to change my mind

Set me free...
Set me free...

Set me free...
Set me free...
