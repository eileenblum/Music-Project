A new day has come
After a lonely night
Why have you left me alone

I can never be alone
So let me share your life
Why have you left me alone
Yet another time

Time is passing by so fast
I can only look at you
I don't want to walk alone
Through the time to come
It's such a sad reality
That I can never be alone
So hear my voice
I call your name

I know that I was born
I was born
I was born for someone
So tell me why I was born
Why I was born
Born for anyone
So tell me why

Where do I find myself
All night and day
It's dark, it's cold
So hear my voice
I feel like a faded leaf on a tree
I'll fall down
Please catch me now

I know that I was born...
