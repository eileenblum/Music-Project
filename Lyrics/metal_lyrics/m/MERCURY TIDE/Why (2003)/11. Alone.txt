Is it life
Is it hope
Or is it a long way to heaven

For one dream
For the pride
Of the new generation

Where's the place in the clouds
Where's the place in the shadows
I'm falling over and over again

Come back and tell me something
Give me a chance for my life
The last time over descent
Take my hand and leave me not alone

Is it right
Is it wrong
Or is it confusion what I've done

When I cry
When I fall
In the depths of fear

Where's my place in the clouds
Where's my place in the shadows
I'm falling over and over again

Come back and tell me something
Give me a chance of my life
The last time over descent
Take my hand and leave me not alone

[Solo]

I'm falling down in the depths of fear
I'm falling over again

Is it right
Is it wrong
Or is it confusion what I've done

For one dream
For the pride
Of the new generation

Where's my place in the clouds
Where's my place in the shadows
I'm falling over and over again

Come back and tell me something
Give me a chance of my life
The last time over descent
Take my hand and leave me not alone
