You talk too much and I guess I've walked too rough
In these scuffed dark shoes you're never wearing socks
Being you, and being me sometimes it's tough
I'm battered and bruised up, but I got myself bandaged up
You on the other hand are damaged and stuck in a rut
You never grew up, managed to never do much
And from this vantage point I have the advantage in guts
Something you lack, but I still wish you luck
You scrub

I've seen the fall of many men,
I've watched my own decline, I wasn't ready then
As I sit now I can't stay in I've got to walk from you my heavy head?
You wished the worst for me and my many friends
So it will be hard to forgive and not forget
You probably wish you still could play your only hand
I guess I swallowed that hard pill to be the bigger man

You reap what you sow, so don't speak about what you don't know
You reap what you sow, so don't speak about what you don't know

Giving in's a virtue, new to me
I'm still searching for patience, selfishly
Honestly, I do this for my family
Lucky for you, I'm not the man I used to be
You're not worthy of being my enemy
You're not worthy of being much of anything
But you deserve a second chance like anything
Like anyone but maybe not for everything

You reap what you sow
You reap what you sow
You reap what you sow, so don't speak about what you don't know
You reap what you sow, so don't speak about what you don't know

You talk too much, but I guess you've had enough
Just being you is rough and you look used and mangled up
I won't kick you while you're down abuse and bang you up
No, I'll pick you up, confused, now? Well that's just why
This world's gone to [?] don't say much
Can't get stuck on a ways how I've grown up
I've shown up and now it's time to show you what's up

Because we reap what we sow
