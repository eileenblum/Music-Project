["Ball Of Destruction" Re-Recording]It's my life and I'll do what I want
It's my life and I'll say what I want
Its my life and I'll do what I care
It's my life and I'll shave my hair

You turn it around, you turn it around
Your turn in my life, upside down

It's my life and I'll do what I want
It's my life and I'll say what I want
Its my life and I'll do what I care
It's my life and I'll shave my hair

You turn it around, you turn it around
Your turn in my life, upside down
