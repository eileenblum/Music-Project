I woke up from a dream today, I thought of you Jay
I looked up at the clock, it read 2:22
I know that you are here with me, like every day
Still I miss you, in every way
Your coolness, your presence
I'll see you on the other side someday

[Chorus:]
Until then, I'll honor you my friends
Your spirit will always live
It will live through me
Until then, you have gone but you're not forgotten
You're more than a memory
You will always be a part of me

I was on the east side today, and I thought of you Mike
I had a drink, said a prayer, wiped my face
I knew that you were there with me, like every day
Still I miss those, good old days
Your laughter, your presence
I'll see you on the other side someday

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Until then I will you in every way that I can
Until then I will be missing you my friends
Until then
