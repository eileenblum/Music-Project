I've been waiting a long time to give you a piece of my mind
You can run, but you can't hide
From who you are inside, and you don't wanna confront me
NO!
I know your kind, you've been running the same old lines
Getting over on young minds
You'll see it's only a matter of time
You're gonna have to confront me

[Chorus:]
'Cause we're all in this game
But don't believe that loyalty comes for free
You only get respect when it's given out
Make no mistake - you're the enemy
Make no mistake - you are my enemy

Still here after many hard years
When will you realize, you can't kill what won't die?
'Cause they've tried, but the strong survive
I'm only telling you one time
Still living the lie
Your bitter cries and words are getting tired
How can you talk with that closed mind?
You passed judgment, you've crossed this line
And you'll never confront me

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Sick of the back-talk
You don't know me
I never back off
'Cause you're my enemy
