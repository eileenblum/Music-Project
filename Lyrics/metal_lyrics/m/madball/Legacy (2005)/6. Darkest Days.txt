You were the light in the darkness that I lived in full of redemption and sin
Even though I was surrounded by the best of friends
My future was looking dim
You gave me hope in a time when I lost control
About to lose my soul
You picked me up from the gutters that I once roamed
Helped my see what I now know
When I thought there was no one there for me
Your light shined on me
You gave me hope
You gave me all I need
You set me free
When I fought against myself, to be as good as I can be
You gave me strength; you gave me what I need
Youâre everything to me
In the darkest of days you came into my life
It was full of so much strife
Self-destruction was the name of the game that I played
You reinforced the values that I had lost
At no price or cost
And even when I slipped into the darkness again
You fought to bring me back in
I hope you know what you mean to me
You mean everything
I hope you know that
Iâd do anything for you, I mean anything
You made a man out of me
When I thought I knew it all
I knew nothing
You brought me hope in my darkest days
I love you more than anything
When I thought there was no one there for me
Your light shined on me
You gave me hope, you gave me all I need
You set me free
When I fought against myself to be as good as I could be
You gave me strength
You gave me all I need
Youâre always there for me
