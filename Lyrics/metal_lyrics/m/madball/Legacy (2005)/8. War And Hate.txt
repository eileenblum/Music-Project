In a world full of war and hate
What do you think, is there any salvation?
Is there any hope for the future in these times of the revelations?
In this world that we can't escape
Have we exceeded our expectations?
Have we gone too far with technology to protect our nations?

[Chorus:]
(I speak) for me and my generation
I have to ask these questions
(For them) for me

In this world full of war and hate
All we can do is ask these questions
I pray for the best
The future is not yours, mine, or anyone's
On the eve of our destruction
Has anyone asked us
How do we feel about the future of humanity?
This is insanity

[Chorus:]
(I speak) for me and my generation
I have to ask these questions
(For them) for me
For everyone

What is this world comin' to?
That is the question that I have to ask all of you
All of you who hold the proof and the world in the palm of your hands
Well it's not one country, it's not one man
It's all of you who spread the fear
You desire to control it all
Make your choices wisely, or we're dead as planned
