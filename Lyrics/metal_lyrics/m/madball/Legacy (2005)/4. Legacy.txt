I've been around for some time now
And I really don't care what some people think about me
I've been called a lot of things
Some good, some bad
I've had many people doubt me
I'm not ashamed of anything
When it comes to this
I stay true to the game
And when the flames were burning slow
I grabbed the torch and let everybody know
What the music, the scene means to me
With pride and sincerity
Handed down by our brothers
Is this our legacy?

I've been around the world and back again
I've had the privilege of watching this grow,
Transcend beyond the streets, the clubs, the trends
Beyond anything we had imagined
That's what the music, the scene means to me
Pride and integrity
Handed down by our brothers
Is this our legacy?

Legacy
This is our legacy

It's an honor for us
For me
To stand side by side with those who paved the way for me
It's an honor for us to see
So many showing respect
Even those who doubted me
And it's only the beginning
That's what the music, the scene means to me
Pride and integrity
Handed down by our brothers
This is our legacy!
