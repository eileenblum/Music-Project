I won't walk away from you, not like this
I have unfinished business
We went away for a minute, I know
Two years and a minute I suppose, here we go
Back on this journey again
For worse or for better, we came to make amends
With ourselves, our friends, and our families
This is for them

[Chorus:]
I've seen a lot of changes (a lot of changes)
Within ourselves, within our scene
I'm not trying to rearrange things
There's only one way I can say this (I can say this)
We've come back for the crown
It's time to claim it

It's only begun, the second chapter of what's to come
We're not done, we strayed for a minute, I know
It's time we let everybody know, here we go
We're back on this grind again
For worse or for better, we came to represent
Ourselves, and our friends, our families
This is for them

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Where there's love there's always hate
Where there's respect there's always envy
We know some wanna see us fail
We won't stop 'til I get what's mine
We've stood the test of time
Now we will prevail
We came for the crown

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
This is the last time that I say this
We are here for the crown
It's time to claim it
