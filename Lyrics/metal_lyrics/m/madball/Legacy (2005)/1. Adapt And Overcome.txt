Your worst enemy is yourself
Who do you believe in?
Well I believe, I believe in me
Will you fight, or give in?
I'll stop at nothing, to be something
Who do they believe in?
In themselves, they believe in me
How will you lead them?
By making something out of nothing

Self doubt has been getting the best of me
For way to long
I've been fighting this, fighting this all my life
Now I'm ready for it to be gone
I know I have the courage
I know I have the strength too
I know I have the will
The power to do what I want to do

Adapt and overcome
Rise above all those mistakes and flaws
I'll learn from it, and then
I'll climb every obstacle and every wall

Who do you believe in?
Believe in yourself now
Who do you believe in?
Well I believe, I believe in me
Will you fight, or give in?
I'll stop at nothing, to be something
Who do they believe in?
In themselves, the believe in me
How will you lead them?
By making something out of nothing
