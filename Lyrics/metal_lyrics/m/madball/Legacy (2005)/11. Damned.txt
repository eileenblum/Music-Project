Another night turns into day
I haven't slept yet, but I'm okay
See if you dabble with fire, there'll be hell to pay
I might as well have a drink to wash away the pain
More cocaine, the devil's in my system, he won't go away
My mind wanders further but I'm not insane
This is just my life, my reality
I've got my pistol on the side of my waist
Don't start no shit and I won't shoot up the place
My aim's kinda bad and my eyes are glazed
But I brought extra clips just in case

[Chorus:]
Here I am again on the lower east side
Doing my thing, I'm damned
DAMNED! Yes I am
Another night full of crime and sin, so damned
DAMNED! Here I am
Night after night breaking night again, I'm damned
DAMNED! And I can't get myself out of this rut I'm living in

Another day turns into night
I'm running on fumes, but I'm alright
At least that's what I tell myself every day
I might as well have another drink to wash away the pain
More cocaine, the devil's got a grip and he won't get away
My mind is an altered state
But I'm still the same person I used to be, right?

[Chorus]
