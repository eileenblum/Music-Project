I don't believe in this segregation
This separation, that's not a part of our scene
We're a part of the same thing
Whatever happened to unity?
Don't point your fingers in any direction
We all have different beliefs
That's just a fact of life, reality
Who do you think you are with that elitist mentality?

[Chorus:]
LIVE YOUR OWN LIFE!
Don't be the judge of me
THINK TWICE! Before you tell me how to be
WHO'S RIGHT? who's wrong?
Doesn't matter to me
IT'S MY LIFE!
So don't say nothing

I hope you're listening, pay attention
I'm not one to preach, but if you're reading these words
Then listen carefully, I'll tell you what I don't belief
I don't believe in discrimination, in degradation
I don't judge by look, what you eat or drink doesn't matter to me
It's about respect, equality

[Chorus]

[Second chorus:]
LIVE YOUR OWN LIFE!
Don't be the judge of me
THINK TWICE! Before you tell me how to be
WHO'S RIGHT? who's wrong?
Doesn't matter, you see
IT'S MY LIFE!
So don't pass judgment on me

I'm trying to let you know
Don't let get ignorance get the best of you
Tear down these walls, they have to fall
You can't divide us
HARDCORE! Unite us!

[Chorus]
[Second chorus]

LIVE YOUR OWN LIFE!
LIVE YOUR OWN LIFE!
LIVE YOUR OWN LIFE!
LIVE YOUR OWN LIFE!
