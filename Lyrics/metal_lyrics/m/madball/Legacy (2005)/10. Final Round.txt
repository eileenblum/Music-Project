Sometimes I feel I'm against the ropes
Fighting for my life
Give me just a second to rest
I'll come back with an overhand right
I can't let circumstances get me down
Or knock me out
I've been in too many scuffles
Way too many bouts

[Chorus:]
FIGHT! There is no mercy for the helpless in this life
FIGHT! Whatever hand you're dealt, you should be ready to fight
FIGHT! Never surrender, keep your guard up all the time
FIGHT! Always remember, everything worth having is worth the fight

Here I am still sticking and moving
Sometimes I don't know what I'm doing
My instincts tell me to just keep throwing the jab
In this life situations sometimes get you down
But if you're not out, there's no excuses
Get up and fight now

[Chorus]

Get up and fight!

I don't have the answers
But I'm still in the fight
I've bob and weave then land a few
And I feel alright
You have to seize the moment
Or at least you have to try
Create opportunities for yourself
In this ring of life

[Chorus]
