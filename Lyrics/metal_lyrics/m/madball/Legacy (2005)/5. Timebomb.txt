I see the look in your eyes now
You can't disguise it
I've been there many times myself
The thought alone is antagonizing
Don't self destruct now
You're a time bomb ticking away
Don't let that anger control your fate
It's not too late

I've gotta call it how I see it
I see myself in you
I've gotta call it how I see it
Friend or foe
I speak the truth

I've gotta call it how is see it
Its part of me and you
I've gotta call it how I see it
Cause I've got nothing to prove

I feel the hate in your heart kid
It's eating you alive
You're gonna take it out on everyone
Until you bump into the wrong guy
Don't self destruct now
Live to learn another day
Don't let that anger force my hand this way

I've gotta call it how I see it
I see myself in you
I've gotta call it how I see it
Friend or foe
I speak the truth

I've gotta call it how I see it
Its part of me and you
I've gotta call it how I see it
Until this time bomb is diffused

I'm not telling you to back down
Cause you should always stand your ground
We have to pick and choose our battles now
Are you sure you wanna go all out?

Cause I can be a time bomb too
And if you light my fuse
I will unload
If you ignite my fuse
I might explode
Don't light my fuse
