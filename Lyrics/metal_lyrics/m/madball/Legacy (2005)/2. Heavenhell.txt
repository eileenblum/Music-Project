God help me
Guide me towards righteousness Lord, once again
Please give me back the innocence of my youth
That was taken from me so long ago
Out of my control
I do not lay the blame on anyone
Only you can save my soul,

I'm calling
I'm calling out, I'm calling, is anyone listening?
I'm calling
I'm calling out, I'm calling, are you listening?
'Cause I'm trying to fight it with all my heart and soul,
Strength and hope, is it all my fault?
I can't deny it, sometimes I lose control
I lose all hope

God save me now
From my past and present sins once again
Please give me the peacefulness of my youth
That I've never had
I keep it all inside, for the sake of pride
I will not disrespect my family
Only you know what I hide

I'm calling
I'm calling out, I'm calling, are you listening?
'Cause I'm trying to fight it with all my heart and soul,
Strength and hope, is it all my fault?
I can't deny it, sometimes I lose control
I lose all hope

Until then, it feels like
I'm caught between
Heaven and Hell

Please take away the sins of me and my father
Give me the strength to prevail
If you forgive me, then I'll forgive myself
