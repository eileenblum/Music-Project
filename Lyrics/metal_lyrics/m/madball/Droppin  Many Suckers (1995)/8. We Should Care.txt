What is this world coming to
There's no faith, there's no hope
People live in fear, and kill and ask why die?
What is this world coming to
I can't believe what you're trying to do
You're killing people all time
And not paying for your crime,
What is this world coming to
I can't believe what you're trying to do
You're killing people all the time
And not paying for your crime
Look at me and look at you
You think we're all same
But don't you know
We're different in your own way
Do you got that fucked up attitude?
You say you don't care
But we all need unity for all of us
To share no faith, no hope,
Live, kill why die!
Why don't you go fuck yourself and let me live my life.
Blah!!!
