Hang out with me then you stab me in the back
Are you friend or foe
See me on the streets you walk right by me
Are you friend or foe
Tell me on the phone that I'm a fucking clone
Are you friend or foe
Why don't mind your own life and leave me alone
Are you friend or foe
Friend, foe
Are you my friend or foe?
