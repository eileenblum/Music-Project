Here I'll put it to you
Before we fight
I need to step to you
To prove I'm right
I never leaked a drop of loyalty
I never lost my hate and purity
You say you're down and out and I'm to blame
But all there ever was
Was shame in your game
Never will we battle or bleed for you again
Never will we swallow our pride for your revenge
I guess you never had it in your heart
You never had our back you were destined to part
You played yourself out
Flashing true colours
Proving that bit of doubt to your brothers
Suckers like you run in and out of jams and pretty soon your luck will end
