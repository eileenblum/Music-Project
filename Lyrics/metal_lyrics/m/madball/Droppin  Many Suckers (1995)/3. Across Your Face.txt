So in your eyes we've always been the bad guys
Dropping false knowledge
You're just full of lies
You misled our youth to distract them with fantasy
But your plan backfired
Blew out intro reality
I've taken on losers like you in the past
So why should I stoop to your sorry ass
I thought you were my friend but you only showed me disgrace
I'll slap you with reality across your face
