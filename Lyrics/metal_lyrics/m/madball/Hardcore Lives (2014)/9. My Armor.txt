So much drama
So much hate
In this world
But I feel safe
I have a shield
I feel great
My coat of arms in place
My honor
My families trust
My actions
Need not be discussed
See I walk with my head up
Some talk but there words don't add up

We are here today and we'll be here tomorrow
I don't entertain negativity
We are here to stay and you'll be gone tomorrow
I've come a long way with positivity

All day PMA

So much envy
So much hate
In this world
But I feel safe
I'm covered
I feel great
My coat of arms in place
You can't con or infiltrate
You can't harm or penetrate
Arm in arm
We stand in grace

We are here today and we'll be here tomorrow
I don't entertain negativity
We are here to stay and you'll be gone tomorrow
I've come a long way with positivity

We are here to stay and you'll be gone tomorrow
My armor's in place
