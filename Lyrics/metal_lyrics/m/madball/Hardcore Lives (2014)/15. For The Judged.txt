I see your face when you look at me
I feel embarrassed ashamed for you
Not me
It's disgraceful you can't help to be
What they taught you to be
Your own worst enemy
No need to tell me why
I know the answer
The answer
You think you're dignified
But you're a cancer
A cancer that never dies

All I see is hatred
All I feel is empty for you

In the grand scheme
I'm so proud to be different than he or she
Different from him or me
In the grand scheme
That's what it's supposed to be
No judgment
From birth
There's judgment
You're a disease
There's no cure to be seen

I see your face when you look at me
I feel embarrassed ashamed for you
Not me
It's disgraceful
But you can't help to be
What they taught you to be
Your own worst enemy
No need to tell me why
I know the answer
The answer
You think you're dignified
But you're a cancer
That never fucking dies
