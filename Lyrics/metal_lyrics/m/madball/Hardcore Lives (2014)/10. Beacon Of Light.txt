I know these times won't last
I watch every move
It goes so fast
Before you know it the boy is a man
Let me enjoy it as much as I can
There he is my beacon of light
Like his mother they shine so bright
Like his mother they gave me life
Give me life

So guide me in

I survived those treacherous seas
I stayed alive but didn't always believe
That I deserve what I have in front of me
There are no words but I have to speak
No nouns no verbs describe the deep
Oceans of feelings inscribed in me

So guide me in
Please guide me in

I see the light I'm heading towards you
The spirits say the answer is right
Before you
There's my beacon of light
I see the light I'm heading for you
May all the days be as bright
For my beacons of light
