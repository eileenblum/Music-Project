I've never rested on my laurels
I can't resist
Can't rest
We're being tested in this age of quarrel
It's all a test
Life's a test
My roots are steeped in the past
But the future it's so vast
There's a task I must grasp
It's right in front of me
I can't let it pass

We belong to the here and now
We belong
We belong to the here and now
The here and now

Seize the moment or cease to exist
Sounds dramatic
No I am a realist
I believe in destiny yes
I believe hard work is the catalyst
The past is the past
The nostalgia will always last
We can stay here and bask
Or take this day before it comes to pass

We belong to the here and now
We belong
We belong to the here and now
The here and now

I can't live in the past tense
I can't see what the future will bring
All I have is this moment
Right now

We belong
We belong to the here and now
The here and now
