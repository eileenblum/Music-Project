[feat. Candace Puopolo]Dig deep for the strength that you seek
Dig deep, dig deep
Dig deep for the strength that you seek
Dig deep, dig deep
Dig deep for the strength that you seek
Dig deep, dig deep
Dig deep for the strength that you seek
Concealed, dig deep, dig deep
Too many witness for your defeats are displayed
Into fuel, dig deep
We've all had our hate under the water
We bend down, or most drown
We've all found the dread by the murder
Somehow we start again
Born strong, born to become
Who we are, what we are, as one!
As one, how we grind with the turmoil
The outcome means how strong we are
Hate strength, have faith, and get what it takes
We don't fall, we don't fall
No one is wise without contracting all
Can't stop, won't stop
But who decides the dementia that you strive
You have, within!
It's all you take, you're gonna get up and give it your all
Nothing can stop us now
OH!
Don't you drown on the pain
We've all felt that pain
Just think about what it means
To be born, start again
Born strong, born to become
Who we are, what we are, as one!
As one, how we grind with the turmoil
The outcome means how strong
Born strong, born to become
Who we are, what we are, as one!
As one, how we grind with the turmoil
The outcome means how strong we are
