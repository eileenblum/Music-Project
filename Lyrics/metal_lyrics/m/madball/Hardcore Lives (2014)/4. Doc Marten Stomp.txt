Black and blue

They've been talking us down for so long
I almost started to believe them all
Yeah I know we've done some wrong
We've done some right too
Life goes on
The self righteous say you're far gone
I'd like to say you're dead wrong
You don't know us or what we've become
Or what we will be
So mind your tongue
You could be staring down the barrel of a gun
Instead you're listening to words from verses sung
It's not tough talk it's evolution
Go

I'm in all black like Cash
I'm ready
Got my blue cap on steady
As we take this wild ride in stride

Some never made it out alive
I do this for them with pride

For the black
The blue
My brothers
The crew
For the black
The blue
The lost brothers
The crew

Doc Marten Stomp

I do this for them
I do this for you

I do this for them
I do this for you
I do this for the black and the blue

Now who's all with me
