Jimmy's in the back
With a pocket of high
If you listen close
You can hear him cry
Oh Lord, heaven knows
We belong way down below
Sing it
Oh Lord, heaven knows
We belong way down below
Way down below, way down below
Judy's in the front seat picking up trash
Living on the dough
Gotta make that cash
Won't be pretty
Won't be sweet
She's just in here on her feet
Singing
Oh Lord, heaven knows
We belong way down below
Oh Lord, tell us so
We belong way down below
Way down below, way down below
Way down below, way down below
I've got what it takes, man
I've seen better days
I've got a better wise man
I know that I worth
One, two, three and four
The devil's knocking at your door
Caught in the eye of a dead man's wife
Show you life with your head up high
Now you're on your knees
With your head down low
Big mental, she wear it to go
Tell her it's good
Tell her okay
Don't do a God damn thing they say
Oh Lord, heaven knows
We belong way down below
Oh Lord, tell us so
We belong way down below
Way down below, way down below
Way down below, way down below
I've seen better ways, man
I know that I worth
I've seen better days, man
I have better day
Jenna's in the back with a pocket of high
If you listen close
You can hear the crying
Oh Lord, heaven knows
We belong way down below
Oh Lord, tell us so
We belong way down below
Oh Lord, heaven knows
We belong way down below
Oh Lord, tell us so
We belong way down below
Way down below, way down below
Way down below, way down below
