[feat. Scott Vogel]Everybody wants to be part of that old regime
I get it
I felt that same way too
But here's my point to view
Who the fuck cares
More importantly who's still here
The proof's all around you
Respect the old
But break new ground too

The true school
Respect the old ways
But it's a new day
There's one school
Give respect where it's due

I remember when I found you
Brought to life by the sounds of disgrace
A lost kid with a chip on my shoulder
No direction
I had no peace
You taught me
You schooled me to keep my mind sharp
Live at my own pace
I give respect to those who built this
And the new kids that remind me
What this means

The true school
Respect the old ways
But it's a new day
There's one school
Show respect to the ones that see it through

There's just one

There's one school
The true school
