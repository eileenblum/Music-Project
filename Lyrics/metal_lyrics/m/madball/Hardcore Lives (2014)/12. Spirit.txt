I manifest in many ways
I infect, cause misery
I'm lurking
And they won't like what they see
I'm working
To make sure you'll never be
As comfortable as you'd like to be
Life's wonderful
Wouldn't you like to see
Oh what a pity I'm here
What a pity but I've always been here
I'll turn off your bright light
Turn day to night
If you let me

No you can't break my spirit
I won't let you
Go but don't take my spirit
That's what drives me

Guess we're at it again
You're so combative my friend
Fall after fall
I never left you
Maybe I didn't pick you up
But I was there
Oh yeah
Maybe I didn't give a fuck
But I'm still here while your soul is bare
I'll turn off your bright light
Turn day to night
If you let me
I'll make sure you get by when you're inside
Don't forget me

No I'm not gonna let you

No you can't break my spirit
I won't let you
Go but don't take my spirit
That's what drives me
