What I'm made of is hard to say
The impressions and scars they stay
I hated confession so to god I prayed
Not to the man in the cloth, no way

I was lost
I was lost, okay
We're all lost 'til we find our way
We pay the cost 'til we find that place
Find that shelter, find that escape

I am made of what you are made of
I'm just as fucked up as all of us
But oh well...

I hate self pity so I'll take the blame
I came to the city to stake my claim
It was gritty then far from tame
I was itty bitty man hard was the way

We learned discard all pain
We earned and fought our way
To where we are where we are today
It wasn't easy but it's part of me

I am made of what you are made of
I am made of what you are made of

All my flaws
All my scars
Some are mine
Some are yours
My make-up
It's just
It's just like yours

You and I we are different from them
Can't break us
We're built to endure
But the cost is the loss of innocence

Now I wake up to eyes that are so pure, so pure,

My DNA
