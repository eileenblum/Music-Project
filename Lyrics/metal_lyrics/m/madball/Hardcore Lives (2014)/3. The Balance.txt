As I watch the clock
My whole heart starts to drop
Times ticking away
It doesn't stop
On that mission again
Leaving behind what matters the most
The tears cloud my vision
I pretend to be fine but that's a joke
Inside I'm torn to shreds
Before I fly high I numb the head
It's part nerves part excitement part dread
Wish I could tell you
Something different instead

It's bittersweet
I'm off balance
My choice hangs in the balance
I love the feeling
The challenge

But I love them more
Time to punch the clock
The cycle never stops
I'm feeling pressure to please
To appease all sides and me
Don't get me wrong
Don't misunderstand
I love my work
It's my passion
I take nothing for granted
Not a thing
Nothing

It's bittersweet
I'm off balance
My choice hangs in the balance
I love the feeling
The challenge

But I love them more

As the long hand marks the minutes
On the clock
That goes tic then toc
My soul is aching
My heart is breaking

It's bittersweet
I'm off balance
My choice hangs in the balance
I love the feeling
The challenge

But I love them more

But I need them more
I need it all
To fulfill the call
I need balance
