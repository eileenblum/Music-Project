You say that you've been there
Think that you've seen it all
You keep frontin' like you know it all
You let ignorance set in and
Control your life
Runnin' your mouth into
Extreme heights
You chose to dis me and the crew
You played yourself like a fool
Showing pride's far
Beyond your might
Push came to shove
Now it's time to fight
Tell me how you're livin'
Face to face
Tell me how you're livin'
Is it in disgrace?

[Repeat 1st verse]
