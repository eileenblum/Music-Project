I still can't believe till this day
That he's gone - passed away
His life was taken in the
Blink of an eye
All I can ask myself is 'Why?'

Cold as life harder than you
That's how he's remembered
In everyone's view
That's how he'd want it
That's how we want it too
Cold as life, colder than you

He was not an angel and that we know
But he had a heart, he was our bro
His life was taken in the
Blink of an eye
All I can ask myself is 'Why?'
