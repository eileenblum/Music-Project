The time has come for all to hear
Madball's back so just beware
The time has come to
Set it all straight
Speaking the truth because
I got a lot of hate
To all who got beef
Get ready to fight

The battle begun
We'll show you who's right
We're takin' over and
We're letting you know
The crew is runnin' the show

It's time, time to
Set the record straight
Speaking the truth
Cause I got a lot of hate
In my mind you can't see
What's going on
We're taking over and
Now you're time has come

Time has come, I'm on the attack
Ball of destruction is bringin' it back
Hardcore lives through me
The time has come for all to see
To all who got beef
Get ready to fight
The battle begun we'll
Show you who's right
Takin' over and we're
Letting you know
The crew is runnin' the show
