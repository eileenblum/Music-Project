Born into violence
Didn't know any other way
This life of crime he was destined
For, and this is his fate
From a broken home
Getting beat was an everyday thing
This is what is going down everywhere
And for him it's too late

Can't blame him
There's nothing he can do
They made him take their abuse
And he's takin' it out on you
It's my turn, I'm takin'
It out on you
The world is mine
And no one can take it from me

That's his mentality
That's why he got put away
Did his share of time
And he's out and back
To his old ways
Got wiser, became a leader and took
Control of the streets
Turned his gang into an empire
Now he can't get beat
