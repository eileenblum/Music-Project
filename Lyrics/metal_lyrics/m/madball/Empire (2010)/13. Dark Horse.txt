You thought I'd die in the gutter
You thought I'd drown in despair
You thought I'd never survive
That I'd give up and would not care.

You were so wrong...
I'm more than just physically strong!

There's more than your eyes can see,
More than you understand
There's so much more to me and my family
Look beyond my bloody hands
Look in my heart
Look in my soul
Do you understand
I don't think you comprehend that:

I will ascend
We will transcend
I will overtake
We will rejuvenate

I rose from the depths of darkness
Where you wish I had stayed in disarray
No aspiration to succeed
But your doubts, your judgement
they gave me strength
Your eyes are green with envy
But mine see the path now clearly

I will ascend
We will transcend
I will overtake
We will rejuvenate

I will ascend
We will transcend
I will overtake
and demonstrate my style

You thought I'd die in the gutter
You thought I'd drown in despair
You thought I'd never survive
But I did and you went nowhere

You were so wrong
Oh, you were so wrong...
Beware, beware the dark horse comes!
