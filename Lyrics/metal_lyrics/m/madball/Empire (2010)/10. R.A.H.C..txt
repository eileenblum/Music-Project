You say it's dead,
this thing of ours is gone.
Well that's news to me,
I've been misinformed.

All these years I could've sworn.
I moved a part of something, a movement that is no more.

You want Hardcore?
Real Hardcore?
They say, "Fuck Hardcore! It's dead"!

You want Hardcore?
Real-deal Hardcore?
Well I'm sorry, they say it's dead.

I guess your word is wrong,
I wish I would have known.
I wasted so much time,
travelling around the world.

All these years I could've sworn.
I represented something they say that is no more.

You want Hardcore? Real Hardcore?
They say, "Fuck Hardcore! It's dead"!

Well let me tell you how I feel about it!
The best way I know how, I'm going to scream and shout it!
Just so, so you know, your story's full of holes.
You missed the real show you fucking assholes!

We are the real American Hardcore!

You obviously don't care about us!
You know who we are, but don't want to talk about us!

Just so, so you know, we still run the show!
We kept this thing alive, you fucking assholes!
