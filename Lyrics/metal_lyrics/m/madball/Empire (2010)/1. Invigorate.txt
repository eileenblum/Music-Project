No one controls our existence
They never have never will
You see our passion and persistence
That's what guides our will
Don't need your stories your headlines
Don't need your exposure
We have been defined by our music
The people the movement the lifestyle we live
We'll be the conduit

The evaluate we dictate
They sit and wait we take charge
Invigorate
Our minds your minds never hesitate to express yourself
Make your own fate

We're self sufficient we play by our rules
Don't need your stations recycled airplay
Your monopolies have seen some better days
We have the tools the heart the vision
A global empire that does not need permission

The evaluate we dictate
They sit and wait we take charge
Invigorate
Our minds your minds never hesitate to express yourself
Make your own fate

Express yourself... be yourself
Take charge don't play into bitterness
The real villains are those who are killing this music with no real substance
Use it abuse it
We gain nothing but in the underground
We gain something originality culture that something more than just recycled nothing
We are more than just a token

The evaluate we dictate
They sit and wait we take charge
Invigorate
Our minds your minds never hesitate to express yourself
Make your own fate
