What will you do when
Your kingdom comes crumbling down around you
What will you do when
The walls you built fall and all your nemeses find you
In the realm of make believe
You are a ruler
A prince
A king
You speak freely imprudently
It's not naivetÃ©
It's how you chose to be
Your disciples laugh at your quips
And just like you they're hypocrites
You would never own up to what you say
At least not to anyones face

Wake up to reality
Wake up to your pathetic life
Where you
You just hate to hate

Because you have no life
Your monarchy does not exist

So what will you do when your followers betray you
And you become exposed
What will you do
In the world of fantasy you are the master
A genius indeed
You voice your thoughts so eloquently
Or at least that's what you believe
An opinion is everyone's right
Say what you want just remember you crossed the line
There's certain people you don't verbally smite
Now this will all come to light
Come to light

Just like in your world
One button is all it takes
One button can erase your words and actions
Or put you in a vulnerable place

Wake up to reality
Wake up to your pathetic life
Where you
You just hate to hate

They're coming
They're coming for you
They're gunning
They're gunning for you
