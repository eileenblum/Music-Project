I'm still that same guy who'd punch you in your fucking face,
Yeah I'm that bad guy, I'm not ashamed, I know my place.
Doesn't matter if I'm cool - Your one track mind,
Only sees me as one thing, well that's just fine.
Sometimes you have to degress to progress,
Sometimes kindness is taken for weakness.
I'm much more dangerous even though I'm more responsible,
I'm not shameless but I will hold those accountable,
You think it's cool to be rude and test the waters I will accommodate your curiosity
Be nice, my brother.

I hate being stereotyped - but sometimes you should believe the hype, and leave it alone.

Sometimes you have to degress to progress,
Sometimes kindness is taken for weakness.

So you just say: Fuck, fuck, fuck it!

I will deliver my sentence - you'll rise above it.
This is a public service I'm announcing to you
I'm denouncing my civility, be careful with your move,
You want proof, well I'll give it to you.
