The rebel she lives forever, she lives in you, she lives in you.
She lives in those that she touched, she lives in me and you.
The rebel she lives forever, she lives in you, she lives in you.
She lives in those that she touched, she lives in me and you.

As I walk through the valley little sister, I will look for you.
I hope I can finish my work here first, I'm sure you wish you could have too.
I heard a saying that goes: âSome heroes die youngâ,
That must have been the truth in your case.
But I wish they were wrong, so wrong.
Suzanne.

The rebel she lives forever, she lives in you, she lives in you.
She lives in those that she touched, she lives in me and you.
The rebel she lives forever, she lives in you, she lives in you.
She lives in those that she touched, she lives in me and you.

I wish I was strong just like you, and maybe one day I'll be a free spirit just like you were.
I hope one day I can see all the good in the people around me, like you always did see.
I always think of what you said profoundly, and I know you found peace.
I know you found peace my sister, I know you're watching over your family.

The rebel she lives forever, she lives in you, she lives in you.
She lives in those that she touched, she lives in me and you.
The rebel she lives forever, she lives in you, she lives in you.
She lives in those that she touched, she lives in me and you.

We will see you on the other side, Suzanne.
