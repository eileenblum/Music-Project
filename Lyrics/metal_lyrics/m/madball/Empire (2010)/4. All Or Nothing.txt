You can say we're all born to lose in a sense
Right
We all live to die and who knows if there's an afterlife
Either way you hope to leave your mark in some way through the journeys you'll embark on
An old man told me
Kid never settle for anything less than you deserve
Wearing a medal on his chest
A silver star for valor
He didn't have much but was content and what he did mattered
He went all out for us we should go all out for him and us

Hate us or love us we came to prove something
So in the end we can't say it was all for nothing (all or nothing)
We live to learn
Earn our place in life
We live
We die
But don't go out without a fight

I strive to be the best at whatever I do even when I'm being bad
Yeah that's the honest truth
But being bad never got me anywhere good
So I chose the other road
I had a choice
I could so
Many brothers gone by the way side
Sisters too
The sorrow it fills my eyes
I want to fight
I want to blame
I want to take names
But in the end it's all part of the game
That we can't control
For them we set examples
They went all out for us we should go all out for them and us

Hate us or love us we came to prove something
So in the end we can't say it was all for nothing (all or nothing)
We live to learn
Earn our place in life
We live
We die
But don't go out without a fight

Respect us
Or fear us
We came to be something
So in the end we can't say it was all for nothing (all or nothing)
We laugh
We cry
We sacrifice
We live
We die
But don't go out without a fight
All or nothing
