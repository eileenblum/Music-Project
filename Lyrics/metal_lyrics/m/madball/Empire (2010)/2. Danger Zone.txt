Tread easy
In the jungle of concrete
I walk around this jungle that's tame now with much respect and regard for my surroundings
I always have always will because I know the dark side
I bear the scars
People forget basic fundamentals
Things like respect get neglected
Don't write this off as tough talk
It applies to all walks

Tread easy you're in a danger zone
Tread easy your not alone

There's a new breed that walks so carelessly so recklessly
But it's not bravery
Gentrification has bred confidence and with that comes consequence
Nonsense
Watch what you do watch what you say watch how you walk it
Your not at the top of the food chain
Your more like prey
Remember what I say

Tread easy you're in a danger zone
Tread easy your not alone

Tread easy you're in a danger zone
Tread easy this jungle of concrete will take your soul
