I'm trying to find the words
Searching for the passion
I'm coming up short and time never stops passing
It's harassing me
I watch the seconds tick
They turn from minutes to days
I need to move quick but where do I look for inspiration
Where do I find the hunger the frustration
Oh it's not far at all
There's the mirror
Look the fight is on again
New chapter new book

I'm trying to find trying to find the lines
Lines words you can only define as timeless
I'm trying to find trying to find the lines
I hope what I find is timeless

Once again the struggle is on
Once again the pressure will transform us
Our presence is strong but not invincible
It's crucial time to be visceral
Realness stands the test of time
It always will but we still have to progress
And no this is not about the scene
It's about relevance in the bigger scheme of things

I'm trying to find trying to find the lines
Lines words you can only define as timeless
I'm trying to find trying to find the lines
I hope what I find is timeless

Independent of time - eternal
Unaffected by time - ageless
In my search of relevance
I found that we should always be ourselves
And in my search for progress
I found that integrity is priceless
Timeless
