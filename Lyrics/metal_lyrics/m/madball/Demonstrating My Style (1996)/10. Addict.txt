All fucked up, now you turn to me
All this time I tried to help you see
Where you're headed is to an early grave
I don't want to see you go out that way
Help you, is what I try to do
But you refuse - what can I do
That shit you do is only killing you
It's blinding you - can't see the truth
Can't you see what you're doing to yourself
You're at fault, can't blame nobody else
Where you're headed is to an early grave
I don't want you to go that way
You're losing all your pride
And now it's time to gain it back
Get your self-respect
I can only help you out
If you want to be helped
Gotta help yourself
Life's not waiting on you
Gotta put yourself in-check
Get your self-respect
I can only help you out
If you want to be helped
Gotta help yourself
