Demonstrating my style
Lettin' it be known
Follow the path of no one else
It's all about being true to myself
I'll speak my mind, I won't keep it inside
The years pass and people change
But I'm stayin' true to my ways
Hardcore is my life, I'll carry the name
Demonstrating my style
Lettin' it be known
Demonstrating my style
We're not alone
Give respect where respect is due
To those who know what we've been through
We can all relate in our own way
To those who put us down, we won't see you around
Cause you're too scared of me
To those who've helped us out, you know what we're about
You'll get respect from me
Demonstrating my style
