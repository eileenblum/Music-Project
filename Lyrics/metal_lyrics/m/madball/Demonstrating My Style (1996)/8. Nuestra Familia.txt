Times are hard and getting rougher
Could never understand why my family had to suffer
May be it's because we're not as fortunate as others
At least we've got each other, and we can rely on one another
Working hard just to make ends meet
Through good and bad we refused to accept defeat
Trying to give us what they never could have
Not a day goes by that we don't thank god for what we have
Times are hard but getting better
We paid our dues but money doesn't last forever
Maybe it's because the money doesn't always matter
At least we have each other and we can rely on another
I thank my family for everything that was given to me
Being there no matter what, even willing to die for me
They're not at fault if I'm not as good as I'm supposed to be
They did their part and now it's all up to me
I thank god and all my family
Did their best and now it's up to me
