Live or die, are the choices I got
But I refuse to go anywhere soon
Life is too short to keep explaining myself
My situation means nothing to you
Back to reality once again
I clear my thoughts and think about how much time I spent
Keep movin' on and try to do what I do best
I was always taught right from wrong
But who are you to be judging who's right
Doin' what I gotta do to get by
Will I survive; just look in my eyes
I gotta live my life day by day
No matter what type of bullshit is thrown my way
I'll overcome it with or without your help
Don't tell me, you can't tell me
How I choose to live my life
The way I choose to live my life
I was always taught right from wrong
But who are you to pint the finger at me
I have no need to explain myself
'Cause your opinions I don't need
