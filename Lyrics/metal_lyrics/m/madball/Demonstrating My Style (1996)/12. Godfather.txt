He was young at heart, been through it all
Seen all the changes, now it's time to move on
If it wasn't for him it just wouldn't be the same
He's not gone, in his heart it will stay
Pass the glory down
So pay your respect
Keep alive what he started
We'll make sure of that
If it wasn't for him
It just wouldn't be the same
He's not gone, in his heart it will stay
He moved on; that's the choice he had to make
Do what you gotta do, we're behind you all the way
Hardcore, that's all you're ever gonna be
I give thanks; you'll always be a brother to me
