In a society where no one is free
Because you're judged by what they see
Afraid of what they don't understand
Putting you down whenever they can
Thought that it was better these days
But there are some people who will never change
Still a minority in their eyes
And when confronted, they will always deny it
Be proud of who you are
Fight for what you stand for
Together as a crew
There's something you can do
Be on-point when you take action
Never give them the satisfaction
Of watching you suffer for their lies
Still a minority in their eyes
