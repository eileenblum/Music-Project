I see the way that you're looking at me
You don't like what you see
Harassing us every chance that you get
When the fuck are you gonna leave me be
I'm getting sick of your smart-ass ways
And I don't have to play your bullshit games
Now, heads against the wall
Don't fuckin' move - don't say a word
I look in your eyes, I know you're not much older than me
Going out of your way to impress your peers, and make a fool out of me
And then you wonder why some people just don't fuckin' care
Quick to lock us down, and when in need you you're just never there
Help - where are you
If this was you, what would you do
'Cause I won't help you
I can't trust you any more
Won't back down from you no more
You think that you're better than me
Give me a chance and then we'll see
Take off your badge, now talk to me
If you're the man you claim to be
