He had a life and so much to give
I'll never understand what he did
He had a family who cared for him
That was a selfish thing that he did
Life comes down hard on you sometimes
You gotta deal with it, give it time
I know he had a lot on his mind
Wish I could talk to him one last time
I know things are hard but that's no reason to end it now
I can't believe that it was so bad, that you had to take yourself out
Waste of life
I know times are hard
Why'd you give in
