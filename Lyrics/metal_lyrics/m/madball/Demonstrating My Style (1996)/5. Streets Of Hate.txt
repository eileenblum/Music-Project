Walking through these streets of hate
And I can feel their pain
I see how this fuckin' place
Can sometimes drive you insane
But I choose to keep my sanity
Won't let anything bring me down
I gotta be strong mentally
Be quick to the schemes that are all around
When I walk these streets
I know that it's in vein
I've been told I should get out
Before I wind up a victim in pain
But I choose to keep my sanity
Won't let the bad times bring me down
I gotta think of all the good things
And all the good friends I have around me
Streets of hate
Walking through these endless streets
And I can feel their rage
I see how this fuckin' place can sometimes drive you insane
