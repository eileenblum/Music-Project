Times are changing for the worse
Gotta keep a positive outlook
Growing up in such violent times
Have some faith and you'll get by
Thinking back when I was a kid
Times have changed so much since then
All grown up I gotta do for myself
I refuse to depend on anyone else
Life's hard, you struggle some times
In the end I'll get what's mine
But for now I'll deal with the times
Have some faith and you'll get by
Times are changing for the worse
Times are changing - I keep
I know my family is there for me
And without them where the hell would I be
But still I gotta try to be my own man
Make good of what I got - do the best that I can
