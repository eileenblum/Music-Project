Livin' in a world
People try to be what they're not - but can't see the fantasy
Who's living a dream
It seems it's you
We know whose real
Your life is just a game
You don't deserve your fame
Living in a world
Where the fake get apid and the true get pushed around
True to the game I'll stay while for you it's the fame
I despise you and your selfish ways
You know I'm real and I know you're fake
