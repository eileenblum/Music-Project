WHAT CAN THEY SAY? Not a thing course I've learned the hard way
OUR OWN WAY stay the course, we must carry on now
I WON'T STRAY from the path we we've chosen let's go!
Through all the good and bad things
The hope and dreams I lost my drive it seems in a way,
I've lost my mind it seems like I didn't give a fuck anything

Tightrope walking the fine line
"Guttercoke" make me feel sublime
But all in all it's not fine
Everything is not alright

WHAT CAN THEY SAY? Not a thing course I've learned the hard way
OUR OWN WAY stay the course, we must carry on now
I WON'T STRAY from the path we we've chosen let's go!
Don't we all love the fast life?
We all play the game put the barrel straight to your brain spin the chamber damn!
What a shame hopeless no joke life is no game but you still have time to maintain!
Think of all our fallen friends the soldiers of the street dead end...

I have my hopes but accept the facts
The friends I've lost to the street?
WE CAN'T BRING THEM BACK!
I think about how it was then
That's not so long ago my friends!
The close calls and the time spent
Have I learned my lesson yet?

I HOPE, I HOPE
And you don't want to see what I've seen
'Cause you might not be so lucky
