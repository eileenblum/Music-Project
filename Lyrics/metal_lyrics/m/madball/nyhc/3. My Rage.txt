I don't wanna think in to my anger
Sometimes I can't deny
I crossed the line
Too many times that I can recall
But than sometimes they justify
And if I still rise
My ask is, to take my chances
And maybe god knows why
"He knows that I tried"

But in the end, if I pushed too far
You mind find out
That I'm not so patient

With you I see the proof
That I can't hold it back

My own rage
When you cross the line
The price we pay
Is it worth the toll

Keep bringing out the worst in me
You can't blame me
No
When it's on than it's on
And there ain't no turning back
Why I'm asking so many chances
And maybe god knows why
You know that I tried

'Cause in the and if you push too far
You mind find out
That I'm not so patient

With you I see the proof
That I can't hold it back

My own rage
When you cross the line
The price we pay
I can't deny
No!
My own rage
When you cross the line
The price we pay
Is it worth my time

Try to escape this life style
You bringing me in when I'm trying to get out
What
Just try to escape this life style
You bringing me in but you're bringing me in
But you don't know me

I've got this anger in me
I don't know why
