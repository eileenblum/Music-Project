My memories of better days still stand in my way
Because no matter what I say I still play your game.
The frustration of wanting things that you can't see.
And it's hurting you but it's killing me,
It's feeding my disbelief.
And I take back all that I've done.
I can't take back, what's done is done.
I've seen the pain in your face,
The pain in your eyes.
It's no surprise to me,
I see what I've done wrong.
No sense in holding on,
Now standing side by side,
I hope I tried.
I realize it's the end of our time,
The end of our lives together.
Now there's no words left for me to say 'cause I know that things won't change.
And there's nothing left to rearrange,
All that's left is the memory.
I can't take back all that I've done.
And there's nothing left for me to say because what's done is done
