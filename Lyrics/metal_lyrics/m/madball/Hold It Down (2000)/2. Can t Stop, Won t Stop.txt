You are the blood running through my veins.
You are the streets that made me this way.
In you I've lost and regained faith but in my silence I'll never betray.
These are the streets where men are made.
Where our values are sometimes plagued into temptation I dwell for days.
And I can't stop, wont stop living by the gun.
Never one to run from my fears.
Can't stop living this way and I know what my life means to me.
I see there's things that shouldn't be,
I see there's still hope for me.
But I see myself in these streets and I try but I can't stop.
You say there's still time but I wont stop.
And I know there's still hope for me.
But I see myself in these streets.
I pray there's hope for me.
