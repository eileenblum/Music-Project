I know it's hard for me to see,
The way things have come to be but I must leave it be.
Cant keep looking back,
I don't know how to act.
I don't know where to start,
I know I've been here before.
My conscience still believes that it was on me.
My guilty heart bleeds don't want to feel this no more.
So tell me something since you've done nothing except you lied to me.
You said you'd never leave,
After all this I wanted to believe that you still care about my life.
Just tell me something so I can go in peace 'cause we could not make that sacrifice.
After all this I wanted to believe that you still care about me.
It's hard to see, but it must be,
You take away a piece of me.
I never take a step back,
Never look back.
I've come to face the facts and I know where you stand.
I won't take another step back, never look back.
