[Spoken]
This song goes out to all the kids out there who are keeping it real and turning their backs on any hardcore bands that make any money.
Fuck that man.
Hardcore isn't about money,
It's a way of life.
Sure I live with my mom right now,
But I'd live on the streets if I had to.
And I know deep in my heart,
That one day, I'll go to college,
Get a real job,
And forget all about hardcore.
But until then I'm gonna talk as much shit as I can.
Diy!

[Sung]
D.I.F.F.M. Fuck you!
D.I.F.F.M. Fuck you!
D.I.F.F.M. Fuck you!
D.I.F.F.M. Fuck you!
D.I.F.F.M. Fuck you!
