Enough times been wasted and now I'm faced with our realities and what's to come of this scene.
So many come and go, some have disgraced it.
I think it's time we take a stand show them what we mean.
You can't stop this, this thing of ours.
Hold it down.
This things is ours, hardcore is ours.
Time after time, line after line.
I must express the truth 'cause that is what we stand for.
Some live to lie they will defy and deny our roots I pay no mind.
You no who we care for.
And I'm not only speaking for myself I can't.
I hope I speak for everyone else out there.
'Cause a lot of people think that we don't care.
But they can't stop what I'm bringing can't stop what I'm bringing.
Trying to make a change do what I can.
They can't stop what I'm bringing can't stop what I'm bringing.
You can't stop what we're bringing.
Trying to make a change and hold it down 'cause we can
