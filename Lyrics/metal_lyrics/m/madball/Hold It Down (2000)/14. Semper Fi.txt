Who's by my side, I'm by your side.
My blood is my loyalty,
My brothers are loyal to me.
Who by my side, this is what I believe.

I never back stab another to save mine,
I stand the time.
For me it's do or die,
These are the rules I live by.
And I shed my blood for my brothers of the same mind,
Of the same kind, who never leave my side.
See we never think twice,
And they shed their blood for me.

Who's by my side, I'm by your side.
My blood is my loyalty,
My brothers are loyal to me.
Who by my side, this is what we believe.

We stand for one another in hard times, in good times.
No matter what we find,
A way so we can get by.
And I shed my blood for my brothers of the same mind,
Of the same kind, who never leave my side.
See we never think twice,
And they shed their blood for me.

To a DMS crew always on top
Reppin NYC you know we don't stop
Going worldwide you know it's non stop
And I shed my blood for my crew
