I will not hesitate,
If I wait, I give in to chance and I can't live life that way.
Can you read my face?
There's no way I'll turn and walk away so just make your mistake.
So when the time comes I don't care,
When the time comes I'll be there,
When the time comes show no fear,
'Cause it's time and I'm right here.
I will not lose face, I'll save,
Everything I am 'cause that's just how I was made.
I will not hesitate,
If I wait I give into chance and I can't live life that way.
A wise man once said to me
"Son, don't you ever back down to no one",
'Cause I'll be there, don't show no fear.
