Everyday I hate more and more 'cause I know the truth.
It's just a role you play and nothing more.
Life's a game to you.
But I live by another set of rules and I know just what it takes to prove.
That weak at heart is what you'll always be.
Your fake ass won't compete with me.
It must be hard to live in disgrace.
They know the truth and now who should you blame?
You have no fucking shame.
I'm the one so blame me.
Everyday I hate I cannot relate.
You'll never be a part of my scene.
You're just a sucker MC,
A fucking wanna be.
Now come and throw joints with me
