You better think quick,
Act fast before its time you take another blast.
You better think about where you stand 'cause it seems you're on the wrong path.
Used to look down, talk down.
Now you walk down the same path blown out.
You're fooling yourself, you're not proud.
So lean on me to come down.
Choose you're own fate, but this ain't mine.
You've fallen from grace,
I won't let you fall this time.
Out back to back days sniffing gak,
Now you're really on the wrong track.
Do you really want to come back?
Are you losing yourself and do you want that?
I fall this time.
It's not a necessity,
It's just a fantasy and it's too much for me.
Too much of anything is not a good thing.
Fallen and now I plead.
