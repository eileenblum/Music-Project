Head high live and die that way
Stand upright, mean what you say
Too many of you living on your knees
Too many of you living fantasies
Head high live and die that way
Stand up straight, live what you say
Too many of you living on your knees
Too many of you living fantasies

Go ahead and follow, stay in the cue
Go follow, don't do what you want to
The pressure, I know it's hard
So just buckle, fold, throw in your cards
As for me I'm pushing on
Been on my knees but I'm feeling strong
I don't believe in just playing along
Complacency is a sad song

Head high live and die that way
Stand upright, mean what you say
Too many of you living on your knees
Too many of you living fantasies
Head high live and die that way
Stand up straight, live what you say
Too many of you living on your knees
Too many of you living fantasies

Your faces are glued to that screen
Where your hatred reigns supreme
What does your life truly mean though?
No self esteem, no truth in your schemes
While most aspire to be something they dream
You aspire to do nothing but demean
No credibility, just pure fantasy
Your instability show everything

You never want to cross paths with me

I'd rather die standing upright (upright)
I'd rather die standing upright (upright)

I'd rather live standing up straight (up straight)
I'd rather live standing up straight (up straight)
