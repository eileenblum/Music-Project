We go on and on and on

You say never reach for the stars
You say you'll never get too far
You say it's a lost cause
I go on and on and on
Keep on keeping on
You say never reach for the stars
You say you won't get too far
You say we're a lost cause
We go on and on and on
Keep on keeping on

I see a world with no limits
You say I'm being naive
Well I'm not young or privileged
I know what I've lived, what I've seen

Yeah we all struggle
The hard times, they keep us humble
Your words cut into me
They left a mark that reminds me

This world will test us all
Your doubt fuels my cause

You say never reach for the stars
You say you'll never get too far
You say it's a lost cause
I go on and on and on
Keep on keeping on
You say never reach for the stars
You say you won't get too far
You say we're a lost cause
We go on and on and on
Keep on keeping on

I say the sky is the limit
You can't see past the overcast
Above the darkness is where I'm headed
Where hope is vast

We should never let go
Of all the pain and words that echo
So I can't say I won't again
Give me the fuel that I need to ascend

This world will test our resolve
Your hate fuels my
My cause, my beliefs
My victories and defeats
They're mine and only mine
My cause, my beliefs
My vindication will set me free
You can't undermine

Can't hold me back (can't hold me back)
Can't set me back (you can't set me back)
You can't hold me back
We go on and on and on

You say never reach for the stars
You say you'll never get too far
You say it's a lost cause
I go on and on and on
Keep on keeping on
You say
You say
You say, fuck what you say
On and on and on
