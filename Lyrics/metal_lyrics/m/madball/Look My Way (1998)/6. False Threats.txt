I know you're not so ignorant
And you've been mislead by lies
Pathetic thoughts, so intimate that you pray
For your demise
I can tell you, I've seen it happen twice
Young souls with so much vision who refused
To see the light

The lines are drawn, the rules are set
No good cause, no chance left
And when there are lives lost
You'll live with those regrets
Because their weak minds were drawn to your false threats

The lines are drawn, the rules are set
No good cause, no chance left
And when there are lives lost
You'll live with those regrets
Because their weak minds were drawn to your false threats

Don't lose your faith
Don't throw it all away
Don't lose your faith
Don't run away from life

Why pride yourself on misery an say there's no hope left
You sell yourself and others short
You should not think so selfishly
Your life is not so bad
And after all, you have a choice
