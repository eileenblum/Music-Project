I'm tryin' to keep calm and you're pushin' me
I'm tryin' to keep my calm and see you're still pushin' me
I don't know why you keep pushin' me
I'm tryin' to keep my calm and see you're still pushin' me!

You've pushed your luck with me and I don't
Appreciate the fact that you're tryin' to intimate me
I've tried to keep my cool
But you've taken it from me
