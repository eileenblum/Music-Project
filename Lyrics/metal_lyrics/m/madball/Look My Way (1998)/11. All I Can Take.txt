Wanna run for cover but thereâs no where to escape
Runninâ from your problems ainât makinâ them go away
Gotta be strong even when youâre feeling afraid
Itâs all in your mind the fears you have to face

I remember the times when I felt all alone and afraid
Regretting the times that I chose to turn and walk away

Iâve had all I can take
My self respect is now at stake

Forget about the past thereâs nothing I can change
Try to look ahead tomorrowâs another day
Time to make a stand for the sake of my own shame
And now Iâm gonna fight because I donât see any other way
Remember the times when I felt all alone and afraid
Regretting the times that I chose to turn and walk away

Iâve had all I can take
My self respect is now at stake

Iâve had all I can take
Now Iâm gonna show force
Iâve learned life the hard way
Time to even the score
Win or lose thereâs no fear left in me
Got no choice but to fight
Iâm through trying to decide whoâs wrong and whatâs right
