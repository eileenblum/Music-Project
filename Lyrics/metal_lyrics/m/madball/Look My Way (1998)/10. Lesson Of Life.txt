I'm lookin' forward to better times when I won't have to struggle to get by
Searchin' for some peace of mind, hard times got me crossin' the line
And every difficult day I learn I'm not alone in the struggle to get by

Everybody's got their own fight
It's just a fact of life

And I know things don't come easy
But I know that I'll get by
But I know that things don't come easy
But I'll survive

So I'm takin' it as comes
I know I've got to stay on my feet
I've got to roll with the punches because I see that it's up to me
And every day that that I fight temptation I know God is on my side
These are the lesson of life
And I will get by

And I know things don't come easy
But I know that I'll get by
I know things don't come easy
But I'll survive

And when I think back
It gives me strength inside
And I won't hold back
I take it all in stride
I will get by
