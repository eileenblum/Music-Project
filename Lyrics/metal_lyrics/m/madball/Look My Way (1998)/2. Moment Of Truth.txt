I'm walkin' down the street
I will not show you fear
No time for sympathy
I give my cold stare
I don't care what you think of me
It's not revenge I seek, it's just you and me
I'm walking down the street
And tension fills the air
I will not think defeat
Moment of truth is here
I don't care what you think of me
It's not revenge I seek, it's you and me

Right now you and me
Right now you and me

All that talking you've done is weak
You got to be about what you speak
All the schism and hype will seize
Once we take this beef to the motherfucking streets
