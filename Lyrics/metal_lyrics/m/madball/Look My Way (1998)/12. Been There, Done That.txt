Knew it all, I thought I knew it all
I knew nothing till it came to an end
The time has come to make move in my life
Iâve seen it happen all again and again
Looking back on all the things that I did
I have regrets, but thatâs what it is
So that was then and this is now
Iâve seen it happen all again and again

Iâve been there and done that - look back
Looking at life and where Iâm at
Where do I go from here - think clear
Is the question that we all fear

Knew it all, I thought I knew it all
I was blind until I opened my eyes
Fuckinâ up is how you learn in this life
Take that for granted and youâll never survive

Looking back on those things that I did
I have regrets, but it is what it is
That was then and this is now
Iâve seen it happen all again and again

Iâve been there and done that - look back
Looking at life and where Iâm at
Where do I go from here - think clear
Is the question that we all fear
Think clear and look back
Remember then and where youâre at
What donât kill you will make you strong
There comes a time when you must move on

Iâve seen a lot in my young age
A lot has changed, memories remain the same
Thereâs different ways this game is played
Our violent ways have to end some day
