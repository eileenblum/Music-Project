I've won and I've lost
The struggle tears me apart
The final judgement means much to me
I try to follow me heart
I know that I try
But are my effort's too weak

It's just a matter of right or wrong
It's what I do and not what I speak
I can't believe that there is no hope

Or else I am sure to give in
I have to keep my faith alive and
Tell myself not to give in

I know that I try
But are efforts too late?
Will I be able to right my wrongs?
Will I be able to conquer my hate?

Temptation or restraint
The choice is left up to me
In the end I hope I prove my faith
In he who judges me
