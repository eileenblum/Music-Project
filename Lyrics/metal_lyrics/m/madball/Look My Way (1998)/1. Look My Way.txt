Look my way, don't hide your face in shame
To me your all the same

I don't need your respect

Our pride and shame, we've held strong through the years
We've come this far, and I see very clear
You faked a smile to show me how much you care
You hypocrites get no respect over here

I know your game B
I keep going strong
You can't fake me
I keep moving on

I see right through your games and all your phony ways, in my world you have no say
Go your way, 'cause I know they'll be a day, when you'll be forced to look my way

Our pride and shame, we've always kept it real
No need to front, or hide the way I feel
You live a lie, afraid to look me in the eye
You have a lot to say, so speak your mind

I know your game B
I keep going strong
You can't fake me
I keep moving on

I'm not to blame
When all your shit blows up in your face
I'm not to blame
'Cause someone's bound to put you in your place
I'm not to blame
For all the times that you were afraid
To just look my way

You hide your face in shame, 'cause you have no integrity, and to me your all the same

I don't need your respect

Our pride and shame, we've held strong through the years
We've Come this far, and I see very clear
You faked a smile to show me how much you care
You hypocrites get no respect over here

I know your game B
I keep going strong
You can't fake me
I keep moving on
