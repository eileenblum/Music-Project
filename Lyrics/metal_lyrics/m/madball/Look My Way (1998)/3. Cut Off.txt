I can't help you, you gotta fight for yourself
You did this to yourself and
I reject you, what do you want from me now
After you've let us down
And I don't wanna know the reason why
No excuses for all your funkin' lies
I don't want to hear your alibis
I gotta turn turn my back and walk away
I can't forgive when it's my life at stake
You've played yourself out, now it's too late

The time has come to set you free
My back is turned so you can see
It don't matter to me

The time has come to set you free
My back is turned so you can see
It don't matter to me
Because our friendship is now deceased
When justice serves you'll think of me
It don't matter to me

You played yourself and I've been forced to draw the line
With me you will not find (any pity) It don't matter
You forced my hand, you lied, you've been cut off
And I can't help you out this 'cause it don't matter to me
