There's no discretion, just pain
No sympathy in war
If you're my foe, you're not human anymore
Don't proclaim your innocence
We're all innocent and guilty as well... yeah
We fight for blood money to reign supreme
You fight for God almighty to control human beings
What makes you better than me?
What makes me better than you?
Behold, let the guns speak
No peace without justice
I'll battle, I'll fight for who and why do I die?
We speak of justice
But who will bring it, who will lay the law down?
Is their aggression so vain we've lost hope in others?
We protect our families, sisters and brothers
But who do they protect?
Yes, our governments
And the terrorists who will destroy
Who will destroy us?
Who will destroy us all?
No peace without justice
I'll battle, I'll fight for who and why do I die?
We speak of justice
But who will bring it, who will lay the law down?
