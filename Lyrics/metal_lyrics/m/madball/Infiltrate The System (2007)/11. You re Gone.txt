I don't dwell on yesterday
Yesterday has come and gone
Just like you have from my life
You're just a memory
I know you were good to me
I'll never forget that you were there
In my time of need
Today is here now and you're gone
Tomorrow will come soon
So long
With everyday, with everyday
You fade away
With everyday, with everyday
I move on
What would I say to you if tomorrow came
And you showed up once again
Just like that dream
I know what I would have given you
Everything, anything
Now I have nothing to give
Today is here now and you're gone
Tomorrow will come soon
So long
With everyday, with everyday
You fade away
With everyday, with everyday
I must move on
You're gone
Like yesterday
So long
Tomorrow has come
