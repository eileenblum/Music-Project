We're gonna make an example of you
Way worse than before
You should have kept your big mouth shut
We were ready to forget and ignore you
You've crossed the line again
Wishing death upon me and mine
Where I'm from we take that as a threat
On you'll soon regret
Run, hide
You can't escape what's coming
Run, hide
You can't escape what's inevitable
You were never hard, you just played the part
I'll break your spirit take your heart
The bully who can't play in his own backyard
That's you
Fuck you
I'll take that mask that you hide behind
Crush your soul, take your pride
Maybe you'll learn respect after we break you,
Crush you down to the ground
You've should have followed your own advice
I will hang you by your boots now
You wanna talk about the "old school"
You're cut off, you lost your privileges
Run, hide
NYC I'll make you say you love it
Run, hide
You can't escape what's coming for you

[Hoya]
You were never hard, you just played the part
I'll break your spirit take your heart
The bully who can't play in his own backyard
That's you
Fuck you
Break you
Crush you
Break your spirit
Take your heart
Break you
Crush you down
