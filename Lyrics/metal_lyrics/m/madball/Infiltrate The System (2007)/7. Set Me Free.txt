I'm no victim
I'm no pawn
I've been fighting you long enough
Well time's up
I'm disgusted
You've only brought misery into my life
You're infectious like a disease
You're venomous
Find my cure
Set me free
I don't trust you
All it takes
Is one last mistake to break us
I just want to get away
I see you everywhere I go
I'm stuck
It's death or lockup
If I let you beat me again
You're infectious like a disease
You're venomous
Find my cure
Set me free
I am you
You are me
We are one
You cannot set me free
I'll do as I please
Never question your protector
Your talk is cheap
To beat me
You must kill yourself
