I hate to be the bearer of bad news
But your time is done
You're not what you used to be
Maybe you were never what you think you are
This is not about who is better than who
It's about those who demand what they haven't earned
People like you
Take what you can get
With no respect
You reap the benefits
Show respect
For what we've all built
Where have you been?
Your novelty has worn off
And I supported your cause
Until your demands made me not want to know you at all
We left and came back with our integrity intact
I question the sincerity of your so called "comeback"
You take what you can get
With no respect
You reap the benefits
Show respect
For what we've all built
Where have you been?
Cause we've been on the frontlines
We've been on the frontlines
You're just a novelty
The past will only get you so far
A novelty and all that is worn off
You're a guest in my house
The one you helped build
But never finished
It belongs to us now
