Spread freedom
Infect the masses
Spread wisdom
Infiltrate the system
We are the voice of this generation
The ones who lost our souls
I don't think we lost ourselves
But at times we did lose control
It's time to get it back
We've crawled up from the depths of hell before
Now we're on the so called "right track"
In a position they can't ignore
What will we do with this voice we've been given?
Spread freedom
What will we do to ignite the change?
Infect the masses
What will we do with our experience untold?
Spread wisdom
Now is the time to infiltrate
We are the ones they lost faith in
Look now how much we've grown
I'm not the one who planted the seed
But I've noticed people listen to my screams
Imagine what they'd do for you
Sons and daughters grab hold of the truth
Now we're in a position to lead
Take the reins, make them believe
What will we do with this voice we've been given?
Spread freedom
What will we do to ignite the change?
Infect the masses
What will we do with our experience untold?
Spread wisdom
Now is the time to infiltrate
Now is the time to infiltrate
Infiltrate, infiltrate, infiltrate the system
