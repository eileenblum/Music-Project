Yes I am free, physically
Mentally I hurt for my family
Those I don't know, but they know me
From pictures, grandmother (esperanza) told them to love me
As I do them, I hold them close to my heart
So close, yet so damn far
Liberty, liberty or death
To the dictator, the perpetrator
Liberty, liberty or death
To your communism, fascism
Yes I know you, my selfish foe
Your toughness, your resolve is undeniable
But your cause, so filled with flaws
Has taken the life out of our people
Time to face them
Liberty, liberty or death
To the dictator, the perpetrator
Liberty, liberty or death
To your communism, fascism
Liberty, liberty or death
To the violator, the instigator
Liberty, liberty or death
To the traitor
Soon you will face them
The souls of the people
That you betrayed
Your people that you enslaved
Your revolution never had them in mind
Fight this oppression until you die
We'll fight with aggression for their lives
You will die in vain
Your death will bring forth liberty
