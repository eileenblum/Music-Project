You can't stop the renegades, no
Those rebellious kids who always have something to say
They can't be silenced, never
Even if were locked away another is born
Today, tomorrow, right now
Rise up
I'll them all to rise up
Those who've weathered the storm come and be heard
What do we say to the culprits, the enablers
Disbelievers feel the shame
Today, tomorrow, no more
I don't justify my bad behavior
But don't you patronize now
My strength, my instincts
Is what got me here
I learned nothing from you
My pain, rage, fears
You never bothered to ask where they came from
I'll expose your system now
I am the renegade
Watch as I break you down
We are the renegades
Watch as we break you
Break you down
You thought I'd never live to see this day, right?
Your prediction for me was death or jail
I'm sorry I let you down
But you failed us all
And your neglect, it left us exposed
To the pain, the sorrow, the shame
It follows us today
My pain, rage, fears
You never bothered to ask where they came from
Expose your system
Show your face now
I am the renegade
You are the renegade
We are the renegades
