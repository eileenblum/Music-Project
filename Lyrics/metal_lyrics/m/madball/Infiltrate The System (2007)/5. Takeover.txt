This is our passion
What do you know about that?
This is our vision
Something that you can't take away from us
Not anymore
We've learned too much to be another victim
We've learned from our mistakes
And you watched as we fell on our face
It is our mission
To take your place
Your supervision
Was strictly for your gain
We'll go to war with the industry
Until we take it over
It's time to change the faces
This is the takeover
We're not ungrateful
You helped us spread our wings
But from the table
You ate much more than we did
Who is to blame?
I guess our ignorance
Or was it innocence?
Either way you should feel ashamed
You prey on kids who don't know this game
You helped dig our grave
It's more than fashion
This music that we live
Bands like us come and go for you
We're not the average men!
We're not the same
We're self contained
We've made our own thing
We'll go to war with the industry
Until we take it over
It's time to change the faces
This is the takeover
This is the takeover
We will takeover
