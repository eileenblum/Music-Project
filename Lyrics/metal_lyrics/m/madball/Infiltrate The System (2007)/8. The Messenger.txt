It's time to face the wrath
Soon God will judge you
Someday He'll judge me too
Maybe I'll see you in hell
I am a sinner
This much is true
But I've killed no one
No one except you
I am not devious
I told you to your face
I am not murderous
Your actions left me no choice
I am not sinister
You crossed the line
You will pay
This is the law of the streets
So now speak your last words
Don't cry to me in shame
You're so hard
Die with honor
You sparked the flame
With this I blaze
Now I'm a killer
Because of you
But I vow to deliver
My promise, my revenge
My burden is you
I am the messenger
Accept your fate
Look deep into to my eyes
I'm the last thing you'll see
Accept your fate
Look deep into my eyes
I'm the last thing you will see
I am the messenger
I am not devious
I told you to your face
I am not murderous
Your actions left me no choice
I am not sinister
You crossed the line
You will pay
I came to deliver
My message
Your fate
