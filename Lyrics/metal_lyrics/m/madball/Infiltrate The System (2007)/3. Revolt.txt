Take by force
Revolt
Take by force
Take action
Don't be misled
Find a solution
Take by force
Take chances
Those in position
Start the revolution
We need change
We need you
In my world there's no left or right
There's only common sense here
You can save your politics and all that come with it
For those easily swayed
I'm not one of them
You're not one of them
I stand here fearless
Using the tools of my trade
My voice is my weapon
Take by force
Take action
Don't be misled
Find a solution
Take by force
Take chances
Those in position
Start the revolution
We need change
We need you
It's not anarchy that I desire
But there's a need for intervention
Open your eyes
Open your minds
This is your life
You either do or you don't
You die or you won't
Stand up for what you believe in
I know you have it in you
I found it within myself
So choose
Will you stand up?
Will you be heard?
Will you be first?
I will
Take by force
Start the revolution
