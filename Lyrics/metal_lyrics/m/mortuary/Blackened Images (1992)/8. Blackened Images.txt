[Lyrics: J. Alanis, Music: J. Alanis / A. Mtz.]

I'll say this with all
The hate of my heart
The images of this world
Are blackened as hell

Take a look in
Into the church
People like zombies
Hearing and answering as clones

Thousands of saints deified
Thousands of dungy cults
From a shallow culture
Approaching the feeble minds

Image... not feel, not hear
Virgins... are there many as they say?
I don't adore no image
Death forever it's all you'll see!
