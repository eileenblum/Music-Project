[Lyrics and, Music: J. Alanis]

Awaiting the call
Now you're prepared to die
Now death takes your soul
The mourning rites so fool

No sorrow, no pain, no grief
Prepared to face the reality
No sorrow, no pain, no grief
The mourning is not fatality
Useless rites that finish in your death

Nine days the dead is rot
The prayers and the masses continued
Squandered days he's not with God
He's in his tomb he lives in hell
He's not preocupated for your faith
And you guard respect for his death

The meeting is presided by Satan
You want to hear dead's voice and cry
Demons answer your question and live
In your rotten mind by a false faith
Originated in your turbulent infancy
In which you loved an image - passionately

Rites of death
Feel the pain
Die in second death
Bastard servant of the whore
Are you prepared to die?
Diiiieee!!!!

No sorrow, no pain, no grief
Prepared to face reality
No sorrow, no pain, no grief
The mourning is not fatality
Useless days that finish in your death
Useless days that finish in your death!
