[Lyrics: J. Alanis, Music: P. Guevara]

The night is black
A fanatic comes with fear
Will be slayed
By his mind and his fear
The blood will flow
And will flow into the flames of hell
This will be
A bloody and hellish nightmare

Reign of dead
After die you must go there
Sadistic demons
Massacring your rotting soul
Destroying
Your twisted mind and your senses
And with pain
You will go to his reign

Demons crucifix you in your mind on a cross
Feel the knife lacerating your intestines
And the priking needle injecting acid in your veins
Your blood flowing like blood's spring

The red and black fire
Insensibling your mind
Your internal storm
Make you feel fear of your pyre
Haulding swords
And killing Christians
Total massacre await you
In the reign of dead

Angels kill
That's the cause of your fear
Forever you'll die
Tormenting your mind it's weak
Black star of the night
Will curse the false Christianity
And after you'll die
To live eternally

Demons crucifix you in your mind on a cross
Feel death comes when a spoon pull your eyes
Experiment the pain as a sword cross your rotting soul
Ready to depart to the lake of fire, tortures without end
