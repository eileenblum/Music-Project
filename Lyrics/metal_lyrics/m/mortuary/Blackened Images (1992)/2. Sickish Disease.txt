[Lyrics and, Music: J. Alanis]

Screams and cries I hear
From this rancid world
The virgin is infested
By pollution and twisted thoughts
While the wise seeks below
Religion fall no slow
Suffering the pain
As your blood is turned to shit

Sickening...
...Sickish disease

Babies borning with the sword inside
Their infested fathers now they must die
Bastard Pope he lies in his world
He loves the gay, lesbian and whore

Walk with care cause you can die
Satan's whore is free for your soul
You fuck her body the virus inside
Soon your life decay and die

Insanity beget insanity
As evil beget evil
As pain beget pain
As pest beget pest
As sickish beget death
As your death beget pleasure!

Quest for sanity
Insanity beget insanity
Infamous game of death
They must die again
While the wise seeks below
Religion fall no slow
Suffering the pain
As your blood is turned to shit

Sickening...
...Sickish disease
