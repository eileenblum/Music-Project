[Lyrics: J. Alanis, Music: A. Martinez / J. Alanis]

Inhalation of insanity, the bastard now must die
Infect by blood, asphyxia in my brain

Suffering my mind
Tortured is my brain
How long can I resist?
Gasping diseased

Days will pass, I'm here inhalating bastardity
This is the meaning of kill, If I survive my mind will decline

My mind is trapped
Into a sea of toxic blood
No live to pain
No pray to save me from hell
This is real
No bastard images vomiting my brain
War between
To live and die!

Suffering my mind
Tortured is my brain
Suffocated thoughts
Asphyxiation!
