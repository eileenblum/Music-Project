[Lyrics: J. Alanis, Music: A. Martinez]

Down below the gates of hell
The apocalypse has begun
From open abyss they are here
Tormenting souls, injecting fear

You want to run - there is no hope
You want to escape - your evil fate
You want your death - it's all you need
Desperated - death is not here

Deformed faces by endless horror
Your heart tries to change your soul is sealed
Torture in your bare flesh
Suffering while you seek death, no way to die!

Images around you
The last day comes this is the truth
Horror, torture
Undeceived is your mind
Five angels passed
Abyss angel
Is reigning

Down below the gates of hell
The apocalypse has begun
Torture in your bare flesh
Suffering while you seek death

You want to run - there is no hope
You want to escape - your evil fate
You want your death - it's all you need
Desperated - death is not here
Await the worst!!!
