[Lyrics and, Music: J. Alanis]

Death was made to me
But in life I'll kill the priest
The name of darkness bless me
In this kingdom reigns the beast

I profane the tombs of dead
I don't leave 'em rest in peace
I believe in death
Cause soon comes to you with ease

...Sacrilegious...

I'll never believe in church
Her lies makes me feel like a dog
Spit and burned by hell
In which she will burn in spell

Falsity inculcated in you
I'll show you the truth
You need learn to hate the false
First see through all your life

Sacrilegious in war with God
Hungry of perversity
Can do what you want
Ignore the weak image

...Sacrilegious...
