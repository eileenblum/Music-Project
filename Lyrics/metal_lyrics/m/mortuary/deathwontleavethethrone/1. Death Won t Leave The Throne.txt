Seen the past this night
Fast this life will die
Human demons fight
To fright under red sky
Flying metal strikes
In unweaponed minds
Demons fire and fire
Death won't leave this life!

Life future begins
Extermination wins
Battle never ends
The cycle once again
Tyrants hold their power
The dark throne they desire
Hard's to take the crown
Death won't leave the throne!

[Lead: Frimost]

Lies rise higher and higher
With blood sign is the hire
Rise your bloody hand
Life screams in demand
Morbid torrid winds
From unholy wings
Smell the ancient power
Death breath comes like fire!
