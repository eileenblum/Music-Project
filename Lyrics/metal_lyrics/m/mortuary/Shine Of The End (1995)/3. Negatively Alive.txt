Alive
What is to be alive?
To exist
In this filthiness called earth
I can understand
I do not deny life
But what is there behind?

Windows to the world
My eyes are
Hunger, sickness
Crime, war and death

[solo: Martinez]

Where are we?
Sometime I read a tale
About a place
Where the fire was a...
Eternal pain
For each one who fell
Where demons fed
Of cruelty and horror

[solo: Martinez]

I do not believe
This human doctrine
Just here we are
In this kind of infernal land

What's the difference
Between the tale and our earth?
The world burns and you can see
The pain and torture
The demons you can even see

[solo: Garza]

Alive
What is to be alive?
Perversity and lies
Rule the world

Could exist
A positive side?
I could see it
If I survive the end
