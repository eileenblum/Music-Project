[solo: Alanis]

Tormenting the minds of children
With a place called inferno
Where the torment into fire
Awaits you if you're a sinner

Who's reached until a window of hell
And tell that story?
Only an untrue doctrine
Is teaching that lie

[solo: Martinez]

Get your feet
Down on the ground
And live reality
Inferno is here in life

Why tell lies
Someday they'll be known
Among lies I want to see
The perfect fall
