People are walking on the fire
Evil is ruling the lands
Driving their thoughts toward the end
Controlling their acts a blind faith

The eyes of my god are upon us all
All the time watching our ways
Stinking smell of repugnance
Off this contortionned race

When the sky fades black
Nobody will rule your fate
You want to be destroyed trying to live
Last day is near - holocaust shine

Time to eat, live
And time to die
Is near vultures feast
Still you are wallowing
In the fire
Soon you will twist
In your own blood

[solo: Garza]

Filthiness, feebleness
And stupideness
In those ways
The feeble is ruled
Over all the world
Insanity lives
Bastardity, humanity
Transformed in pigs

I just want to see your glorious demise
In this day I can see the end shine
Armageddon rise up!
Glorious day, all this will be destroyed

[solo: Martinez]
