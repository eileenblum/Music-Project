[solo: Martinez]

Being horrorized
By the fear to reality
And reality lived among them
The truth has...
In the depths of their brains
The lie lives

Besieged by insanity
Which causes them
A great pleasure
There was not sanity
Only sick minds
By the internal disgrace
Of a wretched 
Mundane
Existence
