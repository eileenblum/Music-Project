[solo: Garza]

Following blindmen
Following sterile minds
Advancing mentally
To an illusion misery
True, aberrant
Majestical reality
Of the pathetic
And poor humanity

Black water, dark sky
Poisoned air, extinct species
Eyes that wait
Mesmerize for a piece of bread
Liberty and slavery
Hand in hand
Retrorevolution is the world's brand

[solo: Martinez]

Keeping the hope that some day
The doors to mortality shall open
To enter into the world
That exists in my mind
Where there is no autumn
And where the minds never decay
