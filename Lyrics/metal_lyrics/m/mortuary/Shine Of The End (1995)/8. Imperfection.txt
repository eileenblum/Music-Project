I'm walking upon this world
And the things are as real
And imperfect as death
Life vanishes quickly
Imperfection and sickness
Live within us
Carefully, mentally and spiritually
I am not pure, are you
I live into imperfection and sickness
And so you do

Living the perfection
Of being alive
Living the imperfection
Of living
What I can see is the anxiety
Of seeing perfection
And the perfect
Imperfection of death

It all begins to decay
When I ask myself
Where are you
Did never found perfection?

I see the sea,
The sky, the sun, the stars
And they all have a shine
Ever seen in any human

[solo: Martinez]

Hear the whisper of the night
What's what you hear?
Now open your eyes
What's what you see? Think!

Now I am seeing myself
And imperfections on me
What are you expecting from me?
I'm not telling this as an excuse
Of my imperfection
And sins

[solo: Garza]

You can see my outside
But you can't see my thoughts
What you are hearing and reading
Is just a piece of my being
