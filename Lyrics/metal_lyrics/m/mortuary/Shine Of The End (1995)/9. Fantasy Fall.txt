You think that things will change
And you'll ascend to heaven by saying
"Lord, lord, I believe in you"

You believe in a man
Who is just like you
The difference is
He tells more lies
By telling you with a host
"Corpus christi is within you"
And at confessing he could tell you
"I forgive your sins"

Who is he
Or who is in this earth
That could tell
What's right or wrong?
Weak of mind
You who believe in men
Who can release you
Of your sins?
Who can tell
You are forgiven
In this rotten world?

[solo: Martinez]

Twilight living
In the dark side
Blinded by a lie
Makes you believe
In a man like you
Telling you
"God is with us
He's an envoy from heaven
Can you believe this, I do not
