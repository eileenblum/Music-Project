Fighting against a natural
Invisible force
My life tries to escape from me
I am fighting
Against myself
But it just seems that I'm dying

My body wants to go
To his tomb
But my mind wants to live
It is natural live!
But my body and my soul
Want to die now

[solo: Martinez]

Awaiting the irreversible
Call of my demise
Sickness!?
Is on me
Convulsions, contortions
Liquid spewing from my mouth
Screams never heard before
Which live and rise from me
Screams of desperation
And pain
Which vanish
In space

[solo: Garza]

I'm turning in my death bed
My fight will soon be finished
I feel it, I feel it... come

Now I can't
I can't tell nothing else
Just my mind think
Think and die
