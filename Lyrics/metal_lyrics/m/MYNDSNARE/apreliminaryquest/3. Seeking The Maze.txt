Exploration of a mind
Spreading outward...
Into the universe
Disgust fills my soul
Points of light missing...

The evil urges of life,
A natural state
Universal constants leave in their wake
A fusing mass of hydrogen
Chaotic entropy freewheeling through infinities of temporal states

Why consider orderly atoms as life?
Why believers are we in the unknown?
Why deceive ourselves with a created fate?

Hang on by the tips of my fingers
To the narrow ledge of sanity
The largesse of existence
Confuses me

A dream within a dream
Innocent of comprehension
A well made model
Of a larger creation
Questioning beliefs, the answer is created
Aid our insanity
To restore sanity

Lock up our minds
Deep within our selves
Safely cruise
Through the universe's bends
Need a grip on life
What the fuck is life?
Pitfalls abound...
You get snared in the end

Like mice in the maze
Seeking the way
Creating the way
It's eating the way
Do I...
Create the maze?
