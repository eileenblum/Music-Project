Scrutinizing
Telepathic
Exercising
My inner self

Needing
Feeding
Myself into my self

I fill myself into images
I know they don't ring true
I create a wall of thought
Opaque, invisible, extant, not...

I look into the Mirror
The Mirror looks into me
I see what I want
I want what I see
In the Mirror of Nothingness
I create a reality
It's so easy, it's so free

Live in that world
That I create, I mould
Push it to the extreme
Watch it grow, unfold

Control every step, control every fold
Deny the unpleasant, resist the bold

I look into the Mirror
The Mirror looks into me
I see what I want
I want what I see
In the Mirror of Nothingness
I create a reality
It's so easy, it's so free
