Modes of time, dancing light
Feathery wings of twilight
Glances of space
Deform, slight?
Instant change of infinite might
Every single touch, beware
Stay your hand, you
Know not the power
Stretching beyond you
Reflections in twin mirrors
The instantaneous infinity

Grasping everything in a moment
Blithe, denial of possibilities
Invisible, unthought connections
Stream forward on a single plane

Look back, you see
The mould
Memorize it -- you cannot
I have recreated it
So have you

The art of prediction, pre direction
The movement of lives, universes
The power is yours, use it right
The power is mine to abuse

Look back, you see
The mould
Memorize it -- you cannot
I have created it
So have you

Changes created in the infinite folds
Look back, you see
The mould
Memorize it -- you cannot
I have created it
So have you
