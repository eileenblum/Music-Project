I scream until you like it
I live until you die
A prism of different mirrors
Distil into blood-red nothing
I scream until I die

Polished, packaged and camouflaged
Endless eloquence, rarely perceived

You lay your
Sheet of beliefs
On me
Making me
Your own
Your own all-seeming blindness
Ignorant knowledge

The empty paper calls me
Write something deep, something painful
Something you might want to live for; to see
Someone you cannot be

Live through me, live through mine
Make me do the things you never could
Create a world, put me in it
You'll never see -- it's you that I mould

Bleed me, feed me
With your mortal words
Fill me; kill me, with a pride that wasn't mine
Thrill me; opinions that choke
Vitalise the real me
