Use the same old pain
Wait for the day to end
Use the same old pain
Five hours to go and ten riffs to send
Use the same old pain
The end of creation, creating the end
A slot in a rut a hole in the head
A black nemesis dark light a focal despair
Gravitate round the point of eternal blackness
Like an eclipsed bright a coronal head
Use the same old pain
Creating an entity washed up and disbelieved
Believe in one's own self
And falsely you'll be healed
Point blank towards a blank point
Using the same old pain
Again and again
Surrounded by meaning, meaningless infinity
Trapped within a point, too blind to see
Choose to look around
Feel the way over the ground
Hunt for pitfalls beneath the surface
Sink your feet into their cold embrace
Use the same old pain
The morning star burns
Bright in the night sky
Keep your head up, details pass you by
Lose interest in the life you live in
Higher than thought
Than existence you seem
Stumble and fall through
The clouds the stars gleams
Oh, so close it seems
