The human condition
Of misery and pain
Contribute to a lexicon
Of mortal remains
Legacies of civilizations
Unseen, unheard ?
So, what importance is
Say, a new song?
Fill-in-the-blanks in the spaces of time
Create the reality with the power of the mind
Kill a hundred people, maim a thousand more
For beliefs that you're willing to die for
The human condition
Of misery and pain
Contribute to a lexicon
Of mortal remains
Legacies of civilizations
Unseen, unheard
Nothing important saves the absurd
The suffering masses, blame it on their lord
For any place to put the shame -- create a mental Mordor
Kill all the Christians, the Muslims, the Jews
Damn into eternity the complacent Hindus
Creations of tact and one-time mastery
Waste all the men around, and then you'll be free

The human condition
Of misery and pain
Contribute to a lexicon
Of mortal remains
Legacies of civilizations
Unseen, unheard
So of what importance is
Anything, save the absurd
Kill a hundred people, maim a thousand more
For all the beliefs that
You're willing to die for
Waste them away, kill them all
And then you'll be master
Then you'll be free
All of eternity, free, bloody and free
