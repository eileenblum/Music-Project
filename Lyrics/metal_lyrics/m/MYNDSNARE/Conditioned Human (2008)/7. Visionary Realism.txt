The gates of reality crash in
Another dreamer gasps for breath
Is there no place here, on earth
For those of us who want to win?

Some peoples' quests last forever
Some has nothing to look for
For some it comes so easy
To open yet another door

But for those who need to stumble
From day to day, from door to door
Isn't there a higher power
To let them know there's more

In this life of mine I've seen
Some funny things and a dream
No one told me, it would be so
That dreamers have nowhere to go

But even in the midst of all
There is this peace inside
In the toughest times of life
I keep running there to hide
