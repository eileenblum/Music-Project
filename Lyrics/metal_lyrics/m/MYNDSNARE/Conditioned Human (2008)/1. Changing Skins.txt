Every day a new me
Every day a new skin
I'm me within
The centre of a tornado
Stillness
Oppressive, dull
Nascent, emotion
Intent, culled
A vacuum filled with nothing
Calm, explosive force
Tides of matter sweeping
Scope, such devastating force
A mind filled with vitality
Creation, a dozen six days
Powerful, vital, alive

A paraplegic to the world
I orchestrate my world
Never ending chaotic overtures
Orchestrated by the world
I orchestrate my world
Forever ending chaotic overtures
Reasons   by to suit the circumstances
Flickering images hurtle into oblivion
Reality shifting, filling within sockets
Sockets of the mind, identity defines
Orchestrated by the world
I think
I orchestrate the world
Every day a new me
Every skin a new me
Every day a new skin
