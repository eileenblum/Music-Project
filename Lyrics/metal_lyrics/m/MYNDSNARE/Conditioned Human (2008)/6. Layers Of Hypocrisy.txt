A negative imagery is all we have
To think of and feel, to decide
Desperation on an endless road
Roll the stone, relive again

And again and again

One with yourself
So hard to be
Layers of hypocrisy
Adapting, creating, mutating, unseeing
Fitting into the assembly line
Mindless thought for mindless thought
Never stopping, a battle never fought

Streamlined, never a thought

Searching for the kick
Of non-existence
Of a direct link
Between yourself and your self
Your self and yourself...

Meanings once known
Naivety was the cure
Once you were unseeing
Once were you pure?
Actions to fit consequences
Reasons manufactured
Cover, define your existence
With a layer of rationales

Searching for the kick
Of non-existence
Of a direct link
Between yourself and your self
Your self and yourself...

The eternal hunt for consciousness
Sip from the fount of reason, slip...
Drunk with the pleasures of life
You miss the importance
Passivity to the actual priorities
That you know should define you
A solution probably not extant
Blindly stumbling, a zombie ritual
On an end being in sight
Decide to ignore, fight, despise
Despise, decide, fly...
