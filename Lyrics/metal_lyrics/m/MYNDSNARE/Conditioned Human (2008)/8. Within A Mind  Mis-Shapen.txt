In humanity
We live
Learning of the desires, the desired, to thrill
In humanity, we believe
Creating images of holy life, we contrive

In humanity, we are
A mass of intelligence in a planet of art

In humanity, we crave
Of our neighbours what we seldom gave

In humanity, so brave
Killing the benevolent, defiling the naÃ¯ve

INHUMANITY, WE ARE
Seekers of material wealth and a wall

INHUMANITY, WE ARE
For humanity is in, by crook or by sin
Inhumanity is in, reality is not
Inhumanity is in, reality is not
