Witness the madness
Inflicting pain on others
Innocent people dying
Human sacrifice

People mourning for their losses
Carry the lost
To the cross, so many broken hopes
This is genocide

Words they preach I can not relate
Driven blindly by their faith
Testifying acts of hate in the name of God

Are they justified
Justified to take lives
Catives inside their web of lies

Wrecking the sanctity of life
Harvesting our excellence
Only to destroy, twisted obsessions

Dark words of power,
Incantalations from the script
Twisting the message, revenge is bliss

Human failure we are not God
You mortal fools
Blinded by faith, turning the message of love
Into hate, paradise will not be reached
By taking a life
Fearing these words, there is no release
By suicide

I cannot relate
By their faith acts of hate
In the name of god
