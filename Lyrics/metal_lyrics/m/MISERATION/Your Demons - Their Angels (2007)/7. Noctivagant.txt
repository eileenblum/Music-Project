Your soul and mind, under his will of power
His abuse of people, touches the very core
Weakend souls, captivated by his seduction
The naked truth, is in disguise.

Suffocating in your own remorse
Fearing the unexpected
Suffering taking a form of it's own

Through isolation, being alone
It manifests and takes control
The reality unfolds
Unaware about the surroundings
A life under enslavement
Following the shallow

Morbid thoughts that dominate
Always confined in the dark
No rays of light, no land of mark
Feeling that I'm going blind, losing my mind

Do you hear these words I say
Deceit confused
Abused a vicious circle
Life of decadence
A battered soul
Your reality creation of evil
Manifestation of fear
