As you look into the depths of darkness
Illusions of your mind, pursued by horror
Standing in the midst of total desolation
Trapped with the mask of sanity

Seven-driven by the seven deadly sins
Imprisoned by infinite horizons
Seven-deserted in a world without conception
Marked by the seven deadly sins

Deprived innocence from the dawn of time
A drowning mind in a dark embrace
Feel the thorns piercing the flesh
Massive neurosis and impending doom

Lust
Gluttony
Greed
Sloth
Wrath
Envy
Vanity
