Corruption taking the place of justice
Mockers of believers faith
This mental scar, forever engraved
Human values are degrading
A premonition for their future

Under subjection of the fallen one
Blasphemy depravity complete denial of Christ
In difference is your excuse
And ignorance your refuge
Your twisted personality
Senseless is your reality

Evidence of abominations open your eyes
It's an actual fact this mental scar
Forever engraved, existence of abominations
Don't close your eyes it's time to react

Who sees the forgotten ones
Can you tell me any difference
Were just  not the same
One step closer to the madness

Absolute behaviour  in the name of science
Emptiness-feeding their souls
The fall of man is now at hand.
