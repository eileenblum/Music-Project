The greatest deceiver, known to all men
Life consumer the one unseen
Poison running through my veins
A static mind no control, rales my every move

Nothing feels right, pushed to the edge
Have I lost it all
I am about to break

Living a constant lie my emotions have me paralyzed
I need a remedy, make me whom I suppose to be
It is too late for regrets

Looking in the mirror, don't recognize what I see
The life in me is gone, fear tormenting me
Guilt won't let me be feeling useless
Invisible to the world
The undecided truth , I am the pretender
Living the lie concealing the truth , the great deceiver
Known to all men, life consumer, the one unseen
