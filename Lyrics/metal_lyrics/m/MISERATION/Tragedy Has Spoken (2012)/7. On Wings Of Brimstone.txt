As often,
Throughout my journal
I found keys in thoughts
Of prayer
In the dim minds
Implements lies
Belief enabled
My malevolent cause

I watched how they cried
And how they fell
Every misery, every pain
With my signature

I came in disguise
Of wrath and conflict
To once more cause great alarm
Made them breathe
The air of ashes
Through broken glass
To the floor of the burial vaults

Forced to face your demise
Just as they were
In every sorrow ever lived,
I am the same

[Chorus]
On wings of brimstone
A fire-ridden fate
On wings of brimstone
A new form of hate
On wings of brimstone
A horror-stricken wait
On wings of brimstone
On wings of brimstone

As it all came down
In conclusion there was no god there,
None and zero
Only I stood that ground - me
With your progeny,
In shackles

Ruthless slaughter
Insane maiming
My endless work
Human - you will never see

[Repeat chorus]
