In the autumnal colors
A brilliance to blindness
Land of the rising sun
Over which shadow prevailed

The much anticipated
Island project
Made in me potent science
A force to tame, a fatal force
The trinity's threshold passed

[Chorus]
In the midst of flame -
A new sun,
Forming the perfect darkness
Totems of a fire-breathing age
And the damage done
Ghost adaptation
Its knell across the plain
Coming on the wings of the wind
White light - black rain

Potsdam issued
Declaration rejected
And I could launch
Absolute destruction
In the gutter they would die
I made them all die

[Repeat chorus]

Like an abyss
It opened up
Silent thunder
Struck through everything

[Repeat chorus]
