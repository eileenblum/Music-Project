Sterilization and radiation
Acids introduced to the body
In pains and living nightmares
The appointed descent

From those black hearts' depths
Out into every finger, ever nail
To steal innocence from me
Injecting with the horrors and phenol

[Chorus]
The doctors would create
Only reason to reduce
And to desecrate
Children of the flames

And the dark windows
They would stay shut
Blackened out, as pupils closed

Sterilization and radiation
Acids introduced to the body
In pains and living nightmares
The appointed descent

From those black hearts' depths
Out into every finger, ever nail
To steal innocence from me
Injecting with the horrors and phenol

[Repeat chorus]

Children - of - the flames!

And the dark windows
They would stay shut
Blackened out, as pupils closed
Monsters and experiments
