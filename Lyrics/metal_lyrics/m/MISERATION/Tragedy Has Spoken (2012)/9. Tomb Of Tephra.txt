A thousand years
And more have passed
I confess, I dream it still
How I could open up the ground
Tipping the ebullient bowl
Once more

[Chorus]
Rain, rain - my fire down
For days and many nights
Pain, pain - of gruesome kind
In the tomb of tephra

I would be cracking the damned core
To your earth's deadly uterus
Seed my spite in ancient fire
And then let it rain again

With fierce nature
I was approaching
With intention to
Undo all the patterns
Running forth, breaching
And covering
What an irony and blessing
Of Vulcania

Out of sight,
For sixteen centuries
O their remains
No one will ever know
Their overwhelming
No one but I
And so it must be

[Repeat chorus]
