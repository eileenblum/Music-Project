Heretics pushed and shoved
Through the streets
Hunted, hated and then slain
The blasphemy of politics
Below the throne
Until there would be
No scapegoat left

That wicked November
O winters gloom
Tuned from grey to red
By dying birthrights - a king
On the horizon shadows move

[Chorus]
Jus canonicum
By religion summoned
Jus canonicum
For silver and pride
Jus canonicum - jus canonicum

Hails unto the new king
Born to the ending of others
And that spiteful past
Pointed to who were next to die

[Repeat chorus]

Hails unto the new king
Born to the ending of others
And that spiteful past
Pointed to who were next to die

That wicked November
O winters gloom
Tuned from grey to red
By dying birthrights - a king
On the horizon shadows move

And the rightful had their way
On the drawing board of my deeds
Will they ever forget centuries ago
I must not let you know

(...Stepping... Stone... Stepping...)

In damp air of cellars deep
Where feuds and scorn gave no sleep
For a royal crown, in hunger
Under man-made law enslaved

[Repeat chorus]
