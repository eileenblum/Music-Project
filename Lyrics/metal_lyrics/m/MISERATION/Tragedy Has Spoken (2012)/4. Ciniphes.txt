The land of Egypt must cry
Man and beast alike
They will all be affected
For reasons they may only guess

Sun O sun, Mighty sun
How they worshipped you
But mightier was I
And you knew me since long
You the enemy
With false pretence - Ra

Some say it was God
Who came in wrath
I say no - It was only I
Who knows none

I whispered a spell of madness
And the dust metamorphosed

Sun O sun, Mighty sun
How they worshipped you
But mightier was I
And you knew me since long
You the enemy
With false pretence - Ra

Ciniphes!
