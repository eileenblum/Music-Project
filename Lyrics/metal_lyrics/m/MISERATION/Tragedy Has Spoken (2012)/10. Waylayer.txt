Overwhelmed
By unrelenting wrath
For how could I ask them
To forgive
Everything I hold in my being
Which not even I can redeem
From my conscience

[Chorus]
I, the soothsayer
I will see you through
I'm what feeds your prayer
I am the waylayer

No logic was never on
My agenda
I will make them all hurt -
You as well
Some day
Chances are we'll be together
But please bear in mind
Who I am
In the paradigm of nature
With terrible powers,
Almost divine

[Repeat chorus x2]
