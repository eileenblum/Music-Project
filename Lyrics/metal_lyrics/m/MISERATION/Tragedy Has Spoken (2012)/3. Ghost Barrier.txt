Lost behind the furthest border
Below the anatomy of the sea
Ionized fervency - stifling vacuum
O my calamity,
A vacant secret tomb

[Chorus]
Invisible horizons
Undraped by ancient fears
The three-way eye of extinction
Closed, yet all-seeing
Behold as vanishing appears

So say,
Did it not look a lot like blood
They had all been warned
Caution - the green depth,
In stirring
The triangle has always been mine

[Repeat chorus]

Down on the surface
They wear away
Mouth of hell
Eating shrouds of reality
The outer world

Hundreds of years ago,
Already then

[Repeat chorus]

The three-way eye of extinction!
