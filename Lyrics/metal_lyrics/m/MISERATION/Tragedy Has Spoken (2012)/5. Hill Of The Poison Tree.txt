Fields -
Of the dead still burning
Yields -
Them as they keep on turning
In the highest form of
That depraved
Hidden realm of inflicting
My sting

[Chorus]
Asphyxiate and bleed
Their years of cleansing
On the hill of the poison tree
Strychnos nox vomica

Think -
If ever spiders or reptiles
Scare you when they're near
You would not believe,
Unless you were really there
The purest veracity
Of that fear

[Repeat chorus]

Strychnos - nox vomica!
