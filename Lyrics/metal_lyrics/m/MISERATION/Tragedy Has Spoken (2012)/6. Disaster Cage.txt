A marionette played,
Made to fail
My fingertips
On such a perfect tool
Reactor four - spread me out

[Chorus]
Like a flower of abomination
Folding out
I grew in my satisfaction
With every living thing
That died

Reorganize and mutate
The life systems
Stagnant forms
And mysterious shapes
Adapt your world to mine
The world where no light shines

[Repeat chorus]

...That died!

Incomplete -
No thriving there no more
Put to sleep -
No life, no sun, no thing
This minor apocalypse
Merely a glimpse
Of my ungodly desire
The winds carried me far
Incomplete -
No thriving there no more

[Repeat chorus]

...That died!
