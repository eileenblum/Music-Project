My victories I know of well
but in my eyes they dim fast into nothing
A constant of struggles
by not knowing a static foundation.

Always tomorrow, never today.
Always tomorrow, forget I pled for yesterday.

Only he that fears dying will pave his way
according to his will through life.

In no record of time will it read
of how the world was won nor lost.
Be it what may ahead in time
Only a memory lit for a second in eternity's passing.

It will not remain to be saved.
It will shatter, and gone as it never ever were.

Only he that fears dying will pave his way
according to his will through life.

Only I that hear the children crying
will save the day following this crippled life.

Such is the path of this solitude
It is not for you, not for anyone but one.
One of struggles, choices come now
One of losses made strong.

Such is the path of this solitude
It is not for you, not for anyone but one.
One of struggles, choices come now
One of losses made strong.

Only I that hear the children crying
will save the day following this crippled life.
