To live is to suffer, or so they say
A constant of overcoming pains and wounds.

In the heart or the temple of soul
orbits a sinister sun
both in us and above.
To burn us away one final day,
so we live in open agony
or illusion indulged.

To live is to suffer, or so they say
A constant of overcoming pains and wounds.

But refuse to be small,
weak or the victim
To any cost, live as if there were
no one thing bothering.

Do it and rejoice
in a strange twilight paradise.
Twilight paradise.

One with hurt, one with joy
One that is the only one
Survive, and death shall reward as best,
shall reward as best...

One with hurt, one with joy
One that is the only one.
Twilight.

Survive, to any cost.
There in lies the secret of life
And all death of the sulphury sun.

But refuse to be small,
weak or the victim
To any cost, live as if there were
no one thing bothering.

Do it and rejoice
in a strange twilight paradise.
Twilight paradise.

But refuse to be small,
weak or the victim
To any cost, live as if there were
no one thing bothering.

Do it and rejoice
in a strange twilight paradise.
Twilight paradise.
