I am eating bits of the world
Piece by piece
I swallow broken glass and grow
Who am I, that can carry all this
Who am I, that can suffice this

[Chorus A:]
I that make
Blood turn iron aglow
Swirling chaos
It may appear
I that take
All that give birth and life

Destroying the universe, atom by atom
I make love to the light
And leave it with terrible disease
Who am I, that can carry all this
Who am I, that can suffice this

[Chorus B]
I that make
Blood turn iron aglow
But discipline
Is what to find in Death
I that take
All that give birth and life

There a star went black
So watch now close
How i make suns burn all red
Then turn them all dead
Who am I, that architects all this
Who am I, that architects all this

[repeat chorus A]

But discipline
Is what to find in Death
