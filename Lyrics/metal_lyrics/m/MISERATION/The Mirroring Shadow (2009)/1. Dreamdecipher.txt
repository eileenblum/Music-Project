I lay upon your thought one needling eye
Another I cast into a spring as it was already told
But no care i have for the days masquerade
For my solitude creation

[Chorus]
With maps to the wilderness
In dreamdecipher
With charts of the construction of a planet
I dreamdecipher

Though I know it is mine
your dreamed new day
That which you made unforgotten
the sights I have witnessed
For what heaven alone can forgive ye
But most of all i hope that none ever shall
For dreams such as those

[Solo: Plec]

Subconscious godliness or devildom
a will and a hater was born

[repeat part 1]
[repeat chorus]
