Steps are hard to balance here
Gone far, in a maze lost.
A smell luring with wickedness
Addicting spirit and soul.

Lust of joy and disease harden,
then break my body down.
Gravity killing intellect
around a black hole.

Closer now, body aching
Mind goes blank
Slow sacrifice for those unseen.

Forbidden words spoken
in forests of concrete and steel
Magick dusted on eyes through drugs.

Invisible gateways open up the ground
Tunnels of darkness with no ends.
Creatures undefined - shapeshifting.

Worms and insects invited
to touch, to invocate, to feed me,
skin me of old scaled skin.

And I, to learn secrets of undying,
Find instruments to master life's force.
Drug myself with chemicals of youth
to go to sleep and wake unweary.

Closer now, body aching
Mind goes blank
Slow sacrifice for those unseen.

Invisible gateways open up the ground
Tunnels of darkness with no ends.
Creatures undefined - shapeshifting.

Invisible gateways open up the ground
Tunnels of darkness with no ends.
Creatures undefined - shapeshifting.

Invisible gateways open up the ground
Tunnels of darkness with no ends.
Creatures undefined - shapeshifting.
