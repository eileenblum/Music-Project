See these bleeding hands that you left to dry
Your garden is stolen, your flowers died
Bow to your own deeds, bow down in shame
May the woods have mercy on your soul

Let the water flow again
Vapour rises in my eyes
Shedding my tears on the water
And watching them float into the fog

I sleep again
Come the shadows, drown the whispers
I dream away
Know tomorrow, let the night fall

And the shame is mine alone
Crawling into the deepest hole
Curling up around the core with closed eyes and clenched fists
And sinking down into my mindless rest

I sleep again
Come the shadows, drown the whispers
I dream away
Know tomorrow, let the night fall

Some say there's a shining path to follow when dark days come
But who needs that path when they're already here
And your candle is drowning in the rain

When the night falls
Misty sleep
For the sad ones
Misty sleep

They walk alone
