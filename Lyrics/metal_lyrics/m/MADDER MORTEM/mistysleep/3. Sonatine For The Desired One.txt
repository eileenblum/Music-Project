You make my blood boil
You make me real
You show me what my life could be

You make my eyes burst with stinging joy
You chain me down and I am free

The time for laugh has gone by
Now you should bow your head and cry
Your smiling sins not forgiven
I dive down into your pain
And then you let me down again
My smiling face is misgiven

I know you well enough 

I don't think you should have come forth this way
Feeling grows stronger every day
Your appearace here might be the thing I need
To get what I want
Drag it out from you

Come closer, and I'll let go in your hands
Spin me under
Into the deadly trance
From the deepest wish down to the major fear
I'm bringing my death
Life is more than near

Come feed me, and I will stop the tide
Still the hunger tearing so inside
Join the firedance and let yourself get burned
No end to pleasure
'Till earth stops to turn

I kow you well enough 

I don't think you should have come forth this way
Feeling grows stronger every day
Your appearance here
From out of nowhere you have come
So have your prize now
Step inside
