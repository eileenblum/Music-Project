Something's changing
I feel
I see
Tearing me to dust
Stillborn laughter
My master is here

How do I know?
Undertow tells me so
Down I go

Hard-eyed mirrors
I look
I see
Longing to be air
Long time missing, but waiting around

How do I know?
Undertow tells me so

I'm lethal
So stay forever under arms
When only fear holds you together
You'll come dancing
Leave them all

Starving proudly
I sleep
I win
Gone with the wind
Fairyland waiting
If I'm small enough, I'll go in

How do I know?
Undertow tells me so
