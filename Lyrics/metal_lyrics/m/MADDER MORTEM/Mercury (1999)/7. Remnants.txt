Heaven knows I've not been good to you
Heaven knows I've not been true to you
Wasn't nice to cut you up
Wasn't nice to make you bleed

So much time and so much love
So much time and so much love

I'm on to your tricks
I'm on to you
Darling

So much time and nothing's left
So much love and nothing's left
Wasn't nice to cut me up
Wasn't nice to make me bleed like this
