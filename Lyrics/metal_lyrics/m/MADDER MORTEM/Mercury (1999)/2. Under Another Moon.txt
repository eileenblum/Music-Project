The mist has covered my eyes
And whispers of sleep in my ear
The past has been swept off my hands
But I still remember your name

So lull me to sleep in your arms
Bestow your sweet kisses upon me
'Cause this love is all that I have
And I'll never long for more

Not going home

Time floats and the worlds pass me by
The air is thick and the moon has gone blind
Mind set adrift and my feet touch no ground
Banned from the dreamlands, I left all behind
All is lost, it can't be found
So weak here, I remember you
I can never find my way back home

Not going home
