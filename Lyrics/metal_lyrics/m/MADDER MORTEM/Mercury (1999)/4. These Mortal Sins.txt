Oh, it's really alluring
These mortal sins of the flesh
I never toy with amusement
And I have no time for repent

Down over my head
Silence, nothing unpleasant has been said

Define me and touch me and kiss me
Pretend I am your puppet on a string
Pretend I am yours and fully tamed now
What joy lies in these smallest, lawless sins

Down over my head
Silence, nothing unpleasant has been said

Under this coating of caring
Awaits the manipulating self
I never thought you could fool me
And my tears are already spent
