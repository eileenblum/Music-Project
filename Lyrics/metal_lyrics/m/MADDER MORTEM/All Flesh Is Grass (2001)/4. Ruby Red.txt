Send him from this land, he's bleeding
A display of pain worn as a crown

Are you strong?
Are you worthy?

Are you pure?
Are you clean and wholesome?

In his face the plea of mercy
Like a child corroding to a man

While the blood still flows he is enchanted
Ruby red, the streak of hidden malice hides the smile

Are you strong?
Are you worthy?

Are you pure?
Are you clean and wholesome?

Oh, there's cancer?
Oh, there's mistrust?
Burn and cut, burn and cut

There's nothing
There's nothing here
There was nothing before
You don't know this

Life can take you far, but this is further
Once the lie is in, will he prove worth it?
Know

(So we all give in) 

No defence will stand through pity
Powerless, kneeling before the bleeding heart
