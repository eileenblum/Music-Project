Where do you go?
I don't know

Cold carbon air
Breathing out filth
Breathing in burning blue
Nothing breaks me now

Go!

Let my hands go

Go!

(Today
The hour on time
The breathless second
Another perfect view)

(Today
A contradiction that talks one way
A blind, stuttering fool is healed
I'm not quite finished)

I am fire and reborn

Go!

(Today
A mirror broke in ecstasy
And desolation bled to death
I've been forgiven)

Go!

On hands and knees
Taking in all in one stride
I have covered my own tracks
and all falls into place

We will all go
