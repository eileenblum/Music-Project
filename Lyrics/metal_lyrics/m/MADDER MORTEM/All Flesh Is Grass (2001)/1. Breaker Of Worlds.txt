This is where forever opens
This is where all flesh is grass
This the mask and this the virgin
This is where it falls apart

Holy mother, triple goddess
Dream and death through blood evoke
Through your womb we bleed and burn and now:
Rise again

Breaker of worlds 

So the seed is sown to reap 
and so the blood is sweet anew
So intone the word not spoken
Now the time to break the truce

Ah! And the world splits apart
and the essence flows free
And whatever she gives
I am ready to take

For the keeper of the crossroads is the keeper of the keys;
the one who stirs your silent dreams, the one who wakes the fear
As she stands before you at the lake to lead you to the shore,
she's the one who is the breaker, she's the one who waits no more

Breaker of worlds
