Turn, turn
Let the rosegrove burn
Turn, turn
Watch the flies and learn
Turn, turn
Grinding it down
Turn, turn
Make it go on

Sleep tight, wait long
Hold on, stay strong

There is a beast within
And there's no peace without
I speak the lie as true
And it has blinded you

Sleep tight, wait long
Hold on, stay strong

Let the rosegrove burn
Watch it all come down
This is what I've earned
Watch the flies and learn

Thrown back in line
(So now the war is on)
Thrown back in line
(And now devotion's done)
Thrown back in line
(So let revulsion on)
And now the vultures come

Sleep tight
Wait long
Hold on 
Stay strong

Turn, turn
Let the rosegrove burn
Turn, turn
Watch the flies and learn

Turn
