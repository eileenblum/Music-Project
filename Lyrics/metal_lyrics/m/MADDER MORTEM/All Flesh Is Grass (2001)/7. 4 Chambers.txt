Chamber of the mourner
Ashes of a morning mass
Six feet of earth to lay 
On wooden home forever

Chamber of the griever
Hope of dawn cut away
Bowing to defeat 
This time the path cut short

Chamber of the sorrower
Mausoleums closed in silence
Wow given to fulfil
Let no one stand between

Chamber of the dead
Pleading spirits to awaken
Build the gate, brick on brick
There will be another key
