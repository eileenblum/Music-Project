There's a man far from here who made sure to stay well clear of taking hold or letting go, always choosing not to know
But then his bridges burned
Sometimes still he stops and turns, listening to open skies for broken words and severed ties

And I believe that wordless call he hears sometimes could reach us all

I stayed for so long where dream and day collide
Now I'm on fire

There's a girl, one I know, who wrapped up her heart in snow
Much too proud and much too vain, she thought she could hide her pain in that clean and crispy chill
To this day, she feels it still
Once frozen to the core, she's not who she was before

And I believe that chilling cold she feels sometimes could touch us all

I stayed for so long where dream and day collide
Now I'm on fire

Let it freeze, let it burn
Someday soon it is your turn to fall down as others fell
As they wept, you will as well
