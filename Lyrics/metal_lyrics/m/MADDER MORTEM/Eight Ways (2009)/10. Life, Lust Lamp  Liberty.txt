You know that something's coming and even fools would see the signs
So let's set fire to heaven and smother hell between our thighs

And we will live and we will breathe
(As it will always be)
All the world right at our feet
It is our right, it is our place
(As it will always be)
Life and lust and liberty

In golden fiery letters
Your wicked streak brought forth to shine
So strong and so elusive, a waking dream that is all mine

And we will live and we will breathe
(As it will always be)
All the world right at our feet
It is our right, it is our place
(As it will always be)
Life and lust and liberty

We go beyond the shells of flesh that hide the burning souls

Roaming free or fettered down - the choice is all our own
'Cause fate is just a string of bets we place as we go

And we will live and we will breathe
(As it will always be)
All the world right at our feet
It is our right, it is our place
(As it will always be)
Life and lust and liberty

See how we go
