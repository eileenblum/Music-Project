All I know is the light of lanterns hanging from the trees and the sound of the heart that beats to keep me here

And then the darkness falls
(It always does for the likes of us)
Stripped of voice and thought and cold on the ground
I fall between the stars

All I know is the path that led me out here on my own where there's no time
A lonely place for old and frozen stone

And the darkness falls
(It always will for the likes of us)
The distant burning suns of other worlds singing dreams of ruthless light

All I know is the light of lanterns hanging from the trees and the sound of my heart beating inside of me
