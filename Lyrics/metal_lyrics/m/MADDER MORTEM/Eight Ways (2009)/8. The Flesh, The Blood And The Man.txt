This morning reeks of disaster
A storm waits to unfold
Lover, come feed me your silences
Words could be too sharp and cold

Don't leave me out

I search for signs beneath each stone you're turning
I don't know how to keep myself un-bound
Oh, lover, you smile me such promises and then you veer away and bring my heart back down

Don't leave me out

Fight!
It's too easy to slip into lethargy
Crack a smile to uphold the illusion of truth
Close your eyes and keep getting lost in modality or make your peace with the flesh and the blood and the man

Here comes the haze again
Restless thoughts that chew through their tails much too soon
No answers, but no end to slick replies, empty and useless and groomed

Fight!
It's too easy to slip into lethargy
Crack a smile to uphold the illusion of truth
Don't close your eyes
Stop getting lost in modality
Make your peace
Make your peace with the man
