So now the bringer of unease has reappeared
He has dared to show his face within our walls
His visage hidden in the mouldy earth and his fingers in the waters I had calmed
His intrusion is a presence in the air and the fire is a nuisance to our hearts and he's showing off the secret little thoughts we kept apart

And then the trap will spring
Nip our heels and make us bleed
Just as we found our ease pops a monster out

Behold the travesty!
Get that monster out of here!

He is steadily uprooting all our plans, letting loose the sordid demons we had bound
Turning all our dainty gestures upside down and misplacing all the footholds we had found
Every corner holds a shadow to expose, every closet has a skeleton to show, and he's proudly re-displaying all we worked so hard not to know

And then the trap will spring
Just around our time of need
I fear the change he brings
Get that monster out of here

Behold the travesty!
Get that monster out of here!

I will mask the wounds I could not heal while you set your resolve
We'll be laughing at some joke we played while our options dissolve

It is only fate, my love
Who could wear it down?

Behold the travesty!
Get that monster out of here!
