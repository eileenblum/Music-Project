Time floats so slow here
We won just to lose
Here all walk solemnly
No light shines through

Here the waves break for you

Deep blue the spell on us
Old, sick and drained
All creation turned its face away to leave us blind and torn and failed

Here the waves break for you

Nothing stirs the underneath
Our hearts are so cold
Up above bright life ebbs and flows
Salty tears below

Here the waves break for you
Always

Here the waves will break
For you
