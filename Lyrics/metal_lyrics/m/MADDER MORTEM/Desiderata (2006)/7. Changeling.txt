Storyteller, bring your stories to my pyre
You, the tame man, be what I have learned to loathe
Tell me the secrets buried underneath
A thousand years of dirt
Tell me the fever chills your blood
You were the last
I'll be the first

Fall as you are and for good
I am here, there's nothing left to change

Life bleeds too soon, counting time down on us
Hope withers at my touch
Leaving it's ghosts to teach all colours grey

Change

Storyteller; see the futile smiles and answers
I will teach you not to taint my sweet control
I have a deeper kind of riddle
And a puzzle you won't solve
Laugh on your knees
Laugh for the changeling and the joke that took us all

Change
