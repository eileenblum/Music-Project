Useless words and scattered earth
Wring that neck for what it's worth
Curse the flood and hate the sun
I will see the damage done

Plague holds this land, flooded with milky tears:
Life dripping from their eyes
Burning their hearts to sleep

Pure salvation on your tongue
Drink the venom you've become
Traitor by necessity
Be the dirt that clings to me

Plague holds this land, flooded with milky tears:
Life dripping from faithless eyes
Will the surface sealed

Plague on this land!

None I loved and none I spared
I fulfill what I prepare
The remnants of your line
Lost the blood that now is mine

Plague holds this land, flooded with milky tears:
Life dripping from faithless eyes
Will the surface sealed

I have listened, I have come
I have torn you, one by one
Be the dirt that clings to me
