Sleep, take me now and never let me wake
Still in your hands, in your kingdom I'll be yours to break

Sleep, I am tired
I have blundered on to a path where I don't belong
Still in your hand, I'll be safe from where I could go wrong

Promise me a silver dream
Let your silence flow over me
Give me serenity and take away my will
Let your silence flow over me

Ghosts hold no pain
I surrendered years ago
Life has no claim on me
Let me slip quietly beneath
The pulsing noise of everyday
Life has no claim on me

Sleep if I beg of you, will you bleed all memory from my veins?
Cold in your arms, I'll have given all my hurt away
I am not afraid
I have waited on your doorstep too long
Take back my name
Close my eyes and turn my face away
