Speak so softly, I will hear you
Though your words are uncincere
All your talk amounts to nothing
And that nothing's not for me
Through a thousand smooth evasions
Your voice still rings in my ears

If you'd remember who you were
I could take hell out of your care
I could give you all I am

No more syllables to hide us
Fate dead within our hands
No more shadows and contortions
We have run out of lies

I could leave you undefended
Always hurting, always wrong
Leave you wanting and dependent
On a hope that'd let you down
But still your voice retains the phantom
Of all you wanted to be

I could give you all I am
Say my name

No more words to hide us
Fate dead within our hands
No more shadows and contortions
We have run out of lies

No more syllables to hide us
Say my name
