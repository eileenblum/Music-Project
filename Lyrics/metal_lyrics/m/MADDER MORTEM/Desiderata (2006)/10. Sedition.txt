Fate, I see your stare
Underneath your pale eyes
All is here, holding it's breath to have life

Smooth, sleek smiles howl at my door
To hold me down
Or move me on?
The pace makes it unclear
They smell of lust
Of sweetly silky rotting dust

Once they'll measure me coldly
Twice they'd beg me to try
Hope will always betray me
It's hand of stone has left the bitter mark on me

Hopes, atrocities and daydreams
Lay it all on me
The cause that I should die for
Lay it all on me

Fate, I see you stare
All is here
Fate, I could not care less
All is here
