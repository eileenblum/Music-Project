I open my eyes today
To leave the world of dreams behind
We all know the nothing
A hole in our hearts we try to forget
Or drown in jest and jokes
So I open my eyes today
To let myself be torn apart

In the rigid chill of my vow
All my dreams will die

My blood is seeded with hateful ghosts
Their cleaving hands upon my faults
Pleading my guilt as they pull me down
Into the sea of broken hope

How could I have known?
All my dreams were lies

I know
All my dreams were lies
All my dreams have died

Die.
