Spelling my name in analogies
Pulling your eyelids down
Over my silence, over your blind eyes
Building myself an anomaly
Building with breaking hands
Shutting the noise out
Driving the nails in
I have no name
My name is silence
I have no pain
Who would save you now?

Pulling myself through the windowpane
Kissing the broken glass
Drawing the walls close
Stitching my mouth shut
Resting my head on the demagogue
Leaning on burning sound
Tearing my words up
Putting my works down

I have no use for your bloodless compassion
Don't waste your indulgence on me
Nodding my head with the grinning ghost,
Loving the lucid flow
Too many mercies
Too many stale hopes
Turn my face to avoid your eyes
Swearing to let it go
Too many failures
Too many favours
