Blood to bind and love to damn me
Formed in clay, the fire has made me faceless
Torn to shreds, but I'm still standing
Never sleeping and never blinded

Sweetness taken from me in the moment I misspent
All good ripped out from me and the silence never ends

Blood to fade and love to wither
No one holds and nothing lives here
Faceless

Sweetness taken from me with a gesture of contempt
All good ripped out from me and the silence never ends

I could scream into finality
With the knowledge that's consuming me

Blood to bind and love to damn me
See me now and know that I am faceless
Blood that is purer than the poison in your veins;
Love that runs truer than the hatred and the pain;
That's the blood that runs in me

Blood to bind and love to damn me
