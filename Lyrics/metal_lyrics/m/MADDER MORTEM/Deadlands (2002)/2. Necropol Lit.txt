Remind
Here I am in Necropolis
Run my fingers down my spine
Beneath my feet a thousand ruins
Coming here in my own time

Here I am and here I'm staying
Queen of all that crawls and dies
Queen of crippled, blistered bodies
It's all done and it's all mine

Lay down all at your master's feet 
The taint is on you now
This is my turf, this is my land
so let the virtue go

And now I see in painful clarity
Intention that was and the truth that will be

Remind
Remember Necropol lit

Wading through the mirthless alleys
Smell the fear, the cold stale air
Bones and teeth, a garden withered
Broken hands and broken lives

Remember
Remake
