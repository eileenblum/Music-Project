All I ever wanted was a little discipline
A master's touch to give me some serenity within
Now I know there's no one there to save me from myself
All I ever needed was a minute of safe rest
A stronghold to give shelter from the pressure and the test
Now I know there's no one there to save me from myself

Standing cold in victory and longing for some sun
Begging still for mercy when the time for truth has come

Leave here. Turn home

We're all dry and dead and gone and not to breathe again

Leave here. Turn home

Rip the life and laughter out, rebuild it in my name
When the city rises, I will rule and I will blame
Now I know there's no one there to save me but myself
See me, fat and choking on the words that I remade
See my lover bleeding, there is beauty in the strain

Now I know there's no one there to save me from myself
