I am so sorry. I've made amends
I've kept my peace and bent my neck
I know the pattern, I know the sound
and I have twisted it around
The chance to speak passed me by
Remaining frozen in dead time
Honesty stripped of its meaning
I would not hurt you again
You have my heart, you have my hands
Pinning me down when I'm leaving

Moving without sense or sign
Uprooted, and the pain refined
How long can the silence hold?
Where were you when I grew old?

Move me in my lack of faith
Unhand me when it's all too late
How long can your arm hold strong?
Where are you when I am wrong?

I know you well enough

On the treshold of speaking of truces
Then the mouthful of still, hollow fear
There's no name to the path I am choosing
Time is passing, but I am still here 
to see it through

Will I carry this burden forever?
My hands moving with words you won't hear
My heart beating the pulse for the deathbed
It's my kingdom. Here I am it all
So I know it each time you are lying
I can tell from the shame in your eyes
And each time there's a piece of me dying
but you know that I never compromise

Drowned inside you, all embraced
Grown to love the safety it gave
All protection ripped away
Never leave me alone and mute again

How long can the silence hold?
