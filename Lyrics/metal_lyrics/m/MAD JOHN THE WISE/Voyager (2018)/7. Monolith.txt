Black sun, starless night,
A double moon above the mountain.
Cloud rings intertwined,
All spiraling towards the fountain,
That's gushing blood towards the earth.

Indestructible the command
Turning into a profound new element.
Summoned from the sky on the land.
The alliance and the order from the dead.

Arcane fire on high,
The blackest stone becomes the ember.
Temples. Triangles.
To seek the truth is to remember,
How it is to live with no regrets.

Indestructible the command
Turning into a profound new element.
Summoned from the sky on the land.
The alliance and the order from the dead.

"I call upon the seven seas to witness the rite, stone from the sky
And reign, Monolith"
"I call upon the astral plane, the darkness binding beneath the sun
And reign, Monolith"
