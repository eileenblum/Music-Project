It's about time we let go of our thick abode
And start to climb, shine on.
Cast away the pride, before you get to raise your voice
And dig your mind, is it you?

Follow what you fear to conquer all that you've been missing.
Be sincere, wear your own face.
Heavy as the rain a whisper breaking through the silence,
A crimson stain you can't wash away.

We need to take on every road,
We got to find our missing home
Fate, freight train comin'

Every twisted voice hides an unfulfilled desire,
It's your choice what you leave behind.
Seeking higher land, you've got to embrace the fall
And if you stand, you stand aloneâ¦

We need to take on every road,
We got to find our missing home
Fate, freight train comin'
