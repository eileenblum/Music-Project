Hoping to justify all that he knows about,
The weary dancer.
Falling inside the haze beneath the shadow of doubt,
But still he's dreaming on.
Heading forward, carry on!
People that move in a shadow play.
In solitude he found no need for higher ground.

So what's the difference?
The struggle to forget will come around.
His own deliverance he knows is hard to get when glory bound.
This Voyage is coming to an end
Or is the wave beginning?
So what's the difference,
The shore not far ahead will give his life new meaning.

Falling dry and ripe like October leaves
That drank the summer.
Full of winter grey in time he still believes.
The Way of Grace is drawn
On the carvings of blood.
Life is still waiting to heave away.
Hard as the wind will blow, one day he'll rise I know.

So what's the difference?
The struggle to forget will come around.
His own deliverance he knows is hard to get when glory bound.
This Voyage is coming to an end
Or is the wave beginning?
So what's the difference,
The shore not far ahead will give his life new meaning.

This is something that I used to know,
Why are we so weak
And if we are worth something
Just by existing.
