A decision secretly made for the life we chose to lead.
Oh, how insecure we sleep, we dare to bleed.
And I know this may be wrong but I don't want to hear
That's the only chance before we disappearâ¦

When the wind blows you away
And the ground you stand is high
The silence in the eye of the storm

And I feel no relief until the road is homeward bound,
Hoping to find you there somehow, to come back around.
And of all the stories we made the best one's yet to come.
And as the moon is never full under my thumb.

When the wind blows you away
And the ground you stand is high
The silence in the eye of the storm

But after all the guilty stay
I cannot keep my mouth shut.
I must spit what's in my head
"The intuition knows your gut".
To keep it moving, keep on breathing
This is the only chance we got!
To leave this mark inside your brain,
To make it feel like it's your thought.
And if the credits roll, the fire
May it burns a little moreâ¦
So you can really feel the rain,
When you are standing at the door.
'Cause I don't care about the rule book,
I only know what's in my head!
Beware of those who hurt you but
I felt alive each time I bled.
