So move your ass, we're cutting class today to live a story.
Discover what the future holds, to find the guts for glory.
Oh, I'm sick of all who pretend to be
Kings of the desert, locked in a cage
When other people hold the key.
We're only children of the sea.

The dancing lady looked at me and tried to hold my hand.
But then she came closer still, tried to pull the way I stand.
And the man who schooled the vagabond
He started to laugh and gave me the eye,
But sang no evil for my soul.
"Don't take your body as the whole".

'Cause we are not afraid to go astray,
We are the rebels anyway,
Wondering if there is a price to payâ¦

All my heroes underground they don't show their face around.

Move your ass, we are cutting class today
Let's try being a part of a story!
I don't know much, we don't live for the past
Don't belong in the same category.
No more!
