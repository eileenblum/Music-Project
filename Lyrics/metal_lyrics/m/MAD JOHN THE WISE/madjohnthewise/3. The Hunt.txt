Hide!
I'm tracking the pace of fear,
Your shivering hopes I hear,
The prey is gone...
The hunt is now!
Prowling my sacred vow.
My skin feels so colder now,
But as I move on through the path
Breath's short I'm sinking down.

Run!
My senses behold the fear.
The arrows of gold I hear,
And as I am gone,
I turn around...
To find I'm alone somehow.
The quiver is empty now,
But as I move on through the path
Breath's short I'm sinking down.
