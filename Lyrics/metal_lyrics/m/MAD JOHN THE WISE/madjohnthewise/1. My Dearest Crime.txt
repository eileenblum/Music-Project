Beauty kills your voice
And itches to the bone,
Leaves you forgotten and alone.

Alone we'll overcome,
Like a stray dog in pain.
Cleaning wounds in the rain.

Stranger's eyes look deep,
And you feel a little shame,
And you know you deserve all the blame.

Hopes are fading fast,
You got to raise your voice,
Some people must make some noise!

Stand your ground cause the help is on the way.
When we hear your call we will save the day,
Bearing the load, burning the load along the way.

Bring me godspeed wish me luck,
So nothing can hold me down.
Let me in cause I don't wanna hear,
The songs on the fade out.

On our feet we stand.
We care for what we dare.
Into the abyss we stare.

A sin will never last,
But the scar it leaves on you,
Will always leave you bleeding through.

Stand your ground cause the help is on the way.
When we hear your call we will save the day,
Bearing the load, burning the load along the way.

Bring me godspeed wish me luck,
So nothing can hold me down.
Let me in cause I don't wanna hear,
The songs on the fade out.

These moments, I'm giving,
It's just a trick of time.
How hard I try to deceive it
Has become my dearest crime.
