Mind our freedom cause we are not meant to last.
Watching people fall behind you through the glass.
Wanderin' if this will ever feed on you.
What will happen if the boss forgets to pay you?

Why does lying on your bed feels so uptight?
Did you think that you could profit overnight?
Did your cat have a suit in extra large?
Bought a desk so your mouth could be free of charge.

And every bench on the park seems occupied,
A dirty blanket for the coldest winter night,
Looking down just to be indifferent too.
So did you!

We are the cats that rob, steal, murder
All that you dream through the night.
We dance around our little fire
And our smoke is in your sight.

We burn the lust that keeps you going.
Your precious vanity.
The shiny claws the shiny yellow eyes,
Decide our destiny.

We are the kings that don't need a crown,
Cause we all live by the road.
So don't be shy we may have what you want,
Damnation a la mode.

The world is blind, the world is hiding,
Behind a coronet.
Another dream that burns time faster.
A crooked cigarette.

We better realize we are the pawns of the chess.
We try to fuck the queen but all we see is the dress.
The exit sign that's shining bright by the door,
Devotion died before the boat left the shore.

The foreign newsfeed's gaining ground,
Domestic pride gets carried away,
For every loan one step behind.

We are born as one who cares,
Our dreams were never theirs,
Our fight freedom declares!
