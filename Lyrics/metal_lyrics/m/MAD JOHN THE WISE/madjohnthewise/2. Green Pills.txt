Feeling different,
Social obscurity.
Fields of wit burning in my head and
I think I'm out of purity.

All these numbers,
Somehow they stuck within my head.
Is my bad luck due to 13?
What is this knife doing in my hand?

Hate and sorrow.
Ink of my thoughts is bleeding through.
Grasp the sound of a distant calling,
But still I haven't heard from you.

Blood on pillows.
Cold sweat I'm drawing close to the light.
Staring at the wall for hours,
I've got to fall asleep tonight...

Am I crazy?
Can't stop talking to myself,
All the scum surrounding me,
Are figures of a dying day.
Green pills deal dementia!

Suicidal thoughts rise up again,
Ignorance baptizing me insane.
The higher they are the harder they will fall,
but when we go down we rise alone!

I stood there watching them,
They did not seem to care.
There was so much noise you couldn't hear a sound.
And then you know sometimes,
It's hard to read their minds,
but they never try to reach you.
Forgot to understand.
Forgot how stray the rock feels in the sand.
