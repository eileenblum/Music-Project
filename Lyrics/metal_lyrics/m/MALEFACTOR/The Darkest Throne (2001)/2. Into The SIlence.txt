Into The Silence, eyes without a face
Strange creatures looking inside my head
Forgotten World obscured by the sea
The ancient ones, Spirits calling me

Eternal Knowledge, Passing by my head
And old remembrance with beasts, gods and men
Misanthropy of lightning destiny
The Ancient Ones, Spirits calling me

Forever living in this silent dream
Shadows and Majesty...a forgotten age
Supreme power, secret fantasies
The almighty specters, the oath of slavery

Eternal Knowledge, Passing by my head
And old remembrance with beasts, gods and men
Misanthropy of lightning destiny
The Ancient Ones, Spirits calling me

Into The Silence, eyes without a face
Strange creatures looking inside my head
An underwater world, caller of the storms
Under the oath, living into the silence

Arising like a blasphemy
No daylight...unearthly
This is the land of frozen tears
This is the land of immortality
