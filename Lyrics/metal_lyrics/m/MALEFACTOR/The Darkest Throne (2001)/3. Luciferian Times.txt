This world of lies
I spit in the face of hypocrisy
Solitude
The only way 
Misanthropy

No place to hide
Hypocrisy will fall today
Men need to sin
It's natural
It's inside of me

World of Lies
In front of me
We don't need oppression
We don't need your king
Blasphemate
Believe me
Luciferian Times
Now is time to sin

Illusions fall down
No more places to lies
The kingdom of stupidity
Ends today in front of me

No place to hide
Hipocrisy will fall today
Men need to sin
It's natural
It's inside of me
