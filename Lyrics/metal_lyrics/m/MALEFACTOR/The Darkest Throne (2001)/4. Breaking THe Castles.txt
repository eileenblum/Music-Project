Black Moon in the horizon
Seeing another war
Battle of fear against faith
They walk up the altars
100 hands touching the heart of mountain

Crossing the lands, crossing the 7 seas
Wake up the Braves
Wake up the men without fear

I know, we'll break up these tales
Only swords can show the braves
These lies will never be told
'Cause we're breaking the castles of gold

The towers are falling
As darkness falls...
Falling are idols of gold
No masters, No cowards 
100 hands touching the heart of mountain
