Screaming... or walking with silent steps
Steps like spikes of fire
Burning the night
Looking...hearing in curtain spaces
Spaces where they are kings
Speaking to me
...And I can hear!!!
By now they can speak through my tongue
Strange Words
I Know... my tongue isn't my tongue anymore
Looking through my eyes
Commanding my hands
A shelter... is all I need, is all I want
Where are they coming from?
Come from the mountains
Fire and Sea
They have no boundaries
All running free
Come from the mountains
Fire and Sea
They have no boundaries
All running free
Screaming... or walking with silent steps
Steps like spikes of fire
Burning the night
Kiiling...suffering
A Morbid game
A spectral army of death
Tormenting me
Tormenting...revealing another side
A world behind the mirror
A secret place
Spirits or Demons?
Come from the mountains
Fire and Sea
They have no boundaries
All running free
Come from the mountains
Fire and Sea
They have no boundaries
All running free
Come from the mountains
Fire and Sea
They have no boundaries
All running free
Screaming... or walking with silent steps
Steps like spikes of fire
Burning the night

By now they can speak through my tongue
Strange Words
I Know... my tongue isn't my tongue anymore
Looking through my eyes
Commanding my hands
A shelter... is all I need, is all I want
Where are they coming from?
