"Since the time when the Vikings cross the deep seas, the lands weren't the same ...nevermore".

When the light comes down, The warriors goes in silence
In that winter, a lot of them will not come back
The glory and power are distant days
Centuries of combat
Living in the images and shadows of the past
... in Vikings lands
hunger and pain
were the only enemies above the ice
Two leaders decided to come back
To the viking's land... the sea.
Their souls are listening the Njord's call
NJORD... There's a land.... Without  lord, without rules
In this land, I see my people planting the seeds of a new world
I'll do what I have to do.....i have no fear
I WILL GO! Sea is the home that I never had, the only ground, the only place
His mysteries are honours for me
Promisses, only promisses...that's all you have
Lies ! I'll prove you that the kingdom will be mine
Only war justifies, eternally my sons in new world
World that I see in my dreams, and dreams can talk
Talk across the mouth of NJORD
I promise you, these dreams will never be lost
THE NJORD'S CALL
Guiding us through the mist
THE NJORD'S CALL
Under the freezing moon
THE NJORD'S CALL
THE NJORD'S CALL
The sons of the first that pisses the promised land
Will touch the stars
Will fly trough the night
So I jump to the sea as fast as I can
I do the end
I Cut off and throw my hand

"NJORD, you see what I do
Give me all cause I win
Kill my enemy...kill for me"

"Father...I accept to die
A generation will be born
Only the strong survive the war

NJORD
I know how the eagles fly
I make the war ...I dance with the gods
My son you deserve be the king
There's nothing  to hide
See the darkest throne

THE DARKEST THRONE
Glory and power will come again
THE DARKEST THRONE
I'll do what I have to do
THE DARKEST THRONE 

Centuries of combat
Living in the images and shadows of the past
... in Vikings lands
hunger and pain
were the only enemies above the ice
Two leaders decided to come back
To the viking's land... the sea.
"Our souls were listening the Njord's call"
