[Lyrics: Lord Vlad]

So we march
Into the doors of hell
Termopilas under fire
So we march
The beast ever likes the smell of the next hunting
Leonidas, my king we'll trust in our
Spears, Swords, Shields
Bones, Flesh and Blood
Covering our knees
Writing on the sand..in our souls, in our dreams
3 HUNDRED  
300 of Sparta
Marching again
300 of Sparta
No fear, no pain

[CHORUS]
Increasing terror
The Persians are coming
Now is August, the fullmoon is shining for us
Xerxes is smiling
The god-king of Persia
Now is August, he will taste his own blood

Honor, Duty, Glory, Combat, Victory 
All ready to die

The prophet said:
"No one will forget ... will forget these days"
The oracle said:
"No one will fight today"
We just say one thing...
Leonidas, my king we'll trust in our
Spears, Swords, Shields
Bones, Flesh and Blood
Covering our knees
Writing on the sand..in our souls, in our dreams
3 HUNDRED  
300 of Sparta
Marching again
300 of Sparta
No fear, no pain
Respect us

Impaled enemies
Scattering agony
We're going to supper in hell
As a raging sea
Without clemency
Remember us 
Impaling enemies
Scattering agony
We're going to supper in hell
Warriors were moulded by gods

[Repeat CHORUS]

So we die for our land
So we die for our king
So we march...
