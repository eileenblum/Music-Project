[Lyrics: Lord Vlad]

He was banished from the land of men
Made of gold, discovered in the sand
Images from the past...when some men could behold it
Some beliefs, never unified
Blasting faith on the desert's wind
Time will tell the power of the forgotten idols

The Forgotten idols, forbidden and lost
Were them tell us the truth ?

[CHORUS]
From our misery, from our dignity
We need to escape, escape from the "light"
From our destiny, from our evil-seeds
We need to return, to return for the old times

Forgotten are the idols that reveals our truth
Forgotten are the idols that don't see us like slaves

Memory wasted in the wind
Believers of unholy

[Repeat CHORUS]

When the truth was behind
Behind the magic signs
Cat godess prepare to reborn  
No name will be pronounced
No sin will be renounced
Cat godess prepare to reborn  
To live in sin again, reborn the chaos in men
Stabing the veil of time
