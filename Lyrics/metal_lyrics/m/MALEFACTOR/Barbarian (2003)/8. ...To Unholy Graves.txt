[Lyrics: Lord Vlad]

Black Magic, Spell
Enter the hell
Freezing, Reading
Cutting the flesh
Sons of Claunech
Writing with blood

[2x] RETURNING TO UNHOLY GRAVES

A visionary
A future's teller
Speaking with the devil
An iconoclast
Running of the past
Searching the unbeliavable

[2x] RETURNING TO UNHOLY GRAVES

Necromantical
Prediction of all sickness and plague
Violator
Revealing who is wolf, who is lamb

A black passage, nothing is lost
And everything sound as the most important thing
Sinners and Heretic Kings
Wizards of conspiracy
Speaking with the devil
Looking in the eyes of God
Recalling of the oldest past
Epoch to discover the first and the last
Symbols of necromancy
