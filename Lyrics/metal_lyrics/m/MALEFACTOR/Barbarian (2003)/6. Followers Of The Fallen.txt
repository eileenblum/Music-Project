[Lyrics: Lord Vlad]

When moon and sun collide
They pray at the veil of the night
They'll increase their steps
Somebody eyes on their necks

Living in a hiding place
Worshiping the beast of disgrace
Like the wind in the sand
There are blood on their hands

[CHORUS]
Those unlight, betrayers of the sky
In the silence lives the hardest loneliness and the pain
Sons of the night, betrayers of sunrise
In the morning they'll wash their faces in the rain

For a horned king they pray
Tonight the right words they'll say
Followers of the fallen
Guardians of the truth

Decayed souls will hear
No more sins and faults, no more tears
Black words of the past
Advertising the guest

[REPEAT CHORUS]

They will burn the scarlet dawn
