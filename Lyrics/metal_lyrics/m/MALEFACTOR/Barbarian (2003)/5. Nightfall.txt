[Lyrics: Lord Vlad]

Waiting for the night
Waiting for the almighty silence
They live into mystery
Obscured by / the unearthly shade
A promise that will never be:. 
Broken
The enemy is just called "the light"
And they / feel the wine of life
Supreme, their power is stronger than all
Castles will fall
Bewitched, Unblessed, Ungrace
Evil will call then when the 

NIGHT FALL
See the moonspell                          
NIGHTFALL
Bark at the Moon

Iconoclasts achieving the mistery of the wolfman
Behind the mirror they live
Under The Law of the Sword

Changing / A fate that will never return
A corpse without soul
A cry...just a lonely cry
... And your life will be mine when the

NIGHT FALL
See the moonspell                          
NIGHTFALL
Bark at the Moon

Draconian reign will prevail
