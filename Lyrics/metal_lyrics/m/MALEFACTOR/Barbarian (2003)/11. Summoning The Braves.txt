[Lyrics: Lord Vlad]

Marching, Killing
Observing the mist on the field
Bloodstained Hero
Achieving the boundary of pain

Kill them...
The planet on melted lead
Forsaken bodies on the mountain range

Skeletons
Impaled children and rain
Morbid Visions
Promoting the everlasting pain

The monster will be unleashed
Give them hell, take no prisoners

[Bridge]
You will kill
You will fight with a braveheart
The discipline of steel
You will die
You're stabing in the shadows
The discipline of steel

[Pre-Chorus (Canticle)]
Marching on the sand
Sword is on my hand

[CHORUS]
Wash away your soul in the bloodline
You're a brave, No fear inside 
Blessed by fullmoon
Fighting under dark horizons 
Against the coldest winds
Revenge, Summoning the braves
Wash away your soul in the bloodline
You're a brave, No fear inside

Marching, Killing
Observing the mist on the field
Bloodstained Hero
Achieving the boundary of pain

Kill them...
The planet on melted lead
Forsaken bodies on the mountain range

[Repeat Bridge]
[Repeat Chorus]
