[Lyrics: Lord Vlad]

Creation mystery bleeding the night
Forsaken pits covered by the sand
Alowed graves keeping the dust
Heathen souls forever lost

Guardians of black nights
Calling the ancient signs
A point of malignancy
Allowing the future sight

[2X] Blood will need blood

The gargoyle smiles

The posthumous honour of fate
Revealed by the hands of the night
Observing the neuter abysm
Of the afterlife into the void

[2X] The afterlife into the void

The otherside opening the doors
Defiance, Illusion of time
The pit of the conscience at all
Aborting the book of lies

[2X] Aborting the book of lies
