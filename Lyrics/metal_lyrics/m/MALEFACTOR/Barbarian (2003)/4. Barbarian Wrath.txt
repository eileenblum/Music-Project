[Lyrics: Lord Vlad]

Bloodstained...warriors revealing the rage
Burning, Burning
Marching to the unknown / battalions of death
Killing, Killing

Into my blood there is poison, the poison of sin
A seed of death
Taste the blood, when creatures of darkness arise
Again, Again

[Bridge]
Strange ways to carry on
Living inside this war
Burning up the sky, up the heaven
These strange ways to carry on

[Chorus]
Evil Arise
Barbarian Wrath

Awakening, revealing the symbols of hate
Burning, Burning
Searching for the answer in the eyes of the victim
Killing, Killing

Into my soul there is evil, and evil will plant
A seed of death
Taste the fear, when the platoon begin it's march
Again, Again

[Repeat Bridge, Chorus]

Blood
They march after the fall of the dawn
Killing Again
Raping Again
No fear is in their hearts
Ways of the hate
Ways of the insane
Warriors of the Rage

Withstand at the war, feel no pain under the horizon
In the silent morning an endless drum will sound
Returning home, tired bodies with scars on their faces 
In the silent morning an endless drum will sound
