I think my time has come to an end.
Will you wait for me on the other side?
I never want to let you go, my dear.
I'm so sorry, goodbye.

We were bathed in blood that was not our own.
We were bathed in blood.
That was not our own.
Death will never take me from this realm.
He does not possess the keys or occupy a throne.
We will be cloaked in immortality.

You are the god, you are the god of nothing.
O' death, where is thy sting?
You are the god, you are the god of nothing.
O' grave, where is thy victory?

Lucifer was so beautiful,
I wonder what really happened that day.
You corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor,
All to have it stripped away.

We were bathed in blood that was not our own.
We were bathed in blood that was not our own.
We were bathed in blood that was not our own.
We were bathed in blood that was not our own.

You are the god of nothing.
You are the god of nothing.
O' death, where is thy sting?
O' grave, where is thy victory?
