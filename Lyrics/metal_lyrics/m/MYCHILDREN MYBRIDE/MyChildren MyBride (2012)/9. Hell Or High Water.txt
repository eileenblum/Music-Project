Despite impurities, we have to realize there's no need for insecurities
Inflicting the wound just to watch it bleed, instead of realizing you beauty's more that skin deep
Life's tests don't matter when I'm falling after doing my best
No rest and lump in my chest that's beating patterns that resemble hopelessness
Grant us peace of mind, lend us security
With every magazine telling you, how you are supposed to live
No wonder so many people try to end their life with every chance that they get
Just the thought of it makes me sick . . . when will people realize, they should just live their lives exactly how they want it
Taking walks to clear my mind, but I only end up wasting time
Kicking stones and dodging cracks to ease my conscious back on track . . .
"I'm"
Watch them follow, like an ox being led to slaughter
Carbon copies, single file, come Hell or high water
We have the ability to change the future for our sons and daughters
Carbon copies, single file, come Hell or high water
I'm so sick and tired of this world's ways, bringing every single human down
Well I've got news for you
We're rising up, we're swimming against the current
Beneath all of our skin, we all bleed red
Taking walks to clear y mind, but I only end up wasting time
Kicking stones and dodging cracks to ease my conscious back on track . . .
"I'm"
I will not be told how to live my life, I refuse . . . I refuse . . . Did you hear me?
