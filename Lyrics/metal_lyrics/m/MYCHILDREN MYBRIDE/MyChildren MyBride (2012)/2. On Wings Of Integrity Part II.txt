Every day is a constant struggle
Full of self doubt
Were like a wildfire spreading hotter faster stronger you'll never put us out!

When you see the smoke rising in the distance be warned were coming
With one ear to the ground hear its rumbling
We're here to infuse hope in the hopeless
To teach love to those who have never been shown it

We're flying high on wings of integrity
Defusing all forms of modern day misanthropy
We will not be shaken
We are the voice of this generation

Our nation is falling
And we're rising higher every day
Join us, take part in this community
This world has so many questions
We have the answer they need

Blood bought salvation
All they have to do is receive
The crowds will gather
Just to watch us burn
Just to watch us burn

We're flying high on wings of integrity
Defusing all forms of modern day misanthropy
We will not be shaken
We are the voice of this generation

Staying true to all that we believe
With a brand new sense of unity
With our numbers growing larger
Hear our voices stretching farther

You can kill us all
But you can't kill a spark in the minds of a revolution
Together, we can accomplish so much more
Together....We are the cure

We are the cure
To this dying world
