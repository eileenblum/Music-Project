The contrary to courage in our community is not cowardice, it's conformity.
You're just a sheep walking around in wolves clothing.
We do not conform to this world,because we are not of it.
This world will never cage us.
My oath is not set.
The problem isn't being honest with you, it's being honest with myself.
Thank God for friends, friends like you, friends that know me so well.
We do not conform this world, because we are not of it.
Destruction is necessary for self recovery.
Tear down the walls and make self- discoveries .
Remove every selfless ambition.
From your minds and from your souls.
The problem isn't being honest with you, it's being honest with myself.
Thank God for friends, friends like you, friends that know me so well.
Friends are the families we chose for our self.
