Close your eyes
And in this darkness now we're fine
Nothing matters now
Everything will be alright

I'm sure this storm is almost over
Soon we'll be dancing through fields of clover
We're completely free in our sanctuary
It's like being dehydrated out at sea
Completely surrounded by the exact thing you need

Close your eyes
And in this darkness now we're fine
Nothing matters now
Everything will be alright

They say if dreams
Can come true
Then I'm sure
Nightmares can too
The horns on my left keep whispering
And the wings on my right keep hanging their head
Hoping that I'll stop listening
But I've learned from mistakes instead

I hope I never wake up
I hope I never wake up

There's something in the words you say
(Words you say, words you say)
And how they float there lingering
(Lingering, lingering)

They say if dreams
Can come true
Then I'm sure
Nightmares can too
The horns on my left keep whispering
And the wings on my right keep hanging their head
Hoping that I'll stop listening
But I've learned from mistakes instead

If hope should fail us now
Then faith will see us through
Well I was living a nightmare
And then... then there was you

I am an anchor
You are the raging sea
I'll just keep sinking further
While you try to carry me

I am an anchor
You are the raging sea
I'll just keep sinking further
While you try to carry me

If hope should fail us now
Then faith will see us through
Well I was living a nightmare
And then... then there was you
