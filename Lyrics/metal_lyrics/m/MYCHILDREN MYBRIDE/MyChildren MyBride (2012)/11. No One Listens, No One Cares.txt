It's another day of life on the road, you think this is a vacation?!
Well hen you've got it all wrong
We'll keep carrying on, playing shows to make ends meet
We keep writing music, trying to make it in this dying industry
You're the only reason worth staying away from home
If it wasn't for people like you, we wouldn't even play at all
You're the only reason worth staying away from home
But what do I say, if every word's been said?
Why do I even waste my breath?
No one listens, no one cares
Maybe I'll just join the rest and the rest and scream about how life isn't fair
Why even waste my breath?
No one listens, no one cares
No one's listening, no one even cares
30 days, 30 shows, 5 showers, and dirty clothes
I'm not complaining, this is just the life that we chose
Welvome to our lives
Another date, another city
I've missed too many holidays, and hurt my family enough times to waste away on tour, and spend it risking our lives
So many relationships destroyed over never being around
Yet I keep getting in this van living the only reason worth staying away from home
But, what do I say, if every word's already been said
Why even waste my breath when no one listens, no one cares
No one listens, no one cares
