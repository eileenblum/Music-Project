A summer night in Boise, Idaho, I wasn't ready for the call that I recieved.
Little did I think or know, the heavy news that it would carry me,
Rage meets anger, white knuckles and tears, I'm helpless, 2500 miles away.
Sitting underneath a street light, wondering if another angel got his wings.
Black birds swept down, they surrounded me.
Carefully they wrapped their dark wings all around me.
This song is for those dead and gone.
Its just another day, another funeral.
God knows that they're never coming.
Its just another day, another funeral.
An Austin, Texas morning, I wish I never woke up that sunny day.
Just find out about the lie, that was 24 long years in the making.
he was in and out of my life, just like a slow-passing train.
I never got to say goodbye to the mother I barely knew was mine. 
Black birds swept down, they surrounded me.
Carefully they wrapped their dark wings all around me. 
This song is for all of those dead and gone.
And God knows that they're never coming home.
Another piece of me gone, I might as well just join you all.
No...too many people need me here.
How many more friends will die this year?
Nothing can prepare you for the loss of someone you love.
And when the thought of them gone, it numbs like a drug.
Take sanctuary in the arms of those you love.
No matter how bad you've gone it, someone's got it worst.
