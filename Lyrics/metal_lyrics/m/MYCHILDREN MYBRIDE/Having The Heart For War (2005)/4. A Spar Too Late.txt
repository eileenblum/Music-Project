Murder murder!
Did you read the headlines
There was a death
Just over there, on the top of that hillside
A new beginning, in three days time

Whats worth living for
But whats worth dying for
Just run away and end it all

I know a better way than all of this

End it all or stand and fight
You are my motivation,
You are my inspiration
Thank you for all your spite
You're the reason I still fight

I still fight
