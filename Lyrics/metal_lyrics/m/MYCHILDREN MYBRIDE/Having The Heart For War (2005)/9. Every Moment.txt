Keep on fighting
We're with you if you fall

Make every moment count

This life is far too precious
To waste away
There's too much good in this world give it up

Keep on fighting
Perception is deception
Close your eyes
Know yourself
Speak with truth regardless of the outcome
Make everyone moment count

Every day, every second, every breath
Make every moment count
