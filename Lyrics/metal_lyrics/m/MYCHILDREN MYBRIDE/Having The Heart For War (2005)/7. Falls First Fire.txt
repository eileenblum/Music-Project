Flames dancing down matches,
Oh such syncracy
Watch sulfur, and skin collide
A scar and a sign

New flesh, new birth
Scalpel knife to chest
Remove heart, and hold
Life in hand, set fire to
What you see

Deliver what's inside to the city above
And spill your blood on those reborn
Deliver what's inside

Let's burn the city down
Burn it to the ground there's rejoicing above
And in celebration we'll dance
Upon the ashes of those reborn

The autumn of life short lived,
The fields are white
