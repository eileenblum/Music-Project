I need a witness, today I become a man
Tonight I will end this
Enduring, inhaling, waiting on this tide to come in
These waves keep tormenting, crashing down on everything I have left
Barely able to withstand the pressure of lifeâs cascading tests
With passion I pursue
Eager to conquer I still push on
With passion I pursue
Well Iâm an open book, still pushing on
Iâm just waiting on that splash of fresh air
Something to ease lifeâs heavy load
That relinquishing last breath
Just to know that I made it past another day
Just to know that I made it there unscathed

An empty barren carcass, armed with a mind
With ambition for victory, I confide
To encourage, invoking all thatâs inside
[repeat]

I prevail over every wicked bitter thing you've said
We, we prevail, mere champions among men

Finally I can breathe again
My lungs no longer filled with disbelief
This lighthouse still guiding me home
I can breathe again

WE WITHSTOOD, WE DEFEATED, WE HELD OUR GROUND

No longer choking on failure's thick heavy scent,
WE MOVE ON
Tired but still prepared, eyes ahead, no turning back
I prevail over every wicked bitter thing you've said
We, we prevail, mere champions among men
