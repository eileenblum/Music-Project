Bitter thoughts test morals and encourage bitter action, pride comes before fall
Think before you speak if you even speak at all, SPEAK AT ALL

I'll relinquish your heavy hearts of pain and sorry, healing sutures
An unguarded queen pursues, oblivious of her future

I don't, I don't expect anything, we are all hopeless, but I stay confident
With willingness to take control, we'll make our time well spent

Let it sink in,
Every word that I said
LET IT SINK IN,
Let in sink in, 
Every word that you heard me say
Conquering anything and everything THROWN AT US
We will not be torn, our hearts will stand, they will stand as one [x2]

WE SILL SOAR! [x3]

My victory in sight, a steady heart will not collide with misfortune, oh the integrity [x2]
