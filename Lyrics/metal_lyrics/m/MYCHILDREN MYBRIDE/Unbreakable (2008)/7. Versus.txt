The blind leading the blind
Unfortunate misfortunes of my life
Tests and trials, Iâm in denial
Ending up face down in my own hands
The blind leading the blind
Finally having the strength to open up my eyes
Placing bets, my hearts turn to shine
Ending up face down in my own hands
Day after day I wait, thereâs nothing left but apathy
Time to kill, and you're not worth my time
Theyâve got me facing back to back
Iâm failing but still picking up your slack
But still these pieces will not fit
A nervous wreck, and the worst gets worse
Time to kill, and you're still not worth a second of my time
Why are you fighting for your life when you're already dead?

Day after day I wait, thereâs nothing left but apathy
Time to kill, and you're not worth my time
Excuse after excuse
They've got me facing back to back
Iâm failing but still picking up your slack
But still these pieces will not fit
Iâm a nervous wreck, and still the worst gets worse
