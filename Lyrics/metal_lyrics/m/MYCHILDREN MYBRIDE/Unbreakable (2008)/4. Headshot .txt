[feat. guest vocals by Chad Ruhlig of For The Fallen Dreams]

I am the last of a dying breed
The Spartans; built to fight and born to lead
We will destroy the covenant and make them bleed
Cortana lead me through your eyes I will see

Heading off to the halo rings
Finding out that earth is the final key
Destroying the flood for all eternity
Killing brutes, jackals, grunts, and covenant elites

I am the master chief
No one can mess with me
Saving the world from catastrophe
Unleashin' BXR's and killing sprees

Letâs start a match, Team Slayer on Lockout
Battle rifles blazin', you're gonna get knocked out
Turn the corner, and im'a stick you right in da' grill
Gettinâ no scoped beat down, Iâm one in a mill'

HEADSHOT!

Unstoppable

Team skirmish CTF on Zanzibar,
Capturing flags, gettinâ my battle scars
Time to defend, Iâm bustinâ heads with my shotgun
Second round secured, another battle won

I am the MASTER CHIEF
No one can MESS WITH ME
Saving the world from CATASTROPHE
Unstoppables and KILLING SPREES

[This song is about the video game Halo which the band likes to play a lot when on tour.]
