If seeing is believing then they've gouged out all their own eyes.
They're confused by the love, the hate, all of the hypocritical lies.
Their own misfortunes, creating the selfish disguise;
That will seed the beginning of their spiritual demise
[x2]

I canât believe this is happening,
My faith depleting somewhere buried inside, alive;
Afraid, unstable, but learning that these things will clear in time
Iâm so scared, Iâm so scared of what I might become

Straying from the beaten path that Iâve been on for so long
Finally moving forward in life, acknowledging my faults
Thatâs haunted my every move for what seems like years
My conscience screaming, realizing things arenât as bad as they appear

Still anchored in our old ways

And just when you think everything's going to be alright
Defenses down, so vulnerable to what once had you gripped so tight

The miracle I needed, no longer mistreated
The life changing motivation, my only inspiration
Calm the storms and ill walk the waves
My eyes are open, and I can clearly see

CALM THE STORMS AND IâLL WALK THE WAVES

I canât believe all this is happening to me,
My faith depleting some where buried alive, inside;
Afraid, unstable, but learning that these things will clear in time
Iâm so scared, Iâm so scared of what I might become
And just when you think everything âs going to be alright
Iâm vulnerable to what once had me gripped so tight
