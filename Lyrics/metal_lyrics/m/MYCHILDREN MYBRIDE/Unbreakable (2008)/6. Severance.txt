I fell asleep a boy, and when I woke I was a man
Forced to mature by this cold world that surrounds us
What once was so innocent before is now lost
Let down by the elders that we use to trust

We were all meant for so much more than this
No more turning back, no more giving in
Although time has locked us in regret
We wonât back down, this canât be over yet
[repeat]

I fell asleep a boy and when I woke I was a man
Forced to mature by this cold world that surrounds us
What once was so innocent before is now lost
Let down by the elders we use to trust

We'll water our pillows with candid memories
Praying for things to be the way they used to be
Somehow always blaming ourselves again and again
Hoping that we will finally see the end
All the broken promises and fallen dreams
Courtesy of our creators
False hope busting out of their seams
Theyâre becoming such outstanding traitors

No more turning back, no more giving in
We were all meant for so much more than this
[repeat]

A child so small, locking up everything inside
Scared and alone, the only thing to do is hide
Accepting the decisions that were way over our heads
Hearing the yelling from our tear-covered beds
Now with a void that's only half-filled
Cradling the memories that havenât yet been killed
Although time has us locked in regret
We wonât back down, this canât be over yet
We have coped with the pain that is inevitable
Recovered from the deep wound that made us so unstable

We'll live ready for tomorrow like it was yesterday
Caught up in the past when we need to focus on today
[repeat]

We'll flood our pillows with candid memories
Praying for things to be the way they used to be
Somehow always blaming ourselves again and again
We'll flood our pillows with candid memories
Praying for things to be the way they use to be
Hoping that we'll finally see the end

No more turning back, no more giving in
We were all meant for something so much more than this
