Listen to me, I'm talking to you.
Be your own friend,
be your own friend, and fight, fight, fight for yourself.
No one has your back, you're helpless
who is willing to stand up for what they believe in?
Nobody
They fold and crumble under fear, and anything else that challenges them.

Rise, and change my friend.

This isn't what it seems,
reality already passed me by.
I'm living in nothing but dreams,
and failing at reaching the sky.

I know you're over there just waiting for me to make the move.
Stand up, stand your solid ground, you're not alone.
I know you're over there just waiting for me to make the move.

Fight hard for all you have,
believe me its worth the effort.
Whats weighing you down?
Do anything. Get it out.
Whats weighing you down?
Do anything. Get it out.

Open up this heart I'm living for, inside of this life I'm fighting for.
Guard your heart and everything close to it.
Rise up and change my friend.
Fix the henderence, bear witness to your doom.
I know you're standing over there, waiting for me to make the move.

I want you out of my life.
