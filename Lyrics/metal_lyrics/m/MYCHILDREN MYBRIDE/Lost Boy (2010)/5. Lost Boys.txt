Iâm screaming so loud, my throat is bursting. 
But like a falling tree in the woods, 
if no oneâs listening am I making noise. 
Although Iâm still snared by the words of my own breath, 
I realize a body cannot suffer in sweet repose. 
Take heart, this will be over soon.

This is everything that you donât want to hear. 
Never again, never again, will my voice fall on deaf ears.
This is everything that you donât want to hear. 
Never again, never again, will my voice fall on deaf ears.

Traded my life for one on the road, gave up it all, but kept my soul.
Hardly a man, no longer a child, Iâm just another L.O.S.T. B.O.Y.
Loud, obnoxious, pissed off, kid with something to prove, Iâve got nothing to lose.
Iâm ready to die, ready to die, cause Iâm a L.O.S.T. B.O.Y.
Dressed in black, with a target painted on my back, 
Iâve learned to adapt to this pedestal youâve placed me on. 
Iâm ready to die, Iâm ready to die, we are all lost boys. L.O.S.T. B.O.Y.

We all want what we canât have, so itâs time we take it all back.
This worldâs the iron, weâre the rust, whatâs this world going to do with us.
We are the hammer, we must strike while the iron is hot.
Itâs time we lead and not follow. 
Quit acting like the space inside your chest is hollow.

Search for me, deep in the cities, singing a rebel yell of pity.
Thereâs more than blood pumping through these veins. No pain, no gain.
Youâll find me deep in the cities, singing a rebel yell of pity.
Thereâs more than blood pumping through these veins. No pain, no gain. 
NO PAIN, NO GAIN. No pain, no gain.

Like a falling tree in the woods, if no oneâs listening am I making noise.
