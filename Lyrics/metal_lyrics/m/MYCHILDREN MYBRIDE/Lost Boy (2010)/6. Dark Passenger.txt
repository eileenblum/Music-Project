Life's short, so take every precious second for what it's worth.
You never know when death and company will come beating down your door.
Only time will tell if this long hard life we live is worth living.
Like the harsh winds and crashing waves, nature is so unforgiving.
Like the harsh winds and crashing waves, we'll keep beating the shores of yesterday.

We'll all decay, we'll all fade away. It's fate. 
We can't escape this life-long tragedy.
We'll all decay, we'll surely fade away. 
Living from day to day, they say "No guts, no glory".

We can't fear death. 
A live lived in fear isn't a life lived at all.
We can't fear death. 
A live lived in fear isn't a life lived at all.

A bird of ill omen, cloaked in the fiction we subsist.
Inhaling, absorbing all signs of life that still exist.
I wonder what it feels like to have your whole life flash before you.
To relive every moment, every smile, every heartache you've been through.
Like the harsh winds and crashing waves, we'll keep beating the shores of yesterday.

We'll all decay, we'll all fade away. It's fate. 
We can't escape this life-long tragedy.
We'll all decay, we'll surely fade away. 
Living from day to day, they say "No guts, no glory".
We'll all decay, we'll all fade away (fade away). 
We can't escape this life-long tragedy.
We'll all decay, we'll surely fade away. 
Living from day to day, they say "No guts, no glory".

You're walking in deception, it's time to meet your Maker.
