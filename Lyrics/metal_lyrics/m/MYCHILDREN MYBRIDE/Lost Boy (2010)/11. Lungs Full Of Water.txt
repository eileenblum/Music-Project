"If every star fell out of the sky tonight, 
every wish I'd make would take me closer to you." 
Well I'm starring at an empty sky on a lonely night, 
and from the looks of it every star is gone, and so are you. 
"If every star fell out of the sky tonight, 
every wish I'd make would take me closer to you." 
Well I'm starring at an empty sky on a lonely night, 
and from the looks of it every star is gone, and so are you.

Open up my chest and you will find, 
dust and moths, floating through an empty hall. 
Slowly scavenging through the debris scattered inside, 
only to realize, there's no heart left at all.

I never thought that my lips would speak, 
or even that my mind would think of the day 
I couldn't lay my head down at night, 
and not see you staring back at me. 
But even after the storm has come and gone, 
life will surely, sadly move on. 
It just hurts knowing that I'll have to be the one to say, 
you're exactly what I hope I'll never be... 
you're exactly what I hope I'll never be.

We all know it's times like these that truly test the soul, 
to go from standing tall, to crawling so very low. 
It's like being trapped underwater with no air to breathe, 
starring up at this blurry world, starring right back down on me. 
We all know it's times like these that truly test the soul, 
to go from standing tall, to crawling so very low. 
It's like being trapped underwater with no air to breathe, 
starring up at this blurry world, starring right back down on me.

I never thought that my lips would speak, 
or even that my mind would think of the day 
I couldn't lay my head down at night, 
and not see you staring back at me. 
But even after the storm has come and gone, 
life will surely, sadly move on. 
It just hurts knowing that I'll have to be the one to say, 
you're exactly what I hope I'll never be.
