In death we will ascend, and only in death will we interview
That which formed us from this cold dark lifeless earth,
For it is in this journey that we evolve into our true state
We were created in love, and now we're born into hate
we are eternal ...
and although our bodies stored six feet deep in their decomposing displays
will never witness the light of day I arise the dirt and up past my grave
we are eternal ...
and although our bodies stored six feet deep in their decomposing displays
will never witness the light of day I arise the dirt and up past my grave
incontrovertible rest, our darkened eyes will never open
and our vision will never be shaded again by the relentless hands of time
our mortal flesh is nothing but a mantle of corruption
unveil and deliver into the hands of our creator
to justify our recquital to justify our atonement
we were birthed from the ground and to the ground we shall return we are a
breed of dirt
we are eternal ...
and although our bodies stored six feet deep in their decomposing displays
will never witness the light of day I arise through the dirt and up past my
grave
this is the end, this is our final ascent
great architect of time
thunder rolling nature preparing for the mighty atmospheric retreat cure me
with your wisdom consume my heart enlight my mind behold the great harbinger
we are eternal ...
and although our bodies stored six feet deep in their decomposing displays
will never witness the light of day I arise through the dirt and up past my
grave
we're all born into hate
