And when it seems like the feeling of being alone 
is the only feeling you'll ever know, cry out... and just let go. 
Everybody lift your broken voices, let me hear you sing: 
"Like the winter trees reach for the heavens, I reach for you".

My generation may be growing older, but by the second we're growing bolder, 
and yet adolescent hearts are still growing colder. 
Quit waiting for the world to change, and start changing the world. 
We aren't the disease, we're the cure.

We were designed for so much more than this life we're living. 
It starts with forgiving, and realizing you're not alone. 
We were designed for so much more than this life we're living. 
The hearts we're killing, our souls, our souls dethroned.

And when it seems like the feeling of being alone

Everybody lift your broken voices, let me hear you sing: 
"Like the winter trees reach for the heavens, I reach for you".

It's safe to say that the cause of this is our selfish ways.
You talk the talk, but can't seem to spit it.
It's safe to say that the cause of this is our selfish ways.
You walk the walk, but can't seem to live it.

You talk the talk, but can't seem to spit it. 
You walk the walk, but can't seem to live it.
You talk the talk, but can't seem to spit it. 
You walk the walk, but can't seem to live it.

Cry out and just let go! Cry out and just let go!
