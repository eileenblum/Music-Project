[Guest vocals by Garrett Bymers from Riders of the Apocalypse]Look me in the hollow eyes and hear me say: 
"When you think your only release is a lonely exit, 
I'll be there to tell you that there's another way..."

As my perception of this world around me narrows, 
I receive my surroundings and intake their whispers. 
My life is my burden, and I tackle it with passion, 
and with it I'll build my throne.

I'm a professional of self-destruction, all the pain with no explosions.
Salt the wound to silence your soul. Another empty vessel living alone.

Time has changed us, aged us, we never thought that we'd end up here.
We want the answers to life's questions, before life resets, take it or leave it.

As my perception of this world around me narrows, 
I receive my surroundings and intake their whispers. 
My life is my burden, and I tackle it with passion, 
and with it I'll build my throne.

I'm a professional of self-destruction, all the pain with no explosions.
Salt the wound to silence your soul. How much longer, how much longer must we go.

Time has changed us, aged us, we never thought that we'd end up here.
We want the answers to life's questions, before life resets, take it or leave it.

And I believe in ghost, but it's something else that's haunting me.
A witness, life's lonely host, but it's something else that's haunting me.

And even though we feel dead inside, we can still say "At least we tried". [x4]

I'm a professional of self-destruction, all the pain with no explosions.
Salt the wound to silence your soul. How much longer, how much longer must we go.

Time has changed us, it changed us, we never thought that we'd end up here.
We want the answers to life's questions, before life resets, take it or leave it.
Time has changed us, it changed us, we never thought that we'd end up here.
We want the answers to life's questions, before life resets, take it or leave it.
