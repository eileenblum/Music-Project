We made it through september
With lust and dying embers
Tell me is that all we were
Now look at what we've done
Look at what we've become
What three words will do

...and you said
I won't be there when you fall
I won't be there when you break down

Dark haired girl
Where did you go?
You live in a broken world
...and we stand alone
But darling who knew
That when we were created
We'd be suffocated
By such despair and loneliness
Still, we stand as a witness
And die by the sickness
That this thing called love induces

Dark haired girl
Where did you go?
In this broken world
You left me alone
