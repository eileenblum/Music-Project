I am lust and seduction
The money worshiper
Girl with diamonds riviÃ¨re
Art and ornamentation

Grit of a classical music master
You force admiration
Dedicate your life to libertine pleasures
High orchestra conductor
Fickle syphilis

I adore luxery
Millionnaire passion
But never will I possess a mortal love
I venerate sex
Millionnaire passion

Funeral march high composer
The macabre requiem of the nation
Carnal vices, multiple sins of the flesh
Inspired by the maze of "PÃ¨re Lachaise"

Beatitude's refinement
Anti-puritanical satanist
I am lucifer in MoliÃ¨re's costume
Lucifer by a moonlight veil

I adore luxery
Millionnaire passion
Baudelaire's poetry
And his millenary spleen
I strut on the bank of "La Seine"
Notre Dame is showing
But never will I possess a mortal love

Attraction of luxery
Millionnaire passion
Love the frivolous woman
Escaped by her feminity
Obsessional seduction
Sacrifice to the flower of evil
I am lucifer in MoliÃ¨re's costume

Lucifer by a moonlight veil

The enrichment dream is nothingness passion
To make of all women a gold-dust princess

Attraction of luxery
Millionnaire passion
Love the frivolous woman
Escaped by her feminity
Obsessional seduction
Sacrifice to the flower of evil
I am lucifer in MoliÃ¨re's costume

I adore luxery
Millionnaire passion
Baudelaire's poetry
And his millenary spleen
I strut on the bank of "La Seine"
Notre Dame is showing
But never will I possess a mortal love

Money selects by its boundless power
To which pleasure you might practise
Everything is allowed, nothing will disturb your quest
Your archievement to immortality

Lyrics by S.A.S. de L'ArgiliÃ¨re
