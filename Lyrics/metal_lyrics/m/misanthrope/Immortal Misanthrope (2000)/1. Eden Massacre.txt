Resigned knight to solitude
A gloomy forest lures
Your soul into a trap
The hand on the axe
No one can move back

This mansion is calling you
In an ascending anger
Behind those closed walls
Something is alive outside

Something is alive outside

I am the prisoner
Of a cunning invincible beast
Running to nowhere
In a silent hazy mist

My sights have adjusted
To the visions of mutilated bodies
Run away from this feast
Which will end in fury

Slaughter on the earth of joy
Butchery in the garden of Eden
In a world gone down to madness
Eden Massacre

I am lost in the labyrinth
Sublime capital of Hell
Downtown Pandemonium
Eden Massacre

Terrorized I enjoy my pain
Martyrized to kill

Lost in the labyrinth of darkness
Entrails of Dante's Inferno
Enter the somptuous interior of
Pandemonium's blazing fire

My sights have adjusted
To the visions of mutilated bodies
Run away from this feast
Which will end in fury

Slaughter on the earth of joy
Butchery in the garden of Eden
In a world gone down to madness
Eden Massacre

I am lost in the labyrinth
Sublime capital of Hell
Downtown Pandemonium
Eden Massacre

Slaughter on the earth of joy
Butchery in the garden of Eden
In a world gone down to madness
Eden Massacre

I am the prisoner
Of a cunning invincible beast
Running to nowhere
In a silent hazy mist

In the delicate art of massacra
Entrails of DanteÂ´s Inferno
Terrorized I enjoy my pain
Branded with embers

Slaughter on the earth of joy
Butchery in the garden of Eden
In a world gone down to madness
Eden Massacre

I am lost in the labyrinth
Sublime capital of Hell
Downtown Pandemonium
Eden Massacre
