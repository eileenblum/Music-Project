The soul thrower
Spirit of sadness
Forever damned

Divine passage to Hell
Sacred ossuary of eternity
A morbid retirement far away from the mortals
The soul thrower
Hazy soul sailing in the immensity

I found the secret gate, the nutritive-mother
The generator heart of humanity

The strange black-hole, our attraction to evil
Residence of...obscurity
Where the human souls slide
Body against body for immortality

Soul thrower to infinity
Trailing in your infernal parade
Your life-end ghosts

The soul thrower

Divine passage to Hell
Sacred ossuary of eternity
A morbid retirement far away from the mortals
The soul thrower
Spirit of sadness
Forever damned

Mighty bridge from Heaven to Hell
Destructive power of sterility
In a cast of flames...throw the souls

I found the secret gate, the nutritive-mother
The generator heart of humanity

The strange black-hole, our attraction to evil
Residence of...obscurity
Where the human souls slide
Body against body for immortality

Soul thrower to infinity
Trailing in your infernal parade
Your life-end ghosts

To the sagittarius sparkling
Throw those dead souls
Where reverberate the stars
From beyond to the darkness

The soul thrower

Mighty bridge from Heaven to Hell
Destructive power of sterility
Throw the souls
