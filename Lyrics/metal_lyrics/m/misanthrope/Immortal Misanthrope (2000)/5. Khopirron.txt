To the twilight of time, in his infernal pillar
The scarabaeus, spreads life by evil

Khopirron emblem of resurrection
Etruscan print delivers your judgement

Disunited to four points by the wind's force
Misguided to four corners of the wide continent

The corset carapace of alloying pyramids
Install the chameleon cosmonaut in the matrix

Like a god of salvation, accompany back the stars
Receive them in the arch of life

Khopirron emblem of resurrection
Etruscan print delivers your judgement

Peaceful harbour of ideal

Khopirron emblem of resurrection
Etruscan print delivers your judgement

Blue scarab symbol of immortality
Set me free

So let this frame to the ancient knowledge
Black Karabos inebriate wisdom

I need some energy, transplant me
And in seven seconds, a new nebula rose

From a primary plasma where divinity settled
A savior is born celestial moment of grace

I need some energy, transplant me
And in seven seconds, a new nebula rose

To the twilight of time, in his infernal pillar
The scarabaeus, spread life by evil

Khopirron emblem of resurrection
Etruscan print delivers your judgement

Disunited to four points by the wind's force
Misguided to four corners of the wide continent

The corset carapace of alloying pyramids
Install the chameleon cosmonaut in the matrix

Like a god of salvation, Accompany back the stars
Receive them in the arch of life

Khopirron emblem of resurrection
Etruscan print delivers your judgement

Peaceful harbour of ideal

Khopirron emblem of resurrection
Etruscan print delivers your judgement
Khopirron
Khopirron
Khopirron
