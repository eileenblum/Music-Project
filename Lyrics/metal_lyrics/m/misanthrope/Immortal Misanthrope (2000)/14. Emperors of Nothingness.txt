The earth is cracking into pieces
Re-echo the terrible chaos
Dragging the planet and its mortal cradle
In an exponential drift away

As a modern Phoenix
Extract from the center of earth
Where S.A.S being of flesh
Surmount the last crater

Prodigal descent
Re-united all over again
The high names of our history
Master of occult immortality

Immortal Misanthrope
Universal messiah
Re-united on earth
The emperors of nothingness

Alceste of hate
New necromancer
Take possession of Hades
Hypnotize those wooden hands

The emperors of nothingness
The emperors of nothingness

I need vitality, give me more energy
Artificial trepanning, vitae sensory
Control the elementary parameters

My ultimate intent is to re-unite on the holy land
The indispensable beings of our centenarian history
Come back forever giants, philosopher messiah

Seated on the Father's right
Might of the universe, rebel equal to god
Born dead deicide
By a dark process of black magic art
Seated on the Father's right
Might of the universe, rebel equal to god
Immortal Misanthrope glittering to the Heaven firmament

Master the power
Of the resurrection
Yelling above the sky up to break the theories of time

I investigate the unconquered worlds
To discover the answer to my enigma
Immortal Misanthrope
The last hope of the galaxy

Seated on the Father's right
Might of the universe, rebel equal to god
Born dead deicide
By a dark process of black magic art
Power of the universe
Master of occult immortality
By a dark process of complex black magic art

Immortal Misanthrope

I need vitality, give me more energy
Artificial trepanning, vitae sensory
Control the elementary parameters

Master the power
Of the resurrection
Yelling above the sky up to break the theories of time

Immortal Misanthrope
Born dead deicide
Emperors of nothingness
