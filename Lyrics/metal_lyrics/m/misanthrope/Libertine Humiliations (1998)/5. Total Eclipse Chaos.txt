Total eclipse chaos
We are the infants of the disinheritance
The futile future invisible people
Invincible with a trans-lucid heart
Inviolable total eclipse chaos

The translucent nomads
Sparkle to nothingness
Trample of their naked feet
The burning desert grain of sand

The translucent nomads
Forever resister
Against the multitude, ashen and devotee,
Crystallized, incandescent,
The invincible, retaliate upon my alike,
Statuettes of opal...

The last man to thank banished scapegoat
Homeless' traveller
The orphaned... requited to joy

Cervus statuette of will and egoism
Which human' scorpion nature
Has completely deformed
...Reduced to nothingness

Total eclipse chaos
The translucent nomads
Invincible with trans-lucid heart
Inviolable, total eclipse
