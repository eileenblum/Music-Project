When the night isn't just boredom
But a faint sickness to live
Itinerant
Schizophrenic
Phobia engulf my body
Seperate me from the being

At 666 days of the end of the century
Announce the chronicle of an empire
Kaleidoscopic cataclism diary
Year 0, hypocondrium monarchy
Rebellion misanthropy 2060

Once again destiny dictates its own choice
Towards the neverending astronomical wheel

Misanthrope from generation to generation
In love with the infidel CÃ©limene
Unchain in this wideworld of unreason
Longing to envy the dead

At 666 days of the end of the century
Announce the chronicle of an empire
Year 0, hypocondrium diary
Rebellion misanthropy 2060

Rebellion
Rebellion monarchy 2060
Rebellion misanthropy 2060

After an entire life of futility
I'm plunging into the wosdom waves
Of my frozen ocean of lunacy
To change the winter game

Worthy descendant of MoliÃ¨re: Alceste of hate
Rebel against the revolution failure and sadness
With human fall as felicity
Longing to envy the dead
