We are the knowledge visionnaire
The world becoming last rampart
Created by the other
The impure slave to our virtual world

We are the knowledge visionnaire
The world becoming last rampart
Created by the other
The impure slave to our virtual world
...And his cynic engine of war
Cybernetic technology
We cannot re-start a new life
We only can follow it
Park of muzzled mans
Cybernetic technology
Park of muzzled mans
Cybernetic...
Technology

The being dead is already on the way
Machine will supplant our thought
This very tomorrow
In orgy of visions
Leisures we should delight
Obliterate the human
Identify card auto digitalized
Scanner interactive
Option codified
Machines will suffice
To the leaders' entertainment
All answers forbidden

Behind their ghetto
Catch sight the survival
Of an extinguish race
Living is loving "becoming"
But becoming is not serving
The real power is to lead being's credulity
Always been able to break us
At their first opportunity

To the sound of the future flute
Rats and model childrens will follow your wrestling
Going down in an incredible swamp descend
As lobotomized forever mire
In the yawing chasm vortex

Their cristal liquid eyes
Wandered over the crowd
A zoo dweller

We cannot re-start a new life
We only can follow it
Park of muzzled mans
Living is loving "becoming"
But becoming is not serving

We are the knowledge visionnaire
The world becoming last rampart
Created by the other
The impure slave to our virtual world

We are the knowledge visionnaire
The world becoming last rampart
Created by the other
The impure slave to our virtual world

June 1997
