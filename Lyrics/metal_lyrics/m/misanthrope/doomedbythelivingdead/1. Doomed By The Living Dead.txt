I'm back again,
Back in the evil night,
And you're waiting,
Doomed by the living dead.

Flames are rising,
Can't you see you're dying.

The wolves are howling,
A baby's cry in the distance.
Cold winds blowing,
In the dead of night.

Flames are rising,
Can't you see you're dying.

No way to survive this evil night,
If the dead won't leave you alone.
So just say goodbye to all your holy angels,
You're gonna die.

Long black hair,
Face like a dead.
I am here,
Satan in my head.

You can see nothing,
But confusing mirrors.
Now you feel it,
It's getting nearer.

Flames are rising,
can't you see you're dying.

So dark in your mind,
Breath of Satan in my back.
I can't help you,
Cause i'm one of the Dead.

Flames are rising,
Can't you see you're dying.

No way to survive this evil night,
If the dead won't leave you alone.
So just say goodbye to all your holy angels.
