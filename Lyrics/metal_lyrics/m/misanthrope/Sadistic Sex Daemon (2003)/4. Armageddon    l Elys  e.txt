I could not believe in your systemIn your ridiculous electionLitentious chimeraPromises of everything reality of nothingMan will always beToo feline for the othersInhabited by shame and mediocrity Where is the old man's wisdomThe upright words of our ancestorsOur knighthood's braverymodern world I hate youDestroy all democratic suspicionInfestations of those liesWhere a minority actsEstablished on treachery and weakness Unholy democracyPernicious sect you enrolOur children since primary schoolFlowers who could not blossom outI preach the great tyranny France is in flamesBurn, damned republicanI refuse your citizenshipArmageddon at the ÃlysÃ©e DenunciationTrue reading providersCountry of the human rightsCaged when you want to stand up I preach the great tyrannyThe supreme disorder of MisanthropyThe decision by our-selfThe choice of being ChristianConscious and faithful A vitriolic portraitOf a France which disgusts meI involve myself and make the oathTo do everything for a great change I preach the great tyrannyThe supreme disorder of MisanthropyThe decision by our-selfThe choice of being ChristianConscious and faithful
