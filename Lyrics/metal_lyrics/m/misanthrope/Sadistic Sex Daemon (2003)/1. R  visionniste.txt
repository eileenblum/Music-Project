I will tell you the reserveOf a three thousand year old French peopleFor whom freedom was a giftBut what of it now? They make us believeUnacceptable suppositionsIllusions of wisdomOn our past I scream revisionWe must re-examine everythingIntolerable adaptionDefamation of our historyIn the name of my people I say no! I'm revisionistOf the democracy's liesRe-read together their lordsOnly one voice: it's tyrannicalI saw the blood of my brothers runFor the colours of our standartPoisoned equalityHeads will fall down And if "the oath of the tennis-court"Was just a deceitAnd if the human rightsWere never inscribed RevisionistUnder the flag of truthIdealist persecutionHeads will fall downRevisionistStand up for libertyMachiavellian perversionHeads will roll Your knowledge is not my truthA wind of revolt's blowing at lastRe-open the rpison of "La Bastille"Slide the guillotine's blade I will tell you the reserveOf a three thousand year old French peopleFor whom freedom was a giftBut with insurrection their blood!
