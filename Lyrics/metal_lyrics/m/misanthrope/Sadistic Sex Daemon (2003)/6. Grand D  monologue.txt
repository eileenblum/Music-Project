Extinguished in silenceA night of 1566Without god's sanctificationBut rocked by angels Crusader's brotherLoyal to the Oath of allegianceJean-Jacques, arm of the kingUnder the Vatican's armorial On Rome's pathIlluminated by the crossProdigal virgin MaryTransmit power and belief You will be Christ's weaponOpposed to the army of darknessYou have thirteen daysTo regroup the demonsIn the seventh circleAgainst the nine windsYou have thirteen daysTo regroup the demonsExcommunicate the mpureAbbath and Asmodan Hunt the bringers of evilIn the center of every diablerieYou numbered 72 princesAnd 7 million 405 thousandAnd 926 demonsInfesting the vile hell Arch-Angel Saint MichelGreat purifierDrag them in the fallHands of godDemons swallower Jean-Jacques WierGreat daemonologistMortified apostleSatanic immunity Like you I set out in questOf a perfect humanityOn the road, new barbariansMan with a frozen heartWhere is your soul? Jean-Jacques Wier... Like you I set out in questOf a perfect humanityOn the road, new barbariansMan with a frozen heartPoor disillusion! Within these wallsDemoniac extravaganceOf the enchantress "Carcassonne"Join the last assaultBesiege the holy trinityI'm the strength of all prayersRe-united in a man of fleshS.A.S. De L'ArgiliÃ¨re Arch-Angel Saint Michel... Great daemonologist
