Projected in hyper spacePrey to the high infiniteWithout temporal parameterOn the edge of a yawning hole Nebula with seven branchesEntrance to an other universeI'm trapped by a black holeIn dissimilar cluster of atoms I lost my survival controlAt the border of reality Will I finally foresee the secrets of immortality? If you catch sight of lightFrom the depths of this black holeIt's death's callFrom it's infernal jawsIf you catch sight of lightFrom the depths of this black holeIt's death's callFrom it's infernal jaws A last vision of the earthSpace-craft in positionPut a brake of KronosReversing timeI pass beyond the dark and sad monolithQuartzified the component of the abyss I'm at the end of spaceWhere the stars fadeSpace travellerLast apostle of knowledge I'm inspired by the black holeAlone without defenceFrom a distance he drinks my bloodMy eyes are popping out of their socketsMy head explodes Catched by a black holeI've found my exitBy the fall, shame, wandering and disenchantmentA swing and I'm forever engulfed to nothingness If you catch sight of lightFrom the depths of this black holeIt's death's callFrom it's infernal jawsIf you catch sight of lightFrom the depths of this black holeIt's death's callFrom it's infernal jaws I discovered the equilibriumOf this word of Pandemonium A planisphere hold by one threadExtinction of a star Slow ascension to the fissureIn its center: the anti-matterPlunge in its openingJaws of thousand razorsNeverending painMy veins are gaping woundsExtinction...
