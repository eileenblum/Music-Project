From the Mount SinaiDoves are taking flightDeath sends it's messengersFrom the shadow's torments With naked feetFollow the ascetics pathA hand holding a candleSinging canticlesI make my sign of the crossMourning, rites and sorrow Enter the purgatory's roomFor a last holy sacrementA mahogany door reflecting the sunsetBless the dying in a sparkling sky ContemplationDismal meditationContemplationTo the walls of lamentations In the moist alcoveSurrounded by her familyI cannot endure to believe in itHitting her breast with my fistsThe head facing godIn a neverending screamThe confession must startI'm tired of seeing her in the throes of death ContemplationDismal meditationContemplationTo the walls of lamentations She's nude and lying downMy muse is sleepingBeautiful worried angelShining and eternal Shivering at the bell's tollSerene and ironicalHost, Judas and nail MaryMiserable absolution The priest is desirousTo finally end itHis bony faceEnjoys death with a real pleasures Shivering at the bell's tollSerene and ironicalHost, Judas and nail MaryMiserable absolution The priest is desirousTo finally end itHis bony faceEnjoys death with a real pleasures From the Mount SinaiDoves are taking flightDeath sends it's messengersFrom the shadow's tormentsAh ah ah...
