Follow the master's voice
The infernal growls of evil
Open the seventh gate
Tomorrow's episcopate

The diabolic secrets
Must be rept away
From mortal souls
The necromancers
Will forever lead
Our poor humanity

Follow the master's voice...
Confession to the supreme
Apocalyptic horsemen
Demons and antichrist
numbered by 666

Follow me
In my own hell
I will guide your steps
In the ehart of my universe
You wanted to know everything
Dead forever

Follow me
In my own hell
I will guide your steps
In the ehart of my universe
Now you know
smiling in the gloom

The cross is reversed
Yelling are getting closer
The good has retired
At the sanctuary's entrance

Alone in death
Suffering and agony
Hell's claws
Paradise inversion

Follow me
In my own hell
I will guide your steps
In the ehart of my universe
Now you know
smiling in the gloom

The cross is reversed
Yelling are getting closer
The good has retired
At the sanctuary's entrance

Alone in death
Suffering and agony
Hell's claws
Paradise inversion

In clandestinity be forever faithful to the black sun

By Christ's blood
Moaning from the inside
Plaintive damned
Crucify God's salvation

Listen to the choirs
The horns walk
Freak procession
Twisted satyricon

Bless me
In my own hell
I will guide your steps
In the heart of the universe
Now you know
Smiling in the gloom
