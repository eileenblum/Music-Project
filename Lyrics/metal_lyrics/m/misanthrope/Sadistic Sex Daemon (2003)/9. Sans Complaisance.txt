No complaisanceFor the third reich nostalgieNothing could be comparedIn the history of ignomity...ignomity Stop idealizingNational socialismHitlerite's racialismUnder it's gripWe will be the first victims: deporteePunish them all! We must never forgetThe deep mourning peopleMassacre in concentration camps...Concentrations campsI'm frightened it all starts over again Annihilate nazi organizationsAny form of dictatorshipAryanist has could you declareBeen a superior race? Filthy nausea The SS shall not be an exampleTo the children's eyesWe must denounceTheir detestable dealingsRise of the racial hateSimplistic ideas of powerLost adolescentIndoctrinated to facism Malignant premeditationAssembly of shame No complaisanceFor the third reich nostalgieThey must take consciousnessHave scruple to judge races Movement of disillusionScorn of humanitySenseless idolatry (of the FÃ¼:rher)Did they forget their past? No complaisanceFor the third reich nostalgieThey must take consciousnessHave scruple to judge races The medal of greatnessIs not on their uniformAuschwitz is not an iconDisgrace on humanity I'm not here to preachAny good wordsBut I hear the screamsWithin the wallsMy blood has the same densityAs my semite brothersAnd the same colourAs my god, king of the jew
