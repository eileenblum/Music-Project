I lived all my lifeIn a dark romanticismHeretic AristocratRebel against all laws Obsessed with grief and sadnessPhantoms of the pastPossess my eyelids I lived all my lifeIn a dark romanticismHeretic AristocratRebel against all laws To escape my thoughtsBeen in the dumpsI roam, drifting and hostileI played with my god Stand up to face menNever will I breakThe autumnal woodbines The crack where I'm strandedIs youth's powerGuided by sufferingTo avoid: the knowledge The crevasse where I fellDark romanticismGuided by sufferingRomantic hope I'm still always fascinatedBy death's desireFar from my familyWounded agony We could not live in sorrowWithout been betrayed Sincerely I love youWith passion above everythingImmortal loverBut misanthrope first of all Romantic dreamPhantasm of deathNo mysticismJust a moment in time I confide in youPlease deliver me Make a tear flowOr offer a smileWeeping criesMagnify desires ObscurantismWhere the wind drives madLonely among the wavesPirovetting through the gloom I confide in you I'm dying aloneFar from mineIn the extreme misery of christianityTo escape my thoughtsBeen the dumpsI roam, drifting and hostile I confide in you!
