[This is the mature thought made after the separation of the Misanthrope and mankind.
Restatement over a past and a future.
Why did we lose the power of hopeness living in harmony with the others?
Were can we turn around henceforth? Difficult choice: the end or the infinite?
These are the only alternative to the madness.]

Without a sentense I'm living you
My life and acts can't be possessed
Poor newborn child, do not believe in a past
My survival is over

Away from them, peace covers me
I'm going somewhere - "no one can follow me"
Only silence hears me, so I can say:
"I loved you"

[chorus]
Unsubdued redemption
Realm of retaliation
Unsubdued redemption
Shades of degeneration

Nowadays I control my way of life
Ancient alive dust which path following
Why shall I live on the earth
Unspoken call

Afraid in this empty human desert
My choice is done, I'm flying to thy
Upon my highness, I'm laughing impertinently
A smile on my lips

[chorus]

- Welcome to the paradise -

- Burst this church of lies -
