[Hopeness to be able to reborn in a world where misanthropy would not rage.
Before this is it is inside us and it pushes to be psycological revolt.
We can't practice violence, but on the other hand we have inside us hatetress.]

We shall put an end to your fear
Saving you from those tighted mind
No need for help from Satan
Be baptized for the final cataclism
Annihilate the entire human race
Permission &amp; tanks are giving
Accomplished mission is salvation
Hell is freezing

[chorus]
Reborn through misanthropy
Helped with a second birth
Human jungle drive you crazy
- Blaspheme the earth -
Blaspheme

Be made only in that way
Make them kill their own predeterminate lifes
No violence - Let's them incubate their fate -
No pity, no understanding, live for hate

[chorus]

No violence - Let's them incubate their fate -
No pity, no understanding, live for hate
Je te hais.
