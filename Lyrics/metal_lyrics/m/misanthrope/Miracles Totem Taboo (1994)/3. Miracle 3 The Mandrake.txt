[Deus Puerilis]

Deus, in adjutoruim meum intende.
Domine, ad adjuvandum me festina.

Gloria Patri, et Filio, Spiritui Sancto.
Sicut erat in principio, et nunc, et semper,
et in saecula saeculorum. Amen. Alleluia.

omnia sol temperat
Purus et subtilis
Novo mondo reserat
Faciem Deus Puerilis
Puerilis...

[...In Silence]

Slow skull embodiemment
Emerge to my feded mind
Alternated emotion of impurity
People are septic to my Misanthrotheories
Let me roar
Feel the utter evil
Oh... that's truly black metal
Alone in the depths of solitude I lay
Their cancer attacks a part of my crisis inside
Oh fall shadows, fall... belong the waves
Replace my mind, with a normal human one
Desperate Misanthrope,
lonely world carbonize my thoughts
Humanity pays:
Every hour they're trying to give me
In a followers mould, blessed Lord confess it
Jesus suffering, three days on the cross
I'm just twenty two, why so long a cost?
machines won't (let go) nature go God's ways
...In silence I denounce:
Life harmony is a pledge to be
Doomsday hours alleviate slowly the carrion's path
This call is for me -Allowance times arrives-
Sigh the Obituary of Misanthropy
Take my hand
-Slowly-
Pulls is inhuman
Present
And see differences between the past &amp; present Future
Time keeper memorize the ...
Past
Operation dissect my gated's compressed mind
Brain changing necessity
Human's system, security
Sign the Obitary of Misanthropy

[Totem Of Doubt]

Link souls to the totem of doudt
Totem of doubt
Once again I shut my eyes passing through a nebulus void
Constantly watching in your mind
Guide my hands to the realm where nothing dies
Without any regrtes I will burn my arms
Life's end float away on the waves of incomprehension
I shall die upon nailed emotions
From the sky tears drop like rain
Crawling loss of ancien remains
Rememberance of my orgasm
Horn's voices whisps of iconoclasm
Rememberance of my orgasm
Horn's voices whisps of iconoclasm

[Velvet Solemn Quest]

Lords...
Lord of fates
Creator of the sun
Man of absolute
Universe's prayer sung
Father of hate
Master of the earth
Oh... velvet paradise
Stone solemn quest
Endless soul grace
Break the labyrinth's silence
Farewell of my heart
Doom fate creator
When I look upon the sun
I die eternally
But my soul rises for thee
Which will burn (near you) endlessly
Oh lord
You died for hymns
Mighty soul
Answers me
Onto the sun
Rise thee
Oh lord -Died for hymns
Mighty soul
Answers me

Mourner's lament
To heaven I have came to stay
From a sad side my fate hail
Pray
-Nightfall's morning is my hour-
And adore
Sadness
-God's tears- Thy
