1666... Theatre bizarre
Poet easthetic
Misanthropic Art
1666... you love the bizarre
Architect lunatic
A sun above above the stars

Unveil the hearth of bizarre,
Behind the theater bars
Unlock the wood carven sliding door
Feel deeply the loss of MoliÃ¨re
Into a hall almost unreal
Each step encloses... a hidden secret.

Bizarre scenery

Bizarre scenery
Cunning shadows unfold gracefully the red long-pile carpet
On which it was the custom in olden days
To curtsey to Louis the XIV a half turned reverence.
On the walls... enchantress embroidery,
Courteous courtezan and gentle marquess.

The haunted and forgotten spirits of masquerade surround you
Abandoned in the endless gallery of the Louvre museum.

1666... Theatre bizarre
Poet easthetic
Misanthropic Art
1666... you love the bizarre
Architect lunatic
A sun above above the stars

Fall asleep, scornfull failure
Fatigued by the lapse of weakness of the gothic structure
Suddenly in the ultimate antechamber of separation
At the confines of this mysterious maze
A sharp voice escapes the groove and calls upon me
Welcome in the bosom of the familly, son De L'ArgiliÃ¨re
Establish home in the theatre bizarre
Where contemptuous is synonym of illusory
...And remember to answer the calls of the theatre bizarre
