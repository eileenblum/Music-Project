Nothing can cheer me
I am like the king of a rainy land,
Wealthy but impotent, moribond and senile.

Nothing can cheer me
Even the sage alchemist who no longer smoothes my gold,
Nor my subjects who come to die beneath the balcony.

Nothing can cheer me
I am like the king of a rainy land,
Wealthy but impotent, moribond and senile.

I'm the dissonant chord in the divine symphony,
Condemned to eternal chants but unable to sing.
Gargantuan decline
Gargantuan decline

I shed a darkness sadder than nights are
Detestable silent child, hurl a horrible howl
Chamber of eternal mourning vibrant with old agony
Hear the bitter laughter of the whale.
Prince of exile, to whom injustice has been done
In your defeat arise more firm.

Nothing can cheer me
Even the sage alchemist who no longer smoothes my gold,
Nor my subjects who come to die beneath the balcony.

Vampire of my own heart
Kisses alive mortuary chrysalids
Gargantuan decline
Gargantuan decline

Prince of exile, implant in hearts the cult of wounds
Soaring aloft the like a second sun.
Prince of exile, to whom harm has been done,
Enable the lotus bloom.
