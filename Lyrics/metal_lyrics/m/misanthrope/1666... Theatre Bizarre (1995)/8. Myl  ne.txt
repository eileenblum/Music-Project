As in a poem of Lewis Carrol
MylÃ¨ne's mournful life drifts away... away, so far away
Anguish plants its subtle anger
Like a paranoid mind's depression

Watch the hollow of my life, when it's empty of sin,
That even the sun cannot illuminate.
Oh, night without stars and half hidden moon
Veil the prelude of my miscarried suicide !
Suicide

Melancholic
Ecstasy
Misanthropic
Sensuality
She smiles on the divan and let herself be loved

Ecstasy
Sensuality
Melancholy collapses on humanity
Triumphant splendour of Misanthropy
Completely naked MylÃ¨ne was lying on white marble

She sings in sweet violence
Mankind's downfall love romance.
Her sex covered with blood,
Seduced by De Sade's son,
Queen of melancholy.
Worship MylÃ¨ne's misanthropy.
Scourge me Goddess of hate !
On my knees as a loyal slave...

Ecstasy
Sensuality
Melancholy collapses on humanity
Triumphant splendour of Misanthropy
ComplÃ¨tement nue MylÃ¨ne git sur le marbre blanc.

Don't let my spirit fall in love
And pretend to a tomorrow
Tonight, close your almond eyes
Entwined between your breasts.
Let only the sadness
Whip your devilish body
I ceased to hope
Abandon me, as a prey to evil, a tarnished soul.

Melancholy
Misanthropy
Melancholy collapses on humanity
Triumphant splendour of Misanthropy
Wantonness gave a new born charm to her rippling.

She sings in sweet violence
Mankind's downfall love romance.
Her sex covered with blood,
Seduced by De Sade's son,
Queen of melancholy.
Worship MylÃ¨ne's misanthropy.
Scourge me Goddess of hate !
I'm your loyal lover... Mistress.
