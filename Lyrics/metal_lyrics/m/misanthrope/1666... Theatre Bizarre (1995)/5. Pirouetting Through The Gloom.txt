Then I die in a crimson world from behind,
Praise my defunct soul to the highest sky.

Pirouetting through the gloom, God guides my acts
As an angel tempted by
The lust for the deformed
Lashing out the depths of a being
Lapsed from the azure, fallen
Into the slough, where no eyes can penetrate
As a soul under a spell
Futilely searching for pleasure, in vain.

Then I die in a crimson world from behind,
Praise my defunct soul to the highest sky.
Above the lights of loneliness,
my tears flow out of my eyes
As the blood of Christ stains my hands.

Caught in a cristal conquest
Seeking for the pearls of life
Plain emblems of a luxury fate.

Sombre and lucid exchange
In a heart that has become its own mirror
A well of truth, clear though black, a torch of grace.

Drink the chalice
Raise our flag to the livid star,
An invisible reflection of bizarre.

Caught in a cristal conquest
Seeking for the pearls of life
Tremble, livid star !
Resound, immortal drums of the bizarre.

Sombre and lucid exchange
In a heart that has become its own mirror
A well of truth, clear though black, a torch of light.

Tremble, livid star !
Resound, immortal drums of the bizarre
Pirouetting through the gloom, God guides my acts
As an angel tempted by
The lust for the deformed
Lashing out the depths of a being
Lapsed from the azure, fallen
Into the slough, where no eyes can penetrate
As a soul under a spell
Futilely searching for pleasure, in vain.

Our consciousness in evil
Pirouetting through the gloom
Our consciousness in evil
Evil

Pirouetting through the gloom
Our consciousness in evil
Our consciousness in evil

Pirouetting through the gloom, God guides my acts
As an angel tempted by
The lust for the deformed
Lashing out the depths of a being
Lapsed from the azure, fallen
Let my body wither away
Scarlet will acrimoniously wrap my enigma
A last elevation until I die
Farewell to heartlessness.

Then I die in a crimson world from behind,
Praise my defunct soul to the highest sky.
Above the lights of loneliness,
my tears flow out of my eyes
As the blood of Christ stains my hands.
