Evil seems to be endless
Just when we think we have discovered,
Heard and found out some
Infamie which is already off limits,
Again comes something
New even more scaring
Sometimes it's like we live in a world
That will surely break
Down under the pressure of modern life 
Sinners breed like sickness,
People have no control over their 
Most primary feelings

Any society that you build 
Will have its own limits
Is murder like anything you take to
Once that you've decided on a killing,
First you make a stone out
Of your heart and if you find 
That your hands are still willing,
Then you can turn mass murder into art
Now if you have a taste 
For killing experience 
And if you're flushed with
Your very first success,
Then you really should try 

Lay them down in front of me
Lay them down for all to see
Here is one as white as snow
Bound to beliefs that
You are bound to go
And with this point sharpened by a fire 
I'll bring out the truth,
I show who's the liar

Never ending cries, its following you
Weakness breed like disease   
Gripped in illusion, of brutality
Picture of your vices

Pain, my only friend 
Can't stand this feeling
Shame, your only way
Can't stop the killing
