All my most cherished illusions,
Fell to the ground
And slowly, my frienly spirits
Have turned yellow

What is right, what is not
But it must be understood
Evil means, doing nice things
Yet it does not lead to good
We should make, no mistake
Human values are being degrading
A forecast, for the future
It may never look so good or bad

The range of human madness,
Corrupt and wrong
Truly like two sides of a coin,
Offending and proud
We see the forgotten ones,
Locked together
While they are the leaders
Who live on forever
But yet the world stiil goes on,
In truth broken
Getting mad, getting even,
Humanize human
