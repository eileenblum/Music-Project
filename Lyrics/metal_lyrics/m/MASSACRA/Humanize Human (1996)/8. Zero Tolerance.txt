Crowded place, the same face
But I should speak out my mind
I'm free and it scares me
Goddamn I wish I was blind
Like a child I was told
We just need what we can hold
Everyone's got feelings
But no one's got time for me
Won't you tell, it's so weak
Way hard to believe I'm in the cold
Life's too long, hanging around
It's getting late and I can't wait
It's late, too late

That's the deal and it's for real
I guess we all have to cry someday
How can it be, what I see
Emptiness, just feeds their souls
Whispering or yelling
But no hope of ever being heard
Everything has a price
I won't be long for this world
Dead end street, where else to be
And how can I make these people see
We all say, men don't cry
I should have known, it was just a lie
A lie, you lie

Twisted dreams pull the trigger
But it ain't gettint brighter
Zero tolerance I see
I would say just let me be

I see through you disguise
It hurts too much to stay there
Just time to realize
The more we get the less we care
