A fresh affliction
Mockery of modern times
Original disillusion
Sacrifice for your former lies

Apparently well provided
Destitute today like a child in need
I take the blame

Unreal is what I feel
A new fictionnal beginning

False desolation
Realistic disgust
Equal to poison addiction
Ignored, broken deep inside

Fuse together, segments of life
If a piece is lost, the mind is blank

I bleed artificial, simulated
I've too much pain, today in my brain
