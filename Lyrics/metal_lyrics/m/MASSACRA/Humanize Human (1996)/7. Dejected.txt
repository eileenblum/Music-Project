Someone's to blame
I won't cry this time, Iwon't cry again
We're just not the same
I promise today I won't show my pain
Yesterday they it was lost
But I lose my life if I try to be soft
Should I follow what they say
And tell why should I believe who they prey 

I'm racking up the past
Teach me but I will never betray my feelings
You can try to mold me
One of these days I will send you greetings
In the name of experience
Obsolete behaviour in the name of science 
Ignorance is bliss
You say speak now or forever hold you peace

Sounds very hard to know, and easy to forget
One more terrible blow, will make people upset
You're not able to tell, I'm only wondering
My disgust has a smell, and a real strong meaning

And day by day
Nothing to say
I'm so close to explode
It's beyond my control
Blind
I'm just wasting my time
We call it a failure
Too long to get over
