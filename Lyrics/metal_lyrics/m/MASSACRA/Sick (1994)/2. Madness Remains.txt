Nothing will change my mind,
I think I told you
Many things I was never shown,
I won't be like you
Many I'll never see, nobody told me
Want to throw my life down the drain,
And walk in the rain
Not a next day, only today
Not tomorrow, here and right now
I want to forget it, not think it over
I don't want to be a lawyer, only murderer

[Chorus :]
On the brink of madness
I'm with my back to the wall, but I'll be strong
Empty eyes, in anguish
Here today gone tomorrow, I'm getting cold
Not scared, just cold
I can't make up, for lost time now
Just look out which way the wind blows
For the last time, for the last day
No more to gain, madness remains

You can run, you can hide, be guilty or innocent
Try to scream and struggle
Wherever you go, it will find you someday
You can't paint the town red,
Be loaded or restitute
Try to leave and forget,
Whatever you do, it will find you someday
On the corner, two blocks away
From up above, close to you
You can move, heaven and earth,
Be a big name or small fry
Try to pray and repent
Whoever you are, it will find you someday
