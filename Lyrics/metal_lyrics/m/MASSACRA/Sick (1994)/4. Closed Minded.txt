So what did I do, to deserve that too
Filled with remorse, this time I know
I hear you laughing, I will do my thing
You live and learn, it serves me right
Never say never, cause not it's over
I have to take the rough with the smooth
Act for me first, it cannot be worst
Next time, I'll be narrow minded

[Chorus :]
You're the one to blame, you put me to shame
I know I was taken in
You life is a lie, I wish you could cry
My pain is never ending

To give all I've got, today I forgot
Let down again this time I know
I see you smiling, let me say something
I'll do the same for you sometime
So called memories, so called boundaries
So it goes I learned my lesson
I will care for me and my soul only
Next time I'll be closed minded

My mind was yours, your hate is mine
I gave my faith, don't waste your breath

I see you smiling, let me do my thing
Totally taken and possessed
I hear you laughing, let me say something
Never again so obsessed
