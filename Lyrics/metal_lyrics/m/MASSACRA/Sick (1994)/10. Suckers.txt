Opression, where they fought for freedom
Revolution, where life was peaceful
A nightmare, it was just a dream
But never mind, we don't give damn

[Chorus :]
I've been to blind for too long
Masters and fakers, who's gonna save me
Suckers and preachers, can't you believe me

Oily slick, where the water was clear
Homeless people, while some strike it rich
Barren land, where the forest was green
But never mind, we don't give damn

One that laughs, one that cries,
So much we don't understand
Rebellion, starvation,
The same story that's a fact
One step up, two steps back,
The same story once again
Believers, agnostics,
Get down on your knees and pray
