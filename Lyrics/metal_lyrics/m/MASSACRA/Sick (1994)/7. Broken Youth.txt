Can you tell me who knows right from wrong
I'm not the man I wanted to be
All I can see from all around
Is all I fear since I was born
Who said youth is fun
And I do waste my time

My ideas go against the tide
So much time I spent lost in thought
None of my dreams came true
I'm not waiting for something new
I resign myself
But you can't make me

Nothing kills like the daily grind
No escape from the hell I've been living
Why do you keep me from hoping
Release me, with the truth I'm face to face

[Chorus :]
All over the world
People just like me
Bitterness leads to death
Broken youth

Boredom and scorn got a hold on me
But what I want is to be free
Who says I'm different
Who knows my difference
But I feel not the same
And I don't care, I don't care
