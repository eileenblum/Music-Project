Harmless numbers
The source of your satisfaction
Harmfull leaders
Can you see our disillusion
Full of power
That will be your downfall someday
Absolute reign
Nothing lasts, you will miss the past,
You will miss the past

[Chorus :]
There through the ages,
We're locked up in your cages
Day by day we realize, this is time for lies
Nothing more for me, in your society
Day by day we realize, you laugh at my cries

Puppet you carry no weight
Numbers someone runs the show
Thousand people will follow
A clown born to have the crown
The sheep are grazing
Servants are sleeping
Have your conscience clear
Have your conscience clear

You're the maker
I don't belong to anything
Pawn in your hand
You never brought me to your knees
Break the system
I'm a shock to the system
Full of glory
Something that you will never see
