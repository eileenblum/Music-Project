Glued to screen today
I saw grief and joy like if I was on the spot
Give me the words of love
All the scandal sheets carry the story again
Show me the cries of hate
Just watching from here it will be on tv live,
Glued to the tube right now
Enjoying the picture, can't believe that it's true

All the news that's fit to print
Follow up story another eventful day
My reality
Readers eager to violence
Life of decadence
Hearing of evil broadcasts
Hope it never lasts

[Chorus :]
Mass attraction, optical illusion
Insane crime, it's a question of time
Hypnoticed, nobody realized
Basic culture, for my senseless future

Glued to screen today
I saw grief and joy like if I was on the spot
Give me the words of love
All the scandal sheets carry the story again
I saw death, pain and me
More than real, more than concrete,
I'm speechless with fear
I met both of them too
Anger from an angel and rage of the devil
