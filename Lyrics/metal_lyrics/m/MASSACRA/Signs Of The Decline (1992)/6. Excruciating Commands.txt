[Lyrics : Chris Palengat]

Feeling no remorse when bombs land on target
You feel the satisfaction of a job well done
Devoid of feeling
You`re a war machine
Devotion to duty, no sense of regret
It`s the result of treatments you`ve undergone

Drafted to this air armada
Because you`re at their beck and call
Filled full of propaganda
They`ve got your mind under control
Brainwashing program

Fire and forget instruction
Conditioned reflex
No human factor
Blind subordination

Dropping a thousand bombs without hesitation
No consideration for the people you kill devoid of feeling
You`re a war machine
They`ve erased your scruples about slaughtering
You obey orders on your own free will

You`ve followed a special training
Molding your sensibility
They`ve broken you, no thinking for yourself
Changing your personality

Mental enslavement
Fire and forget instruction
Conditioned reflex
No human factor
Blind subordination

Now you live the life of an automation
And they obtain your entire submission
Using this program of indoctrination
They`ve neutralized your conscience
You`re a mere shadow of your former self
Unquestioning obedience

It`s their way of appeasing your conscience
Psychological cleaning
You`ve been brainwashed
