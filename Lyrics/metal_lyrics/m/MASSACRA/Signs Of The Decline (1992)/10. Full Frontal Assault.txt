[Lyrics : Greg Conan / Chris Palengat]

The gathering smell of rotteness
Is cutting through my brain
Slicing up my friends
And then killing the pain
Gathered here together for our final day

Never ending strain
Fighting tooth and nail
Short on munitions
The say "War is hell"

Slaughtered for the objective
In the thick of the battle
Going on an onslaught
In a desperate struggle

Blind suicide, pain and suffering

On the other side
There is no reason why
In this viscious circle
Surely one will die

War cry fix bayonets
In the face of death
No time for regrets
The brunt of the attack

Full frontal assault
Suicidal rampage

Families !
Corpses strewn upon the battle fields
Memories !
An old wound never heals

The gathering smell of rotteness
Is cutting through my brain
Slicing up my friends
And then killing the pain
Gathered here together for our final day

Political corrupts and hypocrites
And fanatical religiousness
Commit us to die for who`s country ?
So who is the real enemy

Puppet`s and leader`s
And pawn`s in the game
Victim`s of the high command
Sacrificed in vain

Full frontal assault
Suicidal rampage

Life is to serious to take seriously
"Greg Conan"
