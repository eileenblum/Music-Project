[Lyrics : Fred Death]

No love, absolute hatred
Civilization in regression

The human race was born to make war
To hate each other
The nature only made one mistake to
Give intelligence to human being

Mutual assured destruction
Civilization in regression

Devasting reign in the cause of god
Kingdome of corruption, madmen in command
People die by torture and pain
Rotting eyes, scorchung flesh, decapitation

I`m under the impression to live an eternal nightmare
The world seems to be in a hopeless situation

Men like fighting and have no fear
Men feel no shame, they`re hunger for power
Distorting truth, religion of the lie
No one trust no one

Mutual assured destruction
Civilization in regression

Absolute rage, racial extermination
See them cry, watch them die

There`s no heaven but just hell called
Planet earth
I hope the end is near
We have to be exterminated
I wish I could do it and them kill myself
That`s the ultimate solution
I just can`t wait for that day
