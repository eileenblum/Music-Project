[Lyrics : Greg Conan / Chris Palengat]

Metabolic degenerations
The consequences of manipulation

Monsters were created in the thousands
Born dead creatures that live again

In order to protect all species
Guarded I labs for if and when

Embryos / degeneration
Signs of life / insemination

Preserved in a sanctuary
Sheltered in incubators
Brandnew biotechnology
This embryonic society

Splitting and changing molecules
When it`s over who will be who

Test tubes / D.N.A.
Last survivors / will have to play

Protected
Geneotypes
Biologic
Memories

The ecological degredations
Are the cause of these genetic mutations

Hybred and deformed species
Are the results of this metamorphosis

Keeping the pure foetuses alive
Is the ultimate solution to survive

Cryogenic
Suspension
Defying
Man`s creation
