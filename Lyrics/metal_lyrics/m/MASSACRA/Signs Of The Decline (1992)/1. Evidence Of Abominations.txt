[Lyrics : Greg Conan / Chris Palengat]

Reality is more cruel than fiction
It is beyond all imagination

Hate is a reality
And violence a sin
Don`t run in the face of the enemy
Because it comes from within

Don`t pass over it silence
Cause it`s a matter of consciousness

War is a reality
And torture a friend
Our lyrics are pleasant
Compared to the end

Evidence of abominations
Open your eyes
It`s an actual fact
Existence of abominations
Don`t close your eyes
It`s time to react

Indifference is your excuse
And ignorance your refuge

The face of the evidence
Is as sad as your true
