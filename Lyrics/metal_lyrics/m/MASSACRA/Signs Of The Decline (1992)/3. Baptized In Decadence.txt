[Lyrics : Greg Conan]

The meaning of words comes from within
The gift of life is death in the end
Infinite enemies and forgotten friends
Experiences is wisdom

A law you cannot bend
From up and above and down below
Religion is money
Just part of the show

Innocence at birth for all that it`s worth
Baptized in corruption
On the road to humanity

Given to Adam this present from Eve
Eternal damnation is the form of a seed

In order to lie you must believe
To be like the others you have to deceive
To steal from another is a brother in need
To give all you`ve got, just to bleed

Written on paper
Etched in stone, histories of life
And futures unknown
Time is your mother

Innocence at birth for all that it`s worth
Baptized in decadence
For total self destruction
