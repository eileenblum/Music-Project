[Lyrics : Chris Palengat]

Gang rape victims your suffer from an emotional trauma
Inwardly possessed with panic
Terrorized now you`re neurotically seized with frigth
On the brink of a coma

Overcome with fear
And dread you withdraw into silence
Blank look, you`re soulness, violated innocence
This mental scar is engraved on your memory
The rest of your life will be an endless agony
Living with your scare, it`s a perpetual nightmare
You withdraw into yourself

Traumatic fear
Deep seated fright
Traumatic fear
Rooted phobia

Haunted by fear it was left you a vegetable
Paralysed, terrified, you`re got a mental block
You`re caught in a viscious circle
Prisoner of this state of shock

Living with scare, it`s a perpetual nightmare
And you sink into madness

Overcome with fear and dread you withdraw
Into silence

Blank look, you`re soulness, violeted innocence
This mental scar is engraved on your memory
The rest of your life will be and endless agony

After effect, you`re a prey to hallucinations
And a look of terror is frozen on your face
Obsessed with macabre visions
You`re in a delirium of fear

Traumatic fear
Deep seated frigth
Traumatic fear
Rooted phobia
