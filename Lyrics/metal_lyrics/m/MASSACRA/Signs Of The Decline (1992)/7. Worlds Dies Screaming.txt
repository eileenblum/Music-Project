[Lyrics : Greg Conan]

I want to leave here, before it`s too late
Open my arms and embrace my fate
Rocked in the cradle, and then
Drowned in hell`s lake
When I go the earth will shake

Into the darkness ! I thrust my sword
I curse at you ! Almighty lord

I`m the forgotten one, who has no name
The bastard son, who feels no pain
One of four, one of a kind
One of those, lost in time

I`ve taken too much of this, and drank
Too much of that
I`ll vomit it all up, and we`ll all take a bath

I crap on your systems and your faces

The difference form right and the knowledge of wrong
Are the lessons you know, when you`re dead and gone
Feeling of pleasure and feelings of pain
Are the sensations, just part of the game

Into the darkness ! Thrust my sword
I come to thee ! Almighty lord

Like a switch a blade that knows where to go
I`ll spill your blood, and demand some more
