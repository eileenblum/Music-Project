SET ... ME ... FREE
LET ... ME ... OUT
WHAT RIGHT HAVE YOU TO KEEP ME AS A HOSTAGE

I'M NOT CRAZY
WHAT RIGHT HAD YOU TO SENTENCE ME FOR LIFE
I'M NOT GUILTY

YOU KEPT ME IN CONFINEMENT
I'VE BEEN THERE FOR A LONG TIME
AND I'VE LOST ALL SCENCE OF TIME

ALWAYS CONFINED IN THE DARK
NO RAYS OF LIGHT, NO LAND OF MARK
I MUST BE OUT OF MY MIND
I FEEL THAT I'M GOING TO BLIND

YOU TREAT ME ROUGHLY
AND MERCILESSLY
I'M HERE TO STAY
IN THE NAME OF THE LAW, I'M SENTENCED FOR LIFE

I'M AN EMBRASSING WITNESS
'CAUSE I KNOW THINGS THAT I SHOULDN'T KNOW
I'VE GOT INTO A FUCKIN' MESS
WHY DID I DECIDE TO GO TO LAW?

CORRUPTION TOOK THE PLACE OF JUSTICE
I WANT TO GET OUT OF THIS CELL, OF THIS JAIL

YOU TREAT ME ROUGHLY ... [see above]

SINCE MY LAST DISAPPEARANCE
NO ONE KNOWS MY EXISTENCE
NOW I'M ROTTING IN PRISON
NO ESCAPE, NO SOLUTION

I FELT ABOUT IN THE DARK
BUT I'VE NEVER FOUND A GAP
SOME RATS KEPT ME COMPANY
AND I ATE THEM HEARTLY

YOU TREAT ME ROUGHLY .... [see above]
