THE ROOMS SMELLS DUMB AND DEATH
EVERYBODY CATCH THEIR BREATH
SUSPENSE AND DEATHLY HUSH
YOU'RE READY TO TRY YOUR LUCK

DON'T GO BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF REASON
IT'S A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH
IT'S TIME TO PASS A RESOLUTION
YOU'VE ALREADY COME CLOSE TO DEATH

NEARER...
TO DEATH

MONEY, BETS AND WAGERS
IT WON'T HAVE TWO WINNERS
GAMES AND DEPRAVITY
RUSSIAN ROULETTE'S STILL IN BE

YOU'RE PREPARED TO TAKE PART IN THIS GAME
YOU DO IT TO EARN YOUR LIVING
IT'S A LONG TIME YOU'VE GOT A BAD NAME
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN AND YOU'RE SWEATING

NEARER...
TO DEATH

LIFE IS MORE PRECIOIUS THAN CASH
YOU SHOULDN'T BRAVE THE POWER OF DEATH
ONE DAY YOU'LL BE KILL OUTRIGHT
'CAUSE THE BULLET'LL BE AIMED AT YOU

A GUN SHOT'LL BREAK THE SILENCE
AND THERE'LL BE A SMELL OF GUN POWDER
BLOOD'LL SPURT OUT FROM YOUR HEAD
AND YOUR BODY'LL LIE ON THE GROUND
