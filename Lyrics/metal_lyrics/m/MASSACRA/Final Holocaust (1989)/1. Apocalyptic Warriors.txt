IN A LAND OF DARKNESS
ONLY WAR MAKES THEM LIVE
NO ONE KNOWS WHO THEY ARE
IT'S TOO LATE TOKNOW IT
DEATH WARRIORS WITHOUT FEAR
DESTROYING ALL AROUND
THEY ARE BACK, BACK TO KILL
WITH VIOLENCE AND BLOODSHED

ONLY DEATH IN THEIR SOULS
JUST MADNESS IN THEIR BRAINS
NO ESCAPE YOU WILL DIE
NOBODY WILL SURVIVE
DEATH WARRIOR WITHOUT FEAR
DESTROYING ALL AROUND
THEY ARE BACK, BACK TO KILL
WITH VIOLENCE AND BLOODSHED

THEY'RE SLAVES OF DEATH, RAVAGING WITH DEATH IN THEIR SIDES

STAND IN THEIR WAY
OR RUN AWAY
THEY'RE BACK TO SLAY
KEEP OUT OF THEIR WAY
IT'S TIME TO PRAY
THEY'RE HERE TO STAY

IN THE DARK OF THE NIGHT
THEY ARE BACK TO ATTACK
HEAR THEIR SCREAMS HEAR YOUR CRIES
NO PITY PEOPLE DIE

DEATH WARRIORS WITHOUT FEAR
DESTROYING ALL AROUND
NOW YOU KNOW WHO THEY ARE
ETERNAL GHOSTS OF WAR

THEY SLAVES .... [see above]

STAND IN THEIR WAY .... [see above]
