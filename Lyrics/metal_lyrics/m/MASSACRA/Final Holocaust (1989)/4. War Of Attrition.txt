FAR AWAY, BLOODSTAINED BANNERS OF DEATH
IRON, LEATHER, AROUND WARRIORS
THE STAE OF SIEGE'S GONNA BE DECLARE
SPREADING PANIC, IT'S A NIGHTMARE
SWORDS GLEAM IN THE SUN
WE'VE GOT NO PLACE TO TURN

MURDEROUS KNIGHTS, RESOLUTE BESIEGERS
FORTIFIED CASTLE, PROUD DEFENDERS
TERRIBLE FIGHTS, PITILESS INVADERS

STANDING IN FEAR THE CONFRONTATION
NEEDLESS TO BE UNDER DELUSION
THEY'VE COME TO OVER RUN THE LAND
WE'RE GONNA HOLD OUT TO THE END
TRAPPED IN THIS CASTLE
LIFE AND DEATH STRUGGLE

NO SURRENDER, THERE'LL BE NO PRISONER
INVASION, DEVASTATION
NO SURRENDER, FACING THE INVADER
STARVATION, WAR OF ATTRITION

THEY'VE COME TO BUILT A NEW EMPIRE
FLAMES AND SMOKE, THE PLACE IS ON FIRE
THE BATTLE IS RAGING
CONSTANT HARASSING

HOPELESS END, DESPERATE STRUGGLE
THROES OF DEATH RATTLE FOR DAYS ON END
COVETED LAND, NEVER ENDING BATTLE

NO SURRENDER ... [see above]
