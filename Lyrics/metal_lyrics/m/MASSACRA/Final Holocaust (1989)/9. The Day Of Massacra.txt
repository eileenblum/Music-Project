SCENERY OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION
SHOW OF SACK AND AGGRESSION
SMOKE SCREEN AND RAYS OF LIGHT
HOWLING CROWDED READY TO FIGHT

HEMOGLOBIN STARTS TO FLOW
ALL SYSTEMS GO TO BEGIN THE SHOW
OFFERING YOU AS A SACRIFICE
IT'S A BLOODBATH, IT'S A GENOCIDE

VIOLENCE ... MASSACRA
TORMENTS ... MASSACRA
DOOMSDAY ... MASSACRA
THE DAY OF MASSACRA

THE MARSHALL NOISE IS DRIVING YOU MAD
AND THE SCENE IS TAKING BY STORM
TURNING EVERYTHING UPSIDE DOWN
EVERYBODY'S THRASHING ALL AROUND

PLAYING FASTER WITH VOLUME HIGHER
THERE'S NO LIMIT, IT'S SHEER MURDER
GOING BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF REASON
NO SELF CONTROL, POSSESSED BY DEMON

IN A STATE OF EXHAUSTATION
AND BATHED IN PERSPIRATION
EVERYBODY IS OUT OF BREATH
BUT WE STILL THRASH TILL DEATH

VIOLENCE ... [see above]
