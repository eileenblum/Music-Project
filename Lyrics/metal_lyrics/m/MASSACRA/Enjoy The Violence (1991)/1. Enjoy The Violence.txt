I'm the dictates of your guilty conscience
You must comply to my evil influence

You'd like to throw your boss out of the window
Show no mercy and cut him up with a chainsaw

You can't bear this rep bothering your wife
So rip him open with a carving knife
You wonder how to kill your enemy
Smash his head until it's gravy

[Chorus:]
You take pleasure
In using violence
It's in your nature
Psychopathic sense

Psychological conflict
You're under my influence
You can't repress your instinct
I incite you to violence

Enjoy
The violence

I control your inward rage
You can't suppress your anger
I possess you, I'm your cage
You feel an urge to murder

[Chorus]

I'm the dictates of your guilty conscience
You must not comply to my evil influence

Your neighbour is always fucking you around
Put your fingers in his eyes and scratch them out

You hate the collector and the income tax
Keep your money and cut him to pieces with an axe

You've had enough of cops and parking tickets
Take your gun and riddle them with bullets

[Chorus]

Prompted my brutal force
You commit crimes in cold blood
With no feeling of remorse
You're always thirsting for some more

Enjoy the violence
