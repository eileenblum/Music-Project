It's the end of christian faith
The advent of messiah
It's the start of satan's reign
The start of an evil era

After two thousand years of lies
Death to the ecclesiastics
After two centuries of crimes
Death to all catholicism

Mass executions/ultimate antichrist
Carnage
Crucifixation/ultimate antichrist
Pillage

This vile breath of trust
Has led men's lust
Annihilation
And renunciation
It's the price of lies
All clergymen must die

Global anarchy/ultimate antichrist
Decay
Total heresy/ultimate antichrist
Decline

It's the end of the christian faith
The advent of messiah
It's the start of satan's reign
The start of an evil era

Blasphemy and depravity
Complete denial of christ
Infamy and debauchery
The ultimate antichrist
