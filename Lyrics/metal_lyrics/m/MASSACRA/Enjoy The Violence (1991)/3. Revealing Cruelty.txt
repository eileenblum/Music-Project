Sick at heart and not quit sane
You are seething with anger
This war is driving you insane
You feel an urge to slaughter

Volunteer
Young recruit
You're about
To lose your nerves

Shocked by the horrors of war
You can't keep yourself control
Reality hit hard by this war 
Now you want to kill them all

Volunteer
Young recruit
You're flying
into a rage

Exhausted
You are tense
Excited
You're in trance

Outburst of fury
You're killing blindly
Outburst of fury
Revealing cruelty

Impulsive
Reaction
Instinctive
Brutality

Taking leave of your sense
You're facing the enemy
Commiting atrocities
Indiscriminately

Tormenting
Destroying
Old women
And children

Getting into a fury
And feeling the crime
Shooting indifferently
And destroying the live

Full of hatred

Your end is near

Death to the traitor
Prepare
To die soon
There is no place
For you and your kind
It's to late
To regret

I wanna take revenge
On you for what you've done
I'm gonna take vengeance
Then justice will be done

You'll pay for this
Sooner or later
Don't forget
I'll get you
Don't try to hide
There is no escape
It's too late
You nust die

Bastard it will cost you your life
You wiill die a violent death
I will put an end to your life
Tourture and slow acting death
It's useless to protect yourself
And don't try to hide
Determined to avenge numbered
I'm full of hatred

Your end is near
Death to the traitor
Prepare
To die soon
There is no place
For you and your kind
It's too late
To regret

I wanna take revenge
On you for what you have done
I'm gonna take vengeance
Then justice will be done

You have not much longer to live
You'll receive your punishment
You have no alternative
It will be your last judgement
