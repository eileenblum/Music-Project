God gave birth to the human race
What a fuckin' mistake!
Perversion
Corruption
Decadence and vice

Men forget they belong to this earth
They'll pay for this neglect
Pollution
Destruction
Regardless of life

Apocalypse
Sublime extermination

Earthquakes/Deluge and floods
Now men submit to god's wrath
Death sentence and divine bloodbath

Chaos/Fire and storms

Apocalyptic doomsday
The seven deadly sins men pay

God the father shows no mercy
No forgiveness of sins
God punish
Men perish
The final judgement

The mother earth turns against all men
Repairing disaster
Giantic
Cataclysm
The new lease on life
Revelation
Sublime extermination
