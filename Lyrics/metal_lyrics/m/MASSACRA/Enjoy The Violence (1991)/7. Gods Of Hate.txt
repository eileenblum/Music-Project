Humanity won't live in peace for sure
And history is based on "war and hate"
The human race has a violent nature
That's why we relate
We are the violence
Which flows in your veins
We are the dark side
Of your conscience remains
We're the reflection
Of death on earth
We're the expression
Of hate and rebirth

The death incarnate
Massacra
The gods of hate
We are

We are the madness
Which controls your brain
We are the image
Of all your crimes

We're the reflection
Of death on earth
We're the expression
Of hate and rebirth

The death incarnate
Massacra
The gods of hate
We are

You've yielded to temptation the evil
Now "peace and love" is just a utopia
It's hell on earth and each man is the devil
That's why we are massacra

The death incarnate
Massacra
The gods of hate
We are
