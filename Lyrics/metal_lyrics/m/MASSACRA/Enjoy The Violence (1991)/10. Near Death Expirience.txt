I've had a sensation
Of leaving my body
I felt death's attraction
It was waiting for me

In death agony
Near death expirience

Drawn into a tuunel
I've heard awful moanings
I thought I was in hell
Cries, screams and demoniac wailings

At death's door
Near death expirience

I saw a bright light
In black door
I saw my past life
Screaming in horror

Shock/Desperate struggle
Fight against my life
Back into the tunnel
I've heard my lies
Out of my body
Near death expirience

With all my strenght of will
I've regained consciousness
It gave me quite a thrill
I escaped from the nothingness

Realm of death
Near death expirience
