Your end is near

Death to the traitor
Prepare
To die soon
There is no place
For you and your kind
It's to late
To regret

I wanna take revenge
On you for what you've done
I'm gonna take vengeance
Then justice will be done

You'll pay for this
Sooner or later
Don't forget
I'll get you
Don't try to hide
There is no escape
It's too late
You nust die

Bastard it will cost you your life
You wiill die a violent death
I will put an end to your life
Tourture and slow acting death
It's useless to protect yourself
And don't try to hide
Determined to avenge numbered
I'm full of hatred

Your end is near
Death to the traitor
Prepare
To die soon
There is no place
For you and your kind
It's too late
To regret

I wanna take revenge
On you for what you have done
I'm gonna take vengeance
Then justice will be done

You have not much longer to live
You'll receive your punishment
You have no alternative
It will be your last judgement
