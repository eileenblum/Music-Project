They are fallen naked virgins
They are lusting to my ancient blood
Waits my coming to suck my hands
Surround my body influence them sexual lust

Changes them filthy instincts
Competition on my bloody kiss
Inside my dark castle
Towards the full moon light
Iâm searching for my source
Of them bleeding blood 
Here my lost mask
Of my silent death operation

They smell my blood
From my hands
They want to become
Immortal bodies 

My filthy time inside my tomb
Sleeping with my lusty virgin
She looking to my Serpentine eyes
She love to let me suck her bloody breast

She smell my dark blood
From my filthy hands
She want to become
The queen of Immortal bodies
