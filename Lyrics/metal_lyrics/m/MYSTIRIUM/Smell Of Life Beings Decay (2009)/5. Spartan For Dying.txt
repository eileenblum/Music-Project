Questing
For mines
Spartan
For dying

For my days
Inside
My gusted Darks
All days for
Drinkingâ¦. blood
Hiding from the sun
Far away
To the northern darks

To the wolves caves

Sharing them brutal

To the best bloody feeling

Of ancient vampires leaders

For my hatred
For my pain
For my virgins
They need my blood

For
The lust of the immortal
To
Find the flavor
Of
Sexual kiss
Inside
The hall of the doom
Of
The kings of the vampires
For
Them bloody lust

Leave me 
With my forest
To find my dark power
To get my secret magic
Of my roots

Here my dark crows
Listen to my deep voice
Need to my bloody hand
To suck my blood

Iâm ready to chosen virgins
Need to my bloody lips
Inside my dark castle
The hall of sexual lust

Questing
For mines
Spartan
For dying
