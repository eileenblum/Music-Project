Towards my opinion
Of vital evacuation
The necessary of eternal
To another section
Of the coldest earth 
Ignoring for every thing

This is my decision
No one can affect on me
There is no human
Can stopping my eternal
Of my bloody need
Depiction Of reality
Inside my mind
It is another side of my try

From my land, I feel the darkness shadows
I lust to the doom of my abandoned lost castle

Inside my tomb, my blood is cold
My mind still searching
To reach the dark horizon 

Iâm thinking all the time
My body need to blood
Iâm afraid of my weakness
If there is no source
Of my body lust
To my virgins blood
I must use my magic
To reach my dark path

Towards- my path- I fight 
With my bloody sword

My hands- with magic-
Of the death- to let them decay

My blood increase- 
Towards my eternal- empty darkness land
By drinking my enemy bloodâs

From my land, I feel the darkness shadows
I lust to the doom of my abandoned lost castle

Inside my tomb, my blood is cold
My mind still searching
To reach the dark horizon 
Iâm thinking all the time
My body need to my virgins blood

From lifeless land, I feel the dark
I lust to the doom of my abandoned castle

Of my abandoned lost castle
