Noisy world
Some day we will see 
The end of filthy world
The world of sexual lust
No one need to 
Attend to the filthy earth
Every one keep
His won golden treasure
To his future

Here the fragments of the wind
That smashing the enemy heads
We still need to our power
Of the magical cosmic hills

Here my warriors
Take my orders
To element them huge dark castle
Of the cannibals â¦ OH

Burn the dead
Filthy beings
Surround them forest
Burn them bodies

Now we out of terms
That should control this earth
We have to take our weapons to kill
They are a lot of undead surround them trees 
We plash them our blood
From our mouth

To control them minds from them bloody lust 
They are lifeless dead Stained
With epizootic blood

To control them minds from them bloody lust 
They are lifeless dead Stained
With epizootic blood

[Solo]

They are stained with epizootic blood
They are stained with epizootic blood
