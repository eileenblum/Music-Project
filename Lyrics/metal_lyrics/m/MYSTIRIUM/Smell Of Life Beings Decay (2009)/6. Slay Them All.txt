War
See them dithering from them caves
No one help them from them filth
An Beastly nature control them instinct 
Them deadly minds... them darkness night

War of hate
Control them minds
Toward them lust
Filthy dead
Everywhere
Them vital aliment

Screams of pain
From them bodies
Increase them lust
Of lifeless gore
Towards the blood
Of sickness war 

Feel them lust
To darkness blood
And septic flesh
From them hunger
Lost them minds
With septic bodies!!

Searching hard for a sickness dead
Eating dead with a hopeless lust
Ignore them self to the immortal life
Death and flesh to reach them life

We have to destroy and Erase them all 
The army of vampires ready to them death
We have to crushing and slay them all
We need to control domination of this earth
