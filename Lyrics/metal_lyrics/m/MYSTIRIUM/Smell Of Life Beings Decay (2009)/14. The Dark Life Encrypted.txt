Dark and fear inside my crows
The war is coming there will be gores
My sword will be ready for my land enemyâs
My forces be ready for my bloody orders
The dark is our path
For our need
The blood is our power 
The secret of my darkness creed

My darkness crows searching for blood
They gave our power we need them dark
Our enemy knows we have them secrets
To reach our source of the bloody war

We come out from our caves
With our bodies to drink them blood
Our teeth are ready to suck those necks
Our speed performance
To reach them death
Every one of them, bleeding with his blood
We need them dark, to increase our filth
We smashing them bones, to erase those bodies
We come out for them filthy blood
Our life is dark with our hands
That crashing the bodies
Of the filthy enemies

They come for them death
With our dark life encrypted

Dark and fear inside my crows
The war is coming there will be gores
