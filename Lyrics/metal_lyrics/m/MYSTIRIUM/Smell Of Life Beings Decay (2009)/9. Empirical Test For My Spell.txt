This is my ways
To let you Obey
For my oblivion

Inside my room
The secret doom
Of my dark

Empirical test
For my spell
To find my power

Here my choice
To make you feel
The immortal life

You are now 
Inside my circle
Of the addiction

Smell my blood
Tracking me
To suck my hand!

We have now
The new guest
To our world

Chose your virgin
Enjoy her lips
Suck her neck

You have to learn
The spell of the paster

Inside my dark
You see them path

Traveling by wind
To feel our freedom

You can't feel the time
Your life without end

You live to die
Your home is your tomb!

Amusing your life
With lifeless virgins

You have empirical test for my spell
You canât ignore my empirical test 
You need to empirical test for my spell
You have empirical test for my spell
for my spell
