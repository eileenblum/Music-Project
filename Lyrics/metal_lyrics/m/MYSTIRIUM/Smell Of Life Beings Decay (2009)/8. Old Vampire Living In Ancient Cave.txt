Beside
Lifeless land
Inside the dark

I used 
To drink blood
From any one

My life
Full of pain
With deadly sense

I need 
Dead bodies
For my meals

Every day I ask my self
What is this means?

Spend my time
In Lifeless land
Without my dreams

Every thing seem silent
Without any life
All the time Iâm dead
I can't feel my time

From the ancient walls
Inside my darkness cave
There are more of lusty wolves
Listening to my painless Brutal

Far away from the sun
Towards black doom

I can find myself
With my darkness crows

In my darkness cave 
From my scream
I can feel my pain
To feel my dreams

From the ancient walls
Inside my darkness cave
There are more of lusty wolves
Listening to my painless Brutal

Searching everywhere
Without any hope
My brutal comes out
I lust for blood

Searching everywhere
Without any hope
My brutal comes out
I lust for blood
