Sadden beyond
What worth my land
You can't ignore
My dominance

That was my choice 
Raise my sign
The sign of dark
Of pentagrams

We have to judging 
Every one here
We can lose them 
Every thing real

Sign of the death 
For every one
Who didnât accept?
Our bloody lust

Here my ways of real visions
Control them mindâs with my blood
Let them feel with my doom
They used to tasting my blood

The Captives virgins 
Inside my court
The hall of doom
To choosing them way

Obeying my lust
Drink my blood
To the immortal life
to my sexual lusts

Captives of the bloody war
Inside my court
The hall of doom
To choosing them way

The Captives gothic virgins 
Inside my room
Waits my coming
To suck my hand
