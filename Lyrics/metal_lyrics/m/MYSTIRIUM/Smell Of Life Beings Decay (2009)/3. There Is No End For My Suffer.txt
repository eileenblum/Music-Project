Despair and dark
All my need to my loneliness

Inside my cave
I can acclimate with my pain

Endless life without taste
My old blood need to refresh
I searching for bloody life
Screams and the hugs to the chosen virgins will comes

There is No end for my suffer
My chosen life for dark blood
I'm waiting the lusty virgins haggard
For my endless reason filth

Without screams my life is low
Nothing like them lovely brows
I love them face while them need 
To my tasty blood

I calling them by my mind
Inside my tomb they found my hand
Screams and the hugs to suck my blood
For my wake return

There is No end for my suffer
My chosen life for dark 
I'm waiting the lusty virgins 
For my endless reason filth

Inside my cave my virgins transform
to the new modern lusty vampires 
Screams and the hugs to suck my blood
For my wake return
