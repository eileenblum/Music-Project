Remember the time that we spend together
In the land of dark that we was suffer
Front of the old trees
I kiss and hug my witches frees
From ancient years, I wait your warm tears
That when it's run on my face
I feel in the forsaken land with ice
All the time I need your lips to kiss and drink blood rips
I can't feel the time while I kiss you in the dark line
In the wood of eve I request the old save
Of the magical words that I can deal with slayer lords
Let's play the witches game on
The pentagram that we kill without shame
( Give me more feeling of death .... I need to kill and fucking in filth )
When you will be with meâ¦.
I forget everything except your cold knee
Under the line of the death fire
I send to my princess my all layer
Days that we suffering from the ourselves faults
We crying and screaming to our pain that we brutes
There is no way to choose our endless
Except the loneliest that we have to lifeless
If you are ready to get the golden body
Enter in to the Babylon gate in Abortion day
( Give me more feeling of death .... I need to kill and fucking in filth )
The Hate is our symbol to element our herbal
There is no way to choose our endless
Except the loneliest that we have to lifeless
If you are ready to get the golden body
Enter in to the Babylon gate in Abortion day
( Give me more feeling of death .... I need to kill and fucking in filth )
with her body I get out of my pain that I feel all the day
Under the line of the death fire
I send to my princess my all layer
Days that we suffering from the ourselves faults
We crying and screaming to our pain that we brutes
