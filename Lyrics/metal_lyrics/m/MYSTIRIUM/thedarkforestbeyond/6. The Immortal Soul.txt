Horus can you find me I m here
Standing on my Black stone
Whiting the last black crows
I need the darkness surround them eyes
To let me exist to the immortality Quitted life
Your enigma line is my bloody shadow
Let me see how many dead killed by the Pharaohs
I'm still need your victim's blood to drink
I'm here Waiting you to gave me the life key ring
Take me from the forsaken land
To the eternal black funeral sand
Walking to the ancient desert to
Riche your darkness tomb
While I m enjoying with the children mummy's storm
All the time I see the Memphis face shadow
She want my filthy hand to refresh her old bronze body
From many years ago she need
A dead frozen heart For Her immortal soul
No one can keep her darkness Secrets
Except the loneliest souls
I heard her spill voice tell me to give her the power of the dark
That she can spend a thousand years in her tomb fork
Horus can you find me I m here from the land of Pharaohs
Searching for your tomb
Between the old ancient pyramids
Souls of the sun stopped my dark
No one of the old slaves can fight hard
I send my last dark to my golden queen
Horus listens to his order to take me to her sin

[Solo]

From the gloomy entrance I kissed her hand
It's like bloody old scan of the mummy sands
We slept together in the same ancient tomb
While the evil looking for her darkness soul
I smell the cats blood come from the secrets doors
I asked her to let me drink some of what she gorse
Pharaohs scream from the deferent tomb
While I m hugging the queen of the comb
No one can take me from her golden lips
Except my crows if thy need try her blood test
She's my ancient queen .... I love her old darkness pain
