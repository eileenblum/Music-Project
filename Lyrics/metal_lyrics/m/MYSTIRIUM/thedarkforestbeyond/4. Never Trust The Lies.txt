No one can changes my mind
Even if he try to eaten my brain
Did you trust my lies?
I'm here without my belial wood
Standing on the pentagrams roots
Do you want share me the drunk
There's more blood inside this old eve tank
You will find it lick the old blood taste
Let's drunk the last glass of virgins dead
Inside my mind there's strange feeling
Some thing like morbid killing
I will never stop my mind of what I need
Even if you tray to eaten my brain
Did you trust my lies?
Can you take me to the land of warrior?
To enjoying with kill and smashing the heads
All the blood inside change my creed
I'm looking for the craws to be warm with theme
When you find me cry that mean I lost my soul
To make me right take me to the silent hole
No one can bring me the light again
There's only dark with losing and a lot of Pain

[Solo]

I need to meet my lovely dead skin
While I turn off her cloth I return back my darkness soul
Feel that I did a wrong thing that makes me
in a forsaken land I need to live-in in all my life
Did you ever meet a madness savage assassin?
Listening to the brutal voice lick the main of losing
That I can feel the crow's soul in mine
I Can't gate out of my fault Pain
Setting on my death throne
while I m watching the hill forest surround me
Asking my self why I did this fault all the time?
Let me listen to the brutal inside me
The Hate is my symbol in a dark life 
stay in this ugly gloomy land
These my real enjoying time
Let me stay in this gloomy land
screams of dead coming from the forest of hate
