Walking in to the forest between the
Highest trees ... no one can watch
Me while I hugging the reptile queen
I need to your hair and the diamond
In your eyes, but your kingdom
Is too Far from my caves
I want reach you before
the creations of the Existence
Nocturnal Forest Breathe deep their children
Them Desires burned while Judgments
As succubus slaves from the bloodless stars in the skies
Darkness ... my promised fever
When the silent snow glistens
deep her immortal necromantic soul
The dead pleasured speak to her ancient tongue
Masturbating in her darkness grave
Towards the castle send her soul Vampiric Evil
her Dark angels tasted my tears sacrifice my dead heart echoes
Throw the wild gates unmasks her face born blood on stone
Our voices are opened graves while she's alone
Can't escape from thy darken souls
Behold your dark beauty of thy stirs conquer us
To the forsaken morbid road
She will come for me to erase my root
Take me to the eternal limp life
with her bloody darken wings
While she put her black lips on my skin
My dark blood comes through my hand
Inside the queen coffin we playing the Belial game
The funeral ceremony to the Satan virginâs servant again
No one see my bloody rooms
The beauty faces from the smell To crashing bones
Hang them self with lisping kissing
Them black lips running blood with vesting
Having sex inside my rooms
I'm waiting you to smell your bones
Have you ever tray my knife
Cutting Organs smashing Unsaved
I need your filthy hands Touching me all the time
To feel the sins of your fantasy worm inside
Open your filthy doors to my fork hurt
And let me enter your darken love Art
Find your secret atom harmony
And lave me die on your lovely red body
We will listen to the magical death tones
While I hugging you inside your secret rooms
All the time I looking to your sparkle eyes
That makes me ignore the victims scream's outside
