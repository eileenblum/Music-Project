Beneath the bloody cover I wake up from the virginsâ sexual lust
I canât wait under the dark while Iâm alone
I need to the virgins dark lips to kiss

Inside my hurt I have the lust to the blood and wine
Iâm in the coldest land
There is no one just my darkness crows
Iâm waiting to see the bodies
Of filthy virgins of the silent moon

The virginâs blood
Is dark now
Thy need to my
Suffering screams

I have to call
The lusty souls
To my dark
To spill them hurts

I need to
Suffering screams
The filthy witches
Spill them tears
