From them darkness past and them demonic passion
Thy have to live in lofty buildings with strong pillars
Thy need to strong power to dealing with enemyâs anger
Sending the fear from them bloody warning
Abundant rains and insolent winds from them land
Dark deserts keep them castles with forsaken Impression
Black magic from the gardens of (Iram)
It was them fictional paradise to live in all the time

It was the city of the dark forests between the mountains of the strong pillars
From the red sky above them castles the huge dragons use those fires
But no one of them can resist the son Of (AD) swords
The swords of thunder attack the dragons to drop them in the dark rivers

It was the city of the dark forests between the mountains of the strong pillars

The women of Babylon slaves inside the gate of (AD)
Thy need to them perfect bodies to spelling them minds from them ayes

The women of Babylon slaves inside the gate of (AD)
Thereâs no way from them spell thy have the power of them beauty
From the (AD) gates the screams of the virgins in aspects the deserts
Thy used to virginâs perfect bodies for them hugs and bloody lust
It was the city of the dark forests between the mountains of the strong pillars
