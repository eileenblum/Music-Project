They are some victims
Inside the world of zombies
Thereâs no one to help
Just if you are one of the old enemies

We are the old vampireâs warriors
From the darkness side of the bloody world

That we came to destroy the humanâs deadly enemy
Inside the land of the sickness deadly darkness souls

We found some deadly humans
Inside a filthy old graveyard
They begun to be a deadly corpse
While our swordâs ready to kill them

They will transfer to filthy zombies
Inside the old filthy tombs

While the trees become no leaves
They are ready to fight our darkness horses

We have the power of the old magic
That can element them filthy lands
They will send them deadly forces
While the night elves ready to fight us

We need to save the humanâs bodies
To keep them fresh blood
We have to keep them bodies out of any filthy injections

We will send our dark crows
To theme deadly wicked bodyâs
We will send the call of chaos
To destroy the land of the enemies
