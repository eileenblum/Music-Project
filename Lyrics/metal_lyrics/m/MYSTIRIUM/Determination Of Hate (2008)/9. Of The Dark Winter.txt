Here I can cry without any pain
Inside the forest of cold and dark
I hear the Howling of wolves in the sky
I see the moon light sparkle inside

[Speech:]
Iâm going away
To the land of lifeless
I feel with lust
To the blood and darkness
I follow the moon light
To arrives to the wolvesâ bloody fight
Of the dark winter

Here I can cry without any pain
Inside the forest of cold and dark
I hear the Howling of wolves in the sky
I see the moon light sparkle inside

Of the dark winter
Of the dark winter
Of the dark winter
