Here my forsaken path
To forget every thing
Inside my mind

I left my life
Of people's hate
I used to suffer
That make a dead

From along time - I left - every thing
I feel lose - except - my suffering
Ignore the life - that make me feel
With full of pain - my faults is real

Dark forsaken is what I need
With darken crows that I want live

(I hate every thing even if my self)
My decide is to leave the human kind life

To the forsaken path
To the forsaken path
