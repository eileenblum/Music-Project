[Speech:]
Iâm here in the dark forest
Searching for some one
To share me my dark inside

Here my true life
Of my sunset
Sunset to the dark
To find my loneliest

Here my torture
Of my blames
Here my suffer
From my pains

I hiding in the dark
From my self

Ignore my life
To find myself

[Solo]

I lost my gate
Of the eternity

Nothing I have
Except my legacy

I lost my gate
Of my eternity

Nothing I have
Except my legacy â my legacy

My resorting to the dark
Is my legacy

To imagine the sky
My special world

Iâm here at the dark shadow of the sunset
