Burn what all inside this temple
We have our demonic bath

From the ancient stones at the valley of death
They lived in a land of mountains and rocks of the heights arid desert
It was (Wadi-al-qura) the land of creed
Civilized darkness life for the battle of filth and torture the slaves

Between the land of the abundant
Flood lethal destruction

Grandiose high cities had a darkness guard
Huge dragons riding and fight
They was most ancient of people
With them strong bodies to cutting the rocks
To making safe houses for them women
Was lived with pleasure enjoying those hugs
Inside the hall of the ancient slaves blood
They used them darkness methods
To the salves of the lifeless deserts

Inside the ancient castles preparation the art of dark
To let them control with the Babylon womenâs slaves
They have the rolls of death
To make them power at the aim of them filth
They slay every one who didnât obey them rolls
Every one was suffered In to The Valley Of Thamood

Calls of the wind come from deserts of death
No one of them care about the calls of the slaves
Profligate women inside the gates surrounding with huge bodies
