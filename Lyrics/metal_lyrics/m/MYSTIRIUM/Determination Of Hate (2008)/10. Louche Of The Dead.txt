Iâm searching you in the sky
I need your souls to let me try
Flying with you every where
Your ancient path is my way

I need your bodies beside me
I need your wings fly over me
I need to feel your freedom life
My life is nothing without your black faces

I can feel the mean of the true dark
I can feel your need to my suffer
Itâs the meaning for your haggard
Iâm waiting you in my dark forest
Join with me my loneliness worst
My path with you ignoring the others
Itâs the meaning your darkness careers
To let me know your different alerts
Let me listen to your hinders voices
To let me gathered my darkness power
Iâm going to your bare trees
To setting there all my loneliest days

I feel your coming to share my suffer
Inside my dark ignoring the others
Fly over me
Standing on my tied
Surround my body your souls feel with my dark

Iâm looking all the time to the cold lack
To feel the cold inside and the bloody fake
I feel with cold of my white hands
They lust to the blood of my ancient land

Iâm looking to them bare trees
To feel my filthy bloody nails
Thereâs nothing better than my dark
To find my self with my darkness crows

Louche of the dead from thousands years
Itâs an abandoned land between the trees
Crows of death fly over me
Standing on my body surround of me
I need your souls in my dark
To feel my suffer all my time
Crows of death inside my body
Control my mind to the darkness path

Flying over me surround my body
Your darkness path my ancient glory
You are my symbol of wisdom
Your souls is my immortal life

I can feel the mean of the true dark
I can feel your need to my suffer
Itâs the meaning for your haggard
Iâm waiting you in my dark forest
Join with me my loneliness worst
My path with you ignoring the others
Itâs the meaning your darkness careers
To let me know your different alerts

[Speech:]
Now I feel my life
With them darkness bodies
Listening to them hinders voices
Crows of death standing on the bare trees
Surrounding the bloody forsaken darkness breed
Louche of the dead from thousands years
Itâs an abandoned land between the trees
