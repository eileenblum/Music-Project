Thereâs away to my loneliest
Very far from the others
I need to find my secrets
From my darkness suffer inside
I canât live in vortex
While the others stare in me
I m going to my path
To the real nature and real facts

I can feel my need to the sound
Of fugitive wind
I heard my sorrow -inside me
Through contemplations of wood
I found my self inside
An ancient darkness cave

I sat between the walls
Thinks about my place
I found my self dreamt
With the darkness ancient years
Of the people who was lived
Inside my darkness cave
What the suffer thy was been
Indifference life thy was creed

Empty neglected ancient land
Thatâs my comfort source
Now I feel my self inside
From my cave of fires light
I want to spend my life here
Nothing disturbs my clarity

I sat between the walls thinks
About my place I found my self
Dreamt with the darkness ancient years
Of the people who was lived inside
My darkness empty depressing cave
What the suffer thy was been
Indifference life thy was creed
From them darkness ancient years

I can feel my need to the sound
Of fugitive wind
I heard my sorrow -inside me
Through contemplations of wood
I found my self inside
An ancient darkness cave
I need nothing inside my head
Just the sound of natural dark wood
Leave me suffer inside my dark
I like my vestigial ancient depressing land

Inside the dark cave of sorrow
