I'm here alone without my beauty face
I need to suck her lips I lust to the bloody days

I feel the cold inside my lifeless old bones
I'm waiting for the screams of bloody stones

Iâm here waiting the virgins to save me from
My loneliest lifeless inside my freezing pain's

But no one care about what I need
There's only a way to my lonely bloody creed

To my lonely bloody creed

To my lonely bloody creed

Through the bloody doom land I walked
Searching for my princess
I need her eyes
To feel my own reflection
Of the moonlight sense
On her darkness body
That makes me frozen, cold as ice

From her screams of pain I heard
The gloomy black heart voice
A colorless cascade of her face

The darkness castle doom inside
With virgins suffer of lusting blood
Sucking them hands inside my room

I'm leaving the priding life
Of the human hopeless life
To the eternal filthy land

I'm search for the doom
In the night of the full moon

When I heard the crows
Thy need to my darkness inside

Thy know I m alone
Thy need to my lifeless path

I'm lusty all the time with my virgins hands
I donât need any thing except my bloody land

I used to filthy life to let me find the blood
In the land of suffer the secrets of my roots

The filthy lusty virgins find my darkness path
Thy surround my body to suck my ancient hands
I feel now with power of bloody eternal life

While I m sucking her frozen nick
Her eyes burning bright
That I can't control my head
She now suffer die

She now suffer die
She now suffer die
She now suffer die

Vampiresâ virgins inside my land
Them filthy bodes need to my bloody hands

Imagine the day when you play with navigation hunter
Its will flay with you to the eternal empty gander
