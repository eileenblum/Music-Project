From the dark  - I was live
I find my heart - Which I save 

My secret love - Between the dark
No one feel - My witchâs lark

I need smell - her black heart
While I listen her classic harp

Every time â I need her hand
Touch my face- touch my sand

Let the moon â gives you light
To see your red hair â to feel your sight

We are alone â in the dark
We can loath â kiss and hug

Between the trees â I heard the crows
Need my secrets â thy need my rose

I love them voice â in the dark  
Gave me the death sense â filthy heart
