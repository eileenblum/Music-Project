(Suffering - of the black doom ramble)
Inside - Interior of the great temple 

Every day you can see
How they suffer from last years

You can touch - vestigial stone
Old bronze body â with ancient bones

I need my â desert queen
Detection symptom on her green

Her green body with pharos stamps
No one suffer like her soul ramp

(Suffering - of the black doom ramble)
Inside - Interior of the great temple 

Every day you can see
How they suffer from last years

You can touch - vestigial stone
Old bronze body â with ancient bones

Her green body with pharos stamps
No one suffer like her soul ramp

Inside her darkness tomb I saw her secret body
Itâs an golden sparkle makes me all of logy

While you enter darkness hall
Fear with horror statues all

I need my old bronze queen
To rest with her pharos tomb preen 

(Suffering - of the black doom ramble)
Inside - Interior of the great temple 

I like old aftermath sense
To increase my gothic land chance

Have you enter the pharos room
While you hanging the secret mummyâs doom 

Open the bloody oblivion marsh
To now how many killed from virgins arch
