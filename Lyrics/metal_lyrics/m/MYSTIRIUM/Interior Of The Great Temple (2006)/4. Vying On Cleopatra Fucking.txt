Inside the saffronâs gate 
Over naked servant dead
She sleep-in bloody bed
Her death guard looking for a head

She still love motion of snakes
In order to gat her dates
I love her old death sense
In the night shadow while she spend

(You can share me on my paragon of hating)
They Vying on Cleopatra fucking
You can share me on my paragon of hating

Have you ever got her gate?
Itâs a golden secret with bloody paint
I try to element her guards
No on can take her ward

(You can share me on my paragon of hating)
They Vying on Cleopatra fucking

She needs to enjoy with dark
But no one now her death lark
When darkness come with filth
Every one can share me her birth

That when you touch her body
Element all suffering cloudy
Monsters come with the kings
To searching for her rings

(You can share me on my paragon of hating)
They Vying on Cleopatra fucking
You can share me on my paragon of hating

Have you ever got her gate?
Itâs a golden secret with bloody paint
I try to element her guards
No on can take her ward

(You can share me the paragon hating)
They Vying on Cleopatra fucking
