I now how long
You wait your life

Get forsaken
Suicide by knife

I want death

From my loneliness
I have mistake

From my darkness
I fight my fear

No one lose
Inside the dark

I want death

I want death

I lost my life
With virgins filth

I live to dead
I want the death

[Solo]

Every night
Ask my self

Why you found of
Some virgins dead

I donât need more
Any kind of life

I need forsaken
Just let me die

My people left
With a silent dreams

I can enjoy
With a virgins screams

I want death

[Solo]
