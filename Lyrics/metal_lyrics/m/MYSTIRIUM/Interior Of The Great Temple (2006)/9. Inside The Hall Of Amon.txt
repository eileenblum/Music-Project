In the land of desert
Front of darkness temple

I heard the signal tyrant
The secret of dark Angel

The old man who was farm
Alert me that they come

All they need to his die
To change his religion lie
Thy donât care if he will die

I walked to the golden pyramid
Ask my king if he shocked heed

All they need to his die
To change his religion lie
Thy donât care if he will die

I canât let him alone
While his army is gone

Every one refuse
There is no time to lose

His People burn in fire
The lands destroy and tire

I face my enemy while Iâm alone
( I try ever beat them inside the hall of Amon )
