You with me
Handle free

No one can
Stop my lain

Thereâs a fire
On the mountain higher

Filthy room
I need my last virgin doom

Let me stay - with you now
I tell you some thing - about your die

Have you play -   play with me
Final dark - extension be

Darkness, fire - my witches, tired

I canât stay 
Far than you - to make me high
From darkness vamp
I find my secret - My beauty black tomb

I hold your body -   like a mindless lover
Your deadly body â my final graver 

Have you play -   play with me
The Final dark - extension be

Let me stay - with you now
I tell you some thing - about your die

From the darkness deadly vamp
I find my secret - My beauty black tomb
