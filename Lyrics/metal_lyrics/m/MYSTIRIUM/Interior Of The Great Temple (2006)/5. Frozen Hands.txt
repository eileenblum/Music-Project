Since I saw my last dark night
It was like nightmare
Sense of death is what I need to end my life
Through my frightens .... I lost my self  
In the dark forest beyond 
Through the raven mountains 
They searching for my cave own

(No one know about her frozen hands)
While touching me I feel snow-covered rains
While she get path of victory with hate

Ask my self.... if I can escape  
From thy order.... to Change my way
I want reach the River of bloody Tears 
Oh...My last dark night is near!!

(No one know about her frozen hands)
While touching me I feel snow-covered rains
While she get path of victory with hate

I still walking to the eternal night
Towards the Castle of the Black sight
I flew away with her beauty
In to the silent darkness gloomy 

(No one know about her frozen hands)
While touching me I feel snow-covered rains
While she get path of victory with hate

I find my body without Pain inside
While my heart burning from her dragons light 
Inside the evil eyes which burning
With triumph and glory night

(No one know about her frozen hands)
