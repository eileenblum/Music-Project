Every time - every place - I searching for - another face
Do you need - another life - do you want - change your mind

Fuck this world

Darkness - turn me to hate my self
Loneliness - let me erase my head
Lifeless - my secret way to the dead
I want to leave - to another world

I can hear - virgins grisly tears
Inside the doom - they need my filthy room
Let them see â inside my graveyard dread 
Taste them blood â enjoy with sense of drunk

You can feel dark with hate face
You can share filth and hugs in the bloody place

I m leave to another world
I believe in the Existent world
