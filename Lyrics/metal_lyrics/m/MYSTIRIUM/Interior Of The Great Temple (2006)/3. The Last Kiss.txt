Suitable Quiet in the fog
While I hug my lonely shog
If you know how she was suffer
You will kiss her to break her buffer
She is my beauty in the fog
Lonely nights to riddance my slog
Searching for phantom face
I need to the last kiss to kill my pain

Walk with me donât be worry 
I need your magical regular body
Imagine your darkness sparkle hair 
I need to kiss you while you fear

She is my beauty in the fog
Lonely nights to riddance my slog

I need the last kiss 

Walk with me donât be worry 
I need your magical regular body
Imagine your darkness sparkle hair 
I need to kiss you while you fear

I know how you was suffer
You selling me to break my buffer
Searching for my phantom face
You need my body to kill your pain
Imagine my darkness hair 
You need to kiss me while my fear
You selling me to get my blood
You selling me to kiss my flood  

Starving , suffering
Lifeless , loneliest 
I need your blood , get me ramp
I need you with me in my tomb
