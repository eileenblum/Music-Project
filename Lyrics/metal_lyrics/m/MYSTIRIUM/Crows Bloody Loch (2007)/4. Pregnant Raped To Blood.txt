From this forest
I feel them lust
To the endless suffer
To the victims blood
They are feel with someone - walking on the road
They are breath the smell of a women â like the bloody explode
Now its the time 
To refresh them bones
They are five
In the darkness road
Waiting victims 
To drink them blood
Any source
To create them power 
Now she is near 
From them dark
She is a pregnant
And no one care
They saw her face
They cant stop them lust
She is a beauty
The Pregnant raped to blood 
She donât have any thing but screams
She cant do any thing but her son tearâs

Through her blood â they ignore them hate
They sucked her blood 
They slay her body to many  pieces
