(Womenâs Blood splashes in to my eyes
Listen to them screams coming from them pains) 
All the bodies color come a dark red
No one can fight thy are bleeding from them nicks
We do every thing with them fresh body 
Enjoy with bloody lust we always ready
Darkness crows surround them body
We spend a bloody time with a cannibal body
Even if my dream become a real
While I drinking the water of them tears
(Womenâs Blood splashes in to my eyes
Listen to them screams coming from them pains)
I heard the tears pain's beyond the filthy walls
While her black lips content all my filthy Rolls
From my Eternal darkness veils I heard
The voice of the moon storm its come a real
I can't feel my existent
While my body
Runs toward her blackest beauty warm
At the Crows bloody loch

[Solo]

She searching for her life path
But she canât stop our bloody Lust
My blackest beauty need more pour
To her Black souls she will suffer

[Speech:]
(With lusting lifeless we ride our dragons
I can't ignore her testy darkness blood
I need to locking to my bats surround them body 
They needs to drink the fresh blood of my vampires princes)
At the Crows bloody loch
