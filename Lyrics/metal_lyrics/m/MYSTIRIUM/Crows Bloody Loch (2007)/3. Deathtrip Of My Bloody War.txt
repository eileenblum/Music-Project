Here my choice
To ride my horse
The horse of war
To the death trip war
To the darkness endless
My secrets rise
I see my victims
Inside my eyes
No one will survive
From my Sword
Drinking them Blood
Burning them Roads
Now my turn to spill them queen
To let her enjoying our bloody meal
I will turn her darkness fear
To be my vampires immortal queen
I will return
To my dark castle
I will be alone
Beside my Princess
She need my blood
Inside my room
She is my Princess
Of my bloody war
Here my choice
To ride my horse
The horse of war
To the death trip war
