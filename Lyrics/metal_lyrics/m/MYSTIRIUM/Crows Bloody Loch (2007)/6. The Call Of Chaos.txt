They are some victims
Inside the world of zombies
Thereâs no one to help
Just if you are one of the old enemies
We are the old vampireâs warriors 
From the darkness side of the bloody world
That we came to destroy the humanâs deadly enemy  
Inside the land of the sickness deadly darkness souls
We found some deadly humans 
Inside a filthy old graveyard
They begun to be a deadly corpse
While our swordâs ready to kill them
They will transfer to filthy zombies 
Inside the old filthy tombs
While the trees become no leaves
They are ready to fight our darkness horses 
We have the power of the old magic
That can element them filthy lands
They will send them deadly forces
While the night elves ready to fight us
We need to save the humanâs bodies
To keep them fresh blood 
We have to keep them bodies out of any filthy injections
We will send our dark crows
To theme deadly wicked bodyâs
We will send the call of chaos 
To destroy the land of the enemies
