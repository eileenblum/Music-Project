Where is my life 
That I Lost
In the Land of hate
That was the war of host
My bloody Enemy
That I used to kill
In the land of  Chaos
That I hate my Unknowing life
Of  losing all the time
In the Vampires  filthy land
( I'm Leaving the priding life
To empty , endless and haggard life )  
From my loneliness
I Heard theme calls
Thy need my darkness
Inside my tomb
Now I have my days
Of loneliness far away
Screaming without my pain
just suffering under the rains
No one can take me from my Eternal
To the vampires bloody life immortal 
I need to my darkness old tomb
To sleep thousand years with bloody corpse
I used to drink theme ancient blood
To feel my sense of them screams and hugs
I'm walking alone to them death valley
While my eternal 
( I'm Leaving the priding life
To empty , endless and haggard life )
