[Music &amp; arrangements: Nirag / Words: Karagat]

A shapeless drawing sight
Drowned within the dying night
View so thick and yet so clear
No human since long lived here
A dagger of flaming ice
Has ripped through the silent skies
And the floor of glass was broken by angels cries

The window crushed behind the light
Dreamlike demons wake
From the sky blood like snowflakes fall
Fundaments of heaven shake

The roaring oceans once furious rose
Now has calmed into bloodseas
And thw winds have since ages silenced their screams
All lies still awaiting

A blinding light of fire raped the silence
Heaven fell aflame through the ground

Begun was the dawn of Satans reign

You were predicted to be slain
In domains by yourself condemned
You were to die by your own creation
That had died one thousand deaths before your birth

Behold your childrens blood paint the new world
A cold mist now drowns the world

New creations are summoned
Followers are Jehova are burning impaled
Antil their ashes are growing again
Only awaiting to burn

You are predicted to die
