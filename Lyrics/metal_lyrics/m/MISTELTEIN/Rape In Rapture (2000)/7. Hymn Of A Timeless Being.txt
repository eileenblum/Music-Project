[Music: Nirag &amp; Nagrinn / Arrangements: Nirag / Words: Karagat]

I
The most ancient of all beings
Before all seven spheres
I alone raised eternity
Created was I in times
Times still not existing
I am the guardian of hells fire
The infernal legions that roam the earth

I am the tales always told
The rage of thunderstorms
Medieval darkness and glory
Ancient rites and sacrifices

Like mist I float throughout the landscapes
Into the mighty forest above the mountains

Like statues standing tall and cold
I watched the rising of christianity
I watched the birth of god
And saw the end

Die

Black death was I, breathing at the earth
Planting my seed, of my own rebirth

I am the tales always told
The rage of thunderstorms
I am before eternal
And I am the flames infernal
I am the suffering always known
The pain of mortal souls
I am darkness eternal
I am the dark lord infernal
