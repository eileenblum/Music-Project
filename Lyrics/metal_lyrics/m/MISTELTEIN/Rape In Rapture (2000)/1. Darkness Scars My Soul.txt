[Music &amp; arrangements: Nirag / Words: Karagat]

Fall of the sulphur night
The sky is set aflame
In distance, I look upon
The dark age
I feel the stars
Burning within my flesh
So must they have done
Who beheld the sulphur fire
My mind flows away
In the void
And darkness scars my soul

I, whos soul burns with a desire of my bloodline's past
Whos suffering will never end

A pain that cannot die
Unless my flesh is dead
Cries without a cause
And darkness scars my soul

I cry out in the empty night
To break the angels heart
I summon winterdemons
Who answered to my calls
A fog of frost is falling
Upon me where I stand
I hear the voices singing
Darkness scars my soul

I yearn for days of frost and of pride but it is not to be found
Searching for the keys of time which do not exist
Even so my desire burns with hate
And darkness scars my soul

Scars which burn with sulphur hatred whos flame never dies
But for each day glows stronger like the stars in the northern sky
And like time they are breathing rising again as one dies
And darkness scars my soul

The ghosts who haunt me are creatures of light
Who scared my bloodline's flesh
The ghost who haunt me are angels of god
Whos son was impaled
The darkness that scars me is not of the night
Nor darkness of hell
The darkness that scars me is no weakness
It is my desire

My desire, my flesh seeks revenge
To hear the angels scream
My desire, I seek revenge
I want to see you die
The keys of time are not to find
So my hate will proceed
My yearning will never end
Because darkness scars my soul...
