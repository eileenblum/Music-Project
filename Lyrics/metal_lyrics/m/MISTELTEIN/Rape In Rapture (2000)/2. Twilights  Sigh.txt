[Music &amp; arrangements: Nirag / Words: Karagat]

I am eternal
On infinity I ride
For I am the unseen
Dressed in a twilight sigh...
I am a vision
A vision to come
I am a secret
Chained by the sun

Behold this endless mournful kiss
A journey through a casket night
Embraced by starless distant dream
Drained by a twilight sigh

I am the dying sunset
I am the twilights' spawn
I am eternal night
I am the sunless dawn

I breath through the lungs of oblivion
Timeless and cold are the arts of mine
I lurk through the dismal everness
Dressed in a twilight sigh...

Enchant me with your sorrows
A thousand tears to come
Bleeding tear of tomorrow
Is falling to the hollow ground

I am the dying sunset
I am the twilights' spawn
I haunt the ever black
For I am the sunless dawn
