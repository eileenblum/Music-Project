[I. The Beginning.]

I stand in the endless twilight
Watching the rising of the moon
The bleeding rays of the sun
Cast on the waters of gloom
And as the landscapes darkens
I behold the beautiful night
Which has moved upon me
And has taken my soul with furious might

[II. The Awakening.]

I stand in the endless night
Watching the opening of the night
And as the forest hall wakens
So does the mountains with a sigh
The silvermoon cast its rays
Upon my darkened soul
As it brings damnation upon us
It is truly all to know

[III. The End.]

I stand in the nevercoming dawn
Watching the death of the sun
The bloodred horizons falling
Starting the light to shun
And as the moon arises
Northern realms have come
All ancient left their sleep
The northern realms have come

[IV. The Funeral.]

Curse my darkened soul
As I enter the gates of hell
Guide me to the eternal tomb
Where the god of light will dwell
Through the cemetary portals
Shall the infernal legions pass
And the northern realms have come
With lights death at last

At last...
