[Music: Nirag &amp; Nagrinn / Lyrics: Karagat]

Hear my call in the darkest night
Hear my desire as I whisper thy name
I can feel thy pulse rising
I hear your heart crying with fear

Pitiful creature shaped in light
You will obey my command
Kneel before me worthless one
And accept my salvation

Stripped, torn I feast upon your naked skin
Your eyes are wandering for answers and I rejoice
My tongue runs areound your naked breasts
And you are frozen with disgust
Poisoned, return to where you once came from
The mystery of birth is too obvious now
Carefully embraced in your mothers arms
Betrayed at the first sight of light

I am the one haunting you when you sleep
Removing all sensed replaced by my lust
You mean nothing to me though I desire you
There is nowhere to be safe, nowhere to run

Disgraced, dressed in white
Your glory is blackened
There is no way out for you
You are mine to abuse with pleasure

Strapped hanged in chains blindfolded
I run the cold knife over your body
Even though the pain is so inhuman
My very presence burns with hellfire

Oh my desired one your flesh is shelving
I can feel your blood boiling with anticipation
So precious I caress thee so gentle
For what harm can one do to you

Disobedience one cannot tolerate you whore
Does one have to punish to reach understanding
Cut off all senses and let the terror begin
For order is vital and pain is the key

Pitiful creature shaped in light
You will obey my command
Kneel before me worthless one
And accept my salvation

Humiliated you turn around
And I pull your head back
Penetrate your bleeding flesh
I cry out my pleasure

Cut open your bare back
I lick your blood streaming
I hack of your blood-drenched wings
Force you to reply

"I desire you too, father"
