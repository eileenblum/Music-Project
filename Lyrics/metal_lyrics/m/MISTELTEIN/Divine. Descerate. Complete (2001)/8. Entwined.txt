[Music: Nirag, Baalzephon &amp; Nagrinn / Lyrics: Karagat]

I drive the black moon rising
My whip is the words that infect your mind
I am the blacksmith who brought you chains
And you begged me to chain you blind

Take these chains - They're truly cold
Given mind sacrifice - Chosen blindfold

You caused yourself your madness
Made yourself so weak
Dreamed of a twisted freedom
Buried so far beneath

Misanthropy - You place the chains that I gave you
So pleased - Exhibit your mind for all to see

Arrangement of the chaos order complete
Entwined within the obscurity elite
Use your own blood, incest
Perversion of anger displacement

Complex being vortex
Lost in angels light

Arrangement of the chaos order complete
Entwined within the obscurity elite
Use your own blood, incest
Perversion of anger displacement

Complex being vortex
Lost in angels light

Refuse to be placed
Fight them till the last drop
And paint your body in their blood

Be the hand of justice
The shadow that fell on me
The salvation poison rain
Why stand with your mouth open wide

And when you speak of your superiority
Why is your tongue green of lies

Complex being vortex
Lost in angels light
Complex being vortex
Lost in angels light

You caused yourself your madness
Made yourself so weak
Dreamed of a twisted freedom
Buried so far beneath

Take these chains - They're truly cold
Given mind sacrifice - Chosen blindfold
