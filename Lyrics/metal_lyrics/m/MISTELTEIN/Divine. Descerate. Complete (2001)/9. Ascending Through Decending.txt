[Music: Mishrack &amp; Nagrinn / Lyrics: Karagat]

Reflection of a mirror image
A twisted view of hate
Travel with infinite speed
A fourth dimension of creation
Deadend doors open wide
A new path behind barriers broken
I lift my hands towards the sky
Heaven tremble by my very touch

See what is that which is not
For this is the key to nothing
The force behind your course
The knife that tears within

Through the timeless spheres
I'll descend in a single day
I know that what is to be found
Is not the salvation of mine

Fist break the concrete wall
A perfect picture of matter
That which is untouched by time
Trapped beyond the halls of pain
A single way to walk
Beside the face of temptation
As I will plunder your mind
You know that you will fall...

Reflection of a mirror image
A twisted view of hate
Travel with infinite speed
A fourth dimension of creation

Feel that which is for sure
For this is the key to all
The embrace that await you
The chains that'll choke you within

Deadend doors open wide
I lift my hands towards the sky
Heaven tremble by my very touch

Through the tunnel of light
I'll ascend in a single laugh
I know that it will be found
In ruins by my hand

Fist break the concrete wall
A perfect picture of matter
That which is untouched by time
Trapped beyond the halls of pain
A single way to walk
Beside the face of temptation
As I will plunder your mind
You know that you will fall...
