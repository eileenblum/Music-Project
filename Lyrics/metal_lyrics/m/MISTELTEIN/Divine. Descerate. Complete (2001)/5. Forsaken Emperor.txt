[Music: Nirag / Lyrics: Karagat]

What is this
What is this you carry inside, my child
Are all these questions without answer
Driving you to proceed with no meaning

Is this stone
This ice-cold stone glowing your heart
Was it taken out still pounding
And twisted by fingers of madness

Understand this
Where you walk there is nothing
You seek a place not existing
Yet you are blinder by anger and fear

Did you bring this upon yourself
Or was the yoke placed on your shoulders
One can not brind oneself into despair

So you have walked
The fields of damnation
This you have and no tears fell
For there are no more to shed
Still you have faced

You have faced your shadows so many times
That contains what you would like to put behind
Shades of black of vast magnitude
In this what builds your walls

Understand this
Where you walk there is nothing
You seek a place not existing
Yet you are blinded by anger and fear

What is it that you demand
All have desires not fulfilled
But where your throne once was empty
An insect took your place

And infected your burning longing
Lost in a desert of nothingness
One can not but dream
That your throne again will be yours to claim

Did you bring this upon yourself
Did you tie your own hands
Did you bring this upon yourself
And placed yourself upon the stake

So you have walked
The fields of damnation
One can not bring oneself into despair

Did you cause this pain
Did you cause these bleeding eyes
Turned away from the laughing truth
Or are you the conqueror
