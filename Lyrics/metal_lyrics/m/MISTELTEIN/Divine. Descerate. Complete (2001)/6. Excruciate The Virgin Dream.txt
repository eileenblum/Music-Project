[Music: Nagrinn &amp; Nirag / Lyrics: Nagrinn]

Shadowdraped by a sunset kiss
The nightmare on seductive wings
Invites to nocturnal carnage
To feed upon angels broken dreams

Dreamwraiths of decievement
Feasts upon the mellow virgins womb
Virgins, mellow virgins
All swallowed by the cataclysm

Sombre lusts awaken to hunger
Dark, depraved, deformed
To drink from the beauty of innocence
And to devour all that's pure

Unsolarize, sodomize
Bloodrivers through the heavens stream
Rape the weak, within their sleep
Excruciate the virgin
Excruciate the virgin dream

Dreamwraiths of decievement
Feasts upon the mellow virgins womb
Virgins, mellow virgins
All swallowed by the cataclysm

Sombre lusts awaken to hunger
Dark, depraved, deformed
To drink from the beauty of innocence
And to devour all that's pure

Sacred limbs incinerated
Before the eyes of the holy one
Garden of Eden defiled
Sterilized by demon tongues

Angels forced to fornicate
Revealing the darkest fantasies
Beholding the ravenous lust of pain
Through their very own tormented eyes

Unsolarize, sodomize
Bloodrivers through the heavens stream
Rape the weak, within their sleep
Excruciate the virgin
Excruciate the virgin dream

Sacred limbs incinerated
Before the eyes of the holy one
Garden of Eden defiled
Sterilized by demon tongues

Angels forced to fornicate
Revealing the darkest fantasies
Beholding the ravenous lust of pain
Through their very own tormented eyes
