[Music: Nirag &amp; Karagat / Lyrics: Karagat]

Taste the bittersweet hatred
That I place on your tongue
For what are you not in my hands
But a statue for me to create

I will be the flies
The flies that infect you
Decompose your binding flesh
For you to bear the aura of death

Take a look around
And see all the mistakes you have done
Your guilt will follow in your footsteps
Keep you from restoring peace of mind

Wherever you will walk
It will be with the wind in your face
Raped by the blazing darkness
Raped towards infinite holocaust

Now reach for your dagger
And drive it through their hearts
For this pounding piece of flesh
Is the one thing you do not possess

So let the blade be your soul
And may it be a great prophet
Hear the voice of salvation
And tell their hearts of it

Taste the bittersweet hatred
That I place on your tongue
For what are you not in my hands
But a statue for me to create

Take a look around
And see all the mistakes you have done
Your guilt will follow in your footsteps
Keep you from restoring peace of mind

When you stand there alone
With all the dying bodies around you
You will see their questions
In their eyes before they die

As you are the one left
Let your laughter roll
And for once feel complete satisfaction
Before you slice the knife through yourself
