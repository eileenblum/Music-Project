[Music: Nirag &amp; Nagrinn / Lyrics: Nagrinn]

My presence like a serpent
As a shadow closing in
Your existence a mere memory
To the obscurity I inflict upon you

Arise in ineffable disgust
From the fiery ashes of the extinguished sun
The masses of sacred flesh twisting
As they revel in demon cum

Death complete me
No longer enslaved
Madness be my guide
Into carnal pleasures depraved

Gentle touch sweet demon caress
To encourage the buried desire
"I spoke with a serpents tongue
When fellatio silenced the angel choir"

Temptation complete
Raped through deceit
Gentle demon caress
Defiling the virgin flesh

Cursed by the enigma
Poisoned be my word
Dethrone all will
Lust into oblivion

Beauty of monstrosity
Breeding damnation
Raped and devoured
Dethrone the creation

My presence like a serpent
As a shadow closing in
Your existence a mere memory
To the obscurity I inflict upon you

Damnation

Gentle touch sweet demon caress
To encourage the buried desire
"I spoke with a serpents tongue
When fellatio silenced the angel choir"

Death
No longer enslaved
Madness be my guide

Beauty of monstrosity
Breeding damnation
Raped and devoured
Dethrone the creation
