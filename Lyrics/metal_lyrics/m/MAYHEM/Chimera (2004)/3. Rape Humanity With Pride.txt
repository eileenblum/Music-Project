Inside a mind so deranged, how I wish you all were dead,
Annoying humanity sickens me, I contemplate your extinction,
The beast I caress you never see, everyday I destroy your lives,
Inside my castlewalls life runs red!

I have you now inside my head, I crush your feeble maggot minds,
the flies collect the remnants, The Locusts shatter flesh. FLESH!
My work almost complete...

The spells are cast, your dreams won't last, in perfect destruction,
The spells are cast, your dreams won't last, you fell for my seduction.
