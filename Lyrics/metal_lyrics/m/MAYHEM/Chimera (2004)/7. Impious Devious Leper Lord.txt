I saw an eye in the sky, Our lady sneaks of the world revealed,
upon the shores of the end, everything comes to life in me.
My eyes have opened to the world.

In this intimacy of the killing, dust reflections of outer limits,
this is what I have become, I have the power to take life. (Repeat)
To-Take-Life!

The true face of my race, (do I have the power to give life?)
The true face of my race! [Repeat]

True face, (Silence the enemies of my Kingdom)
True face, (Silence the enemies of my Kingdom)

Sweeping from the scarlet sky, Down to my dying eyes on earth.
Brings back all my feverish beasts.
Sweeping from the scarlet sky, Down to my dying eyes on earth.
True face!
