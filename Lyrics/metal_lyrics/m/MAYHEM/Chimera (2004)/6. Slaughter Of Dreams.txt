No spiritual awakenings exists, extreme effort of pulling life.
Vultures feasting in your consciousness, the factories of Mayhem is essence

Cornucopia of diseased dreams, In the combination of lesser worlds,
the solution to the enigma lies beyond, the spectrum of what minds achieve.

Sequences of the values of punishment, displays the utter consequences,
of what you do in forgetfulness, how pathetic man is before reality.
