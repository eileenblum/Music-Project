[l: Maniac]

I am the key of dark passion
I drink my blood, I eat my flesh
A serpent kiss I give to woman
A voyage through vortex scapes.

Serpent of Eve
Now there is an acid taste of life
Abhorrent Christendom - inside burning
Proclaim the fall of Seraphs
noli tangere me.

ad modium muscorum in marimo numero
Abyssmally distorted human morals
A serpent christ holy smile
seven planetary demons

Serpent of Eve.
