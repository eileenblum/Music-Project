Welcome!

To the elder ruins again
The wind whispers beside the deep forest
Darkness will show us the way

The sky has darkened thirteen as
We are collected woeful around a book
Made of human flesh
Heic Noenum Pax
Here is no peace
De Grandaevus Antiquus Mulum Tristis
Arcanas Mysteria Scriptum

The books blood written pages open
Invoco Crentus Domini De Daemonium
We follow with our white eyes
The ceremonial proceeding

Rex Sacrificulus Mortifer
In the circle of stone coffins
We are standing with our black robes on
Holding the bowl with unholy water

Heic Noenum Pax
Bring us the goat
Psychomantum Et Precr Exito Annos Major
Ferus Netandus Sacerdos Magus

Mortem Animalium
