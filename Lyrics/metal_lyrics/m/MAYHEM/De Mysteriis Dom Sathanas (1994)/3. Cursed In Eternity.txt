My name was written with
Fire in the place you only can see
When your time has come
When you walk down in the
Land of shadows for eternity

The demon flies in the blackened
Starless skies and crawls in
The bottomless depths of Hell
The name which will be a
Thousand times cursed in eternity

The demon flies in the blackened
Starless skies and crawls in
The bottomless depths of Hell
Condemned to wander, until it comes
To the cruelest snake that crawls
