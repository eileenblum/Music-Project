A dream of another existance
You wish to die
A dream of another world
You pray for death

To release the soul one must die
To find peace inside you must get eternal

I am a mortal, but am I human?
How beautiful life is now when my time has come
A human destiny, but nothing human inside
What will be left of me when I'm dead?
There was nothing when I lived

What you found was eternal death
No one will ever miss you
