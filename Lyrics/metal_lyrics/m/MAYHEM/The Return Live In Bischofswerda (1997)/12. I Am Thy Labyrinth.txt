[l: Maniac]

They speak...
In the garden of the prophet
Divine madness...
The order of the cosmic immoral

For what is humanity
If not forlorn
And crawling to my hands
When the moment sings

For I have read the signs
And I have solved the riddle
of eternal life
The Jinnah have spoken

For I have read the signs
And I have solved the riddle
of eternal life...
