Before me lay
Ten thousand dead first born
That never saw the light
Never felt the fright
The lust, the night
The fright, the night

A snake is crawling and death is doomed
The fearless man, behold him
Arise

The poison lies
The serpent's tongue
Deceitful mind

Wisdom fled, intoxicated
The demon's tongue, exaggerated
In the clearest light, in the clearest black
Evil awaits the fearless one

Death awaits for simple minded
Lying kind, assassinated
The fellow man, obliterated
Daemon spawn, underrated

The poison lies
The serpent's tongue
Deceitful mind
