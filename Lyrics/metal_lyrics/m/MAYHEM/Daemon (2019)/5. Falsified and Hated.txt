A man walks from the gates of grace
Willing to sin self proclaimed
Heavenly lust burns your soul
A sunk mind and courage

Salvation in your death
Salvation in your blood
No sunrise, the throne is gone
Falsified and hated

The wicked blessing of a demon
Curse
Stronger than life
Stronger than death

Burned in flesh, no healing
Burning wings, dreadful soul

Ah, heaven is burning
Ah, trumpets blow on deaf ears

Ah, heaven is burning
Ah, trumpets blow on deaf ears

A man walks from the gates of grace
Willing to sin self proclaimed
Heavenly lust burns your soul
A sunk mind and courage

Salvation in your death
Salvation in your blood
No sunrise, the throne is gone
Falsified and hated

Demon
Demon
Demon
Demon
Demon (Demon)
Demon (Demon)

Ah, heaven is burning
Ah, trumpets blow on deaf ears
