From these maleficent realms
Invoke the oath under will

Come atrocious
Omnipotent
Absorb all life

Before this iron age
Creation was fouled
By the stories of the false gods

Invoke the oath
Unhallowed truth
Catharsis by disaster
Gehenna opened up

Between outsiderness
And the captured minds
By the swearing
Reality darkened

Fathomless void
Despairing silence
Dead and mummified
Festering and resurrection

Invoke the oath
Invoke the oath
Invoke the oath
Invoke the oath
Invoke the oath
Invoke the oath
