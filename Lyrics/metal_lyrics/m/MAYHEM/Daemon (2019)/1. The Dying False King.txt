Cabal disguised
Divided not ruled
By hidden hands
Circumvented
Undermined

Betrayer
Depraved self unveiled
Insatiable cruel and perverted

Nothing thou shall hear, the nobles of all
The ill-founded truth unfolds to all
The time is ending
Prepared for death

Nothing remains
No acts, no words
End it all

The shame of the world
Dominion pulverized
The dying false king

Hidden in the woods
New rulers command
Dethroned and condemned
Distant screams
Silence, silence

A hamissÃ¡g kirÃ¡lya
Uralta a vilÃ¡got
Ãs most elbukott feje porba hullt
KÃ¡rhozatra Ã­tÃ©ltetett

The false king on the forest bed
His head severed
