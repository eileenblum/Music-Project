So much flowing bad blood
Rising like the flood
There is no cure for what you have
Nothing can fix it

You poisoned your own blood
There is no coming back
No way out, you are possessed
Face your hopeless fate

Prodigal
Bad blood

Brotherhood destroyed
I won't forgive
I won't forget
I will take my revenge

You crossed my red line
I sentence you to death
When the time comes
I will have you killed

Die
Now
Bad blood

Open your veins
Drain out all the filth within
Open your veins
I won't forgive
I won't forget

Bad blood
Die now

Die now

You crossed my red line
I sentence you to death
When the time comes
I will have you killed

Die
Now
Bad blood
