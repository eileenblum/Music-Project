Do you hear with eyes?
The universe is crunching
After the war... silence
Not in the black hole of stretched time
You ones had blood in your veins
The blood so black it hurts
Remembrance is torn away
I offer cosmos in my design
Chromosome needles in your arms
The suffering of a thousand voices
My science hurts
Values arises from pain
Birth is pain
Kaosconstruction not my game
No fairytales from dust dead books
Birth is pain
