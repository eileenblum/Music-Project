Dull care is slain
By the power
Of our ancient rites

One flame alone
Must light this pyre
Of pure eternal flame
Bring fire!

Our funeral pyre awaits the corpse of care

Ferried across the shadowy tide
In all the ancient majesty of death

Fools! Ye burn me once again!
Me ye cannot slay

I spit upon
Your fire!

In the flames that eat thine effigy
We will read the sign:

Midsummer
Sets us free!
