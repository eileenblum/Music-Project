Cast down between two world
Across the dark sea of awareness

The body hologram born
From the dust of a dying star
Neverending now of infinite illusions

Free to tremble in fear and pain
Limited by misfortune

Flawed by design
Lost in a lost world

Gods in exile
Feed on the weak
And the wounded

Quarantined in the
Labyrinth of time

Set free from gravityÂ´s weight
Alchemical wedding
Of crystalline heavy light
