Flashback of lights
Phantom halos come to life

Black piercing eyes
Nocturnal visit of the fourth kind

Petrified paralyzed
I hover above beyond myself

On the chrome altar
The seed is implanted
I was chosen to carry
They told me to be proud

Behind lights are shapes of horrors
No feelings no emotions
Spikes of electrodes
Injected into the skull

Encoded amnesia
Hall of nightmares
Dark rift of the soul
Ascension
Descension
