Subordination to another will
Sophisticated subtle techniques
Mind psyche wide opened
Stimulated triggers
Thought forms of malevolence and fear
In the veins of the floating genocide
Robot of voids by ultrasonic stimulations

Holds down the vibrational field

Rituals take place on grid of vortex points
Terror horror and hatred created

Worship of deconstructive negative pole
R-complex evolves the vril-force

Nourishment for the non-physical forms
To contact and manifest entities of another world

Flying through the depths of space
Someoneâs hand on the wheel
From where the lizard eye
Focuses the infinite line of alienation

Enter the gate of eternal lights
Appear another existence form
The immerge bended into the abyss
Inner world in the depths of the planet
Where the inverted sun never set
Illumination the enormous entities
Hiding them from the human eyes
Converse tubes to the surfaces and back
Only certain chosen can enter
