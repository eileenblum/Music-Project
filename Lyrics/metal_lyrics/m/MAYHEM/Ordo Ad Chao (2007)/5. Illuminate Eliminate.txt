Where I came fromâ¦I must return
No more, nothing left to do
No other mission

Weak and devastated
The strength had gone
Donât want to know more
Donât want to understand
Lost and empty
Only want to go, pass away
Send the self back

Exist here no more
Completely nothing

So many empty words been heard
So many meaningless thought been received
Whatever done equals zero times everything
No love no hate no faith no memory

Enter another sphere
Complete the emptiness

Desperately alone, fuck the race
Wide open and passing through
