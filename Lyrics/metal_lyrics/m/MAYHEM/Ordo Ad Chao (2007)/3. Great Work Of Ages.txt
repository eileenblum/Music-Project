Arrival of an achromatic mechanism
Hidden agenda, pious fraud of ages
Control, alteration, manipulation, antagonism

Human abilities perish in the acid of sorcery
Their senses turn into rusty strings
Victimized, possessed, superhuman undead

Shattered be the crystal of a lost civilization
Consumed be the human brain

And like hot sands slashing
Across the desertsâ face
The lies whirl about the earth
