Penetrate the lions at the gates
Illusions flow
After the next Iron Age
Mankind lost
The ships of flames rise to the sky
Annunaki on board

Watcher searches inside the thoughts
Inner waves corresponding outer frequencies
Rider falls down
The slave set free

Unknown path
The ways to wisdom are hidden
Shall the speaker silence

And the memories fade apart
Like the new attraction of outer space

Where the atomic corpus melts
Beyond the source of fears

Watcher sits on the borderthrone of insanity
Giving solution of existence from nonsense
