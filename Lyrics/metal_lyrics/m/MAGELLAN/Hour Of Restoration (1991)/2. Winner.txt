Welcome these players to your stage
Progressive, we cleverly syncopate
These rhythms, in a key, in an overture
Directing our experience into yours.

Waiting here for a visionary
Imagine living the new possibilities
In a matter of time you're a
Winner
Success at hand
It's all in your future just take command.
Anyone can be a winner
We all want a winner
Everybody wants one -
We all want a winner.
