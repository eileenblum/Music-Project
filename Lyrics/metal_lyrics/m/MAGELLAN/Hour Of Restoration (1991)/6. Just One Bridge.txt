Walking on a still green sea-have you got the faith to let it be?
Without falling through like an anchor tied - to your weighted memories of guilty times.
Stepping on a bed of coals - does little damage to the icy souls
'Cause there's just one bridge between pain and hope
So keep mind sharp enough to stay afloat - while you're here......
