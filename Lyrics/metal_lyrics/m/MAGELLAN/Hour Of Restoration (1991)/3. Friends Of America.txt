Fly the flag
Put your hand on your heart
You can be assured
That you've done your part
Watch the nation bleed
From the comfort of your chair
And then you'll just become
A lazy bum sitting there
Friends of America
Where are you now?
Get up and do something for
America, all of us stand up now.
FACE THE FACTS, we must practice
What we preach
Let go of yesterday -
There is an answer in our reach.
Someone lead the way, make us
Do the rest
We'll join together -
Sound the call
Now It's time to
Show them whose the best.
FRIENDS OF AMERICA
The world is a witness to the change
Of events in the rise of America.
Who are your leaders? And who are
Your heroes? In this America.
Stronger than ever we unite for the
Common cause of America.
Friends of America.....
