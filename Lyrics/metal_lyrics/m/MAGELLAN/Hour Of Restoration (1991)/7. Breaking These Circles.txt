When your mind stays awake and your body cries for sleep
Disillusioned from the pain you're in way too deep.
As the chains bind your soul and the sweat takes its toll
Don't submit to addiction - can't escape the whole world.
You're just looking for something - you can't find it in a bottle
You accelerate to the limit - Three more hits and the throttle
Will take you to the grave - to an early demise - don't expect any mercy
If you live in disguise.
Preaching again to the multitudes end. Make a promise to stop now 'cause
I can't even look in the mirror
A freak, a cruel lie
I've been fooling myself
In the images that I've justified.
Breaking these circles surrounding me there's a great white light at the end
My life is worth living again and again-
Now I believe in the knowledge and now I'm in the light.
Breaking these circles - don't repeat all our darkest nightmares
The universal man
Still in the same place his sin of addiction began........
