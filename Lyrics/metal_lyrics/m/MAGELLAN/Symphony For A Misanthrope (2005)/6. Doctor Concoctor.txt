I am your high priest of selling
And I've got your sainthood covered - again
I am a quick-change artist - at least
But don't you forget I'm an instrument of good
Your doctor

Bullet proof alibis - I'm your doctor
Social butterflies - I'm your doctor
I'll bring you powerful allies - I'm your doctor
I'm your high priest of selling - I'm your doctor

I am your Indian chief or your head cook and bottle washer
I'm what you need here 'cause I'm your doctor concoctor
Take me for who I am - your sacrificial lamb

"Follow -all they do is follow" (the people are sheep)
"Don't know" - huddled indecisive (the people are sheep) [x2]

Baa.

Bullet proof alibis - I'm your doctor
Social butterflies - I'm your doctor
I'll bring you powerful allies - I'm your doctor
I'm your high priest of selling - I'm your doctor [repeat]
