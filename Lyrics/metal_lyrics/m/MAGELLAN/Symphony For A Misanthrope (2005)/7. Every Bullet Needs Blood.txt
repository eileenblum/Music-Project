Dredging the world of memory
Dank and dirty as darkness descends
I can not see the moon tonight
There's a mist upon the land - and it doesn't feel right

Hush my child, I'll give you a clue -
Be careful young friend
The keeper is a prisoner too

Well, I went with the riders of Nebadon
To the battle of right and wrong
But the sun has been down for a month now
All the wrong that I've done... maybe I'll catch one

Every bullet needs blood
Every bullet needs blood

Man's inhumanity or God's insanity
Such a world as this -
Planet prison or cosmic vision?
We'll survive a sure fire miss...

Who sells the bullets? - who sells the guns?
Has the warden left for the rest of the day?

Every bullet needs blood
Every bullet needs blood
Fire at will...
Every bullet needs blood
Hell to pay...

Hush my child, I'll give you a clue -
Be careful young friend
The keeper is a prisoner too

Father, give me a sanctuary
Don't you see what they'll do to me?
Father, Father please forgive me!!!
Every bullet needs blood...

Like a lamb I was led to the slaughter
I had no choice but to fight
I was played like a pawn
There's blood in the water

Every bullet needs blood...

Every bullet needs blood (every bullet)
You say love is the answer to everything
Well, I've got my doubts you know
Father, please forgive me... [x3]
