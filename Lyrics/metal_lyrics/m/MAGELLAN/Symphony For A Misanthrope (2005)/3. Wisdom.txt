One man's playing piano and one man's drooling on the floor
And one man's making missiles 'cause he wants to prevent a world war
One man's disadvantaged just because his skin is black
And one man's children starve to death but not the idiot savants
No - not the idiot savants
No - it can never be the idiot savants

One man O.D.'ed on New Year's Eve
His dealer too happy to grieve
One man killed and another held out (the idiot savants)
Stupid wisdom is what this world's about.

We're so wise -so knowing -so understanding
The questions of life are so undemanding

So we grope and we hope that we'll find an answer
I must be an idiot or just one hell of a dancer
This one sings like an angel but she can't tie her shoes
But this one likes everybody -he just can't stand to hear the news

So what if my cousin's on the street
There's someone there to help him
This one don't wanna take care of the other two (the idiot savant)
'cause he's thinking of things he'd rather do

One man O.D.'ed on New Year's Eve
His dealer too happy to grieve
One man killed and another held out (the idiot savants)
Stupid wisdom is what this world's about

This guy can't even write his name
That lady thinks she's going insane
This time I'll find another home
Not so heavy 'cause I'd rather be alone...
