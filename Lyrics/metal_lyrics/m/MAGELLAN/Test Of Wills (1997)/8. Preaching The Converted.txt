[Verse 1]
I hear you laughing loudly
But I'm not laughing with you
Well you may be joking first
But I'll be the one who has the last laugh

[Verse 2]
You call yourself "progressive"
I say it's all regressive
You think you can stand in judgment
So listen here and I'll remind you

[Chorus]
Preaching the converted 'cause it's all you know
Music's dead because it's all about the money now
And you don't even know who you are anymore
"Put it out somehow" -
And the business man laughs all the way to the bank
And he's counting fast and he's laughing hard.
Laughing loud

[2nd time only]
And he's counting fast and he's laughing hard.
Laughing loud
And you don't even know who owns you anymore
"put it out somehow" - "put it out somehow"

And the business man laughs all the way to the bank
And he's counting fast and he's laughing hard.
Laughing loud
And he's counting fast and he's laughing hard.
Laughing loud
Can you take it?

[Cadence]
In our test of wills you got us for a song
Music's dead you sold us out for much too long
Preaching the converted......

[Verse 3]
I've given you all I have
But you say I must find more
"I've got to dig deeper-I've got to see
All the way within my soul"

[Verse 4]
You may call it inspiration
But I'd call it desperation
We're wasting our moments for now
Reliving the past - again and again

[repeat with full chorus]

[Bridge]
A game of tin soldiers is all that we're playing here but nobody wins
Well it doesn't mean anything 'cause it isn't all your saying now
But I hope I'm invited for the ride just in case we end our test of wills
Yes I've seen much stranger things in my days...

[Cadenca]
Preaching still...
Preaching the converted in our test of wills...
