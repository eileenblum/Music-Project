We're living proof of these uncertain times
Lost all our money and we've done our time
I've got no answers-only questions now
No point in starting over
Does no good anyhow.

I'm not a critic and I'm not a friend
Coming to terms or coming to an end?
Another test of wills could bring us down
I sense a confrontation in the way we sound

I hate to say I told you so-
Before you never listened to a word
But you remembered everything went wrong
So well... so well.
Now I can't leave and I can't stay
But I regret our moments everyday - don't you?
I heard you say this once before:
"You are my crucible".

Now don't be angry at the world - it's you
That comes between us and I know you know it too
We're living proof of these uncertain lines
No point in going back
We tried - we had enough time...............
