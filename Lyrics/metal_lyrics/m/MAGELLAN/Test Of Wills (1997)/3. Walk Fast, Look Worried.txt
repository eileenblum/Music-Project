Fear in a young one with innocence
A crisis I must resolve to handle with competence
He wants to know if he will be "taken" too
He worried - he asked me point blank
"Will I ever be as old as you?"
He just afraid at a young age
Don't want to leave you at a young age

Son I am sorry that things are not always
The way they appear
And don't you think about it anymore today
We've got plenty of time - so just for now please -

Keep me in sight - do as I say son
Please remember I can't always be there
So walk fast, look worried.

How did he think of such a question?
I'm sorry I have to be the one
That changes his perception
Wish we could keep things just like
We had before - an illusion
The point is our survival is the only thing
We're living for
I'm just afraid at a young age
Want to say the right words at a young age......

Son I am sorry that things are not always
The way they appear
And don't you think about it anymore today
We've got plenty of time-so just for now
Please-

Keep me in sight - Do as I say son
Please remember I can't always be there
So walk fast, look worried [x2]
Walk fast, look worried... [x4]

Sorry son, but I've just begun
Don't mean to break up all the fun
Walk fast, look worried
So disengage while your at the age
That you really don't care
Walk a line, keep it true
'cause there's more to life than I've told you
They'll take your money - take your pride
Gonna sell you on the dark side..........
Walk fast, look worried.
