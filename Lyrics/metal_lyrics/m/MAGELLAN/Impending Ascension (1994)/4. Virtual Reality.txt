Experience machines that know your thoughts and know your dreams
A better way of seeing things you won't believe it's real
Interact, you and I-there's a feeling lost we can't deny
I've opened up. We never tried to simulate it all.

Our love-it can be a virtual reality.

If we learn by degrees that the place you stand I may not be
In human change it's hard to see which barriers divide
What appears to be real is just the thing we want to feel
Technology our saving grace-a guiding hand to touch the face

Our love, it can be a virtual reality
Our love could go far if we just admit the truth of what we are

Matters of perception making all of the difference now
It's not the real world
So take a harder look at compromise-for there is nothing to lose
In our own image we can't create what we want to be
I want to know if there's forgiveness within a virtual reality

Our love, it can be a virtual reality
Our love, it can be a virtual reality
Our love could go far
But we have to face the truth of what we are not...

Could we see clearer in a virtual reality?
Could we be together in a virtual reality?

Matters of perception making all of the difference now
It's not the real world
So take a harder look at compromise-for there is nothing to lose
In our own image we can't create what we want to be
I want to know if there's forgiveness within a virtual reality......
