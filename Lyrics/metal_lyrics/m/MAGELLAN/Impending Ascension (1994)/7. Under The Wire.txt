Language and meter
Tools for a task
Structure and movement
There's logic at last

Critical rave
Misanthrope hired
Humans want quickness
So keep it under the wire

"The pit and the pendulum"
"The man of the crowd"
"The tell tale heart"

His characters move
Baptism by fire
The poet's survival kept under the wire...
