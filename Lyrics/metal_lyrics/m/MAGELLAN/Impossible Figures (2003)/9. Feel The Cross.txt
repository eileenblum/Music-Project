Evangelists - praise the divine
Cardinals - shift on the mainline
Cause and effect - rule at the same time
Absolution stopped - right at the bloodline

Heretics scream - "no prophets"
Zealots all walk a gauntlet
Spread the word - drink from the goblet
Native nations bleed in scarlet

Problematic - my tension
Ease the guilt with confession
So pray the angels are all Christian
Will the heathen find redemption?

Feel the cross
Is it burning deep in you?
Are you searching?
Love - mysterious expression
Spirit dwarfs in regression...

Know the cross
Know the passion
A final trial of oppression
Kingdom come in restoration
Martyrdom then salvation.

Feel the cross...
Hear it calling out?
