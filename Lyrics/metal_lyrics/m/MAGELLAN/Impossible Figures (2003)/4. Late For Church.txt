Tendencies that bring us
To our knees
See, there's no unity
Just a thousand different ways

Time for church
Oh really, let's see
Do the Jew and Gentile
Really need to agree?

What 'cha reading?
Did you think I'd be surprised?
You're the pastor's cash cow
But the good book still survives

But I'm late for church
I'm really late for church...

I don't want to dress up nice
I just want to stay home
I feel like watching big screen TV
With NFL on the VCR
And Pink Floyd on the DVD

I'm late for church - late for church
I'm late for church.
Now get in the car
Or there could be trouble
Why can't I just go back to sleep
It's long past 10 am...

From the Vatican
To the Rio Grande
Everything is dying
But I ain't weeping no more

In my school of thought
Religion reaping naught
It must be what I've bought
And they ain't selling any more

I don't want to dress up nice
I just want to stay home
I feel like watching big screen TV
With NFL on the VCR
And Pink Floyd on the DVD

I'm late for church - late for church
I'm late for church.
I'll get in the car
If you answer my question

Why so many churches here?
I thought there was only one God.
