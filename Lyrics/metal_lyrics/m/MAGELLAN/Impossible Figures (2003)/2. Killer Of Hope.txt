Swear I'm gonna break free
From the grip of sin
From that killer of hope...

'cause all I see is that killer of hope.

Well, did I ever think to think?
I didn't even try
I should have listened to the wise
Now its too late - I knew better

There's nothing good here
And it's time that I put this out-
All I am to you is another doubt

I don't believe in nothing
I don't believe that I care
Don't try to make me do it
All I need is just a little push, not a shove
And I'll get off the fence in a while...

She's the killer of hope
With a conscience that is clear
She understands I'm just a man
With a common fear
She's just what I need to forsake
But it's not that easy

[x1 How much more can I take?]

[x2... not supposed to be]

Now that I know her
I am never looking back
I've been beat up, I've been spit out,
I know shit, jack...
She may be my killer of hope
But if she calls my name now
I ain't going back

So now it's up to me
The future that I see
My spirit growing dark
And I fear (Oh God, I fear)
The moment that I try
My moment wants to die

Swear I'm gonna break free
From the grip of sin-
From that killer of hope.
