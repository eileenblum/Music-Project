you can speak softly
but there's no hiding the hate and the fear in your eyes
i can hear your whispers, i know more than you realize
but part of me thinks, "maybe they're right"
are we the youth in revolt or just cheaters and thieves?
violent fools? or are our actions justified?

i'm searching my mind and soul
there's no answer i can find
are our actions wrong or right?
do our intentions blur the line?

and does it make a difference? we're all fucked in the end
so what's the difference? we all lose in the end
