has this world lost its fucking mind?
that's how it seems to me, maybe i'm losing mine
day after day i'm going through the motions, i just can't relate
they've got us on our knees, eating from their hands
no need to force feed they've got us trained to take what we can get
i might not know what's right, but i can see that this is wrong
i can see what's going on, and i don't want to be a part
i don't want to be a part

like rats we go on
there's no hope in sight, maybe i'm going blind
the truth is there's no truth in this world
it's built on illusion and lies
i can see it coming now
but this storm won't wash us clean
we've lost track of where we've been
this shit is way too far ingrained
too far ingrained

i feel it coming down, but it won't change a thing
it won't wash us clean, no it's too late
we're bound to repeat the same mistakes
the harder we strain, the tighter the chains
another face, we're promised change, but it won't end
it's all the same
