i'm losing my grip on reality
sleepless nights are catching up with me
losing touch with everyone around me
feeling lost, feeling empty
the weight of this world is crushing down on me
the pangs of loneliness gnaw at me, they won't let me be

my eyes are bleeding
my brain is screaming
i can't escape the feeling this room is closing in around me
i've got to get out, it's getting hard to breathe
there's nowhere to go but this feelings consuming me
don't know if i can take this anymore

i'm seized by paranoia
i don't know why it's always been there and it just wont die
"breathe deep, you're fine"
reassurances don't mean shit when you're losing your mind
i've tried, there's nowhere i can hide

i've lost my sense of what is real
sleepless nights are destroying me
i've lost touch with everyone and everything

my eyes, my eyes are bleeding
my brain is screaming
i can't escape the feeling that the world is falling in around me
