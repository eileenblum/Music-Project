chains on my legs, thorn in my side
my past sits heavy in the back of my mind
i can't shake it, can't escape it
force it down, push it aside
i'll dodge the point, avoid the issues,
transgressions justified
i try my best, just to forget
but the guilt keeps crawling back
i've traced it backward through my mind
i'm digging deep but i can't find
just how i came to be this way
try as i may i'll never change

it seems like i'm doomed to run forever
i search for the answers but it gets no better
struggle to learn from past mistakes
this hole's so deep effort feels like a waste
i feel my conscience start to slip again
out of my head, i'm free to sin again
just like that i'm where i started
it seems like this cycle will never fucking end
