this can't last forever
the more that i learn, the less that i know
i keep losing sight
i can't stay focused and it's starting to show
things just move so fast now
i'm falling down, i can't keep up
i try so hard to make it
but i never come through, it's never enough
i try to make the best
but the minutes and hours slip through my grasp
i've wasted so much time doing nothing and i can't get it back
life moves by so fast now
my mind is fucked, i can't keep up
i try so hard to keep track, but time slips forward out of my mind

caught standing still
i stare in shock at what has become of my life
in disbelief, i stand and watch as the weeks and months and years fly by

time doesn't heal, it only destroys
without warning, it passes you by
taking what you have and running out on you
what can you do?
