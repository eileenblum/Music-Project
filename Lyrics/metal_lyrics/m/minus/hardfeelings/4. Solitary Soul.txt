i live my life turned inward, i rarely leave my head
constantly withdrawn inside, i just want to sink
i know i can't go on like this, men like me just can't exist
there's no room in this world for a solitary soul like me

i want to change, i need to change
but i can't find the words to say
or make the people i love believe me
please believe me

i am like a hurricane
there is calm in my eye but there's a storm inside my head
i can't escape the words that she said
solitary soul, that is what i am
i am a lost cause
i'll look in from the outside for the rest of my life

solitary soul
wander, forever alone
no place will ever be your home
