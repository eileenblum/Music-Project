when i see your face, i can't help but feel ashamed of myself
i caused so much pain, i was never there
i couldn't open myself up, too scared to share the burden
to scared to bare my burning soul

my whole life, i've never felt good enough for anyone or anything
i've never tried, for fear of failing
self-destruction is the name of the game that i play when things go right
opportunity kicks down my door and i'm flying out the back
i know i fucked it up, but you still said that there was hope
you found comfort in the arms of another, with that i cannot cope

i do my best to block you out, but i still picture you with eyes shut tight
my face burns, my stomach turns, i feel fucking sick

i didn't want it to turn out this way
and i'll bear the weight of the blame
i don't want it, but there will always be
hard feelings
