another day goes by, it just gets worse
i'm looking at the world, it's gone to shit
i'm losing my will to live
it's getting harder and harder to face another day
i feel my mind slowly decay, this is too much to take
i'm trying and trying not to give into this, but i can't take the weight

been bending for far too long, now it's time to snap back
i've lost all faith, i'm about to crack

i look in the mirror, i can't stand what i see
i'm fucking sickened by the world around me
demons and scum, no matter where i turn
we'll all pay the price, we'll all fucking burn

another day goes by, it's getting worse
this fucking world has gone to shit
i'm losing my will to live

we'll all pay the price, we'll all fucking burn
