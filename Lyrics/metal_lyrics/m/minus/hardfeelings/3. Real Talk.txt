they will always talk
i never listened, because it doesn't matter anyway
don't waste your time, i'm on my own
they can't even look my way
or stand behind the words they say
don't tell me what i need to do

why can't you get it through your fucking head? your words go unheard here
wo why not save your fucking breath for someone who cares?

they walk in line
i will never fucking do what they do
i won't waste my time
i will never do as i'm told
fucking figure it out
i don't give a fuck about you
in my life, you have no fucking say

why can't you get it through your fucking head? your shit has no pull here
so just save your fucking breath, because i don't fucking care

understand that i don't need your advice
i'll do just fine on my own
i'll turn my back, i won't think twice
fuck you
