To the mountain of glass
She used to fly at night...
She told me stories about BlÃ¥kulla,
A sabbath was held on Walpurgis' night, yeah!

She was a witch from KyÃ¶peli...
She was a victim of Christianity...
She was burned at stake...

Despite all the horrors she did...
I've still loved her for all these years...
She must have made a love potion,
Brewed and bottled in KyÃ¶peli...

She was a witch from KyÃ¶peli...
She was a victim of Christianity...
She was burned at stake...
