By the streets of that one bedroom apartment
We stood and watched the storm.
Our eyes upon the blackened sky,
As the rain began to fall.
With a gentle sigh you took my hand and pulled me in,
So close. Our pulses, beating a rhythm of passion 
As the lightning split the sky.

I gazed into your eyes, so bright and gently caressed 
Your face. Your soothing touch,
Well, there's never quite enough,
Yes, there's never enough of you and me..

Our lips, warm with the heat of desire 
As the wind tore through the streets, 
Of that one bedroom apartment our souls embraced once more.

I gazed into your eyes, so bright and gently caressed 
Your face. Your soothing touch,
Well, there's never quite enough,
Yes, there's never enough of you and me..
(Two souls aglow with passion and love, as the rain began to fall)

Notice my smile.
How spontaneous and true!
Damn I loved you, god damn
[x2]

There was never enough of you and me

Can you not hear the hum of my body
Responding to your nearness?
My heart keeps time.
My love is vast and deep and whole.
Just like the open sea
It will go on forever more into eternity!!!

Just when I thought we'd given up,
We stayed on the road and made it, 
I can never see you in your room 
Sleeping without me

Just when I thought we'd given up,
We stayed on the road and made it, 
I can never see you in your room 
Sleeping without me

Touch me....I tremble
Hold me...I sigh
Kiss me...I melt
Ask me....Why
[x2]

Just when I thought we'd given up, 
We stayed on the road and made it, 
I can never see you in your room 
Sleeping without me
[x4]

Get, get out, get out of here
Get, get out, get out of here
