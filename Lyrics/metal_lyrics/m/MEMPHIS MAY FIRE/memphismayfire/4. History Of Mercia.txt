Gathered together, 
The feared men in the banquet-hall 
All were put on a bench assigned,
All were strong until we sat them down,
To call them out. A henchman 
Attended, with a cup in hand,
Served the clear liquor to the forgotten men.
And these words were sang to me,

Heroes revealed,
No glory to shame, 
Take it all aside 
And show me your face, 
Just once again
Heroes revealed.

Heroes revealed, no glory to shame,
Take it all aside, show me your face 
Heroes revealed, no glory to shame,
Take it all aside, show me your face 

Now the nights have grown cold,
The sun's gone without a trace,
These are all men of glory and fame.
They'll go to their homes, 
To be with their kids,
But once a hero's revealed 
Grab your gear (grab your gear) and lets lift these arms

I heard you say you're coming back to fight them off, 
You know they're coming after you, 
Save us from this open wound we call weakness,
You know they're coming after you. 

I heard you say you're coming back to fight them off, 
You know they're coming after you, 
Save us from this open wound we call weakness,
You know they're coming after you. 

You know they're coming after you. 
You know they're coming after you. 
You know they're coming after you. 
???

Take everything we knew 
And put it in the past, God has 
Forgiven them and so have I, 
But now we shall resign. 

Take everything we knew (take everything we knew)
And put it in the past, (and put it in the past, God has)
God has forgiven them (forgiven them and so have I)
And so have I (but now we shall resign.)

Heroes revealed, no glory to shame,
Heroes revealed, no glory to shame, 
Take it aside and call
