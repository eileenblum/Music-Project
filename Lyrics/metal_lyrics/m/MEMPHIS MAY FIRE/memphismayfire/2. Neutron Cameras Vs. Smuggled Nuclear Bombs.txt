I was abandoned last night without a way home
Stuck in a desert with only you above me
I'm sorry I turned my back, back on you so many times
I'm standing right here asking you to accept my apology

Not everyone we know has faith in you
But we all know where they'll go in the end

Come on, lets go and break these chains
I need your help my sweet God

Here lately I've abandoned me, 
Get up decide, get up decide, well I won't know
My god she abandoned me, 
Get up decide, get up decide, well I need you!

Well it's been two years now, 
Am I wasting her time, 
God I know that you can help me with all my problems

It's been over a year and a half, 
Am I wasting her time, there's been a lot 
Of things on my mind and I know that you can help me
I'll bleed for you just like you bled for me
I'm in a home with nothing more than a bed

A bed!
Won't you help me?

Lonely child, don't be afraid, don't be afraid
Only love disintegrates the soul and turns your streets to gold

I sit here smoking these cigarettes 
So hear this out 
I sit here smoking these cigarettes 
So hear this out 

Oh my god I'm dying to know 
If this panic setting in is a good excuse 
To step away from 
Oh my god I'm dying to know 
If this panic setting in is a good excuse 
To step away from you 

To break me, 
Get up decide, get up and fight, 
I need your help, and break me down, 
Go on, I need your help, 
God let's go, help me, break me!
