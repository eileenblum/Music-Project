Staring at the pictures on my walls wishing I was there
But I'm stuck in a world where nobody cares, I've gotta finish
Wondering what you'll do when I'm gone, I bet you'll find somebody new

I got a ticket for a one way ride and I'm never gonna look back, never gonna look back
Take it all in stride and make my way to the world baby, my world baby
Now that I'm gone, that I'll be running back to you
Now that I'm gone, don't think that I'll be running back to you

The queen, she told me I'd someday die, but what the hell does she know
I'll carry on. they say don't knock before you try theres a fork in the road

I really think we can make it, its time to be fake if, 
we get respect in the city streets. 
tire tracks lace our history, and if you were listening
You know I mean every word I say!

Well it goes to say everything right now happens for reason
Well it goes to say everything happens
There's a fork in the road and the easy way looks dry
So I'll take my chances and turn my world up in blue tonight

Now that I'm gone don't bother to think that I'll be running back
To you-hoo-hoo
Now that I'm gone don't bother to think that I'll be running back
To you-hoo-hoo yeah
