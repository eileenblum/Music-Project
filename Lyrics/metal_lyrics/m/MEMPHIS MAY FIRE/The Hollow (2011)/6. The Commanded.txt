I felt the ground start to shake.
Oh God, oh God,
Everything's up in flames.
I prayed that it would have ended
Just as fast, just as fast as it came.

All I could hear was:
"March on, march on.
Quick on your feet,
March on, march on.
March on, march on.
Whether you like or not,
March on, march on!"

Finish what you started.
Just remember you can't bring them back,
Just remember you can't bring them back.

Heads will roll, bullets will fly.
We've all been turned into blood thirsty cannibals.
Just don't close your eyes!
Just don't close your eyes,
Sleep with one open!

Everything's put into perspective
When you're staring down
The barrel of a gun.
I've come to peace with the fact
That I can't take it back,
What's done is done!

But the bodies still haunt my dreams,
Oh, the bodies still haunt my dreams.
The bodies still haunt my dreams
And they always will!

March on, march on.
March on, march on.
Quick on your feet!

Finish what you started.
Just remember you can't bring them back,
Just remember you can't bring them back.
Finish what you started.
Just remember you can't bring them back,
(Just remember)
Just remember you can't bring them back.

How many of them will be forgotten,
Laying a part of the ashes?
No words can describe the guilt,
But I had no choice!

We were surrounded,
No words can describe.
We were surrounded, 
I had no choice.
Words can't describe
The guilt that I felt,
But I had no choice.

Finish what you started.
Just remember You can't bring them back,
(Just remember)
Just remember You can't bring them back.
Finish what you started.
Just remember You can't bring them back,
(Just remember)
Just remember You can't bring them back.

How many of them will be forgotten,
Laying among of the ashes?
