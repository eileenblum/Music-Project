It always ends the same
I gave you all my heart just to watch it get thrown away
Thrown away
It takes a toll on my soul
'Cause I'm starting to believe that love's just a game we play
Is it all just a game?

One day I'll heal but I'll be covered in scars
And I'll never forget watching it all fall apart
When you finally came clean about the lies and the games that you played from the start
It's like every second we spent together is always on repeat in the back of my mind
What was I thinking when I gave you my life?
You knew it would end
You knew this would die

You'll never find another one like me

I think I'd give you another chance if you deserved one
I think I'd have room in my heart but I simply reserved none
I'd let you beg on your knees for forgiveness at last
But you're just a mistake
Please give me my life back

You made me so insecure and unsure of everything I thought was real
I just wish I could rewind and go back to a time
When I knew what it was like to feel
I hope someday someone ruins you the way you ruined me
I just want you to know how it feels
I want you to see it's like my heart was made to be broken

Why can't I let go?
Now that it's over I just need you to know

I think I'd give you another chance if you deserved one
I think I'd have room in my heart but I simply reserved none
I'd let you beg on your knees for forgiveness at last
But you're just a mistake
Please give me my life
Give me my life back

They say it's better to have loved than never at all
But I can't seem to find any good in being thrown at the wall
I'm not sure if I can stand up from this fall
I lay tossing and turning and trying to forget
I thought I'd be over you by now
With all you put me through I'm full of regret
I wish I could just forget somehow

You'll never find another one like me, yeah

I think I'd give you another chance if you deserved one
I think I'd have room in my heart but I simply reserved none
I'd let you beg on your knees for forgiveness at last
But you're just a mistake
Please give me my life back
Please give me my life back
Give me my life back
Give me my life
