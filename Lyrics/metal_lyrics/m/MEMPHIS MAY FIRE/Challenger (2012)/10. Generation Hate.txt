You sit at home feeling so strong from behind that screen
But honestly do you think those words you're typing are gonna change anything?
Could it be this is just an escape from all your insecurities? (insecurities)
Could it be your deepest secret is you wish that you were me?

Tell me what is it with this love to hate?
I think I'm starting to lose all my faith
This isn't how it's supposed to be

You see everything in black and white
Who are you to tell me what's wrong or right?
What could I possibly learn from someone like you?
You don't know the first thing about my life

Say what you will
You know it all or at least you think you do
Waste all your days complaining
You think we care, but
Everyone knows that you don't have a clue
So say what you will
But you wouldn't last a day in my shoes
Waste all your days complaining
You think we care, but
This is a war you will always lose

So go and disregard the blood, sweat and tears we shed for you
But who will have the upper hand
When this is over and I've done everything you wished you could do
Stop wasting my time
So full of things to say when you feel safe
Maybe I'll listen to you whine
The day you wanna say it to my face

Bring it on!

So many mouths that love to run
But I just laugh 'cause I've been confronted by none

Say what you will
You know it all or at least you think you do
Waste all your days complaining
You think we care, but
Everyone knows that you don't have a clue
So say what you will
But you wouldn't last a day in my shoes
Waste all your days complaining
You think we care, but
This is a war you will always lose

Say what you will (say what you will)
You know it all or at least you think you do
Waste all your days complaining
You think we care, but
Everyone knows that you don't have a clue
So say what you will
But you wouldn't last a day in my shoes (day in my shoes)
Waste all your days complaining
You think we care, but
This is a war you will always lose

I'm calling out my generation (it's up to us to change this)
This is an alarm
Can you hear it now?
It seems like "caring" is just a phase we're over now
I'm calling out my generation
You should be ashamed
'Cause you're the ones to blame
This isn't how it's supposed to be
