This is who we are
These are the roads we paved
The strength we found and the mistakes we made along the way
This is who we are
These are the roads we paved
The strength we found and the mistakes we made along the way
This is who we are
These are the roads we paved
The strength we found and the mistakes we made along the way
This is who we are
These are the roads we paved
And now I've had enough of your judgment

You pass it so easily
If you think that I take it to heart now you see
This is my design
You don't know the cost
So I'll keep my faith and you can stay lost
Who is with me?
We have the strength to shed light
And this is the moment suspended in time
No limits
No boundaries at all
Just when you think we conform to a scene we break down the wall
