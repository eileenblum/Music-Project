Raise your glass to everything 
You've accomplished on your own
I promise it wouldn't mean a thing tomorrow
We're all just headed straight for the ocean floor
On a ship without any captain aboard

This time you can't save yourself

We're all (we're all) just wasting time
Standing still waiting for
Something to happen, something to happen
But I think we'd all be fine
If everyone would just shut up and listen
Be slow to speak, shut up and listen

We have no idea what we're capable of
We have no idea what we're capable of
If only we would live in fear of knowing 
Our own flesh and blood does not belong to us
We'd see everything a little different than before

Lose your pride

We're all (we're all) just wasting time
Standing still waiting for
Something to happen, something to happen
But I think we'd all be fine
If everyone would just shut up and listen
Be slow to speak, shut up and listen

What you want is never what you need
Is never what you need
Be careful what you wish for

Lose your pride
If it's what you come back to
Lose your pride
Realize this was never about you

This time you can't save yourself

We're all (we're all) just wasting time
Standing still waiting for
Something to happen, something to happen
But I think we'd all be fine
If everyone would just shut up and listen
Be slow to speak, shut up and listen
