How can you just turn your back on everything you said you believe
It may not be real to you but it's real to me

Leave me out, I want no part of this
Open the gates and push me in 
I'm not ashamed of who I have been
I'll never hesitate to say
I've seen what I have needed to see
Of this world in decay
These days reality is an antique
And I'm afraid that will never change

One by one they drop like flies
I've seen it right before my eyes
We're running out of time
So choose your side

Liars, liars
You went back on everything
It may not be real to you 
But it's real to me

I'd rather die for the truth
Than live for a lie
So I'll live by faith and not by sight

Why don't you stop denying you're living a lie
And realize you were never alive
You can deceive them but I won't believe them
There's nothing you can do to change my mind
The path that I will take 
Has been defined by the choices I have made
I will not let my heart get harder
Won't let my heart get harder

Liars, liars
You went back on everything
It may not be real to you 
But it's real to me

It may not, it may not be real to you 
But that doesn't change a thing

You liars, you liars
I put so much trust in you
Just to watch you turn your back and walk away
So lay down and rot

Lay down and rot
You're dead to me, dead to me
Just like the rest of them
You're dead to me

One by one they drop like flies
I've seen it right before my eyes
We're running out of time
So choose your side

Liars, liars
You went back on everything
It may not be real to you 
But it's real to me

It may not, it may not be real to you 
But that doesn't change a thing

Save your lies
This is the one thing you'll never take from me
You'll never change my mind
Oh I dare you to try

We are not the same
I will not be infected
We are not the same
I will not be infected
