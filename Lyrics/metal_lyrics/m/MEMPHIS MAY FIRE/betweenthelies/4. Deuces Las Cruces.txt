Living in-between
What's real today
And what is possible
For tomorrow
Now I know
This is our call
We have been shown
The path we will follow

It's easier said than done
We've lost more than we have won
The only thing that keeps our feet moving
Is your love

Oh
This is all that we know
Leaving our lives at home
To be the best that we can
And hope for a better tomorrow

We stand again, we stand again
To move towards your voice
Block out the noise
Block out the noise
Block out the noise

It's your heart that beats inside of our chests
We'll do our part and you'll do the rest
We'll go where you need us to be
We'll plant the seed

This is all we...
Oh
This is all that we know
Leaving our lives at home
To be the best that we can
And hope for a better tomorrow
Oh
This is all that we know
Leaving our lives at home
To be the best that we can
And hope for a better tomorrow

Take every part of me
Our lives are not our own
It's your heart that beats inside of us
Guide our feet and we will go

We will be your hands
If you will guide our feet
We will be your voice
You are strength when we are weak
So keep me moving
