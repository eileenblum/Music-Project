You don't have to know me 
To know that you're lost 
Just know that I don't mind
I don't mind
And you don't have to see me
To know that I'm right
By your side
Just know I will never leave you
My child
Follow me follow me
If you have no place to go
I will guide you home
Follow me follow me
If you're at the end of your road
Just take my hand and never let go

Your vaulted ceilings are
Of no comparison to the sky
Won't you let me show you out 

Follow me follow me
If you have no place to go
I will guide you home
Follow me follow me
If you're at the end of your road
Just take my hand and never let go

Be still and know
I'd never leave you or forsake you 
Be still and know
I'd never leave you I'd never leave you...
