I'm never slowing down 
Until I'm right where I should be
This is not the life I chose
It was chosen for me
It seems like everytime I turn my head
Someones got something to say
Well I... I am not listening
As I move forward 
You can crawl behind me
I've made it this far on my own
You can try to keep up 
But I promise you won't 
I swore to my family and my friends
That I'd do whatever it takes
To finish in first place
Say what you want but 
You better remember this face
I'll do whatever it takes
To finish in first place
No one can slow me down I know
I know I will be holding on while you are letting go

Oh I think I'd hate you 
If it were worth my time
But I wont waste a single second of mine
Just stand on the sideline
Mark my words when it comes time to sink or swim
I'll be on top and you'll sink again

I swore to my family and friends
That I'd do whatever it takes
To finish in first place
Say what you want but 
You better remember this face
I'll do whatever it takes
You better remember this

Don't doubt me for a second. I'm nothing like the rest of them.
Don't doubt me for a second. I'm nothing like the rest.
Everything I've worked for 
Is right before my eyes
I'm on top of the world
Try to pull me under
This is what you will find
When you sink, I'll swim.
When you sink, I'll swim.

I swear to my family and friends
That I'd do whatever it takes
To finish in first place
Say what you want but 
You better remember this face
I'll do whatever it takes
To finish in first place
I swore to my family and friends
That I'd do whatever it takes

When you sink, I'll swim.
I'll be on top and you'll sink again...
