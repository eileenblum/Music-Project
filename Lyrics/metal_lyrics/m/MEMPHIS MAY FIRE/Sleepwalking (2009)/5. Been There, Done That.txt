We are all guilty
But silence will not save our souls
We are becoming tired and weary and our conscience is slowly growing old
Living by the reason of science
Never question what we are told
These words rise above my voice but I think you already know

Now let's get one thing straight I've been there
I've done that and I refuse to go back
Nothing you can do will change my mind
All trust me I've been there I've done that
And I refuse to go back
Nothing you can do will change my mind

Were all searching for something so much greater than what we have
And these lies have nothing to offer us
A bigger meaning a better purpose please trust me this is worth it
You don't have to be the person you were yesterday

Take your seats

Now please let me break the silence and say
What you've been waiting to hear
I have the answer I have the cure

I have the answer I have the answer I have the cure
I have the answer I have the cure
I have the answer I have the cure

I'll say it again and again
I have the cure
Everything is overly organized
But you seem strangely out of place
When will you realize the past can not be erased (when will you realize)

Were all searching for something so much greater than what we have
And these lies have nothing to offer us
A bigger meaning a better purpose please trust me this is worth it
You don't have to be the person you were yesterday

I refuse to wash my hands of this
And forget what needs to be said
If life is all we are living for then kill me now
If life is all we are living for then kill me now
