I am the air on your lungs
and the blood in your veins.
I am all the voices you hear,
and i will never go away.

The deafening sound you hear
is coming straight from your mouth.
Choke on your words your so shallow.
Bite your lip!
Bite your lip when you hear it.
hold your tongue.
You gotta hold your tongue.

Don't be so blind.
Time is not on our side.
Look me straight in the eyes.
Do not say you will be alright.

Put it all on the line
and for a minute the earth will stand still.

I am the ghost,
the ghost in the mirror that re creates,
painting your soul with every color you hate.

I am the voices that you hear
and the decisions you make.
I am the air that you breath
and I will never go away.

I will not carry you through.
Is that what scares you the most?

My friend, you fooled yourself again,
into thinking it's real.
They can not save you like I can.
They can not make you feel.

Swimming in regret
but the water is much too deep.
This is your very last breath,
Chose your words carefully.

I am the ghost,
the ghost in the mirror that re creates,
painting your soul with every color you hate.

I am the voices that you hear
and the decisions you make.
I am the air that you breath
and I will never go away.

Save yourself from the lies that brought my father to his knees!

OH!
Don't be so blind!
Time is not on our side!
Look at me straight in the eye!
Put it all!
Put it all on the line!
