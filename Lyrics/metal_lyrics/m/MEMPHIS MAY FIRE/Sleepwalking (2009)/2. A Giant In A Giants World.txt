Behold this is my vision no less real for being unseen
Like a giant in a giant's world the I am proud of nothing 
We try to be better from the outside in
But still we have no place to call home In the end

A wise man speaks when he has something to say
But fools just have to say something
A wise man speaks when he has something to say
Just keep your mouth shut just keep your mouth shut

Ignorance Ignorance
It is the root and the stem of all that you know
This life that we live is not all there is
This life that we live this life that we live

We try to be better from the outside in
But still we no place to call home In the end
We try to be better we try to be better
We there is know price go

Two roads diverged in the woods I
I took the one less traveled by
This has made all the difference difference
Two roads diverged in the woods and I
I took the one less traveled by
This has made all the difference difference  

If they only knew where we've been we've been
When and where going to
No If they only knew where we've been we've been we've been
When and where we your going to
It is the end

Only the dead have seen the end of anything
Prepare me for the end prepare me for the end
