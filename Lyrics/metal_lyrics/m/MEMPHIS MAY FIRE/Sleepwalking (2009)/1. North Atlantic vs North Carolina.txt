Oh why do you try and pull me under?
Trust me I am already dead
I've been digging my own grave for far too long now,
And I don't mind waking up without in my bed.

Oh when the sun comes up you will realize that you were wrong,
And when your lungs collapse every breath that you take will feel like your last.

I want to see the fire ignite, suffocating the sky; 
Don't ever say that you know just what this feels like, 
I swear one day I'll kill this lie.

Curiosity has taken its toll once again,
And taken over, taken over everything we had.

Oh it's a shame,
You just walked away,
Take everything, I don't want the memories to stay.
Say you didn't see it coming,
But I can see it from a mile away.
Look in between the lines and read the story written on your face.

Oh when the sun comes up you will realize that you were wrong,
And when your lungs collapse every breath that you take will feel like your last.

I want to see the fire ignite, suffocating the sky; 
Don't ever say that you know just what this feels like, 
I swear one day I'll kill this lie.

Letting go is easier when you have nothing left to lose,
So I'm letting go, I'm letting go, I'm letting go of you.

Oh please, look in me in the eye, next time you stab me in the back.
Oh please, look in me in the eye, next time you stab me in the back.

Oh please, look in me in the eye,
(You know to come and get all of your clothes out of my house.)
Next time you stab, you stab me, you stab me in the back.
(So go tell all your friends why chose to stick around.)
