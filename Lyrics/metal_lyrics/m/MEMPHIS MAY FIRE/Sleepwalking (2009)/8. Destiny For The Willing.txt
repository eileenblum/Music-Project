We are alive the last men standing from the fight
We are the chosen and we claim your life tonight
Breathe in the light that surrounds us
Can you fell it take the risk but know the consequence
Know the consequence

If we were made for this
Who are we to act any differently
No one said this would be easy
Never look back leave it all behind

The clouds overhead have come and gone with the storm
Now let me show you the truth

We were born into the open sky
Where heroes are created
And legends never die
We were born into the open sky
Where heroes are created
And legends never die

If we were made for this
Who are we to act any differently
No one said this would be easy
Never look back leave it all behind

There is hope in every open eye
So live your life like you're ready to die
Let them have everything but your pride
Hold your ground when the sun sets tonight is the night

Darkest night comes just before dawn

Darkest night comes just before the dawn
And trust me son and trust me son

A darkest night comes just before the dawn
And trust me son we will make it our alive
