Persevere persevere It's time to test the limits of your heart
Make it clear this is not
A test of the system they want you to believe
Understanding the paths that we take
Relay's signals from our nerves to our brain
Don't get lost in the upside down ways
This world has a heavy hold on your heart

You've know from day one that things aren't always cut just to fit you
Uncertain of what's at stake
This question is killing you
So many think they know it all
All they know is that It's gonna end
Gotta live while you can gotta live while you can

You'll find it hard harder now just to believe
Give it some time give it time
Give it face needed time

Crashing through the open doors
Fall flat on our faces again
This is the life that you chose you've got the time make your amends
Crashing through the open doors
Fall flat on our faces again
This is the life that you chose you've got the time make your amends

I know sometimes It's so hard
Afraid to show your weakness but were all so weak inside
So don't listen make up your own mind
Listen with your ear to the sky
And keep your feet moving persevere persevere
You have the power to make this life your own
Its time to test the limits of your heart
Make it clear make it clear
This is not a test of the system

In a world a world that is broken a world that is broken
I'm afraid of a world that is breaking a world that is breaking down

In a world that is broken and dead
I am afraid that there's nothing left
In a world that is broken and dead
I am afraid that there's nothing left

In a world that is broken and dead
I am afraid that there's nothing left
Show them how strong you are
You've come this far don't fall
