The city hides the secrets of the liars in the streets
The phone calls and assurances all for nothing (but looking good)
Every time the truth comes out its pushed away and pushed aside
But I won't stand and watch it all
It all go unsaid

How many times will I fall victim to this It's normal by now
No one helps each other up we push one another back down
It's sad to see these people
And the apathy they have
I hope one day they lose it all for the choices they made

Out in the open there's the air of brotherhood
And spoken truth yet everyone knows what goes on behind these closed doors
Do tell no one cares about the heart no one cares about the past
I've seen the way we treat each other
So keep smiling through your teeth

Don't ever tell me you're telling the truth
Don't ever think you can speak my name
When did we stray from what we stand for
When did it all mean nothing to you

It's hard to find honest mind in this city
And I keep hoping someone will speak up
It's hard to find honest mind in this city
And I keep hoping hoping someone will speak up

I've seen how all of this ends
And I promise It's worth whoever it offends
What happened to what we believed in

And I have seen how all of this ends
Sleepwalking our way to contentment
I wont just let it be and let you smile through your teeth
You call yourself human
So say it straight to me

We're sleepwalking all the way to contentment
When will somebody speak up
We're sleepwalking all the way to contentment
When will somebody speak up speak up

Don't ever tell me you're telling the truth
And don't ever think don't ever think
And don't ever think you can speak my name
