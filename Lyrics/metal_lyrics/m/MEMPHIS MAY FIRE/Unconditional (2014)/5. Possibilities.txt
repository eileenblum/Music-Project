So caught up in our own day-to-day, we see lives in need &amp; look the other way.
I'm not a pessimist, but I think it's safe to say this would be different if it was your family. We can't fathom not having a place to rest our heads.
Can you imagine the pain of a newborn child that won't be fed? 
It's so easy getting comfortable. 
We ignore the empty hands in need, thinking someone else will see them. 

Can you see the possibilities?
We have the ability to change the World! 
If we want to see a change we have to be it. 
Stand up &amp; believe that the responsibility's ours!

Day after day they continue to die so we think our prayers go unheard, but poverty ends where compassion begins. 
We can no longer deny it's up to us. 
It's up to us! 
We are the chosen ones, called to be bold! 
There is no time to hesitate. 
Today is the day we can break the mold! 

Can you see the possibilities? 
We have the ability to change the World! 
If we want to see a change we have to be it. 
Stand up &amp; believe that the responsibility's ours! 

Their starving eyes cry out for anyone to listen, reaching out for anyone to care. 
Would we ignore them now if they were our own children or make a promise to always be there? 
Remove the veil from your eyes! 
We could move mountains if we only tried! 
Remove the veil from your eyes! 
We hold the power in our hands to save their lives! 

Can you see the possibilities?
We have the ability to change the World! 
If we want to see a change we have to be it. 
Stand up &amp; believe that the responsibility's ours!
