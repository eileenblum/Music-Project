I take a deep breath into my lungs, let it out &amp; move on. 
I take a step back &amp; look at all that I've done. 
Why does it feel like I'm right back where I started from? 
How can it be I need more when I've already won? 
Just when I think I've got it all figured out you grab my hand &amp; say not so fast, boy don't you see there is so much more! 

I'm at the top of the world &amp; I feel it, but it's not enough for me. 
No it's not enough for me! 
I used to think I'd find myself at the top above all the pain &amp; the failure I saw. 
Now that I'm here I see it's not what I wanted at all. 

I feel it in my bones.
It's in my blood. 
A constant search for the one true love. 
Show me something real, I want to feel your touch. 
What is enough? 
Show me enough!

I'm at the top of the world &amp; I feel it, but it's not enough for me. 
No it's not enough for me! 
I want to live forever! 
Give me open eyes to see this is not enough for me! 

This world wants me dead. 
Dead to the truth &amp; buried from the inside out, but I can't hide the hope I've found in you. This world wants me dead. 
Dead to the truth &amp; buried from the inside out, but I cannot be shaken I won't be moved. 
My crown is eternal!

I'm at the top of the world &amp; I feel it, but it's not enough for me. 
No it's not enough for me! 
I want to live forever! 
Give me open eyes to see this is not enough for me!
