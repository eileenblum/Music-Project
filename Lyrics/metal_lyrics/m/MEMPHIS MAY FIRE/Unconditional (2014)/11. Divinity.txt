It's three o'clock in the morning,
you lie awake with a heavy heart
You're thinking, "What is the meaning?
Was I a waste? A mistake from the start?"
You just can't seem to remember
The last time anyone seemed to care
And all passion seems to wither
When it seems you have no purpose here

But you hold the power to be
The living, breathing purpose you were made to be
(Don't throw it away!)
It only takes one spark to start an everlasting fire in your heart

Destiny is different than a dream
Despite our failures and our shortcomings
We all have divine purpose to be nothing short of a miracle story

You hold the power to be
The living breathing purpose you were made to be
And it only takes one small spark
To start an everlasting fire in your heart
To start an everlasting fire in your heart
There is a plan and you're an important part

There is relief in the coming days
Even if you can't see it now
When you look back on the difference that you made
It will erase every second of doubt

Destiny is different than a dream
Despite our failures and our shortcomings
We all have divine purpose to be nothing short of a miracle story
Destiny is different than a dream
Despite our failures and our shortcomings
We all have divine purpose to be nothing short of a miracle story

I pray for clarity, for those who are questioning it all
I pray they'll hear the answers when they call
You are special, you are loved!
A perfect reflection of heaven above
And God makes no mistakes, you are a miracle story
A miracle story
And God makes no mistakes, you are a miracle story


I pray for clarity, for those who are questioning it all (it all, it all)
I pray they'll hear the answers when they call
And God makes no mistakes, you are a miracle story
And God makes no mistakes, you are a miracle story

I pray for clarity, for those who are questioning it all
I pray they'll hear the answers when they call
(A perfect reflection of heaven above...)
