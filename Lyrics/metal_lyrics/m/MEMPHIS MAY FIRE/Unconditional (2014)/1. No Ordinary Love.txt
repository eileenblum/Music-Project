Here I stand nothing more than a broken man
Staring death in the face
All my mistakes have got a hold on me again
Here we go, another day another fork in the road
I never know who to trust
Will someone just tell me which way to go?

I need a sign, I need a miracle!
I need to know that this is possible
I've just failed so many times
Is there any way I could make it right?
God, if you're there I need to hear you now!

Come back to me love, I forgive you
Oh how I've missed you!
Just know every time you run
I'll be right here waiting!

Yeah!

This is no ordinary love
Listen up, listen up!
This is no ordinary love
Listen up, this is unconditional

I'm so afraid to admit that you're real
Cause I'm afraid of what I might feel
When your words start to come to life
And it brings my demons into the light, but...

I know you're here
I shiver as you whisper in my ear
"Child have no fear"

Come back to me love, I forgive you
Oh how I've missed you!
Just know every time you run
I'll be right here waiting!

Come back to me love
I hope you know I'm always with you
Oh I forgive you!

We lose faith in things unseen
Unsure of what to believe
Just dying to be loved
When love's right in front of us

We give up on our hopes &amp; dreams
And let doubt take everything
The door will open when we realize
We don't hold the key

I tried to save myself but I failed!
But I failed!

Come back to me love, I forgive you
Oh how I've missed you!
Every time you run
I'll be right here waiting!

Come back to me love
I hope you know I'm always with you
I forgive you!
