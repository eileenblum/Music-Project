With every letter I read
I see their desperate cries to find the missing piece
They just want to believe
Someone can take away the burdens they carry
Who am I to be here?
I am no different than them
We are the same, you see?

I wear my heart on my sleeve
For everyone to see
The man I wanna be
And I just hope they see you when they look at me
'Cause you are everything that I need to be

My heart is heavy and torn
Weighed down by all my mistakes and the chains I've worn
A constant struggle with fear
Unsure if I was enough from the day I was born
But you see the beauty in my flaws
You pick me up when I fall
show me the way when I am lost
In the eye of the storm
You show me I'm not alone
And give me strength to carry on

I wear my heart on my sleeve
For everyone to see
The man I wanna be
I just hope they see you when they look at me
'Cause you are everything that I need to be

I wear my heart on my sleeve
For everyone to see
The man I wanna be
And I just hope they see you when they look at me
'Cause you are everything that I need to be

I wear my heart on my sleeve
For everyone to see
The man I wanna be
I just hope they see you when they look at me
'Cause you are everything (you are everything)
That I need to be (that I need to be)
