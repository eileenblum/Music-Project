(We are the youth, we are the future!) [x2]

I only sleep to dream about the day
We don't fall in line.
And everyone hears what we have to say
With no question why.
As long as there is breath inside our lungs
We should have a voice.
But we've been pushed aside because we're young and
Left without a choice.

Have they forgotten that? (We are the future!)

My generation is dying to be heard,
Dying to be heard and be understood.
But no one is listening! (No one is listening)

So me and my friends will be the voice for,
will be the voice for the ones you ignore.
And we'll be louder than ever before.
(Can you hear me?)

(We'll fight, fight, fight!)
For the ones without a voice.
(Fight, fight, fight!)
Until they pay attention.
(Fight, fight, fight!)
For the ones without a voice!
(Fight, fight, fight!)
We're gonna make them listen!

(Fight, fight, fight!) [x3]
We're gonna make them listen!

(Fight, fight, fight!) [x3]
We'll fight till they hear us out! [x2]

Have they forgotten that? We are the future!

My generation is dying to be heard,
Dying to be heard and be understood.
But no one is listening! (No one is listening)

So me and my friends will be the voice for,
will be the voice for the ones you ignore.
And we'll be louder than ever before.
(Can you hear me?)

We are the youth, we are the future.
Misunderstood!
We are the youth, we are the future!
We're dying to be heard!

We are the youth, we are the future!
Somebody pay attention!

(We are the youth, we are the future!)
Misunderstood!
(We are the youth, we are the future!)
We're dying to be heard!

What do you expect?
When you leave us empty handed and without respect?!
(Respect, respect)
What do you expect?
When you take away our voice and we have nothing left?!

Have they forgotten that? We are the future!

My generation is dying to be heard,
Dying to be heard and be understood.
But no one is listening! (No one is listening)

So me and my friends will be the voice for,
will be the voice for the ones you ignor
e.
And we'll be louder than ever before.
(Can you hear me?)

(We are the youth, we are the future!)
(We are the youth!)
Can you hear me?
