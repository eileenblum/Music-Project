I hit the bottom of my lowest lows
My darkest hours are the times I grow
And every time I am broken I know that it's only so I can be restored

I never would have found my way
If I didn't realize I was lost in the first place
Amazing grace how sweet the sound
I never could have picked myself up off the ground

Oh now I see (now I see)
It's not about the things I've done, but what you've done in me
Now I see fear is irrelevant 'cause you know my every need

I'm reaching out
You pull me out of the depths, I see you now
I'm letting go of the rest and I won't fear the fall
'Cause I know that you'll be there to catch me
I'll look to you when there's trouble at sea
'Cause I can walk on water when I believe
And now I know it's true, you are the answer to everything

How could I fear this heartbeat that beats for you?
How could I fear this heartbeat that beats for you?
I'm letting go of every fear I hold on to

Well I don't know what the future holds
But I know who holds it and it's beautiful
Every time that I fall short I'm so thankful I'm not in control
I'm reaching out I see you now
And I won't fear the fall 'cause I know that you'll be there

I'm reaching out
You pull me out of the depths, I see you now
I'm letting go of the rest and I won't fear the fall
'Cause I know that you'll be there to catch me
I'll look to you when there's trouble at sea
'Cause I can walk on water when I believe
And now I know it's true, you are the answer to everything
(The answer to everything
The answer to everything
The answer to everything)

When my thoughts take shape like a demon, I will rest in you (I will rest in you)
The peace I find in my quiet mind comes from knowing that your word is true
You are more than enough!
ANd now I'm certain that the best is yet to come (best is yet to come)
You are more than enough!
The best is yet to come

I'm reaching out
You pull me out of the depths, I see you now
I'm letting go of the rest and I won't fear the fall
'Cause I know that you'll be there to catch me
I'll look to you when there's trouble at sea
'Cause I can walk on water when I believe
And now I know it's true, you are the answer to everything
