[Music: Kloeppel, Jarvis]
[Lyrics: Kloeppel]

The world's unharnessed power
Utility of time
A loathsome wasting of the earth
As waves of darkness surge through shadows in my mind
A veils of the devil's design 
And I must know them
I must know it all

Through possession
I clench the unknown
And scrawl upon these walls
In frustration
I grind away my bones
And on the inside of my skull

A call
I'm calling on the fallen
They congregate!
Undulating in shadows of my mind
A veils of the devil's design

Ouroboros
A finite fallacy
A consummate machine 

A cycle serpent
Itself devouring
With my tacit knowledge circumvented
And I must know them
I must know it all

Transformation within my soul
Meine Seele ist verkauft
Transformation begs the toll
Vierundzwanzig Jahre in voller

Reigning through a power their knowledge did define
I pull the world out of its lull 
Conjuring the cull, existing out of time
I take the oath...
