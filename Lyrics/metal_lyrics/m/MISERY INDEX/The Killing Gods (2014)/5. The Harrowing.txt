[Lyrics: Kloeppel]

Old Hierarchies of race
A transnational scheme
Power set into place
A system of utility

The order to maintain 
These factories of death
Walls that do restrain
Autonomic
As they built it

This was the vision 
Poured into me

A hidden hand
Lifts the veil
An artifact
That does reveal
A knowledge base
But limited
Encrypted
Concealer's seal

To reveal
The concealer
To reveal
A concealer still

The act of mass unlearning
Requires a higher means
And when the fire starts burning
The crimson red is all see

A hidden hand
Lifts the veil
An artifact
That does reveal
A knowledge base
But limited
Encrypted
Concealer's seal

Mind inverted
I am siphoned into Sheol
Reconstitution 
For the harrowing of hell
Bathing in your blood
Eyes wide open
I bask in the blackness

Descend into the depths
And siphoned into Sheol
With the dwellers of death
For the Harrowing of hell

Bathing in your blood
Purified and clean
Ascend a killing god
Poised For the reaping

Descend into the depths
Siphoned into Sheol
A god amongst the dwellers of death

The cycle serpent
Now uncoiled
All souls are lost
In the yawning void

To sow the seed
And fulfill the pact
To succeed
A final act

A conqueror
Inescapable
A killing god
