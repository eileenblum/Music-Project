[Lyrics: Netherton]

Why should I care:
The writings on the wall - no future
Cynics sow disdain, as pious retroverts unrestrained 
What vision can ever rise from this worthless human waste?

Like ghosts from '68, a generation still lost in space
Narcissistic automatons, caressing techno-fetishes unknown
Maybe I'm deranged - a Herbert West inside of me
Hoping to raise the dead - to find some life in this species selfish-bred

Atavist!
As I watch your
Institutions decay, contradictions remain
Institutions decay, weakeners... so weakening

They bait, cast and reel, to the passive so ready to kneel
With hooks so firm in mouth, they carry forth on this path unbowed
So quick to turn away, so quick to unleash the blade
As cracks across the dam, still hold back a world we can't comprehend 

Atavist!
Institutions decay, contradictions remain
Institutions decay, weakeners... so weakening

Cut the cord and start the fire

Ass seers of oblivion, all color turns to black
Forfeit the unknown, upon the rack of circumstance
So goes the folly of man, a fool in a forest of fear
"As you like it," they will say, "... there's plenty more just like you here"
