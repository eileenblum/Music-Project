What Purpose Of Life Will Sustain Us
As The Days Of Our Youth Spiral Away
What Hope For Man Can We Extract Here
From This Order Above, Where Decisions Are Made

Don't Tell Me You Trust Them
Don't Tell Me They Care
There's A Reason We Stand Here In Silence
Like The Passive Before
We Embrace Our Despair
