From Unchallenged Doctrines Before
When "Manifest Destinies" Carved
Nations From Innocent Blood
That Soaks This Wretched Earth Yet More
To The Passing Of History's Dream
From Kingly To Corporate Elite
In Glory These Conqueror's Thrust
Their Pious Swords Of Empire

Their Colonies Staining The Map
Their Pawns Imposing The Class Division
Another Imperial Act
Cloaked In The Shroud Of "Liberation"

Is It Freedom's Mission Or The Fascist Vision?
Is It Christ Compassion Or Coerced Conversion?
Sanctified Industry And Savior Modernity!

Spreading Over Oceans
Crusading On Hypocrisy
This Modern Greed Ambassador
Comes Masked As Democracy
Your God Is Chosen

Is Oil The Blood Of Their Christ
Cold, Dripping And Black
As Each Corpse Pays To Enhance
Their Burning Lust For Opulence?
Holding The Cross In Their Hand
The Priests Of Capital Feast
And Devour The Fruit Of Their Land
In Consecrated Warlust

The Patriot's Honor's Unquestioned
As The Carrion Rots In His Backyard
And What Noble Intentions Are Not
Born From The Bottom Of Tyranny's Heart?

Is It Freedom's Mission Or The Fascist Vision?
Is It Christ Compassion Or Coerced Conversion?
Saving Humanity With Poverty's Liturgy!

On The Flag And Bible Stand
Their Moralistic Monarchy
With Red, White And Blood
Smeared Over Eyes Deceived
The Crowds Will Follow

Force Feeder Of Fiction And Lies
Your Nation Is Lost And Dead

Another Map Drawn, Another State
Yet Another Victim Of The Terror Fear Mandate
Another Page Turned, Another Book Burned
Onward Christian Soldiers, Let Them Burn!
