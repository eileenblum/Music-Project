Class is cancelled!

Counter-hegemonics,
Multitudes in swarm
On nations at the center
Who watch their world deform

This global insurrection was given birth by the ruling class

And the children of empire - whose world this is to take
Open up the Seventh Seal and watch the West decay... decay! [x2]

Apocalyptic riders, above black horse's hooves
Have come to reap their harvest, to taste their labor's fruits

O' begotten Caesar!
You can't deny what is theirs...
And quickly you forget
Just how YOUR West was won...

...then lost.
