Ignorance is bliss
The culprit of twist
The quintessence of spin
Their right legs shorter than their left

Barking fascist cur
In pursuit of his own shit
Parading as prophets
And on each word I fucking spit

As descents try to clean
The right wings fucking mess
Rupert Murdock buys,
And bill o'reily pounds his chest

The time has come for change
So for them i dedicate
For lack of objectivity
49 of hate
