You're lost in their gluttonous agenda
Built on a foundation of sand
Their tides wash away your perspective
The mouth that feeds forces the hand

More, More is what you need
And None, fucking nothing is what you get

You're gone as you stare at it blindly
They've got you numb to the bone
So pure, praying hard with your head in the sand
Baptized in the fucking glow

Broke, impoverished,
You're less than human
You're captivated
You're taken captive

The Wolves have pulled their wool over your eyes

Currents
The density of current affairs
Colliding in the vastless sky

The ebb and flow of balance
Of wealth

Alive

The magnitude of planets
In your personal life

You live a life
You lose
