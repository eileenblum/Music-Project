So steadfast in reinforcing the myth
Of a sovereignty so fictitious
They're in your home now spreading disease
Our nation slogging down on wounded knees
...Until they're dead

Battalions built on a mountain of lies
Taking heads, eloquent deception
Superseded and set aside
We watch the hills as they enter and then divide

We saw it
We bought it
From severed to delivered
The invasion has been
Predevised to pacify, and redefine

I can't hear them
And I won't listen
To lie frozen and slowly fade into the black

The seventh cavalry has arrived to divide our reservations
Dear ears to decide
To open fire, no compromise

Bleak Dakota, in a crimson snow
A Ghost dancer, in a grave unknown
Off in the wind, their shots resound
As we become, one with the ground

I can't hear them
And I won't listen
To lie frozen and slowly fade into the black
