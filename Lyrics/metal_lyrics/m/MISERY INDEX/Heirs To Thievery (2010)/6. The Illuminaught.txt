The illuminaught sharpening ubiquitous blades
Sycophants turning their knives
Conflating the past to the present
Deadbeat dregs dragged to a masterplan

It's written on cuneiform tablets
Your trapped within their daily madness
The final solution
Illuminaughts
Illumination

Push the pen
Conscience now
So, push the pen
Through the centuries
Through your grandfather's blood
Conflating the past to the present
Sacred bonds perpetuate a masterplan

Cuneiform tablets
The daily madness
The final solution
Illuminaughts
Illumination

Right at the street, tentacles of ritualized fear tame your cognition
From birth, right from the start, illumination shaped your paradigm
A relationship based on manipulations
Tapping into your mind

Fear ritualized to control

Cuneiform tablets
The daily madness
The final solution
Illuminaughts
Illumination
