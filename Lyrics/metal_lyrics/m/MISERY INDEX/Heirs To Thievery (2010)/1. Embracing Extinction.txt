We process the facts, and choke on the math
Yet we can't come to terms with ourselves
Gorge belly up to the table of wants
It's "all you can eat" after all!

Embracing extinction, what higher form of life,
Destroys his creations?... how far we've come to fall

Diet of all things, consumption run amok
Dionysian days undone

We open the earth, to shit in our graves
We rest on our laurels attained
Bacchanal feasts, long out of date
For two-legged beasts unrestrained

Embracing extinction, what higher form of life,
Destroys his creations?... how far we've come to fall

Diet of all things, consumption run amok
Dionysian days...undone
