[Japanese Bonus Track]Alright

Walking down the street late one night
Got a hunger you just can't fight
It's a dangerous dance
Wearing Satan's underpants

Don't lose the burning desire
Gonna feel that ass on fire

White knuckle grip
Just a little sting
Low and behold

The devil's onion ring
The devil's onion ring
The devil's onion ring

Don't you ever let go
Of that leather cheerio
Sold your soul for just one thing
The motherfuckin'
Devil's onion ring

The Devil's onion ring

Yabba dabba doo
Yabba dabba doo
Chumowna
Yabba dabba doo
C'mon c'mon c'mon
Yabba dabba doo

Alright yeah!
Devil's onion ring
