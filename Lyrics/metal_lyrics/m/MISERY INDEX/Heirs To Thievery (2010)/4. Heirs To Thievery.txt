Disseminating myths upon a passive youth
Lets look back upon, some long-enshrouded truths
Where fables often tell, of tyrannies undone
As good guys all wear white, and wars are always won

Sweep away the dust from books carved so clean,
Glaring, stark omissions, rapacity unseen
What of foul deception?
Treaties gone ignored?
Unjust annexations, and rough-riding hordes?
Why prevaricate?

Heirs to thievery

From Grande to St Lawrence, a nascent power heaved
Monroe Doctrine, Manifest Destiny decreed
Push to the Pacific, across the open see
Eliminate the natives (and leave them a museum!)

Expansion had an engine - the slavery of man
From Cuba to Manila, we solidified our plan

Den of fucking thieves

Heroes, dripping out from texts as Gods
Liars, fueling fables, taught as axioms
