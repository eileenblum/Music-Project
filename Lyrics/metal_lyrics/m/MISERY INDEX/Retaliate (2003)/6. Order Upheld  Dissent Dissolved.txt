The triumph of boredom in everday life carries the wounded back to the frontline
These starving men will fill your cities and bring their broken dreams to market

All done
Stuffed and overfed
Contained and cross- examined
Robbed of all crestivity
Each temple is built to cave in
What life in the realm of dead things?
What life in self- built prisons?
Divide and welcome the conqueror
Spectate the spectacle- unleashed!

Order upheld
Dissent Dissolved

Inject
The image overrides
What songs can come from dead hearts?
Reason is the modern antichrist
Where logic rapes all passion
These words that are never said aloud undo the fabric frozen
Revealing the daily sodomy- this course has NOT been chosen

Order Upheld
Dissent Dissolved
