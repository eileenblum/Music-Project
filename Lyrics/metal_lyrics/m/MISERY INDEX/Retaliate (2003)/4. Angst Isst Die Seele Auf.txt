[Anxiety Eats The Soul Up]

Thrust into this competition naked and undone
Back to back
Yet divided on our own
Fear breeding fear
Exploding pressures on
We're locked away in self-made chains

Run out through the windows and into the streets
Terror abounds as each man lives in fear
Dread consumes their day
The public is passive
Inactive
And lame
Lock up the doors and let out the wolves
A fratricidal race
Given the chance you'd sit down to eat
Yet conciousness is sacrificed
This alter is never short on heads
Stare in his eyes
Your brother - this man
Yet your fear will breed resentment
Why can't you say a word?

Zu Hause wie im Krieg,
Waffen und Hass zuhauf

Casualties of human life drift in the crowds
They're standing on the margins - nullified
Outside the world keeps turning under the sun
While inside the sould is boiling over

This hate for the other is hate for yourself
The cancer condition
The dead-end ambition
You'll eat yourself alive
Submit to the anger
The coming of vengeance
The cult of uncaring
The chaos of living
And face this world alone
The hooks in your mouth now you'll swallow the bait
Distorting your vision
You'll drink from their poison
So ripened for this fall
You take from the worst and give up the best
But never forget you're a human being...you breathe
But can you think?

Zu Hause wie im Krieg
Waffen und Hass zuhauf
In den Kopfen nur Furcht
Angst isst die Seele auf

The truth is something made
Not something that's found
So burn all inhibitions to the ground
These politics of dread are a hammer to the head
A life of fear is life among the dead...
These barriers are built for us to tear them down.
