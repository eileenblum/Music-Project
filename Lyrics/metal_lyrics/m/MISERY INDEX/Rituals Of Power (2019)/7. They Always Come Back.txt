[Music: Netherton and Jarvis, lyrics: Netherton]

These bastards never die
They just slip and crawl through the fallout filth
Not one will deny
The hairless apes achieved what their god designed

As they wake from seventeen years entombed, dawn of the Necrocene arrived
Spawn of nuclear waste, unearthed from ashes they arise.
Offal of earth expelled, cast right out from her festering wounds
Arc of time beset, this cadaveric discretion

Rise, above, the archetype of man, a septic race is born
Bleed and purge, a lesson never learned, like black, hissing roaches...

They always, come back
They always, come back... again

Carved out from ice
Parasites of neo-neolithic age
Dregs of pestilence
Children of the aftermath

Rise, above, the archetype of man, a septic race is born
Bleed and purge, a lesson never learned, like black, hissing roaches...

They always, come back
They always, come back

Cryptic lifeforms and crumbling icons
Ancestors, infected, they spread like viral fire
Embalming, dissolving, the meek inherit nothing

Scumrot humans, storming over, arctic deserts,
A brave, new, world to conquer
And spread their seeds in virgin waste... end all

Spiral out, their dead-end lives, as carrion calls echo on
Acid fields, rivers of tar, endlessly... they always come back
