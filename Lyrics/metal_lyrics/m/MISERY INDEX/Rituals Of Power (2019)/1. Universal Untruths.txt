[Music: Morris, Jarvis, and Kloppel, lyrics: Netherton]

This is a code red
This is the crown of ire
As we decline
Into the void of inveracity

Where no one is to blame
And nothing's ever real
And death is what unites us... in fear

As time dissolves
Inside a blur of fragments
And we decline
Into the black of unreality

A fundamental flaw
A system overload
Of means without ends
We reap what we deserve
