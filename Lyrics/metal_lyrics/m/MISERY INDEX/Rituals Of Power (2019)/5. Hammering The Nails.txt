[Music: Netherton and Jarvis, lyrics: Netherton]

Calls of distress echo through the maze
Whose name on the list is next?
This caustic derision, the abject dearth
As we collapse in this open-ended cage

Now is all we have,
Yet blind we dance into the void
As we follow the one who leads from the rear
Hail to the chief: megalomaniac!

And we're hammering the nails down
As we each die clinging to the lies that hold our world in place

One by one, we reach the precipice
As progeny of vice and avarice
Bleak is the vision, the cult end-time
These are the days of the faithless god

And we're hammering the nails down
As we each die clinging to the lies that hold our world in place

Rivalsânot equals, all against all
Compassion rendered null and void

Breach and division, moral charades
Absurd inquisitions, sanity fades
We fake dissent, we breed deceit
Each fuels the other endlessly

And we're hammering the nails down
As we each die clinging to the lies that hold our world in place
And we're hammering the nails down
As we each die clinging... to our lies
