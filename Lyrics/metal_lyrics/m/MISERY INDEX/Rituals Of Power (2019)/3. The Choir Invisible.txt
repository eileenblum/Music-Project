[Music: Kloppel and Jarvis, lyrics: Netherton]

We are, the ones you fear, breakers of your grand illusion
Exiled, dispossessed, your sown-seeds reaped and left abandoned

God forsaken, left adrift, detritus ripped and torn asunder
Shunned like, rodent hordes, human lives that wane and wander
You said, "never again"â¦
Does that keep your conscience clean?

We are disposable, the choir invisible
The last in line to join, the choir invisible

We flee, blight and filth, so far beyond your gates and walls
Nameless, namenlos, unknown, innominado â naught!

Exiled, souls detested, so riven with abject despair
Blank stares, open mouths, our stifled screams you'll never hear
Toss, the coin, we wait our turn, until the boatman calls

We are disposable, the choir invisible
The last in line to join, the choir invisible
â¦down to the afterworld

Sinking, we slip into the black, of our briny grave
We die (just another tick on your news feed)
Wailing, such a mournful sound, underneath the waves
Draggedâ¦ into the deep

We are disposable, the choir invisible
The last in line to join, the choir invisible
â¦down to the afterworld
