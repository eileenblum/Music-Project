[Music: Morris, Jarvis, and Kloppel, lyrics: Netherton]

Captivate, prevaricate, the worst is yet to come
Just zero-sum directives, from silver, forked tongues
A monumental fall, I stop, stare and contemplate how it ends...

Crushed in between, underneath the wheel
Do I have a future, in this desert of the real?
Slow atrophy, schizophrenic dreams
Do I need a conscience, in this nihilist regime?

Sowing, seeds of distress, left, right, through the center
Reveal the hidden hand, as it propagates vicious and false incentive

Decline and FallâThe spear of Osiris
Decline and FallâThe kiss of oblivion
Decline and FallâThe cult of deception
Decline... and Fall

No ties that bind, except the will to live
Do I have a reason, something more than hate to give?
Apex achiever, or food for the worms?
Will I even care, once this world begins to burn?

Sowing, seeds of distress, left, right, through the center
Reveal the hidden hand, as it propagates vicious and false incentive

Decline and FallâThe spear of Osiris
Decline and FallâThe kiss of oblivion
Decline and FallâThe cult of deception
Decline... and Fall

In this, dead institution, nowhere to go but down
Another day in the status quo, another drop in the well of wasted hopes
Orphans, in narcosis, longing for a past that never was
You're all dead to me, as lifeless as a corpse ground to dust
Insects, entombed, the woe of time and doom
I spit and curse each day I walk this blighted earth
