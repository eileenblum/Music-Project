We revel in our treason, our catalyst for change
We don't wait for answers,
We laugh, seize, and live our days
Embracing our sedition,
Crawling off our knees
As John Brown -patriots,
Who force the world we want to see

TRAITORS!
Who you'd call a traitor,
Is the son of libertad
La unica esperanza
With no master and no god
"Freedom-haters", agitators?
What would they call Thomas Paine?
Founding fathers
Praised as martyrs
Or terrorists by another name?

TRAITORS!
What you call the Nation-State
Is fiction in itself
Agreed upon illusion
Enforced by violence - ruled by wealth
This land is fucking your land,
And not through them defined
By fucking flags on SUVs
Or Superbowl half-times

TRAITORS!
