Incubation, mass extinction, total annihilation, bring on the just desserts
No justice, no mercy, no god, no worry,
There's plenty of water from pissing the wine

Put up your fist, put up your fist
Work your whole life, all you get is this
Put up your fist, put up your fist
Work your whole life, and you die with nothing

"Suicide is painless it brings on many changes"
Enjoy the wealth of losing all
I realize I mean nothing, these efforts are for naught,
And I feel a thousand feet tall

A bankrupt broken shepherd, becomes the arbiter,
Making the beds for us all
