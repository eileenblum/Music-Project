Burn, burn, Hollywood, burn...

Fetishized model-whores, images, airbrushed hardcore
Harlots, Hiltons, egoistic, wanton waifs
Plastic, paramours, skank pawns of culture war
Fake tits, facelifts
300 years of "Enlightenment" comes to this?

(Voltaire is laughing, and Russeau is puking!)
The joke is on us all
Their faces dissolve into thin air
They are trite and listless
They are empty vessels
They are ink and pixels... yet they walk the earth as Gods

Practitioner professionals of sloth, so fucking worthless
This worshiped parasite-celeprosy, let's start the fire
And melt those plastic faces into dust
The carrion of Leisure-class fueled waste
This narcissistic venerated filth
The icons of a clueless populace
The idols of a nation in decline
