In the name of gods
You prey on desperately
Like a parasite
Here lies the consequence

Six billion arms around me
In sweet denial

With burden to bear
Atlas recoiling
In terror

Six billion arms around me
Destined to wake

Light dims on civilization
Gathered 'round dying embers
And with a steady hand
Long last we're thrown into the sun

Spiraling cataclyst
Deafening, down to this
Ascending, world in tow
Telling all, eternal woe

Throw it all, make me strong
Never right, never wrong

One and all alive
Disposed
