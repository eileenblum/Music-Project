From 'shock and awe' to 'cut and run'
the parlance of our times
is shut your mouth or ship it out
"We don't need you traitorous swine!"

Tropes that tie the noose-
from mediating whores
to bastard criticizers
who dare to question W's war

Vagaries of verse
In sound-bite serenade
The Crawford-Texas curse?
Veracity is vilified again!

Boiling under pressure
quixotic aspirations hem the wheel
and the blindness of the captain
steers Jesusland through icy waters still

full steam ahead!!!
