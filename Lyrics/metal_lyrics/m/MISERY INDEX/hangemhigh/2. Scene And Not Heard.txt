Crawling out en masse, they gather
Turkey flop platoons, will scatter
Drag-queen ninjas dance, pirouetting
Always 'scene' and never heard, these core eyesores

What have we learned, in seventeen years
of glam-rock in the grave?
-That history repeats itself...again

...And right on cue, Pavlov's dogs will dance

"Like dude, this band just sucked until they broke it down!"
...its coming yet again, I think I feel it, its coming right now...dance you fashion fuckers!

Brie Brie Brie! (It's a fucking good cheese!) You gotta love it!

Always posing, my space whoring
mascara and sleeve tattoo
narcissists in 'youth small' clothing
...next Nirvana, where are you?
