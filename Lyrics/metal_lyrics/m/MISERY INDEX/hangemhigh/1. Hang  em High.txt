Hang em 'til the last ones dead
Hang em 'til the last ones dead
Hang em 'til the last ones dead
Let them know we're coming out to kill

Behind gentle eyes, beneath Brooks Brother's gray
the cold calculations of the beast burn hard

For West Virginia miners
and CONAIE in Ecuador
for Delhi child labor
and Niger Delta poor

we kill
we kill
we kill
we kill
....die!!!

Let's hang em fucking high.
