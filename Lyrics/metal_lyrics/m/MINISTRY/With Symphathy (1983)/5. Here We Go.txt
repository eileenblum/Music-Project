this one's fought the trendy set
this one's fought the feds
this one's fought the people baby
and tried to ruin my plans

this one's fought the radio
this one's fought the press
this one's fought the people baby
and made my life such a mess

woah... here we go (we gotta go, we gottta go)

this one's fought the little girls
this one's fought the boys
this one's fought the people baby
and told me all their lies

woah... here we go (we gotta go, we gottta go)

i will press the button
and they will go away
but don't forget to say your prayers
before i blow them all away, i say

woah... here we go (we gotta go, we gottta go)

woah... here we go (we gotta go!)
