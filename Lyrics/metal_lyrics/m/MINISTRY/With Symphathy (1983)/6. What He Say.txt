i've seen many countries
argue about human lives
but one thing that stays the same is
the clubs are always full at night

pick out any far-out place
like kenya or swaziland
doesn't matter what the place
they'll still be dancing to the band

(mumble mumble jumble)
(garble warble farble)
(mumble mumble jumble)
(garble warble farble)
(mumble mumble jumble) what he say?
(garble warble farble)
(mumble mumble jumble) what he say?
(garble warble farble) let's dance!

say you've found a homeland? (move to it, move to it)
say you've found a clubland? (get to it, get to it)
now you've got a song? (groove to it, groove to it)
got to find a partner (just get to it, get to it)

(mumble mumble jumble)
(garble warble farble)
(mumble mumble jumble)
(garble warble farble)
(mumble mumble jumble) what he say?
(garble warble farble)
(mumble mumble jumble) what he say?
(garble warble farble) let's dance!

let's dance!

i've seen many a race of people
argue many things before
but there is one language that
gets you understood for sure

not a language of the mouth
it's only for the feet
grab a russian by the hands
and he will feel the need
that's right!

(mumble mumble jumble)
(garble warble farble)
(mumble mumble jumble)
(garble warble farble)
(mumble mumble jumble) what he say?
(garble warble farble)
(mumble mumble jumble) what he say?
(garble warble farble) let's dance!

let's dance!
