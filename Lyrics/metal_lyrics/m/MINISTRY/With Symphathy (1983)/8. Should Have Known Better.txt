so many years i just suffered through the tears
knowing one day i'd wake up wishing i had never met her
but as the time goes by my hope keeping playing every day
as i laugh to myself, 'i just should have known better'

there's no more laughter as i think about the other girl
it's a slap in my face as i'm opening her letter
she's doing fine now with two kids and another man
as i cry out loud, 'i just should have known better'

she was the reason i was living every day
i would ride upon a white horse in my quest to try and find
her
but now it's too late, i don't care if i die tonight
cos a voice keeps ringing in my heart, 'i should have known
better'

i learned my lesson this time
lonliness and a broken heart
should've known right from the start
