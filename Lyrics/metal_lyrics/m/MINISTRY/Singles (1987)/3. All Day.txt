well i'm hiding my eyes from the morning sun
and i keep on working till the work is all done
but a voice in my head keeps ticking away
as the sweat's hosed down from yet another day
well he works hard
and he lives hard
and he breaks his back without nothing to gain
while the boss man sits around and drinks champagne

all day (you work and you work and you work and)
in life, there's just one transition
all day (you work and you work and you work and)
in life, there's just one decision

well i'm peeling the blisters off my working hand
is that what it takes to make you understand?
that it's something you read, not something you meant
to be slaving away without a shred of integrity
he worked hard
and he lived hard
and he broke his back without nothing to say
while the man in control was just laughing away

all day (you work and you work and you work and)
in life, there's just one transition
all day (you work and you work and you work and)
in life, there's just one decision

was it something you read?
was it something you meant?
was it something you said?
or was it heaven sent?

all day (you work and you work and you work and)
in life, there's just one transition
all day (you work and you work and you work and)
in life, there's just one decision
