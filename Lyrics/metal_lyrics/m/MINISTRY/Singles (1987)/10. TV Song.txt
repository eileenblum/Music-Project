tell me something i don't know
show me something i can't use
push the button
connect the goddamned dots
live-in thief in my bedroom bathroom
commodity sodomy glass autonomy
promise everything take it all away
give it a rest
you're lying through your teeth
you're lying through your teeth
who what which why who
when did you say the earth would stop turning?
why did you say we would all start burning?
when should i make a pledge?
should i listen to the voices in my head?
connect the goddamned dots
connect the goddamned dots
who am i trying to impress?
who could care less?

Thanks to csatterl for correcting track #8 lyrics.
