red hand takes a purple terror
love knows these knots
when we escape from the madhouse
we will... hunt down

tonight we murder

between the battle of pain and hate
we will mate, but not for our time
we'll to hate and to take
to dethrone

tonight

tonight we murder

between the pain, the battle of pain
love will not untie these knots
all twisted up and filled with hate
he will not untie these nuts

tonight we murder

i murder
tonight we murder
