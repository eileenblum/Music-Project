love -

love is like an open hand
stings a little when it lands
hold me closer
hold me tighter
hold me so damn close that my heart's on fire
it's a fantasy
it's a nightmare
and the whole damn world is walking round in theirs
i said love -

love is like a razor blade
double edge and double pain
hold me closer
hold me tighter
when i rip your flesh and the pain is fresh
it's a fantasy
it's a nightmare
and the whole damn world doesn't seem to care
i said love -

love is like a butcher knife
double sharp for single lives
hold me closer
hold me tighter
as the lights go out and we start to shout
it's a fantasy
it's a nightmare
with a big black bruise and a handful of hair
i said love -
