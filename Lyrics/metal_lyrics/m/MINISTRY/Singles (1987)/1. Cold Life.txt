cold

you know the yolk it's spreading from
you laugh as people scatter 'bout
surrounded by a veil of stars
you realize your life is dark

earth gets colder every day
if scientists could have their way
they'd study us from far away
and watch as people's minds decay

cold

your body's in the hands of fools
with swimming pools and low iq's
there's nothing to see, nothing to do
buy your stocks and sell your jewels

bill collectors stole my mail
my wife and kids are all for sale
i hope to god i go to jail
and no one can come up with bail

cold life

i can't control my buried thoughts
the slightest thing makes me distraught
i'm like the people i once fought
my every action's being bought

robot trainers earn their pay
as mutant kids go out to play
it's such a pretty pretty day
with orange nights and days of grey

cold

i've now become a nervous wreck
i'm getting closer to my death
i keep expecting my last breath
as all my friends just laugh and jest

the earth is such a filthy place
and human such an awful race
and i'd rather live in outer space
where death goes at a slower pace

cold life
