withered rope you hang what's empty
can't remain to put it simply
in time
cry the hollow words to sing
with false disguise smothered hope
fly from sorrow for a new
divine tomorrow

i just don't want to know anymore

life shifts up and down
everybody knows it's wrong why
don't you care?
now do it seem fair?
it's not in the rhyme or reason
so it goes with every season
crawl to top fall through bottom
first hand love is really rotten
slice of life find what's plenty
inch towards a sanctuary
light with me inside the
womb i know everyone
everybody knows it's me it's my voice,
my voice cries out obscenity sightless eye
regard my past sometimes it should

i just don't want to know anymore.
