Congregation, please be seated and open your prayer guides to the Book Of Revelations, Psalm 69

"I feel like my heart is being touched by Christ." [4x]

"Liar, blasphemer. Praise Jesus. Praise Jesus." [2x]

And now it's time for us to give a little love back to God

Drinking the blood of Jesus
Drinking it right from his veins
Learning to swim in the ocean
Learning to prowl in his name

The body of Christ looked unto me
A preacher with cock in his hand
He wants you to suck on the Holy Ghost
And swallow the sins of man

Psalm 69

"I feel like my heart is being touched by Christ." [2x]

"Liar, blasphemer. Praise Jesus. Praise Jesus."
"Liar, blasphemer. Praise Jesus. Praise Jesus. Praise Jesus. Praise Jesus."

The invisible piss of the Holy Ghost
Comes down like acid rain
They're making a profit off terminal guilt
The scavengers go on parade

The promise of life and eternity
Is used just like the sword
He'll filled you up with his Devil's cock
And he'll come in the name of the Lord

"Liar, liar, liar, liar."
"Goddamn preacher."

The way to succeed and the way to suck eggs
Stop it!
