blood keeps drinking away
certain of its destination
driving through new orleans at night
gotta find a destination

just one fix

life keeps slipping away
fighting in a war with damnation
poised, keep cutting away
i'm looking in through to salvation

just one fix

like if i boarded a train
trying to take in another station
join us and the choice will be made
unless we kill the lie as a nation

just one fix
