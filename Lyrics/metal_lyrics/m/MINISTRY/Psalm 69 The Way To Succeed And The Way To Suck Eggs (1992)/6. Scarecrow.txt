staring in the face of condemnation
laughter fills the sky instead of rain

live my life alone in resignation
arms outstretched for those who cannot say

scarecrow

crucified and left in isolation
pictures of our lost morality

scarecrow

eyeless stares invite this whole damnation
rotting corpse of inhumanity

scarecrow
