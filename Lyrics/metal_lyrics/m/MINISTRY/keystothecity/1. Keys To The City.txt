Let's go, Black Hawks!
Let's go, Black Hawks!
Let's go, Black Hawks!
Want to rock, want to rock, want to rock
Want to rock, want to rock, want to rock
Want to rock, want to rock, want to rock
Want to rock, want to rock, want to rock

If you're a Black Hawk, you skate with pride
So many legends have played for our side
Mikita! Hull! Esposito! Savard!
To name a few, that's why we play so hard
Want to rock, want to rock, want to rock
Want to rock, want to rock, want to rock
Want to rock, want to rock, want to rock
Want to rock, want to rock, want to rock

We're gonna get the keys to the city
Gonna give it all in every game
We're gonna get the keys to the city
I want to hear you scream our name

"Let's go! Black Hawks!"
"Let's go! Black Hawks!"

Our players bleed red, white and black
We play for the crest, and not the name on the back
The best fans in the NHL
United Center - it's time to raise hell!
Want to rock, want to rock, want to rock
Want to rock, want to rock, want to rock
Want to rock, want to rock, want to rock
Want to rock, want to rock, want to rock

We're gonna get the keys to the city
Win the cup and have a big parade
We'll bring the cup back home to Chicago
Show them all how hockey is playedâ¦real hockey is played

"Let's go! Black Hawks!" Fighta, fighta, fighta
"Let's go! Black Hawks!" Skate-a, skate-a, skate-a
"Let's go, Black Hawks!" Oh, what a team
"Let's go, Black Hawks!" Oh, what a team
