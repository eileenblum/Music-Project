Thieves, thieves and liars, murderers
Hypocrites and bastards and lechers
"Get up!  Get up, get on your feet!"
Hey, thanks for nothing
Morals in the dust
Two-faced intellectual cripples
No trust
"We are all fighting for a new race of man
Not the race of these pigs
And their racist society"

Take off!
Thieves!  Liars! [x6]
Inside, outside, which side we don't know
My side, your side, their side, we don't know
Who started it?  Who started it?
Who started abandoning abolishing hate?
Who started it?  Who started it?
Who started affecting freedom?
Inside, outside, which side we don't know
My side, your side, their side, we don't know
You're like a great big fucking cock
Just waiting to get squeezed
"We're gonna rip this mother fucker off
We're gonna tear this mother fucker down"

"Get up!  Get up, get on your feet!"
Breathe!  Forfeit erection!
Toxic our injection
Geriatric fuck-fest
With a scintillating lie
"I hope they realize this is their last goddamn chance!"
"Kill him!"  "Kill, kill, kill ..."
Take off!

Thieves!  Liars! [x4]
Inside, outside, which side we don't know
My side, your side, their side, we don't know
Who started it?  Who started it?
Who started the fight between color and hate?
Who started it?  Who started it?
Who started affecting freedom?
Inside, outside, which side we don't know
My side, your side, their side, don't wanna know
You're like a really big hit of acid just waiting to be taken
"Power to the people!"  "Sieg heil!"
"Power to the people!"  "Police officer!"
"Kill, kill, kill ..."  "You will not kill!"
"I like peace, you want peace"
"I can't hear you, I still can't hear you!"
