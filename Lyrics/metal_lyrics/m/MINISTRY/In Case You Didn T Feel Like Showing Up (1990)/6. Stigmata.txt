You ran out of lies!
You ran out of lies!  Lies!
Stronger than reason, stronger than life
The only truth I know is the look in your eyes
The look in your eyes!
Just like a car crash, just like a knife
My favorite weapon is the look in your eyes
You ran out of lies!

You ran out of life!
You ran out of lies!
Get out of my life!

And I'm chewing on glass and tasting my fingers
I'm not the one who's run out of lies, lies!
You ran out of life!
You ran out of time!

Judging my faith and walking on splinters
I lost my soul to the look in your eyes
Your eyes!  You ran out of lies!
Ran out of time...
Stigmata!  You ran out of lies!

Oh, you have empty eyes!  (yes)
Oh, you have empty lies!  (yes)
They told me nothing
Nothing but lies!
Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!
Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!
Fuck me!  Fuck me!
Fuck you!  Fuck you!
Fuck everyone!  Fuck the church!
Fuck Jesus!  Fuck Mary!
Fuck the Jews!  Fuck the Bhuddists!
Fuck the Hindus!  Fuck George Bush!
Fuck his ugly wife!  Fuck Tipper Gore!
Fuck everyone!  Fuck Gorbachev!
Fuck Noriega!  Fuck all these assholes!
Fuck you!  Fuck me!  Fuck all of you!
Stigmata!  Stigmata!  Stigmata!  Stigmata!
They told me nothing but lies!
Lies!  Lies!  Lies!  Lies!
