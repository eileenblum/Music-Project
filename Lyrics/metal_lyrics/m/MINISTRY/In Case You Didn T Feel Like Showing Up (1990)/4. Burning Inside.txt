Will these dreams still follow me
When the dark comes, curing time
Can't you see it off in the sky
It kicks you in the face and sucks you dry
You never had the answers and now you tell me the facts of life
I really couldn't be bothered with you,
Get out of my face, watch me die
Burning inside!  Burning inside!

Absolution and a frozen rule
All the dreams of men below
I try to grab it, but the touch is hot
The mirror collapses, the image may not
I'm scared of the darkness in light
I scare myself because I know I'm right
I see the evil, the savage eye
That cuts right through the sky
Burning inside!  Burning inside!  [x5]

Call me the mantra with a blade in his skin
Holding demons within
I feel the pain as they start to decay
The lesson never fades away
Don't need no shadows, turn them away
Become a man through the window pane
Another slave and a victim of fate
Another lesson in hate
Burning inside!  Burning inside! [x5]

Burning inside! [x14]
It's burning Inside!
