[Jourgensen / Victor / Raven / Bell, Words: Bell / Jourgensen]

As the future unfolds in the end of days
Judgment of our times in biblical ways
Our man made gods, genocide is faith
Idea warfare has been engaged
Cannot trust your fellow man at all these days
Sycophants out looking to get paid
Images burned into my face
Pangs of Distress salt my flesh to flay

I constantly fear everything I see
Blood is the fist of authority
Pestilence is my rabid dog unchained
Another road sign marks the end of days
I disregard those who govern me
I hate all of this treachery
I numb my mind and try to walk away
Toward the trail of tears and to the end of days

Face down on pavement and drunk at the end of my days
I hang from a noose that was made to slowly decay
The pangs of distress salt my flesh to slowly flay
Face down on pavement and drunk at the end of my days
The end of days
