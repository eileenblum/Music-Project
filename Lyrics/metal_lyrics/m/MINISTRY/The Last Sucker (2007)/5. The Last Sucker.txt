[Jourgensen / Victor, Words: Jourgensen]

Born and raised in the USA
I got a different type of DNA
I got a bloodline from Texas to Maine
We run the world like a parlor game

I got twins and a Stepford wife
I never had to work a day in my life
I never studied but got my degree
I never had to with my family tree

Now I'm the last sucker
Now I'm the last one
No longer in charge
Of anyone!

I got others tell me what to say
I'm like an actor in a tragic play
They give me speeches
I cant understand
It doesn't matter
As long as no one else can

Now I'm the last sucker
Now I'm the last one
No longer in charge
Of anyone!

Last sucker sorry fucker
Nice try
Last sucker Sorry fucker
Bye bye

Now it's my turn for something to say
You made me king so I could have my way
The people hate me and I don't know why
They hate me more with each and every lie

Now I'm the last sucker
Now I'm the last one
No longer in charge
Of anyone!

Last sucker Sorry fucker
Nice try
Last sucker Sorry fucker
Bye bye
