[Jourgensen / Victor, Words: Jourgensen]

Greed
Power
Corruption

One thing's for certain
We fucking work for Haliburton
One thing is clear
They're the fucking reason why were here
Who the fuck's in charge?
Cause no one seems to want the job
Haliburton soldiers
Overrun by angry mobs

Our Deaths Our Guts No Glory! No Glory

Greed
Power
Corruption

Blackwater and Bechtel
Taking us down a path to hell
Dying for nothing
Except to make their pockets swell
Mission accomplished
Bush is having fun again
The only thing accomplished
Is making money for his friends

Our Deaths, Our Guts, No Glory! No Glory

Greed
Power
Corruption

The congress, the senate
I guess they just don't get it
An act of war was signed
And no one even read it
The public, the papers
We're on to all your schemes
So's the Army, the Air Force,
The Navy and Marines

Our Deaths Our Guts No Glory! No Glory

Greed
Power
Corruption
