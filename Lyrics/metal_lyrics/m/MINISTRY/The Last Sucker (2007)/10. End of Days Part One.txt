[Jourgensen / Victor / Raven / Bell, Words: Bell / Jourgensen]

Judgment day's upon us and I see no one cares.
Lies for death in pools of blood and I'm stoned with fear.
A trigger happy finger solves a problem not a prayer.
I see this world falling apart and I fucking swear

It is the end of days
It is the end of days
We've clearly lost our way

Revelations, dissipation, condemnation
dissolution, do you feel like you're under a gun?
Desperation, condemnation, indignation, terror nation
That's what the world is today!
Hey! Hey!

It is the end of days
It is the end of days
We've clearly lost our way

Judgment day is upon us, I don't care.
Judgment day is upon us, do ya fear?
I'm in a world of shit, I don't care!
