[Jourgensen / Victor / Bell, Words: Bell / Jourgensen / Victor]

Can you feel the pressure of life? (I can feel it)
You surviving through the mess and the strife? (I'm trying)
Do you feel that you're living a lie? (Goddamn)
Are you consumed by the passionate crime? (I am)
Become a rascal and a scandalous type
And I just can't take this anymore!

I can feel it
I can feel the pressures of this life!

Turn away don't show your face
Forget your future is lost
Consumed by rage, eyes full of hate
I pray for holocaust
God damned us all to hell to make us pay
Abandoned into immorality
I hate today, I hate your tomorrow
I hate the way that no soul seems
to fucking care no more

I can feel it
I can feel the pressures of this life

Live fast, die in a crash!
Live fast, die in a crash!
