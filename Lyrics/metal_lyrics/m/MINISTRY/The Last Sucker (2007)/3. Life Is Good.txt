[Jourgensen /Quirin, Words: Jourgensen]

What do you say to the ones you love
About the violence you've seen?
Third time back from the war in Iraq
A never ending dream
Bodies and limbs scattered all over town
It's all I ever see
Come back home to the same ol' shit
There's nothing here for me

Life is good!

What do you say to the best of friends
When they ask what it's like?
I tell them I kill everything that moves
Within my rifle site
I look into the eyes of my unborn child
And I tell you what I see
The same damn eyes as a day old corpse
On a highway full of IEDs

Life is good!

What do you say to the guy on the street
Who wants to shake your hand
I'd rather take him down then talk to him later
You wouldn't understand
I didn't ever really wanna be this way
But this is what I've become
Can't wait to see my unit again
To live and die by the gun

Life is good!
