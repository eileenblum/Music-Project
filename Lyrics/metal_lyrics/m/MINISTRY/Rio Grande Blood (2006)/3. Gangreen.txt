[Feat. Sgt. Major]

I'm the ministry of death
Ahoorah!
I'm a marine I'm hard I'm trained
I'm part of a brotherhood no hackers allowed

You scumbag sonofabitch
You bubble-butted bulging maggot piece of shit
You syphilitic Siberian sonofabitch
I'm gonna screw your head off
I'm gonna stick my dick in your nose
I'm gonna sell you to queers
I'm gonna bury you like dog shit
Ahoorah!

[Verse 1]
M16's for Jesus Christ
Humpin' my rifle like I hump your wife
Boots on the ground and head held high
I'm ready to kill and I'm ready to die

[Chorus]
Gangreen
Gangreen
Devil dogs to the front of the fight
Gonna kill everything in sight

[Verse 2]
Born again hard and born again mean
Trained by the corps to be a killing machine
And if I die for the US of A
Pin a medal on my chest and give me benefit pay

My corps
Your corps
Hard corps
Marine corps
Ahoorah!
Marine corps

[Verse 3]
First on the scene and the last to know
First ones shipped and the last ones home
I'll tell you why God loves the marines
Heaven is stocked with our casualties

[Chorus]
Gangreen
Gangreen
Devil dogs to the front of the fight
Gonna kill everything in sight

My corps
Your corps
Hard corps
Marine corps
Ahoorah!
My corps
Ahoom- good!
Your corps
Hard corps
Hard corps
Marine corps
Marine corps
Ahoorah!
