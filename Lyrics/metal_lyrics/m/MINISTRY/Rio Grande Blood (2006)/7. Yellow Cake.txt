...and the war goes on
...and the war goes on

[Verse 1]
There's no crisis of conscience
The truth is dressed in disguise
Feeding the hungry with Yellow Cake
Feeding the public with lies

[Chorus]
Yellow Cake

[Verse 2]
No crimes were ever committed
No charges were ever read
Cooking the books on the Yellow Cake
Cooking a meal for the dead

[Chorus]
Yellow Cake

...and the war goes on
...and the war goes on

[Verse 3]
This is no time for the righteous
Only the wicked survive
Bake up a batch of the Yellow Cake
Bake up a batch of the lies

[Chorus]
Yellow Cake [x4]
