[Verse 1]
Palestina was a very nice girl
She liked to travel and sample the world
Palestina has a first hand view of life
Palestina from a very young age
Saw the oppression, felt the rage
Palestina wants out of her cage to fight

[Chorus]
My life will be short and sweet

[Verse 2]
Palestina told her family and friends
She'd be back, to take her revenge
Palestina made up her mind to die
Palestina had a belt of death
She had explosives strapped to her chest
Palestina is a martyr now in the sky

[Chorus]
My life will be short and sweet

Bye

[Chorus]
My life will be short and sweet
My life will be short and sweet
