SeÃ±or Peligro
Bush's alter ego
A family of danger
And that's his middle name
Invasion is imminent
Keeping down the dissidents
Killing is his business
And business is game

[Chorus]
Justification
To Cross the Border
Justification
For Law and Order
Justification
To Cross the Rio
SeÃ±or Peligro

SeÃ±or Peligro
Lost all his amigos
From Chile to Panama
And all points in between
Exploitation
To feed the Corporations
The driving force of any war
Is always based in Greed

Venezuela
Watch your Back
SeÃ±or Peligro is on the attack

[Voice Over (Isa Martinez - signed release):]
El Presidente Bush es un Asesino
No cambiaremos sangre por aceite
Gente muriendo por el amor del dinero

Soportarlo es mas gas para el fuego
Preparate para el SeÃ±or Peligro

[English translation:
The President is an assassin
We will not exchange blood for oil
People dying for the love of money

Supporting him is fuel to the fire
Prepare for Mr. Danger]

[Chorus]
