I need help
I need help

I don't know who I am no more
I'm gonna get some help
Help me

[Singing:]

Step! Step, step it up baby!
Got a question for you: like, who, what, where, why?
Are we even here?
Or are we following alone like another lost Indian looking for his tribe?
Oh dial the phone.
We might as well find someone else.
???

Grrr!

[wails]

I like to apologize to all my wonderful fans
For sticking by me through such troubled times
I love all you so much
I wish I could take you all to the Betty Ford Clinic
Yeah

[Singing:]

Step! Step it up baby!
We gotta sell instutions of recovery,
We gotta kill distrubutions of the pills I take!
???

Grr!

Step! Step it up baby!

[...]

I love all my fans
Through these times of nakedness
If I could I'd take any one of you with me
Put you right underneath my pillow

[fade out..]
