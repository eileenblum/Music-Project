The moat in my eyes never bring me no sleep
They just strap me inside with the demons I keep
Gotta leave me alone gotta let it be lone
Tired of living, too tired to die
Makes the sharks keep swimming when he don't know why
Gotta get the lean fin
Only thin that he wears

Nursing me to the movie that he shows
Nursing me to the bureau and the ?
Nursing me can't you leave me alone?
Nursing me in a nursing home

Sleeping and working and an old man
Come just to profit my feet with a broken old hose
Stop riding those rails
Stop setting those sails

He likes (boom boogie ??) 
He's got an old trombone
While he's laughing at the fires with a broken beat phone
Got a troubled soul
But he's not that cold

[Chorus]

I've been nursed ten years in a nursing home!

Stinking on water i could use me food
He needed big fat gravy on the wake of pot roast
Got a fire inside
It's gonna burn him alive
Talking and struggle till the roof is blown
Got a bed and three squares in a nursing home
Gonna say bye-bye
He's gonna walk on by
