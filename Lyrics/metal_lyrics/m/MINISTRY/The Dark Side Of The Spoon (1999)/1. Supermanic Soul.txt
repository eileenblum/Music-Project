"take this first song and uh, dance
I mean this, uh, first, let's start playing and dance"

Well I just shot a man to death
I've got a bullet out of my head
He fired back and I can't stop
A final shot and a final breath
Afraid to stop and afraid to check
The smell of fear and the color red
Had him with a 2 inch shell

Well it's a brutal smell of death

Saw my reflection in a spoon.
I had it with my not approved excuse
I've got a supermanic soul

I've pulled the trigger in the record room
I've put a stop to his loonytoons
I've put him down in the record room

These are for you
Dead - break this
These are for you
Dead - break this
Dead!

These are for you
Dead - break this
These are for you
Dead - break this
