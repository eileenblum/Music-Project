Don't wanna hear your voice
Don't really know if I have a choice
Don't wanna be the one that makes you forget

You're choking on the brain
You're choking again

Don't think we ever met
Don't think you offered up a godgiven name
Who did the talking, man the whip on the chain?
You've got pleasure from the seconds of pain
But then they get you with the burden of shame
The true measure if the one that remains

Don't wanna...
Don't wanna be your pain
Don't wanna be your pain baby
Don't wanna be your pain
Don't wanna be your pain baby
Don't wanna be your pain

I live in a concrete cell,
No soul is dead until we create a ??? mind
she ??? the exact time
she ???
and take the young boy's lip
she loves to see him crawl up the chamber wall
???
and with the eyes you covered
like a ??? hovered
???
and when they scream no more
she doesn't care for one more

Won't let you kill me just yet
Don't even care if there's a price on my head
Don't wanna wind up in a blood?
Don't wanna be your...
Don't wanna be your chain
Don't wanna be your chain baby
Don't wanna be your chain

I said, I don't ...don't... I don't wanna be you chain
