thieves, thieves and liars, murderers
hypocrites and bastards [in laughter]

hey thanks for nothing!
morals in the dust
two-faced bastards and syncophants
no trust

thieves! liar!
inside, outside, which side, you don't know
my side, your side, their side, we don't know
which side are they?  which side are they?
which side of their mouth do you suppose that it came?
which side are they?  which side are they?
which side of the grass is greener?
inside, outside, which side, you don't know
my side, your side, their side, we don't know

you're like a great big fucking gun,
just waiting to get squeezed!

breathe, forfeit erection!
toxical injection
geriatric fuck-fest
we still believe in lies

thieves! liar!
inside, outside, which side, you don't know
my side, your side, their side, we don't know
who started it?  who started it?
which side are they?  which side are they?
which side of their mouth do you suppose that it came?
which side are they?  which side are they?
which side of the grass is greener?
inside, outside, which side, you don't know
my side, your side, their side, no one knows

you're like a great big hit of acid,
waiting to be taken!
