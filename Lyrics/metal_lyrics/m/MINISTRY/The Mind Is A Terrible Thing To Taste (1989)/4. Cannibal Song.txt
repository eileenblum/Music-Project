dehumanize
lobotomize
thrown into a cell
swallow your pride
in an infant mind

thrown into a cell
a punishment fit
for a crippled mind
don't do that to me
criminals, sodomites, all laughing at me

life is hell
forever fighting
a deficient mind
we're all left alone and poisoned
a sickening trap
a sight worth seeing

dehumanize
lobotomize
thrown into a cell
swallow your pride
in an infant mind

don't do that to me
don't do that to me
force breaks our back
time preserves, fearfully

you know what i said
hideous and strange
thrown into a cell
a punishment fit
for a crippled mind
