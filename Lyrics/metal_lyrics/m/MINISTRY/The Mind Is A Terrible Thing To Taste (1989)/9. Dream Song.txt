Well I had this dream one night, I was like, I was lying on my like,
stupid ??? capsual, that, that,
an um, it was like really hot, ok like, start of the summer,
an, hot, its really hot, an I had like, like no fan, or anything,
ya know fine, an I had this weirdest, weirdest, weirdest, like nightmare,
ya know how you have some nightmares, when there like, there like, dreams,
but their not dreams, their like real? Ya know? An like you feel, it felt alive,
when your dreaming, you feel alive, when your dreaming.
An I had this dream, when this angel came up, just, like, up my fire escape,
cause I don't have any bars on my windows, cause I don't belive in bars on my windows,
an, she was there in my room, just lying there, she came, and she kissed me.
And I woke up, and I must have cum.
