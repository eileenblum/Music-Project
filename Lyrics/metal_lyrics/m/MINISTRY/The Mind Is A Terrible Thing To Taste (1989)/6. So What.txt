"You have had all that money can give you, but that wasn't enough. You became a thrill-seeker. Kill for the thrill. (assassin) This thrill-seeking became the one great thing in your life, planning one thrill on another until the murder. Kill for the love of killing. (guilty) Kill for the thrill. The thrill-seeker comes from all walks of life. He comes from the home, a home where the parents are to busy to treat their children with respect."

Die! Die! Die! Die!
Scum-suckers! Depravity debauched!
Anal fuck-fest, thrill Olympics
Savage scourge supply and sanctify
So what? So what?
So what? So what?
Die! Die! Die! Die!

Die! Die! Die! Die!
You said it!
Sedatives supplied become laxatives
My eyes shit out lies
I only kill to know I'm alive
So what? So what?
So what? So what?
Die! Die! Die! Die!

"Kill for the thrill. (assassin) Some people think newspapers exaggerate juvenile crime. All that is defined mostly to the large cities, juvenile delinquency is underlined. Thus parents think something is going wrong with the environment. Adults create the world, children live it. Juvenile delinquency is always rooted in adult delinquency. And in this process, parents play the key role when children grow up among adults who refuse to recognize anything that is fine and good, or worthy of respect."

Die! Die! Die! Die!
So what, it's your own problem to learn to live with
Destroy us, or make us saints
We don't care, it's not our fault that we were born too late
A screaming headache on the brow of the state
Killing time is appropriate
To make a mess and fuck all the rest, we say, we say
So what? So what?
So what? So what?
Die!

Die!
Now that I know what it's like,
I'll kill them all if I like
Only time will decide
No one listened to reason,
It's too late and I'm ready to fight
So what? Now I'm ready to fight!
I'm ready to fight!
I'm ready to fight!
I'm ready to fight!
I'm ready to fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
So what? So what? So what? So what? So what? So what?
