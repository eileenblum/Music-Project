[originally by S.O.D.]It doesn't matter how you wear your hair
It's what's inside your head
United Forces stand for all strong far
Black, white and yellow and red

[Chorus:]
UNITED Forces, UNITED Forces, UNITED Forces
UNITED Forces, UNITED Forces, UNITED Forces

Skinheads and bangers and punks stand as one
Crossover to a final scene
United Forces and their job won't be some
Until the world can see

[Chorus (2x):]
No rednecks, no jocks, no macho hell shit attitudes
United Forces can't be stopped
