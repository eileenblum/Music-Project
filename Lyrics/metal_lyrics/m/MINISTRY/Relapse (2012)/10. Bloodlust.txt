I want blood because I'm vicious
I want your soul
I wanna own your thought
I want power
I want money
I got needs and nothing can't be bought

Greed and arrogance
Justice not in evidence

Bloodlust

I hate love
There's no profit
I'm up above and like what I see
You got a job
You make nothing
You got it all but there's more to feed

Greed and arrogance
Justice not in evidence

Bloodlust

I want blood
Delicious
I want your wallet
And everything you've got
I lost my mind
I lost my sould 
I lost everything that I don't control

Greed and arrogance
Justice not in evidence

Bloodlust
