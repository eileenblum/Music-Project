You know, they say it takes a whole pack of wolves to take down a moose 'cause one on one that moose would smack them down. It's like being in the music business: you got your managers, your ex-managers, your ex-bandmates, your ex-labels, your ex-wives, your lawyers, your tax attorneys... Hell! That sounds more like a pack of hyenas to me.

You know, I was once told by an ex-manager, "Son, you're worth more dead than alive 'cause when you're dead we can sell you off in pieces." That's the way it works around here.

You don't believe me? Why don't you try asking Jim Morrison Or Jimi Hendrix or Janis Joplin Or Kurt Cobain or Amy Winehouse. I'm pretty sure they're gonna take my side of the story. Sometimes I think they're the lucky ones. They don't have to deal with these douchebags 'cause they're already dead. But I'm not dead yet!

You vultures want me dead
What's up with that?
You make more money off the carcass that is dead
What's up with that?

I'm not dead yet [8x]

Ghouldiggers
Vultures and thieves
Ghouldiggers
Shrouded in their greed
Ghouldiggers
They're always after me
Ghouldiggers diggers diggers diggers diggers

You vultures strike it rich
What's up with that?
There's just one little hitch
I'm not dead yet
And that's a fact

I'm not dead yet [8x]

Ghouldiggers
Vultures and thieves
Ghouldiggers
Shrouded in their greed
Ghouldiggers
They're always after me

â Hello, Ghouldigger management. Can I help you?
â Eh, yeah. I'd like to speak to my manager. Please.
â And you are...?
â My name's Al Jourgensen from the band Ministry and just wanna speak to my manager.
â Am, let me check and ... then. One moment, please. I ... hold.
â Dammit, they put me on hold again! What is wrong with these people? What is the major malfunction?

You never return my calls
What's up with that?
No word from you at all
What's up with that?

I'm not dead yet [8x]

Ghouldiggers
Vultures and thieves
Ghouldiggers
Shrouded in their greed
Ghouldiggers
They're always after me

[Spoken:]
â Hello, Mr Jourgensen. I'm so sorry to keep you on hold. Ah, your manager is actually on a call at lunch at the meeting on vacation out of the country. However he did leave the message. He says to please call back after you're dead.
â No, you're kidding me?
