I pissed my life away
Swimming in my habits
I was in over my head
I kissed away any type of normal life
For this instead

Help Help Help
No No No

I pissed away over ten million dollars
On dope and crack
I passed away deader than a door knob
But now I'm back

Help Help Help
No No No

I'm in FreeFall

I pound away at social injustice
It doesn't make a bit of difference 
So I get wasted every single day
It's my only deliverance

Help Help Help
No No No

I'm in FreeFall

Just call your dealer
He's probably home
Just call him now
