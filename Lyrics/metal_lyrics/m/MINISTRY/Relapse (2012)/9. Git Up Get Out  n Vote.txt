Suffragette City isn't all that pretty
If it doesn't end up on a happy note
So make sure you register again
Our country's gone insane
Get up, get out and vote

Look into my eyes
Don't you realize?
Millions died for us to exercise
We can't end up in the same old boat
Life and liberty
Get up, get out and vote

Get up, get out and vote
Get up, get out and vote

The rockets' red glare
Something's rotten in the air
Equality is more than just a quote
So much apathy in the land of the free
Get up, get out and vote

Get up, get out and vote
