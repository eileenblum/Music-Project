I hear voices in my head
Someone's voice is in my head
Be afraid
Be afraid
Take a pill and you'll get laid
Someone's gotta make it stop
Make it stop
Make it stop
Some stole the remote control

I can't even go to sleep
Voices in my head repeat
Stay awake
Stay awake
Like a car without a brake

I got nothing else to do
Sit around and watch the tube
Gather information
That is useless agrivation
I refuse
I refuse
To be any more confused

What is happening to me
Happens all across society
Make it stop
Make it stop
All of us are gonna rot
Living in a system
Where you can't connect the fucking dots
Stop

I hear voices inside my head
Someone's voice is in my head
