I got your picture
You gave your soul to me
You're my addiction
I'm sure you'd have to agree

Idolized by zeros

I know all of your faces
I've even watched you sleep
You're my obsession
Your life is mine to keep

Idolized by zeros

I got all of your letters
Told me to stay away
You know me better
I'll pay a visit today

Idolized idolized idolized by zeros
Idolized idolized idolized by zeros
