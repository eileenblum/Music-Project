She started drinking wine
And then she couldn't stop
She must be out of her head
That's why she has to be shot

That's Warp City

I'll probably have to do time
Because I lost control
I'd rather drop on a dime
Than spend my life in a hole

That's Warp City

I got a hole in my head
Can't make the bleeding stop
I think I'll go back to bed
And wait around for the cops

That's Warp City
That's Warp City

I shot my family dead
Then turned the gun on me
Did what the demon said
He said he'd set me free
