Life sucks
And death is calling
Every day

I keep my chin up
But my spirit's falling
Every day

On and on and on and on
It goes
On and on and on and on

Last night
Won't see the morning
Every day
I see the sunset as an endless warning
Every day

On and on and on and on
It goes
On and on and on and on

Knife cuts
Thru all that I wanted
Every day

It's like living in a
House that's haunted
Every day

On and on and on and on
It goes
On and on and on and on

...and all is well in our world
