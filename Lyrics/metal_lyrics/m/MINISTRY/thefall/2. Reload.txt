(3-2-1, roll 5)
You've got something to say
You better jump in my face
(Aim)
You've got something to hide
You're scared as shit to die
(Aim)
Aim, Reload
You say it's time to collect
I'll kick your ass and digest
(Aim)
Aim, Reload
It's time to settle the score
You stow your act at the door
(Aim)
Aim, Reload
You wanna lie like a dog
You're going to wake up with fleas
Aim, Reload
Inside a world full of shit
You're still an asshole to me
(Aim)
Aim, Reload
