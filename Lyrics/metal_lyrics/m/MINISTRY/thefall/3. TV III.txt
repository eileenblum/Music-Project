Hmmm, Yea *13

Police
Call the police officers
Freeze!

That clown they dress up
That clown they dress up

Hold it
Move, right there.
You, Get up! Get up! Get up!
Put your hands on top
Don't make me repeat myself, God Dammit!
I said move, Freeze! Freeze and hold it
Put 'em down or I'll blow his damn brains out
Put your hands on top
Don't make me repeat myself, God Dammit!
I said move, Freeze! Freeze and hold it
I hear rape.
Get up!
Get everyone on the floor
Up against the wall God Dammit, all of you
Come on move!
Put your hands on top of your head
Put your hands on top
Don't make me repeat myself
Hold it, over there
Move, move, right there. There's good
You, Get up, Get up! Get up!
Hold it
Move, right there.
You, Get up, Get up! Get up!
Put your hands on top
Don't make me repeat myself, God Dammit!
I said move, Freeze!
