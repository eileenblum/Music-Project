I've got something to say to you
I'll back it up with my fist
Sick and tired of dealing with assholes that's why I resist

We're not snowflakes we are the Antifa

Right wing is in freefall, skinheads taking a dive
Antifa is coming for you, they won't survive

We're not snowflakes we are the Antifa

Brown shirt little snowflakes never want to admit
Terrified of the red and black flag Antifa's the shit

We're not snowflakes we are the Antifa
We're not snowflakes, we are the Antifa

We are the Antifa
We are the Antifa
