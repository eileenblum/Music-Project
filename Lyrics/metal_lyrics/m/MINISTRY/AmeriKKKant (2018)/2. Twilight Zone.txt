I remember waking up on November 9, 2016 and feeling a little bit nauseous
It felt like descending into a bottomless pit on a high speed rail
Careening head first into the unknown

Disgusted and depressed
We know the world is just a mess
Distortion of reality
The truth is under arrest

This is the twilight zone

Confusion and consent
Has always been their intent
Destruction of society
Unless we dissent

Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
