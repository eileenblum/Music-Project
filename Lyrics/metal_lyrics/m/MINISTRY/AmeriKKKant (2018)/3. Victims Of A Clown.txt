Polarized, divisive drowning in strife
Technically I still exist, but not in my mind
Wake up, take it in, exhale, repeat

Fire up, freak out, let it go
Angry man

Septic tank
Orange
Toxic lies
Rejection of reality

Cuts through like a knife
Wake up, take it in, exhale, repeat
Fire up, freak out, let it go

Silence of majority
Silver linings prevail
Golden dreams remember
Remember to exhale

Wake up, take it in, exhale, repeat
Fire up, freak out, let it go

Hey!
What he say?!
Vomiting conspiracies
God damn the racist blind
Anti social impotence ignites
