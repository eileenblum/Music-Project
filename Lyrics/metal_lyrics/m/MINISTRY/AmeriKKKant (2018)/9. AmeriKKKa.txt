Well I walked a mile today
In someone else's pair of shoes
I came home tired and disgusted
Just walking home from Hatred Avenue
What you want, what you feel

You will never forget
What you know, what you trust
You should always suspect
What you say, what you do

It makes you repent
What you think, what you see
You should always resent
Well I heard some news today

I guess we're going to war
We don't know who we're fighting
We don't know what we're fighting for
What you want, what you feel

You will never forget
What you know, what you trust
You should always suspect
What you say, what you do

It makes you repent
What you think, what you see
You should always resent
A-m-e-r-i-K-K-K-a

It's like the Nazis back in '39
Like the Romans on the verge of decline
A-m-e-r-i-K-K-K-a
Like the Russians back in '68
How is this supposed to make America great?

Well I guess the truth is hiding
Beyond of the walls of the USA
This is exciting
Don't have to listen to anything you say
What you want, what you feel

You will never forget
What you know, what you trust

You should always suspect
What you say, what you do
It makes you repent
What you think, what you see

You should always resent

A-m-e-r-i-K-K-K-a

It's like the Nazis back in '39
Like the Romans on the verge of decline
Like the Russians back in '68
How is this supposed to make America great?

What you want, what you feel
You will never forget
What you know, what you trust
You should always suspect
What you say, what you do
It makes you repent
What you think, what you see
You should always resent

Wellâ¦ I guess I don't know what to expectâ¦

Wellâ¦ I guess that's all we gotâ¦
