Put it country simple,
Earth has a lot of things other folks might want,
like the whole planet.
And maybe these folks would like a few changes made,
Like more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,
and room for their way of life.
We've seen this happen before,
right in these United States.
Your way of life destroyed the Indian's way of life,
The Indian Reservation is extinction.
But I offer this distinction
I'm with the invaders,
no use trying to hide that.
And at the same time I disagree
with some of the things they are doing.
Oh, we're not united any more than you are.
Oh, we're not united any more than you are.

Conservative faction is set on nuclear war
as a solution to the Indian personality.

Others disagree [x2]

I don't claim my motives are 100% humane,
but I do say if we can't think up anything quieter,
and tidier, than that, we aren't all that much
better than you new earth aches.

There is no place else to go,
The theater is closed.

There is no place else to go,
The theater is closed.

Cut word lines, cut music lines,
smash the control images,
smash the control machine.
