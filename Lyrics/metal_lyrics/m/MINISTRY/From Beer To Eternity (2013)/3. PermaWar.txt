You live to fight another day, and that day will come
We're fighting never-ending wars, for profit &amp; fun
We're tired, we're tired, we're tired of PermaWar
You live to die another day, we send you off with a gun

We're making money hand over fist, that's why we're never done
We're tired, of keeping scores
We're tired, of what's in store
We're tired, we don't want anymore

We're tired of PermaWar

I'm tired of building other nations
Ceasefire, it's our only salvation
You live and die for the American Way, well that way is done
The bottom line remains the same, we're making cash by the ton

We're tired, of keeping scores
We're tired, of what's in store
We're tired, we don't want anymore
We're tired of PermaWar

We're tired, of keeping scores
We're tired, of what's in store
We're tired, we don't want anymore

We're tired of PermaWar
We're tired of PermaWar
We're tired of PermaWar
We're tired of PermaWar
We're tired of PermaWar
