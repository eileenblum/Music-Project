The other day I watched the Fox News Network, I swear they're all on crack
I need to get me an aluminum helmet, my brain is under attack

No more, no more
No more hate machine
No more right-wing extreme
No more stupidity
No more Fox TV

I saw a story just the other day that put me right into shock
My "Friends" at Fox are blaming all gun violence on rap &amp; rock

No more, no more
No more hate machine
No more right-wing extreme
No more stupidity
No more Fox TV

I finally sold my 60 inch plasma
I'm tired of listening to shit
'Tween Bill O'Reilly, Rush &amp; Hannity
Which one's the biggest twit?

No more, no more
No more hate machine
No more right-wing extreme
No more stupidity
No more Fox TV

Fairly unbalanced, fairly unhinged
In the right-wing fringe
