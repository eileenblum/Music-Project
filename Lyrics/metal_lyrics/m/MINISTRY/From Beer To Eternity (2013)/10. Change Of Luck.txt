Better stick around cuz your luck's gonna change [8x]

Change of luck, change of luck
Change of luck, change of luck

The gift that keeps on giving (change of luck)
Her name is Lady Luck (change of luck)
There's some of you that get to keep on living,
The rest of us are stuck (change of luck)

Change of luck, change of luck
Change of luck, change of luck

The gods of luck keep laughing (change of luck)
Who gets to laugh in the end? (change of luck)
I get to leave on my own damn terms,
With nothing left to spend (change of luck)

Your luck is gonna change
It's gonna go from bad to strange

Your luck is gonna change
It's gonna go from bad to strange
'Cause life is so deranged
We're only here to feel the pain

Change of luck, change of luck, change of luck, change of luck

The clock that never stops ticking (change of luck)
I never seem to catch a break (change of luck)
Came into this world kicking &amp; screaming
I leave with nothing at stake (change of luck)
