Here's my prediction of what is to come
The perfect storm is coming, there's nowhere to run

The perfect storm, what we created
The perfect storm, what we deserve

You got a problem that's only getting worse
The human race is like a virus or a curse
We're on a train that's running out of track
We need some action, we need it fast

The perfect storm, what we created
The perfect storm, what we deserve

There's no denying there's trouble up ahead
We made this mess, now we're hanging by a thread
The rising oceans are great if you're a fish
We've turned the world into a petri dish

The perfect storm, what we created
The perfect storm, what we deserve

These politicians stick their heads in the sand
That's their solution to the problem at hand
A perfect storm is coming our way
But I think this one is gonna stay

The perfect storm, what we created
The perfect storm, what we deserve

Here's my prediction of what is to come
The perfect storm is coming, there's nowhere to run

There's nowhere to run
There's nowhere to run
