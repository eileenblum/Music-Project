standing on corners
and begging for quarters
for what? for you! (and you)
busting my head
cos that's what you said
for all of us -- fuck you!
just like you!

people are happy
when they're not so trapped
by someone just like you! (and you)
many more years
of nothing but fear
of anything you do!
1980's was run by
a person who's crazy -- like you! (and you)
the 1990's will be
unkindly, exactly like you! (and you)
just like you! (and you)
you!

when one dictator
is the same as the leader -- just like you! (and you)
we work, we survive
just like you! (and you)
we work, we twitch
you! (and you)
just like you!
