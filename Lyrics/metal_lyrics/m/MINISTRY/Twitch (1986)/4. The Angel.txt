now is an angel there?
now is an angel there?
now is an angel there?

one left out
when they passed heaven about
what about me
sitting here in my purgatory
so left out
he's dead
i'm alive
he's spared
always an angel who cares
always an angel there

one like me
we try so hard
five like you
someone dead again
where's your angel now?
where's your angel now?
where's your morals now?
where's your morals?

always an angel there
where's your angel now?
always an angel who cares
always an angel there
where's your morals?
there's always an angel who cares
there's always an angel there

no more people staring
no more fatal dares
like a baby grabbing at
something that isn't there
but it is
but it is

always an angel there
always an angel who cares
always an angel there
always an angel who cares
