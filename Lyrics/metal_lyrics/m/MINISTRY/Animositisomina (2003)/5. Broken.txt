Grab yourself a partner
Swing her 'round the town
Walk the dog and do-se-do
Before you tie her down

Anesthetize and fantasize
Watch those dreams come true
A riding crop, a lollipop
A tank of nitrous too

Because you're broken 

Bang! Bang! Bootyier
Broken down and done.
Triple XXX and filthy sex
An overloaded gun

Discipline and bondage
Leather mask and nuns
A topless girl
A string of pearls
A wad of bubble cum

Inconsequential
An angel's broken wing
Kept confidential
We keep inside our secret things 

What's the price of pleasure?
What's the price of pain?
Rapture or deliverance
Beneath a golden rain 

Swap and swing and sissy spank
The middle-class defined
Or those who swim the deep end...
Where sex and death combine

Because you're broken [repeated and faded out]
