Where have all the heroes gone?
Returning where they're from
Did they touch God or did they touch the sun?

Preparation day
Fearless desire
Some will lose by living
Chosen suicide

Did they touch God or did they touch the sun?

Preparation day
Selfless act of giving
Many pay the price
Heroes suicide
Unsung

The world we recognize has just begun
Some die from living
So unsung

Preparation day
Fearless desire
Some will lose by living
Chosen suicide

Some die from living
So unsung

Preparation day
Selfless act of giving
Many pay the price
Heroes suicide

Unsung [x4]
