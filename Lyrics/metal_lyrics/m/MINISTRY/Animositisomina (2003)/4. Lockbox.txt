Owe more than money
Owe more than time
Payment required
Punished for your crimes

No point in running
You'll be hunted down
Do yourself a favor
Stop fucking around [3x]

Payment is deliverance
Then you want more
You set the deadline
You start the war [2x]

In my lockbox is me
In the lockbox I'm free

You pay [6x]

You want confrontation
Come to my door
Welcome to my lockbox
Forevermore

Want retribution
Take what is mine
Made my restitutions
You're next in line

In my lockbox is me [echoes and repeats]
In my lockbox I'm free
I'm free [repeats]
