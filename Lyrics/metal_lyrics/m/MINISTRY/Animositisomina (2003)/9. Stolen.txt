The truth be told
Until it's sold
Silence is golden
Too bad it's all been stolen
Stolen! Stolen! Stolen!

Our defense is your defense
Your defense in some sense
Some sensless way unfolded
Folded 'cause it's all been stolen
Stolen! Stolen! Stolen!

The gilded scale was burning
Just as your back was turning
Just as all trust was leaving
You'd have us all believing

These truths we hold
Self-evident
Bought and sold
Wisely spent

The more you hunt the more I sing
Then quickly rewrite everything
Truth returns bloated, swollen
Then disappears - it's been stolen!
Stolen!

It's all been stolen! [x2]
