I'm in love with a vicious grace
I see beauty in a terrified soul
A blackened heart and a poison mind
I can't recognize the cruel from the kind

Impossible...

Do unto others as they'd do unto you
Can't trust a soul unless you have one to trust
Times change and people die
Hate survives beyond the end of time

Impossible...

Inside the walls of human hate
Absolve yourself of all your pain and regret 
It's like a junky on a 2 day sick love ignores me hate fixes quick 

Impossible
