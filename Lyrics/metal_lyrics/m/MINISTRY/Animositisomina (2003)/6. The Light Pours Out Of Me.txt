Time flies
Time crawls 
Link an insect up and down the walls

The light pours out of me [x2]

The conspiracy of silence
Ought to revolutionize my thought 

The light pours out of me [x2]

The cold light of day pours out of me
Leaving me black and so healthy

The light pours out of me [x2]

It jerks out of me 
Just like blood
In this still life 
Heart beats up love

The light pours out of me
Pours out of me....
