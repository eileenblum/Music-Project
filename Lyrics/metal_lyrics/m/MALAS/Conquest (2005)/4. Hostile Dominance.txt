Being of nothing
Pushed forward into society
Falling back to inhumanity
I see the shadows of all my fears
Living a life of grief
Defining-self awareness
More to life
Than I can give
World turning inside out
Shattered way to live
Collapsing-devastating

Defiance-erupting to anarchy
Excess of vultures-surrender you
Hostile dominance-divides you
What brings you faith
Brings you death
