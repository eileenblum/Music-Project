Moral strife
Sacrilegious embodiment
Inhumanity disguised
With religious myths
To pursue and control
Faith calls you to arms
Shocking crimes
Madness conquers beliefs
Deny your life
To save your soul
Distort your guilt
Obey your lord
The bloods on your hands
Centuries of genocide
Live off population
Condemned to life
Victims abstain
For fear of sin they commit
Invasions of territory
Seasons your hate
Deny your life
To save your soul
Distort your guilt
Obey your lord
In the name of our lord
I reign supreme
Whore's of death
With death you'll escape
Your race is the chosen ones
Live in glory with god
Defending your sacred ground
Is all your life's worth
Deny your life
To save your soul
Distort your guilt
Obey your lord
Deny your life
To save your soul
Faith calls you to arms
To your sacred grave
