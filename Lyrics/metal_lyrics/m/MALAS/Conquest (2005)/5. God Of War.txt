Outcast-exiled
Tyrant of all time
Succumb to evil delights
Demons covet his soul
Distraught-deranged
Inner desolation
Gone too far to return
Insanity is bliss
God of war
Denying your fate
Implying your craze
The killing of man
God of war
Enslaving us all
To live and to die for
The killing of man
Defeated disillusions
Only wish for immortality
Confined to eternal life
To walk the earth
Rise before me
Feeble existence
Frightened careless ones
Come into my reach
God of war
Denying your fate
Implying your craze
The killing of man
God of war enslaving us all
To live and to die for
The killing of man
Mesmerized mortals
Enchanted with deceit
Prepare to sacrifice them all
Massive ravaging
The pain immense
The price of endless time
The price of man to die
To forever live insane
God of war
Denying your fate
Implying your craze
The killing of man
God of war
Enslaving us all
To live and to die for
The killing of man
