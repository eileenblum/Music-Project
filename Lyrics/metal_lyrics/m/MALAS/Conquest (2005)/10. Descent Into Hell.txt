You're evil
Is not the way you choose to kill
A way of ending life is your pleasure
Deliverance to hell
The executioner

To suffer
Darkest souls of your victims
The frantic fear drives them insane
Takes your last breath in your grave

Hordes of death
Breath evil into you
Seconds pass endlessly
As you wait to die

Descent to hell
Descent to hell
Torture forever lasting
The seven gates await

Descent to hell
Descent to hell
God's bitter rage
Destines your fate
