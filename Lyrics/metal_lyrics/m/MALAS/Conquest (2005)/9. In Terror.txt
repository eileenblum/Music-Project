You lie and you rape
Make it better for yourself
Your institution
Will crumble to my feat
My sickness
Turns to bitter hate
To annihilate
To assassinate
I'll decide what will kill you
Provoke your murder
Destruct with hate
Prepare to face
A merciless slaughter
Fear the terror
See the horror
Of your violent death
Blind vengeance
In terror you live in fear
My anarchy
Your atrocity
Your decadence
Your demise
See the grim fatality
In your duress with uncertainty
Time is your enemy
