So it begins the destruction of your mind
Defending your de3viant lifeline
Cowering from the bloodbath you create
Self-mutilation there's no point of your state
You think you found the god
That will save you from yourself
Sedating from a mad world surrounding you
Poisoning your body releases the bitter pain
Function without it there is no way
To remorse will bring it all back again
Only death can save you from yourself
As you awake your searching for your

Salvation...
There's no one left to guide you
Salvation...
There's no one left to find you

They think you're sick, only way to hold on to sanity
Fill your veins up to numb your tortured vanity
Hopeless cause no one could ever reach you
Repeating the damage cause all they want is to fix you
You've fallen into dreams you've never seen before
Horror of reality is brief before you're comatose

Salvation...
There's no one left to guide you
Salvation...
There's no one left to find you
