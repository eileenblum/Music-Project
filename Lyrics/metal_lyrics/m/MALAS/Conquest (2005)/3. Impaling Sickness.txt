Impaling sickness
Devouring me as prey
Extinction without reason
The soldier of death will reign
Never knowing how or what
Is ravaging in me

Dethrone the body
Crippled from the pain
Designed to rip
Savaged-killing machine
Spawning its death inside of me
Infecting all my limbs
Feeding frenzy begins

Outside of madness
My world's domain
Calculating torture
Fall to the unnamed

Lying in a pool of blood
Infecting all my limbs
Finishes off what it begins
Decaying flesh
Just melts away from bone
A horrid life
Being eaten alive
