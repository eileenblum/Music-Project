You bleed
The sign of sin
You conceive
Spawning is your device
You detest
Power of god
You infest
Punished to despair
Scorned through life
You rancor
All that is mine
You cancer
Bitter to the end
You deceive
Docile hates
The beast seeds
You lure
Prey to webs
You loathe
Bloodthirsty stare
You're vain
Stained in my eyes
You possessed
My fate to demise
Scorned through life
You rancor all that is mine
You cancer
Bitter to the end
You deceive
Docile hates
The beast seeds
