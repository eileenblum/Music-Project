You'll Just Have To Stay For As Long As I Say
If You Try To Leave
I Will Make You Pay
Beside Me You'll Lay
You're Drugged Anyway
I'll Keep You Like That
And Things Will Be Ok

In An Acid Filled Drum I Put You
After Two Weeks Its' Sludge
You'll Turn To
Then I'll Take My Plastic Scoop
And It's Into The Toilet With You

Drilled Your Head So You'll Stay
For As Long As I Say
No More Thoughts Of Leaving
While I Have My Way

You're Dead In Two Days
But You're Still A Good Lay
I'll Put You In Acid
Then Flush You Away
