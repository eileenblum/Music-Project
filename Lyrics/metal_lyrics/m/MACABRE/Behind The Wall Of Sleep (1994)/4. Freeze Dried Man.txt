Jeffrey Dahmer wanted a freeze-dried man
So he could do the things he enjoyed again and again
Jeff said he'd fondle, rub, and lay with his freeze dried man
And pose him for pictures if flexible, with his Polaroid in hand

Jeffrey had a plan
To freeze dry a man
But the device was thirty grand
So the thought was quickly canned

He went to the taxidermist to enquire on how to freeze dry
He told the man it was for a rabbit, that was just a lie
Instead Jeffrey wanted to freeze dry a man
But the device was thirty grand, So the thought was quickly canned

Jeffrey had a plan
To freeze dry a man
But the device was thirty grand
So the thought was quickly canned
