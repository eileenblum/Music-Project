In First War the Austro-Hungarian Army needed gasoline
The Czinkota Village constable remembered something
Before the war a man had stored some large metal drums
He said they were filled with gasoline for hard times that would come
Inside they found the drums seven of them in all
They pried open the drums and found they contained wood alcohol

[CHORUS 1]
Bella Kiss couldn't miss
With his charming advertisements that women couldn't resist
Bella Kiss was in the services

He found a dead soldier and their dog tags Bella switched
Submerged in the wood alcohol the soldiers nex they found
The naked strangled corpses of some women who were bound
But Bella Kiss had been drafted into the army core
And apparently had been killed on the frontline in the First World War
Kisses bureau owerflowed with female responses
With cards and letters to Bella advertisements

[CHORUS 2]
Bella Kiss couldn't miss
With his charming advertisements that women couldn't resist
Bella Kiss was filled with evilness

he pickled women and stored them on his premises
They searched and found seventeen drums in the surrounding countryside
Each drum had contained a pickled corpse that Bella stashed inside
Theu thought that he was dead
And in the First World War was killed
But they didn't know they were the fools on the hill
He switched identities with a dead soldier
Which gave Kiss access to travel and he was never found

[CHORUS 2]
