Who's afraid of the big bad wolf
The big bad wolf the big bad wolf
Kids are afraid of the bid bad wolf
The big bad wolf the big bad wold

Once upon a time there was a hermit man
Who got married and found it hard to provide for both of them
He was tempted by a demon who promised them a better life
With an ointment he vould change into a wolf with quite a bite

[CHORUS]
Such big ears, the better to hear you with
Such big eyes, the better to see you with
Such big teeth, the better to eat you with
Little red riding hood, my dear
Such big ears, the better to hear you with
Such big eyes, the better to see you with
Such big teeth, the better to eat you with
Little red riding hood, my dear

And so he made the deal and changed unto a wild beast
Stalking local children, so his wife and him could feast
The devil spawned wolf man, looked for kids who were alone
And with his teeth he tore their flesh and took some pieces home

[CHORUS]

Twice while killing children, he was seen by passerby's
Scaring off the wolf before they were cannibalized
The big bad wolf was tracked down and they sentenced him to die
And so the executioner burned the big bad wolf alive

[CHORUS]

Who's afraid of the big bad wolf
The big bad wolf the big bad wolf
Kids are afraid of the bid bad wolf
The big bad wolf the big bad wold
The end and everyone lived happily ever after
