In ancient pagan Rome, the entertainment of those times
Took place in huge arenas where the people could unwind
As helpless Christians were fed to the starving animals
They watched and cheered and thought the pastime was enjoyable
Though all the Caesar's of Rome were depraved and perverse
Everybody said that Nero the Caesar was the worst

[CHORUS:]
Nero's inferno
Rome must have been like a giant sterno
Nero's inferno
Nero played his lyre as he watched the burning Rome

When he was young he liked to prowl around the streets at night
Attacking men on their way home
Killing them with a knife
Then later in life he would dress in skins of animals
A leaping from a den
Attacking people tied to poles
With men and women tied to stakes
Unable to defend themselves
Nero would attack them biting off their genitals

[CHORUS]

He wanted a new palace home
and so he burned down Rome, it's Nero's inferno
The palace that he lived in wasn't good enough for him
It's Nero's inferno
A sudden fire did appear as Nero played his lyre,
it's Nero's inferno
He blamed the Christians for the fire but Nero was a liar, it's Nero's inferno
He castrated a boy named Sporus and dressed him as his bride
At this wedding they made torches of the Christians for their light
He tore out his mother's womb to see where he came from
He burned down Rome and played his lyre
and blamed the Christians
Rome rejected Nero and called him public enemy
He stabbed himself in the throat
Helped by his secretary
