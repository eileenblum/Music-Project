You will die by surprise
when I take your life I will smile

John George Haigh was a vampire
who drank old ladies blood
then put them in a non-corrosive drum
and with acid he'd dissolve them

With my knife I make a cut on your neck
Your blood fills a glass for me
A special treat

Now that you're dead
in a metal drum you'll stay
I pump the acid in
to melt your corpse away
