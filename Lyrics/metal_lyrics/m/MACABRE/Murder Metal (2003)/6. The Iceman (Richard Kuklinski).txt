There's a very big man who lived a double life
as a dedicated family man and cold blooded hitman
husband with children
but on the streets he was The Iceman

The mafia hitman
nicknamed the Iceman
was a very big man
wasn't a very nice man

The Iceman wasn't a nice man
was big and frightening
and struck like lightning
The Iceman, contracted reaper
the victims' relatives were the weepers

The Iceman was his nickname
because of the time he froze his victims
The Iceman was payed to ice men
he made his living being The Iceman

Cyanide was his preferred method
sometimes a shotgun
to blow someone's head off
lethal scam man
but a dedicated family man
