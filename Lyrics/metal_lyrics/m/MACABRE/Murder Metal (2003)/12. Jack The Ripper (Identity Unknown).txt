Dear boss, I keep on hearing 
that the police have caught me 
but they won't fix me just yet 
I have laughed 
when they looked so clever 
and talk about being 
on the right track 

That joke about leather apron 
gave me real fits 
I am down on whores 
and I shan't quit ripping them 
till I do get buckled 
grand work the last job was 
I have the lady no time to squeal 

And I want to start again 
you will soon learn of me 
with my funny little games 
I saved some of the proper red stuff 
in a ginger beer bottle over the last job 

To write with but it went thick 
like glue 
and I can't use it 

Red ink is fit enough I hope 
ha ha 
the next job I do 
I shall clip the ladies ears off 
and send them to police officers 
just for jolly 
Wouldn't you? 

Keep this letter back 
till I do a bit more work 
then give it out straight 
my knives so nice and sharp 

I want to get back to work right away
if  I get a chance

Good luck! 
Yours truly, 
Jack the Ripper 

Don't mind me given the trade name
