Over 400 years ago 
the people were terrorized 
around Bedburg and Cologne 
in the German countryside
According to the pamphlet 
published at that time 
a man named Peter Stumpp
committed atrocious crimes

Peter Stumpp the Werewolf 
Peter Stumpp the Werewolf 

Aided and abetted 
by his mistress and daughter 
body parts were found 
on the land and in the water 
His daughter had a son 
from repeated incest 
Stumpp ate his son 
and said the brain tasted the best 

The werewolf of Bedburg
The werewolf of Bedburg

After many hunts 
for the werewolf Peter Stumpp 
they finally tracked him down 
for his gruesome stunts 
He roamed the countryside 
ripped innocent victims apart 
and while still warm 
he'd eat their hearts 

Tied to a wooden wheel 
they took red hot pinchers 
and pulled his flesh off 
in several areas 
They broke his arms and legs 
with a hatchet 
then burned the evil Stumpp 
after cutting his head off
