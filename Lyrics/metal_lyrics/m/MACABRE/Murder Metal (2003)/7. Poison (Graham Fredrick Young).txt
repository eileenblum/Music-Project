Graham Fredrick Young
was different from the rest
a child prodigy with a chemistry set
he would sit alone in his room and experiment
read about Hitler and his henchmen

Poison poison
Graham's little friend
Poison poison
Poisoning his friends

He poisoned his mom at the age of 14
she suffered in pain until she died
he poisoned his sister and his dad
they didn't die so his plot was had

Arsenic arsenic
Arsenic poisoning
Arsenic arsenic 
Arsenic poisoning

Went to trial, found guilty but insane
spent 9 years with the mentally deranged
went through lots of therapy
the doctor signed the paper that set him free

Poison poison
Poisoning his friends
Poison poison
Poison till the end

He got a job in the photo industry
made some friends and put thallium in their tea
he kept charts on their misery
of the heavy metal poison he put in their tea

Metal metal
Metal poisoning
Heavy metal
Metal poisoning
