The Unabomber sent some letters
To eliminate technology dentures
Bombs were built and they were opened
So people died from the explosions

If the Unabomber
Sends you a letter
And you open it
You may soon be dead

If the Unabomber
Sends you a letter
And you open it
You may soon be dead

Describe this hermit on a hill
Sent packages and made them kill
His mother and brother turned him in
For all of his exploding sins

Unabomber
