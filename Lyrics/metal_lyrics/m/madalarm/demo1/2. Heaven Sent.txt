Burned, unrestrainable, from, the unavoidable, outer shell
Feel, irresistible, urge, undetectable, so innocent

God knows, I tried, to stay away
God knows, I died, and lived each day

Inner sense, heaven sent
Inner sense, heaven sent
Inner sense, heaven sent
Inner senseâ¦

Heaven, sent
Heaven, sent
Heaven, sent
Heaven, sent

I fed, up, with the preachers
Saints sinners within
You took, back, all the features
Consumed with the sin

God knows, I tried, to stay away
God knows, I died, and lived each day

Inner sense, heaven sent
Inner sense, heaven sent
Inner sense, heaven sent
Inner senseâ¦

Heaven, sent
Heaven, sent
Heaven, sent
Heaven, sent
