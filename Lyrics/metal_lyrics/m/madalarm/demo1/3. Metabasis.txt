A dynamical transmission, metabasis in my vision

It's the hunting season
A shot for what I get
Metamorphic creatures
Falls into my net

There's no one, there is no one else to spare
There's no one, there is no one else to spare

Seven frogs [8x]

Seven frogs equals seven points, as you hear
I can feel my legs walking out of here, you got to
Peel them and grind them, before they escape
Prevent the damage you cannot accept
Peeling, and hiding
Peeling and hiding
Peeling and hiding
Peeling and fucking
Fuck it! I said, I can't escape from this prison, so
I bang on the fucking walls

Get bent, it's time to make a change
Get set, it's time to hit the drains

Dawn, in my backyard, sunset
Feel so frustrated, so I scream
