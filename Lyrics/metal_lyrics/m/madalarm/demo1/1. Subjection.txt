Denying your ability to make a change
Reality becomes a snowball
Running down the hill, straight in to the cage
It's called society
Donât ask what the country can do for you
Born in to socialization
The silent spiral that took your voice
Wake up from the anesthesia

World in decay, slowly, drowning
Show up your white flags, there is no escape from mass subjection

The power of control over human life
Poverty becomes ideology
A white collar fool with a kid and a wife
The poor can not be elite
Regard the material, and the money
Regarded money with social gap
Regard the gaps for abrasive violence
Regarded violence, murder and rape

World in decay, slowly, drowning
Show up your white flags, there is no escape from mass subjection

[2x]
Lower the DVD prices
A reality culture to keep the excitement
A flow of the garbage that doesn't comes free
Deduct the police, get inside public privacy

Security cams, and the missiles flying above
Stand a minute in a memory of.
Put a note in the wall and shed a tear
Say we are strong, we do not have to fear
