[feat. Ross Dolan]

Pozorny spokÃ³j zostaÅ zakÅÃ³cony. Krew znowu popÅynie, kiedy rany siÄ otworzÄ.

Terror!
Thoughts!
Power!
Pain!
Take!
Destroy!
Ruin!
Life!

We wait till dawn
to give you orders
There is no way out
Everything must end now
On our final day
One second away

Something inside will strike you
Just open your eyes
We use this force to guide you
To see the end of time

Flowing like a river
It can kill a nation
To ensure destinction
Mass depopulation

The final day is closer
the... final... day... is... closer [x4]

Entomb the children
At the dawn of warfare
Spread like a fire
Final day is closer


We choose violent ways...
...to depopulate!

Something inside will strike
Juest open your eyes
We user this force to guide you
To see the end of time
