YOU WILL DIE!

Thousands gathered on the killing field
Sun is setting and the air is cold
One more breath is all you really need
Will they ever discover you bones?

Terror â you may close your eyes
Hatred â you may turn you head
Dying â there will always be war
Peace is â for â the â dead

In â to â the â dirt - joining the dead
Lime â on â your â face â shot in the head
One â world â perished in the flames
Itâs â time â to - unveil the grave

You see â you see â your own apocalypse
You feel â you feel â feel when they crush your skull
You bleed â you bleed â bleed when they cut your throat
You fall â you fall â this is how you die!

Fallen is our race / Forgotten and erased
Returning to ashes / Civilised in mass graves
One more breath is all you really need
Will they ever discover you bones?

Terror â you may close you eses
Hatred â you may turn you head
Dyingâ¦ Dying â there will always be war
Fallen is our race
Retruning to ashes / Civilised in mass graves
