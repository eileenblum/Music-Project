I came to silence the universe
I am the blaze, everlasting flame
I am here to decimate your mind
I am the enemy of your kind

The light of the brightest of stars
The wind turning cities to dust
And like a cancer growing inside
I will not rest until you all die

I am the reason for suicide
I am the feeling when you die
The choir singing in your head
Sooner or later all be dead
I am the fire burning your home
I am the force breaking your bones
When I arrive all hope is gone
(I'm) noxious but you wanted me to come

I won't let you speak
you are on your knees
I will crush you down
I will make you bleed
I will burn your flesh
your soul will not rest
I will do the same
To every of the man

...you know the reasons I come
your voice was calling me home
you wished for me to appear
It was you who wanted me here
It was for you to deicide
Now every species will die
You wished for me to appear
It was you who wanted me here
It was you who wanted me here

I came to silence the universe
I am the blaze, everlasting flame
I am here to decimate your mind
I am the enemy of your kind

The light of the brightest of stars
The wind turning cities to dust
And like a cancer growing inside
I will not rest until you all die
