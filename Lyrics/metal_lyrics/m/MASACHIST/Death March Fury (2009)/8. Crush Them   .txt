Fall â for this was your destiny
Earthâs urine was in your veins
Pathetic humanity
Aiding its doglike face

Crushed â the weakness of human mind
A joke of the Universe
Cause you were one of a kind
And now your kind is dead

Fragile creatures â ruled by weakness
Your philosophers faced reality
Dogs are feasting on their corpses
Seeking wisdom in their anatomy

Why were you ever born
When you were never needed
Creating useless worlds
And words without a meaning
So now you are being crushed
Dead and forever nameless
In your place there is nothing
Empty stage â talking apes are gone

Fall â for this was your destiny
Earthâs urine was in your veins
Pathetic humanity
Aiding its doglike face
Crushed â the weakness of human mind
A joke of the Universe
Cause you were one of a kind
And now your kind is dead!
