Deah â bringers of pain, unleash hell and tragedy
March â walk with fire through the ruins, over the dead
Fury â no going back, we must attack
Man made apocalypse
Air â carry the desease, murder everyone when they breathe
Water â contaminate â through the earth
Fire â burn the skin â scorch everything â none shall live
Who survives this Armageddon?

The worm â the worm â The worm â Our cancer
We burn â We kill â We rape â We punish

Waiting to see you sufler
Waiting to see you suffer
Waiting to see you suffer
Waiting to see you suffer

We are the bloody wormâ¦ we are!!!
We are the bloody wormâ¦ we are!!!
We are the bloody wormâ¦ we are!!!
We are the bloody wormâ¦ we are!!!

Who is this worm? Why is it here?
Inside your wound It will appear

Conquest â occupy the land, in disguise of holiness
Famine â weak must die, suicide
War â violent times, justify, spill the blood
Death of all kinds and causes
Earth â hostile world, purify the land
Life â to disappear, no longer here, never to return
Bleed â tearing your skin, mutilate yourself
Pages of the Apocalypse
