Years of evolution - in - our blood
Secrets of our nature - we hide
Divided but conquered - as one
Every cell is dying - from inside

It was always waiting
Hiding since the dawn of time
All we have is taken now - taken away
Fear it now

Come whatever may
Like centuries without
Ahead and behind
A moment lost in time
Take the light awawy
Reversal of our birth
Our will to live is
Pointing towards death

you will take us - take us from here
you will take us
you will tak us - take us from here
you will take us

Let it collapse
Destroy itself
Ashes to ashes
End of the play

Banish all life
Consume the flesh
Nothing we are
All is the same

Feel the cold
Under our skin
Time to surrender
Letting you in

Swallow us now
And clean this place
Take this dimension
And make it a grave
