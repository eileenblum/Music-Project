Age of self deception
you will be corrected
Controlled population
Ignorance
you will will be the fuel
burning
In the machine of iron age

your mind is simple
you will need guidance
New generation
Weaking in silence

Bleed on the floor
Giants and insects
Workers in - in this modern age of iron
There are no secrets
Control and - mass surveillance interrogation
Torture and re - reducation

Everything is - simple
Human mind - is empty
Body will - surrender
We are guilty

Public executions apllauded by all men
Bodies burn in fire - beast is here again
