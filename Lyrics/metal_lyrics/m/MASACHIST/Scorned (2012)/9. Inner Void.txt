Now the abyss stares back
You know you cannot hide
Inhale the ashes, lick dirty bones
Deeper and deeper until youâre gone

Closer, closer, feel the tide
Hours, days, time runs out
Count, count, every second counts
Turned into waste, all becomes none

Seven waves of white noise
Distorted echoes are calling
Our souls will expire
So open your mouth of decay â¦and enter the void

Closer, closer, feel the tide
Hours, days, time runs out
Count, count, every second counts
Turned into waste, all becomes none

And now the abyss stares back

Come, let yourself be devoured
digested years compressed to hours
rust, decay, carry wooden boxes
move on, fade, memories and corpses

dreams are coldâ¦ like rats leaving your boat

Burning your tongue
Skeletal cage
The inner void
Cold souls escape
