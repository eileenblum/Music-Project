We left our sweat and blood
On every step of this path
As we challenged ourselves 
to become something else

Once you read the marks on our skin
And dive into our open chests
Youâll find the book of our trip
Itâs every letter written in pain

Straight and Narrow Pathâ¦

Youâll see the greatest sacrifice
In which we found our strength
Detached from the ways of common man
Patiently shaping the mind and the flesh

Straight and Narrow Pathâ¦

Not for a selfish pleasure
Never a simple vengence

I see through the wall of your lies
The ugly crawling thing that you are
An image of a wasted life
Iâll bring you misery and leave you scarred

Once you read the marks on our skin
And dive into our open chests
Youâll find the book of our trip
Itâs every letter written in pain

On this straight and narrow path
We became what we are
The claws around the prey
A lethal injection into their hearts
