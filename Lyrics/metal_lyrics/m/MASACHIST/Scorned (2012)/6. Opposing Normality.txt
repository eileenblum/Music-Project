Insanity is what you fear
A victim of normality
A paranoid slave
A manufactured mind

And day by day my hatred grows
Never conforming to the norm
I have nothing in common with you
Your standards are way too low

AGAINST NORMALITY
AGAINST YOUR VIEWS
AGAINST YOUR LIFESTYLE
AGAINST ALL OF YOU
AGAINST YOUR FOLLOWERS
AND AGAINST YOUR FRIENDS
FOREVER IN CONFLICT
IT WILL NEVER FUCKING END

Opposing normality
We spit in the faces of fools
Against your expectations
Never to obey your fucking rules

Insanity is what you fear
A victim of normality
A paranoid slave
A manufactured mind

Rejecting common mentality
I know I was born to hate
Despising your so-called normality
Disgusted by your mental state

And just like Cain and Abel
We are forced to play our game
And if we die there will be others
Opposing you in the same way
