This great ceremony begins
When the blade cuts through the skin
In silence you mutilate yourself
To die an honorable death

The purity of disembowelment
A liberation from your concerns
Salvation in the arms of death
Your spirit must be free from shame

CEREMONY!

Release me 
In honor of my name
Push the blade
To conquer the pain
Self immolation  means self respect
We witness you dying by your own hands

LIBERATION!

And finally you are closer to death
Almost free from the shadow of shame

You can examine itâs purpose
Every move is a step towards the end
You struggle and the torture seems endless
This is what you want, this is what you get

To lift this curse
And break lifeâs chains
Redemption through agony
Glory in pain
With bowels outside
You surrender
Your head falls down
You are liberated

It separates us from them
We rise above the norm
Through our blood, our sacrifice
We have acheived our goal

Surrender!
Head falls down!
Liberated!
Head falls down!
