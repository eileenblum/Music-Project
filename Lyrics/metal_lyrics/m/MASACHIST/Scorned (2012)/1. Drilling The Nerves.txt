Do you still feel the need to resist
When you know that you already lost the fight?

Try walking among the shadows
They hear the weeping of your wounds
One day you will join this quiet army
Attracted by the cold, defeated flesh

If only they could be sucked back into their abandoned corpses
To awaken the spark of life in their decaying, shallow eyes
They know there is no place for them to walk this road again
No more than faded memories and echoes of their long lost fight 
And it will manifest itself when you are all but prepared
To raise the curtain and reveal the hidden wheels that move the flesh

The blood that doesnât stop
The air forced into lungs
You left your motherâs womb
But the soil awaits your return 

I feel my soul is being slowly consumed by the unknown
Bite after bite it takes me closer to the end of my existence
What forces will move my body when all my powers are gone?
Most likely it will become unnecessary in its present form 

They know there is no place for them to walk this road again
No more than faded memories and echoes of their long lost fight 
And it will manifest itself when you are all but prepared
To raise the curtain and reveal the hidden wheels that move the flesh

You do not wish for those things to happen but they will
And all those desperate cries are for nothingâ¦

Can you hear the voices of the fallen?
They found their place among the roots
Fertilizing the soil so that new life could explode
Their useless flesh became a precious gift for our land

The blood that doesnât stop
The air forced into lungs
You left your motherâs womb
But the soil awaits your return
