Sharp is the sword that cuts the hands of thieves
The blade of judgement, the higher authority
Itâs the sound of justice and the words of the law
Before the sun rises you will hear our call

In the hour of judgement Iâm the one who decides
Thereâs no love for a traitor, no forgiveness for lies
Whatâs the meaning of mercy if itâs wasted on fools?
Blood will flow down your street, hear the trumpet of doom

Trecherousâ¦
Cowardsâ¦
Defeatedâ¦
Death was well deserved
Traitorsâ¦
Capturedâ¦	
Slaughteredâ¦
Justified punishment

Those who have no honor
Will die a dogâs death
Not worthy to be killed 
Still they cannot be spared

There can be no more patience
No excuses this time
We will enter your homes
You will pay for your crimes

Foolsâ¦
Bastardsâ¦
(So) ignorantâ¦
Glad to see you dead
Unburiedâ¦
Scornedâ¦
Spat uponâ¦
What did you expect?

You lived a life full of shame
Now itâs time for your head to fall
Take a look into the eyes of justice
Before your body hits the floor
No more generosity
Kneel before the higher authority
