You have wasted so much time
Trying to calm your thoughts
Faithful to none but yourself
Is this what you really want?

For those that lead you to shame
This will be a violent lesson
Itâs time to leave them behind
In the process of elimination

Cut them deep and make them cry
Eliminate what doesnât feel right
Evolving as time goes by
Finally you opened your eyes

the process of killingâ¦
This isâ¦this is a merciless selection
Reject the parasites that feed on you
Destroy them upon detection

Despiseâ¦
Eliminateâ¦
Analizeâ¦
Rejectâ¦

Wild flames consumed all you lived for
You know there is no more to say
By winds and storms youâre not shaken
Tomorrow means more than today

Leave all the fires behind you
You know those bridges must burn
Bury the life you once cared for
So there can be no return
