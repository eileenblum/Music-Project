proclamation of desolation
pure organic affirmation
carbonic transmutation
men to ashes, women to dust

bringing no hope
but dark eternal
written in stone
which has been rased
written in bone
in blood and eyes
measured in
the lack of pain

unaesthetic proclamation
we are the death

hunt prey breed rest
hide pray bleed die

bringing no hope
but dark eternal
written in stone
which has been rased
manifesto
written in bone
in blood and eye
measured in
the lack of pain

manifesto
