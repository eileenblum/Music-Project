Amongst the fallen
Consumed by fear
Waiting in silence
Judgment draws ever near

The casualties now grow
As the bloodlust overflows
Still striving to survive
Yet there's no place left to hide

No one can hear
Last gasp of breath
Alone to face reality
Surrounded by death

Blood runs cold
Soul slips away
Pray to your Gods
With life you will pay

Now to meet your maker
A construct of hate
Forced down the lonely path
Your final pulse await

And now you shall know
The misery bestowed
The life you once had
Is non existent
