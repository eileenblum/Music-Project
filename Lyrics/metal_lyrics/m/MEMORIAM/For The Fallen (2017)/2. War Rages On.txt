And so it came to pass
As time rolls by
Once more into battle
No questions why

The final stand
Life comes to an end
The last bastion
As war rages on

You never thought
That it would
End in defeat
Arising from the wreckage
The victory complete

And now you stand
Last remnants of man
This cannot be undone
The war now rages on

So now we rise again
Prepared to die
Another nameless victim
The enemy denied

Denied

War Rages...
