Leave this world behind
Never to return
Abandoned mortal shell
Escape this living hell

Free now
Life now ceased
Now in peace
A merciful release

No longer to live
Tortured existence
Death takes you now
Painful persistence
Life fading fast
Lost vital signs
Flatline...

Free now
Life now ceased
Now in peace
A merciful release

Left are those that grieve
Sorrow now released
Mourning life now gone
Spirit still lives on

Free now
Life now ceased
Now in peace
A merciful release

Flatline...
