Reduced to zero
Sum of mankind
Result of centuries
Humanity's demise
Increased by hatred
Fuelled by fear
Intention resolute
The prophecy foretold
The end is near

Look to the future
Erase the past
Create new existence
Better than the last
World free of contempt
Malice cannot infest
Void of hostility
Constructed with respect

Through the wreckage
Of this land
Ripped apart
By our own hands
Annihilation end of man
As the slaughter overran

Now behold what has been done
Mankind's journey is begun
Continuation eternity
Recreation identity

Reduced to zero
Sum of mankind
Result of centuries
Humanity's demise
Increased by hatred
Fuelled by fear
Intention resolute
The prophecy foretold
The end is near

Rising from the flames
No one else to blame
Devastation all we knew
We stand alone surviving few
