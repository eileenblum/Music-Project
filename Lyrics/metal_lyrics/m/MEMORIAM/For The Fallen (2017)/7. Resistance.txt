Resistance of power denied
Resistance we shall now defy

Call the Oppressed, the Partisan
In defiance, refuse the Masterplan
And we shall seek to undermine
All forms of authority
For now is the time

Now!

Resistance of power denied
Resistance we shall now defy

Systems now under attack
Contention it's time to strike back
Insurrection against their laws
Assertion a war to end all wars

As we speak of horrors now known
To face a new reality 
The seeds of hatred sown
Impending conflict a battle we can win
As the force strengthens
Let's resistance begin

Resistance!
