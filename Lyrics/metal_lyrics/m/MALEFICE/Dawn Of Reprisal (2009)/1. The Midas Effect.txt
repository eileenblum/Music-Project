The greed compels you to sell your soul for wealth
Blinded by materialistic and selfish views
With not a moment to spare you wish your life away again
So let the darkness consume you you tied the rope yourself
And what you really want is not always what you will get
With not a moment to spare I watch you sign your life away

Be careful what you wish for lest it comes true
Punished for his temptation the Midas touch finally opened his eyes
I watch events unfold the curse of the touch of gold

So you get what you ask for an unspoken truth
Money cannot buy you everything especially respect
With not a moments haste your world comes crashing down on you

Reverse this and disperse this an overwhelming sense of regret
Another liar to rely on what more else can you expect?
Awaken from this trance pull yourself together
Engage your mind remove all fantasy
