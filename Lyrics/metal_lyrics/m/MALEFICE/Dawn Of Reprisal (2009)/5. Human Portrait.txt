Here we have Hell in the purest form
The chain of command breaks no longer in control
This is my major weakness I care too much sometimes
I only trust my judgement I am just determined
I know I am far from perfect old habits die hard
I am desperate to prove myself to everyone
I am human after all

I will be the first to admit it I sometimes interfere
I promise you it is only because I care
I am not here to glorify myself this is a kind of confession
I need to get this off my chest so I can breathe again
I am aware that it happens it is my obsession
I know I am far from perfect old habits die hard
I am desperate to prove myself to everyone
I am human after all

I will pain a perfect picture of myself today
It is my time to reflect it is my time to see
To reflect on myself, the colour surrounds me
I watch in despair it is time to look at myself
Assess the situation, highlight my weaknesses
Sometimes I need to let go take a step further back now
I cannot let this fall apart this means too much to me now it is my obsession
I know I am far from perfect old habits die hard
I am desperate to prove myself to everyone
I am human after all
