As embers ignite in my soul I feel so fucking helpless
Today is like any day nothing is ever straight forward
Another failed plan another sacrifice
They pull together to bring me down
And it feels like that nothing changes
I cannot stop these feelings inside of me I cannot dull them
The walls come crashing in the chaos repeats

I walk a tightrope now wait for me to fall
Another friendly face strips me of dignity
A vicious circle rolls around and around
I cannot stop these feelings inside of me I cannot dull them
The walls come crashing in the chaos repeats

Hear these words I speak from the heart
Embers fall the fire ignites
They pull together to bring me down
And it feels like that nothing changes
I cannot stop these feelings inside of me I cannot dull them
The walls come crashing in the chaos repeats
