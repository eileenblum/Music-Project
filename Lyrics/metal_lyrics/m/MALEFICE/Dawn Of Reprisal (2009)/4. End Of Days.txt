Our death comes from above a sight for all to witness
We all knew that this day would come but we prayed it would not
Clouds of destruction mask the sun every action has a reaction
And the brightness blinds me
Fills me with misery and everyone will suffer

The ground it opens up and it swallows us whole
There is no time to think yet our sins we repent
And now our bodies return to the Earth
It is time to give back what we took
And the brightness blinds me
Fills me with misery and everyone will suffer

End of days tried for the crimes of a generation
It is too late for excuses we are already dead
Her vengeance rains down a population helpless
Our whole world turns to dust some say we deserve it
We have bitten the hand that kindly feeds our smite on existence
And the brightness blinds me
Fills me with misery and everyone will suffer
