Come to terms with what you are ultimately you have failed yourself
You make your own luck in this world that's something you are short on
That's your problem now nothing from me, you are on your own
Thank you for nothing so walk your own mile and see how far it is I have come
Here is a self made man so it can be done
You are an architect of your own demise

Use a mirror as a tool it is now time to reflect my friend
I have carried you this far I owe you nothing more
You cannot stop that burning that feeling
Embarrassed by everything you have done
Now your stomach churns that sickness you feel it
Resented by everything you love you cannot live like this
Here is a self made man so it can be done
You are an architect of your own demise

Why won't you wake up when will you see what I see
Here is a self made man so it can be done
You are an architect of your own demise
