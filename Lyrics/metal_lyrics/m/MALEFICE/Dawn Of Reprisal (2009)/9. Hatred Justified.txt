There is mass disbelief as our capital shook
With ample warning none of which was taken
Are we the ones to blame but that is hardly the point
Conspiracies forgotten and heroes shine

Hate justified take some time to remember the lives that were lost
Our spirit has been broken now but our hearts remain the same
And the scenes from this day paint a perfect picture of us
Hatred justified against all the odds heroes shine right to the end united as one

Hundreds of meters beneath our feet
Our people subjected to absolute horror
Praying they will wake up that this was just a bad dream
A nation looks on in disbelief

Lining up running away as the tunnels consume them
Chased by a fires embrace a polluted atmosphere
