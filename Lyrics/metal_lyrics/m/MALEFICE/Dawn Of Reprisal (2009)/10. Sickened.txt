The theft of a life the bringer of pain
Appearance is nothing we all bleed the same
Another waste a tragedy I did not know them, that does not matter
Embraced by a feeling of sorrow a nation speaks her name
With such a short time until tomorrow this feeling will last forever

With no excuse may they burn
Sickened throwing a life away
Sickened this would not be the last we see
Sickened you are poison in purity
Sickened a modern day tragedy
Embraced by a feeling of sorrow a nation speaks her name
With such a short time until tomorrow this feeling will last forever

What a world we live in and the double standards suffocate
Another sense of injustice another guilty party hidden
Embraced by a feeling of sorrow a nation speaks her name
With such a short time until tomorrow this feeling will last forever
