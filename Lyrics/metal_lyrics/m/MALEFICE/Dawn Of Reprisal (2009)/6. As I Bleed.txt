As the birth of a new day touches my skin I inhale deeply I feel so alive
Contempt in my existence, ready for another challenge
With a broad set of shoulders I will take on the world
Watch me bleed for you
I am getting closer than I have been before
We will get there in the end

I am not ashamed of who I am
I have learnt my lessons the hard way
A man that dwells, is a man that fails
It is not about who is right or wrong it is about your happiness
I have a desire to make you proud
Watch me bleed for you
I am getting closer than I have been before
We will get there in the end

Bleeding for you waiting for resolve I need to do something for myself once and for all
The waves come crashing down I am knocked straight off my feet
With no body in sight, I will pick myself up
It is the same old story a shoulder to cry on the roles reverse I am left to rot
Watch me bleed for you
I am getting closer than I have been before
We will get there in the end
