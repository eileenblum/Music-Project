A simple act of destruction where did logic go
You coward no pity for fools
No thought for your victims running for their lives
Your gun your choice paint the town fucking red
The blueprint for death perfectly constructed
A quick end for most an easy way out
Another man made solution a purpose built retribution
The voices in our head can be a danger to us all
Do not let them speak for you

A punishment your silence now speaks volumes
You cannot think you cannot feel
With a heart already dead a predator emerges
Your gun your choice paint the town fucking red
The blueprint for death perfectly constructed
A quick end for most an easy way out
Another man made solution a purpose built retribution
The voices in our head can be a danger to us all
Do not let them speak for you

These evil faces lurk deep inside the minds of everyone
These evil faces lurk deep inside the minds of all of us
These evil faces lurk deep inside the minds of everyone
These evil faces lurk deep inside the minds of everyone
From man to monster with evil intent all innocence is lost driven to violence
A punishment for all those times that no one ever listened
Your gun your choice paint the town fucking red
The voices in our head can be a danger to us all
Do not let them speak for you
