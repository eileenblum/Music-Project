Cross me once more fool me cross me twice and you bleed
No time for morals my reputation intact I am still here when you are not looking
I may lay dormant my guard is never down
Betray everything again I have to pick up the pieces of everything you have lost

A shadow casts across my face I am already forgotten
The limelight shifts and no one hears my voice
I have gone and lost my way searching for some guidance
The shadow moves the light burns my eyes
So fickle I cannot please everyone I will do what I want
Right now my enemies kept close to the edge of a knife
Betray everything again I have to pick up the pieces of everything you have lost

Again I am cast so far away
Reaching for answers I am blind to abandon hope
Now all hope is lost I have failed you
Again I am cast so far away
Reaching for answers I am blind to abandon hope
