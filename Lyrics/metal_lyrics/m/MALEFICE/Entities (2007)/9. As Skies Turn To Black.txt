These streets are in distress, another urban mess
Buildings stabbing skies, the clouds suffocate
A night out on the piss, a bottle to your face
Dealers on every corner, a town full of rape
It's hard to be prod of somewhere that's already dead
This is hell on earth, but I still call it home
As the skies turn black and the same fucking faces rise
Nothing seems to change
The taste of blood in my mouth, my hood goes up, my eyes go down
Welcome home?
As the skies turn black and the same fucking faces rise
Nothing seems to change
These streets are in distress, another urban mess
Pavements soaked in blood, the violence repeats
Strangers with guilty eyes, pathetic excuse of life
Fighting fucking turf wars, a town full of hate
The same fucking faces walking the streets
Hearts cold as stone, welcome home?
As the skies turn black and the same fucking faces rise
Nothing seems to change
