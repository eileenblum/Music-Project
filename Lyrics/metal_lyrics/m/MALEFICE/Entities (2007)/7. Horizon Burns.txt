When your sunny days turn to black, and all that's left is a knife in your back
With no morals you're already dead, and the sheep have scattered that you once led
You've betrayed only yourself, with an undeserved wealth
You're no longer welcome, I'll spit in your fucking face!
For too long you've been riding the storm, but at last your horizon burns
You're already dead, you're already fucking dead
With another trend come and gone, there's still more to come
When will the message get through? Where will it go now?
You have destroyed rather than create, you're a scar on my fucking face
Do you know where you belong now? Get back on the fucking pile!
For too long you've been riding the storm, but at last your horizon burns
You're already dead, you're already fucking dead
At last you get what you deserve
I'll watch it burn this makeshift world you've made
At last you get what you deserve, I'll stand and watch you fucking burn
For too long you've been riding the storm, but at last your horizon burns
You're already dead, you're already fucking dead
