You are over ruled, you are outspoken
Your time is up and I am stronger now
I don't know how but I have risen
I have overcome this world
I've never turned you away
Never again can I trust you, it's so unlike me to have trusted you at all
I can't believe you'd do this, you're fucking killing me
A traitor to all you know
Your actions speak louder than words
You fucking liar, you liar
You're pathetic and your morals are all wrong
I've never turned you away
Never again can I trust you, it's so unlike me to have trusted you at all
Taking your life from you
You are over ruled, you are outspoken
Your time is up and I am stronger now
I don't know how but I have risen
I have overcome this world
I've never turned you away
Never again can I trust you, it's so unlike me to have trusted you at all
