There's nothing wrong with thinking I'm good at this, I'm fucking proud of myself, I've fucking worked so hard.
You fucking doubted me, but I'm determined and I have achieved my goals.
I'll fucking prove you wrong
I've never felt this way before, it's liberating
You will suffocate in your demise
Now I've proved you wrong, come take this fucking noose from around my neck
This is my time, my place, my everything, so who the fuck are you?
who the fuck are you to dictate me?
As I walk into a new light
I've never told you how I feel, I've lived a lie
But now I've proved you're a fucking joke
Now I've proved you wrong, come take this fucking noose from around my neck.
Choke on your own lies. Fucking look me in the eyes
You know you can't win
There's nothing wrong with thinking I'm good at this, I'm fucking proud of myself, I've fucking worked so hard.
You fucking doubted me, but I'm determined and I have achieved my goals.
I'll fucking prove you wrong
