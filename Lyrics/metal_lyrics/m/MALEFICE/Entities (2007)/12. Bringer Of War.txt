Before me I see a kingdom ruined
With mouths sewn shut as far as the eye can see
They bring us war, they bring us reasons to fight them
Your propaganda is set to control us
Frustrating tears begin to burn my eyes
A foreign imbecile dictates our lives
They bring us war, they bring us reasons to fight them
The skies turn black
Their revenge will rain down upon us
The skies turn to black
Their revenge will rain down upon us
In the absence of logic we appear out of our depth
And with a nation in tatters, it appears nothing is left
As time goes on, the more we hate
The less we control, the weaker we are
They bring us war, they bring us reasons to fight them
