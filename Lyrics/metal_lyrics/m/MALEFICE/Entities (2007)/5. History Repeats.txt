As history repeats itself, another trend rolls right around
Because if there's nothing ventured, there's nothing gained
And as I walk onto tomorrow, take my hand be sure to follow
Because if there's nothing ventured, there's nothing gained
We will not be forgotten
Now as we walk onto tomorrow, take my hand, be sure to follow
Because if there's nothing ventured, there's nothing gained
As history repeats itself, another trend rolls right around
Because if there's nothing ventured, there's nothing gained
We will not be forgotten
I will tear you down
As yesterday bleeds into tomorrow, the same old shit soon turns to sorrow
If there's nothing ventured, there's nothing gained
So clench your teeth and make a fist, relieve yourself of burning rage
If there's nothing ventured, there's nothing gained
We will not be forgotten
