And this is where the memories have passed, and this is where the underdogs bite back.
Hatred burning, your fear is rising high.
And this is where we come to take control, and this is where the weak will become strong.
Hatred burning, your fear is rising high.
We will rise up through the ashes, once again
And now it's time to take what's ours, it's time to break away these chains
Hatred burning, your fear is rising high
It's true that the strongest hold heads high.
When empty promises pass by.
Hatred burning, your fear is rising high
We will rise up through the ashes, once again
Now we take a piece of our lives back one step at a time
Never asked you for help
We did this on our own
Through the dust we rise stronger.
Ready for the end
We will ride up through the ashes
From the ashes we will rise stronger
