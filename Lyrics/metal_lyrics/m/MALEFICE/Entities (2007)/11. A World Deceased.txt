Another step that's aimed forward, another sacrifice
Another torment, another chapter complete, it's time to turn the page
Another fucking addict, so kick me while I'm down
I'm not in control of my life, this world is mine, stop living a lie.
So it's time I took control
Why do you take what's mine? Every goddamn time?
So as I sign my life away, I'm greeted with a smile and massive regret
With every door that swings open, a hidden trip rope lies
Distorted truths from hidden faces
I'm not in control of my life, this world is mine, stop living a lie.
So it's time I took control
Why do you take what's mine? Every goddamn time?
This world consumes me as I fall down, everything consumes me s I fall down
This world will take me for granted, always
Now this is my time to stand up and face my greatest achievement to date
But no doubt you'll throw something back in my face
Why do you take what's mine? Every goddamn time?
This world consumes me as I fall down, everything consumes me s I fall down
