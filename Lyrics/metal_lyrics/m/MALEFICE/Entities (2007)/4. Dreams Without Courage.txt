Torching bridges I've reached the point of no return
Throwing myself forward this is the final fucking straw
I'm falling, I'm falling off the edge
Nothing more, nothing less, it's all I could give
I gave it my best shot, nothing more, nothing less
It's all I could give
I gave it my best shot
This is the only fucking thing that's left, so don't tell me to get on with my life
Searching for the answers, but nothing ever seems to fit
This ain't fucking easy, but then it wasn't supposed to be
I'm falling, I'm falling off the edge
Nothing more, nothing less, it's all I could give
I gave it my best shot, nothing more, nothing less
It's all I could give
I gave it my best shot
This is the only fucking thing that's left, so don't tell me to get on with my life
Climbing mountains, hoping not to fall
Remember me for what I lived for
When the sun has fallen, it's a death of a new day
We get, we get a little closer too
This is the only fucking thing that's left, so don't tell me to get on with my life
