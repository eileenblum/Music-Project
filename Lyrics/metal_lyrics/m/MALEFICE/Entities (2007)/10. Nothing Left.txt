Don't you dare turn your back on me right now
Fucking spineless, nothing but lies
Stand like a man and take the consequence
You're weak, pathetic, a fucking disgrace
There's nothing left, for me at all
I will fucking bury this, I will bury you
After everything has been said and done
It's apparent our time meant nothing
I was your brother but how things have changed
Your colours shine so bright
There's nothing left, for me at all
I will fucking bury this, I will bury you
Another thought to dwell on
It gets too much
Another lie for so long
When will this end?
Now!
These times are changing
We've reached the point of no return
These times are changing now
There's nothing left, for me at all
I will fucking bury this, I will bury you
