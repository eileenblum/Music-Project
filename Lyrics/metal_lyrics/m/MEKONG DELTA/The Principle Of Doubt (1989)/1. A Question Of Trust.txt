On the air
Words od wisdom spread across the land
And nod your head in faithful trust in me

So senseless - there's no doubt about it
So senseless - when you hear the latest news
So senseless - you'll accept my opinion
So senseless - as plain facts and truth

TV sets and the radio
We bring real life to your homes
This is the question of trust
Politicians
Talking about affairs that don't concern you
Just close your eyes and drift away

Switch on the TV
And you will find life's so much brighter with us
This is the question of trust
Come home from work
Feeling weary and out
We kill your boredom and thoughts
This is the question of trust
Pay some more bucks
For a fifty - inch screen
Our second hand world will seem real
This is the question of trust
