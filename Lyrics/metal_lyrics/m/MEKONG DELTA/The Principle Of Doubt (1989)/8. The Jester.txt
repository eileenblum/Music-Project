I'm a member of the motley crew
Pleasing the rich and kings
When I make 'em laugh
Nobody even cares
What's inside my mind
Don't seem to get what I'm looking for
And I can't stand it anymore
Can't you see
Can't you see

Don't drag me down
Don't push me 'round
Don't drag me down
Don't push me 'round

I'm gonna get what I'm yearning for
Break out and play my part no more
That's what I say
That's what I say

I sit and I wait till the big boss's calling me
Now I wish I could hide away
You'll see me smile
But I'm hurt inside
Now I wish I could break away
I can't stand it anymore
Don't wanna play the fool no more
Gotta break away
Gotta break away

When you gaze at me it's like
A look into mirror
And here is what you're bound to see
Someone like you
Leading a kind
Of life that's killing me
I'm gonna get what I'm yearning for
Break out and play my part no more
That's what I say
That's what I say

I'll be just I wanna be
Wanna be - desperately
