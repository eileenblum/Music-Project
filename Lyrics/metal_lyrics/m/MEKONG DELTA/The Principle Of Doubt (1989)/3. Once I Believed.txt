Here's a weird tale of madness
About what happened to me
I led a life full of luxury
Till I broke down on my knees
Cadillacs and furcoats
A mansion by the sea
Then lady luck walked away
Left me in misery

Once I believed
This couldn't happen to me
But now
But now
Everything has changed

A six inch blade cut through my hand
On that fatal day
Then the doctor told me
Slow death'd come my way
My woman went away, people ignoring me
Razor blades in my cornbread
The folks in town wished I was dead

Go away
We don't want you around
In this town
Don't want you
Don't want you

What they say
They don't want me around
In this town
Don't want me...
Don't want me...
