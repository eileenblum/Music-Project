The old bum - over there - holds a sign saving
The only way for you to live - never stop trying
A little boy - hands a note - over to me
The message there - on that note - is simple and clear
Don't ever leave the path - you have been walking on
Don't ever change - your ways, your ways - of getting alone
No chance for you - to escape - from your destination
Choose between good and bad - and make your own decision
Just be true - to yourself - and things will be coming
Don't ever try - to make them, to make them - smile at you
For in return they'll turn their back on you
A prophecy - that's what I say
And you'll find - some day
A chosen one - that's what you are
Some day you're bound to find your way
You will fight - in a world - that don't seem real
You'll have to fight in that world - you don't believe in
Don't you try to resist for things will be coming
Hit by a car - in the streets of deserted town
Wake up in dreams wondering - where you're around
A voice keeps calling
I will be lord of this land
I will be ruler of this land
No one can stop me anyway
This will all be mine some day
Run - Run - Run
Run but you can't get away -
Run but you won't change your fate -
Don't try hide away - I'll wait for you some day -

And you can't run away
Away from your destiny
You just can't deny
The part you're bound to play
