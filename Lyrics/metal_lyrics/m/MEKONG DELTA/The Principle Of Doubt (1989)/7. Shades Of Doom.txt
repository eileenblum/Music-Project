Can't control
My hands and feet
Conditioned to be a human machine
Can't control
My thoughts and needs
Memories erased...
My brain won't work
Without that chip - inside my head
The things I see - I can't define
Responsibility seems strange to me

Shock - I'm a victim of the latest
Fear - Gene technology
Shock - I'm trained to be a robot
Fear - To serve society
Shock - I never ask no questions
Fear - I never cause a doubt
Shock - I don't know what's going on and what it's about all

I gotta know
The reason why
I can't receive no signals anymore
Seems like I'm
Left alone
In a dying world
I did my job - all night and day
Now everything - has gone astray
There's emptiness - inside my head
I realize I've been long gone dead

Shock - Foreign determination
Fear - And the happiness I've known
Shock - Have faded with the signals
Fear - From my master's room
Shock - All wires disconnected
Fear - I see the shades of doom
Shock - Standing by the ruins fills my heart with gloom
