Ambitious
I am
Gonna save this world
Drums beating
Soldiers marching
Don't stand in our way
Over the hills
We march
The final showdown is near
I am chosen
To be
Savior of this world one day

Marching on
Through this land
My dreams
They'll all come true
I will never ever fail

We just do what's right
We will never die

The world ain't real
The weak one cries
Soon he'll face truth
Over the hills
We march
The final showdown is near
Dawn is near
But what I see
I simply can't believe
Soldiers, soldiers, soldiers everywhere
As far as I can see
Billions of enemies
Bound to tear my world apart
Now that I face the facts
I gotta realize
Something must I have been wrong from the start
I can see
Them smile at me
I know the end is near
That's the curse of reality
Curse of reality
You have got me down
You have shot me down
You have knocked me down
