Desperated urge to breathe
in your despair
you fight for air
ashes suffocate you
drown to death
dirt of dozen centuries
when you thought
you'd rule the world
swallow your own faeces
now for me

and tell me was it worth it?

Swallow the tears
you shed in despair
fight all your fears
this world isn't fair
jump out of the pain
into the fire
suffer for us
oh Mutant Messiah

One shall suffer
for our sins
one must die
so we can live
take away all sin
to set us free
the sins of dozen centuries
when you thought
you'd get away
swallow your own evil
now for me

and tell me was it worth it?

Swallow their tears
they're shed in despair
ignore all their fears
this world isn't fair
spit out your anger
spit out your fire
spit out deseases
to those who desire
rip out their devour
spit out the plagues
on this rotten empire

He came
from the fleece of the heathen
woven world of the elders
the uspoken, unseen
Creeping
right out of the remains of
the all shattered ruins of
the place that was home

Last planets breathing
but still no one knows whats right?
A bleeding heart is mine
And allthis veritable mutants
killing with a smile
white lily of the Nile
And all this spat out rulers,
lawless - vapid painted mall
A silent stone in time

Swallow all tears
we shed in despair
erase all our fears
this world isn't fair
ease our anger
light us a fire
heal our deseases
and shake off desire
lighten our hearts
and fill them with joy
we know you're a liar
you sealed our doom
Mutant Messiah!
