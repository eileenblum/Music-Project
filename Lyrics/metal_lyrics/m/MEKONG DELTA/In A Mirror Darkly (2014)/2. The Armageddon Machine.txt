One step more
feel no regret
future dreams
in all aspects
ransom thoughts
small scale projects

sneaking desire

I take care
humanity
will be there
eternity
final flare
insanity

ardent desire

Bit by bit
the way, no doubt
crawling fear
lost worlds around
final pit
there's no way out

carnal desire

Lightless flare
humanity
who takes care
eternity
no one there 
insanity

burning desire

A world in my hand
controls are set for the end
you may see clearer
and feel me
what do you think I am
I am the end

I'll be there
aristocracy
there's no doubt
democracy
will find out
idiocracy

heartfelt desire

Will wipe out
bureaucracy
spitting on
autocracy
than kill all
technocracy

sincere desire

Seeking for
stupidity
terminate
tranquillity
than looking for
absurdity
determinate it equally

avid desire

Who takes care
insanity
lightless flare
eternity
nothings left
humanity

awaken desire

You must understand
All this might power in my hand
Come, close to me
What do you see, what do you see
I am the end, the end

Illusion
confusion
storm in my mind
emotion
devotion
part of my reaction
distraction
one way to turnaround
to find out
silent shout
conclusion
collusion
damped mirrors all around
blurred boundaries
lost diaries
