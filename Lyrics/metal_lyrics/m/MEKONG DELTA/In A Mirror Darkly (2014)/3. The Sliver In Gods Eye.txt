Silent answers
with no deeper sense
tried to seek
while all ambitions failed
where am I now

What is mercy
what is fate
you have to reflect

And through clouds of ashes
shades of fame crawl around

Where are you
please forgive
we need your respect

Try to cover the corpses
melt by dawn of snow

Where are you
please forgive
we are not perfect

Out of one man's glory
like a monkey shine

Where are you
please forgive
you have to reflect...

...the live
the picture
all that I defend!

Every judge you made
leads into more sophistic hate
will bring you closer to your fate
a constructed bleeding gate

oh, I believed in ancious words
swallowed all of what I've heared
mirrored all this corrupt eyes
infused with submission
more than twice

mercy
