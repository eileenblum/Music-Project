This lurking fear
a frozen tear 
that's alive

Time to finally see
no one is free
time that we cast off
the chains of slavery
to live in liberty

All what have been
all what I've seen
walked through the times
thought it was mine

See this marching soldiers
In frozen nights
All they know
where to go
to spread holy fire
this molten picture
draft of time
human stricture
endless crime
errors in wasting
all their lives

Again, again
eternity wynts more
again, again
'til time stands still
what for
all restore

Creeping like a curse
dashing all life

Time to finally see
no one is free
time that we cast off
the chains of slavery
to live in liberty

With mindless pain
frozen in my veins
happened all before
must be once more

Created as a dark desire
in ageless nights
sailing soul
no selfcontrol
feels like barbed wire
scattered fragments
draft of life
godless segments
lost in hive
errors in wasting
all their lives

Again, again
eternity wynts more
again, again
'til time stands still
Again, again
eternity wynts more
Again, again
eternity wynts more
again, again
'til time stands still
what for
all restore

lost forever
trapped in time
sleepless dreaming
all of mine
