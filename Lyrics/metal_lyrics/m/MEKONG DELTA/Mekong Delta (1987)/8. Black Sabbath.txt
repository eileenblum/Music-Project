[Mekong Delta, J. Jenkins]

Sweet leaf, why did you turn around
I'm stumblin' snowblind through the trees
But what is this, that stands before me
It's an iron man of the grave 
Laughing and turning the cross upside down 
BLACK SABBATH 
War pigs, the snout full of rat salad
They march to the electric funeral, stirin' the blood
The wizzard, wearing the boots of mine
You are my wishing well in my paranoid dreams 
Laughing and turning the cross upside down 
BLACK SABBATH
