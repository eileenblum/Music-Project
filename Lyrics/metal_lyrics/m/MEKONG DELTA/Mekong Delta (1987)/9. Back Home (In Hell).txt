[Mekong Delta, J. Jenkins]

Back in the streets again
Jail's gates opened and
someone wished me good luck 
Where should I run to now
I once knew someone
Don't remember his name 
I'm decades too late
(I) don't live today
Now I'm back again - in hell 
I'm back home
I'm back home in hell 
Bang! someone shot next door
Someone robbed the store
Raging war in the streets 
Living undignified
Misanthropicy
Aimless creatures like me 
The times, they have changed
I'm still the same
Now I'm back again - in hell 
I'm back home
I'm back home in hell
