You dirty bastard
I still hear your laughter
In my mind
You torturing demon
Your victoms are screaming
At your crimes
Like creatures in cages
We wait for the slaughter
To begin
So hungry and thirsty
We're all at your mercy
Not again
We won't bow before you
Instead we'll ignore your
Oversight
You beat us and doubt us
You can live without us
Parasite

Wounded and weak
But the truth I speak
And I know what it means
To be a true believer
Bodies piled high
Against a blood red sky
I'm not afraid to die
'Cause I'm a true believer

Late in the night
You sneak in out of sight
An incubus
White pieces of bodies
Lay putred and rotting
Around us
In a prison of doubt
But you can't figure out
How we indure

My minds extremes
have been ripped at the seams
But I know what it means
To be a true believer
Bodies piled high
Against a blood red sky
I'm not afraid to die
'Cause I'm a true believer
Living and pain become one in the same
You've got ice in your veins

I don't believe you
I don't believe parasites

In the pain of the day
Seems you can't get away
From your cold stare
As the evening begins
I find my only friend
Is a nightmare
Like creatures in cages
We wait for the slaughter
To begin
So hungry and thirsty
We're all at your mercy
Not again
Just faces with no names
It's always the same game
Endeavor
What will you do when
We come back to haunt you
Forever

When your minds extremes
Have been ripped at the seams
Then you'll know what it means
To be a true believer
Bodies piled high
Against a blood red sky
I'm not afraid to die
'Cause I'm a true believer
Living and pain become one in the same
You've got ice in your veins
