Transgressor I am
The one
Force of the future
Control
The new ways are stronger
Obey
(your) Weakness is (my) power
Downfall

I'm the transgressor - Predecessor
Overstepper - Strong aggressor
Put your ways behind you
They only have confined you
They are the chains that bind you
Needn't I remind you
I am the tempter
Extravagant my ways
The worid is my
Menagerie

Freedom the dream of
The weak
Knowledge the scheme of
The meek
Boundaries of this world
Behind
Apes walking upright
Mankind

Transgressor born to lead
I will satisfy your greed
Soon you'll understand
The power I command

Transgressor the one
The process has begun
Soon you'll understand
The power I command

Reality is gone
The new weys are strong
(Transgress)
