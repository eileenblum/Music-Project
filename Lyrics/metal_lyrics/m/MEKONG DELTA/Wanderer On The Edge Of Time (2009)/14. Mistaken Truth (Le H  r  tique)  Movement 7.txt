Shortcut of devotion
Starring alien eyes
Clerics awkward prayings
God was out of sight

All this emotion
Squandered as hate

This prayed upon my mind
Hopeless try to understand
Live turned into frozen dark

Armed with my ocean
Jail unshed tears

Lost
Staggering hope
Go straight on

Then
I saw a place
A final trace
Whats going on

The fate laid out in sand
Bones once been a pulsing live
Ageless storm of senseless waste

Shortcut of emotion
Glowing in my eyes
As I started crying
God was not in sight

Canine devotion
Green fishing gear

Hate
Not enough
Broken words

Fear
Written down
Liars bluff
I found here

Flavor of a wonder
Searching for a proof inside

Reading inside outside
Starring blanky at the scene

Blood moon with a white flag
Sailing on a scourged red head

Blinded by a green track
Nightmare of a profane rite

Absurd might

"Stamp out all humans
God will sort them out"

Invasive promised sky
Ancient pages full of lies
Written down the holy eyes

Subtly temptation
Always been there

I am free
Can move on

Try
To find out
What the faith
Has wiped out

Flavour of a wonder
Searching for a proof inside

Reading inside outside
Starring blanky at the scene

Blood moon with a white flag
Sailing on a scourged red head

Blinded by a green track
Nightmare of a profane rite

Absurd might
