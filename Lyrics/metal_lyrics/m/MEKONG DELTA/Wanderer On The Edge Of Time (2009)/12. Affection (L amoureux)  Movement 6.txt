I already miss you
I don't know how long I'll have to wait for you
And I am anxious as always

I cannot forget you
You brought me out of equilibrium
And I still can't tell "why you"?

But I can feel that your poison is already in my mind

(You are the stormwind in my sails)
You are the air that I breathe
(You are the air that chills my skin)
You are the flame that burned my soul
(You are the fever in the night)
You are the fever - You are the cure
(You are the forbidden fruit)
Do you care for me, oh do you care for me?

Do you know my name?
Do you know what I endure for you?

For you I'd sail over seven seas
For you I'd bring kingdoms on their knees
For you even I would start a war
All for you
I will fight and fall

(You are the stormwind in my sails)
You are the air that I breathe
(You are the air that chills my skin)
You are the flame that burned my soul
(You are the fever in the night)
You are the fever - You are the cure
(You are the forbidden fruit)
Do you care for me, oh do you care for me?

Do you know my name?
Do you know what I feel for you?
