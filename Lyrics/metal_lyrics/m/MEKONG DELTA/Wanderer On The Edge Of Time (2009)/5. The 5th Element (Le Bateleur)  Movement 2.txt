Bluebird in slowmotion
Disturbed by a silent cry
I will never hurt
'Cause I'm that what they deserved

I create what they should see, sense of my life
I hope you see that's true, look in my eyes
All that what seems to be, part of my art
Who else should have this might, create this glorious
Light, no oneshould stop me

See me acting gently
Hoping to safe the lost blue sky
Don't know any limits
I was ready...

Anxious
To know - wisdom
To know - wisdom
In the end going beyond the pale

Endless nodes beyond the means now

Bluebird with no motion
Hiding spot of thoughts
Can't clarify

Bluebird in motion
Hiding spot of thoughts
Can't clarify

Bluebird in motion
There must be something more
a missing line

Time will not change me
This will always hurt
'Cause that is what they deserve

Diving into darkness
Tasting frenzy
Crossing madness
Finally moved the skies
Into madness
Mashed by power
Breathing boundless might

Anxious
To know - wisdom
To know - wisdom
In the end going beyond the pale

Endless node beyond the means now
Free

All you see is part of my art
No one else has this might
I create this glorious light
Now see!

Can't you see this glorious might
My world full of wisdom
A small part of what you once lost
A glooming power unleashed the fire (that) I am!
