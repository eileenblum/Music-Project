Wading through the desert ocean
I am talking with the wind

"See this world
Beyond control"

Cataclysm
Abstract vision
Green collision
Can't see clear right now

Aberration
Twin sensation
Fear soul nations
Preoccupied downfall

Fading out these black whit monkeys
I am now - reaching for this light

Lost of feel. Last frozen motion
Endless nodes of what could be
Kings will come apparelled satin
Merchants dressed in tailored cloth
And a hero, shrouded in sorrow
Mirror, mirror on the wall

Strolling through the library
Build out of human idiocy
Smeared letters of democracy
Razed traces of humanity
Clarify it finally

Everything I felt as good
Experienced as part of truth
Just have to learn
How to accept
Conspiracy is just a word
Abstraction for what is not sold
Award

Last planets breathing but still no one knows whats right?
A bleeding heart is mine
And all this veritable mutants - killing with a smile
white lily of the Nile
And all this spat out rulers, lawless - vapid painted mall
A silent stone in time
In time
