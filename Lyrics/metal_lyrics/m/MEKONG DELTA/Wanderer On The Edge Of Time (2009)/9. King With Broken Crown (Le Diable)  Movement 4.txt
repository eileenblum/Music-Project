Skull in my hands
Someone is mumbling in front of me
Nameless fear is all around
Don't believe what I was told
So I've found you
Condamned king of this pain

You are here

Look at me
Malignity
What you see
Eternity
Lord of fear
Can't you hear

I sensed the spite
Behind your golden mask
Awkward years I rushed through
Try to find you
Lost myself in agony
Sentiments, walled in heart

And this
Hokey
Talking
What you
Stand for
Freedom
Mankind

So I start a war
And silently
What they are dying for
And suddenly
Now I am blinded no more
And finally
Than I opened this door
It's you and me
Now I'm blinded no more
And finally
Than I opened this door
It's you and me

Don't stare at me
As if I am dehumanized
There's lot left to do
Blow our candles
Can't you see it in my eyes
I am the one who take the lives
And you futile hoping
Can't free all those
You love
Mankind

So I start a war
And silently
What they are dying for
And suddenly
Now I am blinded no more
And finally
Than I opened this door
It's you and me
Now I'm blinded no more
And finally
Than I opened this door
It's you and me
