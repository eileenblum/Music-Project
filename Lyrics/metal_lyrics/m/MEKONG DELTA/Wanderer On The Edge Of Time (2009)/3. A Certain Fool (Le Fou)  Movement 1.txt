A thought of what is true
I don't know for how long I've been around this place
One reason to live on
Don't know why this dark days should be mine
And those old ones - bodies of machines
Cold price for endless life
Still see those Gates I once stepped through

Nothing certain or true...

Frozen sea
Just reflect me

Tumbling through this unreal lifeless scene
Absorbed in hopeless thoughts
Don't know what happened to this world

All is certain not true...

What I see
Is creating me

Must be strong within my thoughts
Have to find someone who knows
Somewhere truth must have survived
I must walk on to find a sing

I don't know why
I don't know why
I
What's true
True
