Dawn !!!
Religious might was born
Kill 'em they have sworn
Excused by might of god they think,
they've got the rights to slaughter human life
Annihilate own kind

Thoughts !!!
Creating endless hate
The preachers always tough
Blood boozers of new times,
the perfect warriors - prayers of supremacy

Broken leaders
Cringing idols
Walking shadows
Fighting heroes of darkness

What we do know ?
Have a look at the past
Slobbering morons
Insane leaders followed to fast

What they want to see
People can never be
Puppets in an insane dream

Watch out !!!
The seed is growing fast
Fanatics all around
Poised ready to believe
This simple minded
Creeps will not try (to) shy away

Torturing unborn
Slaving people
Screaming unright
Yearning for rotten kingdoms
