Caught in Eternity
where you be lost in a dream

Where you can see what we forgot
where you can be a kind of god
unchained and free as it was thought
and then a wake up just to see

a Symphony of Agony
the Insanity of Reality

Crying soldiers
Bursting bunkers
Creeping humans dying

Alone on this battlefield
so called live lost full of hate

Nothing to see we all forgot
Nothing will be left by god
Outside a dream nightmare controlled
no need to wake up face the

Symphony of Agony
the Insanity of Reality

Dark clouds flying
Blood sun burning
Cold moon crying
Last men dying
Wiped out

The pride of mankind a threat, I am sorry
will lead to nothing
compromising evidence out of the past

A disillusion
No sweet surrender
outside the inside
mutilated aspiration
ease of mind
One last solution
clear up confusion now

Open your mind.
Don't leave your dream
And apprehend what I could mean.
Don't wake up!
