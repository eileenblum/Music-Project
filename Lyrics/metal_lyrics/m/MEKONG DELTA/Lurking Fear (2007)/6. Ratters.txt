Crying angels of deceivers,
flickering out of fainted screens,
Greedy eaten by the masses,
mutant tubes in agony
Seduced by words of wildcat content
Close your eyes in piece of mind
Unreal sweet dream
step by step lost of meaning
fade out of all doubts

Apprehend
fatal words of disillusions
crying loud for last solutions
Understand one can't trust cheaters

Among the Dead runs a fever
Contest for their best deceiver
And the one who will be chosen
destroys the world, no illusion

Blandish nightmare of emotion
stroking souls of wannabe
final attack of devotion
wading through insanity

Reduced as brute for final countdown
Close your eyes no piece of mind

Wishful thinking
deep inside tearless crying
betrayed by your own mind

Apprehend
Blandish words of so called leaders
slaves the mind for great deceivers
Understand don't trust those cheaters

Among the Dead runs a fever
Contest for their best deceiver
And the one who will be chosen
destroys the world, no illusion
