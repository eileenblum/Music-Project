No justice for all
'cause then we would fall
while famish for justness
(we) starved by lies

No jury in sight
No chance for a might
this poison of fear
so far and so near
small taste of a lost
of what we forgot

I've tasted the blood
in all that we've got now
and lie for
but no ones there
who takes care
who takes care
everywhere

Scorn,
for all human rights
the reason of deeds
declaring of fights

Greed,
the lost of all doubts
moral ran to seed
to rule and decide

Fear chaos is near
last silent cry
search for a why

and our science
in obedience
still tell stories
last convulsions
of a

wrong way - end of mankind
we know - end of mankind
