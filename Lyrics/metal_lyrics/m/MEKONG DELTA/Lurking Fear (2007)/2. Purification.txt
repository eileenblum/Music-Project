Five steps right
no place left to rest
inside nothing real

Fear - clean white coats around
Pain - angels might be found
Hate - final truth was told
Tears - freedom not allowed

Constrained limbs
cold blood all around as proof god is found

Fear - next one could be you
Pain - little gift for you
Hate - out of frozen eyes
Ruth - lamentable life

Darkness
somewhere lost screaming
inside first agony

Footfalls
the door gets open
your body is frozen
than you can see eyes, cold as ice

Laughing, crying, endless dying

Questions left no way to respond

Fear - clean white coats around
Pain - angels might be found
Truth - never-ending search
Lies - always by your side

Stumbling
sometimes you're creeping
Mind full of anxious fears

Strapped down
The blade well lighted
a final command
than you can see eyes, hateful eyes

Right time to tell you
what's their human right for
so that you can die for

Endless cries
their truth will be found

Fear - clean white coats around
Pain - little gift for you
Truth - never-ending search
Lies - always will be there

Finally
Their words are gently
Inside quite irony

Strapped down
your face well lighted
inside the mirror
than you can see eyes, full of lies
