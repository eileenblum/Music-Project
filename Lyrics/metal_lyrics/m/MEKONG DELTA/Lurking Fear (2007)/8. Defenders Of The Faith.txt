Hunt him, go and chase him,
he's envoy of scum of earth.
Kill him, go and burn him,
law says that he has no rights.
He's deaf for truth the words
we're told by god.

Chase him, try to kill him,
god will be now on our site.
Stone him, have to burn him,
we must wipe out this disgrace
for sure.
He's deaf for words we've told.

Genocide - Holocaust - Slaughtering
Mystique reasons
for the glory of god
spending life's
while using words for bad deeds
never sad

Absolution in their heads.
For a god, they never had
Execution as contract,
slaughtering people never met.

Reasons find some reasons,
than go for another war.
Deflect, try to distract
that what we are going for.
Want more hole world control overall
