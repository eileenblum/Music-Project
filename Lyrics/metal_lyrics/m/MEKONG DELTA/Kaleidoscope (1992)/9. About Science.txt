[R. Hubert, R. Hubert]

The pale sun spits a slow death down
to this blinded mankind
while the wooden horse of science
elevates a grey hell to the sky 
So the little superbrains
declare madness for sense
and fear, the mother of
all social violence
eats tiny pieces of
normal life as tribute for
general apathy 
The blue moon pukes compassion over
a world of concrete emotion
Researchers found some new lines
in their hymbooks and they read 
So the little superbrains
confused by their control
now will this be the end
or be the new way
Final death - we will see
the future of - can it be
look into my eyes 
Controlled by confusion
Confused by control
They feel like magicians
in our tortured world
Science now - the unstoppable
Weapon of - masterminds
Sacrificed - all the knowledge of
normal life - to their cause 
Science 
So the little superbrains
declare madness for sense
and fear, the mother of
all social violence
eats tiny pieces of
normal life as tribute for
general apathy 
One last experiment
gives us a second sight
too late the mirror of
all that's be done in fright
is slowly steamed up by
one more network of lies
losing all control 
Controlled by confusion
Confused by control
They feel like magicians
in our tortured world
Controlled by confusion
Confusion...
