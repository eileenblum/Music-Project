[Mekong Delta, J. Jenkins]

With tired eyes, too scared to rest
I feel so cold inside
This weariness! but I can't sleep
It keeps me stay awake, oh, why? 
Through the old window
from out of space
He must have seen it
long time ago 
I ran away from
the Rue d'Auseil
Where he banned our downfall
in other dimensions 
(and he gave his life away for the world to live on) 
What have we learned?
Nothing has changed...
