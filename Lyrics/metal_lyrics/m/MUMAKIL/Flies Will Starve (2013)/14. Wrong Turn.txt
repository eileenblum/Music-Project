You've woken in a state of apathy
Paralyzed by fear
You thought you were safe
Dogmatic pressure is upon you now
Spend your life for a job you fucking hate
No one gives a shit
Forced to live on your knees
By decree of white collar prophets

Can't you figure out your own fall
Rope around your neck
You're just a slave
This hidden war is already lost.
