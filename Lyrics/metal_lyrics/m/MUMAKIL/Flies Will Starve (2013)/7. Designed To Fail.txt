Packaged in a can
In which you have to fit
Proud of a dream you've been forced in
You're designed to fail

Blinded by the fear
Of being wrong
Deformed by your beliefs
You're designed to fail

Lost in your shit dream
Absorber of useless goods
Excreter of useless talk

You're designed to fail

Lost in your expandable shit world
Absorber of useless goods
Excreter of useless talk
The puppet never knows the puppeteer

Why shouldn't we burn the whole place down?
