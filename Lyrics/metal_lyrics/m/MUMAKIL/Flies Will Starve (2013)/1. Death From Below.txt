The bastard eagle is spreading its wings
Keeping an eye on your homeland
And keeping both on your back

Majestic symbol of freedom and might
Some kind of beautiful thread
Aiming at you through the clouds
Waiting for its time to strike

We're down on the ground
But luckily we're more than you
Death from below!
