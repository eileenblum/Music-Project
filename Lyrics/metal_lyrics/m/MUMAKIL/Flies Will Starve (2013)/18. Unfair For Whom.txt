Ironing your war-like panties
As a perfect display
Waiting for the next riot
Chilling on the sofa

Two-faced but hidden behind your silk scarf
Won't show your perfect white teeth to the media
Btu give them this newly manicured finger

Try to make me believe
You're sick of this unfair existence
But unfair for whom?
Certainly not for you!

As far as I can see
You're daddy's punk
On his Sunday revolution

As far as you're concerned
When the time to run has come
Get your gold-plated ass
As quick as you can
In the warmth of daddy's home
