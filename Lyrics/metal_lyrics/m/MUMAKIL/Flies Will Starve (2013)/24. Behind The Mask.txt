Silent as a blank sheet
Blinded by your so-called wealth
Look what you left behind you

What can you expect
When all hope is lost?
You signed your own defeat

You own the right
To shut your fucking mouth
Look what you left behind you

We've made our choice
Collapse cannot be avoided
You signed your own defeat

A thousand sleepless nights
Learning to lie to yourself

You dug your own grave
Just when you turned your back
Closed out from reality
You've got to escape from this

There's no need to talk
To swallow barbwire
There's no need to talk

Born as a hero
You'll die as a fucking insect
