Treachery's gone too far
Your path leads to outcomes you can't deal with
Mocking rulers, gangrenous warts
Promising a cure for a disease you're sponsoring

To better quench your greed
You all bow to the lobby

Fucktards parade
Keep appearances up while secretly uniting
To the scumbags they blame on stage
The audience cheers, they cash their profit-sharing

To better quench their greed
They all bow to the lobby
Sacrificing centuries of evolution
On the altar of consumption

All in good time, you'll get what you give
Politics merging with industry
Spreading profit-seeking demagogy
To better quench your greed
You all bow to the lobby
You scumbags merging with fucktard elite
You'll get what you give, you have it coming!
