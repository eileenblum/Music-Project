Working to live and living to waste your time
Begging for the obvious
Pants down! On your knees!

I can't stand anymore of your moaning
Just can't stand anymore of your tears

Those rights of yours should be taken
So take them or steal them!

Those upstairs need you to be their slave
And as a slave you shall be sacrificed
