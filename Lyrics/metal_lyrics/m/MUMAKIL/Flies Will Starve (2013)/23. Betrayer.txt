No one's on your side
Never look back, you've lost your way
All your steps are leading to nowhere
I have a plan for stupid fucks like you
Move yourself into the line of fire

How much time will you spend

Searching for a bitter end
I'll put the final nail in the coffin
Of your worthless plan

Just think twice and
Get the fuck inside your hole
Talk to my hand, you can't dodge this
You're a leader in shit backing
I'm better off without you

Freedom of talk for the dumb
The fucking apple fell
Too far from the tree
