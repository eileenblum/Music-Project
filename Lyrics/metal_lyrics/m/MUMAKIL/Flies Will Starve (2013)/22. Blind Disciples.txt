Countless years of mass destruction
Will lead us to the end
Everyone is going to suffer

There's nothing more to wait from them
The bastards are leaving the boat
Afraid to lose their wealth

Their leader is gone there's no more God to pray
They have a nice place for you on their island of greed

Free hanging for the assholes
Delight for the lies that blind
