Prisoner of your own image
Forged by years
Worshiping gods that were created
To keep us blind

You'll get the first place
In the bastards' hall of fame
We don't give a fuck
About what you pretend to be

This is your own defeat
You won't get respect
Through such miserable acts

Always complaining about yourself
Never here to walk into the lion's den

A lesson well learned
Your face speaks for itself
Fifteen minutes of glory
Is just what you'll get
