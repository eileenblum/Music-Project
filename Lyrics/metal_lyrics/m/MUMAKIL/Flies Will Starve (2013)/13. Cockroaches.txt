Oh Sensei please teach us
For you've nothing more to learn
Behold the cockroaches from above

As the unstoppable flow
Of your knowledge enlights us
We the plebes are all yours

Still got nothing to say but still omnipresent
Still got nothing to say but still talking shit

The only thing you know about the sea is the shore
You arrogant fuck, you ignorant freak

Using your tongue as if you were chewing shit
The stench of ignorance precedes you
A massive ego that still makes you think
You're smart enough to prove the others wrong
