You're another brick in the wall
They've built to keep us blind
Ignorance through consumerism
A new religion for trendy fucks

Twisted truth and apathy
That's your new reason to live
Do you need anything more?
Get a fucking brain!

Welcome to the new era
Where easy cash leads every fuck on Earth
You'll taste the skill of my Morgenstern
Everything changes except the bastard that lies within you

Payback time is now
Consider this as a warning
You're a fascist teen
Who deserves a good neck-breaking session
