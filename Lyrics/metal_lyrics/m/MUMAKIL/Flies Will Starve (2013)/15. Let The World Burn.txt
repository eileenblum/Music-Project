Let this fucking world burn

They know who you are
What you're doing with your life
They will seek every move you make
Every word you speak

Giving out the truth
For a better world
The assholes are everywhere
But who cares?

Reaching the top level
Of the ignorance scale
We're taking ourselves back
To days of shame

Building a new graveyard
Today's idols are scum

Wait for your turn
To be smashed on the ground
Feel the pain
Going down your spine

Creating fake dreams
To better steal your life
An existence spent on running away
From their lies
