Keep thinking for yourself
What you call being human
Don't want a part of it
Now it's time to turn them off

They'll tell you anything
That is good for your ears
Don't want a part of it
They are the illusion

Wait for false benevolence
Masses driven in frustration
Don't want a part of it
They are the illusion

Time has come to dig your grave
I'll be the first to piss on it
Time has come to dig your grave
Ask for help, throw yourself in Hell
