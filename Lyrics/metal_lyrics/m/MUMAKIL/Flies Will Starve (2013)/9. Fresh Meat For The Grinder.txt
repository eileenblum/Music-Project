You signed for war
You'll get respect, they said
As a dickhead
You got what you deserve
A painful bleeding death

You signed for war
You'll get new nuts, they said
Specially close to your dead friends
So fucking far from home

Seeing yourself as a brick
In the everlasting wall of liberty
Much better than an asshole
You're now a breach in the line

Fresh meat for the grinder
