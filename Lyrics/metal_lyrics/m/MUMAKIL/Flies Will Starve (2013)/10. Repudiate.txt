Always first on the list
To stab my back
Never here when
You're brothers are down

A perfect witness
Of my own defeat
The lights are on you now
So play your perfect role

You already won the game
But who will be there
To watch your crown

I'll never put my trust in your dirty hands
But the smile on my face will be
The last memory you'll have from me
