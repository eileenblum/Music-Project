You used your voices as you were asked
Followed a shepherd that fucks you up
Gathered by mindless leaders
Your majorities stink

Democracy false flag
Time is over
You should have thought about that before

War as a therapy
Carpet bombing remedy
The people's roar has been heard

If that was a joke, then I didn't get it
Dropping the Lord's burning wishes
Over the infadels' heads
