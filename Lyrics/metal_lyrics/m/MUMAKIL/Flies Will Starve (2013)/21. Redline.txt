We put our trust in justice
Praying God to define our enemies
Learning to kill on request - God's request

How could we know? Why should we know?
We've never been told

War is beautiful
Fireworks everywhere
Bloody remains
Blown up in the air

The rope is not strong enough
To support the weight of your bullshit
The tunnel has no end
Flies will feed on your remains

One more step back
You'll get what you give
One more step back
Return to the grave
