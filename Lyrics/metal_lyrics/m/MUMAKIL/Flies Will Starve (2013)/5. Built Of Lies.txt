Too late for apologies
The line has been crossed
I'll unleash fucking Hell on this world
Hordes of flies will starve

My disgust is feeding my burning hate
What the fuck have I become?

This futile story will find its end
Never short of those brilliant ideas
To justify your lies

You're not the first to fall from grace
You'll hit the ground endlessly
The day has come for the wheel to turn
All your efforts are in vain

Nothing will remain

You think you're different
From everything you hate
You'll hit the ground endlessly
Another day, another pointless hope
You'll fucking hit the ground
