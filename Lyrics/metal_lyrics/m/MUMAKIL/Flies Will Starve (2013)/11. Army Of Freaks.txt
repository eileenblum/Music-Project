Drowning in your cash flow
Asleep and bored
Self-righteous Christian fuck
They find a new reason for you
To overcome your fears
Grab your camera
And make a paparazzo out of yourself
Squeal on your friends

Submit the information
To the central brain
CCTV - citizen
Fucking traitor

Rejoice, your life now has a purpose
You're just an eye stuck on a pole
Fighting bravely for the safety of all
Cleansing the streets for the new order to come

You're feeding their so-called system
Frightened freak
Adding your own pathology
To the global disease

As the weather turns you're waiting for a sign from your master
