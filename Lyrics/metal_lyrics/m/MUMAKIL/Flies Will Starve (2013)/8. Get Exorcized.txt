Wake up you lazy fuck
Or in your sleep you'll be struck
Remnants of a lazy pagan past
Shall be tolerated no more

You're nothing without Him
We're nothing without sleep like you
Act as you were told then
And rejoin God's front line

Instead of praying to your God
Oh Lord, let the meat be juicy
Ducking your head and checking the floor
Through your 50-pound meal
Just get 25
Stop praying and get exorcized
