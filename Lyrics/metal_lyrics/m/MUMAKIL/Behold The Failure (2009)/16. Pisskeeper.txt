Why do I have to explain to you everything twice, you stupid fuck?
Why should I feel the need to justify in front of you?
Your authority means your gun, and your brain is too small for your skull.
Protecting us from them, but who protects them from you.

Fuelled by pointless brutality,
Chosen hopelessly
Is this the job of your life?
You would have been to become...

But you choose to become a cop,
The blind fist of injustice
You choose to become a cop,
On your face I piss.
