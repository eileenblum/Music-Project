You want to live to work and behold your world,
Once you'll be old, fat and sad,
Don't give a shit about what you life for,
Don't give a shit about nothing more.

Behold the failure,
Is still not enough,
So please start to hate us,
It shouldn't be so tough.

Give us back hope
By cloning the next Pope.

First on the list to judge and condemn,
No reason for coldest, the TV says it's yes.
Your perfect system changes you into scum,
Your time will come.
