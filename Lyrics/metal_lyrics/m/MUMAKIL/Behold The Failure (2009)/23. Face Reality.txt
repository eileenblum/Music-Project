Face reality, stop acting like a slave
Your ignorance is your weakest point.

Thanks to God for making me discover a two thousand old shame,
I will make my way to heaven, flying over your sinner corpses
Begging for the daily whiplash
Orgasm through pain

Burn your local priest,
Crush the global dogma
