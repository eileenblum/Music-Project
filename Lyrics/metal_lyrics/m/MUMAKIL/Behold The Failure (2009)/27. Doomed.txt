The end is at hand, the winds of chaos are blowing,
Chaos and lost civilizations.
Our global leaders march for rise to power,
As radiation keeps on spreading,.

We're condemned to grow in this filth,
And to infinitely bear the cross.
The kings of the earth
In their quest of power
Have condemned us all

Contamination through religions, trends, false hope
The beast disguised in an angel, fallen demigods
Politicians now will pay for greed,
Brothers In Slavery

You don't fit in the place you should,
Not doing the job they made for you,
Following steps too big for you,
Shut your dreams down as you're told,

Walking on another cast step,
Hold the line as you shall be crushed,
Rising up the sleepy crowd,
Until you head gets chopped.

We don't give a shit about your world dominion,
We do not belong to your fucking herd,
Don't need or want your global advices,
Spit on your face from this worthless place.

We shall not be the Brothers in Slavery,
We will not be the Brothers in Slavery.
