We're the hate breeders,
Damage is our cause
We're destruction bearers
We burn what we're taught
Order is fucked up
Choose not to be innocent

Refuse self-infliction
Destroy your servitude
All they deserve is to rot in hell
If you run, you're one of them

We're seeds of anger,
Damage is our cause
Destruction's our motor,
Fight - the world is fucked up,
Feel the rising rage,
We're natural born haters
