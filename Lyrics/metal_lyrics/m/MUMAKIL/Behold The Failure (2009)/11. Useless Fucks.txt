We were walking down the street,
Going to the pub to laugh and drink,
When the stupid boneheads assaulted us,
Ready to fight, we beat them down.

Propaganda, always the same argument,
Create your own vision of history,
You are brainless, this is no scoop,
We will fight your stupid rhetoric.

Right wing's not a solution
When you're frustrated by your own life,
Your world is full of disillusions,
When you see that's all lies.
