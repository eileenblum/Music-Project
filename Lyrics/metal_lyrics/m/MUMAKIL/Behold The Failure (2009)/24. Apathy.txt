I don't give a shit about the price you let on me,
Won't work to fill your pockets anymore,
Fuck your incomes, we don't belong to you
Just keep your fake smiles for your kids.

Let's steal the money from the rich and use it for goods,
Blast off the walls around you
And feel welcome where you're not

You're not my boss, just high on cash
I will do my part to help you fall back on the ground,
And make sure you fall on something hard.
Taste the sweetness of real life.

Archaic hierarchy,
Military discipline,
Global prison,
Pathetic submission.
