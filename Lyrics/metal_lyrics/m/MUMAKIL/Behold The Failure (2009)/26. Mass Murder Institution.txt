Hundreds deaths per year,
That's not enough for them
And for their traditions,
They would do anything

Neutral country
But necessary war for you,
You're given warfare
That you keep at home

In spite of many warnings,
Our government denies any responsibility,
In the slaughter to be perpetrated.
A decimated family, Massacred citizens
That's not enough for them
To finally change that
