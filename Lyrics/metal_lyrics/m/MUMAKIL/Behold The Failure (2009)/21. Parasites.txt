You're not a hero - Heroes stay alive
Just a dead weight carried in a bag by other scumbags,
Waiting for their turn to never return,
And reach at last their well deserved peace.

Remove the parasites, Reconquer the land
Remove the parasites, For freedom you stand

Back in pieces in a body bag,
Disposable meat, I won't cry for you,
Carrying lights to the dark side of the world,
The choice was yours, you fuck.
