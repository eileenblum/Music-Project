Downfall of a system that allows each slaughter,
Hypocrites of revolution, their lies brought damnation and greed,
We're all destined to burn

Welcome to the days of affliction and the end of man,
The enemy is coming through our minds,
We're trapped in disbelief of a modern world in misery,
What progression are you living for...?
