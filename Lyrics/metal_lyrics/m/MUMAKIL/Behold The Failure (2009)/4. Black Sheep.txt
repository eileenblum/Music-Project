Pay to be born
And belong to this expandable mankind,
Looking for yourself for years,
They're watching you from your birth

Pay to be born,
And belong to this expandable mankind,
Looking for yourself for years,
A righteous Christian you'll become

Piss off, you black sheep
Get the fuck back to work!

It's behind you, waiting for you to fall,
It's upon you, laughing, crawling down the hole.
