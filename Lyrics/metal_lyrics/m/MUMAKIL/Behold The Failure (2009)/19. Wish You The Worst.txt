Keep out of my world, stay close to your fake friends,
The ones you thought were on your side,
Keep out of my world, stay close to your fake friends,
They may not remain yours for long.

Who the fuck are you fucking with?
Keep in touch with your brain,
Who the fuck are you fucking with?
Payback time for soon

I wish you the worst,
Get the world rid of you,
You're making the world ashamed,
I wish you the worst.
