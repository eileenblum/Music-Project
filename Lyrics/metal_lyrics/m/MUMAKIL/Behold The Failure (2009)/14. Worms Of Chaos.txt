Stop talking, and begin to do what you say.
Waiting pointlessly for someone to wake you up.
Stop trying, just begin to do what you say.
Could today be the day?
The D-day won't be waiting for you.

May the worms of chaos dig their way through your mind,
Your lack of anger is keeping you blind,
So what are you? Your own master or your own slave?

The right to disagree has been removed, But you didn't move,
Keep an eye on your right to breathe
