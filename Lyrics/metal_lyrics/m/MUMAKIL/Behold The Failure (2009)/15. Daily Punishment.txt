Human waste, hordes of vermin
You're locked in and wait for their verdict,
Punishment - critical end,
Contaminate - erase the system,
There's no escape from this trap,
They will crush everything you stand for.

There will be no justice, innocents shall suffer in silence
Praying for a god of deviance and bastardization,
Waging a war for progress, targeting nonsense theories
Procreating our own demise and self-termination

Watch them as they punish you,
You claim for vengeance,
Anyway you're fucked, so die in pain.
