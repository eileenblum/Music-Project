Look what it takes to survive - burn it down.
Conscience of systems of lies - fact twister
Don't try to tell what or why - I am for
There's a black hole in my mind - The eye of wrath.

I won't forget, because I won't forgive.

You'll pay for the faiths of the blind,
For mournings and missing bodies,

I'll crush you, no mercy, dead or alive,
For young spirits you've hypnotized,
Beware of the evil glow in my eye
You keep stirring up my wrath.

Look what it takes to survive - open wide,
There's a black hole in my mind - the Eye of Wrath
