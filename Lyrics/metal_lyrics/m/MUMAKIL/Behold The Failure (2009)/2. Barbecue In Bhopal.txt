Mountains of waste, rivers of dried blood
Hail to the new terraforming human virus,
You should be useful as liquid plant food,
Facing the last aeon

But the sky's still blue,
Let's party until it turns to green
The sky is still blue, so who gives a shit?
Drop a piece of that guy on the grill,
And grab me a beer.
