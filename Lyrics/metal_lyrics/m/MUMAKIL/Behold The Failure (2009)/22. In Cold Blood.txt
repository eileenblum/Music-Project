You were born in a high-class system, drenched in apathy
Consumed by your own greed,
Always trying to know in what trend you shall believe
I shit on your face, and spit on your achieved way of life

Negativism is the answer to this false community,
Victimisation is the next step of your sad fucking life,
Rotting in hell is what you deserve,
You're right, sucker: cut your own throat and pay the bill.
