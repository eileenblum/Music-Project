They're fighting for their father's mistakes
For the ancient wars, for age-old genocides,
How many decimated brothers
For greedy reasons and venomous pain?

Here we are, with our growing hate,
With nothing in our hands, facing guns and tanks.
How much blood will politicians spill,
To protect lost relics and their sick glorious bills?
