I'm a terrorist, my life exalts in death
Saviour and monster, the world's my slave and bitch
I'm a terrorist, your life's shit to me
You'll die when I decide, I'm a hero bomb.

Your God is a fake, Truth's my associate
Greed - I'm on my way to rape virgin sluts
Your fear's my euphoria:
Ask for it, you got it

From east to west, I'm the beast - Fear me
Send us more soldier boys,
Praise me, beg me,
Hail to the new era's predator
You profane cunts
