You don't fit in the place you should,
Not doing the job they made for you,
Following steps too big for you,
Shut your dreams down as you're told.

Walking on another cast step,
Hold the line as you shall be crushed,
Rising up the sleepy crowd,
Until your head gets chopped.

We don't give a shit about your world dominion,
We do not belong to your fucking herd,
Don't need or want your global advices,
Spit on your face from this worthless place.

We shall not be the Brothers in Slavery,
We will not be the Brothers in Slavery.
