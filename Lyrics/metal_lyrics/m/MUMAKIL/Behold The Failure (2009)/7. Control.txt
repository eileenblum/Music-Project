How long can you hide the truth?
Systematic manipulation,
You're caught in a lie,
Your life is a pile of shit.

You're brought into emptiness,
There's nothing more to lose,
You're caught in a lie,
Your life is a pile of shit.

Taken in a devouring sphere,
Can you feel your bowels melt inside?
An organic layer seizes you,
The final product of an infernal chain.
