Take a look behind you and tell us what you don't see,
You finally realize you're not the leader of your life,
Dreaming of Kingship, but you're a pawn.

Does it hurt?
It's the Chronicles of Yourself :
They're building your life.

Unable to rip the leech,
And afraid to bite the master's hand,
Waiting for the whip reward,
Your master should be your meal.

There's nothing in return,
There's nothing to expect.
