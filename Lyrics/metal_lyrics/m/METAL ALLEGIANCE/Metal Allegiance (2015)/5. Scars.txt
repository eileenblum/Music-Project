Scars from all my lessons learned
Theft of my possessions earned
Cautionary tale of woe
You reap what you sew

Fallen in the land I call home
I look into a future unknown
Lost is the race we've become
There's nowhere left to run

From massive repression
And passive aggression

The world spins on
Mother earth has cried
Our hope is gone
The innocence has died

You'll stand, you'll fall
Only the strong survive
Convicted prisoner
Sentenced to this life

Winter of my discontent
Broken promise never meant
Once was blind but now I see
I've got to be free

Hounds, they won't leave me alone
Gnaw my spirit of flesh to the bone
Howling away as they go
And the blood starts to flow

No pacification
From this indignation

The world spins on
Mother earth has cried
Our hope is gone
The innocence has died

You'll stand, you'll fall
Only the strong survive
Convicted prisoner
Sentenced to this life

Consolation is bitter
Pill to swallow
Pearls of wisdom fall
With nothing left to lose
You've got to listen to
The voices deep inside you
Your path is written by
The methods that you choose

[Solo: Skolnick]

The world spins on
Mother earth has cried
Our hope is gone
The innocence has died

You'll stand, you'll fall
Only the strong survive
Convicted prisoner
Sentenced to this life

Massive repression
[SPOKEN:] The world spins on

Passive aggression
[SPOKEN:] When Mother Earth
Has cried

No pacification
[SPOKEN:] All hope is gone

From this indignation
[SPOKEN:] The innocence has died
