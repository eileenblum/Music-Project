Down on the dark streets below
Reject the phoenix and regain control
A million memories that you never had
A pathetic attempt to erase the past
My truth will burn your lies away

You gave
You gave me a gift
You gave
You gave me a gift of pain

You gave
You gave me a gift
You gave
You gave me a gift

For blessed years
I never saw your face
You disappeared
But you never changed
Iâve come to understand
Your weakness again
Dragged my name through
The mud in punishment for your sins

My truth will burn your lies away
You gave
You gave me a gift
You gave
You gave me a gift of pain

You gave
You gave me a gift
You gave
You gave me a gift of pain
Gift of pain
You gave me a gift of pain

Iâve sat alone for so long
Burning with anger,
Staring through the walls
I will rebuild
A stronger design
Regain my will
And leave you behind
Bitch

[Solos: Skolnick, Holt]

You run away as far as you can
You took the best of me
And left behind a broken man

[SOLO: Skolnick]

You keep on coming back
To drag me down
Iâll keep on fighting
Until they put me in the ground

[SOLO: Holt]

You gave
You gave me a gift
You gave
You gave me a gift of pain

[SOLO: Skolnick]

I'll give
I'll give you a gift
I'll give
I'll give you a gift of pain

Gift of pain
Gift of pain
Gift of pain
