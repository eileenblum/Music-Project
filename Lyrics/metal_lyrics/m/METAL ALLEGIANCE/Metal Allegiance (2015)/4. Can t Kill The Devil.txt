A prison cell is now my home
trapped inside a concrete hole
No more freedom left to roam
Endless time that haunts my soul

Take the struggle day by day
Victimized by endless shame
All that's left is to hope and pray
There's nothing left for you to say

You can't kill the devil
Once evil is alive
You can't kill the devil
'Cause evil never dies

Pushing down, can't rise above
My heart turns to stone, no love
Every lie now takes its toll
Bleed me of my truth and soul

Fight and struggle, search for truth
Through my disconnected youth
Conflicted lies are what you speak
Your serpent tongue still cursing me

You can't kill the devil
Once evil is alive
You can't kill the devil
'Cause evil never dies
You can't kill the devil
Staring me in the eyes
You can't kill the devil
'Cause evil always lies

[Solos: Skolnick, Demmel, Kisser]

Money greed, stories you make
Every dime for a selfish take
Creating myths to hide your tracks
As you stab me in my back

New lies told, old lies dead
Thought of you stuck in my head
As I mourn you laugh at me
You evil bitch just set me free

You can't kill the devil
Once evil is alive
You can't kill the devil
'Cause evil never dies
You can't kill the devil
Staring me in the eyes
You can't kill the devil
'Cause evil always lies

Strength
Determination
Finding freedom in my children's soul
My time has come
My time is now
Justice served on fictitious vows

Kill [5x]
