A symphony of agony
You lay your head to rest
Foam from the mouth
Like a ritual you possess.
Testify against you
Words become deceit
Stuck in here forever
You shall defeat

No way out
No one cares
Another empty soul
Another faceless stare.
Lose the chains that bind you
To free the once condemned
Control your creation
Leaves you all but dead

No way out
No one cares
Another empty soul
Another faceless stare.
Speak against your lover
Slander has begun
Silence all around you
Despising what you've done.
I will rebuke you
Accuse you to your face
No sacrifices
You fall in your disgrace.

[Solo: Skolnick]

Can you hear?
Can you hear?
To hell on this Earth
Let darkness fall
Demystified at birth
Engulf us all.
A symphony of agony
You lay your head to rest
Foam from the mouth
Like a ritual you possess.
No way out
No one cares
Another empty soul
Another faceless stare.
No way out
No one even cares
No way out
No way out.
