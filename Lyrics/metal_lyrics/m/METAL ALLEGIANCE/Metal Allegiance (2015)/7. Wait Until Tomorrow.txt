I feel the heat shine down on me
I feel it burn inside of me
I need your help to show the way
I know I must leave here today

No time to beg or borrow
No time for sorrow
Gonna seize the moment of the day now
Never say that I betray

Been down so long you won't even know
Life at the bottom
Gonna seize the moment of the day now
And never ever walk away

I can't wait, wait until tomorrow
I can't put off what can be done today
I can't stay, stay until tomorrow
I must say all the things I need to say

I feel betrayed and beat again
I know this feeling and the pain

No time to beg or borrow
No time for sorrow
Gonna seize the moment of the day now
Never say that I betray

Been down so long you won't even know
Life at the bottom
Gonna seize the moment of the day now
And never ever walk away

I can't wait, wait until tomorrow
I can't put off what can be done today
I can't stay, stay until tomorrow
I must say all the things I need to say

Losing my direction
Drowning in despair
No one here to save me
I drift to nowhere

Never will surrender
To voices from above
Losing all my senses
I'm all out of love

Selling out my soul
Changing all the rules
Lonely, angry, tired
But still nobody's fool

[Solo: Skolnick]

I can't wait, wait until tomorrow
I can't put off what can be done today
I can't stay, stay until tomorrow
I must say all the things I need to say
