All eyes watching you
See your every move
The good and the bad
And everything you do

Sell another fib
Another bill of goods
Nothing ever changes
And nothing ever should

Nothing ever should

Guilty of humanity
Watching what you do
More than your fair share
Life has given you

You take what isn't yours
'Cause never is enough
Fill the empty void
I call your sinful bluff

Call your sinful bluff

Drowning in your fear

Say your pledge
Nothing you can do
Pledge your allegiance
Hiding is all you

[Solo: Benante]

Believe your deception
Watch the falling reign
Defaming supreme lies
Driving me insane

Crucify your motion
Running from your life
Hiding your false hope
Searching for the knife

Searching for the knife

Pledging your allegiance
Look me in the face
Walking through flooded gates
Show your true disgrace

Flash a tearless smile
Going to great lengths
Covering that broken fear
I keep gaining strength

I keep gaining strength

Drowning in your fear

Say your pledge
Nothing you can do
Pledge your allegiance
Hiding is all you
Say your pledge
Nothing you can see
Pledge your allegiance
Running sets you free

Broken state of mind,
demons all around
No one - left on your own
as you're falling down
Crumbling house of cards,
life is caving in
Praying now to a god,
you will never win

[Solo: Skolnick]

Say your pledge
Nothing you can do
Pledge your allegiance
Hiding is all you

Say your pledge
Nothing you can see
Pledge your allegiance
Running sets you free

[Solo: Holt]

Broken state of your mind
Emptiness all you find
Falling down on your own
No one left, all alone

[Solo: Kisser]

Crumbling house of cards
Life caves in -
twisted shards
Praying now, full of sin
To a god, you'll never win

[Solo: Holt]

Say your pledge:
"Allegiance"
Say your pledge:
"Pledge of Allegiance"

[Solo: Kisser, Holt]

Say your pledge:
"Allegiance"
Say your pledge:
"Pledge of Allegianceâ

[Solo: Holt]

Pledge of Allegiance
