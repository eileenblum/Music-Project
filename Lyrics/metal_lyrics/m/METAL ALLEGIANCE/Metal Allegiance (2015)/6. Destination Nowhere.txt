Trapped in a world of hypocrisy
Follow my own philosophy
Another day and the memories fade
I'll walk for miles just to drift away

Too little fortune
Too many lies
Trying to get over to the other side

So here I travel on the road that leads to nowhere
Familiar places are the ones I'll never know
Life's river passing by, deep and wide, a stitch in time
Forever searching for the one to bring me home

Hopeless, I wander eternally
Under cloak of anonymity
Suspicious faces wherever I go
This is the only life I know

Footsteps approaching
Within my eye
The final moment to say my last goodbye

So here I travel on the road that leads to nowhere
Familiar places are the ones I'll never know
Life's river passing by, deep and wide, a stitch in time
Forever searching for the one to bring me home
Destination nowhere

So here I travel on the road that leads to nowhere
Familiar places are the ones I'll never know
Life's river passes by, deep and wide, a stitch in time
Forever searching for the one to bring me home

So here I travel on the road that leads to nowhere
Familiar faces are the ones I long to know
Life's river passes by, deep and wide, a stitch in time
Forever searching for the one to bring me home
Destination: Nowhere
