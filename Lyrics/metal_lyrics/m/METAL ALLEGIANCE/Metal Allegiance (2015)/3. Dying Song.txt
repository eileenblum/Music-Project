I hear them asking
Will I play the caretaker
to your little grave?
There's no longer reasons
why, you'd be denied
The things that you've
requested bravely
And you'd be treated
with the honor
Due a conquered long-timer
In the midst

Sight...
Is a very precious sense
For those who've endured
the blind
Life...
A different form of life
Has a different form of
death not withstanding

This dying song
This dying song

They say he had no heart
Just (a big) hole in his chest
They got it wrong in part
Trust me, we knew the
blighted test
The test of tests

(It was) Fate...
The ilk have died like flies
And that fever moves with
the swiftness
(Out of) Date...
When the face does leave
the face...
It's death's clutching fingers
upon...

This dying song
This dying song
This dying song
This dying song

History tells us
It's always the same
When fire rages
On that little grave
No longer reasons
To be denied
They got it wrong
A dying song

This dying song
A dying song

[SOLO: Skolnick]

She needs a doctor
Or an undertaker
Believe the mocker
Death-tripped forsaker

Death-tripper
Forsaker
Death-tripper
Forsaker
Death-tripper
Forsaker
Death-tripper
A dying song sadly
mistaken

This dying song
This dying song
