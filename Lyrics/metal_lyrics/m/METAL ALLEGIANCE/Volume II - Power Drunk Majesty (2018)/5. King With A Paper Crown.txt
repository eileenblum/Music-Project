Show me what you've got
I will stand my ground
Win or lose, it matters not
I will not back down

Through scorching flames
Through fields of pain
Baptism of steel
Not a penny to my name
But I will never ever kneel

My hatred is profound
I will make you pay
I'll burn you to the ground
And dance upon your grave

Keep your vicious tongue
All bold words are cheap
Your name will be unsung
As you sow, you'll reap

You think you can't be beat
You think you're better than me
When everything comes around
You're just a king
With a paper crown
A paper crown

Empty cans rattle most
Full of hollow words
Still the loudest voice prevails
The only truth that's heard

My hatred is profound
I will make you pay
I will burn you' to the ground
And dance upon your grave

You think you can't be beat
You think you're better than me
When everything comes around
You're just a king
With a paper crown
You think you know it all
The harder you will fall
When everything comes around
You're just a king
With a paper crown
Paper crown

The fool he thinks he knows it all
But opinions are not facts
All the harder he will fall
When his world begins to crack

[Solo: Nita Strauss]

Empty cans rattle most
A truth as old as dirt
Still the loudest voice prevails
The only truth that's heard

[Solo: Alex Skolnick]

You think you can't be beat
You think you're better than me
When everything comes around
You're just a king
With a paper...
You think you know it all
The harder you will fall
When everything comes around
You're just a king
With a paper crown

My hatred is profound
I will make you pay
Burn you to the ground
And dance upon your grave
