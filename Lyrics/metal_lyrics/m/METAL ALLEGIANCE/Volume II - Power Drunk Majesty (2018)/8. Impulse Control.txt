Blinded by temptations
Consequence unseen
Sensory overload in this machine
Endless stimulation
Images that feed
Promising a cure for every need

A cautionary tale
The remedy you need is not for sale
It's time to let you know

Sickened in my soul
Fell into a hole
Hanging from a pole
Impulse control

[Solo: Alex Skolnick]

Trials and tribulations
Pressure to succeed
Locked within a land of corporate greed
Instant gratification
Never what it seems
Profit motive siphoning your dreams

Philosophy will show
The lesser travelled road is long and slow
It's time to let you know

Sickened in my soul
Fell into a hole
Hanging from a pole
Sickened in my soul
Fell into a hole
Hanging from a pole
Life takes its toll
Impulse control

[Solo: Alex Skolnick]

Reckless provocation
Factual disease
Waging war on rationality
Endless aggravation
Fox that's filled with glee
Echo chamber of conspiracy

It never fails you'll find
The kettle's blackness
Fills the pot that's blind
It's time to let you know

Sickened in my soul
Fell into a hole
Hanging from a pole
Sickened in my soul
Fell into a hole
Hanging from a pole
Life takes its toll
Impulse control

Sickness of the soul
Impulse control
Sickness of the soul
Impulse control
