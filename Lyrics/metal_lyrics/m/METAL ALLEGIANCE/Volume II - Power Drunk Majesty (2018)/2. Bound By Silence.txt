Followed Dad's steps
Uncle Sam gleams
Sleepless desert nights
New York City dreams

Walking 5th Avenue
In combat fatigues
Spit and thrown shit on
By media exposed siege

Moon glares bigger
Hold its power
Life hanging thin
Gazing stars towered

Purpose and vengeance
Strapping on gear
Ready for combat
Embarking with no fear

Silenced by all
Signing the act
War on the world
Bound by silence

Silenced by all
Life in secrecy
Signing the act
Eyes betraying me
War on the world
Bound by silence
Terrorize no more

Dreadful silent nights
Stepped in dead graves
Second squad up
Blood pouring waves

Firing blind in night
Blood on the grass
Branches whipping 'round
Tripping by unseen brass

Dark all around
Blood gleaming through
Bodies laid to waste
Nothing no one could do

Enemy grants terror
Thrown in dirt cover
Flashes and loud cracks
Ambush and recover

Silenced by all
Signing the act
War on the world
Bound by silence

Silenced by all
Life in secrecy
Signing the act
Eyes betraying me
War on the world
Desecrating all
Bound by silence

Drafted by fear
Serving the command
The convoy defeated
Not heroic or grand
Legacy cemented
Survivor remorse
No escaping the memory
Nightmare by force

[Solos: Alex Skolnick]

Seized his worth
Kept in confinement
Fear, hope and truth
Displayed no sorrow
War on the world
Desecrating all
Bound by silence
Bound by silence

Sounds penetrate through
Underground caves come
Stomach cramping up
Triggered by forced thumb

Cold punch of led
Pulverizing veins
Ripping out bones
Leaves you instantly drained

Scream cease fire
Boys laid dead
Blood pooling beneath
Gleaming in dark red

Lips ripped away
Baring broken teeth
Empty eye sockets
Holding sacred keys

Silenced by all
Signing the act
War on the world
Bound by silence

Silenced by all
Life in secrecy
Signing the act
Eyes betraying me
War on the world
Desecrating all
Bound by silence
