Drunk fools can't rule:
As the past dictates
Drunk fools can't lead
So self-absorbed
As the world cries out
Deaf ears can't hear

No!
Power Drunk Majesties
Aren't of this time
No more

Drunk fools tell lies
And the truth gets lost
Drunk fools can't tweet

How?
How can one man still rule the world full of lies?
How?
How can one man still get so far?

Drunk fools ruin worlds
As the past will show
Drunk fools will kill
So vain, the narcissism's blinding you
Blind eyes can't see

How?
How can one man still rule the world full of lies?
How?
How can one man still get so far?

How?
How can one man still rule the world full of lies?
How?
How can one man still get so far?

No!
Power drunk majesties aren't of this time
No more
No!
Power drunk majesties can't rule my world
No more
No more
No

How?
How can one man still rule the world full of lies?
How?
How can one man still get so far?

How?
How can one man still rule the world full of lies?
How?
How can one man still get so far?
