The haunted mind,
In control of the move
The mask fronted thought
And diluted truth

Evil embrace,
A tear in my eye
Obey not the hate,
Love me to die

Love me to die

Vacant repeal,
Locked away in your safe
Shadow the night,
Sealing their fate

Indulging wrath,
Self-inflicted plague
A methodic structure,
Pinned on your gauge

Will this obsession,
Fill you with rage?
Entitle your ego and dance
In your cage

A forgone delusion
That tore you apart
A spawned conclusion,
Bleeds out the heart

Mother of sin
Stand up to oppression
The repression begins
Stand up to the lie

Mother of sin
Suffering the pain
Feeding from within
Time to die

Mother of sin
Lying in the wake
Praying evil wins

Innocent
Frame of mind
Contradicted thought

Double-thinking
Confutation
Regret what you thought

C'mon Mrs. Wonderful
You're tearing them apart

I've given all that
I could give
I'm bleeding
Through the heart

Suffocation
Breath for life
Is all we ever need

Transformation
Cuts like a knife
The open wounds still bleed, bleed, bleed

Mother of sin
Stand up to oppression
The repression begins
Stand up to the lie

Mother of sin
Suffering the pain
Feeding from within
Time to die

Mother of sin
Lying in the wake
Praying evil wins

The aftermath
Is reigning down
The soaked
Consumed by hate
A mind filled
With sadistic thoughts
The clock strikes
All too late

Lie is thick
Fined in time
Beauty is sick
Fueled by crime

God among us
Is there hope?
Find my reverie
Hang by my rope

Hang by my rope

[Solo: Alex Skolnick]

Hang by my rope
Hang by my rope
Hang by my rope
Hang by my...

Angel's smile,
False look and glare
Turning one over
Set on dark stares

[Solos: Andreas Kisser]

Cynical thoughts,
Acting out pain
Suppressing demands
Scripted in vain

Payment come due,
Laugh in fear
The truth
Become the law

Every lie told,
Noose right here
Absent, the final straw

Mother of sin

Mother of sin

Mother of sin
Stand up to oppression
The repression begins
Stand up to the lie

Mother of sin
Suffering the pain
Feeding from within
Time to die

Mother of sin
Lying in the wake
Praying evil wins

Soulless
Mother
Of
Sin
