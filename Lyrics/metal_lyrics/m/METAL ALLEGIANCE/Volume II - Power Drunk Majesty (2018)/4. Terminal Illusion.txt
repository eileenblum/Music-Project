All your time consumed by lies
Telling yourself day by day
Smile as they stare at your clothing and hair
Complete adoration you crave

A schmoozer, a user, a constant abuser
Broken hearts lie in your wake
A schemer, deceiver, an overachiever
Nothing's real and you're a fake

You're an image in a mirror
Just a reflection on a screen
You're just a stiff, no love to give
You make me wanna scream

Loving yourself, surrounded by wealth
A bottomless pit of conceit
Life on the surface - no depth - no purpose
Your whole world is merely skin deep

A teaser, a cheater - slick bottom feeder
Ice water flows in your veins
No shame, no honor, a stone prima donna
No, I won't be one of your games

You're an image in a mirror
Just a reflection on a screen
You're just a stiff with no love to give

You're a terminal illusion
A black shadow on a dream
You're just a stiff with no love to give
You make me wanna scream

Self-loving
Self-absorbed
Arrogance over your world

Self-obsessed
Self-centered
Terror filling your void

Antisocial
Narcissistic
Your life's a bullshit parade

Detesting
Everyone
Threats of deception and slander
It's all a charade

[Solos: Alex Skolnick]

You're an image in a mirror
Just a reflection on a screen

You're a terminal illusion
A black shadow on a dream
You're just a stiff, no love to give
You make me wanna scream
