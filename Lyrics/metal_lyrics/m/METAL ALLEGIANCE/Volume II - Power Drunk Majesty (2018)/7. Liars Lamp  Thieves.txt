Liars, thieves
Stole from me

Structured fortress
Grazed the sky
Abandoned sidewalks
Hear their cry
Cracked out corners
Smack on the street
A city fallen
Nation's defeat

Global finance,
Standing tall
Corrupting lives, destroying all
Corporate greed,
The American way
Say goodbye to the U.S. of A.

Towering... once tall
Crumbling... rise and fall
Governing... behind a wall
Watch 'em tumble, watch 'em fall

Liars, thieves
On your knees
Liars, thieves
Full of greed
Liars, thieves
Stole from me
How much more
Can they need?

Streets of sadness
Once were gold
Tales of glory
Tales of old

Business thriving
Skyline is high
Now the cities
Left to die

Laziness,
Broke our dreams
Wall Street
Ripped out-the seams
Push came,
Then the shove
Dollar bill
Is now their love

Cowering... manic haul
Vanishing... jobs and all
Conquering... as they brawl
Watch 'em tumble,
Watch 'em fall

Liars, thieves
On your knees
Liars, thieves
Full of greed
Liars, thieves
Stole from me
How much more
Can they need?

Liars, thieves
On your knees
Liars, thieves
Make me bleed
Liars, thieves
Stole from me
How much more
Can they need?

City riots
State dreams
Thousands dead
Nation gleams

Endless debt
Intervene
Double-dealing
Nation beam

Hiding fraud
The house deems
Millions gone
The nation team

Exploitation
Profiteering
Defamation
The regime

[Solo: Alex Skolnick]

Right and left
Capital thoughts
Pissing on the middle
Who they fought

Stealing dreams
Underground
Wolves on the street
Don't get beat

CEO
Laugh in glass
Corporations
Kick us in the ass

Recession, collapsing
Depression, allure
Left in a void
Without a cure

[Solo: Alex Skolnick]

Land of the free
Home of the brave
Our country morale
Is in the grave

Betrayal and greed
Endless decay
The rich are intact
The flag astray

Money in hand
Lost in the crack
The little guy out
Big guy will tax

Detroit, Chicago
New York, L.A.
Great cities falling
In decay

Liars, thieves
On your knees
Liars, thieves
Full of greed
Liars, thieves
Stole from me
How much more
Can they need?

Liars, thieves
On your knees
Liars, thieves
Make me bleed
Liars, thieves
Stole from me
How much more
Can they need?
