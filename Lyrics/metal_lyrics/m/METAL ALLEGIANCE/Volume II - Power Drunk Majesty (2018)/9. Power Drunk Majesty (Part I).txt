The American dream is dead

Twisting
Nothing is true
Mockery
Bowing to you
Dominance
Suffer your rule
Arrogance
We the people you fool

Abuse of power's all you do
Puppets playing just for you
Tyrants come to take your hand
Flaunting wealth and stealing land

One nation under god
Blinded by travesty
One nation under doubt
Power Drunk Majesty

Exposing
You lost control
Constructing
Empty soul
Misery
Turning the screw
Liberty
Freedom not true

Raping justice like a whore
Pandering your flocks adore
Nepotism like a king
As they come and kiss your ring

One nation under god
Blinded by travesty
One nation under doubt
Power Drunk Majesty

"...But in all of my years of public life, I have never profited - never profited from public service. I've earned every cent. And in all of my years of public life, I have never obstructed justice"

Adams, Franklin, Hamilton, Jay
Jefferson, Madison roll in decay

Washington could never foresee
Power Drunk Majesty
