Accuser here among us
An object to defy
Your only goal, destroy my soul
You hope that I shall die

Alive in our defiance
Yet dead within our sins
Respective wrath, our chosen path
Your perishing begins

Your perishing begins

Their innocence surrounds us
Sick pleasure's what you find
As thoughts untrue, devised by you
Contaminate their minds

Now you plead for mercy
You beg for hope and faith
Forever more at heaven's door
You're sworn unto this fate

The Accuser lives on
Slandering with lies
The Accuser lives on
Watching your demise

[Solo: Alex Skolnick]

Violate - Your tongue becomes deceit
Cast away - No promise that you keep
Annihilate - Addiction holds your fate
Life in pain - You lie your sins away

Time to weep, time to laugh
Time to mourn and do a dance
Covered lies, buried filth
Hand of God it will not last

Gone is mercy, gone is grace
Dead in sin, living disgrace
Covered lies buried filth
Accuser sins, the Demon wins

[Solo: Andreas Kisser]

The Accuser lives on
Slandering with lies
The Accuser lives on
This dreadful union dies

Your worth begins to crumble
And boasting makes it worse
Your only hope, destroy my scope
Your life's a forgone curse

Time to weep, time to laugh
Time to mourn and do a dance
Covered lies, buried filth
Hand of God it will not last

Gone is mercy, gone is grace
Dead in sin, living disgrace
Covered lies buried filth
Accuser sins, the Demon wins
