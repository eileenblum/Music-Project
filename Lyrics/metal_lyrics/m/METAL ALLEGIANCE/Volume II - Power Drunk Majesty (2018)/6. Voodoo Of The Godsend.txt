Behold the cross of the Lord
Be scattered ye hostile powers
The Lion of the tribe of Judah
The root of David has conquered
Glorious Archangel against unclean spirits
The injury of the human race
And the ruins of souls
Amen

From nothing
We make something
Obliterate dissection
Resurrection
Spiritual connection
Revolution in the air
The darkness despair

Spectral haze
Human face
Voodoo of the Godsend

Death is the beginning
Don't know if I am dreaming
Visions of serial killing
They feed on your fear
Like fire he appears
The sacred ritual is here
No one gets out alive
I am the bleeding heart
The storm in your eyes
For your sins you're crucified
I'm blessed by the sky
Touch by the night
Fire-baptized

Astral plane
Going insane
Voodoo of the Godsend

I'm hearing voices
Eternal voices
Return to the void
Embraced by the god
