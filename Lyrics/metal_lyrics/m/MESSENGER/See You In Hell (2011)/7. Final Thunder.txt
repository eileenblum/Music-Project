Generations passed away,
Forgotten ways of dignity
Lightyears far away from home
Far from reason did they roam

Ways of fortune torn apart
Reign of terror everywhere
Wasted worlds are left behind
The final dawn now for mankind

Fire in the sky, laserguns are blazing high
Loud as the final thunder, plasma eats the sky
Fire in the sky, burning clouds and fiery rain
Motherships came down to earth
Our strike-back in vain.

Scattered bodies, burning earth
Our Sanctuary the only hope
Future's ark was made of ice
Destiny will throw the dice...

The suffering earth came down with those
Who came from outer space
But time will be on our side
To save the human race
The walls of ice keep them away
As long as we try to live
Infection of our planet grows
But she still has to give.
