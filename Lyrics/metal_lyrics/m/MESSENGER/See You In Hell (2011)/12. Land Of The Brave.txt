So sad they stand at the shoreline
To weave a last goodbye
Soon he will enter the halls of immortals
On his own ship he'll sail with the flame
Aah - he will sail with the flame
Aah - he will live again

We're not afraid
Of what we have done
We're not afraid to die
Now hear our last battlecry
I hope we will meet in the sky
I will rise to the sky
At the day I die
Enter the mighty
Halls on high
Where we will meet
All again

Land of the Brave
As strong as the winds blow
Stand forever with Sword and Shield
Those who will proudly stand by Odin's side
We're the sons of Victory

Now he's holding his sword
In his dead hands
As he stares at the clouds
We will remember his name
He who lived in glory and fame

He will enter the Halls of Valhalla
On his own ship he'll sail with the flame
Spnn he will meet all his ancestors
In the Halls of Valhalla
Where the brave will leave forever...

There he will see the land of immortals
Hall of the Kings and the forefather's realm
Livin' forever by Odin's side
Livin' in Glory and Pride...
