Black the Ravens, far horizon
Men in armour are standing tight
Cloaked in silence, whispering morning
To the shores they are out for a fight

Ooooh

Darkest creatures from the oceans
They call us when they're filled with fear
When the bell tolls for one last time
They know that the end is near

Ooooh

Northern sons with a burning heart
Set the shores in flames
Ooooh
Through the veil of the weeping mist
Cuts the sound of the creatures from hell

Northern sons with a fiery heart
Set the shores in flames
Ooooh
Hungry throats calling Odins name
Prowling for honor and fame.

Monks have been slaughtered forsaken by their god
The blades of our swords satined in red
The chapel is burned and the riches are plundered
For this time our Dragon is fed.
