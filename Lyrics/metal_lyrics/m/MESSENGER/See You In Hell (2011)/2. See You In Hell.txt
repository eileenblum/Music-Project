The curtain's falling
An unholy calling
Another break
in the mirror of life
Another shame
to the tongue of the liar
But I will tear it out

The gates of Hell
are waiting for you
I'll meet you there
we're both passing through

Fly through the firestorm
Facing its flight
Ride through the battlefield
It's no good to hide
I will find you
Catching your soul
And casting my spell:
See you in Hell!!

The curtain's falling
An unholy calling
Another try, but I'm slyer
Revenge is burning
Your life into ashes
I swear, I will find you soon

To find the ones who have betrayed
To spill their blood - judgement by blade
