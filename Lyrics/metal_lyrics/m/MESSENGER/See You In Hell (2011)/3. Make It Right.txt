Another concert in your burning town
Another scream in the night
Another thunder is rolling from hell
Another lightning will strike!

YeahYeah, dressed for a kill
she is burning like hell
YeahYeah, black shining leather,
she's doing so well

Make it right - Our show has just begun
Make it right - So much deeds are left undone
Make it right - Let things slide and never care
Make it right - Like the guys of MessengeR

Anotner lady in black on her stride
Another blonde shining light
We'll invite her after the show
She follows wherever we go

So hide your girlfriend

'Cause we're not as lame as you guy
She stands in front of the crowd
Try to hug her, she'll cast you away

[SOLO]

All the slander you heard about us
Are more true than you know!
Another guy is searching his girl
And you can guess where she is!
