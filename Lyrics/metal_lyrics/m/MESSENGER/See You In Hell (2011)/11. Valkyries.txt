Mist of battle, rays of light
Shine on my last breath
Through the dark clouds
Shimmerring bright
High the valkyries fly

Out of the sky
With a battlecry
Valkyries carry me home

Rise up on high, leave the fire behind
feel the hands that keep holding me tight
Lost in this dream, but I don't sleep at all
She takes me to Odin's great hall

Out of the sky
With a battlecry
Valkyries carry me home
Out of the sky
With blazing steel
The Valkyries carry me home

There I will meet again
All those who were slain
In these halls our long journey ends
See the castle of light
Build by Allfather's might,
Where I'll drink and Iâll
Fight with my friends
