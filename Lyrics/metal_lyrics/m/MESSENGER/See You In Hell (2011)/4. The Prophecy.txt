The settlers tried to build up
New paradise in space
A Ketogenic Killzone
To veil every trace
They've died in terrible horror
By evil greed for might
She's sworn to take revenge
With all of her spite

She's a wolf with deadly pride
The galaxy is no-place to hide
Fly to burning skies
The Prophecy has come to rise.
She's a wolf with deadly pride
A mistress on her fatal stride
Fly to burning skies
The Prophecy has come to rise.

He made himself king.
Possessed by his greed
For the source of immortal
Power and strength
But she is the one
Who walked through the water
She is the one
Who is out for revenge...
