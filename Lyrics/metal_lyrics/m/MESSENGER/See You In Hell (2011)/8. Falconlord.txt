Firestorm and Flashing lights
And legions of brave
The war goes on in endless fights
The Falcon will fly

A star was born to lead us all
The path of steel - our destiny
Never we'll change the way we are
What we want is our holy war.

Like a Falcon
I'm the lord of the burning fields of war
Roaring thunder on my wings
Falconlord, raise to the sky!

Proud the banners with our name
Like the ocean's waves
Tell about our victory,
Axes, shield and spear

[Solo 1: Deckes]
[Solo 2+3: Kette]

There's the source of origin
The elders told me before
Where all the space
And time begins
Through this ancient door
I drink the water, I can feel it
flowing through my veins
All its wisdom calls my name
To be a part of mine...

I Drink Blood on my Rage
Our swords rule the Night
I'm the one they'll know to Fear
Fear my darkest might
Behind the banners
The evil's eye
Hordes of Darkness rise
Wings of Death
Fly overhead
A raing firestorm

Our powerthrone
In the eye of the storm
I'm the falconlord
In the eye of the storm

Like a Falcon...
