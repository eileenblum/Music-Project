Impaled by their black eyes
Without any motion
Cutting through flesh
It seems to be dead

There are no answers
There is just fear
We know that the others
Soon will be near

Lifeforms - the truth has failed
Our existence has no tomorrow

They have reached the highest level
We cannot understand
But there's a mirror behind the mask
Humanity will end

10000 years through the galaxy
Many generations far away
Deprived of civilisation
Of reason and science
Just newborn religion
And madness are left

As long as they were vermon
They could not leave their own home
But we have just ignored
That achievments are like fleeting foam

And so we have to think of
The future of our own race
We see the ships arriving
And look into our own face now

This is what I saw
Behind your dark eyes
The mask has fallen for now
This is what I knew
All the years before
Your mask has fallen for now
