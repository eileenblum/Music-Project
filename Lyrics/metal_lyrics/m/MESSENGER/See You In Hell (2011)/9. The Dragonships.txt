We sail across the oceans
With our dragonships
Our weapons point at you
And for now there's no choice...

Oooo...

So join the tribe of glory
And be a part of us
This time we keep the flag
And we'll sing with one voice:

Sail our Ship, brothers in battle
With the wind, quest for glory waits
See the sign - fearless we fight
And the Dragonships may return!

The days of high adventure
Will shine in our mind
There are no laws
For the strong and the brave

Sail our Ship, brothers in battle
With the wind, quest for glory waits
See the sign - fearless we fight
And the Dragonships may return...

Hammers high, brothers in battle
With the wind, voice of victory
See the sign, reckless we ride
And the Dragonships will return...
