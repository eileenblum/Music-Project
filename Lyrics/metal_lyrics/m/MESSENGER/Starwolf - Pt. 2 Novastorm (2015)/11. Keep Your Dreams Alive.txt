When the whole world is against you
And you're under control
These words may be the answer
To strengthen up your soul
It seems that there's no way out
Remember what we've said
Listen this tune of hope
And make it spread

Committing titanic suicide
Asylum of our XTC
Infected with the sound of pride
Victorious we'll be

You have to keep your dreams alive
Whatever people may say
You have to keep your dreams alive
This is the only way

Your fingers touch the picture
Faces shining bright
The message - our mission
Born to rule the night
We won't make laws for you
Join us on our stride
Creating our new world
Fighting side by side

Under the sign of steel reborn
We shout: see you in hell
With Starwolf through the Novastorm
Hear our mighty yell
