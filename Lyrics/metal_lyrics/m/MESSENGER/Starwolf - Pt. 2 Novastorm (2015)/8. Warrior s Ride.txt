It's a tale of a warrior
He was born to fight
His shining armour in the rising sun
The steel at his side
He was the alien visitor
The prophecy has told
Keeper of wisdom and freedom for all
Behold, the chosen one!

Now I will sing
The prophecy of ancient times
About the fight for the truth

His steed was as fast
As the northern wind
Raging over the land
The mighty chain of light and fire
In his glorious hand

His shining eyes have read the scrolls
Of the mighty forefather's spell
When he rides out of the mist
You can hear his mighty yell

Now I will sing
The prophecy of ancient times
About the fight for the truth
Now I will sing
The glorious deeds of the one
Who fights the evil
Warrior's ride

Warrior - ride on
Since 10.000 years we were waiting for you

Now enter the halls of glory
(The secrets of wisdom
The holy enigma
The secrets of wisdom
The answer lies beyond the stars)

He'll fight for the glory of our wisdom
Not only for Pridas but the whole galaxy
He gave us the promise to save our kingdom
His name will be a legend for evermore

With the power of his mighty chains
On his chariot he will rise
Sweep the shadows from the stars
Fight the evil - warrior's ride
