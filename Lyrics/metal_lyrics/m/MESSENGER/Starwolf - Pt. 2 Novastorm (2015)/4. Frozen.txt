Silent fall in my dreams
Visions call - do I believe
As I walk forward the misty path
The sky is falling over me

As I'm passing through the flame
I am falling into a sea of light
Where the dark sun glows
Win the light from the other side
Either surmise or feel
This world is not unreal

Frozen, frozen - the sky and the light
Another world is calling me
To save humanity
Frozen, frozen - the sky and the light
Guardian of the culture's heir
For freedom's glare

I can see a statue standing still
Pointing to the distant hill
The town is shining in the night
Like an ivory star
I know they wait for me
And the gates are open wide

The elder ones unveiled the words
That were carved in stone
They knew that I'm the chosen one
To save the dying sun
Their world has died before
It's the legacy of lore
