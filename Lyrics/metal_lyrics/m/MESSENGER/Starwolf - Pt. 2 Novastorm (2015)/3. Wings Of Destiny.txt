Giant sphere, force of might
Equal to our sun
It is one of a kind

Lightnings shiver in blue light
Information will come
From the black hole they will find

Wings of destiny will fly
From the event-horizon
Lightyears far away
But reaching our hearts
Wings of destiny will fly
A new hope is rising
Through the fire and storm

Soon the sphere will collide
Turned into a Novastorm
May it makes our hearts reborn
