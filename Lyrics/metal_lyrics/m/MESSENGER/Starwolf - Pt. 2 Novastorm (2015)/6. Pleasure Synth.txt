Black and beautiful like a stone
Of obsidian it shines
In my laboratory, waiting for me
She never knew that she would
Feel such a desire

And my dream was coming true
To change the view

Loaded with the energy of lust
It's the instrument that must
Be the orchestra of joy and delight
Our revolution's coming by
My synth that amplifies
The resistance and our fight

Mediocrity and stupid words
Have been the purpose in her life
Although expensive education was paid
This may be the force
That will feed my synth with power
