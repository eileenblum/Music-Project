Deep in the cloak of the asteroid field
A planet of water, its secrets revealed
Our freedom was dying
They have called my name
I will defend it by the great holy flame

They gave me the strength
To keep on the fight
Reborn through the mysteries
Of blue shining light
They have the knowledge
And I have the sword
Bringer of justice of firestorm

Follow the ancient course
We are sailing the sword of the stars
We're the mighty force
Bringer of firestorm

Spreading the message
The mission is clear
Prowling the stars
The ghost brings them fear
My judgement is fire, my fire is hate
The new world is trembling
Revenge is their fate
My holy revenge
