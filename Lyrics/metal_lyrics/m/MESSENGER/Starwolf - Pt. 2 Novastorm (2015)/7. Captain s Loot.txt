A secret treasure of Morgan's stride
Many speculations were done
The ancient ones have revealed the truth
About the death of the sun
The cube was telling about a race
Far beyond of all we know
There is no contact and there's no trace
In the shadows of space

Rising force of ancient wisdom
Source of truth
In the planet made of water
The secrets of the captain's loot
Hail Tarkassidia
Rising force of ancient wisdom
Source of truth
In the planet made of water
The destination of our quest
Hail Tarkassidia

The Tarkassidian race has tried
A million years before our time
To use the whole sun's power and might
In a giant sphere
But it was destroyed by the alien race
Like many others in our galaxy
In order to keep us all in our place
To steal our sun-energy

Now the freedom will fly
And they will pay
They won't control anymore
We'll cut the puppet's strings
The menace will die
They will burn in a storm
The inquisition no more
The slugs will be gone
The might of the order falls down
Hail to our captain's loot
To our friends
Together we'll fight 'till the end
