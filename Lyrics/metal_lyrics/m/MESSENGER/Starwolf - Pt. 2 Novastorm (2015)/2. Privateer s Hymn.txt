Strike with power boarding the vessels
Live our lives in piracy
We are standing strong and united
Until the final storm

See the ship that is shining bright
We're the hunter and they're the prey
Treasures found in the Silverlight
Now they have to pay

Strike with power boarding the vessels
Live our lives in piracy
We are standing strong and united
Until the final storm

Dogmatic views have replaced the truth
Decadence in society
Destroyed the power of eternal youth
Drove us into piracy

[Chorus]

Like the purifying fire
Flame of humanity
The answer lies in the Novastorm
Sign of victory
