Far away, at the border
At this run-down station
No police nor ethic order
Of the federation
You'll find it easy when it's late
The inn for crooks and pirates
A sheep with eyepatch on the plate
Sound of freedom's spirit

Now join the choir
Of the pirate's song!

A place with salves and pleasures
"Wild Dolly" is its name
Where flesh and smoke are treasures
Hidden and dark
In the silence of the stars

Forbidden meat, unhealthy beer
Served by precious clone-slaves
Hedonism without fear
Written on our graves

A place with salves and pleasures
"Wild Dolly" is its name
Where flesh and smoke are treasures
Hidden and dark
In the silence of the stars
Where ale will pour like rivers
It's a dirty drinking hole
A spark of hope that shivers
Hidden and dark in the silence of the stars
