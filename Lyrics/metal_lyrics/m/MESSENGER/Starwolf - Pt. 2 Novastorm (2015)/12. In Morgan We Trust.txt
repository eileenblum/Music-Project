Our rebel hearts they will never tame
Because we're out of control
Better die than live in the shame
That they have taken our souls

We walk through fire and storm
We're proud and never conform
In our power and Morgan we trust
This truth will forever last
In our power and Morgan, Morgan we trust

Your decision awaits, it's never too late
And we are proud of our scars
We share the pain, the life and the fate
With the wolf of the stars

Merciless, in fury
Rage is burning high
Vision of the old life
The pirates will defy

When death awaits our life has begun
Between shadows and light
Battles and fights we have won
For our right!
