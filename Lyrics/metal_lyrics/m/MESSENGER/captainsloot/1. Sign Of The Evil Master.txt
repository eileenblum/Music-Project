Look, the unholy knight
his darkest might will come to power
His mace makes them fall
His creatures will crawl
There's no, no hope at all

Black rain at the final battle
Black rain in the face of the damned
Black rain and the fire will burn
On the fields of the damned

Of the damned

The souls of modern slime
Has tried to change
The hearts of the brave
The warlord will come
To sweep all this scum
We will see you in hell!

Black rain in the darkest hour
Black rain from the eyes of the damned
Black rain and the ravaging storm
On the fields of the damned

Ooohh, we are the messengers

Sign of the Evil Master - Come to the battlefield
Sign of the Evil Master - Our destiny is revealed
Sign of the Evil Master - Breaking down their shields
Sign of the Evil Master - The fate of the damned is sealed

Of the damned...

The way through space and time
The firegate is open for now
The lightnings will guide
The bringer of light
We follow the unholy knight

Black rain at the final battle
Black rain, unbelievers will fall
Black rain and blood will pour
From the wounds of the damned

Sign of the Evil Master.

[Solo: Rolf Munkes]

These are the times
Dreams will be sold
It turns into grey
Blinded by gold

[Solo: Rolf Munkes]

They try to make us slaves
To ravish our souls
But we're prepared to face their might
The warlord be our guide

Oooh, oooh, the earth drinks blood this day
oooh, the earth turns into red

[Solo: Kette]

Sign of the Evil Master....
