There's a dark plane,
secret treasure.
Answers to the crime.
Break the silence,
Discover secrets.
New Hope will shine!

We hear the sirens screamin'
On the military base
Red lights like deepest blood -
War is now declared

MessengeR - of a new hope
Hear the call!
MessengeR - of a new hope
We will rule them all!!!!

There's a hangar
In the desert
Where we do research.
We have to learn
For they shall burn
In the flames of their fire.

MessengeR - of a new hope
MessengeR rise!
MessengeR - of a new hope
MessengeR rise!

We've discovered their technology,
The system will work for us
Like shining arrows in the dark,
A hopeful spark!!
