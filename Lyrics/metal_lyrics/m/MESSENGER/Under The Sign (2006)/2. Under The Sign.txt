Storm and Chaos.
The End seems to be near,
The unbelievers
Are overwhelmed by fear
The Hammer of Power,
Axe and the Sword -
Saviour of Metal -
He's the Mighty Lord!

This is the Firegate
Where they will burn in Hate.
Burn in Hate

Under the Sign
Of the Mighty Messenger
Vengeance be thine
Ooo - o - oh!

They will burn in the Fire
They will die in Pain

Painful they're crying
Afraid of dying
No one of them will survive
At this final hour,
His hammer of Power
Brings judgement, Vengeance
And Pain

Ooooh....
