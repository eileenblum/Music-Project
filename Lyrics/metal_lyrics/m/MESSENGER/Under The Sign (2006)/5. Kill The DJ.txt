In the temple of jerks
You are the priest
In the hall of the fools
You're playing your game:
Turning the wheels of stupidity
By the curse of your hands.

Keep them stupid, make them deaf
The crows is happy, the rulers will laugh
Switch off their mind, people are blind
Now it's the time to end this crime

You are the whore of commerce and sin
We hate your world - the people within
Brainwashed stupid - use your mind!
Where do you go?

Music will die and money will grow
Pieces of cake? - Be part of the show!
Not with us!!! Let us stand!!!
Fight for Metal with steel in our hand.

Kill, Kill, Kill the D.J.
Heavy Metal is the Law

We like beer, no pops and no drugs
We like it hard, 'cause other life sucks!
We're made of steel, not plastic and shit
Proud of our life we never will fit

Forget the losers and go with the brave
While the other men will fall in the grave
The time has come to release the Power
Of Metal and Steel!!!!
