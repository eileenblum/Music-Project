Far, in our dreams
We have seen the visions of free life
One of our clan
Will stand against the Psychlos

When the Titans fall
There's a new realm on the sky.
When the giants fall
Mankind will rise.

Slaves to their masters,
They tread us like animals.
Our destiny calls us.
To raise our fist.

One of us has earned the strength,
A gift of the rulers
To raise his mind.
To free the will
Of Mankind.
