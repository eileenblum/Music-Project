The night stared with black eyes
I felt something crawling
Voices from nowhere
We're calling me.
Our flashlights we're trembling
But we could not see
Crying in fear as we tried to flee.

What is't the secret
Behind this masquerade?
Enslaved by the visions of night
I am afraid.

Down the stairs
I've walked that night
Behind the chimney
A shape of light,
It's deep black Eyes
We're staring at me....

Will you control me?
Can I believe in you?
The creatures that I see,
Where do they belong?

I follow your calling,
You're showed me the mirror
Inside myself
I'm falling
Into the truth...
