I can hear the silence
Call my name:
I'm the son of the sky
Born again.
I have killed the voices
From behind,
Force that sickens all
Of our kind.

The Truth is my vision
(Visions of the holy truth)
I'm the son of the sky.

Pharaoh -
King of a new age
Pharaoh -
Lord of the sun
Pharaoh -
King of a new age,
Reaching for the power to live.

Those who will believe
In my name,
They'll be born again
Under my fame
In a sea of blood
Priests will die
I will turn this land
Into live.

I'm the One who is shining
As bright as the sun

I can feel a new age is rising,
It will change our land
I'm the sun in the sky
I'm the god of the light!
