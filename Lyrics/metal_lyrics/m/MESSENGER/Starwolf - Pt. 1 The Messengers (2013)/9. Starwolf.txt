He was a leading hero in the war
When he lost his arms and legs
Half of his face was destroyed
The heart and lungs won't
Work again.

He has faced the minister of war
Who refused the cloning-back.
Revenge of a cyborg's heart
Was cold as steel
And he broke his neck.

Then, our hero was born

Ooooh - Starwolf is his name
Ooooh - Starwolf is his name

Sworn forever to the free men's live
To regain our dignity
He has promised a life in ecstasy
And flesh for free

The grail of hatred and scorn

Ooooh - Starwolf is his name
Ooooh - Starwolf is his name

A scientist was the guide
Who gave him back his pride
An old friend from the infantry
With engineers abilities
Both are wanted guys
Traced by the law for the highest prize

Ooooh [4x]

A god of unarmed fight
Is standing by his side
An adept of ancient history
Finding out the mystery
And the poet speaks for all,
The wicked voice of a madman
The messenger

The red star ist glowing
To hunt them in their dreams
The sleep of unknowing,
His dark wrath redeems
They don't know why
But death will come straight
Soon they will die
In his firestorm of hate

Ooooh - Starwolf is his name
Ooooh - Starwolf is his name

Breaking the rules of the federation
He ist the wolf of the stars
He brings an end to our desperation
Starwolf is his name.
