A spectre ist haunting the galaxy
The spectre of Morgan's revenge
Like black wind of fortune
His message is spread
As pirates we'll stand
We'll fight 'til the end

Like the wolves
We are born to be free
Baring our teeth
On a killing spree
Born to fight
To die for our freedom
We'll defy
The laws of the federation

Murder and piracy
We are falling
For science and humanity
We are calling
Hearts filled with heresy
And the blood from a wolf's jaw
Murder and piracy
We are falling
For science and humanity
We are calling
Hearts filled with heresy
It's the way of the outlaws

Five spectres are haunting the galaxy
Pirates of space
Without any trace
Hunting the treasures of wisdom and fame
Loyal and proud and never to tame

Persecuted by the law
We're bad forevermore
But the message of freedom
Is our war
