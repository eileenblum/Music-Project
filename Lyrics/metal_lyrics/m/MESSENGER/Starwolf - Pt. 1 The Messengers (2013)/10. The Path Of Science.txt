Behold, the world below
A universe of particles
Now glance at the stars
Their life is a flow

Deep in our blood
We found the crown of technology
Key to wealth
Just with the limit of our fantasy

Why should we use
Bionics and robots
And surgery-youth?
If we could create
With the power of gods
Our glorious fate.

Oooh....

Ooh â and there is no escape
From the path of science
Ooh â there is dignity
When hope and truth unite
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Join the path of science
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Where hope and truth unite
