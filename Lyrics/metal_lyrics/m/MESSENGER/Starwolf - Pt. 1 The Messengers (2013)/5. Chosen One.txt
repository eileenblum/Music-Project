Ancient realm of science and freedom
No one ever knew before
They studied the truth
For wisdom and youth.
The dying sun had left her children
She won't shine not anymore
Red giant rise
To their demise

On the prawl for slaves and knowledge
The exvacation was disturbed
Our search was in vein
Destruction and pain.
Death was not the end of their life
The whispering cube was calling me
Words that will guide
To the other side

It's the call of my destiny
I'm the chosen one

I am the chosen one
On the wings of victory
I am the chosen one
Sworn to break free
Forefathers wisdom
And souls to my command
I am the chosen one 
Called by destiny

When I go to their dimension
They welcome me with gratitude
With chains in my hand
Protecting their land
I'm the one to face the trial
To save their lives for evermore
They'll give me the price
Our new wold will rise
