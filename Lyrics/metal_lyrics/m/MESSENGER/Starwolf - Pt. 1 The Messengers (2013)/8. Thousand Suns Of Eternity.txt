I've picked the rose which I once kissed
Taste the life you will miss
Fall, fall, fly with me
On your wings to the stars
Fall, fall, die with me
In the fire of my sun

I hate your smile
Since the day I was born
The lies are the shell of your live
But glamour and glory
Will die in the dawn
When our revolution arrives

Black the vision of ecstasy
It's the call of my bane
Like thousand suns of eternity
Die in torture and pain
Black the vision of ecstasy
You are under my spell
With thousand suns of eternity
You will burn in my hell.

Sacrifice for your temple
Only by winners
These are the rules of your game
Selfish existence
Fed by the useless
Blinded by riches and fame
