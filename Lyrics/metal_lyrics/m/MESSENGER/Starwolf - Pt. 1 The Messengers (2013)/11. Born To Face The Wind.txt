Silent floating through the stars
To gain the secrets
Boarding every ship 
On our deadly trip
Privateers we'll be
Fight and never flee
Reckless courage of our brothers
sons of victory

Born to face the wind
We're masters of the storm
Glory to this life of piracy
Born to face the wind
We're masters of the storm
Under Morgan's flag
We are masters of the storm

In the shadows of the space
Our ships are waiting
Filled with hate and spite
Against the federations's might
Worker-slaves on the run
Now we stand as one
As fast we came we will be gone
In the Tarkassidian sun

Here we stand at the dawn of a new age
Sworn to reach for the highest goals
Judged and traced by the Inquisition
But it's futile to save our souls
