A shadow in the sunlight
The phantom will appear
Before they do their last fight
They wait in fear.
Killed and burnt by deadly fire
The red haired maniac cries
His laughter makes them tremble
Before they die

Raiders of galaxy - looting for ecstasy
Raiders of galaxy - revenge for their scars
Raiders of galaxy - guardians of history
Raiders of galaxy - sons of the stars

Plundering for kryo-clone slaves
And embryonic cells
Ancient books - the highest crave
Where wisdom dwells
Evil Doctor takes the organs
Of the defeated guys
Today they had bad fortune
They'll pay the price.

And the voice of the wicked man
Will frighten them
Black ist his heart 
Like a raven
