Behold the symbols of freedom
This life was our decision
Away from planets and countries we're striding
Scientists and clones, hedonists to the bone
We are the refugees
Holy waters of Tarkassidia
She will wait for me
When I'm coming home
To see

Damned by the law
Awaiting the pyre
Raiders we'll be
For eternity
Live by the oath
To punish the liar
Bound by the pledge
To Humanity

Pirates of space!
Pirates of space!

In the asteroid belt of the Tarkassidian sun
We wait for the dawn
Of the new age
Hear the MessengeRs
The cluster's gates are wide
New Port Royal's light
Defending the anchor of thruth
With our pride
