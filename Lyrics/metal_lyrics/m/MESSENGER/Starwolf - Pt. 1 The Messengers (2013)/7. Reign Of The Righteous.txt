The tainted heart of ministry
Will tremble as we cry
The trail of broken promises
Will break and they will die

As a prey
To the Wolf they will fall
In the end
And the reign
Of the righteous will come

Oooh - for our vision with honesty
We will ride through galaxy
For this vision we've sworn to fight
Freedom and right

They killed the slaves on the red stakes of hate
The horizon did burn
The red robes must die
To this wolrd they shall never return

And the fear
Of the wolf they will know
In the end
And the reign
of the righteous will come
