See the writings on the wall
A new age has to come
It's the message we've sent to you
On the pamphlets made by our hands

In this night, aware of the kingdom come
Resistance enlightens the faculties

What is worth fighting for?
It's our vision of paradise!
Call to arms
We will fight
Comrades, now is the time to strike

We've lost our wisdom
We've lost our wealth
Infestation that crippled the lore
Sent by the Ethic Order
Like a prison warder
It's time for the outbreak of war
