All the night I stand thinking
Never finding the reason why she shakes me
The smile on my face, hiding my pain
Helps me to live in that world
All the night I cant find the sleep
Am I alone on this ball rolling on me?
The pain that tears me
Won't she never leave me?
The mask on my face
Helps me to live
No one to guess what I feal
No one to hear what I scream
