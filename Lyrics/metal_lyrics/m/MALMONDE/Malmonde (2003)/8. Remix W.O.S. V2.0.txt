What are you looking for in my brain?
You must leave my virtual mind's land
Every day I dress my dream with silence
Far is your world, my friend
Oh, do you know that silence is my destiny?
Does my life make sense for you?
You'll never go into my own universe
Look it up in your own reflection
You will find all solutions
Oh, do you know that silence is my destiny?
Why would you want to know what I feel?
Do you believe that I am sick?
Far is your world from my kingdom
Every day I dress my dream with colours
I will never leave my world for yours
Far is my mind, my friend
Oh, do you know that silence is my destiny?
My universe talks to me and I like it's breath...
