No fight! No fight for no one!
Slaves of machines, already too late
A.I. will take our breath
We cannot disconnect anymore
Metal machines have locked our gates
They will lead our hearts more and more
Subtilite artificielle
Psaumes electriques changeront la foi
Bien plus qu'une etincelle
Machines a tuer souffleront nos Lois!
As we created them they are
Nothing less, nothing more
No fight!
