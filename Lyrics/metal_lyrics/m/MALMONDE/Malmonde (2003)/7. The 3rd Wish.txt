Seated under a tree, he's awaking slowly
Lost he doesn't remember anything
Who am I?
It seems that the wind's talking to him
And the breath resounds in his head
What is your third wish, master?
But what were my other wishes?
Your second one was to become
Who you were before your first wish
Lost he doesn't remember anything
So, I want to know who I am...
It seems that the wind's talking to him
I thought as much, it was also your first wish!
