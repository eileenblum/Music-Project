Chained one by one with your life, with your cells
You obey your master through the rythm of the whiplash... whiplash!
Don't believe that you could buy your freedom
Break your chains and free yourself from this life of slave... of slave!
Fear...
Now it is time for you to awake andtake place among man
Free yourself from this life of slave
Fear of your chains, fear of your master
Fear of your cells, fear of yourself
