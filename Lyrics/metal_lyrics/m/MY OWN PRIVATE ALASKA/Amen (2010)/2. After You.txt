After you
Criminals are saints
After you
Whores are nurses
After you
I'm not scared at all
After you
Now that I've seen evil

Could it be a life?.. Never reminding...
Could it be my life?.. Erase erase...
Could it be a life?.. Never reminding...
Could it be?..
Burying my own corpse

After you
Hangmen are friends
After you
Soldiers are tourists
After you
I'm not scared at all
After you
Dead and unbreakable

Let's bury it, you'll see your crime

How can I be alive after you?

So wash my memory
