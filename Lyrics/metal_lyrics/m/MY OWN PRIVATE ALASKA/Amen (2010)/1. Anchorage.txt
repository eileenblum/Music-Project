Bye
Burn
Bold
Bored
Of watching the same movie
In my head

I remember me in that room,
Waiting for (the) sleep to come,
Waiting for minutes,
Waiting for hours,
Waiting for days...
Waiting for a miracle
To wake up from this nightmare.
Never stopping to say: it's not possible,
It's not possible, it's not my life.
Please take it and give it to the garbage truck.
Please take this life
And flush it in the toilets.
Throw it into the ocean. Burn it all.
Bury it six feet under.
Give it to your worst enemy.
Give my life to your worst enemy. Oh no...

Give my life
To your worst enemy.

I remember me under this public bench
Like a tramp like a motherfuckin' tramp.
Drinking alcohol and alcohol.
Eating pills and pills.
Mixing it. Feeling my mind going crazy.
Just to forget. I remember the cold.
I remember the piss.
I just earned about your crimes
And just wanted to die.
Not even to kill you...
Not yet. I just wanted to die,
And you were laughing.

Drinking for other reasons.

I remember what you never saw.
What you'll never see.
What you'll never remember.

What you never saw.
What you'll never see.
What you'll never remember...

Then I wanted to kill.
I wanted to kill you.
I wanted to kill them.
I wanted to kill the earth,
And after to kill me.
I got the picture of you naked.
I got the picture of you sucking cocks.
I got the picture of you with all theses bastards...
I got the picture of you asking my friends to fuck.
I got the picture of you lying to me.

I got no more pictures of you now...
No more pictures
No more

Bye
I know I didn't say it
Burn
First and last goodbye
Bold
Of having wanted to kill you
Bored
Of watching the same movie
In my head

So now thank you
Thank you so much bastards
All the cum you sent on her face
Was the fuel I need to reach Anchorage

Reaching Anchorage...
