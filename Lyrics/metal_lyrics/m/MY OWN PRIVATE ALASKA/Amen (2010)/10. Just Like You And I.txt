Come back to me
I'm not that made of stones
I'm not the one
Who used to it before
I will be wise
We will live joyfully
The other guys
Will never come for more

But don't ask me where I got this blood...

I would have killed
Everyone one our road
We will be quiet
We will be all alone
Don't cut your strings
It's for your own good, you know
Outside the world
Is not a place for you

But don't ask me where I got this blood...

But don't ask me where I found this knife

Don't be afraid
It's me my love
You think I changed
But God is ours above

I will tie you on our bed
I will tie you on our floor
I will tie you on our walls
I will tie you on our grave

So we'll be together isolated
So you'll learn the word: isolate
So we'll be together isolated
For love, for God: isolate

Just like you and I
Just like you
End.
