My girl, my girl
Don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun
Don't ever shine
I will shiver the whole night through

My girl, my girl
Where will you go?
I'm going where the cold wind blows
Her husband was a hardworking man
Just about a mile from her
His head was found
In a driving wheel
But his body
Never was found
