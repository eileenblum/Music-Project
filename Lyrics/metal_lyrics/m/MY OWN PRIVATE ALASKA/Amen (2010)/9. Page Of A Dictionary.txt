Let's talk
RIGHT
From a long time you use
Words you don't control
I will teach you their meaning
Let's RIGHT
WALK
From too long you talk
About weapons you don't know
I will learn you how to fight
Name on you
wipe your asshole
With a page of a dictionary
Let's fight
AS FOLKS
It's your last lines
So what will you write? what will you write
When you'll be down on your knees
Praying for something softer?
Cause you'll cry cause these words are bigger than you are
So let's stop, let's stop this shit
You're not the though guy you think you are
You're tiny, tiny boy
So wipe your asshole
With a page of a dictionary
A-B-C-Dead
E-F-G-Hate
