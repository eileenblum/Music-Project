Live on

Remember what we're made of
Remember where we came from

Through every rainbow
I'll see you rise
And don't you dare
Touch my hair if you need
To relieve the weight
Of this mother fuckin' guilt

It's so hard to sleep at night
It's so hard to wake up every day

Through every rainbow
I'll see you rise
And don't you dare kiss my face
I will find a solution
Live on
Cause I need it

Pray the lord my soul to keep
In order to survive
In order just to breathe

This is all I can say
This is all I can save
Your fuckin' memory
Cause it'll never be the same

Amen.
