Would you die for me? If I say please?
Would you sacrifice?
Would you call my name?
There's no other way out to live with it
I will knock on you door every night to beg you
I will write your name on the wall everyday
To show you the way.
I'll never kill you
I'll tell you
I'll tell you to
I'll tell you how
I'll tell you how to do.
On the second day, I'll bring you flowers.
Cause you're more beautiful than any woman I've seen
And the small of the rose will be the last thing
You'll recall when you will be dead
So read you name.
Just one please
My hand, your blood.
