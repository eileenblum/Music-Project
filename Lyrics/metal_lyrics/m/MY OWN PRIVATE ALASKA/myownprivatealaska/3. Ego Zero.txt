Hey
You want to talk to me?
You don't know who I am
Hey
You want to take the risk?
You'd better go anywhere
Hey
You want to touch my skin?
You'll maybe burn your hands
Hey you want to come to me.
Anywhere else, go anywhere
You'd better run
Outside the door
You'd better stay
Far away from me, far away

Hey
You're never land about the piece of shit I am?
Hey
I lie, I cheat I break
Let's runaway from me.

On every road, on every day
Think at you wealth, think at your life.
I don't wanna hurt, you don't wanna suffer
I don't wanna kill, you don't wanna die

Don't come to me
Little princess

Running away
