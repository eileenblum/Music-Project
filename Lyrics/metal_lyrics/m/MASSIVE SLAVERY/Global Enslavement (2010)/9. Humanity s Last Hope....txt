Humanityâs last hope...
Even in my darkest night
I never taught
We would be the last one
Standing before
The brutal end of our time

Like the sacrificed lamb
To an imaginary god
Weâve been designed
By our ancestors
To pay for their errors
Since the first humans
Started to live together
The brainwashed ones
Wanted to take control
Trying to create
A crop of followers
Weâre now indoctrinated
From the cradle to our graves

All slaved by the lines of a book
Written by hallucinated people
Blessed by fooled preachers
Power of mass alienation
The real cause of our world depravation
We have been warned
By all those signs
Left by the test of time
But weâve ignored it
And we continue to move backward

All slaved by the lines of a book
Written by hallucinated people
Blessed by fooled preachers
Power of mass alienation
The real cause of our world depravation

The cry of a shameful man
Lost into a breath of despair
The sound of resistance
Humanityâs last hope
Just before infinite silence
Lost into a breath of despair
Just before infinite silence
Lost into artificial salvation

From humanityâs first day
We just follow the way
Of our predicted path
Leaded by a blinded wrath

A wreck of our good will
Have decayed our destiny
The link that have united us
Is now rusted by religion
Some people used domination
And they burned our illusions
The last dream of humanâs life
Is now crushed by religious imagination

There is no God out there
There is no truth in cult
We have been fooled by them
Scared by all those damn lies

The cry of a shameful man
Lost into a breath of despair
The sound of resistance
Humanityâs last hope
Just before infinite silence
Lost into a breath of despair
Just before infinite silence
Lost into artificial salvation
