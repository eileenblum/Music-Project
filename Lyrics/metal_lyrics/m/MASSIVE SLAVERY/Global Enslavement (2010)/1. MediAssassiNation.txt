There you are again sitting on the couch
Not wondering about whatâs happening
Forgetting the fact that your life has no sense
Welcome to a song that will break up your prison

Living your life trough ignorant attractions
Becoming the mindless puppet they want you to be
You donât realize that trough their distraction
Youâre entering this brainless addiction

There you are again sitting on the couch
Not wondering about whatâs happening
Forgetting the fact that your life has no sense
Welcome to a song that will break up your prison [x3]

They will rape your mind
By making you blind
They will kill your dream
Exploiting your fear

Disturbing emergence of an imposed reality
Acting on your soul with subconscious brutalism
Blurring your vision with altered perceptions
Consumed by this overdose of disinformation
They will rape your mind
By making you blind
They will kill your dream
Exploiting your fear

MediAssassiNation
Modern day of corruption [x2]

Spitting on the rest
With no interest
Fuck them
Get your pride back
And stop wasting your life

Spitting on the rest
With no interest
Fuck them
Get your life back
And release yourself from this hack

Now itâs time to get the fuck up
And end this shit with a shock
To liberate us from their mind contraption [x2]
