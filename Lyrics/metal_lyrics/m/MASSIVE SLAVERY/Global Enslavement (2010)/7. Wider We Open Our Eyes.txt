As my mindâs paralyzed
In a warp of shame
I lost control of myself
Like I was in the middle of a dream
Trapped inside this cell of darkness
Like an eternal call of distress
Oh shit it canât be real
Iâm only facing our reality

Whatâs worst than facing your own nightmare?
When all those fears are fucking real
All the lies youâve tried to hide
Were only the reflect of what weâre supposed to be

Wider we open our eyes, deeper the night is
Reality is scarier than your maddest thought

Why are you scared of all this âshitâ?
Itâs only the truth exposed to you
You canât always dodge whatâs thrown at you
Stop to hide your head in the sand
And realize than your life only be
The way itâs supposed to be
Maybe deeper the night will rest
But wiser your mind will finally be

WAKE UP
Open your eyes
And you will see
Than our reality
Is nothing more
Than a âfuckingâ bad dream [x2]

Wider we open our eyes, deeper the night is
Reality is scarier than your maddest thought
