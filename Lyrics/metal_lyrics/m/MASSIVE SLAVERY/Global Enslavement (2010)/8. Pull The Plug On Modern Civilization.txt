Imagine the day after
Humanity turns to self destruction

Blinded by a rise of hate
Between each other
Even if they were like brothers
They produced the unthinkable
Feared by all for a hundred years
Our greatest leaders
Pulled the plug on modern civilization

They threw us back
To the dark ages
With our blood on their hands
They threw us back

Human cupidity
The final mistake
Nuclear apocalypse
Reducing earth to nothing

Imagine the scene of desolation
In the eyes of our population
Forced to reach the point of no return
Humanityâs ready to burn
The time of final solution
Bringing massive execution
A new kind of judgment day
What would you do if it was today?
An unpredicted anarchy
Of our modern society
The time of final solution
Bringing massive execution

Human cupidity
The final mistake
Nuclear apocalypse
Reducing earth to nothing

Blinded by a rise of hate
Between each other
Even if they were like brothers
They produced the unthinkable
Feared by all for a hundred years
Our greatest leaders
Pulled the plug on modern civilization
