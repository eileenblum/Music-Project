Illusive feeling of freedom
Corrupted by your self-will
Based on a easy lifestyle
And your curse to reach happiness
Ignorance and unconsciousness
Are blinding this illness
Now global enslavement
Is the way you where raised

This new way of enslavement is not
When youâre kept with chains
Trapped, exploited, and dominated
Itâs when they control your brain
Forced to contribute to this self destruction
Of our proud civilization
And when they use you
Contribute to this global wasteland
Known as modern world

On the path to reach conformism
Some forgot their existence
And now they act like a random neighbor

Believing in unreal illusion
Manipulated by religion
Itâs not what we stand for

We have now reached the point of no return
Massive slavery is ruling everywhere
Like it was all decided by your god
All mankind are now in line to serve
Pull the switch if youâre willing to die
Donât you see this burning paradise?

You are a slave! [x2]

Illusive feeling of freedom
Corrupted by your self-will
Based on a easy lifestyle
And your curse to reach happiness
Ignorance and unconsciousness
Are blinding this illness
Now global enslavement
Is the way you where raised
