Humanity made some mistakes
Itâs now our turn to face them
From the antics to the cold war
And donât forget the conquerors
The slavery, the genocides
10Â 000 years of oppression
Weâre forced to see that nothing changed
The quest of power always rises
Itâs in our blood
Mankind is born to be hostile
And overcome the weaker ones

Itâs brutal but thatâs the way life is [x2]
Historyâs made to look at the past
And to study all the faults made by man
To never commit those same moves twice
But itâs seems we will never learn

When I look at the future
I understand itâs going to be the same
Our leaders will always find a reason
To use power and corruption
To achieve their goal of global domination
This is what we call our destiny
Cause all we do is
To destroy ourselves
Humanity is
A total failure [X5]
