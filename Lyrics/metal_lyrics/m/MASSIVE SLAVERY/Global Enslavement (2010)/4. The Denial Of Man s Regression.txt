The denial of manâs regression
Based on the fact
That the less we know
The less we stand
In the progress of society
Our idiocy makes us
Believe in this fake reality
Knowledge of ignorance
Corrupted by torned mentality

The art of unconsciousness
The denial of manâs regression
Blinding the truth to your eyes
Refusing to face this reality
Since the origin of life
The evolution's process of all humans
Was an absolute failure

Seven billion people who are slaves
Of their own lifestyle and environment
This unconscious population
Doesnât seem to have a quest
And has no vision of their future
They seek only exclusive
And immediate happiness
The art of unconsciousness
The denial of manâs regression
Blinding the truth to your eyes
Refusing to face this reality
Since the origin of life
The evolution's process of all humans
Was an absolute failure

Are you wondering why?
We believe in all forms of illusions
Created by every single religion
Thatâs simply to hide our fears
Of what weâre doing with all human lives
Now the time is set to pray for redemption

Based on the fact that
The less we know
The less we stand
In the progress of society
Our idiocy makes us
Believe in this fake reality
Knowledge of ignorance
Corrupted by torned mentality
