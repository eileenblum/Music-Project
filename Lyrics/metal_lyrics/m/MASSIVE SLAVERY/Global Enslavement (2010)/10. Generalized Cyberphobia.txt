Generalized cyberphobia
Weâre surrounded by them
Theyâre slowly strangling us
From the latest invention
To the last useless cell phone
Taking all the space left
By our collective laziness
Technologyâs our new addiction
A lithium fix in our veins?

But you forget the price we pay
When we choose this easy way
Every man can now be replaced
By machines and computers
And now some are losing their jobs
Their pride and their dignity
Thatâs a new kind of butchery

Can you imagine how
Frustrating it can be?
When they say
Get the fuck out of here
You have been outclassed
By wires and metal pieces
Technology has become the new enemy

ENOUGH

Technology has become the new enemy
Slowly trapping us under his supremacy

Generalized cyberphobia
Scared of being left behind
And forgotten by all these changes
Technology finally shows his face

Unable to live without these objects
Weâre now completely enslaved
Supposed to simplify our lives
They have taken control of all people

Generalized cyberphobia
Scared of being left behind
And forgotten by all these changes
Technology finally shows his face
