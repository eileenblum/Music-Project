Once upon a time in Mongolia

Sitting outside of a wall
Trying to piss off the Chinese
Start to get a little bit old after a couple of centuries

So I'm saddling up with the boys
And heading on out to the west
Swarm our way to vasting Europe next

Watch your step
Watch your fucking step

Straight out of Ulan Bator
A crazy mother fucker named Genghis
Riding on a tiny horse
Torching the roof of your homesteads

Make way for the Mongol Horde
Coming back to fuck you up
Make way for the Mongol Horde
Coming back to fuck you up

Last time was a dry run
A piddly dress rehearsal
Next time it gets serious
The Horde is gonna get personal

Lock up your daughters
Your sons can die with you
You need a Mongolian mind to imagine the things that we're planning to do to you

No you cannot fucking imagine
No you cannot fucking imagine
No one will survive
No Europeans make it out alive

Straight out of Ulan Bator
A crazy mother fucker named Genghis
Riding on a tiny horse
Torching the roof of your homesteads

Moving for days at a time
And firing off arrows as I ride

A Turk with a ---
The host with the most
The Hun with the --- and we're --- the world

Make way for the Mongol Horde
Coming back to fuck you up
Make way for the Mongol Horde
Coming back to fuck you up
