Shot in the face
Shot in the head
Shot in the leg both ankles too but he kind of enjoyed it

Escaped from the camp
Jumped out of the plane
Chewed his own damn fingers off and said he enjoyed it

Fought in the fires
Fought with the Poles
Fought in the second war and more and still he kind of enjoyed it

Still find the time
To write it all down
While some of the dead --- the names of the women and children
Still he enjoyed the war

Take a good hard look at yourself
Whichever way the cards were dealt
You got two eyes and two --- arms
But you're still a fucking weasel

And it's not an empty pissing contest
Cause the --- is always --- leaders
Come the next gathering storm, we'll be weighed and found wanting

Born ---
Son of a king
Swearing like a seasoned trooper but he'd never surrender

Escape through the hills
Dressed in his --- suit
Walking solo to the border but he'd never surrender

Shot through the ---

Broke up the dinner's and the speeches and he never surrendered

--- well
Better than most
And somewhere deep down everybody has to decide a line that they will not cross

Take a good hard look at yourself
Whichever way the cards were dealt
You got two eyes and two --- arms
But you're still a fucking weasel

And it's not an empty pissing contest
'Cause the --- is always slower than medicine
Come the next gathering storm, we'll be weighed and found wanting
--- weakling child

This is an empty pissing contest

Come the next gathering storm, we'll be weighed and found wanting
