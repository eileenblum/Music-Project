God gave me consciousness but he never mentioned why
What's the use of living long if we're all condemned to die
Humbled in hospitals I have seen the bitter end
Everybody will die alone deserted by their friends

I want it back
Yeah, I want it back

Bleak springs of greying skies dead grass and twisted trees
Each year advancing like some insidious disease
Decaying year on year dear God there's no respite
One final lonely breath and then just endless night

I want it back
I want my money back
I want my money back

I want it back
I want my money back
I want my money back

I want it back
I want my money back
I want my money back

I want it back
I want my money back
I want my money back

This isn't what we asked for
It isn't what we wanted
I'll try to be grateful
But, I'm a little disappointed

It doesn't match the picture
The picture from the catalog
It doesn't --- the batteries
And I can't get it started

Who do I need to speak to about this

Post-coital cigarettes laced with a tired disgust
A broken contraceptive conception unjust
Another suckling babe another four score years
Another lifetime for some sucker stuck right here

So I want it back
I want my money back
I want my money back

I want it back
I want my money back
I want my money back

I want it back
I want my money back
I want my money back

I want it back
I want my money back
I want my money back

I want it back
