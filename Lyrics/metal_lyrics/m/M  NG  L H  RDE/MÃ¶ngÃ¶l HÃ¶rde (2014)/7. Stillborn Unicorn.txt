Some people have all the luck
Some people have it all

Born whole on time and wanted

It's just a casual fuck
It's just so casual
But every fuck has consequences

She has no skin on her back
She has no skin on her back
Bare? teeth and lidless eyes

Her little jaw hangs slack
Her baby jaw

Duct tape to cover her outsides
Bandages to hold in her insides
Duct tape
Bandages

Born a little early
Born a little early
Wasn't what you wanted
Wanted or not she was still born

She was stillborn
She was a unicorn

Cast out onto the streets
Cast out onto the streets
Making friends can be hard to do

When you constantly bleed
When you constantly
Drip blood every time that you move

The zombies wouldn't play nice
The zombies wouldn't play nice
She figured at least they would have some sympathy

But they just turned her away
They just turned her away
She wasn't welcome at their place
No skin and a horn on her face
No skin
Face horn

Born a little early
Born a little early
Wasn't what you wanted
Wanted or not she was still born

Mother was a pony
Father was a rhino
The neighbours didn't like it
Didn't like it at all

She's a unicorn

She should have died when she was born

She's gonna take revenge on all the people who wronged her
Her mother and her father and the doctor who delivered her
The undead and the freaks who so unkindly rejected her
You and anyone who culled their look when they looked at her

She'll take a meat cleaver to the trunks of your body
Carve you into pieces then she'll show you no mercy
Eat the choice cuts cast the rest of you aside
Bury the offal and the bones by the roadside

Born a little early
Born a little early
Wasn't what you wanted
Wanted or not she was still born

Mother was a pony
Father was a rhino
The neighbours didn't like it
Didn't like it at all

She's a unicorn

She should have died when she was born

You should have died
When you were born

You should have died
When you were born

You should have died
When you were born

You should have died
When you were born
When you were born
