John Archibald Wheeler once said that time is just nature's way of stopping everything from happening at once
As if the universe had a limited amount of bandwidth or a low RAM like an early 80's games console
Certainly without time things would make a lot less sense than they already do
And there's a whole host of reasons why time travel wouldn't work

If butterflies flap their wings to make hurricanes
Then crash-landing a DeLorean in the Cretaceous is gonna derail every little step of the pathway
From the garage where you built the thing in the first place
Back around to your parents fucking before an open fire on their second date

But we're scientists right open like new flowers to inquire into the universe, new ideas and new paradigms
And it might just be that our under-evolved ape-brains can't yet conceive the permutations and contortions of logic
That could lead from how we understand the world now to how it could be
That the wormholes and shortcuts that might throw Einstein for a loop but make the whole thing somehow impossibly possible

So, here's the deal
You have a time machine
The question is
What are you gonna do with it

I tell you something and you have to make plans
Arm yourself with a paper and pen
Hop your way through every Top 40 hit since The Hit Parade started and make a list

Learn all the words, remember the tunes
Make sure you have it all written down
Set the dial to where you're heading to
The year before Elvis: 1952

Now, welcome to your alternative life
You are the king of rock and roll insurmountably high

You have the songs you are the king of radio
React to every fashion like you knew exactly which way to go

It just seems to be effortless
The way you write them in ten minutes or less

They're gonna know but they just can't explain how you
Took their inner secrets and spewed them our your mouth
Before they could write them down

But, wait a minute
Seriously, wait a minute
This has happened before
I swear this has happened before

There were those two weird kids from Liverpool
They came out of nowhere
Wait a minute
John and Paul something

Paul McCartney and John Lennon
Came back from a different future
Armed with notebooks filled up with songs
Stolen from kids who now stay at home

Paul McCartney and John Lennon
Came back from a different future
Armed with notebooks filled up with songs
Stolen from kids who now stay at home

Mark Chapman was sent back in time
To assassinate John Lennon
Paul is left but the questions is
Who will be the T-1000?

Keith Richards

Think about it
He can't be killed
He will not die

Watch your back, Paul
Seriously, man
Watch your back
