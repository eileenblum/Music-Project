grasping for direction
i am the one who would not break
seeding an obsession
never forgiven, never saved

this repetition is strecthing me thin
i've grown tired of lying in wait
are you so convinced that you'll still be invincible
after you've sealed my fate

light's fall
night's birth

gathered around me the forsaken
their kin and their bretheren

you know me
you need this opponent
wrathful, seething outlet
surrender

time has run out

these sons of Abraham have given me no choice
following the word of law blindly as it's told
embrace this sentence, I'm committed to this role
delivered from imprisonment to sit on serpent's throne

light's fall
night's birth

you know me
you need this opponent
wrathful, seething outlet
surrender
