dark sky warning
mounting tension
conflict
white horse fall back
waning essence
conquest

among disorder the players find their places
prescient visions come to light
faithful rewarded to stand against the immitator
solidify the last divide
those who are worthy of recoginition in my graces
needn't be afraid to die
your sons and daughters follow in the path we gave them
ringing in the end of time

march on rags and bones
earning the paradise to come

trust in the highest and all your sins will be forgiven
courage found to heed the call
our strength relies on your service and obedience
devotion to the word of law
reject the knowledge, the origin of past offenses
lead the way to cull the flock
purge the pariah, the consequence of arrogance
collapsing at the bitter end of it all

dark sky warning
mounting tension
conflict
white horse fall back
waning essence
conquest

march on rags and bones
earning the paradise to come
