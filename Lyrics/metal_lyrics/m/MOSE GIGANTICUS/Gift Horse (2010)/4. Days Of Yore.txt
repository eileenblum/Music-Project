trust, loyalty, servitude
respect, patience, sincerity
incensed, justice, nevermore
outcast, wanderer, criminal
exiled in the days of yore

silence, darkness, solitude
distance, victory, limitless
lost, hopeless, merciless
broken, faithless, forsaken
desperate in the days of yore

i never wanted this
i never asked for this
this imposition is exhausting
dedication lost
unforgivable
fate forced my hand
choked by your pride

when I approached your throne
i asked for nothing but
a chance to prove my worth
an independent path
for the betterment
i've attained the impossible

exiled in the days of yore
desperate in the days of yore
