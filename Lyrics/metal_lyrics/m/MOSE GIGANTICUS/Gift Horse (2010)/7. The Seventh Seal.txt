we were deniers
those charged without belief
they'd say their convictions would save us

they speak of tomorrow
with lips and tongues so sweet
they prey on the sin of the blameless

they were the liars
the wolves in clothes of sheep
we'd pay for the debt of the angels

we're the remainder
those left behind to sleep
we stand at the end of the ages

you keep telling me I'd have everything
you promised me everything I want
and you'd keep telling me you're going to help me
that you're going to save me, but you won't
and now I'm in too deep
all I have left is sleep
