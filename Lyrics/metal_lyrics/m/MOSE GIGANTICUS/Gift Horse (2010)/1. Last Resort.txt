master of light
creator of sky and sea
suffer and die
conditional mercy

face to the ground
worship and fear me
beckon the call
the echo is deafening

rise, rise to the stage and be counted, ordered
aligned to stand on the shoulders of giants
rise, rise to the path of the righteous, glory
silence those who would stand in defiance

i am your everything
i am control
i am security
i'm what you've made me to be
i am eternity
i'm what you know
i am your fantasy
i am your god

awake from the dark
millenia laid to waste
this is the sound
the dawn of a new day

written to law
those who deny me
shiver and cry
at the hands of the saintly

wander the skies
never to rest again
the damage is done
you've already chosen

rise, rise to the stage and be counted, ordered
aligned to stand on the shoulders of giants
rise, rise to the path of the righteous, glory
silence those who would stand in defiance

i am your everything
i am control
i am security
i am your last resort
i am eternity
i'm what you know
i am your fantasy
i am your god
