the hand that feeds you holds you down
your will is broken
crack the switch to split the hide
maintain the order
one thousand generations long
these days are numbered

painted the fool
bane of existence
i offer you truth
summon alliance
friend of the ages
envisioned a rival
living indentured
exchanged for survival
sleeping in ruins
living in shadows
we care for our own
providing protection
forged in the fires
driven relentless
we've nothing to lose
embrace the hand of the left path

infected with identity
transgressions punished
the other side to what you've known
completes the circle
the days of dominance are passed
no gods or masters

hold fast the reigns of your senses
fear not the threat of revenge
those ruled by shame and specters
cast off your innocence
stand tall to face your accuser
no guilt for what's been done
it's time you meet your maker
entrenched on solid ground

painted the fool
bane of existence
i offer you truth
summon alliance
friend of the ages
envisioned a rival
living indentured
exchanged for survival
sleeping in ruins
living in shadows
we care for our own
providing protection
forged in the fires
driven relentless
we've nothing to lose
consumed in flames of the left path
