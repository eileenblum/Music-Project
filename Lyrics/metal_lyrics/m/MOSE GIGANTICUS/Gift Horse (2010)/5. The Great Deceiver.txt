dark sun, black flame
biding, waiting
watcher, titan
judgment pending

cast asunder, buried in blame
burdened to carry this epic disgrace
learning to savor the salt of my wounds
nourished by the bitter taste

ive got something against you
we'll never be able to settle the score
the song is the same thing
you've offered me nothing
i've heard it before
distorted revision
its easy to weight a one sided account
eternally bound in the struggle to know
which is the great deceiver

fight fire with fire
burning the bridges
fanning the flames
the time of the cleansing
but after it's over, what's left to be saved

sentenced, condemned
unchained, banished
vowing vengeance
dominion challenged
exposed tyrant

ive got something against you
we'll never be able to settle the score
the song is the same thing
you've offered me nothing
i've heard it before
distorted revision
its easy to weight a one sided account
eternally bound in the struggle to know
which is the great deceiver
