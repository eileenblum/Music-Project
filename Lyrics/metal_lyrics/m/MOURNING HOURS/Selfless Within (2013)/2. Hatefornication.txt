In silence we hunt, in night we live
There is no mercy, he who crosses our path

This world is blinded, by foul essence
Legends died in vain for some reason
To secure us all, though we donât hear them cry
But we remember them, who lied
Those who showed us the fairy land of ultimate lies

Still we believe, we believe in lies

Those who can see the truth, are forever forgotten

we will hunt all lost souls, we will make you see
we are the last ones who canât be deceived
we will make you free
hate fornication
