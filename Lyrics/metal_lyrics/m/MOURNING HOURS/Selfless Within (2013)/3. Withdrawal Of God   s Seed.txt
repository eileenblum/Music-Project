No words can describe this great love I feel for you....
I always thought my life would be lonely a cautious walk like a wolf...
Walking in the moonlight away from the magical feeling of happiness...
I would like to create a language, to tell you how much I love you..
I would like to write love poems, but everything inside me are signs,
Sign not easy to understand ... only with the touch

Every day, every night, every minute, every hour, every second..
Feelings are unexplainable ..
uncloud my mindâs sky, free me, feel me, feel my tongue.

dreamless nights,
sleepless eyes,
forever enslaved,
devoured hopes,
lived in illusion,
the sun is fading.

this world of ours, ours to take on and keep on living underneath the shadows of blood realm,
I would bleed, I would breed for you
I would bleed, I would breed (for us)

An withdrawal of your Godâs seed
