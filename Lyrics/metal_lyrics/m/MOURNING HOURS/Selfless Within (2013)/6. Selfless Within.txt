(singing alone in your heart, marching alone to the dusk.)

deep inside, I still sing the song of your dream land.
here your soul, have lost the spark to ignite once more

you have lost it all
their faith and hope
your dreams and life
have sympathized

you ignored, your own color of life

immortelle, standing above them all
still have no hands to reach to hold
immortal your dreams, thought you were
looking down and down to them all
