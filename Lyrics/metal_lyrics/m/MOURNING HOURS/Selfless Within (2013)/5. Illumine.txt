Take my hand, I will let you free from all agony
surrender now to your melancholy

[Chorus:]
shed your tears for me, I will shed mine
come under my wings, I will fight for you till I die
your blood from my blood. You cant but I bleed
my forest of solitaire, be my moon

in one morning, when she arrived
in my shadow, where she always hides
so cold, its warm inside her
tragedy for my lost love, glimmering far from me

your smile was taken, by doomed, dark lord
I hold the key, to open the gate of fate
a long lost broken dream, risen up to comfort
