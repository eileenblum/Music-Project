Our primordial dreams fleeting towards the amber of misfortune
Remedy for the gods of lies within us to surrender for all heathen pride
bring back all glory, bring back all whoâve lost their lives in the name of all holy war

Redemption of sanity lacks the courage to revive
Misleading lads onto the edge where the rainbow of hypocrisy begins
Where nation cries for the birth of her twisted deluded sons
Where my flesh crawls with hatred

Infinite flames of outraged souls
From the depth of our core 
Howling of freedom nailing the hopes of castle down
Where they cremate us, our glory, our love
No storm of truth nor thy prayer can salvage our ashes
No wind can blow us in the sky of this tearing blues
From this tainted soil, we shall remain dead for good

Where the line draws between dreams and reality
Where I no longer exist to believe in 
Take me where lights exist 
to embrace the darkness within 
Where the sun shines down on me
Where I will lay to rest in peace

Burial of our hopes shall go on
