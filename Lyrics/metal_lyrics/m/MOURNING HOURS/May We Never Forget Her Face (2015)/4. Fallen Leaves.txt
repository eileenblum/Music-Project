Empathy, those tear drops of hope
Devoured your soul, embedded with lust
Cosmic lines, drawn us apart
from the shivering skies, led us be alone
Shining above, waiting to disappear
the night has fallen like the torn blanket over me
Let me feel, let me feel your sorrow 
Let me borrow your pain, just once, just one more time

Signs, higher, deeper, darker everywhere.
Things that could never go wrong
I, we, collapsed beneath our pride
Could I still hear your scream?
