Fallen leaves beneath my feet
Dying lights surround
The fire of my heart, that burns, the whole emotion

Smelling the scent of burnt woods
Tears joy the atmosphere
The aspiration of life, runs low, towards my gallows 

dance, dance my spirit

Under the bridge of life, I saw the forsaken child
the foul smell of rotten perfume of the undead
My stolen faith untied me from my sins 
the autumn they preached, rather I die

Tyranny of oneâs happiness
that led me through 
her loss from my reign
from my chest to swamp 
ripped, broken, shattered
