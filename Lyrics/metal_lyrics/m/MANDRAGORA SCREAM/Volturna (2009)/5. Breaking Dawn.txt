Time to get all the thrills pretty baby
That you will find in the cradle of time
Come, we'll get over.
My moon is slowly
Waning in this lake of silence again

Still I'm waitin' while you're dyin'

In your Nightmares you will find me
In this Twilight you will taste my "Embrace"
Catch my unlife we'll be faraway
Leave your life here 'cause I'll be your Midnight Sun

When You'll close your fearing (staring) eyes
Will you still fight by my side?
And When you'll lose your creed of life
Will you still catch my fall, dear?

Still I'm waitin' while you're dyin'

In your Nightmares you will find me
In this Twilight you will taste my "Embrace"
Catch my unlife now I'm feelin' dying
Leave your life here 'cause I'll be your Midnight Sun

...you will find me...

Time to get all the thrills pretty baby
That you will find in the cradle of time

In your Nighmares I confess my life
In this Twilight you will taste my "Embrace"
Catch my unlife we'll be faraway
In this brightlight see my staring eyes
A new creed to believe in...
To get out of control...
To keep falling from heaven...
While your love is hiding me in you...
