I live to get you... now
I need to get you...

It's time to get you
Live to get you!
I want to get you
Dream, don't go!

It's time to get you
Need to get you
Dream to get you
Clouded eyes like a drug

This is the answer, this is the omen
This is the calling from your Hell,
This is the calling, this is the calling,
I want to abuse your love that cries!

Live to get you!
I want to get you
Dream to get you
Dream, don't go!

It's time to get you
Need to get you
Dream to get you
Clouded eyes must know!

This is the answer, this is the omen
This is the calling, from your Hell,
This is the calling, this is the calling,
I want to abuse your love that cries!

This is the calling,
Dark lullabies came through the rain
Callin' you my endless tears...
Callin' you my virgin eyes

The callin' from your Hell, again
Will drain the stream of life
And voices from the deepest abyss
You'll hear them callin'

This is the time for us,
The time for us,
I never realized
This is the time for us,
The time for us,
I've been your nightmare's light

This is a kind-cry
Like-a pain life
Silent in your pain
Trough the grave,
Cries trough the rain,
Dark lullabies,
I saw in your...

My endless tear...
My endless tear...
You're my endless tear...
