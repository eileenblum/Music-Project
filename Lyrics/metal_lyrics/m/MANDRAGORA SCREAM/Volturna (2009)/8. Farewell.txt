Lucifer &amp; Him

Him:
"Lucifer race whispers in silence
Condemned to stand on the gallows of violence"

Lucifer:
"The heroes die with a smile upon their face and why'd you call my golden rays Horns?"

Bless the night hear my cryin'
All the days in your life
Lust of mind Heavens dying
Son of my dark dawn
Where's my life? Here in my arms
Where's my blame? Here in my soul
Help me to hate you while I'm goin' away from you...

Him:
"Lucifer race whispers in silence
Condemned to fight and leave the world insane"

Lucifer:
"I'll be the one that carries faith in life and lead in the dark of our upcoming lives"

Blasted mind sinful lies
Can becloud our life light,
Lord of disgrace
Sacrificed and
Melodies delight
Where's my life? Here in my arms
Where's my blame? Here in my soul
Help me to hate you while I'm goin' away from you
