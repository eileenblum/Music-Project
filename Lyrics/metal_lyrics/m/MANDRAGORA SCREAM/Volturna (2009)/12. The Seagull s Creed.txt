Prophets tell, while wind strings play,
Tales at dusk which weave their lair...
Of deliria silhouettes,
Timeless nymphs, ghastly mermaids,
Gather the pearls of their names

In full moon reveries,
Follow the seagull's creed.
Far from harbours of life
Into the realms of mist.
Spread wings of empathy
And you will blindly dance.
Masquerade of the sea vampires

Light the candles of a rain
Clad in vestiges of pain.
Once the golden mirrors age
And the princess rots insane,
When your beauty mourns in fear.
Gather remnants of your name.

In full moon reveries,
Follow the seagull's creed.
Far from harbours of life
Seaward, far, through the gates
Lidless eyes, loss that blooms.
A prelude to the choir
Masquerade of the sea vampires
