I am the streets of glass
In these sad days
My stare's lost into the void
People get lost

I can't reach a Paradise
It's always higher... more than I can bear
I can't see with my blind eyes
But through my tears of fire

Save me, my soul
Forgive me
Show me, just hear! hear my prayers

When I go down, when I go down
It's too late to pray for the lies
You never cried

Please God put an end
To this sadness
Let the livin' stand
Let the dead rest
Save the lonely souls
Gathered by your side
Take me out from this grave
Give me life back
