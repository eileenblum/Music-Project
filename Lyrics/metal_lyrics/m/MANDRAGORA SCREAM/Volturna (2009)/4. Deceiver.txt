Dirty child! Like a liar
Grim like a death knell
This moonrise... is agony
Ghoulish in your dreams

Never again!
Never across my mind,
Never without a fight
Brambles and hauntin' lanes
Lickin' your lips so pale

Lifeblood forsaken
Coverin' your eyes
Nobody knows where your
Tears and cries were lost

Never again!
Never across my mind,
Never without a fight
Brambles and hauntin' lanes
Lickin' your lips so pale
Never across my mind,
Never without a fight
Brambles and hauntin' lanes
Lickin' your lips so pale

Your gruesome claim
Your cravin' blood
Is lifelike and uncertainly thrall
You'll never see me die and lying while...
Your louringly love me!

Never so close to life
Illusion of a hollow gaze
Livin' now worn inside
Dawnin' through this Hell in vane
I'll never with blood tonight...
