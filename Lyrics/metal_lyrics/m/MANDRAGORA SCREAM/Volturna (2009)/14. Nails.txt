I'm fallin' in hell again
Through the memories of the past
I'm feeling my scorching veins
My lips taught to withe

And I could not see the blame
And I could not change my faith
And I could not stop the blade
Should I go to the right side?

And I could not see the blame
And I could not change my faith
And I could not stop the blade
Shall I be the dooming braid I sought up

Just hear me! Hear me,
Callin' our your name...
Hear me, callin' out your name...
Hear me,
Hear me, callin' out your name...
Hear me, callin' out your name...

I'm scratching my bleeding brain
To feel your embrace again...
I'm clouded by dark disgrace
And It's digging my grave...
