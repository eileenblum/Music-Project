His host's to fight
It's close to mine
You blow on the dice
The game begins...

They're close to fight
The creed, the blame,
The clearing flame
Telling your scaring fears

I only hide...
My soul is not white...
Your side should...

You, why do you scare up my soul?
A preacher told me the white side should die...

It's killing me
It's killing me, it's killing me, it's killin' me...
Why do you pray and lie?
It's killing me, it's killing me, it's killin' me
Why ain't you scared my dear?

Falling through your mind
Memories of dying
And beatings in your sights
What you're fearing
Thundering your mind
I can feel your pain
Thundering your mind
What you're fearing
It's killin' me... I can never die

Your bloody eyes
Keep watching me
You roll the dice
It's time to kill

A gloomy mist
Over the battle field,
Jerusalem will soon be free

I hide...
My soul is not white...
Your side should...
It's killing me,

You can hardly
Drag yourself,
A fortune teller
Said you should fight...
