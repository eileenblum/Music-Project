We are ravin' madness
Minds rend, tear.
We are waitin'
Ice-bars clench our breath away.

We are creepin'
Through this swallowin' rail.
We are starin'
Enlight our hellish curse inside.

They always crucified your flesh with all your dreams,
Lord drive us through last shakin' veil of faith and save.....

We are ravin' madness
Minds rend, tear.
We are waitin'
Ice-bars clench our breath away.

We are creepin'
Through this swallowin' rail.
We are starin'
Enlight our hellish curse inside.

They always crucified your flesh with all your dreams,
Flames of pale death are callin'
Spectral shades of claim.....
