Believin' in your heart/bleedin' down your soul...I dienow I rise again/for everytime I cried.../here I am...comin' from Star way/now that I hold your light again.../I'll stay awake and save our/neverendin' love and spells..../Close youe eyes/and let me take you where you know/heaven seems so strange.../In the Land of Spells/and lmagic dazzlin' light.../I never saw this place.../and then hold the love they couldn't take/away before.../never take before.../from you
