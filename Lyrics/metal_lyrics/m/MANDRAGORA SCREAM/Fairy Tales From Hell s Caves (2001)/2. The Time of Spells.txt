There was a time where only spells/goin' through my enchanted life/you touch and come where I saw and see/Deepen inside my wishes' well/I look for you/babe all around/tell me if you're ready/to be all...mine

You'll change your mind if you drink this!/you'll see the light if you trust me/take my hands and hold me/live my life and come after me/Finally found my wishes' well/now howlin' cries are dancin' around/you can still join them wait and see/Life after deep death is fallin' down/searchin' for somethin' you can change/your mind/now!/but you remember...I'll be here!

break my heart and I'll squeeze you/tear my mind and I'll blast you,/be all mine and I'll bless you/call my name and I'll save you/Now your desires dance through the spells/but if you cry they will come back/you can be blessed/ if that is what you want.../my dear!

you're goin' into your grave.../remember your choice!/If you want to save your life,/now you call my name!
