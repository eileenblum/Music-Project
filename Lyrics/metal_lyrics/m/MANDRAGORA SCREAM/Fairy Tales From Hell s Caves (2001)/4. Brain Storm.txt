Follow me all over/where you are there is no life/always you the only/oooh you...! can hear/me/save my brain/save my death/and now.../tell me if you now can me fly/you now can cry and give me your light/now I stay in my creeper.../I remember shadows life/every night they come alive/always you the only one/always you can, only the end.../now, if you want kiss my stormy brain/do you know where my black rain ends...?/listen to the roar of the stormy sea/feel how my soul now is frozen breeze/my quiverin' voice bewitched by the wind/now I fell under these green leaves
