[*Including "Sarah Enchants the Children" written by John Debney, re-arranged and performed by Morgan Lacroix and Terry Horn]

Ours is the time/ours is the hour/Ours is the magic/Ours is the power

Come little children/I'll take thee away/into our land of enchantment/come little children/The times's come to play/here in my garden of magic
