Unhurt through this leap, through this death,
dreaminess in my rent dark heart,
with maggotâs flames,
my dyinâ mien dies in sleepinâ heaven of my life.
Heaven was made - of blind eyes by His lapses stained of blood...
Misery in my mind - unwanted hallowed relics and nightmareâs stars.

ITâS TIME TO GO!

Like a spectral land, His wane crucified!
My redemption falls, hushinâ this pain of faith!
âLacunary light!â
This grave calls my name!
Hauntinâ nights on my blightinâ lanes full of life.

Rave - THIS LANE
never again - YOUR LIFE
a roseâs ray but only tedious hone of shades - DISCLOSE
and ravinâ lanes - DEMISE
on nerves of life, walkinâ on this martyrâs crown.
Walkinâ across - this dim playground, I live in lanes of tombs.
I crucify - on this fadinâ spirits all these spikes of hopes...

YOUâLL BE CRUCIFIED!

Like a spectral land, His wane crucified!
My redemption falls, hushinâ this pain of faith!
âLacunary light!â
This grave calls my name!..
Hauntinâ nights on my blightinâ lanes full of life.
