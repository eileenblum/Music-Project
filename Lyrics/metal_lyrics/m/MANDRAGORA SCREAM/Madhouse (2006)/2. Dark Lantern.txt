Never again will I taste in your passion
this vain call that dies...
Never across sacrifice will I lose my dark guide...
Dazed in my dark and ephemeral wail that rapes a cool light,
in a corpse-like, haunted, nightmare I die...

Never in life
After tonight
Through my sighs
Don't you change
I will lie

Always arisin' over moulderin', enlightened swear,
never a light can die, Dark Lantern, darklin' in light...

Wavin' this shine, overwhelmed by this whirl,
and you engravin' my gaze heavenwards in your face,
are greedy of grace and lust.
Graspin' your heart,
you mourn through risin' of holy embraces.

Groanin' through this tearflow, I feel It's getting dark...

Always arisin' over moulderin', enlightened swear,
maybe this light, Blind Lantern, in the Silence, is blindin' my mind...

Always arisin' over moulderin', enlightened swear,
never a light can die, Dark Lantern, darklin' in light...

Always arisin' over moulderin', enlightened swear,
never a light can die, Dark Lantern, darklin' in light...
Always arisin' over moulderin', enlightened swear,
maybe this Lantern in the Silence, cries... and lies.
