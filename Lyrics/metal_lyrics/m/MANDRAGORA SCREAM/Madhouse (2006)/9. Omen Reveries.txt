World without end hellish ancient age
drove us through last shakin' veil of fate!
'Till I found your haze in this fallin' aim,
inklin' of slight madness, could you see?
Holdin' this time all your shades of dreams
breathless on your lips,
longin' for a kiss again!

Breathin' all your unlife...
...love and sigh...
...love and sigh...
Breathin' all your unlife...
Every time I die inside your rent time,
...every time I die...

While your hands handle &amp; embrace your dreams,
flames of pale death, callin' reveries,
spectral shades of claim.
Crystal tears in veins again!

Breathin' all your unlife...
...love and sigh...
...love and sigh...
Breathin' all your unlife...
Every time I die inside your rent time,
...every time I die...

...love and sigh...
...love and sigh...
Lachrymal's land sigh...
Every time I die inside your rent time,
...every time I die...
