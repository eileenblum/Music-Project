"Flat lineâ¦ brain deadâ¦ now it's real"

Vera walkin' in the sun...
Vera, Vera walkin' in the sun...
Why do you walk alone? I saw you walkin' forward.
Vera, walkin' in the sun...
Vera, Vera walkin' in the sun...
Why do you wanna love?
Why do you wanna love?
After all I believe
you will last, ghost of swan
in my head,
I'll dream of you're your heart 'till the end...
After all you're diein', love
tonight you'll soar...

'Cause our whole dawn enchains in love...
'Cause your life will return for me...
All your life will return from me

"Flat line"

Vera, walkin' in the sun...
Vera, Vera walkin' in the sun...
Why do you walk alone?

I'm not alone, I'm with you! You don't hear me?

Why do you walk alone?

All my dreams, falling leaves
through my arms and my hands,
sing like dirges,
why don't you want to return?
For your love I'll cry beyond...

My crescent moon...
'Cause I still want to hold you tight
and I still want to feel your might.

...For your love...
