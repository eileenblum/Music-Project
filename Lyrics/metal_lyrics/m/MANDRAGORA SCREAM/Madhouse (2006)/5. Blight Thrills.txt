Who melts with me in a grave...
Lightnings light my shade...
...You spectral life of fade.
I can feel your grace.

Leakinâ of life,
Livinâ my blight time,
leadinâ your eyes.
veilinâ my heart, I cry...

...I can feel lost inside my way...
Breathinâ your night,
I see my mad blood
burninâ your might.
itâs burstinâ through your half-light,

like a gravestoneâs enlighteninâ sigh.

Pale misty lane of pain,
Lightnings light my shade...
now brings me down insane,
I can feel your grace.
leavinâ a smell of rain...

Leakinâ of life,
Livinâ my blight time
leadinâ your eyes.
and veilinâ my heart, I cry...

I can feel lost inside my way...
Breathinâ your night,
I see my mad blood
burninâ your might.
itâs burstinâ through your half-light,

like a gravestoneâs enlighteninâ sigh.

Luciferâs groan, inside my heart can show me a white,
lowland of snowy life, that will rise in your hands.

Itâs time to go...

Vivid of light you canât deny,
Now that itâs time to go!
In my mind Iâll rape your love...
Hear me!
through the night.
Callinâ you tonight.

Who melts with me in a grave...
Lightnings light my shade...

You spectral life of fade.....
