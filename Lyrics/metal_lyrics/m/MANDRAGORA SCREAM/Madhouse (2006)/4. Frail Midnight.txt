I was made of light,
I was made of life,
I may lose my faith
but I wonât lose my pride.
Iâll outgrow my race
Iâll brave-out with you
lives that engrave my brain.

My wings full of pain, holdinâ you with me,
I will promise you...
Weavinâ flawless chains, through the dawn of shades.
You said, you belong to me!
You said, youâll belong to me!

Iâll disclose your shades
âtil the rest of time...
I will give you dark Heaven, Infernal nights...

...Evenfall of night...
...Innards of my mind...

Limelights engrave my brain
blasphemous and blind everything you saw.
I will promise you...
Weavinâ flawless chains, through a midnightâs shade
You said, you belong to me!
You said, you belong to me!
Thereâs a place where youâll belong to me...
Frail midnight through my haze.

...Creepinâ and dyinâ across sacrifice
youâre greedy of grace, your Jesus a slave.
Youâll rave in your creed.
My Luciferâs groan is alive.
My bleedinâ faith reigns!

Blasphemous and blind everything you saw.
I will promise you...

Weavinâ flawless chains, through a midnightâs shade.
You said, youâll belong to me...
You said, youâll belong to me...
Thereâs a place where youâll belong to me.
Frail midnight through my gaze
Frail...

Holdinâ you with me!
