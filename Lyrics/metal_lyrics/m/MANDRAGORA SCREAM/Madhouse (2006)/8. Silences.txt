And now Iâm breathinâ in your corpse,
callinâ from you...
A fadinâ of an eerie glow
cellers out of sight,
lanes, lanes! ...callinâ!

Iâm madly lustinâ your haunted haze,
enchanted, fading soul,
I feel an ooze inside my hands
shakinâ, bloody blaze, eyes, cries!
Calling you...
Now!

These night shades rise up behind
snakinâ on my limbs, limbs!
With murky whisper roaminâ mist
you are my hideaway...
Mine!

...Silences into, cover me,
like a tongue in, this still of life...
Coverinâ your feelinâ through might,
lickinâ your blood with my sighs.

So that I can breath all your flesh.
Christen my haze!
With your grim captivatinâ call
balefires and gale
writhe, writhe ...callinâ!

And now Iâm breathinâ in your corpse...
Come and get me!
I feel an ooze inside my hands
shakinâ and bloody blaze, eyes, cries!
Callinâ you,
Now!

These night shades rise up behind
snakinâ on my limbs, limbs!
With murky whisper roaminâ mist
you are my hideaway...
Mine!

...Ominous sin, became true daydreams
daunt me made of mist of grace.

Recallinâ me back to life
recallinâ you back to life...
