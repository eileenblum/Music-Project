Blessed in the dark ...
Collapse of heart...
Silence of writhe...
The book of my life thatâs risinâ again tonight
recallinâ in life a death-line in my mind
and livinâ in pain without your Black Star.

Scratchinâ my heart,
housinâ my death
naked by sores
of ever-livinâ lust,
Luna across my veins...
Hoverinâ through this sky... and I die...
Dyinâ in a creep of my flight without life... a long ways of a blind faith.

A whirly around, blossoms fade away...
Only frazil prayed afar...
Flaminâ cries glancinâ afterlife,
after all Iâm dieinâ for a line
moulder creed of dawn thatâs fallinâ
In a gruellinâ, crowninâ.

Womb of my fade,
He gnaws my nerves
while I dwell
through dark throws
with His eyes of lust, deified.
I sacrificed my corpse and now... Iâll fall!
For His curse and His prayer âtil the end Iâll drag to life all my scars.

A whirly around, blossoms fade away...
Only frazil prayed afar...
Flaminâ cries glancinâ afterlife,
after all Iâm dieinâ for a line
moulder creed of dawn thatâs fallinâ
In a gruellinâ, crowninâ.

Groaninâ through the bounds of earth,
graspinâ tightly darkest thread...
Glowerinâ on my last return,
from cavalries of dyinâ dawn...
Dreaminâ now my dragonfly,
dieinâ for my dragonfly
and soul bells.

On your love, in your sighs
Iâm writinâ of all my life...
Callinâ you, callinâ now,
callinâ in your heart all my glowinâ light.

A whirly around, hauntinâ nights tonight,
only frazil prayed afar...
Flaminâ cries glancinâ afterlife,
after all Iâm dieinâ for a line
moulder creed of dawn thatâs fallinâ...

Breathing in the dark...
Twister in heart...
silence in night...
The book of my life
of silenceâs night, Iâll write.
