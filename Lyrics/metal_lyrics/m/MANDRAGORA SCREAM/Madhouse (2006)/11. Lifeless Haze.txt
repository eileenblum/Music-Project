My sighs swallowed through this rail,
ice-bars, clench my breath away...
Maddened mind rends tears when I see your face,
maiden, like misty nights...Crucified.

Lovely &amp; insane mental excitement,
I will lose all my lonely wings
and I want you to come to the land of spring, and...

Lodestarâs, Iâll summon all my stars,
...brambles in my arms...
Enlighten my hellish curse inside
only bewitched by your light.
Destroy, enlighten, unveilinâ your heart,
breathinâ my lifeless and lonely haze.
This life, beyond inscrutable tide,
weâll meet again if you wanna rise.

Enchased in my spasm of faith,
dark heaven falls, faraway hell...
Now Iâm defyinâ my blindinâ race,
doleful place...Creepinâ along my desire,
...fades away...
Never mourns, angel, life must regret...

I will lose all my lonely wings
and I want you to come to the land of spring, and...

Lodestarâs, Iâll summon all my stars,
...brambles in my arms...
Enlighten my hellish curse inside
only bewitched by your light.
Destroy &amp; enlighten, unveilinâ your heart,
breathinâ my lifeless and lonely haze.
This life, beyond inscrutable tide,
weâll meet again if you wanna rise.
