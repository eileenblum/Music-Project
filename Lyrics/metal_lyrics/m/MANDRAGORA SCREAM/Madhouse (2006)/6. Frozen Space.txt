Empty in this space
Itâs snowinâ life in my senses...
Dream-maker! Fallinâ this grace
only silence reigns.

Until your gaze,
like a rail brims my heart
enlaced in this ivory reign,
nothinâ! Will collapse in vain.

Souls are meltinâ now inside, and...
take my life and bring me away, then!

Lookinâ from my fate
tremblinâ flare of unrest...
Iâm bleedinâ âcause I saw on this earth
Falls, and star-set rain.

Rise! Hushinâ this frozen-space, darkness of this unlife,
again we can try to fly...
Lovinâ ivy never sere, blindinâ dreams of life
end whenever we are here, weâll live againâ¦

Lastinâ dark age,
risinâ, cravinâ, whilom time
recallinâ a revenant through rest...
In my darkest rave.

Inside my hands,
only shade melts away, my hell is
made of blindinâ dreams... of eternity...

How many stars are there in the universe?
So many! More than you could ever count!
Is there music in space?
No thereâs only silence.
But silence is music!
Yes, if you know how to listen.
Are there other people in the universe?
Thatâs a good question. What do you think?
I donât know!
The universe is bigger than anything, so if itâs just us,
It seems like an awful waste of space!

Rise! Hushinâ this frozen-space, darkness of this unlife...
again we can try to fly...
Lovinâ ivy never sere, blindinâ dreams of life
and whenever we are here, weâll live...

...Again...
