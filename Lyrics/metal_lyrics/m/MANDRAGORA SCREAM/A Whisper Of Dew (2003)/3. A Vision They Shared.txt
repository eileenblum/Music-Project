[King Seal &amp; Queen Instria]
I feel, rapin' all my mind,
Freezin' ghosts dancin' around
Cryin' through hell drives me insane
While my soul burns in time
You enjoy my death-I'll curse your soul with my spells
No Prince from your womb-I'll wretch you and all your dreams
Oh! your sinful lust-Thirteen nymphs will tear you apart
My breath won't die-My Nymph's white eyes 
I'll bring the powers shinin' at night
Invoke breeze of black storm
Thirteen nymphs will show white eyes
Ebony vultures will fly 
You enjoy my death-I'll curse your soul with my spells
No Prince from your womb-I'll wretch you and all your dreams
Oh! your sinful lust-Thirteen nymphs will tear you apart
My rhymes will return-Your last voice is melody 
They will breed your son-Three tremblin' vultures will star
Mylast hero- No one will sing
