[Isserggia]
Raised by my death,
Unleashed diamond grave
I remember...
Real spasms of shadows
Laid in sighs of my eyes,
Dark lips of hope
Count...
I feel the presence of my
Saviour; he came once...
His pale hands, his convulse
breathin' and
His shakin' dance on my old dress of
Chrysanthemums...
Come, Count Veilembre, give me
Your embrace
Inside your winged cape lullabies in silence
Dwelt deep floodin' in your heart
A cobweb born from dreams
Weak infant crystal choir murmurin'
Unveiled, a romance of disgrace
All quiverin' memories painful on deathbed,
King Seal's tears 
Memories of a dark moon
