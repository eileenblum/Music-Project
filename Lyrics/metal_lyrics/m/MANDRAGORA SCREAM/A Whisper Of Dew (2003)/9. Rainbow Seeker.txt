It's cold...I feel lured in my mud-eyes...
I see you layin' by the pond
And I can laugh and I can cry
I want to kiss your lifeless hair...
I'm tryin' to embellish my rainbow now eerie glow...
I need more orphan's eyes, shiftin' colours for my rainbow
Feminie eyes' light I seek all over
Come to my castle of flames over the forests...you'll be dressed
Welcome to all the secrets of my gloomy life
Touchin' the glass doors look at the crescent moon
I'm tryin' to embellish my rainbow now. Stay with me!
Trails of lightyour wore...forever lost
I will guide you, through iron gate doors
I never leave you, I never flee from you. No more weepin'
No more tears,my fairy.Stay with me and you will wear eternal life's light
I saw my years pass through our lives. Exquisite perfumes, golden shades
Ancient tapestries and more...but she wants a little knight
Runni' after in the castle 's hallways
Goodnight kissin' at nightfall, she loves her child
Throughout, life like a percious gift for her
For my rainbow feminine eyes' light
I seek all over...Come to my castle of flames
Over the forest. You''l be dressed with clothes of wind,
Stay with me and you will wear eternal life's light.
