[Count Veilmbre]
Closer every door to me
Hide all the world from me
Bar all the windows and shut off the light
Do what you want to me
Hit me and laugh at me
Darken my day time and torture my night
If my life were importat I would ask
Will I leave her die
But I know the answers lay far from my world 
Close every door to me
Keep those I love from me
Children of Israel are never alone
For I know I shall find my own peace of mind
For I have been promised a land of my own 
Moments of disgrace
One blazing storm
And Count Veilmbre
Give me your embrace 
Just give me a number
Instead of my name
Forget all about me and let me decay
I do not matter
I'm only one person
Destroy me completely
And throw me away 
If my life were important I would ask
Will I leaver her die
But I know the answers lay far from this world
Close every door to me
Keep those I love from me
Children of Israel are never alone
For I know I shall find my own peace of mind
For we have been promised a land of our own
