[Issergia]
Rainbow Seeker you can't see
And I'm a slave about your dreams!
But now I feel my gloomy Prince
I could give you my wings to him all nights
A frozen darkness is melody
Now our love will defy the flames
And there is nothin' left to say
'cause I can feel your heart that beats
I lay on you my ruby gaze
You cloth my end...
Now we take our best revenge
And no one can breake our dreams
We, forever...together...
I will give you all my nights
Take my heart into your breeze
Embracin' whispers into my wings
Fireflies sailin' through dark waves
My ruby castle waits for our bliss...
Now our love will defy the flames
Never go beyond my life
I can build a cradle of dew
Let our love live in tears so blind...
Take my heart into your breeze
Fireflies sailin' through dark waves
I can build a cradle of dew
let our love live in tears so blind. 
[Dedicated to Legolas]
