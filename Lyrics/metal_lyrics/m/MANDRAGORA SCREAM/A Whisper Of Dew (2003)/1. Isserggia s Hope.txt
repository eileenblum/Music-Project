[Isserggia] 
If only this key and its fleetin' ghosts of melody could mesmerize my hands;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  If only I were to bring you back by weaving and carvin' his divine ballade
Into my heart, playin' it to border on ecstasy.
If only I could drag back the tremors and litanies of your symphony...
...If only I could deceive time...
This is the genesis my love...
This key was the very first step
Towards you... 
The call of my wild serenades
And your heart's rest
