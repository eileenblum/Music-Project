[Issergia]
I'll never die, I hold my blaze on storm witched whirl
True ways are flowin' on leaden skies
Deity and mist, that are that mirth behind my death
While groans melt in whispers my hymns are thine
I'll be there-fight
In your eyes-light
Through the dark-reign
All your pain
In your mist-lost
With your wings-flight
Through your mind-rape
All your dreams, all 
Lain' to lie, and right away, strugglin' through your veins
Your heart...
'Till I bite thy neck again, this fall won't be sweet in vain
Fallin' leaves, like tears comin' down from scary lights
On thy pale lips like diamonds cryin'
Dyin' away from my life I get lost in thy
Gloomy eyes that I'll never stray over and ever again
Bloody ballade
Bloody Ballade right away, strugglin' through my veins
Again life
Bloody balladem life...
[dedicated to my brother Brando &amp; Mary]
