[Issergia]
When the sun begins to fade, a blaze of blood embrace between us
Our kisses like a falme reborn, wrigglin', rise, snowin' through death
Ever in our life...Gusts of wind break into out cold
Love has never made a choice I realize it facin' two mirrors
Dreamin', bleedin', like a larva thorn
I groan through this blood full night fallin' from my eyes
You never saw how strongly loves a Crow while the sun was low... 
I hold you close...This passion of beast is a charmin' mournful thing
Night has fallen in deepest forest's shine. It was a time when we fell down
Meetin' you made my life so brave. When I joined you into your grave
I still call and long for you tonight...through the mirror's light
You never tried lyin' by my side
You never know how strongly loves a Crow
I hold you close my howlin' flow, ever...
I try to play my best cadence of sounds with melodies
I hope to heal your heart...
Never will you lose. Never will you clang my farewell
Standin' I cry waitin' for my...bloody bites,
Never will you lose...never will you try...
