Thereâs no sacred place
Where youâll be free from danger
Thereâs no special, safe space where you can escape
And thereâs no secret land where you can hide your soul

For all those senseless and endless evil crimes
For that red, blameless blood you caused to flow
You have slaughtered purity and innocents with your inquisitions
With all your crusades

Healers, witches, black cats, pagans and herectics
Youâve killed them in the name of your god

Itâs time to face the truth

Now, itâs time for revenge

Coniurant furiae crinitaque sontibus
Hydris tesiphone quatien infausto lumine pinum
Armato ad cartra vocant pallentia Manes

Tisifone
Megera
Aletto
