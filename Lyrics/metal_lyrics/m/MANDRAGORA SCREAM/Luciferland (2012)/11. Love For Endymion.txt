You wanna be my life
You wanna become my dreamfire
You wanna be my slave
You wanna be now crucified
This time
Tonight
An ephemeral embrace

Cry!
Here in my arms tonight
Youâre gonna lie
Here in my arms tonight
Do you wanna lay or do you wanna fight?
Do you wanna love or do you wanna die?

You are slave of love
Infernal wishes of dawn
Are shiverinâ in agony
And your desireâs becominâ flame
In your veins
Burninâ in eternity

Youâve gotta be all mine
Sufferinâ this torment of
Hell, love me forever in the dark
Ohâ¦ My âembraceâ
Becominâ flame in your veins
Nurninâ in eternity
