I picked you up on a breezy day
Like a golden daffodil
While you were dancing alone, sweet princess of my dawns
I gazed and gazed at your charming face

On the wave of pleasure and pain
I fell in love, a new Eros slave
Wounded by his dart of flame

Then I abducted your soul
Down into my reign
From where no one can escape
I took your innocence away
And in return I gave you the deadly crown
Oh the deadly crown
To become the dark queen of my world

Deep inside my eyes youâll see all my love
A light among the shades of the night
Yet you feel alone without your motherâs embrace

Now Iâll never let you go
And youâll be all mine
Yeah, with these six grains of pomegranate

Then I abducted your soul
Down into my reign
From where no one can escape
I took your innocence away
And in return I gave you the deadly crown
Oh the deadly crown
For the mighty queen of lost souls

Donât be scared if dreams are fading away
Life is a lie, a sad cursed place

Where everything is erased

And Iâve got to take your soul
Down into my world
And Iâll never let you go

Lost between pleasure and pain
And in return I gave you the deadly crown
Oh the deadly crown
To become the dark queen of my world
