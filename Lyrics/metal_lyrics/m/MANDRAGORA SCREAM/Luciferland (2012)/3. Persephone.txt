Deep inside, itâs your dark side
Donât let it lay and donât cry
Noises and sighs, are still alive
From the oracles of time
Deep inside

This time a secret flame
Without a shame
Can kill the illusory creed
Come baby! Run again

My obscure shade is made of lust
And now I claim my bloody tales
Dubious child
Come through the âdark sideâ
Of this unendinâ flow of time

Come to me

Come to the lord of shade
Say youâll be mine
Say you would die for me
Youâll never be a slave

Itâs a night grace
And ancient blaze
That can save your soul from pain

Run to the lord of shade
Say youâll be mine
Say you would die for me
Youâll never be a salve
