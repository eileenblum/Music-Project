Every night
Holding your heart I close my eyes
My night glow across your river cries
The best thing
Every night
Is dead of night

Heavenward I'm staring [???] you
You search for my hands
In this night life
You won't be alone

Love me
And never think to save me
Now or never surreder to this fallen angel's love
Just to fight
Just to fight for glory
And no regrets for sins
You'll never close your eyes
Murmuring my name

This paradise for loving
And everything is dark
You'll never see the daylight
Falling in my arms

Every night
Black icy roses are crashing down
Sweet drops bleeding on skin
As ghostly tears [???]
Until they die
And there's no rest
For servant of this hell
You down (?) your blood
Living your desires
You are the one that can satisfy my thirst

Love me
And never think to save me
Now or never surreder to this fallen angel's love
Just to fight
Just to fight for glory
And no regrets for sins
You'll never close your eyes
Murmuring my name

This paradise for loving
And everything is dark
You'll never see the daylight
Falling in my arms

Love me
And never think to save me
Now or never surreder to this fallen angel's love
Just to fight
Just to fight
Just to fight
