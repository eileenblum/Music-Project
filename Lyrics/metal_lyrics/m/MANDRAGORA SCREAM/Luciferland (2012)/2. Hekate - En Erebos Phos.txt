Dark light
Your dark light is my guide now through the night
I'm lost without you
Guided by my faith
I'm calling you darling
Through this door of hell
Enodia

Dark light
Can you hear me
Love will tear us apart

Wishing to live by your dark side again
Begging you for your fire flames
Searching for this darkest smell of rain

I'm calling your might
[???]
Your never ending
Your [???] flight
Begging your light to be by my side

Light your torch tonight
Light your torch for me tonight
Burning fires between heaven and hell
I'm calling you darling
Through this ancient faith
Enodia

Waiting for you
For your mercy and grace tonight
Waiting to fight
Calling you, begging you for your fire flames
Hekate, hekate, hekate

Bloody lips
Ruby flames to the moonlight
Deadly shade in your obsidian vein
I found your crocus-scented way
Hekate, hekate, hekate

En erebos, phos
Hekate

Dark light
Can you hear me
Love will tear us apart
Wishing to live by your dark side again
Begging you for your fire flames
Searching for this darkest smell of rain
Bloody lips
Ruby flames to the moonlight
Deadly shade in your obsidian vein
I found your crocus-scented way
Hekate, hekate, hekate

Waiting for you
