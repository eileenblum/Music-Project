It comes a time when the real race
Closes the doors to the deepest rage
The only way to fightâ¦ search for key of light

Here knowledge is revealed
Along the emerald path unseen
Here bounds by fateâ¦ searching for your lord

Câmonâ¦
Iâm gonna hide you

Câmonâ¦
Edomâs ruling
Just screaming aloud!
Hail hail, fight fight

Stay with me all the days of my lives
Guide me lord each day and night
Embraced am I in love and dark magic

In this journey across the night
Let me flow inside your mind
Look through your eyes

And walk to your lord
