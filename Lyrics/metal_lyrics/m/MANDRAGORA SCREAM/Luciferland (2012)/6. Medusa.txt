If you look at me with pure eyes
Youâll be loved and not petrified
Itâs a frozen rage
You should now explore
To behold the night of Medusaâs eyes

In the mirrorâs land
Now Iâm the dark
Where the light escapes my sight
Iâm the hidden truths behind the sun
Iâm the sword that tears
Your illusions

An ivy maid
A dream girl
Or a frightening spell,
In this yore
Where the mist veils the moonlight
You can see my serpent
Haired, fearfull monster
Rapinâ again all your dreams

Gaze at my eyes
The love youâve never found
Gaze at my eyes
In my charm you will be bound
Gazinâ me, watching me,
Take your chance on sex tonight
Gaze at my eyes
Our love will find a way

Iâm the wind that blows
Running wild through the woods
Frozen rage you should now follow
With my eerie eyes Iâll petrify you
And I wonât efface my traces

Like a wolf I will divorced your flesh
Like a raven Iâll bite your spirit
And this is my yell-storm,
This is my curse
Call me ivy of desires

Gaze at my eyes
Medusa is my name

Gaze at my eyes
Iâm your mercy and your revenge
Gazinâ me, watching me
Iâll give pleasure lost in pain
Gaze at my eyes
Medusa is my name
