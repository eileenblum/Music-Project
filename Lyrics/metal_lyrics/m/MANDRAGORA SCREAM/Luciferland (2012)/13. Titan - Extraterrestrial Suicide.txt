Titan, oh Titan

Floatinâ in space
Breathless Iâm reaching you
My black sun
Bleedinâ heart of methane
Empty veins

Like a lake, full of tears
All my hopes for my absolution
With your grace, touch my lips
Feel my death kiss

Let me die, slake my thirst
Let this poison flowing in me
Dawn is gone, death as come
Now itâs time to die

Titan, oh Titan

Here itâs gloom
Methane, greenish snowflakes
Cage of doom
Are still ablazing and waitinâ
My absolution

Dawn is gone
I will rise hereâ¦ As a moon of Titan
