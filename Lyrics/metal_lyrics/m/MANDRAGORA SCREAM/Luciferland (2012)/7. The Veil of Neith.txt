What is the meaning of our lives if we die?

Tonight I walk fast through space and time
âCause your call burns like desire in my mind
For you want me to rise above mankind

Draw aside your veil
And show your grace
Now you own my life

I melt with you
Reborn from you
Please reweave my soul

Tonight in the gloomy streets of Sais
On the eve of your supreme sacrifice
I breath mysterious scents from your rites

Unveil your eyes
Immortal night
Now you own my life

I melt with you
Reborn from you
Please reweave my soul

Now you own my life, life
