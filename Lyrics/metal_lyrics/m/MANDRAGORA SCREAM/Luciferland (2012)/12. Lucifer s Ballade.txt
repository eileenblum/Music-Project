Baby touch my bloody tales
Live your fears away
Youâll see this, Iâm this you can believe at all

Now itâs time, time to realize your life
Blood is light in my Lucifer eyes
Nights of burning pyres
Youâll dance around my tales
Fallinâ in a land that is so far away

In this night Ill love you and love again
Live you creed alone
My eternal lifeâ¦ Iâm here
This virgin love of time made of 
Embraces my Lucifer arms
And tell me baby

Baby lick my deadly skin
And touch my ghostly soul
Now kiss me &amp; bring me 
The life youâre waiting for
