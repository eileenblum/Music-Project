It's time to pray inside your heart
It's time to pray

You seeing inside of me
But it's a wildcat for you (don't try)
I'm the Illusionist of minds like the blind you became
You are profane

It's time to pray inside your heart
Tonight you'll pay for the blunders (?) apart
It's time to pray

Your human blood is warm
And your prologue is decayed
On this dead clock on the wall
You would've lost all
You are profane

It's time to pray inside your heart
Tonight you'll pay for the blunders (?) apart
It's time to pray

Try
To declare all of your lies
'Till you're relieved
Your time is running out
Your profetism is in vain
I don't believe in fairy tales
And you decline your mind (?)
Your life is going away
From your vanished faith

It's time to pray inside your heart
We are so close, it's time to die
It's time to pray inside your heart
Tonight you'll pay for the (?) apart
It's time to pray inside your heart
It's time to pray
It's time to pray inside your heart
It's time to pray
