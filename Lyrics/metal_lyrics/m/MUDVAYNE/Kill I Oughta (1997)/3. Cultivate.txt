What you dreed,  can't let go!
Dah!
Dah!

Got the disease in my mind that chaos runs through in you
Guilty toys for your insides
Just plead and i'll conduct you

Believe in me, i'm the juice recieve from me
The hand of truth in still your trust
I'll take you there
Penetrate and run, run through

Feel it so warm
Branded forearm
Synthetic high to drain you
Accelerated poles, blood rush through

Branded forearm
MuDvAyNe returned
Inner mutiny, lost tranquility

Broken people fixed again plumbing christened with disorder
You took a pill that was in the drain
Took a spell to possess you, why?

You embrace me for the high
Unfocused black swells as you die
Inner silence solicits sympathy
Departed being struggles so desperatly

I'm so outside myself
Breathless body betrays my cry for help

Lifeless i lie, lifeless and so passified
Rest in earth, rest in peace
Await rebirth as i roll up my sleeves

Roll up my fuckin' sleeves

Feel it so warm
Branded forearm
Masticate you as i cultivate through

Your life I loathe
Motherfucker!

Scrambled being your impressions leaking
Sins been basoned in you
Do what I do just to see it through you
Your life is death now
Consequenses been plowed under earth

Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust
Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust
I said ashes to ahes, and dust to dust
Ashes to ashes, and dust to DUST

ASHES TO ASHES, AND DUST TO DUST
ASHES TO ASHES, AND DUST TO DUST
ASHES TO ASHES, AND DUST TO DUST
ASHES TO ASHES, AND DUST TO DUST

Want you dead so much!!!
