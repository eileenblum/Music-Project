Through my skin you climb, 
To my eyes
I say goodbye
Now that you're on the inside
Blinded eyes in front of you hide
Fucked with me
I was an idiot
You fucked with me
And i havent done shit 
All about everything that im against so fuck this i dont need your shit
Life is pain and pain is my life
Life is pain and pain is my life
In your mind I was just a novelty
So does this define how you feel towards me
Do unto me what has been done to
You feed off the pain thats been reproduced
Fucked with me
I was an idiot
Fucked with me
And i didnt do shit i fuckin hurt so bad now,
So i think i'll just lie down...
I don't need you i just need me
I don't believe in you, so dont believe in me
Pain pain go away, come again some other day
Pain pain go away,
Don't need this mother fuckin shit, now anyway
I don't need you i just need me
I don't believe in you, so dont believe in me
Life is pain and pain is my life 
I dont need you i just need me
I dont believe in you, dont believe in me
