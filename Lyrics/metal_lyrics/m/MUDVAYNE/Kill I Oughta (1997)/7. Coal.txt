My soul simply wont bleed
coal blackened walls surround my scene
hardened, callous ive been stung by bees
forfeited courage keeps me in need
and i need your soul in black, trust you rape and left me to see
my soul attacked it's innocence deaf and dumb
i cant hear the shit been preached to me 
losses i cound, you rip through from my mind
and take my thoughts from me
my mind, my space inside im lost replaced bliss with catastrophy
heaven sends to you the seed my mind recieves and accepts deceit 
my acceptence sometimes disturbing
my appearence shows no sympathy
me in this state of mind my balance off balance but i
push through this dark time i lay awake at night my body trembles
wrapped with vines
each tie that binds represents another
dream demise 
oh fuck i need a handle in my life
I know that there is no esacape for me
This sweating i dont mind 
Just fused with insanity
dark time i lay awake at night my body trembles
wrapped with vines 
each tie that binds represents another
dream demise 
oh fuck i need a handle in my life
in my life
my soul has been caught in the mix of your plague
hardened, callous ive been stung by bees
forfeited courage keeps me in need
My life is meaningless now is it you that i thank


Thanks to matiasley for correcting track #3 lyrics.
