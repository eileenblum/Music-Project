Holy god man
Well wont you lend me insight
To your counterfeited tyranny
Mouth fulls of christian view
Tthou hath to be blind
Ends so plain to me
Out of body and beside myself
Sold out ministry
Holy god man
Hows wealth and the brood
Mislayed mind i'm in
&gt;From deceit that you induce
Descend to knees of lust
His holiness been brought
Imperils rise distinguished lies
God fall
All rise
Behold the heaven sent an angel to deprive
Your law
All lies
God fall
Baptized in dust is your soul
Holy god man
Im losing patience with you
Your sacreligious spellsin mind
Confusion walks in front of you
Your miracles have deceased
Unpretnetious family's plead
Please heal our boy
Save our boy
All the false things your preach
Are all the fuckin things you've taken from me
What goes around comes back to you 7x
