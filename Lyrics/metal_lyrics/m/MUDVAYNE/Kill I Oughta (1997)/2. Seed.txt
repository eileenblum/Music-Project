Fall down
Cant pick myself up off the ground
Head down
I see catastrophy
And its right in front of me
Mother father please dont make me choose between you
I love both of you
Mother please, all i want to be is just little me
Father please, all i want to be is your son
No fair
Tresspass the tiny mind of a child
Despair
In my world surrounds me
Its immersed me
Rips right through me
Remember
The day they told me-im so scared
Suffer
My wounds not healing
Mother please, all i want to be is just little me
Father please, all i want to be is your son
Sometimes
In dark my mind will roam
To a time
Ispent alone as a child, as a small boy
Look at what you did to me 
See what you did to me
Look at what you did to me 
See what you did to me
I died that day
All i want to say 
Mother please, all i want to be is a little deep
inside of you
Father please, all i want to be is a little me back
inside of you
What now?
Fuck you!
What now?
Fuck you!
What now?
Fuck!
