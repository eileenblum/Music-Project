My perspective on life is pain
Sponge textured soul so porous i cant drain
I just absorb violations of the pledge
You swore to me your perjury
Detours the life of my child
Chicanery from you for me violates natural instincts in you
Dissolve does the sibling
Artificial sympathy You braid the noose you hang me in guilt your guilt
You blame me septen up the empathy 
Broken lover in your head
Mental material mother she left and dead
Glacial feeling inherited
Pathetic mode of principle
Now i see the industry where you belong is killing
My deception in life was you
You bring all the pain that im used to
Double vision is my view
Conditions that tear right through my mind pain...
In my head i harness
It keeps my faith frigid love..
In my body doesnt breathe hate..
dont know how much i fuckin hate you
Look what you've done to me 
You won't leave me alone 
Come back 
No no no
