Sticker this, censor this, ban this, we've got something to say!
Police this, condemn this, damn this- we'll be heard anyway!
Middle finger is the flag that I wave when I'm silenced!

Listen here.
Is it a possibility that we're all just equal? Slam the power down, abusing!
Does it piss you off to be beat at your own game?
You lead us with false morals and shelter reality!

No more... we're not buying your product when you're selling the words preaching silence!

Insult me in my home where you were never invited To live life off your curve, frustrating!
Throw sticks into the spokes to relieve insecurities.
Stifle all ascension and sticker our freedom of speech!
SO WRONG!

Sticker this, censor this, ban this, we've got something to say!
Police this, condemn this, damn this- we'll be heard anyway!
Middle finger is the flag that I wave when I'm silenced!
SILENCED!

Don't tell me what I want, don't tell me what I need.
Don't tell me how I need to feel, I feel GODDAMN NOTHING!
Dig the eyes out of my face, I can still see right fucking through you.
Fuck you and everything you are, I'm me, we're us, and that's all!
Closed mind with a forum to criticize, keep your policy and I've got mine.
Exploit me, fabricate your lies, we empower these cowards just to be left in silence!

Listen here:
Stand on my soapbox and speak my own peace. Whatever you may think, it's
REAL!
Prevail through what is me and step on your beliefs.
Thieving spineless sell-outs robbing our integrity!

BRING IT ON!

Sticker this, censor this, ban this, we've got something to say!
Police this, condemn this, damn this- we'll be heard anyway!
Middle finger is the flag that I wave when I'm...
