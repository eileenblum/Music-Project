No more doors, no more locks, no more windows, no more box.
No more, no less, no more six foot digs, no more hypocrites!

No more emptiness, no more consequence, no more puppet strings, no more disease.
No more growing up, no more happiness, no more lying down, no more complacence.

I have, I hold the key to nothing... it's a small killing.
Murder, murders in the hands of motion, as it seems to be.

No more nothing, no more anything, no more you, no more me.
No more posturing victories, no more nations to defeat, no more speaking truth, no more deceit.
No more holding down, no more pushing me, no more new world order, no more anarchy!

I have, I hold the key to nothing... it's a small killing.
Murder, murders in the hands of motion, as it seems to be.

I'm washing my hands of the whole thing.

I want no more nothing.

I have, I hold the key to nothing... it's a small killing.
Murder, murders in the hands of motion, as it seems to be.
I'm washing my hands of everything, of everything we are.
