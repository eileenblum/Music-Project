We've come here from so far away, I can save you if you leave it all behind.
This suffering's been far too long, would you take a trip with me on the back of a star?
I feel like earth's gravity is just here to pull us down!

Mother of creation, wait! Embrace the souls of the lost world, carry them away.
Darkness, negative, receptive. Pour firmament between our waters, separate the space.
Mother of destruction, wait! With a belt of skulls, strap me down and send the ship away!
Progress with the process! Mine the souls from their casts, pour, form, and reshape!

This dark womb wraps and covets me, redefining, understanding if you open up the heart.
Nurturing this phenomenon. We can carry on our wings, our wings through the dark.
Lightning flashes of insight into the mirth of a dark sky...
Pain of division is nothing, joy of disillusion is everything!

Mother of creation, wait! Embrace the souls of the lost world, carry them away.
Darkness, negative, receptive. Pour firmament between our waters, separate the space.
Mother of destruction, wait! With a belt of skulls, strap me down and send the ship away!
Progress with the process! Mine the souls from their casts, pour, form, and reshape!

Portal sits deep within the eye!
The eye of Yin's severity, rewards understanding.
Portal sits deep within the eye!
The eye of Yin's severity, rewards understanding.

Blackness consumes body comforts core of nothing. [2X]
Mother, I can remember a vault of security.
Can you take me away, would you take me away, won't you take me away, AWAY!

Mother of creation, wait! Embrace the souls of the lost world, carry them away.
Darkness, negative, receptive. Pour firmament between our waters, separate the space.
Mother of destruction, wait! With a belt of skulls, strap me down and send the ship away!
Progress with the process! Mine the souls from their casts, pour, form, and reshape!
