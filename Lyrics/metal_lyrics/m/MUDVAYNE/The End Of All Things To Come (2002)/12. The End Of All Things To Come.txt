All over with... fuck all the flags, the greed, the world leaders.
Run for the fence. We're coming, we're killing, we're changing the faces.
Believe in yourself! Let go of ego, strengthen within yourself.
All over with! We're coming, we're killing, we're changing the faces.

I'm killing every fucking thing
Until somebody gets the fucking point, the point I'm trying to make.
I lead the mice on parade down to the river of kool aid and open up the flood gates.
I need a barrel of cyanide; a pile of strychnine
Until the whole damned world is dead, start over again!

All over with... fuck all the flags, the greed, the world leaders.
Run for the fence. We're coming, we're killing, we're changing the faces.

Stop talking, negotiating...
Your feeble attempts towards world peace, give me a fucking break.
Need world-wide genocide, planetary suicide!
And when the whole damn world is dead, there's your fucking peace!

All over with... fuck all the flags, the greed, the world leaders.
Run for the fence. We're coming, we're killing, we're changing the faces.
Believe in yourself! Let go of ego, strengthen within yourself.
All over with! We're coming, we're killing, we're changing the faces.

Oxygen wasters, come on!

We've come to save you... to save you from yourselves.
Kill or be killed.

All over with... fuck all the flags, the greed, the world leaders.
Run for the fence. We're coming, we're killing, we're changing the faces.
Believe in yourself! Let go of ego, strengthen within yourself.
All over with! We're coming, we're killing, we're changing the faces.
