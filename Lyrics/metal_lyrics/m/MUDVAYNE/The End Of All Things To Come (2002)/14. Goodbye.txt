[Special Edition DVD]

Pendulum stops and falls away
Life sifted through like sand
Storms of summer rain
Flooding lifelines in our hands
Our skin of blood and bone
Gently close to dust and blows
Our home of blood and bone
Pulls through the ground and so....
Unstoppable
These feelings of loss
So unstoppable
Egging through to the marrow of bones
Just let it go
Pain willing in your eyes
Just let me go
Dry the tears that fall

And remember
When everything is typical
I'll be the wish upon a star
I've found a place so magical
Goodbye....

See you another goodbye
I... See you another goodbye
See you another goodbye
See you another...

Peeling killers rise
Precious circle is mended
Sense vertigo in you
So I'll be your halo
So unstoppable
My love for you
So unstoppable
Memories of you

Just remember
When everything is typical
I'll be the wish upon a star
I've found a place so magical
But still please...

Someone, Help Me, Grab Me, Save Me Now,
Distrust, Darkened, Daylight, I've lost sight
Someone, Help Me, Grab Me, Save Me Now,
Distrust, Darkened, Daylight, I've lost sight

Remember
That nothing here is typical
I'll be the wish upon a star
I've lost something so magical
And gone so far
Just remember
When everything seems difficult
I'll be shining from a far
When it feels like things have gone away
I'll see you again

I'll see you again, Goodbye
I'll see you again, Goodbye
I'll see you again, Goodbye
I'll see you again, Goodbye
I'll see you again, Goodbye....
