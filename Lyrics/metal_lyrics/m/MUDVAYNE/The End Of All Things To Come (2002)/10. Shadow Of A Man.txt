Mirror, mirror, upon the wall... I'm asking you
Who is the most confused of them all?
Mirror, mirror, subservient twin screams back at me "you."
You sick flawless mime, I want to break you. Yeah, you're a clever one...

Do you reflect me, or do I reflect you, are you inside of another world?
I want to break through... yeah, you're a clever one.

Is this a tool, can I step through?
To find another plane or just a shadow of a man?
A superficial tool to support the vanity of weak...
When you don't love yourself.

If life's as painful on your side,
I'll break your existence and cut through mine.
You're a clever one.

Are you a tool, can I step through?
To find another plane or just a shadow of a man?
Are you my brother? You look like me trapped inside another world.
My lost twin... just a superficial tool, to support the vanity of weak
When you don't love yourself.

Mirror upon the wall, am I the reflection of you?
Mirror upon the wall, are you staring back through?
Understanding has no place within my world on your side.

Are you a tool, can I step through?
To find another plane or just a shadow of a man?
Are you my brother? You look like me trapped inside another world.
My lost twin... just a superficial tool, to support the vanity of weak
When you don't love yourself.
