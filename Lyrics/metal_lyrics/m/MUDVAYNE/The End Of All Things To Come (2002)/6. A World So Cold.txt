When passion's lost, and all the trust is gone, way too far for way too long.
Children crying, cast out and neglected... only in a world so cold, only in a world this cold.

Hold the hand of your best friend, look into their eyes, then watch them drift away.
Some might say we've done the wrong things for way too long, for way too long...

Fever inside the storm, so I'm turning away. Away from the name (calling your names)
Away from the stones (throw sticks and stones) Cause I'm through mending the wounds of us.
Keep your thorns, cause I'm running away. Away from the games (fucking head games)
Away from the space (hate this head space) The circumstances of a world so cold...

Burning whispers remind me of the days. I was left alone in a world this cold.
Guilty of the same things, provoked by the cause. I'm left alone in a world so cold!

Fever inside the storm, so I'm turning away. Away from the name (calling your names)
Away from the stones (throw sticks and stones) Cause I'm through mending the wounds of us.
Keep your thorns, cause I'm running away. Away from the games (fucking head games)
Away from the space (hate this head space) The circumstances of a world so cold...

I'm flying, I'm flying away! Away from the names (calling your names)
Away from the games (fucking head games) The circumstances of a world so
COLD!

Why does everyone feel like my enemy, don't want any part of depression or darkness.
I've had enough, sick and tired, bring the sun or I'm gone... OR I'M GONE!

I'm backing out, I'm no pawn, no motherfucking slave to this -
Never lied, never left, never lived, never loved.
Never lost, never hurt, never worry about being me or anyone else.
Not a care, no concern. Don't give a shit about anything!

Backing out, giving up, no motherfucking slave to this.
Never lied, never left, never lived, never loved.
Never lost, never hurt, never worry about being me or anyone else.
Not a care, no concern. Don't give a shit about anything!

I need to find a darkened corner, a lightless corner where it's safe and calmer.
I'm turning away. Away from the name (calling your names)
Away from the stones (throw sticks and stones) Cause I'm through mending the wounds of us.
I'm running away. Away from the games (fucking head games)
Away from the space (hate this head space) The circumstances of a world so cold.

I'm flying, I'm flying away! Away from the names (calling your names)
Away from the games (fucking head games) The circumstances of a world so
COLD!
