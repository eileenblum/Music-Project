Always known in all my time, a little left of center now.
Reflect as I realize
That all I need is to find the middle pillar path
And sit like a star in the sky and just be.
Sinners casting stones at me!

I, I stand not crawling, not falling down!
I, I bleed. The demons that drag me down!
I, I stand (for nothing) not crawling (the center), not falling down (of calms within the eye)!
I, I'll bleed (for no one). The demons (but myself) that pull me down (for me and no one else).

Goodbye, sunshine. I've put it out again, sad!
I'm over. Personalities conflicting.
I don't need you or anyone but me.
I'll just be living my own life.
I feel my glowing center grow.
Infecting, I feel alive
And shovel dirt over lime and plant it in myself like a seed under covers of earth and just be.
Sinners point your fingers at me!

I, I stand not crawling, not fallings down!
I, I bleed. The demons that drag me down!
I, I stand (for nothing) not crawling (the center), not falling down (of calms within the eye)!
I, I'll bleed (for no one)! The demons (but myself) that pull me down (for me and no one else).

Come play kill. Refuse my body, refuse my shadow!
Stone-cold will. Refuse to lead this, refuse to follow!
Bitter pills. Refuse to feed this, refuse to swallow.
I'm fueled godless!
Come play, come play kill.
Just be.

I, I stand not crawling, not fallings down!
I, I bleed. The demons that drag me down!
I, I stand (for nothing) not crawling (the center), not falling down (of calms within the eye)!
I, I'll bleed (for no one)! The demons (but myself) that pull me down (for me and no one else).
