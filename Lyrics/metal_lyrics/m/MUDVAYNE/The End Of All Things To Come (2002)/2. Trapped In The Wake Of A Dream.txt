Do I deserve these beatings? Hating me, well then cut. Cut the noose and let me fall away.
I'm growing weak and tired of you, and your little shoving games,
Fucking pushing me.
You pulled the trigger, trapped in the wake of your...

DREAM! You're all killers! Always fucking pushing me, insulting me, I'm overcome
I have found the strength of gods in me. Crushing, all unwilling, this is so unstoppable.
Hard as nails, hook that holds, reach down and find the strength of many in you.

DREAM! You're all killers! Always fucking pushing me, insulting me, I'm overcome
I have found the strength of gods in me. Crushing, all unwilling, this is so unstoppable.
Hard as nails, hook that holds, reach down and find the strength of many in you.

Call it, call it a truce, I'm believing in it more and more.

Awake and dreaming, forgotten past... future becomes MINE!

Throw the chains all away, take control of your life.
Powers known, this is my...
Throw the chains all away, take control of your life.
Powers known, THIS IS MY...

DREAM! You're all killers! Always fucking pushing me, insulting me, I'm overcome
I have found the strength of gods in me. Crushing, all unwilling, this is so unstoppable.
Hard as nails, hook that holds, reach down and find the strength of many in you.
