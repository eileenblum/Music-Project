This puzzle's dead inside, missing pieces growing eyes, mystery.
Little girls severity, little boys begging mercy.
Sticks break at me, cost of life at 23.
Price of pain - a golden ring, all crimson.
Melting body, rubber world; battle axe with locks of curls, INTROVERTED.

My cost, the price of a broken doll, can you remember that place?
That place you would go to make things okay...

1000 points for insect stings, glue my spirit, break my wings, misery.
Libido steams, infectious whore... cauterize and forge the sword.
REMEMBER KILLING!

Children learning the secret knock,
A nickel to enter that place, that place you would go to make things okay.
My cost, the price of a broken doll, can you remember that place?
That place you would go to take pain away...

Games of passion taste so sweet, cut his throat and slaughter meat, my secrets.
Seven heads for seven seas, darkened voices plead disease, dismembering me.

Children wrestle to seal the bag, storing it deep in that place.
That place you would go to try to escape.
Children learning the secret knock,
A nickel to enter that place, that place you would go to make things okay.
My cost, the price of a broken doll, can you remember that place?
That place you would go to take pain away...

Skrying through reflections in a pool, I see death coming, mowing down.
Do you remember the bedroom, was it your cell or was it your tomb?
[Repeat, screamed.]

You're living through my hell. [2X]

Children learning the secret knock,
A nickel to enter that place, that place you would go to make things okay.
My cost, the price of a broken doll, can you remember that place?
That place you would go to take pain away...
