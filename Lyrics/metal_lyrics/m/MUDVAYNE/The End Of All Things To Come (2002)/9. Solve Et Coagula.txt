Fire, fire. I dissolve and solidify, destroy to recreate.
Disassemble to assemble something pure.
Our rubric sol-ve-et-co-ag-u-la...
Kill to be born again, cycled a thousand times.

Fire, planetary alchemy, fire, the time is here now.
Fire, four corners to rise... fire, rise!
Fire, there's always loss within, fire, the cleansing, it's time.
Fire, shooting arrows to the sky... fire!

I construct a new institution, not out of bricks, iron, cement, concrete, or steel.
Our rubric sol-ve-et-co-ag-u-la...
Distill to purify, we've done it a thousand times.

Fire, planetary alchemy, fire, the time is here now.
Fire, four corners to rise... fire, rise!
Fire, there's always loss within, fire, the cleansing, it's time.
Fire, shooting arrows to the sky... fire!

Burn, bleed all the lives of life, ascend to the sky.
Burn all the martyrs!

Fire, planetary alchemy, fire, the time is here now.
Fire, four corners to rise... fire, rise!
Fire, there's always loss within, fire, the cleansing, it's time.
Fire, shooting arrows to the sky... fire!
