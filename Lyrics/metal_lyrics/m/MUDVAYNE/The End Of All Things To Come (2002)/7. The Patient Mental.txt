Patient, just as I am, as always.
Watch the time go by, nothing left to pass by.
The minutes follow me, drunken little people work away in me.

Why won't they leave me, leave me alone?
When I don't even want me, want me.

I have to kill the words before they form my sentence.
The sentence that is me, judged by those that carry.
The patient sits in cradled arms that comfort me by strangling.

Why won't they leave me, leave me alone?
When I don't even want me, want me.

The patient mental sits and stares,
An idle mind that's empty, screaming, staring back.
Why won't they leave him, leave him alone?
A passive speared ritual, driven by our war ship... the hate-driven enemy.

They have to kill the meal before they can consume.
Consume my inner peace without the understanding.
Trapped inside the works, the hands are moving me.

The patient mental sits and stares,
An idle mind that's empty, screaming, staring back.
Why won't they leave him, leave him alone?
A passive speared ritual, driven by our war ship... the hate-driven enemy.

Release me, let me go, why do they observe me?
There's nothing here to cure.
I can see the silhouettes that sit behind the mirror.
I'm just like a clock upon the wall - always moving, but never going anywhere.

The patient mental sits and stares,
An idle mind that's empty, screaming, staring back.
Why won't they leave him, leave him alone?
A passive speared ritual, driven by our war ship... the hate-driven enemy.
