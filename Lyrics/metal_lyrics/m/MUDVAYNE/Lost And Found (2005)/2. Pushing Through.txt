Rip the womb
Feeling so sorry
Selfish and sore
WISH I WASN'T BORN
Piece by piece I can carry it all
Strength to be driven
So unforgiving anything is possible
Like leaving you all
I'm turning my back on this killing so small

Step by step I'm pushing through this
(All of you get away from me)
Eye for an eye I'm pushing through this
My law
Step by step I'm pushing through this
(All of you get away from me)
Tooth for a tooth I'm pushing through this
Through you

Salt the wound
Cut through a conscience I've failed to explore
The calm before the storm
Speak your peace and prepare for the fall
Words have been chosen
Tainting the gift
Lying truth's so incredible
So fuck you all
I'm turning my back on this killing so small

Step by step I'm pushing through this
(All of you get away from me)
Eye for an eye I'm pushing through this
My law
Step by step I'm pushing through this
(All of you get away from me)
Tooth for a tooth I'm pushing through this
Through you

Spread the word
The killing is over
Spread the word
The killing is over

Severed, more than I am, more than I ever was,
Blindside, threatened, my worth, sequestered
Deliverance
You stoned a part of me
You've taken a part of me

Try
You wanted to be
Wanted to have a life
You wanted to fight
Wanted the right...Your lies
Spoken to me without a conscious
No right
Why
Breaking a mold
Breaking the trust
A child
Innocent lost
Ultimate cost
The loss
Life so undone
Deserted the seed
You've buried the bottle

Step by step I'm pushing through this
(All of you get away from me)
Eye for an eye I'm pushing through this
My law
Step by step I'm pushing through this
(All of you get away from me)
Tooth for a tooth I'm pushing through this
Through you

Step by step I'm pushing through
Eye for an eye I'm pushing through
Tooth for a tooth I'm pushing through

Pushing through
Pushing through
Pushing through
Pushing through
Pushing
Pushing
Pushing
Pushing through
