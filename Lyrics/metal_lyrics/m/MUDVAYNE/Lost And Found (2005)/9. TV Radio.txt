You incomplete me
You tune me into
Whitewash
Spoon fed
Brain dead
Sloth

I'd watch the paint dry before giving in
Black out
Stupor
Inferior
Insignifigant

False stars above keep us sedated
Satellite
Astronaut
Spaceship
The Government

I'm overdosing on reality
Don't stop the feed
No don't touch the feed

I don't wanna wanna be
Wanna wanna be
I don't want to be here
Wanna wanna be here so let's go

Turn off the radio
Turn off the TV
I don't wanna be
Wanna wanna be
I don't want to be here so let's go

Turn off the radio
Turn off the TV
Eliminate me you turn me into
Lifeless
Cliche'

Thoughtless
Unbelievable
So bored with my life
Entertained me with normal
Usual
Average
It's so typical

Artists traded in for the talentless
Spoiled kid
Wife swap
Tycoon
The has-beens

So entertaining it makes me sick
Don't stop the feed
Don't
No don't touch the feed

I don't wanna wanna be
Wanna wanna be
I don't want to be here
Wanna wanna be here so let's go

Turn off the radio
Turn off the TV
I don't wanna wanna be
Wanna wanna be
I don't want to be here
Wanna wanna be here so let's go
Turn off the radio
Turn off the TV

I'm so uninterested
So unamused
Dissapointed in yourself
To be so consumed
I'm so uninterested
So unamused
Dissapointed in yourself
To be so consumed

Buy nothing
Nothing
Buy nothing
Nothing

I don't wanna wanna be
Wanna wanna be
I don't want to be here
Wanna wanna be here so let's go
Turn off the radio
Turn off the TV

I don't wanna wanna be
Wanna wanna be
I don't want to be here
Wanna wanna be here so let's go
Turn off the radio
Turn off the TV

I don't wanna wanna be
Wanna wanna be
I don't want to be here
Wanna wanna be here so let's go
Turn off the radio
Turn off the TV

I don't wanna wanna be
Wanna wanna be
I don't want to be here
Wanna wanna be here so let's go
Turn off the radio
Turn off the TV
