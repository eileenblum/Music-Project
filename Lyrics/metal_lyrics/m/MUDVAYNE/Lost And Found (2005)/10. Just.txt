Just a few seconds away from everyone
From everything
Just a few seconds away
A second of your time and an inch of my own space

Silence
Quiet
Need a little peace of mind
After all this
After all that you do

Shut it up
Zip it
I need a little time to think
Without all this
Without all that you do

Keep it
Don't want it
Think I'll just go away
Away from here
From you

Time out
Walk it off
Think I need to throw a flag
Just a little break from the games that you play

Just a few seconds away from everyone
From everything
Just a few seconds away
All I want from all of you
Just a few seconds away
Away from this
It's neverending
Just a few seconds away
A second of your time and an inch of my own space

Beat it up
Whip it out
Top it with a little scream
All that you are
For all that you do

Crush it all
Kill it
Calling out my enemy
Don't want anything
I want nothing from you

Dry it up
Baby
Turn around and walk away
Cry your tears
Pussy

Lift it up
Destroy it
Build it up to tear it down
All the little things that make me run away

Just a few seconds away from everyone
From everything
Just a few seconds away
All I want from all of you
Just a few seconds away
Away from this
It's neverending
Just a few seconds away
Just a second of your time and an inch of my own space

Stop talking
Stop bothering me
Just walk away
I've had enough today

I have a life too
I've had enough of you
Feel like screaming
So go the fuck away

Go away
Go away
Go away
Go away

Just a few seconds away from everyone
From everything
Just a few seconds away
All I want from all of you
Just a few seconds away
Away from this
It's neverending
Just a few seconds away
A second of your time and an inch of my own space
