So far
Left with nothing
Hanging by a memory
No stars
To give me one wish
So lost in the dark
Feels like I'm caving in from the outside
All right
All wrong
See you again
So long
Nothing matters anymore at all
Nothing matters anymore

Life's not meant to be disposable
Lost. Found. Dead.
Ready and willing
Can't stop the bleeding
Life's not meant to be expendable
Rain. Sun. Gone.
Left robbed unwilling
Can't fight the feeling

So low
Overwhelming
Clinging to a tragedy
So clear
Hear weeping voices
Tears fall in the dark
Feels like I'm carving in from the outside
So lost. So gone. So wrong.

Life's not meant to be disposable
Lost. Found. Dead.
Ready and willing
Can't stop the bleeding
Life's not meant to be expendable
Rain. Sun. Gone.
Left robbed unwilling
Can't fight the feeling

It's never ending
Never goes away
But you did
It's never ending
Never goes away
But you did...
Why
The body's just a vehicle to hold
Until we find another space
Find another place
To start this over
The enemy
The action I can't condone
Do you suffer with me
Can I give you my loss
To feel
To hold close
Can I give you my pain
To feel
To be eaten alive by
Conscience
Suffer
Fucking suffer
Suffer like me

Life's not meant to be disposable
Lost. Found. Dead.
Ready and willing
Can't stop the bleeding
Life's not meant to be expendable
Rain. Sun. Gone.
Left robbed unwilling
Can't fight the feeling
