My legs are weary
But I still walk
My hands are sore and broken
But I still clutch
My heart is jaded
But I still love
My cup is empty
But I still pour

All I ever wanted to be
All I ever needed to be
Was whatever you wanted me to
But you took that from me, yeah

[Chorus:]
I was never enough for you
I should have known
I should've known
I was never enough for you
Don't waste my time
Don't waste my

I've lost the feeling
But I still touch
I stopped believing
But I still trust

All I ever wanted to be
All I ever needed to be
Was whatever you wanted me to
But you took that from me, yeah

[Chorus]

All these questions, asking why?
I'll just close my eyes, my eyes
All these people, asking why?
I'll just wave goodbye, goodbye

Time, pushing forward
I'm sick and tired
Need a little shelter
Drag the glass across my eyes
Cut me open, cut me wide
Leave me for the winner
Just to the winner

[Chorus]

I was never enough for you
Just wasting time
Don't waste mine
