All work and no play makes me a dull boy...
All work and no play makes me a dull boy...
All work and no play makes me a dull boy...
ALL WORK AND NO PLAY MAKES ME A DULL BOY!

Live in a secret
Live in a lie
Live in a dark hole beneath the black sky
Live like a martyr and draw my last breath
Feel like an old man with a knife in my chest

Live like a transient
Live like a thief
Hide in a closet, grinding my teeth
Sit in a small room with the walls closing in
Open the shutters but everything's still dim

Payback
For all the things
I've done in my past

Payback
For everything
There are no take backs

[Chorus]

I'm not the reason
It's not my fault
It's not my problem
I'm not the cause

I'm not your scapegoat
I'm not your god
I'm not your martyr
I'd leave you all

I'm not the reason - (I'm not your scapegoat)
It's not my fault - (I'm not your god)
It's not my problem - (I'm not your martyr)
I'm not the cause - (I'd leave you all)

All work and no play makes me a dull boy
Feel like a clown without my funny nose
Walk to the window break it out with my fist
Jump from the sill and I'll plunge to my death

You can be selfish whatever ya think
Throw back my pills and take a sip of my drink
Walk under the clouds
Walk under the trees
Always again envy covering me

Payback
For all the things
I've done in my past

[Chorus]

Sunshine's gone
It's all gone

By the way, just so you know
Always, this is how I feel

By the way, just so you know
Always, everyday, this is how I feel

I'm not the reason
It's not my fault
It's not my problem
I'm not the cause

I'm not your scapegoat - (I'm not your scapegoat)
I'm not your god - (I'm not your god)
I'm not your martyr - (I'm not your martyr)
This is how I feel - (This is how I feel)

By the way, just so you know
Always, everyday, this is how I feel...
