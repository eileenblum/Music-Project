Lie!!!
I'm a fish out of water
(I'm a fish out of water)
Kill me and choke on the bones
(Kill me and choke on the bones)
Nothing seems to matter anymore
Gotta get back to the reason
Gotta get back to the hole

Someone throw me an anchor
I've gotta drown this disease
(I've gotta drown this disease)
No one seems to matter anymore
Gotta get back to the meaning
Gotta get back the score

Buy my soul so you can sell me!
I don't need this
I don't need you

Trust your lies!
Then you betray me!
I don't want this
I don't want you

Up the creek with no paddle
(Up the creek with no paddle)
Through the ears of a board
No one seems to care at all anymore
Gotta get back to the evening
Gotta make back something more

Let me tell you a secret
(Let me tell you a secret)
So you can tell it or leave
No one holds to their honesty anymore
Gotta get back to the stealing
Gotta get back from the whore

Buy my soul so you can sell me!
I don't need this
I don't need you
Trust your lies!
Then you betray me!
I don't want this
I don't want!
You...

I don't want you
Who do you wanna be?
The summit of integrity
On the bottom of the filth
The dark hollow me

All these falling angels
Skeletons of what they once were
Hanging in the closet for the world to see
And now they're fallen angels
Faced by demons on their judgment
Hanging from the gallows
For us all to see!!!

Nobody told me!
Nobody forewarned!
Nobody told me!
Nobody forewarned!

Buy! (Buy!!!)
My soul! (My soul!!!)
So you can sell me!

I don't need this
I don't need you
Trust! (Trust!!!)
Your lies! (Your lies!!!)
Then you betray me!
I don't want this!
I don't want you!
