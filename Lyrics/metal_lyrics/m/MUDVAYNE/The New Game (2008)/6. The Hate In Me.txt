Lend me your children to borrow
I just need to send them away
Long eyes and tears of sorrow
I promise I'll keep them safe
So sorry it didn't work out
You believe the liar in me
My god, my love, my life
My world, my loss, my rage

Agnostic, for the greater good
When the good things seem to be
Few and far between
Conscious, loss of conscience
Packed the body on ice
Just to keep it numb
Now feel it
Blame some things on the past
Threw away everything that I had
unraveling for the last time
Stepping out of my skin
(cast in armor)

The hate in me
Feeling so empty
The guilt I swallow
carve the line
Skin the face
Stare through me
we'll leave you hollow
HOLLOW

Assembly of the militant
Order through anarchy
Eradicate the power's law
Hope's a thing of the past
Hold the gun to your head
(The hammer falls)

The hate in me
Feeling so empty
The guilt I swallow
Carve the line
Skin the face
Stare through me
We'll leave you hollow
Hollow

Wounded, have a loss of feeling
So dead, my heart,
my life has been ruined
Lost in an instant
Saw red in my eyes

The hate in me
So consuming
The lives we swallow
To the front line
Mirror's engaged
Scope's on me
And leaves me hollow

Harvest Children

My god, my love, my life
My world, my loss, my grave
