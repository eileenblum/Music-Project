Hunger, inside me
That door is rising, to quench is to kill
Lusting, enemy
But you don't know me, stand against your will
To satisfy me, pick my victim
Spells his name (those poor little girls)
So charming, say all the right things
Just come with me (Let's go for a ride)

Trust me, believe me, don't be so deceiving
God help me, and save me, from my lust and beatings

Lest we play (lest we play)
A new game

The hunter, within me
That's always searching, thirst for the kill
Abducted, take away
Thirst for the patience, of a thousand men
Fuel my eyes, locked on target
The covert men (You never had a chance)
Don't be alarmed, want some candy
Just ride over here (now get inside)

Trust me, believe me, don't be so deceiving
God help me, restrain me, from my lust and beatings

Lest we play (lest we play)
A new...

I just wanna play (I just wanna play)
I just wanna play a game
A new game

You meant everything to me
But now your time has come
Another broken doll today
Now your time has come
You meant everything to me
But now your time has come
Another broken doll today
Now your time has come

(Come here... come here
want some candy? Let's take a ride
Let's take a ride...)

I just wanna play
I just wanna play a game
One that you never played before
One that you'll never play again I'm sure

I just wanna play
I just wanna play a game
One that you never played before
One that you'll never play again I'm sure

I just wanna play
I just wanna play a game
One that you never played before
One that you'll never play again I'm sure

I just wanna play
I just wanna play a game
One that you never played before
One that you'll never play again I'm sure

I just wanna play
I just wanna play a game
One that you never played before
One that you'll never play again I'm sure
