It's always just the same ol' thing (ol' thing)
It's always just the same ol' thing (ol' thing)
It's always just the same ol' thing (ol' thing)

I don't mind going hungry
It's the hate that you feed
I don't mind being broken
Lost my will to believe
I don't mind being left to waste to rot
Pull me down like a weed, so what?

So I just don't fit
Its who I wanna be
So I just don't care
Its who I wanna be
So I just don't Mind
It's who I wanna be
So I don't give a fuck
It's who I wanna be

I don't mind being tired
When I can't fucking sleep
I don't mind being shattered
living outside your dream
I don't mind being put to death and broke
Another day to me, so what?

Get it on (what?)
Stand up straight (so what?)
Face the front (what?)
Now listen up (so what?)

Same ol' problems
Same ol' days
Same ol' story
Same ol' game
Same ol' hustles
The same ol' way
Same ol' situation
Same ol' days

I don't mind beating on you
But it's come for me
I don't mind being followed
But you can see my disease
I don't mind being bullied and pushed down
Lost my eyes, skinned my knees, so what?

So I just don't fit
Its who I wanna be
So I just don't care
Its who I wanna be
So I just don't Mind
Its who I wanna be
So I don't give a fuck
It's who I wanna be

Get it on (what?)
Stand up straight (so what?)
Feed the front (what?)
Now listen up (so what?)

Same ol' problems
Same ol' days
Same ol' story
Same ol' game
Same ol' hustle
The same ol' way
Same ol' situation
Same ol' days

Always just the (same ol', same ol', same ol')
Always just the (same ol', same ol', same ol')
Always just the (same ol', same ol', same ol')

I'm just a puzzle missing all the pieces and
I don't care and I don't mind, but would you care at all?
Don't fit
Don't care
Don't mind
Don't give a fuck

In my face
In my way
In my business breaking me
All the time
Everyday
Every fucking second, get away

Same ol' problems
Same ol' days
Same ol' story
Same ol' game
Same ol' problems
Same ol' days
Same ol' story
Same ol' game
Same ol' hustle
The same ol' way
Same ol' situation
Same ol' days

what?
so what?
what?
so what?
what?
so what?
what?
so what?
