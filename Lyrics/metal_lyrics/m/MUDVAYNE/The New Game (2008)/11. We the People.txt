I thought we the people had a brain
I thought we the people had a say
Could've sworn I read it somewhere,
Might've seen it on a bumper sticker

I though we the people had a right
I guess we the people we're wrong
We the people are on
Let's go elect another god

The love they make
I don't give a damn anyway
Rules are made to break
Too big too mean too blind
The American dream
Or a bag of magic beans
You can fight on T.V.
Whatever you need

Send me your tired
Your poor and broken
Send me your life
So I can break you

We the people can have a plan
We the people can make a stand

Could've swore I read it somewhere
Might've seen it in the funny papers
Your money's made to take
Too cheap to steal, to rob
I could tell you had a dream
That busted at the seams
You can get it on the T.V
Whatever you need

Send me your tired
Your poor and broken
Send me your life
So I can break you
Give me your trust
Your faith and wishes
Give me your life
So I can own you
Control YOU!

Hope I sell out
Hope I sell out
Every day there's something new to try
Every day there's something new to buy
Every day there's a new American dream
Good luck in the land of opportunity

Send me your tired
Your poor and broken
Send me your life
So I can break you
Give me your trust
Your faith and wishes
Give me your life
So I can own you
