And we hide behind,
Lies, anger, Hate
They shoo love away,
Build shells of ourselves outside,
It shelters body from cold reigns of reality,

Come on, STEP OUT, of your rind,
Assemble strength, focus, and release..

And run to me you can never look back to the visions from the
past they fade and wilt in time,
You've got to just trust me to hold your hand through,
Then I turn and walk away,

Eclipse you,
Bleed you, strip you of your states of ain soph aur
Eclipse you,
I spit up on my plate, push everything away, from me

And we sever all ties,
It creates disruption midst circle of friends,
I become the sacrifice,
Spare your life and leave me to my misery,

GET OFF THE CROSS, and save yourself, RUN AWAY YOU'LL BE O.K.

Run now get away from me if I can get my grip
I'll pull you down into the hell I call my head, you'll never get away
I sit down in my ugly place and build walls out of fragments from my
past of all the people that I needed and loved that walked away,

You've got to just trust me to hold your hand through
Then I'll turn and walk away

I walk under clouds of gray,
Sphere of storms in my head,
I'm trapped again in endless rain

I divorce the thoughts of you in love with me,
I divorce your innocence and my guilt,
I divorce the lying sellout confidence,
I'm divorcing every mother fuckin' thing
I divorce the love bled meaningless,
I divorce the makeshift harmony,
I divorce the taunting acts of violence,
I divorce the pastime of jealousy,
I divorce control,
I divorce the faith,
I divorce the virtue,
I divorce the rain,
I divorce the excuse,
I divorce the greed,
I divorce the need,
I divorce iniquity in this mother fuckin' bullshit life,
Just want it all to go away,
Just want to run away to die, take it, myself, my life
Text book fucking mental, off me and pitch me in a hole
In this mother fucking bullshit life, in this fucking bullshit life

I'll always be your shadow,
And veil your eyes from states of ain soph aur,
I can't be the hero anymore,
I spit up on my plate and then I turn and walk away,
I spit up on my plate and I disrupt the family,
I spit up on my plate as I sever the entity,
And I feel your warm sun on my face
Separate.. Separate.. Separate.. SEPARATE!

Eclipse you
And bleed you strip you of your states of ain soph aur,
I need you
It's always been this way, I push it all away,
From me
