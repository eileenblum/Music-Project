We swallow the spit
Steal acceptance
Lend denial
Tellin' me that my life is free and boundless
And then I'm forced to stay between the lines
The construct death
To demolish life
Plant the seeds to harvest loss
Found that empty truth is full of lies

Lies
Lies
Lies
Lies

We're hoping for despair
Starvation's gluttony
Subtle chaotic peace
War divided unity
Pro life
Pro choice
Blinded insight
Left wing
Right wing

I am Everything
I am Nothing
I am Everything
I am Nothing
I am Everything
I am Nothing
I am Everything
I am Nothing

I am Everything
(i am nothing)
I am Everything
(i am nothing)

Stop fuckin' with me
I'm the accused (A human not a machine)
I'm not the enemy
You're so confused
No way you could enlighten me (A human not a machine)
No freedom trapped in slavery (A human not a machine)
Deceitful honesty
Motherfuckin' human
Not a machine (Not a machine)
Stop fuckin' with me
I'm the accused (A human not a machine)
I'm not the enemy
You're so confused
No way you could enlighten me (A human not a machine)
No freedom trapped in slavery (A human not a machine)
Deceitful honesty
Motherfuckin' human (Not a machine)
Not a machine

Lay your hands upon me
In search for answers inviting
Constant struggle inside me
Guide me through
this everything that's nothing
It's all right to be afraid
They suffocate a time for us to change
Build palettes full of blacks and grays to shade our faces
They shape our lives and disturb your space
Your hopes ran out upon that day
They played my life like it was some kind of fuckin' game
A bunch of bigots
They have no room to receive the blame
So now I guess I'll be the one to improve the tears
Your fears
The loss
Your sacrifice given up for years
Walking my life on the lines that they decide
I'm waiting for the end of time
Praying for the end of time
Pray for the end of time

I am Everything
I am Nothing
I am Everything
I am Nothing
I am Everything
I am Nothing
I am Everything
I am Nothing

I am Everything
(i am nothing)
I am Everything
(i am nothing)

Stop fuckin' with me (A human not a machine)
I'm the accused
I'm not the enemy (A human not a machine)
You're so confused
No way you could enlighten me
No freedom trapped in slavery (A human not a machine)
Deceitful honesty (A human not a machine)
Motherfuckin' human
Not a machine
Stop fuckin' with me (A human not a machine)
I'm the accused
I'm not the enemy (A human not a machine)
You're so confused
No way you could enlighten me
No freedom trapped in slavery (A human not a machine)
Deceitful honesty (A human not a machine)
Motherfuckin' human
Not a machine (Not a machine)
