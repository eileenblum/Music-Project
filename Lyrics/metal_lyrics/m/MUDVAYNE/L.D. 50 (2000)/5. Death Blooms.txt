Cold seems crippling lame meander through corridors
aroma's thick with age mark off the day reflections of
my life are fading

Pull me out of body, don't want it, don't want in,
Feeble, frail, and rotting descending I'm lost in
Structure that's collapsing don't want it,
Cast into maker, take the body, don't want, it wants me

Past has found its place salvation is no more will god
accept my peace bleached will pardon me reflections of
my life are fading
Pull me out of body don't want it, don't want in,
Feeble, frail, and rotting descending I'm lost in,
A structure that's collapsing don't want it
Cast into maker take the body don't want it wants me

I just want to run
fly kites wrestle jump and play
Swim through waves that crash to shore memories in me
cocooned in misery

I'm sick and tired of embracing reflections of past
time receive me or cast me away, god please take me away
resistance futile suicidal ideas I will crucify my own
being satisfy
selfish needs fuck the deities justify my own right to
what's waiting for me

On the other side the time has come lock and load I'm
coming I'm, coming, I'm coming, I'm coming home

Pull me out of body don't want it don't want in,
Pull me out of body don't want it don't want in,
Pull me out of body don't want it don't want in,
Feeble, frail, and rotting descending I'm lost in,
A structure that's collapsing descending don't want it,
Maker take the body don't want it wants in,
Pull me out of body don't want it don't want in,
Feeble, frail, and rotting descending I'm lost in,
A structure that's collapsing descending don't want it,
Maker take the body don't want it wants me

I just want to run
fly kites wrestle jump and play
Swim through waves that crash to shore memories in me
cocooned in misery
Darkness overcomes, soul soars to the other plain
Existence past the door I sail through Purgatory's bay

I asked a god for poison cradle me
sown to my dreams, soul searching
death blossoms where clouds lie over me
held in god's hands
Death blooming

Dark for fear of failure... an inner gloom as wide as an
eye and fermenting
Roiling hate... death grip in my veins
unveiling rancid
petals flowering forth foul nectar the space between a
blink and a tear
...Death blooms.
