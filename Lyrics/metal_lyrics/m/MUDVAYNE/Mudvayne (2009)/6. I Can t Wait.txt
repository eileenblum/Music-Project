I am the plague I am the loss I am the bitterness
I am the war I am the death I am the crucifix
I am the sacrifice I am the end I'm the fall of man
I am apocalypse I'm the dead wish I am your last breath
I am sin, I am dead zen

[Chorus:]
I can't wait until it's over
I'm done and gone
I can't wait to lose it all
Fuck it all, fuck you all, there's nothing left anyway
They say that dead men don't pull triggers
I'll prove 'em wrong

I am catastrophe and conflict, I am warfare
I am fatality I am the wound that's in your head
I am the dark I am the fear I am the orphan lamb
I am anxiety I am the crypt I am nothingness
I am hate, I am lost faith

[Chorus:]
I can't wait until it's over
I'm done and gone
I can't wait to lose it all
Fuck it all, fuck you all, there's nothing left anyway
They say that dead men don't pull triggers
I'll prove you wrong, yeah
I'll prove you wrong, yeah

I'm empty, empty I'm empty, empty I'm empty, empty

[Chorus:]
I can't wait until it's over
I'm done and gone
I can't wait to lose it all
Fuck it all, fuck you all, there's nothing left anyway
They say that dead men don't pull triggers
I'll prove you wrong, I'll prove you wrong, I'll prove you wrong, I'll prove you wrong
Fuck it all, fuck you all, there's nothing left anyway
They say that dead men don't pull triggers
I'll prove you wrong
