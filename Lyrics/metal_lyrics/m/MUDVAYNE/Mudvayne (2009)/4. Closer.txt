Here's to the closing door
Here's to just one more
Here's to all the damned
Here's to the bloodshed

Can't leave it alone won't let me forget
Rip out the bandage and tear out the stitch
Fed like a pig off the shit in the dish
Shrouded in burlap left for dead in the ditch
So callous so cold colors expose
The death of love as we know it
The death of trust in us let go

[Chorus:]
It's getting closer all the time
I'm slipping farther all the time
I'm getting stronger all the time
I'm feeling so weak inside
I'm feeling better all the time
I'm slipping farther all the time
It's getting harder all the time
Feels like I'm losing my mind

Tied to the tracks and cursing the name
Whiteout the thought stare blank in the rain
Lethal and used cast out and worthless
Befriending the foes deception commence
So callous so cold colors expose
The death of life as we know it
The death of mirth in us let go

[Chorus]

Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in
Not by the hair on your chinny chin chin chin
Then I'll beat and I'll pound
And I'll beat your fucking brains in

Here's to the splintered door, here's to you no more

[Chorus]

It's getting closer all the time
I'm slipping farther all the time
I'm getting stronger all the time
I'm feeling so weak inside
I'm feeling better all the time
Feels like I'm losing my mind
