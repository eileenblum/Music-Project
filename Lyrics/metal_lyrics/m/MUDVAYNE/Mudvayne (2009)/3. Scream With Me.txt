Ever feel like dying,ï»¿ ever feel alone
Ever feel like crying, lost child in a store
Ever feel life pushing, shoving you away
Ever feel like breaking down, funeral in the rain
Feel life slipping away

[Chorus:]
Stand in the corner and scream with me
A body fullï»¿ of empty
A head that's full of rage better believe it
Stand in the closet and scream with me
A mind that's like a fire
Driven by the pain better believe it

Ever feel like lying, down inside a grave
Listen to the eulogy, a pyre on the hay
Ever danced beside the devil, taste the barrel of a gauge
Ever pull the trigger, light begins to fade
Feelï»¿ life slipping away

[Chorus]

I've asked you for forgiveness
I've asked for your grace
I've asked yourï»¿ for your blessing
I've asked that I be saved

[Chorus]
