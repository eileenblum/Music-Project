Past times are for laziness and past time is gone
Can't live in it can't live with it
Hard times are for the crying type are like a wrecking ball
Hard as a stone can't let it penetrate
You've gotta believe in yourself
With your mind, with your guts, with your heart, make a stand
A stand against fools that will steal it away
Rip the heart from your chest and devour it

I ain't selling what they're wanting to buy anymore, no more, never
I ain't listen because I've heard all that bullshit before, too many times before

Eyes of a dog will wander for food like a scavenger
You've gotta own it, gotta defend it
You've gotta believe in the hunt, in the prowl, in the search
In the kill, I'm the alpha man

I ain't selling what they're wanting to buy anymore, no more, never
I ain't listen because I've heard all that bullshit before, too many times

[Chorus:]
I've, I've heard it all before, I've heard it
I've, I've lived it all before, I've lived it, no more

The parasites sucking the life outta me they're like cannibals
Bleed you for anything, bleed you for everything
You've gotta believe in the strength, of your mind, of the soul
Of the bone, what is real

[Chorus:]
I've, I've heard it all before, I've heard it
I've, I've lived it all before, I've lived it, no more
I've, I've heard it all before, I've heard it
I've, I've seen it all before, I've seen it

Heard it, lived it, know it, believe it
I live for no one, I'd die for no one

[Chorus:]
I've, I've heard it all before, I've heard it
I've, I've lived it all before, I've lived it, no more
I've heard it, seen it, lived it
I've done it, know it, believe it
I've, I've heard it all before, I've lived it
