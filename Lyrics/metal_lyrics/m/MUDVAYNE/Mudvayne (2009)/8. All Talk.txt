Where will you be when it all falls down
Where will you be when it all comes back around
Where will you be at the end of our days
Just following the footsteps let the liars lead the way

[Chorus:]
I can talk about love, I can talk about hate
I can try to teach a lesson, but I doubt it penetrates
I can give you all excuses till I'm blue in the face
I could talk about serenity but it doesn't mean a thing anyway

Who will you blame, Who will you blame, Who will you blame

Who will you blame for the soot-filled days
Who will you blame for the hurricanes and tidal waves
Who will you blame for the riots and the anger
Just crying in the corner wishing you would've had a say

[Chorus]

Like a monster hides in your closet, it's creeping closer but we don't care.
Are we all insane, if it's just a game well I don't wanna play.

[Chorus]

I could talk about problems, I could talk about sin
I could talk about our triumph, what do we really win
I could talk about forgiveness, though I'd probably be condemned
Or I could talk about
