Instruments for surgery, amputate the cause
Misery of humanity is carving through us all
Emptiness resolves and falls with
Instances of perjury, lies flowing out like piss
Darken like the fall of day until we seal our end
Until they seal our end is nearing

[Chorus:]
Oh, I feel sick got a bone to pick the little men that complicate it all,
so beyond the pale that I'm ticking like a time bomb
Oh, I'm so sick that I wanna spit the little men
Lying to us all, so beyond the pale
That I'm rippin' like a chainsaw

Illustrate the tyranny, building up the walls
Each life represents a stone, as foundation crumbles
We all fall down with words that speak of blasphemy
With every breath of sin, damned until the fall of man
The day we reach our end
Until we reach our end is nearing

[Chorus:]
Oh, I feel sick got a bone to pick the little men that complicate it all,
so beyond the pale that I'm ticking like a time bomb
Oh, I'm so sick that I wanna spit the little men
Lying to us all, so beyond the pale
That I'm rippin' like a chainsaw
Oh, I feel sick got a bone to pick the little men that complicate it all,
so beyond the pale that I'm ticking like a time bomb
Oh, so beyond the pale, complicate it all, so unacceptable

They make us all bow down, they keep us all locked out
It's time that we speak up, it's time that we speak out
Put the bombs away, put the guns away
Put the bombs away, put us all away

Words fall on deaf ears, signs for the blind
Words fall on deaf ears, our worlds collide

[Chorus:]
Oh, I feel sick got a bone to pick the little men that complicate it all,
so beyond the pale that I'm ticking like a time bomb
Oh, so beyond the pale, complicate it all, so unacceptable
Oh, feel sick, oh I'm nauseous, oh fucking sick, unacceptable
Oh, so beyond the pale, complicate it all, so unacceptable
