Like a worm, boring through
Cinders and rock and ash I think I need a broom
To sweep away the day, cleanse us of the shame we're in, I'm in
Like a stray, with the mange, worms and lice and matted
Think I need to bathe, to wash away the day
Cleanse us of the palate rid me of the taste

[Chorus:]
You keep leading me, you keep driving me
You keep pushing me, out to pasture to graze
Can't keep strangling, can't keep ignoring me
Can't keep choking me, climbing a clock tower
You keep telling us, you keep shoving us
You keep forcing us, out to pasture to graze
You stopped listening, you stopped listening
You stopped hearing me, so I'm loading my gun

Like a bum, sifting through
Dumpsters and trash and garbage, think I need some food
I've starved away all day, cleanse us of the hunger we're in, I'm in
Like a snake, sliding through
Sand and dirt and desert, think I need a tomb
To blacken out the day, veil me from the sunlight keep me in my place

[Chorus]

It seems to me, there are so many things
they don't want to share now doesn't that seem strange
It seems to me, it's all for one but doesn't it seem strange
When the one's for none not you, not me, no one

Doesn't it seem strange, that we don't know a thing
Doesn't it feel the same, as the cattle out to graze
Don't ya think it's strange, that we can't find our way
Don't you feel the same
Doesn't it seem strange, that we don't know a thing
Doesn't it feel the same, as the cattle out to graze
Don't ya think it's strange, that we can't find our way
Don't you feel the same

[Chorus]
