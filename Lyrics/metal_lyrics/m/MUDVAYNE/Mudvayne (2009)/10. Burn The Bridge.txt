No integrity, no sincerity, no credibility, and no regret
No principle no ethic no honor, makes no fucking sense
No insight towards the future, no vision and no respect
No authority, no veracity, no honesty and no penitence
No pride, no power, just a criminal, no morale

[Chorus:]
Your greed, you'd burn the bridge around me to save yourself
Your envy, you can't be what I am even with my help
Gluttony, take everything from me take it all for yourself
My wrath, I'll just live my own life

So violent, so dissident, no more requiem, so I lament
So simple to revere, to respect, down and left for dead
So forget my forgiveness, you've all failed to protect
My persistence, insistence, my will, my stubbornness
Consume, devour, like a criminal, no standards

[Chorus]

Before I saw the light, I crawled through darkness my whole life, so empty
Before I found my life, I embraced the death that's coming, so certain
Drawing near, coming closer it's approaching
I know the signs, I've got the number, I've found my vision
I know the motion, my eye's forever open

[Chorus:]
You'd burn the bridge around me to save yourself
Your envy, you can't be what I am even with my help
Gluttony, take everything from me take it all for yourself
My wrath, I'll just live my own life
My own life, my own life, my own life
