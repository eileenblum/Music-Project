I've got a splitting headache, chew aspirin for the pain
I'm on my wagon rolling, like a freight train
Another darkest day, always in harms way
I got a new bruise swelling, beaten by the bottle

[Chorus:]
So beautiful, and so strange
Scatter all the pieces
The puzzle will remain the same
So hideous, so de-ranged
Crawling through the tunnels
Lost inside the maze

Tremble like an earthquake, weight shifts inside me
The crucifix I'm dragging, nailed to the hard way
They won't forget me, the walls are bloodstained
As my will unravels, broken like a bottle

[Chorus:]
So beautiful, and so strange
Scatter all the pieces
The puzzle will remain the same
So hideous, so de-ranged
Crawling through the tunnels
Lost inside the maze
So beautiful, and so strange
Dropping little pebbles
Lost inside of this head space
So hideous, so de-ranged
Winding through the tunnels
Lost inside the maze, again locked inside of

You stole the matches, you lit the fuse
You let the boiler swell, I tied the noose on you

[Chorus]
So beautiful, and so strange
Scatter all the pieces
The puzzle will remain the same
So hideous, so de-ranged
Crawling through the tunnels
Lost inside the maze
So beautiful, you were beautiful
And so strange, but not as strange as me
So hideous, like the voice inside me
So deranged, locked inside my cage

Lost inside of me, lost inside of
Locked inside of me, locked inside of
