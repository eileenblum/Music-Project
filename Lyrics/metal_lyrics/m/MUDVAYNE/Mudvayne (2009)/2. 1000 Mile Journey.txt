Long's the life, steep's the climb
I took a match and lit the fire, fire
Pain for the pain, my guts ache
Built by the sin that was taught by the father, father
Now come and walk with me

[Chorus:]
The journey of a thousand miles -- it starts with one step
Plowing out the rows, the bleeding of the rose
A butterflies wings can start tornadoes don't ya know
Harvesting the souls, burying the bones

Deep inside the hole, shovel's always full
I bit the dog and I beat the master, master
Eye for an eye, tooth's been pulled
Lost all control that was taught by the mother, the mother
Now come and walk with me

[Chorus]

Another feeble man, arms outstretched out in a distant land
Wonders where it all went wrong, he's followed us too long
Another fallen man, that failed to make a stand
What have I done wrong, left here all alone
The voice inside my head, is it me or an alien
Throw me down the stairs, since I just don't care no more

I can't take the wind, I can't fight the storm, anymore
I don't have the will, I can't be the storm, anymore

[Chorus]
The journey of a thousand miles -- it starts with one step
Plowing out the rows, the bleeding of the rose
A butterflies wings can start tornadoes don't ya know
Harvesting the souls, burying the bones of old
The hurricanes eye is like the calm before the storm
Darkening the shore, settling the score
A butterflies wings can start tornadoes don't ya know
Harvesting the souls, burying the bones of old
