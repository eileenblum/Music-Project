I don't feel good, just an ordinary day
I don't care much, about what you think

[Chorus:]
It all washes away, in the end
Under skies so gray, in the end
We're all dead inside, can't deny what is real, the pain I feel
Dead inside, can't deny, always suffering
It's just my way

I've seen enough, no more hurt today
All damage is done, no more life this way

[Chorus]

Every single one, from every single way
All they do is drag me down and I know it'll never change
Every drop of blood, flows right down the drain
And though I spilled it all for you, you never appreciate
You never appreciate, we're all

Dead inside, can't deny what is real, the pain I feel
Dead inside, can't deny, always suffering
It's just my way
Dead inside, can't deny what is real, the pain I feel
Dead inside, can't deny, always suffering
It's just my way
