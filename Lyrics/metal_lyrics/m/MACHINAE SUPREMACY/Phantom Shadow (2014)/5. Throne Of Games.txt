You know that you are epic
in the world where you escape
Skills are honed with severity
as your enemies despair
Why do you believe
that you are less than that in this outfit?
Trust me you have trained for this for years

So no, this is not the time for you to lay in wait
You have battled a million times and
now pony up for war
Death and brutal injury
are all legit concerns of course,
but weighed up and surpassed by the rewards

Why donât you play it like a game?
If that is all you know
why not display some fucking mad skills

Bring it on right now

Our reality is broken now
We are forgotten, we are lost
and weâre disconnected
Put on your game-face
and reset that switch inside
Descend your throne of games
and stand with us with pride
