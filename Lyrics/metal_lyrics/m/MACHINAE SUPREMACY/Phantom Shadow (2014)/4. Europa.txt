What was is done
I seek no forgiveness,
I wonât claim this day as ours
Though one less âheroâ to watch out for,
and we still live

We are as we have always been,
(itâs) as if only now
this got real for you
This is no game, I know all too well
This was what I lived,
this was all that I knew once

Then

Not everything
has to mean something
They found us in spite of me
And They know now that we wonât go

Not quietly
