We were young and tough and serious
and the world our enemy
But now is different
We are all that stands between

I see youâve met my new pet
Tell your crew to back away
They donât want that kind of hurt

Trust me

You went on alone,
now itâs time
for you to come back in from the cold, again
We stand alone but we are
like you once were,
warriors who heard the call
(for all)

It was easy being fearless
when the pain was never real
But now is different
We are all that stands between
the end of the world that we know
and what we have right here
We need you in this war

Trust me

Used to be a single voice that vanished in a crowd
Vague just like a distant sun when hidden by the clouds
Found a way to surface and to speak my truth aloud

Be powerful

Stand fast and proud.
