You know by now Iâm not âThe Oneâ
But I can be the one you need
What you believe
I will defeat all greater evils
make them bleed

Iâm so done with complacency
Iâve picked my allies and my enemy
Made my choice and now I stand with you
Iâll see it through

I thrive on murder but a fight is still a fight and I
suppose I might as well fight for what is right to make it up this time
Suppress that darkness in me
What I once was and would be were it not for those who still hold on to me
Those who would call themselves allies of mine,
Brothers, Sisters and Friends of mine
Until the end of time

So what if I am not âThe Oneâ?
Whatever difference does it make?
You still believe that Iâll defeat them anyway
That I will break their hold on everything
Iâve picked my allies and my enemy
Made my choice and now I stand with you
Iâll see it through

It fuels the fire in my eyes
Promise me that we will kill them all,
no other justice will suffice

And now that you are here with me again
Where do we go?
I failed you, I lost one of them
Iâm so so sorry

But you left me all alone
