I had set eyes on you
when they made their move
Finally dawned on me that night
when they came for you
This was all part of His design,
I was supposed to find you
and take out those would attempt to take you (out)

I canât see why I am here
if not to be what you can never

I will play my part
For Him, for you and for us all
I am the one,
The Perfect Dark, The Enemy
Iâll tear out their hearts
Bring the fall, The End of All
I am the one,
The Perfect Dark, The Enemy

You wanna know what I am
You have doubts, I get that
I was someone different but then He came
He got me out
You have nothing to fear from me,
I will never harm you,
I will always do what He wants me to, and

I canât see why I am here
if not to be what you can never

I can stay, I can leave
But what if you need me?
You want peace of mind
or do you want to be alive?
He left me here because he knew
that you would need me
and what I can do
