Where I was, not one to follow
You gave me something I did not believe
was ever meant for me
Oh my god, I

I am grateful, you know that
But I have nothing to give in return for this
My life for what?
What else was I good for?

You know me
I canât be redeemed
What do you want from me?
You took me out of play
and now you choose to free me again?
I have no cause
I donât believe
I kill, thatâs all I know
I am the villain of this story,
what else could I ever be?

My penance weaved into this conflict,
this hidden war
I canât believe
you gave me back what I thought for sure lost

But I donât see what I can do here
What is it you want me to be for you?
My life for what?
What else was I good for?

Even though I canât feel what you feel
I understand, and we move forward
Better than alone
Yeah, I am

I'm so much better by your side than lost in night
I have my own reasons

But Iâll believe for you
