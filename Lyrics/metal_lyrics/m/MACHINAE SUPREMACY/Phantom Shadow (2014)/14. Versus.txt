you look so different in this light
I see you
as if for the first time ever
I will still stand with you in this fight
but you and I are through
I know now that I am better than you

You know it's true
Now get the fuck out of my way, old man

The world around us cast in flames
Gods will rise and then fall again
in a light that fades and dies away
Do you feel?
We arrive at the final seal
The last of us and the God Machine
in a light that fades and dies away

If only you knew what it meant to me
to see you now
your own wings extended and proud
I wanted you to find your own truth
your own why and how
And now I can free you
from what youâve been through

You know itâs true
I release you, so go now, my child
