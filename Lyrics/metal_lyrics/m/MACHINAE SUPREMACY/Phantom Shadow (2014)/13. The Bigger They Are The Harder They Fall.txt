I donât believe my eyes
Is it really you,
are you really here?
Is it really you?
You were dead and gone,
but now here you are

Here you are

But you are Different now, I see
They have turned you into what I used to be
(No,) more a Phantom than the old me, really
And you have come to fight with me?
I wish this would not be
I wish it wasnât up to me to end you

But even so, here we are
No reason
No regret
No words to say

So be it
