The sequence has begun, itâs too late
The machine comes alive, itâs awake
Whatâll happen if I donât?
What if I canât or I wonât go?
And what awaits me beyond,
(what) awaits me beyond

All my angels are gone, Iâm alone
What is left for me here? I donât know
Whatâll happen if I donât?
What if I canât or I wonât go?
I see no other way out of this
I see no other way

Gather all who remain here
This will be an epic display
Touch the fire's embrace
and die

I've no fear,
I have no remorse
I will do this for you,
and because
I wanna see how it ends
I wanna know what awaits
beyond these walls

I have lost so much
I donât know what else there is
When is it enough?
I canât quit, I won't give up
This is not my end
I know that for certain now
This is something else
A new day; a different self
