I was at a crossroads,
and I was done
But seems as though
I still stand second to none
even now

Fought my fate and it set me free
with nought but darkness in heart
Mark this day and what I decree
I will show the world who we are

I have this soul now inside me
I need to

I have been asleep for so long
for so long
Whatever happened?
Now the world is coming down around me
Brought back to life again
by allies of days gone by
Whatever was is now a lie
a lie

I was always faster than everyone
I don't need a weapon,
don't need my gun
(to) show you how

Iâm trying to hang on
My soul is weak but I will be strong
We are all where we belong
And I need you all to be right here with me

Donât want these final days of mine to have meant nothing
and if I should die at least I died for something
Donât want these final days of mine to all go wasted
I will no longer stay in line
