I feel all black inside like coal
I wonder if you know?
An evil thrives inside my soul
the darkest place I know
I rage at everyone I see
Nocturnal fiends and all that be
just keep away from me
I search the shadows of my inner being
and see reflections of my twisted memories
The darker half of our nature
our misery
Is this the monster you call madness?
Insanity?
I feel all black inside like coal
I wonder if you know?
an evil nourished by my soul
the darkest place I know
so far from who we are
beneath our hidden scars
so far from where we once were
save me from this dark and twisted avatar
lead me back to where we were
It scrapes the corners of this waking dream
my own illusions leaving fissures in its seams
A pure distinction of hatred
and jealousy
Is this the one fallen angel
inside of me?
I feel all black inside like coal
how could you even know?
