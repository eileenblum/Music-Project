Flash of light, soft yet bright
I walk beneath the shadows
of the evernight
Never could have known
there was a place like this
where the world burns
and still I can exist
I can't hear the storm anymore
and I don't know what it's for
I can't feel my legs
but still I keep going
I can't feel my hands
but still I rest knowing
that I won't go alone
In the far twilight awaits
opens up to embrace
This barren soil
scorched and stained
by the blood of soldiers
left fallen in the rain
All the light in the world today
Won't light up the night
into which I walk away
