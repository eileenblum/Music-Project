Caught in the wind
are the voices of the damned
They harbinger the coming fray
You will be wise to heed as best you can
or Death embraces you as prey
You could sing the song of truth,
the silent dirge of honor
or meet your judgment in dismay
I could take you anytime
anywhere my presence is sublime
Or I'll just kill you in your sleep
Just another pointless life sold cheap
A light that fades away
turning to night from day
and leaving here to drift away
I bring forth the end to you
the ph34r as I come into view
the last thing you will ever see is me
(my eyes)
