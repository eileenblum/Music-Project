Come summon all your deities
they stand on trial
before a tribunal of humankind
We are but children to the earth
No matter what they say
we owe it all to her
she is beautiful
our fading world tonight
History bleeds for tomorrow
for us to realize
and never more follow blind
We offer conscious rebirth
there is no other way
we owe it all to her
she is beautiful
our fading world tonight
Somewhere close but far away
(the light) where we are all forever
All of those who long to stay
(the light) will tear apart and sever
It's time to carry the burden
to rise above all dreams
of aliens and gods
We are but children to the earth
No matter how you pray
we owe it all to her
so beautiful
our dying world tonight
Somewhere close but far away,
the light, obscured in disarray
A withered rose
that sprung and fades tonight,
watching as they sway...
you know it's now or never
