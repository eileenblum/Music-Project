Silent like a tomb
the city reaches for the sky
I'm left alone here and I can't remember why
Lying on a rooftop
in a vast garden of concrete
The silence echoes in the streets
See as my eyes stray to pan
across the barren surface
as monolithic structures
tower through the silence
All of man's creations
left abandoned without purpose
I am alone yet feel its malice
And while the clear blue mid-day air
is feeling slightly awkward
as shafts of sunlight
stray across my field of view
I find new perspective
as tomorrow turns today
and in the sky I see
a soaring bird of prey
staring at the trees
I see them all begin to sway
I sense a storm is coming my way
I can barely see as
the sky erupts in light
hell falls all around me,
then suddenly, it's night...
Then without a whisper
the atmosphere is torn
Instinct is screaming
for shelter from the storm
I can barely see as the sky erupts in light
hell falls all around me,
then suddenly, it's night...
