Another night is drawing nigh
I feel the spike in my side
to rid us all from this disease
And though a legion sides with me
and marches on ferociously
I can't force war to find my peace
I've seen the other side
the one world beyond our dog pride
somewhere outside is evolution, standing by
One in a million's just a drone
amassed in crowds you're still alone
the last of its kind is
the one with a mind of its own
This fate of ours is still unknown
I look at you and see what I
What I hate so in myself
I urge to vanquish this from me
And yet despite my open mind
I can not force those who are blind
to open up their eyes and see
I claim no unjust victory
but I am not afraid to see through
the shroud of destiny
Time and law are both my enemies
I won't fade away in history
I will mark this land with my beliefs
I never turned away or ran to hide
I have lived with my own mind as my guide
I never sold my right to decide
it was taken from me
Courtesy of the blind dog pride
the eyes of seekers turning wide
lost is he by someone else's side
he who isn't free
I know now my fate is in my mind
and those soothing words
they just drive me blind
I never sold out human kind
It was taken from me!
