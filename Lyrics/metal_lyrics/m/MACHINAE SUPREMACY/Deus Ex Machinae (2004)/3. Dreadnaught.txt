So we're finally united here
at the crossroads of our fears
Now the voice of god is everywhere
in our heads and in our ears
Turn the world into an enemy
and believe in me
I will make you see
I will never grant you ground
remember me and why you all bow down
to a metal forge dominion
Silent in a heart of steel
the voice that speaks so any man can feel
You believe in our dominion
Now the terror is the other we
and their unholy deity
It's time to boost the notoriety
of our great society
