I taste the bitter sweetness
of revenge and fly
no other meaning ever
stills my violent sky
Abused and violated
by those who control
I am re-animated
yet I have no soul
There's no distinction in my mind
You are all my enemies
I will return
to reclaim my broken past
to pay the evil minions back
for my misery at last
I will return
to the fortress to redeem
to wipe this evil nightmare
from my memory and dreams
I will not fade away
and die like all the rest
I will return to wipe out
terminate your nest
