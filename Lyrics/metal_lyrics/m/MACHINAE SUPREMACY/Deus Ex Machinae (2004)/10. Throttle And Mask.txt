I left their sheltered care and walked
a rogue in total freedom
to see the world with my own eyes
live by my sword
I joined the fray to find
what I believed was instant wisdom
but what I got was more than I ever wished for
Hate to bring you down,
to push your face into the ground
but it never is that simple!
Try so hard
to see the shards for what they are...
No, it never will be simple!
Sometimes emotion clouds my sight
as I rejoice in life
I know to treasure my own zest
for I am still young
I let my inspiration
savior me from mundane strife
and I refuse to go unheard, my truth unsung
