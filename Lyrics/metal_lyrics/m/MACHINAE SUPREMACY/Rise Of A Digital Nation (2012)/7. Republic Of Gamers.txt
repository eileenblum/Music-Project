Beyond and once again, you know how this is gonna end
the same way it always seems to do
Donât yet know how to deal with what is obviously true
we are better than you

WE ARE ALL EQUALS HERE
AND WE FIGHT FOR DOMINION TONIGHT
WE DONâT ASK COLOR, RACE OR CREED,
DEDICATED, FREE-FOR-ALL

Passed through my line of sight
You are the one that caught my eye
Iâm coming for you right now
Yeah you can try to hide
How many levels can you up
before I track you down and make you die?

WEâLL LIGHT A FIRE UNDER YOU
DROP SOME TUNES AND JUST YOUTUBE THE SIGHT
BUT WE ARE ALL ON COMMON GROUND
AND WE ALL STAND TALL
