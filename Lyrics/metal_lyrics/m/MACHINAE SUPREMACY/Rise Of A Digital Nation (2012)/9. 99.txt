The events that brought us here
all unfortunate, I fear
but canât be helped
I am sincere
Envoy from the world below
take this message to your own
there was no way we could have known

Just pieces on the board all waiting to be moved
Tell me why I should care for you?  

I STAND ABOVE THE WORLD
IN MY GLASS ENCLAVE
AND I CAN NOT BE HURT
BY THE WAR AND THE HARROWING WAVES

FROM HIGH ABOVE THE WORLD
I SEE THE ONES DEPRAVED
THEY KNOW TO STAY AWAY
FROM OUR WALLS AND THE MASTER SLAVES

I live life without remorse
out of sight is out of mind
no regard for their kind
In spite of everything I have
I owe no debt to those who donât
I played the game and I won
