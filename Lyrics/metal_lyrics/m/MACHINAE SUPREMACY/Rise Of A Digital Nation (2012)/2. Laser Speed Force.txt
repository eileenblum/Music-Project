Strap down and dig your heals in
Prepare to kill them all
Youâll pull the trigger when itâs due

We need to silence all
and any doubt among us
So that we can do what we need to

Eight tons of armored steel
and any weapon you will need
Now is the time to prove that you are elite

Sun blazing in your back, defolding space as you attack
Skull fighters on your wing, now we react 

HER SONG LEAVES THE OTHER SIDE IN FLIGHT FOR THEIR LIVES
NOW THEY ARE NOT LONG FOR THIS WORLD

No one leaves, line up for inevitable wipeout
all youâve done now itâs what you deserve

Split second call, heat seeker
One more goes up in flames
A million lights across your view

You have to prove your own worth to friend and foe alike
This weak display just will not do

They know you from afar
to be the weakest of them all
but that will change 
when you still stand as they fall
