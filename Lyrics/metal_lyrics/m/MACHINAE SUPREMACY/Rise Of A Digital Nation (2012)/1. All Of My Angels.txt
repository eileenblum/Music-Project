This bleak and unbearable world
has left me cold and wanting
I need someone to make me feel. Real. Now!
Submerged and trapped beneath the ice,
without your light, without your eyes

I keep looking to find myself in me again

Alive in spite of it all
one with her
Once I aim for the win
Iâll find a way

ALL OF MY ANGELS ARE RIGHT HERE WITH ME
HOLD ME AS I ACHE FROM THE THINGS I HAVE SEEN
I HAVE ALL MY ANGELS AND I AM NOT ALONE
WAKE ME IF I TURN TO STONE

But I will not go quietly
itâs not my time
âs not meant to be
What can I do to make you hear. Me. Now?!

I touch the white upon the window sill
cracks are spidering across the glass
No one will see me if I hold perfectly still
This sense of hopelessness will surely pass

For reasons I have yet to understand
I know the world in ways I canât explain
What I can see, itâs like the ocean next to land
It all seems futile and in vain
