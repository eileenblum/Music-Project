You will not repent
or right your wrongs
But we will make you

Weighed by all youâve done youâve learned to live
and to sleep at night in spite
But we are here en masse and make it right

We get off fighting evil,
expose to the world
For those who are able,
enlighten the herd

But we have no law no restriction
no line in the sand

We are underground
A faceless breed
And we can see you

We donât forgive, we donât forget,
we are Legion, above defeat
Now the world will break beneath our feet

We ally with no others
We come as we were
No one and nothing
in the eyes of the world
But we have the skills to undo you
and too idle hands
