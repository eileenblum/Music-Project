They try to beat me
but they will not ever defeat me
This time weâre on my battleground
Iâm gonna win, trust in me
Iâve come to save this world
and in the end Iâll get the girl 

Iâve missed it, so twisted
and unsurpassed in my head
This sense of power has awakened in me
I feel I could take on the world a day like this,
my rage is brewing like a storm

AND NOW THE STORM HAS GROWN OUT OF CONTROL
RIGHT HERE, THE VOICE OF ANGER TAKING TONE
âCAUSE NOW THE FIRE IN OUR HEARTS EXPLODE
BABY, LETâS BLOW THIS JOINT AND BUILD OUR OWN

Sometimes you just need to
level everything with the ground
to make room for all the things
you wanted, somehow

And I have known it all along,
the day is coming
when you will reap your evil ways
