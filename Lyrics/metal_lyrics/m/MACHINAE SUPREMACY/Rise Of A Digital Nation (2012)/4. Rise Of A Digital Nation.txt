As per request, the unabridged repeat, the answer to
my understanding of the truth as it pertains to you

We are the last of the fated the lost and unseen
We reject whatever we were supposed to be

ALL EYES ON ME
GATHER ALL WHO BELIEVE
(WE RISE TO RESET THE WORLD)

THOUGH FAR APART, UNITED BY HEART
(AND FIGHT FOREVER)

We cast increasingly irrelevant designs aside
make room for our incendiary cultural divide

IT IS A CAUSE FOR US TO SING
ITâS HOW WE KNOW THAT WE WILL WIN
ITâS TRUE, YOU WOULDNâT KNOW
CAUSE IT CAN NOT BE TAUGHT OR SHOWN

THERE ARE NO GATES TO HOLD US BACK
AND ALL YOUR WORDS ARE ONLY THAT

And this is who we are
