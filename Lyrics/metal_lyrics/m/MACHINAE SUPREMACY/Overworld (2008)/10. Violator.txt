Close your eyes and just ignore
all that is wrong with your beliefs
What better way to be devout?
Hammer down the innocent minds
of those trusting boys and girls,
And shut the door on your way out

You think to build a master faith
on torture and pain?
No room for logic or debate,
in God's domain?

Hide your young away and
teach them only what you know to be
God's honest truth in vast supply
What you teach is so implausible,
You cannot trust the world
to not convince them otherwise

How pitiful this land of yours
Where free thought is feared
And make you isolate
and force your children to revere

Close your eyes and just ignore
all that is wrong with your beliefs
What better way to be devout?
Hammer down the innocent minds
of those trusting boys and girls,
And shut the door on your way out

No one will stand in the way of your bastard parade
But the hateful and fearing will come to your aid
Even the youngest have a place in your crusade
There is no defiance there when you invade
You think to build the master faith on torture and pain?
With indoctrination the true God will reign
No room for logic or debate, in your domain.
