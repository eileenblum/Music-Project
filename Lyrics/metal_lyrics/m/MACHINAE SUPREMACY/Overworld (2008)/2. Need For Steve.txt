We'll give you complete creative control...

Conformity is tainted
by the mark of mediocrity
I never want to be a statistic
Another life unmade and put it to the ground

I will live forever,
I refuse to fade away into the never
I don't wait for heaven,
I will leave my mark right here on earth instead

Don't bother with the jilted
I cast my ripples in eternity
Prepare to kill me more than once,
as I echo on in future minds

I will be forever,
I refuse to fade away into the never,
I don't wait for heaven,
I will live my life right here on earth instead

So many under the sun,
so many under the gun
but I've only just begun,
a million miles till I'm done
A million miles till I'm done

I will live forever,
I refuse to fade away into the never
I don't wait for heaven,
I will leave my mark right here on earth instead

I will be forever,
I refuse to fade away into the never,
I don't wait for heaven,
I will live my life right here on earth instead

So many under the sun,
so many under the gun
but I've only just begun,
a million miles till I'm done

So many under the sun,
so many under the gun
but I've only just begun,
a million miles till I'm done
A million miles till I'm done
