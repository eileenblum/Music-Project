Say can you feel the thunder
In the air
Just like the moment 'fore it hits
Then it's everywhere

What is this spell we're under,
Do you care?
The might you rise above it is
now within your sphere

At most anyone you are
A god beneath the sun
But if that's the sun
You are not the only one
You can do what you like
You can fly, you can die and ask why

Do you recall the hour
you came to be
That single moment in your life
When you broke the peace

And with the awesome power
Of disbelief
You rise above the evil dead
And their false decree

Why don't you?
Why don't we?

Say can you feel the thunder
In the air
Just like the moment before it hits
Then it's everywhere

What is the spell we're under?
Do you care?
The might you rise above it is
now within your sphere

At most anyone you are
A god beneath the sun
But if that's the sun
You are not the only one
You can do what you like
You can fly, you can die and ask why

[x2]
Why don't you?
Why don't we?
