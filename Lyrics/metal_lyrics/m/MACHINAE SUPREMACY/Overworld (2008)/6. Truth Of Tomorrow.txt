Are you one of the marching undead
Or do you deviate like me
Don't speak, there is someone else in your head
No you are not alone

Walls are raised while we sleep
To seal us to our end
Closing till we are never
Alone ever again

The screen across your eyes
When covered by those who decide
The ones behind the lies
In the truth of tomorrow

They already know how to find you
And soon enough through your eyes see
And they will use it all to bind you
Into a mindless drone

Walls are raised while we sleep
To seal us to our end
Closing till we are never
Alone ever again

The screen across your eyes
When covered by those who decide
The ones behind the lies
In the truth of tomorrow

Now I'm waiting to be ceased
And turned in to a brand
The chip beneath my skin, ready to be scanned
Am I merely a supply?
Meeting some demand
Is this a lullaby
In someones masterplan?

Walls are raised while we sleep
To see us till our end
Closing till we are never
Alone ever again

[x3]
The screen across your eyes
When covered by those who decide
The ones behind the lies
In the truth of tomorrow
