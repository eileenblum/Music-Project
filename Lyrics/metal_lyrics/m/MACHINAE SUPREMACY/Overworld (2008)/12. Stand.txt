We stand by our ways
It is not just a game that we play

Now you have forced our hand
Right here we make our stand
These walls can't keep us in (no matter what has been)
This fight runs under my skin

Our gift to a world in need
A soundtrack for the brand new breed
Never before did you see
Throughout all of history
Such a rebel force, an army
Of little freaks

Now you have forced our hand
Right here we make our stand
These walls can't keep us in (no matter what has been)
This fight runs under my skin

Why have we fallen?
How could we fail always?

Time's up you corporate whores
We reinvented the art of war
Never before did you see
Such an underground victory
Such a rebel force, an army
Of little freaks

Now you have forced our hand
Right here we make our stand
These walls can't keep us in (no matter what has been)
This fight runs under my skin

Why have we fallen?
How could we fail always?
All lies are believable
Even the ones we are never - told

Now you have forced our hand
Right here we make our stand
These walls can't keep us in (no matter what has been)
This fight runs under my skin

Now you have forced our hand
Right here we make our stand
These walls are about to fall
Prepare for the total recall
Revolution burns within us all
