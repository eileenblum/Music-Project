In the corner of your eye
I can see into your mind
A shadow beneath your smile
Something hidden deep inside
Silently you wait for someone to see you

Claw your flesh from off your bones
Face that fire on your own
Embrace the life you thought that you could never know
Can't erase the pain inside without a storm within
They left the lies like scars underneath your skin
The one your hiding in, the one you're supposed to live in

And you gaze up at the sky
As the clouds are passing by
And you wonder for a while
What it would be like to die
Silently you wish for someone to save you

Claw your flesh from off your bones
Face that fire on your own
Embrace the life you thought that you could never know
Can't erase the pain inside without a storm within
They left their lies like scars underneath your skin
The one you're hiding in, the one you're supposed to live in

But you want to be alive
As the self-loathing subsides
And you will not be denied
So you push their lies aside
Violently you burn for someone to feel you

Claw your flesh from off your bones
Face that fire on your own
Embrace the life you thought that you could never know
Can't erase the pain inside without a storm within
They left their lies like scars underneath your skin
The one your hiding in, the one you're supposed to live in
