I would have thought to find you somewhere less sinister  
I know you know the truth but still act the court jester, still 

That is who we are, from the dust of starsâ¦
We fight over ridiculous things
while our sun expands to one day kill us all 
A perfect end for the waste of space that we are

How many witches burned,  
how many drowned that wouldnât float?  
How many women killed  
because we feared they would rock the boat? Stillâ¦ 

(Itâs) who we are
