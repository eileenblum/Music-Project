I disappear as the water comes over me 
Why is it so hard to keep breathing? 

Here is our terminus, and a yellow sky above  
tell me, Who are we? What of us?  
and Where are you, my love? I feel Iâ¦ 

Iâm on the edge of a dark world and Iâm scared 
Shadows descend on me â Please wake me up! 

I know that youâll find me if I believe, ifâ¦ 
If I keep breathing
I fear my time is here 
so would you please, 
please hurry, I need you

I need you here, I need you to rescue me 
from down where I wander aimlessly 

Here is our terminus, and a yellow sky above  
tell me, Who are we? What of us?  
I donât know, itâs not enough, I feel Iâ¦
