The things Iâve seen, where Iâve been, if I could tell you, I would  
But Iâve no words, I have but these scars under my skin 

I always thought they were dreams, certainly not memories 
But you are here, what does it mean?  
Where do we begin? 

From Heaven sent, or the other thing?  
I donât care, I donât need to know 
I am awake, Iâm remembering,  
our time is never enough 

Will you hold on to me?
Embrace me if I toss and turn?
Tell me, do you believe?
Come watch with me, as our world burns
Will you pretend with me,
(that to) what we once were, we will return?
Sky, earth and in-between
Come watch with me, as our world burns

I was alone, it was okay, I never felt quite right in a crowd anyway  
My comfort found among selected few, but true to me 

I act the part (that) you expect 
I was never sure, but it seemed to be 
the best disguise, donât you see?  
You never really saw me 

We have come to impasse
The universe demands a sacrifice
a balance to restore
That means you and me, not either or
Are you prepared to give everything?
I will not let you go for anything
Screw balance, I want more, 
a life worth living for
