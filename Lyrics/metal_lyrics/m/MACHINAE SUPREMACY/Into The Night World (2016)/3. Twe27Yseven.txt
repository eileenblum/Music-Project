A course was set 
but with a planet this far gone 
was there ever any hope at all? 
I vaguely recollect the ache of our ambition, 
our brief age of contrition 
We set out, we had a mission 

Once our common cause, I would give my all 
The sun could not outshine me 
It wasnât something new, just something real and true  

There is a fire in my heart and somewhere deep inside  
a cry for war still overtakes the silence  

All they ever see is my face, 
itâs all part of the show, 
our masquerade, always
Dawn is only so near, 
and our pain and our pride 
is all we have here,
always 

We are too busy standing tall, 
caught up, and too afraid  
what happens if we stumble, if we fall? 
We build our homes of sticks and weeds 
and fear the wind too much to risk planting new seeds 
But thatâs just what we need now 

But youâre still on my mind, in my sights, 
and if I have to carry on alone, 
I will conquer on my own
I stand outside the world, A Guardian, 
I will defend it with my life 
and I am soaring ever higher

â¦all we have
