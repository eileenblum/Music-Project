Pulled under,  
I drown in search for meaning in this ocean  
of self-hating children and blame 
Why does the story always end the same way? 

The fireâs fading, I am ~

I will decide and shed forever
my frozen image here on earth
Iâm being pulled Into The Night World
Enter a Phantom Universe

(This) was not meant for me, 
and I feel you owe no emotion 
I hold my head high just the same 
I will use what I have, what you gave away 

We play with our words 
and we play with our tongues  
And we dream of songs that have yet to be sung
while our hearts grow stale 
I know this ink on my skin forms a link 
from my sins to my soul 
I can see, now, sight beyond sight,
of a world behind ours, 
and the truth behind the veil 

The fireâs fading, I am playing along, itâs all so fake 
The fireâs fading, I am
Enter a new age here on Earth 
Enter a Phantom Universe
