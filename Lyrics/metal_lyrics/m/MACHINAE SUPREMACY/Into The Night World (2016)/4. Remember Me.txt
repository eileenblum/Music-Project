Life is strange sometimes, wouldnât you say? 
I know it was for us, but thatâs okay 
You made me smile, I taught you how 
and you do it too, even just thinking about it now 

I know it isnât easy, 
but nothing worthwhile ever is 
It was a dream, 
a perfect image of a life that turned out to be 
just a moment, lost with me 

Our time we had together, 
we thought would last forever 
You will always know
what we said and what we showed
Stay with me, 
in this moment I remain in your arms, 
in your memories and dreams
Will you wake up and still remember?

Once you belonged, you had found your way 
Oh, to feel alive and safe every day 
Those little things that matter most, you know? 
We had, and more, it was indescribable 

I know it isnât easy,  
but nothing worthwhile ever is 
Our love was true,  
but now the promise of the future calls to you 
I know you hear it, too 

Will you wake up and still 
remember me?
