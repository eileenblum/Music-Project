Burn, 
in a universe of nothing, like the sun,  
I am one of an infinite number, 
all too lost, too undone  

I will forge my own world, my own law,   
and if broken, my dragons will decimate  
without a single word ever spoken  

Firelight for as far as heaven is wide 
Summon the dragon war
Twilight of the ones, the Children of God 
Burning, falling

Why â in spite of great abundance â do we suffer? Die? 
The wise know not to off the light at night, 
so to watch the lazy waste their lives 

I will forge â¦ 

We have allowed you to stake your claim,
but youâll do nothing else, no more  
This world is not, never was your domain
and you have lost this war
