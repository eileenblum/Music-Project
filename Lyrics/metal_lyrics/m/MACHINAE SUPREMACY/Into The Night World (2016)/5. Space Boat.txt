Under attack by an alien race 
All-out war in the depth of space 
This may well be our defining moment 
but I just wanna get away 
I just wanna get away 

Come on baby, 
got a space boat just for two
Itâs all set, just me and you 
Brace for escape velocity, now itâs time to go! 
Come on baby, 
got a way out, what are we to do? 
I would have done it all for you 
But ours is a different destiny, 
now itâs time to go

You know me, I canât deal with this âtude 
Oh, I would totally fight for you 
but not for this fucking planet  
I just wanna get away 
I just wanna get away 

I will wrap myself in your echo, 
dream and imagine
Do you remember the night we happened? 
The road underneath and the engine?  
I just want you to be here
or I will be anywhere, I donât care 
just as long as youâll be there
Tonight we will disappear
