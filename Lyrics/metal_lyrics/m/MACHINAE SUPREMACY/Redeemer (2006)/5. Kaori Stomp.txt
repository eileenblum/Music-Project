You're so cool, love the style
eyes crazy, hair like a child
a single taste, and I smile
truly free, running wild

You! Fly!

You got the style, ikasu
Ore wa oboete iru
When you are here, to hoka no
hitotachi ga mienaku natteshimau

unity in mind and in soul
dance for me
the sky is the stage
totally way out of control
and you can free
my mind from its cage
