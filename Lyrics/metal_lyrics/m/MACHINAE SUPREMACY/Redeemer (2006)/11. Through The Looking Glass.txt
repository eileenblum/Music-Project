I can feel the sands of time
passing through the hourglass
and it shimmers in my eyes
as I linger in the wake
as eternity escapes
I begin to realize

We'll walk a thousand miles just to see for ourselves
Look behind our eyes
find our hell
And in the light of the sun we go
Through rain and raging snow
to find the things we do not know

I will go
never laying low
just tell me how to breathe
and I will make it so
You must know
that this is not for show
and if you are not wise (it will)
be your demise

Once I walked along a field
another nightmare in my mind
and beheld the fearful symmetry
Everything was beautiful
even things that were dead
and I surged with violent imagery

I walked a thousand miles just to see for myself
looked behind my eyes and found my hell

We come to honor; to stand or die
to pass the hours of our lives
We burn the silence and all the lies
To fuel the fire inside our eyes
We all go!

Come to honor
stand or die
Fuel that fire in your eyes.
