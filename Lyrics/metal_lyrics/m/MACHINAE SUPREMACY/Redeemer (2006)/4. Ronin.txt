our disease, everywhere I wander
I trail the song of your despair, everywhere
don't you breathe, don't you dare?

only life, do you care when it's gone?
who's side are you on anyway, do you care?
wanna stay ruled by your fear?

I don't know what it is that binds me to be like this,
we can't ever be at peace
carry on 'til we cease

Realize that I would
could spare you
if I only knew how to be another man
than the wanderer I am

Walk with me into the world that waits to be
Here
Dawn the sea of the light that wants to be
Now

Always ahead of the truth in us
Longing to be more than we are just because
Time holds a candle for each of us
Don't let it burn without meaning or a cause
Dawn is the promise of light
In the darkness where we hide

All the world is yours to keep
All you have to do is walk with me
