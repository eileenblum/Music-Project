She blooms like a flower
as she opens up and wallows in the light
but it looms like die mauer
as we search for what to follow in the night

and now they build another wall again

Come with me and you will see
our future in debris
first the sun and now the stars are fading
In a rogue world we are free
we have found the colored keys
but I know that we are still here waiting

waiting for her

She breathes death inside
as we keep trying to nurture her with lies
Now scorched her eyes are blind
Though given time she can recover if we try

but now they build another wall again
