only to deceive the memory
begin the words and bleed reality

(Those without a name) Bow down before your Gods
(this is your empire) Close your eyes
(Those without a say) Bow down before your Gods
(this is your empire) Pay the price

embraced without belief is anarchy
unvoiced a distant grief that beckons me
