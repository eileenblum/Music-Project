I stand still out in the rain
and look up at a broken sky
every raindrop looks the same
they fall without pretending through the night
But water isn't always what you see
another surface lies beneath
Can you see this isn't really me?
no this is someone else
I am just beneath the surface

In the...

And it hurries from my grasp
it runs between my fingers and my hands
it's like an echo from my past
a mere forgotten future in the sand
The water is the tide of night that comes
a shadow pulls me down beneath
Maybe this is who I used to be?
but this is someone else
I am just beneath the surface

In the...

In the pouring rain
I'm bleeding, I die
And I'm crying in pain
I'm bleeding, I die
In the pouring rain
I'm bleeding, I die
And it drives me insane
I'm bleeding, I die
