Ever since I knew the hive
I've been accumulating misery
But I can see there are those who thrive
bloom in the age of Reality

Like legion they rise, my doomsday device

Inside, Somewhere inside
A different light, A different mind
Inside, Somewhere inside
I'd like to find a different kind of you

And in the urban hell where I live
jaded like strays in the street
white trash scattering their "cribs"
no more than assholes with feet

And somewhere along the line it seems
that "pimp" became cool and punk mainstream
