I look at the sky as my own
and the light always warms my bones
but the light brings the dark in shadow
and somewhere inside I know

It glows in the freezing night
the midwinter snow so white
in its celestial path in the sky
the great hubnester lies

I refuse to fail, to kneel or bow
No power in the 'verse can stop me now
Leading me towards the dawn of day
The stars above illuminate my way

My burden an awful load
my chest holds a heart of gold
in the stories a child is told
a legend amongst the old

it speaks of a legacy
one of me and my family
And I burn for their right to survive
to be alive

"Kuma was a hero who saved the world.
The Legend of hubnesters fight will be told forever"
