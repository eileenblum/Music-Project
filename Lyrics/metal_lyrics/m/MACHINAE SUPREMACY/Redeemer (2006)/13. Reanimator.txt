Feel the life inside
a remnant of the tide
that raged within when you were still alive
never mind the cries
listen to the lies
while we're waiting for the dead to rise

while we wait for them to rise

The world belongs to those
who stand out from the rows
of wayward and misguided silent souls
History is shamed
By people laying blame
To everyone who doesn't feel the same

the sun fades beyond the water as we bring on the night

Sleep and fade away (tonight)
Inside these walls we wait (our lifeforce drains)
To change takes more than to remain
Therefore we lay - back - in the comfort of our chains

Sleep and fade away
inside these walls we wait
Wake up to the silence
after judgment day

"I fall asleep and fade away in the dark.
Too tired to keep going,
I want to remain this way. It's better to do nothing but wait.
It's better to just being like this."
