[2011 "The Beat Of Our Decay" compilation]We are the crowd we're c-comin' out
Got my flash on it's true
Need that picture of you
It so magical we'd be so fantastical

Leather and jeans garage glamorous
Not sure what it means
But this photo of us it don't have a price
Ready for those flashing light
'Cause you know that baby I

I'm your biggest fan I'll follow you until you love me
Papa paparazzi
Baby there's no other superstar you know that I'll be
Your papa paparazzi

Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that girl is mine
Baby you'll be famous chase you down until you love me
Papa paparazzi

I'll be your one backstage at your show
Velvet ropes and guitars
Yeah cause you're my rock star in between the sets
Eight bits leads and sad duets

Force and return all the fire that burns
In the eyes of us all take me over the wall
It don't have a price loving you until you die
Cause you know that baby I

I'm your biggest fan I'll follow you until you love me
Papa paparazzi
Baby there's no other superstar you know that I'll be
Your papa paparazzi

Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that girl is mine
Baby you'll be famous chase you down until you love me
Papa paparazzi

Real good we dance in the studio
Snap snap to that shit on the radio
Don't stop for anyone
We're plastic but we still have fun

I'm your biggest fan I'll follow you until you love me
Papa paparazzi

I'm your biggest fan I'll follow you until you love me
Papa paparazzi
Baby there's no other superstar you know that I'll be
Your papa paparazzi

Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that girl is mine
Baby you'll be famous chase you down until you love me
Papa paparazzi [2x]
