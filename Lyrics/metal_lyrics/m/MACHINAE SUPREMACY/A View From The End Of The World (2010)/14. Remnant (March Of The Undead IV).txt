In the eye of the storm
Our brief refuge 'til dawn
Just close your eyes until it's over

All the faithful ones
pray for a benevolent god
All the faithful ones pray for

God, (is) this who you are? Your 'will be done'?
then you have gone too far
Tell me, the sun remains only so you'll see the pain
that you have caused?

There is blood everywhere
In this godforsaken place
Dead walk the streets of our cities

Each day that was one more tomorrow, is a gift
For those who fall will meet their fate
Run for your life no time for sorrow of regret,
For those who die all walk again
