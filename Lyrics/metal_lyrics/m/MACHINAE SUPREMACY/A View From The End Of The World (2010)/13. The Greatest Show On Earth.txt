Friend me, follow, fan and like
Say, what's on your mind tonight?

Just as well when the real world feels so small
We are gods here, and we can reach it all
I can hear the whole world call

Cast a light on the walls and lives of a Generation On-line
We excel at passing time, and we share our hearts and our minds

Oh, how we've waited for this
Art, expression, and shared playlists

Just as well when the real world feels so small
Alone and always staring at these walls
And I can hear the whole world call

Cast a light on the walls and lives of a Generation On-line
We excel at passing time, and we share our hearts and our minds
Wake us up if they play our song and we might just sing along
But until then we won't wait, we have found our own place to belong

I don't even know where I met you,
but the Facebitch won't let me forget you
Though I'd still rather than to disconnect
The Greatest Show on Earth is right here on the net
And we are a part of it
