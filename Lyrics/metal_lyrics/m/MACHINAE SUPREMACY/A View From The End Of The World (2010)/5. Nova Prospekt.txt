Jack in, let's spread some hate
Handout of pain awaits
Oh my, the fire rate
We'll need those supply crates
Stock up on weapons and ammo before you go

Do we make our own fate?
Do we retaliate?
Should we surveil the gate?
Play house and police state,
to keep all those imaginary wolves at bay?

Time for the final blow
Last stand, now go go go
The time for running now is over
You will reap what you sow
Payback for what you owe
No more, we won't just hand it over

Do we shape our own truth?
Do we lie to our youth?
Do we place our own creed
above our enemy's
We tell our children who to hate and who to be

In for the final blow,
Last stand now - go, go, go,
The time for running now is over,
This ain't no tic tac toe,
You will be thoroughly pawned -
You are outnumbered ten times over.
