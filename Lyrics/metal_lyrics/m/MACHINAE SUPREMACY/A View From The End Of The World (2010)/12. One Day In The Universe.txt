Happened face to face on-line though it took a while
Young and disconnected, just out to kill some time
Nothing R-rated first, then something happened
that defied any sense across this great divide
Something real, if only we...
But the space in between us we can not erase

One day in the universe
(No matter) what we do, couldn't make it that much worse
Our time between the words
Wishing that we were
So you tell me, and you show me your meaning
What you do is like music to my heart
And other things

Flash forward to nights on-line and by our screens
Far apart, connected, ten thousand miles between
We were born into fates far from each other
Intersected in time by tech and wanting minds
Both alone with the image shown,
so this space turns into our - our own secret place

One day in the universe
(No matter) what we do, couldn't make it that much worse
Our time between the words
Wishing that we were
So you tell me, and you show me while streaming
What you do is like music to my heart
And other parts

No one ever decided on what we were
Would it make it alright if we define the words?
But why should we even care about the haters out there?
Would it even be like this if we met in life
We can't know for sure but what about tonight
Never mind tomorrow, what about this moment?
What are we gonna do now?

One day in the universe
(No matter) what we do, couldn't make it that much worse
Our time between the words
Wishing that we were
So you tell me, and you show me your leanings
What you do is like music to my heart
Among other things

What about this moment?
