Take a look across this vast uncharted battlefield
You still don't know your enemy
A bunch of pissed off freaks with infinite mad skills
And a newfound taste for blood

We made this life
You have no place here
No right

This is the world you're in,
and this is where ours begins
A borderless nation of thoughts to replace
your walled-in existence in space

We are like sleepers, we hide in plain sight
If you can't see you can not fight
This is a war between our culture and your laws
With millions born into the cause

Now we're taking it back
You don't believe me?
(Force) feedback

I don't think you understand
These are our shores and our land
You are a stranger here
And we won't be idle as you interfere

[Japanese]
"You don't want to understand our reality is free here
We are not your servants
This place doesn't belong to you
We are an assembly of countless individuals
You should be aware
If you intrude upon our lives
You'll have to face an unimaginable enemy
Prepare yourself"

Sure you already know,
that your age was long ago
We augment reality on-line
and you hail from ancient times
