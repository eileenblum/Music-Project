Do you always play warfare just to lay around
With your ass in the grass and your chin to the ground
Again and again every round
Now your chicken shit outfit and need to survive
is just trying my patience and cramping my style
It deals a lethal blow to the thrill
playing punk-hide and seek to get kills

I'm gonna do you a favor
And not t-bag you for your behavior
But even so you and I are far from OK
Your lame bullshit slows down the game

I was all about action, I played every day
But the failed interaction with lamers dismayed
Eroded the appeal of the game
These days I play for one and one reason alone
I'm here to practice muh stabbin' on pissants who prone
I always got the most knife kills
Check your killcam to review my skills

Are you afraid of a showdown
(Rather) shoot in the back than react face to face
It's not our fault that you're slow
now be a good bitch and die before you go
