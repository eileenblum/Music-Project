I know that I'm not meant to kill this indiscriminately,
but I get a bit bit carried away by the sounds of pain

What I may never know is the place of the maze
in which I would have erased some fucking fairies from space
I neglected to ask before I killed the last dairy farmer who knew
I wish I had waited for you
I wish I could invoke some better part of me
I know I'm supposed to be all "the one", but I have too much fun killing everyone
I came here to play, now could you come out and stay
so I can kill and away you to gods you pray to and never look back.

I know that all these NPCs don't pose a threat to me
But I gotta kill kill something right now and this'll have to do
