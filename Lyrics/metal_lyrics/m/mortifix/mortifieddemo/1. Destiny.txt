[Music: R. Sterling, T. Taylor, lyric: R. Sterling]

Tyranny runs rampant
In a world that full of deceit
Tyranny runs rampant
In a world that's so concrete
For the sins of all the present and past
Will be laid upon this worldly mass
For people who live in terror and pain
Who don't understand that life's no gain

Tyranny runs rampant
In a world that full of lust
Tyranny runs rampant
In a world that dares distrust
The true word of God
Who came in one name
Who walked this earth
And was slain
Before people's lives
Were damned to hell
Until Jesus came
Unlocked the cell

Times are changing
Very drastically
For the people who don't see
Their own reality
For the sins of the world
Will be out cast
And the heavenly kingdom
Will be seen at last
Millions of Christians
Will receive God's gift
Everlasting life
For those who have ripped
The pages of their untold uncertainly
Have written pages of their own destiny

[Solo: S. Simpson]

Everlasting life
For those who have ripped
The pages of their untold uncertainly
Have written pages of their own destiny
