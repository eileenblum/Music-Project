[Music: S. Simpson, T. Taylor, lyric: S. Simpson, S. Hollingsworth]

Until the day I die
I'll never forget the pain
My haunting childhood stalks me
Drives my subconscious insane

The scars that were left
The hatred he bestowed
For the rest of my dying days
I'll carry this heavy load

When I was young
And ignorant
I tried to mature
Still they oppress
Now their toll has left my in this mess
I should regress
Siblings they cared less
I try to forget
The memories of my past
My haunting childhood gone
But the memories
They last

He beat me
He hurt me
He tried to break my will
He hates me
He cursed me
I can't remove this chill
She hates me
She wants me
Out of her perfect world
She stressed me
She fought me
From her life I'm hurled

My life they regard
As filth
As if I were at guilt
They won't drive me to suicide
And they'll never break my pride
They day will be much easier
Is they day they're dead and gone
Tears have long since dried
But the pain will linger on

When I was young
And ignorant
I tried to mature
Still they oppress
Now their toll has left my in this mess
I should regress
Siblings they cared less
I try to forget
The memories of my past
My haunting childhood gone
But the memories
They last

I will not conform
I will not submit
I will not yield

I will live my life
With or without you
My scars will heal

Heal
Heal
Heal
