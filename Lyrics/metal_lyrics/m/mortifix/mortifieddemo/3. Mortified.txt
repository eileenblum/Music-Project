[Music: R. Sterling, T. Taylor, lyric: R. Sterling]

Victims of a dying past
Stagnated world
Will not last
Decomposition of bodies trashed
Wasted carcasses shall be thrashed

Back streets full of lead
The anguish that was shed
Agony and hatred
Of a death that we dread

Mortified
Living on this earth
It's time to die
Rotted lives
Damned for hell
Mortified

[Solo: S. Simpson]
