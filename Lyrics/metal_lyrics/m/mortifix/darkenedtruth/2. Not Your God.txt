[Music: R. Sterling, S. Simpson, T. Taylor, lyric: S. Hollingsworth]

Enslaved
You've worshiped lies
To a face you don't even know
Mindless
Believe what you read
Your life you can't control
If seeing is always believing
You don't have good beliefs
A life been based on everything
That is seen

I'm not your God
I'm just an ordinary man
I live my life
Like anyone
So many battles
I haven't won
I'm not your God
I'm just an ordinary man
I live my life
Like anyone
So many battles
I haven't won

Depraved of unknown facts
An ignorant naÃ¯ve tool
Forgotten a buried intellect
Playing the media's fool
If wisdom comes with age
You better grow up fast
Know what you know
Or you'll never last

I'm not your God
I'm just an ordinary man
I live my life
Like anyone
So many battles
I haven't won
I'm not your God
I'm just an ordinary man
I live my life
Like anyone
So many battles
I haven't won

Can you believe?
That what you see
It isn't real
Because from what is seen
Isn't true
Obsessed with the things we say and do
Media dressed up in
Their fucking lies
Truth unacknowledged
Cut down to size

[Solo: S. Simpson]

Enslaved
You've worshiped lies
To a face you don't even know
Mindless
Believe what you read
Your life you can't control
If seeing is always believing
You don't have good beliefs
A life been based on everything
That is seen

I'm not your God
I'm just an ordinary man
I live my life
Like anyone
So many battles
I haven't won
I'm not your God
I'm just an ordinary man
I live my life
Like anyone
So many battles
I haven't won
