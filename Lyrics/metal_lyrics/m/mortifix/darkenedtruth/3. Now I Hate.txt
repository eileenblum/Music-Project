[Music: R. Sterling, S. Simpson, T. Taylor, lyric: S. Hollingsworth]

Go
Brutalized in an early time
Harbored hate
All was mine
Spreading like some dark disease
In my mind killing with such ease
Never knew I could hate
Psychosomatic all too late
Parents inbreed beating frenzy
Serial killer their deaths I envied

Now I hate
Tormented soul
Now I hate
Your life I stole
Feeling like I lived two lives
One I'm normal
Two they die
Doesn't seem it's really me
Looking back it's a twisted dream
Wonder why I like to kill?
Could it be I'm mentally ill?
Killed my parents
They almost killed me
Twisted, diluted
Dark prodigy

Now I hate
Tormented soul
Now I hate
Your life I stole
Hate

I can't stop
This killing machine
Blind to hate I've seen

[Solo: S. Simpson]

Now I hate
Tormented soul
Now I hate
Your life I stole
Hate
