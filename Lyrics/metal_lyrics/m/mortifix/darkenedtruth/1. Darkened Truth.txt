[Music: R. Sterling, S. Simpson, T. Taylor, lyric: S. Hollingsworth]

Fathers of my country
Sent a calling card today
Congratulations, green's your color
I'm shipped ten leagues away
Killing families shed no tears
My soul's as black as pitch
Sam's made a killing machine of me
Adds color to the myth

Spreading fear
In my name
Innocence lost
Never the same
Corrupting my morals
Destroying my youth
Can you deny it?
The darkened truth

Bloodless, soulless
Weak from death
So many loved ones fall
All goodbyes have now been said
But I don't heed my call
Once I played the citizen's part
Careless in my life
Now I live so close to death
Put through this pain and strife

Spreading fear
In my name
Innocence lost
Never the same
Corrupting my morals
Destroying my youth
Can you deny it?
The darkened truth

Why must I die?
For my country's pride
Freed now at last

[Solo: S. Simpson]

Spreading fear
In my name
Innocence lost
Never the same
Corrupting my morals
Destroying my youth
Can you deny it?
The darkened truth
