[Music: R. Sterling, T. Taylor, lyric: S. Hollingsworth]

Pledge allegiance to the flag
Colored symbol
Of our unity
Watch them now
The colors fade
Hold these truths to be self-evident
That all men are created equal
Or is it lies on which this country's made
It doesn't matter what we're made of
Color skin or where we came from
Just as long as you know what's right
Watch my brothers beaten and burned
Equality should be born not learned
When will it end?
It can't remain the same

Bigotry prejudice hatred running deep
Paying all the prices for the vices we keep
Dividing our cultures pulls society apart
Unite all the masses
Before we fall apart
Power in numbers strengthens us all
United we stand
Divided we fall
Work to together to better our community
Help one another
Do it all with unity

Looking back on so many years
Manifest destiny
Trail of fear
A genocide
Callous to a whole race
How can we barely go on living?
Infected morals
A hate sustaining
How can it die when it's filling your soul?
Killing a man for his pigment
Your 'cause and argument so illegitimate
A closed mind
Peace will never find

Bigotry prejudice hatred running deep
Paying all the prices for the vices we keep
Dividing our cultures pulls society apart
Unite all the masses
Before we fall apart
Power in numbers strengthens us all
United we stand
Divided we fall
Work to together to better our community
Help one another
Do it all with unity

Hundreds of years
Kept hidden within captivity
A product of our self-made insanity
Insanity

[Solo: S. Simpson]

Bigotry prejudice hatred running deep
Paying all the prices for the vices we keep
Dividing our cultures pulls society apart
Unite all the masses
Before we fall apart
Power in numbers strengthens us all
United we stand
Divided we fall
Work to together to better our community
Help one another
Do it all with unity
