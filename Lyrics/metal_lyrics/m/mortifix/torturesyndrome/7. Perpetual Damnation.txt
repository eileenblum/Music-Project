[Music: R. Sterling, T. Taylor, lyric: R. Sterling, S. Hollingsworth]

Holocaust divine
Impaling the week
Evil armies to rise again
Have met their defeat
Taking over the apocalypse
Leaders find such scorn
Bodies lie in a dead sea of red
Where evils were warned

Guilty is tortured
Preying in the mind
Understanding the reason he died
For the sins of mankind
King leading the regimens
To the cross ahead
Crucifying their legions
Evils have fled

Destroying all nations

Unseen abominations
Destroying foundations
Wars of desecration
Perpetual damnation

[Solo: T. Edminster]

Darkness stalks what's in their mind
Pain and torture
Now confined
Evil and hatred
Had deceived
Perpetual damnation
On the eve
Destruction that they
Now must face
To be the fallen of God's grace
Commands of the book destroyed their lives
Of the lost ones that this price
Defined

Guilty is tortured
Preying in the mind
Understanding the reason he died
For the sins of mankind
Taking over the apocalypse
Leaders find such scorn
Bodies lie in a dead sea of red
Where evils were warned

Destroying all nations

Unseen abominations
Destroying foundations
Wars of desecration
Perpetual damnation
