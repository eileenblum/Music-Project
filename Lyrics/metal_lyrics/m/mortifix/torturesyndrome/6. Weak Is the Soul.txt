[Music: R. Sterling, T. Taylor, M. Elsner, T. Edminster, lyric: S. Hollingsworth]

What is this?
Some sick disease?
Why does such stupid things
Come to you with such ease
Always thinking of your self
Never needed you
Or your twisted help

Impurity
Weak is the soul
Too shallow to see
Weak is the soul

Still there's nothing
I could say
To justify your actions
You've got to have it your way
Belittle people
Just to gain
And if I had my way
I'd cause you serious pain

Impurity
Weak is the soul
Too shallow to see
Weak is the soul

Time after time
You perpetuate your need
To work off other's blood and sweat
You play so naÃ¯ve
I cannot stand it
It's gone on too long
You deserve to fucking die
It's where you belong
Time after time
You've best quoted this creed
"To thine own self be true"
And to your self-greed

[Solo: T. Edminster]

Integrity
Weak is the soul
Too shallow to see
Weak is the soul

Now I've crossed the final road
Such a shame
What a waste
But really that's how it goes
Beaten down
For so long
Now you see
That you're wrong
So wrong

Now I take your soul
