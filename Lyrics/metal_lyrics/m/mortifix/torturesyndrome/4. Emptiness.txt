[Music: R. Sterling, T. Taylor, M. Elsner, T. Edminster, lyric: S. Hollingsworth]

I have nothing
Nothing but bitterness
You have taken
Everything of me

Life that scorned me
Emptiness

This rejection
It will build the walls
Of contempt
So much higher
No more promises
That you'll never keep

I tried it all
Once more to fail
Can't go on
Anymore
Said I should trust
This is forever
Now I know
It was never

[Solo: T. Edminster]

Wanted to believe
Live in happiness
Was tormented
Now just living in a lie
Hate just knowing
What might have been
How did I get here?
This hell I'm in
I live in solitude
That you have made
Cannot trust anymore
Agony all I know
Despise you forever
I won't forget

Forced to exist in this solitude known life
Torment all I see
I know I'll never live unless
In emptiness
