[Music: R. Sterling, T. Taylor, M. Elsner, T. Edminster, lyric: S. Hollingsworth]

Darkness
Totally ripped apart
Intensely bruised and beaten
Just for start
Asphyxiation
Slowly becomes imminent
Torment has I feared become
Permeant
Paralyzed
Gripped with fear
Body found
Lying here

Drenched
In a pool of blood
Evening the score
Just one
Drowned in a bloody sea
Nightmare becomes reality
Atrophize
Your own life

Living in this
Nightmare destruction

Deep in the dark recesses of the mind
Lies the key
To consciousness
Buried in my thoughts so deep

[Solo: T. Edminster]

I'm gone
Burial now the only step
Dead and gone and no one left has wept
Forgotten
Just another corpse
Laid to rest let nature take its course
Decomposition
Rot away
Resting here
Through the days
Gone now
Never more to live
Nothing more I have no more to give

Living in this
Nightmare destruction
