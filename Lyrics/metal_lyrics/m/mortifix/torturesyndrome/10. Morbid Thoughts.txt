[Music: R. Sterling, T. Taylor, lyric: S. Hollingsworth]

Decayed
From the depths of my inner being
I have nothing left
Nothing more
To lose
In life

Wonder why
I always lose
That is why I try so hard
I always feel I'll never
Win
I lose

So great
Is the desire
To expire
Now on
With my
Final
Breath
I must
End
This

I kill myself
I take my life
Trying and trying so hard
That's why I decide to
Die

So unless are
These breaths I take
My life
Runs out in a gasp
Of red upon the floor
End it now
This twisted life

I never wanted it to end like this
I never wanted to live

Take my soul
Take my soul
Take my soul
