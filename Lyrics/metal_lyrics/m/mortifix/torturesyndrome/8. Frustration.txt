[Music: R. Sterling, T. Taylor, lyric: S. Hollingsworth]

Torn and suffered
Breaking the back
Taking an unwanted load
Pushed down and pushed round
Ego's been burned down
Feeling my temples explode
Taking the bullshit from ignorant fools
Back of my head feeling pain
All I can feel is the hate
Of this world gone fucking insane

Hate
Frustration
Pain
Frustration

Unrelenting a brutal place
No intellect in which to bond
Naivety friendly and feeling no pity
Ignorance and beyond
Dying to stay you can't go away
Politics of the greed
Nothing you're left with
Simple point is
It's something that you all fucking need

Hate
Frustration
Pain
Frustration

Bow to the fucking hate

Corporation controlling you
Masters your emotions
Wouldn't be nice
To tell 'em straight
And shove them their promotion
Coming close to a day when life just ends so fast
What's more important?
Your fucking job
Or how long your life lasts?

Hate
Frustration
Pain
Frustration
