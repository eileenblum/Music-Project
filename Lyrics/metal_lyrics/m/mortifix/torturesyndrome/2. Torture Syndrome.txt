[Music: R. Sterling, T. Taylor, D. Williams, T. Edminster, lyric: S. Hollingsworth]

Throughout time
Generations pass
Through the millennia
I will always last
Canât you see?
I will always be
No one knows
Iâm set free

I will never die
I was born to kill
Silent pleasure
Torture in your misery
I will never die
I was born to kill

Living roles of life and death
Addicted to this man-made plague

I will never die
I was born to kill
Silent pleasure
Torture in your misery
I will never die
I was born to kill

Chemically dependent
Embodiment of self-created hell
Centralized cerebral atrophy
Synthetic added natural decay
As it rips up my spine
Into my cerebral cortex
Ripping and tearing its way
Back to my soul

Living through extinction
Mind and body, soul
Sacrifice reality
Deception is the goal
Ripping through my body
Taking mind and essence, soul
This is my reality
This is torture syndrome
So I kill
Murder
Kill, I canât stand it anymore

[Solo: T. Edminster]

I kill
