[Music: R. Sterling, T. Taylor, D. Williams, T. Edminster, lyric: S. Hollingsworth]

Mind erosion
Now begins
Because you never lived like this before
So callous in your indifference
Never seeing all this malevolence
Your kind is never used to dealing
With this special
Breed of personalized malice
You think you've saved yourself
From all this injustice breaded bigotry
And self-imposed delirium

Jester in a court of lies
Time to cut you down to size
Purged of your ignorance

Now your
Hacked away
Viciously displayed
As another victimized
Virgin soul
So purified
In your deception seems
The most important goal
Your kind is never used to
Dealing with this bred of violence
That you can't ignore
As you're aware
Our intolerance shall not be ignored

Suffer the weak
Shatter the young
Now you succumbed
To our sick experiments
We need
We breed
We seed
The brutal thoughts
Contorted visions dancing through your brain
So second thoughts
You'll never have them
The apathy and bigotry
Are chemically
Killing your loved ones
What drives you on?
To destroy yourself
Why must it be this madness?
Does it haunt you?
Twisted morbid visions that come to be
And I know the mangled body of your friend must
Be a terrible sight to see

You enter the real
You see time won't stand still

[Solo: T. Edminster]

You enter the real
You see time won't stand still

Mind erosion
Now it ends
Because you never lived like this before
Desensitized
To the brutal devastation
Human race's final days
Your kind will suffer
In malignant pools
Catastrophic in the very end
You're just a victim now
Of all this injustice breaded bigotry
And self-imposed delirium

Suffer the weak
Shatter the young
Now you must
Enter
