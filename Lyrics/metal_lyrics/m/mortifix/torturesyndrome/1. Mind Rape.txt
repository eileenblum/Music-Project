[Music: R. Sterling, T. Taylor, lyric: S. Hollingsworth]

Bow before me now
Fall unto your knees
Now you'll taste the bitter fruit
Of your own misery
Taste the steel
So soon you'll feel
Incisions cut so clean
Revenge is a dish best served cold
The coldest blood I bleed

Chorus
I'm sick of this mind-rape
You fuck with me
Mistake
You'll suffer
Physically
I'm sick of this mind-rape
You fuck with me
Mistake
I've suffered
Mentally

Here it comes the brutal revenge
Planned for all these years
Slowly committing torturous acts
Of sadism and fear
It's always said, "What goes around will surely come around".
Oh, such an ironic thought as your life's blood floods the ground
Suck this
You bastard
Dying faster
Suck this
You bastard
Dying faster

Sadistic
Brutal rage
Mind-rape
Mind-rape

You will never ever, ever, ever
Do this again
I will watch you suffer and
That is not the end
So many things I'll do to you
For the ones you've done for me
I will watch you die
No one will hear you
Scream
Bow to me
Fall to your knees
Soon to suffer
Bathed in acid
Drawn and quartered
Burned alive
Too many ways to die
Hate me
Fear me
Hate me
Fear me

So many ways to watch you suffer
Pedophiles should die
And when you draw the last breath
You'll know the reason why
Time to act 'cause talk is cheap
And now I shall proceed
An hour of torture for a year of pain
Thirteen is all I need
Mind-rape
Mind-rape
Mind-rape
