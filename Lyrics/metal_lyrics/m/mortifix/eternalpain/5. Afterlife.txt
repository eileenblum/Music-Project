[Music: R. Sterling, S. Simpson, K. Avant, lyric: S. Hollingsworth]

Times up
The sands of time have ceased
Season for eternal sleep
Prematurely ended has my life
What a horrid way to die

Could this be the end?
Is this where all souls rest?
Pain it now subsides
In afterlife

The edge my life it seemed to stay
At last I feel
But I feel the other way
Plunged into the darkest void
Now I rest
Is this my final reward?

Just a child when I found the gun
One more statistic
So rest one more son

Afterlife
Is this real?
What senses left have I to feel?
Now it seems
Time has come
My life was good when said and done
I ascend to the light
It takes my soul to destiny

[Solo: S. Simpson]

Could this be the end?
Is this where all souls rest?
Pain it now subsides
In afterlife
