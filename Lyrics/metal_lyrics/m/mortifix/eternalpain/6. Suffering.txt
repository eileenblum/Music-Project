[Music: R. Sterling, S. Simpson, K. Avant, lyric: S. Hollingsworth]

Old clichÃ© again
It seems like
It's some kind of dark friend
Let's begin
With the way that you misused my trust
You deceived
I can't believe I was just so naÃ¯ve
Cannot heal
Because you make me feel I'm

Insignificant again
I'm suffering within
I contemplate the end
I'm suffering

Because of you
I can no longer believe in myself
Or life
Or sense of my happiness
I regress
Into a cold callous consciousness
Cannot hide
These emotions just won't subside

Insignificant again
I'm suffering within
As I contemplate the end
I'm suffering
I can't feel life

[Solo: R. Sterling]

No love
No life
An empty shell filled with apathy
Can't you see?
That trust only leads to your misery
I'll hate
You forever for what you have done
Because
I'll always feel

Insignificant again
I'm suffering within
As I contemplate the end
I'm suffering within

I hate you
I hate you
I hate you
