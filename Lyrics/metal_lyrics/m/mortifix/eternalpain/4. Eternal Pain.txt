[Music: R. Sterling, S. Simpson, T. Taylor, lyric: S. Hollingsworth]

Pushed back and forth
Pushed all around
Built up your confidence
Just tore it down
No true emotions
Only hatred allowed
Mind twisted numb with pain
Dreams fray my sanity control reality
Chained in the dark room again
Words being spoken yet no one will hear
Swollen eyes blind with tears

No more
Baseball or tinker toys
Submit to me or I'll destroy
Your feeble life I gave to you
Your debt to me is over due
With these words my mind so disarrayed
Subjected to eternal pain

Do they love?
Or do they hate?
My life living painfully was not my mistake
What did I do to be punished this way?
Beaten and bruised happened every day
Now try to live turn this cruel pain around
It seems that my happiness will never be found
Never I'll forgive this injustice you've done
Except from the end of my gun

No more cowboys
Or Robin Hood
Your parents' job misunderstood
Your feeble life I gave to you
Your debt to me is over due
With these words my mind so disarrayed
Subjected to eternal pain

Touch me once again
And I will split your fucking skull
Tortured me for thirteen years
I've got to break your bones
Never thought I'd be praying to die
Can you tell me the answers please tell me why?

Uncontrolled
Malicious, fowl such cruel intent
Twisted minds
A psyche truly warped and bent
I bleed, I need to be freed from this sorrow
Can I escape this horror?

[Solo: S. Simpson]

Eternal pain reigns
