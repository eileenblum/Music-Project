[Music and lyric: John Sykes Johnson]

Wake up
The gunfire is in your front yard
Hate is the only power
There is nothing you can do
The cries of an abandoned child
Is a low priority with your next fix
There is nothing left to give
Your angel of mercy
Will not relieve the bitter pain
Of this collapsing society
There is nowhere left to turn
Our father who is now your uncle
He wants to tell you what to do
Individuality has been assimilated
There is no one left to trust
Suicide is no longer an out
You must learn to read and buy a gun
This is your last chance
No one is keeping score now
The people have become a riot
