[Music: R. Sterling, S. Simpson, K. Avant, lyric: S. Hollingsworth]

Welcome to the end

Denied
Welcome to the end of existence
Yes
That's what I see
For years I've lived courageous to end so tragically
I've lived
I loved
To live or to die is my right
They care, who cares
Who let them decide to?

Deny
The right
To live in peace

Surround and medicate me
To help prolong my years
Live a shell of former self
My atrophy is near
Decided
My future
Who are you some God?
Who gave you such power?
Who let you decide to?

Deny
The right
To live in peace

Oh, how I would wish
That you could live
The remainder of your life like this
Brittle and old
Left in the cold
Elderly but you're treated like some kid
With everything said
I wish I were dead
Than to go on living
Like this

[Solo: S. Simpson]

Deny
The right
To live in peace

Welcome to the end!
