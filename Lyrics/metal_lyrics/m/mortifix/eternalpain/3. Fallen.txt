[Music: R. Sterling, S. Simpson, K. Avant, lyric: S. Hollingsworth]

Thoughts frozen
Will possessed
Depression reigns
Individuality but to what ends
Screaming uphold your rights
Hypocrisy
Control you if they can just slavery

Murder the cover up
Federal pain
Mind numbed and broken down
For their gain
Preaching to the world
How insane
Assassins sent for him
But first they say

Chorus
You have fallen out of life
Now is your time
So sorry
That you have to die
Guest this is goodbye

Assassins screaming
Pain they've seen
Didn't know that this
Was foreseen
Victim turns his death
On their prey
No lives, no more to say

Life

[Solo: S. Simpson]

I have fallen back to life
Now's not my time
So sorry that they had to die
Guest this is goodbye
