Hardest thing it is to bare
Hardest thing to be
Stare within my soul
My conscious
Gaze into my being
Always fear just what
I'll find as I look
Inside crazed and
Simply frayed a madman
Beneath the surface lies

Pain
Millennia

Justify my mixed up
World
Justify my hate
Simplify the reasons
To stay in
This wonderful state
Wishing only early ending
With my own demise
Fantasize just how it
Happens
When I'll come to die

Pain
Millennia

My life so far
Is hard

How did I come to feel
This pain, such hate
Bitter disdain for my life
End this pain

Such hate
Such pain
Poenas
Infinis
Millennia
