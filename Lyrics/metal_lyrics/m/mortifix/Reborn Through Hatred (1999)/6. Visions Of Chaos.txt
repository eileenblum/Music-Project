Staring at what was my friend
Horror grips my end to end
Riot takes over the street
Blood
Now flows at my feet

Visions of chaos
Watch the city burn
Visions of chaos

Screaming
No one hears or sees
Humanity
Brought down to its knees
Tragic
How this came to be
From a
Verdict of guilty

Visions of chaos
Watch the city burn
Visions of chaos

Will this
Madness ever cease?
Friends
Ripped up piece by piece
Families
Brutally torn away
Generations
Quickly start to fade

Visions of chaos
Watch the city burn
Visions of chaos

Brutal crowd dispersal
Riot guns now speak
Bashing helpless victims
Violence at its peak

Debris
Of all my neighbors
Raining down on me
Cries of orphaned children
Deafening the pleas

Crawling
Hoping just to live
Exhaustion
Not much more to give
A life that had
So much promise
Extinguished
By ignorant prejudice

Visions of chaos
Watch the city burn
Visions of chaos
