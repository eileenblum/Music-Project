My will dominates
Controls
Infiltrates
With every
Euphoric breath
Simply closer
To death

Controlling, conceding
No longer leading
Your life
Mine to control
Possession
Regression
To deep depression
Taken
Your very soul

Life shattered
Every hope
Is this?
How you cope?
With your
Problems meek
Soon I
You will seek

I am brutality
Darkness
That you can't conceive
Killing people through
Millions of years throughout time
This is how
I take your wretched life
I am brutal

Your soul I possess
Simply control
No less
Your desire becomes need
Your life I feed
This is, this is
Brutality
