Why must I
Endure this hell
Why must this
Be so hard

Inept feelings
That rise again
Mentally inflicted tortures
Morbid views of world and self
Taken to unheard extremes
Broken will
Becomes my life
Seems just my proclivity
Well, you see,
Within my rights
To drown in depravity

Why must I
Endure this hell

Exhausted, weakened
Drained of spirit
Contemplate
My bounds for living
Emotionally raped
Becoming livid
Soon just tire
No more giving
Reaching far beyond the limits
Close enough to
Give in
Madness seeming
Not to break
How much more
Just can I take

Why must I
Endure this hell

Rejection
Fills my empty soul
Staking my heart
The bittered
Cold

Defiance
Bitterness
Remorseful in my needs
Self loathing
Punishment
My spirit
How it bleeds
It bleeds

Defiance
Bitterness
Remorseful in my needs
Self loathing
Punishment
My spirit
Now it leaves

Why am I bound
To this hell
