On your way
Kill this day
Out to find another victim
With my friend
She'll meet her end
Killed her just because she trusts us?
Yes our prey
Innocence strayed
How she suffered
Right before us
Know our will
It is to kill
Senseless random acts of violence

Suffered
Tortured left to die
Butchering the weak
For trusting all your lies
Your confession

Make my path
Sedate my wrath
In the coldest blood my vengeance
Kill them both
To this my oath
Swear on this a darkest penance
Murder and take
Final mistake
Watch my hatred as it grows
I don't care how
The time is now
Reap the seeds of death they've sown

Suffer
Beaten 'til they die
Slowly watch them bleed
No less will I abide
For their crime

Your lives
Are worthless
Yes meaningless
Just try
Some of this
Yes you've inherited
My wish
She could hear this
Just to see this
This time
You'll pay
As you're flayed

Blood begats blood
Suffer
Blood begats blood
Suffer

My will becomes your will
In this
Moment of endless time
This sense of justice
That shall prevail
Your souls now become
Mine

Blood begats blood
Suffer
Blood begats blood
Suffer

Apathetic termination
