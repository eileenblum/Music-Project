I have no faith
In this
Where was I remiss?

Bond of one
Becomes two
Trust betrayed in you
Lived through of such misery
As cold as I could never be

Still I try
Persevere
Through my doubts
And my fears

Bond of one
Becomes two
Trust betrayed in you
Lived through of such misery
As cold as I could never be

Cold as I could never ever be
Cold as I could never ever be
