Twisted eyes that see
A past that I've survived
Never knew how I went on
Nor reasons why

Feeling as if I
Was never meant to see
The arrival of the goal
I searched for endlessly

Prey....
I have become
Prey....

Torment riddling
My soul and every pore
Emotionally wrecked
As I plunge
Long toward the floor

Wounds are mine
Yet caused by nothing
Made from me
Dementia spreading
Through my spirit
Into my being

Prey....
I have become
Prey....

Fragile life
Has turned
From what
Once was strength
Now am I ending?
Is this really?
What's to be
Life has victimized
And stripped my
Dignity

Knowing all to well
That this grows worse
In it's due time
Knowing all too well
Is why this peace
Shall not be mine

Prey....
I have become
Prey....
I have become

Now it waits
Feeds from my strength
It's far too late
To undo what I've done
The end of
What was me
