Obsessed
With a cleaning of the race
Violent
By your nature
Your intent

Racially becoming prejudiced
Cloud your mind on every issue
Hide behind your worthless
Mask of lies
If you were dead
No one would miss you

Reborn through the hatred
Inside me

Ignorance
Running rampant in your head
Foolish
Are your actions words you've said
Kill a man
Just for his skin's pigment
Dealing death and endless sorrow
Killing families, and entire race
Take way their tomorrows

Reborn through the hatred
Inside me

I am reborn

Obsessed
With a cleansing
Of our race
Violent
Is our nature our intent
Purifying and to what ends
Rid the world of your bias
Hypocrites is what you've all
Become
How can killing make you pious?

Reborn
Through
Hatred

I am reborn through hatred
