I am the one
Who stalks behind you
And cuts your throat
I am the hand
Around your neck
And begins to choke

Remorse
Or pity
I feel none
Embodiment
Of the darkest one
Change how
Because it's far to late
For I am
Anger and hate

I am the heroin
That you pump
Inside of you
Turn you life
Into mass disdain
This is what I do

Tormentor
Never the righteous one
Destroyer
Darken the brightest sun
Change never
For it's far to late
When you are
Anger and hate

Killing you
I'm filling you
With anger and hate
Killing you
I'm filling you
With anger and hate

I am the one
Who has turned
Your life into despair
I am the one who crushes
Your hope
And all your cares

Remorse
Why should
I have one
Callous
To all I've said and done
I live simply to aggravate
Yes I am anger and hate
