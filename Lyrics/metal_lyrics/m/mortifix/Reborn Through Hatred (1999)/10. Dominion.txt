Your mass debate
To set things straight
Has turned around
And failed you

Your words so hip
They don't mean shit
Such little words
Become you

This breed of music never dies
Simply grows stronger
As it hides
Join my dominion

This trend will end
With it your friends
Perfect example
Fair weather

Now as you boast
The end draws close
When this fad dies
Much later

This breed of music never dies
Simply grows brutal
While it hides
Join this dominion

Rise up
Legions
Dominion

Now it's too late
You've sealed your fate
In your obscure
Related horror
Music prevails
Bashes, impales
Changed your opinion
Crushed dominion
