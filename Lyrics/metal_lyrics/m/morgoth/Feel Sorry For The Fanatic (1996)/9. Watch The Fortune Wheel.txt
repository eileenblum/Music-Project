In days like these
It all happens again
I'm prepared for some extremities
Survival is the name of the game
In days like these
I could affort a new life
But on the other hand I see a million faces
And they melt away
But there's no money gained

I am still watching the fortune wheel
To take fragments of joy
I am still watching the fortune wheel
And take the first prize

In days like these
I see the sunshine again
But on the other hand there are some nice burned corpses
And they walk away; skin cancer gives it's o.k...

I am still watching the fortune wheel
To take fragments of joy
I am still watching the fortune wheel
And take the first prize

In days like these
I'm in command of the flesh
But on the other hand I look at all the ribbons
While I fade away, I ride the virus lane

I am still watching the fortune wheel
To take fragments of joy
I am still watching the fortune wheel
And take the first prize
