Here we are - back again
The sun is shining now
We have fun - and we dance
And we can see our system grow
No more tears, no life crisis
Our spirit it rises high
It's easy, oh so easy to get the paradise at half-price

So fantastic, oh so beautiful
Bright coloured is the scene
So fantastic, oh so beautiful
We're dreaming, dreaming to feel free

Enthusiasm on the list
We can reach the peak point now
Gravity - just a word - right!
We're proud to be part of this show
Gamble, gamble get your cards for
The ultimate universal prize
Hurry up, just hurry up, to join the army
Of the lucky ones

So fantastic, oh so beautiful
Bright coloured is the scene
So fantastic, oh so beautiful
We're dreaming, dreaming to feel free

Lets taste this decade of happiness
Let it take our self control
Illusions get reality-sized
And save us from the big black hole

So fantastic, oh so beautiful
Bright coloured is the scene
So fantastic, oh so beautiful
We're dreaming, dreaming to feel free

This fantastic decade - yes!
This fantastic decade - yes!
This fantastic decade - yes!
This fantastic decade - yes!
