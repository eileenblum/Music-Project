Imagine all, all our lives
Battlefields of broken dreams
Still waiting for, for things to come
Still reaching for something new
Yes spirit knows, what we are
We cheat ourselves with what we've done
We played the fools, we cut the ground
Philosophy declines we were so wrong

This curiosity it kills me
This curiosity it pulls me down
This curiosity it kills me
This curiosity it pulls me under and down

Imagine all the emptiness
On our elementry way
All emotions out of control
The fear of failure beats us
Tear down the wall
Change your mind, or leave it all
How can we comprehend
This is the life that we demand

This curiosity it kills me
This curiosity it pulls me down
This curiosity it kills me
This curiosity it pulls me under and down
