I buy the world with my plastic cash
I get things done
Life's not so bad in my cadillac
I make things run

I just keep going, running like the others do
I make my way, oh sorry did I step on you?!
I just keep going, running like the others do
I make my way, oh sorry did I step on you?!

And then I'm back and watch the light's go out
And with a grin I agree
Cash makes the world go round
And round and round again

When I wake up my body has it's second skin
I'm all pumped up, my veins are filled with gasoline
A million earned, the next big deal done on the green
And after lunch I view my profile on the screen

And then I'm back and watch the lights go out
And with a grin I agree
Cash makes the world go round and round again
I'm in control

I have no doubt about
'Cause there is one thing I know
Cash makes the world go round and round for me again
