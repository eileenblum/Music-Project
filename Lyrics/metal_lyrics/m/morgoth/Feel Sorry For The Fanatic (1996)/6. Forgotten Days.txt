There's no way out of here our way is blocked
Looks like we took the wrong way
But don't say anything, I know my friend it's not our fault
There's little we can do about it

What have we done
Why are we stuck in here
Why can't we move
I remember the nights when we danced under clean skies around the fire

But then the flames grew high and reached our innocence
We're burned out from the inside
We followed different traces, lost our youth in seperate places
And gave our hearts a shelter
What have we done
Why are we stuck in here
Why can't we move
I remember the nights when we danced under clear skies...

Forgotten days
In these forgotten days
Forgotten days
In these forgotten days

Back then we couldn't fail, we felt so secure
And we got all the answers
But don't say anything I know my friend it's not our fault
There's nothing we can do about it

What have we done
Why are we stuck in here
Why can't we move
I remember the nights when we danced under clear skies...

Forgotten days
In these forgotten days
Forgotten days
In these forgotten days
