I drown while I keep burning inside
My emptiness is larger than love
Turning out the sun in my heart
Gold and glory return to ashes again

Then this dream of yesterday
Make me try to feel tomorrow
I'd like to touch my lovely infancy
Again to get a point of this...

Last laugh
Another day and I keep going
Last laugh
Another cage but never the same

Then this dreams of insanity
Are brighter than I could believe
I'd like to touch my lovely infancy
Again to get a point of this

Last laugh
Another day and I keep going
Last laugh
Another cage but never the same

I drown while I keep burning inside
My emptiness is larger than love
Turning out the sun in my heart
Gold and glory return to ashes again
