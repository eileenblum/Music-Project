Stand up - tic tic toc
The clock is on the run
Still got the taste of microwave food in my mouth
Kissing the sun
Get out
Ozone is waiting I inhale all the first world now
And then I'm ready to join the cueue again
To keep myself on overload

And day by day gets executed

Welcome to this place of struggle
Welcome to the promised dream
Inside my veal-fatting-pet I'm in control now
And then I'm back in my nice home-coccoon
I see it all I see the truth
When my beloved TV here saves again
This beautiful land

And day by day gets executed

But in my dreams - nothing is allright
My little plastic life
It pushes reality aside
Wisdom and knowledge - all wasted energy
My little garbageland

It kills me yes it kills me

Stand up - tic tic toc
The clock is on the run
Still got the taste
Of microwave food in my mouth
Kissing the sun
Get out out ozone is waiting I inhale all the first world now
And then I'm ready to join
The cueue again
To keep myself on
Overload
