Straight is the line, the path is clear
I'm out of sight, but still... I'm near!
Straight is the line, the path is clear
There's nothing wrong, no trace to fear
Straight is the line, the path is clear
Our speed is high, we shift the gear
Straight is the line, the path is clear
There's nothing wrong, no trace of fear

Don't turn around
Don't turn around

Clear are the thoughts, the smiles are bright
Poor was the past, the future is wide
Distrust is good, but confidence is god!
Raise all the flags, our conciousness is dead
There is no truth and no lie
There's not a reason why...
There is no love and no hate
No sorrow, fun or fate... this is a new start
Full speed ahead, there's no need to rest
Choose what you like, you get everything on request
Burned is the ground, and dry the land
Go for another round until the cup is in your hand

Don't turn around
Don't turn around

There is no truth and no lie
There's not a reason why...?
There is no love and no hate
No sorrow, fun or fate...

This is a new start
