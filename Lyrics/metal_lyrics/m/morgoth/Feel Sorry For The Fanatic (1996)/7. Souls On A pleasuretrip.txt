Brave new world keeps turning, our essence is getting bigger
Each day a new chance to make the real things better

Within the days our wealth grows, our journey becomes alive
Celebrate the huge style, still reach out for more delight

Just forget - tomorrow
Hey, just forget - tomorrow

It's all so good now, yes everything's alright
It's just this simple way, that we once called our life

And we love the things so much, all things that we deserve
The system goes down perfectly, but still we're doing fine

Souls on a pleasuretrip
Coasts get clear and sights get bright
Souls on a pleasuretrip
Consumption is our guiding light

Just forget - tomorrow
Hey, just forget - tomorrow

Meat beat references - the key to the lightning seed
And all the preferences and needs, they are reserved for us
This ultimate playground, gratifies our inner needs
Another day in toyland - soon the act is done

Souls on a pleasuretrip
Coasts get clear and sights get bright
Souls on a pleasuretrip
Consumption is our guiding light
