Left in a dream alone
where functions of death are done
left in a grave of stone
where functions of life are gone
crawl to the abyss of souls
in darkness you will rest
the curtain of misery falls
awaiting insensitive death

Suffer life - provocated genocide

Rotting devastation in a painful dream
death awakes in a silent scream
all that stands in a deadly way
it's a message to your life decay
takes our fear and takes our wrath
to await a compulsive death
all you fear is what you see
to await your insanity

What is the answer to a past and glory life
you have no chance when the end will arrive
give up your soul your body is lost
you are swallowed to rot

Cursed to die - in a backward situation
living a life full of pain and frustration
forgotten soul is what you bless
awaiting insensitive death

Suffer life - provocated genocide

Rotting devastation in a painful dream
death awakes in a silent scream
all that stands in a deadly way
it's a message to your life decay
takes our fear and takes our wrath
to await a compulsive death
all you fear is what you see
to await your insanity

Left in a dream alone
where functions of death are done
left in a grave of stone
where functions of life are gone
crawl to the abyss of souls
in darkness you will rest
the curtain of misery falls
awaiting insensitive death
