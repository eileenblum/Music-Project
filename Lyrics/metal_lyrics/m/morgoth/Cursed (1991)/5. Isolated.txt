Now time as come to hate
for your instinct to suffocate
deliverance - just a term to protect
your satisfaction is suspect

Escape to find a distant therapy
suffer the cause of agony
no more - twisted mind vibration
your body rots away in isolation

Your life's ended here no chance to live - anymore
frustration of your soul that you betray - to ignore

Isolated
Isolated

Isolated from the future
will society burn your life
a message from a weird world - is your life a genocide?
unreal is what you see
unreal is what you feel
time has come to defy
time has come for you to die!!

Escape to find a distant therapy
suffer the cause of agony
no more - twisted mind vibration
your body rots away in isolation

Your life's ended here no chance to live - anymore
frustration of your soul that you betray - to ignore

Isolated
Isolated
