Neurotic games are running through the brain
as the paradise was born
an act of desolation - there was no time to warn
the price of death - fixed by initiation
what pleasures of a sin
the walls fall down among possession
a game you cannot win

Minutes of pain they will demand you
this is the baptised bless
to pay the bill to be free
to sign the contract of your death

Join the quest of life and death
feel the cold take your last breath
sell it - to be free
a part of your insanity

Sold baptism
Sold baptism

Conception of a dead to sell
to buy a life without a hell
a feeling deep in the remains
is growing to cut you insane
you can't control reality
life turns into insanity
the game of life is what you bless
to buy a better life of death

Neurotic games are running through the brain
as the paradise was born
an act of desolation - there was no time to warn
the price of death - fixed by initiation
what pleasures of a sin
the walls fall down among possession
a game you cannot win

Minutes of pain they will demand you
this is the baptised bless
to pay the bill to be free
to sign the contract of your death
