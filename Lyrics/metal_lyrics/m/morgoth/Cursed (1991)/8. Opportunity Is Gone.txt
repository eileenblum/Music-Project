This world seems too cheap for us
in coming life there is no trust
spoiling everything we see
to slave the nature
to set us free

Pollution - is there no way
for ourselves to betray
this world lays in it's last breath
nuclear fever garbage and death

We burn down what gives us the right
we amputate - we steal the light
only money is what we trust
the end of life is coming fast - Now!

Our hunger will give the ultimate impulse
death for you and me
our salvation - effect that will exhaust
senseless mortality
Mindexpanding we see what we have done
Opportunity is gone - Right now!!

With fear we see the world turn red
no way to save us from the dead
season of the wasted land
careless we provocate the end

No more wisdom for the earth
this is not a planets rebirth
freedom will ignore our fear
no chance in the end so near

This world seems too cheap for us
in coming life there is no trust
spoiling everything we see
to slave the nature
to set us free

Pollution - is there no way
for ourselves to betray
this world lays in it's last breath
nuclear fever garbage and death

We burn down what gives us the right
we amputate - we steal the light
only money is what we trust
the end of all the life is coming - Fast!

Our hunger will give the ultimate impulse
death for you and me
our salvation - effect that will exhaust
senseless mortality
Mindexpanding we see what we have done
Opportunity is gone

Opportunity is gone
