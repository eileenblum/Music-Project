I've left all the crisis behind me
turned to the abide of the past
adventure dreams that's what I see
forgotten unknown and last

We suffer- until we are dead
a clean life - is what we get

Reality is dropping my way
running and gasping for air
do you care what they say
your real life has to be fair!

Emotions try to check the fact
shedded victims - ancient dead
life turns to insanity
the complete way to misery

From the past frustration
Unreal imagination

We suffer- until we are dead
a clean life - is what we get

I've left all the crisis behind me
turned to the abide of the past
adventure dreams that's what I see
forgotten unknown and last

From the past frustration
Unreal imagination
