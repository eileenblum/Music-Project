the environment strangles the weak
radiation kills the strong
fade away in nuclear winter
final death comes from inside
leftover humans must survive
greed - no boundaries
reason is obscure
the eternal sanctity
synthetic beings conquer
human counter disapears
struggling for a new life again
germs populate the world
no respect in this nuclear time
cries die away
