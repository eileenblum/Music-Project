You have no choice between left or right
'cause your own birth was your fate
blocking your mind, the truth is so clear
a life in hate you get it here
it's this disease you now obey
no hope or cure it will go it's way
captured in a social misery
the consiousness now you see
kill all the others
make them bleed
feel like a hero
greedy about victory
do the work now
that has to be done
create the pain
the time still runs
blow out their lives
god's on your side, be satisfied
when their guts are open wide
think about the glory
you soon will get
it doesn't matter
that others pay
take it into your hand
time to get cruel
for that you stand
slicing the flesh
practice selected killing
looking in the face of death
quit your life in blood
you rest - violent world
you know
death comes for sure
and slow
the end is there
you soon regret
a wasted life
and horrible death
you rot away in agony
and bounded freedom
that's what you see
the other side was too fast for you
the same ideas they believe in too
an ugly bullet
sticks in your head
it stops right here
now wake up death!
