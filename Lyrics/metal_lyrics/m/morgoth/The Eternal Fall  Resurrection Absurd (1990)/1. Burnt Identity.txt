burn your illusion in agony
the meadow of death is your fate
sawing the seeds of corporality
even in your dreams you hate
chronical ferelity - betray
mass insanity - obey
trapped in a conspiracy of cruelty
mesmerized by fear
caught in your masters mentality
to rest your life - here
awaken - mishappen - varsious minds
so afraid his subculture will climb
tortured by a medical vice - endless disease
tragic confusion, burning your thoughts
undead messiah is grabbing your throat
what you believe in is what you've been told
permanent disease, you now beheld
save thyself in resistance
respect the last offers of your life
beneath the bequest of existence
is no reason to die
