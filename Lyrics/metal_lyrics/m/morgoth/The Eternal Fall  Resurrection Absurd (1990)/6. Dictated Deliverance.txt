in times when life is so absurd
nobody plays the cure
in times when people die
these methods are obscure
building the new memorial
brining the truth of death
mishappen creatures warning
misery is blessed
increasing misconductions
these rules to overturn
overzealous progression
the house of justice burns
corruption of the misrule
misguided is the peace
permanence of destruction
security seduce
sedition of nuclear waste
cast into former days
pawnbrokers of the new death
early bird of this earth
freedom selection
the ultimate day
death wishes you to obey
dictated deliverance
no time to stay
delinquent society
