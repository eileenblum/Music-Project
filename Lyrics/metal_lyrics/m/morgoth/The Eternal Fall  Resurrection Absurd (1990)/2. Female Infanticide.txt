Born at the Indian Ganges side
death laughs, because your mum's legs are open wide
drop down, guilty soon you'll be
a senseless piece of meat wich is going to bleed
toy of the gods, old religion's law
accept the fact that life turns into gore
living a life people don't understand
massacred, beaten to death by an old fanatic land
ruined...
decay of human pride
fate
in a womb you cannot hide
so better close your eyes
female infanticide
fall deep - onto the dirty rotten ground
the ship of life decides to let you die
peace they never found
pull out of the warm and lovely hut
father judging over you: eyes forever shut
bones melted to dust, the whiplash rises high
you're breathing out your inner life
humanity begins to cry
megagenocide, mankind they derange
a ritual that will never change
