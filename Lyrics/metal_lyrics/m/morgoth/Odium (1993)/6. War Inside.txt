(the steel way)
You are (worth) the strain

Just a word from me
You aren't worth to be
(forced) by my own hand, no
(howl your life)
It's how you try to release the ability
(and they get you in depression)

Consume your own god
Connect the strings

War inside those head (to never) criticise themselves (but it's yours)
Now we see any way we can return from the past

(war is the way to reteliate when we all discover the lies)
No respect for (the domination) is able to pay this price
Stay (and way from broken dreams) like others try to do to you
Just be you and let your feelings come through

(war is the way to reteliate when we all discover the lies)
No respect for (the domination) is able to pay this price
Torn (our living) blow away

War inside those head (to never) criticise themselves (but it's yours)
Now we see any way we can return from the past
Walking and talking together is (this peace) forever
Why don't we communicate
(hunting and counting the million faces we are burning)
Just one mind, just one way

(war is the way to reteliate when we all discover the lies)
No respect for (the domination) is able to pay this price
(they try to do us in) easy way to drop
To reinstate the (domination they had put us up)

(war is the way to reteliate when we all discover the lies)
No respect for (the domination) is able to pay this price
(they try to do us in) easy way to drop
To reinstate the (domination they had put us up)
