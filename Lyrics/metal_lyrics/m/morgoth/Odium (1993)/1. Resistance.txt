(Life preferred to stronger)
When (wings gather at the site)
In the mirror of eternity
Different colors different (lives)

And we're never gonna find the answer in a normal way
Staring at the walls of life, soon they will decay
Is our life just decadence or selfish style
Are we just numbers in a forgotten file

Justice (distrusting and you'll find) disgust
Using control and consuming lust
Take (care and beware the dark dream yourself)
This will look (from the grim where tomorrow lays so poor)

Black (and your) words (of peace distrust)
(concreting parasyte from in the dark)
Take (care and beware the dark dream yourself)
This will look (from the grim where tomorrow lays so poor)

Resistance - re - sis - tance
Resistance - re - sis - tance

Justice (distrusting and you'll find) disgust
Using control and consuming lust
Take (care and beware the dark dream yourself)
This will look (from the grim where tomorrow lays so poor)

Black (and your) words (of peace distrust)
(concreting parasyte from in the dark)
Take (care and beware the dark dream yourself)
This will look (from the grim where tomorrow lays so poor)

And we're never gonna find the answer in a normal way
Staring at the walls of life, soon they will decay
Is our life just decadence or selfish style
Are we just numbers in a forgotten file
