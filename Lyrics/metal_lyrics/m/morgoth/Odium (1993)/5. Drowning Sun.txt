Land (in flight, quicker) creatures (in the grind)
With (hold their heads), stumbeling around
Sky (in black, figures we're all mutilated)
With cold eyes, broken eyes, (it's just not worth) to survive

Through the (forest of what's own)
(shred the) technical errors
Let them face the fact they're alone
With the drowning sun

A sky in black
Touch the sun
No turning back
Nowhere to run

Don't try to hide from the radiation, toxication
See the sky in black and the drowning sun
(life) born into a (fortress of a) termination, deformation
No one to blame (but) everyone

Back from dream of the one that should not be
I raise my hands to the warming sun
Still so real the [edge of each] catastrophe
The black sky and the drowing sun

A sky in black
Touch the sun
No turning back
Nowhere to run

Don't try to hide from the radiation, toxication
See the sky in black and the drowning sun
(life) born into a (fortress of a) termination, deformation
No one to blame (but) everyone
