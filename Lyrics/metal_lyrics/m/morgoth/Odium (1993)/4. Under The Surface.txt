Deep under the surface of your educated minds
There's a beast (roaming the punctures)
Looks like race persistence

Every day we see the regression
All (the man) just so sick
In a fortress of aggression
Who (get to proclaim) death

Every race and culture
(made us feel we're insecure)
But when we are in trouble
Law is out of (action)

Every day we see the regression
And it seems like all is lost
In a fortress of aggression
Who (always has been the) cost

It's the end of (mankind's union)
The reflection of our greed
As we rise we fall, do you wonder at all
Our reign will come to an end

(knifes cut wounds) so deep
But we still want to deny
That we're just another creature
In the history of life

I believe in (just illusion)
Human is (the just distracts)
Now we come to this conclusion
There must be something deep under the surface

There's no trust and peace
Cause we (can deceit)
All (victory and daydream)
Look like race persistence

The end of (mankind's union)
The reflection of our greed
As we rise we fall, do you wonder at all
Our reign will come to an end

(knifes cut wounds) so deep
But we still want to deny
That we're just another creature
In the history of life
