(growing up) peacefull, (strange to lies)
(deformed) control, Is the power (where it lies)
Now (do you ways), You are (too wise)
(frosty comparison) life

You, who is the prophet
Retrubution for you from

(bring expendable pain, oppression loose)
Seconds become days, (depressive boots)
See them marching
(understand no point) going down
Lost to suffer and to drown

(navigating) of machinery
In what we've ever been

Light from the art of sinking
Light from the art of sinking

So I don't understand why you talk to me
And I don't understand what this should mean

(bring expendable pain, oppression loose)
Seconds become days, (depressive boots)
See them marching
(understand no point) going down
Lost to suffer and to drown

Nothing (changed so cool as) you
Cause everything is all of you
Nothing stands in your (enemy)
Cause (it figures) just the same

(kill the rabbits) to their eyes
(cause the like) the bloody lies
(keep no justice) at your brain
(cause it figures) just insane

Lies or death
Just choose lies or death
