As the eyes stare everywhere
The flood of (lies spells down)
To clean the mind of everyone
To clean it on my own

As the eyes stare everywhere
No seed will ever grow
As my eyes stare inside me
I feel the (parish fall)

(the sad ache) of my visions
And I feel they're not too far
The ethic evolution (corrodes)

(a rapture over) chaos
And I see what this (all means)
(confusion) is born to suffer
The situation is infected by all

I (have) submission, I feel submission
Submission, I feel submission
And I'm a part of it

We're (dominators) to the end
We isolate and we pretend
We rescue and we (don't care)
We make this world (where it bloody stands)

We just know (from where) we come
We (bother of the lies) scum
I know the end is not too far
Too far to help me

(the sad ache) of my visions and I know they're not too far
The ethic evolution (corrodes) in what we are
Now we try to research (from lies we're hardly in)
Now we try to (reject) whose fault all this has been
