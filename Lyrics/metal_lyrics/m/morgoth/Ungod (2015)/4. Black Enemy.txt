[Lyrics by JÃ¤ger, Busse, Swart]

The woods are lovely dark and deep
but I have promises to keep
and walk for miles before I sleep

I touch your face and your pale white skin;
your hands are folded on your chest
We used to dream in a dream within,
the time has come for you to rest

The fire burns and the hate still runs,
the love you swore was just a lie
My inner demons took my soul at once,
far from the grave I saw you die

The world will be another one, Black Enemy
Cold darkness, dead and gone
The world will be another one, Black Enemy
Cold darkness, dead and gone

And will you choose my words of wrath
or will I face your vicious death
In darkness we will disappear;
now we unleash our shades of fear

Shades of fear

I touch your face and your pale white skin;
your hands are folded on your chest
We used to dream in a dream within,
the time has come for you to rest, to rest

The world will be another one, Black Enemy
Cold darkness, dead and gone
The world will be another one, Black Enemy
Cold darkness, dead and gone

And will you choose my words of wrath
or will I face your vicious death
