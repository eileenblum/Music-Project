[Lyrics by Busse]

Black clouds arise,
the sun has left the sky
No lights inside,
the storm has reached the shore
Negation, frustration,
all signs, they point to red
No hope or cure,
feels like my soul is dead

There's no more room to hide, my weakened body is a Prison In Flesh
No emotions left inside except my pain and my distress
All my senses disappear, I feel like nailed upon the cross
'Cause the million raids that I've repelled, they left a scar inside my soul

Struggle, these wounds will never heal
Sorrow, I'm far beyond control
Shadows, at night, they're haunting me
Darkness, all hope is gone

Negation, frustration,
all signs, they point to red
No hope or cure,
this curse is in my head

Running from this nightmare,
there's a fear so deep inside
Every night I wake up in my blood
while I scream out in the night
Holding out in darkness
for I know they're coming back
Gazing into blackness
and awaiting their attack

Struggle, these wounds will never heal
Sorrow, I'm far beyond control
Shadows, at night, they're haunting me
Darkness, I drown in agony, all hope is gone
