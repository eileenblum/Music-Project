[Lyrics by JÃ¤ger, Swart, Busse]

Lost in the dark, a new murder is born,
the thrill to kill, a deep madness is torn
Waiting for the next attack
to become a bestial human wreck

All of my senses decay,
this is the end of the way,
I see the sky falling down,
chaos and madness around

I give it up,
out of control,
I will refuse,
dark is my soul

Voices, they call me in Slumber,
whisper salvation is waiting here
Nightmares endured without number,
awaken I'm dying in grief and fear

The second eye and the rest of my life,
all is bound to this terrible knife
A few minutes for the rush of blood,
Hell arrived, to be my own God

All of my senses decay,
this is the end of the way,
I see the sky falling down,
chaos and madness around

I give it up,
out of control,
I will refuse,
dark is my soul

Voices, they call me in Slumber,
whisper salvation is waiting here
Nightmares endured without number,
awaken I'm dying in grief and fear

Dark is my soul,
black is my soul,
dark is my soul,
dead is my soul
