[Lyrics by Busse]

Born into a world of hate,
death will be my certain fate
War destroyed my infancy,
my innocence and my dignity

You're forced to swap your toys for the barrel of a gun,
they teach you how to kill, there's no way to outrun
Under the burning sun my heart begins to freeze,
I suffer from repression, hunger and disease

Torn and deceived,
scorned and aggrieved

Traitor, what have you done?
Traitor, to the unprotected ones

Out in the desert fields the sands are turning red,
the sounds of war machines, they echo in my head
I close my eyes and taste the bitterness of steel,
just one more shot to be released from this ordeal

Lost and confused,
burned out and abused

Traitor, what have you done?
Traitor, to the unprotected ones
Traitor, your hands are stained with blood
Traitor, Traitor

There is no hope to lead a life in peace,
I know the end is here, may the death, may the death be my release
