[Lyrics by Busse]

There is a House at the dead end street,
a place where God no longer dwells
A desecrated chapel where they meet
to open the gates of Hell

The curtain rises and the show begins,
this hall is overfilled with human sins
My heart beats fast and I hold my breath
as I stare right into the face of death

This is the House Of Blood,
welcome to the House Of Blood

Angels staring down from the above,
the flames of Hell are burning bright
Like silent witnesses they disappear
and fade away into the night

This is the House Of Blood;
this is the House Of Blood,
welcome to the House Of Blood

Shadows dancing on a naked wall,
a candle flickers in the darkened hall
Close your eyes and you will know
this is the ultimate Death Metal show
