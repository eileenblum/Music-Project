One nation, one aim
Somebody to acclaim
You follow your leader

One vision, one mind
All reasons left behind
Adore your false redeemer

This is the dawn of the Antichrist
This is the spirit that denies

A moral decline
You're forced into the line
Bow down before your master

A triumph of hate
Dismay of every shade
A legion of disaster

I see the rising flood
With streams of human blood

The fear inside their hearts
A solid soil for inhuman excess

Desperation and disparity
The perfect way to control and regress

Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
Abominations of the horrible kinds

We are close upon the gates of hell
This is the downfall of mankind

Welcome to the snakestate
The land of darkness and decay
Now that we found it's too late
The world we knew has passed away

Disaster is grown
A violent seed is sown
It's spreading like a cancer

The countries collide
Divided deep inside
A nation with no answer

This is the dawn of the Antichrist
This is the spirit that denies

I see the rising flood
With streams of human blood

Welcome to the snakestate
The land of darkness and decay
Now that we found it's too late
The world we knew has passed away

Welcome to the snakestate
The land of darkness and decay
Welcome to the snakestate
The world we knew has passed away
