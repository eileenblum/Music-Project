[Lyrics by Swart]

Once more into the fray,
into this mass pollution
Death, disorder, decay,
there is no human solution

Yes! We are the enemy
Mass population; mankind's anomie
Delusion guides us to Hell
Wisdom of an evil spell

Wrath is what us all attacks,
death is what us all expects

Fooled by your divinity,
despite all mortal fear
Waiting for your devastation,
end of days is near

Awaiting the eternal fall,
the heavenly bodies aimless crawl
Wandering stars we've once adored,
this day we face the final Descent Into Hell

We Descent Into Hell,
bigoted deceivers, shelter you seek
No merciful fate, face reality,
coward disciples, no one will be reborn, reborn

Reborn

Wrath is what us all attacks,
death is what us all expects,
birth, strain of the future

Once more into the fray,
into this mass pollution
Death, disorder, decay,
there is no human solution

Yes! We are the enemy
Mass population; mankind's anomie
Delusion guides us to Hell
Wisdom of an evil spell
