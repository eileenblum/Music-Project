[Lyrics by Swart]

Borderline possession raised,
unleash the demons from my past
Electrify brutality,
the standing of my inner war

In fear I freeze,
triumph of disease,
vast burnouts I score,
struggling for evermore

Anxiety, despair and hate,
a restless life is burning fast
What you see is just a lie,
trapped in a life that's cursed to die

In fear I freeze,
triumph of disease,
vast burnouts I score,
struggling for evermore

Goddess of strife face me and rise,
warfare against all that will die
Battles I fought but never won,
bloodshed and tears for nothing and none

The craven believer
surrenders to God

Your beliefs in good or bad will be buried once you die
Forever absent, ruins of life, face the mirror of the lie
Sanity and love is gone, find the fiction of God's realm

Now I can see, God Is Evil
Now I can feel, God Is Evil

Enter the nihil, crawl into the void
In desperate cries I surrender to God

God Is Evil,
God Is Evil

Goddess of strife face me and rise,
warfare against all that will die
Battles I fought but never won,
bloodshed and tears for nothing and none

God Is Evil

Reality's strife, now I found my own Hell

Your beliefs in good or bad will be buried once you die
Forever absent, ruins of life, face the mirror of the lie
Sanity and love is gone, find the fiction of God's realm
Forever frozen, aged to none, here long your life is done

Borderline possession raised,
unleash the demons from my past, laid to rest
