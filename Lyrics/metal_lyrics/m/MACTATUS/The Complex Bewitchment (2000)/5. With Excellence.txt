Dark Wisdom Profound
A Neverending Maze of Disillusion
Your Excellence is passed down to you
By Thy Elders

With Excellence : Attack!

Conquer the Darkest Void
The Prologue of Hell
As your Forthcoming Illusion

Tremendous Pain brings you to Silence
Let the Transcending Heirs embrace you
Thriving the Ultimate Wisdom

With Excellence - Inhale Aggression
Exhale Anger - with Ecstasy

Experiencing Norse Brutality
An Ambiguous Vision
Of Severe Clinical Massacre
Submit Forthwind
Blacken the Blood of their Descendants

Crush and obliterate your Eternal Enemy
(Your Pride is lost
in the Chamber of Whores)
With the Sweetest Excellence:
