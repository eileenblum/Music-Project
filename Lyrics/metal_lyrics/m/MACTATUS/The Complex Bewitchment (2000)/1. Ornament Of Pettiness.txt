RED FROM Blood you beg for Salvation
I condescend to devour your Femininity
Maudlin Whimpers
Reach my Comprehension
The Complextiy of Egoism Perspirate
Undivine Pleasure

You are the Ornament of Pettiness
Scapegoat created by Strain of Disbelief

In Solitude I Wander
Admirable Conception
Drain you for Life
And Pour it into Fountain

Having my Way
With thy starving Countess
I am crying the Blood of Christ
The Beasts Nature is growing Inside of me
Licking her Fluids
Abhorrence arise

The Unsightly Prophets
Are slaughtered one by one
And their Powers of light used against you
Mourning Angels Falling from Grace
