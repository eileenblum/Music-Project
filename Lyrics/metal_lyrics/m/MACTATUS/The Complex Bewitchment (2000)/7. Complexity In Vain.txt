RIPPING YOUR Heart and Soul out
Your Existence becomes a Narrow Path
Madness becomes you
Behold the Wicked Torch of Emptiness

Travelling with Sanity
A Fierce Companion
Till Death does you apart

Screaming Hatred
Tenfold the Compassion

Scar the Vain of Thickest Blood
Your own Blood that won't prevail

Struggling Aeons
Transforms Ascending Nightglaze
The Hellish Eclipse
Dark Art Rabid King
Lupus Origin Raging Deathwish

Behold the Lust and Envy of Man
The Undivine Might of Sadness
Bleeding the Soars of others
