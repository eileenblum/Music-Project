I am the Strong, I am the Powerful
A shall be Reverenced among men
As I Possess the Earth
The unfit shall Flee before me,
The Iron Handed

I am the Mighty minded
And I ride the Whirlwinds
Serve and Suffer

Challenge the Wisdom
The Soul of Envy I hold

I feed my Rage and live on Greed
The Awareness of the Flesh drives me
I take Pride in the Brilliance of Covet
I breed the Death of Thousands

Wander a Bloody Path
You are bewildered by the Stench of Fools
Penitent Fools
Longing for the Prince Of Slaves
I will become Death
Destroyer of the World
