COME TO ME, I've got your soul
Walk to the Gate of Emptiness

Search and you will find

To the Land of Sorrow
The Passage to the Kingdom of no Return

The Wintermoon is clear,
The Voices are so strong

The Goat is on his Throne,
The Sixth Throne of Darkness
Beloved by the Whores of the Underworld

I Live in the Shadows, and have my Mortality
Like a Tomb, my Soul burns like an Icon
Far away from Reality, in another Distance

Come to me, I've got your Soul
Walk to the Gate Of Emptiness

Search and you will find

To the Land of Sorrow
The Passage to the Kingdom of no Return

Take Lucifer's hand
And follow him to his Kingdom of Pride
The Glorified Throne
With his six Dogs at his side
Hell is coming so walk by my side
To the Kingdom of no Return
