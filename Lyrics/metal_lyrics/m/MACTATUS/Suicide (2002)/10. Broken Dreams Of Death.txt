flashing memories burning into minds psychotic iam echoes of morbid thoughts it speaks to me
loud and clear ican now see it in front of me medicallydestructed
deperssive and sick not of this world any longer self
destructedsuicidal and mental weakness, frustration,angerand pain
please fre my soul listen ,do what you have to
free your mind,do it! iwait for you on the other side,you and me,foreternal time
empty eyes are gazing throgh the glass of pills frstration as shadow of it
condemned to be ,a slave of this game
what sustains my existence?
the broken dream's everything is gone
take the step,one foot infront of the othe
now! listen! trust and follow into game
everythink is clear now
can't they see it?
it easy,come on do it!
are they here?
try to scream!
can you hear it?
just oopen the door
your death is here!!!!!
