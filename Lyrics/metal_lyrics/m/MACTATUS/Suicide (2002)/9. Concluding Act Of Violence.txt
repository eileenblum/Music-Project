left man a fear of and anger despising the beauty of losing the derning context self
reproach and chaos no longer walking towards clarity yet not surrendering to the guilt complex
sanction from the disorder called for
retrospect no remorse or obligation deeds are  done and completed the unisightly dignified
with iniquity mutilated by the sword of sense and stability lost in the cave of spite gorging
oneself in the pit of indulgence whilst others whimper of appetite the hunger for sacrifice
the starvation for trauma distant from the origin of violence vortices the karma of rapture
hysteria as an element of death the animated fixtures of your enemies taking shape as the worst
of of the all left a man of fear and anger despising the beauty of losing the context self
reproach and chaos no longer walking towards clarity yet not surrending to the guilt complex
sanction from the disorder called for 
retrospect
