one chooses the fade towards death with honour or vanity the essence comes from with in and 
beholds the distinction let after decades of disintegration blackness a frail foundation build
upon an ending life and a never
ending death pay the ultimate sacrifice for fitting in suffer the consequence seduced by 
curiosity admist the haven of laughter cloned by the sacrilegious holder of distinction to 
distance death from life blinded by  hologram
a picture of your dead bringing to your knees kissing  curtains of deception
with bleeding lips caressing the flesh  of murder holding the hand of decay to distance death
from life alter the mani festation  beyond reasonable comprehension opening for doubt and
betrayal betrothal tp the decency of darkness once  again stagnation within the shel no way 
to prosper and  distance death frome life
