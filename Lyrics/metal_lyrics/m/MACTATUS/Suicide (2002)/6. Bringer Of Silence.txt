walking against time
reliving decay and despair inheriting the sensitivity of absolution a leap of  faith bringing
forth vulnerability battle cries from tha above
bringer of silence relice from the living scared from the dead in form of sheep,wandering with 
the wolves giving place  for anxiety in a world of no fear escalator of pain
bringer of silence opening the gates where life is undone inspired by miraculus life glow and
the fluid leaking frome the chosen singled out as absured
bringer of silence a dead of kindness in depriving man of death by an out cast cheated from
years worth of hate enduring as a slave of innocence apparnetly the longing for benefaction
disintegration the blackness of bleeding eyes eyes that have senn craetion of destruction the
bringer it self walkes amongst all bringer of  silence
endorer of the dying
