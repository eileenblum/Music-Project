[Text by Hate Rodvitnesson]
[Music by Mactatus]

I am the master of your dreams
I am your worst nightmare
I am the core of hell
Come to me and deserve your place

I am the seasons I am your lust
I am the key to the secret
Infernal lust to the gate of suffering

In the darkest night, and from the deepest woods
I stand in flames and the sun is no longer there...

In snowless moorland I search for the glutton
And see its enjoyment to kill

I have my damnation I am the master of this world
My pleasures will come to reality. My anger will appear
And my victory will come

"In front of me, I can see thy hell fire
burning in the darkness
My body shivers from the presence of thy almighty power
I am under thy command"

I am the seasons I am your lust
I am the key to the secret Infernal lust to the gate of suffering
I am the winterwolf I am the spirits of evil
I am eternity Into the delicate of malice
