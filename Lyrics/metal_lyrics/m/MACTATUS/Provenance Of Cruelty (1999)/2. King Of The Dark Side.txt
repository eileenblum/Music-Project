[Text by Hate Rodvitnesson]
[Music by Mactatus]

Under the dark night Shine the twisted moonlight
Blessed by Satan I dwell in the depths of hell
Force from the devil in struggle with the light
Soon the throne of god will disappear

The earth will be a kingdom of evil
Where sickness and chaos will rule
They who not worship the evil will be doomed
The christian believers suffer
In the flames of hell for eternity
A black star will shine over the mighty new throne
The lord of chaos will rule

A satanic war is under my command
The gate to hell is clear
Join our dark army and fight till the end
The bringer of wisdom has spoken

Blood will flow in our time when everything is ruin

"Under the dark night shine the twisted moonlight
Blessed by Satan I dwell in the depths of hell
Force from the devil in struggle with the light"

I am one of those who are burning your souls
Flesh will burn and corpses will crawl into the night of anger
We are of those who make you suffer for eternity
For our lord Satan we will sacrifice our soul
In the dark night of evil
