[Text by Hate Rodvitnesson]
[Music by Mactatus]

A dark tower in the twilight mist
A sorcerer that call upon his raven
The night that never comes to an end
Children of the Devil dancing over a dead child of christ

Tears of crystal falling from god's blind eyes
Which is paralysed by laughter from the night
Where only demons and dragons are ravaging

Lost souls on nightslaughter over everdead highlands
Where the emperor of darkness has left his trail
Towers that rise on each side of the kingdom

And the night will never come to an end
And the unholy wizards will put a spell on me
I'm possessed by Satan
