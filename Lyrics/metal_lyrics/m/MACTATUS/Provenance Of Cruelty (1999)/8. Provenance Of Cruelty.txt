[Music by Mactatus]

Oh... darkness inside me, please let me out of here
I can't feel anything any more
You can't hide yourself from me, I am inside you
Oh god, what is this
Wher am i and where is my god
I have taken your fucking soul
Come with me to the ultimate hell

I call the fallen angle to praise my soul

Kneel for my feet
Your convulsive body shall be in pain
For me... you are nothing... nothing
Just a rotting corpse

My hell is here and will be with me for eternity, pray for me

I'm condemned in hell Condemned in hell

I see the macabre dancers unfolding themselves
The sexless dogs await me

My immortal flames stand in front of you
Here shall you be
And here shall you be in pain

Sing your last Te Deum and pray for you sin
Welcome to the provenance of cruelty
