Through your eyes you can see these lies
Retaliation to a nation left untouched
Left in black we've come to bring it back
Sit back and shut the fuck up
A broken structure of chaotic fucks
This sound brings a rumble
I watched this kingdom crumble, to the ground, to the ground
I watched this kingdom crumble, to the ground, to the ground
All of these beings have scattered
All of this has been shattered
I'm standing on top of the world
Fuck you, we are the new race and you want something that's created the chase
Fuck you, we are the new race and you want something that's created the chase
I am a victim of the worlds that's made me
I am a victim of the hate you gave me
Sit back and shut the fuck up
I watched this kingdom crumble
Sit back and shut the fuck up
I watched this kingdom crumble
