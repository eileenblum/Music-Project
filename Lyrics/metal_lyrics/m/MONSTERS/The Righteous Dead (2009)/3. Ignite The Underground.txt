HOLY SHIT!
Two days I have been awake
Not much more of this I can take
I am a giant I'm in control, but there is something you should know
I walk around with a painted on smile
I've got a gun with a bullet in denial
But on the inside I really know
But on the inside I really know
I really know that, something's wrong with me
Something's wrong with me
Oh what the fuck could it be?
Oh what the fuck could this fucking be?
This is your paranoia, this is your pain
These are your shaky fingers, this is my game
I am the first of the fallen man, and I was born with this fucking brand
Welcome to this broken mind
Welcome to this broken mind
This is it, and we're out of time
We are, we're all out of time
We are, we're all out of time
Oh yea!
Born in the sickness, born in the slime
Born in the sickness, born in the slime
Ignite the underground
I am a giant I'm in control
I've got a gun with a bullet in denial
Ignite the underground
