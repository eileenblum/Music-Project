A wasted space I've set the pace
By cutting small holes in your fucking face
This is full abuse of the anger in this place
Can you fucking hear me?
Can you fucking hear me?
I once was a body left in a smoldering heap
This rage did not come cheap,
I've got a plan, I've got a plan
For wrecking this land
All the good in me is lost
An empty shell can only house hell
I've got cuts on my side
A reminder of how I fell
I am everything you struggled to be
I am everything a mind set free
I am everything you struggled to be
I am everything a mind set free
Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute
I bet my life that I am not alone
I bet my life that I am not alone
Most of you would wanna talk this out
I saw your head on a fucking stake
Oh how I feel fucking different about the matter
Most of you would wanna talk this out
I saw your head on a fucking stake
On a stake
Fuck your species, fuck your kind, fuck your world
Your world is mine.
