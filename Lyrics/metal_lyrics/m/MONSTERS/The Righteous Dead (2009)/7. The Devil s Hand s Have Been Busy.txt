We're all fucking crazy
And the night is young
The slaughter has just begun
Empower me, for this final hour
This beast has left his tower
It's gonna take, take a minute but he's never gonna take his eyes off me
It's gonna take, take a minute but he's never gonna take his eyes off me

I have the devil at my back, My soul is drowned in black
My soul is drowned in black
My soul is drowned in black
These hands, these hands are clearly not a mans
Lock up your chest, trust me it's for the best
Whenever you think, your not alone
Look behind you, he's off his throne
He is hatred, he is vile
He has been here for awhile
He's coming to take your life
Empower me, for this final hour
This beast has left his tower
Lock up your chest, trust me it's for the best
Take a minute, take his eyes off me
Take a minute, take his eyes off me
We're all fucking crazy
And the night is young
The slaughter has just begun
