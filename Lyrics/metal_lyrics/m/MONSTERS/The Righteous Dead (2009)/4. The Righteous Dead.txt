Make sure my pulse is a at solid stand still,
Break my neck, give my throat no air.
So help me, so help me
I'm coming for you blood
So help me, so help me
Something you can't fucking stop
Did I ever give a damn when you tried to fucking break me?
Did I ever give a damn when you tried to fucking break me?
You will feel my wrath, This is not a joke
You will when you're pulled in half, This is not a joke
And if you feel me, throw your hands up
Here's a good one
And if you feel me, I'll rip you're head off
Hell can't hold me
And if these chains don't hold me, you'll feel my wrath
So if these chains don't hold me, you'll feel my wrath
I'll force my hate, down your fucking throat
I'll force my hate, I'll force my hate
So help me, so help me
I'm coming for you're blood
So help me, so help me
Something you can't fucking stop
There's nothing left, you've skinned me dry
There's nothing left when the righteous die
There's nothing left, you've skinned me dry
There's nothing left when the righteous die
