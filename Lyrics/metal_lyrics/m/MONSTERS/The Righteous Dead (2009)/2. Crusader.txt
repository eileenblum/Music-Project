I won't suffer this any longer
Counting, Counting, Counting on you now.
There is a void in my chest
There is a lack of air
Counting, Counting, Counting on you now.
Counting, Counting, Counting on you now.
Oh I am insane and look how far they are from tame
Oh I am insane and look how far they are from tame
1, 2, Eat this is a feast
1, 2, Eat this is a feast
Let me see if hell kept a special place for me
A living legend I will be
My eyes are plucked out, I can't see
I can't see what's beyond me
1, 2, Eat
This is a feast
My skin is crawling, crawling on your platter
Smiles through smoke, I'm gonna choke
Oh god, they've taken my legs
Oh god, they've taken my legs
They won't stop laughing
They won't stop laughing at me.
They won't stop laughing
They won't stop laughing at me.
Counting, Counting, On you now
