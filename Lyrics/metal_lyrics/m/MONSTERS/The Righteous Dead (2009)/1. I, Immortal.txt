By the thousands they wait, For what I have created.
By the thousands they wait, For what I have created.
This is a testament, to my legacy
This is a testament, to my legacy
The Sky is swallowed in fire,
The ground is brought to flame
This is world is mine
And I'll stand strong while the earth quakes beneath my feet
And I'll stand strong while the earth quakes beneath my feet
Slaughtered on the hillsides
I will leave them slaughtered on the hillsides
I have to enslave
I have to come to call this world my own
And if hell hath fire, let the fires try to stop me.
I'll bring the devil to his knees
