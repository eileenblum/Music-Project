Competitive mother fuckers I know I donât have a problem
With your lack of control
And if itâs me that youâre looking to fuck with
Well Iâve got news for you
Ya itâs your head that Iâve come to collect
Ya itâs my face that you wonât forget

This is the way it has to be
Iâm sorry you canât be me

Letâs climb the ladder of success

I have no face I have no name (WHAT)
I have little to no fame (OH)
I have to face I have no name (WHAT)
I have little to no fame (OH)

Letâs climb the ladder of success
