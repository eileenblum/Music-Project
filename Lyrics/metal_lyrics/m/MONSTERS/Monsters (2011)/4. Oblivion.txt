Welcome to oblivion weâve designed your very own hell
Weâre here to take your soul leave your body frail
I am the worst of the worst
The lowest of the low
I am the worst of the worst
The lowest of the fucking low

My life is suffering (MY LIFE)

Welcome to my world your skinâs been curled
Oh tell me if you like this
Iâm forever your skin I sever
This is my endeavor
Tell me if itâs pain or pleasure
Time to play in a world of pain

There is no gain just the promise of my fucking chains

Look in my eyes and Iâll give you torture
Look!

Explorers in the further regions of experience
Angels to some, demons to others
