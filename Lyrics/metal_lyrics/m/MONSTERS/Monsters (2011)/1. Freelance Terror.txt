Everything is strange and plain and black around me
Every minute by I said I wish they found me
Every breath I make it seems my heart is taken
Every move I make I feel my life is shaken
Shaken on the floor, left here from war
I said I wish I had time to redo the score
My fists were clenched I tried to jump the fence
Ask myself if the bullet know the difference

Iâm terrified
Iâm terrified
Jump! Now this war is upon you
Iâm terrified

This is all a predictable chain of events

Voices in my head filling me with thoughts of dread

Stare everything in the face
Iâve got one, one thought for this human race
Iâve been built to destroy, built to rebuild
Itâs my strong willed mind you cannot kill

All I taste, is the taste of lead
All I face, is a severed head
