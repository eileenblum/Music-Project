Here comes this worthless man
Eyes on fire and heâs got a plan
Here he is standing tall
Here he is to trick you all

Heâs got pins and needles pounding through my back
Pounding through my back
Iâve got this hate filled mindset
Heâs always coming back. Heâs always coming back

I donât give a fuck if you live or if you die

Here comes this worthless man, eyes on fire and heâs got plan
Here he is, here he is to trick you all

Heâs always coming back. Heâs always coming back

I donât give a fuck
Live or die
