Whatâs twisted, whatâs fucked?
Itâs that this shit wonât let me be

Iâve tossed and turned and thought that Iâve learned
But this shit is set to repeat
My options are running thin

And the worldâs got its gun to my head

Without failure there would be no success

There used to be an emotion in me that would leave me lifeless
And now I walk with the spineless

MOVE

So I grabbed a pen, started jotting this down
Read this and know
Iâm gonna drown

Iâve begged for you to let me be
