Iâm gonna tell you about this kid
Pushed my mind to the limit
And never thought he did
Iâm gonna tell you about his sorry wasted life
Iâm gonna tell you about his sorry wasted strife

Iâve never seen one quite like him

Dug himself a hole cause he tried to stand tall
Acted so hard you would have thought he never felt at all
Clip his wings, see if he can fly
Take a step back, spit in his eye

I honestly doubt heâs really that hard
His fantastic smirking and disregard
Maybe heâs scared or unprepared
For what I have induced the chance of your survival reduced

This is the way Iâll make my fucking point
Break nothing but every fucking joint
