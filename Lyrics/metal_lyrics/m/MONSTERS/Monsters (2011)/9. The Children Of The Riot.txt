Everyone can relate to this
Everyone come straight to this
Everyone who lives in fear
Everyone donât shed a tear

We are the children of the riot we will not be silenced

Iâve got my gun. Iâve got my knife
Iâve got your number
Youâre out of time

Youâre out of time

Youâre out of

We are the children of the riot we will not be silenced

I wonât stand alone thereâs a war around me and I feel at home
I wonât be afraid of the violent choices that Iâve made
In my veins holds nothing but concrete

Distrust everyone my voice is my gun
