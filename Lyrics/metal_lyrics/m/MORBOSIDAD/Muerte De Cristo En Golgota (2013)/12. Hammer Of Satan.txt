[originally by Archgoat]I walked the path of traitors
Bearing the weight of my symbol

Standing in the Shadow of Cross
Ouestening my Faith

Wearing the Crown of Thorns
Watching the Metal eating flesh
My body wept the Tears of Blood
My greatest Sacrifice is pain

I see the Bloodred sunset
Dying amongst thieves in Golgotha
Last breath escaping from my Husk
Striken down by the Hammer of Satan

S. Terror â Drums
Vik Tormentor â Guitars
