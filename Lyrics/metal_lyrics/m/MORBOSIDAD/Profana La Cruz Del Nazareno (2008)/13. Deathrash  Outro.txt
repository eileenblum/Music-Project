[originally by SarcÃ³fago]More a hard core metal night start
Let me torture you with my growls
Making you burst your head on the stage
Playing the symphony of atomic war

If you are a false don't entry
Because you'll be burned and died
The nuclear drums will crush your brain
Slaughtering all with intensive pain

The blood of your heads
Spread in our faces
Violence and death
Are with we desire
Not that's enough
We want more blood
Come up on stage
Drag out your heads
Deathrash

Get out here and destroy all
Killing all falses, bastards
Because is this which we want
This is our message..
