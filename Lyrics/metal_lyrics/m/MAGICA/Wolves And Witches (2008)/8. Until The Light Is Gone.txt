Leaves are falling
The wind is growing, the wind is growing wild
With praying hands again she's calling
Her lost and only child

She likes the gloom
Deep in the nighttime when she is in bed,
A strange light appears across the room
And ghosts stand at her head

You have to stay, don't fade away, my son
Your destiny is undone
This was the day your tale has just begun
So wait until the light is gone

She lights a candle
And prays for justice,but justice can't be found
Just on her own life's hard to handle
But now their souls are bound

The windows clatter
The air is cold, and fear's sneaking in
You may want to run but it will not matter
The haunting will begin.
