She is getting closer now
I can feel it burning harder
She is breathing fire

I'm giving all I can
but still it's not enough this time
we must get higher

She's like the deepest night
Her wings cover the sky and feels like thunder
Is crashing through me

A nightmare spawned from hell
Is at your back and if you wanna live
You cast the spell... and flee

I'll dive into her soul
And I'll be stronger, faster, more

Hold on tight don't let me go
Hold your fear don't let it show
We'll be gone
In a moment, you'll see

Hold on tight, don't look behind
Magic's messing with your mind
But you are safe
While you're riding with me
