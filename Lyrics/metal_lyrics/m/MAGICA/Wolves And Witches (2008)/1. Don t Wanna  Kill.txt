It's getting dark again
Everything 's turning to gray
You'd better find me a prison
Until the break of day
Cause it lives within the meat
And coils around the heart
It grows with every beat
And tears my soul apart

I don't wanna kill
But I have this aching hunger
That drives away my self control
I don't wanna kill
But the pain grows deep inside me
Over and over
Howling, bleeding, I want more.

Please lay me down to sleep
With monkshood on my head
Tie me to the ground
Or chain me to the shed
Cause it lives within the meat
And coils around the heart
It grows with every beat
And tears my soul apart
