You have a secret I know
But you won't share it with the world
It hurts so much and it burns like hell
You have a dark secret I can tell

No one will know the things you do (dark secret you have a dark secret)
The mirror shows your real face ( the secret hides the pain )
The evil dwells inside of you (dark secret you have a dark secret)
And It's coming through
Again!

You have a secret I fear
And I'm not so sure I wanna hear
What lies behind this veil you show
But you have a dark secret, that I know.
