The light is fading
the air is getting cold
And yet no clouds are on the sky
Time is bending
Misfortune will unfold
And all the kingdom is asking why.

But at the end of the day
The master of forges was learning the truth
He has found the means and the only way
For heroes to pursue.

Oh no, they stole the sun, we're blinded forever
Into another world they've gone
Oh no, they stole the sun, we're in this together,
With magic on our side, searching for whomever
stole the sun

They come like thunder
The hammer breaks the gate
And the battle rages on
Heads are rolling
The evil takes the bait
Hot iron through the wall
