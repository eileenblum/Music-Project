I, I'm left alone
Deep in the shadow
Deep in the shadow of my soul
My pain has grown
I cannot hide it
I cannot fight it

And twilight I call
To free me from all

Fly ravens fly,
I'm ready for good-bye
Fly ravens fly (hurry, hurry)
Fly ravens fly
Your wings cover the sky
Bring me the night

I, I gather words
Like withered flowers
In the wasted garden of my thoughts
I'm like these birds
Covered in ages
Of yellowed pages
