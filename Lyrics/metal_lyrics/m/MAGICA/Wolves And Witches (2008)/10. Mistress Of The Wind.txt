You!
Flying above
Spreading the trammels of love
Hear my command
You get away from this land
Cause now I know all your tricks
I've learned all your hexes
I master your game
I conjure your name
Right now
When I say

Vin ielele
And It happens again like before
Right now
Vin ielele
Vin ielele
The woods are preparing for war,
Right now
Vin ielele

Stop trying
Stop lying right now
Defying
You just Stay away from me

Stop trying
Stop lying right now
Undying
You just leave and let me be

The night is unfolding it's cloak
you're dancing in circles like smoke
Immortal and free
Just stay away from me!
I know
Your ways to entice
Nude beauties of ice.
With bells at your feet
You will weave the deceit
My love
I say!
