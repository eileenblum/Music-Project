[Bonus track]

Under the spell
You search for the waters where she dwells
No time for farewell, no ears for warnings or tales
Deep in a trance
You brake all resistance, she's calling again
Your sweet romance
Is waiting for you at the end of the glen

She looks like a dream
Mold by the river in it's flow
A well plotted scheme, laid to your feet, I know
A beauty so mad
It thrives on deception and feeds on men
her magic is spread, seduction and death, again

Awake! Your dreaming will break
In the depths of the lake (caught in the depths of the lake)
Awake! Your lady is fake
Don't make this mistake (don't follow her call, do not listen to the snake
