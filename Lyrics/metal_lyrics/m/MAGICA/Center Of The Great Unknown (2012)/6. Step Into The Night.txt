The walls of history are falling,
Your fright is starting to dissolve.
But while you're feeling safe, embraced by ignorance,
Your life is like a game of chance.

I, I wanna see what you whoose!
I wanna bathe in your light,
or I will weep, as you step into the night.

A new dark age is closing on your doorsteps,
Wrapping up the earth just like a pall
I'm hoping you will wake and turn from this disgrace,
Rise from the ruins of your race.

"You, my son, are to return
To the surface world with this message!
