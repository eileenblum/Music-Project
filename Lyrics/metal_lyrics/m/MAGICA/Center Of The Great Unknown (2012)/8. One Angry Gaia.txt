I know your secrets,
I feel your pain.
I know your heart is crying.

You're weeping for your children
And you scream in vain.
I know your eyes are drying.
But I still fight,
Despite your broken faith in man.
I'm trying!

One angry gaia
Is calling for our souls.
Listen to her crying!
One angry gaia
Retaking the controls,
Is not waiting for
Our wisdom anymore.

You heart os bleeding,
Your skin is torn,
Your seasons are misleading.
You're looking for an answer,
The last forlorn attempt
To make your pleading.

But I still fight, despite the evilness of man.
No ceding!

And I know we've taken more
Than we'll ever need from you
And I know we can't ignore
All the signs you're sending through.
And I cannot hide my shame,
I know we are a blight
And we are to blame
So strike with all your might
