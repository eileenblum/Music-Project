You listen to the seers
And you're crawling underneath
The blanket
of divine protection and trust.
Yielding to your fears,
Relinquishing the voice of reason
You turn ages of science to dust.
But I want to know
And I need to show
I'm not afraid like you.

The earth is young?
The world ain't gonna end!
Regarding me and you,
We're just passing through.
The earth is young?
The world ain't gonna end!
But for humanity
Don't know how long is gonna be.

The new dommsday coming in,
Makes you feel the need to bow down
To whomever promises hope.
You're sheding your old skin
And changing from within all dogma,
Like convicts feeling the rope.
