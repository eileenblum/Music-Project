Long ago, a great divide,
So we let you grow, feel the snow...
But now, we summon our lineage
Back to our home.

Is time to resign your hollow life
Unite our substance will ascend.

You alone, you are the way,
The only one you must obey.
You are the heaven and the hell,
The only thing,
The masterspell

You are the masterspell,
The only one that can dispel
The darkness surrounding your shell,
The masterspell

You must know, nothing is decided,
Your destiny's not carved in stone.
Time flows in more than one direction
But you're not alone.
