Can you see all the lights?
We're under the auroras.
Watch them burn in the night! (Ride out)
We're all sons of the sky
Under the auroras
Our heart together ignite.
(Burn like fire)

Shifting and fading, turning, evading,
The veil of the stars plays it's game.
Spreading threads of green wonder,
Created down under
By a magical light spinning frame.

It mounts and it spreads, it parts and it plays
In a million patterns and ways.
Like a nimbus of glory it dances a story,
Forgotten in mystery and haze.
