Who knows what I am,
A grain of sand on the reaches of time?
Who knows who I am,
A wondering spirit lost between
Unholy and divine

With no fear,
I open my heart and stare into destiny
I am who I am I don't deny it.
I tear down the walls
And fences surrounding me.
I open my soul for you.

You hide within yourself,
Restrained bu this fear of the unknown
But if you reach out your hand
Your soul will link to everything
You will understand.

Let us begin.
Let beauty endue your heart,
Walk tall and proud,
Let's make a brand new start!
