Hear the king of the world,
Listen now for his words are coming out
Like thunder
Look for the king of the world
And you will find him in your mind.
Call the king of the world
If you're down and you feel your soul
Is torn asunder.
Pray to the king of the world,
Cause in the end
You will leave this world behind.

Waiting and watching in silence,
He's sending his guidance upon the humanity.
Weighing and keeping the balance,
He is writing with magic,
Untangling the secrets of our destinies.

With a blessing of the underworld chapel,
The lamb and the apple will alter reality.
The fallen can be resurrected
The evil corrected,
Wherever the eyes of the king will see!
