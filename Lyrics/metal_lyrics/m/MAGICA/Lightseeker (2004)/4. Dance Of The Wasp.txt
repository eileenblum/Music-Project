I know what you fear
But from me youâll never get away
You hear my song in your ear now
No one can save you
I do the dance of the Wasp

I know itâs a trap
But my wings are too tired to fly
Iâm caught in a honey jar
No one can hear me
I do the dance of the wasp

The wasp queen draws a warning
With every beat of her wings
Her curse brings your ending near
With every sting that she gives

I know your desire
And I know there is nothing you can do
Youâre in the circle of fire now
No one can save you
I do the dance of the Wasp

The wasp queen draws a warning
With every beat of her wings
Her curse brings your ending near
With every sting that she gives
