A little black bird called me
And told me I must run
There is evil in this house
Enslaving everyone
A little black bird called me
And told me that I could
Have all the power here
By knowing all the truth
I must now speak in silence
My path I must not stray
Thereâs a door into the mirror
I must go that way
And in the secret chamber
On an old armoire
I see the living Grimoire

A tool forged of flesh, altered by spirit
With a will of its own, all demons can hear it
Iâll sing on and on until the charge is complete
And I will not know defeat

Oh, Book of Shadows forgotten in time
Your magic, your power's reshaping my mind
Oh, Book of Shadows, I am your slave
Into eternity Iâll ride your magic wave

Almighty tome, open your eye
Unlock the secrets so I will never die
Teach me your ways so Iâll make no mistake
When I will rule the snake

Oh, Book of Shadows forgotten in time
Your magic, your power's reshaping my mind
Oh, Book of Shadows, I am your slave
Into eternity Iâll ride your magic wave
