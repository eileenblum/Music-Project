Here in the East I bring in Light and Air
To call the breath of life into my lair

Here in the South I bring in Light and Fire
To give me now the warmth that I require

Here in the West I bring in Light and Water
My Goddess will wash clean her daughter

Here in the North I bring in Light and Earth
To strengthen now my second birth
