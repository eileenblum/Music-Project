Iâm on the Witchâs broom
Now the time has come
To follow my desire
To sneak into that room
Steal the Witchâs broom
And fly higher and higher

Silence all around me
I whisper the charm
As long as sheâs asleep
My spell she cannot sweep
Iâm safe from all harm

I climb on the Witchâs broom
In the heart of the night
I fly on the Witchâs broom
Fly away in my delight

Tonight Iâll fly to the moon
Please do not ask me why
And if you donât believe
Weâll meet on Hallowâs Eve
And ride through the sky

The lightning shows my way
The owl scouts ahead
And in the darkest night
When everything is right
Iâll snatch you from your bed

I climb on the Witchâs broom
In the heart of the night
I fly on the Witchâs broom
Fly away in my delight
