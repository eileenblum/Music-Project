Armies of faeries
Fly now in golden circles
Climbing the Bittersweet
Nightshade

Your poison berries
Put me in ecstasy
The cover of your leaves
Is like a green cascade

Take me to the Moon
Swing me to the Sun
Sing with me the tune
Bewitching everyone

My sweetest hours
I wish will never run away
Climbing the Bittersweet
Nightshade

Your purple flowers
Like my goddessâs crown
Show me the truth
In my crystal blade

Take me to the Moon
Swing me to the Sun
Sing with me the tune
Bewitching everyone
