Leave behind your worries, and then
Slip into my world of faeries
Nothing in this life can keep you down
Taste a drop of magic, and then
Look into that green and tragic
Devil, you will see itâs just a clown

The wheel is turning, the night is burning
Deep inside my heart
Can you feel its agony ?
The wheel is turning, the night is burning
Deep inside my heart
Like this spell
So mote it be !

Place the wormwood in my eyes, so I can see the truth
The bitter taste will rule my mind and I will feel no ruth
Burn the wormwood in the night, to set the spirits free
The innocence is left behind, to fight insanity

All around me is vibrating
Or am I hallucinating ?
Symphonies of chaos in my head
That green vial is my blight
Glowing in the moonlight
You cannot touch me when youâre dead

The wheel is turning, the night is burning
Deep inside my heart
Can you feel its agony ?
The wheel is turning, the night is burning
Deep inside my heart
Like this spell
So mote it be !
