And a curse has fallen on my head
To balance all the sins that I have done
It really doesnât matter how many tears Iâve shed
If you see that dress you know youâd better run

Feel the sorrow in my heart
It tears me apart
Even though itâs not my will
You cannot hide from my embrace
Escape my black lace
So get ready for the kill

The lace will lure all men into my arms
A thing that I enjoy, I must confess
But in the end they die, so tells the charm
On every full moon I have to wear that dress

Feel the sorrow in my heart
It tears me apart
Even though itâs not my will
You cannot hide from my embrace
Escape my black lace
So get ready for the kill
