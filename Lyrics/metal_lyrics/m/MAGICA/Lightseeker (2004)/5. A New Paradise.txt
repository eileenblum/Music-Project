Thereâs a war now in Heaven
You can see it too
I want to change everything
I want something new
But please donât send me away
My dream is not fulfilled
All I wanted was to sing
Just wanted to build

A new Paradise
Out of sight from your eyes
My troubles are ending
A new Paradise
Or a Hell in disguise
Is what Iâm demanding

All alone in the darkness
I am waiting for you
Ready to cross the line
To a different truth
I do not like this void
Iâm falling through
But Iâm waiting to see a sign
Waiting to get to ...

A new Paradise
Out of sight from your eyes
My troubles are ending
A new Paradise
Or a Hell in disguise
Is what Iâm demanding
