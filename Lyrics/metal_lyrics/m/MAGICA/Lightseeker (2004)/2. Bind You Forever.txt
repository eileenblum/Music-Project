Almighty wind, feed my obsession
Give me the strength that I need
To fly above this land of hate
The human nature is a poisonous weed

Wash my sins away in a river of holy water
Leave all my fears far behind
Purify my soul in an ocean of smoke and fire
I ask the stars to free my mind

Follow my will, I bind you forever
To hide in the dark, never come out
Obey my magic, I bind you forever
To search for the pain you canât live without

Almighty Earth, listen my calling
Hear now what I ask
Bury the wicked, swallow the evil
Wipe down the soul of the unholy mask

Wash my sins away in a river of holy water
Leave all my fears far behind
Purify my soul in an ocean of smoke and fire
I ask the stars to free my mind

Follow my will, I bind you forever
To hide in the dark, never come out
Obey my magic, I bind you forever
To search for the pain you canât live without
