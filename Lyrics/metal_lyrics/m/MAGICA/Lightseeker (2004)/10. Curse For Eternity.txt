Staring into the Sun
Blood stops running inside of me
Into a curse for eternity
Chasing the light away
The night is falling inside of me
Into a curse for eternity

Itâs time to tell the story
Of a birth into the other side
In the midnight hour
With a kiss, I died
Statues bring to life
Another world in sight
Defying laws of physics
Creatures vanish in the night

On and on I turn to stone
Like the ages that fall upon my skin
And it feels like Iâm burning
On and on Iâm crawling into darkness
I bear a curse for eternity

Staring into the Sun
Blood stops running inside of me
Into a curse for eternity
Chasing the light away
The night is falling inside of me
Into a curse for eternity

My heart will now stop beating
I feel no regret this time
No fear and no sorrow
For the end of the line
In my eyes you can see
My last image of you
A solitary picture
Of the evil I can do

On and on I turn to stone
Like the ages that fall upon my skin
And it feels like Iâm burning
On and on Iâm crawling into darkness
I bear a curse for eternity

Staring into the Sun
Blood stops running inside of me
Into a curse for eternity
Chasing the light away
The night is falling inside of me
Into a curse for eternity
