Whatever happened I still don't understand
Yet I am falling
I walked the right way
The righteous path I planned
But in vain â

Because
The world is eaten by monsters
Broken to pieces, can't be repaired
I know cause I've tried
I beg you my savior
My guardian angel -
Take me by your side

Wait for me
Please would you wait for me
Cause I am lost in this side of the world
Wait for me
Please would you wait for me
All my dreams are shattered and gone
Would you take me home

It doesn't matter if your intentions are good
They'll cross them
You will be hunted
Make sure you understood
We are lost

Because
The world is eaten by monsters
Broken to pieces, can't be repaired
I know cause I've tried
I beg you my savior
My guardian angel -
Take me by your side

Wait for me
Please would you wait for me
Cause I am lost in this side of the world
Wait for me
Please would you wait for me
All my dreams are shattered and gone
Would you take me home

Wait for me
Please would you wait for me
Cause I am lost in this side of the world
Wait for me
Please would you wait for me
All my dreams are shattered and gone
Would you take me home
