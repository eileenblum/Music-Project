Repeating a song in my head
Maybe I'm better off dead, I'm jaded
I'm cold and bitter and mad
From all that was said
And the light just faded

There is nothing left for me
To go back to, so I will leave
And never look back

And I'll be anywhere believe me
I will try everywhere
You'll find me anywhere
Anywhere but home

And I'll be anywhere believe me
I will hide everywhere
You'll find me anywhere
Anywhere but home
Anywhere but home

Waiting for the break of dawn
Hoping the pain will be gone... I'm aching
Tasting the venom I grow
I'm looking for a new place to go
While my hands are shaking

There is nothing left for me
To go back to, so I will leave
And never look back

And I'll be anywhere believe me
I will try everywhere
You'll find me anywhere
Anywhere but home

And I'll be anywhere believe me
I will hide everywhere
You'll find me anywhere
Anywhere but home
Anywhere but home

There is nothing left for me
To go back to, so I will leave
And never look back

And I'll be anywhere believe me
I will try everywhere
You'll find me anywhere
Anywhere but home

And I'll be anywhere believe me
I will hide everywhere
You'll find me anywhere
Anywhere but home
Anywhere but home
