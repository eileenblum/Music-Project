Well there is nothing you can do
To make me feel much better
Unless in some way you will
Wipe off all my spite

And there is no way left for you
To make me feel it's worth it
Unless somehow you can
Turn back time and make things right

Now I feel I'm healed and I don't need you

I do not need to ask you why
I don't need you to say you're sorry
The truth is better than a lie
But I'm gone

I don't care if you start to cry
I don't even want to worry
You did things you can't deny
Well, I'm gone

Now looking back I can't believe
I guess I didn't matter
Enough to make you think
Or even have a doubt

There is no way I can forgive
I'm better off without
You say you're sorry but you
Just regret that I found out

Now I feel I'm healed and I don't need you

I do not need to ask you why
I don't need you to say you're sorry
The truth is better than a lie
But I'm gone

I don't care if you start to cry
I don't even want to worry
You did things you can't deny
Well, I'm gone

I just want to get away on my own
In search of something pure
And sing my song

I do not need to ask you why
I don't need you

I do not need to ask you why
I don't need you to say you're sorry
The truth is better than a lie
But I'm gone

I don't care if you start to cry
I don't even want to worry
You did things you can't deny
Well, I'm gone
