I release
Release my demons on you again
I release
My anger and my fears, my rage, my scorn
In shadow I was born

Hate, fire, ruin, searing pain
Fate, destruction, chaos, haunting bane

The spirits from below
Are waiting for the glow my soulshard will release
Trading in my days for a taste of magic - be ready

I release
Release my demons on you again
I release
My anger and my fears, my rage, my scorn
In shadow I was born

Try bending evil down upon its knees
It will consume your blood and tears
Like being eaten out by slow disease
I sacrifice

The spirits from below
Are waiting for the glow my soulshard will release
Trading in my days for a taste of magic - be ready

I release
Release my demons on you again
I release
My anger and my fears, my rage, my scorn
In shadow I was born

I release
Release my demons on you again
I release
My anger and my fears, my scorn
I'm reborn

The spirits from below
Are waiting for the glow my soulshard will release
Trading in my days for a taste of magic - be ready

I release
Release my demons on you again
I release
My anger and my fears, my rage, my scorn
In shadow I was born
