I look up to the sky
The wind plays with my hair
And tells me beware
I turn and wonder why
There are no birds in the air
Something is there
Tonight...

I wonder if I should run away
What charm or spell would matter?
I hope to find a way, to make it through
A word that clouds can scatter

Dark veils are gliding
No there's no time to stare
You'd better go inside and hide between the sheets
You all can feel it
There's something in the air
It's magic on the streets

Tonight there are wicked voices, whispering my name
They are now weighing all the choices I took in this game
Tonight you should run away
Tonight...

I'm waiting, the moon is frozen still
My heart is beating fast
I'll crawl under my bed, to stay unseen
I'm hoping this won't last

Tonight there are wicked voices, whispering my name
They are now weighing all the choices I took in this game
Tonight you should run away
Tonight...

Tonight you should run away
Tonight...
