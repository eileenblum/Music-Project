All of my life I've felt so different
I walked the simple way
All I expect is that you keep your promise
And honor what you say

We reach a little higher
We search a world without deception
Our hearts are set on fire
To change your misconception

I will never deny who I am nor sell my belief
I will never hide in the dark like a thief
I will never stab from behind nor run from a fight
We will never surrender because
We'll be never like you

I will never do the work of a liar
I will never turn, never like you
I will never do like you desire
We are not the same, never like you

I am so tired of short time solutions
Reversed psychologies
Your false beliefs start revolutions
No more apologies!

We reach a little higher
We search a world without deception
Our hearts are set on fire
To change your misconception

I will never deny who I am nor sell my belief
I will never hide in the dark like a thief
I will never stab from behind nor run from a fight
We will never surrender because
We'll be never like you

I will never do the work of a liar
I will never turn, never like you
I will never do like you desire
We are not the same, never like you

I cannot stand being lied in my face
We've paid the toll
You cannot make a fool of me it's not the case
Let us roll

I will never deny who I am nor sell my belief
I will never hide in the dark like a thief
I will never stab from behind nor run from a fight
We will never surrender because
We'll be never like you

I will never do the work of a liar
I will never turn, never like you
I will never do like you desire
We are not the same, never like you
