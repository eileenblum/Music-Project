Light my song, prove me wrong
Preach your ways and clear my haze
Smile to me, make me believe
Hold me in your embrace, your grace

You believe my way is wrong just because we're different
And in this world I don't belong

Are we all on the side of evil?
I don't understand
Are we on the edge of hell?
When is this ever, is ever gonna end

Are we all on the side of evil?
Please take my hand
Are we all under a spell?
It's happening again and again

Nod your head, make by bed
You're right, I'm but a fool â you rule

You believe my way is wrong just because we're different
And in this world I don't belong

Are we all on the side of evil?
I don't understand
Are we on the edge of hell?
When is this ever, is ever gonna end

Are we all on the side of evil?
Please take my hand
Are we all under a spell?
It's happening again and again

Are we all on the side of evil?
I don't understand
Are we on the edge of hell?
When is this ever, is ever gonna end

Are we all on the side of evil?
Please take my hand
Are we all under a spell?
It's happening again and again
