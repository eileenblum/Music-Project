My, my kin, my enemy
My enemy

I'm trying I'm sighing
I'm fighting, I'm crying
Explaining, complaining
But it never stops raining

The night is young, the light is dim
Reaching through the clouds
Dark thoughts are haunting me again
I cannot break this chain
I thought that I knew the reason
Of the fire in that place
I wasn't prepared for such an end
Wasn't ready â ready to face my

My kin, my enemy

The signs are there, the swords are out
Shining in the night
Owls calling for bad luck
The flame is to ignite
This time my heart is stronger
My fate I will embrace
I'm waiting for a move so I can stand
I am ready â ready to face my

My kin, my enemy
All I want is to break free
Now I know that they will never understand my plea
I just need to be me

My, my kin, my enemy
My kin, my enemy
My kin, my enemy
My enemy
