Dear diary
I am standing on the brink
Should I cross, should I back off
Again?

Dear diary
I should take some time to think
No one ever understands
My pain

Dear diary
You have been my only friend
Now I also fear you'd be
My foe

Dear diary
Would you follow to the end
If I went the way you said
I'd go?

Dear diary
I can make a fresh new start
For the moments I will stand
To lose

Dear diary
I will hold you in my heart
But for now I'll take the path
I choose
