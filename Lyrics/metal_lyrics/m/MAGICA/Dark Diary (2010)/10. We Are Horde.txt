I live all my days the way I want
Don't try to fight me
Don't try to taste all my ways
You cannot
And don't try to find me
Don't bother

Oh, we're coming!
Oh...

We're like the whirlwind
Like volcanoes we all rise
We are power, we are courage
We are wise
Like an avalanche
Like wildfire we all soar
We are power, we are courage
We're more than meets the eye
We are Horde

Behind my back your eyes still curse
Yet you won't face me
You don't dare to confront a different mind
You won't embrace me
But wait âcause...

Oh, we're coming!
Oh...

We're like the whirlwind
Like volcanoes we all rise
We are power, we are courage
We are wise
Like an avalanche
Like wildfire we all soar
We are power, we are courage
We're more than meets the eye
We are Horde

We're like the whirlwind
Like volcanoes we all rise
We are power, we are courage
We are wise
Like an avalanche
Like wildfire we all soar
We are power, we are courage
We're more than meets the eye
We are Horde

We are power, we are courage
We're more than meets the eye
We are Horde
