Unicorns, goblins, hobbits, magic ents
Faeries, pixies, urchins and evil orcs
Seems like over and over they all get in my way
But they tremble and scatter when I say "- Eu sunt Alma!"
The day is fading in silence
I made my way through the mire
I step into the elven land
And I climb the ancient spire
One sound of the bell
and seven arrows are pointed at me
The elves have me surrounded
Ready for the kill
But they stop , and a tree suddenly awakens
And the flow of it`s sea slowly forms the Elder.
And silent, slowly comes to me and gives me
The Emerald Sword of the Ancient
And sends me on my way.
I`m walking through the silent forest
And the trees and the wind are crying with me
I sing to the silent forest
Maybe now will uncover it`s mystery.
