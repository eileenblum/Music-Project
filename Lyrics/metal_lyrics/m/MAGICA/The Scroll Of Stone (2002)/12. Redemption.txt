And the story has reached the heavens/ And my soul returned to me
Great bards have sung my memory / And my story reached thee.
Alma, your eyes are diamonds in the night
Alma, your heart is running to the light.
And say goodbye, and say goodbye to the magic sword
And return her to the forest of the elven lord.
I thank you mighty sorcerer for the words that saved my mind
I thank you for your guidance, your eyes when I was blind
And the story has reached the heavens/ And my soul returned to me
Great bards have sung my memory / And my story reached thee.
