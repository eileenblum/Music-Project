I walk a road to the unknown
To seek the scroll of stone
To untie the course that`s holding down my soul
I`ve searched through all mankind
The cave that i must find
To speak the words that will unchain my mind.
Years and Years go by
I still fight to save my soul
And now I`m on the road to the unknown.
The frozen earth below
My footprints in the snow
Are drawing now the picture of my life.
The mountains in my sight
Are shining in the night
But the blow and silent forest`s in my way.
