I open my way into the cave of the demon
Destiny calls me and I`m full of rage.
Silent my blade lights the room with a warning
The demon attacks me and the walls come to life.

On and on, break the stone
The cave echoes the screams of the demon
That dies with my sword between his eyes

I burn his corpse
And all the rivers stop their course
As I reach for the scroll of stone
The course will break
And all the mountains will start to shake
When I will read
The Scroll of Stone
