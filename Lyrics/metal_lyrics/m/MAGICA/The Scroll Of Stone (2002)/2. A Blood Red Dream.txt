"Undeva, candva, povestea spune ca, intr-un anume timp, intr-un anume loc,
printesa Alma si-a pus o dorinta."

I remember how it all begun
Alone in the dark, trapped in the castle walls
I heard a voice and wanted to run
But something inside me answered the mystic calls
There it was , on the wall, the old mirror
And from its depths a voice was saying to me
I can give you eternal beauty
If you reach my hand and pull me out
I can sell you a dream in red For just a kiss
Pull me out !
I can give you whatever you want
But don't leave me inside
Don't leave me inside this trap
I can change the rest of your life, you just get me out
It's just a little step.
