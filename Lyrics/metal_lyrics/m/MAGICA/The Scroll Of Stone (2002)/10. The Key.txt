I have climbed all the way through the mountains of ice
And now I`m at the end of my road
And I feel like I`m burning inside.
The magic gate holds my path and I can`t open the lock
sorcerer tell me what should I do!

"Sacrifica o picatura din viata ta si lacatul se va deschide!"

I open my vein
In this magic game
Where my blood is the key to it all.
I open the gate
Welcome my fate
And the darkness starts feeding my call.
