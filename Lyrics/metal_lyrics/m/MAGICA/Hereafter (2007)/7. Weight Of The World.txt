[music &amp; lyrics by: Bogdan Costea, arranged by: Magica]

I've wasted so much time
Spilled so many tears
But I'm still waiting by your side
Waiting by your side
Days and weeks went by
Just holding your hand
In a truth from which I could not hide
But I know deep inside
That you will always hear me when I sing
Our song will reach through
And take you away on its wing

The weight of the world
Is falling on my back tonight
But what can I do?
Should I be counting on you
The weight of the world
Is killing me and I cannot fight
Can you assist?
Alone I cannot resist

I was waiting for the dawn
Just holding my breath
When they came and covered your eyes
I've been calling you alone
Trying to get you back
But you did not hear my cries

How I wish you could stay
And leave another day
I hate whatever gods that took you from me
And all I have left is

The weight of the world
Is falling on my back tonight
But what can I do?
Should I be counting on you
The weight of the world
Is killing me and I cannot fight
Can you assist?
Alone I cannot resist
