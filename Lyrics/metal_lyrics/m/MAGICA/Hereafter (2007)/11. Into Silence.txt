[music &amp; lyrics by: 6fingers]

My head
On a pillow
On a bed
Like lead
Where all has been tried
And everything said
With no feeling inside
And no future ahead

In this god-forsaken land
In my life so second-hand
I am chasing my thoughts out the window

I am losing balance
Of body and mind:
Such a strange alliance
Sometimes...
To this blandness
I'll be finally blind
And I will see...
From the ashes of the real
To the blazes of my will
Glimpse the unthinkable!

I am losing balance
Of body and mind:
Such a strange alliance
Sometimes...
To this blandness
I'll be finally blind
And I will see...

Slipping into silence (Soaring on a dream)
Leave all behind
Seeking guidance (Following a beam)
From the Sandman
In defiance (Seeing the unseen)
Of my earthly bind
I'll fly away
Find my way back home...
