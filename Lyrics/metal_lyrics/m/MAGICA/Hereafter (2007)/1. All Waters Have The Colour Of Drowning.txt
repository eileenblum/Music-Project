[music by: Bogdan Costea, lyrics by: Bogdan Costea, arranged by: Magica]

Please tell me crimson river
Is there a place where I
Should search your troubled waters
Please don't lie
It's been raining for three days
And the waters are now high
I can't find no crossing
I'm afraid I'll drown tonight

Wicked river, you don't care
You just follow your own course
While I weep upon your shore
You show me no remorse
While the spirits that you took are frowning
For me, it seems
All waters have the color of drowning

Evenings when I used to get back
Home again
I'd meet my love in this boat
On your wave
And damned be the moment
When my ring went down below
Then he smiled and said
"I'll get it back for you"

Now I wish that every river
Would just stop its flow
But I fear that this waters
Just won't let us go
Not now, not tomorrow, not until
We're all down there below
