[music &amp; lyrics by: Bogdan Costea, arranged by: Magica]

I'm bound to walk that hill
On a deep and silent night of June,
And hear the song of the Dyad Moon
Along with my aching dreams
Comes a strange desire
And it seems my life is caught in a magic loom
Because I know for sure that in this night
For one reflection in the crystal lake
The night queen will awake,
And I made a plan with the silent wave
To cast entangled magic in a tune
And trap the song of the Dyad Moon

The Earth is dying so I will sing
A song that speaks of everything
To remind us of the things that matter most
Please uncover your disguise
And find the dream that lies
Within you, or the magic will be lost

Adorn me with flowers
White candles and sing me the tune
Let there be beauty and power
Entangled
In the night of the Dyad Moon
