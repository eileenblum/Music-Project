[music by: Bogdan Costea, lyrics by: Bogdan Costea, arranged by: Magica]

You sell your soul until your dreams are over
Ain't that a shame of a life?
You buy their lies and live in a world of shadows
But wicked words cut like a knife

I'm sick and tired of all the questions
That I always ask myself
I don't know what's wrong with me,
What is the answer, what's the key?

At the end of the bottle time is gone
Seconds crawling for the dawn
Your time ain't mine
And light races slower
Slower and slower
Through wine

All that you know is right in front of you
Someday they'll even steal your dreams
Your fate is sealed and there's nothing left to do
But taking life to the extremes
