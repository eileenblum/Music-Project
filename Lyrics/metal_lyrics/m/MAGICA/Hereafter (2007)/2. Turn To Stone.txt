[music by: Bogdan Costea, lyrics by: Bogdan Costea, Ana Mladinovici &amp; 6fingers, arranged by: Magica]

My memories lie carved
With words that formed in time
In the milestones of my life
All my mistakes are buried deep beneath
The mountain of my grief

Believe me
All that I ever was is now a blur
Believe me
From the burden cast upon my soul

Now
I turn to stone
And I watch the days go by
I turn to stone
And I will never die
Never, never die

You think I'm nothing but
A sentence on a tomb
In a graveyard without name
You may read my epitaph
But don't try to understand the nature
Of the face behind the frame
