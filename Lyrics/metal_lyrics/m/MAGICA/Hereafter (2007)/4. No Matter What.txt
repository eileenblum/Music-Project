[music &amp; lyrics by: Bogdan Costea, arranged by: Magica]

I'm not the one who sneaks into the night
I'm not the one who's scared
When things don't turn out right
I'm not the one who's ready to resign
At every twist and turn of fate, or the divine

No, I won't run away
I'll never surrender, I'll fight
No, I am here to stay
The fire in me stays alight

No matter what I'll stand my ground
No matter what I'll be around
And if the Universe won't care
It matters not for me
Because in the end
I'll be free

Sometimes it gets so hard
And lights just fade away
Temptation shows its claws
And tries to change my way
There are moments where I cry
For justice in this life
A moment without flaws
But all I find is strife

But now, the things we have
They are so precious that I have to find a way
To break through and keep them forever
