[music &amp; lyrics by: Bogdan Costea, arranged by: Magica]

Still I live my life in a shade of a mystery
All I know proves false and vain
All the science learned
All the knowledge is for nothing
But a truth you can't explain

Feed on me, I've got
Fuel for ages
That you, you will steal against all odds
Feed on me, and then
Then close the cages
We are, we are just energy for the gods

You still search and wonder
Are we alone among the stars
In this terrible waste of space?
But you can't imagine
That we're a harvest since forever
Just a herd called human race

Energy for the gods
That call me
Energy, energy for the gods
Energy for the gods
That made me
Energy, energy for the
Gods
