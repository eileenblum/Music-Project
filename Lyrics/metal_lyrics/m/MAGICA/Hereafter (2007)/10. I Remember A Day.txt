[music &amp; lyrics by: Bogdan Costea, arranged by: Magica]

Sometimes I get a strange feeling
Like nothing I know matters to me
A terrible truth somebody's concealing
Unveils its cloak of mystery

Like in a fairytale
I was walking a fantasy land
Say what you want to me,
I know you will not understand

'Cause
I remember a day
Remember a tear
I can't the words to say
What I have done to be cast here

I must have done something forbidden
In this paradise of silence and will
I tried to reveal that which is hidden
In the depths of my soul and make it real

I remember a day that makes me hate this life
I remember a day that makes me want to die
