[music &amp; lyrics by: Bogdan Costea, arranged by: Magica]

I'm tired of all your caring words
Your good intensions make me sick
They just don't fit my way
My entire life is in these chords
You'd better listen when I speak
And hear what I say

'Cause I am I
And no one can tell me what I need
Inside my mind
There's only one thing that I plead

You must know that everywhere I go
I'm not looking for excuse
And if my actions send me straight to hell
Then that is what I choose
But I know that everywhere I go
I'm the one that you'll condemn
But I don't care and if you did not hear me well
I shall scream
This is who I am!

I'm sorry if you don't approve
But this is what I have become
I shall not change my way
So from my view you'd better move
And you might just quit playing dumb
And hear what I say
