3, 2, 1, get the fuck up

I won't be a victim,
I won't fall to a broken system.
You can't control me.

Your betrayal disgusts me.
You turned your back on me like it was nothing.
Misguided moral compass,
You're so quick at passing judgment.

Get fucked: you are a waste of life.
I'm tired of you crawling in my fucking mind.
I tried to protect your feelings,
But you gave my hatred a whole new meaning.

By, by the wayside
I will watch your life
Flee from your eyes.
Hypocrite.
You fake piece of shit.
I disregard all of the lies
You will spit.
The lies you will spit

I won't be your victim.
I won't fall to your broken system.
You can't control me.
So go pray to your deity.
You're god won't save you now,
A false king with a hollow crown.
I'll wanna watch your kingdom burn.
You will live, if just to learn.

I kept it all inside
Trying to get by
While slowly losing my mind
Psychotic
Neurotic at best.
I feel lower than the rest.

This hatred in my chest,
Makes me feel lower than the rest.

I'm no one's second best,
And now I'll leave you in the past...fuck!

Living with this pain is the only thing I've ever known
Now that you have cut me off, the life I live is bearable.
I am letting go.

I won't be your victim.
I won't fall to your broken system.
You can't control me.
So go pray to your deity.
You're god won't save you now,
A false king with a hollow crown.
I'll wanna watch your kingdom burn.
You will live, if just to fucking learn.
