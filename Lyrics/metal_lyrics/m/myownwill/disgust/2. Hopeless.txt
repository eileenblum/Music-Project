I'm fed up with all the lies you speak,
And every dirty little jab you ever threw at me.
Unsettled
He's her twisted little puppet
Caught in a black widow's web of nothing.

The rats they feed and in the depths I can hear their screams.
Vanity and arrogance have ruined everything.
Why do I?
I swear why do I even try?
Hopeless.

I'm hopeless
Yeah, I'm fucked up. I know this.
I'm dying inside, I'm so glad that you noticed.
I'm fucked up.
And I know I don't show it,
But that is the life you lead when you are hopeless.

You're fucking worthless.

The filth you you speak, while my mouth's shut.
Your life's a disease, you worthless cunt.
I tried my best, it just wasn't enough.
Tonight will ring one final gunshot.

I will regret everything I've said.
Vague memories, there's nothing fucking left.

Nothing fucking left.

I just want back all the wasted time that you and your harlot drained from my life.

I just want back
All the wasted time
That you and your harlot
Drained from my life

Unsettled
He's here twisted, little puppet
Caught in a black widow's web of nothing

I will regret everything I've said.
Vague memories, that's all left in the past.

The rats they feed, and in my head I can hear their screams.
Vanity and arrogance have ruined everything.
Why do I?
I swear why do I even try?
Hopeless.

I'm hopeless
Yeah, I'm fucked up. I know this.
I'm dying inside, I'm so glad that you noticed.
I'm fucked up.
And I know I don't show it,
But that is your life when you know you hopeless.

I'm fucked up.
I'm hopeless.
You're worthless.
