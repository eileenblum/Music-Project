I can't stop, it's my addiction, now born again, it always beats me

Question me
I have failed
The power reaches me
Come feel - It makes me feel

Reaching my shadow breaking trepidation
I can't resist when it cries
Trust in me

Ignite the flames (Raises me from eternal darkness I can see)
Awakening my soul
Now I feel (It's not real)
Like the spirit is my own

I will not trust
I will not take you now

Glad to have met you but now that I see you are false I will trust in me

The guilt, the guilt, I can't handle the thought of it and who I've let down
I need to be free, free away from you and temptation

Craving, needing, seeking, loathing
What I become when I'm with you, I'm dying
So close to death but yet I live
I order you rest in peace

We both can't function
We cannot co-exist
The war still rages
This war ignites the flames of life
