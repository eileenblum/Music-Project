...And in the end your words are poison
A simple line is fatal for whom that will believe
You infiltrate with toxic deceit
And no one can see it

Lies - your verbal disease is contagious

False friends are everywhere
And that's your motivation
Manipulating feeble minds

Manipulation
Euphoria battles despair

Are you so far satisfied while I'm losing everything?

Trusting is suffocation - willing asphyxiation
Ignorance is self-infliction - ignorance is death
Lie
Lie
Fatal Poison Whisper

Crucify myself, crucify
I should've fucking stopped you
Eradicate your false flow
Push you to the limits
Cut your instincts
Slit your fucking throat and pull your fucking tongue
Slit your throat

Your time shall come when you fall
Trepidation is all that you'll feel
Fear will be your curse
Eternal Pain

Time will see you fall at my feet
In the end you?ll be forgiveness
You will feel the pain I'm feeling
This is who we are
