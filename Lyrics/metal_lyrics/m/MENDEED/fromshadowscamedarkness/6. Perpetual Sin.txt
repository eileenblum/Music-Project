As it goes on I don't know if I can take more of this
An everyday abandonment of a less painful time

Hedonistic, pessimistic, masochist, chaos
My silent truth, past well hidden
Do you realise what I am going through?
False life
Lie

Contradiction
Blind vision

God help save me, God help kill the demon raping my soul
God can't help save me; God can't help kill the demon raping my soul

I try to forget

I will make you feel like I did
Slaughter your hopes and your dreams then you'll see through my eyes
Come back blind to me

So far my dedication to succeed has got me through this time
But how much longer can a dream block out reality?
Could I always just block out reality?

If I were blind I wouldn't have to see
If I were deaf I would never hear
If I were dumb I wouldn't have to speak
My senses numb, a pleasure pain for me

Manipulation is vital for your way of life
Manipulation breeds
Plagiarism - steal your thoughts from someone else
Plagiarisation

Go to hell
Rot

I will survive to orchestrate your fall
Cleansing us all of parasite one - destroy
Repent your sin
