In dark eyes lacking feeling or expression
Blood laced tears suggest life within this creature
A life so full of pain - devoid of spirit
Chastised, despised - so forced to fight
Against the peril of humanity

In lucid dreams a precious life unfolds
Enchanting
The spell is broken by screams
Evil is calling

Put a bullet through its head if it can't win
To hell with that if the fuckers get away with it
Where's the justice in the world
If you can't destroy the one who ripped your life apart

Through it's eyes we are feeling the pain of surviving
Its soul is living inside us all
We must rise - fuelling the spirit redemption
The cross will shine

He died for the sake of the of the good inside us
We must carry on his legacy
Rise and believe
