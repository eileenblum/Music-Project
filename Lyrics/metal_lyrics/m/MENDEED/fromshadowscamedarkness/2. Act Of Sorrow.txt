In time I will rise to defeat these demons
Demons are sent to slay, here in the night to haunt my dreams
The souls they've taken are tearing my flesh as I fall
I now succumb to their darkness

From within this plague of ghost and shadows
Time does not heal
Eternal wasting
Still I hold onto this hope

Survival rests in my hands, as does my destiny
I must prepare for Judgement Day
