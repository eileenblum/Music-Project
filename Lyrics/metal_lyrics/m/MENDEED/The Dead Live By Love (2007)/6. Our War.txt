Is this what you came for?
Take your only shot

You're hiding it all this time
Hiding what you were disguised as friendship
Knives are twisting but I smile in spite of you
I would've die for you but you took this time from me
I don't know all the signs but I don't give a fuck

Fire inside of me break me if you can
Bodies burning by the side of another
But you're never gonna take us down
Fire in the soul take that you can
Build up all the armies and tear down all the cities
But you don't know where I am

I`m thinking that you're not gonna make it
I am hoping that you'll fall in this life to me
Can't run forevermore  I will
Go back an take this time from you

No regrets
Nothing ever sets this free
This is our war
