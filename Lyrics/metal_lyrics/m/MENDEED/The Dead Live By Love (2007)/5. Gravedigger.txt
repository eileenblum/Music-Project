Losing it all

Wake you can't you see?
Everything hast turned to shit
A graveyard filled with hope
The ghosts of freedom
Another revolution
To save the world again
Creating a new cancer
Feasting on life
Whats peace kissed by war?
To be free we must first kill?
Sanctioned by blackened hearts
That beat forever
Another revolution
To save the world again
Creating a new cancer
Feasting the life

Seeing the sorrow
Hearts  have been broken turned to stone
By promises "wont let the die for nothing"
And with a strike of their own
Nothing will end

Proud ?reap what you sow
Orders to slay a society living beside us
Kill.reap what you sow
Suffer.only the innocent die by your rules
Nothing is left but ruins damaged through time
Destroyed by evil an eternal crime
Cities are lost, weeping they bleed
Histories of pain

One more time I pray for justice
What's up with the world if demons run free?

No remorse
Into the unknown flees the soul of hades
You will forsake the one your meant to help
Poison in your veins

Judgement of old reason to slay
Your soul cannot be cleansed
