Inside I feel I'm waiting
Inside I feel I`m fighting
Inside I smother what I am
Bloodstained memories
Remain for all time
The glass reflecting my pain
I can't take away this void I'll never heal
Broken dreams I can't reveal
Take me as I am

I live my life in shadows
Never pure it destroyed what I was
Alone the thoughts flood my head
See past the monster I am
Take my pain resurrect my healing
And light the fire once in me

Fall from grace
Memories echo screams of my past in my ears
Demons rage in my mind

Nothing that falls is without wings and a heart thats beating
If you look into my eyes can you see me?
Roses has thorns against the flesh
Image of blood versus whats pure
Do I remain or have I fell too far?

Fall from grace
Memories echo screams of my past in my ears
Demons rage in my mind
Fight back shadows I can feel you
Fill me with desire
Free me
Take me as I am

Bloodstained memories
Can I fade if I am healed
With you
Fighting to be saved
