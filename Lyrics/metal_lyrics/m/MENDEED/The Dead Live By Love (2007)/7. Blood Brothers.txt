Blood lust altogether fight for honour stand united
We protect our brothers` memories.we never hide
Side by side never back away from pain when we feel it
Side by side we would crave the blood pour into our eyes
Wounded we fought against the odds sucking our faith
But we grew strong

Yeah we stood as one
We may be wrong
We were not blind
But we still fought
We could do anything blood brothers til death
Respect was the only compassion
But in the end
Nothing can guarantee safety by code
We had no laws

No escape
Burn us out
Warchild
We are the children of the violent effigy
Nothing can deliver back the ashes of the dead
Our own institution crashes down from high above
We are all the children destined to be left cold
