Show me you've no regrets of what you are
If you're here then you're still waiting
No reason for the fear of what awaits
If you're here then you're still waiting

Hold onto what you are
Rise against the world outside
Fight for all the things you'll ever want
Can we really live
In a life forsaking dreams
Consumed by fear?

Wait for nothing
Silence fear

Fight against til the end
Everything you fear
Fight against the dreamers ashes
Burning lives
