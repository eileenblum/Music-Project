And so it is into my life it's back to take
Revenge unto the world I'm not afraid I'm never losing
We are in another dimension we can take them all down
This time it's all or nothing only one will leace with something
Gimme fuel for the fire gimme strength gimme trust
In my heart this lasts forever
This time we ll fights oppression
Another rule in a fight of submission
All things that will end with you
Freeing me from the curse of you

Inside I'm beaten down
Ready to fall and I'm ready for fire
Somehow I breathe and I'm ready to stop you
This is my desire
You were the twelfth disciple
You're never real and you're living denial
Come to me and you'll feel the power
Open up the wounds and we only see the lies

That passed in the world we are the ones
With a vision
Run to the end ,end of all time
History is ours an immortal time
Reload war and design
Go unto ehy and relice the sign
Of time our way of life

No we shall for deep into
Battlefields ,fight iol death. take you on anyway
Evil shall fall to the good inside
You cannot win this time ,nothing can be everso
This the final fight now see the end of lies

In this hell I see now
You are my addiction
Gimme fuel for the fire gimme strength gimme things that fuel inside you
No-one can just smash through
My life my existence
Gimme fuel for the fire gimme strength gimme things that fuel inside you
