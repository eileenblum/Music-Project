Keep your reasons
This time you've gone too far
I wont just lay and take this
Reload n kill
My resurgence beats in my heart
New life summoned by rage
Smashes your threat away

Keep your smile and your lies
Look your fear in the eye

Twist the knife in my back again
I taste the blood filling my mouth
(I spit it right back in your face)
Now I strinke consuming you like fire
Vengeance is mine now
(flames take that memory and that pain)
Inside this hell I wait for you
To scream for mercy at my hand

I`m free

And as your body is burning I
Reclaim your ashened soul
