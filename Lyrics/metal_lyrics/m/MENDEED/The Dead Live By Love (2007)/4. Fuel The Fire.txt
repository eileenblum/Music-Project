Toal insanity
We are falling into nothing
We`re at war this war evermore
We wont be the same
We are sinking into silence
We are feeding from the liars
To the end of the earth
We march unto this war

Take your laws of life and rewrite them
Nothing that you say is the truth you're vile
Ive seen it all in the eyer of deceitful
Pray you live tonight

Fuel the fire raging through us all
I can taste the sick inside I`m promising you I wont take this
My hatred grows
Fuel the fire if you dare I will not stand you as dictator

We wont taste defeat
