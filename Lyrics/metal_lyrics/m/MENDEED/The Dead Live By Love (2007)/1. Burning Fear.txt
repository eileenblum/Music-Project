Let's go the time is now
Reaching beyond the depths that swallowed me
Rising against a darker force
Death has seen into me
Deep within the tragedy
In my eyer the burning of my past
Robbed of my identity
Sucked of life but made to live
In my abyss hidden from the world
Reaching from  the deeps
Ending suffering
I am a victim but I see
Dark visions that sink into my eyes
Are not forever nothing takes my heart

Killing me inside forever
Once I thought this true
Death had entrapt me taking my soul
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I feel
Hell cannot breathe inside me
I don't fear your

Rising to be free set my past alight
Rising against your burning soul
Nothing will stand in my way
Death has seen  the tragedy still stand here face to face
Feel my wrath I shall not fall

I have no fear
Of hell or what you are
Bring your war
I can taste your hate
Feel your thoughts dripping with your bile to this world your a parasite
At my hand you die
End the suffering

Bring your war to me
I am victim but I see

Killing me inside forever
Once I thought this true
Death had entrapt entrapt me taking my soul
As I  walk through the valley of the shadow of death I feel
Hell cannot beathe inside of me
I don't fear you

Nothing will last
