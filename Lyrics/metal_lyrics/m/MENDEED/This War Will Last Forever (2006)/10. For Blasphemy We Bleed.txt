Foul blanket settles, brings devastation.
Hate in our hearts, blood on our hands.
This fractured peace, raw bones defending.
Black hearted war is never ending.
For blasphemy we bleed, smash the cross of greed.
We sever Satans' claw refusing to believe.
Shrapnel lobotomy, unholy killing spree - from blank-eyed crusaders and remorseless invaders.
The end of innocence, this crippled legacy, the sin of ignorance, the beast of violence.
This fracture peace, raw bones defending.
Black hearted war is never ending.
Redemption is buried beneath a blooded field of rotten corpses.
Surrender our instinct to kill or witness existence crumble.
Turn to ashes, burn alive in scenes of suffering, cites fall into the hole.
Cut the throat of our humanity, starve the child of our sanctity, kiss goodbye to dreams of unity, embrace the oath to destroy our brothers and our sisters.
Slaughter their beliefs if they don't share our faith, if they are not our race, if their skin isn't ours and they don't share our tongue.
What have we become? These racist wars of hate on streets and battlefields.
It's our time to make a stand against the rule of the skeleton crown.
We can't just watch as others crash and burn in our world.
We are the victims of a war we did not want to see, it's our blood that stains the streets and the battlefields.
We are the victims of a war we did not want to see, we cannot pass these reigns onto our children.
Against their plague of hatred unite and stand our ground, our will can't be defeated if we are one race.
We can take back what is ours.
