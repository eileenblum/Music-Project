Leeching on life's crying vein sucking out the passion and the dream.
This is the hour of need.
Allies and foes unite or dark princes will prevail and our world will cease to exist.
[The] Remains of the day will drown under our blood - Poisoned, damaged, blackened - we lie.
Servants of hell dance as they wait for us.
We won't be sacrificed by clowns who wear a crown.
We are the kings of our day.
Poisoned, damaged, blackened we stand.
Servants of hell dance as they wait to take us to the other side in thorns and flames.
I cast them back through burning gates, slaying opposers of liberty [and] defend the honour of our kind throughout time.
Poisoned, damaged, blackened we defy, don't forget that we all belong here.
We are free.
