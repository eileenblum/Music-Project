On winds of death, hate filled and unforgiving, no life is spared, in death we are all equal.
As cities fall, monarchs and clergy with them.
Judgement has risen - prepare for death.
Tears still dampen scenes of forgotten yesterdays; drowning Edens portray the final sin to come.
Judgement calls like a raven's crow in the night, judgement calls to reclaim the day, judgement calls like a silent executioner, judgement calls for the fallen souls.
Despite you we could be the saviours of our time, this our righteous crusade - healing those who suffer - there is nothing left for you to take here.
This is ours, the second life, we've come back to stop you.
How more must die for us to see that reason is spilling from the lips of a liar.
No more genocide.
Weeping for a million devastations, burning nations, annihilations, and children lost.
If we damn the hate we will be here forever.
Our lives will last forever.
Our hearts will beat forever.
Our love will bloom forever and time will be forever.
