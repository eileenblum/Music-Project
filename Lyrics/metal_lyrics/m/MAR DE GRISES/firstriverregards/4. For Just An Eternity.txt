For Just an Eternity
I'll seem to cry
For I'll be down and grey
Disappeared
Tonight
I 'll die
I'll leave once again
And my mesmerised thoughts
Come and feed the burden of my soul
I hope I'll breathe
Until all I can see... its you

Ruido continuo...
Del constante vaivÃ©n de mi vida
Del imperturbable silencio de mi pecho...
Como podrÃ­a empezar a entender...
AyÃºdame... ayÃºdame...

For all I care to you...

I have much love... it fits nowhere
Waiting in despair
It goes through my soul
... I have seen it fade... so many times
And for just one moment... I'm there again

I long for those times
The ones that brought tears and laughs
The ones that brought love and hate
The ones that would never end

I long for a friendful hand
I long for a place to rest

But still I'm afraid
The sun will shine
Her tears will dry

I'm living no longer
A stone with no name
For my dead its been late
... for many years now
I'm no longer afraid
It will just be a moment
A sinless taste...

... Of an eternity
