I raped the shadow interpreter
But I was acting (as she was)

What is to blame?
The silence we couldn't steal?
The pain we couldn't fool?

Onward to the crystal roots
Deep-seeded is my hope
But you make master keys fall
Stop digging in this hole
Screams my soil with a broken bone

Is love your cage? (Impossible)
My rebellion
Is under construction
Crystallized they will ever remain
Roots of shadows within this fate?
