[Music: Rodrigo Morris - Lyrics: Juan Escobar]

The union has begun in crescendo.
Where you hide. I will shine... alone
and fears I will forget and straight I'll go
do you want to know?
So play the keys in the sky and confuse me
with the ethereal colors of depression's eve
when alignment crosses the line of earth.

Starmaker,
denied logic
I can't deceive wind.

How could you feel deafness,
when my hands are down on earth?
Starmaker,
never leave me
denied logic
I can't deceive wind.
