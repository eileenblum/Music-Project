[Music: Rodrigo Morris - Lyrics: Alejandro Arce]

I suppose accuracy
in the morphology of knots.

With that impertinent spontaneity,
a freezable hypnosis is born
so to apply it on whenever you need
a tied new breed
tied and red hot
like every knot
in absence of
scientific delirium.

The truth reveals inside
a smell recording device
as the first work
of a paid knot untier,
but that freezing inside
a loss of logic provides
altered by ancient odours.

Another defrosted hypnosis in vain,
another failed attempt
of untying one knot of accuracy.
