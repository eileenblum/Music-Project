[Music: Juan Escobar - Lyrics: Juan Escobar]

Blinding sparkles
of humidity
every morning,
since the beginning.
Faded memories, kept
waiting for me.

Sweet childhood,
Dissipating and innocent
too short to grab it back
surrounded by a burning sea
vanished at any dusk.

North, give me hope
rescue me and forgive me,
catatonic north, wait for me
because I wait for you.

Always jealous, always the same
smiling on spring's eve
you, prowling around madness
descend one last time.

Warm, lovesome winters
they scourged my timid essence
rotting me until getting me drunk,
until I reached beauty...
give me hope,
rescue me and forgive me,
catatonic north,
wait for me
because I wait for you.
