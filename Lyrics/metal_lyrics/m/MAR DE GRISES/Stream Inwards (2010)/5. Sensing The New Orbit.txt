[Music: Juan Escobar - Lyrics: Sergio Ãlvarez]

She tried to evaporate yet not to disappear,
she believed she knew it all
but she forgot with a bitter sip of time.
I know I can find within you that stardust
of an almost perfect infinite galaxy.

But...
Have you ever tried to orbit around emotion,
in absence of gravity?
Have you ever tried to look forward,
with eyes like mirrors?

Noise and light will not change,
standing there in that constant rain of sand
you will die upright
carved by the storm.

There's electricity no more,
guilty calm, thirstless calm,
what do you expect from time?
A great inspiration
for a small job.
I can still feel the smooth ablaze
of your telekinetic eyes.
