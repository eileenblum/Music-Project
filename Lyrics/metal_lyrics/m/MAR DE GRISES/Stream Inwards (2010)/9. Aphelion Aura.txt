[Bonus track]

[Music: Rodrigo Morris - Lyrics: Alejandro Arce]

Dripping colors of a distant image
reveal a shape that I can't see
they paint the trail of a dream
but distance is more than I can breathe.
Still far away, still cold

My aura chokes me
lies to me loves me
and despises me
yet in the end
she whispers to me:
"...but remember,
you'll always be closer than is seems,
you'll be forever embraced
in the birth of a hidden dream".
How could I?
Too late to realize
that shape was the same as me.
