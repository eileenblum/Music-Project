How can I believe in utopia?
If I... can't see you
How can I believe in hope?
It has been forgotten
It's nothing but a dream
Do not say that I can

How can I believe in life?
If it's dying
How can I believe in truth?
If I'm lying
How can I believe in death?
If it is only silence
...Do not say that I can

I'm sad
...still

Placed here
By your one and only god
Did it have to be so cold??
Do I make a sound so dull??
Have I stepped Upon a mine?
Am I just just a waste of time?
...Do not say that I can!!!

You told me the sun isn't shining
The sea is a lie
The moon's a stone
There is no dawn
You made my life senseless

The absent breeze
(believe)
Will rip (they'll live)
...my true face
My soul
Should I mourn

Who made your heaven so cold???
Was that your god???

My faceless enemy... laughs
In sight of my utopic victory
I didn't wanted it to end this way
You can go... I stay
