And I dream eternally in this forest blue
The wolves howl my name
Leaves fall and fill my soul
The sun is gone
The stars have forgotten me

We worship the Sun God!!
Hail your hands to the Sabbath
We look to the past
They saw forward
Hail your hands towards the Sun God!!!

Jesus never mentioned Sunday
The disciples still worshipped on Sabbath day.

We worship the Sun God!!
Hail your hands to false Sabbath
We look to the past
They look forward
Hail your hands towards the Sun God!!!

The stars have forgotten us..
