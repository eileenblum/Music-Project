Iâm purged from the belly of this beast
Whispers that flow through the blue
No longer haunt the copper of the mountains
Now to stargaze and discover my quest!
Now to propose to everything I love!
Everything I love..

This shadow!
Has never stopped following me
The sun never stops rotating.
No, not this time

Here comes the king of kings
Lord of the Lords, Baali!
Shut up and submit, BOW TO HIM!!
