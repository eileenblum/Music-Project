Like a friendly ghost
I will return
Into that place I love
Place of memories
That same old face
Smiling at me
Looking so deep inside
Deep into my soul

No time for this world
Rain will come
No room for empty words
Rain will wash away

Clocks stop at midnight
Only sky above us
All is turning blue
All is pointing at us
