I'm tired of your excuses
I've heard them all before
I' don't want you to come around here
Knocking at my door
I'm alone in my silent room
Pacing 'round the floor
Don't try to call me 'cause
You're not my friend anymore

All he ever wanted was his silence
All he ever got was that silence
Not to last from the rest of his life
Not to last forever

I don't need your sympathy
I'm doing fine without you
In this room I've got all I need
Me myself and I too
I locked the door to keep everyone out
But after all what I knew
Was that I locked myself inside
Inside the silence of this room
