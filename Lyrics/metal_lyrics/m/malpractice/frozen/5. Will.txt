There was a little boy
Looking right through me
Memories nightmares
Standing in the main entrance of my life
All I was thinking
Gotta face my fears
All my darkest scars run along with my tears

With this sense of will
I will seek for a better
With this sense of will
I will look for a better way

There were these people
Pointing fingers at me
Laughter horror
Kicking dirt into these eyes of mine
All I saw was
Last of my gone fears
All my wasted time for the rest of my life
