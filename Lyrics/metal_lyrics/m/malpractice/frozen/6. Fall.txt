Did I figure it out did I realize
How deep is my fear
So much to say nothing to tell
I thought I needed to tell

I don't remember eye don't remember

Fall fall fall
Fall of my season
Fall fall fall
Fall of my season

It was so real as the movies
As the stories I held inside
In this killing heat my thoughts begin
To revolve back to rain

Rain will fall
