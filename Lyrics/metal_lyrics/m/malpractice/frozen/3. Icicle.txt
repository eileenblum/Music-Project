It's so cold I am freezing
So much snow it's so wonderful

Up to my neck
I can't move
I can't feel
I can't see
The wind so cold
It's all I hear
It's all I feel
It's all I love

Like a monument
Standing still
Statue in snow
January chill

Ice surrounds me
Snow comforts me
Cold warms me
Frost melts me
