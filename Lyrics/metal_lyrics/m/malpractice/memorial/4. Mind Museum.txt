Somewhere in a time to come
There's nothing left from our generation
Except this last asylum
Where they've captured some of our thoughts

Step inside and I'd like to show you something
Choose a thought and it will come to you
Unknown events unknown faces haunting
They fill find your mind and finally you think it's true

Welcome to mind museum
Warehouse of ancient thoughts
Take a round-trip
Then you'll see 'em
But only in your mind

Inside this placid building
There's nothing we can see or touch
Entities of memories
Exhibition of long gone thoughts

Visions spinning in your head
Caleidoscopic scenery
Someone else's thoughts instead
Logical refinery
An enemy within your mind
This strangest kind of registery
Now there's thousand more inside
Your life becomes a memory
