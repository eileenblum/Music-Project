I feel no sorrow as I go
Down my stream of tomorrow
I see you coming towards me
You've never seen me before
I feel your presence around me
Don't dare to ignore
You turn around and try to flee
You're scared of my face
I'm destitute of eyes you see
You tighten your pace

I am the masterpiece fade to grey
I saw tomorrow as just another day
I saw reflections my memories
I fought infection with desperate remedies

I feel no sorrow as you go
Down my stream of tomorrow
I am perpetual I'll never die
Forever I will reign
I am aggression I am lie
I'll reign in pain
Your scream for mercy I'll ignore
I am hatred and disgust
My abscessed face you abhor
I am the lie you must trust
