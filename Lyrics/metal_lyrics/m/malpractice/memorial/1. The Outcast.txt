I feel like all is slipping away
It doesn't bother me anymore
Caught in this broken old machine
Feels like this is my last day
Covered in hate and shattered nerves
Don't think you're having all the fun
I know that help will never arrive
Still I'm hard as fuckin' steel

Blood and fire everywhere
They left me here all alone
Help me I've got no soul to sell
I'm just on my way to hell

Full of broken thoughts
He cannot repair
Everyone he knows
Goes away in the end

Trying to alleviate his loneliness
A forfeit will be his deficient life
He pushed the gun into his mouth
Maybe problems don't have no solutions
