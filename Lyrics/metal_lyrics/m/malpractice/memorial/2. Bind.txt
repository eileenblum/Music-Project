Created as an image of God
To be tall-standing and perfect
An outstanding paragon
Of cute furry animal
But the lure of the left-hand path
Had it's way with mankind
Our narrow sighted ways
Have finally turned against us
In front of our eyes
We find things so good
But our rotten attitude
Make 'em have their end

We go
How low we can go
Hello
Aren't we indeed so fow
Mind
Yes of course we do mind
Bind
Our primitive minds
Oh no
Reflections do not flow
Show us
The direction to go
Mind
Yes of course we do mind
Bind
Our primitive minds

We are unspeakable
We are bad
We are unreliable
We are sad
We are losers
We are sinners
We are no good
We are not winners
