Revulsion
The words are led astray
Convulsion
My pride has gone away
Once closer to the one you fear
Surrender let your thoughts wander

I can make you rule me
Cause you can't take me to lie

I am born narrow minded
I am always misleaded
I am turning into someone else

Oblivion my dreams are faded
Disillusion I am bitter jaded
Now forever you'll drown in sin
Forgiveness what you're longing for

Once I was self-assertive
I had my future so prepaired
Didn't know that I was dying
I was dying inside out
No more future, no more people
I am losing, I am drowning
I can't cry now, I can't laugh now
I have gone now
Into the dark hole
