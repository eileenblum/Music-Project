I have crossed the bridge of sighs
A thousand times before
I have seen what lies behind
The hangman's eyes before

Now I know the secret
Now I know the game
Everything is gone now
Everything's the same
I never asked to be born again and again

When the light of day is gone
Forever I am one
Last rays from the soon dead sun
No time for last goodbyes
Everything inside me dies
I feel sorry for the sun

I have walked the trail of tears
A hundred years before
I have felt the burning fear
The ending near before

I'm not the one to cry for
I'm gonna be alright
Whatever will happen I will survive
I'm not the one to die for
I'm gonna stay alive
Whatever will happen I will survive

Again and again
