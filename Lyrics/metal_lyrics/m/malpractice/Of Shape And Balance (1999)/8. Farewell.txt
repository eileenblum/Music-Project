She was the light in my life that night
Looking so innocent
Such a pretty sight
I never thought I could end up being like that
Taking my life away
Taking everything she had

I felt the guilt for the tears I made her cry
I felt the guilt for those cries

I'm made of clay
I'm made of bitter fright
How could I put an end to our life in that night
Wandering round confused with a gun in my hand
Swallowing it all the way
Too tired to stand

This world was too hard for me
This world was too cruel for me
By the time she understands
These words are all I ever wanted to say
Please don't let your tears fall down
Cause this is the only good thing I've ever done

Something lives inside me
Something breath my air
Something using my thougts
That something was my pride
