Please come to me
I have begun to see
The truth behind this all
Everything
Everything is false

Part of me died with sunset
Second brought my pain
Now I'm listening strange voices
And I'm lost again

Once I had a dream
Being better than I have been
What went wrong
I'm stuck in the tide
It's not what it seems
I'm losing my dreams
Drowning along in shallow waters

I need something to believe in
Concrete lies or happiness
Something to paint the picture
Something to realize for sure

I know what lies beneath the surface
Faceless nameless in the crowd I am
Drowning in shallow water
Losing faith
Losing everything I hoped for
Seething without air
Desperately seeking for something real
One with the waves
I blend in the crowd and lose identity

Betrayed by dreams and unsaid words
The tide is trying to find
Its shape and balance
Swallowing pride
Restless inside

Drowning in shallow water
