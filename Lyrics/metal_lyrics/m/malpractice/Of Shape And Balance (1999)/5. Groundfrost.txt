Sparkles of dawn
Washes the ground
Fearless faces
Watch from the underground
The gates of mist
Open up their eyes
The new day has arrived
With lust in it's hands

And the children of dawn scream phrases
The groundfrost got them on their knees
On their way to the forgotten kingdom
Drowning along with trivial wisdom
Seemingly timeless is their journey

Disbelief living
Among their crowd
Groundfrost collect its
Victims one by one

Got to find the way out of this nightmare
Got to get into the valley of warmth
But we don't know how

Used to live in peace and never had any wars
Got to get into the valley of warmth
But we don't know when

And the children of dawn
Held phrases
The groundfrost
Got all their lives
On their way to
Forgotten wasteland
Wasting the greatest might
In sand buried within
Their desert grave
And the groundfrost got
It's eternal silence
Maybe it was ment to be
This way...
