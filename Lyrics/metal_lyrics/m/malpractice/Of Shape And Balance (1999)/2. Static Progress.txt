Running 'round in circles
Never really moving
Waiting for a miracle
To give us cultivation
Up and down the spiral
Drifting back and forth
Avoiding the perimeter
At the edge of awareness

We're placing Darwin under question
Yet we don't even know who we are
We're rising to the occasion
And think we're the one called God

Static progress accidental reflex
Static progress displays our strength and weakness

In and out of focus
Perspective gets twisted
Looking from the inside
Dying to be let out

We disagree with the truth
We deny the matter of course
We are parasites in bloom
We are feasting on our host

In our prayers we ask for understanding
We get a glimpse of what's to come
In our clouds there's no more silver lining
It's turned to black and hides the sun
