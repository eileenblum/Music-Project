By the rising sun I vaporize
Like the icy morning dew
I scratch myself together
For another day so blue
My thoughts are few and far between
By the mountainside I wander
What I am what I've become
I am the clouds I'm under

I roll with the punches
And roll with the clouds
I drift with the tide
And hide in my shroud

As the final curtain falls
I'm the wind the evening breeze
And maybe you will hear my call
As I whisper in the trees
After all is said and done
And you have found your peace
You will know I am the one
Who lives within your dreams

High above the mountain peak
I roll among the clouds
And far beyound the snowbound dirt
I sleep within the ground
I'm everything in nothingness
I am the air you breathe
My image expressionless
I'm your dream when you're asleep
