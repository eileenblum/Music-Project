Distant thunder breaks the silence
Dark clouds bring the rain
Birdsong ceases before the storm
I get this feeling again

Darkness wraps me in its veil
I can feel it 'roud my throat
I'm standing naked in rain
Just teardrops for my coat

I feel I've been here a lifetime ago
Why do I still remember
Still remember it all
The feeling I get is so strong yet so sore
You promised I wouldn't remember
Wouldn't remember at all

The storm is over and I'm alone
Kneeling on the grass
I raise my head and look up high
Watch the dark clouds pass

I feel the wind dry up my skin
And listen to the roar
As it slowly rolls away
And leaves me wanting more

These cynic eyes have seen through lies
And so much more
When the knot unties there's paradise
I can afford

Suddenly I feel refreshed and warm
Suddenly I feel depressed and so cold
Suddenly there's nothing I can feel
I realize I'm alone in the field
