[My personal favourite on the album.
Some very intense and complex guitar acrobatics on this one.
Basically my version of "The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner" lyrics-wise.
Not that many songs kick off with the chorus.
This one does.]

What if I stumble will I fall?
What if there is no end at all?
What if I'm running an endless race?
What if there is no second place?

Dreams betrayed by dreams
A random observation
Guidelines get blurred
Without guidance.

It's a fine line between man and divinity
A straight line from fame to an ex-celebrity

A quick glance over my shoulder
Just miles of empty road
Sweat burning my eyes
Feet ache on led road

Another mile for me
Another scenery
The race is on
But somehow I'm alone
I used to know them all
But someone proved me wrong
Their names are gone but faces I remember

What if I stumble will I fall?
What if there is no end at all?
What if I'm running an endless race?
What if there is no second place?

The sun just passed the zenith
I watch as it slowly sets
Just keep on running exhausted
As a man ever gets

Stagnant is my progression
Yet I'm right on course
To finish first, cross the line
To win the race of course

Another mile for me
Another scenery
The race is on
But somehow I'm alone
I used to know them all
But someone proved me wrong
Their names are gone but faces I remember

What if I stumble will I fall?
What if there is no end at all?
What if I'm running an endless race?
What if there is no second place?
