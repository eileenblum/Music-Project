[I tried to capture the feelings of the very first men who reached the North Pole.
The long preparatons (about 2 minutes before the vocals kick in).
The freezing cold (eerie acoustic middle section) and the punchline is that any trail you take from the pole, you're definitely going south.]

Years of preparations
And finally we're here
To begin our exploration
Be cautious and persevere

At dawn we set the course
Through fields of ice and snow
Where no man's been before
Towards the pole we go

Dark clouds gather while we sleep
Blizzard starts on day five
Suddenly we're in too deep
Struggling to stay alive
Impossible to see the cracks
And so we lose a sleigh
Impossible to stay on track
Expedition gone astray

As far as eye can see
White fields fill the scenery
The further north we get
The sun will never set

We go where no one ever had the chance to go
We are the pioneers, pioneers in snow
We go and conquer vast and icy plains of northpole
Our expedition's the very first to know

Bearing the magnetic north
Any trail we take is southbound

Finally the sky clears
And we are moving on
Our destination is near
Seems like we have won

Place our flag on the top of the world
Feel relieved and proud
In this place there is no north
Any trail we take is southbound

The further north we get
The sun will never set

We go where no one ever had the chance to go
We are the pioneers, pioneers in snow
We go and conquer vast and icy plains of northpole
Our expedition's the very first to know

Bearing the magnetic north
Any trail we take is southbound
