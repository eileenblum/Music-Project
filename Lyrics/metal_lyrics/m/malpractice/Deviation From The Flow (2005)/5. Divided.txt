[Personal relationships are the most difficult thing in a human beings life.
Nothing is more difficult to understand than a woman.
This one's the closest we get to a ballad on the whole album.
The middle part contains once again some serious guitar-wanking...]

When love's been replaced by hate
And passion turned into rejection
When every word has been said
Anger takes over affection

These walls provide cold comfort
But at least a shelter rom the pour
So we close this chapter
So we close the door

Between two hearts in anger
Between two hearts in awe
Between two different minds
Finally provided

Emotions intertwined
I guess we're out of time
Divided we are, two hearts too far
We are...
Emotions intertwined
I guess we're out of time
Divided we are, two hearts too far
Divided we are...

Through the window
I watch the nothing
Empty room, empty gaze
Empty me...

Watch the darkness
Without seeing
Empty streets. empty hearts
Empty you...

Emotions intertwined
I guess we're out of time
Divided we are, two hearts too far
We are...
Emotions intertwined
I guess we're out of time
Divided we are, two hearts too far
Divided we are...
