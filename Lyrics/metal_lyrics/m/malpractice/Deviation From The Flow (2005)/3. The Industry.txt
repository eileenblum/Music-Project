[A bit slower song in 11/8 and 5/4 and a few other odd-time signatures.
The lyrics reflect my frustration a few years back on the whole music industry.
Like the chorus says: "It's not about who you are. It's all about who you know".]

Trying in vain
To prove you're something special
Playing the game
Knowing you're bound to lose

Through years of frustration
Going against the wall
Still trying to make it
Still standing tall

It's not about who you are
It's all about who you know
Where do you go
When everything depends on others

Striving again
To prove you've got a point
It's so insane
When talent means nothing

Through years of hard working
Swimming against the mainstream
Someday you will make it
It's more than just a dream

It's not about who you are
It's all about who you know
Where do you go
When everything depends on others

Trying in vain
Playing the game
Striving again
It's so insane

It's not about who you are
It's all about who you know
Where do you go
When everything depends on others

When everything depends on others
