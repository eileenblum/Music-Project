[An obvious opening track for the album because of its rather basic structure and catchy chorus.
This song maybe also the easiest to approach for a new listener because there aren't that many odd-time parts and other progressive elements compared to the other songs.
The lyrics say basically that everyone is an individual and should be able to deviate from the flow.]

Just a part of a great machine
With wheels in constant motion
Victims of our own doctrine
Eluding personal notions

Fear of changing keeps us in
And around the belt we go
Obey the rules of the machine
Deviation from the flow

Brings sanction for your soul
And before you know
You'll find yourself disassembled
Cast out and alone

We have seen the dawn of a better phase
Lost in the fringes of time
Always searching for the truth within our lies
We move on and seek for a better place
Caught in the assembly line
Round and round until the light escapes our eyes

Revolution o nthe rise
Our way to different conditions
As long as we can stay concise
Stand fast in opposition

Brings sanction for your soul
And before you know
You'll find yourself disassembled
Cast out and alone

We have seen the dawn of a better phase
Lost in the fringes of time
Always searching for the truth within our lies
We move on and seek for a better place
Caught in the assembly line
Round and round until the light escapes our eyes

Our rights are lost
In the wheels of greediness
Nobody cares when we're crawling
Too tired to fight
Too strained to loosen up
Nobody seizes when we're falling

We have seen the dawn of a better phase
Lost in the fringes of time
Always searching for the truth within our lies
We move on and seek for a better place
Caught in the assembly line
Round and round until the light escapes our eyes
