[Another stomper with some seriously furious guitar parts.
Maybe the catchiest chorus off the whole album.
A touch of Gothenburg on this one.]

Stranded on a distant shore
In far reaches of the mind
Afraid to open up the door
To the inside

Time and space have no more meaning
Where I am there is no way out
The silent moment before leaving
Way too loud

This is not how I want to be
Not even close to what I'd planned
Now you've taken it all out of me
Left me all alone drawing circles in the sand

No return to the familiar
Safe and soothing sanctuary
Everythng seems so malignant
Engulfed by treachery

What you did I can't forgive
Can barely understand
Only reason for me to live
My circles in the sand

This is not how I want to be
Not even close to what I'd planned
Now you've taken it all out of me
Left me all alone drawing circles in the sand
