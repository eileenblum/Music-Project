[This one's quite a basic Malpractice stomper with some complex instrumental parts and multi-layered vocals.
Once again the chorus is quite catchy (I'm probably gonna say this about every song on the album...)
The song is about how to describe colours to someone who has been blind all his life.]

Blindness - blindness is the eye of the beholder
Beholder - I have never seen
Through smoke and mirrors
Through cold and warm
Wide open eyes
Seeing nothing at all

Darkness all around
Only sense and sound
To paint my picture
Let me touch your face
Just a brief embrace
To paint your picture

Are black and white even colours
I cannot say
There's something in between them
The shades of grey

Staring - staring with my eyes wide open
Open - still seeing black
Could you describe me
Colours red and green
I cannot tell
'Cause I've never seen

Darkness all around
Only sense and sound
To paint my picture
Let me touch your face
Just a brief embrace
To paint your picture

Are black and white even colours
I cannot say
There's something in between them
The shades of grey
