Wrapped in leather and lace
She's waiting in the arms of Morpheus
To seduce the deads with its infinite charms

She's the fetish lady of the trees
When she sings
All the forest make love with her

Now covered only by the fog
She's still smile with her tender look
Crying on our cold corpses

She's the fetish lady of the trees
When she sings
All the forest make love with her

She cry for the rest of our soul
In her hand our hearts are so fresh
Please sing one more time for us ...

She's the fetish lady of the trees
When she sings
All the forest make love with her
