As I dive in my thoughts
Staring right into deeds I have done
Recap my present being
Why the core stays still secret?

Open up the essence of life

Existence has never been expounded
Existence will never...

No more maze
I don't want no more...
See the aim
Please awake me
No more fog above my consciousness
Show me the essence

Carrying and mercyful god
Hear our prayer and look down to our call
Provide us with sign of your goodness
And lead us in your path

No more maze
I don't want no more...
See the aim
Please awake me
No more fog above my consciousness
Show me the essence

Open up the essence of life

Existence has never been expounded
Existence will never have essence
