Inner consciousness 
Overspreading itself 
In never-ending universe 
Accepts new unknown knowledges 
Hovering and pouring from hidden sources which never desiccate.

Equilibrium 
Of the universe, 
Tremolant waves evoking feelingsâ¦ 
Feelings of endless being.

Balance of thoughts 
Enforce the acts 
Ripping the realms 
Of our minds
