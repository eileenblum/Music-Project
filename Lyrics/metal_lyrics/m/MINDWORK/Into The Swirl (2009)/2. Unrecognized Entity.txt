Youâre locked inside
Your own mind
Searching for the endless truth

Youâll never know
How far you are
Donât think youâre philosopher

Seeing only empty forms
Of things that might be our sense
But our world has no remorse
Be aware of it

It was too hard for me
To judge my life
It was too late for me...

My damaged sanity
Breaks out right now
Unrecognized entity

Now you think
That youâve swallowed
All the wisdom of the world

The labyrinth
You are rambling in
Is now becoming much bigger

It was too hard for me
To judge my life
It was too late for me...

My damaged sanity
Breaks out right now
Unrecognized entity
