Everyone of us
Plays the part of this absurd game
Whereâs no winner, no loser
No acount, no blame

Nobody is on turn
No one seems to care
Only mind their own world
Thatâs the only thing they dare

Pillars of heaven perforate
Under the weight of sins

Wretchless creatures surrounds me
Twisted reasons, stupidity

Watching all that pain
Others knots they survey
Becoming a slave of their mind
Devastate all mankind

Everyone of us
Plays the part of this absurd game
Whereâs no winner, no loser
No account, no blame

Nobody is on turn
No one seems to care
Only mindtheir own world
Thatâs the only thing they dare

Pillars of heaven perforate
Under the weight of sins

Wretchless creatures surrounds me
Twisted reasons, stupidity

Wretchlessness devoured me
Hopeless faces frighten me
