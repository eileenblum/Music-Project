In the time, nothing is impossible
So our life has been made
By the series of external influences
Seed of beeing has been sown

Are we the final product or at least on way to reach it?

Be quiet
And look into your soul
The truth may be there
And it'll find your way home

We're getting to know
But we never will know
We're still marching on
On the path to oblivion

Fixed on bowl we orbit that strange source of light
Inanely on and on
We are poor or we're significant
But surely nothing between

Are we the final product or at least on way to reach it?
