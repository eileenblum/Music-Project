Iâm closing my eyes
And taking my last breath
Now its too late to realize
That only thing which is certain
- nothing is certain â
Is our death

To feel, to breathe, to beâ¦
The core of life is sometimes hard to see
To sink, to wander, to live
In twisted priorities

To love without emotions
To learn without questions
To swim far in endless seas
Of twisted priorities

Take me back
Back to that dream
Take me back
Don't know what is real

Lines which are drawn
Deep in your mind
Have the same end
But it's blind

To feel, to breath, to beâ¦
The core of life is sometimes hard to see
To sink, to wander, to live
In twisted priorities

To love without emotions
To learn without questions
To swim far in endless seas
Of twisted priorities
