Just like every action has its reaction
Just like every deed has its consequence
Just like that - every evil has its root
Nothing is brought to this world by itself

Endeavor to cure what has already been poisoned
Is the endeavor to create a night
by shading the sun
The beginning is the place
where we should aim our vigilance

Every man is a sea
Into which all the rivers springing
from his childhood flow
Anything that the rivers deposit
Stays in the sea forever
What weâve sown is what we reap

Just like every action has its reaction
Just like every deed has its consequence
Just like that - every question has its answer
Whether we know it or not - it is there

Until we deny
That every our deed has its fatal consequence
Until we pretend
That we have no responsibility
Until then there is no help for us
