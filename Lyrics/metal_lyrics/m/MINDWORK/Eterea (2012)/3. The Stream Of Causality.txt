Just realize - your life is a drop in stream
Being carrying away by the law of causality
No matter how you try to influence your environment
Your drop of life will sooner or later end in the sea

Watch my eye and tell me what you see
Read my mind, how desperate should it be?

Flow down the river
Let it go, let yourself to be
Part of the stream of causality
Blown away by morning breeze
Devoured by reality
Poisoned by the smell of trees
Youâre caught in the stream of causality

Itâs too late to walk yourself away
But in a meantime you can count the words you say
Itâs too early to bring this life to itâs end
Just stay here and wait until His final command
