It's flowing in my veins
Pressurizes me moving on
This enthusiastic wave
Makes me feel like a lord of it all
Driven by this chemical process
I turned the scale
Not to finish it here and now
I will arise again

Everything leaving must firstly come
Every tension is undone
Despair is changing to hope
Pleasure is hanging on a rope

You whisper in my ear
That sun wonât rise again
I donât know why, but I believe
The answers that I found seem unuseful today
I feel like Iâm not any longer me

A values that I lived for turned into ash
Talk is useless, my dear
Echoes of blowing joy become slowly quiet
The stars of hope disappear

I feel that itâs coming again
Possibilities are opening wide now
Anything is real and nothing is unreal
This heet of a moment is mine
Driven by this chemical process
I turned the scale
Not to finish it here and now
I will arise again
