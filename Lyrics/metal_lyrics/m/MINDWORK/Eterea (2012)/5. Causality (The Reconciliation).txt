After I opened eyes again and finally realized
That there is no more chance to hide
I felt the shackles of the time holding us till we die
And weaken us each second of our life

Call it curiosity but I believe that you and me
Found a point where space and time collide
It was the same bright spark
that turned me back into dark
More than three years after I met you and you met me

But I wonât wait
I canât wait
I wonât wait
Until time will heal my scars

Life has slipped through my fingers
Iâm slowly loosing my sanity
Endless stream of different events
Iâm trapped inside this causality
Is this how it should be?

Event follows event covering our memories by dust
Old things are gone and new ones come
But when I walk that places we used to be
Despite the thousand things I hate on you
I want you to stay with me
