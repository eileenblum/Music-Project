Fear of new covenants our life is about to bring
Trust is like melting snow in early spring
Tones of doubts are falling on my head again
Broken glass - a symbol of this fragility

I renewed my mind
And made the first step out of line

Time is washing out my ego like drops of rain
I, Iâm slowly getting used to all that pain
I feel so tired of living life in permissibility
I need to find the way out from this binding patterns

I renewed my mind
And made the first step out of line

Line, a narrow way of how to survive
Resist a press of expectations
Try to depend only on your own mind
Now, release the tension

Inside out and outside in
I feel the need of new beginning
Let me breathe fresh air and forget all my sins
I need a new beginning

Inside out and outside in
I feel the need of new beginning
Let me taste a vibe of ultimate win
I need a new beginning
