Hey kids, don't look inside 'cause there ain't nothing to see
Just a man and his magic box
He's hypnotized and bulging
A prisoner of his own sloth
A fiery hound of hell is headed straight for me
But it's OK, I invited him in
He knows more than I do

Well ,the sun comes up as a lump of coal and the palm trees catch on fire
And you tap your confession on a cold, dead phone and you realize that you're a liar
There ain't nobody wanna follow you and there ain't no Fantastic Four
And if we're talking the God's honest truth, she don't think about you no more

No one looks into the eye of the Gorgon and lives
Uh, uh, baby that's just not the way it works
Not for this jerk
Peeking out of my shades I see a girl on a donkey
But she's riding away
No love today

Well ,the sun comes up as a lump of coal and the palm trees catch on fire
And you tap your excuses on a cold, dead phone, hey, anyone can be a liar
There's not a soul who wants to follow you and there ain't no Fantastic Four
And if we're talking the God's honest truth, she don't think about you no more

Well ,the sun comes up as a lump of coal and the palm trees catch on fire
And you tap your confession on a cold, dead phone and you realize that God's a liar
There ain't nobody wanna follow you and there ain't no Fantastic Four
And if we're talking the God's honest truth, she don't think about you no more
