In a world full of mud as far as you can see
No one will love your sorry ass like me
Hey baby, get in focus
I'm talking to you
Crawl into this cave so you can spit out some truth

I know your future's looking fine down at the lord's hotel

Well you pissed out the candles on your birthday cake
Come to me for the answer I'm your three-headed snake
Hey baby, need a doctor? want a teacher? need a scene?
Punk rockers love what's in the Yoo Hoo machine

You won't believe how much I care down at the lord's hotel
You gotta trust your mastermind and keep on ringing that bell

I know your future's looking fine, it's looking rosy as hell
You gotta trust your mastermind and keep on ringing that bell
