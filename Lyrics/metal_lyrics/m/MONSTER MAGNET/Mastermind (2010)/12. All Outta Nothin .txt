Bad bills and cherry bombs babe, are falling out of my head
I'm sitting before you. but I'm dead
You got something I want now honey, but it ain't what I need
Just show the doctor, let it bleed

I'm sick of my own shit, darlin', I can't take no more
Drag me out of my coma to the floor

I'm all outta nothing, there's nothing today
A burnt out magician with nothing to say

I've got my pick of the floppers, that's right
They're down at the store
But they ain't got a heartbeat
Give me more

I'm sick of the bullshit, baby
I won't take no more
Drag me out of my coma to the floor

I'm all outta nothing, there's nothing today
A burnt out magician with nothing to say
Who wants a miracle? Who wants to know?
I'm all outta nothing with nowhere to go

The storm's coming from miles away will be much different than yesterday
Call out, baby, and call out loud
Your head's too cool to get lost in the crowd
