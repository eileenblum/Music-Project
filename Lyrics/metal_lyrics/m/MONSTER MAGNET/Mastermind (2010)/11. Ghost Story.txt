Don't unpack your suitcase I wouldn't guess you'd be staying long
All the nighttime animals are telling me that I've lost your love
We could have made it forever but I killed it right from the start
I went on keeping my secrets leaving both of us with broken hearts

I'm living up on the moon now and baby, it's a lonely life
Taking notes and talking to your ghost and still staying up all night

I could beat my brains out
I could beg you to try and see
But there ain't enough lies in this universe that could spin you back to me
You had to see the creature and of course you couldn't understand
You couldn't swallow the darkness
You were just too scared

I could beat my brains out
I could beg you to try and see
But there ain't enough lies in this universe that could spin you back to me
I showed you the creature and of course you couldn't take anymore
I put you in the darkness and I shut that door
