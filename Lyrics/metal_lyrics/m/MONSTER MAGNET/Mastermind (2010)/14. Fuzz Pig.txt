[Bonus Track]Now stick a pin in that old, fat sun
Bring the curtain down 'cross the sky
This man can chew on some bubblegum
And on that you can rely
She waits outside my little hole
I've been stuck there for a thousand years
There's no way through without paying her toll
And that's drowning in her hopeless tears

I guess that's the price for being nice
I got what I deserve

I'm in love
I'm in love

Midnight comes and I'm out of smokes
But the dance has just begun
That old raccoon is in the garbage can
And your girlfriend is as good as done

Yes, that's the way the taco folds
2 minus 1 is 1

I'm in love
I'm in love
