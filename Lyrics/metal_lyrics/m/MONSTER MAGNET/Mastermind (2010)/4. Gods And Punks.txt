When your mind goes blank in the pouring rain
And you can't get back on your feet again
Well, your girlfriend tells you the world is dead
And it just ain't working inside your head

Get along, little doggie, get on
No one else is gonna sing your song
You can fuck recovery 'cause you're already gone

I'm a stone jet-fighter with a heart of gold
Well I'm really mad and I'm really old
And I rule this planet from high above
It's time I sacrificed all my love

And if you don't like what you see
Go ahead and take it out on me
I'm the big pig apocalypse and I ain't hard to please

I'm a stone jet-fighter with a heart of gold
And I rule this planet from high above
I take what I take because I want what I want
And tonight I'm gonna rock with the gods and punks
