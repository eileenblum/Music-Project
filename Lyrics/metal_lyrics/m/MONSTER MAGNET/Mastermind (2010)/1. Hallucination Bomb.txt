Welcome to the grand adventure
You'll want it fast but you'll take it slow
Welcome to the cave of sorrow that every other one knows
I understand you want some answers so you're casting out the line
I gotta tell you that being truthful takes up too much of my time

Always have the best hallucinations, baby
Cobras and fire

You could raise the setting sun
you're naked number one
I never loved a dirty omen quite like you
You can worship on the worm or crash the car and burn
I'm pretty sure we'll get what we deserve

Always have the best hallucinations, baby
Cobras and fire
Shake your thing in horny celebration
Honk if you love my lies

She's got her fuel pump and her razor wire
She's got me running like a three-legged dog
She's got her space rock and her holy war
The mule is biting on my nipple all day
I'm like the last boy in the acid bath
I feel my mind just slipping away
She loves her space rock and her holy war
That mule is biting at my nipple all day

Always have the best hallucinations, baby
Cobras and fire
Shake your thing in horny celebration
Honk if you love my lies
