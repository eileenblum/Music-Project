Darling, let me dry up all your tears
How about Luna Park tonight and the Algiers?
Remember how we stole the pharaohs' gold?
We laughed at all the rubes as they got old

That's all fine if you have a time machine
But I broke mine, can't you see
Now I'm here on the edge of the world
Missing you, it's true
I'm missing you

I think I'll go to 1969
I'll buy some comic books and replay my whole life
Bills come in that I'll never have to pay
And I can mend your heart when I change yesterday

Life is fine if you have a time machine
But I broke mine, can't you see
Now I sit throwing rocks off the world
Missing you
It's true
I miss you
