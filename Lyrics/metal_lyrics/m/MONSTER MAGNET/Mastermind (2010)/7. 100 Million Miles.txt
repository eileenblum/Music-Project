Ice girl, she's waiting for me on the second moon
If I can blast this crazy loop I'm gonna be there soon
Did you hear your mother threw another sucker to the sun?
He looks a lot like the good old boys of Apollo One

Mama, Mama tell me I ain't gonna die
Maybe baby say you found the astroglide

Hey, there ain't no pay
100 million miles away

Mad god took my girl and made time stand still
I used to hate that story freak and now I always will
Dead planets ain't no fun, I'm coming in way off time
That constellation looks just like my baby's sweet behind
