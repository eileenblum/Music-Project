When the flood comes I ain't gonna drown
I'm going on a mission
I'm going on a mission

When the world burns I ain't gonna die
It's OK
It's OK

Hallelujah brothers, hallelujah girls
Dancing in the fire with your flap jacks set on stun
Press the button, baby
watch that bacon fry
That's the way
That's the way

Just the notion gets me off
One more disaster and I'm gone

When the planes fall from the sky you'll understand
when the ocean turns to flame you'll understand
when you watch my baby move you'll want to take her hand
When Galactus eats your meds you'll fucking understand

I can feel you coming from a million miles away
You'll be cursing your libido come the judgement day
Move, you little monkey, shake it for me more
I can give you five before I shut my bedroom door

When the planes fall from the sky you'll understand
when the oceans start to boil you'll understand
when you watch my baby move you'll want to take her hand
When Galactus fucks your wife I think you'll understand
