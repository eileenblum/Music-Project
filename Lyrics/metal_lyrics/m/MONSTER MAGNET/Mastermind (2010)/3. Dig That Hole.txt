I can't sleep at night cause that's the only time when I feel truly free
And I just wanna drive my car
I'm not sure where I'm going but at least I ain't standing still
I'm feeling nervous and my doctor says to me "boy, that ain't nothing that a pill won't cure"

Me
This is all about me
I'm a buzz-word, bluetooth jerk-off on TV
And I ain't gonna try too hard
I wanna win a contest and break off my piece of the American dream
Give me a bonus 'cause the world has fried my head
I just want what I deserve

Dig that hole
I said to dig that hole, baby

I wanna start a fire
Fly a jet, save a dog or get paid for being right
I can't always understand this world
The kids just seem to wanna spray paint the word "nigger" on the wall
Guess I forgive them for they know not what they do
Maybe society's just lost its cool

Dig that hole
C'mon c'mon dig that hole
