Looks like snow is gonna fall
And I'm just waiting at the station
Hey there brother have you got the time
To share a cup of radiation

Looks like big doggie's on the move
Telling the little doggies what to do
Hey sister have you heard the news
The world's gonna be a better place for me and you
Looks like big doggie's on the move
Telling the little doggies what to do
Pull up a seat now and gather round
We'll spark it up as we count it down
I said 10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 Yeah!

Take me Jesus, take me Allah, rape me in my room
Torch our days in paranoia while we gorge ourselves on gloom
Give me pills and understanding, release me from my spell
Got to dance in my own heaven on the verge of all out hell

Looks like big doggie's on the move
Telling the little doggie's what to do
Hey sister have you heard the news
It's gonna be a better
place for me and you
