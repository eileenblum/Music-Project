You know you're quite a hot topic
You gotta nothin' in your head
You got your ass in the back seat
We all agree you're over fed

You're from the suck generation
Like a doggie with a bone
You like your lame fuckin' music
You love talkin' on your phone

You're stone monolithic
I smell it on your breath
You gotta 'bout nothin' to say
Keep spending all your money
And love yourself to death
'Till daddy takes your T-Bird away

You want a new load of garbage
I'd love to drop it at your door
Your gonna eat it little piggy
You always gotta have some more
You're stone monolithic
I smell it on your breath
You gotta 'bout a nothin' to say
So download some garbage
And bake your empty head
'Till daddy takes your T-Bird away

Monolithic Baby [x4]

You're stone monolithic
I smell it on your breath
You gotta 'bout nothin' to say
Keep spending all your money
And love yourself to death
'Till daddy takes your T-Bird away
