Too bad you couldn't take the fun
That life gives you for free

I know you gotta blame someone
So it might as well be me

I learned a long time ago
That you gotta shake hands with pain

Too bad the only thing you learned was
A million ways to complain

Oh well we've gone the mile
You forgot how to smile
Too bad I gotta say
Don't go away mad, just go away
Last night I had a crazy dream that I
Was playing on a real cool team
The sound was just alright and I was scratching
On a leaning tree

Drink alone and pissin' and moaning
That just ain't my style
Too bad your such a pain in the ass
That you never had a chance at all
