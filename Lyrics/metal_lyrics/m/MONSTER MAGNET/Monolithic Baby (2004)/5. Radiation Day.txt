Corporation bigwigs
A keep us alive boy
You can try to run
But baby you can't hide
Go ahead and you jerk off
Your bitches with a Samsung

Modern life is a eating you alive

So keep a blast of love and napalm
Rollin' through your head
Watch the tube enough
To freak you, before you
Go to bed
I never had the nerve
To love you, I couldn't
Find my way
Now I've got the chops to nail you
On radiation day

Come on out and play
Ain't no time to waste
They got a pill that'll guarantee
You a hard one
They got a box where can
can always play
So don't strain your brain now
Brother, your mammy's back in town
Just drink her milk and it'll be O.K.

I got a blast of love and napalm
Rollin' through my head
Watch the tube enough
To freak you, before you
Go to bed
I never had the nerve
To love you, I couldn't
Find my way
Now I've got the chops to nail you
On radiation day

Come on out and play
Ain't now time to waste
Give yourself away
Radiation day
