Drowning in your puddle, waiting at the sky
Suckin' on your daddy's cigar
I'm your destination, I'm the reason why
Lemma take a look at your scars

Bought a line of shit
Now you wanna sell it back to me

Come on down to the hotel baby
I can be what you want me to be
You can choke on your own medication
I can watch myself on T.V. oh yeah

Bathe in all the money
Love yourself to death
Bow before the serpent in fire
Ride your little poney 'till you're soaking wet
Scream at God and call him a liar

Bought a line of shit
Now you wanna sell it back to me
Come on down to the hotel baby
I can be what you want me to be
You can choke on your own medication
I can watch myself on T.V.

Shut your mouth you big fuckin' baby
You can't be what I want you to be
Go on choke on your own medication
I can tell you a lie you believe
