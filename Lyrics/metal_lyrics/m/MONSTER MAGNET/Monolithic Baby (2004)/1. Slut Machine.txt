Sing that song a gotta gotta you get
Along baby
Shove that tongue a straight a to
The back of my head
You got tongue a honey honey
Use that tongue baby
Climb on top and rock a rolla
Me 'till in dead
Girl I'm melting away and your fine and grown
Hey now you whisper your dirt
And I'll do you strong
Sing that song a firecracker
Sing that song a baby
You got smoke that drives
A monkey out of his head
Dig yourself a kinda like a
I do yourself baby
The king of dreams a gotta
Have queen of the bed
Babe I'm melting away
And your fine and grown
Hey now you scream out your
Dirt until I explode
Slut machine to keep my lovin strong
Slut machine to keep my lovin' strong
