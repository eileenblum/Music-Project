There's no way out of here
When you come in
You're in for good
There was no promise made
The part you've played
The chance you took
There are no boundaries set
The time and yet
You waste it still

So it slips through your hands
Like grains of sand
You watch it go
There's no time to be lost
You'll pay the cost
So get it right
There's no way out of here
When you come in
You're in for good

Your life slips through your hands
Like grains of sand
You watch it go
There's no time to be lost
You'll pay the cost
If you say no
There's no way out of here
When you come in
You're in for good
You blow your only chance away

There are no answers here
When you look out
You don't see in
There was no promise made
The part you've played
The chance you took
There's no way out of here
When you come in
You're in for good
