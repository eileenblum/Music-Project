Breathin' hard when you swim in the mirror
Breathin' fire like a rich girl should
Come alive in the back of my trailer
Come alive when your carvin' my wood

Super cruel hot shit baby
You've never been treated right
Super cruel, TV's garbage
Shut your eyes real tight

Cry for your mother, sing for your brothers in hell
Pray for the daddy who smacks you up
Drink from the specimen in my cup

Such a strain when you live on a dead star
Such a bummer when your money is dry
Plug yourself on the hammer of God now
We all love it when you shiver and die

How were you to know
That the sun would come out at midnight baby
That the reds would turn out to be speed
How were you to know that I'd be super cruel
