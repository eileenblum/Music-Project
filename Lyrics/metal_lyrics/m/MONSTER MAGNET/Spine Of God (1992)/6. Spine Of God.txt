I just had to get nice last night
My mind is so free
You wouldn't believe
You wouldn't believe
I just had to gas a pig last night
My mind is so full
You wouldn't believe
Nature's got a way, brothers
of scraping the bowl
eye of the hurricane

I sold a hundred hits to a hundred heads
that will never come back
You know what I mean
Peace is what you get from a chemical change
yeah, yeah
You don't yank on the Spine of God
You get what you give, you know what I mean
Don't be surprised there's a bug in your eye

There ain't no pioneers
I just smoke what I like
from what's already there.
Sadie Atkins, she's just a whithered old hag now
Unreachable... unfuckable.
So ride me, baby, in my bed of sweat and truth
and babble and groan words of praise and love
and fry like a pig
in the heart of the sun...

I sold a hundred hits to a hundred heads
that will never come back
You know what I mean
Peace is what you get from the Chemical King
yeah, yeah
You don't yank on the Spine of God
You get what you give, you know what I mean
Don't be surprised there's a bug in your eye

Why don't you see it for what it is, a fuckin' freakshow
If you take a lot it will kill you

The Center of the Universe
The Center of the Universe
I love everyone
I love everyone
Yeah, everyone
I love everyone
I love everyone.
