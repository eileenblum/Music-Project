Earspot in a cornfield
We got a girl in an army coat
Pull up the Gran Turino
And play some music for the holy ghost
Go go go
Yeah baby smoke them bones
Praise be to the Bullgod
She got fleas stuck all over her skin
Take a dive in the nose bleed
And let the snake dance begin
She licked a sheet of blotter
Now she's breathing through her teeth
Hissing like a snake with tits and
Squirming up to me
Go go go
Yeah baby smoke them bones
Go go go
I'm so fucking stoned
If Satan lived in Heaven he'd be me
And acid dirty doves and stupid sheep
That bone did triple I can make you see
Rub that naked belly up to me
Go go go
Yeah baby smoke them bones
Go go go
I'm so fucking stoned
If Satan lived in Heaven he'd be me
And acid dirty doves and stupid sheep
That bone did triple, I can make you see
Rub that naked belly up to me
Up to me yeah
Up to me
Up to me, yeah
Up to me
