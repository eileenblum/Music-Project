Bought another copy of fragile
Seeds were bustin' up the spine
I think I cracked my skull doin' airplanes
Not too many Bud's just fine
Pussy scratch and sniff in a playboy
Christ I'm a good looking man

15 miles to cop on our Sting Rays
Boys we're gonna ride tonight
Goofballs and the 70's nipples
Gotta get our heads just right
Sit me in the lap of the god's babe
Cover me with skin and hair

Bought another copy of zoso
Seeds were bustin' up the spine
I think I wet my pants doin' Whippits
Not too many Bud's just fine
Sit me in the lap of the god's babe
Cover me with skin and hair
Ride a number one on the home train
SCREW YOU IF YOU THINK I CARE................SMOKE
