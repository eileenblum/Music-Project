I'm up to my brain in the mire of an ancient swamp
Pteranadon smiles at me and flies up to god
Baby let me drink deep from your globes of reality
Writhe your naked ass to the mindless groove

baby give your tongue a taste and follow me up to my room
the bullgod has your head, and baby thats just fine
now it is time, we became the mighty cell
wrap those hungry jacks? to the mindless groove

they say we've got a lifetime, but we know that ain't true
I will not be denied, I will not be denied

baby I, the faster you gyrate the faster we'll be there

arms up overhead, a goddess in the ancient song
work that mighty world to the mindless groove

they say we've got a life time but we know that ain't true
I will not be denied, I will not be denied
they say we've got a lifetime, but we know that ain't true
I will not be denied I will not be denied
