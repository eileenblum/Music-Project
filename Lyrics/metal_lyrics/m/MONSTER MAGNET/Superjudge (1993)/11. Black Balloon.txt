Hey man what's your name?
I've seen your face always before
Tapped in to a cosmic fame
Got the gig I was looking for yeah
Hungry, that's no drag
It's nothing that a trip won't cure
Completion is in that bag
Selfish crowd come back for more
Well I reached in the bag for a new latitude
And all I got out was a black balloon
Was a black balloon
Was a black balloon
Hey babe, I'm out of the cage
Behind some glass miles away
So sue me for being too cool
I hate myself for wanting to play
Guess all I've got to say about karma's true
Cos all I've got left is a black balloon
Is a black balloon
Is a black balloon
Is a black balloon
Is a black balloon
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah


Thanks to psychonaut13 for sending track #1 lyrics.
