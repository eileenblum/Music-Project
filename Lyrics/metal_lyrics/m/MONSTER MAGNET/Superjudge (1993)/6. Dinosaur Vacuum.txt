Take me to the sunspot, now I wanna go home
Flash on the Citadel, having too much fun
Atomical baby, I think your moon is dead
Last push of royalty into your bobbing head
Dinosaur vacuum wanna take me home
Dinosaur vacuum wanna take me home
Thunder in a tube top, now I wanna get high
Slaves of the mother rock, cut me another line
Atomical babe, I know you burn alright
Try to find a dope mule, into another light
Dinosaur vacuum wanna take me home [4x]

Dinosaur vacuum [8x]
