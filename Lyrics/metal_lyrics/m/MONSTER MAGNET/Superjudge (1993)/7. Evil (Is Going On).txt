You're a long way from home
And you can't sleep at night
Grab your telephone
Now something ain't right
And that's evil
Evil
Going home baby
I said I'm warning you brothers
You'd better watch your happy home
Long way from home
And you can't sleep at night
Feels like another mule's kickin' in my stall
And that's evil
Evil
Going out baby
I said I'm warning you brothers
You'd better watch your happy home
Watch your happy
Watch your happy, happy home
You're a long way from home
And you can't sleep at night
Feels like another mule's kickin' in my stall
And that's evil
Evil
Going home baby
I said I'm warning you brothers
You'd better watch your happy home
Watch your happy
Watch your happy, happy home
Evil yeah
Evil right
Evil yeah
Evil now
