Move over little insect
It's time for you to go
I don't wanna have to tell you twice
You come to me tomorrow
Saying you found my head in the fields
I couldn't swear that it's mine
Been talking to the bottle
And it roars out how I feel
There's nothing, nothing here
There's a doorway and a fuel pump
The taste of another mind
You can bake me in your cancer
You can cook me in your spoon
Put a bowl in my heart now
Don't know who you're praying to
Ain't gonna stand in the rocket's shadow
My mama's waiting for me on the moon
My dick just got a million times bigger
I'll be pumping Andromeda soon
Rise boy, rise boy
Ain't gonna stand in the rocket's shadow
My mama's waiting for me on the moon
My dick just got a million times bigger
I'll be pumping Andromeda soon
Rise boy, rise boy
Rise boy, rise boy
