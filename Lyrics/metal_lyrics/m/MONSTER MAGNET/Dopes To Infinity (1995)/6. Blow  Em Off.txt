When you said alright
I thought you meant alright
When you said that's fine
I thought you meant that's fine
I guess some standards don't always apply

When the kid goes home
He always goes alone
He hides in the machine
And always stays fourteen
Well there's really nothing wrong with the plan
He goes to sleep at night and holds his own hand
It's inconceivable there could be an end

Who brings you back when you're gone gone gone...
Who keeps saying your prayers when you blow 'em off
Who keeps alive the concept of mom
Who cares to care when they're really scared
When you're really scared

When you said alright
I thought you meant alright
When you said that's fine
I thought you meant that's fine
Well there is the answer on the tip of my tongue
There's the bubble on the face of the moon
There's a chamber that should always be full

Who brings you back when you're gone gone gone...
Who keeps saying your prayers when you blow 'em off
Who keeps alive the concept of mom
Who cares to care when they're really scared
When they're really scared

Who brings you back when you're gone gone gone...
Who keeps saying your prayers when you blow 'em off
Who keeps alive the concept of mom
Who cares to care when they're really scared
When they're really scared

When they're really scared
