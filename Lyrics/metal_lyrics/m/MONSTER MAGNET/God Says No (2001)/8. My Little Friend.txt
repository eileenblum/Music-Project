This little creatue is a monster
She likes to drink and get so mean
A vampire sucking on your vision
They like to get you dressed and clean
Hey baby what's your sign
That's something you gotta know
Won't you meet my little friend
You wanna see my face again

Dig this experimatic genius
It's so much better from behind
You is high priestess of formality baby
Look in the mirror your a star
Keep on begging but I ain't no fool
You're pretty like a junkie
But I bet you kick like a mule

Won't you meet my little friend
You wanna see my face again
Won't you meet my little friend
You wanna see my face again
