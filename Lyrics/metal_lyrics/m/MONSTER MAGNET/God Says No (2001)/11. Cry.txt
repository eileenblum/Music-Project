Love lies in pools of questions
Love stays away from me
Love dies and there's no question
I'm gone baby I'm all the way gone

Call me your lousy father
Call me your demon king
Call me your new tornado
Right here baby, together we stay

I dont think I can feel any longer
I only know that the void is getting stronger
The only time that it's real is when you cry

Here's a torch to burn your cancer
Here's a hand to fill the hole
Lost souls need simple answers
It feels good to do what your told

I dont think I can feel any longer
I only know that the void is getting stronger
The only time that it's real is when you cry

So lick the mirror and love yourself
My sweetest baby has gone to hell
I hear your heartbeat your eye is a shrine
I drink your teardrops now burn me alive

The sky splits open and the ocean swells
If your in limbo then I'm in hell
So lick the mirror and love yourself
My sweetest baby has joined me in hell
join me in hell

I dont think I can feel any longer
I only know that the void is getting stronger
The only time that it's real is when you cry

I dont think I can feel any longer
I only know that the void's getting stronger
The only time that it's real is when you cry

So lick the mirror, and love yourself
My sweetest baby has gone to hell
I hear your heartbeat your eye is a shrine
I drink your teardrops, now burn me alive
