Wakin' up, I watch another sun go down
Another day spent underground
In my world of pills
And I was thinkin' how the world should have cried
On the day Jack Kirby died
I wonder if I'm ill
I'll never trust myself again
But I don't care
Just set that plastic soul on fire
And watch it melt

Life is good, a rocket sled utopia
A self imposed myopia
You gotta love this pace
Life is fast, a million winners everyday
You tell me, is this work or play
I'm never really sure
I'll never trust myself again
But I don't care
Well just set that plastic soul on fire
And watch it melt

Well I'm alive, now you watch me go
A tickle inside my brain
Where it comes from I don't know
But I'm laughin' in the flames
It's just the look in your eyes
I feel like I can fly
And then sometimes I dig it so much, I could die

I'll never make no mortal place
'Cause I don't care
Just set that plastic world on fire
And watch it melt

Well I'm alive, now you watch me go
A tickle inside my brain
Where it comes from I don't know
But I'm laughin' in the flames
It's just the look in your eyes
I feel like I can fly
And then sometimes I dig it so much, I could die
