You've been walking down the highway
Your coming into your home
As you drown in your pool of madness
Your never gonna be alone
That's why I'm here

Look up child and love your savior
The scorpion is in my eyes
Its time to strip our souls naked
The freedom of all disguise
When you take me aside
To become an immortal
The warmths of the flesh now
Are gonna set you free

You'll swim in the sweat of a million orgies
You'll live in the fire of a sweetest hell
And bear your soul to the rays of a mortal sun
And give your lips to the kiss of the scorpion

I ain't the creator and I ain't satan
I come from another place
Trust with me your fingers baby
There's eternity on my face
This world ain't big enough for your questions
I deal with the stars now just to get you right

It's time you suck the cock of the Fire God

You'll swim in the sweat of a million orgies
You'll live in the fire of a sweetest hell
And bear your soul to the rays of a mortal sun
And give your lips to the kiss of the scorpion

You'll swim in the sweat of a million orgies
You'll live in the fire of a sweetest hell
And bear your soul to the rays of a mortal sun
And give your lips to the kiss of the scorpion
The scorpion
