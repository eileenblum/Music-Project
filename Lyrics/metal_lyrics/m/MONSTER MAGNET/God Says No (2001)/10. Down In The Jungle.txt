I feel like a ghost in my own life
The rumour promised to do me right now
Whose life is out on my TV
Well, that's the way it's supposed to be

Down in the jungle you're the fucking queen
Down in the jungle you're the fucking queen
I'm telling you baby you're my only fun
They're gone and left the planet to the chosen ones

Look to the bottom there ain't no soul
And I'm in love with a big black hole
But I can dig it 'cause I'm a hound
We got the garbage as our playground

Well maybe in the future I can be your man
Well maybe if I fuck you I can hold your hand
I'm telling you baby you're my only fun
They're gone and left the planet to the chosen ones

Down in the jungle you're the fucking queen
Down in the jungle you're the fucking queen
I'm telling you baby you're my only fun
They're gone and left the planet to the chosen ones

Thanks, you left me dick
I give it back
You kiss my ass
'Cause you're out of peace
While you whine and pray
You give it all away
Now it's mine all mine
Now it's mine all mine

Down in the jungle you're the fucking queen
Down in the jungle you're the fucking queen
I'm telling you baby you're my only fun
They're gone and left the planet to the chosen ones

Down in the jungle you're the fucking queen
Down in the jungle you're the fucking queen
I'm telling you baby you're my only fun
They're gone and left the planet to the chosen ones
Gonna leave the planet for the chosen ones
