The mountain's coming
He's walking down your street
The mountain's coming
He's got wings on his feet
There's two suns in the sky today
And one's at your door
When you feed the mountain
He's gonna feed you some more
And then you know
No time for heaven or hell
Just try to understand each other baby
Down in the gravity well

Diablo's coming
He's gonna slap your face
He's gonna feed you shit for breakfast
He's gonna ask how it tastes
He's a little punk
He loves when he wins
He wants you chubby
So he can make you thin
No time for heaven or hell
Let's just try to understand each other baby
Down in that gravity well
Let's go
Your a little time bomb
You sure love your game
Your imagination's gonna drive me insane
I'm gonna join your circus
I'm gonna catch your train
Your making my cock like a pistol on my side baby upside your brain
No time for heaven or hell you understand me
Let's just try to understand each other baby
Down in that gravity well
