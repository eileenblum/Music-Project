Hey little sister
Let's get together and cry
They teach us how to wiggle
But they won't tell us why
Lay out naked in a sunny L.A.
The first ones to sizzle on the judgement day

I said hey little sister
Let's get together and cry
The world says I need some help
I'm floating on a big white cloud
I guess you say I'm not myself
Somebody called it all shook out

Citizens of Sodom, I'm gonna show you the light
Well I am tomorrow you better get that right
We'll all be together when we dig that hole
You ain't seen nothing like my eager soul
I said children of the atom I'm gonna set you right

The world says I need some help
I'm floating on a big white cloud
I guess you'd say I'm not myself
Somebody called it all shook out

Hey little sister
Let's get together and cry
A little slap and tickle
We'll find the reasons why
I'm writing history with the back of my hand
Well just like your daddy did in Vietnam
I said children of the atom let's get together and die
The future whispered in my ear
Said go ahead and have some fun
The suckers giving up their souls
It's gravy for the gods and punks
The world says I need some help
I'm floating on a big white cloud
I guess you say I'm not myself
Somebody called it all shook out
