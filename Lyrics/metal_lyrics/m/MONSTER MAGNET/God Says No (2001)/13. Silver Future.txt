Hey little cookie take a walk my way
I like to hear what you have to say
You know the truth and your so put together
Baby I could stick you on the lip of forever
Even a volcano has a price to pay

What kinda creature do we have here
It feels like love but it smells like fear
Look in the mirror baby what do you dream
Look at it harder now and you start to scream
We finding out what drives your machine

You stand on the edge of a silver future
You stand on the edge of a silver future

Hey no we don't let go we all need a daddy
Hey no we don't let go we all need a daddy
Hey no we don't let go we all need a daddy
Hey no we don't let go we all need a daddy
Live in the mirror baby you are the dream
You smash that fucker now and you'll get so clean
Come on and show me what drives your machine

Hey no we don't let go we all need a daddy
Hey no we don't let go we all need a daddy
Hey no we don't let go we all need a daddy
Hey no we don't let go we all need a daddy

You stand on the edge of a silver future
You stand on the edge of a silver future
You stand on the edge of a silver future
You stand on the edge of a silver future

Hey no we don't let go we all need a daddy
Hey no we don't let go we all need a daddy
Hey no we don't let go we all need a daddy
Hey no we don't let go we all need a daddy
Hey no we don't let go we all need a daddy
Hey no we don't let go we all need a daddy
Hey no we don't let go we all need a daddy
Hey no we don't let go we all need a daddy
