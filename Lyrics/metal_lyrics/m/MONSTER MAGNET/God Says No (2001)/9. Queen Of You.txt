Spinning in your apartment
Climbing the walls so stoned
Crazy we live in a world of billions
Your only friend is a phone
Every single time he says he knows who you are
Thats every single time you know he lies

He loves you he hates you
He loves you he hates you

Seems you found your wings now if wings could fly
Every now and then you gotta clear that sky
Your such a little demon whats a demon to do
The time has come to crown yourself the Queen
The Queen of You

Your such a creature of comfort
Your body commands your mind
Big appetizing and a sense of adventure
Can slap yourself over the line
Every single time he says he knows you want some
That's every single time you know he's right

You love him, you hate him
You love him, you hate him

Seems you found your wings now if wings could fly
Every now and then you gotta clear that sky
Your such a little demon whats a demon to do
The time has come to crown yourself the Queen
The Queen of You

You got a new apartment
And I know your not alone
Whenever you've got a good thing going
You never answer the phone
We're all catures of comfort
Our bodies betray our wills
When it all turns real and our hearts get threatened
We gotta go in for the kill
Every single time we think we have the answers
That's every single time we get suprised

We love life, we hate life
We love life, we hate life

Seems you found your wings now if wings could fly
Every now and then you gotta clear that sky
You're such a little demon, whats a demon to do
The time has come to crown yourself the Queen of You

Seems you found your wings now if wings could fly
Every now and then you gotta clear that sky
You're such a little demon whats a demon to do
The time has come to crown yourself the Queen
The Queen of You

We love life, we hate life
We love life, we hate life
