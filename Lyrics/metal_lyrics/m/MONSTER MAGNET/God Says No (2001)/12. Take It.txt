Oh little baby you're so fucked up
To much of that and there ain't no love
Stay in the closet and be real still
Daddy's gonna feed you another pill
Tell me what you want and I'll give it back
I think you like a little tiny heart attack
Smoking cigarettes in the morning sun
Sleep and then your ready for another round

You're gonna take it
(Take it)
Any way you can
You're gonna take it
(Take it)
Any way you can

Honeybee a-buzzin' in my head today
I think it wasn't guilty but it flew away
Saw you with your lover you look so fine
And now you're on the phone and asking me what time
No matter what you say no matter what you do
I'm never gonna judge you 'cause I'm worse than you
Down in the shadows we make quite a pair
And life is so much better when you can share

You're gonna take it
(Take it)
Any way you can
You're gonna take it
(Take it)
Any way you can

You're gonna take it
(Take it)
Any way you can
You're gonna take it
(Take it)
Any way you can
