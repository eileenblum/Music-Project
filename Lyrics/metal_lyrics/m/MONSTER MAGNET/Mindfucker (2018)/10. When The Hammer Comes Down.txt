I feel that double sign arriving
I feel it burning down the line
Karma's a bitch, kid
I hope you bought her a ring
'Cause you're gonna be together for a long, long time

You tapped a supernova
When you left the truth to drown
The universe will treat you right
When the hammer comes down

(Yeah!)

Well the world has a way
Of making suckers pay
Forgotten fools and jerk offs
Lays all over yesterday
Live by sword brother
You know the rest of that line
A funny thing 'bout truth, boy
It'll get you every time

You love that supernova
But it'll always let you down
The universe will get you right
When the hammer comes down

Tell me if you're a monkey
Or tell me if you're a man
You're waving a rag from a pickup truck
Like it was Custer's last stand

Well you just keep on rocking alpha
From the dumb ass side of town
And may I advise that you cover your eyes
'Cause the hammer's coming down

(Hammer's coming down)
(Hammer's coming down)
(Hammer's coming down)
(Hammer's coming down)

Do you feel that double sum arising
I feel it burning down the line
Karma's a bitch, people
I hope you bought a nice bed
'Cause you're gonna be together for a long, long time

You tapped a supernova
When you left the truth to drown
The universe will treat you right
When the hammer comes down, yeah

Yeah!
