Fever and dreams
Head white queen
You like it best from above
Baby, I'm gone
But I'm coming on
Is this your version of love

Oh won't you tell me,
Why you gotta play with my head?

Teasing the world
With your nuclear churn
The girl with cyclopean eye
My revolution is dead
As I lay in my bed
Your motion just begs me to cry

Girl you're a snake
I need your bite
You do me wrong
I'll do you right

How can I explain,
With what's left of my brain?
I can't tell what's wrong or what's right

Oh won't you tell me,
Why you gotta drill in my head?
Why you gotta lie 'til I'm crazy?

You're a mindfucker baby
Look what you done to my head
You're a mindfucker baby
Setting fire to my bed
Soul crushing love child
Deep inside of my brain
You're a mindfucker baby
Beautiful and insane

(Yeah)
(Go, go, go, go)
(Hey!)

Check of my soul, pretty baby
I guess you wouldn't call it a brain
You [?] a hole live forever
Tripping on my please and pain
There ain't no one who can save me
And I'm thinking I don't want it to end
So eat up my soul and rip me off blind
Kill me all over again

Oh won't you tell me,
Why you gotta fill in my head?
Why you gotta lie 'til I'm crazy?

You're a mindfucker baby
Look what you done to my head
You're a mindfucker baby
Setting fire to my bed
Soul crushing love child
Deep inside of my brain
You're a mindfucker baby
Beautiful and insane

Why you gotta fuck with my head
Why you gotta fuck with my head
Why you gotta fuck with my head, yeah
Why you gotta fuck with my head

Why you gotta fuck with my head
Why you gotta fuck with my head
Why you gotta fuck with my head, yeah
Why you gotta fuck with my head

Yeah
Oh no
Oh
