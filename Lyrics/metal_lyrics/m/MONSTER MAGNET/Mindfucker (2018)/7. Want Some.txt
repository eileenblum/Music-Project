Well they call me son of the cobra
I'm the one true master of sound
And I love to take the ears of punks like you now
And beat 'em on into the ground
By all rights I should be dead now
But I never give nothing away
I'm plugging into a million strong
I'm the future of the human race

Wake it up now little doggie
You've been dreaming in black and white
If you want off of this burning world now
You're gonna have to shine that light

Well I just finished tapping your mother
On the deep, dark side of the moon
She rides my legion like no other
That demon knows just what to do
Well I could use your imagination
But I don't you got none at all
When you get off your medication baby
Why don't you give me a call

Wake it up now little doggie
You've been dreaming in black and white
It's such a shame your lazy daddy
Never taught his baby how to fight
Wake it up now little doggie
You've been dreaming in black and white
If you want off of this burning world now
You're gonna have to shine that light

Well if you want some
Nobody does it like me
And if you need some
You know where you gotta be
I made all of my music in outer space
And I'm the stone cold future of the human race
And if you want some
Nobody does it like me

Wake it up now little doggie
You've been dreaming in black and white
It's such a shame your lazy daddy
Never taught his baby how to fight
Wake it up now little doggie
You've been dreaming in black and white
If you want off of this burning world now
You're gonna have to shine that light

Well if you want some
Nobody does it like me
And if you need some
You know where you gotta be
I made all of my music in outer space
And I'm the stone cold future of the human race
And if you want some
Nobody does it like me

If you want some
Nobody does it like me
And if you need some
You know where you gotta be
I made all of my music in outer space
And I'm the stone cold future of the human race
And if you want some
Nobody does it like me
