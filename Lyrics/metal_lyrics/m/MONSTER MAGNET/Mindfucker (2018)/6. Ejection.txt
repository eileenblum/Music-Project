[originally by Robert Calvert]There's only one course of action
Left for me to take
I've tried every switch selection
That might control this state
I think for my protection
I'd better make it straight

Into ejection
I better tell base
Ejection
That I think it's a case for
Ejection
I'm blown into space
Ejection
Protect my face
Ejection

The radar screen's projection
Tells me I'm too late
To make a course correction
I'm about to meet my fate
No time for reflection
I'd better make it straight

Into ejection
I bust through the sky
Ejection
The air rushing by
Ejection
It's a case of goodbye
Ejection
I'm too fast to die
Ejection

Yeah!

When a ship meets with destruction
The captain stays to drown
But no tin contraption
Is gonna drag me down
My reference intersection
Tells me that I'm bound

For ejection
I'm eight times my weight
Ejection
I've got to escape, oh
Ejection
Only one move to make
Ejection
Abandon this crate
Ejection
Ejection
Ejection
Ejection
