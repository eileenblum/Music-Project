Oh my God, I'm totally shot
A runnin' joke's for the rocket girl now
The baby, baby's all I got

I can't leave it alone
I can't leave it alone
I can't leave it alone
I can't leave it alone, yeah!

She's a rocket freak
And it's the end of the world
I'm her favorite creep
And she's my only girl
Blastin' out science, chewing up he moon
Spittin' out fire, the end is comin' soon
She's a rocket freak
And it's the end of the world

She's a rocket freak
And it's the end of the world
I'm her favorite creep
And she's my only girl
Blastin' out science, chewing up he moon
Spittin' out fire, the end is comin' soon
She's a rocket freak
Give me the end of the world

She's a rocket freak
And it's the end of the world
I'm her favorite creep
And she's my only girl
Blastin' out science, chewing up he moon
Spittin' out fire, the end is comin' soon
She's a rocket freak
And it's the end of the world

Go!
