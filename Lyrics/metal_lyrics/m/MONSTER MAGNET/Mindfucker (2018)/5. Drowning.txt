This ain't a bad cup of coffee
I guess we agree on that much
And I should be counting my blessings
In the light of your fading touch
But I'm tired of the game
And I'd sure like to blame you
For turning my dreams into dust
But I'm spinning and it's all because of you

Guess I'll go back on the highway
And keep on searching for light
Some much needed coin in my pocket
And I'll prove that I'm doing alright
But I could get paid for a thousand days
And I still would be begging at night
Yeah, I'm crying and it's all because of you

Are there happy endings?
Is there a sun up in the sky?
Well it's hard to get excited
When I'm gettin' nothin' back
And I'm tired, yeah I'm tired of asking why

Jesus, you let me down again
World, oh world, I guess you ain't my friend
I could get high 'til I broke through the sky
But I still would be singin' the blues
But I'm drowning and it's all because of you
Yeah, I'm drowning and it's all because of you

Dream with me now, my darling
In my cave deep under the ground
I'm pretty good at pretending
That the sun will never go down

But I see in your eyes
That you're hip to those lies
And I just can't be hearing that sound
Oh, I'm fading and it's all because of you

How much are happy endings?
Can I buy you that moon up in the sky?
I wanna see the day
But it seems that you don't wanna play
And I'm tired, yeah I'm tired of asking why

Jesus, you let me down again
World, I guess you ain't my friend, ain't my friend
I could get laid in a thousand ways
But I still would be singin' the blues
But I'm drowning and it's all because of you

Jesus, you let me down again
World, world, world, world, you ain't nobody's friend
I could get paid for a thousand days
But I still would be wearing old shoes
I could get laid in a thousand ways
But I still would be think 'bout you
I could get high 'til I crashed through the sky
But I still would be singin' the blues
But I'm drowning and it's all because of you (Yeah)
Yeah, I'm drowning and it's all because of you
Yeah, I'm drowning and it's all because of you
