Wake up kids
You were smokin' in bed
Set the house on fire again
It's like you wanna be dead

Truth to tell
I don't dig your sound
And it could be time
To shut the whole thing down

When I made you
I also made the stars
And they turned out fine
And you keep wrecking the car

And all you slobs
Have got a lot of nerve
And the end of times
Is all you deserve

Did you it slip your mind
Just who made you?
Did you it slip your mind
Just what I can do?

I'm God
If you're looking for who to blame
I'm God
And I'm ridin' a river of flame
I'm God
And nobody gets a ride
I'm God
And you're lucky to be alive

Did it slip your mind
Just who is who?
Did it slip your mind
Just what I can do?
Did you kinda space
On who made your plan?
Well I'm here to remind you sucker
Of just who I am

Well I'm God
If you're looking for who to blame
I'm God
And I'm ridin' a river of flame
I'm God
And nobody gets a ride
I'm God
And you're lucky to be alive

I'm God
And I ain't gonna take no blame
I'm God
And I'm ridin' a river of flame
I'm God
And you know that I never lie
I'm God
And I'm thinkin' of sayin' goodbye

I tried to do some good
I gave you Hollywood
I let you put nails in my feet
I let you play around
I let you have your sound
And then you peed right in my creak
What am I supposed to do
You know I don't need you
I could have danced a different strut
But I let you track
And what do I get back
A big pile of fuckin' up
You know I hate to fail
But I need to bail
I'm not afraid to use my might
So get your red dress on
And you can party it down
I'll give you the big goodnight

'Cause I'm God
If you're looking for who to blame
I'm God
And I'm ridin' a river of flame
I'm God
And nobody gets a free ride
I'm God
And you're lucky to be alive

I'm God
And I ain't gonna take no blame
I'm God
And I'm ridin' a river of flame
I'm God
And you know that I never lie
I'm God
And I'm thinkin' of sayin' goodbye

I'm God
If you're looking for who to blame
I'm God
And I'm ridin' a river of flame
I'm God
And nobody gets a ride
I'm God
And you're lucky to be alive

I'm God
I'm God
I'm God
I'm God
