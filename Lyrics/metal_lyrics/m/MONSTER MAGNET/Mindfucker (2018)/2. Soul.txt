I got nothin' to lose, I got nowhere to go
I'm getin' rained in garbage baby
And running down a rabbit hole
Before I catch on fire
Before I lose our breath
I'm gonna move it, move it, move it baby
With the one thing I got left

I got soul, I got soul
I got soul, I got soul

Fools come and fools go
There ain't no love, you know I heard it before
Push me around, jam up my brain
It ain't gonna work 'cause I'm already insane
I got soul, I know how to fly
Hey Mr. man, you wanna sell me a lie
Well alright, well alright
Well alright, alright, alright

Hey baby, what's wrong?
Has the whole world gone to hell?
I ain't surprised that you got ripped off
'Cause you've been busy playin' with yourself
Before we catch on fire
Before we lose our breath
We gotta move it, move it, move it baby
With the one thing that we got left

We got soul, we got soul
We got soul, we got soul

Fools come and fools go
The world's on fire, you know I heard it before
False gods and fast [?]
They go down good, you know I eat 'em alive
We got soul, we know how to roll
And we'll be flyin' when they're diggin' that hole
Alright, well alright
Well alright, alright, alright

Yeah
Yeah!

We got soul, we got soul
We got soul, we got soul

Fools come and fools go
There ain't no love, you know I heard it before
Push me around, jam up my brain
It ain't gonna work 'cause I'm already insane
I got soul, I know how to fly
Hey Mr. Man, you wanna sell me a lie
Well alright, well alright
Well alright, alright, alright

Go!
