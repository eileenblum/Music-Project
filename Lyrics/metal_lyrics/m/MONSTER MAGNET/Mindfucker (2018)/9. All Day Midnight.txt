It was just about a week ago when I got the chill
A real mean buzz in my ear
Something that they'd never tell you on the news
Summer isn't coming this year

Everybody's spooked, hoping it's a lie
Everybody's crazy, I can see it in their eyes
I got running home when the day is done
Hope I'll feel better in the morning
But the morning never comes, watch out

Getting lost in this all day midnight
Gimme back my right to the sun
There's black cloud that's stealing my heart
Won't you hold my hand until the demons have run
Hey God where's my big vacation
You told me the future was bright
Is there no chance you'll make good on that sunshine
I'm getting so tired now to run out the night

Never did nothin' to no one
And now I gotta sing in the dark
Lately I've been thinking I'm branded a cook
My next door neighbors isn't that smart

Who are these creeps, they're watching me
It's getting cold, can't hardly see
I'ma outta gas, I'm feeling low
I think my mind is gonna go

Getting lost in this all day midnight
Gimme back my right to the sun
There's black cloud that's stealing my heart
Won't you hold my hand until the demons have run
Hey God where's my big vacation
You told me the future was bright
Is there no chance you'll make good on that sunshine
I'm getting so tired now to run out the night

Getting lost in this all day midnight
Gimme back my right to the sun
There's black cloud that's stealing my heart
Won't you hold my hand until the demons have run
Hey God where's my big vacation
You told me the future was bright
Is there no chance you'll make good on that sunshine
I'm getting too old now to run out the night
I'm getting too old now to run out the night
I'm getting too old now to run out the night
