I see many of you here, that can fake love
I see many of you more, that can fake tough
But the answer lies outside, that cyclone
Such a pretty, pretty face

There's a light shining on me, and I can't hide
There's an old familiar voice, and I can't hide
And I love it when I try, into cyclones
Where the spirit meets the speed, yeah
It goes on forever

Your soul can blow me away

There are many of you here, than can fake love
I see many, many more, that can fake tough
Well, the answer lies outside, that cyclone
Where the spirit meets the speed, yeah
It goes on forever

I see you drowning in the garbage
Waiting for your Dad to take you home
Lay back and kiss your imagination
You don't need a sign to be home

Your soul can blow me away
Your soul can blow me away
Your soul can blow me away
Your soul can blow me away
Your soul can blow me away
Your soul, your soul, your soul
Your soul can blow me away
Your soul, your soul, your soul
