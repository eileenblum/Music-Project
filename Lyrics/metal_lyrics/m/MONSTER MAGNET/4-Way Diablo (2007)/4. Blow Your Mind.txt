Mister, have you tickled the witness
He couldn't catch his breath in the storm
Man, you've got to love your position
You're feeding baby food to the whores
I said, "My, my, my" said the spider to the fly
"You want a little pee in your cup?"
I said, "Wait, wait, wait, there's a package at the gate
You'd be lucky if that fucker blew up"

Now did you say, that you're cool when dividends pay, yeah
If you got no soul, boy, you better stick it down that hole, yeah
Now will you ride, with an angel by your side?
Or Will you just completely Blow Your Mind?

Sell it to a new generation
You're kicking off your space and your time
You got some bones in your closet
The time is right
And that's the way your spirit dies
Your mind's for the quakin'
Your body's for the shakin'
Your soul's for the makin'
And your money's for the takin'

Now did you say, that you're cool when dividends pay, yeah
If you got no soul, boy, you better stick it down that hole, yeah
Now will you ride, with an angel by your side?
Or Will you just completely Blow Your Mind?

Gotta do it hard like a monkey
Nothing's gonna get in your way
Jesus, could you find me an egg now?
Baby's gotta something to say

I'm just a man, and I trust in my own two hands
If you got no soul, boy, you better stick it down that hole, yeah
Now will you ride, with an angel by your side?
Or Will you just completely Blow Your Mind?

Now did you say, that you're cool when dividends pay, yeah
If you got no soul, boy, you better stick it down that hole, yeah
Now will you ride, with an angel by your side?
Or Will you just completely Blow Your Mind?
