You're alive, you're alive, baby, you're so alive
You're alive, you're alive, baby, you're so alive
You're alive, you're alive, baby, you're so alive
You're alive, you're alive, baby, you're so alive

Oh, baby, when you dream at night, you won't still feel the slave
Just so you know right now, I put the candles on your birthday cake
And when you're hanging upside down I do my best to keep you hypnotised
I try to make you understand what makes the crazy circles in my eyes

You're alive, you're alive, baby, you're so alive
You're alive, you're alive, baby, you're so alive
You're alive, you're alive, baby, you're so alive
You're alive, you're alive, baby, you're so alive

Goddamn, life is good and nature is a wonderful thing
The sweet sight of you huffin' and puffin' is enough to make a birdie sing
You don't gotta understand my love, but I'll tell you if you wanna know
I got an eye for miracles baby, when I see one I wanna let go

You're alive, you're alive, baby, you're so alive
You're alive, you're alive, baby, you're so alive
You're alive, you're alive, baby, you're so alive
You're alive, you're alive, baby, you're so alive
You're alive, you're alive, baby, you're so alive
You're alive, you're alive, baby, you're so alive
You're alive, you're alive, baby, you're so alive
You're alive, you're alive, baby, you're so alive

You're alive, you're alive, baby, you're so alive
You're alive, you're alive, baby, you're so alive
You're alive, you're alive, baby, you're so alive
You're alive, you're alive, baby, you're so alive
You're alive, you're alive, baby, you're so alive
You're alive, you're alive, baby, you're so alive
You're alive, you're alive, baby, you're so alive
You're alive, you're alive, baby, you're so alive
