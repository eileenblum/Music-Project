Well I made my fire in flesh
And I keep time inside of my head
Like a stone God, I drink from the moon
But it's far away and over too soon

I can crush A Thousand Stars and drain your love
But it never ever seems to be enough
Rape my mind and use my body up
A Thousand Stars, and your love

When the sun dies, I find a new sun
When the bird flies, I call a new one
When the sea dries, I make a new sea
And I can't stop the hunger in me

I could eat A Thousand Stars and drain your love
But it never ever seems to be enough
Rape my mind and use my body up
A Thousand Stars, and your love

I'm jumping into a big black void
Just let me sleep away
I can't hurt a soul except myself
No telephones, no broken hearts
No numbers crushing time
It's the top of the world where no-one dies

Well I make my fire in flesh
And I keep time inside of my head
Like a stone God, I drink from the moon
But it's far away and over too soon

Well I can crush A Thousand Stars and drain your love
But it never ever seems to be enough
Rape my mind and use my body up
A Thousand Stars, and your love

I could eat A Thousand Stars and drain your love
But it never ever seems to be enough
Rape my mind and use my body up
A Thousand Stars, and your love
