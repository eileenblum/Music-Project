I warm my skin, you're the rising sun
Oh baby, you got that solid gold
And I know how to get things done
Come on over if ya got no place to go

Well I'm sure I could find some way
To call them doggies out to play
You really got me out of my hair
Oh yeah, gotta my thing ready for you

You really are the rising sun
You and your solid gold, yeah, oh, baby
You gotta be the only one
That can always make me grow, yeah, oh woman

Now there's very few things in life
That can ever stop me cold
And heaven just comes on down
When you take off your clothes

Well I'm sure I could find some way
To call them doggies out to play
You really drive me out of my hair
Oh yeah, gotta my thing ready for you

You really are the rising sun
You and your solid gold, now, oh baby, yeah
You gotta be the only one
That can always make me grow, oh yeah, yeah, yeah

Goddamn, you're a sight to see
Ain't never felt this before, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh honey come back to me
And bring that solid gold, hey, uh huh

Oh I love you when you are floating
No place that I'd rather be
The primal forces of nature
If you could see what I see

You really are the rising sun
You and your solid gold, baby
You gotta be the only one
That can always make me grow, yeah, yeah, yeah

Goddamn, you're a sight to see
Ain't never felt this before
Oh honey come back to me
And bring that solid gold, yeah
