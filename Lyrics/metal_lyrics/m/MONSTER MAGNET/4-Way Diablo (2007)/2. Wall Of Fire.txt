Well I'm back
I got a cock made out of platinum
I got a bullet coming out of the sky
I got the world's last piece of chocolate
I got the full moon in my eye
I gotta make that soul adoption
Baby, in the hands of fools
You gotta love that main attraction
Because I ain't getting outta the pool

Here we go
I made it just the way you like it
I'll shake your hand for free
Why don't you see when I can see you
Because I really like this game
You gotta love that sole adoption
Baby, in the hands of fools
You gotta be that main attraction
Because I ain't getting outta the pool

Baby, I kinda like you crazy
Like climbing up the Wall of Fire
I know you wouldn't hurt me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby, I like it when you're crazy
Like climbing up the Wall of Fire
I like it when you hurt me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Tell me when my ship comes in, I'm underground
The girl lies in the sun until she's golden-brown
I just got a mission that I can't turn down
Killing Nazi zombies in a German town

Well I'm back
I got a cock made out of platinum
I got a bullet coming out of the sky
I got the world's last piece of chocolate
I got the full moon in my eye
I gotta make that soul adoption
Baby, in the hands of fools
You gotta love that main attraction
Because I ain't getting outta the pool

Baby, I kinda like you crazy
Like climbing up the Wall of Fire
I know you wouldn't hurt me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby, I like it when you're crazy
Like climbing up the Wall of Fire
I like it when you hurt me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
