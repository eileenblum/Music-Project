You're never going on vacation
You're never gonna ride the wave
You'll never make it down the blunt, yeah
Now take the spirit of the age
I swim the river in your head
It's going straight to Hell

Feed that vampire
Feed that vampire

I got religion on the love boat
You rode the horsey down in Spain
Go get another bag of pom freaks
I'm busy cleaning out the stains
I put a story in your head
I hope you like the show
Act like a piggy 'til I get back
I'll do your mother on the phone

Feed that vampire
Feed that vampire
Every time I see her, you pull me back down
Feed that vampire

Jump in the reactor
And melt away
Jump in the reactor
And melt away
Jump in the reactor
And melt away
Jump in the reactor
And melt away

You're never going on vacation
You're never gonna ride the wave
You'll never make it down the blunt, honey
Now take the spirit of the age
I swim the river in through your head
It's going straight to Hell
I booked a ticket on back to Prague
I got a medicine to sell

Feed that vampire
Feed that vampire
Every time I see her, you pull me on down
Feed that vampire

Jump in the reactor
And melt away
Jump in the reactor
And melt away
Jump in the reactor
And melt away
Jump in the reactor
And melt away

Jump
In
The reactor
And
Melt
So far away

Jump
In
The reactor
And
Melt
So far away

Jump
In
The reactor
And
Melt
So far away

Jump
In
The reactor
And
Melt
So far away
