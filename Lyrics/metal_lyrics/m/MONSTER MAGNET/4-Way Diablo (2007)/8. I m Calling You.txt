I'm Calling You
I'm Calling You
Can you explain what you wanna do?
How was your day?
How was your day?
Did you think of me, because I thought of you
Well, we sure picked a crazy way
I'm living your night and you my day
The world is dead
The world is dead
What crazy shit is inside your head?
Why can't we play?
Why can't we play?
Your thoughts get dark when you're far away
And no, I won't get out of bed
If you keep hauling out your dead
I watch you frown and I watch you shake
And baby, that's all I can take

What kind of monsters have we made?
Our minds have blackened out the sun
We must remember what is real
Oh, please, let's have our love again

What kind of monsters have we made?
Our minds have blackened out the sun
We must remember what is real
Oh, please, let's have our love again

The world is dead
The world is dead
What crazy shit is inside your head?
Why can't we play?
Why can't we play?
Our thoughts get dark when you're far away
