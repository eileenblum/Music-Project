What do I want from me?
A clock that goes thirteen
A deal with the pyramids
A way to know everything
Growing a nothing tree
Water it everyday
A bitter and fast decline
You can smell it a mile away
If you've got a decent thought
Why don't you hook me up?
It's all left up to me
To hang with Lord 13

It's hardly worth a look
So why don't you let me sleep?
And everything is crap
And everyone's a creep
If you've got half a heart
Then sell me half of that
It's all left up to me
To hang with Lord 13
