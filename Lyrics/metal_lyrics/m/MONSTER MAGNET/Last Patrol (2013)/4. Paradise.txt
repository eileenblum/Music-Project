Sure is cold here and I ainât lyinâ
The stairs lead nowhere and time is dead
If I had someone just to listen Iâd tell them stories of paradise
When I was young I crossed an ocean
Crossed an ocean oh, so far away
Cosmic circus, instant passions
I found a way for me to make it pay
Well let me guess now, my little monkey
You love your salt and your cigarettes
And with your eyes shut you see Valhalla
Youâve lost some fight but you ainât done yet
Now come a little bit closer
Well ainât that nice
You and me girl, between the raindrops
Little pieces of paradise
Baby, Iâm dyinâ so letâs do some cryinâ
Letâs cherish some sins in the cave
Under the rainbow where no one will ever know
Weâll make such a beautiful place
Sure is hot here
Itâs like a jungle
Hot enough for life to grow
But itâs just too much
I canât take the hassle
There ainât no air and itâs time to go
Weâve got the scars to prove us
Well ainât that nice
All our laughinâ and all our cryinâ are little memories of paradise
