Brother, can you help me now
I feel my mind is drifting
Lost between the sacred grains of sand forever shifting
Dormammu is looming and of that you can be sure
I can sense the yawning of his dimensionâs door
So turned on
What we all knew is gone
Burn your wheels into the sun
Surrender to the mindless ones
Great Vishanti I am gone, a white haired girl is crying
All beliefs are thrown to hell, the ancient one is dying
My astral self is frozen and thereâs no way Iâm returning
I must gaze into the eye, I watch my body burning
Iâm so turned on
What we all knew is gone
Burn your wheels into the sun
Surrender to the mindless ones
