Brothers, never discount a Tuesday
Youâd better spring for a good hotel
You got to keep the talent starry eyed
if you wanna keep ringinâ those bells
It ainât no theory, itâs the law, boy
And while the dabblers keep douchinâ around
Old Eisenhowerâs got his candles lit
a couple hours aâfore he rolls into town
I roll right into town
I roll right into town
Hallelujah
If you spend too much time chewinâ bubblegum
youâre apt to spoil the old appetite
Well I just reach in the hole of my enthusiastic soul
and show âem why they call me the creep
Howâs about a little camp fire, ladies?
What say we sing a few songs?
We got music and mirth and we got peace on this earth
and Iâm certain we all can get along
We all can get along, we all can get along, we all can get along
Cynthia and Jerry has a message theyâre sayinâ
All of you squares go home
I say goddamn, Iâm the luckiest man
Come on and all sing along
Hallelujah, hallelujah
