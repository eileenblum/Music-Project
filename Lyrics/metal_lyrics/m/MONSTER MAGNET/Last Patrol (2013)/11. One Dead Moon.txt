[Bonus Track]Hey girl, don't act surprised
You knew you'd see me here
Been a long, long time for you and me
Somewhere along the way the light just left your eyes
And I'd hate to think it was because of me
I hope you're happy with that drone you found
and he's saying all the things you want him to
Girl, I know you and you need those lies
'cause the truth just takes so much of you

Just one thing before I walk away
Honey, you're one dead moon
And I don't expect that old silver light to come back soon

Your beauty, oh there's no denying it
You were the silver light of a big, bright moon
And I know that when you tried to change me
you were so damn sure it was the only thing to do
But you ain't as clever as you think you are
The fact is I miss your body more than I miss you
I can't be worried 'bout no wounded pride
'cause for just this once I gotta tell the truth

Just one thing before I walk away
Honey, you're one dead moon
And I don't expect that old silver light to come back soon
