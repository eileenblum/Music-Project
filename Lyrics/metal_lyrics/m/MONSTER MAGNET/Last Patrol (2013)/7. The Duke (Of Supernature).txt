[Verse 1:]
Come on,
Checking out the office girls on a Friday afternoon
Well sheâs got the shape I need for the mine to break too soon
Itâs all dead moons and chicken bones
And child donât you fear
Youâll be singing in a higher purpose
Now your super natureâs clear
Yeah, it all comes near

[Chorus:]
Well I swear I did you baby
Back in 49 in vain
When the devil lost the big war
But he figured out a way
Now I watch and make the world come
And in dollars due thus die
And I praise the day the duke of Supernatureâs coming back
Is coming back
Is coming back

[Verse 2:]
My old pal Icarus rode too close to the sun
And folks tend to get off sand
When they see how the job gets done
Now close your eyes, and pay no mind to the circles round your head
The answer to those questions
Is right here in my own bed
Yeah, oh
In my own bed
Hit it

[Chorus:]
Well I swear I did you baby
Back in 49 in vain
When the master lost the big one
But he figured out a way
Now I watch and make the world come
And in dollars due thus die
And I praise the day the duke of Supernatureâs coming back
Is coming back now
Yeah
