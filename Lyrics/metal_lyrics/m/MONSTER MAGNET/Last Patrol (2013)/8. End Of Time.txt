Someone tell those slobs that they got it wrong
They screwed us good and gave the whole circus away
Venus warm my bed âcause Iâm coming home, now
Iâm crashing the ship and just walking away
Somebody told me once that you were deeper than darkness
A shining face on a body that could send me to war
Naked flesh in the heart of a nuclear sunrise, baby
Drain that lizardâs tank until there ainât anymore
Throw my burned out head in a lake of fire
Iâll satisfy my soul on the other side
Pump me till Iâm gone and I canât get back
Iâll smoke you fuckers out at the end of time
I saw this girl, once... her hair was on fire
Her eyes like stars
Sheâs never left my mind
A planet bird singing her phoenix song
Electric childrenâs voices at the end of time
Somebody told me once that you were deeper than darkness
A shining face on a body that could send me to war
Naked flesh in the heart of a nuclear sunrise, baby
Drain that lizardâs tank until there ainât anymore
Throw my burned out head in a lake of fire
Iâll satisfy my soul on the other side
Pump me till Iâm gone and I canât get back
Iâll smoke you fuckers out at the end of time
Wash my tired brain in an acid bath
Fuck me till Iâm dead and I canât get back
Iâll satisfy my soul on the other side
and smoke my baby out at the end of time
