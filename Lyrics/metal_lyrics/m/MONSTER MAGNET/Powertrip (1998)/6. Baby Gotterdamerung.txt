I read a book today
It made me think of a life I led
It seemed so far away, but then I wouldn't call it dead
I see a name or two and the ghosts just start to roam
I had 'em locked away
It seems they've cut their own parole

Now face the music, son
Some people live to remember when
But you're no storage space
You've lived a dozen lives since then
So what would Modok do if his memory got too full?
He'd find a powersource and then he'd pick what plugs to pull

I looked in the mirror and somebody blew up
I turned on my TV and somebody blew up
I learned how to lie well and somebody blew up
I learned how to live true and somebody blew up

My brain was still today
Just taking a little death
Just like the doctors say:
I never get that kind of rest
The movie's on again
They got me nullifying ghosts
I'm better dead than red
I guess I'll never get off the boat

I looked in the mirror and somebody blew up
I turned on my tv and somebody blew up
I learned how to lie well and somebody blew up
I learned how to live true and somebody blew up
