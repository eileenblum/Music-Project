Bought another copy of fragile
Seeds were bustin' up the spine
I think I cracked my skull doin' airplanes
Not too many but it's just fine
Pussy scratching sniff in a playboy
Christ I'm a good looking man

Fifteen miles to cop on a stingrays
Boys will gonna ride tonight
Goofballs in the 70's nipples
Gotta get our heads just right
Sit me on the lap of the Gods, babe
Cover me with skin and hair

Bought another copy of Zoso
Seeds were bustin' up the spine
I think I wet my pants doin' whippets
Not too many but it's just fine
Sit me on the lap of the Gods, babe
Cover me with skin and hair
Ride a number one on the home train
Screw you if you think I can't

Smoke
