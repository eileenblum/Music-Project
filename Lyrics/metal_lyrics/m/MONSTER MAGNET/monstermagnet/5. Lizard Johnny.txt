Screaming out in the street
Witness the birth of a freak
Stinking malformed geek
Don't waste the drool Johnny

Shiny aluminum mind
But his dirty stick works just fine
Scrawny unwashed behind
She likes you, Johnny

Love me, show animal reign
Kiss me, weave my fucking brain
Wild baby, shoot for the back of the freak as his head explodes

Laughing, spittin' boy
Becomes a laughin', spittin' man
Drooling mutant glands
You're twitchin', Johnny

Shiny aluminum mind
But his dirty stick works just fine
Scrawny unwashed behind
She hates you, Johnny

Love me, show animal reign
Kiss me, weave my fucking brain
Wild baby, shoot for the back of the freak as his head explodes

Lizard Johnny
Lizard Johnny
Lizard Johnny
Lizard Johnny
Lizard Johnny
Lizard Johnny
Lizard Johnny
Lizard Johnny
Ow, Lizard Johnny
Lizard Johnny
Lizard Johnny

Owwwwww
