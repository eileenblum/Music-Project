Well my buddy Jo gave me a laughing pill
Well it tasted like shit and it gave me the chills
I saw his girlfriend's face in a bucket of water
He said a buck for the snatch and a nipple's a quarter

Well I'm telling you freaks, I've eyes in the back of my head
And I can hear you laughing at me when I'm lying in bed
You better be righteous when you're cutting me up
Cause you'll be doing it wrong and I'll be fucking you up

I got a nail in my head and I know that I'm gone
When I'm driving the tractor on the drug farm
Got a knife in my back got a hole in my arm
When I'm driving the tractor on the drug farm
Got a nail in my head and I know that I'm gone
When I'm driving the tractor on the drug farm
Got a knife in my back got a hole in my arm
I'm driving the tractor on the drug farm...get down

I got a nail in my head and I know that I'm gone
When I'm driving the tractor on the drug farm
Got a knife in my back got a hole in my arm
When I'm driving the tractor on the drug farm
Got a nail in my head and I know that I'm gone
When I'm driving the tractor on the drug farm
Got a knife in my back got a hole in my arm
I'm driving the tractor on the drug farm...all right
