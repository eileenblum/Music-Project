[Part one]

Travelling through time, strainght into your eyes
I havearrived in this place
I have discovered the wind in my soul
So I could learn to be brave
I have opened my wings to the wind
Crossing the day and the night
This journey of endless tale
Never to end, the centuries will go on

My God! This future falls into the seams
I feel the ice grip and destroy my dreams
Do you trust love? The heat of hate?
The terror of life, be exorcised
Tomorrow will shine beyond our fears

My God! Iron hearts are destroyed
Empty, your blood in truth of poetry
Do you trust love? YouÂ´re made of steel

Life without taste
Distracted by hate and the infinite colours stay
Lost in the sea of pain

[Part two]

Now, I see only mist beyond time
Now, weÂ´ll drift to the hell of destiny
Now, You will see how the blood will start boiling
You will die!
You will live and will see how yours sons will adore you
Now, you pretend in the end you will pray
Now, you will burn!

Like a woman buried afraid
Under the earth, drown in your blood
But youÂ´ll discover, you once had your glory

Demon you cannot hide
We will miss you... Die!
Am I consumed?
Feeling the breath of death
That spits venom in my eyes

Shine life in my life
I can still change
To start again maybe
I will not die forever
Will I be saved? Just give me hope

Shine life in my life
I can still change
(I thank you eternally!) Messenger!
