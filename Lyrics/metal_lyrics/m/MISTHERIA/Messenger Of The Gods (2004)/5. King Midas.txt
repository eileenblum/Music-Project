Am I alive or not? Do I still breathe? I canÂ´t remember
My strength abandoned me, now IÂ´m so frail, so weak and helpless
And no more peace to me, no!
ItÂ´s time to go away from here
I open my hands, you see, They give me life, They grant me power
A piercing light from my eyes which blinds my dreams
My dreams forever
Now, alone, IÂ´m still waiting your return

Water and flames in me, my fingers cling to thee
All colours seem the same in my heart, IÂ´m the king!
A yellow river flows, a river in my veins
ItÂ´s one with my own blood and it takes my life away from me

IÂ´m singing with no voice
IÂ´m crying with no pain
IÂ´m reigning with no crown
Just hate and disdain

I canÂ´t hide in the storm
I canÂ´t hide anymore
I drown and then reborn
Noises, pain and fear, I wonder what I became
What am I?

Let me graze you, let me caress you
I could still love you despite your betrayal... betrayal

Water and flames in me, my fingers cling to thee
All colours seem the same in my heart, IÂ´m the king!
A yellow river flows, a river in my veins
ItÂ´s one with my own blood and it takes my life away from me
