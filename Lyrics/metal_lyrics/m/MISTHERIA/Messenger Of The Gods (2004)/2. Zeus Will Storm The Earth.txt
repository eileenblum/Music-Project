The lord of the sky, All power and might, The ruler of the Gods
Legends and myths tell of the tales of revenge and trickery
But fate rules the game of insatiable lust, notorius wandering eye
A victim of schemes, from this throne he will rise to punish those who live

His revenge is hunting him

Drawing the lot, his brothers concede, fulfill the destiny
The other Gods taste the revolution and strife
But Zeus still holds the key wielding his weapon
The thunderbolt strikes at those who will displease
Hang from the sky, the golden chains hold while falling to their knees

His revenge is hunting him

Zeus the mighty king is coming
Bringing all his retribution
CanÂ´t you see the storm is rising?
Zeus the mighty king is coming

Zeus the mighty king is coming
Bringing all his retribution
CanÂ´t you see the storm is rising? (Zeus the mighty king)
Zeus the mighty king is coming (Here he comes... Yeah!)

Zeus will come and storm the earth, displaying all his power
The thunder of his vengeance and his lighting will devour
The titans and humanity will feel the wrath to come
Dispensing pain and penalties to those that he will judge
Zeus will storm the earth!!
Zeus will storm the earth!!

Zeus the mighty king is coming
Bringing all his retribution
CanÂ´t you see the storm is rising? (Zeus the mighty king)
Zeus the mighty king is coming (Here he comes)
CanÂ´t you hear the battle calling? (Hear the battle calling)
Zeus the mighty king is coming (Here he comes)
Zeus will storm the earth!!
