Sometimes I feel in the air
A haunting sensation inside
Curiosity grows day by day
Like a river that runs through my mind
Shinning inside each of us
The light weaves like a golden thread
It binds us to our seasons of joy
And carries us through the valley of death
The landscape of time we have built
From the scenes of our childhood
Then one special, moment in life
Suddenly changed our souls
Black clouds reuniting will soon disappear
A rainbow winged creature
Blessed with an agelic face
Forged by the tears of smile
Her name is hope
Hope comes to comfort our lost bleeding hearts

Like a star that rests in the day
And blinds all in the night
Bright and powerfull gift from above
So we believe in hope, in hope of childresnÂ´s heaven
ChildrenÂ´s heaven lives in our dreams
Never to return
ChildrenÂ´s heaven vanished forever
Never coming back
WeÂ´ll try to make th goodness triumph
Drowning evil down in hell
Like a star that rests in the day
And blinds all in the night
Bright and powerfull gift from above
So we believe in hope, in hope of childresnÂ´s heaven
