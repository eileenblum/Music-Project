She didnÂ´t hide or pretend it
I was the man she would have love like a perfect wife
She didnÂ´t want to renounce it
I was the man she was searching for all of her life

I donÂ´t respond to her
I left her all alone
She wander me at any cost

She wanted proof my love for her
Kill a monster to prove my valor
Will I survive?
My refusal was an insult for that married queen in love

I donÂ´t want just a love affair
She told her husband a lie to get her own revenge
The furious king could not kill me
He sent me to the father of his faithfull wife
With a trick for trapping me

She wanted proof my love for her
Kill a monster to prove my valor
Will I survive?
My refusal was an insult for that married queen in love

Come here, near me, Pegasus proud winged horse
Hear me, trust me, my steed carry me up in the air
Let me see what I canÂ´t see
Grant me now the sight of height

I will face the creature without fear
Where all failed I will succeed!

She wanted proof my love for her
Kill a monster to prove my valor
Will I survive?
My refusal was an insult for that married queen in love
