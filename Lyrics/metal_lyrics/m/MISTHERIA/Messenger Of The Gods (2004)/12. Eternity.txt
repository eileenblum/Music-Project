In my dreams I still remember
I have seen two sacred trees closely grown of good old age
Years of harmony, their crows survived
And weÂ´re still so young, you donÂ´t have to feel alone
Follow me when IÂ´m drifting on the clouds

Learn to fly with me tonight
Above the rays of golden light, my love
You know our friendship turn into endless love
And when youÂ´re gone
Desire feeds my destiny
Venus led you through the maze
And these is something you should know

You the tide in my waves
The flame in my thoughts
My heart melts again
Gift of my life
Hope of my days
I donÂ´t understand
Wh I was blind
You were out of reach
Hole in my heart
IÂ´m missing you when youÂ´re not around, my love

Tide in my waves
Light in my soul
You rule my world
Beyond time and space
Tide in my waves
Island of hope
Flow in my veins
ItÂ´s growing like this tree

Tide in my waves
Flame in my thoughts
Light in my soul
My sorrow breaks
Tide in my waves
Beyond all the pain
Gift of my life
You mean my world
Tide in my waves
Flame in my thoughts
My heart melts again
I drift away
When eternity begins, Eternity begins

A kiss from the shore
Eternity wonÂ´t end
My heart melts again
Eternity begins,
Eternal love, romantic tales
Eternity begins, Island of hope
Gift of my life, Eternity...
