The shining flower will be gone forever
Ivory curse of rage and blood shall fall
A senseless quest will take us
Where light and dark collide

I hear the voices from the temple of tears
The gates of silent land are opened wide
The holy fire shows me
The path to nevermore

Once fate has rolled the dice
Remind the words the father said
No answers from the Gods
Illusions spread their shadows on my way

Death awaiting in hear weary eyes
Cold flames of stone will take her sight

I walk across the nightmares of deceit
Insanity controls my thoughts
Is it the end or am I doomed to live on?
Am I the master or a slave of pain?

Stormy weather gathers all around
Winds of revenge carry me higher
Blood calls the misery of my lost soul
This tragedy that still goes on
In agony the old fear grows
Why canÂ´t you see, why canÂ´t you hear
I canÂ´t believe
Blood called my name
In the dark
I will face
The dragonÂ´s teeth, dragonÂ´s teeth

The shining flower will be gone forever
The curse of rage and blood is done
My mind is blinded but the fightÂ´s not over
Beyond the smoke the visionÂ´s clear

Hope is hidden in a ray of light
Voice of the wise, show me a sign
"Fallen the beast,
From evil seed will rise a new life"

Blood calls the misery of my lost soul
This tragedy that still goes on
In agony the old fear grows
Why canÂ´t you see, why canÂ´t you hear
I canÂ´t believe
Blood called my name
In the dark
I will face
