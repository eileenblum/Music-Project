Black is the colour of death and pain
The ship will soon sail away
Ritual of youth to be sacrified
To feast the carnivore wraith
Across the sea, the furious sea
Longing to reach the dark isleÂ´s shores
Across the sea, the journey is long
White flag will see my return

My search now begins
Brave an mighty I will face it
When your secrets are known
Horror turns into strengh
Tomorrow will see
IÂ´m rising against you
Me!

Facing my anguish, my inner fear
My heart will turn into steel
IÂ´ll find my way through one million walls
The way unto my enemy
I can sea beyond the sea
The island where I am supposed to die
I foresee my victory
HellÂ´s spawn, your bell will soon tool!

My search now begins
Brave an mighty I will face it
When your secrets are known
Horror turns into strengh
Tomorrow will see
IÂ´m rising against you
Me!

With no direction
No path to follow
My destiny will show the way
Face me the intruder
And sword is useless
I will kill you as you used to do
Feel your blade, taste the pain
I never die... Demon!

My mission is now complete
Now that the torment is over
There is no creature to feed
ItÂ´s gone forever and ever

Now I saved with my deed
No more sacrificial victims
I want to meet
Who cried for me
Glorious, I make my return

My mission is now complete
Now that the torment is over
I want to meet
Who cried for me
Glorious, I make my return
