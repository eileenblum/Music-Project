See the rulers of the earth
The golden age, a new rebirth
The lords of war are changing destiny
Signs are falling into place
Poetic charms reveal the taste
Dominion is the highest conquest here
Fallen angels cry, whispers in the night
Spilling blood upon the ground, You here them dying
Defenders of the light, the wicked will not die
I feel the darkness coming, casting shadows in the sky

Behind the veil of time, legends will unwind
Fate and estiny align

I see the titans, rulling the earth
Destined for glory, from the day of their birth
Titans!!

Justice is alive, A struggle to survive
But mysteries will never die, itÂ´s beyond our vision
Falling by the side, seduction rules the night
Prestige and honor calling, The endless battle rages on

Behind the veil of time, legends will unwind
Fate and estiny align

I see the titans, rulling the earth
Destined for glory, from the day of their birth
I see the titans, roaming the earth
Power and glory, dominating the world
Titans!!
