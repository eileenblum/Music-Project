I am the voice of your seducer if you believe in God
I am the face from your worst nightmare, or maybe I am not!
Crucifix hangs on the wall and Jesus falling down
Priest are screaming on the knees
The serpents time becomes

Knocking on the heavens door the perdition is all around
Maybe the God has no time to listen to you now

The tree is empty and paradise lost, what will you do NOW
Also serpent has disappeared and you donât understand HOW
All the learing from religion that all now burns in church
Everything about Gods kingdom now is buried in dirt
