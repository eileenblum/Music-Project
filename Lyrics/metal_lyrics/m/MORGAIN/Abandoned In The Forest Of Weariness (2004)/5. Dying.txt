Heavy clouds on the sky
For the earth left
The last goodbye
Damnation of mankind
The same mistake
For thousand times

I am screaming
To the night
I am flying
To the sky
I am bleeding
For my wounds
I am dying
On the earth

So blue is the sky
No one left
For whom the sun shines
Lifeless way
Through the space
Death is all what now remains
