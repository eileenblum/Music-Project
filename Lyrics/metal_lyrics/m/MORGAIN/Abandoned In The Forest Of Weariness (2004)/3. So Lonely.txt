Listening to the warning, warning of the past
Nobody is talking, thereâs left to trust
The sore point of living, somewhere lurks the truth
Embraced by the screaming, of damned youth

And I still donât know why
Why do you cry? So lonely

Poor root of religion, dismembered by time
The spirit has own reasons, to enter the calm
Sooth locus of rapture, where no life dwells
Dawn of the madness, the earth is part of hell
