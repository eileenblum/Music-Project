The world is dying
And mankind is bleeding
From the deep space
The Nibiru arrive
People are hunted
For their own meanings
For such a long time
The gobernment still lie

World is buried
I donât cry
All my warnings
Are drowning in lies

Selective feelings
4 alternative healing
Who protect the secret
When Nibiru arrives?
The bells start ringing
And life is leaving
Chance for the humans
Maybe the next time
