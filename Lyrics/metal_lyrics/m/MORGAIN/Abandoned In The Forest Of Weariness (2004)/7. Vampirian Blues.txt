Silver moon on the winter sky
Wolfs howling is greeting the night
Loneliness and the endless time
Are the only friends in restless life
In a last time the saltly taste of blood
This memory diappeared in the past
Hundred years under famous names
Fame is gone just solitude stays

Hearing screams of all dead victims
Pictures come back to you
Hearing screams of all dead victims
Hunger is back to you

Now is the time for VAMPIRIAN BLUES
Abandoned castle hidden in the hills
Thick forest and strange whisperings
Nameless one arrived with the wind
Our world is really made for him
