Drops of rain are washing my face
I am trying to look around
Surrounding world is so silent just whisperings fall from the sky

Walking on the road that no one knows trying to reach the end
Dirt under feet the legs start to bleed from wounds come the heart

Following the shadow, I slowly closed the day
I sowed my face
Iâm still the same
Following the shadow, from life what remains?
Here comes the day
Iâm still insane

I want to move but my body refuses knees hit the ground
Dark in my sight has changed the light what happened with my mind

Lying on the road that no one knows and thinking about the end
The noise in my head so sticky and wet is the blood on my hands
