I'm feeling so tired
And never-ending seem to be this way
Someone stole the fire
The only light in this painful way

This is the sound of misery
Sometimes the life looks so scary

Looking for desire during the whole life time
The world turned to fire
Please open your eyes
The time slowly whispers my unspoken words
The heartâs still beating and reality hurts

The old wound still bleeding
And my mind still suffocates the pain
I cannot stop my feelings
Expendable is the last word to say

This is the sound of misery
Sometimes the life looks so scary
