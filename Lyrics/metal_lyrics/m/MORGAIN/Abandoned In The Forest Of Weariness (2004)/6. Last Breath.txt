Sorrounded by the hills and the forest is so deep
No light comes through the trees with darkness comes the breeze
Thick fog in the land is summoning the end
Death will appear soon accompanied with Doom

Shadows rushed by wind, the Fairy softly sings
The melody is well known itâs the call of beyond
Despair is in the air and the blaze from nowhere
Last message of light in kingdom of the night

Last breath of dying world for escape no time
Everything is forgotten under sand of time

Morning born from tears the silence is still here
The sun denies to come madness is all around
When rain begins to fall from the forest come the cold
To clean all what left sometimes itâs the best
