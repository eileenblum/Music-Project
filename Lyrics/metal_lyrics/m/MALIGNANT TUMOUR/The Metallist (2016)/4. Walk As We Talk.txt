Feel the vibe of drums, Bass that go down your spine 
Listen up, listen up, Sound that shake your guts 
â¦and we see us, grind, grind, grind 
You see us, die, die, die 

From the hell comes smoke, We drive our own inferno 
Mine incubated punks, Many times fucked up and drunk 
And we still walk bright, bright, bright 
And you say die, die, die 

And today our time is comming 
We see the place where we go 
We talk about what weÂ´re doing 
Our path is just rockÂ´nÂ´roll 
We walk on sharped edge razor 
Fuelled by the drugs and the booze 
We try to walk as we talk it 
Have really nothing to loose 

Now we rode your horse, Open road no bend 
You know itÂ´s soo good, So try to understand 
And please listen me up, Music we never gave up 
But you still go, die, die, die 
And we are fine, fine, fine 

Listen up what I say, We walk as we talk 

And today our time is comming 
We see the place where we go 
We talk about what weÂ´re doing 
Our path is just rockÂ´nÂ´roll 
Attractive new bands just envy 
They donÂ´t know place where they go 
ItÂ´s about time to let pay them 
To language of rockÂ´nÂ´roll
