I see the thousands of barrels of cool and greatest beer
Our fans they know how to drink without fear
"Normals" are locked up or goes underground
Rock 'n roll crusties, Malignant's in a town
We don't have any money
We don't have any choice
But know is party starting Rock 'n roll hellish boys..........c'mon
We are on highest fucking fire right now
We paint the town red, no fucking brown
Rock 'n roll united forces is what shake the town
And we goes to another place for just having fun
