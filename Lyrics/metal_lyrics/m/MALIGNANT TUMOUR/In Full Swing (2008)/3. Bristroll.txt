Here is a town on map just dotI once came there and I was shockedIt was first night and MotÃ¶rhead playedThe second one still not sober yetIf Devil is looking for a placeWhere to take his kingdomI would like mention one stopThe Bristolian JunctionNot an angel city, it's devil holePolish or English, all playing their rolesCider and white linesIt's what you can seeBritsol in UK is great place to be
