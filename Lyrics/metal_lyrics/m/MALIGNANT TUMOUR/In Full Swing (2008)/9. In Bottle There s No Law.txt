Driving in our hate-tankA million miles through HellSmoke and burning rubberExcruciating smellStinking up your townDrinking all your beerStealing all your womenIn bottle there's no fearStinking up your townDrinking all TurboStealing all your womenIn bottle there's no lawWe dress in filthy jacketsWith metal spikes and chainsOur Bourgondic habitsAre fucking up our brains
