We are coming to the gig like thousand times beforeWe are carrying our whole gear and free beers we pray forWomens in the backstage, we laughing, sex in airHeavy metal rockstars, that's why we are thereWe are the metal - we are the bullet to your headWe are the metal - melting the strings to the endWe are the metal - truly the rock 'n roll starsWe are the metal - until the day we will dieWe are coming to your town we bring the rockhouse downCrazy gig is finished, ruins are all aroundWe drink you under the table, nothing but piece of cakeReceiving all the dollars it's time to go away
