I know the woman she is always dressed to kill
She is so sexy and she is trying my will
Her leather clothes, it's what making my day
She knows her weapons, it's nothing more I can say

When boys seing her they're licking her shoes
and she rulling their will
Other womans are pissed and shocked
because she is dressed to kill
Dressed to kill

When night is comming she turns into the beast
She catching mens and womans, celebrate her feast
If she is looking at me, she drive me wild
So I end with her in bed with beautiful smile
