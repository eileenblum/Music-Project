We are the monstersand we like our jobDoing just nightshiftsYou can not that stopWe have got this smilekill you by G-sawThan drink you bloodWe're here to rollWelcome in a venue where zombies marchWelcome to hell yardto electric churchAll boys and girls therein leather jacketsand what is happeningis drink, drugs and sexGod was never thereeven we called himHe said he's too scaredplace of deadly sinWe drive you wildand you are oursWe make you slaveof rock'n'roll stars
