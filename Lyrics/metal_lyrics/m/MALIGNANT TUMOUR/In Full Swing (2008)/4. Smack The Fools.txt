Here we are, same as we were
Maybe less hair but who does care?
15 years ago you said we're shit
We are still here and you're down in dirt
Money hungry brains
Management rules
Don't you understand
Music business fools
You want to be on the top at any price
Big deals and money, it sound so nice
I never thought you are that blind
No one shed a tear when you lose and die
Money hungry brains
Management rules
Don't you understand
Music business fools
Money hungry brains
We gonna fuck
And to big managers
We give them a big smack
