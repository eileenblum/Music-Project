We stay on the stage, success far awayPeople are shouting, c'mon and playSo we look at ourselves then we goKicking the ass by our show"Golden bands" in the backstage they lost their strong breathBig managers stay with open mouths and sweatBoth of them have a fear because they have to knowWe eat them for breakfast and steal their fucking "gold"We are IN FULL SWING baby...We see you down there dancing in the pitYou seem you like it here is another hitWe play just game and you have to joinAt our show you spend your last coinWe see the audience going today fucking wildWe see the womens, there is something in their eyesWe see the managers give to us record dealsBut we should fuck them because we're now in full swing
