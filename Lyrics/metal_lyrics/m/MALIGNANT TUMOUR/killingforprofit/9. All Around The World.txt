"SKATE", is kind of anarchy, they said
NO, can't be true !
Following the latest trends
In both music even clothing.

They said it's a lifestyle
NO, can't be true !
Fucking uniformity
and ignorance of all around.

So buy your clothes in skateshop
Buy the most expensive skateboard
You should to smoke a weed yet
to become another empty head.
