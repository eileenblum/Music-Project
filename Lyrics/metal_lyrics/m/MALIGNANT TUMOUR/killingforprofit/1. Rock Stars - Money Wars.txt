Big managers have found the next musical stars
But the band's guys don't even know to handle their instruments perhaps
A medium to earn a lot of bucks
Just think about what you're listening to
Never make any compromise.
You know, money overruled a music
and you buy their stuff.
Or you would like to get the same "big" as they are ?
No identity, no privacy...but famous ?!?!?!
