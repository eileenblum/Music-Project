Flashing lights and total madness, everywhere is stage fogRipping stings, breaking sticks and voice like barking dogBooze and sex, smoke and dope, total rock'n rolland we see sir Kilmister, moshing in first row We comes out of hellish flameswhat we do, we penetrateall the virgins at this placewill fall in exctasy.Total succes, hand in handRoad is for us promise landAnd those who can not understandwe show our vanity Living fast, never die, we keep the banner highEngine on, beating storm, never ask me whyScars and torn, beers and whore total livers blastWorld is shit but we will hit by fucking Motorcrust
