See her on the bar deskPreety and aloneHave a drink on me babyand swich off our phone Speed romancy, sex in nightalmost touching paradiseHer body drive me wildAnd that's the way I like Cigarette and shot of whiskyis what she left behindOn card written "see you again"That's what make my wicked smile.
