Tunderstorm of the decibelsWhirlwind of the snareDetonating tones of fireNo escape from sound out there We like a decibels, that's for sureFrom lights and smoke we are killing youTones of fire nailed you to the groundDecibel maniacs, we come to your town Mountains of the Marshall boxesNo way to play fucking unpluggedEarthshake by earblasting volumeDeaf by millions of watts
