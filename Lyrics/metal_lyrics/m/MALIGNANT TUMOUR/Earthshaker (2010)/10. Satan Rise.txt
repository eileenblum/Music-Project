The new born baby on the day of the beast, hell is open it's gatesYoung kid with mad eyes, powerfull look, his touch is like feeling bladeTeenager satan, his first metal gig, discovering his lifeGrabing the guitar and making first riffs, world prepare for satan rise - oh! Satan rise Playing on big stage with his three devil friends, hear the thunderstormStorm of the rock'n'roll gets all womans here, satan get's his formEven you are lost when you're hearing this, let the beat insideYour body can take only too much, when you feel that satan rise - oh! Satan rise More rock'n'roll music and heaven will burn!!! Gods try escape, now it's devil turnNight over the world and who is to blameSATAN, I'AM!!!
