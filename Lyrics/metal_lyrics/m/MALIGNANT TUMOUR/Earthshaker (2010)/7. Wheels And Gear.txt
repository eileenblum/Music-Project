Asphalt is movin' under my ass
I got my guitar my, my battleaxe
Going to places where the sun never shines
Always on the move, following the white line

I live my life between wheels and gear
Never going home, so don't shed a tear

First gear, jet speed, second gear
My mouth is dry, I need another beer
third gear, oil feed, fourth gear
Where is the fucking place, are we near?
