I am back here with my ancient one's You missed them for last twenty yearsI am gonna sell you the same old shitWhat makes your pocket fucking free I've missed the scene and all my fansThat's what I am talking to the pressAfter a little war for nonsenseI am accepted with my new - old dress Overcowded by all my agentsWho makes a money for my needsI wouldn't let myself be stopped'cause I know you're pay for to see me I am letting out my record companyDoing this fucking filthy attackI need you to pray for my succes'cause I am here to comeback Superhuman Comeback - Ministry of foolsSuperhuman Comeback - Music bussines tools let the music do the talking, alright? Receive again my superbandNo longer in the underground'cause we did nothing for the agesNow we have fame and certain fun One day you'll be kick out againAnd it isn't that far awayYour band will haven't name in pressYou'll have tomb without the name
