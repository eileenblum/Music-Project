Hordes of metalheads, this is their dayThey sounds like artillery when they crossing the waySubculre of aliens waving flags of hateGo to the gig where metal bands play Metal Artillery - Get out of their wayMetal Artillery - For them metal bands playMetal Artillery - We are the one's of youMetal Artillery - We salute you!!! They pay at the entrance, then buy some bands merchHaving few drinks and waiting for some trashDrums like a cannons and guitar like hellHeadbangers raising their fists in the air
