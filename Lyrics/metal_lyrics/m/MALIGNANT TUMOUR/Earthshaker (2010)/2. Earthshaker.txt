Mine, mine, mine, worker number oneDusty black eyes hard muscles lineSo piece by piece cut away the groundEarth is shaking under the jackhammer soundNothing to feel, nothing to seeSlave of the darkness he used to beHammering coal and breathing gasHe come from gutter and destroy us Earthshaker - has iron fistsEarthshaker - gives you shakebite kissEarthshaker - controls the underground Sound, sound, sound, heavy rocking blastDemin and leather with rusty spikesHear the drum, shake the groundEarth is shaking under the metal soundEverything well, everything rightCharge battery, max. overdrivePlay rock'n'roll all night longYou are the one who shake the ground Earthshaker- blow up the fuseEarthshaker- distorted old school museEarthshaker- crank the amp on tenEarthshaker- world collide with you, "the MAN"
