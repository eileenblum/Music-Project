I am the outcastoutsider from day oneIn the eyes of grow upskid who scared the town Your music is like crapeveryone told meand I melted my strings downand don't give a shit, what they say Living my music life eternaly aloneonly with rock'n'roll in heartEven if I am alone, there's no fucking sorrowplaying on the guitar, 10 points in the darts I built the bandwith thousands of line-upsBut I never gave it upthat's why I am still here I am still here and where are those with the "crap"I bet they live like grow upsFuck everything up
