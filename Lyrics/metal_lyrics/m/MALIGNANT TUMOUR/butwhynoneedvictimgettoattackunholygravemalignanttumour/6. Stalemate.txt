[performed by Malignant Tumour]
[originally by Napalm Death]On the path to individual freedom
I'm met with countless obstructions
An external vacuum distorts my observance
Sucking me into the rat race

A weakness makes me gullible
Constantly lured into their traps
Dismantling my motivation
Taking my destination to another step back
