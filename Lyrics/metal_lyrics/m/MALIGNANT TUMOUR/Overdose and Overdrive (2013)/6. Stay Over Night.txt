Once in night I saw angel
In girlÂ´s body, look so fine
Asking her hopeless question
â¦please stay over night 

Started to buy to her some drinks
Hope to she will be complient
Than we dance and we kissing
Oh she will be mine, stay over night

How this old punk get this nice chick
ThatÂ´s what I hear all around

Oh she knows how to drive me
RockÂ´nÂ´roll all the night
Outside bar sunshine comming
Please give me more night..

Day is here I am wasted
Girl away, nothing fine
Realised it was drunk dream
Screamâ¦stay over night, stay over night

Rockers always having nice chicks
Because itÂ´s only one night stand

See you again, thatÂ´s I am saying
Then dissapear for long term, yes!

Ohh, please stay baby tonight!!!
