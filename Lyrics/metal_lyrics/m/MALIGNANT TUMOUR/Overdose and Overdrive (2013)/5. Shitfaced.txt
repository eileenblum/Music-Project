Drunken as hell, head is empty shell
Distilled, fermented, I'm not feeling so well
Conserved in the booze, there's no right to choose
Spiritual conversion, an alcoholic fuse

Morning... Shitfaced
All day... Shitfaced
Evening... Shitfaced
All night... Shitfaced... 

Lacking all my grace, memory erased
When sober, then over, tottering to find my trace
Ticking like a geiger, time to park a tiger
Stomach plays reverse, I'd better to drink cider

Morning... Shitfaced
All day... Shitfaced
Evening... Shitfaced
All night... Shitfaced... And laced...

Life found in bottle, living at full throttle
Everything I wish is rock 'n' roll in total
Day's over, that's end, enough bucks I spent
But life is just the bottle, believe me my friend!
