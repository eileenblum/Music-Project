Feeling like in trench, sleepy but I am fine
Ready to turn a page, waiting for T-time

Stagestorm comes to rinse your ears
Stagestorm leave you shocked and cheers
Stagestorm you can never blame
Stagestorm daily is a game

Drumkit artillery thundering in rear
Monitors are frontline, our storm is near

Stagestorm comes to rinse your ears
Stagestorm leave you shocked and cheers
Stagestorm you can never blame
Stagestorm daily is a game

Soundwaves are razors, high explosive shell

Stagestorm comes to rinse your ears
Stagestorm leave you shocked and cheers
Stagestorm you can never blame
Stagestorm daily is a game

Stagestorm comes to rinse your ears
Stagestorm leave you shocked and cheers
Stagestorm like a bombardments
Stagestorm for our mighty fans

Stage to ruins!
