Let's go!

We're heavyset men and really really nice
Cigs, beers and junkfood, a pretty good price
Razing all the places, rumbling as the storm
Decibels are the fuel to pulverize your swarm

Path of romantism, a sick bumpy road
Bulldozing pink debris in roadkill mode
RockÂ´nÂ´roll music, for black, yellow, white
Trying to entertain you, we are fucking proud
We play it loud...

We are the villains of the rock and we rule
Hangovers and blackouts, facebook status âCoolâ
Bulldozer drumcorps, powered with thick strings
WeÂ´re rolling here to cut off your crippled wings

Path of romantism, a sick bumpy road
Bulldozing pink debris in roadkill mode
RockÂ´nÂ´roll music, for black, yellow, white
Trying to entertain you, we are fucking proud
We play it loud...

Iron tracks imprints in your brain will mend
Headbang together, follow me, my friend
Headbang together, follow me, my friend
I command... I command...
