Driving in our rusty van
Engine has weird tone
Drinking all night and a day
Show should be postponed
Breath is bad, seeing red
Fans waiting in first row
We are fucking overdrive
And fucking overdose

Your energy, my cocaine
ThereÂ´s nothing IÂ´ve to explain

Overdriven, Overdosed
If offended, keep eyes closed

Supersonic speed of life
Our mission is to survive

Overdose and overdrive
ItÂ´s our way, donÂ´t ask me why
Overdose and overdrive
To the moshpit you better dive

Your energy, my cocaine
ThereÂ´s nothing IÂ´ve to explain

Overdriven, Overdosed
If offended, keep eyes closed

We donÂ´t care we are too stoned
Eroded, but still well-toned

Overdose and overdrive
ItÂ´s our way, donÂ´t ask me why
Overdose and overdrive
To the moshpit you better dive
