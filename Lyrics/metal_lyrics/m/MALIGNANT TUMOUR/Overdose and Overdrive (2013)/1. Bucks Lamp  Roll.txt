One day, in the morning
When I've tried to wake up
My incessant yawning's told me 
That something went bad

I took a guitar
Pass, raise or call
So I play a guitar
For bucks and rock 'n' roll

So I stand on the stage
Acting like clown
And giving away the smiles and groans
Giving away the fun

I'll take a guitar
Pass, raise or call...
Again I'll play a guitar
For bucks and rock 'n' roll...

My nasty plan was perfect
The legalized style
Booze, chicks and respect
Sweep bucks into piles!

Old I'll take a guitar
Pass, raise or call...
Dead I'll play a guitar
For bucks and rock 'n' roll...
