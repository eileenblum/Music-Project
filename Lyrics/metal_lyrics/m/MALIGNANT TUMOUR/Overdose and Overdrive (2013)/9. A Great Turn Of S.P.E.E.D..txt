A turbulence in my mind, a turmoil in my head
If you are fucking ready, keep your long legs spread
Faster than the wind, thatÂ´s blowing in the sky
LetÂ´s enjoy this death ride, it makes me getting high

But weâ¦we do it on the roadâ¦the booze and sex and shit
All we want is great turn of speed

Living in the movement, a great turn of speed
If you are ready for, the booze, sex and weed
Sniffing, drinking, smoking and all around again
Who cares of tomorrow, it keeps me daily sane

But weâ¦we do it on the roadâ¦the booze and sex and shit
All we want is great turn of speed

Heavily saddling the tones of rockÂ´nÂ´roll
The ultimate part of life
So donÂ´t stare at me like stupid sod
Because speed is my drug
Riding wild the tones of rockÂ´nÂ´roll
I want to live my life once more
DonÂ´t stare at me like stupid fags
Music and speed are my drugs
