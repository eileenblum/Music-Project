Age is some strange thing
Thinking about is really odd
But who has the same drink
Can feel the same as God

Early in the morning
Especially if you are drunk
Some days youâve been counting
Looking for a puff of skunk

People get tired, of corpse 
Thereâs no problem for us
We have a secret source 
How to kick your ass!

Fingers are stoned, hell
Irregular hailstorm of might
Deaf like an empty shell
Strong opinions and motorbike by my side

When you get older
Gold has same price
You think you get slower
But wait, thereâs surprise!

People get tired, of corpse 
Thereâs no problem for us
We have a secret source 
How to kick your ass!
