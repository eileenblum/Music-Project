Malignant engine rumbling again
No need of gasoline, just wind in the hair
Music unlimited, as same as our will is...
Off you piss... Or get insane!

Shaking the Earth... 
Blowing your minds... 
Having of chicks... 
Roaring these words... At... Full... Throat!

Just keep moving fast, keep moving forth
Roll over stage by stage, power boosting up
Music unlimited, as same as our pain is...
Off you piss... Let's overload!

Shaking the Earth... At full throttle
Blowing your minds... At full throttle
Having of chicks... At full throttle
Roaring these words... At... Full... Throat!

Let's bulldoze all the ears... 
Let's bang all the heads... 
Let's drink all the pints... 
Let's puke all we ate... 
Let's make rock'n'roll... 
Roaring these words... At... Full... Throat!
