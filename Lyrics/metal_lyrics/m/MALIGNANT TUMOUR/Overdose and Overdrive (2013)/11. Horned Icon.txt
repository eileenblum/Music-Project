Why do you look like a panda
Using that corpsepaint
Satan's no propaganda
Harsh sound... That's the faith...

Devoted to horns... Devoted to cross
Of course upside down
Black holes instead of eyes
You're funny... Like sad clown...

Pay homage to us, bow and fucking kneel
We're bringing true Satan's music in real.

We want to see your faces
Not pale but sweating, red
Be Devil's moshpit aces
With horned icon... Over your heads...

Don't try to look like panda
Smile is your warpaint
It's the best propaganda
Rock 'n' roll is... The fallen saint...

Pay homage to us, bow and fucking kneel
We're bringing true Satan's music in real.

Pay homage to us, we're truly His breed
We're bringing true Satan's music to the streets.
Pay homage to us, we're truly His breed
We're bringing true Satan's music to the streets
