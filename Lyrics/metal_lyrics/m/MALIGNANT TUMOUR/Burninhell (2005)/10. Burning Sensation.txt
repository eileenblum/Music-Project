trying to escape from this bloody town
shellfire and bombs, nightmare comes around
reality shows just as army action
i am in front of tv and seeing burning sensation
burning sensation - american way
burning sensation - another fucking day
keep your eyes open, you're under control
national defense, million of bombs
government playing this game of death
I burn myself to make my nightmare end
burning sensation - american way
burning sensation - terror and hate
