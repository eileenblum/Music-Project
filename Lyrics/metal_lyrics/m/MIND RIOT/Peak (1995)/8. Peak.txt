[Words &amp; Music: Saikkonen]

Been here for too long
Eyes blackened in this dream
Tired of trying to belong
Life's never been seen here
Blank faces staring at
The flowers of bizarre
Which are the ones 
To fade away ?

I fuck the gods of beauty
To end this journey
Never been this dead before
To wake up again

Walking down the nameless routes
Without a destination
Mind, not afraid to lose
Flowing in the wrong direction
