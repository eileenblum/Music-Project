[Words: Saikkonen Music: Javanainen]

Raving souls on that rapturous sky
Do you hear them laugh and cry ?
Deviation, liberation
Proudly falling

Dance of an immortal
Mind above all beautiful
Sounds, can you see the sounds ?
Nothing above natural

Dance of an immortal

Raving souls on that rapturous sky
Do yo hear them laugh and cry ?
Fall again, fall again, fall again...
