[Words: Saikkonen Music: Saikkonen, Javanainen]

Why do they tear me apart ?
Those faceless demons
From the seas of emptiness
And never to touch
Nothing to hear 
Their calling
Can't I escape ?

I am a god and these are my tears
Lost are the sane and sincere

Screams of a which
Blackness in my heart
Holy sickness of soul,
Curtains in flesh
And never to touch
Nothing to hear
Their calling
Can't I escape ?

I am a god and these are my tears
Lost are the sane and sincere
