[Words: Saikkonen Music: Javanainen, Saikkonen]

Making holes to the head
Heavy raindrops fall
Waking up from the dead
Hear the wisdom call
Saw the reflection
Altering
Beauty in reflection
Dignity

I saw the rivers so red I don?t know
Wherever I should have been
Nothing but grey hell, I wanted to go
My mind seeking for releasing

Laugh in the rain
