[Words: Saikkonen Music: Saikkonen, Javanainen]

See the light
All over their faces, am I doomed ?
Forever 
sleeping
In the cradle of the unborn, dead
Never to wake up
I bleed as I exist 

But it's beautiful..

Yeah, I run away
Blood, I'm loosing blood
For the spirit I lay down
In the greatest pain
Falling again
Who is my god ?

Beauty in soul never fades away

You fear me...
