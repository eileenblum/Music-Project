[Words: Saikkonen Music: Saikkonen, Javanainen]

Through the centuries of misery
Hand in hand with death we've wandered
Another morning, the sun risen
Shall we see it again
You will never know

Sub-conscious self-destruction
Soon to be in the end of the path
Like a typhoon
Only ruins we've left behind

As the truth of divinity
We'll never find
On the playground
Of the human mind

Too late to cry
We all have died

Peaceful existence, tranquility
Hopeless dream, never come true
A bestial mind hidden in humanity
Never changing, we fall

Sub-conscious self-destruction
Now being in the end of the path
Like a typhoon
Only ruins we've left behind
