[Words &amp; music: Saikkonen]

Sitting in room
Naked under the cover of dark
Feeling like living 
Passed me by

Sorrow of my wasted life
What did I do wrong, why ?
Is this worth it ?
I don't wanna know
Should I ?

Questions of my life
My dream of life died

Whatever I did, whatever I do
Never get the satisfaction
Meaningless of all existence
Makes me wanting to die
Running out of life

Away from the ruins of mine
Is the way I need to go
Unknown is the way I wander
Able to see only the future
Missing the past, no reality
To lay down in silence
Watching into horizon
