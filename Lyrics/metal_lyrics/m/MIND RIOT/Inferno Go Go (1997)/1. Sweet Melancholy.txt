[Music: Saikkonen, Javanainen Words: Saikkonen]

Don't wanna say a word
No need to explain
I rather turn my back
And walk away again
These walls fall on me
Can't breath no more
No one can tell me
What I'm living for

I had a feeling, too

I wouldn't know
If the sun would shine
I wouldn't care
If you'd ask me why
I'm tired of everything
And everyone around
Sweet melanholy's
What it's all about
