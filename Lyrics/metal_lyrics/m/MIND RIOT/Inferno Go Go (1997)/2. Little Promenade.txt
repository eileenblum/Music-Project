[Music &amp; words: Saikkonen]

I am afraid of you, you think
I never look into your eyes
I wish I'd see you disappear

Why don't you leave me
Alone with my harmless life
I wish I'd see you disappear

Go away, Go away

Don't want you to explain
I wouldn't understand

I just wanted to enjoy
My little promenade alone
Nothing could turn me down today

Is there any life
Left behind that empty stare
Something has taken you over
