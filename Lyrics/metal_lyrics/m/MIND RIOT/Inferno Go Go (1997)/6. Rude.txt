[Music &amp; words: Saikkonen]

In the forest of melancholy
I run like an animal
These colours for me to see
Those things to recall

Absorbing my surroundings
Feeding my obsession
My insides darkening
These clouds of depression
Again in my head

Heads blow up - sometimes

It seems that I love to see
See myself crawl in misery
I've forgotten the joy of life
It's fading in front of my eyes

Heads blow up - sometimes

I tried to release my soul
Covered a dozen times
Never found a way out of it
Reality grinds
