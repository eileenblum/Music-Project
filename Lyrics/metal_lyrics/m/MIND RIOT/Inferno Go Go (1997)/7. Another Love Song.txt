[Music: Saikkonen, Javanainen Words: Saikkonen]

Nothing ever compared to
Your love that I could not resist
How little I knew about anything
I wanted to hold you tight in my arms
I would not let you go
But I knew I'd hit the ground after all

An agonizing pain hit my
Body and soul tremendeously
Would I ever rise my head again
You saw the candles burning me
I had a feeling of dishonesty
It really didn't feel that bad at all

Am I losing it - my soul

That beautiful thing 
She made me suffer
Oh yeah, she made me suffer

As if I'd ever really crawl 
Before anybody's eyes
I enjoy this game as much as you do
You saw the candles burning me
I had a feeling of dishonesty
It really didn't feel that bad at all
