[Music &amp; words:Saikkonen]

I drown in a blueshining beauty
Cold bliss for a sleepless
Desolation, tranquility
Alone with my dream

I wanna feel it
I wanna touch it
I wanna feel your stone cold skin
Your sweetest body

I found you in this dream so real
You touched my soul gently
Sub-consciously I realise 
I will have to open my eyes

I wanna feel it
I wanna touch it
I wanna feel your stone cold skin
Your sweetest body
