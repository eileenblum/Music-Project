[Music: Saikkonen, Javanainen Words: Saikkonen]

I realised nothing at all
When you pushed me down again till the end
You burst my soul in little pieces 
I?ve got no more tears to shed

I look at you my reflection
I despise you for all that you have done
Deep in your eyes I see nothing
I can see nothing
I just should turn my back and run away

You got no one
