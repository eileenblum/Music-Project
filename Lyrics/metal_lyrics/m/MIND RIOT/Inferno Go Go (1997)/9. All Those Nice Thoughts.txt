[Music: Saikkonen Words: Saikkonen]

I remember when I first fell down
All the way, all the way down
Nothing ever could have changed my mind
Make me think all those nice thoughts

What did you think when you first saw me
Drown in the greatest self-pity
What a depression without a slightest reason
Would I bow to you again

Look at me, don't you dare to look at me
Why don't you leave me alone
Please ask what's wrong with me

No responsibility of anything around
No idea, not a cause to search for better
