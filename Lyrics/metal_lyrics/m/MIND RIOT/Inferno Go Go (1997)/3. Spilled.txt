[Music &amp; words: Saikkonen]

Never wanted to let you go
Out of my reach
I saw you flying into my dreams
I got to bring you down

You spilled the water 
Spilled the water so deadly calm 
I was reborn, was reborn
I felt my blood

You sucked my blood

You tempt me to unleash the wicked one
A motion so unreal
You?ll take me somewhere
You force me to reveal
