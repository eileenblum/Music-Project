[Music: Saikkonen, Javanainen Words: Saikkonen]

Can't breath when they're around
Screaming without a sound
I left myself a stain
I got to feel the pain
Feel the pain of my own

Temptation falls on my grace

Oh I fall in temptation
It is like an addiction
Suffocating to abstain
I got to feel the pain
Feel the pain of my own

Temptation falls on my grace

Take my hand and I'll walk after you
Deep down is the way I'm heading to
You move in such a beautiful way
I know they'll dance on my grave the final day

Temptation falls on my grace
