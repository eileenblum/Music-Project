Bombers fly high
To a destination of innocent people
The crew of the plane
Is unknowing of he terror
That they'll soon unleash

Nuclear terror
Unleashed on the world
Destructing of life
Radiation sickness
Spreads like disease
Mutating what left

Then they drop the bomb
A destruction of life that has
Never been seen
Many still suffer
From the leftover poison
That it left behind

Which has never been done
All it was for
Was to test the destruction of a nuclear bomb
All it left behind
Was mutated babies and a cancerous plague
