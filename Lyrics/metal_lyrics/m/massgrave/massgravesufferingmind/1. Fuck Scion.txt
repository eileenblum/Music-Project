How can you all be so blind?
To fall for this shit
Open your eyes
This blatant marketing scheme
Insults our cause
Disguising greed
Scion records
Dumb as it sounds
Your bullshit agenda must be brought down
There's no room in our scene
For sell out fucks &amp; car companies

Scion, fuck off
&amp; take your bands with you

Free records &amp; shows
To help lure you in
Recognize bands on their label
So you think it's legit
It's a cheap fucking ploy
An advertisement campaign
On their brochures &amp; free t-shirts
I'll piss to put out the flames
