Too broke to get in
But your bag is full of beer
You speak of some bullshit
As if your presence alone
Is payment enough

Theres no such thing
As scene seniority
I could care less about
What you did or who you used to be

You bore me with your shit
Spew it somewhere else
Support your fucking scene

Everything must do their part
To keep this movement strong
Support your fucking scene
