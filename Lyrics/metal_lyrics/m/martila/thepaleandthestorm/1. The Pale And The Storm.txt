[feat. Steinar Albrigtsen]It makes no sense to be strong
Extinction of mankind carries on
No personal insight, a common flaw
Amongst us men of cruelty
Drowning in a fatal ignorance
Collisions of darkness take me home
Stones that hit the fragile skin
Demand a cold heart, whispering
Judgement, and its hate towards me
And I absorb it all again and again
I am watching
THE PALE AND THE STORM
And it's me, the murder
I fear
THE PALE AND THE STORM
Searching me, out of sight
THE PALE AND THE STORM
The fugitive that
I am THE PALE AND THE STORM
Kiss me, take me with you
Call me by the hatred I am
I promise to never bore the devil
And the devil never bores me
Never bores me
When a collage of life passes
I become the aggression required
Trapped in an escape that echoes
Take it away, and be gone
I am watching
THE PALE AND THE STORM
And it's me, the murder
I fear
THE PALE AND THE STORM
Searching me, out of sight
THE PALE AND THE STORM
The fugitive that I am
THE PALE AND THE STORM
Recall her desperation in
The depth of her scars
She wrote my name
In a pool of blood, dying
Death was the only option
As I embraced the darkest of lives
And chose all the wrong ways
To resurrect me, and close his demise
Crossing the edge of betrayal
Disaster follows freedom
Left helpless, and in shame
His ignorance, accepting lies
He who raised the violence within me
Ina reversed abortion
I left
The dead child
I remember,
I remember the screams, and the cries
Dead masks covering me
Dreams take me down
So real, so dark, so painful
Begin the hunt of two worlds
The burial of all light, complete
Impervious to all criticism
Restless, adjusting to evil
In this game, forever lost
Protecting my own ghosts
Hiding all imperfection
Taking their life away
I am the revenge of a peaceful man
On a deadly path, total destruction
I view the portrait of a man in collision
Knowing the slave of a weak mind
Condemn this, for letting you in
Gasping for air, leading the bleed
Rotting, sinking, calling to disconnect
Tell the lies, strike the venom
The poison was your medicine
Calling out, destiny
Hiding you, the bride of his
Turn the hero down again
As the voice weakens you
