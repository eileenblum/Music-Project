Please leave me alone today.
Somber weather, a weakened vigor,
this pensive ambiance weighs my heart.

Life, as you'll see,
has a tendency to fool most all, but not me.
So I ask as another did in his soliloquy,
"to be or not to be?"

An irreconcilable dichotomy
permeates everything that we do:
our bodies and symbolic reasoning.

The bridge that connects the two
breaks down when we
rationalize who we love, why we hope,
why we cry when itâ s time to die;
and this all troubles me.

Whereof one cannot speak
thereof one must be silent.
It is not without a fine stroke of irony
that words are all we have.
So I'm left with nothing to to say to you.
In the depths of our reason there lies darkness in pure form.
Turn away.

Leave me here to wallow in my own
solipsistic, dark, and melancholy world.
The strange winds of philosophy
will lead me where they will.
