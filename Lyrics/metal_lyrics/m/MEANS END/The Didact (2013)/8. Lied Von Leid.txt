Once more you near me,
wavering apparition;
a turbid haze every time you alight.
Oft' have you come at dead of night
and pressed me.
Will I yield to your petition?

Let go of your longing for (truth)
a transcending meaning.
You conjure up fleeting (thoughts)
dreams and wonders

Old grief revives a fair love
wrapped round my neck.
Remember fond caress, a silken dress...
tears lave my heart,
which by fortune was cheated
to believe the universe
held answers I needed.

Time spent searching for knowledge of
the world through the faculty of reason.

Let go of your longing for (truth)
a transcending meaning.
You conjure up fleeting (thoughts)
dreams and wonders

If I could only find
our true nature through my mindâ¦

What lies beyond doesn't interest me.
It's this moon that shines down
onto my sorrows.
What this means to me becomes existence.
