We wait for light,
but behold darkness;
This I profess.

The more I learn, the less I know.
I always wondered how it can be so.

Perhaps the true delight is not knowing
but finding?

Searching through a demon haunted world,
not knowing what I hope to find.
The arc of my mind bends
toward a singularity,
accelerating the perception of time.

Into a point this focus is compressed,
adding new knowledge, everything is coalesced.
I know more now than before.
The only result being I need more...

Life can't ever be long enough
to find a key that sets me free.
Would I even want to be released?
The answer to this question is no.

Treading into the unknown;
places where I'll be left alone.
I'll use my mind as a wick
and my soul as the oil to light the way
just for a short while longer,
like a candle in the dark...
