How do you know I'm mad?
You must be,
or you wouldn't have come here.

My eyes widen
as I step through into another world,
lucid unlike one's dreams.

It seems familiar but not quite.
Has something changed
during the night?

I do feel a little different
now that I think about it.
But if I'm not the same today
as I was yesterday, how can I allay
thoughts cast in disarray?
a shifting identity?
I'm afraid I can't explain myself
because I'm not myself, you see?

Treading through with a curious gait,
the vagrant mask I wear
negates the world.

Simulacrum of a man,
(maybe the shadow is the one who casts the man?)
springing from the shadow;
paint a picture of me that fits the frame
so I can blend into the madness.
Endless regression.

Treading through with a curious gait,
the vagrant mask I wear
negates the world.

Can it really be that everone is crazy,
or is it only me that's out of my mind?
Does that question even make sense? No.

Treading through with a curious gait,
the vagrant mask I wear
negates the world.

If I had a world of my own,
everything would be nonsense.
Nothing would be what it is,
because everything would be what it isn't.
And contrary wise, what is, it wouldn't be.
And what it wouldn't be, it would.
You see???
