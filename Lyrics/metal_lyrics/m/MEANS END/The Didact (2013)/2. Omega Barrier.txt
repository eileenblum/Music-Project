Some feel that the flexibility
of the human mind
is irreconcilable with the notion
that it resides on rigid hardware.

Though, if our self-understanding can't ever be truly complete then perhaps it's not so strange to feel that way.

What was once such a tangible feeling,
now is lost,
and seems to lead to a paradox.

âYou can't consistently assert this truth.â
Whether you assert it or deny it,
you would inevitably admit
that you are not able to assert
every single truth about yourself.

You've reached the Ï barrier.
You can't escape the system
because it's built out of you.

We see complex emergent phenomena from deep within, bubble to the surface.

This fits well with the observation that we simply canât force ourselves to describe the neural or even symbolic functions from whence something like ambition emerges from; itâs just there.

We could very well just be machines underneath it all and never be the wiser.

Then so be it. It wouldn't change anything.
Nothing. Not a goddamn thing.
