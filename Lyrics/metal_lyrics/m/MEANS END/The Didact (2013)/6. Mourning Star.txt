To view the world through eyes of fire,
I look up and invoke thy aid.
Sing o muse,
and tell us why the one that's broken
has our sympathy.

Through no fault of our own,
the absolute rendered out his judgement
on the ones that were more
than an empty shell,
and cast down shadows
of an inverse nature.

Springing full formed from my head,
my blood, dripping with sin.
This poisoned unity,
produced the death that you so fear.

Shackled by destiny,
to oppose the heavenly.

Neverending in suffering.
There is no repose, every second's infinite.
I yearn to bring destruction.

Ease would recant vows made in pain
as violent and void,
but forgiveness can't grow,
where wounds of hate pierced so deep.

Thoughts of revenge are so sweet,
intricate plans fill my head.
Soon they turn bitter, ere long,
back on me they recoil.

Neverending in suffering.
There is no repose, every second's infinite.
I yearn to bring destruction.

brew in hate, lie and wait, then destroy.

If I had a choice, know that I'd rather
reign in hell, than serve in heaven.
