The mind is a lonely place to be
when ones soul's quaint, honestly.

I'll accept your kind words,
only because you offer nothing more.
What greatness can be left
when flatterers humble themselves
and humble men are only flatterers.

Honor and happiness
awaits only those who do great deeds.
'Tis nearly vulgar to triumph over
the insignificant.

Still, what makes one great...
when nothing is truly significant?

Strong when facing power.
Considerate to the weak.
Forced by necessity
to show one's love and hatred openly.
Instinct and logic simultaneously.
Destined deterministic great souled man,
simply has no choice.

The mind is a lonely place to be
when ones soul is quaint, honestly.
