So you see through my deception,
found your way through the sand of the storm.
Marching on through this barren wasteland,
to the foot of terror's door.

Feel the lions gnashing at your legs,
while your lover dies from the poison of the snake.

We are hopeless now,
you won't find a way out,
you are bound in my eyes.

We must find our way out
from this godforsaken hell,
back to the order,
back to the structure,
back to sleep.
Oh this desolation breaking us must be refused,
take to flight.
Back to the order,
back to the structure,
back to life.

Feel the lions gnashing at your legs,
while your lover dies from the poison of the snake.

We are hopeless now,
you won't find a way out,
you are bound in my eyes.

So far beyond the sun,
desperate to return.
We rise above the battlefields
and feel our bodies burn.
With your hand upon my lips,
I speak now through my eyes,
you can see the worst in me now.
This is our goodbye.

So here we stand,
build our lives on the graves of the innocent.
Here we are,
chained to the gallow,
slaves to the desperate.
So here we stand alone.
