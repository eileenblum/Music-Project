Fighting for a thousand years,
we forget the right.
Deep inside, a war waged over time.
(Oh!)
Weak men sigh in the rising tides,
drown this goddamn garden.
Promises will break,
in a promising display,
we will prove our love amidst the darkest nights.
We won't fade away, we won't fade away,
we will take to flight.

Don't look down my love,
tragedy strikes at the heart.

Tonight, we fall
into the hands of gods.
Out of the wilderness,
we're trying so desperately,
trying to find our way.

Feathers fray and shake,
chills me to the bone.
Shadow shuts the gate,
lock us up alone.
We feel this ancient pain,
heartache like splinters that swim through my veins.
Won't you hear my heartbeat battle cry,
shouting, curse at the sky.

So sing harmony
to the dark clouds.
Raining tremulous rivers in spite of the sun.
See our fire
light a burning effigy
of cursed guardians and captors,
crowned with ash.

Tonight, we fall
into the hands of gods.
Out of the wilderness,
we're trying so desperately,
trying to find our way.
