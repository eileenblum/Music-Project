I've seen your arrows pierce the city streets,
and the first to throw their stone
is the first to hang from the tallest of trees.
Oh, I've seen you bear your teeth,
with a spear through your heart
from an ancient affair of deceit,
a nightmare lingering inside
inside of a death marked dream.

I walk the paths of this kingdom,
searching for my love.
I call her name
to the moon and the sun with a
hopeful prayer on my tongue.

Oh, bound in the vows of heartless men
to be claimed like the spoils of a voyage cascaded in sin.
Our children cannot hide another year (Oh no!)
The faceless walls of a citadel
are a prison I've learned to fear.

I walk the paths of this kingdom,
searching for my love.
I call her name
to the moon and the sun with a
hopeful prayer on my tongue.

Read these palms that I might see light of dawn.

In my dreaming I see her face,
she wears a veil that shrouds her gaze.
She speaks of the love and horror
that await me when I wake.
(Wah!)
We walk in a path to see
the light of a lover's dream.
The fortunes of fear call to find us all.
Now the stars in the sky concede
to write our destiny,
a hand to hold us all,
and send us off to sleep.
