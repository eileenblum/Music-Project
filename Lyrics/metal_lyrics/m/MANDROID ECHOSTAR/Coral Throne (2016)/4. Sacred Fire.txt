Take me down into the arms of every word I've found
Calling out to me amid these strangers unraveling a tapestry
In my dreaming, in the throws of greed, in the lies that I would believe.
For the way we sell our valour short, keep us down, falling to the ever fading floor.
I can see what the mirror reflects in this ever lasting light
Every love I've seen in this waking dream will forever outshine all the suffering.
The goddess comes to me, she is answering in this harmony.
Lust for blood and gold will never bring you hope
Pray at the temple for stars at night, offering sorrow for vaticide
If we're alive at the break of day, give all you love for the sacrifice.
There is nothing sacred in that ornament worn in the dusk
It is deep inside your heart and mine, the chance for a life in golden tides.
The streets ran ablaze, this is to be the ruin of kings.
Vows of the covenant spoken in time, they all fall flat on their own irreverent tales of woe
With all the cryptic words you trust to keep us sanctimonious.
I'll return to tell what I have seen, free in faith and love, we will forever be.
The moment I saw the sun it was deep in her eyes and the crown was on fire
I'll never look back again to the time of a lore in the hands of a saviour
Calling in the night.
