Fall at the feet of the world
I've never seen such a wretch upon our shore, fortunes of a silent discord
In the wake of a dream, like a lifetime before,
'Fore the day that the demons would knock down our door
The wind's singing like a phantom song, goddess in the sky
She walks the rivers of the land, along the mountains spine
They carve these caverns in the name of iron swords and golden stone
The arrow flies in blackest night, and it tears away the moonlight from her eyes.
Tonight, we will not turn away from the devil in the trees in his deadened, hollow gaze I see the end, to a dream of holy fire.
In the sky the smoke will rise, ever to the heavens heights.
Born to a black crown and coral bones, cast to a white throne adorned in gold and oak
In fading skies, follow the wind and fall ever into after life
Drifting in the dead of night upon a shaded river
The mist arises
Hunted
The spectral sight by haunted eyes along the fern
Beware their wolfish bite
The fang in flesh like daggers cut
The vulturous
These hearts have fallen to the dirt forever more.
We conjure sorrow with a devilish design
Confessing with a silver tongue to inhumation so divine
And though the time may come our fortress falls to fire
The royalty, blood blessed at dusk will never die.
Hear us now, pray this dawn brings light.
No life will be sewn in tomorrows sight for the goddess in the sky,
Oh lord, in the fares of Faustian deeds, on a path that winds through the wild,
To a house of rose and devils dreams.
