Dazed and hypnotized,
Oh my vision is in rapture, wading in the floral tides.
Her hands, oh they've got me mesmerized,
And when she sings to me the stars collide in my nocturnal eyes
Drink one more from the grail, feel the haze of your ever hexing words, never heard.
Breathe in the warmth, leave your burden in the cold.
Fall into the water, follow me, follow me into the fathoms of light
Drink one more from the grail, we'll forget we're supposed to be at war with one another for the world, cut right through that devils veil,
Leaving hell for a destiny, in to a dream that never dies.
I know love is the sum of all our lives.
Raise your hands to the kingdom, each one of a heartless reign,
Raise your hands to the kingdom, be rid of them.
Holy movements, in her arms, holy movements in her heartbeat
Holding on to hollow living and heavens hand,
Take a breath and let it go, we'll never come back home
To that darkness, where light is divided and cast in to the song of oblivion, the death of all we love
Believe in the right to live in the Eden she wears in the light of her eyes
The woman king revives the daughters of a hundred broken nights
