Did you cross the earth to be silent among the castle walls.
In bedlam we surrendered to devious offerings.
A long and bitter haunt by the callus words of gods, and the song of the dead sun
The future told from cursed hands, alive and breathing in the desert sand
While jaded bones of blackened marrow take the wind and the snow
Dying yet trying to hold a place on the earth with their sights in heaven, never ending fall.
All the while they were living in the dawning of a sacred sky,
The tides that flow inside us all, we were drowning,
Cast in iron at the mercy of the undertow
Oh, they say the wounds have taken all the life from you
We held them back 'til night, the shields were all but shattered
In shallow tides, they were talking death and glory for the sake of all our mournful lives.
If all our holy eyes can see is all that we believe, let the memories ignite.
Find a way to cast off the iron and break from the gauntlet of night.
The spirits alive tonight, tonight
All around us the spirits are singing, the voices beckoning
To the heartbeat inside of us all that's telling us we're meant to be.
The fear unfolds within our bones, the path we take will lead us to a world unknown.
The fear unfolds within our bones, but we can make it out alive if we can see beyond the shore,
We'll make these caverns shake like thunderstorms, and watch the world awake this dawn.
