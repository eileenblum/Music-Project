Cut down, the goddess fans a fire in the crown
The mountain fallen, carved to the bone
Harvest into temple for the coral throne
All those, the creatures broken under the stone
Buried in husk of the ground
Ever more the feast of worms and god
King of dawn and of dusk converging
Seasons soak through the lights returning
All the while sleeping sights ensure me
That tomorrow will bring sun of red.
I've been surrogate to years of burning oil with all the pagans
Memories of jealous gods in heavens fade
Calling creatures Christ, damning diamond eyes
I can see the shattered glass collide with hate
Run toward the light, to the burning of
The pine box king, a blackened frame on fire
Be one with us, oh migrant love of mine, we live not to die
But to feel the things inside of us that cut the demons down in the night
The nightingale sings birth and death, it's a song I've never heard
In the smoke and ash I found that bird still singing
Where are we, this can't be where I had those sleepless dreams
Love and light, the eros of the night.
In the sacred fire of an ancient mire, I lead these hands to sleep as we burn it down
In the sacred cold of your winter soul, they take your hands for all the grandeur they desire
Sleep now, son of a ghost, you walk holy ground
We will be there in the night to follow
Breathe now, son of a ghost awake
Alone in the devils dreams
Sleep now, son of a ghost, you walk holy ground
We will be there in the night to follow
Breathe now, son of a ghost awake
Alone in the devils dreams
Seasons fall on our fortress, fanning the fire of god and gold
Saviour, sinner and beggar, dead in the dawn
The fire fed upon.
