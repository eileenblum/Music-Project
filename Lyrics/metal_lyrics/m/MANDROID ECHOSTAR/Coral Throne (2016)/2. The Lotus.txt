Take the sight of the dawn for all the sky it shines
Unveiling of another day upon my weary eyes
We'll hunt 'til the falling of night
So long as spear is sharp and antlers break within my bite
Fall to the ancient floor and sleep forever more
Follow the sun before we're fighting for a way back
What is this light? Will we make it back alive?
A pale disguise of evil circles us in sacred doors
Follow the pine, pay no attention to the spirits of the night
Follow the pine, pay no attention to the ghost that follows every time
I walk among the smoke left breathing iron lung
Remember what your father said of a haunted way and animus that dances on the wreathes of the dead
Fall of day brings the strangest of sights to my wandering eyes
Save this life, in the hands of this nightmare we keep up the fight
Speak to the phantom all around us to the mass of all the moonless shade alive
Oh the phantom he will keep us until the skeleton is broken, bare and dry within the pine
We are just lost and young in love
We never meant to see a sleeping curse come back to life
We are so lost and young in love
But we'll never let you take this life for the sake of night
We'll fight a fading light.
