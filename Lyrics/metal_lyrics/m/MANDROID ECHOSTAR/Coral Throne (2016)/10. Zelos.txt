Hold, the very moments that can steal your soul
When the goddess broke the night, drained the blood from the devils throat
In the silver she severs his holy hoax, as he barks in sermon of metatron invoked
Just don't let go, love of mine, we'll survive to the sunlight,
She brought you back to me from the barrens of the grave
I can feel your heart awake to fan the flames
Be with me at the end of it all, be with me to the dawning of love
Be with me and awake to the fall of all this desolation
Every one awakened from a shrouded dream in the waves of midnight
And the desperate times and the desperate measures they have taken to take us down.
Oh another season in the iron hands we'll never take again, the misery has gone to far
Just don't let go, love of mine, we'll survive to the sunlight,
She brought you back to me from the barrens of the grave
I can feel your heart awake to fan the flames
Oh is there a evil yet to feel this blaze. I'll cut him down in the night.
For every undeserved life you'd take in the name of the, gods,
Will wake and turn to look through weary eyes,
All they see is paradise ever bound in the shining stars
In the grim and ghastly howl of the devils coral crown
We begin again and look upon the fall of endless nights.
Hear us, hear our song, you are the light when all hope is gone
