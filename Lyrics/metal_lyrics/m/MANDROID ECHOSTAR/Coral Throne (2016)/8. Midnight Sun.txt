The moonlight shines for you
The stars are glowing in your eyes
Despite the danger that I put you through.
When I see you dancing on the forest floor
Oh my sleeping heart's awake to the beauty of the world.
Day break, will you meet me by the lake
So we can shake these hexes from our names
Feel the sand between your toes,
And your spirit, shining, golden.
Oh the lovers and the omens wake tonight.
Don't fade away, don't fade away,
Don't fade into the prism of the secret light.
Don't fade away, don't fade away,
To the diamonds shining in the night.
Hear my voice and speak my name,
The swords of our fathers surrounding
A world astray, we sing the prayer,
Live and let love live in the sight of the sun
Sing the prayer for their lives.
Your hand and mine embrace the grace of midnight stars
But I want to see you bathed in sun and proud of who you are.
I really wish that I could speak your name before the lions' sleeping.
But I'll shelter you at night until the day the colours fade like dreaming.
Hear my voice and speak my name,
The swords of our fathers surrounding
A world astray, we sing the prayer,
Let love live in the light of day.
We are, we are the golden face of lovers in a hopeless place
We are, we are the open gates that lead the path away into the light of day.
