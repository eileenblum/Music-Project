Hear the waves, there's an axe to fall, as the serpents crawl through the leaves
With rusted sword you've never worn, you didn't seem to know my face
Faded in the grey of all these villains, I know you're name, I know you're fading away.
Hold me down, there's a slow and secret curse inside of me, no time, no time ever takes this cloud of reverie.
And I want to breathe but the falling rain won't let me see, I don't know if I'll ever find the key
To leave this place of endless oaths, to see this decade overthrown.
All the spells we're living under just to keep them on our minds
And the whispered incantations that hide the hollow sights
Of what we've done, while we looked the other way
But I know that you are with me and together we will find another way
There's something deadly in the heart of those sacred tomes
They talk salvation like we're walking on a tight rope.
From all the zealous ones illuminating me
Who've never spent a waking moment lost in love
Like a season of dreams, and awe of the beauty that the world can be.
In silence of survival, one word and you can set the spark
It's glowing in the embers, an off the cuff black smoke remark
It was said in passing and the meaning was mirage
But they took them for blasphemy and they cast you down to die,
No consequence divine, nor a fleeting final moment to breathe for the last time.
No more summoner, you are just a man in crimson veil
We bled in the days spent, we took you for your word as we were told
It turns out you were what was cursed all along
Within those hallowed bones.
