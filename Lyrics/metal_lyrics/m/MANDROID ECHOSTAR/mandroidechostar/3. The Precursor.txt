Here we will watch the sea,
rise above us all in the moonlight.
Haunted by all I see,
one last night to know
just how wrong we have been.

And I see the queen,
in the leaves and branches scattered on the ground.
And I hear her sing,
in the waves that bring our kingdom down.

This world of life and ancient stone,
its rivers run through my haunted soul.
Our mother earth, our father stars,
it takes the end just to know what we are.
Well the earth keeps on spinning,
and the queen is still breathing.
Itâs time that we left the throne
of a world that was never our own.

On this never ending night,
we feel the winds of parasight.
We are one with land and sky,
and at the end we will break the divide.
In the wake of all our broken designs
and the flaws of a mythical mind.
We will dream on through the waves,
and find our way back to the breaking of day.

And I see the queen,
in the leaves and branches scattered on the ground.
And I hear her sing,
in the waves that bring our kingdom down.

Hear us mother,
your children have gone too far,
in this cold night,
something awakes in our hearts and our minds.
Tonight we find
a path that leads back to the light,
we wait for the dawn in the rain,
sleep through the waves.

Hear us mother,
your children have gone too far,
in this cold night,
something awakes in our hearts and our minds.
(Tonight we find
a path that leads back to...)
