Oh, the kingdom awaits,
and I bring the shifting of the tides,
of the tides.
Feral serpent's gaze,
petrified protectors of the gate,
of the gate.

Soulless,
battered and broken.
Brought back,
brought back from your grave in the stars.
You, my creation, mechanical being of woe.
We will devour and conquer all.

So watch the ocean rise tonight,
feel the winds of my haunted skies.
For you are a being of light,
I have come here to lead you astray.
Hexaton,
curse this earth.
Illusion,
orbiting in reverse.

And once this world has been deprived of all its light,
I will begin the reign of endless parasight.
Dream through disaster.

The reign of serpent's jaws wrapped around earth,
prepare for falling skies.
For your temple walls will cave in,
pray to your gods that you might stay alive.

Oh, the kingdom awaits,
and I bring the shifting of the tides,
of the tides.
Feral serpent's gaze,
petrified protectors of the gate,
of the gate.
