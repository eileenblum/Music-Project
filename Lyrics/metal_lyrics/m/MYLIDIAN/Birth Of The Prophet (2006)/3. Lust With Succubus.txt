[Antoine, alone]
When I roamed in my darkness
I lost my mind
Where is my guide?
Can you hear my screams?
I try to find light,
There's only me
I would like to feel or find my way.
I'll never believe in
Love of my father.
Now, I am so cold...

[Lilith to Antoine]
Stop crying my faithfull child.
I will lead you to the light
Follow and see my real way!

[Lilith] Here, there's no betrayal
[Antoine] Let me see the other side
[Lilith]
You'll forget your broken dreams.
Can you see all my slaves?
[Antoine] I can feel their perverse minds
[Lilith] Do you want them to play with you?

[Antoine] Oh please, let me play with them
[Lilith] They came especially for you
[Antoine]
What a nice present.
A lot of pictures appear in my mind
[Lilith] I want you to unchain you mind
[Antoine] I'll do all that you say - My Goddess.

[Succubus] Come with us
[Antoine] I am coming bitches
[Succubus] Prepare you
[Antoine] Machines are ready
[Succubus] Fuck us all
[Antoine] I'll fuck you one by one
[Succubus] We are ready

[Antoine]
So, may the show begin!!!!!!

[Antoine to Succubus]
Avec ma chair meurtrie, humide de plaisirs interdits,
Je m'en rends Ã  vos dÃ©sirs, maÃ®tresses de l'envie.
Enfantes de la disgrÃ¢ce, filles de l'anathÃ¨me,
Je ne vous demande qu'une rÃ©vÃ©lation, la sensation extrÃªme.

[Lilith] Be lust, sin and trouble
[Antoine] I hope I've found my way
[Lilith]
You must believe in me.
I'll give you knowledge and pleasure
[Antoine] I will not disapoint you
[Lilith] Soon you will be my Prophet.

[Succubus] Come with us
[Antoine] I am coming bitches
[Succubus] Prepare you
[Antoine] Machines are ready
[Succubus] Fuck us all
[Antoine] I'll fuck you one by one
[Succubus] We are ready
[Antoine] So, may the show begin!!!!!!
[Succubus] Be yourself
[Antoine] I listen my instincts
[Succubus] Be violent
[Antoine] Your suffering will be my pleasure
[Succubus] Be evil
[Antoine] Your blood makes me drunk
[Succubus] Be perverse
[Antoine] My goddess guides my hand.
