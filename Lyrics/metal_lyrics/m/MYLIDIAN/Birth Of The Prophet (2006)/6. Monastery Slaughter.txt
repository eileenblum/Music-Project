[Storyteller]
The army of the night, Werewolves are around the Monastery.
Soldiers of God take your guns and be ready to fight
I hope your faith will not leave you tonight.
[Angels]
Holy slaughter.

[Storyteller]
Torture, betrayal, manipulation.
Not one Inquisition squad has stolen so many secrets
You can not keep them for eternity, they are here to take them.
[Angels]
We will pray for your own salvation.

[Angels and Crystal to God]
De profundis clamavi ad te
Exaudi vocem meam.

[Storyteller]
Werewolves burst through the gates.
The holy battle has begun, no one can escape from it.
May the blood run on the floor, holy rage invides their minds.
[Angels]
We will fight to your own salvation.

[Angels and Crystal to God]
De profundis clamavi ad te
Exaudi vocem meam.

[Angels to God]
Lux aeterna luceat eis Domine, cum sanctis tuis in aeternum, quia pius es.

[Storyteller]
Bestality, butchery, atrocity.
Please pray for teenagers who were in the church.
Their lives will be different after the Monastery Slaughter.
[Angels]
We will die to your own salvation.

[Angels and Crystal to God]
De profundis clamavi ad te
Exaudi vocem meam.
