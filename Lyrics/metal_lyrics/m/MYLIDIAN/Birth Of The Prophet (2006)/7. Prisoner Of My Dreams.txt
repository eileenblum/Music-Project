[Antoine in his bedroom]
I close my eyes and I begin to sleep,
The night invades me, doors are opened.
[Spirit]
Your mind leaves your body, your mind leaves your world.

[Antoine is dreaming]
An old man watches me then he invites me.
He takes my hand and we go down the stairs.

[Spirit in the Antoine's dream]
Your mind is in my world, now you are my toy
You are mine poor young boy, madness is so near.

[Antoine screams in his dream]
I am lost and afraid, I need some help,
Shadows move strangely in the magic mist.

[Antoine is dreaming]
A dark city grows slowly in the valley,
I've never seen those landscapes in the Earth.

[Spirit in the Antoine's dream]
You'll never wake up if I don't want you to,
Now you are the prisoner of your dreams.

[Horde Spirit in the dream]
No! Nowhere to run,
Nowhere to hope,
Nowhere to die.
