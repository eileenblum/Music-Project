[Antoine]
All my life I will serve the Chaos,
The law and harmony will be destroyed.

[Part I: Betrayed By The Father]

[Antoine enters in the cellar]
I can not believe what I see
The body of my love is on the floor,
My mother is dead, it's a ritual crime.
What a horror show, cast on my face.
I will find the hidden sorcerer,
Humanity is leaving my soul.

[Antoine's father to his son]
Don't become evil my poor young son,
One day you will understand my act,
I just hope you will forgive me.
You or your mother had to die
To stop this disaster.

[Antoine]
All my life I will remenber
How my father killed my love.

[Part II: Forbidden Love]

[Instrumental]

[Part III: Birth Of The Prophet]

[Antoine to his father]
I want to kill your pretty face,
Now, you must disappear.
I'll tear your flesh, I'll drink your blood,
Dad, for me, you are dead.

[Antoine] I'll embrace the Chaos,
[Lilith legion] Come, your futur's with us,
[Antoine] I will disown my blood.
[Lilith legion] You must leave this way.

[Antoine to his father]
I will destroy all sacraments
And the Divine Law.
Pleasure and joy must be removed
For the Creation.

[Antoine] I'll embrace the Chaos,
[Lilith legion] Come, your futur's with us,
[Antoine] I will disown my blood.
[Lilith legion] You must leave this way.

[Antoine to all]
Let this new faith enter your manipulated mind.
Open your eyes, open your mind,
Because you all are salves.

[Antoine] I'll embrace the Chaos,
[Lilith legion] Come, your futur's with us,
[Antoine] I will disown my blood.
[Lilith legion] You must leave this way.
