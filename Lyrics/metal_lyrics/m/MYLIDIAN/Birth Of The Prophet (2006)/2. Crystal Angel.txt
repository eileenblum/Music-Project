[Clyde]
I can feel the Chaos Prophet behind me,
His cold breath is freezing my christian soul.
Corruption, deception, lust invade the room,
I ask myself if my faith can escape from him.

[Clyde to Crystal]
I call you my guardian, please hear me and save me, I pray to - My Crystal Angel.
Keep away Lilith from me and be my shield against her faith - My Crystal Angel.

[Clyde to Antoine]
I will strike and break you and your followers,
I will destroy your false Goddess.
Come and fight demystified Lilith's puppet,
My white Angel puts you in the Divine Way.

[Clyde to Crystal]
I call you my guardian, please hear me and save me, I pray to - My Crystal Angel.
Keep away Lilith from me and be my shield against her faith - My Crystal Angel.

[Antoine to Crystal]
Die dirty bitch!

[Antoine to Crystal]
Come here bitch and prostrate yourself in front of the Chaos Prophet,
I would like you to know the darkest way to reach the Forbidden Pleasures.

[Clyde to Crystal]
I call you my guardian, please hear me and save me, I pray to - My Crystal Angel.
Keep away Lilith from me and be my shield against her faith - My Crystal Angel.
