Got her photo with her CHRIST and his autograph TONIGHT
kissed his lips and held his HAND, told her friends she's with the BAND...
MISTER INNOCENT I'M SURE - SHE'S TOO YOUNG AND IMMATURE!
SINCERITY IS THE NEW VULGARITY!

[Chorus:]
Come on baby you don't wanna be that NICE
sell yourself for any PRICE
sacrifice your self RESPECT,
you're just dying to CONNECT...

Look at all the pretty WHORES
pick the one who will be YOURS
say those lines you've MEMORIZED
be like all the other GUYS...

MISTER INNOCENT I'M SURE - SHE'S TOO DUMB AND INSECURE!
SINCERITY IS THE NEW VULGARITY!

[Chorus]

put your voodoo on her - don't be so superstitious!
put your voodoo on her - your words are so delicious!
put your voodoo on her - don't be so superstitious!
put your voodoo on her - REMEMBER HIDE THE MIRRORS!

ink your signature into her skin...
you just want to be WANTED...
WHEN YOU SMILE YOU ARE SO SWEET
LET'S PRETEND THAT I'M NAIVE
CLOSE MY EYES AND I CAN'T SEE WHERE I'VE GOT MY TONGUE IN CHEEK!

Let it run it's course and you'll be REDEEMED
open every door for your self ESTEEM,
got your skeleton key and it's safe to say
everyone is starved for attention THESE DAYS!
