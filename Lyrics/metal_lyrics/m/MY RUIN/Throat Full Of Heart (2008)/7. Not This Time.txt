You leave a DIRTY TRAIL... so obvious like the REST,
but it's easy to find you when you're living WAY OUT WEST!
Don't cut your mouth on a sharp tongue, better watch out what you SAY!
I'm not so nice today, it hasn't gone away YET...
And I'm not going nowhere - SO YOU BETTER GET USED TO IT!

[Chorus:]
It's all good and FAKE distance keeps you SAFE
there's six degrees of no space - good try BUT NOT THIS TIME!
Mediocre fits you PERFECT and I'm so AMUSED to HEAR IT,
but I'll never buy your BULLSHIT - just like I will NEVER FEAR IT!

Keep kissing ass, shaking hands - BE CAREFUL WHERE YOU PLAY!
I'm not so nice today, it hasn't gone away YET...
And I'm not going nowhere - SO YOU BETTER GET USED TO IT!

[Chorus]

YOUR LIFE LIKE YOUR MIND FEEDS ALL YOUR LIES!
It's been a long time coming - LONG TIME COMING!
And I'm so glad I went with my instincts and did this...
while they all think you're perfect so we must have DESERVED IT!
BUT I KNOW QUITE DIFFERENT - SO I WILL RID MYSELF OF WORDS WHICH I HAVE HELD HOSTAGE - IN MEMORY OF A GIRL!

YOUR OPINION WHO ASKED FOR IT CONSIDERING ALL THAT YOU'VE SAID...
THE NEVER ENDING SHIT TALKING WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN!

[Chorus]

YOUR LIFE LIKE YOUR MIND FEEDS ALL YOUR LIES!
NO... NOT THIS TIME...
NO... NOT THIS TIME...
NO... NOT THIS TIME,
I CUT THE TIES THAT BIND!

YOU KEEP PLAYING THE MARTYR...
YOU... KEEP PLAYING THE MARTYR....
YOU... KEEP PLAYING THE MARTYR - GOOD TRY BUT NOT THIS TIME!
