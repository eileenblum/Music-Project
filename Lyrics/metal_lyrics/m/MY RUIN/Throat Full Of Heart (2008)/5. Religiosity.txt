Through the eyes of VANITY, CHAOS AND ANARCHY -
you come to me with open arms still NEEDING...
HAVE LAMB WILL MARTYR - HAVE LAMB
WILL SLAUGHTER LET ME LAY MY HANDS UPON YOU AND BRING YOU TO YOUR KNEES!

[Chorus:]
RELIGIOSITY - DEDICATION AND BELIEF - YOUR GOD CAN'T HELP YOU NOW!
CURIOSITY - THERE IS NO RELIEF! MY GOD IS EMPTY NOW!

Through the eyes of VANITY - THE YEARS OF SANITY -
I come to you with open wounds still BLEEDING...
HAVE LAMB WILL MARTYR - HAVE LAMB
WILL SLAUGHTER LAY YOURSELF UPON ME BABY AND BRING ME TO MY KNEES!

RELIGIOSITY - DEDICATION AND BELIEF - MY GOD CAN'T HELP ME NOW!
CURIOSITY - THERE IS NO RELIEF YOUR GOD IS EMPTY NOW!

Obscene dirt worshipping heathens FLOCK to the Judas like flies on SHIT...
the only way to get rid of the pain is just to LIVE THROUGH IT...
and we are punished for having no regrets, and we are banished -
BY THOSE WHO BOUGHT INTO IT!

If knowing is cognition and feeling is EFFECT, then doing is behaviour what comes NEXT...
through the eyes of GREED and LUST, YOU NEVER WANTED TO BELIEVE IN US!

Is it a love of lying or is it fear of dying -
does it really matter if no-one bothers trying -
and in the aftermath when there is nothing left
will everyone just go away when everything has been SAID?!

The road to perdition is paved with GOOD INTENTIONS -
the road to salvation is lined with your OBSESSIONS...
