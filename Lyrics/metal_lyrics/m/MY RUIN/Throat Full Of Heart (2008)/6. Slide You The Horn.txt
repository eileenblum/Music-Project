Are you ready? come on, yeah! Come on baby cause we're going DOWN - tearing up this whole damn TOWN...
light it up and take a HIT - COME ALIVE AND SHAKE THAT SHIT!

[Chorus:]
HERE WE GO, WE'RE AT IT AGAIN - LIVING FAST YEAH
SIN AFTER SIN BEEN HELD DOWN FOR WAY TOO LONG,
COME OVER HERE WHILE I SLIDE YOU THE HORN!
It's a crazy little party TOWN - flying high 'til we hit the GROUND
so come on baby let's tie one on and keep it going to the BREAK OF DAWN, YEAH!

[Chorus]

SLIDE IT!

Yeah you're going down baby, oh driving me CRAZY
Nobody can save me - CAN'T FIGHT IT KNOW YOU GOTTA SLIDE IT YEAH... OH YEAH!
A little whisky is all we need - some Uncle Jack from Tennessee
so come on baby let me see you shake - YOU'RE GOING DOWN WHILE WE PICK UP THE SNAKE!

[Chorus]

YEAH! you're going down baby, oh driving me CRAZY
nobody can save me - CAN'T FIGHT IT KNOW YOU GOTTA SLIDE IT YEAH... OH YEAH!
HERE WE GO ROCK HARD FAST... DIE YOUNG STAY PRETTY - YOU KNOW IT WON'T LAST, NO WAY!
