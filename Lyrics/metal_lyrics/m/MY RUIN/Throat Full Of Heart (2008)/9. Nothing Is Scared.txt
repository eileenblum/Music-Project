I know you think you know me... from all of the MAGAZINES...
Everybody loves a good comeback story... but that's really not my SCENE...
I don't wanna be the love you LOVE, you'll just hate me again next MONTH...
Let's not pretend that we are FRIENDS - I DON'T WANNA SHAKE YOUR HAND!
Your ego speaks so FLUENT... but your words are just so PASSE...
And you know I knew you'd do it... I WOULDN'T HAVE IT ANY OTHER WAY!
Now you're coming into my HOME... let me kill two birds with one STONE...
It's gonna take much more than your PEN... TO WRITE ME OFF AGAIN!

[Chorus:]
THIS IS THE ART OF SCREAMING - THERE'S NOTHING SACRED HERE!
YOU'D BETTER SORT YOUR DEMONS AND FIND OUT WHAT YOU FEAR!
If everything I say OFFENDS YOU...
Maybe you should go back to CHURCH...
I've got a lot of enemies, true... BUT THAT'S BECAUSE I HATED THEM FIRST!

So let me pray for ROCK...
you keep praying to god the devil's on his way and he can't be STOPPED,
We're all gonna die so cover your WRISTS and lord have mercy on my LIPS!
THIS IS THE ART OF SCREAMING - THERE'S NOTHING SACRED HERE!
YOU'D BETTER SORT YOUR DEMONS AND FIND OUT WHAT YOU FEAR!
THIS IS THE ART OF BREATHING - IT'S ALL OR NOTHING HERE!
IT'S TIME TO FACE YOUR MIRROR and find the one you fear...
