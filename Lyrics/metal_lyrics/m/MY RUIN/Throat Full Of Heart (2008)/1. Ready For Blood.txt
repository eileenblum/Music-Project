Daughters of Mara - cast this net into the SHALLOW
Drag the water - personalities so HOLLOW
Underneath the surface - cowards tell their tales of WOE
Count your casualties so clever - NOTHING STAYS BURIED FOREVER!

[Chorus:]
TELL YOUR GOD TO READY FOR BLOOD WORDS WILL BE YOUR OWN DEMISE!
TELL YOUR GOD TO READY FOR BLOOD - LOYALTY IS JUST A LIE!

Drag the water - trust in those that we can SEE
Daughters of Mara - Recognize my ENEMIES
Forgive our trespasses - keep our conscious CLEAN
Let me give your last words to the DEVIL - NOTHING STAYS BURIED FOREVER

[Chorus]

Time heals everything - EXCEPT THIS HATRED IN MY HEART!
Friendships that can cease were never TRUE... I'd rather be feared than be LOVED!

TELL YOUR GOD TO READY FOR BLOOD - STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM US!
TELL YOUR GOD TO READY FOR BLOOD - TELL YOUR GOD WE'VE HAD ENOUGH!
Learn who is REAL - recount them at a later DATE -
BURN HOLLYWOOD BURN, ALL THOSE THAT ARE SO FAKE!

Sleep deprived me of impulsiveness to LIE...
Now I send condolences to those that we watched DIE -
No good deed goes UNPUNISHED...
IN THE END I WON'T REMEMBER WORDS OF ENEMIES...
JUST THE SILENCE OF THOSE WHO CLAIMED TO BE FRIENDS OF ME!
DESECRATED MEMORES BECAME A BLESSING IN DISGUISE -
IT TOOK A BRUTAL LANGUAGE TO OPEN UP MY FUCKING EYES!
