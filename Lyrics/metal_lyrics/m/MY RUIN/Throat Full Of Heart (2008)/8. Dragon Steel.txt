HEY BOY - KEEP TALKING you watch and we'll KEEP ROCKING
got the ego but ya got no HEART -
got all dressed up and couldn't play the PART...
Your friends, you KEEP them, don't know them and we didn't wanna MEET them...
keep it going but you ain't for REAL
you ain't nothing but DRAGON STEEL!

[Chorus:]
Put the hammer down - gonna ride right over you now...
put the hammer down - gonna ride gonna ride right over...
put the hammer down - gonna ride right over you now...
PUT THAT HAMMER DOWN!

HEY BOY - YOU WANT IT, can't get it but you know we've GOT IT,
happened so fast that it must be FATE - one day you're here next day REPLACED!
Your face - TWO SIDED - we know you and you know you can HIDE IT...

keep it going but you ain't for REAL
you ain't nothing but DRAGON STEEL!

[Chorus]

YOU LOOK SO BLOATED IN YOUR SELF IMPORTANT FAME - THEY SEE YOUR PHOTOS BUT NOBODY KNOWS YOUR NAME!
TAKE YOUR DUMB BLONDE COCAINE WHORE FEED HER LIES AND SELL HER MORE...
TELL YOUR FAMILY THAT YOU'RE FINE WORK THAT DOOR AND DO YOUR TIME!

PUT THE HAMMER DOWN - gonna ride right over you now...
put the hammer down - gonna ride, gonna ride MOTHERFUCKER!
put the hammer down - gonna ride right over you now,
PUT THAT HAMMER DOWN!

YOU'RE JUST A MOUTH THAT'S TALKING LOUD - YOU'RE JUST A MOUTH TALKING!
YOU'RE JUST A MOUTH THAT'S TALKING LOUD - YOU'RE JUST A MOUTH TALKING!

KARMA... KARMA... KARMA! Look how far that pendulum's swung now BITCH...
