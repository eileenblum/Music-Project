LATE AT NIGHT I WATCH AS THE SUN COMES UP - THE BREAK OF DAY IS NOT ENOUGH, WAS I REALLY DEAD?!
AND I REMEMBER HOW I FELT THIS TIME LAST YEAR - WONDER WILL IT DISAPPEAR SOMETHINGS GOTTA GIVE...

[Chorus:]
NEVER LET GO OF THAT FIERY SADNESS, THROAT FULL OF HEART - MOUTH OF MADNESS!
BY MISTAKE I SWALLOW ANOTHER PILL - BITTERSWEET IS SUCH A THRILL - TRY TO FEEL ALIVE!
AND I FORGET ALL THE PAIN JUST GOES AWAY - WISH THAT I COULD SLEEP ALL DAY DISCONNECT MYSELF...

[Chorus]
IS IT BETTER TO DEFEAT THIS MONSTER - BE SECURE IN THE SILENCE OR TO BE DEVOURED, DEVOURED?!
AND WHEN I STAND BEFORE YOU AT THE END OF THIS...
WILL I HAVE ENOUGH GUTS TO LOVE THOSE LITTLE SLICES OF MY DEATH?!
NEVER LET OF THAT FIERY SADNESS... NEVER LET GO OF THAT FIERY SADNESS!

And I would rather have eyes that can't see, ears that cant hear -
lips that can't speak... than a heart which no longer can beat...
this strange melancholy pervades me at which I hesitate to give the grave and that beautiful name of... MY LIFE!

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCARS - THE WAY OUT IS THROUGH THE WOUND
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCARS - THE WAY OUT IS THROUGH THE WOUND

Courage doesn't always roar, sometimes courage is that little voice at the end of the day that says...
I'LL TRY AGAIN TOMORROW...
