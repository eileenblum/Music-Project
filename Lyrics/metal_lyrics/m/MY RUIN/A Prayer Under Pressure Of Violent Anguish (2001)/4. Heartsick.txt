Late night catechism speaks me to sleep
A lethal dose of narcissism conquers the beast
I can't remember how I got my last scar
THE BIBLE TELLS US JESUS...
WAS A ROCKSTAR

A PRAYER UNDER PRESSURE
Of violent ANGUISH
A PRAYER UNDER PRESSURE
Of violent ANGUISH...

Early mourning exorcisms keep me awake
Seven stars surround me as I burn like a saint
I can't remember why my knees are so sore
THE BIBLE TELLS US MARY...
WAS A WHORE

A PRAYER UNDER PRESSURE
Of violent ANGUISH
A PRAYER UNDER PRESSURE
Of violent ANGUISH...

There once was a GIRL and she SUFFERED from sickness
MOUTH was DISTORTED from RAZOR SHARP KISSES
TRIED to PRETEND it was all in her MIND
But I KNOW her VOICE...when I hear MINE
GOD are you listening? I hear you in my room
As hot as the MOON on the TENTH day of JUNE
There's no sleeping for me, I'm LOOSING MY FAITH
LOVE is not safe in a WORLD filled with HATE

HEART SICK
I'M SICK
Still SICK
MY HEART IS SICK
