THE WAGES OF SIN
HOLD MY HEART HOSTAGE
MY MOUTH IS STILL CRUEL
MY SKIN IS IN BONDAGE
MY BODY IS SCARRED
 I'VE CARVED
BRUISES I'VE HEALED
LIPS THAT I'VE STARVED
WOUNDS I'VE REPLACED
WITH LOVE AND WITH HATE
THE TRUTH SET ME FREE
BUT MY FAITH WAS RAPED
I'VE BROKEN MY SILENCE
LIED TO MYSELF
SPOKEN IN VIOLENCE
BEEN SOMEONE ELSE
SCREAMED AT MY DEMONS
PRAYED TO MY GOD
BEGGED FOR FORGIVENESS
MY HANDS ARE STILL HOT
