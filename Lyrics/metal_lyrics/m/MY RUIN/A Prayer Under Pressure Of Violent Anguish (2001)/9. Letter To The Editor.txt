You believe everything you read
You believe everything you read
You believe everything you read
I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT THE FUCK I READ...
SCREAM...words that I believe
FRIENDS...became my enemies
THINK... think before you speak
DON'T...think you know me

My heart is an EMPTY hole
HANDS WANNA WRAP AROUND YOUR THROAT
Legs BRUISE everywhere you walk
Mouth SPITS all the SHIT you talk

My heart is an EMPTY hole
HANDS WANNA WRAP AROUND YOUR THROAT
Legs BRUISE everywhere you walk
Mouth SPITS all the SHIT you talk

KEEP TALKING
KEEP TALKING
KEEP TALKING
KEEP TALKING...

FIGHT... say what's on my mind
LIES...words you hide behind
BE...careful what you say
STAY ...stay the fuck away

My heart is an EMPTY hole
HANDS WANNA WRAP AROUND YOUR THROAT
Legs BRUISE everywhere you walk
Mouth SPITS all the SHIT you talk
My heart is an EMPTY hole
HANDS WANNA WRAP AROUND YOUR THROAT
Legs BRUISE everywhere you walk
Mouth SPITS all the SHIT you talk
KEEP TALKING...

[repeat chorus twice]

KEEP TALKING

KEEP TALKING

KEEP... TALKING

IN A WORLD OF LIES
I find myself ADVISED
To just PRETEND I'M NICE
And NOT to SAY WHAT'S ON MY MIND
But in A WORLD OF SHIT
I THINK YOU'RE JUST A BITCH
Who couldn't FUCK or SUCK MY DICK
Cause I'M A CHICK
Don't even think I GIVE A DAMN
I SAY THESE THINGS BECAUSE I CAN...

HONESTY IS THE HOLIEST DISEASE

HONESTY IS THE HOLIEST DISEASE

HONESTY IS THE HOLIEST DISEASE

HONESTY IS THE HOLIEST DISEASE
Honesty
Honesty
Honesty
Honesty

Honesty
