Do you love me? Do you love me?

He found me on the night of fire and noise
Wild bells from rang the wild sky
I knew from that moment on
That i would love him till the day that I died
And he kissed away a thousand tears
His lady of her Various Sorrows
Some begged, some borrowed, some stolen
Some kept safe for tomorrow
On an endless night, the silver star spangled
And the bells from the chapel went jingle-jangle
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Like I love you?
He was given to me to put things right
And I stacked all my accomplishments beside him
In a city so obsolete and small
I found God and all His devils inside him
In my bed he cast the blizzard out
A mock sun blazed upon his head
So completely filled with light he was
His shadow fanged and hairy and mad
Our love-lines grew hopelessly tangled
And the bells from the chapel went jingle-jangle
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Like I love you?
All things move toward their end
I knew before I met him that I would lose him
I swear I made every effort to be good to him
I made every effort not to abuse him
Tattoos from his wrists to his ankles
And the bells from the chapel go jingle-jangle

jingle-jangle jingle-jangle

jingle-jangle
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?

Do you love me? Do you love me?

Do you love me? Do you love me?

Do you love me? Do you love me?

Do you love me? Do you love me?

Do you love me? Do you love me?

Do you love me? Do you love me?

DO YOU LOVE ME? Like I love you?
