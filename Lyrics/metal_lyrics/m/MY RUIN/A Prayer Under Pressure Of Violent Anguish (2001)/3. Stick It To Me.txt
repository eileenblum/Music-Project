It doesn't matter what I SAY
Doesn't matter what I DO
I DON'T REALLY GIVE A FUCK
About you
Nowadays it's all FAKE
Put some MAKE UP ON YOUR FACE
Lookin like a FUCKING chick
In LIPSTICK
There is nothing here for me
DRESSED UP in your NEW DISEASE
HOLLYWOOD is FULL OF SHIT
DON'T ASK ME TO SELL MY SOUL
I would rather be myself
You...DO WHAT YOU'RE TOLD!

STICK IT TO ME
I know you want to
STICK IT IN ME
You know you're going to
STICK IT TO ME
I know you want to
STICK IT IN ME
You know you're going to

take a picture if you need
WHILE I BLEED
What makes you think...
THAT YOU KNOW ME
Dinner and an INTERVIEW
But I'm not a fan you
At least ... I tell the TRUTH...
Damned if I DO, damned if I DON'T
Damned if I WILL ..... if I WON'T
STAB ME IN THE BACK
And buy me one more DRINK
SUCK MY TRUST until I'm FUCKED
THEN YOU CAN SAY YOU FUCKED ME!

STICK IT TO ME
I know you want to
STICK IT IN ME
You know you're going to
STICK IT TO ME
I know you want to
STICK IT IN ME
You know you're going to

you're so SNEAKY
with your surprises
you're so SWEET
Underneath disguises
I can't wait
FOR YOU TO CRITICIZE THIS
Don't think I don't
KNOW HOW BIG YOUR KNIFE IS

Stick it in me
I KNOW YOU WANT TO
Stick it to me
YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO
Stick it in me
I KNOW YOU WANT TO
Stick it to me
YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO...

You don't know me like I know myself
AND I WILL NEVER TELL
you don't know me like I know myself
YOU CAN GO STRAIGHT TO HELL!

(I saw a scary monster)
