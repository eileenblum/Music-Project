Last night I had a dream
I was drowning again
You grabbed my hand and pulled me to safety
As I looked into your eyes
I saw my saviour
The person that I knew had been there all along
Just waiting for the chance to kill me
We kissed and my mouth started to bleed
Then all my teeth fell out...
I hate it when that happens
