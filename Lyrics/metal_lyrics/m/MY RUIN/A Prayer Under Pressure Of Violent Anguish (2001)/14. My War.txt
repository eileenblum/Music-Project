MY WAR!

You're one of them
You said you're my friend
But you're one of them
You don't want to see me live
You don't want me to give
YOU'RE ONE OF THEM

MY WAR!
You're one of them
You said you're my friend
But you're one of THEM,

THEM, THEM, THEM, YEAH!

WAR! You're one of them

You said you're my friend but

you're one of THEM!
I might not know what a friend is
All i know is what you're not
YOU'RE ONE OF THEM!

MY WAR!
You're one of them
You said you're my friend
But YOU'RE ONE OF THEM - YEAH!

Yeah... YEAH!

You bitch! I'm talking to you!

YEAH YOU KNOW WHO THE FUCK

I'M TALKING TO!

CALL YOURSELF MY FRIEND?

FUCK YOU! I'VE GOT BETTER

ENEMIES THAN YOU!

And this is my war baby
Go home.
Get the fuck outta here...
