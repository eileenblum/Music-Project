I like the way you make me feel
SYRUPY AND CLEAN
You have a STRANGE EFFECT on me
LOVING EVERY SCREAM
BAPTIZE this thing that burns
EVERYTIME YOU BATH ME
If I confess too many sins
WILL YOU STILL SAVE ME?

RAIN
RAIN
RAIN
LET IT RAIN

AS BEAUTIFUL AS A SCAR
There's NOTHING quite like you
I CUT MYSELF on your lips
LET YOU LICK MY WOUNDS
So SOUTHERN is my SAVIOUR
So SICK inside my head
But if I let you RESCUE me
WILL I BE LEFT FOR DEAD?

RAIN
RAIN
RAIN
LET IT RAIN

Let it rain
DOWN ON ME
Let it rain
DOWN ON US
Let it rain
DOWN ON ME

LET IT RAIN
LET IT...RAIN!!!

The sky's illumination comes from the city below
And I can taste every inch of your kiss
Every inch of your soul from over here
Do you feel FAITH or do you feel FEAR?
