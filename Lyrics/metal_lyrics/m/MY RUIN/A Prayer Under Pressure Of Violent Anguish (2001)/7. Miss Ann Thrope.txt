You're so PRETTY when you lie
LOVESONGS always make me cry
I don't think you have a choice
THERE'S NO TRUTH LEFT IN YOUR VOICE
Remember when we used to laugh
Just try to FORGET all that
Wear my HEART upon your lips
I HOPE IT TASTES JUST LIKE SHIT!

Just call me
MISS ANN THROPE
Just call me
MISS ANN THROPE

You're so PRETTY when you die
LOVESONGS always make me cry
I don't think you realize
THERE'S NO BLUE LEFT IN YOUR EYES
Remember when we used to sing
Just try to FORGET those things
Fill your HOLE inside with dirt
I HOPE THAT IT FUCKING HURTS!

Just call me
MISS ANN THROPE
Just call me
MISS ANN THROPE
Just call me
MISS ANN THROPE
Just call me
MISS ANN THROPE

YOU have left a trail of DECEIT
ASSAULT AND FLATTERY
BLASTING through my WOUNDS
IMPRISONED ME
In GOD and POETRY
A RITUAL TO MEND MY
ANGRY HEART
A breeding ground for your UNTRUTH
IF GOD CREATED MAN in his
OWN IMAGE
Then FUCK YOU...

ASHES TO ASHES
Dust to dust
MY HATE FOR YOU
Defines my lust
BRIDGES TO BRIDGES
You're nothing to me
WELCOME WORLD
Miss Ann Thrope

ASHES TO ASHES
Dust to dust
MY HATE FOR YOU
Defines my lust
BRIDGES TO BRIDGES
You're nothing to me
WELCOME WORLD
Miss Ann Thrope

FUCK
Cunt
MISS ANN THROPE
Cunt
FUCK
MISS ANN THROPE
