(This girl is harder than all you motherfuckers out there alright, just so we get that one thing perfectly clear!)

I feel
The skies open wide
SEE YOUR BLUE EYES
When worlds collide
You're by my side
It's hard to lie
Sometimes
I've CRIED...
Wished it was me
WISHED IT WAS ME WHO DIED...

I can see you in the sunshine
I FEEL YOU WHERE I STAND
I can see you in the bright lights
I FEEL YOU HOLD MY HAND
Let your light surround me
IN LOVING MEMORY
Let your love surround me
SHINE DOWN ON ME
SHINE ON ME

Something...so deep inside me
BINDS ME WITH YOU...
Told me a secret
Swore that I'd keep it
Someday MY FRIEND
We'll meet again
So until then...
I'LL KEEP OUR SECRET SAFE

I can see you in the moonlight
I FEEL YOU WHEN I SLEEP
I can see you on those dark nights
I FEEL YOUR ARMS AROUND ME
Let your light surround me
IN LOVING MEMORY
Let your love surround me
SHINE DOWN ON ME
SHINE ON ME

ROCKSTAR...

we will always be bound
WE WILL ALWAYS BE DOWN
we will always be bound
WE WILL ALWAYS BE DOWN

I FEEL YOU WHEN I SCREAM YOUR WORDS
I AM JUST A GIRL THAT HURTS
FEEL ME WHEN I SCREAM THESE WORDS
I AM JUST A GIRL THAT HURTS
I FEEL YOU WHEN I SCREAM YOUR WORDS
I AM JUST A GIRL THAT HURTS
Feel me when I scream these words
I am just a girl that hurts...
I am just a girl that hurts
I am just a girl that hurts
I am just a girl that hurts
I am just a girl
THAT HURTS
