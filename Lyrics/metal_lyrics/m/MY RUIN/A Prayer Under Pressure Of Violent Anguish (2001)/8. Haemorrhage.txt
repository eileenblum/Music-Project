I STICK MY FINGER DOWN
YOUR THORAT
Explore my THOUGHTS OF MURDER
A journey through the HUMAN heart
Dark places filled with TERROR
OBSESSION lets me have my way
DEVOTION makes you stay
This mercy seat YOU IMITATE
Won't let you get away

IN PRAISE OF HIM I pray
IN PRAISE OF HIM I save
IN PRAISE OF HIM I give
MYSELF AWAY...

Come KISS away my HONESTY
EXPLOIT ME WITH YOUR PAIN
Learn to LOVE THIS MONSTER
You CREATED in your name
CONFESSION lets you face your fear
REDEMPTION leaves a stain
The THOUGHT of me MAKES YOU SO SICK
There's nothing left to hate

IN PRAISE OF HIM I pray...
IN PRAISE OF HIM I save
IN PRAISE OF HIM I give
MYSELF AWAY again
IN PRAISE OF HIM I've prayed
IN PRAISE OF HIM I'm saved
IN PRAISE OF HIM I gave
MYSELF AWAY..

A DIFFERENT SORT OF SUFFERING
I practice what I PREACH
AROMATHEREPUTIC death
Can you SMELL me SPEAK
If VIOLENCE IS RELIGION
Then everyone's a STAR
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU'VE DONE
Only who you are
WHO YOU ARE
Who you are yeah yeah...
Underneath
THE HOLLYWOOD CROSS
Underneath this HOLY wood cross
MY LOVER LET ME TIE YOU DOWN
Hold your HEART my HOSTAGE
I PROMISE after I am THROUGH
YOUR SKIN WILL STILL
TASTE SALTED
MY MOUTH is not your ENEMY
MY LIPS are not you FRIEND
If we were still together
I WOULD TORTURE YOU AGAIN

IN PRAISE OF HIM I pray
IN PRAISE OF HIM I save
IN PRAISE OF HIM I give...
MYSELF AWAY...
IN PRAISE OF HIM I've prayed
IN PRAISE OF HIM I'm saved
IN PRAISE OF HIM I hate
MYSELF TODAY

YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT
YOU WILL FIND
UNTIL YOU LOOK INSIDE
I NEVER KNEW WHAT I
WOULD FIND
AND THEN I LOOKED
INSIDE...
Let me TORTURE you again
TORTURE you my friend
Let me TORTURE you again
TORTURE you my friend
Let me TORTURE you again
Like you TORTURE me my friend
Let me TORTURE you again
TORTURE you my friend
IT NEVER ENDS...
