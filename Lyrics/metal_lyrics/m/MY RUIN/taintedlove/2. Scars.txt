I have SCARS on my body
From using myself... ABUSING myself...
In SICKNESS and in HEALTH
I have BRUISES on my body which go away with TIME
But remain in my MIND FOREVER as a constant reminder
Of the last MAN I LOVED... LOATHED... LEFT...
I have the word TRUTH on my arm
Because there is no room for HONESTY when you're a LIAR
I have a TATTOO on the back of my neck
Which I cannot SEE but I can FEEL... that I can FEEL
That I can...
I have a TATTOO on my stomach which is ITALIAN -
means THE SWEET LIFE
I have the word LOVE in FLAMES surrounded by STARS
On my right wrist because these five fingers
go straight to the SOUL of man
I have the word HATE on my left wrist
because the left hand is the hand of HATE
And it's with this hand that Cain knifed his brother
I'm RIGHT HANDED maybe that's my PROBLEM...
and MY RUIN.

Thanks to cryptid_beastie for sending track #2 lyrics.
