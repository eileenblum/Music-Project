We fall into hell and feel the slow burn all over us
Intoxicated by the sound darkness covers us
Deep inside the abyss with voices in the air
Crimson skies open wide while sunlight says a prayer

The pain inside is hard to hide
Our scars are sung in lullabies
Sung in lullabiesâ¦at night

We start to dream and the wind begins to follow us
Now every wall in our room just wants to swallow us
Underneath I breathe a sigh of relief
Turn the volume to ten just to hear myself scream

The pain inside is hard to hide
Our scars are sung in lullabies
Sung in lullabiesâ¦at night

I lose myself in the chaos that comes with the day
Collaborate on the clouds so I can feel safe

The music comes to me just like a friend and comforts me
A guilty conscious will confess while words are haunting me

The pain inside is hard to hide
Our scars are sung in lullabies
Sung in lullabies

We store the honey of our human souls inside our tears
Gathered on wings of misery we let go of our fears

We choose to let our moods create our escape
Turn off the world and now weâre floating in space
