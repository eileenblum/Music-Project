Still feel the pretty poison
That's coursing through your veins
Your silent analogue heart
No longer beats but it remains
A hard reminder of your past
Distant memory
An unapologetic thief
Transformed herself into Del Riche
Del Riche

Complicated identity
But I remember who you used to be

The fallacy whereby a goose
Believes that sheâs a swan
Pretend youâre someone else
But all your character is gone
A work in progress to erase
Traces of your fame
True metamorphosis
Is more than just changing your name
Del Riche

Complicated identity
But I remember who you used to be

Beauty is only skin deep but ugly goes clean to the bone
The human heart feels things the eyes cannot see alone

Complicated identity
But I remember who you used to be

The vultures they still circle within the words I wrote
Your skeletons have not grown skin but there is alwaysâ¦hope
