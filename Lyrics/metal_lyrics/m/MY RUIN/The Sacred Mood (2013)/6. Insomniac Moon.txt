Winter seems so far awayâ¦

I open my mouth and I can taste the heat of the South
Baptized in Whisky I worship the sound
Thick like clouds under the Tennessee sky, damned and divine
Every summer has a story and this one is mine
The high priestess of prophecy
I preach my sermons to the cicadas in the trees
Heavy with the holiness of his riffs
I bleed

The Southern sun will light the room
With secrets of the moonâ¦secrets of the moon
I close my eyes and come alive
Inside the sacred moodâ¦.the sacred mood

Night falls and the fireflies surround me like rain
I can hear the distant thunder of August immaculate in its pain
This is the ballad of a blasphemous girl
The lament of an insomniac, a dirge for the sacrosanct
Doomed with the rumble of the deep
I pray my soul will continue to speak
As the low end strangles me

The Southern sun will light the room
With secrets of the moonâ¦secrets of the moon
I close my eyes and come alive
Inside the sacred moodâ¦the sacred mood

The Southern sun will light the room
With secrets of the moonâ¦secrets of the moon
I close my eyes and come alive
Inside the sacred moodâ¦the sacred mood

Beauty for some provides an escape
For others, an exquisite dying
