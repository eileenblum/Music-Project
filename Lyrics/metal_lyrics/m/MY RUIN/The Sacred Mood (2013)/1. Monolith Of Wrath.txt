Sun crashes through my window
Moon falls asleep in my bed
Wide awake Iâm filled with violence
Of the voices in my head
So eloquent they speak to me
I feel the madness rise
One pill to numb this pounding
Another pill to close my eyes

Moonless midnight of my mind
Moonless midnight of myâ¦.

Old wounds will always haunt me
Time has a way with words
One pill to numb this feeling
Another pill to calm my nerves

Moonless midnight of my mind
Moonless midnight of myâ¦
Of my mindâ¦Of my mindâ¦
The moonless midnight of my mind

Esoteric dissonance
The soothing sound of silence
But once the heavy starts to hit
Feel the wrath of the monolith

Moonless midnight of my mind
Moonless midnightâ¦

Blue skies are sacrificed
Let the witching hour come
One pill to numb this pressure
Another pill to kill the sun
