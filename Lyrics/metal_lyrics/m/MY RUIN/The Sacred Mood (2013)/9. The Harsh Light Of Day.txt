Shut the drapes and the world drops dead
Sometimes itâs nice to forget
Why suffer from another sunrise
Dying is an art like everything else

So heavy is my heart
So dead in comfort I am numb
The luxury of sleep eludes me

Close my eyes and the room turns red
Sometimes itâs nice to pretend
Why bother with another sunset
Dying is an art like everything else

So heavy is my heart
So dead in comfort I am numb
The luxury of sleep eludes me
Just one more pill to take
And maybe I wonât recognize
The harsh light of day

These are my hands - my knees - my scars

Oh Lady Lazarus
Come and speak to me
Dark side of happy is despair
Oh Spirits of the night
Forgive my restless mind
From ashes I will rise and eat my enemies like air

Just one more pill to take
And maybe I wonât recognize
The harsh light of day
