Life and death and time remind us
Leave the dust of past behind us
Mourn the memories of our mistakes
Take our secrets to the grave

Blessed is the beast that rises
From the ashes of our vices
Warnings that must be conveyed
Truth is not in being saved

Like a phoenix on the bone - In death we are reborn
Feel the fire burn and scorn - Moriendo Renascor
Like a phoenix on the bone - In death we are reborn
Feel the fire burn and scorn - Moriendo Renascor

In this garden filled with earthly vanities temptation lies
Divine salvation only comes to those who die

Spirits come and give us light
Haunting hearts as black as night
When the skies turn dark and grey
The dead will have their way

Like a phoenix on the bone - In death we are reborn
Feel the fire burn and scorn - Moriendo Renascor
Like a phoenix on the bone - In death we are reborn
Feel the fire burn and scorn - Moriendo Renascor

This too shall pass so come what may
Your tomorrow is today
Each night I go to sleep and mourn
When I wake I am reborn
