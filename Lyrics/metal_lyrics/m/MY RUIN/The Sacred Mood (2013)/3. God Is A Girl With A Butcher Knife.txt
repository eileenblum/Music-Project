Red are the lips with a tongue so sharp
Kiss her mouth and cut out her heart
I can feel the heat from the sun I scorn
The sicken of the calm who know the storm

Suffer - Love her

Death is the veil which those who live call life
They sleep and itâs lifted
God is a girl with butcher knifeâ¦A butcher knife

Black is the hair with the skin so white
Drown her sins in the pale moonlight
I can feel the earth bleed beneath my feet
The strength of the dirt where the flesh is weak

Suffer - Lover

Death is the veil which those who live call life
They sleep and itâs lifted
God is a girl with butcher knife

Music, when harsh voices die
Vibrates in the memory
And so will thoughts when thou art is gone
My words shall live onâ¦

Death is the veil which those who live call life
They sleep and itâs lifted
God is a girl with butcher knife

The mistress of the verbal hand grenade be my muse
The good book speaks to those who seek the truth
But whereâs the proof?
An eye for an eye
A tooth for a tooth
