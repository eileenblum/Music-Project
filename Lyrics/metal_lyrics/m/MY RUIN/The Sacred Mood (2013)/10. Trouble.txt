[originally by Elvis Presley]If you're looking for trouble
You came to the right place
If you're looking for trouble
Just look right in my face
I was born standing up
And talking back
My daddy was a green-eyed mountain jack

Cause I'm evilâ¦my middle name is miseryâ¦yeah baby
Well I'm evilâ¦So don't you mess around with me

I've never looked for trouble
But I've never ran
I don't take no orders
From no kind of man
I'm only made out
Of flesh, blood and bone
But if you're gonna start a rumble don't you try it all alone

Cause I'm evilâ¦my middle name is misery
Yeah babyâ¦ thatâs what I saidâ¦
Well I'm evilâ¦ so don't you mess around with me

I'm evil, evil, evil, as can beâ¦
I'm evil, evil, evil, as can be
So don't mess around donât, don't mess around with me

I'm evilâ¦ I'm evilâ¦ evilâ¦ evilâ¦
So don't mess around, don't mess around with me
I'm evilâ¦evilâ¦
So don't mess around with me
Yeah!
