Well I know you're the money honey don't tell ME,
If you get it here in ten you'll get it for FREE...
And we can give it a floor run, see if it plays...
'cause you're a tall drink of water baby, you're so made!
This is how I do ah... THIS IS HOW I DO!

[Chorus:]
This is how I do
I'll do it all night long yeah,
This is how I do
It just like VINCE VAUGHN!

Well it's so fucking on when you flash that smile...
Common let's party California gangster style!
A little bit of the shh... little bit of the bad...
I know your name ain't cowboy baby - I'M SO GLAD!
This is how I do ah... this is how I do ah... this is how I do ah...
THIS IS HOW I DO!

[Chorus:]
This is how I do
I'll do it all night long SHIT!
Let me see you do it honey... COME ON!

A little bit of the shh... a little bit of the bad, bad!
A little bit of the shh... a little bit of the bad, bad!

Vagas baby vagas, yeah yeah!
Let me see you shake it HELL YEAH!
Vagas baby vagas, yeah yeah!
Let me see you shake it HELL YEAH,
HELL YEAH, HELL MOTHERFUCKING YES!

(Here's 50 bucks, in case I call you a BITCH later!)
