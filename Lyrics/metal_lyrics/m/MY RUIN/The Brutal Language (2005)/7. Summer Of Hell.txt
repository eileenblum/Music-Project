Please, please forgive me - there was no way I could go...
I drown my sorrows underwater - IN THE SNOW!
AND I'M TIRED OF LYING!
I'M TRIED OF TRYING!
I'M TIRED OF LIVING!
I FEEL LIKE I'M DYING!

[Chorus:]
IN MY SUMMER OF HELL I SWEAR I WON'T TELL IN MY SUMMER OF HELL I SWEAR I WONT TELL!
I WON'T TELL!
I WON'T TELL!
I WON'T TELL YOU!

Please don't you worry, there is so much I can't say...
I numb my body in the morning - YESTERDAY!
AND I'M TIRED OF LYING!
I'M TIRED OF TRYING!
I'M TIRED OF LIVING!
I FEEL LIKE I'M DYING!

[Chorus]

HEY THIS IS YOUR DAY - CONGRATULATIONS!
THESE ARE THE LAST DAYS - CONSPIRACY THEORIES!
HEY THIS IS MY DAY - CONGRATULATE ME!
THESE ARE THE NEW DAYS OF DEATH (and romance)
