IN THE SUNSHINE OF AN OTHERWISE CLOUDY DAY, DO YOU BELIEVE IN FATE...
COME WHAT MAY?
I'VE BEEN HEAVY AND I'VE BEEN LIGHT, I'VE BEEN THE ONE STAYIN UP ALL NIGHT...
I'VE BEEN LOW AND I'VE BEEN HIGH...
BEEN THE FIRST TO TRY

[Chorus (x2):]
AND I KNOW MY DARK COLD HANDS, WARM HEART SAVE ME FROM MYSELF!

IN THE DARKNESS OF AN OTHERWISE SUNNY DAY, DO YOU BELIEVE IN FATE, COME WHAT MAY?
I'VE BEEN STRONG AND I'VE BEEN WEAK, I'VE BEEN THE ONE UNAFRAID TO SPEAK...
I'VE BEEN WRONG AND I'VE BEEN RIGHT...
BEEN THE FIRST TO FIGHT!

[Chorus]

When I die, bury me underneath the weeping tree...
And when I rise... carry me to the hills - FOR ALL TO SEE!

MY LIFE - THE BRUTAL LANGUAGE OF BEING IN LOVE!
WHY LIE - THE BRUTAL LANGUAGE OF BEING IN
MY LIFE - THE BRUTAL LANGUAGE OF BEING IN LOVE!
WHY LIE... THE BRUTAL LANGUAGE OF BEING IN LOVE!
