It takes a lot to get me down when I'M HIGH...
I know you're no FRIEND of MINE!
I can see the DEVIL in your EYES - look at me I'm Jesus Christ!
All alone so THROW YOUR STONES at my words and lovely BONES...
Blood that's red, a mouth that's MEAN - RAISE YOUR FUCKING HANDS WITH ME!

FORGIVE!
I HAVE SINNED!
Believe...
I'll do it again.

Well I've been down this road BEFORE and every TIME...
You never change your MIND
You see me in black and white - nailed to the cross and CRUCIFIED!
LOOK around me, smell the FLIES...
Judas filling me with LIES...
But I don't HIDE the blood I BLEED - RAISE YOUR FUCKING HANDS WITH ME!

FORGIVE!
I HAVE SINNED!
Believe...
I'll do it again.

WALK WITH ME THROUGH THE VALLEY, FEAR NO EVIL!
WALK WITH ME - I'M THE BADDEST MOTHERFUCKER IN THE VALLEY!
With all of your QUESTIONS... and words in your HEAD...
You went searching for GOD...
Met the devil INSTEAD!
WALK WITH ME THROUGH THE VALLEY, FEAR NO EVIL!
WALK WITH ME - HONESTY IS THE HOLIEST DISEASE!
