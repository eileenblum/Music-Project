The forecast said it would be sunny
I guess they got it WRONG
It's raining again in silverlake and I need to hear MY SONG
The one that puts me in the MOOD to SPILL MY GUTS and TALK TO YOU saves me from my self-infected drama when I do oh! -
You're ASLEEP right now but I'm sill wide AWAKE
It's hard for me to close my EYES without no pill to TAKE...
I think of all the times I've tried, the night I've dreamed I've DIED...
Help me feel alive again cause I'm so DEAD INSIDE! well...

[Chorus:]
I'M A LIAR AND YOU'RE A SAINT - FEELS SO GOOD BEING THE ONE THEY HATE!
AND I'M A SINNER SO LET'S ALL PRAY - I WOULDN'T WANT IT ANY OTHER WAY!

Well have you heard the news I've got a blue bruise on my hip
The truth can be a brutal business I just need a KISS someone to take my wrist I think that I'm about to BLEED...
But I know it's not up to you to give me what I NEED...
Oh! you're awake right now so I must be ASLEEP...
It seems I've got a secret that I ain't afraid to KEEP...
I think of all the TIMES I've TRIED to tell you how I FEEL...
But it's so hard to mend my parts that just refuse to HEAL!
Well...

[Chorus]

Take me back, let's go back - it's so dark here - it's so BLACK...
Exouisile with stillness the fragrance of FLESH...
Taste of revenge and my WOUNDS are still FRESH!
Now here she comes with her BLOODY RED LIPS...
Funeral white skin and her generous HIPS...
Drenched in the scent of romance like no other
She's so filthy gorgeous that DEATH HAS BECOME HER!

[Chorus x2]
