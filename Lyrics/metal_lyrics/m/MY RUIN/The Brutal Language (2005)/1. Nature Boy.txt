There was a boy, a very strange enchanted boy...
They say he wandered very far - very far over land and sea.
A little shy and sad of eye but very wise was he.
And then one day - a magic day he passed my way and while we spoke of many things, fools and kings, this he said to me -
"The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return..."
