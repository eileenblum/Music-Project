I was born like this with hips like this
Lips like this and wrists like this
legs like this and arms like this
a fist like this to hit you with, now
you're like school on Sunday
You ain't got no class
You keep running your mouth but...
You can kiss my ...

Not made to measure baby
One size does not fit all
I will not be the one
You make to take the fall
[repeat]

I got the curves to fear, the words to feel
When I scream I've heard them say
I've got the voice to heal
You don't need to be sorry
you don't need to be saved
You just need to be proud of the body that God gave

Not made to measure baby
One size does not fit all
I will not be the one
You make to take the fall
[repeat]

listen to me say...yeah

I'm so fat I'm ... up
I'm so skinny I'm sick
I'm tired of the magazines
Talking that bull...!
I'm not fat, you're ... up
I'm not skinny, you're sick
I'm just tired of the critics who keep talking that bull...

Yeah!

I was born like this with eyes like this
Teeth like this and thighs like this
A face like this, a waist like this
and when I die...I'll die like this...now
You're like school on Sunday
You ain't got no class
You keep running your mouth but
I just might kick some ...!

Not made to measure baby
One size does not fit all
I will not be the one
You make to take the fall
[repeat]

Let me hear you say YEAH!
You're so fat you're ... up
You're so skinny you're sick
You're so tired of the magazines
Talking that bull...!
You're not fat or ... up
You're not skinny or sick
You're just tired of the critics who keep talking that bull...

NOW WHAT?-NOW WHAT?-NOW WHAT? What you gonna say next time you SEE US?
NOW WHAT?-NOW WHAT?-NOW WHAT? What you gonna say next time you SEE ME?
