LIE!

You've got the BLOOD on your HANDS
And got no RIGHT to BLEED
Your innocence makes me LAUGH
I don't have what you NEED
You search for the solution - I know you'll never FIND
Your faith has left you with an IMITATION OF CHRIST!

[Chorus:]
GROTESQUE - THE LOWEST - COMMON INNOMINATOR!
GROTESQUE - THE LOWEST - COMMON INNOMINATOR!

The spirit takes hold of your BODY and you CRY OUT
Throwen into convulsions you're FOAMING at the MOUTH!
Searching for something SACRED you LOOK
but all you FIND is just an imitation
your GOD has left BEHIND!

[Chorus]

Transending the temple all around -
Thou shalt not bear witness to those who call themselves poets -
Or worship false idols -
Never worship FALSE idols...

[Chorus]

WHAT ELSE COULD SHE DO TO OPEN THEIR EYES?
THE BLIND SHALL SEE...
THE DEAD SHALL HEAR...
THE DEAD SHALL RISE! WHAT?!
