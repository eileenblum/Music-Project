Dear "Mr"...
"Your Name Here"
Don't think we'll forget
How you just managed to...
Be so full of... SHIT!
It's just another day in L.A.
Just another day... so I'll say...
Its just another day in L.A.
Hollywood IS SO... FAKE!

Tell us lies... we believe you
Close our eyes... we won't see you
Take our lives... if you need to
Suck us dry... let us feed you

"Daddy" Dearest...
With "Your Band"
You really had us fooled
But you proved that with a doubt...
Bitches rule the... WORLD!
It's just another day in L.A.
It's just another day... so I'll say...
It's just another day in L.A.
Hollywood is so... FAKE

Tell us lies... we believe you
Close our eyes... we won't see you
Take our lives... if you need to
Suck us dry... let us feed you

Bury us in all you fabricated little schemes
Calculated to be nothing like what it all seems
Slander everything we stand for
We won't compromise
And we promise that this revolution...
Won't be televised

Why.... Would You....
Pretend to be on our side then publicize your lies
When we learned the truth
Then we were forced to recognize
It's just another day in L.A.
It's just another day... so I'll say...
It's just another day in L.A.

Hollywood is so... FAKE

Tell us lies... we believe you
Close our eyes... we won't see you
Take our lives... if you need to
Suck us dry... let us feed you
Let us feed you
Let us feed you
