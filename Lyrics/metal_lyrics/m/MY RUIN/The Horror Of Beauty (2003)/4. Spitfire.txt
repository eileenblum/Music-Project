I put my trust in you
And you betrayed me
Took what I gave you
And fucking raped me
But you can't kill me...
It's not that easy
I'm still standing
Still breathing!

Spitfire
Spite hate
Spit all the shit you talk
Right back in your face
I spit liars
Spit names
Spit truth and my song remains the same!

I gave you faith
When none believed you
Barely escaped....
But who deceived who?
You tried to guilt me
With things you'd tell me...
You didn't build me
You can't sell me

Spitfire
Spite hate
Spit all the shit you talk
Right back in your face
I spit liars
Spit names
Spit truth and my song remains the same!

SMALL MAN-BIG MOUTH
SMALL MAN-BIG MOUTH
Yeah

Fuck your label!

Spitfire
Spite hate
Spit all the shit you talk
Right back in your face
I spit liars
Spit fakes
Spit truth and the war remains the same!

SMALL MAN-BIG MOUTH... MISGYNISTIC!
SMALL MAN-BIG MOUTH... CHAUVINISTIC!
SMALL MAN-BIG MOUTH
SMALL MAN-BIG MOUTH
You.......... SUCK
