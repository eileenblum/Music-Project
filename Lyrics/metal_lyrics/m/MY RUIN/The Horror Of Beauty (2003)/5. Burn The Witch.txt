I see her coming
Filled in her disease
Don't bother runnin'
She sees me
Her smile is thick
So sick there ain't no cure
I never wanna be just like her... no

BURN.... burn
Burn the witch

I watch her leave
Still filled with her disease
Don't give a fuck what she thinks
Her hands are clean
But no one here believes
SO full of shit...
That she stinks....

BURN.... burn
Burn the witch
BURN.... burn
Burn the BITCH

The Antithesis to everything she is
The Enemy, I am her Nemesis
This ugliness will stick and linger...
So I just focus on my middle finger

BURN.... burn
Burn the witch
BURN.... burn
Burn the witch

I see her coming-I see her-I see her
I see her coming-BURN THE WITCH
I see her running-I see her, I see her
I see her running-Burn that witch!
