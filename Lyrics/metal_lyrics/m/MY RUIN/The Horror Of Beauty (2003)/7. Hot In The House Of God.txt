HOT IN THE HOUSE OF... GOD!

With a heavy heart somebody said
Lets go our separate ways
Our relationship is strained
In this the vital stage
There is a lack of confidence
And you can feel our stress
A need for truth
Time to decide
What is and what is not best

FAITH- subject to change... FOR-GIVE-far too late
FATE-end of your game... HOT IN THE HOUSE OF GOD... IRAGE!

With a question left
I will confess
Put my mind
And past to rest
Termination of our trust
Friendships end
And this one must
The time has come
To make our move
And we can see
What we can't prove
The little things
That make no sense
Have all built up
To be immense

FAITH- subject to change... FOR-GIVE-far too late
FATE-end of your game... HOT IN THE HOUSE OF GOD... IRAGE!
FAITH- subject to change... FOR-GIVE-far too late
FATE-end of your game... HOT-IN-THE-HOUSE-OF-GOD

Nothings the same
Everything has changed

FAITH- subject to change... FOR-GIVE-far too late
FATE-end of your game... HOT IN THE HOUSE OF GOD... IRAGE!
FAITH- subject to change... FOR-GIVE-far too late
FATE-end of your game... HOT-IN-THE-HOUSE-OF-GOD!

Nothings the same
Nothings the same
For every minute you spend angry...
You waste 60 seconds of happiness!
