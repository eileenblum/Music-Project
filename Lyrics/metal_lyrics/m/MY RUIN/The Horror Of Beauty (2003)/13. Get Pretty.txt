Pretty girls they make friends
Fake smiles that don't offend
It's not hard to play pretend...
Then again-THEN AGAIN
Ugly girls make enemies
Just go ask the NME
This is what they've said to me
Said to me-SAID TO ME

Pretty girls make friends
Loved by every camera lens
Someday all of this will end
Tell me when-TELL ME WHEN
Ugly girls make enemies
Maybe that's what's wrong with me
If I'm not what you think that I should be...
Then what should I be?
