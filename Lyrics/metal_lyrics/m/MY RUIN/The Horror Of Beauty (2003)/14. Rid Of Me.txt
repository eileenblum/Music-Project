Tie yourself to me....
No one else knows,
You're not rid of me. No, You're not rid of me.
Night and day
I breathe, hah hah hey hey,
You're not rid of me. Yeah, you're not rid of me
You're not rid of me; you're not rid of me
I beg you my, darling,
Don't, leave me, I'm hurting,
Lick my licks, I'm on fire,
Lick my licks of desire,
Lick my licks, I'm on fire,
Lick my licks of desire,
I'll tie your legs, keep you, against my chest,
Oh, you're not rid of me, Yeah, you're not rid of me,
Make you lick my injuries,
I'm gonna twist your head off see,
Make you lick my injuries,
I'm gonna twist your head off see,
Do you see... Don't you wish you, never, never met her,
Don't you, Don't you wish you never, never met her,
Don't you wish you never, never met her.
Don't you wish you never, never met her. I beg you, my darling,
Don't leave me, I'm bleeding,
I'm so lonely, above everything,
Above, everyday I'm hurting,
Lick my licks I'm on fire,
Lick my licks of desire,
Lick my licks, I'm on fire,
Lick my licks of desire,
You're not rid of me, you're not rid of me,
I'll make you lick my injuries,
I'm gonna twist your head off see
I'll make you to lick my injuries,
I'm gonna twist your head off see,
Do you see... Don't you wish you, never, never met her,
Don't you, Don't you wish you, never, never met her,
Don't you, don't you wish you, never, never met her,
Don't you, Don't You wish you, never, never met her,
Don't you, Don't You wish you, never, never met her,
Don't you, Don't You wish you, never, never met her,
Don't you, Don't You wish you, never, never met her,
Don't you, Don't You wish you, never, never met her,
Lick my licks I'm on fire,
Lick my licks of desire,
Lick my licks, I'm on fire,
Lick my licks of desire...
