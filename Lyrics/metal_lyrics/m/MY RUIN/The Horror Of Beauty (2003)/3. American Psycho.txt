This is not an exit!
This is not an exit... I need to feel something
American Psycho my confession means... nothing!

Abandon all hope-ye who enter here
Pre-meditated-calculated
I can smell the fear
Don't try to tell the truth
Just black and blue your eyes
Graphic signs of beauty
I've become what I despise
Leaned into the light
Now I'm crucified
Flesh-Blood-Teeth
NOT LIES!
Later that night
Is how the story goes
Then rewind.. return my videos.
THIS IS NOT AN EXIT
THIS IS NOT AN EXIT... I NEED TO FEEL SOMETHING
AMERICAN PSYCHO MY CONFESSION MEANS
NOTHING... AMERICAN PSYCHO
NOTHING... AMERICAN PSYCHO

This is no attempt to pre-empt my own death
I won't kill myself &amp; I'm not taking requests
The machine has left me scarred
Scared of it's insanity
I've burned to many bridges
To pretend to be Holy
Honesty is ugly
So we don't have a deal
Flesh-blood-tongue
I'M REAL!
Later that night
Is how the story goes
Then rewind.. return my videos.
THIS IS NOT AN EXIT
THIS IS NOT AN EXIT... I NEED TO FEEL SOMETHING
AMERICAN PSYCHO MY CONFESSION MEANS
NOTHING... AMERICAN PSYCHO
NOTHING... AMERICAN PSYCHO

No matter how profane-Sacred or insane
Painfully pre occupied -It's always still the same
The killer is inside of me-Don't try to take my life
I've burned all my hatchets-but I've sharpened my knives
WHAT?
FUCK!

THIS IS NOT AN EXIT
THIS IS NOT AN EXIT... I NEED TO FEEL SOMETHING
AMERICAN PSYCHO MY CONFESSION MEANS
NOTHING... AMERICAN PSYCHO
NOTHING... AMERICAN PSYCHO
This is not an exit....
