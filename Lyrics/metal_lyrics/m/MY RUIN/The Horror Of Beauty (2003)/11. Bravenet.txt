Let me introduce myself... in case we've never met...
An exorcism of the throat... for those who crave burlesque
Erotic screams are drowned in dreams but I'm still wide awake
The central nervous system of my heart... will always ache
So cut my mouth... and stitch my lips... I swear... I'll never cry
Undress my breath... strip my voice and write another lie
The cult of everything you need will lead you down the path
And I will promise not to read... just promise not to ask

Come get a piece of me... is that what you want?
Rip me apart until I bleed... because it's all my fault!
Come take your piece of me... if that's all that you want
Cut out my tongue so I...
Can't speak... and then you can talk
About me

It's true... I've made some enemies... cause honesty is my vice
I won't pretend... to be your friend... cause I'm not that nice
Described as everything you said... I warned you not to come
But if I don't live up to what you thought... I'm still the one
It's all the little... things I've done... and all the things you say...
If you are so... afraid of me... then stay the fuck away
So high my skin is white and now... my eyes have turned to black
Tongue is dumb from all the drugs
Thank God! I Can't react!

Come get a piece of me... is that what you want?
Rip me apart and watch me bleed... because it's all my fault!
Come take your piece of me... if that's all that you want
Cut out my tongue so I...
Can't speak... and then you can talk
About me... about me... about me... about me...

So full of hate you waste my time... on words that make me tense
I'll be the one to take the blame... The first one to confess
So throw your stones and bruise my face...
But you can't take my faith...
I'd rather die then turn what's sacred... Into something safe!

Come get a piece of me... is that what you want?
Rip me apart and let me bleed... because it's all my fault!
Come take your piece of me... if that's all that you want
Cut out my tongue so I...
Can't speak... and then you can talk
And then YOU CAN TALK
And then YOU CAN TALK
And then you can
And then you can
And then YOU CAN TALK

If you feel the need to go there... then we can go there...
But if not... I suggest you step back before we have a MISUNDERSTANDING!
