Woooohhh just get off... FUCKERS!

You'll find in the mind of a throat that's soar
The beauty of horror
Misunderstood by those who fear her
If you listen... you will hear...
Nazimova
Nazimova
Nazimova
You can't see through me
Did not do... What they told you to
And I won't do... What they tell me to
Why... should I?

All the saints of hate can't save her
Fuck Hollywood cause it made her
Who she was... Who am I
Stab me in my praying hands...
Nazimova
Nazimova
Nazimova
You can't speak through me
Did not do... What they told you to
And I won't do... What they tell me to
Why... should I? WHY.. SHOULD I?

STOP
DROP

Beauty in exile
Horror is in style

Did not do... What they told you to
And I won't do... What they tell me to
Why... should I?

Did not do... What they told you to
And I won't do... What they tell me to
Why... should I?
Why... should I?
Stop!
