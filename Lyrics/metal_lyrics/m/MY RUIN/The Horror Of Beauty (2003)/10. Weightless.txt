Talk to me
Tell me... I'm not skinny

But you think I'm so pretty
"Rockstars have to be thin I'm afraid"
You wanna know... how much do I weigh?
WHAT?

Weightless
You can't market me
Faceless
So blind you can't see

Showcasing
We played for your ego
That follows me... wherever we go
FUCK.. YOU!

Weightless
You can't market me
Faceless
So blind you can't see

Whats my size?
Whats my shape?
Look at me...
I am raped!
Not anorexic...
Or heroine chic...
I'm no waif model...
Cause I fucking eat!

Weightless
You can't market me
Faceless
So blind you can't see
Me
Insincerity...
Insecurity...
No integrity...
Theres no purity...

I will not apologize for scaring you...
You are everything that's wrong with America!
