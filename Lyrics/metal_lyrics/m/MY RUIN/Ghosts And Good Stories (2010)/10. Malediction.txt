The city of angels is filled with apparitions
Ghosts, Musicians and Politicians
All waiting to shake your hand 
But theyâll stab you in the back baby 
Just as quick as they can
They got attitudes, cool moves and hidden agendas
Hear me when I say..
Trust no one 
Cause you just might live to regret it someday

Let us pray
Iâm coming down from the pain 
Those righteous lies I heard you say 
But I refuse to speak your name in vain 
I think its better that way 
Too many words were said
This malediction is inside my head 

Jesus wept
You made youâre bed and now youâll lie in it. 
Each day goes by with my regret
I never wanted to believe you could 
I can't pretend itâs all good 

Too many words were said
This malediction is inside my head 
Enshrined inside of my mind
Is how I bury my dead
How does it feel to be redeemed 
After you lost your faith
You were pathetic when you prayed 
Just begging to be saved!

The Judas left
Our resurrection had to be your death
I wonât forgive or forget

Too many words were said
This malediction is inside my head 
Enshrined inside of my mind
Is how I bury my dead

How does it feel to be redeemed 
After you lost your faith
You were pathetic when you prayed 
Just begging to be saved
Iâll never split that piece of wood 
Never lift that stone
But I will be the one who collects that pound of flesh you oweâ¦ me
