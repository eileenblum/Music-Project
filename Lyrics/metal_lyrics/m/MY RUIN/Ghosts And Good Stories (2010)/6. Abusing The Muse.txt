I've had enough of all this pressure 
This heavy cross has got me bruised
There is no God, prophet or scripture 
That is more sacred than the truth

Tonight I testify (testify) and you've got no excuse (no excuse)
I won't apologize (no apologies) when I abuse my muse

I will defy your sense of righteous 
Your indignation of my words
Sanctify you with my honesty 
I get so holy it hurts

Tonight I testify (testify) and you've got no excuse (testify)
I won't apologize (testify) when I abuse my muse

How can I exorcise my Demons
Without my true confessions
Rants and revelations
How will I get to heaven?

I will condemn your acts of hate and criticize your arrogance
I will offend your book of faith and publicize your ignorance

Tonight I testify (testify) and you've got no excuse (testify)
I won't apologize (testify) when I abuse my muse

Tonight I testify (testify)
Speak my mind (testify)
Testify (testify)
Holy my hand up high
I won't apologize
