Your eyes they wanna cry for me 
Don't make me wanna die for you
Your arms that wanna wrap around me 
Don't make me wanna hang around you
Your bleeding heart that wants to bleed me
Canât make me think I want or need you
And it's no wonder anymore
That I don't wonder anymore
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

I've been turned out-- I've been turned out
I've been turned out--I've been turned out
I've been turned out--Iâve been turned out

You tell me you're my friend 
You say I know you
I'll trust you just as far 
As I can throw you
Now I don't know you
I know my enemies
They show themselves to me with honest eyes
They hate my guts but at least it's the truth
I'll trust them just as far as I can throw them off a roof
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

I've been turned out--I've been turned out
I've been turned out--I've been turned out 

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm no stranger to kindness 
I never missed the fist that kissed my face
I'm no stranger to cheapness
I never came to love the push and shove
Steel, glass-eyes cities 
Crack dirty smiles when they see me
Open their filthy arms to greet me
I don't know if they wanna kiss or kill me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I've been turned out --- I've been turned out
I've been turned out --- I've been turned out
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

Yeah, yeah --- Iâve been turned out 
Yeah, yeah --- Iâve been turned out
