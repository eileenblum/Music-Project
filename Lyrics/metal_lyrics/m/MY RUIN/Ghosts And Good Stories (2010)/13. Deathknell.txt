Faithful are the wounds when theyâre from a friend 
Harbinger of the end 
Hour of redemption
Sitting here tonight in our earthly paradise
Thinking about all those who have come in and out of our life
Our beautiful house built of blood, sweat and rock
If only these walls could talk
Hold my hand, stretched to infinity and filled with memories
Walk with me down this dark hallway together in all that we have weathered.

I can hear the bell ring somewhere in the distance
And deep within myself
I know that this too shall pass

I can hear the rain outside 
The streets wet with regret
How easy it is to remember
How hard it is to forget
Old photographs are burned into ash
Let us toast the ghosts of our past
Come for me and comfort me in this moment of memories
In remembrance, these lovely bones of metaphors are the exquisite corpse of friendship

I can hear the bell ring somewhere in the distance
And deep within myself
I know that this too shall pass

Let us remember this feeling as we sit in front of our home
For this house that we built, we built it alone.
10 years strong with heart, soul and pride
They tried to kill us but we have survived

I can hear the bell ring somewhere in the distance
And deep within myself 
I know that this too shall pass
I can hear the bell ring somewhere in the distance
And deep within myself
I know that this too shall pass

In the end, we will continue to do what we do
Without them
But never, me without you
