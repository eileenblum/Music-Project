Excommunicated 
Another holy war
The cost of friendship is this heavy cross I bare until Iâm sore
Donât find it necessary - to show my piety
These are the end of days no solace in this city

In a world that makes me sick - I will be your heretic
In a world that makes me sick - I will be your heretic

I split my lip â They cut their teeth
Sometimes silence is - A perfect scream
Donât ask why this stone is in my hand
Wonât be seeing you again my friend

Excommunicated
Another holy war
Los Angeles is just a heavy dose of all that I deplore
The shine has left me- with no remorse or love
And all the soarings of my mind begin within my blood
In a world thatâs filled with faith - You canât take my blasphemy
In a world thatâs filled with faith - You canât take my blasphemy

I split my lip â They cut their teeth
Sometimes silence is - A perfect scream
Donât ask why this stone is in my hand
Wonât be seeing you again my friend

This is the story of brothers with dirty faces
A city filled with angels liars and betrayers
This is a requiem for a friend and born of hate
A walk down memory lane that took it all away
