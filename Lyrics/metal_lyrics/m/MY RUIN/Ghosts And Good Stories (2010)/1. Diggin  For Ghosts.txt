Time waits for no one, the days grow older and I grow colder 
This Devil's on my shoulder and he's smiling at me 
But I donât trust what heâs saying and I donât wanna believe

I find it hard to cry when I'm spent 
Tie the wires around my head 
Pound the nails into my flesh and I'm bleeding again 
I'm diggin for ghosts and good stories scarlet to the bone 
If I kill all my demons - Will my angels leave me alone 

Time waits for no one, the nights get longer and I get stronger 
Your God is standing before me with his arms out wide
But I donât wanna give in to him so he can judge me or my life

I find it hard to cry when I'm spent 
Tie the wires around my head 
Pound the nails into my flesh and I'm bleeding again
I'm diggin for ghosts and good stories scarlet to the bone 
If I kill all my demons - Will my angels leave me alone 

Time is like the wind, it leaves the light and lifts the heavy 
I've seen my fate and I'm not afraid, in fact Iâm ready 
Each moment has its memory and this too shall pass 
Whether I wake or sleep I still believe that nothing last'sâ¦ Forever

Haughty eyes and a lying tongue 
Hands that shed innocent blood
A heart that devises wicked plots - Feet that are swift to run
I've burned my bridges down - Turned my back on this town 
I've burned my bridges down - Turned my back on this town 

Let us pray that we enter not into temptation
The spirit is willing indeed but the flesh is weak
And as you sowâshall you reap
In loving memory
