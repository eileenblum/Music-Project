A broken heart seems much too heavy - It's time to rest
Carried it around so long, can't feel my chest
Baptize my body and wash away these thoughts of doubt
Bring back that feeling of which I canât be without

Here I sit in aftermath
But Iâve got more to give
Tuesday feels like suicide
But I just wanna live

Heavy is a heart that breaks â Itâs time to mend
Put it back together, cause itâs not time to end
Repent my sins and ask forgiveness for my fear
Bring back that feeling that had almost disappeared 
Here I sit in aftermath
But Iâve got more to give
Tuesday feels like suicide
But I just wanna live

Here I sit in aftermath
But Iâve got more to give
Tuesday feels like suicide
But I just wanna live
True Friends, stab you in the front 
Not the back motherfuckers like you did to us
True Friends, stab you in the front 
Not the back motherfuckers like you did to us

Here I sit in the aftermath 
Here I sit in the aftermath
Here I sit in the aftermath
And after all is said and doneâ¦Iâm coming back
