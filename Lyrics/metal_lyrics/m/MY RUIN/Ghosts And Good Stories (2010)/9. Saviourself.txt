Desperation looks so good 
She could smell a mile away
Christ died for someoneâs sins 
And heâs buried in LA
Check your ego cause youâre no hero
Sincerity still seems so vulgar when it comes from you

Saviourself
Better save yourself
Pretend to be her Jesus
Inside that mound of Venus

Resurrection feels so good 
Throw a party to celebrate 
Don't need you to kill my buzz 
You'd rather go home anyway 
Check your ego cause youâre no hero
Sold out everything you ever said and did 
When you knew us

Saviourself
Better save yourself
Pretend to be her Jesus
Inside that mound of Venus
Saviourself
Better save yourself
Youâre just another Judas
And just like everyone else

Hey Mister remember me
Iâm the one with the sharp tongue
Got it crucified in my cheek 
Drinkin whiskey shotgun
Did you suffer much on that cross
When you lost all your passion
Well I guess itâs true what they say 
Friendship is a fashion!

Saviourself
Better save yourself
Pretend to be her Jesus
Inside that mound of venus
Saviourself
Better save yourself
Youâre just another Judas
And just like everyone else

The God of my rock 
Only in him will I trust
He is my shield, my salvation 
Can I get a witness
My one true saviour from violence
