I gave you all of me 
I gave the whole thing 
I wanted you to be something that I can't explain 
I gave you good fights 
I gave you loyalty 
I treated you like you were most important to me 

You've always been my sweet obsession 
My religion and relationship 
I never let nobody come between us 
The one thing that I cannot quit 
Please pray for the repose of my soul
Please pray for the repose of my soul

You needed my time 
You wanted my life 
You had me workin' for you everyday and all night 
You took advantage 
You did some damage 
You let me do it all and trusted me to manage 

You've always been my sweet obsession 
My religion and relationship 
I never let nobody come between us 
The one thing that I cannot quit 
Please pray for the repose of my soul
Please pray for the repose of my soul

I need some time to get away 
Calmness and tranquility 
Freedom from worry and peace of mind 
Cause I don't want to leave it all behind 

You've always been my sweet obsession 
My religion and relationship 
I never let nobody come between us 
The one thing that I cannot quit 
Please pray for the repose of my soul
Please pray for the repose of my soul

Every blessing ignored becomes a curse 
Every blessing ignored becomes a curse 
Every blessing ignored becomes a curse 
Every blessing ignored becomes a curse
