Hail Mary, full of grace
Be my muse and give me strength
Holy Mary, full of sin
Hear my prayer and let me in

Welcome to my long dark night - Canât sleep or close my eyes
Little slices of death I loathe them - Refuse to get to know them
My rebirth of a scream eternalux with a heart at peace
O Lord have mercy - till it hurts - heed my words

This revelation wonât be televised
My sacrifice will be this long dark night
This revelation wonât be televised
My sacrifice will be this long dark nightâ¦of the soul

Blessed is the one who reads - these words of prophecy
Heavy is the hand that smites - In God we trust and fight
We rise from the dead and write our own new testament
OâLord have mercy - Iâm in mourning - heed my warning

This revelation wonât be televised
My sacrifice will be this long dark night
This revelation wonât be televised
My sacrifice will be this long dark nightâ¦of the soul

This, my winter of discontent - listen as I repent
Bleed for me on this night long - hear me as I speak in tongues
Blasphemy is so easy - when youâve lost your faith and donât believe
Help me heal my mind -This happens every time
Hands out wide I say to you â Praise my scars and sacred wounds
Feel my pain and scripture inked in paint
Iâm no saint!

This revelation wonât be televised
This revelation wonât be televised
This revelation wonât be televised
This revelation wonât be televised
On this long dark night of my soul
