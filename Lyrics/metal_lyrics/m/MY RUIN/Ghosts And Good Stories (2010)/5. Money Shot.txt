Get ready to shoot yourself
Get ready to shoot yourself
Get ready to shoot yourself â Pose for another photo
Get ready to shoot yourself â Tits and tats and a quid pro quo

Câmon baby give em what you got
Everybody wants a money shot
Câmon baby give em what they need
Keep lookin hot and cheap

Get ready to sell your soul
Get ready to sell your soul
Get ready to sell your soul - Pose for another photo
Get ready to sell your soul â Tits and ass and innuendo

Câmon baby give em what you got
Everybody wants a money shot
Câmon baby give em what they need
Keep lookin hot and cheap

You think youâre different but youâre all the same
You got the body but you got no brains
Youâre just an image at the end of the day
Got nothing to say

Get ready to shoot yourself
Get ready to shoot yourself
Get ready to shoot yourself â Pose for another photo
Get ready to shoot yourself â Tits and flash and lots of ego

Câmon baby give em what you got
Everybody wants a money shot
Câmon baby give em what they need
Keep lookin hot and cheap
Câmon baby give em what you got
Everybody wants a money shot
Câmon give em everything they want

Youâre everything Iâm not!
