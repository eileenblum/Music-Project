Her hidden face offends - the righteous ways of men
Beneath the veil lies - the meaning of submission
Imprisoned in the dark - she fights to see the light
Denied a voice to speak - and basic human rights

Holier than thou - Heavier than God
Blessed be thy name - Itâs coming down
Heavier than God
Holier than thou

Inside the torture mask - her eyes are lined with black
The cloth curtain covers - her beauty front to back
And in the name of faith - she suffers for religion
The cloak of fear and terror - is a war on women

Holier than thou - Heavier than God
Blessed be thy name - Itâs coming down
Heavier than God
Holier than thou

So pious in their violence â against their women
Misogynistic men who donât believe in freedom
Persecuted, silenced, treated as possessions
A profound reminder of oppression

Holier than thou - Heavier than God
Blessed be thy name- Itâs coming down
Heavier than God
Holier than thou

Her identity remains a mystery
Deprived of dignity and her self esteem
Forced modesty - without equality 
Sacrificed her life â to live unseen
