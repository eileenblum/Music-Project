I walk without flinching through this burning aftermath
Hollywood is on fire again
A sign something is about to happen
I can hear the bell ring in the distance
Death is upon us.

These streets are lined with lies 
LAâs an ugly face that wears a good disguise
This town has lost itâs shine
The hills have desperate eyes

I breathe without feeling the sweet scent of regret in the air
Too close for comfort too far to care
I can hear the warm winds blow through the trees
And something tells me
Itâs time to leave

These streets are lined with lies 
LAâs an ugly face that wears a good disguise
This town has lost itâs shine
The hills have desperate eyes
This town has lost itâs shine
The hills have desperate eyes

The walls are closing in 
The walls are closing in again
Face down on the motherfucking pavement
The walls are closing in
The walls are closing in again
I can feel the heat and six degrees of separation 

This town has lost itâs shine
The hills have desperate eyes
This town has lost itâs shine 
The hills have desperate eyes

La Ciudad de la Ruina - La Ciudad de la Ruina
La Ciudad de la Ruina - La Ciudad de la Ruina
