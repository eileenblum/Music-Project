Built my church with words of violence
Spoke my sermons to the pious
I seek myself for guidance
My religion is defiance
Holy Mother you keep quiet
Truth hurts - so you deny it
I canât take another liar
Burn that witch till sheâs on fire

Every friend is a future enemy
In this temple of doom and family
Sacrificed my life for this to be
All I know is all I ever will be

Praise my God in words of violence
Suffer for my art in silence
I speak in tongues to riot
My religion is defiance
Holy Father full of fear
Truth is - you disappeared
I can never be your daughter
Just another lamb to slaughter

Every friend is a future enemy
In this temple of doom and family
Sacrificed my life for this to be
All I know is all I ever will be

This is a Southern Revelation
In with the new out with the old
This is a Southern Revelation
A restoration of a soul

I am light - In my world
I am darkness - A blasphemous girl

Every friend is a future enemy
In this temple of doom and family
Sacrificed my life for this to be
All I know is all I ever will be

I am light -In my world
I am darkness - A blasphemous girl

Every friend is a future enemy
In this temple of doom and family
Sacrificed my life for this to be
All I know is all I ever will be
