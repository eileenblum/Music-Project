Iâve got a knife inside my back
And itâs digginâ deeper everyday
Iâve got a letter in my hand
With words I know I need to say
It makes me sick to think we ever trusted or believed you
So stay the fuck away from us cause we no longer need you

Iâm so ready - yes Iâm ready - to unload again
Highly explosive - You were warned I might explode again
Yeah weâre ready - weâre so ready - here we go again
You tried to stop us once but this is now and that was then!

Iâm burning up again - Iâm on fire motherfucker
Might explode again â Youâre a lying motherfucker

Iâve read those ugly things you said
And I just canât get em out my head
Iâve heard about your nasty mouth
The trash I know you talked all over town
It makes me sick to think we ever trusted or believed you
So stay the fuck away from us cause we no longer need you

Iâm so ready - yes Iâm ready to unload again
Highly explosive - You were warned I might explode again
Yeah weâre ready - weâre so ready - here we go again
You tried to stop us once but this is now and that was then

Iâm burning up again â Iâm on fire motherfucker
Might explode again cause youâre a lyinâ motherfucker
And you know Iâm crazy
A ticking time bomb baby
Thatâs right Iâm fuckinâ crazy
Highly explosive baby
I suggest you stay the fuck away fromâ¦me.
