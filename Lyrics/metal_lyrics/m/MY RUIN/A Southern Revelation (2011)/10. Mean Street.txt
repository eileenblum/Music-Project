[originally by Van Halen]At night I walk this stinkin' street
Past the crazies on my block
And I see the same old faces
And I hear that same old talk
And I'm searching for the latest thing
A break in this routine
I'm talkin' some new kicks
Ones like you ain't never seen
This is homeâ¦.This is Mean Street
Itâs our homeâ¦..The only one I know

An' we don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Cause we're sick of these four walls
Now what you think is nothin'
Might be somethin' after all
Now you know this ain't no through street
The end is dead ahead
The poor folks play for keeps down here
They're the living dead

Come on downâ¦..Down to Mean Street
They're dancin' nowâ¦..Look! Out on Mean Street
Dance baby!

It's always here and now my friend
It ain't once upon a time
Itâs all over but the screaminâ
I come to take what's mine
We're searchin' for the latest thing
A break in this routine
Iâm talkin' some new kicks
Ones like you ain't never seen

This is home....This is Mean Street
Itâs our homeâ¦.The only one I know

(This is home)
See a gun is real easy
(This is Mean Street)
In this desperate part of town
(This is home)
Turns you from hunted into hunter, yeah
(This is Mean Street)
You go an' hunt somebody down
Wait a minute now
(This is home)
Somebody said "Fair Warning"
(This is Mean Street)
Lord, strike that poor boy down!
