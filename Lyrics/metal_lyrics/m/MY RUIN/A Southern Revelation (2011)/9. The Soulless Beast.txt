The soulless beast he came to feast upon our hearts with sin
He took the form of many men and called himself a friend
His charming words they lead us to believe and follow him
We couldnât see his teeth but we could feel his grin

The abomination - That causes desolation's
The abomination â That causes desolation's

The soulless beast appeared so confident to gain our trust
Born of a jackal but disguised himself as one of us
He changed his face and shape when we would start to realize
He was as evil as the book of Daniel prophesied

The abomination -That causes desolation's
The abomination - That causes desolation's

This is our seven daggers of Megiddo
This is our Holy Sacrament
This is our sacrificial lamb
Our moment to repent
No more trials and tribulation
Revenge is fueled by Nazarene
Tonightâs the night we pay our penance
This is our slaying of the beast

Faith - Means not wanting to know whatâs true
Faith - Is a knowledge in the heart beyond the reach of proof

The abomination - That causes desolation's
The abomination - That causes desolation's
