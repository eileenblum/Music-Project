Itâs all about the basking in the perfect calm
The storm is finally passing â You canât admit youâre wrong
We all have our silent unspeakable memories
That we do not choose to share but with a few
Todayâs inspiration comes from you

I feel the discontent - But itâs about to end
Open up a vein and bleed - This mourning of a friend
Itâs all about the basking â In the perfect calm
The storm is finally passing â You canât admit youâre wrong

Digital girl with an analogue heart
Vultures are waiting to tear us apart
Times like this I remember when
Itâs easier to forgive an enemy than a friend

I feel the disconnect â Theyâll be no going back
The art is obvious - The silence is a stab
Itâs all about the basking â In the perfect calm
The storm is finally passing â You canât admit youâre wrong

Digital girl with an analogue heart
Vultures are waiting to tear us apart
Times like this I remember when
Itâs easier to forgive an enemy than a friend

The line is thin and red
Between the love and hate
The Sky is far and wide
To London from LA
Where thereâs a carcass thereâs a vulture
Picking bones of flesh and minds
The devils drawing in the details
Where friendships go to die

Itâs all about the basking â In the perfect calm
The storm is finally passing â You canât admit youâre wrong

Digital girl with an analogue heart
Vultures are waiting to tear us apart
Times like this I remember when
Itâs easier to forgive an enemy than a friend

Where thereâs an artist thereâs a vulture
In the picture is the proof
Art of illusion is ironic
The art of friendship is the truth

Your pretty pictureâs lie â Your pretty pictures hide
Nobody knows the real vulture who lives deep inside of you
