Under a black and starry sky
Make my peace and say goodbye
Dig the grave and watch it die
Bury this in my mind
Within a stream of consciousness
Cold is so intense
My fingers freeze but my language vents

The unintended consequences of complicated friendships
Once sacred now irreverent
The unintended consequences of complicated friendships
Iâm unable to mend my fences

On top of white and snowy ground
Lose myself in the sound
My sorrows I drown
Listen to the wind howl
The darkness I feel
Winters chill in my bones
My heart will ache but my words hit home

The unintended consequences of complicated friendships
Once sacred now irreverent
The unintended consequences of complicated friendships
Iâm unable to mend my fences

This is an elegy - A funeral for your sins
This is a eulogy - This is your requiem

I turn and walk away - Iâm growing colder by the day
I turn and walk away

The unintended consequences of complicated friendships
Once sacred now irreverent
The unintended consequences of complicated friendships
Iâm unable to mend my fences

This is an elegy - A funeral for your sins
This is a eulogy - This is your requiem
