Youâd like to think that you know me well - You never thought I would ever tell
Signed a deal with the Devil - Then I told him to go straight to hell
Iâd like to take you by your hand - And bash your skull in with a bat
Iâd like to cut you down to size - While I pray for your demise
And this time I wonât be nice - Iâd like to end your fucking life

Youâre all talk but your words are empty â The big shot you pretend to be
Youâre all talk but your words are empty - My middle finger is all you get from me

Youâd like to think that you know me well - You never thought I would ever tell
Signed a deal with the Devil - Then I told him to go straight to hell
Iâd like to pull your insides out â And push your heart into your mouth
Iâd like to crucify your wrists â And drive the nails in with my fists
And this time I wonât be nice - Iâd like to end your fucking life

Youâre all talk but your words are empty â The big shot you pretend to be
Youâre all talk but your words are empty - My middle finger is all you get from me

And you can blame me so you feel better
I know the truth and Iâve read your letters
D is for Devil - The great misleader - D is for Devil â The great deceiver
D is for Devil - The great offender - D is for Daniel - The great pretender

Youâre all talk but your words are empty â The big shot you pretend to be
Youâre all talk but your words are empty - My middle finger is all you get from me
Iâd like to watch your face turn blue
As I hold this grudge against you
Take my vengeance out on you
Make my violent fantasy come true
