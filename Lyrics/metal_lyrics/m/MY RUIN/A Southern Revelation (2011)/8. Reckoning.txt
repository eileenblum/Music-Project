Woke up today and saw our life flash right before our eyes
Were left for dead but once again from ashes we will rise
The truth will set us free and when it does make no mistake
Weâve died a million times and weâre too strong for you to break

So arrogant your power trip letâs you believe youâre right
So sick inside your egotistic twisted little mind
Youâre just another motherfucker and a lesson learned
This is our reckoning, youâve said enough now itâs our turn

Woke up today and saw the light flash right before our eyes
Weâre done with all your poor excuses and your dirty lies
The world will know the man is nothing but a little bitch
Weâve burned another bridge and this time we donât give a shit

So arrogant your power trip letâs you believe youâre right
So sick inside your egotistic twisted little mind
Youâre just another motherfucker and a lesson learned
This is our reckoning, youâve said enough now itâs our turn

We gave you everything but nothing we gave was enough
Now we no longer trust you and you no longer know us
We gave you everything but nothing we gave was enough
Pretend we donât exist but you know what you did to us

So arrogant your power trip letâs you believe youâre right
So sick inside your egotistic twisted little mind
Youâre just another motherfucker and a lesson learned
This is our reckoning, youâve said enough now itâs our turn!
