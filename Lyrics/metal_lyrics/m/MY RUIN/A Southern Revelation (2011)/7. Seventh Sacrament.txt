Iâm sick to death of people trying to fit in
Commercialized into meaningless trends
The politics and the making amends
Thatâs why Iâve got more enemies than friends

January screams bring back memories
Ghosts from the past and other good stories
Immortalized in a Southern lament
The hills of Tennessee wonât let me forget

I canât stand another counterfeit band
Homogenized and painfully bland
The kissing ass and the shaking of hands
Thatâs why Iâve got more enemies than friends

January screams bring back memories
Ghosts from the past and other good stories
Immortalized in a Southern lament
The hills of Tennessee wonât let me forget

The seventh sacrament â Body and blood
The seventh sacrament â Art that I bleed
The seventh sacrament â Flesh and the word
The seventh sacrament is setting us free

January screams bring back old memories
Ghosts from the past and other good stories
Immortalized in a Southern lament
The hills of Tennessee wonât let me forget

The seventh sacrament â The body and blood
The seventh sacrament â The art that I bleed
The seventh sacrament â The flesh and the word
The seventh sacrament will set us free
