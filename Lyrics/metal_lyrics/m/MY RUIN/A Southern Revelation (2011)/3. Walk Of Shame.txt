Now I can tell by the way you came in - Youâre just dying to be famous
Strung out on your own reflection â In desperate need of attention
So high on hope youâre wasted - So close you can almost taste it
So yesterday youâre faded - Welcome to LAâ¦.youâve made it

Youâre the walk of shame - Youâre the Sunset Strip
Youâre the same clichÃ©â honey â So keep on selling it

You pretend that youâre so alive - But youâre dead behind those eyes
Spun out from your last depression - a true Hollywood confession
So high on hope youâre wasted - So close you can almost taste it
So yesterday youâre faded - Welcome to LAâ¦.youâve made it

Youâre the walk of shame - Youâre the Sunset strip
Youâre the same clichÃ©â honey - And you look like shit
Youâre the walk of shame -Youâre an ego trip
Youâve got a lot to say by the sound of it but ya ainât saying shit

Walkâ¦..of shame - Drop another name
Walkâ¦..of shame - Welcome to LA

Well youâve got all the answers donât you â And there ainât nothing that you wonât do
True master of self promotion but you canât buy and sell devotion
So high on hope youâre wasted - So close you can almost taste it
So yesterday youâre faded - Welcome to LAâ¦.youâve made it

Youâre the walk of shame - Youâre the Sunset strip
Youâre the same clichÃ©â - And you look like shit
Youâre the walk of shame - Youâre an ego trip
Youâve got a lot to say by the sound of it but ya ainât saying shit

Walkâ¦..of shame
Walkâ¦..of shame
Walkâ¦..of shame
Walkâ¦..of shame
