Sick... sick with disease
deny addiction down on my knees
feed my affliction scared to believe my own decisions
eager to please
distorted visions breed life need life breathe life keep life
lie and decieve with no emotion
false promises loss of devotion
scarred by deceit my self destruction
love obsolete live in disfunction breed life need life breathe life heal life
bleed life feel life keep life the sweet life is all I want...
can I breathe for the ritual?
Breath for it got a need for the ritual can I bleed for the ritual?
Bleed for it.
Got a need for the ritual

Can I breathe for the ritual? breathe for it got a need for the ritual

Can I bleed for the ritual? bleed for it got a need for the ritual
Sick with it.
Sick with it.
Sick with it

Sick with it
Sick with it
Sick with it
Sick with it...

It's inside me I feel it growing nowhere to hide my anger's showing
Breed life need life breathe life heal life bleed life feel life keep life

The sweet life...
And on this dark night of my soul
I will continue to pray for us and try to remember only the good things...
the sweet life, the sweet life...
