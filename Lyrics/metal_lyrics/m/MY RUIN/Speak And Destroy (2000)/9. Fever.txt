I... I think I'll cut myself
Cut myself free
Now I'm somewhere else
I need to be
Wasted with no sleep
Forgot to pray
Jesus can you hear me?
Nails keep pounding
You push your fingers into holes
Of what my questions left
And as I drown your mouth in red
You fear what I will ask next
I violate your faith
And wonder what you really taste like
Feel the sensation of depth
I lied...
Can't help me now
It's under my skin
Nowhere to go

But I won't give in
Can't help me now
I'm bleeding within

Nowhere to go
I'll never let you in (I have a fear of dying)
I could... I could worship you
Make you behave
I'd tell... tell you anything
Just to be saved
Baby... how's your faith these days?
Do you feel safe?
Kiss me
Sunlight makes us sick
As nails keep pounding
You wrap your legs around my mind
Ten times and hide in me
The darker that it gets outside
Your heats a 1000 degrees
I make you swallow spit
You're sick with it
You're sick from me
Don't say I didn't warn you, I tried...
Can't help me now
It's under my skin
Nowhere to go
But I won't give in
Can't help me now
I'm bleeding within
Nowhere to go
I'll never ever give in
What god created me?... (your god)
What god created us?... (your god)
What god created this... thing called lust?
Your god created me?... (what god)

Your god created us?.... (what god)
Your god created
FUCK... YOUR GOD CAN'T HELP ME NOW
IT'S UNDER MY SKIN
NOWHERE TO GO
BUT I WON'T GIVE IN
CAN'T HELP ME NOW
I'M BLEEDING WITHIN
NOWHERE TO GO
I'LL NEVER LET YOU GIVE IN
I won't let you in
Won't let you in (let me in)
Won't let you (let me in)
GOD WON'T LET YOU...............
