Elegantly wasted and I can taste it
here I sit, trying not to fake this gift of the beauty myth
I can't help but feel like this
bored... of the beauty whore
coz my body just wants more scars...
I can feel them wounds...
I can't heal them
red bring my mouth to life
black revive my hair that's dyed
make-up always helps me hide
what I don't like on the outside

Starlight, starbright first star I see tonight
I wish I may, I wish I might have the wish
I wish tonight a birthday girl
a broken heart you name the drama
she played the part long lost demons leave her godless
like her powder leaves her flawless
sugar coated heart shaped pout lipstick
just distorts her mouth
mascara puts her eyes to sleep
cause beauty's only skin deep

Starlight, starbright first star I see tonight
I wish I may, I wish I might have the wish
I wish tonight

Starlight, starbright first star I see tonight
I wish I may, I wish I might have the wish
I wish tonight

Bitch du jour served on a platter
she's so pretty but does it matter
beauty is in the eye of the beholder
but nobody told her
mirror mirror on the wall
watch her break and watch her fall
stitch her smile and bruise her knees
walk among her enemies

Starlight, starbright first star I see tonight
I wish I may, I wish I might have the wish
I wish tonight

Starlight, starbright first star I see tonight
I wish I may, I wish I might have the wish
I wish tonight

blessed am I among women
to live and love in such a beautiful temple
blessed am I among women.
