Sometimes I feel I've got to run away,
I've got to get away from the pain you drive into the heart of me
The love we share seems to go nowhere
and I've lost my light for I toss and turn I can't sleep at night....

Once I ran to you,
Now I'll run from you,
This tainted love you've given,
I give you all a girl could give you,
take my tears and that's not nearly all...
Tainted love, tainted love.

Now I know I've got to run away
I've got to get away,
You don't really want anymore from me to make things right you need someone to hold you tight,
And you'll think love is to pray but I'm sorry I don't pray that way.

Once I ran to you,
Now I run from you,
This tainted love you've given,
I give you all a girl could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all.
Tainted love tainted love,
Don't touch me please I cannot stand the way you tease.

I love you though you hurt me so now it's time you pack your things and go.
Tainted love, tainted love
Touch me baby tainted love,
don't touch me baby tainted love,
Touch me baby tainted love,
Don't touch me baby tainted love...
Tainted love. Tainted love

Tainted love. Tainted love
Tainted love. Tainted love
