(We're going to a nice place...)

Your mouth blooms like a cut sweet and full of sin
I prick myself on your thorns and I bleed within
your leaves fade to brown and I watch you die in my torture garden under black sunshine.
My beautiful flower

[chorus]

he loves me not he loves me he loves me not he loves me
he loves me not he loves me he loves me not he loves me
he loves me not he loves me he loves me not he loves me

he loves me not he loves me... (we all fall down)
our love starts to spoil your lips bleed like a rose
underneath the soil is where the evil grows your petals start to fall and the weeds attack
in my torture garden the blue sky is black
my beautiful flower
[chorus]
your mouth blooms like a cut sweet and full of sin
I prick myself on your thorns and I bleed within
our love starts to spoil your lips bleed like a rose
underneath the soil is where the evil grows I am earth...
you can feel me touch you hear me breath...
cos it's my air that loves you and I am fire...
you will feel me burn you come inside...
and I'll be water with you
he loves me not he loves me he loves me not he loves me

he loves me not he loves me he loves me not he loves me
he loves me not he loves me he loves me not he loves me

he loves me not he loves me...
