It was a long time ago longer now than it seems.
A place that perhaps you have seen in your dreams...
welcome to my world, is it what you thought it would be?
I'm trapped inside this hell between blood queen and purgatory a coop filled covered hall, a tattooed baby doll,
I've got the devil in my corner and Jesus on my wall.

[chorus]

today is an oatmeal day I feel like a monster babe preacher, save me with your call and I will be your little miss scareall.
One eye's green, one eye's blue.
Demons, angels, a love that's true catch me as I start to fall, let me be your little miss scareall.
Halloween is over but I will keep you scared,
take you to the fright side I know you'll come prepared, be your deadly nightshade, turn your christmas black and you can be my johnny homicidal maniac

[chorus]

Forgive me preacher for I have sinned.
It's been 3 weeks since my first confession.
I am the one...
hiding under your bed.
My teeth are sharp, my lips are red,
I am the one...
hiding under your stairs with snakes and spiders in her hair
I feel like a monster babe little miss scareall,
I feel like a monster babe. little miss scareall - LITTLE MISS SCAREALL!

I FEEL LIKE A MONSTER BABE
LITTLE MISS SCAREALL! LITTLE MISS SCAREALL! (I FEEL LIKE A MONSTER BABE)
LITTLE MISS SCAREALL! (I FEEL LIKE A MONSTER BABE)
LITTLE MISS SCAREALL (I FEEL LIKE A MONSTER - FEEL LIKE A MONSTER)
I feel like a monster babe...
