[from the 1999 "Speak And Destroy" album release]

You say I'm angry, I guess I should be
Because it makes me happy
My mind is creepy...I guess it could be
Depends on what you ask me
(you are my) bright red scream
Girl wet dream
(you are my) bright red scream
When I sleep I dream of you

You say I'm scary... I guess I could be
Cos when I speak you fear me,
My mouth is dirty...I guess it would be
Pretend you just don't hear me
(you are my) bright red scream
Girl wet dream
(you are my) bright red scream
Nothing is what it will seem...
And I'm your scary teddy bear

Love me hate me...
I let you drive me crazy
Crucify me or do you wanna save me yes, no maybe...
It doesn't matter baby you're not so clean
That I can't make you wanna scream, scream, scream, scream...
With me...

Bright red scream
Girl wet dream
(you are my) bright red scream
Scream with me
Scream for me
I'm not mean... I'm just not nice and there's a difference
Thank you for remaining at a safe distance!
