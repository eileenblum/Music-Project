This place is hell to me and I can never get no sleep
there's a devil in my bed with me whose talk is cheap.
You feel like heaven to me all I wanna do is sleep
you're like an angel lyin' next to me
you look so sweet close your eyes and lets pretend
remember why we're just friends

my tangled hair will weave a web of lies within my sheets
and in the morning I'll be nailed where he crucified me
your blackened hair will leave a stain inside my mind so deep
and when tomorrow comes I'll wish that you would worship me
close your eyes and lets pretend.
remember why we're just friends

There must be a storm in London tonight because it's cold and raining hard
my body aches, my lover waits,
I pick the scabs from my arms there must be a storm in LA tonight
because it's cold and raining hard I miss your face.
I miss your kiss, I miss the stars of your arms the man that I lust in
he do I trust for he is my God my anti Jesus he is my saviour my salvation
he leads me into temptation in my highest hour
my lowest moment he is my torture
he is my torment and I will pray for him to remain my friend and save me from my enemies...
forever amen
this place is hell to me and I can never get no sleep
there's a devil in the bed with me whose talk is...
cheap.
