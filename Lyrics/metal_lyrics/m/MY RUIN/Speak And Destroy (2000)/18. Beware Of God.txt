God wants to heal cancer...
Christians are commanded alcohol.. is good!...
evasion of crutches you partake of the dust of the ground...
I know some of you are frightened about it...
we can go to church and you are naked...
and over the foul of the air and fire
of course people said they're drunk
and this my friend is my prayer for you...
