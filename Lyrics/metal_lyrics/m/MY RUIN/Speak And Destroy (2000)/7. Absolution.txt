I wanna live in the pretty sun
but daylight just makes me numb
so I cover up my scars with velvet drapes that kill rockstars,
change my mood lick my wounds.
Trust will lead us to the truth
drown myself in misery
sleep with my enemy
destroy my destiny
erase the memory...
of you,
open myself to reveal my wounds and I find the memory of you
open myself to reveal my wounds and I find the memory of you
open myself to reveal my wounds and I find the memory of you

open myself to reveal my wounds...
I wanna die on the blackest night when there's no-one left to fight
fill my bed with leopard fur
think of you inside of her
suffer for my latest sin until I'm happy in my skin.
Open myself to reveal my wounds and I find the memory of you
open myself to reveal my wounds and I find the memory of you
open myself to reveal my wounds and I find the memory of you
open myself to reveal my wounds...
I ache for you...
I ache for us, I pray for you...
I pray for us, I wait for you...
I wait deny thy lover and refuse thy name first,
last and always, [repeat] when will you tell me the truth?
When will you tell you the truth?
When will you tell me the truth?
When will you tell you... (the truth)
my revenge on you will not kill you it will make you want to kill yourself.
