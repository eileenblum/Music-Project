Come to me
As Christ redeemed
Your make-up hides your misanthropy
But I can see
You're still diseased
Get off your cross
Get off your knees
Dare I see
The same in me
I never thought that I could be
So you just lick your wounds
But it's too late
Trust will lead you to your own fate
MASOCHRIST...
WHAT YOU SEW IS WHAT YOU REAP
WE'RE ONLY SICK AS SECRETS THAT WE KEEP
WHAT YOU USE IS WHAT YOU'LL NEED
BUT I CAN'T STAND TO WATCH YOU BLEED FOR ME

Forgive me father for I'm not clean

I'd rather be Miss Magdalene

Your vaseline won't heal my demons

Cause I don't talk to god I'M SCREAMING
Dare I see
The same in me
Never thought
That I would be...
But now I bruise my knees
Rape my faith

Scar myself
With love and with hate
MASOCHRIST...
WHAT YOU SEW IS WHAT YOU'LL REAP
WE'RE ONLY SICK AS SECRETS THAT WE KEEP
AND WHAT YOU'LL USE IS WHAT YOU'LL NEED
I CAN'T STAND TO WATCH YOU BLEED
For Me
For Me
For Me
For Me...
Oh Lord hear my prayer
You look like you are scared
I do what you taught me
It's your turn to watch me
Oh Lord hear my prayer
Pull me by my black hair
And stab me with your greed
It's my turn to... bleed
WHAT YOU SEW IS WHAT YOU REAP
WE'RE ONLY SICK AS SECRETS THAT WE KEEP
AND WHAT I USE IS WHAT I NEED
SO CAN YOU STAND TO WATCH ME AS I BLEED
BLEED
I BLEED
BLEED
For you... for me
