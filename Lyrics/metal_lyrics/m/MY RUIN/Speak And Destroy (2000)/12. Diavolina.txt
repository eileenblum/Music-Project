Yeah!

[chorus]

this is a mantra for myself
this is a mantra for someone else
this is a mantra so be warned...
hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.
Sweetly he smiles at me so bright it burns me
tongue twisted sick with words she'll get what she deserves
she got what she deserved.
See me I look at you so deep that she feels me
girl tricks make you believe but she steals me I will be her disease
Diavolina screams...

[chorus]

Keep me so safe inside your sins
are secret I watch you live your life in regret
you'll get what you deserve
sleepy you close your eyes but you can't dream me
dirty girl so mean can't clean me I will be your disease
Diavolina screams...

this is a mantra for myself
this is a mantra for someone else
this is a mantra so be warned...
hell hath no fury like a woman...

And I swear sacred as this heart of mine strong
as the ties that bind us heavy as this cross which I forever bear
eternity will be the hell we share what you want
I don't care coz it doesn't concern me.
This is about what I need
so bleed as the needle goes in,
I'm creeping under your skin soak you in sickness and scent you in sin
so say you love her and I'll believe you
but if you can't then you only decieve you
I said I love you and I don't lie...
remember that next time you kiss me goodbye

(And I swear as sacred as this song to me

all the way to the end that I will never let this happen again...)
