Destroy me as want turns to need
you murder me just to watch me bleed.
I live inside... my own make believe,
I sacrifice... what you can't see
I'm hissing mad and I'm dripping wet.
I have no father, I have no pet and I'll be damned the day I die
your anti muse your anti lie

[chorus]
can I speak?
I will destroy if I speak,
it will destroy how I speak...
I will destroy when I speak...
it will destroy you another lover, another man, another victim of circumstance.
I close my eyes with no regret I know your name baby but I forget
my mouth is cruel and my lips are mean,
I'm dirty minded and I'm obscene
but I'll be saved the day I die,
I'll be your muse, I'll be your lie

can I speak?
I will destroy if I speak,
it will destroy how I speak...
I will destroy when I speak yeah
it will destroy you

I see God and he's my friend
but the devil's standing next to him,
he says my name and I feel so weak,
just like a monster who cannot speak,
I'm like a monster...
when I speak am I a monster... when I speak?
you're just a monster when we speak so I'm a monster when I speak...
can I speak? I'll be your monster when we speak
and I'll speak to destroy...
speak and destroy....
speak and destroy yeah.
