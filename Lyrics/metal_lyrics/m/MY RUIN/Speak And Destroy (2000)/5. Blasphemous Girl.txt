GOD...

Drunk with sin she sits in her skin,
Filled with anger fueled by liquer drowns in dreams
With no saviour from the truth none can save her
He is her own personal Jesus and he will not be her last
God wants a piece of her ass
God wants a piece of my ass...

I am...
a blasphemous girl
I am...
a blasphemous girl
I am...
a blasphemous girl
I am...
a blasphemous girl

Magnum mouthed I shoot to kill
You murder me with lies and guilt strangle me...
With tragic hands
God wants a piece of her ass
God wants a piece of my ass...

I am...
a blasphemous girl
I am...
a blasphemous girl
I am...
stab me...
like a stalker rape me...
like a hero stab me...
like a stalker rape me...
and be my hero bless me darling and I will forgive you
eloquent and full of grace you speak in tongues
behind my back a dry lung vocal martyr
I will suffer for my lover
I will suffer for his sins
I will suffer for my lover
I am suffering for him
torture me with timelessness
worship my fist with every kiss
resurection of my pain drag me down our memory lane
introduce me to devotion
leave me numb with no emotion
stars surround you when I feel you
you look better when I cannot see...
you... honesty...
looks good on you but liar should be your tattoo...
