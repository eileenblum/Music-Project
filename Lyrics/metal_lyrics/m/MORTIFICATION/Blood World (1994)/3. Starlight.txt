[CHORUS]
Starlight - starbright
Show me the light
Starlight - starbright
Show me the light
I confess that sometimes
I question how things are
I ask myself as I gaze into the starlight
I know that I will be alright.
But loved ones and friends
I pray will be there too
Life is short - am I aging
When I know I'm still learning
Questions formed - and the answers
There's no mystery
Cause I know the purpose of life
[CHORUS]
[CHORUS]
Murder, lies, deceit
I will follow none of these
Oppressed and consumed
But still my life is free
Life on earth calls for strength
Respect and courage I must build within
Eloi - dawn on me
The dawn of eternity
Eloi - dawn on me
The dawn of eternity
