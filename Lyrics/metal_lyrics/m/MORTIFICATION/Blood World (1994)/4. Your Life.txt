I see your life
You're going nowhere
I see your life
Are you in despair
Fear comes in the night
Afraid of what comes next
What is this life, what is this mess?
[BRIDGE]
My mispent, recompense
What is hope? My despair
Don't want to raise raise my head
Sleep engulfs my pain
What is my release, purpose for this flesh?
[BRIDGE]
Drugged and lost I come
I hear the music play
They speak my release
The new born life
[BRIDGE]
Hope kills my pain - what is this change?
God has come to me, life infills my veins
My new life, I repeat
This is hope, my new way
I see your life
You're going somewhere
I see your life
You're mind is in His hands
