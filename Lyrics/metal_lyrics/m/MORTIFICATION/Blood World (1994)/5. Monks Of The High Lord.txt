We are the order of grinding silence
Leaving the peace as the music subsides
Again impacting with brutal sonics
He will expel the evil of darkness
[CHORUS]
Essence of silence
Monks of the high Lord
Essence of noise
Monks of the high Lord
Feeling cold from a menacing absence
I'm surrounded by a constant noise
I remember my true religion
I adjourn to your peace in the mist
[CHORUS]
[BRIDGE]
I see, the beauty and beast
I feel, your power and beat
I know there is a way
Show me, grinding silence
So many people
Caught in a world of noise
Open your mind and see the sound of the quiet
Live in the grinding silence
A life of sheer extremes
Noise and quiet, life, Lord &amp; peace
What do you worship?
Don't worship gods of wood and steel
[BRIDGE]
Finding solace in the light of your word
Breeding life in the heast of silence
Humming a tune of orchestral essence
Meeting with you in the still of creation
