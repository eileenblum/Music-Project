Bipatrisan joining
Synergy essential
For the purpose of symbiosis
When opposites merge
Mutual benefits emerge
If symbiosis is threatened
Either may loose control
The grafting of the branches
Through the vows of marriage
Interdependance relies
On the covenant of trust
[CHORUS]
Synapse a wondrous gift of God's creation
Synchronous biogenisis the seed of expression
Synapse a wondrous gift of God's creation
Synchronous biogenisis the seed of expression
Under a symposium
Syllogistic settlements
Banish the tear away
Systole rising
[CHORUS]
