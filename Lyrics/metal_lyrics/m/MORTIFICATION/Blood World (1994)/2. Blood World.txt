Hatred wasting mankind
Racism, black and white
Kill your neighbour, what do you care
He is worthless scum
Open your eyes, see the truth
We are all of dust
[CHORUS]
Blood world, the blood of life
Who will care, who will unite?
Blood world, the blood of Christ
All men are equal in his sight
Loneliness destroying lives
Rejected, hated, despised
Kill your neighbour, what do you care
He was born to be lost
A hated man, scorn of your laugh
Seeing yourself first
[CHORUS]
Care, share, be fair, be aware
Christ uniting mankind
Equal black and white
Love your neighbour as yourself
You are your brother's keeper
Open your eyes, see the truth
Hatred is a killer!
[CHORUS]
Care, share, be fair, be aware
