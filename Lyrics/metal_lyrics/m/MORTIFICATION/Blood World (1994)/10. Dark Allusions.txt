Gore
What for
Macabre
Wastelands
Sicknesses are rising from the underground
One man's massacre for one's entertainment
Some may put their ratings on the television
But you cannot censor the imagination
[CHORUS]
Suffering for fantasy
Keeps me wondering if we'll ever see
A sound mind for reality
To discern our dark allusions from insanity
Gore - what for
Macabre - wastelands in your soul
Images of torture te replace the pain
Many can't control promiscuity
Fade away the youth - innocence decays
The dark fruits of sin - mocking undertones
[CHORUS]
