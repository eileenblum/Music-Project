[CHORUS]
I see your face in the dark
Try to believe you're not undone
Seemingly lost you're buried alive
Consider our ways, clan of the light
Clan of the light
We raise our hands to the sky
Clan of the light
We have a destiny
We'll never die or go to hell
[CHORUS]
Our ways are right
We raise our voice in defense
Clan of the light
We have the answer for your life in God
[CHORUS]
Our God is fire
Purging the souls of man
Clan of the light
Changing your way to die or life
[CHORUS]
