Thinking about my life so far
Wondering what will be
I need a life that sets my spirit free
So many choises in the world today
How will I survive
So many people let their spirits die
Living within your guidence
Your ways help me survive
When my mind is with you I'm alive
You are the life within me
Resisting the ways of hate
I pledge to you resistance will never die
Love song
This is it
Don't be consumed by the moment eternal life denied
You cannot fill the void without the fire
Wanting to see the world today
Striving for the prize
Second best is not what you desire
Love song
This is it
Love song
This is it
