I'm not confused, I know where I'm going
I'm not confused, I know where I'm going
Eternity is a very long time
I think about what we will find
Can this be the end of it all
Just this life or is there more
Broken bodies lying on the ground
Broken mind that is not found
Are we just a piece of meat
There must be more than we can see
What is this life that is mine
Muscles and meat hanging on a bone
Are we just a shadow of self
Or are we a product of design
Broken brain walking round the town
Lost at sea nowhere to be found
Live your life as we are drowning
Reaching out to another land
Are we burning, or are we shining
Thinking about burning Thinking about burning
Thinking about shining Thinking about shining
Thinking about burning Thinking about shining
Thinking about burning Thinking about shining
Eternity is a very long time
I think about what we will find
Can this be the end of it all
Just this life or is there more
Broken brain walking round the town
Lost at sea nowhere to be found
Live your life as we are drowning
Reaching out to another land
