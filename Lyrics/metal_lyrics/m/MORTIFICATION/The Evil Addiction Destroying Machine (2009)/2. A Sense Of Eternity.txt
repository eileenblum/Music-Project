The master of reinvention
Finding the way, potential
The master of reinvention
Running around with a head full of words
Sitting around with a tape full of riffs
Seeming ideas, come from the sky
Run through my fingers and run through my mind
More inspiration beyond myself
Messages flowing to my brain cells
The Master is sending a message to me
To share with the world
Salvation scream
Running around with a head full of words
Sitting around with a tape full of riffs
The master is sending a message to me
To share with the world
Salvation scream
