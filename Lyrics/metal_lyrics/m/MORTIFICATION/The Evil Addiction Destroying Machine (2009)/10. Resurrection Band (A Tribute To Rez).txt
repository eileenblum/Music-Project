I thank God for, Resurrection Band
Play your song of Freedom
Help, turn my life around
Walking around, just dazed and confused
Had no direction, no clue what to do
I was on the hell road. Heavy metal blind
Then I heard Rez band, just in time
God hit me like a hammer, blew me off my feet
Heavy rock for Jesus that was what I needed
Inspire a generation of Pure Metal Rock
No indecision, the path I had to take
I salute Resurrection Band
For heeding the call, to sing songs for God
To help save souls, the lost and bewildered
Need not walk blind, just listen to the Jesus Rock
