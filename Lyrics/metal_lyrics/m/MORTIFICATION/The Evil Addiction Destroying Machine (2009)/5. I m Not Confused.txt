One man with courage makes a majority
Killing the demons in the minority
Battle hymns from days of old. Revival
Taking down demonic holds, destroying
Hacking through the evil hordes
Killing demons slash of sword
Evil blood will stain the ground
Victory for those in power
Killing evil in the soul, forever
One man standing to be bold
Destroyer
In his brain he kills the hordes
To his mind he reads the sword
Daily he implores the Lord
To bring holy power
He must not stand alone anymore
Fighting together we bring The Sword
The righteous life now we will employ
Living life as one in The Way
