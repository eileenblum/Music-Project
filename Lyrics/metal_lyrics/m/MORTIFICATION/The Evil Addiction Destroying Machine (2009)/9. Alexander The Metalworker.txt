Alexander The Metalworker
Did a great deal of harm
You should be on your guard against him
The Lord will repay him for what he has done
He has strongly opposed the Message
At my first defence, no one came to support
They all just deserted
Would you be a metalworker
Would you stand up for the Throne
We should find our true perspective
Think about the life we've become
The Lord stood by my side and gave me strength
So that the Message May be proclaimed
God will take me to, His heavenly kingdom
To Him be the glory, forever and ever
I was delivered from the lion's mouth
The Lord rescued me
From every evil attack
