Bad addiction the evil, weeping to torture
Incessant drug addiction taken by the weak
Violent ramifications
Are they just the weakest link of Pharmacia conspiracies
The machine destroying, crushing the system
You must overcome, being taken to trial
You kill the evil desire
You must forgive the system that stole your control
And then kill the demons pushing you to fall
All through the ages, given men to trial
Countless pharmaceuticals to relieve the sickness
But as the goes on and on, some are put to trial
But in the failure of a drug is a man a martyr
Of a system, of a conspiracy
A casualty of war, against the human soul
An incessant plot, to make you deadly sick
...and burn your soul
