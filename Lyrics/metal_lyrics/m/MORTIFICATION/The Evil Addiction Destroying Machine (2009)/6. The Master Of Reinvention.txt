We must see this eternal death
Arriving from a lack of faith
We must find the eternal path
Transcending to our eternal destination
Pilots hanging from shoulder dust
They have no escape plan of action
Pilots hanging from shoulder dust
They have no flight path no direction
Now embrace the holy path
Leading to our eternal home
Now release an act of faith
Believing that Christ has saved our souls
Eternal death, no remorse
Sees us saved if we are lost
Only through the righteous blood
Can we stand to save our souls
Eternal death without repentance
No reprieve, your death sentence
