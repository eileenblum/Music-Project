[Words and Music by Steve Rowe]
[Originally recorded for Post Momentary Affliction]

Wars and famines, A.I.D.S. and broken lives
Drug offenses, damage to bring demise
Bury the dead in their coffins
Mankind is rotting away
Global misconceptions
Lies to steal your life

Lies, wars, hatred, Antichrist

Human condition
It is no superstition
Human condition
In desperate need of God

Privatisation, selling the world away
Abolishing independance
New World Order shall arise
Bury the dead in their coffins
Mankind is rotting away
Cashless world is coming
The beast is on arise

One will rise with false hope
Seeming to solve the crisis
The man of sin, the Antichrist
Bringing the lies of death
Bury the dead in their coffins
Mankind is rotting away
Look in the Bible for answers
Don't accept the false demise

[Luke 21:8,9; 1 Thes. 2:3-11; Revelation 13 (whole chapter)]
