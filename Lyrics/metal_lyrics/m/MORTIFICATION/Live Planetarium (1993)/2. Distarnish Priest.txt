Distarnish Priest
Distarnish Priest
I'm clean, washed in blood
Sanctified inside out
Oh I'm dead to Satan's grasp
Justified by the cross

Vertical convulsion, striven force
Grasp desired service
Hideous onslaught attacks the mind
Vicious intent prevails

Serve your God
Your time will come

Beware the trap of stardom faith
Seek guidance for your life
Do not adorn the priestly robes
Covering filthy manifestation

Guard your heart, bow before God
Sack cloth and ashes repentance
Radical conversion, zeal of love
Put faith in actions

I'm lost, inside your ways
I've found, a new escape
This life, no fantasy
New ways, reality
Always growing, never fading
Hope increasing, peace astounding
Always knowing, never falling
My salvation, making me

Wretched man, that I am
Chronicle thought diseases
My priestly robes must be clean
Pentinence of ministers

Bow at the altar of sacrifice
Living flesh submission
Eucharist served to others passed
Priest of life's maturity

[1 Timothy 3:1-7; Jonah 3 (whole chapter); Psalm 51 (whole psalm) Romans 7:13-25]
