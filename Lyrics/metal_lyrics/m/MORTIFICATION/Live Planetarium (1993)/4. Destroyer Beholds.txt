[Words and Music by Steve Rowe]
[Originally recorded for Mortification]

Disease in your life rots your soul
Wretched hindrance to your growth in God
Recycle countless sin, bondage brings
Wretched hindrance to your growth in God

Look at the young man
Look at his face
What is the reason for this change
Revival in his heart
Causes havoc for the devil

The destroyer beholds

The destroyer beholds

Your faith infested by the flesh
Backslidden in your heart you have no time for God
You don't read the word, what's your case
Backslidden in your heart you have no time for God

Your God calls your name, you've been saved
You won't be tempted beyond your strength
Reach out to His grace, make a change
You won't be tempted beyond your strength

[Romans 3:23, 8:10; Psalm 51:10; Revelation 3:15-16; 1 Cor. 10:13 2 Cor. 12:9]
