[Words and Music by Michael Carlisle]

Bipartisan joining
Synergy essential
For the purpose of symbiosis

When opposites merge
Mutual benefits emerge
If symbiosis is threatened
Either my loose control
The grafting of the branches
Through the vows of marriage
Interdependence relies
On the covenant of trust

Synapse a wondrous
Gift of God's creation
Synchronous biogenesis
The seed of expression

Synapse a wondrous
Gift of procreation
Synchronous biogenesis
The seed of expression
Under a symposium
Syllogistic settlements
Banish the teraway
Systole rising
