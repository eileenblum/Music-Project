[Words and Music by STEVE ROWE]
[Originally recorded for Scrolls Of The Megilloth]

Guidance of our intimacy
Holy love is what I see
Direction from the book of life
Song of songs in the Megilloth

Existence of admiration
Man's part of God's creation
Scrolls of the Megilloth
Scrolls of the Megilloth

David's genealogy
A female friend is she
Ruth is a book of love
To overcome difficulties
Boaz, symbolic of Christ
Redeeming His holy Church

Esther, victory of morals
Over conniving racist king
Sovereignty and great courage
Protection of God's people

Taken to captivity
A sense of tragedy
Jeremiah's Lamentation
Grieving for his nation
Destruction is a logical result
Of defying God

A book of philosophy
Frustration absurdity
Everything has a season
Purposed under Heaven
Ecclesiastes, Solomon's searching
Just like your life
