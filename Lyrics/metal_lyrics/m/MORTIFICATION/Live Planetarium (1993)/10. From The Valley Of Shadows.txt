[Words and Music by Michael Carlisle]
[Originally recorded for Post Momentary Affliction]

"What is truth?", I ask myself
All religions boast absolute truth
But temptation is all that I find
As flesh craves overshadows the emptiness
On through the valley of blindness I roam
As voices whisper in the wind around
Calling me into the darkness beyond
Like the sound of sirens in the distance

From the valley of the shadows
Into the darkness beyond
Feel the calling of pleasures
Overshadow man's emptiness

My guiltiness bleeds internally
Inside tunnels of blocked emotions
The silent screams within my inner being
Bursting forth in desperation

Disillusionment fades
As I change my course
Rejection of pride through repentance
The answer revealed - messeanic deity
The judge paid the sinners debt

From the valley of the shadows
Into the light of Crist
I follow the calling if righteousness
As shadows cringe from the brightness

Peace engulfs me
As I surrender my life
The entwinning of guilt is lifted away
Shadows are scattered by
The Lamb of God
Delivered from the
Abuse of substances

[John 3:16, 18:37,38; Romans 8:23; John 3:20-21]
