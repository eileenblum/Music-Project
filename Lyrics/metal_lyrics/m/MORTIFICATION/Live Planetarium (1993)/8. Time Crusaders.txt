[Words and Music by Steve Rowe]

Time Crusaders

Time Crusaders, minstrels of ancient worship
Time Crusaders, tunes from the heart of God

The musicians lead the armies to war
Sounding the battle cry
Leading on to victory
Ancient times of scripture

Playing the strings of healing
Soothing the king's torment
The harp was David's sword
Piercing the pain of Saul

The red shield raised in the streets
Playing the music from the bars
Meeting men's desperate needs
Playing music to which they relate

Many have gone before us
Heeding the call to play
Totally relevant music
Meeting the need of the hour

The progress of eons has passed
We see that music lives on
God created all styles
Satan has only perverted

We are the bearers of news
Grinding the truth to your ears
Seeking new ways to destroy
The lies that live in your mind

William Booth's speech:
Many people like to sit
Within the sound of the church bell
But I'd rather run a rescue shop
Within a yard of Hell

Time Crusaders

[Mark 16:15; 2 Chron. 20:21-22; 1 Sam. 16:14-23; Psalm 150]
