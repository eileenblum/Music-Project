[1 Timothy 4:1-3, 2 Tim. 3:1-5, 2 Cor. 11:13-14]

Fascination with the stars
Consequences of the crystal factor
Answers to life are far
Looking for hope in all the wrong places

[Bridge 1]
Destined to die, lost in lies, fated
Hating your life, answers none taken

Transcendental meditation
Separation to the new age
Satan has bound your mind
The angel of light transfixion

[Bridge 1 repeat]

[Chorus]
And there'll be peace in the galaxy
when people trust the truth in Christianity, Sanctity

[Chorus repeat x 1.5]

Situation of change
You must arise and forsake
Satanic lies of today
Arise and embrace the glory

[Bridge 2]
Destined for life, found in Christ, salvation
Loving your life, answers all taken

[Chorus repeat x 2]
