[Verse 1]
Liberal Mediocrity
Taking from The Word is a disgrace.
Politically Correct,
Tickle the ears and kill the faith.

[Chorus]
Rightly divide The Word of Truth,
Profit for doctrine and reproof,
Rightly divide The Word of Truth,
understand Scripture and it?s use.

[Verse 2]
Liberal Mediocrity
Modernistic tainted by the world.
Politically Correct,
Open mind is poisoned to death.

[Chorus repeat]

[Verse 3]
Read it, live it.
The Lord is coming for a spotless church.
Repentant, forgiven.
Not deceived by words of man.

[Chorus repeat]
