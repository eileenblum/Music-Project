[Hebrews 10:23-25]

The congregation of the weeping saints
should never be allowed to be forsaken
The suffering and sorrow, the pain of our tomorrows
can be healed by prayer and love amazing

[Prechorus]
Fear the enemy of our faith
Clean your life of lonely breath
Lifting silent prayer be made
In comfort congregate

[Chorus]
Chapel of Hope, a haven for our souls
Chapel of Hope, together we stand tall

The instigation of fear against our faith
can bring out the weakness tomorrow
Gathering in comfort, the prayer of our fathers
covering the weakness in our souls of life

[Prechorus repeat]

[Chorus repeat x 2]

The supplication, prayers of the priest
covering the holy congregation
The intercession for the mass of God
prepares the spirits of the faithful

[Chorus repeat]

Chapel of Hope [x5]
