[Part 1. Lymphosarcoma]

Kills immunity
Rapes the blood and bone of humanity
Being a living corpse
Grey and scaly skin
Haunted human ghost

Lymphosarcoma
God extracted you
Lymphosarcoma
Never to return

[Part 2. The Destroyer Beholds]

Disease in your life rots your soul
Wretched hindrance to your growth in God
Recycle countless sin, bondage brings
Wretched hindrance to your growth in God

Look at the young man
Look at his face
What is the reason for this change
Revival in his heart
Causes havoc for the devil

The destroyer beholds

The destroyer beholds

Your faith infested by the flesh
Backslidden in your heart you have no time for God
You don't read the word, what's your case
Backslidden in your heart you have no time for God

[Psalm 51:10]
[Romans 8:2]
[Revelation 3:15&amp;16]
[I Cor 10:13]
[II Cor 12:9]

[Part 3. Distarnished Priest]

Distarnish Priest
Distarnish Priest
I'm clean, washed in blood
Sanctified inside out
Oh I'm dead to Satan's grasp
Justified by the cross

[VERSE ONE]

Vertical convulsion, striven force
Grasp desired service
Hideous onslaught attacks the mind
Vicious intent prevails

[BRIDGE]

Serve your God
Your time will come
Beware

[VERSE TWO]

Guard your heart, bow before God
Sack cloth and ashes repentance
Radical conversion, zeal of love
Put faith in actions

[1 Timothy 3:1-7]
[Jonah 3 (Whole chapter)]
[Psalm 51 (Whole psalm)]
[Romans 7:13-25]

[Part 4. Love Song]

Thinking about my life so far
Wondering what will be
I need a life that sets my spirit free
So many choices in the world today
How will I survive
So many people let their spirits die

Living within your guidance
Your ways help me survive
When my mind is with you I'm alive
You are the life within me
Resisting the ways of hate
I pledge to you resistance will never die

Love song
This is it

Don't be consumed by the moment eternal life denied
You cannot fill the void without the fire
Wanting to see the world today
Striving for the prize
Second best is not what you desire

Love song
This is it
Love song
This is it
