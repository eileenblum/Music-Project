[Verse 1]
David made a covenant with Jonathan
A promise of trust, the spilling of blood
Slaughter the heifer, walk between two parts
Off with my head if I break the oath.

[CHORUS]
Mephibosheth
Blood covenant

[Verse 2]
Jonathan died in battle
David, ascend to the throne
Mephibosheth a cripple
Son of Jonathan lost
Left behind as they fled
Oath of death upon David's head

[CHORUS]

[BRIDGE]
The search went out for Mephibosheth
Caught, imprisoned, cursing rebel
Brought before King David's throne
Thought that death was imminent
David remembers the covenant oath
He'll show kindness to Jonathan's house
Seen as now the son of the king
All that was Saul's would now be his

[Verse 3]
You are Mephibosheth
David, symbolic of God
Your resisting His throne
The blessing of the blood covenant
Christ died for you, you don't even know

[CHORUS]
