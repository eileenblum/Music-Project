[Romans 6:1-12, Romans 6:16, Ephesians 2:1-10]

Ripped off by the the fears of your mind
Buried without release
Christ's love brings healing
False fear erased
[Chorus]
Battle of the flesh to overcome your fear
Believe in release, face your fears and win

Unfulfilled in the call of your life
No faith in your cause
Believing the lie that you are nought
Can you ever succeed

[Chorus repeat]

Buried into obscurity

Hold your faith power, push your fear down

Beating the fears with your faith
Lifting the holy cause
God can surely use your life
when you're bold in heart

[Chorus repeat]

Raised into eternity
Hold your faith power, push your fear down

[Verse 1 repeat]
[Chorus repeat]
