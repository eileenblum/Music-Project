Those who seek after fame put others down,
climb the heights of your dream to be proclaimed.
The world doesn't need any more stars exalting self.
The world needs more people of faith.

Influence in your life,
we done want the fame we want salvation,
influence for the cross,
unity of faith across the nations.

Make the way of the cross your life goal
pull the man from his grave to be revived.
Millions of hopeless troden people
there is hope in the saving blood of Christ,

Go into all the world
and preach the gospel
to every listener
and to all who believe
in Jesus Christ
will be saved
but they who do not believe,
will be condemned.

see the light in the eyes of the holyman.
can't you see that the rivers flow within,
why be lost in a sea of hate and lust,
we can tell you the change is now in Christ.

[Chorus repeat]

Now be born to a new life,
certain hell awaits the lost.
The utter pain without God in eternity
is more than a thousand lashes could toll.

[Chorus repeat X 2]
