[Words and Music - Steve Rowe]

Hatred wasting mankind, racism, black and white
Kill your neighbour, what do you care, he is worthless scum
Open your eyes, see the truth, we are all of dust

Blood world, the blood of life
Who will care, who will unite?
Blood world, the blood of Christ
All men are equal in his sight

Loneliness destroying lives, rejected, hated, despised
Kill your neighbour, what do you care, he was born to be lost
A hated man, scorn of your laugh, seeing yourself first

Care, share, be fair, be aware

Christ uniting mankind, equal black and white
Love your neighbour as yourself, you are your brother's keeper
Open your eyes, see the truth, hatred is a killer
