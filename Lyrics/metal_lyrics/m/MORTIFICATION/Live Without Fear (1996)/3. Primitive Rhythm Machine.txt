[Words &amp; Music - Steve Rowe]

Primitive Rhythm Machine, it's the true, rhythm of
the natives, tho wholy rhythm. God creates, jungle beats
Evil, only perverts

African tribes, L.A. gangs, Australian natives
Europeans will know about
Salvation, the time has come to change your ways
Throw your conceptions out, look to people, not yourself
High and mighty, that's not right. God created all things

That's all men
That's all music
That's everything

Glacial dwellers, South Americans, tribal people
All men must know about
Salvation, the time has come to change your ways
All this music will all pass, it's just part of this world
God's music of all nations. All parts of God's creation

Hard music, soft sounds, street beats
Music crowds will know about
Salvation, the time has come, to change your ways
Look beyond a culture style, yourself on what's right
You must turn around, to know your Creator

Heavy, music, rhythm, God's way
