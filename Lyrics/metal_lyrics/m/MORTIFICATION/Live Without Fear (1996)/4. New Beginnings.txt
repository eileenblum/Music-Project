[Words &amp; Music - Steve Rowe]

At the dawn of time
God made man
He made a covenant
Perfect plan

Man disobeyed from the very first age
Now need Jesus to be saved
With sin you must now be finished
Make way for new beginnings

All through history
Man's hated God
Abominations
Like Sodom's lust

New beginnings
In your life
New beginnings
Born again

The western world
Is just like Sodom
You'd better change now
Or face judgement

Many have chosen
Eternal death
Many have chosen
Eternal life
