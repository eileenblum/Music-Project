[Words &amp; Music - Steve Rowe]

Grind planetarium
Pride, lacerated from my mind
Grind planetarium
New, destroying all that is blind deceit

Mortification
Bringing forth flesh denial
Stardom farces
Capture those of false arise

Manipulation of other to
Bring about succes
Abomination
Those of flesh will see you're false

Christian warfare
Kill the stars exalt the cause
Mass exposure
Is what we want but for our Lord
