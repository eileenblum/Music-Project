Do you feel it is your time?
Do you feel it in your life?
Have you seen it in your mind?
Calling to eternal life
Days and days you're asking why
Am I empty all the time
Suddenly a ray of Light
As you hear the truth of Christ
Christ is the truth in the way of your time
Following the path to eternal life
No other way to find the hope
Now is your time, you must decide
Now you have taken your time
Christ eternal in your life
You decided to be found
Holy Spirit in your soul
