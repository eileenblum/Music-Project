Signing the paper of death
They say I could be dead
Cry out for his mercy
His healing power to live
There I sit in the black room
Signing the paper of death
Drugs and radiation
Will destroy my blood
Except for a miracle
I will die a hideous painful death
As I await the box of wax
They prepare to flick the switch
Radiation shreds my blood
Drugs rot my body
Donation cells are given
To restore my state
Kneel in my bed, dripping with blood
The treatment has taken its toll
Demons round me laughing
As the pain of hate fills my bones
Suddenly a figure in white
Ten foot tan from God
Spreads his wings, sword in hand
Chope those demons down
Slime and gore oozes the floor
As they all lie dead
As the months grow longer
Satan plans his next attack
Broken down with many disease
Feel I'm about to die, rotting bones in pain
Suddenly a break through, the power of Jesus name
Brought back from the dead I come
Now to proclaim his ways
No devil stomps on God's child and ever gets away
Dead man walking
Satan still stalking
Don't try again you loser
I will live forever
