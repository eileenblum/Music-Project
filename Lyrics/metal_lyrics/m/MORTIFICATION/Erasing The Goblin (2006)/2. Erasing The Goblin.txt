Erasing the goblin, pointing the finger at you
Erasing the goblin, squirming to see you remove,
His destructive power in your life,
Erasing the goblin; taking control of your mind.
What is the goblin trying to steal your soul?
That tiny sin that is growing all the time,
Closer each day, you walk to his embrace,
Now is the time to spear his ugly guts
Where is the goblin that once ruled your life?
You gave him up through the power of Christ
No more hold does his power have on you
Erasing the goblin today we must all choose
The goblin is bleeding. The goblin is dying.
Once he is dead, continually erasing that sin,
Continually erase that sin, continually erase that sin
