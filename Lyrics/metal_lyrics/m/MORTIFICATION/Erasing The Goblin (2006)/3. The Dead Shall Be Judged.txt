Your wicked ways, shall be displayed
Before the God of Heaven, have you repented?
This life is short, in the spectrum of time
Will you embrace, Christ for your redemption?
Without His Blood, washed upon your soul
You cannot be saved, into the pit you're thrown
Now is time, now is the day
No more excuses, time will not delay
The dead shall be judged
Are you on the narrow path?
You must account for your days
Before the Throne of Grace
The dead shall be judged
Redeemed only by The Blood
Now accept the Lamb of God
Or you'll burn in the lake of fire
Your wicked ways, shall be displayed
Before the God of Heaven, have you repented?
Now is the time, now is the day
No more excuses, time will not delay
