People aiming every arrow
But cannot get through the skin
Raw hide of the years of service
Standing strongly for The King
Why not stop the pointless onslaught
We already know who wins
Evil defeated on the cross
Two thousand years of demons lost
Curses flying from the evil
Hatred from the darkest wing
Nothing stops the Jesus calling
Nothing kills the strongest will
When will you turn from your hatred?
Just accept that God will win
You have just to say a prayer and
To your heart God enters in
Razorback of Authority
Razorback sees us remain
Nothing penetrating the skin
Onward we march unto the end
Sick and filthy evil concepts
Who do you think you impress?
Not considering the young ones
Copy just the evil path
One million boring same expressions
Then you face the day of wrath
It is not too late for your soul
Now is the time to repent
