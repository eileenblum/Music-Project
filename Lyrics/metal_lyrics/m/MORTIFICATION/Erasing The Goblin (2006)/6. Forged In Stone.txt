Forged in stone!
I am forged in stone
My foundations on The Word
Christ the basis of the way
Forged in stone to build my life
This fortress of the way
Shout the truth around the world
Foundation upon the throne
Monument of solid gold
This stone, the solid way
Never breaking, no decay
Build your life upon this rock
Forged in stone, eternal life
Christ salvation, Jesus blood
Poured upon a world of sin
Dripping down to build your stone
Life upon unbreaking truth
