Born into the ritualistic
Blasphemous way of life
Your parents are the priests
Of the practice of Antichrist
Abusive situation
You hear the toll of the bell
Running to Jesus
You escape your living hell
Running through the forest
Running for your life
Running from the evil
Into the arms of Christ
Born again into The Faith
Of the ways of Christ
Down upon your knees
You escape into the light
No more hold
Does Satan have on you
The practice of evil
Cannot destroy your life
Running through the forest
Running for your life
Running from the evil
Into the arms of Christ
Escape the blasphemous tabernacle
Escape the blasphemous tabernacle
Escaping your world of sorrow
Entering the path of your new tomorrows
Finding the only way of escape
Finding Christ, or your certain death
