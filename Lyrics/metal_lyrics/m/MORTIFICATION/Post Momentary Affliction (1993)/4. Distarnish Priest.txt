[CHORUS]
Distarnish Priest
Distarnish Priest
I'm clean, washed in blood
Sanctified inside out
Oh I'm dead to Satan's grasp
Justified by the cross

[VERSE ONE]

Vertical convulsion, striven force
Grasp desired service
Hideous onslaught attacks the mind
Vicious intent prevails

[BRIDGE]

Serve your God
Your time will come

[VERSE TWO]

Guard your heart, bow before God
Sack cloth and ashes repentance
Radical conversion, zeal of love
Put faith in actions

[INTERLUDE]

I'm lost, inside your ways
I've found, a new escape
This life, no fantasy
New ways, reality
Always growing, never fading
Hope increasing, peace astounding
Always knowing, never falling
My salvation, making me

[CHORUS]

[VERSE FOUR]

Wretched man, that I am
Chronicle thought diseases
My priestly robes must be clean
Pentinence of ministers

[BRIDGE]

[VERSE FIVE]

Bow at the altar of sacrifice
Living flesh submission
Eucharist served to others passed
Priest of life's maturity

[CHORUS]
