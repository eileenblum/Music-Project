[VERSE ONE]
Impulsation
Smash and grab world
Impulsation
Live fast, die young
You'll not find real satisfaction
You'll find emptiness
Fake gratification

[VERSE TWO]

Impulsation
Patience never learned
Impulsation
Satisfaction now
Can't you see, this won't last
lasting peace comes from Christ

[CHORUS]

You'll find self-control
If you find salvation
Blood and the fire purge your mind
Ultimate satisfaction, real peace
Lasting joy comes through Christ
White wash your mind
Find your release

[BRIDGE]

Bludgeon to death lust in your life
Consecrate to live right
Manifest the grace of God
Supplicate prayer and love

[LEAD BREAK]

[VERSE THREE]

Impulsation
It's not cool
Impulsation
You could die
Can't you see people dying
Everyday A.I.D.S. and drug addictions
[CHORUS]
