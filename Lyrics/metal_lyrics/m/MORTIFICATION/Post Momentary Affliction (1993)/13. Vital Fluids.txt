[VERSE ONE]
Drowned in the water of the spirit
Till it follows from our gasp
Engulfed, it takes our breath
Till every word flows with life

[CHORUS]

Liquid assets
Liquid assets
Liquid assets
Vital fluids

[VERSE TWO]

Aquatic regurgitation
Cannot hold it in
We are full of health
Can't get too much of this good thing

[CHORUS]

[BRIDGE]

If anyone is thirsty
Come to Christ and drink
Whoever believes in Christ
Living water flows from him

[VERSE THREE]

Everyone who drinks water
Will be thirsty again
Drink the water of life
Welled up streams for eternity

[CHORUS]

[BRIDGE]
