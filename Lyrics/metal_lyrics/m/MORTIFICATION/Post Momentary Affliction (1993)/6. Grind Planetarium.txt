[CHORUS]
Grind planetarium
Pride, lacerated from my mind
Grind planetarium
New, destroying all that is blind deceit

[VERSE ONE]

Mortification
Bringing forth flesh denial
Stardom farces
Capture those of false arise

[CHORUS]

[VERSE TWO]

Manipulation of other to
Bring about succes
Abomination
Those of flesh will see you're false

[MUSICAL BRIDGE]
[CHORUS]

[VERSE THREE]

Christian warfare
Kill the stars exalt the cause
Mass exposure
Is what we want but for our Lord

[CHORUS]
[MUSICAL BRIDGE]
