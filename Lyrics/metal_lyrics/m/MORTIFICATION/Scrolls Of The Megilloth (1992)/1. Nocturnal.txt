Nocturnal
Creatures of the night
Nocturnal
Creatures of the night

Illuminate
The sky in the dark of the night
Stalk our prey
When people are asleep
Eliminate
The legions of the grave
From their minds
Ripping hatred

Nocturnal
Creatures of the night
Nocturnal
Creatures of the night

Eviction
We're plundering the dark
Kill their ways
Of death upon the mind
Invaders
They must be put to death
No more lies
Killing wisdom

Nocturnal
Creatures of the night
Nocturnal
Creatures of the night

Eradicate
Effects of demon power
Bind the grip
Of death upon the soul
Infiltrate
The words of hope and faith
To the lost
Bringing Jesus

[Mark 16:15-18]
