The smoke of torment forever arises
Surrounded by screaming I gnash my teeth in agony
My soul's tormented, body cries aloud
I'm trapped within the walls of death

Looking back I wish I'd kept to the path
The narrow road entering the eternal dawn
The water of life which flows from the throne
And fruit unspoiled by the pests of the earth

I long for the return of the pure
Stolen from the man-forsaken garden of creation

And the stray wander toward the hideous flame
As pleasure blows without direction in the wind

Pray for the stray and their rebellion from truth
Freedom from chains and the ritual abuse
I know their affliction the distortion of nature
I once drank the blood in vain of my life

You have the answer that they try to ignore
You're in tune with the spirit while they're filled
with a void

My soul screams in the mass of the flame
As I reap my reward
