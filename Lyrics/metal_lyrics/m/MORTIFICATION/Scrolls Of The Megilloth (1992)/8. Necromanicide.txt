Communication with the dead
Contact with those in the grave
Reaching out to whom they've lost
Morbid existence will count the cost

Divination they will use
A seance they will not refuse
Now be seated and concentrate
Then hold hands to seal your fate

Rotting corpses buried deep
Decomposing in a mangled heap
Unable to speak at all
Only demons answer their call

Necromanicide

Feel the violent surge of pain
Flowing through your body's frame
Demons of hell invading you
Left alone, what can you do

Rotting corpses buried deep
Decomposing in a mangled heap
Unable to speak at all
Only demons answer their call

Necromanicide
Necromanicide

I am no relation of yours but one spawned
From the depths of hades whose task is to deceive you

This foul practice must be stopped
Before your cadaver starts to rot
Fall prostrate before the cross
Bathe in the blood of the sacrifice

Rotting corpses buried deep
Decomposing in a mangled heap
Unable to speak at all
Only demons answer their call

Necromanicide
Necromanicide
Necromanicide
