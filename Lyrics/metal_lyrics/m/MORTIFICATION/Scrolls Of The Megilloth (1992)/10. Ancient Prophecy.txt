Behold the ancient scripture brought forth a prophecy
Revealed in the testament of old for all mankind to see

The prophet Isaiah foretold long ago
The coming of a man who would heal their land

He assumed a servant's nature written in Isaiah 53
He grew in wisdom and stature
Healed many and set them free

Torment and pain gripped the land
Desperation of release grew strong
The prophet saw the time was near
Impending deliverance for which they longed

The prophet Isaiah foretold long ago
Bloodied crucifixion would bring forth redemption

Behold the prophecy revealed before you
Testifies of blood spilt from butchered arteries
Mangled beyond human likeness
Shredded meat hanging from his skeletal cage
This Blood spraying from a mass of twisted flesh
Brings forth redemption to partake you must receive
Do it now before you die or pay the price
Make a step toward God or be destroyed

Surely He hath borne our griefs, weakness and distress
And carried our sorrows and pain
Yet we ignorantly considered Him stricken
Smitten by God and afflicted
But He was wounded for our transgressions
He was bruised for our guilt and iniquities
The chastisement needed to obtain peace and well-being
For us was upon Him and with the lashings and torment
That butchered Him we are healed and made complete

He assumed a servants nature written in Isaiah 53
He grew in wisdom and stature
Healed many and set them free

Ancient writings formed on parchment conceived
Beyond the realm of time
Fulfilment yet to be achieved time
Unfolds to reveal completion

The prophet Isaiah foretold long ago
Blood justification
Spiritual completion
This Blood spraying from a mass of twisted flesh
Brings forth redemption to partake you must receive
Do it now before you die or pay the price
Make a step toward God or be destroyed

[Isaiah 53:4-5]
