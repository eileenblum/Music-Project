Kills immunity
Rapes the blood and bone of humanity
Being a living corpse
Grey and scaly skin
Haunted human ghost

Lymphosarcoma
God extracted you
Lymphosarcoma
Never to return

Takes away the hair
Takes away the life
You infernal beast
Years of suffering
Years of vomiting
Wretched agony

Who's your enemy
Chemotherapy, is that all
Through a chain of prayer
We will break your spell
We attack you now

With your fading strength
You cause doctors to doubt the
Healing done
Fighting from both sides
Agonizing years
We stand on the blood

Christ has evicted
Stripped and killed you
Years of war you have not won
Years later proof has shown
Total healing through his blood

Lymphosarcoma never to return
[Isaiah 53:5]
