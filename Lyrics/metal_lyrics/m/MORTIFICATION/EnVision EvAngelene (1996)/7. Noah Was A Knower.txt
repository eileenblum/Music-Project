[Genesis 6:1-9 and Genesis 7]
[Chorus]
Noah was a knower, he knew the heart of God
Noah was a knower, to build the wooden ark [x2]
All the animals crawling on the ground
couldn't help that man had fallen
God looked down with an awful frown,
knew he must bring lots of water
Drown the sins there to be found
Man had disobeyed his calling
There is someone who is holy
He must work to save the animals

[Chorus repeat]

Noah was praying, just hanging around
shut his face from all who'd fallen
God said build the Ark right now,
save the animals from the water
Noah had faith in God's command
even though he'd never seen thunder
Got to working with his family

building the Ark

[Chorus repeat]

100 years of banging tools
Laughed at by his neighbours scorn
40 days and 40 nights
Smelly animals all around

[Middle bit]
God's calling is always a challenge
It may not be what you would seem
But following his ways through life
ends up leading to the mountain top

Heard the animals two by two
Chooks and cows and kangaroos
Close the doors as rain comes down
All his neighbours start to drown
As the boat began to rock
all the sin was washed away
100 years of real hard work
Noah sat down and had a coffee

Finally the waters went
Noah was on the mountain top
The rainbow came as a new promise
God would show his mercy often

[Middle bit repeat]

[Chorus repeat]
