[Part 1 - Musical Prelude - Emaculate Conception]
[Part 2 - Musical Prelude 2 - The Imminent Messiah]

[Part 3 - Persecuted Quest]

[Luke 1 and 2]
We see the pain and glory of the Son of man
Virgin birth brought him for mankind
Heal the sick and drive demons from the possessed
Awesome to see, finally your plan

For mankind, your glory is revealed
Though some heed him, many cause him pain

The lost shall be found, in weakness they are strong
Those who long for life, flock to his side
where love is nigh

[Part 4 - The words at the supper]

[Luke 22:14-23]
Now what's this sudden word
What's he mean God when he speaks of death
Surely you would not subject him
to that of which he speaks
We cannot see what's the plan of this
He's shown your awesome glory to the world of man
They don't even heed it

You see the wretched sin, why send your son to die
If these words he speaks are true?
You are not answering us God
Please reveal to us your mind
Did you really send him to suffer and to die?

Take the wine and take the bread, he says
Do this in my rememberance
What is he saying? We won't let him die
We'll be there at his call, demons will not take him

One of you will betray me and one of you deny
we've heard him speak this way
Angelic presence, we must rise and attack
demons against the Son of man

Surely he will not resign
Surely he will not resign
Surely not!!!

[Part 5 - Angelic Sufferance]

[Luke 23:26-49, Luke 15, Luke 53:7, Mark 15:34]
Fear and terror fill our skies
Demons gather against us
In formation we rise
The power of God is with us
We wield it with force
The Holy Spirit is beneath us
but wait, what's this?

They whip him, they scourge him
with hatred in their eyes
They beat him, they mock him
tearing at his face
They've hung him, they punch him,
blood gushes from his mouth
Why doesn't he cry out, we are ready and waiting
to cut those people down driven by demons
Satan is prevailing, God He is not calling
God He is not calling, God He is not calling!!!

Frantically we return and gush through heaven's gate
Gabriel hysterical, order in your ranks
We turn to the Father, His face not moved
We cry out WHY! We can hardly believe
Lord, please commission us, commission us
Commission us, please, God!!!

We see the nails burst the holy flesh
with holy godly hatred we seethe against satan
The Son of man hangs, the blackness folds around
The Father cries and turns
NO!!! we cry out
What is this, save him we plead
Save Him, Save Him, Save Him!!!

Sudden silence, God hangs his head
In crushing pain we fall

[Part 6 - Angelic Resurgence]

[Mark 16:1-8, Revelation 1:12-18]
Myriads rise expectant
We look down with hope filled eyes
We cannot believe the sight
Alright! Alright!!!

Jesus has risen, He's come back to life
He's taken the keys to death and hell
Now we can see, sorry for the doubt
The death of Christ to save the souls of man
Oh God, what a plan!
Every knee shall bow, man will not doubt
after seeing His victory
Alright! Lookout!

Here comes the Christ
In clouds of grace we embrace
Total exhilaration on angelic faces
The Son of man has returned in victory over death
Yes!!! [Lead solo]

[Part 7 - Frustrated Vision]

[1 Peter 4:12-16]
Lust and fear and hate and pain reign across the land
God, let us kill the ways, annihilate the plan
Wars, death, famine, aids, man accepts the pain
Only your saints prevail, renew, revive their light

[Part 8 - Please Tarry]

[1 Peter 5:8-9, 2 Cor. 10:3-6, Rev. 20:11-15]
The church is on the rise
God, the ones who know the light
We stand by their side, in affliction we fight
The demons work all night
They know the time is short, warfare in sight
But many more will come
We know the time is near, when Jesus you return
God we question You no more
But please tarry, more are coming
and your saints are faithful

The day is nigh!!!
