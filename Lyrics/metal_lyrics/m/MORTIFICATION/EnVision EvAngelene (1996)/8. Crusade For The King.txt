[2 Corinthians 10:3, Ephesians 6:10-13]
[Chorus]
Crusader, Crusade for the King
Immortal, set fire to the world
The love of our faith, the Saviour
Hating the ways of evil
Darkness descends on battle, crushing extremes
The Sword of the Spirit, equip us
to keep our heart of freedom
Cover the sky with angels sovereignly prayed

[Chorus repeat]

Now rend your heart with solace
Satanic force will die
Saving our souls in battle, our Christian faith
Living with reign of Jesus, breaking the legions
Evil in horror, their fatal grave

[Bridge]
Your blood, the saints, cover your soul
Offer your life to Christ, Eternal

Cover the blood of the saints
with the power of God
Offer your life to Chrust, your soul eternal
Kill the ways of hell, starve the evil
Raise the word, defiance, plunder Beelzebub

[Chorus repeat]

[Interlude - Eph. 6:10-13]
Finally my brethren, be strong in the Lord
and in the power of His might
Put on the whole armour of God
that you may be able to stand
Against the wiles of the devil
for we do not wrestle against flesh and blood
but against principalities and powers
Against the rulers of the darkness of this age
Against spiritual hosts of wickedness
in heavenly places
[Verse 1 repeat]

[Bridge repeat]

[Chorus repeat]
