[Words &amp; Music by Jayson Sherlock]

Behold the one called Lucifer eternally damned
In caverns of despair
His mind infested with hate for you
May every soul of his death be aware

We reject you Satan the prince of hate
You'll pay dearly for the atrocities you've done
Your head will be crushed and vile gore spurt
It'll be all over for all who hate the Son

Choose not to die
Choose after-life

Vengeance is mine saith Almighty God
Whatever you sow you'll reap
Unlimited power is found in Christ
You must arise from your deceptive sleep

Come before the writhing flames
Witness the death of your spell
For Satan is stripped of strength and power
Left helpless to burn forever

Soldiers of hate on the war path to doom
Victims of their decision to deny
Destructive consequences befall the denier
Almighty will reveal to them why
No more sacrifices required
Away with your satanic attire
Wake up mislead children of wrath
Escape the consequence of the fire

Must you prolong this charade of gore
The hands of time in continual movement
The scum of the earth that you call master
Has already been defeated

Behold all this of which we speak
Is genuine warning to those who'll listen
Illusion or fantasy this is neither
Decide for Christ you must hasten
