[Words &amp; Music by Michael Carlisle]

As I await my time
I assume the responsability
With my heart in Christ
His direction is revealed to me

He gives me eyes to see
Real life reality
Living day by day
Along His chosen way

I used to follow idols
Things upon the earth
They added up to my selfishness
I learned that Christ must be first

Spiritual maturity is what we require
Eternity proceeds our death resist the rebels desire
You need to make a stand
Get on your knees and pray
Turn from your selfish past
Put your pride away
Seek God with all your heart
Listen to His voice
Satan has denied the truth
You must make a choice

To take your life away from Christ
What's it really worth
To exit from eternal life
And die upon the earth
