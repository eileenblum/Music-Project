[Words &amp; Music by Jayson Sherlock]

Blood poured out for you
Blood poured out for me
The blood of Christ that is
The blood that set us free

Blemished we are no more
Cleansed as white as snow
Redeemed by the sacrifice
Almighty power you know

Death has been destroyed
It has been overcome
Complete annihilation
By the Holy One

You can now enter
Into God's kingdom
Do it before you die
Now is the time

[Eph 1:7]
[Col 1:14]
[Isaiah 1:18]
[Eph 1:7]
[Luke 12:32]
