[Words &amp; Music by Jayson Sherlock]

Welcome to the Kingdom of God
You've made the best choice for your life
Now you'll never be alone
'Cause He always will be with you

It's easy to fall and sin
But that won't please the Master
So stay close to His side
And you'll never be harmed

There's no return
To things of the past
There's no return
Old ways are now dead

Do not return to your vomit
Just like a dog in disgrace
There are better things in this life
Pursue them and you'll reap rewards

Now go and share with others
What God has done for you
If they care not for your new life
They will receive God's judgement

Do not return to your past
For your past is now dead
