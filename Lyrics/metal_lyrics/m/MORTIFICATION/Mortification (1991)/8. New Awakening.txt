[Words &amp; Music by Michael Carlisle]

Eradication of disobedience
The lake of fire for the dying soul
The crucifiction brings true remission
Eternal life the eternal goal
Christ descended and took the keys
Enthroned majestic God's right hand
The great comission children of God
You eyes on Jesus you of faithful witness

Are you willing to learn
Rise up people with power
Are you ready to burn
With fire from on high

I won't choose pleasures of sin
For a short time
I won't betray the sacrifice
That Christ made for me
No excuse to enter the state of sin
I will not turn away

Satan's name exposes all he is to be
Reprobate with no authority
There is only one name by which you may be saved
That's the name of Jesus Christ
You must realize death is the result of sin
Seek God's forgiveness seek it down within
