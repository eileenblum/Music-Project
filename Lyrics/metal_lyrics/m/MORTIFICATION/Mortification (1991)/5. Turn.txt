[Words &amp; Music by J. Sherlock]

Death, hell, torment suffering
Will overcome you unless you turn to Christ

Pain, anguish, endless destruction
Will overcome you unless you turn to Him

Hellish deception, visions of horror
Will overcome you unless you turn to Christ

Mental mutilation, demonic oppression
Will overcome you unless you turn to Him

So turn to Him
