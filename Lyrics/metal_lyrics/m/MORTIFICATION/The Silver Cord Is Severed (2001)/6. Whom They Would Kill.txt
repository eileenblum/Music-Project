Will you greet a stranger
Not of this world
Who finds it strange here
Who's not at home? 
Who won't fit in
Who's called a fool
Who lives despised
Whom they would kill? 
If you'd place yourself
In his place yourself
You'd find what he's found
Be gone where he's bound 
You'd find relief
With your believe
Happy to be strange
You'll be at peace
