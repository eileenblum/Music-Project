Fold your hands, fold your hands,
Drop the past 
Access denied, success defiled 
Fold your hands, fold your hands,
Drop the past, time for change,
Different stage, a new level. 
Night falls on your heart 
Fold your hands, fold your hands
Raise your eyes, time has come,
Now it's done, raise your eyes 
Access, new ground,
Confess, you're found 
Light force on your heart
