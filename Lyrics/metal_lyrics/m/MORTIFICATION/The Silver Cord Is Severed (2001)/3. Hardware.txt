Hardware, tools we need to build new life
Hardware, rusted veins need revive
Hardware, holes in our mind of pain
Hardware, the word of life in our brain 
Just take a walk down the narrow road
Ignore exits, stay on course
The road map leads the way
To life in a brighter day
Nine more hours to a new millennium
Stop on the roadside pray a prayer
Time to reflect on my past life
Drive again to make a new start 
Trouble playing on the record player
Somber sounds on a cloudy day
Run to the light they sing with hope
Searching for a brighter day
Tools of the word a timeless help
Milleniums pass, all things change
Like the vinyl on the record player
Old things pass but the hardware stays
