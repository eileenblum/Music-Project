The church of steel,
Standing for God,
Preaching the word
The way of faith,
Breaking the death.
Never afraid. 
Metal blessing, blessing
Metal blessing, blessing 
Metallic Faith,
Rising in ways,
Not to be beat.
His way of iron,
Searching for wisdom
Gaining his favour 
Satan stalking,
Hates the faithful,
Church still standing, in the fight
Steel of thunder, in our footsteps,
As we stamp out, hate from earth 
Pounding the walls,
Heeding the call,
Boldly wrought.
Armour of steel,
Quenching the darts, of the evil
