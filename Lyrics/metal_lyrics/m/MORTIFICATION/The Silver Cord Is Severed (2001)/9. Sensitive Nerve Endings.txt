Sensitive nerve endings, endings
Evil on my spine attacking, attacking 
The way of hate may break my spine
Grace sufficient in this time
Miracles daily come my way
Patience to wait until today 
Thy will be done in my life of pain
I will wait your perfect time
I thank God when I see my life
I can feel my brother's pain 
Martyrs die with hands held high
In the west we turn our eyes
Give us your world view of will
I thank God he spared my life
