Revolution in my mind
In my sleep, in my time
You must be issued with vision
Not too many last this long
Conservative, soul life
Straight way, extremist, revolutionary
Born again christian
I am revolutionary
I'm of the old school
I am a metal missionary
I am a revolutionary 
All my life always a fighter
Tried to excel at anything exciting
Knew I had to do something for God
Useless to succeed for self
I could see a rising revolution
What I saw was a mighty stand
White washed and watered down
Time to re-sing the message loud 
Come and join the revolution
Jesus Metal throughout the nations
Come and join the mighty stand!
Preach the word, his command
Go to the world and win disciples
You know we don't need the fame
On an image of evil ways
Walking close to the blade 
Tolerant only to thruth
We embrace this quote
Has the revolution faded?
Come on all you mighty men
Hold up a brand new flag
Unashamed Jesus bands
Who cares what the world will think
We must witness to help save them
