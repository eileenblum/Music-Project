Forsake the flesh
Time to deny the covet
Time to deny the covet
Eating the mind
World full of lust
Where you abide, desire much
Exocise the covet 
Learning to control the flesh
Wanting to revive
Health within your spirit
Kill your desire
Kneeling in obedience
Block the sinful side 
Covet not your neighbour's wife
Covet not his house
Count your many blessings
Stop and view the stars
Hear the birds whistle
Satisfied with life 
Fight the need for greed
Content with self
Balance of faculties
Harmonise your soul
Deny the need for more
Thank God daily
