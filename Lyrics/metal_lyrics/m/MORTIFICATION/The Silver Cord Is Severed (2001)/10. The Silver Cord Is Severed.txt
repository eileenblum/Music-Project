Remember God before the silver cord is severed
Or the golden bowl is broken 
Remember your creator
In the days of your youth
Before the days of trouble come
And you find no pleasure in them 
When the keepers of the house will tremble
And the strong men will stoop
When the grinders cease because they are few
And the sound of grinding fades 
Are you a judge of another man?
Is your life just vanity?
Maybe look where you will stand?
On the day of your death! 
Fear God and follow his commands
For this is the duty of man
God will bring every deed of judge
Including any hidden sin
