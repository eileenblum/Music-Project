I have seen the devil's fires
All around the youth
I have seen the funeral pyres
Too much suicide 
Jesus died, blood of christ
Don't heed the lies, of the evil side 
Standing at the door of death
I have seen the light of heaven
My eternity 
Realise, Christ, paid the price
Don't need to die, without eternal life
