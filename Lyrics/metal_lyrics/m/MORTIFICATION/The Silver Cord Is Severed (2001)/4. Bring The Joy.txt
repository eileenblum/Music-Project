I feel the power burning
Deep down inside my soul
I know the real Jesus
He brings my salvation 
Prepare to feel power
As the spirit reveals bring forth truth
Your brain receives 
Bring the joy
With the power of sound
Shout it out aloud
Shout it out aloud
On volume ten 
I See the world is turning
In all the wrong directions
Now hear the burning sound
Pointing the right way 
We won't stop, we won't go
God reveals truth, now it's time
