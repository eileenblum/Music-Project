His eyes could hardly see the long road ahead
Blood and sweat dripped down his face as he was lead
His body was beaten, far beyond repair
They thought he was just a man
But he was God.
This man was not huilty of any sin
He had done nothig wrong, he was innocent
He chose to take all the world's wrong
And take it down to the abbys.

The journey continued to the place called the Skull
Step by step he staggered on, the sky was getting dull
On and on he kept up with the pain he must take
He went through this when will the world awake.

Jesus Christ is the only Son of God
He did all this for you because he loved you

Many were weeping many more laughing
Many were mocking many were scorning
This man would do what no one understood
The sacrifice was made by God's own right hand.

[Repeat Chorus and part two]

At last the arrival at Calvarys hill
They tore off his robe and naked he stood
They nailed him to a cross they got their wish
But in three days they'd never guess
He rose from the grave!........
