Jesus Christ is the rises Saviour
Escape the violent death
Turn from your sin and worship Him
Or you'll draw your last breath.
Everything that has a beginning must end
This world can't last much longer
Jesus Christ is the author of life
His power is very much stronger
Than that of satan and his hoards od demons
Who will spend eternity in hell
Hell was only made for satan
You don't have to go there as well

Jesus Christ is the rises Saviour
Escape the violent death
Turn from your sin and worship Him
or you'll draw your last breath.

Don't be a fool, ignore what I'm saying
Because what I have to say is true
Don't condemned into eternal hell
Recieve Him, it's all up to you
Give Christ the glory just what he deserves
Just bow down yourself unto Him
He will overcome you with open arms
And say goodbye to your sin.
