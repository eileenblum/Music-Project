Death, hell, torment, suffering,
Will overcome you unless you turn to Christ.
Pain anguish, endless aestruction
Will overcome you unless you turn to Him.

Hellish deception, visions of horror
Will overcome you unless you turn to Christ.

Mental mutilation, demonic oppression
Will overcome you unless you turn to Him.

Death, hell, torment, suffering,
Will overcome you unless you turn to Christ.

Pain anguish, endless aestruction
Will overcome you unless you turn to Him.

Hellish deception, visions of horror
Will overcome you unless you turn to Christ.

Mental mutilation, demonic oppression
Will overcome you unless you turn to Him, so turn to Him.
