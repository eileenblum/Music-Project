Can't you see this world's illusions of life
It's not gonna last. You won't survive
We're all destined to the grave
Unless we call upon God to save
us from eternal death.
The illusion of life is that you think you're safe
without the Lord and His saving grace
While you think you've got safety and peace
Your lifes suddenly over no more mercy
Hell awaits you, it's too late.

The things of life is all that seems to be real
But can't you see that in eternity it's just a fantasy
Christ is the reality in Him is eternal life
This world isn't gonna last. It's gonna burn you'd better run fast

Eternity is the reality. Look forward to it with Jesus
Faithfuland true he'll never fail you
He loved you so much that He died for you

The illusion of life tells us to live for today
till the day that we pass away
No thought to prepare for your Maker
Live for God or die with the faker- This world can't save you.

How can you guarantee yourself eternal life
Today you are here and tomorrow you die,
Do you know where you'll go when you've gone
There's only two ways to go, up or dow, You'd better decide.
