Bruised for our transgressions
Crushed he was for our iniquities
He was surely broken
Died to set us free
He was whipped
He was crushed
Christ was nailed
He was mocked
He was bruised
Christ our Lord

Christ he was inflicted
He took the sin of man
Bleeding on a woodencross
God's eternal plan

For salvation
Through submission
To the Lord
Your poition
of redemption
through the blood

Blood sacrifice
He died instead
Blood sacrifice
for all of us He bled
Blood sacrifice salvation in Him
Blood sacrifice accept Him and you'll live
Forever seperated from the fires of hell
Forever with God.
Can't you see the blood flowing from his hands
cleanses you from sin.

He did not stay dead
He rose from the grave
On in victory
Over satan's rule
Christ said I have come
to save those who come to me

It's time for our confession
of Christ as Lord
Fix your situation
On Him you must call

He was whipped
He was crushed
Christ was nailed
He was mocked
He was bruised
Christ our Lord
