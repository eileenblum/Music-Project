Impulsation, smash and grab world
Impulsation, live fast, die young
You'll not find, real satisfaction
You'll find emptiness, fake gratification

Impulsation, patience never learned
Impulsation, satisfaction now

Can't you see, this won't last
lasting peace comes from Christ.

You'll find self-control
if you find salvation
Blood and the fire
purge your mind
Ultimate satisfaction
Beal peace
Lasting joy
comes through Jesus
White wash
your mind
Find your release.

Bludgeon to death, lust in your life
Consecrate to live right
Manifest the grace of God
Supplicate prayer and live

LOVE

Impulsation, it's not cool
Impulsation, you could dile.
Can't you see people dying
Everyday aids and drug addictions.
