Demon forces
They must bow
Saints of God arise and kill
Deprivation
Evil bondage
Will not claim the church of Christ.
Brutal warfare
Brutal warfare
Pain and torment
Cast from below
Stand strong with God's armour on
Inflicted hate
Spiritual war
Christ's name sends them back to hell

Put on the full armour of God
Stand against the devil
We are not fighting man
But evil powers of a dark age

Rotting minds
Avenge yourselves
Send the devil back to hell
Intence defence
Awsome victory
Bludgeon to death bondages

Belt of truth around your waist
Righteoursness your breastplate
Cospel of peace in your feet
The shield of faith and sword of God
