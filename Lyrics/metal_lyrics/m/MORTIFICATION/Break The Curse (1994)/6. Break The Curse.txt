Eternal love, hope in life, satisfaction,
Peace of mind.
Do you feel these things inside
or lost your lives denied
Christ has come to heal your mind
to win and be recieved.
You run from God, you smashed the gift
thrown from glory it's your own will
Christ come, to heal your mind
so choose to be supplied
with life in glory here on earth
eternity, break the curse.

Falling from grace don't do it
See the light run to it.

Cross over or you will die
Run from darkness, come tonight.

Break the curse, that's in your life
From daze of fear, to shrine of light
Feel it break down deep inside
your soul has come alive
expelling demons brand new-birth
eternity break the curse.
