[Words &amp; Music: Steve Rowe]

Too much pain

Years of suffering, years of remorse
For the life that takes it course
Down the road of suffering and pain
If but by grace, I would not remain

God he came to earth as a man
Immense love to join the physical realm
He was crucified so that we can live
Salvation from the blood he spilled

I am honoured to share in the suffering of Christ
For His Kingdom my voice shall arise
At His throne your judgement He will tell
Through disbelief your soul will burn in hell
