[Words: Steve Rowe, Music: Mick Jelinic]

I downright refuse to be
Your financial commodity
I am a man that loves God
I am a man that loves art

I am real, I am soul
I ain't plastic to be sold
I like who I am
You can't stop the real thing

I don't care if you hate what I do
Because I don't exist for you
I play for the pure of heart
Who care not for your plastic songs
Because my heart is with the throne
I have the right to be my own
Not some stupid lpan to succeed
