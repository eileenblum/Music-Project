[Words &amp; Music: Steve Rowe]

Bring up the young in the way of the Lord
When they are old, they will not depart
From the word that cleans their brain
Learning young to avoid the pain

Brain Cleaner

When the devil comes knocking at you door
Hold up the Book that kills like a sword
Never mind the pain that it inflicts
You have the power to be victorious

All the filth surrounding the world
What you gonna do to see the new moon?
Open the words from the Book of Life
Light exudes the dark of the night
