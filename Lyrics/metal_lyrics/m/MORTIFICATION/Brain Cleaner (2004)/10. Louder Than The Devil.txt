[Words &amp; Music: Steve Rowe]

Holy anger, rising up inside
I'm sick of the devil and his lies
I am louder than the devil
And I'll blow out his brains
He's gonna wish that I was never born

Louder than the devil, get out of my brain
Louder than the devil, there he goes again
Louder than the devil, no way he can win
Louder than the devil, Holy war!

Gaining volume screamin in his ear
His sliming brain will be blown clear
I am louder than the devil
And I'll blow out his brains
He's gonna wish that I was never born

The revolution against all hell will never stop
All heaven breaks loose as we unload the guns
Satan's feeble lies will be forgotten
As all knees shall bow and tongues confess
That Christ is Lord
Live by the sword
Just kill all hate
And in the end we rise in heaven's gate
