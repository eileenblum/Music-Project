[Words &amp; Music: Steve Rowe]

[Originally recorded by Lightforce in 1986]

Jesus called the fishermen
Asked the to follow Him
Become fishers of men

12 men, followed Him

Jesus calls the modern man
Asks them to follow Him
They won't ever be the same again

You can be a fisherman
Ask them to follow Him
They won't ever be the same again
