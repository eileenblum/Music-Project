[Words &amp; Music: Steve Rowe]

The Boaconstrictor, sqeezing the life out of you
The Boaconstrictor, sqeezing the faith calling you

Sliming around on a big yellow belly
Looking for those he can suck
Grab you by your very soul
He wants to steal your life
Sqeezing and sqeezing now to break
All that God has for you
Engulf you in an almighty gulp
Into the belly of horror you die

Now embrace the strength of Samson
Hair blowing free in the wind
You have the power in The Word
The Boaconstrictor loosing his might
With godly force receiving the way
The snake is ripping in two
His jaws are putty in the hands
Of those who wield the truth

Wrestle to the ground
The one to be found
Sliming around in your soul
Ripping the sucker clean in two
Free forever to be renewed
