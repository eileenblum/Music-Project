[Words &amp; Music: Steve Rowe]

The flu virus, it's hit or miss
Do you, have the faith?
In God or man

Body aching, bones asleep
Veins are pumping, I think I'm sick
Just precaustion, you must take
Lay around in bed all day
Release comes when you pray
A prayer of faith, when you're sick

The flu virus, immunisation
Can't control the next attack
Just like salvation
You must know who you ar
Or Satan comes to steal your joy

Take your medication
Faith in God and modern ways
God gives us all a brain
Take the shot but stand in Him
