[Words: Steve Rowe, Music: Mick Jelinic]

Why do you feel that you have to own me?
I never set ou to deceive
Always just wanting to be

Purest intent, for you to repent
Purest intent, strive to achive the best

I like the grind and I like death metal
I like the thrash crossover, that's simple
I like the power metal extremes
I like the doom and shouting out Jesus!
Why do you always tie me to bore?
Make the same art just more and more
I will always make this a band
Where songs and people play a hand
