[Verse 1]
I live on a wing and a prayer
In majesty I ride.
Inheritance of royalty
Flows within my blood
Soaring to the heights
The eagle shall be bold.

[CHORUS]
Isaiah 40:31
Isaiah 40:31

[Verse 2]
I ride the wings of change
Agile in the wake of hate
Ruling with an iron sword
Death to my taunting prey.
Faithful to my final quest
The eagle shall be bold.

[CHORUS]

[Verse 3]
Those who wait on the Lord
They shall renew their strength
Mount up with wings like eagles
They'll walk and shall not faint
They'll run and not be weary
The eagle shall be bold

[CHORUS]
