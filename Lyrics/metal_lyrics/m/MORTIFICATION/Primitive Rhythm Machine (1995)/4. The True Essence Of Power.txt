[Verse 1]
Riding free I see the way I feel
Don't touch my soul the day I bow 
to your low ways, will be the day I never see.

[BRIDGE A]
Leave me, in the Name of my Lord

[Verse 2]
Hoping peace will keep me all the days of my life, I
will bow
only to Christ the real life of my being now.

[CHORUS]
The True Essence Of Power
The True Essence Of Power
JESUS

[Verse 3]
Surely goodness and mercy will follow 
me all the days of my life
I serve the King, the founder of my soul.

[BRIDGE B]
With me, always
Jesus, save us

[Verse 4]
Blackness hates my God, I see
eternal death will come to those who leave the path of
life to
follow with evil ways.

[INTERLUDE]
What is the path you see
Satans plans you death
to be young, before your time

Hope is what you need
Christ planed your life
to be forever, eternally

[Verse 2]
[CHORUS]
