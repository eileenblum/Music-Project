[Verse 1]
Bosnian land mines, Russian end times
baby kill pills, induced suicide bills
Stare the world down in its eyes
see the emptiness, deception and lies

[CHORUS 1]
Have we not seen from our easy chair,
The convicted psycho's evil glare;
Numbed to life's blood and death
T.V.'s reality we're being fed;

[BRIDGE 1]
For mans success will be the blackest of gain!
A certain season for terror to reign!

[Verse 2]
Nazi war crimes, the poor's poverty lines
earthquakes in Japan, move destiny's hand
The petty division, in our wealthy lands
starve children, taking food from their hands

[CHORUS 2]
Have we not seen troubled eyes;
More pain and tearstained cries;
Our will to bring change;
Will help us turn;

[BRIDGE 2]
O, God haven't you seen it all
Since man's rise and fall
Have mercy on our kind
For it's you we must seek and find
O God haven't you seen it all, Devastation and deaths
call
It's cause and effect has come
This worlds terror has begun
My God haven't you seen it all
The reassurance op pain, by our choice it remains! My
God!

[Verse 3]
Nations banking, U.N. backing
revelation unfolds, talons take hold
a stared empty glare, raised not to care
life sucked back within, black ugly sin
