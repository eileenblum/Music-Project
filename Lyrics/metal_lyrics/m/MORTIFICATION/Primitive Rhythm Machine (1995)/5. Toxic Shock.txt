[Verse 1]
Over indulgence in substance you require
To settle down, to feel sane, the his is in your mind
Veins pumping, eyes lost, hideous life of pain
It hates you now, the joy is gone, death crime insane.

[CHORUS]
Drug free body, you must deceide
Drug free body, beware! The toxic shock.

[Verse 2]
A life of compulsion, excessive in every way
No moderation, more sensation, feelings inside your
brain
Young bodies may take it, but age will tell the toll
Satans plan to kill you young, possession growing
strong.

[CHORUS]

[BRIDGE]
Pain, fear, despair
Hope, it is the other way of life, you can be saved
from the toxic shock, from the pain inside
From a mind of loss, see the cross

[Verse 3]
Back street hangout, in drains you do await
Body shacking, heart is racing, frantic for you man
More suffering, excessive, ways have killed your mind
You will crawl the gutters of filth to fix your pain

[CHORUS]

[Verse 4]
Many will testify, that through the power of God
All is broken, all is clean, God can heal your mind.
Drug free, it can be your way
Simply see that it is done, Christ is there to save.

[CHORUS]
