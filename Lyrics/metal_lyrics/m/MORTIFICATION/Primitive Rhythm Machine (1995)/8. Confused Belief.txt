[Verse 1]
Within the chambers of our minds; exists deceit
Framework of formed man holds; the choice of life

[Pre-Chorus]
Who we are; where we come from;
Where must we go?
Tiring questions we all persist to know;
Do we really know?

[Chorus]
Depths to life; grasping to obtain;
Confused mind, trying to arrange;
Confused belief, searching for peace;
A confusion, in what you believe;

[Verse 2]
We exist with a longing, for truth
Something that's tangible in sight,
Extracted proof

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Ever present need to understand.
Meaning's brought, Christ has wrought.
Wiped away by a nail scarred hand.
Known in our created hearts.
Our freewill is where change starts.
Hung from a tree of regret.
Seek the one that gives dust breath.

[Outerlude]
Ever-present need to be fullfilled
Gaining acces to life
For, our pain Yeshua's blood spilled.
