[Verse 1]
I am gonna feel, when I'm gonna fall, in my heart now
I have gotta see, what I've gotta do in my life how
I have seen a change, I have seen a way, to be pure so
I am gonna clean, I am gonna purge, out my soul now.

[CHORUS]
Rising, falling
Conviction, calling
Gut wrench
Gut wrench
Gut wrench
I feel forlorn
Gut wrench
Gut wrench
Gut wrench
Saving my soul

[Verse 2]
I am gonna kneel, I am gonna pray, to my God now
I have gotta see, I have gotta wait, on His ways how
Can I see a change, can I see a hope in this life
that always has the bad, always has the flesh, in the
foreground.

[CHORUS]

[BRIDGE]
The mighty ray of hope, into the heart of faith
No man can purge himself, no man can save his face
Almighty God on high, save our putrid souls
You are the way, rejected by fools.

[Verse 3]
I have felt a joy, I have felt a peace, in my heart
now
I have need of faith, I have need of grace, in my life
how
Can I be the same, can I be the way, that I was then
When I have the Lord, when I have the cross, in my
mind now.

[CHORUS]
