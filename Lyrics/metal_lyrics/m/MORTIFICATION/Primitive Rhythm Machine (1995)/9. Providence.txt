[Chorus]
Providence, forgiveness for us all
Deliverance. Amazing power

[Part 1]
Rising to see the light, providence in the night
Menacing inner thought, turbulence of the mind

[Chorus]

[Part 2]
Insistence on the right, exposure of the hate
Zealous life spirit, the order of Christ

[Bridge]
This is the power of God, sensation!!
This is the way of the cross, salvation!!

[Part 3]
Rising to the task, or falling for the dark
Lifting up the cross, or falling for the hate

[Part 4]
Majesty, the power rises, glory, the Lord reigns
Forever, surrender, never decline
Lasting Savior, falling hate

[Part 5]
Providence, forgiveness for us all
Deliverance, amazing power
Majesty rises, glory, reigns forever

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

[Part 3]

[Part 6]
Majesty, the power rises, glory, the Lord reigns
Jesus He rose, glory, reigns forever
