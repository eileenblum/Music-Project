[Chorus]
Unified truth to set free, pounding the wall
obey me, in holy, unified truth we stay. I feel the
force of God all around my side, my sight is lisght by
storm of great unified life. My heart is kept by safe
unfailing words, the wall of hearts, that worship
Christ our Lord. My God sees all men, as equal parts,
within the body of mankind as a global voice, the
joining of all race to stand as one the death of war,
when peace has come to mankind, we are seeing the
revolution of destruction of racial hatred, unified
under God all men are equal in his sight. Blacks ,
Asians, Reds, Jews, Whites [X 4]
I feel hate for hate
my need to care for what afflicts the brothers of man
worldwide. Unity brings a power where all are for the
furthering of mankind as a unified force
