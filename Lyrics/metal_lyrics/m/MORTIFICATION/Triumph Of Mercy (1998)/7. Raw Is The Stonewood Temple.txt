in the midst of the field of life we stand in the
storms of the dark oly salvation brings us light all
else is false hope. Raw is the stonewood temple,
stained glass window shining, raw is the stonewood
temple, light in the midst of dying.
Buffet our bodies in the walk of the light, evil
cannot break us we're insured with eternal flame, save
our souls from dying. Die to rise, arise, survive, in
the pain that this life brings, Christ is the only
hope. we are but dust form of man Don't forget
eternity
the light, the light, eternity!
We pray the promise of eternal life, we pray the
promise of abundance, we pray the claim of hree score
years and ten to live our faith out.
