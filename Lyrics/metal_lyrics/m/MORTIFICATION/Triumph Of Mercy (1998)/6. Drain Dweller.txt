out of the sewers, out of the drains, life of filth,
possess your brain. Where's your next bed, where's
your next bread. Hide those scar filled veins.
Scramble for money, beg on the streets, looking for
mercy, can you be freed, you've no love in your life,
you were dropped at birth, what is fair about pain,
some just suffer on, somehow I releate to your utter
pain. All I know is this, God is always there, come to
him, cling to him, trust in him, see the change, when
all is lost, read the word, shout to God, and feel the
hope. You're out of the sewers, you're out of the
drains, new birth has come, your life is saved, all
those new friends, those ones who care, their
compassion, comes from God. Show those drug free
veins. You've found love in your life, you were hugged
at rebirth, when you ventured to your new found faith
in DCHrist, Show those drug free veins!!!!!!
