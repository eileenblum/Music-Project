[chorus]
Welcome to the paladrome, mansions in the sky,
welcome to the paladrome, Lambs book of life

[bridge]
All these problems count for nought, in the
light of eternity.

[Verse 1]
all our cares will be lost, all our fears
will be gone, the pain on which you dwell is useless
to your sould.

[Interlude 1]
he's our healer, our provider, he is
there, in our pain

[Chorus repeat, bridge repeat]
All this flesh will be gone, our mind won't understand
but put your hope in Love, His way will be inveiled

[Interlude 2]
He's our comfort, our great high priest, the ONE we
love, take pain to your knees

[Repeat interlude 1, repeat interlude 2]
