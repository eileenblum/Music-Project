visited by an angel, a beautiful love song, surrounded
by a clouded light, the joy was overwhelming, who are
you I mustered, from a shaken breath, I am an Angel
especially to minister to you today. Don't go away, I
pleaded I never do, it smiled. Suddenly a vision
thouseands of people who hated me, all around what did
I see, what can man do to you? The awesome presence
said I fell back in a peace all my fear relieved,
relieved.
from my bed I arose with a joy filled heart of praise
I laughed until I cried, I could not believe my state,
I fell down to the floor, an utter laughing mess.
Visited by an angel, a very special gift, months of
pain have followed as I have fought a cancer plight
but I was sent an angel to show I had a strenght, God
showed me my special friend that day, that day!!!
