[WORDS AND MUSIC-STEVE ROWE]

SORROW, IN MY MIND, SORROW, TIME TO
TIME, SORROW, FOR MY PAIN, SORROW,
WHY THIS WAY?

FAIRY TALES IN LIFE, DON'T SEEM TO BE REAL,
BUT I WILL JOIN IN SUFFERING, JUST AS MANY MORE,
SEE THE WAY THAT I CAN CHANGE, MY INADEQUACY,
SEE MYSELF A CHILD OF LIFE, BANISH HELPLESS THOUGHTS.

THE DESIRE TO LEAVE A MARK, A LEGACY IN THIS WORLD,
HAMPERED BY PAIN AND THOUGHTS, THAT STUMBLE THE PATH,
RISE ABOVE THIS ONSLAUGHT, A FEELING OF LONELINESS, SORROW IN MY HEART,
PLEASE HELP ME GOD!
