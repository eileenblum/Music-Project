DEVIL'S ATTACK, MUST FIGHT BACK, 
THE BLOOD OF CHRIST, OUR DEFENCE, 
GUARD OUR MINDS, GUARD OUR HEARTS,
KILL ALL DEATH

SATAN'S LIES, THEY MUST DIE,
NOW HE WILL KILL, IF HE CAN,
GUARD OUR SOULS, GUARD OUR LIFE,
KILL ALL DEATH!

WEB OF, FIRE, DESTROYS, ALL LIFE,
BLOOD OF, OUR CHRIST, NEW BIRTH, NEW LIFE

DEVIL'S ATTACK, MUST FIGHT BACK,
THE BLOOD OF CHRIST, OUR DEFENCE,
GUARD OUR SOULS, GUARD OUR LIFE,
KILL ALL DEATH!
