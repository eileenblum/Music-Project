[WORDS AND MUSIC-STEVE ROWE]

WE'RE HERE FOREVER, WE'RE GONNA STAY,
NO FORCE OF EVIL, CAN MAKE US GO AWAY,
WE'RE DRIVING THUNDER, WE BRING THE DAY,
THE WAY OF THE CROSS, THE ONLY WAY!
WE'RE BRINGING GOODNESS, AGAINST THE GRAIN,
NO DEATH OR DARKNESS, HAS ANY SAY.

IGNITE THE FLAME, THE TORCH OF LIGHT
THE DAY OF THE CROSS, HAS NOW ARRIVED

WE BRING THE HAMMER, OF TRUTH TODAY,
WE SMASH THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT OTHERS SAY,
TRIUMPH OF MERCY, SHALL REIGN SUPREME,
THE TRUE BEGINNING, OF LIFE TO DREAM,
TO BE FOREVER, A BRIGHTER WAY,
THE POWER OF THE CROSS, THE ONLY WAY!

...AND WE WORSHIP AT THE ALTAR OF GOD,
...AND WE WORSHIP AT THE ALTAR OF GOD,
...AND WE WORSHIP AT THE ALTAR OF GOD,
...AND WE WORSHIP AT THE ALTAR OF GOD,
[X2]
TONIGHT!!!!!
