[WORDS-STEVE ROWE, MUSIC-JEFF LEWIS]

APOCALYPTIC TERROR, WARS AND EVIL LIES,
APOCALYPTIC TERROR, THE SIGN OF THE TIMES.

RUNNING, SCREAMING!
YOU'VE BEEN LEFT BEHIND.
RUNNING, SCREAMING! LEFT BEHIND.

FORSAKEN, NOT WITH US, BEHEADED TO JOIN US,
CHRISTIANS ARE FORGIVEN, TAKEN UP IN RAPTURE,

THE RAPTURE IS FOR THE SAVED, ALL ELSE WILL BE DAMNED,
UNLESS THEY RECEIVE, IN THE FINAL HOUR,

ETERNAL DAZE, WHAT'S ALL THIS CONFUSION?
JESUS SAVES, THE ONLY REAL WAY.
ETERNAL DAZE, THE ETERNAL HAZE,
RECEIVE, THE FAITH, OR DIE, THE DEATH
