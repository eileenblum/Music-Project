[WORDS AND MUSIC-STEVE ROWE]

KINDNESS, IT'S SO EASY, PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE
KINDNESS BRINGS RELEASE, FROM PAIN AND SUFFERING

LOVING ONE ANOTHER, AS CHRIST LOVES THE CHURCH,
TRUSTING THROUGH HARDSHIP, OVERCOME THE HURT,
FAITHFULNESS IN LOVING, BEYOND HUMAN WAY,
UNCONDITIONAL LOVE, LOOKS BEYOND THE PAIN,

BRING RELEASE
FROM SUFFERING [X2]

FIGHTING ONE ANOTHER, IT SEEMS THE EASY WAY,
BUT WHY TAKE THE HATE ROAD, WHEN LOVE  IT BRINGS RELEASE
COURAGE TO BE KIND, HELP TAKE THE PAIN AWAY,
LIVING IN UNITY, PEACE FOREVERMORE,

READ THE WORD AND PRAYER, STARTS A KINDER WAY,
THINKING WHAT WE CAN DO, TO MAKE SOMEONE'S DAY,
LOVING WITH KINDNESS, LOOKS BEYOND THE FAULTS,
PATIENCE WITH HARDSHIP, GIVING ALL TO GOD,
