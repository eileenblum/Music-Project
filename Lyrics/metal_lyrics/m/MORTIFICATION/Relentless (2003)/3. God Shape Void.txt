[WORDS AND MUSIC-STEVE ROWE]

TRY AS YOU MIGHT TO FILL IT, WITH SHAPES THAT DO NOT FIT,
TRY AS YOU WILL TO KILL IT, IT WILL STILL BE THERE,
CANNOT BE FILLED BY DRUGS, CANNOT BE FILLED BY LUST,
CANNOT BE FILLED BY MUSIC, ITS SHAPE IS PURE AND LIGHT.
GOD SHAPE VOID, IN YOUR SOUL,
GOD SHAPE VOID, ALONE IS FILLED
BY FAITH

TRY AS YOU CAN TO FIGHT IT, IT CANNOT BE BEAT, 
POUR THE SPIRITS IN IT, THEY JUST WILL NOT FIT,
CANNOT BE FILLED BY ABUSE, NOT SATISFIED BY GREED
YOU MAY OWN TEN MILLION, BUT CANNOT BUY ITS PEACE

BATTLE THE FORCE WITHIN YOU,
AND TRY TO FIND YOURSELF,
IN YOUR OWN SIGNIFICANCE,
THIS PATH JUST WILL NOT WIN,
NOTHING FILLS THE VOID WITHIN
EXCEPT THAT OF FAITH,
ONLY SHAPED SALVATION,
THIS IS YOUR ONLY HOPE.
