[WORDS-STEVE ROWE, MUSIC-JEFF LEWIS]

MY RAINBOW, MY PROMISE
MY CRYSTALS, CREATION

THE NEW AGE, FALLEN WAYS, TAKING THE WAYS OF GOD,
THE CRAZY AUDACITY OF THEIR TAKE
GOD CREATED, HIS RELATION, WITH THE WORLD, HE CREATED,
WITH HIS HAND, WILL NOT STAND, FOR YOU MAD INSOLENCE.

DON'T STEAL MY RAINBOWS,
DON'T TAKE MY CRYSTALS,
TAKE YOUR STEALING HANDS,
FORM YOUR OWN SYMBOLS,

DEATH ANGELS, BLIND FAIRIES, TAKING THE WAYS OF GOD,
THE CRAZY AUDACITY, OF THEIR TAKE
GOD HE MADE IT, CANNOT TAKE IT, FROM THE ONE WHO REIGNS
WITH HIS HAND, WILL NOT STAND, FOR YOUR MAD INSOLENCE

NOW TAKE YOU HAND, NOW MAKE A PLAN,
FOR YOU OWN WAY, TO SYMBOLISE YOUR
TWISTED FAITH
