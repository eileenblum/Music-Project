[WORDS AND MUSIC-STEVE ROWE]

RELENTLESS, RELENTLESS, YEARS OF BRUTAL WAYS,
RELENTLESS, RELENTLESS, NOISE TO CLEAN YOUR BRAIN,
RELENTLESS, RELENTLESS, MISSIONARY FORCE
RELENTLESS, RELENTLESS, METAL IN YOUR FACE!
THOUSANDS OF FANS, FOLLOW THE SOUND
WE ARE THE PRIESTS OF THE
UNDERGROUND
THOUSANDS OF SOULS THOUSANDS OF SALES,
PROVE TO THE MOCKERS, THAT THEY ARE WRONG!

CURSED BY EVIL, CURSED BY OUR OWN,
TRY TO STOP US, BUT WE WON'T GO,
BETTER THAN ALL OF, THE RED NECKS TOGETHER,
WE WILL FIGHT ON, DESPITE THEIR STUPOR.

STUPIDITY, IN THE MINDS, WHEN YOU GET TO 
HEAVEN, WILL BE SPEWED?
INTO THE LAKE, OF FIRE AND HELL,
RESERVED FOR THE ONES, HE NEVER KNEW!

GOD'S WAY!!!!, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY!!!!
