[WORDS AND MUSIC-STEVE ROWE]

ARM THE ANOINTED
WITH POWER FROM ON HIGH,
ARM THE ANOINTED,
LIKE LIGHTNING.

STRIKE UPON THE WATER,
SHINE UPON THE SEA,
WATERS FLOW THE SANDBANK,
JUST LIKE AN ANOINTING
CALL UPON THE ELDERS,
TO ANOINT THE SICK,
OIL UPON THE FOREHEAD,
WATERS FLOW WITHIN.

STRIKE UPON THE ANVIL,
FORGE THE FIRE AND FLAME,
BURNING FORCE OF POWER,
REVIVAL OF THE WAY,
THAT BRINGS HOLY POWER,
TO THOSE WHO RECEIVE
CALL FOR THE ANOINTING,
TO BE RELEASED.
