Look up as redemption is life
The monarch now has arrived
Immortal the forgiven shall be,
Just a choice for all to see.

Enrapture the return of the King
Enrapture on that day we will be
The thunder cracks the night of the sky
Enrapture, caught up in the light.

Seek out the words of the truth
Find your way or the pain will be brutal
Eternity without the light?
3 score years and then we die!

Eternity is a forever time
Find your way to pursue the light
Enrapture is where we want to be
Just in submission, salvation receive!

The ways of the past are all gone
Eternal light is our royal home
Look up as redemption is life
Eternity is forever time.
