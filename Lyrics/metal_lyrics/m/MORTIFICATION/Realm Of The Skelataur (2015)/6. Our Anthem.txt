Do not break the post momentary scrolls
Envision the triumph of a primitive bloodworld
Self-titled brain cleaner, relentless, erasing
The silver cord is killing the evil addiction

Read the scribe of the scrolls
Until all is live on the hammer of God
Realm of the Skelataur

Mortification, shouting the truth unto the world
Now is the time to revisit the truth of the past
Forging in stone, the truth of the future
The Gospel of Christ is our timeless code

The code by which we live
The code by which we forgive
The load of life, resting on the Saviourâs shoulders
Our code shall survive long beyond the
Time of our passing on.
