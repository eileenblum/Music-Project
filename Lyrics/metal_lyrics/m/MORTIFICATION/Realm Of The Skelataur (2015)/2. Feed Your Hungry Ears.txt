Soul food comes from the living bread
Feed your ears- inside your head.
Deep inside, the soul it goes
Day by day, faith grows and grows

Fill your ears with words of truth
Your soul is hungry for food
Coming out across the stage
Where the band plays Gospel faith

Feed, feed your hungry
Feed your hungry ears.
Need, need the sound
Need the sound of Jesus.
Kill, kill all of your
Kill all of your fears.
Feed, feed your hungry
Feed your hungry ears.
Right you are, hungry no more
You have been fed the truth
And received the Lord
Everyday comes meals of,
prayer and the Word
Repentance and redemption
They are now yours.
