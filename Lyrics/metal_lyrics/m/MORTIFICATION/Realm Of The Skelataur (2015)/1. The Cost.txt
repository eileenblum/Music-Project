In 1920, a young man of 14
Declared himself to be, a preacher of the faith
Second World War
A German who loved the Lord
Preached for all to hear, facing all adversity

The cost, of discipleship
The cost, to stand against all evil
Deitrich Bonhoeffer
Lived and was martyred for the
Christian faith.
The cross, we all must bear
The cross, under which there is no fear
Live and die, for what we believe
No liberal theology

In the 1940âs, a hero of the faith
Refused to stop preaching the gospel
He saw the evil in the Third Reich
Had to protect the weak and the oppressed.

He rescued the Jews to neutral Switzerland
Stood for the Lord, in the face of Hitler
Martyred for his faith, 9 days before freedom

Are we prepared to die for our faith in
Jesus Christ
Now fear is gone as we long for home.
The true church, that is a miracle
Standing for Christ, in the face of death

The cost [9x]
