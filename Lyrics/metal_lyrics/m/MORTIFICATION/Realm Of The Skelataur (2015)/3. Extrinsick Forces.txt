Extrinsic forces, embattled on all fronts
No more choices, attacked all at once
Surrounded on all sides,
Of food and peace bereft
A poisoned arrow flies, towards his last defence.

Though he fall,
He will not be cast down.
He will rise, he will rise
He will stand.

Daily battles, trouble everywhere
Terror in the night, nauseating fears.

Permeating sickness,
Ravaged life from limb
Odds are stacked against,
To ever walk again.

I once was young, now I am old
I have watched them rise
And I have watched them fall
I have striven, but through it all
Iâve never seen the righteous forsaken.
