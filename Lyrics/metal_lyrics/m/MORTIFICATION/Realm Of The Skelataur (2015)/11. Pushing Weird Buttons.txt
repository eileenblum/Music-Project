Tempted by the things that this world offers
Step by step you walked off on the wrong path
One by one you find yourself in a barren place
Just one prayer and youâre back on the narrow way

Pushing weird buttons, buttons!
Pushing weird buttons, buttons!

Go back to the old way
Go back to the saving grace
Go back to the saviour
You have walked too far away.

Seems to me, somewhere you lost your faith
Blame the keys offered you, by a wayward voice
Lost in a jungle of lusting for the forbidden fruit
Tastes so good but poison kills your soul of blood

Faithful ways
May not be what a preacher says
Faithful ways
Come from the worship of the Living Bread
Eat the body and drink the cup of faith
True repentance, just one step away

Blood transfusion brings you back to the place
Where you began walking in the truth and faith
Ignore the pull into the devilâs garden
Do not blame twisted blind religion.
