We shout to the sky
Eagle wings on which we fly
High above the deadly fire
Worship at the triune altar

Total thrashing death
Total thrashing death

The bridge of death we cross with faith
We cannot be touched by the flames
Raging from the pits of hell
Looking forward, gaze to grace

Thrashing the death
Killing the fake
Finding the faith
Eternal skies, living the light

Godâs arms are opening wide
We have thrashed the death inside
Living in repentance days
Into Heaven, weâre embraced
