[Chorus]

Die for your faith, 
die for your faith, 
die for your faith, 
die for what you believe in

[Verse 1]

Small group in Cambodia, 
gather in the mud brick room,
teachers shares The Word, 
then they kneed and pray,
communist soldiers storm the door, 
throw the Bible to the floor,
spit upon this book 
or you will breath your last
one by one they spit and cry
they're in fear of their lives
a young girl wipes her Jesus dry
shot in the head she dies.

[Chorus repeat]

[Verse 2]

Evil man killing the christians
satan gives him the false abuse,
but as he reads The Bible truth,
he converst to the Christian Faith,
taken to the evil leaders, he is a disgrace
thrown into a slime filled pit,
eaten by rats for his new Faith.

[Chorus repeat]

[Verse 3]

Preaching man in china,
taken from hias family home,
thrown into a prison cell,
for no criminal reason,
rotting and tortured in his fate,
he will not deny his Faith,
he knows the truth of Christian ways,
no brutal force will make him change.

[Chorus repeat]
