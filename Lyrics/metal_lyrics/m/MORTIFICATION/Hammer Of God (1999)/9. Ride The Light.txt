[Chorus]

Raise the name, feel the might
Heaven Gate, Swords of steel
Faith and Hope, ride The Light
Pure wisdom, strengh and Grace.

[Verse 1]

Runing through the forest 
of life to find my way
See the Light shining, 
but the cat is on the prowl
Deception running close, 
do not be fooled by strife
The truth is in the pages, 
all else is false.

[Chorus repeat]

[Verse 2]

Chasing the rainbow, 
the sign of Gods Grace
never be destroyed by floods, 
rolling down your face
The pain may haunt your soul, 
yor body racked with pain
But think of Paul &amp; Job 
and feed upon His Grace.

[Chorus repeat]

[Verse 3]

Crystalize your tears, 
dried upon The Cross
Blood drips on your pain, 
time to ride the Light
Thoughts of home are near, 
Paradise is close
But living for The King, 
we press on in His Grace.

[Chorus repeat]
