D.W.A.M. Daniel was a mosher

[Verse 1]

A plan to kill off Daniel 
by the administrators
get the king to issue a royal decree

[Chorus]

Stage dived into the lions den
administrotors want him dead
But the lions surfed him all around
D.W.A.M. Daniel was a mosher

[Verse 2]

For thirty nights must worship just the king
But Daniel prayed three times a day 
to our God on high.

[Chorus repeat]

[Bridge 1]

The enemies observed him pray
they went &amp; told the king his ways
the king was sad he'd signed the plot
Daniel was a trusted man.

[Bridge 2]

There was no way out for the king
Bound by law to stick to his
Laws he made cannot be changed
Into the pit offenders thrown.

[Verse 3]

Daniel was throw into the lions den
But God closed their hungry mouths 
and he was not dead.

[Chorus repeat]
