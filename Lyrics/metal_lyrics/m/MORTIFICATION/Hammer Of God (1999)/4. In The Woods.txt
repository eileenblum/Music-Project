[Verse 1]

In the woods, 
blacken ways, turn to day,
dark mist, 
move and twist, won't stay,
guiding eyes, 
from the sky, lead our path,
tangled vines, 
cutting back, see our track.

[Chorus]

In the woods, prophecy, 
in the woods, daylight.

[Verse 2]

See the sky, 
empty night, bring the Light,
ray of Son, 
flashing high, trees alight,
God's Son, 
pouring forth, breaking dark.

[Chorus repeat]

[Verse 3]

Walking forth, 
in our Faith, not afraid,
dark ways, 
crowding in, don't betray,
Mighty Lord, 
bringing forth, our guide,

see The Path, 
reach the end, Glory Side.

[Chorus repeat]
