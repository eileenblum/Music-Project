[Chorus]

Lock up the night, release the fire,
now show The Light, pray for morning,
Take out the dark, Spirit shine,
glowing eyes, show the heart of life.

[Verse 1]

Take the day now for the Lord,
choosen the way how to decide,
run away to the skies,
unseen power to receive.

[Chorus repeat]

[Verse 2]

Feel the pain now it appears,
darkness hates how Jesus heals,
fly away to Life,
mighty Grace to be free.

[Chorus repeat]

[Verse 3]

See the plan for it is real,
satan plots death to steal.
Arrive now to Light,
shining joy to reveal.

[Chorus repeat]

[Bridge repeat]
