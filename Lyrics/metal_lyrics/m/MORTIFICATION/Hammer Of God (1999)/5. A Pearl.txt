[Chorus]

A pearl in a crystal shell,
pure and race compassion shown,
a smile that deepens my health,
Angel wings rise in your peace.

[Verse 1]

Pain in the bones, longing for home,
mercy shown, stands forever,
bringing The Light, see the smiles,
through the pain, when I wake,
feel the care, flowing round, 
in the air, today,
Angles' Grace, from Heavens Gate.

[Chorus repeat]

[Verse 2]

Feel the pain, in my veins,
in despair, but you are there,
drugs of fate, burn and scare,
shocking ways, far to near,
someone shows compassion and care,
Angels Grace from Heavens Gate.
