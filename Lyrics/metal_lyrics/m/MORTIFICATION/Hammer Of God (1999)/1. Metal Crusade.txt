We will not stop fighting, 
as evil deceives.
Thousands of lives, 
will be relieved. 

[Chorus 1]

Metal crusade, 
spreading the Gospel truth, 
raising the shield, 
evil lies demolished 
Metal crusade, 
salvation through the cross, 
belt of truth, 
firm around our waist 

[Verse 2]

Curses coming our way, 
satan thinks he has won, 
but we know the story, 
live everlasting, 
cancer and pain, 
will not stop the fight 
Jesus is risen, 
knowlege will come. 

[Chorus 2] 

Metal crusade, 
spreading the Gospel truth, 
bearing the sword, 
of the spirit of life.
Metal crusade, 
salvation through the cross, 
helmet of salvation, 
guarding our minds. 

[Verse 3]

Through word and music, 
metal shall be reached, 
Jesus will return, 
when all have heard His ways. 
No stone left unturned, 
as we seek your life, 
some way or other, 
you will find The Truth 

[Chorus 3]

Metal crusade, 
spreading the Gospel truth, 
shoes shod, to speed us on. 
Metal crusade, 
salvation through the cross, 
breastplate of righteousness, 
showing God's approval.
