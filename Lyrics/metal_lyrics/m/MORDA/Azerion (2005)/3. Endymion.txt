In the face of eternity

Just rephrasing
And erasing
Just rephrasing and erasing
My words

Ceased aging
Infinite aching
Ceased aging and
Infinite aching

TRUTH IS MADNESS AND MADNESS IS FEAR

She holds me in her lap on a walk with lonely tears

Just rephrasing
And erasing
Just rephrasing and erasing
My words

Ceased aging
Infinite aching
Ceased aging and
Infinite aching

TRUTH IS MADNESS AND MADNESS IS FEAR

She holds me in her lap on a walk with golden tears
Beliefs are just notes in a memory
In wisdom's embrace I'd lie
Again and again
And I just don't know why

I will wage my war with your heart
I will wage this war with your heart

There's no need to argue anymore
