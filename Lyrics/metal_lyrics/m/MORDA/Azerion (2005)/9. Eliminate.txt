Back - Back for more

Some gave it a shot
Gaze up
Feel free to shut up
Pitch down

Back off
Die
Little misery

The product
Lovin' it from day one
A new chapter has just begun

Bring it on
Hold it on
Common' common'

PETTINESS OF YOUR INSTINCTS
TO THIS I ANSWER
Who are you anyway

More controversy
Breeds our tenacity

Fuck your anonimity
The elite is nothing more than a stupid identity
(In the end) You stand alone
