My heart needs a bone to gnaw
To cease all intercourse with our rhetoric life
To shed my moral shroud

To what end
Life is all
The crown of creation

Was not I a fuckin' idiot
The dupe of your altruÃ¯sm
THE DUKE OF THE INFINITE

I have drawn back the curtain
To fly away and leave all this behind
Hold on by the end of my wings
Let me dry your genuine tears
Your genuine tears

I miss your radiant face
I WILL LEAVE NO TRACE

How could one fail - to feel

Let me emphasize the need to find an angel
Tragedy as a purge
And plot your own plot

You ain't gonna be with any other
(memory is a) Festering wound

When I choose
When I act
A virtue is just another artefact
