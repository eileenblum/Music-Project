For once I found it
Taste my greed
I forsake a waste of tears

We are supposed to be happy
We try so damn hard
So damn fucking hard

What
What would I give
I WILL TAKE NO OATHS ANYMORE
What would I give

Prevailing years of blinding darkness
In my will to power life (and its aspects)
AZERION WAS MY RELIEF

Ten times
Let it slip
Fuck fuck
Shake it down
Split it up
FUCKFACE

You turned me into disgrace

Fuck fuck
Shake it down
Split it out
MOTHERFUCKER

I was one of your cut 'n pastes

For once I found it
Taste my greed
I forsake a waste of tears
Sweet Azerion
