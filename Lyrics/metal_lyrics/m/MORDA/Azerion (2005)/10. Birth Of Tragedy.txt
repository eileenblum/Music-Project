Life was my favorite antagonist
Until the day I met you

(A love) In transition
And I just don't know what to do

Existence will always end up in anomaly

Mastery - Mastery

Existence

The phenomena has come to an end
MY DEATH WILL EQUAL US ALL
I am what I make ouf of life
What else can I do than to rationalize

Break down - Break down - Buy out - Break out
Mastery
Break down - Break down - Buy out - Break out
Buy out

Out of the thoughts I had
MADNESS HAS REASON
