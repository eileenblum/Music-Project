Creativity is nothing more than openmindness
To create is to see what didn't seem to be
Creativity is a stupid word for openmindness
To create is to see

I'LL BE YOUR CHOICE

I will take no reason to question myself why
Your feelins are known (manifestations)
Of your (unknown emotions)

We arrived from nothingness
In our perception
THE WORLD'S LOST IN AZERION
We try to objective to oneself
In choosing we define ourselves

I'll be your choice

I wille take no reason to question myself why
Your feelings are known (manifestations)
Of our (unknown emotions)

The concept of irony

For we intend to live in sincerity
Pain - Force
Let me be your guide
Let me be your choise
