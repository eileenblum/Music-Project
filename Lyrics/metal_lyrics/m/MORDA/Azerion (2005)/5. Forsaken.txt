In my noble morality I keep affirmating my sense of being
I want you
To love is to possess
PASSION IS THE SCENT THAT LED US INTO AN ENDLESS EXCESS

For my sake
Behold
Forsaked
By you

Love is my most frequent act of stupidity
Dopamine
You came in

You came in
You can have my mask
Your regrets in control of all my fears

One must love
It was suffering
Now lies has just begun

Love is my most frequent act of stupidity
I cry
I need

IN FORGOTTEN METAPHORES I PERISH

I want you
To love is to possess
Passion is the scent that will lead us into an endless exess
