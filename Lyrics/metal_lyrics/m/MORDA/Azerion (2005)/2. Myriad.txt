I had to serve you in tradition
Into loves doctrine
Pride is the fool that keeps on burning deep inside me
PRIDE IS THE FOOL THAT KEEPS ME SUFFERING

Now it's freezing
Deep inside me
Tender snow that is teasing real softly
Pride turned out to be a mistral wind

I am alone
Myriad
One wipes
She departs

Beyond my sight
She sighes for dignity
I thought of myself als a glorified herald
Determinist

She no longer saw the answers
Pride was the fool that keeps on burning deep inside me
Pride is the fool that keeps me suffering
Your penance is my humble fate in which I have to repose

We were so close
Reductionist
I leave the ship
To live alone

I VENERATE WHAT ONCE COULD HAVE BEEN
What one could've been
