I entertain the certainty
that I'll reset the |standard of| pain
for I have captured the deadly sins
these deadly sins... as I have made my own
for I have captured these deadly sins

and I cherisch bunt one precept war at any time
hate as the precursor of violence
war at any time

the ultimate fear.. bringer of doom

to those I assign the blame of stupidity
to those I assign in the lack of
independent mindset

I am the fire I'll burn you out at the stake
