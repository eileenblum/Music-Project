nothing exists without a cause

the theory of man endowed by power
summed up as one single sentence

wisdom as gold manifest of our strength
I am the deepest principle
I am anything you want

by force of nature
mankind is eager to know
by force of reckoning
mankind is destined to be strong

I know I am the one
the ten ton hammer

last words are for the fools
who haven't said enough

the one blood... the one reason...
the one case.... of human failure

my will supreme absolute weakness
my will supreme interpreted by many
my will supreme a word to indulge
