If beneath everything there lurked
a bottomless void never to be filled
what else would life be than despair

despair by all means the glorified forever
great through wisdom
whose secret is foolishness
despair by all means the heroic forever
great through the hope
whose outburst is madness

hearken now that one outset
it's why it's reason

hearken now that one
outset to the best of my art
to the best of my knowledge

the choice of forever I take it and apart
from my willing it has no existence

I amentation to the fullness of time
how hollow life would be
the manifest of a change slain
