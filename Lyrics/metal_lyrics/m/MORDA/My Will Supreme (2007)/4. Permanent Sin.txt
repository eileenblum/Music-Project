beauty is truth that heals
just throw away the anxiety

like you have never seen
... I want to be and not
another disappear

like you have never witnessed
..I want to slip inside to become you

the search for the spell truly thats
not what magic is about
my comforter snap in my brain

slice me up listen up life is no more
than my permanent sin

let me die in the richness
of our memory whatever our struggles
whatever our triumph
however we may relate all to soon
they bleed into a wash

the best I have to offer
the formula I comprehend...
..love is blind until it becomes
conscious magic is the consciousness
of love

I want to shine all I need is one ground
I want to shine I want to glint
I want to strike all I need is one reason
