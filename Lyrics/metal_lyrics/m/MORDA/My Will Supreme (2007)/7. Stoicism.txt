consciousness is just a consequence
of our will to survive
the marching elite I have spoken to it
the marching elite I have listened to it
I have propped

think of the ego the self
that suffers a personal history
bound to time

as the grid as the craft guilt making

don't try to suspect me of any intelligence
of any higher power I am the willing
and I am the weak

oppression possession guilt making

I speak in al gravity

I am the heritage I am the order
you have chosen me to rule your world

I conjure consciousness
and all who are with it to go and do my will
I am your law your voice of reason
I am your law
I am your strength of character
