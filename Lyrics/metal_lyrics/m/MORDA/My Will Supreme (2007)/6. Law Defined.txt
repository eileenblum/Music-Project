if only for an instant injustice
governs life
it becomes the mother of all stupidity

half the mistakes of mankind
are built upon it
an army of principles
the weapon against

injustice cannot conquer principle
but principle can conquer the law
the path the walk of life snatch purgatory

one thing one fact of life
acknowledge and obey

regards its will as a mere promise
as a mere request
this is were we live
this is were we die

blazing azerion in the end
the greatest glory of our achieves
raging azerion hold ground
one ethic one crucifix

injustice cannot conquer principle
but principle can conquer law
I am morality I am everyone
