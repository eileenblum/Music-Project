Perhaps I know best - (fuck it) - I am the knowledge
Allow me to shatter all establishments
As for the absolute truth - the whore of the world
It does not exist

Follow my way - refuse my way
Adopt my way - neglect my way
Either way you will regret
One man - one name - oneself

Every notion I give you becomes a rule
Every notion I teach you becomes the law

Selection becomes the great leap in the dark
Known by a thousand different names...
He persists in it

Anything you are - anything you have
Anything you need - anything you lose
Cast aside - I'll bring the pain
One man - one name - oneself

Necessity of the lie
(success as) the condition of life

Why is it men alone speak humble
As when they gather a sudden change arises

When a thousand men stand together
Conduct only what's written with ones own blood
