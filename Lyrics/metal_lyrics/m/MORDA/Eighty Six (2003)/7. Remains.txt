Watch the opaque sky
And adopt colors
Cling to the frayed stings
TAKE THIS AND NO OTHER
Engraving wishes in my heart
until DEATH WILL DO US APART
Decaying wishes fall apart
I ALONE is what remains
Cold, inevitable -- hunting me down
CRAWLING AWAY FROM THE LIGHT OF DAY
Cold, inevitable -- make me strong
Walking my life, walking this strife

Now choke all candles

AND SWALLOW ME

'cause nothing else could be
