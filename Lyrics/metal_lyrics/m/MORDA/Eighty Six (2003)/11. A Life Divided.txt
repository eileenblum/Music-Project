A life divided A threat separated
Death surrounds MY HAPPINESS

I love I am / I am I hate / Adore me

We lost we lost sketchy living lives
WE LOST WE LOST SKETCHY LIVING LIVES

Regain myself I love
I love I am I HATE

I love I am / I am I hate / Adore me

Purgaton of the dust I love I am
This selfish interview with one self

ADORE ME


Thanks to gaelsk8erboy for correcting track #2 lyrics.
