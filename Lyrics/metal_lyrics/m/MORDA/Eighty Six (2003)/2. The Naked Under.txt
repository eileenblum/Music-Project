Go on.

I'll rape your days, I will hurt you in so many ways
Azerion has left me, life will have got it s arguments
As I craned my neck to flinch away

I'll rape your days, I will hurt you in so many ways
I will hurt you in so many ways
I'll rape your days
I will rape your soul

What do you think? That you can FUCK ME and then just let me go?
What do you think? That you can put my feelings on deathrow?
So, why do you think?

What do you think? That you can FUCK ME and then just let me go?
What do you think?
So, why do you say you do this?

I will ignore you
You always be ...
You, you will die
I'll make you cry for every word you said to me
You will see I'm stronger than your neverending stupidity

I'll rape your days, I will hurt you in so many ways
I'll rape your days, I will hurt

If what I've found was only a moment of light
You would find nothing on your return
As I fumble on the edge of a dream

I know I'll never be less, be less, be less, be less

What do you think? That you can FUCK ME and then just let me go?
What do you think? That you can put my feelings on deathrow?
So, why do you say you do this?

Azerion has left me, life will have got its arguments
As I craned my neck to flinch away

I'll rape your days, I will hurt you in so many ways
Azerion has left me, life will have got its arguments
As I craned my neck to flinch away

I'll rape your days.
I will hurt you in so many ways
I will hurt you in so many ways
I will rape your soul
