Again and again
I languish in vain

My mind made my heart a prison of feelings
HAPPINESS is stuffing between two disappointments
I need your problems, I need that sacrifice
I need to accept the thing that I am MY FEAR IS LIFE

Life is suffering - A heart lost the fight
But I neutralize this sentence
Then everything can be no more than our dance - Then at once
Because of you - Everything will lose its relevance

CALL ME SMART
CALL ME DIAMOND

When object of desire
Resisting the rain
Letting it fall
Without a trace

...And sudden tears fall...

Life is suffering - A heart lost the fight
But I neutralize this sentence
Then everything can be no more than our dance - Then at once
Because of you - Everything will lose its relevance

Yeah
I found what s made of pure matter; It will never spoil
And one can always come back; reassuring me
HAPPINESS CAN BE achieved through power and
The best cure has always been victory ... VICTORY

Again and again - I languish in vain...
