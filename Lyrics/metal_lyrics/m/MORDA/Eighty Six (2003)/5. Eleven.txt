IF I WAS BEAUTIFUL
As a divine surrounded by roses
There I see you shine

Waiting and waiting
MISANTHROPE, how long can I hold your hand
waiting and waiting
precious at least I don t need YOUR HOPE

A slave is a master in disguise
HOW HARD WE TRY inside I just hear cries
IGNORANCE IS -- MY CHERISHED MEMORY
All our slip slop bullshit misanthrope just bury me
Every dream breaking up the wall
Are so many tears more for me to fall
Surviving through the void
A drop, a life, it's not worth while
waiting and waiting
