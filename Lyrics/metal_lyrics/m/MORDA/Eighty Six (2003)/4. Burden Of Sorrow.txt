I need salvation I FEEL THE PAIN

I WILL never turn my back on on you
It is their incompetence we have have to pay
Sensitive

I hate those who've FOUND THEIR TREASURE
And I assign each of them only the burden
They can bear ASPIRATION
I could picture myself all that bitter cold winter
Trying to read our book
And never get passed the first new pages
So I m going to hold on to what little I have

WOUNDS TOO DEEP
scars to my heart
hypostatized
BY A BURDEN
OF SORROW
