I make mistakes
BUT IT WILL REMAIN
As long as I can see their eyes in pain
And your hands so fucking full of bloodstains

Once there were soldiers; emotions keeping down in the mind
With the message of altruism coming out of the gun
The sun went out the militance melts down
But it's surely nothing to be proud off

When will I bleach MY HAIR
What T SHIRT will I wear

Solutions about different kinds
Of pollutions, ALL IN THE NAME OF REVOLUTION

WE HAD IT ALL

But growing up in complexity; Led idealism into a downfall
