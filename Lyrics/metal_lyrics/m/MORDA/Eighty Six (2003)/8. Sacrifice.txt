THE WORDS they said enough
they had enough

Let me take you on a dance through life
consider this -- CONSIDER ME
The life in you eyes -- The joy I despise

When a river runs around US
Then time will come in disguise
Although my wings are too sharpened
not to LOSE YOU
I'll walk the shores in excile -- AN ALLEGIANCE; kicked and bruised

Just to give me you

I'll walk the shores in excile -- Although I know it will take a while
consider this -- consider me HEAVEN WILL HAVE TO WAIT

I'm trying to find the keys not to live in dreams
Cause that's THE ESSENCE OF OUR EXISTENCE
Just to give me you
