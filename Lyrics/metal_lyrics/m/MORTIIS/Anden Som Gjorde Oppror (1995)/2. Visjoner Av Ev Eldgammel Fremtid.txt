Utalige Ã¥r har gÃ¥tt seden tyrannen - vokteren
av alle nÃ¸kler og herren over tids-veggene
var spudd ut. Av en svak mennesklig hun...han
var ei elsketav naturens elementarer. Hverken
jord eller vann holdt han hÃ¸yt og han, han
hatet naturen den jordlige ukjente
fientlige naturen....

[English translate: Visions of an ancient future]

Many years have passed since the tyrant - the guardian
of all keys and the master of the time-walls
was spit out. By a weak human she...he 
was not loved by the elements of nature. 
Neither earth nor water was held high by him, 
he hated the nature, the earthly unknown
hostile nature.
