Mental Maelstrom beckons me,
To fall into the core.
The Centre of the universe,
Mocks me forevermore.

Who awoke the engine when i could not its key?
Who landed me upon this place,
This island in the sea?

(There's) four or five thousand clouds,
All inside my head.
I'm looking for the mind i had,
How long has it been dead?

Eighteen thousand Million years,
with Aeons in between.
Cannot save me from my fears,
Of things i might have seen.

What did you see?
Who did you see?

Don't want to go back to that place.
Don't want to go back to my soul.
My spirit in a vacuum. Spirit in a vacuum.
My spirit in a vacuum.

Mental Maelstrom, that is you.
You've killed my inner sun.
The sacrifices that i made,
I want them all undone.

You put the engine back to sleep,
When I thougth I'd found the key.
Now that I am stranded here,
You return to Misery.

How can I kill the alien mind,
That tries to be me'
I've seen the vacuums eye,
And now i see the thing that I be.

Don't want to go back to that place.
Don't want to go back to my soul.

Spirit in a vacuum.
My spirit in a vacuum.
