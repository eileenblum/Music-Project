Go away from me.
I just want to flee.
The god i used to be.
Fill me no more with glee.

Where am I now?
Upon whom to bestow,
The Secrets locked inside.
The universe I hide.

The Monolith is I.
It was always me.
This world has always been,
The place I really lived in.

Here i stand, alone.
My soul has turned to stone.
Half my kingdom to,
Him that helps me through.
