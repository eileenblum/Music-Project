Bleeding naked torn asunder Lies busted open your world went under Your truth is a lie ugly and belated. Your mind disconnected your body sedated  ThereÂ´s a difference that you cannot tell Not even in the very depths of hell For all the falsehoods that you serve ThereÂ´s not a single lash you donÂ´t deserve  You tried to buy my sympathy But you wonÂ´t get another inch from me Just like you sold your empathy Rubbing it all over your dignity  Is your love so defect Or is your hate so perfect? Blame puts itself where it donÂ´t belong Wicked points at sin piling up the wrongs
