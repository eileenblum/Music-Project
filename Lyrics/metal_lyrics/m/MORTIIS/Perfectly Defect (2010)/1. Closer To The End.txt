It only took a second and it all fell down You turn your back for a moment and youÂ´re back on the ground YouÂ´re lost and everyone around you got old Nothing quite like the sense of losing control  You can spend a lifetime believing and pretending But youÂ´re really just another step closer to the end You spent a lifetime amending, atoning, condescending You got the biggest soul but is it really neverending?  Cause you are really just one step closer to the end We are really just one step closer to the end  Well youÂ´ve been trying to find a place that isnÂ´t so cold But you just canÂ´t seem to find a way out of that hole Everything you ever did, everything you tried was in vain YouÂ´re getting smaller and youÂ´re wishing it was someone elseÂ´s pain  So you own everyone, everyoneÂ´s afraid of you It only took a second and you ruined someone new Oh you got it made, the blood belongs to somebody else But soon enough youÂ´re gonna know how emptiness feels  Cause you are really just one step closer to the end We are really just one step closer to the end  When all is dead and gone YouÂ´re not the only one When all your hope is gone No you are not alone
