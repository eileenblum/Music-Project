Need it I donÂ´t want it I need it I donÂ´t want it  I find it impossible Just impossible to repent Living wih this unbelievable dissent Every door is closed to me  The devotion you demand So incomprehensible to me The love of God is a love unreal I canÂ´t repent what I canÂ´t feel  I donÂ´t need this provocation I donÂ´t want this confrontation You will not grant me salvation You will not have my devotion I donÂ´t need it need it need it I donÂ´t need I need this absolution
