You have to reap what you sow And perhaps, perhaps you will grow You have to claim that guilt And accept it as your own  Oh why did you come to me my son  Why did you come to me my son WhatÂ´s your sin what have you done? Have you done as you deem right What ails you son what is your plight?  Oh why did you come to me my son  DonÂ´t wanna live forever DonÂ´t wanna die too young Too many places that I havenÂ´t been Too many places that I havenÂ´t seen for so long  For all this time itÂ´s been building up Like the seven seas in a very small cup Sedated I was dead I was numb Now I got some luggage and it weighs a ton  Why did you come to me my son  Hold your ground, donÂ´t falter donÂ´t leave Never forget what it was like to believe IÂ´m gonna persevere After all itÂ´s only fear  Oh why did you come to me my son  Looks like I donÂ´t need you no more
