I am the world
the world beyond the stars...
I am the keeper of screaming mountains,
the portal between worlds...
A world of wonder,
a world of glory.

I was created by a scribbling hand,
by a mind that always believed...
That his mind could create me...
Where is he now?
The god from beyond...
I have never seen him,
yet we have always been together...
