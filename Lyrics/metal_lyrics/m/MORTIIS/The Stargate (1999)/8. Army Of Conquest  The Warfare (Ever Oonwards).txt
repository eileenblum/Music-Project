The stars form the gate again
Soon we shall arrive in the new world...
Soon merciless war and destruction
Shall fall upon the unknowing...
Weapon in hand and death in our eyes
We march to attack...
Soon the folk of here shall feel
Our wrath and steel...

We conquer now this world...

Released 1999 by Earache Records.
