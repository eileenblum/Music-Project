Capture it, de-humanize it.
You nurture it, you devour it.
Promise it, you lie to it.
And you doubt in it.
See yourself in it.

Twist the knife, watch as it dies.

Be loved by it, but ignoring it.
You feel the hate in it, escape from it.
Laugh at it, ridicule it.
Misunderstand, spit at it.

Twist the knife, watch as it dies.
Steal away it's life, untouched my its cries.

Twist the knife.
To the very bone.
Steal away it's life.
Until it's dead and gone.

Disrespect it and deceive it.
Underestimate, be scared of it.
Kill the faith, kill the love.
And turn your back, walk away.

Twist the knife, watch as it dies.

Twist the knife.
Ignore its pain.
You steal away it's life.
You cut the last remaining vein.
