I could have found a way.
I would have found a way.

Did you want me to break down?
Did you want me to give in?

Found so many ways to hate myself.
Found so many ways to put them all away.

Don't care if the whole world falls apart.
Don't care if you hated me from the start...

You bring out the worst in me!

Pick and peel it off, this dried up skin.
Strip it away, this flesh and gore.
Open it up, the stink of you sin.
Was it holy as you hoped, at heart, at the core?

Did you want me to break down?

Found so many ways to hate myself.

Don't care if the whole world falls apart.
Don't care if you hated me from the start...

You bring out the worst in me!

I make you stronger.
You make me weaker.
Can't take this much longer...
Since I stopped being a seeker.

Don't care if the whole world falls apart.
Don't care if you hated me from the start...

You bring out the worst in me!

I make you stronger.
You make me weaker.
Can't take this any longer.
Since I stopped being a seeker...

Rip and tear this un-bleeding dead.
Naked and cold, nothing left to steal.
Can't get it back, wish I was dead instead.
It will never close, this fucking sore will never heal!

I am a ghost, you are my host.
You will never see me again.
