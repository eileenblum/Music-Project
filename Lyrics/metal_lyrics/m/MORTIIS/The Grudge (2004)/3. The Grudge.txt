Trying to think of you as come kind of heroine.
Trying to think of you as somethin' that will fade with time.
Trying to think of you as some kind of distant sin.
Trying to think of you as yesterday's forgotten dream.

Things that you said, and the things that you never did.
Things that you did, and the things that you never said.
Left me empty and alone, kinda tryin' to atone.
Empty and alone, the only thing that's real.

You must be an emotional heretic.
Your word has become like shit on a stick.
No matter how hard I tried.
Someone close to me lied, now I carry the grudge.

Things that you said, and the things that you never did.
Things that you did, and the things that you never said.
Left me empty and alone, kinda tryin' to atone.
Empty and alone, the only thing that's real.

How could someone be so elusive?
How could someone be so fuckin' passive?
Even if I walk through all the circles of hell for you
You wouldn't even piss on me.
But it's too late, it's too late my dear.
Because I'm already there!

You've become an emotional heretic.
Your word was always shit on a stick.
No matter how hard I tried.
You fucking had to lie.
Empty and alone, the only thing that's real!
Empty and alone, the only thing that's real!
Empty and alone, the only thing that's real!
Empty and alone, the only thing that's real!

How can someone be so elusive?
How can someone be so fuckin' passive?
Even if I walk through all the circles of hell for you.
You wouldn't even piss on me.
But it's too late, it's too late my dear.
Because I'm already there!
