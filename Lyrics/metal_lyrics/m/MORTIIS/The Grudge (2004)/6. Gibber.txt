(They) tell me I ain't real.
That I'm a fantasy.
How do you think it makes me feel.
To be the fifth wheel.
No one believes in me.
Believe in me.

It's a bitter place or just a bitter dream.
It's a stranger's face, so it's hated by man.
Or so it would seem...
So it would seem...

You can't look at what you've made.
But you know I'm part of you.
I know you wish me dead and you want me gone.
But there's nothing you can do.
I am the one you fear, the one you fear.
I am the one you fear, the one you fear.

You're blinded by your kind.
Altogether so astray.
Owner of a programmed mind.
Don't know night from day.
Night from day.

What happened to us all?
Who's got the right to say?
How we should behave.
So we can all be enslaved.
Be enslaved.

You can't look at what you've made.
But you know I'm part of you.
I know you wish me dead and you want me gone.
But there's nothing you can do.
I am the one you fear, the one you fear.
I am the one you fear, the one you fear.
