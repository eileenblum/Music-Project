She bought all the good Karma in the world.
And now... She throws it all away.

She stole God's light, she stole it for herself.
To make her dark night turn in to day.

She thinks she's found, found her very self.
But can she make it, can she make it stay?

She would be climbing up the mountain.
She would be searching through the desert.
But her God would not have spoken.
Nor let her pass dry through the sea.

And now she throws it away.
When God has nothing to say.
Her God, she threw him away.
He never had much to say.
