I got you down I got you good
I killed you dead I got you out of my head

I'm burning up inside the demons are back
I'm burning up inside the demons are back

I am your fire your every desire
I'm serpentine I'm your violent dream

I'm burning up inside the demons are back
I'm burning up inside the demons are back

I'm burning up inside with this animosity
All the shit I try to hide so raked with hostility

I'm burning up inside the demons are back
I'm burning up inside the demons are back

Don't call me nothing
Nothing means nothing to me
Don't call your demons
Your demons mean nothing to me
I walked in darkness
Your darkness means nothing to me
Don't call your army
Your bullets they cannot hurt me
