I resist but you insist a blow of the hammer and I'm back in the slammer

Get down on your knees! You can't kill me I'm already dead
Get down on your knees! You can't kill me did you hear what I said

Still I resist oh now he's pissed someone stole his whip and it's sorely missed

Feed the greed and the need
To own and patronize us
Like some power crazy Jesus

Oh he wants to harm me from the back of his army
Stinking little cunt now he's in for the hunt

Get down on your knees! You can't kill me I'm already dead
Get down on your knees! You can't kill me did you hear what I said

He thinks I'm so dumb won't let me suck on the crumb
Oh he's got his high on get ready for the fuckathon

Feed the greed and the need
To own and patronize us
Like some power crazy Jesus
