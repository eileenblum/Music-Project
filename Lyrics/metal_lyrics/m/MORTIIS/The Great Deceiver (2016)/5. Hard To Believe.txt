Maybe I was wrong
Maybe I was right
Maybe it was anger
Maybe it was me

How could this have been so different?
How could this be undone?
But it feels so insistent
I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know

The fights and the lies the deceit I despise
Was it true was it you I can't feel was it real?
How low can you sink how sick of the stink
Your mind is a tar pit and I get stuck in it

Used to be a king not a thing
Until I looked at my soul in a hole
And saw a life made of filth and some guilt
And then I knew it was true
I have to thank you. Thank you

It's hard to believe it's hard to believe I'm still here
It's hard to believe it's hard to believe at all
It's hard to believe it's hard to believe I'm still here
It's hard to believe it's hard to believe at all

Should I swallow it all?
Pretend it was all a bad dream?
Or have I been so small
I missed something in between?

The fights and the lies the deceit I despise
Was it true was it you I can't feel was it real?
How low can you sink how sick of the stink
Your mind is a tar pit and I get stuck in it

Used to be a king not a thing
Until I looked at my soul in a hole
And saw a life made of filth and some guilt
And then I knew it was true
I have to thank you. Thank you

It's hard to believe it's hard to believe I'm still here
It's hard to believe it's hard to believe at all
It's hard to believe it's hard to believe I'm still here
It's hard to believe it's hard to believe at all
