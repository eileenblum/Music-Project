I wanna take it all away
I need to pillage loot and rape
I want everything you own
Just because I do
I can never get enough
I need to rape and violate
Just to prove that I'm a man

I'm a pig and I want you
I need to rape and kill that stuff
I need to desecrate I need to subdue
The air you breathe I'll take that too
'Cause I'm a pig and I want you

I make you work I make you sweat
Just to prove that I'm a man
I bleed you dry so I can live
The king of thievery breaks his back on the wheel of misery

I spit and scream at you and yours
I live to beat this dying horse
Resent contempt repent dissent
The sin within the waste debased
I built my life on a fucked up lie
One foot in the grave and you wonder why?

I'm a pig and I want you
I need to rape and kill that stuff
I need to desecrate I need to subdue
The air you breathe I'll take that too
'Cause I'm a pig and I want you

I make you work I make you sweat
Just to prove that I'm a man
I bleed you dry so I can live
Writhe and slithe with kit and kin your poisoned body reeks of sin

I make you work I make you sweat
Just to prove that I'm a man
I bleed you dry so I can live
The king of thievery breaks his back on the wheel of misery
