Master stares with his only eye
Master shouts but he cannot cry
Tries to bite but he has no teeth
Sucking it up like a human leech

Master sits like a glutton at the feast
Master feeds inside the belly of the beast
I'm not you I know this
I'd rather drink to death on your finest piss

For the sake of who I thought you were
For the sake of the illusion that you are
God has such a pretty charisma
God is such an attractive enigma

No I'll never understand
So this is your gain?
No sedation known to man
Could ever numb this pain

We're stealing the earned
We're scalding the burnt
We scream at the crying
We're killing the dying

Master stares with his only eye
Master shouts but he cannot cry
Tries to bite but he has no teeth
Sucking it up like a human leech

Master sits like a glutton at the feast
Master feeds inside the belly of the beast
I'm not you I know this
I'd rather drink to death on your finest piss

We're stealing the earned
We're scalding the burnt
We scream at the crying
We're killing the dying

I hate us
I hate us
I hate us
I hate us
