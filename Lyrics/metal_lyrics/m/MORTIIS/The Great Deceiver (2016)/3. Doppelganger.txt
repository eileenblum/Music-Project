I am the only one you can really trust

I was never part of what you conceived
I never ever shared what you believed
I never cared for anything you did
I don't give a fuck about what you think you need

I am the only one you can really
Trust to never care
Trust to never share
The things you have to fear
The shit you had to hear
Trust to look away
Trust to never stay
To help you through the day
To keep them dogs at bay

I don't wanna be a part of your so called plan
I don't wanna waste myself all in vain
I don't wanna fight but I have to take a stand
I don't think you'll ever change you'll stay the same

I am the only one you can really
Trust to never care
Trust to never share
The things you have to fear
The shit you had to hear
Trust to look away
Trust to never stay
To help you through the day
To keep them dogs at bay

I was never part of what you conceived
I never ever shared what you believed
I never cared for anything you did
I don't give a fuck about what you think you need

I am the only one you can really
Trust to never care
Trust to never share
The things you have to fear
The shit you had to hear
Trust to look away
Trust to never stay
To help you through the day
To keep them dogs at bay
