I'll say anything I think you wanna hear me say
I think everything I feel is true so long as I reach through
All these years with nothing to say I said it anyway

I'll do anything I think you might want me to do
I think everything I do is true as long as I reach through

How can someone be so lost show me out I'll pay the cost
I need a cane I need a rod I need the shining lamp of god
How can someone feel so much why am I so out of touch
I need a cane I need a rod I need the shining lamp of god

Oh you wanna taste it all but where will you be when I fall?
Oh you think you're something new but I know you oh I know you
Where does all this pain come from? I look around to blame someone
You'll be here with everyone but will you be here when they've gone?
All you do is fake the game and I hate you and I hate you

How can someone be so lost show me out I'll pay the cost
I need a cane I need a rod I need the shining lamp of god
How can someone feel so much why am I so out of touch
I need a cane I need a rod I need the shining lamp of god

How can someone be so lost show me out I'll pay the cost
I need a cane I need a rod I need the shining lamp of god
How can someone feel so much why am I so out of touch
I need a cane I need a rod I need the shining lamp of god
