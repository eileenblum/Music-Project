As I descend into what is left of me
I have to fix up my soul so I can learn to see

The more I bleed I never led like you
The more you bleed you never bled like me
But the more I change the more I stay the same
I need to cut these ties I need to bleed these lies

I wanna hurt myself just to remind me
Where I used to be where you've always been

The more I bleed I never led like you
The more you bleed you never bled like me
But the more I change the more I stay the same
I need to cut these ties I need to bleed these lies

I wanna hurt myself so I can bleed like you
I left your shit behind you're stuck I made it through

The more I bleed I never led like you
The more you bleed you never bled like me
But the more I change the more I stay the same
I need to cut these ties I need to bleed these lies

I never bleed like you I never bled like you
I never bleed like you I never bled like you
