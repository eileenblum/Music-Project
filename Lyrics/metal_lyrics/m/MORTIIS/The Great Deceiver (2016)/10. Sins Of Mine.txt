Here they come the sins I don't know how to erase
All the empty faces in all the big empty spaces
From below they come they drift and they climb
It must have been quite a crime all these sins of mine
My sensed dulled my memories are vague
But all this doubting stage was it all a big mistake?

Was it all a big mistake?

Here it comes again that old feeling of defeat
It's an enemy I don't wanna meet surrender never felt so sweet
Oh no here it comes again that old bitter friend
The undeniable resent I never said the things I meant
Here I am all alone here I stand on my own
Who wants to throw the first stone?

Was it all a big mistake?

But in the end who really gives a fuck if it was me or you
We're dead anyhow we're dead anyhow we're dead anyhow
You and I are through
