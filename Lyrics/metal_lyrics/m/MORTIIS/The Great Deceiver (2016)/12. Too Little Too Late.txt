I'm in too deep
I've been in too long
I'm out of my league now
'Cause it's just too fucking strong

I'm in above my head
I'm in above my faith
I'm in above my head now
I'm in above my faith

I think it's too late now
But it was never too soon
I think it's time to believe now
This space belongs to you yeah you

Too little too late
No sleep too deep
Too little too late
I'm in too deep I'm in too deep

Who made you god anyway?
When did I ask you to
Tell me what to do and tell me what to say?
Man I never trusted you

It's out of my hands now
I just don't have the grip
I guess we could hold on somehow
Or we could just let it slip

I think it's too late now
But it was never too soon
I think it's time to believe now
This space belongs to you yeah you

Too little too late
No sleep too deep
Too little too late
I'm in too deep I'm in too deep
