Everyone is moving on moving on moving on
Looks like my only chance has come and gone

I am frozen in time
This alien disguise
These crumbling lies of mine
Are written in your eyes

I wish that I could choose a warmer heart
I wish that I could get a second start

Everyone listen they listen to me fail
I don't know the right words and my voice is so damn frail

I am frozen in time
This alien disguise
These crumbling lies of mine
Are written in your eyes

I wish that I could choose a warmer heart
I wish that I could get a second start

Feeble needy that's how you see me
Feed me breed me that's how you get me
Taunt me taint me that's how you kill me
See me hear me now you're with me

Dust it off rise above
Ignore the hurt it will be gone

Nothing's gonna stop me on my road to ruin
Nothing's gonna stop me on my way to hell

(My only friend has many a name
My truest friend will always remain
My oldest friend your name is pain
This is the end this is my change)
