Burn me alive
This place is dead to me
A breeding ground of tragedy
My enemies at my arms length
A dark past right at my heels
This place is the death of me
With its familiarity
Breathing down my tired neck
In the company of the sick
Burn me alive
This is not 
Hell but you can see it from here
In the place I have grown to fear
Where devils laugh and angels cry
Where light and dark collide
The red sky is searing me
Swallowing my serenity
Where hatred makes its nest
Inside my hollowed chest
There's nothing sacred here
In the valley of solitude
We take pain with gratitude
There's nothing sacred here
Where death has gone to hide
Where light and dark collide
There's nothing sacred here
