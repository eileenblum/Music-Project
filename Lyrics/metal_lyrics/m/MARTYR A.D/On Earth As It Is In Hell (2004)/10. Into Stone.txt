Nesting a seed of hate in my bones
This a sacrament
Telling me to hide away
Never again will they have
Strip the life out of their eyes
A gift of torture
Telling me there is no way
Out of this fucked up world
No way out of this dying world
I dream of silence
A place where only sadness lives
A tongueless existence
This muted life I give to you
Another tragic hero
That bastard child here is me
Rejected from the womb
This chance to live was my chance to breathe
My Chance to breathe
A ruthless bitch with a carrion smile
Guides my hands and blinds me
Give me life, give me death
Show me how to hate them all
I never asked any favors of them
They never gave any in return
A sad death of another sick mother fucker
Another headline unread
Carve my name in stone
