[I. Diagnosis]

[Instrumental]

[II. Terminal]

You're a thief in the night
Soul stealer, seller of fright
Sever the cords of the voiceless
Just to show your might
Your words like daggers
From your throat
I've seen them kill
Now I'll watch you choke
You're a villain
In disguise
A devil in angel wings
We're calling
Calling you out
It's time to revolt
The real me
Could fucking destroy you
The real me
Could fucking kill
I will fucking destroy you
I look through
The eyes of hell
