I won't be saved
Say a prayer for me
Because I fucking need one
Ghosts sent to torment me
Bleeding me every fucking night
I can taste my private hell
Grinning as it envelops me
I was born with a mark on my head
I will die with the heart of the damned
If I could just
Play dead forever
Maybe I could make sense of this
I'am slowing down, I'am giving up
This surreality is fucking choking me
If this is my life, I've had enough
This black reality
Is a sad excuse for life
Another night brings home
Another fucking rain
So say another prayer for me
But I won't be saved
Breathing an air of disgust
Cut from the cloth of disgrace
Watching this misery dance
Along the lines in my face
Say a prayer for me
But I won't be saved
Watching misery dance along my face
