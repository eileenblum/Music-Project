Our pagan blood is boiling,
Our pagan veins are filled with hate
Beware of our anger
Or join the world wide war...

Our pagan souls have awakened
prepare for war... prepare for war
Our pagan souls have awakened
feel the hate... pagan war

No remorse or mercy,
all useless blood we will waste,
Stand up and be counted
and join the world wide war.

Our pagan souls have awakened.
The war begins...
Our pagan souls have awakened.
Enjoy the hate... pagan war.

Feel the pagan in your heart,
now feel the pride flow.
Accept your fate, stand up
and join the world wide war.

War, hate and aggressions,
we shall win this war...
War, war, war...
We will rule this world.

Our pagan souls have awakened
prepare for war... prepare for war
Our pagan souls have awakened
feel the hate... pagan war
