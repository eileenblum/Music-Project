On black wings of retaliation
Towards an endless sky
Raven set its final course
In search for waiting lands

Raging storms are howling
Screaming out in pain
Will we live to tell...

Maelstroems slowly rises
Rises from the depth
Glowing eyes of death and pain
A thousand men to keep

The dragon bravely battles
In the jaws of hell
Let the North Star lead our way

Silence, behold, at last
Under the stars is our destiny

Hear the song of Valkyries
Hear tomorrow call
Odin owns ye all
Sacred land before our hand
A victory is won
Odin owns ye all
