Hear me runes
My blood binds my soul to you
Reveal yourself and the secrets
of the night and days of nine
Cast them out
Not one, not two, but three I read
Tell me now
Will death or glory be your final will

One for the past
Urd will weave your destiny
One for now
Verdandi twines your present life
One for the future
Will Skuld tear your thread apart
Will I find my way
And never give my
enemies some rest

First one is Reid, bringer of order
rune of Thor, protector of your path
Inner strength from Algiz and Dagaz
will guide your way

Call, call of the runes
Bring order in my life and lead my way
They're calling me, my destiny they lead
Forever I am bound
to the fate of Norns

Four corners of the earth I have travelled
On the sea I was one with the stars
Alone and afraid in the face of the world
I cried out to the gods for my way
And as lightning struck I saw a glimpse
of land and a building with a cross on
And they told me that if we don't fight
it will be our end
