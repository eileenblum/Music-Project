Korpen blickar Ã¶ver morgonens hav,
fÃ¤ller sina vingar ut.
LÃ¥ter vinden fylla hans sjÃ¤l,
torkar den kalla nattan vÃ¤ck.

Delling i Ã¶st, stjÃ¤rnor i vÃ¤st...

Korpen lyfter mot gryningens port,
sveper Ã¶ver skogarnas djup.
Blickar ned mot midgÃ¥rds mark,
ty gryning Ã¤r mÃ¤nniskans hopp.

Se dagen i Ã¶st, natten i vÃ¤st,
se Skinfaxes man, i himmelens djup...

Gryningens ljus, flammande hav,
silverne vÃ¤v, ty Delling kommer med hopp...

[English:]

The raven gazes upon the sea of morning,
unfolding his wings. He lets the wind fill
his soul, dry out the humid night.

Dawn in the east, stars in the west...

The raven takes off towards the gate of dawn,
sweeps over the depths of the forests.
Gazes down on the ground of Midgard.
For the dawn is the hope of mankind.

See the day in the east, the night in the west,
see the mane of Skinfaxe, in the depth of heaven...

The light of dawn, flaming sea, web of silver, for
Dawn comes bringing hope...
