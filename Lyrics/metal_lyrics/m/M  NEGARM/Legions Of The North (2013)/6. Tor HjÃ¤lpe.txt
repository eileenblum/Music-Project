Now listen up
The world is at its end
I had a vision
Cold and grey and damned
Hey
Do you still believe?
The stars in your eyes
Has somehow taken its leave

And I still donât know
The reason why Iâm still alive
And I still canât find
The motivation to go on andâ¦

As we die
Like worms
Crawling blind
In this world of filth (Man)

The mountains crumble
The sky is cracked open
A Nordic battle rage
The hammer to the cross
Tor HjÃ¤lpe!
Cast the serpent out
Our lands are burning
As the flame purifies the north
