I am the one
My time has come
I will lead the legions
Trough the ice and snow
With hunger and diseases
Starvation and despair
Iâll reign my kingdom of death
I am the abandoned one

Cast down to a land of pain
With winds cold as ice
Crippled and broken by the fall
But I will rise again

With vengeance in our minds
We march towards the war
When all is done and we have won
Death will ride again

Over falling depravity
Trough sickness and calamity
See me ride on these fields of death
I collect your empty souls

The sound of drums
And a thousand feet
That cuts the silent night
Our hordes arrive
Fear your lives
The time has come to die

With vengeance in our minds
We march towards the dawn
When all is done and we have won
I will ride again
The sound of war
The blood and gore
We will make you bleed
An evil storm over land forlorn
I will cut you down

In blackened eyes, a power and might
Days of light, embraced by the night
Now hear my call, I am the chosen one
We will never fall
