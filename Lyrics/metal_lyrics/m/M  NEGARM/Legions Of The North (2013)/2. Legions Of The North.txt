To war!
Unite the tribes of the north
Blood vengeance
Let the sword talk

Time has come to end our curse
Our journey to the dark days

Lead us!
Avenge all that was lost
Itâs time
To take our honor back

Bring them forth to judgement
Avenge their false prophets crimes

I see your empire fall
And I see your death
I hear the raven call
Odin ride with us
Save us all

Now rise, my legions of the north
Rise, to victory and death
Rise, my legions of the north
Rise, warriors of the gods

Gugner is thrown
The valkyrie sings
As our Viking army charge
Strike them hard
Remember the dead
The ride of Asgard

Rise my legions of the north
Rise my legions of the north
Rise my legions of the north
Rise my legions of the north
