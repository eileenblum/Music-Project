Thunderstorms roar
In the midnight sky
Like echoes from the past
A silent rain falls from above
As my tears roll down the eye
I remember a time
Not far from now
When all was calm and peace
Then came the storm,
that burning storm
And swept it all away

I remember a time
Not far from now
When I was whole, as one
My strength and pride
The blood of mine
I guarded by my side
I can still hear the sound,
that distant sound
Hooves thundered the ground
Forced to leave my beloveds side
I knew the time had come

In the starlit night
Blood was shed
Drenched the northern ground
I fought, I bled, I died inside
As it all was taken away
Alone I stood
Alone Iâll be

A promise made that night
Eye for an eye tooth for a tooth
A promise made in blood
You shall fall

In the starlit night
Blood was shed all over the ground
You fought,
you bled and you died inside
As it all was taken away
Alone youâll stand, alone youâll be
Until weâll meet again
