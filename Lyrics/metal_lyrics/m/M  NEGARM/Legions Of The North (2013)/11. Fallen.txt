Barely awake, my bodyâs weak
My senses almost numb
Scarred and torn, my sightâs dim
Before my eyes this haze of grey
The blood runs cold
When my life starts to fade
A stench of death is in the air
Nothing is real except the pain I feel
The wine of the raven
Is buried in the soilâ¦ of Nerthus

Wounded and lonely
Iâm accepting my fate
Woven to decide a warriors hate
A cold freezing breeze touches my skin
Iâm to tired to even feel
The memories of life pass before my eyes
Memories of a life that I once had
Although I know that my time has come
I struggle, try to stay awake

Left alone, all alone
I know my time has come
Left alone, all alone
Iâm covered in blood,
all buried in blood
The sun no more shines
I enter the night
I finally close my eyes

Am I awake, the pain has left
My mindâs at ease, free at last
Thereâs nothing more,
all promises fulfilled
The river of the sword
Is the last thing I see

Left alone, all alone
I know my time has come
Left alone, all alone
Iâm covered in blood,
buried in blood
The sun no more shines
I enter the night
I finally close my eyes

The ending is near
The hall of my fathers awaits me
I soon will be there
See me valkyries
Hear me, Iâm ready to die

Left alone, all alone
The sun no more shines
I enter the night
I finally close my eyes
