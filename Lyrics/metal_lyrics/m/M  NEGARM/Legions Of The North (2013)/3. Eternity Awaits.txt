Donât fear, heads up high
To live, you must die
Donât crawl, stand your ground
True strength, will be found

Give me wisdom, my friend Death
Crush the illusion, my friend Death

Dull blades, rusty armor
Cowards licking the poison of the snake
Forgotten kings, lost in shadows
The fall of men has begun

Give me wisdom, my friend Death
Crush the illusion, my friend Death

Bring upon me scorn and hate
Bring upon me pain
Bring upon me death
Eternity awaits

Whispers in my blood,
my forgotten friend
Grant me the ancient knowledge
Teach me how to live again
A thousand years of hell,
a life without a path
They took your gods away
Itâs time for vengeance,
let them feel your wrath
