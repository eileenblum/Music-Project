[Music: Monument Of Misanthropy, lyrics: George Wilfinger]

Hideous world domination
Third world's mass starvation
Victims of a state-controlled
Oppressive taxation

Man-made coarctation
Provoked mass migration
Victims of a state-controlled

Predation

Corrupt politicians they are under
General suspicion - all part of this
Deathmatch competition

Paved road to our perdition
Paving the way
Paving our way
Leading our way
Leading human scum to its perdition
Leading the rats to their damnation!

Lost within this maze
Of hate and disgrace
A fall into decline
The human race resigns
Lost within this maze
Of hate and disgrace
All we're praying for
Human race resign!

The end of the line!

Corrupt politicians they are under
General suspicion - all part of this
Sick competition

Lost within this maze
Of hate and disgrace
A fall into decline
The human race resigns
Lost within this maze
Of hate and disgrace
All we're praying for
Human race resign!
