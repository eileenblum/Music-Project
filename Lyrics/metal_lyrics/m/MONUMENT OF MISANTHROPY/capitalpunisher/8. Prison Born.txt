[originally by The Faceless]Lower life forms kept from their senses
Third dimensional imprisonment
Psychological tactics enforcing thralldom
Generations of conditioning
Hereditary indoctrination of the youth
Breeding disconnection
A perception of right and wrong installed by an unearthly party
With agendas of control
Never to be questioned
Too blind to see that we are prison born
Programmed to hate and fear
Disconnected consciousness
Lives dictated by ignorance
Cowering in fear of their dogma
We are bound to a state of physical dimension
Never to move beyond and break free from the prison born
