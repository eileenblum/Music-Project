[Music: Monument Of Misanthropy, lyrics: George Wilfinger]

Baal - unleash the beast
Only for me

See me fighting through the turmoil

Kept on deathrow
Shatter their hopes
Dealing out the motherfucking death
Blows

See me fighting through the turmoil
Kept on deathrow
Shatter their hopes
Dealing out the motherfucking death
Blows

Kept on deathrow
Shattering all their last hopes
Dealing out the deathblows
Shattering all their last hopes

Kept on deathrow -
Shatter their hopes-

Kept on deathrow
Shattering all their last hopes
Dealing out the deathblows
Shattering all their last hopes

This killing spree
It's freeing me
As I cut your limbs
Your eyes growing dim

Baal - unleash the beast
Only for me

See me fighting through the turmoil

Kept on deathrow
Shatter their hopes
Dealing out the motherfucking death
Blows

As I cut your limbs
Your eyes growing dim

Killing spree
It's in me
Killing spree
Freeing me

Killing spree
It's in me
Killing spree
It's in me
It's in me
