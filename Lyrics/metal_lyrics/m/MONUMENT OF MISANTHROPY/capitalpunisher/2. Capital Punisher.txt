[Music: Monument Of Misanthropy, lyrics: George Wilfinger]

Fixation of the head cruelly tight
Victims shivering in mortal fright

A bestial delight

Ripping guts head to butt
Feel the scalpel's murderous deep cuts
Brain exposed with a butcher's saw
Your blood in streams starts to flow

Ripping guts head to butt
Feel the scalpel's murderous deep cuts
Brain exposed with a butcher's saw
Opening your last episode

Turn the screws
You're wet through
In cold sweat
Turn the screws
You're wet through
In cold sweat

Spooning human brains
While you faint
They're eating you alive
Bestially inhumane

Brute craniectomy
You struggle in agony
Removing titanium plates
Cracking your skulls with hate

Brute craniectomy
You struggle in agony
Removing titanium plates
Cracking your skulls with hate

Spooning human brains
While you faint
They're eating you alive
Bestially inhumane

Capital punisher

I see your flesh and body
Disfigured beyond recognition
I see the wrath of karma
Has come on you to fruition

Spooning human brains
While you faint
They're eating you alive
Bestially inhumane

Brute craniectomy
You struggle in agony
Removing titanium plates
Cracking your skulls with hate

Brute craniectomy
You struggle in agony
Removing titanium plates
Cracking your skulls with hate

In cold sweat

Turn the screws
You're wet through
In cold sweat
