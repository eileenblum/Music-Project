[Music: Monument Of Misanthropy, lyrics: George Wilfinger]

Beasts â eating through your flesh
Fleas â thriving in your flesh
Never again you'll be slaying â defenceless innocent beings
No matter what you're saying â get treated like â you've been

Disembowelment â guts â gushing on the floor
Bestial torment â pathetic meat hook whore

To the vegan homicide
More â gore
For the vegan homicide

Beasts â eating through your flesh
Fleas â thriving in your flesh
Unheard remains all praying â for me your life's without any meaning

Disembowelment â guts â gushing on the floor
Bestial torment â pathetic meat hook whore
More â gore
I'm making an example for all you animal â¦
Abusers

"Wait and see"
All the pain you've ever caused
Focused on you â in â this moment
Skinning you alive but shackled
For the flies and worms to feast

Beasts â eating through your flesh
Fleas â thriving in your flesh
