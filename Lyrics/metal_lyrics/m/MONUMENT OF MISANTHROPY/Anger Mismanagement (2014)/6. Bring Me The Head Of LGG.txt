[Music: Monument Of Misanthropy, lyrics: George Wilfinger]

Bring me cut off head of LGG

Kill the fuckin' whore â the cunt smells from afar
Dickface â covered in dead meat gone too far
Slaughtered boring old fart â bled dry and ripped apart

Fuckface â we shall wear â your â skin â as our fur

Whore â cunt â whore

Kill the so called "star" â the shit smells from afar
Fuckface â that wears each day a new fur

You rancid piece of shit

You'd better â bring the head of this fucking piece of shit

On the plate of misery

Free Charles Manson and Mark Chapman â
Let 'em do â the donkey work
Free Charles Manson and Mark Chapman â
Let 'em do the blood work

Slaughtered boring old fart â bled dry and ripped apart
Fuckface â now â I â wear your skin â as my fur

On the plate of misery

Bring me the fuckin' cut off head
