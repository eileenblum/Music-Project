[Music: Monument Of Misanthropy, lyrics: George Wilfinger]

Malformation
Relentless economic growth
Unscrupulous â liars under oath
This planet and slaves pine away
Quick profits that â will never pay

This planet and slaves pine away
Quick profits that â will never pay

One species â a malformation

Endless torture is your reward
And your definite gain
And never-ending pain

Mark my words
We will decline â
And with me that's fine

We will decline â
Purified re-design

We will decline â
And with me that's fine

We will decline â
Purified re-design
