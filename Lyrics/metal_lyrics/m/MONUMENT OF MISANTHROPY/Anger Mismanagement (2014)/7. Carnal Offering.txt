[Music: Monument Of Misanthropy, lyrics: George Wilfinger]

Strapped tight to the altar of sick perversions
Ball-gagged plugs penetrate each orifice
Scapegoat offered as human sacrifice
Rejoice in the rectum and malefice

Blood flows as the tourniquet is released
Ball-gagged plugs penetrate each orifice
This cup is the new covenant in your blood
Rejoice in the rectum and malefice

Carnal offering

Rancid stench of blood cum fills the air
Ball-gagged plugs penetrate each orifice
Victims sighs yet in lust yet in sheer despair
Rejoice in the rectum and malefice

Priestessâ cunt girds the nose 'til you cannot breathe
Ball-gagged plugs penetrate each orifice
Face sit - is the end in ever lusting pain
Rejoice in the rectum and malefice

Carnal offering

Strapped tight to the altar of sick perversions
Ball-gagged plugs penetrate each orifice
Scapegoat offered as human sacrifice
Rejoice in the rectum and malefice

Blood flows as the tourniquet is released
Ball-gagged plugs penetrate each orifice
This cup is the new covenant in your blood
Rejoice in the rectum and malefice

Carnal offering

Rancid stench of blood cum fills the air
Ball-gagged plugs penetrate each orifice
Victims sighs yet in lust yet in sheer despair
Rejoice in the rectum and malefice

Priestessâ cunt girds the nose 'til you cannot breathe
Ball-gagged plugs penetrate each orifice
Face sit - is the end in ever lusting pain
Rejoice in the rectum and malefice

Carnal offering
