[Music: Monument Of Misanthropy, lyrics: George Wilfinger]

I prevail upon your failing â exhale my pest disdaining â
Species like you who think they're beyond any doubt and godlike
I impale your every equals â and nail the likes of you on â
The cross of my gruesome monument of misanthropy
Well suffer
Hung and drawn
Quartered thereupon
Impaled and drawn
Nailed upon theâ¦
Monument of misanthropy
Enter the shrine of
Disgusting delights and
Unfathomable human miseries
Hung and drawn
Quartered thereupon
Impaled and drawn
Nailed upon theâ¦

Monument

Watching you
Enter the shrine of disgusting delights
Enter the shrine of disgusting delights.
Enter the shrine
