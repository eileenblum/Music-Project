[Music: Monument Of Misanthropy, lyrics: George Wilfinger]

Brain-dead
All â that I have ever met are just â retarded humans
All â that I have ever heard the bullshit of â phrase mongers
They â can't catch onto the fact â that they're
Brain-dead
They â can't see â they â can't hear â even cannot â tell
See it in your eyes â they're so dull â and fuckin' hollow

Seems â all humans lost their brains â
Seems â they drained all â your cerebral â veins

So they're allâ¦
Brain-dead
All â that I have ever met are just â retarded humans
All â that I have ever heard the bullshit of â phrase mongers
They â can't catch onto the fact â that they're
Brain-dead
Killing the last human brain cell -

They can't seeâ even cannot tell
They can't hear â killing last brain cells
