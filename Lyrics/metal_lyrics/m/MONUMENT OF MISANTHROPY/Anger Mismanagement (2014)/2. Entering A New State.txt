[Music: Monument Of Misanthropy, lyrics: George Wilfinger]

Not born to suffer not to feel pain and regret
Not born to serve you and to live under your threat
Not born a subject to the power craving scum
Not born an underdog that always succumbs

Entering a new state of power redistribution

Not born a subject to the power craving scum
Not born an underdog that always succumbs

Entering a new state of power redistribution

Entering a new state of affairs

Not born a subject
Not born an underdog

Entering a new state of power redistribution
