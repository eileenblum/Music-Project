Born to lose, live to win
Let me tell you about the pleasure of sin
I'm for blood rather to kill
I'm looking for some love to steal
Take you down
I'll drive you hard
I leave 'em hot
I leave 'em scarred
Run like hard for your life
Lock up your daughter
Better lock up your wife

The hotter they come
The hotter they go
Call me a rock 'n roll outlaw
I got a license
I got a license to kill
I got a license to kill

On a screen in the dark
You know I never miss my mark
Lady killer I done deal her
Light the fuse I pull the trigger
Hot night in a passion play
You know I'm always gonna get my way
Now I'm back, back in town
I'm gonna tear it up
I'm gonna burn it down

The hotter they come
The hotter they go
Call me a rock 'n roll outlaw
I got a license
I got a license to kill
I got a license to kill

You can't break this heart of gold
I made it

License to kill
I've got a license to kill
License to kill
You better lock up your daughters
License to kill
Well I'm back in town
License to kill
I've got a license to kill
