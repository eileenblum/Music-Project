Beyond the galaxy
There lies the gods
Beyond the limits of space
Out where an ageless power
With a light of a reigning grace

Chained in the shadows that my screen
Bleeding at night never to degrade
Get ready for the fight
They're breaking free tonight
It's time to make a stand

Against the empire
You know you're in full force
Against the empire
Against the empire

Beneath the shadows of two moons
In an alien night
A world of iron stretching my tubes
Rigid against its life

Breaking the colors of an ancient law
Rebel, the world must fall
Your right by waking realize
It's time to take a stand

Against the empire
You know you're in full force
Against the empire
Against the empire

Chained in the shadows of a time screen
Bleeding at night never to degrade
We have to stand and fight
The creed is our tonight
Against the empire
