You got something on your mind
Something's strong I ain't blind
You're contemplating an act
Your heart is hardened and that's all black

I can't see what's inside your head
But I can read behind your eyes
I can see you want someone bad
Coming from you it's no surprise

Murder, murder, murder in your heart
Murder, murder, murder will play its part
Murder, murder, murder
Poison in the chalice
Murder, murder, murder with malice

Your eyes like ice
Chilling the soul
Your lips curl in hate
Blood runs cold

Just put that thing away
Let's talk a while
You need a good man baby
Who could make you smile

I can't see what's inside your head
But I can read behind your eyes
I can see you want someone bad
Coming from you it's no surprise

Murder, murder, murder in your heart
Murder, murder, murder will play its part
Murder, murder, murder
Poison in the chalice
Murder, murder, murder with malice

I can't see what's inside your head
But I can read behind your eyes
I can see you want someone bad
Coming from you it's no surprise

Murder, murder, murder in your heart
Murder, murder, murder will play its part
Murder, murder, murder
Poison in the chalice
Murder, murder, murder with malice
