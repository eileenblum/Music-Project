Ride as I may
Do what I will
Do sail across the stormy ocean
How do I feel
All the way uphill
I got to get to the top
Of the highest mountain

Angel of a thousand screams
Breathing down my neck
Asking all you want is dreams
Breathing down my neck
Breathing down my neck

Everywhere I turn
I get the run around
Leave or stealing my American dream
No one cares anymore
When you are down
They're too busy
With salvation

Angel of a thousand screams
Breathing down my neck
Asking all you want is dreams
Breathing down my neck
Breathing down my neck

They say that money doesn't mean a thing

I hear
I pray I could be men at war
Men at war

Angel of a thousand screams
Breathing down my neck
Asking all you want is dreams
Breathing down my neck
Breathing down my neck

They say that money doesn't mean a thing
Breathing down my neck
Angel of a thousand screams
Breathing down my neck
