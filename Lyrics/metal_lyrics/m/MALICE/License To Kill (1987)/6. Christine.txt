Blue skies tire and wheels
You know just
Magic is how she feels
And if she wants to sail

Living in the
Put her in gear and off we go
Till we find the sea
You feel in love
Once you shift her gears
She knows it's time
To lock up with the gas

I'll never leave her
Oh Christine
Christine

Can you feel the
Racing into the night
Headlights glaring madly
Engine whirring
She's got new
And now you realize
There's just not another sin

I'll never leave her
Oh Christine
Christine
Oh metal passion
Christine
Christine

The doors are locked
Staying in here
You're right nothing stops

If she can't possess you
Then no one will
She's going to run you through
Like heaven kills

Burn her
Like a phoenix she'll light another life

I'll never leave her
Oh Christine
Christine
Oh metal passion
Christine
Like a chill inspired
Christine
