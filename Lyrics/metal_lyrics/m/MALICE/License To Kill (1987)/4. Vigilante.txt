Soldier of fortune
I travel worldwide
If you got a problem
The law won't decide
Here's my number
Give me a call
Ready in a moment's notice
No time to stall
Desert or jungle
I'll go where I have to go

I'm a vigilante
A man hunting machine
I'm a vigilante
Pain mercy to be

Investigation someone is missing
Found place suspected
Happy up front expenses paid
Me and my automatic
We're gonna make this break
China or Peru I'll do what I have to do
Yes I will

I'm a vigilante
A man hunting machine
I'm a vigilante
Pain mercy to be

Under block my view
Drama leaps overhead
At last I luck my way through
The ladies want me dead

I'm a vigilante
A man hunting machine
I'm a vigilante
Pain mercy to be

Vigilante
Vigilante

Under block my view
Drama leaps overhead
At last I luck my way through
See the deeper hand
