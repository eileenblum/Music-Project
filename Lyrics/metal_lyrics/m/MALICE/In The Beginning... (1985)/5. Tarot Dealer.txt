Ace of pentacles
Laid down in reverse
Aside the devil
Speaks a frightful curse

Ace of swords
Foretelling great power
Ace of wands
Needed in a dark hour

[CHORUS:]
Tarot dealer!
Tarot dealer!
Tarot dealer!
Deal me a fortunate hand

The face of death
Brings much needed changes
Along with judgement
As your life rearranges

Riding the chariot
Against winds of defeat
Once I've won my empress
My life will be complete

[CHORUS]

Look out here she comes

[Verse 1]
[Verse 4]
[Chorus]
