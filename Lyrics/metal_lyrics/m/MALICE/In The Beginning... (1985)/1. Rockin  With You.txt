Seems like such a long time ago
When we started in rock'n'roll
We were young, headstrong
And we knew just where we belonged
We put our minds and hands to rhythm
To create a new rockin' anthem
Throughout the years we've held our ground
'Cause we've always known that rock would be around

[CHORUS:]
We'll be rockin'
There's no stopping us
We'll be rockin'
Let's bring the house down
And we'll be rockin' with you

A long day, now the night is under way
There's a charge in the air
White linesÂ neon signs
On the way to the show
Some will danceÂ others romance
There'll be a fight or two
All in good time, everyone will find
Their own thing to do

[CHORUS]

Armed with the power
To shape this final hour
We must stand strong
And keep on singing our song
Raise your voice in chorus
As our enemies run before us
We continue to prove
That rock'n'roll rules
And we'll be rockin' with you
