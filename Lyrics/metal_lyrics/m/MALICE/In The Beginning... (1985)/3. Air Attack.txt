Riding in on the wings of darkness
Smashing sounds erupt the night
No alarmÂ no time to wonder
This is itÂ the final flight
Soaring high above the lighted city
Picking pointsÂ the target's clear
Sweeping down, penetrating buildings
Sounds excite perceptive ear

[Chorus:]
Air attack!
Air attack!

Power surgeÂ overload all systems
Using waves to project our sound
DeafeningÂ the roar will cut thru to
Spin your head as it shakes the ground
Black on black tho' naked eye can't see us
Awesome force takes you from behind
Strain your brain to stare in empty void, see
Metal scrapeÂ supersonic grinder

Sonic boom! Leave the levelled city!
Double thrust pushing up and on!
Walls still ringÂ hot vapour streaks the sky!
As you join our evergrowing forces
Time is now to stand your ground
For we know rock'n'roll will never die!

[Chorus]
