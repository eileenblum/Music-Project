Running thru the waste
Of a cold deserted land
Hiding out in fear
From the touch of death's hand
Living in the shadows
Of those who gave them birth
And their lives are shells
Roaming a vast metallic earth

They know there is no future
Only survival from day to day
In their minds there is no heart
No dreams of a better way
Mood is a luxury
That has to be taken by force
And when it comes to loving
Hate is the only cause

[CHORUS:]
They are the unwanted
They are the unwanted

Their ancestors dwell in citadels
Built in the distant past
Waging war against their children
And the know they're losing fast
The curse of the final war
Created a new breed
And the old ones let them suffer
Now it's their turn to bleed

[CHORUS]
[CHORUS]
[VERSE 1]
