Blue mist - rising all about me
One kiss - from the lips of her majesty
My God - is there no beginning
Oh no - I can hear the bells of doom ringing

[CHORUS:]
Godz of thunder
Coming back to rule the world
Godz of fire
Godz of thunder

Pentagram - drawn out in blood
I am damned - by the greed of a thirsty God
Help me - is there no end to eternity
Set me free - from the chains of Hell's infernity

[CHORUS]

Too late - to turn back the clock
My fate - awaiting that final knock
It's done - they're dragging me to their hellish lair
I can't run - they have their watchers everywhere

[CHORUS]
