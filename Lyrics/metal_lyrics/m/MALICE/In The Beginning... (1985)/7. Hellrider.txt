Shifting shadows - in a demon race
Edge of chaos - fang versus mace
Shimmering minds eye - visionary place
Your steed rides the sky - 'cross God's face

[BRIDGE 1:]
You are riding - to the final flight
Fate deciding - your destiny tonight
Death abiding - your enemies' plight

[CHORUS:]
Hellrider!
Hellrider!
Hellrider!
Hellrider!

Churning nightmare - straight ahead
Evil-filled air - stalking dread
Legions of hell - at times' end
Armageddon - will they lose, will they win

[BRIDGE 2:]
They are riding - to the final fight
Fate deciding - their destiny tonight
Death abiding - our enemies' plight

[CHORUS]
