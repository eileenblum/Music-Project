Tucked away in my mind
But where nobody knows
The answer - I can't find
And like the windÂ it comes and goes
Like the wind... it comes and goes
And you know that there is

[CHORUS 1:]
No haven for the raven
No peace of mind
No haven for the raven
Leaving it all behind

So here I sitÂ along
Gazing into the horizon
My soul, like a rolling stone
Moves on and on in a new direction
Moves on and on
And you know that there is

[CHORUS 1]

[CHORUS 2:]
No haven for the raven
Forever on wing
No haven for the raven
Where is death's sting

[BRIDGE:]
Creature of doomÂ from the oracle's loom
Haunting and taunting our daysÂ the raven!
Prophet of deathÂ to your last breath
Choosing and losing our waysÂ the raven!

[CHORUS 1]
[CHORUS 2]

No haven for theÂ raven
