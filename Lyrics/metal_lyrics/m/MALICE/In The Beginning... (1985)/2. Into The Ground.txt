Streakin' round the world
Twice the speed of sound
You ain't gonna stop us
You can't slow us down

Fusing metal minds
Like boiling grains of sand
Nothing you do fools us
We know our slight of hand

[CHORUS:]
Never gonna stop
Never gonna lay it down
Never gonna rest
I'm gonna run it
Run it into the ground

I'm gonna waste your mind
I'm gonna enslave your soul
I'm gonna reverse your life
With this rock'n'roll

[Chorus]
[Verse 1]
[Verse 3]
[Chorus]
