We span the heavens
To build upon new dreams
We are the masters
Of stellar destiny
Our ships of steel
Soaring on solar beams
Conquest of new worlds
Universal ascendancy

[BRIDGE:]
Riding out to the edge of the galaxy
Riding out on the winds of eternity

Mind over matter
Creates new dimensions
Nebulous empires
Heralds new directions

[CHORUS:]
We areâ¦ stellar masters!
We areâ¦ stellar masters!

Spiraling pulsar
Leading us through the void
Galactical gender
Cosmic ancestry
Our mental wave-lengths
Bridging the vast unknown
Time dilation
Hurtling infinity
