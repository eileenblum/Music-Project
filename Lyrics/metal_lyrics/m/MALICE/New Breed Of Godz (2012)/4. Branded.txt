There is a light in the distance
I've been drifting alone
I'm your darkest creation
Vengeance filled to the bone
Betrayed by a false domination
Led astray to die in humiliation

Fed only lies from your society

I've been stranded
For the last time
Branded
Do or die

See my blood red eyes
Coming at you full force
Vast mass mutilation
Left behind on my course
Soaring on the wings of fire
My destiny awaits my hearts desire

Fed only lies from your society
From these chains of hell I will break free
In this world of deceivers
Captured by your disgust
Force to be a believer
But I've opened my eyes
Retribution begins
Now I bring your demise
