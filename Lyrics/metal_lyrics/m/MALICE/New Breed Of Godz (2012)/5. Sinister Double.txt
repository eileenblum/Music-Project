Deep down inside without warning
The other side with love blind
No way to tell without warning
It's not a spell, it's just a lie

You give me cause
You're just like the rest
It's my admonition

Sinister double
Heading for trouble
No game to play or to understand
You're sinister double
Running in trouble
Play with your soul if you don't watch out
You're a sinister double

In the mirror is a reflection
Is it just your fantasy
No way to tell if it's deception
Prime evil will give a sign
You came to trust the circumstance
Your mind and soul refuse to dance

Sinister double
Heading for trouble
No game to play or to understand
You're sinister double
Running in trouble
Play with your soul if you don't watch out
You're a sinister double

You came to trust the circumstance
Your mind and soul refuse to dance
It's my admonition

Sinister double
Heading for trouble
No game to play or to understand
You're sinister double
Running in trouble
Play with your soul if you don't watch out
You're a sinister double
