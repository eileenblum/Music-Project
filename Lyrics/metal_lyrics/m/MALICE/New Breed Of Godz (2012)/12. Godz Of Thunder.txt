Blue mist â rising all about me
One kiss â from the lips of her majesty
My God â is there no beginning
Oh no â I can hear the bells of doom ringing

[CHORUS:]
Godz of thunder
Coming back to rule the world
Godz of fire
Godz of thunder

Pentagram - drawn out in blood
I am damned â by the greed of a thirsty God
Help me â is there no end to eternity
Set me free â from the chains of Hellâs infernity

[CHORUS]

Too late â to turn back the clock
My fate â awaiting that final knock
Itâs done - theyâre dragging me to their hellish lair
I canât run â they have their watchers everywhere

[CHORUS]
