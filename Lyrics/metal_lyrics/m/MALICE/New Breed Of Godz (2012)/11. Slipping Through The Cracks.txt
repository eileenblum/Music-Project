Scratching and clawing
Can't draw a breath
The reaper's closing in
Annihilation of all humankind
The darkness settles in
So few survivors
Run for their lives

We are the lies of deception
Souls left in black
We are the waste of destruction
Sheer heart attack
Slip slippin' thru the cracks
No turning back
We are the slaves of corruption
Slippin' thru the cracks

The endless night
Brings bitter cold
The world is dying off
Suffering, battling
Cataclysmic change
We live to fight again
Slaves to an evil truth

We are the lies of deception
Souls left in black
We are the waste of destruction
Sheer heart attack
Slip slippin' thru the cracks
No turning back
We are the slaves of corruption
Slippin' thru the cracks

We are the last
Slippin' thru the cracks
