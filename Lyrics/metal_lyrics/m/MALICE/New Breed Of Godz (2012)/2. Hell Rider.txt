Shifting shadows â in a demon race
Edge of chaos â fang versus mace
Shimmering minds eye â visionary place
Your steed rides the sky â âcross Godâs face

[BRIDGE 1:]
You are riding â to the final flight
Fate deciding â your destiny tonight
Death abiding â your enemiesâ plight

[CHORUS:]
Hellrider!
Hellrider!
Hellrider!
Hellrider!

Churning nightmare â straight ahead
Evil-filled air â stalking dread
Legions of hell â at timesâ end
Armageddon â will they lose, will they win

[BRIDGE 2:]
They are riding â to the final fight
Fate deciding â their destiny tonight
Death abiding â our enemiesâ plight

[CHORUS]
