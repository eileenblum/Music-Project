I am evil in the night
Now all alone I stand and fight
Sharp teeth bleeding
Reflect all my bones
No game
I got the magic stone

Stones of power
Save this flag
Forget me desire
The real life's dead

Circle of fire
Sing melody
Circle of fire
Set me free

Recurring dreaming
Nightmare reality
It's stayed every night
And I am back at sea
Draft on all sides
In yesterday's light

Power I need
Oh one more time
Time of power
Burning
Forget me desire
The real life's dead

Circle of fire
Sing melody
Circle of fire
Set me free

Recurring dreaming
Nightmare reality
It's stayed every night
And I am back at sea
I am evil in the night
Now all alone I stand and fight

Stones of power
Save this flag
Forget me desire
The real life's dead

Circle of fire
Sing melody
Circle of fire
Set me free

Circle of fire
Circle of fire
