Stardust from the ancients
Malice forms a new life
Lightning strikes &amp; the world trembles
Shimmering lights from the skies
Giants rise from the ashes
Made of iron and metal
Gamma rays emerge from their eyes

Searing and scorching
The face of the Earth
Plantation for the new birth
Formation of power
Bolts of fire
Decibels unreal from their cries

Terrorizing screams from depths of Hell
Tornadoes of flames reach the skies
Casting shadows a new breed of godz

The time keepers from galaxies
Many light years away
With watchful eye observed our paths
Time has come for judgement day
Countdown to mean's extinction
Annihilation will begin
Infernal demise vaporizing away

Searing and scolding
The face of the Earth
Plantation for the new birth
Formation of power
Bolts of fire
Decibels unreal from their cries

Terrorizing screams from depths of Hell
Tornadoes of flames reach the skies
Breaking the spell a new breed of godz

New breed of godz in the atmosphere
New breed of godz are drawing near
New breed of godz have now appeared
New breed of godz chaos and fear
