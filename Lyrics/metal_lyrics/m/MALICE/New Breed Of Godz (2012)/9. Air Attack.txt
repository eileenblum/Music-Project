Riding in on the wings of darkness
Smashing sounds erupt the night
No alarmâ¦ no time to wonder
This is itâ¦ the final flight
Soaring high above the lighted city
Picking pointsâ¦ the targetâs clear
Sweeping down, penetrating buildings
Sounds excite perceptive ear

[Chorus:]
Air attack!
Air attack!

Power surgeâ¦ overload all systems
Using waves to project our sound
Deafeningâ¦ the roar will cut thru to
Spin your head as it shakes the ground
Black on black thoâ naked eye canât see us
Awesome force takes you from behind
Strain your brain to stare in empty void, see
Metal scrapeâ¦ supersonic grinder

Sonic boom! Leave the levelled city!
Double thrust pushing up and on!
Walls still ringâ¦ hot vapour streaks the sky!
As you join our evergrowing forces
Time is now to stand your ground
For we know rockânâroll will never die!

[Chorus]
