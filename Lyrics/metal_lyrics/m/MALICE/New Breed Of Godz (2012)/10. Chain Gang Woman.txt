She took me for a ride
She took me for a stroll
She left me on the
I gave her the final score

Chain gang
Chain gang woman
Chain gang
Chain gang woman
She'll never understand the life
Chain gang
Chain gang woman
Chain gang
Chain gang woman

She thought I was her toy
She thought I was her boy
She thought she was so right
When she thought the guy was a tool

Chain gang
Chain gang woman
Chain gang
Chain gang woman
She'll never understand the life
Chain gang
Chain gang woman
Chain gang
Chain gang woman

Always on the run
Chain gang
Got you under my gun
