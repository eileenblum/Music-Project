[Jeurian:]
Reflecting on my life, surrounded by the stones
I'm waiting for my time, the cold runs through my bones
There's nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Nowhere to go

[Both:]
Embrace a thinner line of hope

[Lavinia:]
Another day has died, can someone ease my pain?
I'm counting tears I've cried, I'm crying all in vain
There's no one to hold
No one to touch
Nothing to share

[Both:]
I walk a thin line of despair

[Jury:]
Take his life, bring him down, hang him on

[Jeurian:]
My fate will be done

[Jury:]
A branch of a tree near to the sea, what if we
Don't believe words to speak, no one cares

[Jeurian:]
My pride won't be gone

[Jury:]
A life to be torn, no one to warn, what if we...

[Commodore:]
The sands of time are running so low
Can't justify your deeds
I can leave you in a state of suspense
Or should I leave you to their greed?

[Lavinia:]
A new life has begun, thank God he gave so much
In emptiness he's born, yearning for your touch
So give me a sign
Show me the line
Keep it in mind

[Both:]
To be a father for my son

[Jeurian:]
The guards will march me out the courtyard comes in sight
My soul is crying loud with angels on my right
They're making me strong
Prove to be wrong
Fate will be done
I'll be a father for my son

[Lavinia:]
You'll be a father for my son

[Jury:]
Take his life, bring him down, hang him on

[Jeurian:]
My fate will be done

[Jury:]
A branch of a tree near to the sea, what if we
Don't believe words to speak, no one cares

[Jeurian:]
My pride won't be gone

[Jury:]
A life to be torn, no one to warn, what if we...

[Commodore:]
The sands of time are running so low
Can't justify your deeds
I can leave you in a state of suspense
Or should I leave you to their greed?
