[Conrad:]
I shall lay my ear to the wall of this old room that was
Always disconnected by them, the Lords of Seventeen
Day by day I come to this place, a little smile on my face
As long as nobody knows my hidden room here belongs
To the young lady, she plays on her piano and stays

In all her ignorance, leading me in my dual mind
Then, I'm loosing contact with ground, when listening to the sound
That leads me into a world of never being a lonesome
Man that I ever was will disappear by the first
Notes she's playing, while leading me in my dual mind

I, I will ever return
To desires that burn
In the rooms of my heart feels empty
I won't give up and I try
Long before that I die
We'll unite in my dark divided mind

[Conrad &amp; Jeurian:]
Hear the music play the game
Overture without a name
It's leading me in my dual mind
Reaching all the world in trance
Following the epic dance
She leads me to...

[Conrad:]
Every time you reach out your hand to touch the key with a blend
Of pianissimo and a kind of passion, I wait until I enter my quest
With all the moments that passed
To see my lady again in a beautiful land
So please,
Don't leave me here all alone, cause every time you are gone
I feel afraid to be left and ask myself if you won't or
Will return to my greed and let me hear what I need
To end my journey inside my divided mind

Tell me will I ever return
To all desires that burn
Show me will I ever return
My desire burns

[Conrad &amp; Jeurian:]
Hear the music play the game
Overture without a name
It's leading me in my dual mind
Reaching all the world in trance
Following the epic dance
She leads me to...
Leading in my dual... mind
