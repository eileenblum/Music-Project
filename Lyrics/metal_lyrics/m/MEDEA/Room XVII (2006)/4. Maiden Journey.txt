[Cadets:]
One man airs the cabins, one man scrubs the deck and
One relieves the watch and be aware for mutiny in furtive
One meal after praying, one of groats and raisins
One meal beans with butter, there may be some leftovers for a last meal
One day storm is coming, one day sun will rise
The heat is unbearable, one day I will realise forever

[Commodore:]
One day I will sail
Sail with me over sea to far horizons
Try to defy storm and heat, don't leave in silence now

[Jeurian:]
Try to find
My hammock is hanging in darkness here
Before the mast
The hold of the ship will be ours
Sleep, can't sleep near beside of my fellows

[Cadets:]
Oppressing me

[Jeurian:]
Breathe, I'm leaving my breath here inside
It's killing me softly now
Can you feel?
My body is aching this coldest night
Can't you stand?
The tropical heat during day
Long, I'm longing for water so cold and fresh

[Cadets:]
Please drink with me

[Jeurian:]
Food, a poison that hurts in the flesh
It's killing me softly now

[Cadets:]
One man airs the cabins, one man scrubs the deck and
One relieves the watch and be aware for mutiny in furtive
One meal after praying, one of groats and raisins
One meal beans with butter, there may be some leftovers for a last meal
One day storm is coming, one day sun will rise
The heat is unbearable, one day I will realise forever

[Commodore:]
One day I will sail
Sail with me over sea to far horizons
Try to defy storm and heat, don't leave in silence

[All:]
Sail with me over sea to far horizons
Turn, turn the waves avoid the graves, don't leave in silence
Sail with me over sea to far horizons
Try to defy without lies, don't leave in silence and
Trade to the East with me
