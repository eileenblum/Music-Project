[Commodore:]
Parts of the world, we will combine

[Saleswomen:]
Show me textile, gold, silver and wine
For the range of the silk
For the barter in spice
Show me textile, gold, silver and wine
I would take it for once
Would you take it for twice

[Commodore:]
Dance, come dance with me
We try to find commodity for more
We know we risk a war
But it won't matter anymore and that's sure
Horizons fade, there where we trade

[Saleswomen:]
Show me textile, gold, silver and wine
For the range of the silk
For the barter in spice
Show me textile, gold, silver and wine
I would take it for once
Would you take it for twice

[Commodore:]
Dance, come dance with me
We try to find commodity for more
We know we risk a war
But it won't matter anymore, that's so sure

[Eyewitness &amp; cadets:]
As the wind will blow let the current flow
Gold is in your eyes, would you be surprised
Would you be so kind to leave all behind
Would you risk a war, would you go so far
To the victory, to monopoly
In commodity with variety

[Commodore &amp; cadets:]
As the wind will blow let the current flow
Gold is in my eyes, I won't be surprised
I will be so kind to leave all behind
I 'll risk a war, I will go so far
To the victory, to monopoly
In commodity with variety
Let me take the East, let me take the South
Let me take the West, let me take the world

[Saleswomen:]
Show me textile, gold, silver and wine
For the range of the silk
For the barter in spice
Show me textile, gold, silver and wine
I would take it for once
Would you take it for twice
