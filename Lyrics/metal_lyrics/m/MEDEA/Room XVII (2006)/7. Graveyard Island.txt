[Commodore:]
My skipper saw a shimmering of light

[Jeronimus:]
How can he see in deepest of dark nights

[Commodore:]
He thought to see reflections of the moon

[Jeronimus:]
You fool, you're wrong, you'll pay for it as soon...
Pain... as the fear runs through your veins

[Both:]
We ran aground, is this the tragic end?
The maiden journey couldn't reach the land

[Jeronimus:]
The mutiny, now waiting for the dead
The island's slowly turning into red
Pain... as the fear runs through your veins

[Jeurian:]
It won't justify your fight

[Jeronimus:]
Fight... without reason without pride

[Jeurian:]
For the fear I try to hide

[Mutineers:]
Bad reign of terror leads through the head
Know where I stand in command of the treason
Give me the smallest excuse for the dead
Feed me with orders to kill without reason

Fighting your own war to stay alive
And save your breath with violence

Don't swim against
Fit in the plan
Don't swim against the current, the current

[Jeurian:]
Can you tell me what to do
My choice is not a choice

[Jeronimus:]
So leave your conscience
Take my orders in

[Both:]
Preservation of your own life

[Jeronimus:]
Pain... as the fear runs through your veins

[Jeurian:]
It won't justify your fight

[Jeronimus:]
Fight... without reason without pride

[Jeurian:]
For the fear I try to hide
