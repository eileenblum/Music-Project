[Eyewitness:]
Welcome and hear
Let me tell you about this old theatre
Come, walk with me
Then I'll guide you to a forgotten chamber
Keys are lost and all the doors stay closed
The fear rules for the danger of falling in

Inside this room
Decorated with Rembrandt's portraits
Lies, questions rise
Find the answers hidden in this chaos
Left behind by 'Lords of Seventeen'
And will they ever meet again at night?

Eyes, cold as ice
Proudly staring through the dust of twilight
See what I see
Shiver by a silhouette that came in
Sight, a man in fear, he's bowing down
With hands brushing his hair colouring red

Blood on his hands
Makes him guilty for a crime committed
Sweat on his head
Falling down like rain along his body
Can you tell me what this man endured
A devastated mind confusion

Forgotten chamber is hiding a story
Of a man and his lifeline, it lies here inside
The past and present united in one's memory
The story unfolds now in this room seventeen

[Soul:]
A minds confusion, a disillusion
Of a man and his lifeline, it lies here inside
Won't find the answer created by the music
The key of a memory will be lost now

[Eyewitness:]
Forgotten chamber is hiding a story
Of a man and his lifeline, it lies here inside
The past and present united in one's memory
The story unfolds now in this room

[Soul:]
Forgotten chamber is hiding a story
A man and his lifeline, it lies here inside
The past and present, forever united
The story unfolds now in this room seventeen
