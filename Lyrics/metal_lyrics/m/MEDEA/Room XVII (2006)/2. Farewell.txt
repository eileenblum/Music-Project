[Texel, October 28th, 1628]

[Jeurian:]
Close your eyes
And keep the memory
The reason why
You know we'll get better in time
It's just a temporary need
My choice is not a choice

[Lavinia:]
Close your eyes
And keep the memory
The reason why
You know I'll be waiting for you
Until the end of time will come
Please hold me in your arms

[Jeurian:]
Now here I stand
The coast leaving behind
"How will it end?"
It keeps on running through my mind
To take a forward step
I never realised

[Both:]
How deep the flood was around me
Should I say farewell?
