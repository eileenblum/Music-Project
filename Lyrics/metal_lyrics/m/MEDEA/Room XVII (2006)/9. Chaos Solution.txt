[Part I: The Closure]

[Eyewitness:]
Now the time has come for the end of a long
Secret story that lies here inside
A forgotten tale must give way to a new
Change in history lines of this room
The teacher prepares for the closure
The student will never return

[Part II: The Missing]

[Conrad:]
Back in my room, emptiness in my mind
Fears of silence scream in my ears
Waiting for you now, waiting for somehow
Don't leave me here without your company
Don't close doors to my dual mind
I'm missing you now, missing you somehow

[Eyewitness &amp; Soul:]
When the fear is running through your veins
Confusion comes to play her game
Always someone to pay for all
So let the teacher fall
The chaos in mind couldn't set you free
The fury makes blind for your dignity

[Conrad:]
No need for words, what do they mean to me
In words I won't find my self here
Won't feed me reasons, don't change my seasons
Restless hands of time, ticking away
Fate draws near to embrace my deed
Pain 's growing stronger, my will stands no longer

[Eyewitness &amp; Soul:]
When the fear is running through your veins
Confusion comes to play her game
Always someone to pay for all
So let the teacher fall
The chaos in mind couldn't set you free
The fury makes blind for your dignity

[Part III: Chaos]

[Instrumental]

[Part IV: Solution]

[Conrad:]
Why, see what I've done
See this man drowned in my own blood
Try to understand it
'Cause how should I know that before
I just saw his "Endless Knot"
Cry for this man, try to understand
Why in my own blood, with my Endless Knot
