From these depths my roots have grown
To the pantheon of gods

'Cause my blood is the blood of an ancient
Wrath, the blood of the true revolution
The true ancient blood

See these unholy red streams descending
The majestic mountains of doom
To flood impious, those who have drunk the false wine

The red throne of the moon will be the
Color of our empire, 
The empire of truth
The empire of blood

Hail!
Hail to this wine!
The red wine of truth

During centuries, my blood has frozen into
The bleeding moon awaiting the red omen

My curse will be the curse of the red storm of
Hate, into the depths, God will fall

'Cause my blood is the blood of an ancient
Wrath, the blood of the true revolution;
The true ancient blood
