In the dusk he talked to the mystic face of the moon
Promising that he will cover it with blood

[He said]
"See for what I fought so long,
O' coldest moon, now to you I belong"

He slept seven nights in the snow and the deepest breeze
Until his flesh begins to freeze

He couldn't hold his breath
Caught by the nocturnal death

See this unholy throne of blood
This is the last omen of the moon

Unclenching his cold fists
Entering in the blackest mist

Worshiping the funeral winter
Wiping his last tears

"Je garde dans mon Coeur la douceur glaciale du nÃ©ant,
Ã triste lune, te souviens tu comme je pleurais en te regardant?"
