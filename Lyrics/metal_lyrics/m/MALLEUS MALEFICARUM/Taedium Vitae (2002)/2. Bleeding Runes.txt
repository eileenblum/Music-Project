Symbols of chaos are blazing again
Showing a new way to follow
Marks of blood engraved on stone
Remember their unholy past

Through the dark centuries
Holding their wrath
Their black witchery
Will spread eternally

[Runes have spoken]
"By blood we brave the gods
To the true satanic wisdom
By blood curse the gods
To the true eternal wisdom"

Legends and tales about those marks have made their power
Only knights full of true hate knew heir ancient language

With the unholy craft
Created by the sinners of God
The alliance dreams
About glory and revenge

Proudly dead by the sword
Of the holy saints
Sadness, melancholy and malice
Have made the rebirth of the bleeding runes

[Runes have spoken]
"O' mother nature!
Give us the power to strike again
And make total death come true"

Through the dark centuries
Holding their wrath
Their black witchery
Will spread eternally
