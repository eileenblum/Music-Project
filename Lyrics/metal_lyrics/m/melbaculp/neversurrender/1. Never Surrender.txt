[Written by Jack McConnell]

Binded in life
But I won't give up the fight urgency strong
But I, I'll never belong
Tempted with greed
False prosperity
Slave to their system
I
Will be freed
We will fight against all the empires
We will win or else we
Will die
We will fight to carry our creed to do whatever,
It is we please
Drowning in their wasteland
Can't call this home
I am so different
And
Different, is what they'll be shown
Never will I
Abandon these dreams
Never will I
Work the dead end beat
We will fight against all the empires

We will win or else we will die
We will fight to carry our creed to do
Whatever, it is we please
We will fight against all the empires
We will
Win or else we will die
We will fight to carry our creed
To do whatever,
It is we please
Down on their knees I chose to be free, yeah
