You're breaking my defence,
So dear but so intense
I strive to hold you back,
To prevent your sharp attack
And with every breath you graze my heart
It strikes me back to the start
So I bury my face and begin to see
I can't give you more of me
You know, I did not show, I did not show it cuts in deep
I must rely on absent love, to get through and to feel free
So this may be the price
A soul as cold as ice
Like a spiral move inside,
Is there any more to hide?
And with every breath you graze my heart
It strikes me back to the start
So I bury my face and begin to see
I can't give you more of me
You know, I did not show, I did not show it cuts in deep
I must rely on absent love, to get through and to feel free
With those tears you ask me what I feel
Something honest, something real
But it came to be too close for me
As the innermost is what I fear
You know, I did not show, I did not show it cuts in deep
I must rely on absent love, to get through and to feel free
