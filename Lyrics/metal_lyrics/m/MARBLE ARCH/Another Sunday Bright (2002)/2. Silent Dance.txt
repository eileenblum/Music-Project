You've been here, around for aeons
You try to feel the pulse but you're not breathing
Streetlights shine through the blinds
Your try to make a move, it's not succeeding
Sing and dance this silence down
We're all the same in this frozen town
Lonely hearts, number one on the charts
dressed up tight, just for tonight
Demons cry ignoring the tide
The screen gives you the course of where to head
Strive to feel, to be so alive
In a town on a distant ground we're all so isolated
Sing and dance this silence down
We're all the same in this frozen town
Lonely hearts, number one on the charts
dressed up tight, are you feeling alright?
Sing and dance this silence down
We're all the same in this frozen town
Lonely hearts, number one on the charts
dressed up tight, 'cause the night is the night
