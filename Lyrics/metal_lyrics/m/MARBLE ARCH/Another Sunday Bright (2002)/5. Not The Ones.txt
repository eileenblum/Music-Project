It's his way to tell himself it's alright
It's her day to tell herself it's not right
All the moments burn and the faces turn
He can't bring it all back
Like the more it grows in the time it holds
She's painted it with black
Say goodbye to our love
As it should be done on a night like this
Never been as lost as this before
Since your brightest flame burned out, I'm not the one...
In tonight, there's no breathing by his side
And tonight she will close her eyes and pretend she's alright
In his crowded world all the voices blur
He tries to deny
See those weary eyes, her downcast eyes
That she tries to disguise
Say goodbye to our love
As it should be done on a night like this
Never been as lost as this before
Since my brightest flame burned out, you're not the one...
Breaking down in need for sleep
In position for the last escape
I can hear the darkness breathe and I see the time goes by
As I'm heading for my next attack
Say goodbye to our love
As it should be done on a night like this
Never been as lost as this before
Since our brightest flame burned out, we're not the ones...
