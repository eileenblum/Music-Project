Please bring it no further I will lose the control
My burning inside is so real
...and so again, the chill of ice down my spine
...and so again, the taste of blood on my tongue
And I see what you make me see
And I feel what you make me feel
Please don't hurt me, I'm not feeling to well
Don't be around me, get off me, don't want you inside me
I wish to delete you, pull the trigger and erase you
the same reaction every time you tell me this is all for real
And I see what you make me see
And I feel what you make me feel
Your conclusion a strange solution
To make sure I'm not afraid
Your conclusion my own solution
To make sure this is not for real
And I see what you make me see
And I feel what you make me feel
