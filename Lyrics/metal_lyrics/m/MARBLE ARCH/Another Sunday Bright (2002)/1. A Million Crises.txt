So I try to reach for the window sight, another Sunday bright
But the fever makes me weak for light, I think I'll stay in bed 'til
night

I can't tell by words but it's time to search and replace
In despair and out of command I'm close to collapse
As my needs are breaking down my defence, corroding to erase
My intense and fervent thirst improves my will to fight
Like a million crises banging inside, and forcing me to attend
It's the common way of the symptoms that I provide
I can't tell by words but it's time to search and replace
In despair and out of command I'm close to collapse
Neither daystar nor the moonlight appears to aspire
And I swallow all these lies, they'll become my disguise
