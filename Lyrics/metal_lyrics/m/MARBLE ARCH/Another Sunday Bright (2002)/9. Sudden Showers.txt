What if life turns to you
And breaks the unshaped fake illusions you call solutions
What if strength beckons me
To release the hidden danger of fallen angels
And I know I can hide
Behind a thousand faces in unlit places,
To leave is to cover
The unshown scenes of all broken dreams
And as far as you go
As you still recoil in shame like the pleasure soaks the pain
And the closer you look
The further I am 'cause to harm I know that you can
And I know I can hide
Behind a thousand faces in unlit places,
To leave is to cover
The unshown scenes of all broken dreams
And I hate when you take deviations
From all conversations
A last goodbye is a certain way
For me to go alone
