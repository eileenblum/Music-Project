Last has turn, it has burn down to minutes of wait
This; my last day, my life's flashing before my eyes,
when the panics kicks in
Empty tears, cold sweat, callousness, I watch the hours go by
Dark clouds gather upon the sky. Is there anyone left?
One last breath and my fear is leaving
Chemical fire is burning within
Leaving it all just don't care anymore if I fall
...From this time, this world, from this night
Seconds of hope in this dark rain, last gleam of light is now dying
Sun's turned black and I disappear deep in myself
One last breath and my fear is leaving
Chemical fire is burning within
Leaving it all just don't care anymore if I fall
...From this time, this world, from this night
One last breath and my fear is leaving
Chemical fire is burning within
Leaving it all just don't care anymore if I fall
I just need some peace of mind tonight
