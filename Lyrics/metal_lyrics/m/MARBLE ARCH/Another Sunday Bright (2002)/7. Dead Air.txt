Again I sense this devil near my ear
As every time my self-esteem's neglecting fear
He speaks a language of used and broken hearts
Of loneliness and of hate that seldom flows apart
But I still believe that time will tell someday
Why frozen dreams never melt by the bliss in your heart
But every single tiny touch pressures me
To kneel for an uncertainty so real
So I left again the scene where unity feels singular
and where demons scheme in my plagued haunted dreams
And I hide my eyes so that you can't see how I fight
These vivid plans which are blocking sight for me
But I still believe that time will tell someday
Why frozen dreams never melt by the bliss in your heart
But every single tiny touch pressures me
To kneel for an uncertainty so real
I know these moments soon will pass
Like caravans of doubt like the morning chill
When dignity feels like nothing and when every tear is freezing
Then you drag me out from the dark dead air that only I am breathing
But I still believe that time will tell someday
Why frozen dreams never melt by the bliss in your heart
But every single tiny touch pressures me
To kneel for an uncertainty so real
