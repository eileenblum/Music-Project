It's just that every time I disappear
I understand the mouth that said:
"Some things never change,
Some things always stay the same"
And as always I reappear
But nothing's true to me any more
A love with only attraction
Shared by souls that feels no affection
We are spreading a disease
Doing what we do
Kneeling before the truth
Be my fellow sinner
We used to be so clean
But now you are as dirty as I am
But it ends right here
And I tell you now
It won't hurt me to know who you are
Of all the things that I've done
There's nothing I couldn't do again
Unfaithful, unloved, unconscious
Some things always stay the same
We are spreading a disease
Doing what we do
Kneeling before the truth
Be my fellow sinner
We used to be so clean
But now you are as dirty as I am
But it ends right here
And I tell you now
It won't hurt me to know who you are
It's just that it's hard to believe
You could do this to me
But it's nothing that I can't understand
I don't blame you at all
It's equally my fault
It doesn't hurt me to know who you are
