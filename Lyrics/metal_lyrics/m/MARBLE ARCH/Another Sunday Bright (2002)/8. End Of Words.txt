End of words the truth you can't deny
Seems like foes always breathe a lie
So you slipped away, another day will stress your fall
You try to find comfort in that bitter role
You concede the time is tearing
In those tears you strive to disguise
Is this silence reappearing,
or are you slowly disappearing?
Always calm as the state you do achieve
Bitter and weak, same old frown you wear again
And so you lose it all, a total collapse, a complete relapse
A normal night, trade your days for one normal night
You concede the time is tearing
In those tears you strive to disguise
Is this silence reappearing,
or are you slowly disappearing?
