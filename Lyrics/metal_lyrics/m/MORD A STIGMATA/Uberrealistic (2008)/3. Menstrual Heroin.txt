[Lyrics: Doom L. Voxmord Stigmator V'nderer]

The Depth I am, the Book sealed by Five Sigils
Written by Air...
Labyrinthus et longinqui ignis species
Read...

Light of colourful neons
Put his gleam on sweet candy
tasting like a soil...
Menstrual Heroin spills on fragile ice
Hanging over smothered Fire...
Silver - black flesh which's diagnosing heart
Drowning the calm of afflation in itself
Besprented blood, flows out from rasberry gauze
Twinning the White Pigeon...
Swelled strings of veins
Are patiently pomping aversion and tasty hunger to Elegant Coat...
Dry branches of Trees, reflecting in tile of bluring Water, are 
Trickling Broken Glass...
Severing stony sculptures of tranquility
Polishing the Time in Cosmic Debris of Thousand Pearls...
Wet Corpse falls helter - skelter,
Hitting on arris sink with bony hand...
Inflexible, temptive shiny Pane, spawns misty Onirism
And afterwards, cuts on blunt arris, without cutting off...

Levitating torches of Milky Skin
Pulling over the shingle, the Innocence on the cord are
Reflecting the view of Mental Revolution in the Mirror...
Passage...in the longing
Longing...in Passage...
