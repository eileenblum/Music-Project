[Lyrics: Doom L. Voxmord Stigmator V'nderer]

Once, the Druggist You were, feeding the blood with Flowers
Actually, Your Infected Veins, feel again :
Hunger... 
Synthetic taste and flavour of Mellow " Clamours"...

Who are You, now...?
What Your Blood feeds with...?

Amicable Crimson envelope pensile Pyramids
Fascinating journey among Closed Eyes, of Calmly Observing Stars...

(...dispassionated in it's hallucinationess...)

...Mind Multidimensionality...
...Spirit and Matter...
...Wobbly Vectors of Universe Powers...

(...hallucinating in it's dispassionateness...)

In the Natural process of Primal Sterility, new power is born...Life and Languishment...
