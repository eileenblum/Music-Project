[Lyrics: Doom L. Voxmord Stigmator V'nderer]

In mental larva of raped humanity 
You decay, waiting fot the butterfly... 

Hear Daimonion or crucify your Soul... 

You count stars in your hand 
Sustain their light by the power of your will... 
By corridor of flashing lights to 
Sand and dust realm 
To become serpent... 

In a grey expressive Aura, the visions are stronger and more inorganic... 
The Cadaver homicide the living one... 
It's inside of you... 
It will kill you !!! 

Why are you void which resound in my interior ??? 
Why are you Love which I cannot dismiss ??? 
Why are you silence and scream ??? 
Why are you so near and so far (away) ??? 
Why are you... 
Why am I... 

One bliss must die if another wants to be born sometimes... 
Sometimes the best solutions are the most painfull... 
Tell me, what do you feel, what do you feel immolating yourself... ?? 
Immolating for Love... 

You experience psychic "blood" 
Not once, not twice... 
"Renesans" in new synthetic and hermetic environment... 
To build... 
From all and nothing... 

Patient road from Malkuth to Kether... 
...33...
