I ran through the trees and the woods in the dungeon
You ever think about when it's time to die?
Now it's my time, death is calling me...
This is the place... for eternity!

The fear of death is being replaced by the fear of living
A beautiful smile upon my lips and hate in my eyes
I remember the cold winter days in the woods
Now I am the winter... for eternity!

Rising from below, dying in the woods
The world drove me to insanity, suffocating me
(I'm) dying in the old woods

The word drove me to insanity!
No I am the winter... for eternity!
