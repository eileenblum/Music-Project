Trophies of victory
Depend not on the entrails of the flocks,
but on the strenght of those who fight
Was there then no altar of victory?

Show me the way of the Roma invicta!
Lions are still hungry
The sacred gates of Circus Maximus
Must be opened again!

Jesus Christ to the lions!
Blood is what I want to see!

Show me the way of the Roma invicta!
Lions are still hungry
The sacred gates of Circus Maximus
Must be opened again!

Tokens of the dead
The wondrous fame
Of the past world...
Traditions dark and cold
Whence evil creeds

Dea Roma in fuoco e fiamme
Mortem, lacrimas
Salva patria salva Roma!
Usque Adeone mori miserum est?
