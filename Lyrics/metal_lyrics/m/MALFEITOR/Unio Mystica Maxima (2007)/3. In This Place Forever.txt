Here there's no light
Here there is no knowledge
Sepulchral inverted chants
Are showing me the way

In the meanders of darkness
Hungry vultures from the grave
An eternal crepuscule
Screaming children they'll come for revenge

Ancients lived in this place
Their presence is still so weird and hard
The other half of me
Is chained in this sepolcrum by demons in
Blood

Deep magic begins here
It's a burning freeze
The black God passed through me
It's born!
Evil power continues to grow
Slaughter the good
And holy cast them to the fires of Hell

In this place forever
Where the deamons
Chained my sick soul
And all the pieces I left behind
