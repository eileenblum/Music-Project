[Mysticum Cover]

Beyond the shadows from beyond His throne
They're standing and smiling all alone
Demons to some, but angels to me
Come closer, come closer, come closer and see
They whisper, they whisper, they are singing to me
Come closer, come closer for eternity
Come closer, come closer for eternity

Black magic mushrooms
Black magic mushrooms
Black magic mushrooms
Black magic mushrooms

Carpet green - Clandestine
Rising bellow - Psilocybine
Godflesh, you are mine
Godflesh, make me divine

Black magic mushrooms
Black magic mushrooms
Black magic mushrooms
Black magic mushrooms

Carpet green - Clandestine
Rising bellow - Psilocybine
Godflesh, you are mine
Godflesh, now make me divine

Come closer, come closer, come closer and see
As the demons are singing with me
I'm raising my sinful raven wings
And away to the planet of pleasure and sins
Escorted by demons I'm coming in

Soon I am there to witness and see
The realm of Lucifer's mystery
And father Satan's eternity
Carpet green - Clandestine
Rising bellow - Psilocybine
Godflesh, poisoning my mind
Godflesh, it made me divine
