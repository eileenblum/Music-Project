Come to me Lord of Darkness
Hear my voice, feel my blood
Raise me from human scum
Yours will be my law
Your black light is inside me, come with fire
And burn the flesh of the earth
Release the way that blinds my mind
Free me of the undevine!

Rex Bestia Fera

Hear my voice Lord of sorrow
King of blasphemy
Our dark legions now are one
In victory we stand
I demand to spread the rage of fire
Against Jesus Christ and humanity
Release the way that blinds our mind
Free us of the undevine!

Rex Bestia Fera

Tu es dux, te es omnium malum, tu es princeps
Mali generis, Tu es Bestia Fera

Regnator Inferni, impii defensor
Destructor soliorum
Patre Satane, rex hominum tremende
Induce me in Infernum
(Inside an) hellish vortex
I can nearly stand the pain
Spiritus magnus speak to me!

Faciei tuae sunt nox et horror
Cor tuum est sedes mali
Demiant sigilla supra pestes, adveniat mortis
Creator jurem taliones
Tecum omnes gladii Inferni
Credo in Satanam! Credo in Satanam!

Now you are inside me
And all around, i can fight!
