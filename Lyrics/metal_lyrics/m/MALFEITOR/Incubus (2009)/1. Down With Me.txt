[lyrics by M.Fabban 15 June 2008]

Serpent, symbol of earth
Rainbow, symbol of Heaven
between the two all creatures must live and die...
but because he has a soul
man can be trapped in a terrible place
where death is only the beginning

Io Magus, Io Bakor
negative pulse no brainwaves no response to pain
Io Magus, Io Bakor
he was put in a coffin... and buried
Io Magus, Io Bakor

The dark presence of death
as real as cold hand falling on my shoulder
a warning that's what i felt in those eyes

I remember it all... the coffin... the burial
I heard the dirt falling over me
the darkness pressed me down
this is my place, not with the living
Tetrodotoxin, it runs trough the skin to the soul

no rest, you will see all
the cold of the coffin
and when you wake up scream as you want
there is no escape from the grave
there is no escape from the grave

down with me
Bakor sends me into people's nightmares

down with me
Bakor sends me into people's nightmares
where shit floats
where I'm no longer free
