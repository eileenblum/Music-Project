[lyrics by M.Fabban 10 August 2008]

I am the darkness when you try to find the path
I am the bed that burns when you try to sleep
I am the the bitter wind of frost when you feel cold
I am the great wave that hits your boat when you are shipwrecked

I am the one you hate when you look through the mirror
I am the the ground that collapses beneath your feet
I am the the sultry air when you cannot breathe
I am silence when you look for help
I am indifference when you need care

I am your soul
I am the conscience that now tears you to pieces
I am the side you always ignored
I am the other half
The other half

Follow me when I call your name
hear the deepest voice of the endless flame
Let your ruined instinct come to me
open yourself to the light
trough misery
show you inner strength and loyalty
far away from iniquity
come close to me

Strong as the voice of the father
(I'm) the fog you must pass trough
(I am) close to you as a mother
a new view...

I am the other half who lives inside the deepest part of you
your destiny
Let your ruined instinct come to me
open yourself to the light of mystery
