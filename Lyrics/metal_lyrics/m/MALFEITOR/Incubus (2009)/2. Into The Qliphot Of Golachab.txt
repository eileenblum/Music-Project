[lyrics by M.Fabban 25 April 2008]

Cruel
qliphotic might
of those who burn in fire
unbalanced Geburah
wrath of God

In the meander of golachab

glowing sparks in Sitra Ahra
Mars is spreading its stench of death
High are the flames as high as the Fire
Let me feel your last breath!

Ra Nergal
Tu es diabolus
Our furiose hostium Suum destruit
Tu es adversarius dei
Tu es Genitor Mortis

Hanging down the sound of damnation
inside the thirteenth path of malkunofat
the deepest fall into the arms of Ereshkigal

In the meanders of Golachab!
In the meanders of Golachab!
