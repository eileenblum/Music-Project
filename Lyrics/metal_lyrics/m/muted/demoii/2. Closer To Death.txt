We load up the wingspan with rockets to send them to their god
While rich men in suits line their pockets our hands are stained with blood
They try to divert our attention away from the trap that they have been baiting
What you must realize is that we are all conscripts in waiting

Now I am here my belly is filled with fear with what I owe to Satan
Never spent my life loving but perpetually hating
I have been thinking deep within my head
Time for blinking is time to end up dead
I have taken many lives but I have never seen their eyes
There is no discrimination when you are bombing from the skies

So am I a saint or a sinner or somewhere in between?
A man who lives life as a killer will always have bad dreams
They try to divert our attention away from the trap that they have been baiting
What you must realize is that we are all conscripts in waiting

But now I feel I am closer to death like I can almost see his face
And when I take my final breath my soul will fly off into space
Because I cannot pay the debt I owe I feel the clock is counting down
And in the darkness of the great unknown maybe an ocean where we all will drown
