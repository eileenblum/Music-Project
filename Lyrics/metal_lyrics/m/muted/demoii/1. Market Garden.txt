Well Monty has hatched a plan that could win the war
We have a noble cause we all fight for
Three hundred gliders and our paratroops drop in
September seventeenth let this battle begin

Outnumbered in the dark we fight around a vital bridge
It is just a bridge too far we are faced with blood and carnage
They come in droves and the pain is dealt inside freedoms plight
We are battle hardened at Market Garden
Up from the Ardennes Market Garden
We are battle hardened at Market Garden
Up from the Ardennes Market Garden

Now in our second day, the twilight zone
No thoughts of family, no thoughts of home
I am tired, hungry and our stocks are running low
We have a job to do but we are all alone

Maybe a week has passed, we are but a few
The time has faded fast, the lives have too
I hear them coming and I fear I cannot move
We fought so gallantly, we fought this war for you
