Six long days a week they wander around not knowing what to do
They're just waiting for the only day to come by

Then comes Sunday
The best day of the weak
You feel alive
Just for a day

Do what ever you want to do it doesn't really matter
You know the seventh day is coming soon

Yes it's Sunday
The best day of the weak
Everything's forgiven
Until next week

All through the history
It's been a world wide mystery
Why do people have this need
To believe in something

All through the history
It's been a world wide mystery
Why do people fight for something
That isn't even out there

Some of them don't even care
About the rules they so blindly follow
But come the big day and they are the ones in the front line

Then comes Sunday
The best day of the weak
Just give them your money
And you'll feel clean

All through the history
It's been a world wide mystery
Why do people have this need
To believe in something

All through the history
It's been a world wide mystery
Why do people fight for something
That isn't even out there

They're living inside the four walls
Outside is the free world
Freedom is a sin you might as well forget it

Until Sunday
The best day of the weak
Feel free to go
But you must

All through the history
It's been a world wide mystery
Why do people have this need
To believe in something

All through the history
It's been a world wide mystery
Why do people fight for something
That isn't even out there

All through the history
It's been a world wide mystery
Why do people have this need
To believe in something

All through the history
It's been a world wide mystery
Why do people fight for something that isn't even out there
