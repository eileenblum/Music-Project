It all started back in 1881
The northern men have battled all
Through the country
Times were good times were bad
Now we're back where we belong
They thought we were dead but
Proud men never die

I will always be one
I will always stand by you
I will always be there for you

You will always be one
You will always stand by me
You will always be there for me

We've always had some great leaders
From Sudell to the great ginger one
The first real battle we won in 1889
In year 2000 we came back for more

Together in joy or sorrow
We will keep on fighting
Together in the end we will win

I will always be one
I will always stand by you
I will always be there for you

1889 1890 1904 1913
1951 1971 1996 2000
1889 1938 1889 1889

I will always be one
I will always stand by you
I will always be there for you

You will always be one
You will always stand by me
You will always be there for me

Together in joy or sorrow
We will keep on fighting
Together in the end we will win

I will always be one
I will always stand by you
I will always be there for you

You will always be one
You will always stand by me
You will always be there for me

Together in joy or sorrow
We will keep on fighting
Together in the end we will win
