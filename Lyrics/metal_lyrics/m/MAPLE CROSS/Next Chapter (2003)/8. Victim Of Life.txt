When the time comes I'll make my move
It won't be long can you hear my pain
There is no answer only one solution
Prepared to kill hell yeah

Urge for innocent blood
Mistake of nature
Urge for innocent blood
I have no remorse

There is no life without death
There is no death without life
There is no life without death
There is no death without life

I know what I need to do
I want to taste blood again
The need to kill is getting stronger
I just can't wait for much longer

Urge for innocent blood
Mistake of nature
Urge for innocent blood
I have no remorse

I have no remorse

Slow death is coming to you

Can you hear it's coming
Can you hear it's calling
Slow death is coming to you

Can you hear it's coming
Can you hear it's calling
Slow death is coming to you

Can you hear it's coming
Can you hear it's calling
Slow death is coming to you
