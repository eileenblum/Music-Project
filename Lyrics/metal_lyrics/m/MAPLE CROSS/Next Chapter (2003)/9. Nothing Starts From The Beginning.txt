So you're telling me
There has to be an end
All of this will be gone someday
What has happened before
Has no meaning to you
Because it won't last
It has started from somewhere
It has to end someway
There's a beginning there's an end
It's always been like that
You say look at the past

It makes no difference what I say
What was before and what will be
You're sure it won't last

Nothing
Nothing starts from the beginning
There was something before
And always will be
Nothing
Nothing starts from the beginning
The end is a beginning
Of something new

It makes no difference what I say
What was before and what will be
You're sure it won't last

So I might be a dreamer
At least that's what you think
So I might be a dreamer
At least I don't dwell in sorrow

Nothing
Nothing starts from the beginning
There was something before
And always will be
Nothing
Nothing starts from the beginning
The end is a beginning
Of something new

Nothing
Nothing starts from the beginning
There was something before
And always will be
Nothing
Nothing starts from the beginning
The end is a beginning
Of something new
