I don't really care
About you plastic people living in fear
Who'll you follow next week
It doesn't really matter
You're still fucking weak

Why the fuck are you staring at me
Am I some kind of mystery
Why the fuck are you laughing at me
You are not any better than me
Why the fuck are you talking to me
Save your words to someone who cares
Why the fuck do you even try
Why don't you go away and die

Keep on living your sad little dream
Soon you'll notice you're nothing but 8/40
All hope is gone
Now it's time to drink and pick up a gun

Why the fuck are you staring at me
Does it look like I even care
Why the fuck are you smiling at me
You won't find any sympathy
Why the fuck are you talking to me
Save your words to someone who cares
Why the fuck do you even try
Why don't you go away and die
I don't really care
About you plastic people living in fear
Soon you'll die anyway
And no one remembers your fame

Why the fuck are you staring at me
Am I some kind of mystery
Why the fuck are you smiling at me
You won't find any sympathy
Why the fuck are you talking to me
Save your words to someone who cares
Why the fuck do you even try
Why don't you go away and die

Loser why don't you die
Loser why don't you die
Loser why don't you die
Loser why don't you die

Why don't you die
Why don't you fucking die
