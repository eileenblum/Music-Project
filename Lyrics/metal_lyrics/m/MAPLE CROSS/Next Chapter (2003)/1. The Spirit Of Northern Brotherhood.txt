It's great to be back
It's great to feel like living again
It's great to be back
It's great to have this chance again

Like a never ending dream of insomnia
Awakened by cold shiver of reality
Endless path of possibilities
Like a river filled with ideas

Everyone has this feeling of togetherness
Ancient troops still feel like part of us
It's far away from the fool's cross
Northern spirit will never be crushed

Everything is so familiar
It's just like it used to be
Lots of barriers will be crushed
Fire is still strong inside the ancient one

This time it will be taken further
It's all about the brotherhood
Uncontrolled art of rules
Sacrificing the only witch

Everyone has this feeling of togetherness
Ancient troops still feel like part of us
It's far away from the fool's cross
Northern spirit will never be crushed

It's great to be back
It's great to feel like living again
It's great to be back
It's great to have this chance again

Everyone has this feeling of togetherness
Ancient troops still feel like part of us
It's far away from the fool's cross
Northern spirit will never be crushed
