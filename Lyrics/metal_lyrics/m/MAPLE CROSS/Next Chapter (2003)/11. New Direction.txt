It's amazing I'm still alive after all everything around me dies
Consider this as my last resort because I might be the next one to go

I need to take a whole new direction
I need to change it all for me
I must leave you all behind
After all this is my life

My own life
This is my life
Just my only life
My fucking life

Fuck you you piece of shit
You just don't get me
I need my freedom
And I'm ready to move on now

Too many lies
Too many broken promises
Now we've come to this there's no return
I watch you die
In front of my eyes
Now I see what you really are
And it ain't that much
Then I turn around

The pain is gone
I feel my mind
Is this my life
Could it be like this

The pain is gone
I feel my mind
Is this my life
Could it be like this

Like this
Like this

I always thought
That I was free
I could never imagine it would feel so great
But it does
No more lies
I've left the hole and I won't go back
I'm alive I'm alive
