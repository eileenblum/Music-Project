Alone in silence for the rest of my life
I can see it clearly in my mind the days gone by
How can I keep this up no strength to fight

Forgotten Joe is my name can you hook me up
I know they're hard to find that's why I asked

Rush hour in the highway of thoughts
What did I do wrong why was I left alone
The battle was already lost 56 years ago
Well I better go now and leave them alone

Why
Why did they leave me to die
Tell me why
Why I will die all alone

Why
Why did they leave me to die
Tell me why
Why I will die all alone
Now I know why
And I'm ready to die
