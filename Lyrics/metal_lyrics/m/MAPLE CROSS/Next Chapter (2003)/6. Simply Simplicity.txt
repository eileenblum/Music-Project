Mind filled with black and white
Thoughts nowhere to be found
Day after day stand in the queue
At the end of the day everything's the same

Something's missing from your life
But you feel fulfilled
Enough is not enough
But you've got everything you need

Or so you think
Or so you think you know
Or so you think you know
You think

But you don't know
But you don't know you think
But you don't know you think
You know

Something's missing from your life
But you feel fulfilled
Enough is not enough
But you've got everything you need
Everything you need

But you don't know
But you don't really think
But I won't tell you

You have no idea
Not a single cell
Another simple soul another simple mind
It's too easy it's too fuckin' easy
Easy
