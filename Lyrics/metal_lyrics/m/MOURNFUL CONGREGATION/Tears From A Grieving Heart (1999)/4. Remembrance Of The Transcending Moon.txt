A mountain of harmony peaking with vibrance
In the firmament of non-being
Gathering mist and drawing mystic essence
And bleeding its golden blood

Remembrance of the transcending moon
Pakle, tranquil, distand...
And further...

Dejected life force enflaming the venlif act
Of the downward stream
Currents pulsate in an everflowing interchanging aura
Dissipating humanic awe
