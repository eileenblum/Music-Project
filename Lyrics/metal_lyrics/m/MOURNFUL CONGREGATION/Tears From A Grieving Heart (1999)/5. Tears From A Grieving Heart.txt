Like tears from a grieving heart
We flow to the deepest depths
Every crevice is filled
With memories of depression
A sea on earth is a sea of tears
Forever being added to
For mankind to drown in
The shards of shattered hope
Forever reincarnated
As our souls reliving the turmoil
Once again cry out
As blood flows from the heart
So to does depression
Understanding only comes at death
Not before
We watch from their eyes
As they fade into eternity
Beneath is where they lay
Their knowledgeable smirks devour us
