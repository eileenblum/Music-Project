A time when skies fell
And all expanse
Constricted to nought

The golden serpent sat impregnable
in the womb of darkness

Coiled in wait
Breathless in hibernation
All inner voices sang (the song of) silence

Wise but blind
Seeing but unknowing
All-consuming
All-devouring

The first, devoured by the second
Shadows of the shadow

We are they
Shadow of the shadows

The imperishable may now perish
The devoured now devour

Draw deep this breath, for it is thy last
The great prayer has now been sung.....

The laws of nature have been buried in ruin
The affrighted sun has been deprived of its light
All futures have cast their shadows before
All pasts have left their impress behind
