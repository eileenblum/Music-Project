Slow crawl amidst boughs of oak
Where light of sun is banished

The incubus of karma is upon us

How tall these trees, scent dampened by earth
Where darkness and cold shade reign

I seek the wooded secrets
The knowledge that conceals more than it reveals

I am the voice of all sorrows
I am the source of all pain
I speak the voice of sorrow
I speak the voice of pain

So harmoniously beautiful
So reverently melodious
The deceptive magic of temptation
Respite only in deep dreamless sleep
These temptations
The seeing of their loathsomeness eludes me

Evil incarnations
Broken vows
Of the old kings
Dark span looming

Onerous chants
Linger in the peripheral
Evil, evil
Fates weave through winding fates

Darkness lay siege to light
Exaltations turn to punishments
All earthly pleasures cease
The incubus of karma is upon us.....
