My candle burns through
As I awaken from my astralic dreams
Seems like years have passed by

And now I write
I have found the ability within myself
To be able to portray the future

The visions I have witnessed
Enlighten all my thoughts on life
There is still much yet to be discovered
I dreamt of floating across seas
As faint winds carried me
Higher and higher
Until I reach the astral plane
