As the sun goes down and darkness arrives
My mind flees from fear of death
Suicide has taken so many lives
I am at the stage where I cannot decide
To take my life or to go on living
Is this a sin please tell me God
I mourn at the thought of my loved ones death
It seems that there is nothing left for me
Suicide remains an option inside
I do not know whether I should be dead
I only wish that God would answer my prayers
Grief, pain, torture and death
Are the only feelings I know
Living is now called pain to me
Love is lost in my memory
I am now forced to feel sorrow
Will I last to see tomorrow
I am waiting for a change in this abnormal life
Will it come and will I survive
If I commit suicide I cannot be sure
If I will end up in heaven or hell
As the darkness fades and I see the first rays of light
Another day of misery is all that is ahead of me
