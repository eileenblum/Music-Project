...Heads Bowed...
A moment of bitterness overcomes me
The object is there but I am not ready
The spirits are whispering waiting to engulf me
Mesmerising chimes distant and abstracted

...The Descent...
I enhance the object of stone, a statue
Concentrating my mind on this point
Rising towards the spirits, the chimes intensify
I am following the quabalistic tree

...Oblivion...
The endless images of forthcoming tranquility
Prosperity is mine as I inhabit the skies
Day is night and time is nonexistent
I am not in my own forever...
