Thy vessel emptied
No longer this temple a master
Through blood relieved
Is soul retrieved

Immanence of eternity
False promise of mythologies
Majesty of infinity
Illusion from the prayers of fools

Silence overwhelms those meagre voices
Felled by the rayless sun
The voice of the deep speaks no more
Silence, but for the cries in eternal sleep

Harbinger of the profane
A torment unto thyself
Herald to impending pain
....Life truely is in vain
