I'm failing to bring peaceful emotions
For a reason which I cannot perceive
But for a moment I am lost
In my own mind, alone
Those painful memories come flooding back
Like a sea of tortured deities
I will die believing life is worthless
For depression describes my every thought
No longer is love relevant
To love would be to die
To look at what has already been looked at
Every day by myself
Has stopped my mind from acknowledging
The quality of this earth's belongings
All words are lost within a desperate imagination
For rain does not cease to fall in my mind
A grey cloud dwells behind my eyelids
I do not thrive on anything but the thought of dying
Leaving this earth is my soul aim in life
Doom to me is revelation...
