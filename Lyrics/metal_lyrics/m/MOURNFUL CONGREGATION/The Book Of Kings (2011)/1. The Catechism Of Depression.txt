Seething undertows shape searing limbs
Relentless fuel for the eternal fires
The flames devoured the seeds that contained them
Long inert spirits have risen in restless glee

The once harmonious strings that bind the universe
Have been tuned to dischord

Cacophonous aura of illness and woe

Man is but beast of inimitable foulness
But spirit is foulest, devoid and askew

Impure is the secret that all men speak
Impurity is the secretâ¦â¦
