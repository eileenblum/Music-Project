Like the joining of two mighty seas
The star stream of darkness meets
The paleness of dawn
Shattering the backbone of night
From the horizon and across the skies

Brilliant flames first red
Climb slowly to the white heat,
Lucent slendor arcs westward
The shadows cast betrays,
As if borne by four winds

Overtaking, overtaking, inexorable

The descent of flames,
The rise of calm twilight,
As the night smothers the day...
