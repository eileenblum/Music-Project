Floods of tears oppose your beauty
Condoling this love which lay shattered
Never exploring the depths of affection
Broken from rejected devotion

Lamented pleas of my yearning
Ignoring while you persist in hurting
Excessive trifling assured this demise
Deploring those vain expectations

Sweeping away piece of blood red emotion
Uneasily forgotten, reminiscing, drowning in
Drak seas of endless pain
Embodied scenes of your loveless ruin
