When the waters cover the earth once more
And the great sea weeps again
Darkness shall coke the dying light
And the almighty king sun bleed

Only then shall we come to know
That which is our mortal thirst

For heavenly realms is our soul athirst
This pain is felt by man alone

I remember when the transcendent moon
Brought the lunar waves even higher
Creation, from the vivid lucidity, an emonation
Who am I? That created creation...

Glorification be to your name and ways
Thou art the bringer of greatness
In your name we art lost
We art but microcosmic dust
We art by your extention
Your limbs art our souls
Your dark is our light
Yet let not our ignorant prose
Be he upheard by your manifold omnipresence
For thour art wisdom personified
Thou art the Transcendental
