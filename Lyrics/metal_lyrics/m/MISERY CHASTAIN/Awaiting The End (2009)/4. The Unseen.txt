In the night he waits and watches with eager eyes.
Seeking to drain every last bit of life from this vessel.
From this sacred heart.
This blood thirsty beast.
He's like a starving vulture.
Everyday his eyes are on us.
Yes his eyes are on us.
There is nowhere we can escape him.
A man's life is but a fog.
It's gone without a trace.
Lost behold the minds misconception.
Lives are overtaken and battles lost when the sword is dropped and the lazy hands begin to fold.
He still creeps closer.
There is no more time.
There is one who seeks to kill us.
Rise and take your sword in your hand.
Face the night.
Take back the blood that's been shed.
With vengeance.
With anger.
We will avenge the blood of the fallen.
We will avenge their blood
