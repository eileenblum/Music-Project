Peel the skin back.
Expose the heart.
Let's see who we really are.
We hide behind fake smiles these rotten minds.
Blood stained hands tell no lies.
As darkness falls and the huntress hunts seeking out the innocent.
How many more must fall victim to the lust of man?
Living in such a time as this many will grow numb.
Let me not be one who sits back and watches the world waste away.
But we can be more than the world says we can be.
I will be more than who my father taught me to be.
I will be a man.
We must face these demons.
And spit in the face of fear.
We must stand for who we are.
This is not the end. [x4]
This is where new life begins. [x3]
