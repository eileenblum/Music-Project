I've seen the sky turn black.
The faces of a thousand fallen angels.
Streets littered with decaying bodies.
I've looked into the eyes of death.
And held tight to her lifeless heart.
Walking through dark and dreadful halls.
Searching for a reason of being.
Knowing there's more to this vision.
More than eyes can see.
We know the end draws near.
So we fight. We fight through the night.
Thrusting the sword till the first sight of light has come.
The dark angel falls face to the ground for here knows his defeat.
We've been held down too long by the struggles of life trying to be what was never intended to see.
The hand of death grasps the earth.
As the faith of the strong melts away.
This blackened sky tells the fate of a fallen... generation.
And the earth shakes for its birth pains are strong.
Dig your heels deep in the soil and wait for your final stand.
For we are in the end of time.
The ground bleeds.
Oh the filth of man kind.
Can things ever be made right in this sea of regrets and shattered dreams?

One can only hope for new beginnings.
New beginnings.
