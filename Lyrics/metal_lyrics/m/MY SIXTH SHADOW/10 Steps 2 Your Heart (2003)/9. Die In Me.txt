I take a look into your heart
And see the blackness inside
Inside of you
I taste the flavour of your tears
This bitter pain is flowin'
Is flowin out of you

Never see the sun rise
Rising over you
You told me that you' re suffering
Die in me
Never feel you heart beats
Bleeding on and on
Seeking for a reason
Die in me

I take a look into your heart
And see the blackness inside
Inside of you
I taste the flavour of your tears
This bitter pain is flowin'
Is flowin out of you

You will find a shelter
In this killing hands
Settin' free your soul
You will find a saviour
You will die in me
In meâ¦.

Die in me, die in me, die in meâ¦
