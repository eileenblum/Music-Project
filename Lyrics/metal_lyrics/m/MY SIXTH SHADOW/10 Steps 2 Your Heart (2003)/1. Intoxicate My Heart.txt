I'm trying to hide
This emptiness
You left me inside
I ain't got no choice
This fragile part of me
That leave me
Without voice

Without voice
I ain't got no choice

[Chorus:]
You're my heaven
I'm gonna fly on the feathers
O' your golden wings
You're my endless
State o' grace
You're like a nectar
Intoxicates my heart

I'm tryin' to fight
This loneliness
You left me inside
I ain't got no choice
The weakest part of me
That leave me
Without voice
