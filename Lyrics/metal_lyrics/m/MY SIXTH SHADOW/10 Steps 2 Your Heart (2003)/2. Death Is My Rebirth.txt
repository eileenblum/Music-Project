I am cryin'
'cause I have opened my eyes
And saw the whole world
All around
(It's all around me)
I am suffering
'cause I have opened my eyes
I gotta runaway
From here

From this land of lies
And pain

[Chorus:]
I know that death is my rebirth
I need dyin' to forget
Every pain and every hurt
I get inside
All I need is to die

I am tryin'
To win this struggle inside
I know that death is
There for me
(Please take me with you)
I don't belong here
I feel just like a stranger
I guess my place
Is faraway

From this land of lies
And pain

[Chorus]
