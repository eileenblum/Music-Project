Your face, your eyes
And all I know of you
Is far away
Your tears, your blood
Still flow in me
I can't deny it

This love we shared
This love of us
I can't forget it
I can't do without you
Your name is still the breath of my words

Your taste, your scent
Still all around of me
You' re everywhere
Your voice, your lies
When you got rid of me
You know it

This love we shared
This love of us
I can't forget it
I can't do without you
Your name is still the breath of my words

Be my arms
My bleeding arms
The satisfaction for you thirst
Be my heart
My broken heart
The way I measure all my love
Be my life
Be my sacrifice
The price I got to pay for you
