Consider this empty world
watch it as it falls
Sign it in your head
Sign it in your head

Ear their empty words
The falsity they show
Sign it in your head
Sign it in your head

Don't let 'em tear you down
Get up n' shout it loud
Don't let' em tread on you
Don't let 'em take you for a fool

Consider this empty world
Watch it as it falls
Sign it in your head
Sign it in your head

Ear their empty words
The falsity they show
Sign it in your head
Sign it in your head

[Chorus:]
You're tryin' on
To save your soul from their lies
You carry on
But they wanna change your mind
You gotta hold on
An' leave this senseless world behind

Your personal style of life
The light you got inside
Don't let 'em take it away
Don't let 'em take it away

They try to mend your head
Makin' you someone else
Don't trust in what they say
Don't trust in what they say

[Chorus]
