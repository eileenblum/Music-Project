One million chances I found tonight
You are there to be my guide
Carryin' me to your absence of light
And I want it

Tell me something new
Tell me something strange
Overall the sense of this pouring rain
All I left behind
All the tears I cried
Fallin' down and down from my bleedin' eyes

You are the other part o' me
Increasin' day by day
You are the contrary of the light
My worst enemy

(Give me your soul tonight)
And I'm ready for you
(Give me your heart tonight)
And I accept my destiny for you
(I want everything of you)
You are the mirror where I'm watching through

Turn my mortal flesh
Into grains of sand
Turn my tearing eyes
In the darkest night
Let me be your slave
Let me fade away
In your open arms
I will find my God

You are the other part o' me
Increasin' day by day
You are the contrary of the light
My worst enemy

(Give me your soul tonight)
And I'm ready for you
(Give me your heart tonight)
And I accept my destiny for you
(I want everything of you)
You are the mirror where I'm watching through

One million chances I found tonight
You are there to be my guide
Carryin' me to your absence of light
And I want it

(Give me your soul tonight)
And I'm ready for you
(Give me your heart tonight)
And I accept my destiny for you
(I want everything of you)
You are the mirror where I'm watching through
