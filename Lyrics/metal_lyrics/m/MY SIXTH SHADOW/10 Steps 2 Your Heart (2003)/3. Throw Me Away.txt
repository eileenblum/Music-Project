I don't know what's the matter
I don't know what you've done
To me my love
Never felt all this void inside
Never thought I could fall
So down and down

So down and down

[Chorus:]
You throw me away
Like something that ain't worth
You play with my heart

I don't know what's the matter
All I know I have failed
With you my love
I can't stand your remind inside of me
I can't avoid to fall
So down and down

So down and down

[Chorus]

You stare at me
As I wait for you
I need your embrace
I walk through the darkness
Of my life
And that's for you

[Chorus]
