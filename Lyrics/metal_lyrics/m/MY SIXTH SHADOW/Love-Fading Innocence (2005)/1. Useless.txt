[Music: Vic, Dave; lyrics: Dave]

Another day
A wasted day
(And I don't have an alibi)
I spend my time
In stupid rites
(To find a reason for my life)

[Pre-chorus]
There ain't a chance
A fucking chance
To be a different one to me
There ain't a chance
I've always failed
It's just an endless fall

[Chorus]
I am asking to my senses
The reason for I am going down
I am looking for the traces
Of an endless sleep
Nobody wants to hear me
Nobody wants to same me now
I need chance to runaway
Over my useless life

I'd need to pray
But I won't pray
(I am too tired to receive a sign)
Another time
In futile rites
(My eyes are empty I guess I'm blind)

[Pre-chorus]
There ain't a chance
A fucking chance
To be a different one to me
There ain't a chance
I've always failed
It's just a costant fall

[Chorus]
I am asking to my senses
The reason for I am going down
I am looking for the traces
Of an endless sleep
Nobody wants to hear me
Nobody wants to save me now
I need a chance to runaway
Over my useless life

There ain't a chance
A fucking chance
To be a different one to me
There ain't a chance
I've always failed
It's just an endless fall
(Over my useless life)
