[Music: Vic; lyrics: Dave]

How do you feel
When my emotions come to real
And all your breath declines
Into silver drops of light
The vanishing point
Where I put my mortal spoils
Where I'd like to fade away
Where I'd like to cut my veins

[Chorus]
These shades of grey
These shades of me
I made this void inside
These shades of grey
You left in me
I never meant to change your life into death

How can you feel
As my devotion comes to real
As I weep myself to sleep
Into these crawling shades of grey
This perishing light
If I try to close my eyes
If I try to fade away
Now it's time to cut my veins

[Chorus]
These shades of grey
These shades of me
No redemption for your life
These shades of grey
You left in me
I never meant to change your life into death

Fear - Coldness - Confusion
The twisted form of my mind
An empty cradle painted of black
This is the maze that closed myself

These shades of grey
These shades full of memories
These shades prevail
Surrounding all I see
The shades of grey
The shades of my life

[Solo]
