[Music: Vic; lyrics: Dave]

Escaping
The sun light
And waiting for the dark to come
I'm craving
And taking
A long breath to begin to run
Distortion
Contortion
A never ending dispute in my brain
I'm acting
Or just pretending
To be the man that I am not

[Pre-chorus]
This is just my opinion
(I'm crushed by love)
I'll lose myself into the oblivion
(I'm crushed by love)
Have I got to go away
Have I got to mend my mistakes
Ooooh I'm crushed by love

[Chorus]
I want to fly free
And break all these chains you imposed me
Don't wannabe crushed by love
I want to break lose
I don't wanna see you deride me
Don't wannabe crushed by love

Refusing
The delight
Of your bloody kisses on my heart
I'm waiting
N' searching
For another chance to be the one
I take over
And consider
Every lie you told me from the start
I am acting
Or just pretending
To have the strength that I have not

[Pre-chorus]
This is just my opinion
(I'm crushed by love)
I'll lose myself into the oblivion
(I'm crushed by love)
Have I got to run away
Have I got to mend my mistakes
Ooooh I'm crushed by love

[Chorus]
I want to fly free
And break all these chains you imposed me
Don't wannabe crushed by love
I want to break lose
I don't wanna see you deride me
Don't wannabe crushed by love
