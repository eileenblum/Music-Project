[Music: Vic; lyrics: Dave]

I don't think it's necessary
To show my inner state
I don't think you're necessary
To save me from this gorge
To follow to the other side
Where I'll kill my self

[Chorus]
I'm running through the burning fields
Of my lonely darkest days
I'm feeling lost inside the frame
Of my lonely darkest days

I don't need this life
I've buried beneath my withered heart
And don't you try to tell your fairy
Tales so don't you try
To give me all your beaming light
I've lost inside me

[Chorus]
I'm running through the burning fields
Of my lonely darkest days
I'm feeling lost inside the frame
Of my lonely darkest days
