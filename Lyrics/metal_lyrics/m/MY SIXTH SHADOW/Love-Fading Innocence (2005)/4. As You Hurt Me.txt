[Music: Vic; lyrics: Dave]

Show me the secret
Behind your intentions
(Before I got)
Before I got
Another impression
Of dubious emotions
Cause I don't wanna be your slave

[Chorus]
I see you deride
All the feelings I use to hide
I'll never complain
As you hurt me I want to stare

Somewhere there will be something
To explain me why
Oh, oh
You want me to be enslaved
By the wish of your love

Show me the way
Of your gratification
(Before I was)
Before I was
Another insensible
Sign of desolation
Cause I don't wanna take these chains

[Chorus]
I see you deride
All the feelings I use to hide
I'll never complain
As you hurt me I want to stare

(The pain, the anger the suffering)
