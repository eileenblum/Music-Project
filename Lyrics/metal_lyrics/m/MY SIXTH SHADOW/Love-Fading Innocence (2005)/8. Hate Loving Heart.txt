[Music: Vic, Dave; lyrics: Dave]

(I know, I know)
There is something
You left behind
In a hidden place in time
It's a strange kind of magic
That makes the sun go down
I never meant to live in sorrow
Never meant to bear this way
I gotta spread all the tears never cried before

Distant spaces for a lonely heart

[Chorus]
You're getting all
Cause your name is the meaning of love
You're getting more
What I've got and what I've done
You're getting love
Cause my life is simply a shade
Inside your hate-loving heart

I fall, I fall
There ain't nothing
I can look bright
It's a glowing glide inside
It's a sort of enchantment
That makes me go so down
I never meant to live this sorrow
Never meant this way at all
I gotta cry all my best for the sake of you

There's no heaven for a lonely heart

[Chorus]
You're getting all
Cause your name is the meaning of love
You're getting more
What I've got and what I've done
You're getting love
Cause my life is simply a shade
Inside your hate-loving heart

[Solo]

[Chorus]
You're getting all
Cause your name is the meaning of love
You're getting more
What I've got and what I've done
You're getting love
Cause my life is simply a shade
Inside your hate-loving heart
