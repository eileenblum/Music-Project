[Music: Vic, Dave; lyrics: Dave]

Hold me
Enslaved me
And catch me in your dark embrace
Watch me
I'm begging to you
All the dreams that you have

Uhh
I'm bleeding for you

[Chorus]
All I know
Is that you're taking me
Into your dark world
All I want
Is the satisfaction
Of your black blood
All I've done
Is another step in you
Because now
I belong to you forever

Take me
Enslave me
And kill me in your dark embrace
Watch me
I'm bleeding for you
And give you all the dreams that I had

Uhh
I'm dying for you

[Chorus]

it's all gone
In a hidden part beneath your dark world
 it's all lost
In a drowning fall into your black blood
it's all done
Just another step in you
From now on
I'll belong to you forever

[Chorus]
