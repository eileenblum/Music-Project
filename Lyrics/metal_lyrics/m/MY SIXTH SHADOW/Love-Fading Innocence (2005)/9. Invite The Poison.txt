[Music: Vic; lyrics: Dave]

You feel so blue
You feel so alone
I know there is no more chance to
To make it right
To fall n' die
You've got to realize

[Chorus]
Invite the poison
Don't b afraid
(You never have to live this way)
Invite the poison
With no remorse
(This life you know is something wrong)

You feel so down
You feel so untrue
I know there is no more time to
To make it real
Your dreams they steal
You got to realize

[Chorus]
Invite the poison
Don't waste your time
(You never have to live in pain)
Invite the poison
Don't hesitate
(This life you know it's something wrong)

You try n' try
Just one more time
There is no God
Who wants to hear you prayin'
I'll fly over you
I'll b your guide
N' teach you to fly
Over this land
Of misery
You'll fly over your tragedies
N' teach you to fly
N' teach you to fly
To this special place
Where you'll never fall in pain
