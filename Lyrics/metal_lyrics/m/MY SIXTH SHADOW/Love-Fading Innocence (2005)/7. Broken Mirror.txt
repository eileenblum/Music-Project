[Music: Vic; lyrics: Dave]

I am still waiting
For the dawn
To heal the wounds inside my heart
(The pain's still increasing)
I'm wondering
I'm seeking for
The meaning of this pool of blood
(You won't watch me creeping)

[Pre-chorus]
Honestly
I don't know why
(You're walking by the straight lines of my mind)
Strongly
I need you by my side
(I need you, I need you, I need you by my side)

[Chorus]
These are the words I never spoke
These clear things never seen before
The broken mirror of your soul
Without my image anymore
This is the time I ever thought
The freedom never felt before
The broken mirror of your soul
Without my essence anymore
The spell now is broken
Definitely from my soul

My hands are stained
What have I done?
Your lifeless body on the floor
(Your eyes can't start crying)
No sympathy
There's no remorse
I did the right way I know for sure
(And you can't stop laughing)

[Pre-chorus]
Honestly
I don't know why
(You wander in the dark side of my mind )
Sincerely
I need you by my side
(I need you, I need you, I need you by my side)

[Chorus]
These are the words I never spoke
These clear things never seen before
The broken mirror of your soul
Without my image anymore
This is the time I ever thought
The freedom I never felt before
The broken mirror of your soul
Without my essence anymore
The spell now is broken
Definitely from my soul
...From my soul

I am still waiting for the dawn
To heal the damage inside of my heart
