[Music: Vic; lyrics: Dave]

"So far from your heart, babe
How can u kill this love"

As the world is sleepin' at night
You know I think around my life
It was like a dream
Now it's just a nightmare
All the ways you're draining my eyes
All the pain you make me cry
All I get is this vengeance of you
I ain't got the courage to defend

[Chorus]

So far from your heart
Babe
Why do you let me fall
So far from your heart
Darling
How can you kill this love

I hope these words catch you inside
I wish they enter your private life
I am down on my knees
Please don't make me suffer
The times we tried to reach for the sky
Now I guess I was so blind
Oh, I was just the one
To hope our dream came true

[Chorus]

So far from your heart
Babe
Why do you let me fall
So far from your heart
My darling
How can you kill this love

"How can you kill me inside"

[Solo]

[Chorus]
