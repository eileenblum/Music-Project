[Music: Vic; lyrics: Dave, Vic]

Do you remember the time that we share
When we were one of two?
It can't be true
This change of you
Every time that I gave you my life
You hurt me like a knife
In the deep of my heart
You're just a shadow in my love

Oh baby you left me alone
Love is the deepest colour
In my heart that burns in sorrow
Shadows in my love

I can't forget all the times that we shared
You're in everything that moves
How I can love
You never knew
And I can't do without thinking of you
You're still in everyplace
Where we have gone
You're just a shadow in my love
Oh baby you left me alone
Love is the deepest colour
In my heart that burns in sorrow
Shadows in my love

You said that I filled your life
But now I know
You told me lies

You're still beside me inside my dreams
You're just a shadow in my love

Oh baby you left me alone
Love is the deepest colour
In my heart that burns in sorrow
Shadows in my love
