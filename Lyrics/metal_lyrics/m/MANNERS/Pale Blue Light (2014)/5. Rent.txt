It isnât hard to snap a neck with the weight of the world as leverage
Lowered into a shallow grave of paycheck after paycheck
Stuck between your wallet folds
is the cash you got for the childhood you sold
And now youâre wondering what happened

What happened is:
You sold your soul to buy the dream,
You were convinced âit would never happen to me,â
You bought a house with the money you saved,
You found the âperfect â wife who felt the same,
You ate dinner every night at 8,
and every weekend was exactly the same.
Your perfect family became a machine
and now thereâs no escaping.
This life we live, is it all a lie?
Keep wishing your empty life was something more than wasted time
Its all downhill from here,
a slow death making love to your office chair
When you come home late at night, the lights not on,
thereâs no one there.
She left a long time ago with the money and the kids
and the life you shared,
now youâre left sleeping all alone
in a bed for two piss drunk and miserable.
Drowning in the cold sweats, youâre a nervous wreck
as you soak up the fumes and the toxins.
As you stare up at the ceiling fan
you wonder to yourself
âhow the fuck did this happenâ
