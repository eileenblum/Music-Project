The sun wonât fall tonight but when it does it will refuse to rise
Thereâs nothing left in this worn out vase that I call life
The flowers bloomed early and without water they died
Youâre not the first visitor that Iâve had tonight
So take these broken wings and place them in a basic sling,
Leave my body for 40 days and then scatter the remains

Itâs been raining for days on end; you canât imagine the year Iâve had
Living in isolation, I guess Iâve lost track of my friends
The worst part of it all is I have no body left to call
Iâve burned every last bridge, tonight the sun wont fall

The sun wonât fall tonight, but when it does it will refuse to rise
Thereâs nothing left in this worn out vase that I call life
The flowers bloomed early and without water they died
Youâre not the first visitor that Iâve had tonight
So take these broken wings and place them in a basic sling,
Leave my body for 40 days and then scatter the remains
Iâve been in my bed for days,
and Iâm not sure what Iâd say if I open up whatâs in my brain

And I hate myself for this,
the constant disconnect every time my moods all shift
And I want to be myself, am I too far gone for help?
I guess only time will tell
