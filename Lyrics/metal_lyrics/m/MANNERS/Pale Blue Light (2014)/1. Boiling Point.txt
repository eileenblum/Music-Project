I fly this flag above my head
like my father and his father before him,
but these days I cant seem to fight
wars for causes that I just donât believe in
Our children are born singing
the same old songs of confusion and hate
and we sit by idly
and let the dead crop rise to feed this country

Donât tell me Iâm no patriot
just because I donât believe the lies theyâre telling
If you opened your eyes for just one second
You would see the country you love crumbling at your feet
They failed you when they went back on their word
If you wont defend yourselves no one will
