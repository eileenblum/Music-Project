Lately Iâve been contemplating the reason weâre all here
I cant seem to find a reason for why
a quick story telling exercise from paranoid people lost in time
could account for a thousand years of violent crimes
You can call me a cynic,
you can call me unwise,
you can tell me Iâll burn when I reach the other side.

As long as Iâm able ill be living my life,
free of the revelationâs butchers knife,
free of fear of the fathers glare,
free of the aches in my knees from pulpits prayers.
I donât need to be saved by anyone
The truth is lost on somebody like me

Give me back all the people Iâve lost,
take away all of the suffering that I saw,
return to me all of the bodies of the innocent.
Until then, ill never trust the infinite.
But for now Iâm alone and Iâm doing just fine,
all I see are the clouds when I look at the sky,
got all the meaning in my life that I need,
Iâll never need another being to help me succeed.
I donât need your prayers, I donât need your pity,
I donât need to be saved,
Your world wasnât meant for me
