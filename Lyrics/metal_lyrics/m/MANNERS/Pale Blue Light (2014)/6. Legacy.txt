Who am I now, who was I then?
The same person? Iâm not convinced
A decade on my own, a lifetime left to live,
the end is coming quick and I have nothing to show for it
And Iâve been hoping this whole time
the words that I write would keep me from the grave
Nothingâs ever permanent, Iâm just getting used to it
Trying to leave my mark on this but nothing ever seems to stick
Iâve spent all my time alone wondering about the life I chose (or didnât)
When Iâm gone how will you remember me?
Like a dream or like a vivid memory?
Will these words I write ever reach your lips or will they go unsung?
Promise me you wont forget who I am
When my bones are all gone,
will my words still be here?
