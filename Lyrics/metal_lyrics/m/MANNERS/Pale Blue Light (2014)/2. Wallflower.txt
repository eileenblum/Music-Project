Carry me home like the last time,
itâs late and I need to close my eyes
This week, this month, this year and
this stress is starting to get out of hand
Pour a drink, thereâs my future misleading me over and over,
40 hours bleeding me dry,
casually crossing over the line.
One day Iâm stable, the next day Iâm not,
reliving nightmares I wish I forgot
somewhere between my mouth and the glass
lies the truth about who I am
I guess I donât know myself at all
Have you ever felt like you could sleep for a thousand years?
Just close your eyes and forget to wake
just to get your mind cleared
I think I need a fucking vacation,
I think I need to stop and breathe
I cant take another day of this,
this crippling anxiety

Faceless, nameless, but I canât stand to change this
I guess Iâll remain this, the haunted and wasted
I can't relate to other people,
I can't seem to find some common ground
I can't think straight in public places,
I just keep running my fucking mouth
What if this time is like the last?
Iâm constantly tortured by the past
I have no idea where Iâm fucking going,
I just know that Iâm going no where fast
Faceless, nameless, but I canât stand to change this
I guess Iâll remain this, the haunted and wasted
I donât wanna be faceless
I donât wanna be nameless
I donât wanna be faceless, nameless
But I canât stand to change this
So I guess Iâll remain this
The haunted and wasted
