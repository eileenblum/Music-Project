Lock the door before you leave,
this is just another story that I refuse to recreate
The sound drowning my liver is deafening,
Iâm sick and tired of playing me, playing me
Iâm immortalized in still life and black and white,
Theyâll only know me for violent way I choose die,
Finally my face will never leave the publicâs eye,
Privately and silently my fame comes at a price

Thereâs a glass woman in the basement
with all of my hopes and dreams,
So Iâll drink to the occasion in the fondest loving memory
Iâll be alone in my room with the symphony,
play me off for my final trajectory
Help me
Let me out
