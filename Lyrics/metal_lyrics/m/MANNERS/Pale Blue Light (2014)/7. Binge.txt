Keep your head in the gutter now
Hold your breath as your lungs allow
Ignore the fact your falling down
What time is this were all losing count

Drown yourself in your own shame
Sink or swim its all the same
And you still canât see the fact
No ones buying your fucking act
Drown yourself in your own shame
Sink or swim its all the same

If you disappeared, no one would know, no one would care
Even nowadays when youâre around, itâs like no ones there

The only kind of art that youâve ever made
is the vomit that lines your toilet drain
So keep blacking out day after day,
all that you do will still be clichÃ©d
You may be the owl that sleeps through the day,
but I am the eagle that eats all your prey
