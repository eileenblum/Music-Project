We are swallowed up in the third millenium
Perfect generation of technology and science
Stronger than god omnipotent
We always fight for a just cause
Persuased that our rationality justifies everything
But the man fight always against himself
We are a new hopeful humanity
But in the oblivion of our vanity
We forget that our past is our future

Each war has its history
But men never were able to read it in poet's voices
Too much sincere to be heard
We dominate conceited of our greatness
But our true nature beats...

Venomous roots - that infects
The human beings - beast among beasts
Venomous roots - that infects
The human beings - beast among beasts

We hide bleeding jaws
Behind the weak wall of reason
Terror in big wild eyes
Will reveal the horror
That joins our perverted race
Repudiated sons of a wrong god

We sowed blood and we will pick death
Our death
We left behind us the most enlightened age
But the darkest age too
And now blind we advance toward our Styx
