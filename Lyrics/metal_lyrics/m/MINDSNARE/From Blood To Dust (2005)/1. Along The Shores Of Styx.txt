Entering eternal kingdom of the fallen one
Where time and space collide
Fall into the megatherion, leaving god behind
Divine grace collapsing, Lucifer awaits

Lucifer - king of hell
Summoning the dead
Celebrating the unborn
Satan's spawn

Along the shores of Styx
Choir of the damned blood is
Drunken by the sand
Along the shores of Styx
Infernal torment in the lakes
Of lava blood and pitch
Along the shores of Styx
Black winged demons warriors
Of the apocalypse
Along the shores of Styx
Buried in the depths of Hades
For the eternal centuries

Lucifer - king of hell
Summoning the dead
Celebrating the unborn
Satan's spawn

Blood flows along the shores of Styx
Blood flows along the shores of Styx

Lucifer - king of hell
Summoning the dead
Celebrating the unborn
Satan's spawn
