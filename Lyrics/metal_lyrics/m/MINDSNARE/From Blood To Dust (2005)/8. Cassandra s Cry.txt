I know cause my enemies try to stop my glorious walk
I know cause my enemies throw shit on me when they talk
Good to stab on the back unable to do in my face
Envy of the losers smashed cause unable to become an ace

You are my enemy
I give respect only to my friends
You are my enemy
I give respect only to who's by my side
You are my enemy
I give respect only to my friends
You are my enemy
I give respect only to who's by my side

Born loser you'll die loser I'll piss on your grave
I still got good memory and I know your mistakes

You are my enemy
On the stand on the streets you are on my sight
You are my enemy
You fuckin hatred black and white

Lower down your head, your eyes, you motherfucker, ashamed
You're not worth to speak my name
