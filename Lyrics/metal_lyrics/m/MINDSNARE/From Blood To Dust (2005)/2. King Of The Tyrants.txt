Hail to the king, hail to my light
Conqueror of dark land
Upon you I search for the immortality
Terrible fight in your name
Victory: the only answer

Where are you? Time has stopped
I survive to all that has created me
Sacred civilisation
Holy writings holy scriptures
Force me to live in bestiality
I fall and I rise again
I will seed mud, blood, death
In the name of my honour
Right!

King, king of light, king of hate, king of my life
King of the tyrants, of the tyrants
King, king of light, king of hate, king of my life
King of the tyrants, of the tyrants

King, king of light, king of hate, king of my life
King of the tyrants, of the tyrants
King, king of light, king of hate, king of my life
King of the tyrants, of the tyrants

To be at war is my only creed
We was betrayed by the world
We walk together forward to our freedom
