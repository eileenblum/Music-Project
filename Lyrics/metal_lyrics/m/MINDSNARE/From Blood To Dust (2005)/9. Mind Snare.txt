1989, we were here since the beginning raised in hell, born to dominate
We are the tyrants, messengers of hate stronger than any fate
Bloody ancestry
Honor and glory for the eternity
Noble ancestry
Honor and glory for the eternity

I live by my attitude pride to be envied
I live by my style you can't say me what I must do in my life
Hatred and dangerous stay away from me
Or I'll make you pay

Mind snare - mind snare
Mind snare - mind snare

Mind snare - mind snare
Mind snare - mind snare

Only the strongest survives

Mind snare - mind snare
Mind snare - mind snare
