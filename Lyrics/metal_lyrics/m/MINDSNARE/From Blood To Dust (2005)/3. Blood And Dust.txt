Through your eyes I saw my torturted country
Through your words I heard a changing age
Mouldering convictions as pale bodies putrefied
In trench's mud shipwrecked's anxiety

Exiled from the world you taught me to feel
A cold breath of death always standing by me

Promised land doesn't exist
Ethereal illusions in a desert of death
Promised land doesn't exist
We walked as banished looking for nothing
Word after word breath after breath
You stood by me in a mankind's pilgrimage

Blood and dust
From the endless frost to the endless sands
Only blood and dust will paint the earth
Only blood and dust
From the endless frost to the endless sands
Only blood and dust

Forced to look for something that cannot be found
Between violated ruins
Uprooted and desecrated graves
Disclosed their empty soul
I saw the white skeleton of my civilisation
Lost in a shipwrecked's dream
She has been advancing since years and years
Forever in the same funeral circle

Blood and dust
From the endless frost to the endless sands
Only blood and dust will paint the earth
Only blood and dust
From the endless frost to the endless sands
Only blood and dust

Blood and dust
Blood and dust
