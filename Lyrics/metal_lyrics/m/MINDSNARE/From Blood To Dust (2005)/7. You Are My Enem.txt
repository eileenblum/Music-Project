I should like to shout at the world
I'd like to shout in world's face all horror that
As a crime movie swells in my heart
Meagre images of death and blood
Dreadful painting of smoke and ruins

Which contours so fleeting and uncertain
And they look like a bleak nightmare
No past no present but a transient image
Of a pallide future violently appears to my mind

Two worlds in the same world that as lean wild dogs
Are rivals for the last remnants of civilization
Centuries of history, culture, values and tradition
Threatened by an obscure thought
That smouldered in a silent letargy

But all that is only another unheard Cassandra's cry
But all that is only another unheard Cassandra's cry
Cassandra's cry
Cassandra's cry
But all that is only another unheard Cassandra's cry
But all that is only another unheard Cassandra's cry

All is hatred and anger
To detonate 'em as a nuclear a bomb
All people is afraid to face openly reality
With the absurd childish hope that hiding could help us

Without understand and not understand

That we are sliding inexorably
In a new awful terrifying age
All past terror will be only a pallid reflection
Of what we have to expect
