Redeem yourself
Stop bitchin' 'bout it cuz you'll soon be mine
Subside and say goodbye
Your life's defied
Tonight I'm dressed to kill
My vengeance will now be defined

(I'm shouting out in despair)
'Cause I'm losing my self-control
I'm hurting you and hearing you screeching
(I'm tortured by)
Another memory infecting the core of my soul
It's all getting harder for me

Now it's too late
I've chased relief for far too long
Now it's too late for me to go on
Go

Hey, you cant blame the desolation you inflicted on yourself
This ain't a game for me; a bloodshed awaits
The phony brute who betrayed
Modern Judas come 'n face your fate

(I'm shouting out in despair)
'Cause I'm losing my self-control
I'm hurting you and hearing you screeching
(I'm tortured by)
Another memory infecting the core of my soul
It's all getting harder for me

Now it's too late
I've chased relief for far too long
Now it's too late for me to go on

Now it's too late
I've chased relief for far too long
Now it's too late for me to go on
Go
