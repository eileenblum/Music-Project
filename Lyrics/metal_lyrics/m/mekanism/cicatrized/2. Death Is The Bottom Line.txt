You spin your web of smiles and lies upon your prey
Gleefully greet them with a blade as they look away
A cynical masquerade perverting every day
You're a slithering fucking snake hissing away
With a tongue of hate

Breeding hidden pain
Never leave a stain
Singing voices bring the silent death rain
Cultivate your lies in savior's disguise
What the market sells the grazing herd buys

Behind the gold and the wine
Death is the bottom line
Despair now, you've sold yourself
And your death is the bottom line

(and you'll choke)

For just a little more you'll surely save the world
For your halo on the news you're an angel
For a nickel and a dime you will slit my throat
Just for you the children suffer, bleed and burn

Breeding hidden pain
Never leave a stain
Singing voices bring the silent death rain
Cultivate your lies in savior's disguise
What the market sells the grazing herd buys

Behind the gold and the wine
Death is the bottom line
Despair now, you've sold yourself
And your death is the bottom line

The black heart beats blood on you and I
Repent; the bodies burning
They are a silent reaper

Behind the gold and the wine
Death is the bottom line
Despair now, you've sold yourself
And your death is the bottom line
