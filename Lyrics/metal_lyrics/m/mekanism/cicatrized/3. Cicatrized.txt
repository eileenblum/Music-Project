Break me and you'll save me
I see myself now and surrender
Break me and you'll save me
It's not easy to pretend (Something you're not)

You don't have a clue of how I've psyched out myself
Can't comprehend or untwine my faulty wirings
The horror-struck person's intimidation be felt
Only fear won't be the one subsiding

See the face of the enemy
In the end realize the futility
For the wicked beast lies within you

Still I try to believe that it would not take over me

Break me and you'll save me
I see myself now and surrender
Break me and you'll save me
It's not easy to pretend (Something you're not)

Confined inside life, nothing is meaningful
I've tried and tried yet I'm all but possessed
The sound of madness I hear is subliminal
Time and again I pray all will end

See the face of the enemy
In the end realize the futility
For the wicked beast lies within you

Still I try to believe that it would not take over me

Break me and you'll save me
I see myself now and surrender
Break me and you'll save me
It's not easy to pretend
