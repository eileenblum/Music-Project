In my eyes there is no other  
You are perfect as open'd veins  
In my eyes I see no other  
You inspire the ugliest things  

Lift me with your lifeless form            
Drag me through Love's excrement  
Caress me with cruell claws  
Bless my pen with dreams and lies  
Let me hold you in my sleep  
Let me wake and damn this art           

Ev'ry word bleeds from me  
Just like a thousand wars  
They aren't all beautifull  

See through my eyes, poetry  
Gouge my eyes with thorns          
Breathe through my lungs, softly 
I will breathe sea-water soon  

Creation isn't beautifull  
You inspire the ugliest things
