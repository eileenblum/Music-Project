Here am I, red and sour. Mine eye smiling to thy side!  
He lives in a river  
From Carina's door  
Washing out the devourer  
Of dying acres  
Maybe salvation deserves this?  
All in my hand overcame me.  
Eyes on you, I drowned in yours, and then  
My house forsook me.  
Lithely trickling away, my name from thee  
In a slumber-call...  
Hast thou dreamt my name?  
Haste, my weight is hollow.  
Speak, and it saves me.  
Haste, speak, trust me.  
Atop a hill, a marvelous night's  
Lustrous vistas mark the year,  
Creeping across the barony.  
Phantoms flicker with a licking breeze,  
Admonishing thee of wicked pleasure.  
I scheme to renounce my treasure  
With a furtive smile, silence  
But tears, they stream for thee  
Thou! Lusting a dungeon  
This land is like... a goblet of the thick  
And black!  
Brim-filled before the moon-crest  
I'm pondering a wall  
And poised with knives  
And then, I look at you  
(Secretly, of course)
