The waves speak quietly to me  
When the tempest sleeps deep beneath.  
I wish that I could give to you  
The sun before it weds the west.  
My tears mingle soft with the sea  
Though I dream that you could taste them.  
Lay with me our bridal bed  
Dance a moonlit path thereon  
Lay with me above the dead  
That drift with tides kiss upon.  
My undine beauty, thou hast seen  
The coral kingdoms, silence, peace  
The moon and stars I would forsake  
To gaze into thy starry eyes  
The azure sky seems not so deep  
As azure oceans, amidst sleep.
