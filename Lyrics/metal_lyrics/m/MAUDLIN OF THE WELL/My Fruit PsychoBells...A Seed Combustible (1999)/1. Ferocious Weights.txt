NEVER once he knew what war  
I keep the hour vicious  
Used my body to fatten his voice  
Our eyes weakened under drippings  
Look to the south for your muse, she's there  
Eggs in five palaces looming  
Embrace her, replace her heart  
Kiss her, change your life  
Kiss her. change your life  
Such a bleak desire   
To have you with me when I die  
In hymnance of my leaden veins   
I smell your blood each night
