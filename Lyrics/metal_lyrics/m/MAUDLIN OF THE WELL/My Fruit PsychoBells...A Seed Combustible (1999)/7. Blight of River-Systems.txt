Snow, and drugs  
That make every visage angelic!  
Then came my secret dream of the girl  
My warrior with a foot like a doe  
Walking for inspiration,  
I learned which of you is the One.  
Kissing, but not moving  
Loving, unmoving  
But this is said in a coquettish trance  
Dampens my book, thoughts come quick  
I almost love you,  
But I kiss you the way I kiss Maria  
And she, with a foot like a doe!  
I was swept away  
When the choirs in your shiny eyes cast  
Little drops of water on everything  
O, Slayer of trickery!  
My shoulders hold more than a swarm of devils!.  
Whence came the Blight of the churning rivers?  
You spoke like a dragon  
My queen, my angel  
Scion of anguish, I cherish your anguish  
This is a promise and you are a dove  
I quit this grief with obsequies  
Snowfall beautifies humanity  
But charm is lost with enhanced design  
Bind my lips with the purest vine!
