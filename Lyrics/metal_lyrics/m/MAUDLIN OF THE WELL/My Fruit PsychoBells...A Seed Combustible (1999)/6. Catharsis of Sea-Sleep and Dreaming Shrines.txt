In my dreams I see no nearer god.  
The waves that move,  
They pierce my drifting soul.  
With want I reach in vain to grasp the sun  
As off it falls beneath the dancing fields  
And paints fore'er this spout-girt majesty!  
O, slimy things!  
I yearn to hear you sing from depths as deep as stars doth shine  
From realms of light above.  
I wish to hear thee sing!  
O, ammonite with aeon-closed eye!  
Speak to me in water-tongues  
And grant to me the eyesight you once saw  
The Sea-gods with!  
My voyage as above, so below  
Upon a dreaming ship I sail  
Upon my life I conjure they whom no dry eyes have seen  
Since sleep hath stolen over forms and sunken temples built  
By gods themselves!  
Alone I embark for cities immersed  
In depths of thought and caverns full of dreams!  
What corals dress this city fallen?  
What the magick language lost one-thousand leagues?  
Nightmare! Come, and speak to me  
From beneath the waves that rock young ships  
To slumber sweet  
Gods, caress me with thy chthonic hands  
Steep my mind with the beauty of a vision-world  
And bury me in temples where my soul  
Can e'er explore these realms of madness submerged!
