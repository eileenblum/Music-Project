Each bulb about me blooms  
Gives its own luminescence  
Like some phantom lantern glare  
There is nothing in this place but rainfall  
Forlorn, dreary secret ghosts  
That hide between the twilit trees          
Doth gaze upon the spores that gleam  
They only know the floral dream  

By the shade of wither'd day  
How the moonbeams dance and waver  
Splendid through the pallid air      
The poison mists doth flow and gather  
Burst from ev'ry season'd flow'ret  
Like mimosas of the night  
Fleeth garden charms that sparkle  
Like a shattered lantern's light          

I breathe the vapours that surround  
Like so many seedling faeries  
Rose, and thistle  
And berry red  
That preside over the dead       
Tell me what they've seen and said:  

"Breathe no more  
Thy ghost dost wait  
To take thy place  
At Garden's Gate         
Poison, venom,  
Toxic fume hast ensured  
Thy witless doom!"
