"Let this cup of suffering pass from me
Every tear shall be kiss'd from thine eyes."  

[DAIMON:]
"There is suffering in the Out Of Space  
The jewelled lamps of Heaven are unknown."  

"Ere you fall, I shall be there to lift thee  
Rest thy weary mind, warm thy bleary cheek!"  

[DAIMON:]
"Naught but purity and secrecy abound  
Under the surface of glassy Spheres."

"Hark and remember my creative song  
Believe in me and thy heart shall grow light  
Enter the tomb beneath my sacred blooms  
Remain: I promise I shall thee receive?"  

[DAIMON:]
"Lest magick doors thou shall ope in the stars,  
In the seas, in the gardens of pure Thought."  

"Nearest to thy soul is my whisp'ring Voice."  

[DAIMON:]
"Ever else are the unseen Paths and Planes."
