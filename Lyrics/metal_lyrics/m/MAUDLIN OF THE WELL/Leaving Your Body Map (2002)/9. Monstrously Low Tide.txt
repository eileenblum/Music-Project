What upon the naked shore is this key?  
All briny, yes, a haven for the briny things,  
And a mystery to the sun which hasn't seen  
The construction of this awful mystery!  

What fashion'd thee, O key of slimy gold?        
What secret portal among the waves and stones  
Didst thou unlock in silence of the deep?  
And most importantly, what sea-borne lazy eye,  
Deceived by the broken light,  
Lost among the ruins thee?         

I saw the shore expand on that joyous day-  
Breathed deeper, pulsed longer, sighed fuller,  
Loved greater the mind of a curious boy,  
Such as me!  

I love thee, curious sea!         
{Aeons can hide the relics of forgotten gods,  
But showeth me thy treasures,}  
And I will always look thereon.  
I will always look with love thereon!
