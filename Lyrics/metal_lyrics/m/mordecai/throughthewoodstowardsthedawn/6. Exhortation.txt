[Psalm 148]

Praise ye the Lord from the heavens
praise Him in the heights
Praise ye Him all His angels
praise ye Him all His hosts.
Praise ye Him sun and moon

Praise Him, all ye stars of light,
Praise Him ye heavens of heavens,
and ye waters that be above the heavens.

Let them praise the name of the Lord,
for He commanded and they were created,
He hath also stablished them for ever and ever,
He hath made a degree which shall not pass,
Praise the Lord from the earth,
ye dragons, and all deeps

Fire and hail snow and vapour stormy wind fulfilling His word,

Mountains and all hills fruitful trees
and all cedars beasts and cattle,
creeping things and flying fowl,
kings of the earth and all people,
Praise ye the Lord

Let them praise the name of the Lord,
for His name alone is excellent,
His glory is above the earth and heaven,

He also exalteth the horn of His people,
to be praised by all His saints,
Praise ye the Lord.
