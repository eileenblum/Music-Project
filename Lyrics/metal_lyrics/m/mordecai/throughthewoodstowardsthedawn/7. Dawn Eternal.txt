Wake for the Coming,
Moon turned scarlet,
see the horror in sinful eyes,
The Dawn will rise,
Signs of the end will lead to that day,
The end of our wandering it will be,
The Dawn Eternal rises,
our Saviour will return,
everlasting joy will begin,
Through the infinity,
beyond the stars,
beyond this time,
to Heaven we'll fly,
The ones filled with hate and sin,
realise the eternal grief,
Time is up,
Dawn has risen,
The Grace,
The Son,
We are immortal by the sacrifice on the Skull,
Give yourself to CHRIST,
Now, When the time still exists,
'Before Dawn Eternal
