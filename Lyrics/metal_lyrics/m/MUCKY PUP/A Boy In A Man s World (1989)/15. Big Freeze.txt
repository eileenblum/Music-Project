Do you know hurt?
Really know
'Cause I see him when I wake
And he's waiting there for me
Crushing down, I'm freezing
Deeper in a hole everyday
'Cause the mountain's just too big
Through and through it's loud and hard
Through and through
Take no days off and no holidays
I've done my all
And come up against my final last wall
Can't you see in these eyes?
From the long long long winter
Of the big freeze
You felt it
Tell me you felt it
Tell me I'm not alone, please
Please I'm not alone
'Cause it's the big freeze
A different kind of cold
'Cause it's the big freeze
A different kind of cold


Thanks to sodoperfido for sending track #2 lyrics.
