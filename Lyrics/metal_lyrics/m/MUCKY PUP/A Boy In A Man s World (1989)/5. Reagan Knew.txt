Why don't you stop  lying
And just tell us the truth
Why don't you stop  lying
And just tell us the truth
Why don't you stop  lying
And just tell us the truth
Why don't you stop  lying
And just tell us the truth

Reagan knew, Reagan knew
Ron told North just what to do
Our government lied
To hide the truth
Ron told Ollie
Well, shred the proof
Oliver North was set up
And all of Congress knew it
Yeah, Ollie North was set up
And guess who made him do it
Mr. President I know you knew
Do you think I'm as dumb as you
A word to the wise
Oh, what should we do
Take that shredder and
Throw Ronnie's ass through

Why don't you stop  lying
And just tell us the truth
Why don't you stop  lying
And just tell us the truth
Why don't you stop  lying
And just tell us the truth
Why don't you stop  lying
And just tell us the truth
