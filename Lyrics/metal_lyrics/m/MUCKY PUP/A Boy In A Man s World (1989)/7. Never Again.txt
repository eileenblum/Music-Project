I'm closing up shop
This is my shop
And I'm locking my doors
They're my doors
Won't let you inside
On my side
I'm locking my doors
Once more

Never again will this happen to me
Never again I won't let it
Never again will this happen to me
Never again I won't let it

I'm closing up shop
This is my shop
And I'm locking my doors
They're my doors
Won't let you inside
On my side
I'm locking my doors
Once more

Never again will this happen to me
Never again I won't let it
Never again will this happen to me
Never again I won't let it

I'm closing up shop
And locking my doors
Won't let you inside no more
'Cause never again
Will this happen to me
Never again I won't let it

I'm closing up shop
This is my shop
And I'm locking my doors
They're my doors
Won't let you inside
On my side
I'm locking my doors
Once more
