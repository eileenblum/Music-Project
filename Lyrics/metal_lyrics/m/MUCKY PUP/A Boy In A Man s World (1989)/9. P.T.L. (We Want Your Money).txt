I know there's people out there
And things just keep looking
Worse and worse for you
One step up
And three steps back
You're in a dead end
With no reverse

Well I'm here to tell you there's
Help, hope and happiness on the way
And we ask nothing of you
Well almost

We want your money, money, money
Money, money, money, money,money
Money, money, money, money,money
We want your money, money, money
Money, money, money, money,money
Money, money, money, money,money
We want your money, money, money
Money, money, money, money,money
Money, money, money, money,money
We want your money, money, money
Money, money, money, money,money
Money, money, money, money,money
We want it
We need it
We got it
We seen it

My dog needs a new dog house
Tammy's a firm believer in lucatism
No substitutions
Only your contributions

We want your money, money, money
Money, money, money, money,money
Money, money, money, money,money
We want your money, money, money
Money, money, money, money,money
Money, money, money, money,money
We want your money, money, money
Money, money, money, money,money
Money, money, money, money,money
We want your money, money, money
Money, money, money, money,money
Money, money, money, money,money

I've sinned against you my wife
I've sinned against you my lord
But more importantly
Where are my cue cards

Economic suicide
Well hell, if this is Christianity
I feel bad for God
Engulfing up our nation's pride
I guess they're just too dumb to realize
They want your money
If this is so called loyalty
I guess you're just as lame as they
But not me, not me, no not me
