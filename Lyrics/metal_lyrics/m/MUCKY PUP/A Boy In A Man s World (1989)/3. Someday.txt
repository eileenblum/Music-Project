Get out of the way you lazy bum
I've got work to do
It's six o'clock get up we're late
I'll slam you in the head
You do that again

Someday, all of this will be yours
Someday, all of this will be yours

I've busted my ass for 20 years
And this is the thanks that I get?
Club Med twice a year, a condo a new car

Someday, all of this will be yours
Someday, all of this will be yours

Get out of the way you lazy bum
I've got work to do
It's six o'clock get up we're late
I'll slam you in the head
You do that again

Someday, all of this will be yours
Someday, all of this will be yours
Someday, all of this will be yours
Someday, all of this will be yours
Someday
