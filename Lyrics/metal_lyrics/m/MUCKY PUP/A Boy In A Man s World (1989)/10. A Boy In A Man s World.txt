Could you
You could never
Stop this world turning for the better
And can't you
Can't you see
That this world is run on tricks
Help up a sleeve

Could you
I say, could you see
Yourself going to war
In world war three

Just a boy, I'm not a man
I'm just a boy in a man's world

Would you
Would you believe
When the government says
Hey boy it's time to leave
Why can't you wake up today
And see there's nothing fun
About these games they play

Could you
I say, could you see
Yourself going to war
In world war three

Just a boy, I'm not a man
I'm just a boy in a man's world

Slow down
It's a nuclear meltdown
Just a boy, I'm not a man
I'm just a boy in a man's world
