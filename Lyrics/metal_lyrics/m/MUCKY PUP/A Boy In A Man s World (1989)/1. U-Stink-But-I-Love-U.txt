I hate the way you act
And I hate the way you smell
I hate the way you look girl
'Cause you just look like hell

You make me sick, way-o, way-o
You make me sick
You really stink girl
You make me sick, way-o, way-o
You make me sick
But I love you

I hate your polyester pant suits
And your greasy hair
And that stuff between your braces
And your hairy derriere

You make me sick, way-o, way-o
You make me sick
You really stink girl
You make me sick, way-o, way-o
You make me sick
But I love you

When I got you in my back seat
And I tried to make my move
I had to roll down all the windows
To keep my face from turning blue

You make me sick, way-o, way-o
You make me sick
You really stink girl
You make me sick, way-o, way-o
You make me sick
But I love you
