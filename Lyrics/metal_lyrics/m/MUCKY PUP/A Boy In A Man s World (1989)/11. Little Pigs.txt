In the beginning there was wolf
Then there was pig
Wolf was the natural enemy of pig
And this was good
And so our story begins

Little pigs, little pigs, let me in
Not by the hair of our chinny chin chin
Then I'll huff, and I'll puff
And I'll blow your house in

I am the big bad wolf
And there will be no badder
All the pigs is doing
Is just making me madder
Some A1 steak sauce
And some Saucy Susan
Will make them know the reason
They're losing their lives

Little pigs, little pigs, let me in
Not by the hair of our chinny chin chin
Then I'll huff, and I'll puff
And I'll blow your house in

Huffin' and puffin' and puffin' and huffin'
Huffin' keeps me thinkin' 'bout
Stove Top Stuffin'
I could wait for months
And I could wait for years
I could see myself chewin'
On those little pink ears

Little pigs, little pigs, let me in
Not by the hair of our chinny chin chin
Then I'll huff, and I'll puff
And I'll blow your house in
