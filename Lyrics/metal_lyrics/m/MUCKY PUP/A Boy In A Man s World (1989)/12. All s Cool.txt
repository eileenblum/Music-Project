How can you be
Cryin' all the time
When you know
Things ain't so bad
Where we've not gone and
Where we've not been
Makin' it baby ain't judged
By the car you're in

All is cool on the western front
All is cool on the western front

Don't ever say you want
You never ever want
Don't ever say you want
To be open with me
You say you want to see
You're never gonna see
Until you close your eyes
And listen with me

All is cool on the western front
All is cool on the western front
