[Lyrics &amp; Music: D. Nastasi]

If Jimmys was alive today - we would,
walk the talk of the American poet,
realize, the sense of their words as they wrote 'em,
their peoples are gone,
all's that's left is their name,
without them this wouldn't have been the same,
live they do,
alive they're not,
go ahead Dan,
make that guitar talk.
