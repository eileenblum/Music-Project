[Lyrics &amp; Music: D. Nastasi]

I'm just a man, Dan's got a future,
with a fast picking hand,
but my brother,
my brother, like my mother,
they're living back,
in the dead head fad,
well don't be sad,
they may be upgly,
but they're not that bad,
their only faulter is that they hate water,
and water is something you gotta have,
hippies hate water,
one day I found,
myself driving, myself around,
and the I saw 'em,
like a herd sheep callin',
"Gimme a ride to the Dead show man",
well don't be sad,
they may be smelly,
but they're not that bad,
their only faulter is that they hate water,
and water is something you gotta have,
hippies hate water.
