[Lyrics: B. Milnes, Music: C. Milnes]

Went walkin' with devil,
walkin' in his shoes,
went walkin' with the devil,
thought I had nothing to lose,
everytime I'm in his fire,
he's got something to say to me,
everytime that I'm on the ground,
they got something to say to me,
everytime that I make a sound,
put me down,
put me down on my knees.
