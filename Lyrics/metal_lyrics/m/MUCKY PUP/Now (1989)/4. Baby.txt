[Lyrics &amp; Music: C. Milnes]

Well I'm big, and I'm loud,
and I'm happy to be around,
and maybe, cause I'm the baby,
it's my destiny,
try to rock me or try to knock me but never try to clock me,
you've been told and you've been sold,
I'll tell you again as fast as I can,
stay with me, lay with me, but don't play with me Baby.
