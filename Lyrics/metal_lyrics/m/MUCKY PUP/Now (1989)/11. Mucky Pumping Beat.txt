[Lyrics D. Nastasi, Music: Mucky Pup]

Pick up your feet and drag your ass up to see
what is done by the boys and me,
fuckin' Mucky pumpin' beat,
your hands, your feet,
your butt, pumpin' down on my meat - my beat,
well I know nothing of how to dance,
but my main man Booge says,
"Do what you can",
belive me folks,
you must have trust,
3-2-1 bust.
