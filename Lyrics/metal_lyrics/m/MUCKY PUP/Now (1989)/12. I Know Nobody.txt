[Lyrics: D. Nastasi, Music: C. Milnes]

I hate everybody,
so who the fuck are you,
I love everybody,
there fella I'm talking to you,
there's no insides to me,
what you get is what you see,
just when you thought you were it,
you had to open your eyes and see nothing but shit,
I know nobody knows nobody.
