[Lyrics: Corey D. Marchasin, Music: C. Milnes]

Three dead gophers all named Harvey,
sitting around drinking,
all at a party,
if they weren't dead their party'd be hardy,
there ain't too much to do with three dead gopher bodies,
three dead gophers the furry little beasts,
three dead gophers too bad they're deceased,
three dead gophers all named Harvey,
three dead gophers - not the life of this party,
my heart and soul in their little hole,
I loved them till the end - They were my furry friends.
