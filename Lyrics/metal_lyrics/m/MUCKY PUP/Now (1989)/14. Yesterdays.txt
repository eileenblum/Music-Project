[Lyrics &amp; Music: D. Nastasi]

Woke up one day forgot about my yesterdays,
can't blame my second try,
I swore I'd hold it 'till the day I die,
woke up the nex day feeling just the same as yesterday,
sometimes I wonder why?
was God on my side or by my side,
I can smile and say,
that my way was my way,
yesterday,
somehow someway my life became to take a new shape,
whe I stop to look at why,
I came to reason yesterday,
so now my today's are just as other days,
but what good are your todays without yesterdays.
