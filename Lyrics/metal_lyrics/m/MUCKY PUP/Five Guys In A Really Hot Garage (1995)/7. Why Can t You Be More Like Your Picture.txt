your picture is so sweet, your picture never lies
a picture never cheats, and you can't look me in the eyes

why can't you be more like your picture?
why can't you be why can't you be more
why can't you be more like your picture?
why can't you be why can't you be more

your picture likes my friends, your picture always smiles
a picture don't pretend, everything is going fine
