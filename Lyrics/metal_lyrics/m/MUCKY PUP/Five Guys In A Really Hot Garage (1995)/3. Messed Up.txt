i got a messed up face, and a messed up head
my life's been so messed up, i got messed up friends

my childhood was messed up, my high school was messed up
my first job was messed up, and my girlfriend was you know

i've gone out of my mind

it's so messed up, that we're both messed up
it's so messed up, that we're both messed up

got messed up hair, and got messed up shoes
i don't even care, i was frickin born to frickin lose
