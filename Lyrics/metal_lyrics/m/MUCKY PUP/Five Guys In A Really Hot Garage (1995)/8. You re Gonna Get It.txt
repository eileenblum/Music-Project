forget my name and number, forget the spell I'm under
hit me, hurt me, love me, burn me
cause you, were, the one, for me

you pick me up, you tie me down
you run me round, round, you're gonna get it!

you pick me up, you tie me down
you run me round, round, you're gonna get it!

you're gonna get it! you're gonna get it!
you're gonna get it! you're gonna get yours

forget my face and address, forget this place mrs. clueless
hit me, hurt me, love me, burn me,
cause you, were, the one, for me
