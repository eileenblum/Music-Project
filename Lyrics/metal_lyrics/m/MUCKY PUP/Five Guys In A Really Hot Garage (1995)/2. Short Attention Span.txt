i got a short attention span, cause i am an american
must be something in the air, fast food, t.v., i don't care

home of the big cars, home of the soft minds
just the thing, that i despise
the kids can't read, and the kids can't spell
i'm telling you mom, this place is going to hell

america is the, drive-thru nation
everybody's got their own, television station

i come from the, velvetta generation
keep it simple, cause i can't deal with complication

wow - growin' up american
yea - we're growin' up american
wow - growin' up american
yea - that's grown' up american
