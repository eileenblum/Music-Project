i knew i shouldn't have, opened my mouth
last night on stage, now i'm sitting here
in the pittsburg pa., county jail

they took me off of the stage last night
and laughed at me in handcuffs
they took the money i made last night
and laughed at me in handcuffs

hey mom, hey mom, a hey mom
hey mom i'm in jail
hey mom, hey mom, a hey mom
hey mom i'm really in jail
