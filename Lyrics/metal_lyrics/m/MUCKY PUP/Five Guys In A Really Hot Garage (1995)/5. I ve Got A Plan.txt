i heard it as a kid, and i'm so sick of it
your such a teddybear, your such a teddybear

you heard it yesterday, but i'll tell it anyway
the sad sad story, a sad sad story

i have a plan, i have a plan
i have a plan of how it's gonna happen
i have a plan we're gonna make it happen

we're gonna make a band, a cool cool band
we're gonna write a song, a cool cool song
were gonna play a show, a cool cool show
we're gonna make a record, the way cool record
