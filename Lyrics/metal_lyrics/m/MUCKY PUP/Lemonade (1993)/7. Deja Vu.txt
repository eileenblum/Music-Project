THE SAFEST THING THAT HE CAN DO IS
TO WRITE A SONG THAT HE THINKS IS NEW
AND THE ONLY SOUND THAT HE CAN HEAR IS
A FIRE BURNING, BURNING IN HIS EARS

THE SAFEST THING THAT HE CAN DO IS
ANALYZE THE THINGS SHE'D DO
AND THE ONLY SOUND THAT HE CAN HEAR
A BROKEN HEART, POUNDING IN HIS EARS

ON THE NIGHT SHE LEFT, COUNTRY MUSIC MADE SENSE
IT'S LIKE DEJA VU, ALL OVER AGAIN

I REPEAT MYSELF WHEN UNDER STRESS
