MY WARFARE IS MENTAL, I DO MORE DAMAGE WITH A PENCIL
MAKING DOLLARS LEGAL LIKE DADDY DID, COMPREND AMIGO?

IF WISHES WERE FISHES, WE'D ALL CAST NETS
IF MONEY WERE HONEY, WE'D ALL BE STUNG
IF GREED WERE A NEED, WE'D ALL BE CRUSHED
IF FAME WERE AN AIM, WERE SET TO LOSE

SCHEMING AND DREAMING, BACK IN TOWN NEW DISK IS BEAMING
RHYMING AND STEALING BEATS, TAKING THE HEAT
I CARRY NO WEAPON JUST SAID SON, I PACK NO GUN
THERE IS NO CHALLENGE HAVE NO EQUAL
SO MANY STORIES YOU GOTTA MAKE A SEQUEL

THIS IS THE END MY FRIEND
THIS IS MY FRIEND THE END
