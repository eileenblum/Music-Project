MONEY'S OVERRATED  AND I JUDGE MY WEALTH
BY THE FRIENDS THAT I HAVE
MAN CANNOT LIVE BY LOVE ALONE I KNOW
BUT WITHOUT IT, IT ALL MEANS NOTHING

THE DOLLARS THAT I HOLD ARE INCIDENTAL TO
MY FAMILY, THEY ARE ESSENTIAL
I HAVE A TV. AND A STEREO I KNOW
BUT I DON'T NEED'EM AND I'LL LIVE WITHOUT'EM

THIS IS WHERE THE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE LIVE
IN THAT MOST SPECIAL MOMENT

THE THINGS THAT WE SEE EVERYDAY ON THE NEWS
ARE ONLY SYMPTOMS TO THE REAL PROBLEM
AND SHAME ON THE PARENTS OF THE PEOPLE WHO
WEREN'T TAUGHT HOW TO LEARN, HOW TO LOVE

WITHOUT A STRONG FOUNDATION THIS HOUSE IS BOUND
TO CRUMBLE DOWN YOU SEE THE PARALLEL
ON OUR WAY TO A BETTER DAY AND I'VE GOT'S TO SAY
THE CHILDREN ARE OUR FUTURE.

YOU GIVE LOVE AND YOU GET LOVE
