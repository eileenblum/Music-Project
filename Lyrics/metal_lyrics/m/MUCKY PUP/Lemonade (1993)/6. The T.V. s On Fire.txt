IT'S FUNNY THAT, YOU SAID THAT
NOT HA-HA FUNNY, BUT PECULIAR FUNNY
USUALLY WHEN A STRANGER APPROACHES
A RESPONSE ISN'T READY TO THE T.V.'s ON FIRE

HE'S WAITING FOR, AN ANSWER, A KNOWING SHRUG
OR MAYBE A GRUNT.  SO I GO YEA AND HE GOES YEA
WE BOTH GO YEA
THE  PRESSURE IS OVER, YEA THE PRESSURE IS OVER
THE PRESSURE IS OVER

THERE WAS AN OBSERVER, TO THE LEFT AND BEHIND
SHE GAVE ME THE EYE, SHE SAW THE WHOLE DEAL
AND SAID YOU LOOK LIKE THE SKY

YOU LOOK LIKE THE SKY
THE PRESSURE IS OVER
THE T.V.'s ON FIRE
