THERE'S TWO LITTLE MEN, WHO ARE FIGHTING A WAR
THEY CAN'T STOP IT NOW, IT'S BEEN TEN YEARS MAYBE MORE
ONE IS SMALL AND DEVIOUS, WITH HURT ON HIS MIND
THE OTHER BIG AND STRONG, WITH PRIDE ON HIS SIDE

ONE PLAYS DIRTY, HE'LL DO ANYTHING TO WIN
THE OTHER FENDS OFF THE ATTACKS, AGAIN AND AGAIN
THE BATTLEGROUNDS ARE  SCARRED, TORN TO PIECES
 RIPPED TO SHREDS
NEITHER CAN CLAIM VICTORY, TILL THE OTHER ONE IS DEAD

THERE'S TWO LITTLE MEN, WHO ARE KILLING A BOY
THEY'RE TREATING THE BOY, AS IF THE BOY WERE A TOY
EACH ONE HAS AN EAR, TO HAVE AND TO HOLD
THEIR GRIP IS TOO TIGHT, THEIR GRIP IS SO COLD

TWO LITTLE MEN -  ONE BIG AND ONE SMALL
TWO LITTLE MEN -  IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR
TWO LITTLE MEN -  AND I CAN'T SEE YOU
TWO LITTLE MEN -  I'M USING AS A METAPHOR
