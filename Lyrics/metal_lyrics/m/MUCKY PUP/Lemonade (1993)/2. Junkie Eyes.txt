BLACK LIKE THE BEST, HORROR MOVIE ALLEYWAY
DARK AND SHINY, LIKE THE WET TAR,
ON A SIDE STREET PARKING LOT

FULL OF HOPE, LIKE A DOG IN THE POUND
BUT TRULY HOPELESS, CAUSE I WON'T HELP

I DON'T CRY FOR THEM, BUT I DO CRY
FOR THE PEOPLE THEY WERE, IN A TIME BEFORE

I CAN'T BABY-SIT THE WORLD, ALTHOUGH I'D LIKE TO
A HARSH REALITY THAT HURTS ME MORE EVERY TIME

I'M SORRY

THERE'S DEAD FLOWERS ON THE TABLE
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A JUNKIES EYES
WHEN THERE'S DEAD FLOWERS ON THE TABLE
