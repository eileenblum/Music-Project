I- YOU WANT- YOU WANT TO SEE HOSTILE
I- YOU WALK- YOU WALK WHERE I WALK
I- YOU LIVE- YOU LIVE WHERE I LIVE
I- YOU SEE- YOU SEE WHAT I SEE CLEARLY

LET'S TALK ABOUT REAL, LET'S TALK ABOUT RAGE
AND WHEN YOU FAKE THIS SHIT, WELL I CAN"T STOMACH IT

I'M EMBARRASSED FOR YOU WHEN I HEAR IT, I SEE IT
A THING CALLED HONESTY OWN UP FOR WHAT YOU SAY

HOW DO YOU LIVE WITH YOU
