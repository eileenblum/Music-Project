YOU MADE ME NERVOUS, A PRINCE IN A SHALLOW GRAVE
ONLY A FEW, EVER REALLY HAD A CLUE, THIS WORLD IS EMPTY
AND A BORING PLACE WITHOUT YOU

I CAN SEE NOW, SEE WHERE I WAS BLIND
AND I'M SORRY, SORRY FOR THE THINGS I'VE DONE
BUT I WAS TOO YOUNG, AND I WAS TOO YOUNG TO KNOW
HOW TO BE STRONG

CONFESSIONS - OF A BOYS REPRESSION'S
