I WANT, WHAT HE'S GOT, YEA I WANT IT, BUT HE KNOWS IT
REHEARSED, CONVERSATIONS,
JUST TO SEE, EACH OTHERS FACES

THE THINGS I WANT FROM HER,
ARE THE THINGS I GOT FROM YOU

NERVOUS HANDSHAKES, AND MISSED KISSES,
JUST LEFT OF, LEFT OF THE LIPS
HE'S SMILING, CAUSE HE KNOWS,
HE KNOWS, I'M LEAVING THIS EVENING

SHE'S ALWAYS LOOKED GREAT BUT TASTED BETTER.
TONIGHT SHE WORE THE SAME BRA SHE WORE THEN.
I SAW IT SLIP, SLIP OUT OF ALIGNMENT
WITH THE SHOULDER STRAP OF HER SHIRT.
DID SHE UNCONSCIOUSLY LET IT FALL
TO MAKE ME REMEMBER?  OR DID SHE CONSCIOUSLY
LET ME SEE KNOWING IT WOULD BRING ME TO MY KNEES

WHY DO YOU KISS, SO GOOD  SHE ASKED,
ASKED ME TO STOP, STOP FOR A MOMENT
IT'S THE KISS, THAT SONGS, ARE WRITTEN, WRITTEN ABOUT
