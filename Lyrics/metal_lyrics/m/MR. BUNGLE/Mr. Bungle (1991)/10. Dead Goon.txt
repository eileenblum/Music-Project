Nobler than OedipusClairvoyant and toothlessForeplay with no friendsPremature until the end I've got a secretBabbling senselessNo one will ever know Kids can be so cruelSmash the feelingSuckle the sugar breast Too happy - a jerk beyond a smileAn asphyxiophileI'm the Humper; stop hitting meWalking the plank, swallowing dirt Johnny - just skin and juice and hairA hero unawareTied in a knot beneath gigglingMy own two hands tickling me Innocent frictionBoys and girls are stealing my oxygenSex? There's no such thingAll that's left is laughing, choking, laughing Playing solitaireA rope and mommy's underwearHanging on, letting goDangling to and fro NOOO It can't happen here Floating awayTinglingFluid seepingFamily weepingIt feels so goodSo badBut pleaseDon't tease me

The song "Quote Unquote" was originally named "Travolta", which is the last name
of actor John Travolta and printed on the first few copies of the CD.  However,
Warner Brother records persuaded Mr. Bungle to change the name of the song to
avoid lawsuits from the actor when he threatened to sue.

A music video was also made for "Quote Unquote", which was predominately banned
by many networks for it's "creepy" content.
