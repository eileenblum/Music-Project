ImpotenceBoomerangI'll stab you Clumps of hairIn the sinkWho's hidingThings from me? You knew all along, goddammitBut you wouldn't tell meWell, look at you now It's not funny, my ass is on fireParaplegic, inhuman liar Carve a smileOn your faceEverything's greatSuffocate It's beyond my control...I'm coming! BooRedundantBoring
