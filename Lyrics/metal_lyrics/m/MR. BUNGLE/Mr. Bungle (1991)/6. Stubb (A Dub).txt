Do you rememberWe called you puppy?Now you're one of usWe call you family Family... Treading underfoot and stinking assHold the door aside and let her pass Glaucoma Reflections of a bloated lieA life stored in your cloudy eyeNow it's time to say goodbyeStubb a Dub will never die Chase a tail that isn't thereIt's time to wipe your buttSliding down butt hill Dahg Rastubfari - do you knowThat you're a fucking dog?If you can hear me, then throw upGive me a signAnd I'll throw a stick, bring it backRoll over and dieYou taught me a lesson - thanks mom! Do you understand me Do you think about me when you're peeing?Do you really think you're gonna growInto a human being? This dog has seen better days You're gonna dieHow does it feel, Stubb? Eat &amp; sleepFulfill your only rollLet your problems seepOut of your hole Cataract Do you remember We called you family?Now you're undergroundWe call you memory Memory... Gone.
