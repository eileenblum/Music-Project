I wanna lock Betty Crocker in the kitchenAnd knock her upper during supperClutter up her butter gutterHostess Ding Dong wrapped an eggroll around my wongWhile Dolly Madison proceded to ping my pongYour Milky Way is M'n'M in your britchesAnd I'll tell you Baby Ruth it looks mighty deliciousKeep blowing my gum, cuz here I comeI'm gonna get you all sticky with my Bubble Yum Knick knack paddywhack and give your dog a bone, baby I was givin' some head to some french breadIt was a four course orgy on the spread of my bedFrench kissin' french fries in my Fruit of the LoomsI get deeper penetration with a fork and a spoon I got yogurt meat loaf smeared all over my assI stick my weiner in two buns and and then give it the gasSour cream from my spleen into Levi jeansGonna bust the seams with my refried beans Ronald McDonald just loves to be fondledWith Big Mac he'll fuck it like a Chicken McNuggetColonel Sanders wants to goose Granny's loose cabooseHe's gonna give her a boost with that Kentucky fried juiceSooper doop poop scoop, loop de loop, chicken coopShoot some hoop, top sirloin from the groinTopped with dick cheese, sneeze, wheeze,From the skeez disease, wooi! Take a dump, baby, squirt some gravyPour some sugar on me, honey, make it brown &amp; runnyGive a little Flavor Flav, back from the graveGonna burn some toast, pump some humpin' rump roast Knick knack paddywhack, jump in the sack, in factJerk the smack and crack Jack from the backBananarama or ramabananaFuckin' Barry Manilow on the Copa Cabana Squeeze me macaroni, slop your face with my bologna You gotta syphon the spinach, you gotta cream the cornSperm scrambles the eggs and a meal is bornCookin' like a beginner, but I'm goin' up in herI had Fritos for lunch I'm havin' bush for dinnerChef Boyardee and the Three MuskateersShove Charleston Chews in their rears like queers"Holy moly, guacamole!" said my Chips AhoyI'm gonna pinch a ravioli on the Pillsbury dough boy Knick knack paddywhack and give your dog a boner, baby We came to pottie...we came to pottie down your throat
