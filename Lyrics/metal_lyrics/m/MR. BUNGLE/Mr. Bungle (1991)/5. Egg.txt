Rotting from the insideOver-incubated by the heat of fear and loveThe self's coagulated Egg... La la la la la la laLa la la la la la la Boiling hard in euphemismSlowly becoming part of the waterLike a frog who never knowsThe jacuzzi's getting hotter Blah blah blah blah blah blah blahBlah blah blah blah blah blah blah How'd you know I was looking at youIf you weren't looking at me? A stagnant pale perfumeConceived to block the poresThe clotting glands encroachThe endless comfort of a momDeep inside my tanning salonWishing life was poached La la la la la la laLa la la la la la la I can't seem to differentiateBetween the yellow love you give and the white sex I takeI just want to fertilize you Blah blah blah blah blah blah blahBlah blah blah blah blah blah blah The cracks finally appearRelease cholesterol tearsThe flooded cyst drains itself of pusThe lonely stomach chills unless it's drunkSo as she drives she'll close her eyesFeel it warming up inside edisni eht morf gnittoRevol dna raef fo taeh eht yb detabucni-revOdetalugaoc s'fles ehT Egg... Oh an egg comes out of a chickenOh a chicken comes out of an egg There's no place like home...
