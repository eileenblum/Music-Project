[Sleep Part II]

Powder grinding mouthful
Pull the day from the nocturn
Sonmiloquist is the nightmare's song

"In the multiplied objects of the external world I had no thoughts
but for the teeth...and of Bernice I more seriously believed that all her
teeth were thoughts...the white and ghastly spectrum of the teeth...
meditations were never pleasureable...the phantasma of the teeth
maintained its terrible ascendency..." (Poe)

Lock into bitten dreams perfectionist
break like a childs mouth

The Secret Song

Quiet
Don't tell anybody
Don't let 'em know
There's a secret

I know the secret song now
They wouldn't tell me
But somehow I found out
Yeah

Goddammit, I'm pissed off

I didn't get to play on it at all
No way

They kicked me out of the band
