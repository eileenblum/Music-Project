They're shining searchlights in the sky'Cause there's a new God in the signIt says their map is not their terrier workAnd then I broke my telescopeBut that's the nature of the gameAnd you have to play Bring back the pain of a god that's never blueYou're in control of the whole damned universeBring back the shame and the bright lights on a fewIt keeps me coming back to you The deaths were faked, the laughs were criesBut ressurrections are doing fineYou got me walking into suicideAnd I'll be right there by your sideIn reproduction of your merry go bye bye Here to paradise they goBrighter made is their woeAs above, so below We reached for an outside point of viewBut its out of touch with me and youI feel I'm walking into suicideBut you'll be right there by my sideTo beam my message into space as I die Bring back the shame of the many for the fewGet on your knees and I'll be coming back to youBring back the pain of an inverse world for twoIt keeps me coming back to you
