Your lips say one thing But the drugs say another How can I massage This inter-galactic ulcer?  Goodbye sober day  Hello milky way...  Pin my ear to the wisdom post Hang me up and drain me dry Mend my shipwrecked spirit Lift the veil from my eyes  Goodbye sober day The years grew wings and flew away  Ghosts of the past become barbarians Of the future... And I still pity you Because what you said was true  Goodbye sober day Hello milky way...  May your sun be blown out like a candle May your sea burn like tar May your sky be rolled up like a scroll May your blue moon drip with blood  What would they say If you went up in smoke? If I dug you up And made soup of your bones?  Goodbye sober day
