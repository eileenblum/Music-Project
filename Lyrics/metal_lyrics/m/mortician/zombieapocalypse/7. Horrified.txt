[Repulsion cover]

Chill climbs up your back
Nightmares of death
Black haze pollutes your mind
Fear will infest
No warmth to comfort you
You see only black
Snarling faces staring at you
Tormenting evil laughs

Horrified

Adrenaline is pumping fast
Sanity cannot last
Grab your head scream in pain
you know you won't be sane again

Horrified

Morbid thoughts obsess your mind
You live in a hellish dream
You feel the horror looking down
A face you cannot see
Paranoia in the dark
You sense the death is near
You try to scream for help
But a soul cannot hear you

Horrified

Deep within your consciousness
Horror is unleashed
stare into the face of death
A hellish mutant beast
Pressure builds inside your brain
It's about to explode
The blood drains from your head
You lie there, still and cold
