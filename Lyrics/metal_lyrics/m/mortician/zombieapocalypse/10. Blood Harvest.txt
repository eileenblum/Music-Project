[This song goes out to Lead &amp; all our fans in Omaha, NE]

Children of terror
Elders are slaughtered
Blood sacrifices
To the god of corn

Messengers of death
Cut and hack the flesh
Morbid killing cult
Knife slashes the throat

Outsiders will die
Unheard victim's cries
No one will survive
Gutted corpses lie

Will Rahmer: bass guitar &amp; vocals
Roger J. Beaujard: guitars &amp; drum programming
Desmond Tolhurst: guitars
