[Slaughter (CAN) cover]

Deep in the coffin
Death prevails
Slowly awaiting
Rotting entrails
Naked cadaver
Ready to mount
Open the mouth
Go down for the count

White and clammy
Cold as ice
Fuck of death
Will suffice
Bury my face
In her stench of death
Kissing those lips
Without any breath

Die...

Drain the blood
From the neck
Into the macabre
Nightly trek
Howl of the witch
Flight of the bat
Screaming from hell
Like a Siamese cat
