No more room in Hell
Putrid rotting smell
Hunger need to kill

Ripping through the Earth
Lust for blood and death
Seeking human flesh

Hunger of the dead
Human corpses bled

Ripping off the heads
Bones are torn of flesh

Guts are torn apart
Pulling out the hearts
Bones are left to rot

Bodies stripped of flesh
Hell now walks the earth
Zombie plague of death
