Seductive girls, they come for you
Intent to kill, make you their food
Rip out your throat, feed on your flesh
Blood splattering, draining your corpse
Munching your organs, peeling skin from bones
Cannibalistic fiends, ripping out your brains
They long for blood and crave for flesh
They lure you to a gruesome death
