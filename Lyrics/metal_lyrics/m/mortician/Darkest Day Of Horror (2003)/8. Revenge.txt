Stripped and naked, raped and beaten
In blood she lies, alone to die
Nightmares torment the mind
Rage building up inside
No mercy for her cries
Revenge, they now must die
Murder burns in her eyes
Strung up and left to die
Seduced into the tub
Castrated, dying in blood
Rapists meet their demise
Bloodlust is satisfied
One more is left to kill
Axe splits open the skull
