A violent death, a mangled mess
Head is severed, torn from your neck
Broken body, smashed to pieces
Putrid stench of rotting faeces
Blood seeps from your wounds
Bile, pus, flowing guts
Brains pour from your head
Cold, still, you lie dead
Mangled body, bloody carcass
Spilling forth the inner organs
A clump of flesh, dead and bleeding
Maggots join the rodents' feeding
