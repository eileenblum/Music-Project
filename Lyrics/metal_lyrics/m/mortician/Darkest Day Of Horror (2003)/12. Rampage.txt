Insane, the lust for murder
Savage, sadistic torture
Roaming the streets of darkness
Searching for helpless victims
Sharpened knife, blade is gleaming
Cutting, the blood is flowing
Hacking the limbs and organs
Laughing while victims scream
Slaughter, blood splatters the streets
Bloody, brutal gore-filled death
Slicing, tearing the throat
Gutting the inner organs
Horror, body count rising
Decayed, carcasses rotting
Killer, no-one can s top him
Victims, the corpses piling
