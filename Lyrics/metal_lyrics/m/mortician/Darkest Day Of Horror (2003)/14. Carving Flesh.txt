Knife is sharpened, blade is gleaming
Ready for cutting
Throat cut open, gargling, choking
Veins are gushing, blood is spraying
Stripping, skinning
Brutal hacking, carving the flesh
Slicing through the skin
Inner organs rupture within
Guts are spilling, luring victims
Killing for fun, mangled corpses
Lie still in death
