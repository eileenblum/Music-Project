Morbid voices calling, unknown terror waiting
Enter th e house of gore, prepare for slaughter
Spectral beings, blood is running from the faucets
Phantoms, ghostly visions
Evil clown doll grinning
Head split open with an axe, the blood is flowing
Throat is slit and eyeballs punctured, gruesome killings
Hammer smashes the face
Guillotined at the waist
Melting, death by acid
Blood-drenched splattering deaths
