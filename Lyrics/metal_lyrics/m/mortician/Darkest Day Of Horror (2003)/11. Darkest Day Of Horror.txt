Sun shines on the earth
Darkest day of death
Rotting, walking dead
Search for human flesh
Few survivors left
Rats feed on the dead
Hiding underground
Can't escape the sound
Of the undead howls
Rip apart the corpses
Tearing out the organs
Peeling off human skin
Bloody zombie feasting
Human's fate is met
Hordes of living dead
Come to bring their death
Massive bloodletting
Eating, munching skin
Gory flesh dining
No more humans left
Millions of undead
Now control the earth
