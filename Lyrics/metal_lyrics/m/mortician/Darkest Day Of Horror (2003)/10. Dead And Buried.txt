Potter's Bluff, the town of death
Smell of decomposing flesh
Townspeople are living dead
Chopping, hacking you to death
Friendly people have you met
Are they real or are they dead?
Enter, you will meet your end
Boulder smashes in your head
Beaten, tied and burned alive
Needle stuck into your eye
Mortician bringing new life
Thoughts of a demented mind
Now you learn that you have died
Horrified, you're still alive
