Betrayal, left to die, lust for blood
Casting call for Audra, six summoned
Desolate, eerily dark estate
Jealousy for the part, seals their fate
Masked killer, morbid rage, waits for them
Murdering one by one till there's none
Hideous horrid face, takes your life
Slits your throat, spilling blood on the ice
Hatred, all must die
Icepick in the spine
Darkened rooms of death
Sound of morbid breath
Psychotic killer comes, mask of death
Hunts for you, shining blade, blood is fresh
Mutilated corpses lie in the snow
All are dead, Audra lives, curtains close
