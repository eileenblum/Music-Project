Embalming room, body lies
Lying stiff, still alive
Filled with formaldehyde
Fluid slowly takes the life
Stomach punctured, torn apart
Chemical injections start
Internal organs melt inside
Pressure bursts out the eyes
Fluid flowing through the veins
Can't escape the deathly pain
Rigor mortis takes your life
You're fucking EMBALMED ALIVE!
