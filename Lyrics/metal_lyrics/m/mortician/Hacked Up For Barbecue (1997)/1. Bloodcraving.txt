Awakened from the damp cold grave
Centuries undead the coffin's slave
Hungering for taste of mortal blood
Hands breaking through the rotted wood
Tearing through the dirt
Rising from the earth
Ripping through the flesh, breaking limbs and bones
Blood pours from the neck, bodies torn and thrown
Feasting on the heart, gouging out the eyes
Organs torn apart, mortals scream and die
Zombie living dead
Forever to roam the earth
