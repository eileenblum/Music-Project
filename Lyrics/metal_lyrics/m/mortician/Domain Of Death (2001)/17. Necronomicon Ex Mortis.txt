Darkness falls in the forest of the dead
Evil forces lie dormant in the earth
Waiting for the summoning to arise
To terrorize and claim fresh mortal lives

Necronomicon Exmortis
Passages invoke the demons

Reciting from the pages in the book
Summoning evil creatures from the wood
Unleashing evil forces on the earth
Demons possess your soul and bring you death

Evil dead hunt human victims
Horrifying gruesome killings

Ghastly demons coming for you
Take your body, possess your soul
Unseen forces of deadly evil killing
All who enter the woods

Chainsaw cutting, blood is spraying
Limbs are flying, guts are spilling

Ghouls attacking, blood is spewing
Hell's dominions butchering
No escape evil forces sent off to eternal darkness
