Confused helpless mind
Depressed lonely nights
Vampiric thoughts control
Morbid taste for blood

Roaming through the night
Need to take a life
Blood and death tonight
Control the appetite

Razor cutting through the skin
Blood is flowing from the veins

Drink blood from the corpse
Satisfy the lust
Deranged psychopath
Leaves a trail of death

Trail of victims grows
Careless in the kill
Evidence of death
Time for vampire's end

Enter vampire's lair
Stake, hammer in hand
Stake placed hammer swings
Heart is pierced blood sprays

Need for blood unfilled
Will rise again to kill
