Superhuman mental scanners
Brought into the earth with powers
Experiments gone wrong at birth
A war for control of the death

Inner conflict, anger building
War is coming, powers surging

The power to kill with the mind
Plan to form a scanner army
To kill and maim and mutilate
Control the earth and human slaves

Showdown coming, brainwaves
Battling good vs. evil, winner must kill

Veins are bursting
Eyeballs melting
Heads exploding
Bodies burning
