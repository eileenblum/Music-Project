Contamination
Slug mutation
Abnormal growth
Breaking through earth

Oozing slime trails
Swarming mutants
Craving for flesh
Slow gruesome death

Slugs in your head, burst through your face
Eyeballs and brains, eaten and drained

Ooze through your flesh
Slime covered death
Eating within
You die in pain
