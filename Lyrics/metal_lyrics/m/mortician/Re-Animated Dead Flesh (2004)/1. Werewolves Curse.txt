Lost and helpless on the dark moon
Morbid howling drawing nearer
Unseen evil in the darkness
Closing in, ready for carnage

From the darkness striking swiftly
Inhuman savage brutal beast
Jaws of death snapping at your throat
Ripping, tearing, spilling your blood

Friend is lieing dead and bleeding
Carnivore enjoys the death feast
Try in vain to help its victim
Werewolf sence your coming within

No escaping the beast of death
Cornered and trapped your fate is met
Sharpened teeth sink into your flesh
Drawing blood you're now infected

Thoughts of death and mutilation
Body changing muscles ripping
Transformation to a werewolf
Roam the streets in search of fresh blood
