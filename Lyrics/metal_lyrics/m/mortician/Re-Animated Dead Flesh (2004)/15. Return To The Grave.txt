Years have passed relentless killing
Piles of broken bleeding victims
Gruesome sight of walking decay
Soon to be returned to the grave

Hunting for fresh blood
The quest is now done
Ends the flesh hunger
Blood craving over

Enter to the cemetary
Walk among the rotting bodies
Boney fingers clawing the earth
It is time the corpse must now rest

Enter the grave
Lie in decay
Waiting dormant
For the return
