Visions of fast gruesome deaths
Coming back to haunt the present
Power within the mirror
Possessing to claim more victims

Pitchfork in your flesh
Blood seeping from your organs
Scissors in your neck
Fills your throat the blood is gurgling
Mirror exploding
Shards of glass are piercing your skin
Unseen force of death
Lust for blood and mutilation
