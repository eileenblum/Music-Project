Madman marz, psychopath
Say his name, means your death
Hiding out, in the woods
Searching for, fresh young blood

Hangs you up, breaks your neck
Swings the axe, chops your head
Bloody stump, gushing red
Body jerks, till your dead

Bodies hang, in the shed
All your friends now are dead
Comes for you, in the night
Axe in hand, takes your life
