Axe chops off your head
Knives tear through your flesh
Chainsaw off your limbs
Organs crushed within

Brutal, savage, mauling, killing
Cut up, broken, body, bleeding

Blood squirts from your stumps
Flesh lying in lumps
Bones severed and broke
Flesh mangled and torn

Rotting, body, putrid, odor
Maggots, feed on, inner, organs
