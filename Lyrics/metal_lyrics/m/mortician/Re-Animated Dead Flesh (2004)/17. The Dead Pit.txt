Asylum of the insane
Experiments on the deranged
Killed, sealed in the cellar
Surgeon seeks his revenge

Twenty years have passed
Breaking out at last
Zombies come to kill
Mortal blood will spill

Zombie, army, rotting, bodies
Master, surgeon, commands, the dead

Needles in the eyes
Severed heads now fly
Lacerated face
Scooped out fresh brains

Bloody, carnage, human, slaughter
Undead, rampage, blood fills, the halls
