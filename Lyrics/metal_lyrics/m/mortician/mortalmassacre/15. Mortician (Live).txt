Morbid -  bringer of death
Descends -  unto the earth
Exhumes -  the fresh graves
Corpses -  are turned to slaves
He drains your blood and embalms you alive
Steals your soul as your body rots and dies
Mortuary -  his morbid home
Cemetery -  his creatures roam
Enter -  your life will end
Creeping -  spheres descend
The spheres drill the blood and the brains from your head
Your body twists and jerks until your finally dead
Funeral's over the casket's closed
Your body starts to decompose
Remains are to be destroyed
Brought into the crematory
Enters -  into your home
He comes -  to take your soul
Mortician -  you can't escape
Dead -  you're in the hearse
