Bones And Limbs Breaking Forth Through The Earth
Worm Infested Maggot Filled Rotting Death
Rising Up Bursting Forth From Their Graves
Summoned To Walk The Earth As Undead Slaves

Cities Filled With Flesh Eating Living Dead
Drinking Warm Blood Of The Humans Bled
Tearing Bloody Chunks Of Flesh To Eat
Maggots Join Zombies To Devour The Meat

Undead Slaughter
Mortal Massacre
