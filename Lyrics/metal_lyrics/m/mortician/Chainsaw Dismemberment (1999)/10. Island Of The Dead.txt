Zombie island, corpses riding
Rotting undead, searching for flesh
Worms infested, putrid death stench
Lurching forward, seek human blood
Zombies come eat you alive
Chew your face, rip out your eyes
Hunger for death, feast on your flesh
Tear through your skin, disembowelment
Rip out your heart, corpse torn apart
Organ munching, eating your brains
Zombies come rip off your head
On the island of the dead
