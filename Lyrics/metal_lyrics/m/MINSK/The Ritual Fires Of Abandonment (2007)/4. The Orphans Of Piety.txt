Fire dance of self deprecation dopamine receptivity
The orphans of piety we are birthed into sorrow and shame
A truth to believe a thirst for reprieve
Our throats scorched with the sins of our fathers we burn with the sins of our fathers
These sacred certainties floated right past me and I cannot remember my name
Scandalous proclivity these orphans of piety
We cherish our reprimand pain in your shadow where I stand
Draw a circle around me in the sand I have breathed in but released your lungs
Of Ave Mariaâs from wombs of the one I have wandered each day
From the alter to the grave in search of your name and face
I have seen your shadow where I stand
