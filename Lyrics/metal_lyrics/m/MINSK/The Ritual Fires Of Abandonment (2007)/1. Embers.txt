In my darkest hour my blood runs free
Iâve come to lie on the fire
Iâve come to stare at the sun
Where two bleed as one
Is it time the sun arrived to burn away the numb
In the flesh denying the eyes of time
Make me nourishment for the blazing flame
Make me food for the sacred fire
Tide cast aside open mouth wide
The sea cried for me
Dead spirit part of me
I left you by the sea
