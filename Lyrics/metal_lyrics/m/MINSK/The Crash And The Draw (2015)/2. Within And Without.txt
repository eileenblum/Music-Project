Our life remains 
A process of guilt and obfuscation 
And it stays the same 
No closer to the deeper truths 
And further from a divine light 

We rode on wings, baring our souls / Into the night 
Leaving scattered remnants of self / When the stars fall 
We fell from the sky / The depths went black 
And with a blink / The lesser wind 
Stood and teetered on the chasm's brink / Submitting to the darkness 

And grey, and black and nothingness 
We form a line, from there to here 
Hoping to find our way back 

Gave way to green, and the ultimate question / With the remnants of light 
All things seen and heard / You've sewn the seeds on the altar 
All intangibles given a word / The new dawn's fire 
And now a new breath, a decree / Burns brighter still 

Of purpose, of inspiration, of necessity 
To the many possibilities left unheard 

We bend, we wither, without the wind 
Wearing borrowed skin 
Dethroned, feet set firm 
I see the liars, cower in their dens 

To defy concern, by discerning, we rise again 
To gain a hold, by releasing 
The chaff blows away with the wind 

Fear of death is a delusion we must escape 
While weakness preys upon the Will 
Yet we offer the excuse of self 

With scream and whisper a call will be heard 
Unable to say where the mountain ends and the clouds begin 
Floating in the aether awaiting the grasp of all who dare 
Unwilling to say where the mountain ends and the clouds begin 

We bend, we wither, without the wind 
And grey, and black, and nothingness 
With scream and whisper 
Our call will be heard
