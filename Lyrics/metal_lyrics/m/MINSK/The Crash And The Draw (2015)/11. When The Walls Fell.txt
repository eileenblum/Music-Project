This night / Toward and empty sky a soul defies 
Soaked in fire / Two paths collide 
His head so low he cannot lift / An offering to death sublime 
His eyes for you / In the sacred lines to follow 

Upon the precipice, setting precedent 
This space where nothing grows 
Writhing in grey, wishing the woe away 
Faces seen but never known 

All the roads to strange paradise 
Yet unknown, this sacred destruction 

Oh child, your life, your will 
Sinking feeling, where are you going now 

We approach, an even-ing 
We approach a horizon, another cycle of renewal 
All our lives, waiting for this time, this release 
The mourning has fallen, a balance returns, an even-ing 

All our lives spent, waiting for this 
Soaked in fire, an empty sky, death sublime, a soul defies this time 
All our crimes, they have played out against us 
Forget the finality, there is abundance here 
Embrace the complexity, now cut the cord and release 

Chipping away, away at the stone, building it all, always alone 
An inroad into the calcified mind, the beginning of the end of these chains that will bind 
So we are, chipping away, so we could know 
These scars of old left to mend in the cold 

Discovering the essence, we harken the call / Oh child, your life, your will 
Left for dead in this wasteland, the path unknown / Sinking feeling, where are you going now 
We carry on, without fear, the birds speak in tongues / A blinding light returns, the Will set within 
We will heed their beckoning, proceed with all we know / At the foot of the hill, a sacrifice made, the will set within 
We will harken the call, we will find a way 

Yet we remain numb, with this placid facade 
I will see through this, I will find a way 

We will find our way 
Beginning of the end
