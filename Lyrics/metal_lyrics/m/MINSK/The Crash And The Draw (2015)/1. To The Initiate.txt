The triumph of the three 
As it is, and because of what is, and what shall ever be 
The four beneath the one 
The quintessential animation 
Spirits arise, to you there is no end 
Time will progress with the beauty of what shall ever be 
Absence provides water for this elemental spring 

The toil and the reaping 
A reminder of inherent beauty 
Welcome respite amidst the weeping 
An ushering in, a reminder of purpose 
Of Will, of duty, of rejuvenation of promise 
To answer the clarion call 
As imagination creates existence 
The builders professing to one and all 

Far flung revisions, unsteady convictions, fall with me now 
Uninitiated, we'll fight the war from outside, follow me down 
I'll warn you but once, the answers aren't there 
And maybe this spirals en route to nowhere 
And the compartments of the scheme are vast 
But up is still down, and the last will be first 
And fevered dreams are still illusions too 

Imagination creates existence 
The builders professing to one and all 
This too shall pass 
With you I'll pass 
This blessed past 
Forever bending fast 

To you there is no end 
To us there is no end 
To all there is no end 
To end the time begins
