We've built illusion, into every failing sequence / Welcome decay in honor of the sun 
This hollow shell, this beacon of suffering / The path unknown, we carry on, we approach 

A death march, repeating, forever in a circle 

And hidden from our sight, for an end we still falsely seek / To see the road, and to not traverse 
There is a cost here, etched in every heart / Would destroy the will, would vanquish the soul 
The pain we hide, from ourselves / And now let us proceed with all that we know, balance returns 

That will awaken to begin 
A new procession 
Toward an undoing 
Stowed away beneath time 

How far can you see, never far enough 
And how much ground must be covered to roundly crown the bluff 
The circle ever bending 
The cycle never ending 

The way is through, no circumventing here 
To see the road and not to traverse 
Would destroy the will, would vanquish the soul 
So let us proceed with all that we know 

This fire inside ascends, awaiting, new light to rise 
Awaken to begin a new procession 

Starlight commands the world be built again 
To start again by ceasing 
We approach, another cycle 

Awaken, to begin, renewal 
Why aren't you living 
Why would you repeat this
