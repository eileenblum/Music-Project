Lifeless shells dance to the rhythm of the ego 
Forced into freedom while blind to its wisdom 
The monoliths scream emptiness, no power held within 

Extract the wrath, the spectre of not fit to be 

Chasing a never ending ending, neglecting the now 
Lifeless shells dance to the rhythm of the ego 
A seething retreating 

Left to rot in the nether, rejecting the never 
Monoliths scream emptiness, no power held within 
You have not arrived, and you are blind 

The stream hidden âneath the rose, hidden âneath the hollowed oak 
Winds carry the dust of fossilized dreams 
But they are blind 

The child of the union, the lesser stone 
Leaving the inner eye to guide, regret we leave you to die 
Be not blind 

Extract the wrath, the spectre of not fit to be 
At the foot of the hill, a sacrifice made 
To the garish remembrance of failure 

White to green, peel away the sterile sheen 
Blessed separation, the ending of the masquerade
