Thrown into the depths 
A self-imposed exile 
Gnawing at the marrow 
The stragglers set to expire 
Breathe, breathe 

Unaware of the current, see the cost and its worth, unaware of our birth 
The necessity of a cleansing never evident before 
Unaware of the currency, the cost and its worth, unaware of our birth 
Attention must be paid 
Unaware of the current, see the cost and its worth, unaware of our birth 
Gnosis, a foundation, realizing 
Unaware of the currency, the cost and its worth, unaware of our birth 
And it's worth 
Unaware 
Attention you must pay
