Nothing rests, everything moves, everything vibrates 

Our wayward voices shall call once again 
One and all, none and all 

Return 

Of warp, and weft, we thin / A wake to mourning, a birth to evening 
Of breath bereft, and nothing left, we pass again / Awake to morning, an heir to even-ing
