Of Light and enlivened in solstice embrace 
Knowing full the limitless nature of the all 
Emboldened enmeshed in these longest of days 
Embracing the infinite power of the one 

Waiting for harvest cherishing growth 
Eyes brightened by the sun 
White as gold 

The mourning has fallen and memory fades away with the fog 
Shall you conspire against this mystery, and when have you the time 
Let these rays burn through and be now edified 
The crash and the draw, the unchanging law, the sea rises 

Memory fades away 
We follow as the water finds its way 
The Lethe's sweet embrace
