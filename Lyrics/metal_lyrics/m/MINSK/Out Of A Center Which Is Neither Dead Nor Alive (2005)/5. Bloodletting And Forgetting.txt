The dive into numbness, the only option today.
Retreating into oblivion never felt so effortless.
Forging the path within an eternal descent.
Hope, progress, and growth spring from the crypt of realized fallacies.
Living through death.
Learning to love.
Embracing discontent.
Face down.
Bloodletting and forgetting.
Exorcising demons.
Exercising futility.
