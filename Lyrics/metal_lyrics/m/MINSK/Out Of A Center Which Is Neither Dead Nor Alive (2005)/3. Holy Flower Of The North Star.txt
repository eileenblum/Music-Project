I wonât take this chord from round my throat, and I canât promise you wonât find a note.
For our gallows still stand luminous and tall.
And theyâre calling to us even now.
I will make no sacred vow.
A kiss has seal these lips tonight, and tomorrow may never come for me.
But in this night weâll feast and we weâll fight and keep these fires burning until the dawn.
And if we make it to see the morning light, weâll sing an errant wandererâs song of hangmen, heroes, lovers, and pawns.
