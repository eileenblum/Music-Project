[performed by Minsk]Lives of great men all remind us we may make our lives sublime
And departing leave behind us footprints in the sands of time
Of hewn stones the sacred circle where the wizened sages sat
Let us try to remember all the times where they were at.
So you thought they were expecting
Assault and battery on the human anatomy
Assault and battery on the human anatomy man.

The golden void speaks to me denying my reality
I lose my body, lose my mind, I blow like wind, and flow like wine
Down a corridor of flame, will I fly so high again
Is there something wrong with me, I cannot hear, I cannot see
Down a corridor of flame
So you think the time is past, the life you lead will always last
Chaotic fusions of your soul, down below that rocky knowle
Through the clouds an open sky, the wind flows through your watering eyes
The sounds are pitched to draw you on your never ending journey on
The edge of time, the edge of time, the edge of time

[Dave Brock]
