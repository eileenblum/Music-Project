[performed by Minsk]Lost am I in this world
Of timelessness and woe
Can I find the doorways
Through which I must go
Is the key to this plane
Too much for me to try to gain
Is the passport to this
World my astral soul

7 signs rode on 7 stars
7 ways to find the long lost bards
7 days became 7 years
While Pocus laughed and called foul jeers
7 times he cursed the 7 tears
Each one became their 7 fears
What is lost is never gained again
I've cast the spell that eternity chains
No more to cry O' mortal soul
The astral path is now your fortuitous role

Lost am I in this world
Of timelessness and woe
Can I find the doorways
Through which I must go
Is the key to this plane
Too much for me to try to gain
Is the passport to this
World my astral soul
