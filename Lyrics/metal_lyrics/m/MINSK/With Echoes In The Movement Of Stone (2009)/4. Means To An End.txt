Strength of the spirit means to an end
Returning a stranger from the west setting sun
Shell of rust dust and dreams
Unearthed by our own hands
The sacred scatters like dust
Dust and dreams shell of rust
The soil calls me softly as it does us all
Confusion's wake will paralyze
Shell and dust stand fossilized
