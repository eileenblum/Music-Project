[Verse:]
Please take a minute
Just another minute of your precious time
Wait for a moment
Give me a second to explain my son
Sit by my side for awhile
How come you donât speak to me
You see, to me it means a lot

[Bridge:]
I will be near
When you least expect me to
I will be there
Right beside you when you fall asleep

[Chorus:]
CALLING
He wants me to forgive him
After all that I went through
Who is he CALLING for?

[Verse:]
I wasnât there
When you needed me to be your guiding light
Can you forgive me?
Trust me Iâll never let you down again
Time heals all scars, donât you see
I know I didnât watch you grow
But I, I canât go back in time

[Bridge:]
So look ahead
Still thereâs many years to come
Within our hearts
There is still a father and his son

[Chorus:]
CALLING
He wants me to forgive him
After all that I went through
Who is he CALLING for?

Stick:Within our hearts
We are still father and son

[Chorus:]
CALLING
He wants me to forgive him
After all that I went through
Who is he CALLING x2
Who is he?
CALLING?
