We are waiting for the Final War
When true Heroes start to rise
A rebellious Call, we have heard it all
Now the Thunder Riders fight

Roaring Blast are high up in the Sky
Burning Flames igniting in the Night
Fists of Steel are hailing Gods of Thunder
Break the Silence, hear the Battlecall
Make some Noise and let all Traitors fall
At the End they'll see their ridic blunder

Look into the Fire, hail the coming Storm
It's our sole Desire, our Time will come
Oh

We are waiting for the Final War
When true Heroes start to rise
A rebellious Call, we have heard it all
Now the Thunder Riders fight
Mighty Fire shall renew the World
It will teach us who we are
May the Lightning strike in the holy Night
We will fight the Final War

Mighty Armies waiting for the Call
For the Sign to start the Final War
May the Free ones march for Pride and Glory
Here it comes, a Clash so loud and hard
Now we finally fight against their Froud
The Sign is here so let us write our Story

Look into the Fire, hail the coming Storm
It's our sole Desire, our Time will come
Oh

We are waiting for the Final War
When true Heroes start to rise
A rebellious Call, we have heard it all
Now the Thunder Riders fight
Mighty Fire shall renew the World
It will teach us who we are
May the Lightning strike in the holy Night
We will fight the Final War
