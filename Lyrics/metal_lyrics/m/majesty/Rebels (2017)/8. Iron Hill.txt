Rise, we rise out of the darkest Night
Ride near the Sky, Horizons far and wide
Destiny calls, so let us all fullfill
Our own final War, let's find the Iron Hill

Time to star a Journey, time to end our Pain
Ride, the Fire's burning, reign is what we claim

We are on a Mission, let us fly so high
Find the Place is our Destiny

Sons and Daughters with stubborn Will
We will find the Iron Hill
Rode for Glory, Blood we spilled
Let us climb the Iron Hill
The Iron Hill
Iron Hill
Iron Hill

Break our Chains forever, rise out of the Dark
March and fight together, hail our Fire Heart

Never we shall stand, we're born to rule, yeah rule
Let us find the Place where we are Free
Sons and Daughters with stubborn Will
We will find the Iron Hill
Rode for Glory, Blood we spilled
Let us climb the Iron Hill
The Iron Hill
Iron Hill
Iron Hill
