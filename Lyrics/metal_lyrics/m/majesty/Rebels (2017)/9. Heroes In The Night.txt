One in the Middle and one on the Side
Wherever Heroes stand they keep the truth and fate inside
Let us sing, we will sing
Out of the Ashes, now the Phoenix will rise
Brings us a new Era for the Young and for the Wild
To the Night, into the Night

We fight and stand together
Hey, let us fight forever
We own the Glory and the Right
Hey man, don't let them fool ya
Hey it's your only Future
Come, be a Hero in the Night
We are Heroes in the Night
We are Heroes in the Night

Fight for your Future and fight for your Fate
Never let them poison you with Smugness and with Hate
You are strong, fucking strong
They live in their Cages, are so happy to be
But rebels like Yourself all have the strong Will to be free
Break your Chains, break these Chains

We fight and stand together
Hey, let us fight forever
We own the Glory and the Right
Hey man, don't let them fool ya
Hey it's your only Future
Come, be a Hero in the Night
We are Heroes in the Night
We are Heroes in the Night

We're burning like Fire, together we're strong
Against their fucking Ignorance we're singing this Song
No more stupid Rules and no more Lies
We are Heroes in the Night

We fight and stand together
Hey, let us fight forever
We own the Glory and the Right
Hey man, don't let them fool ya
Hey it's your only Future
Come, be a Hero in the Night
We are Heroes in the Night
We are Heroes in the Night
