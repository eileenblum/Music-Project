The Time has come, let's shoot the gun and let them hear our Roar
We ain't gonna take it anymore
We raise our Flag and shout Attack and live just like we want
By Freedom and by Metal we are bond

We live as Metal Outlaws and show them we're not dead
Let's proudle post on Youtube when we bang our fucking Head

Yolo Heavy Metal
Rebels come and Join the Battle
Yolo Heavy Metal
We are Number one
Yolo Heavy Metal
Raise your Fist take bavk our Chattel
Yolo Heavy Metal
Feel it as it comes
Yolo Heavy Metal

We hear the Beat and take the Street, we don' know Fear at all
Heard the one and only Rebel Call
Our Post is seen around the World on every single Screen
We will break the Silence, hear our Scream

We do just what we want to, just move and let us pass
We spit into their Faces and we kick their fucking Ass

Yolo Heavy Metal
Rebels come and Join the Battle
Yolo Heavy Metal
We are Number one
Yolo Heavy Metal
Raise your Fist take bavk our Chattel
Yolo Heavy Metal
Feel it as it comes
Yolo Heavy Metal
