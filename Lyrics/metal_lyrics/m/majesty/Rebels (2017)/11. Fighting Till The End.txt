There are Times whe I walk alone at Night, but I never loose my Faith
And I know that Life is a constant Fight, I will run into that Maze
I believe that my Heart is strong, it will guide me on my Way
I will live my Life, I will sing my Songs, all until my final Day

It's my Revolution, I'll always live my Dreams
And when others say that's not their Way, there is Freedom they can not see

All my Life I keep on fighting, I am fighting 'till the End
And if you just live your Lies then go away and fuck yourself
I will always keep believing, I will never loose my Stance
Let my Hope stop all my Griefing, you can join me and fly my Friend
Fighting 'till the End

When the Rocks of Hate block my Path of Fate
I will smash them loud and wild
You can join my Friend, it's not too late
Leave your toneless Life behind
Fight with me, overcome your Fear, Show them all yout Spirit's free
On the March of fate all your Mind is clear, true Salvation I can see

It's my Revolution, I'll always live my Dreams
And when others say that's not their Way, there is Freedom they can not see

All my Life I keep on fighting, I am fighting 'till the End
And if you just live your Lies then go away and fuck yourself
I will always keep believing, I will never loose my Stance
Let my Hope stop all my Griefing, you can join me and fly my Friend
Fighting 'till the End

There are Moments pf Anxiety, but my Heart is strong as Steel
So I keep on marching forward, always live my Freedom Dream

All my Life I keep on fighting, I am fighting 'till the End
And if you just live your Lies then go away and fuck yourself
I will always keep believing, I will never loose my Stance
Let my Hope stop all my Griefing, you can join me and fly my Friend
Fighting 'till the End
