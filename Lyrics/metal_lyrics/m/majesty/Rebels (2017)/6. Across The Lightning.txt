I fought a thousand Battles, I have heard a million Calls
By the Leaders I have followed without Tribute or Rewards
A lonely shilpit soldier, lost my Friends and all I've got
And my Gaze at the Horizon shows me Sorrow, Tears and Mud

In the Darkness I am lost and all alone
Will I find the unholy Path to take me Home

I am howling with the Wind
And I am flying Across the Lightning
Friends, I'm coming Home again
I keep on rising Across the Lightning

A Winter storm is brewing, fills the Fields of War with Snow
I see those bygone Shadows from the ones I used to know
Where will my Journey take me, it begins with crucial Pain
Will my Crimes be all forgotten, washed away by bloody Rain

In the Darkness I am lost and all alone
Will I find the unholy Path to take me Home

I am howling with the Wind
And I am flying Across the Lightning
Friends, I'm coming Home again
I keep on rising Across the Lightning

I'm flying high above the Land
All I can see is cursed and damned
Nowhere to go, where is my Hope to carry on?

I am howling with the Wind
And I am flying Across the Lightning
Friends, I'm coming Home again
I keep on rising Across the Lightning
