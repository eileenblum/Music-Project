The black Wind is howling like Pipes of Death
Bringing a Blaze of Demise
Blood thirsty Shadows are on the way
To eat all that's left there slive
Renew all the Life wich is on the earth
With Flames of Resurgence tonight
Red Dust is burning in heated Air
Explosions are thundering wild

Imperial Light inflame the Night
Let it begin with a Spark

Fireheart, Fireheart
Burn all the Bridges at Dawn
Fireheart, Fireheart
Flames of Destruction will storm
Fire, Fire, Fire, Fireheart
Fire, Fire, Fire, Fireheart

It all begins with a Clash so loud
The Dead ones stand up from their Graves
Ghosts of the Deep are emerging now
No Place in the World is safe
The Red Moon is bursting, it's falling down
The Mountains are melting to Stone
A River of Blood floating everywhere
Unholy Creatures are Home

Fireheart, Fireheart
Torches are burning tonight
Fireheart, Fireheart
A Kingdom of Embers will rise
Fire, Fire, Fire, Fireheart
Fire, Fire, Fire, Fireheart

Fireheart, fireheart
Ohohohohoh
Fireheart, fireheart
Ohohohohoh
Fireheart, fireheart
Ohohohohoh
Fireheart, fireheart
Ohohohohoh

Fireheart, Fireheart
Burn all the Bridges at Dawn
Fireheart, Fireheart
Flames of Destruction will storm
Fire, Fire, Fire, Fireheart
Fire, Fire, Fire, Fireheart

Fireheart, Fireheart
Torches are burning tonight
Fireheart, Fireheart
A Kingdom of Embers will rise
Fire, Fire, Fire, Fireheart
Fire, Fire, Fire, Fireheart
