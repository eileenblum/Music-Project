I am calling all the last ones, who seek purpose for their Life
When you're tired of the Shit just escape from their daily Grind
There are many Rebels out there, now we're fighting Side by Side
Come along and you see that your Heart is still young and wild

Revolution will never end
Join the Union
And raise your Hand

All across the Universe
Our Voices will be heard
This is our Life and it is Prime
Come and sing along my Friend
Never walk alone again
We are the Rebels of our Time
Rebels of our Time
Hey
Hey

We all take the fucking World now
Now the young ones rule the Streets
In the Name of our fate let them hear our Freedom Beat
Wa all live a big Adventure, overcome their imposed fear
We are gathering tonight and we sing that they all can hear

Revolution will never end
Join the Union
And raise your Hand

All across the Universe
Our Voices will be heard
This is our Life and it is Prime
Come and sing along my Friend
Never walk alone again
We are the Rebels of our Time
Rebels of our Time
Hey
Hey

Oooohhooohooohhhh
Oooohhooohooohhhh
