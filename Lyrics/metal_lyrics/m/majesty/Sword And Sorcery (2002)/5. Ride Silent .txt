[Strophe 1:]
In the cold of the night, in darkness we hide.
Waiting to come out and slaughter.
Making no noise will leave them no choice.
The can not run away.

[Bridge:]
All our warriors waiting deep inside (the) Forrest.
I wait until I hear (the) command.
Deep in my heart I feel the pathos of war.

[Chorus:]
Ride Silent!
They don't know we're here.
Ride Silent!
So they can't hear.
Ride Silent!
When surpise is on our side all the enemies die.
Ride Silent!

[Strophe 2:]
Their women are crying when we're coming out.
They don't know what happened.
We cut off their heads when they come out their beds,
Before they reach their weapons.

[repeat Bridge]

[repeat Chorus]
