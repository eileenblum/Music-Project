I can feel the presence of forgotten souls of darkness
When I close my eyes I see the antic of the beast
As the night falling I can feel my inborn cruelness
My senses getting sharper when I start my bloody feast

When the moonlightâs shinning bright
I can hear the demons when they scream
A flame is burning in my mind
The fire of perdition I can feel

All day long I smile and please
But at night I will raise the beast
Hate is calling, darkness I shall seize
All night long I will raise, I will raise, raise the beast

The demon is inside me and heâs waiting for his bargain
The bloodlust is a burden which I hardly can repress
Wherever there is daylight I am feeling like a weak man
Cause night became a cloak which is infolding me to death

When the moonlightâs shinning bright
I can hear the demons when they scream
A flame is burning in my mind
The fire of perdition I can feel

All day long I smile and please
But at night I will raise the beast
Hate is calling, darkness I shall seize
All night long I will raise, I will raise, raise the beast

I will raise the beast
I will raise the beast
