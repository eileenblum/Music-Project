[Special Digipack Edition Bonus Track]In my dream I saw a fire
It was showing my desire
To believe in freedom once again
I will prove by words and doings
That I rise out of the ruins
I will show the whole world that I can

Ambition
One vision
The power deep in me
Iâm calling the forces
I will always beâ¦

Young, young, young and free
Stronger than the enemy
Young, young, young and free
Metal forces rise
Young, young, young and free
Fate is always calling me
Young, young, young and free
I will always be young and free

And I know itâs now or never
If I fight Iâll fight forever
The reward is total dignity
In the end I know my duty
It has always been inside me
Now my heart has opened finally

Ambition
One vision
The power deep in me
Iâm calling the forces
I will always beâ¦

Young, young, young and free
Stronger than the enemy
Young, young, young and free
Metal forces rise
Young, young, young and free
Fate is always calling me
Young, young, young and free
I will always be young and free
