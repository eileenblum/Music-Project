The world is wrapped in darkness, our cities are destroyed
The human race is dying is falling to the void
A sorcerer is rising, the healer of the damned
His spirit and his wisdom is all over the land

He is aiming high for victory
Crusader of the ancient seal
He is rising from the blackened sea
The sailor of the dark
Wheel of fortune is set to spin
A new era shall begin

Out of the burning ashes he fructifies the land
Heâs calling all survivers in need of every hand
He is the reborn the leader, redeemer of the truth
Building up the future, the future of the youth

He is aiming high for victory
Crusader of the ancient seal
He is rising from the blackened sea
The sailor of the dark
Wheel of fortune is set to spin
A new era shall begin

A new hope, a new beginning
Like a light in the dark
At the end the brave are winning
Feel the truth in your heart
Wheel of fortune is set to spin
A new era shall begin
