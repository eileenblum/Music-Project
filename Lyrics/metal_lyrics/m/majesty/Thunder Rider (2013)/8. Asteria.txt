From the mountains near the river
Floating wild into the sea
All my hope I now deliver
That your light shines over me


When the night is falling, guide me on my way

Asteria, Asteria
Almighty goddess of the stars
Iâm calling you, Asteria
You bring greatness to my heart
The nightshade becomes golden
When your spirit lights the dark

As I stare into the darkness
My emotions rising high
I am riding through the forest
On my journey near the sky

When your stars are shining, I can never fail

Asteria, Asteria
Almighty goddess of the stars
Iâm calling you, Asteria
You bring greatness to my heart
The nightshade becomes golden
When your spirit lights the dark

All my life I fought for justice
With your guidance on my side

Asteria, Asteria
Almighty goddess of the stars
Iâm calling you, Asteria
You bring greatness to my heart
The nightshade becomes golden
When your spirit lights the dark
