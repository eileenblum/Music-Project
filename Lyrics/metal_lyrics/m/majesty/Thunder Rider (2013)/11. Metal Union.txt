I call the ones of glory, the ones who always be free
To stand against the world with me

I heard your call my brother, among some chosen others
We all do share a mighty dream

Our destinyâs calling
A rebellion of steel
Our Metal hearts roaring
Let the enemies kneel

Metal Union
Together one by one, we sing that mighty song
We keep on fighting
Metal Union
United we all stand from all over the land
Now we are rising

We all believe in honour, there is a force upon us
A message all over the world

Itâs more than only music, it is your fate so choose it
The call of metal will be heard

Our destinyâs calling
A rebellion of steel
Our Metal hearts roaring
Let the enemies kneel

Metal Union
Together one by one, we sing that mighty song
We keep on fighting
Metal Union
United we all stand from all over the land
Now we are rising

Oh you know Iâm holy
Our powerâs revealed
Hear my Metal heart pounding
Like a war drum of steel

Metal Union
Together one by one, we sing that mighty song
We keep on fighting
Metal Union
United we all stand from all over the land
Now we are rising
