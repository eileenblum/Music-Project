Burning fire in the sky
The clouds are red when the eagles fly
My heart is filled with pride, is filled with glory

I feel the magic of the storm
Iâm marching on until the dawn
A golden future lies ahead before me

Holy truth Iâm born to bare
With my fist up high in the air

Anthem of glory
The golden time has come
Anthem of glory
The battle will be won
Voices of the heroes, sounding everywhere
Sing the anthem of glory
Brothers Iâll be there

Iâm immortal, strong as steel
The spirit in my blood is real
The fire of the dragons in my body

We all sing a that mighty hymn
Strength and glory it shall bring
The anthem is forever deep inside me

I am born to lead the fight
Our blood will guide us tonight

Anthem of glory
The golden time has come
Anthem of glory
The battle will be won
Voices of the heroes, sounding everywhere
Sing the anthem of glory
Brothers Iâll be there
