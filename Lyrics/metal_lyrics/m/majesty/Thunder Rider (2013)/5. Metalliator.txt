The demons are calling, the beast is reborn
A hybrid of mankind and steel
The Metalliator, the monster with horns
Hatred Is all he can feel

When thunder and lightning is pounding and striking
Dark mist is shading the fields
He is rising from hell heâs the son of the night
Bloodlust shall pave all his way

Oh hell is calling
War is here
Oh the world is falling into the abyss of fear

Metalliator
Servant of steel, demonâs seal
Metalliator
Powerful and raw

Heâs scouring the forest to find his prediction
He slaughters wherever he is
His body is iron, his will is to kill
And all you can hear is a hiss

The prince of damnation is here for invasion
Start running or be lacerated
The beast is upon us, there is no escape
No weapon can harm him at all

Oh hell is calling
War is here
Oh the world is falling into the abyss of fear

Metalliator
Servant of steel, demonâs seal
Metalliator
Powerful and raw
