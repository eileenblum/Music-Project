There are times in your life when you want to break free
And cry out the call of the wild
When constriction and sorrow is all you can feel
Itâs time for a change in your life

Itâs your chance to believe in renewal and fate
A chance that comes once in your life
If you want to believe you can join our cause, our fight

Join the rebellion
Rebellion of steel
Join the rebellion
Rebellion of steel
Out of the darkness weâre ruling the night
Weâre like a falcon, who flies the sky
Join the rebellion
Rebellion of steel

Now the storm shall break out, let the battle begin
The forces are ready to strike
War chants of glory our troopers will sing
The alliance will stand side by side

A rebel will always believe in his deeds
His direction is clear from the start
May the anthem of glory forever sound loud in his heart

Join the rebellion
Rebellion of steel
Join the rebellion
Rebellion of steel
Out of the darkness weâre ruling the night
Weâre like a falcon, who flies the sky
Join the rebellion
Rebellion of steel

Thunder and lightning shall take me up high to the sky
The fire is burning and now I can finally feel
The rebellion of steel

Join the rebellion
Rebellion of steel
Join the rebellion
Rebellion of steel
Out of the darkness weâre ruling the night
Weâre like a falcon, who flies the sky
Join the rebellion
Rebellion of steel
