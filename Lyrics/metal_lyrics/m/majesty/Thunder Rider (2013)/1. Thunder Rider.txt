Keeper of the sacred oath, defender of the damned
Once born as a thunder child, now youâre a stronger man
Riding on a horse of steel up in the hailing storm
Descendant of the universe, the mighty lord reborn

Youâre a sacred warrior
Forever rule the night
Sent down from the shining stars
A lightning in the sky

Thunder rider
You are flying in the wind
Thunder rider
Bring us hope and clear our sins
You are young, you are free
Youâre a son of destiny
Thunder rider
We all believe

Break the chains and free the slaves, protector of the weak
Holy, holy eagle fly and tell about his deeds
Spread his spirit everywhere, in darkness and in light
Rider, you shall heal our world with true majestic pride

Youâre a sacred warrior
Forever rule the night
Sent down from the shining stars
A lightning in the sky

Thunder rider
You are flying in the wind
Thunder rider
Bring us hope and clear our sins
You are young, you are free
Youâre a son of destiny
Thunder rider
We all believe

Sent by the fire, blessed by the wind
Raised by the eagles, heâs born to defend
Pray to the thunderâ¦THUNDER
Hail to the thunderâ¦THUNDER
Follow his path and you shall forever be free

Youâre a sacred warrior
Forever rule the night
Sent down from the shining stars
A lightning in the sky

Thunder rider
You are flying in the wind
Thunder rider
Bring us hope and clear our sins
You are young, you are free
Youâre a son of destiny
Thunder rider
We all believe
