We sail across the ocean, till our time is ending
Helmsmen letâs sail faster, our mast is bending
Oh god of wind, we sacrifice and pray to you, be on our side forevermore
Weâre chasing our enemies, theyâll pay their duty
When they see our battleship they beg for mercy
Our cannons aiming on them and our sailors raise their sabors
We will bring them war

I can still remember the day it has begun
When I heard the call I was so youngâ¦

We are sailing to be free
We will always be the warlords of the see
Filled with pride and destiny
We are born to be the warlords of the sea
Ship ahoi! Set sail for me
Warlords of the sea
Warlords of the sea
Warlords of the sea

From the golden island to the shores of wisdom
Weâre rulers of the sea, itâs our immortal kingdom
The sound of waves is cracking on our battleships but they will last eternally
Iâm standing on the prow and look across the ocean
As I feel the wind Iâm filled with pure devotion
When my time has come to leave this world my body shall be buried at sea

Look at the horizon
Sailing through the haze
Moonlight is reflecting on the waves

We are sailing to be free
We will always be the warlords of the see
Filled with pride and destiny
We are born to be the warlords of the sea
Cannons fire on enemies
Warlords of the sea

Mighty gods Iâm calling
Bless our ship with pride
Let us sail victorious tonight

Row to portside, face the wind
Let the cannons talk, the enemy shall sink
Battleâs won, forever strong

We are sailing to be free
We will always be the warlords of the see
Filled with pride and destiny
We are born to be the warlords of the sea
Ship ahoi! Set sail for me
Warlords of the sea
Warlords of the sea
Warlords of the sea
