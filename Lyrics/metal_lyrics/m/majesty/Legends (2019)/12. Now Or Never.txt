[Boxset Single]Another sleepless night
Above the city lights
I jump on roofs coz there I feel like flying
The blood inside my veins
Pounds like a hurricane
No, they can't catch me I'm always rizin'

Never, never, never I will give up the fight
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Forever I will believe, I jump into the night

I will fight, fight
For my right, right
To be who I am, it's my life
And I sing, sing
My freedom hymn
No , no more of their lies
Coz my stay is not forever
It is now or never

Well, there I stand alone
I'm feeling every bone
I live today not in the past or future
Moments like this I'd say
Are burned into my brain
Yeah, when I believe in myself I cannot be a loser
