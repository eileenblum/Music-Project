Holy, holy, holy we are
Thunder and lightning may bless our guitars
Rule the wasteland with power and steel
Got the blood of the titans, we're born to be free

The world we knew has gone away
Never it will come again, yeah
But one thing left which will remain
Our music they can't take away, yeah

When the rebels alliance's calling
One for all
When the reign of the false ones is falling
A final war

Their forces cannot track us down
So, all you rebels come around, yeah
We're cruising on the dessert rocks
With speakers on our power trucks, yeah

Full speed forward, engines on start
Our mission makes us holy
Drums are pounding, strings are sounding
We are born to ride
Yeah
