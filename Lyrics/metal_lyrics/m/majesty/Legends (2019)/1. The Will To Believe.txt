After the war, when all the cities were burning and the last signs of hope vanished in the ruins of their towers, I thought I'd be alone forever

Wandering through the wasteland, searching for some signs of hope.
Will this be the end?
No! I will not give up. This is one thing they can never take away from me:
My will to believe. 'Cause when I close my eyes I can feel my inner strength.
I can rise up to the stars and I will use this strength on my endless journey to my new home.

So all you rebels out there: Let us forge a new world, a better world, a world of freedom! And this much is certain: when our new era beginsâ¦ we are legends
