We have found our place, they will disgrace
On an island far away
They want to hunt us down
But we won't run, we stay
Let us separate from their world of hate
We have a final plan
Build our destined heroes home
And make a final stand

Dancing flame, they cannot tame
A heaven of fire, now rebels will reign

We will burn, burn, burn,
Yeah we burn, burn, burn,
Let us burn, burn, burn, the bridges
Now we burn, burn, burn,
Yes we burn, burn, burn,
We burn them to the ground
Pow, pow, pow
We will burn, burn, burn,
Yeah we burn, burn, burn,
Let us burn, burn, burn, the bridges
Now we burn, burn, burn,
Yes we burn, burn, burn,
We're hearing a cracking sound
We burn the bridges down

On a mountain high, see their rockets fly
But they can't cross the sea
We hear their screams of hate
Cause hate is all they feel
Join our mighty 'cause, when you come to us
You're welcome here, my friend
So find the path of fate
Our message has been sent

Oh oh oh
Burn the bridges
Oh oh oh
Burn 'em down

We will burn, burn, burn,
Yeah we burn, burn, burn,
Let us burn, burn, burn, the bridges
Now we burn, burn, burn,
Yes we burn, burn, burn,
We burn them to the ground
Pow, pow, pow
We will burn, burn, burn,
Yeah we burn, burn, burn,
Let us burn, burn, burn, the bridges
Now we burn, burn, burn,
Yes we burn, burn, burn,
We're hearing a cracking sound
We burn the bridges down
