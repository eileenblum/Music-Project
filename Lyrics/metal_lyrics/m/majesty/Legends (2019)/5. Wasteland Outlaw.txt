In a land of fear and hate you have found your lonely place
A rebel in the darkest maze against their aggregation
Above their cities you are free, never, ever they can see
That they never catch the demon snake inside their nation

I will stand tall
And live my dream

Rise into the night out of the light
You are a wasteland outlaw
Fight and shout it out, come turn it loud
Outlaw
When you make your stand, they understand
That you're a wasteland outlaw
No more black despair, fist in the air
Outlaw, yeah

You're cruisin' on that avenue, seeking for your inner truth
No one can explain to you why no one else is dreaming
Climbing on the highest roof, better now, always boost
Your life belongs to only you, so race until you're leavin'

High up in the clouds where the four winds blow â outlaw
I have found my place, a place where I can go â outlaw
Down right on the streets I see the subway lights â outlaw
I am calling you, the children of the night â outlaw
