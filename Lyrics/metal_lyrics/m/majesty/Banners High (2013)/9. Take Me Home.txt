Alone I stand on grey and shattered land
A cold and windy night
I found the one and he's already gone
To join my people's fight

To weak for heading back
I'm waiting to be dead
But then I see the dragon fly

Take me home
Far into the sky, over mountains we will fly
Take me home
Near the moon, into the light
Mighty dragon, take me home tonight

Above the clouds his wings are flapping loud
Like wind inside a cave
His breath like steam, I feel like if I dream
I just know that I'm safe

I feel strong and free
My wounds begin to heal
Now I know where i belong

Take me home
Far into the sky, over mountains we will fly
Take me home
Near the moon, into the light
Mighty dragon, take me home tonight

Take me home
Far into the sky, over mountains we will fly
Take me home
Near the moon, into the light
Mighty dragon, take me home tonight
