I'm standing here on a mountain high
Defender of the damned
My battle cry sounding through the air
All over the land
I'm waiting here for my time to come
To ride down to the field
The time is now, let the thunder roar
And strike with holy steel

With his hammer of doom, like a light in the gloom
He is riding in the sky
He is joining our fight, yes, he's here on our side
See the freedom in his eyes
Before the battle began, only a hand full of men
Faced the army of the dark
we had hope in our mind, but the fear made us blind
Feel his bond deep in our hearts

High from the stars
He's coming down for war
He is our chosen ally

On a mountain high
We seed the rider, guarding of time
On a mountain high
He's the avenger, pay back their crimes
From the gods he's sent to help and defend
Our folks oppression must end
Hear his battle cry
On a mountain high

He cracks their bones and their heads, all those creeps must be dead
He's bringing justice, pride and joy
Is it really the end, will our environment amend?
Start to build up what's destroyed!

But we should not be too sure, that we're safe and secure
There's a noise from far away
It sound like evil and fear and slowly it's getting near
Can he face that beast of prey

High from the stars
He's coming down for war
He is our chosen ally

On a mountain high
We seed the rider, guarding of time
On a mountain high
He's the avenger, pay back their crimes
From the gods he's sent to help and defend
Our folks oppression must end
Hear his battle cry
On a mountain high

On a mountain high
We seed the rider, guarding of time
On a mountain high
He's the avenger, pay back their crimes
From the gods he's sent to help and defend
Our folks oppression must end
Hear his battle cry
On a mountain high

I'm standing here on a mountain high
Still armed and bound to fight
Which test is still being imposed on me
I'm waiting for a sight
