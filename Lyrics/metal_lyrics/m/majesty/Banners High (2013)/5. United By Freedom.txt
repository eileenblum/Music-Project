We're here all together, the clans of our land
Declaring revolution with our banner in our hand
We can't be wrong, forever strong
Let's make a decision, the time has come to rise
We're bound by a vision of a self-determined life
Here side by side, into the night

It is our only future, it is the legacy of steel
Hail, hail, hail, hail
Forever in a union, the truth of glory we all feel
We're standing as one

United by freedom
We're living our dream
The army of the enemy is waiting on the field
In a union of glory you are not alone
You got brothers and sisters
United we are strong

Our chances uneven, but hope is deep inside
In fate we're believing, now the true ones shall defy
No more we cry, let's win or die
Let's raise our glasses and celebrate tonight
Drink until the morning, let us sing our songs with pride
A freedom heart, can't crack apart

It is our only future, it is the legacy of steel
Hail, hail, hail, hail
Forever in a union, the truth of glory we all feel
We're standing as one

United by freedom
We're living our dream
The army of the enemy is waiting on the field
In a union of glory you are not alone
You got brothers and sisters
United we are strong

United by freedom
We're living our dream
The army of the enemy is waiting on the field
In a union of glory you are not alone
You got brothers and sisters
United we are strong
