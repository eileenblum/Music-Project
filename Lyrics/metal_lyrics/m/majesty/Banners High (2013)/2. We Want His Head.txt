Here we all stand inside the castle of gods
To judge the scum worm, the deceiver
He brought destruction, he brought sorrow, death and mud
Down to our own world as a reaver

We hunt him and find him and rip all his flesh from his head
Creator of evil, the god of pure hate must be dead! So dead

We want his head
We need it
We want his head
Deceive it
Freedom shall come back again
When Dardes' work is dead
We want his head

He has created an eternal reign of doom
His creation is atrocious
We must bring balance back to lighten up his gloom
And try to cut out his necrosis

We hunt him and find him and rip all his flesh from his head
Creator of evil, the god of pure hate must be dead! So dead

We want his head
We need it
We want his head
Deceive it
His seed must be erased from man
So force and pride can spread
We want his head

By the law of the ages
His penalty's clear
We have to react to a threat
So fulfill our justice, his antic shall sear
Go, 'cause enough has been said
We want his head

We want his head
We need it
We want his head
Deceive it
Faster then the eagles fly
We'll hunt him till he's dead
We want his head

We want his head
We need it
We want his head
Deceive it
He shall hear our battle cry
We can smell his dread
We want his head
