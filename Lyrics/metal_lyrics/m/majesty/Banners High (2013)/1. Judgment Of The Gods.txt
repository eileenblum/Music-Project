A long time ago, longer than anyone can imagine, the gods
came together in their council to judge Dardes, the deceiver.

Dardes, a half god, insidious and evil, used his divine force
to create his own race of man and placed them on the Earth.
Provided with all of his dark spirits, their sole purpose was to
bring chaos to the world and to enslave all free men.

The penalty for that deed was clear. So the gods sent out
every creature in their kingdom to find the evader and bring
him to justice. All gods stood up and raised their weapons in
the sky and shouted out loud their verdict:

"We want his head!"
