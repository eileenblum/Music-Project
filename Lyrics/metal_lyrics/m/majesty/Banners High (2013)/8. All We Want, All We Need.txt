Before the battle we must face our deepest fear
We must feel our heart and our soul
We have a vision which is absolutely clear
Our people shall fight as a whole

Fire faces fire, build the barricades
Await your darkest nightmare as the evil strikes with hate
Silence will be broken, the ground will fairly burst
Don't you trust your feelings cause they even might be cursed

All we want, all we need
A miracle to unify, a sign of destiny
All we want, all we need
Our prayers shall be heard tonight by those who give belief
All we want, all we need to be free
All we want, all we need to be free is victory

We might be brave but we can't win without some help
Has the one we have sent failed his task?
We raised our banners and true freedom we all felt
But how long can those feelings last?

Fire faces fire, build the barricades
Await your darkest nightmare as the evil strikes with hate
Silence will be broken, the ground will fairly burst
Don't you trust your feelings cause they even might be cursed

All we want, all we need
A miracle to unify, a sign of destiny
All we want, all we need
Our prayers shall be heard tonight by those who give belief
All we want, all we need to be free
All we want, all we need to be free is victory

All we want, all we need
A miracle to unify, a sign of destiny
All we want, all we need
Our prayers shall be heard tonight by those who give belief
All we want, all we need to be free
All we want, all we need to be free is victory
