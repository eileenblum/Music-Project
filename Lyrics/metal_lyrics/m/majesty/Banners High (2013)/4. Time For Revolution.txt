They took our homeland, they took our fate
Stealing our harvest, our pride
Let's stand against them, it's still not too late
Claiming our godgiven right

Brothers, for freedom we need to march on
Into the battle of truth
We're lesser in number but brave hearts are strong
Believing that we shall not lose

On a path of no return
Let them cry and let them burn

Time for our life to change
Time to stand and shout
Time for our fate to range
Time for revolution
Fight till the end of time
Till we win or die
Revolution, time for revolution
Revolution

By the blood in our veins, by the law of the old
We're sending our message out loud
We find the one from the tales they have told
The tales that we all know about

We've chosen you, you are strong, you are free
Ride like a lightning tonight
Darkness, perdition and fear you will see
Never forget why we fight

Now ride fast, across the land
Our fate is in your hand

Time for our life to change
Time to stand and shout
Time for our fate to range
Time for revolution
Fight till the end of time
Till we win or die
Revolution, time for revolution
Revolution

Time for our life to change
Time to stand and shout
Time for our fate to range
Time for revolution
Fight till the end of time
Till we win or die
Revolution, time for revolution
Revolution
