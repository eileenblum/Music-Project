Now I climb, oh I climb on the tower tonight
I am raising our banner into the sky
They shall see, they shall see that we aim to be free
Our people are strong, we all sing along

Iron forces, rising hordes of fire
Higher, rising fire, burning higher
They shall know that we are strong as steel

Banners high, into the sky
Banners high
Banners high, until we die
We are raising our banners high

And I scream, yes I scream our hymn, our dream
An unselfish and decent my deed will be deemed
Follow me, follow me on the path of the free
Lead a life full of pride, we stand side by side

Iron forces, rising hordes of fire
Higher, rising fire, burning higher
They shall know that we are strong as steel

Banners high, into the sky
Banners high
Banners high, until we die
We are raising our banners high

Banners high, into the sky
Banners high
Banners high, until we die
We are raising our banners high
