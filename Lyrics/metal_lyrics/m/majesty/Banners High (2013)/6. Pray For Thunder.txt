I ride through the wasteland, a long path ahead
To call for the guardian, the one, to parry our threat
A glorious journey, a mission, so great
I ride to fulfill our dream for hope and for fate

Away in the shadows I see what I seek
The altar of wisdom, the place for my creed

Across the wasted land
I search for light
Pray for thunder tonight

I stand on the altar and pray to the gods
To send down the rider for us, against all known odds
The lightning is striking, is shaking the ground
The riding defender has come, with thundering sound

He looks in my eyes and he nods with a smile
I feel in my heart that he's here to defy

Across the wasted land
I found the light
Pray for thunder tonight

Across the wasted land
I found the light
Pray for thunder tonight

Pray for thunder
