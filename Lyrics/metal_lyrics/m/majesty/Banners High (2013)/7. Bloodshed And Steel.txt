There's blood on our axes, there's blood on our hands
We fight for our people, our ground we defend
Their army is mighty, their army is strong
They aim for our total destruction
Skull crushing noises are filling the air
War is upon us, how much can we bear
The battle is endless, it keeps going on
Death is the only seduction

There's no help, the end is near
So let's not die in fear

Fog and black fire is blinding
What will the sunlight reveal
OhOhOh bloodshed and steel
Skulls of the fallen are grinding
Bells for the dead ones will peal
OhOhOh bloodshed and steel

We seek for redemption but we must proceed
The hope of our children still lies on our deeds
Our comrades are falling, there's no time to moan
Is this our people's extinction
Still raising our banner with pride in the sky
We're fighting with honor, until we die
We're smashing their bodies and breaking their bones
We shall not die in oblivion

Pray to the immortal gods
To help us in this war

Fog and black fire is blinding
What will the sunlight reveal
OhOhOh bloodshed and steel
Skulls of the fallen are grinding
Bells for the dead ones will peal
OhOhOh bloodshed and steel

Fog and black fire is blinding
What will the sunlight reveal
OhOhOh bloodshed and steel
Skulls of the fallen are grinding
Bells for the dead ones will peal
OhOhOh bloodshed and steel
