A giant sent by the dark lord of the night
He is in fight with the rider
He's made of stone, he's got the evil inside
He's killing for his provider
The Thunder Rider can't defeat him alone
His strikes rebound from the giant
Even his magic spells can't shatter his bones
But he's remaining defiant

They see him flying
His breath is firing
The one they've sent is on the back of the drake
The giant's baffled
A flying rebel
Is in the sky and he is ready to slay

Dust and smoke is in the air
Covering the sun
Now it's time to end our despair
On the day when the battle is won

What a ruction when we look in the sky
The dragon's helping the rider
His fire's melting down the fossilized hide
The giant's feeling the fire
The Thunder Rider throws his axe in the head
Into the head of the creature
A rumbling sound proves that the giant is dead
Like smashed apart by a cleaver

The war is ending
No more defending
Let freedom spread now all over the land
A new beginning
As we are winning
Let's raise our banners up high till the end

Dust and smoke is in the air
Covering the sun
Now it's time to end our despair
On the day when the battle is won

Mighty forces on our side
Guided by our son
Shades of darkness burst by the light
On the day when the battle is won

He has crossed the wasted land
For our freedom he was proudly sent
Now he is the chosen child
Rides the dragon in the sky

Dust and smoke is in the air
Covering the sun
Now it's time to end our despair
On the day when the battle is won

Mighty forces on our side
Guided by our son
Shades of darkness burst by the light
On the day when the battle is won

Dust and smoke is in the air
Covering the sun
Now it's time to end our despair
On the day when the battle is won

We raised our banners, raised them high
The time was right to start our fight
The revolution has been won
Banners high... one by one
