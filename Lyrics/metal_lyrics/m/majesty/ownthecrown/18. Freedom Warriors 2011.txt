[Verse 1]
Riders of the underground
I want to see you rise
On a lighting
I can see the signs of freedom
Deep inside your eyes
We are riding

[Bridge]
Break these walls,
Let us fight, donât let us fall
Born to ride
Chosen ones,
Let us sing our sacred songs
âtill the night

[Chorus]
Knights hear the call
It is deep inside us all
We are fighting for glory and steel
We will ride till the dawn
We are children of the storm
All by one we are Freedom Warriors

[Verse 2]
Point your axe on enemies
and whirl it till they die
We are outlaws
We are born to rock the world
Shake it all the time
We are heroes

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[4x Chorus]
