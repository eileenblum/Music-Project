In a night of glory, a night of history
The troops began to march for revolution
Can you feel the fire? It's burning in your dreams
Set the black flame free from your illusions!

Like a falcon, flying in the storm
We're the children of the ancient riders of power and doom

We are the Metal law
Warriors, we're fighting
We are the Metal law
Never we fall
We are the Metal law
In the night we're riding
We are the Metal law
Battalion hear our call

Metal is our spirit, Metal is our soul
The scene is strong and we will make it stronger!
We're born to reign on glory, with swords and sorcery!
We keep it true, our hearts are filled with honor!

Holy riders, riding with the wind
Sacred fighters on a quest, let our voices be heard!

We are the Metal law
Warriors, we're fighting
We are the Metal law
Never we fall
We are the Metal law
In the night we're riding
We are the Metal law
Battalion hear our call

We are the Metal law
Warriors, we're fighting
We are the Metal law
Never we fall
We are the Metal law
In the night we're riding
We are the Metal law
Battalion hear our call
