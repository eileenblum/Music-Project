[Verse 1]
When the thunder is calling and the nightshade is falling
See the falcon in the storm
I will ride âtill the morning, âtill the sunlight is coming
By the star I was reborn

I feel the cold of the winter but my mind still remembers
That true freedom is my reward
After years of oppression, a demonic possession
I can finally feel my heart 

[Bridge]
Through the darkness I ride to be free
And the moonlightâs still shining on me

[2x Chorus]
We Own the crown
âCause we are Majesty
We own the crown
And we are bound to believe

[Verse 2]
I was alone in the silence, choked by falseness and violence
But I found a strong belief
Found some sisters and brothers, all for one âgainst the other
Strength and honour we all seize

As our legion gets stronger, we canât wait any longer
By an oath of glory weâre bound
We are born to be heroes and we know that our time comes
When we are reaching for the crown

[Bridge]

[2x Chorus]

[Solo]

[Bridge 2]
And I swear that Iâll always believe
I will give all my blood to be free

[4x Chorus]
