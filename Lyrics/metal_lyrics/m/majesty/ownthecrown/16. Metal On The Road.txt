[Verse 1]
Another night, let us enter the bus
Heading down on the road
Getting out when the weels standing still
Another city to rock

[Verse 2]
Enter the stage, dim the light of the hall
We are swearing the oath
With Metal sound, let the drums shake the ground
Letâs get out of control

[Bridge]
Iâm standing, demanding
My power rising high when the crowd is screaming for me
My heart is forever free

[Chorus]
Metal on the road
Metal on the road
Metal on the road
Out of control

[Verse 3]
We live a life full of glory and might
Heard the ultimate call
Our armyâs strong evârywhere in the world
Bound forever as one

[Verse 4]
All those girls waiting after the show
They are playing our game
After the gig when the tension is hot
Theyâre reliefing our strain

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Chorus - silent]

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[4x Chorus]
