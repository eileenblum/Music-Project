When firestorms of craziness come screaming through the air
The beasts of night are howling out, theyâre storming everywhere
A crimson tide of energy erupting from the ground
The gates of hell are shattered wide, by evilectric sounds

Demolition organized by penetrating rage
Close your eyes and lock the door, incarcerated cage
The flame of fear is burning high, Lord Luciferâs revenge
The spirits are all set to start their demonising days

Breakinâ down the walls now, seeking for revenge
With hateful domination, the demon hordes are sent

Hellforces, we are ruling the night
Join the hellforces, call the bringer of light
Hellforces

Now heavy metal maniacs emerging on the stage
Bringing you the sound of hell with fury and with rage
The force of hell shall rule the night, so call me metal son
The sky is turning red as blood, the battle has begun

Breakinâ down the walls now, seeking for revenge
With hateful domination, the demon hordes are sent

Hellforces, we are ruling the night
Join the hellforces, call the bringer of light
Hellforces

My flaming heart is beating with anger and with hate
Mothers of the chosen ones await to hear their fate
Tell me is this fantasy or is it just a dream
No, it is reality, believe what you have seen

23 red doom stars shining in the sky
The circle of the chosen ones is bounded by a sign
A union of the blackened souls, the children of the night
I know as you are standing here, that you have chosen your side

Hellforces, we are ruling the night
Join the hellforces, call the bringer of light
Hellforces
