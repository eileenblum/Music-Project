We are the sons of a new millennium, let the revolution begin
So watch tonight the storm will come
And we are born again

Stand up for a reason, shout out with one voice
No longer retreating, kick down all of the doors
Forever we're fighting, see the truth in the words
Let 'em speak all around the world, let them be heard

We are the sons of a new millennium, let the revolution begin
So watch tonight the storm will come
And we are born again

We are made for a free world, no more cheating and fakes
Let us fight for a new way, before it's too late
Join the revolution, you should believe in yourself
Because you are strong, a millennium son

We are the sons of a new millennium, let the revolution begin
So watch tonight the storm will come
And we are born again

The vision's everywhere, let freedom reign
No one can stop us now, the end of their game

We are the sons of a new millennium, let the revolution begin
So watch tonight the storm will come
And we are born again

We are the sons of a new millennium, let the revolution begin
So watch tonight the storm will come
And we are born again

We are the sons of a new millennium, let the revolution begin
So watch tonight the storm will come
And we are born again
