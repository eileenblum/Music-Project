The strengh of the wind and the power of the night.
They are always in me, they'll always guide.
Might of steel is what I feel.
I am a rebel, my feelings are real.

The power of Metal is my pride.
Yes I am the chosen one.
I am the Metal son
By the wind, the Moon, the stars and the Sun
I am the Metal son

Magic and fire are taking me higher,
as high as the mountains which I admire.
Some people always cry, I know they will die.
But I'll life forever cause Metal is on my side.

The power of Metal is my pride.
I'm almighty, I am so strong
I am the Metal son
All my brothers sing this song
I am the Metal son

The power of Metal is my pride.
Yes I am the chosen one.
I am the Metal son
By the wind, the Moon, the stars and the Sun
I am the Metal son

Yes I am the chosen one.
I am the Metal son
By the wind, the Moon, the stars and the Sun
I am the Metal son

I'm almighty, I am so strong
I am the Metal son
All my brothers sing this song
I am the Metal son

Yes I am the chosen one.
I am the Metal son
By the wind, the Moon, the stars and the Sun
I am the Metal son

I'm almighty, I am so strong
I am the Metal son
All my brothers sing this song
I am the Metal son

I am the Metal son
I am the Metal son
I am the Metal son
I am
I am... the Metal son
