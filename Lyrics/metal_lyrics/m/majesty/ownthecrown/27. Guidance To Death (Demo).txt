[Verse 1]
Born as a tortured sinner, let me guide you to your grave
I was born to be the winner in this game of death and faith
You can try to fight me but I know you gonna fail
I will take you to a place where you can rest in peace 

[Verse 2]
I know you think youâre dreaming but feel my hand of steel
Itâs a frightening nightmare which is now becoming real
Your time on earth is over and thereâs no use to cry
Say your final prayers âcause no you have to die!

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
Your body is getting colder, your soul will be erased
Your heart is getting older, I see fear in your face
Your journey of life is over, say good bye to the light
Close your eyes forever, I will guide you into the night
