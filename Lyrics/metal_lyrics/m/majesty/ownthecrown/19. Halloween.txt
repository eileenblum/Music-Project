[Chorus]
The serpant sign, the chosen one
Now the demons waiting for the night to come
The sound of thunder, a bloody scene
Everybody screams
On Halloween

[Verse 1]
Deep in the shadow thereâs a beast of hate
Awaiting his time to come
The bringer of darkness will fulfill his fate
All know it is Satanâs son

[Bridge]
They heard the call, Demonic knights
Their spirits sent into the night

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
The houses are burning when the witches fly
They search for some virgin blood
Theyâre hunting the weak who know are bound to die
May their corpses rot

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Interlude]
The spirits are waiting, now dark souls awake
The red moon is rising, a night filled with hate
The black beast is calling, demonic its scream
A heart filled with anger on Halloween

[2x Chorus]
