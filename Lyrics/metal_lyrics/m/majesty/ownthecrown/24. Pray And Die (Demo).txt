[Prelude]
In a time when the evil stats to rise
A time, when fire burns in your eyes
Emotionally destructed, frightened and depressed every day
Heavy stones and barriers made of blood on your way
The only thing you can do is cry
Pray And Die

[Verse 1]
Everything is terrorized, everthingâs burned down
Everybodyâs telling lies, when you wlak around
You donât know where to go, no place you can hide
And they will get you soon, no chance to fight

[4x Chorus]
Pray And Die

[Verse 2]
All the friend you had are dead. All you knew is gone
Destruction lies ahead. The way is so long
Youâre tired and your body hurts, blood is on your hands
And if you think you surviveâ¦ there is no chance

[4x Chorus]

[Solo]
