[Verse 1]
The time of fear is over
Hope is in your eyes
I feel pride and power again
I am walking through the forest
The thunder roars again
I hope this situation will never change 

[Bridge]
I am walking around, Iâm not alone
The wind is on my side

[2x Chorus]
Snow is on the mountain
And the stars are lighting the sky
As bright as a fire fountain
They will guide our people tonight

[Verse 2]
Thereâs life in every corner
Celebration everywhere
Tonight we feel like winners
Weâve got might
The mountains  âround the valley
Are a symbol of our life
They show hope and glory
Every night

[2x Chorus]

[Solo]

[4x Chorus]
