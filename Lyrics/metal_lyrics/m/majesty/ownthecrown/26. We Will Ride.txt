Here we stand together,
Our eyes are filled with pride.
Dreaming 'bout the future
And the glory of our fight.
Our hearts are filled with power.
Holy eagle spread your wings.
Victory will be ours
And than we will be kings.

The gods of war will be on our side.
They'll give us strength,
They'll give us pride.
And we will fight together when we will ride.
Let your skeptics fly apart
We will fight with a metal heart.
Our enemies will kneel and we will ride.
We will ride

After our victory
Our kingdom will be wide.
Friends, we will be with you
We'll be standing side by side.
And the enemies of our kingdom
They will feel the power of steel.
We'll fight together
Hail to Majesty

The gods of war will be on our side.
They'll give us strength,
They'll give us pride.
And we will fight together when we will ride.
Let your skeptics fly apart
We will fight with a metal heart.
Our enemies will kneel and we will ride.
We will ride

The gods of war will be on our side.
They'll give us strength,
They'll give us pride.
And we will fight together when we will ride.
Let your skeptics fly apart
We will fight with a metal heart.
Our enemies will kneel and we will ride.

The gods of war will be on our side.
They'll give us strength,
They'll give us pride.
And we will fight together when we will ride.
