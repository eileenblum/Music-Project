As the moon is rising
We will on fighting.
The stars are shining bright in the night.
Thunder in the silence, 
coming down in violence.
The fire in the sky is our guide.

We hear the sound of forest,
it's a mystery.
We are fighting our battle
For the right to be free.
The wind of destruction going through the trees.
Never look down, there is nothing you can see.

Into the night

Never try to stop us.
No chance for you to rush.
Don't forget this or you will die.
As the night is over.
We're stopping our maneuver
And do a final look in the sky.
