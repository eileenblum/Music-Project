The battlefield is set, we're here to attack.
Sworn to fulfill our dream.
When the lightning strikes down and the falcon comes out
My heart feels strong as steel.
Our union is strong but, our crusade is long
We're marching until victory.
With honor and truth our weapons are used.
Never stop until we're free

Heroes of Metal now join our crusade.
The armies are marching again!

Heavy Metal battlecry
Echoes in the mountains high.
Heavy Metal battlecry
Hail! Hail! Hail!
Heavy Metal battlecry
Fight until we win or die!
Heavy Metal battlecry
Hail! Hail! Hail!

The drums shake the ground, the guitars shall sound
Like the fire of hell. You know what that means!
All of this place is rumbled by bass.
Can you hear my mighty screams?
This band's born to rock. Our battle won't stop.
So join our legions with pride.
But if you don't like our style fuck off and die!
Dig a grave and take your lies!

Heroes of Metal now join our crusade.
The armies are marching again!

Brothers hear my Heavy Metal battlecry.
It echoes in the mountains through the sky.
The oath to keep it true forever in my mind.
See the spikes on my leather dress
And the patches on my denim vest.
They are symbols of a life fulfilled with pride.
Heavy Metal never dies!
