[Verse 1]
There was a strong man, who fought for his believes.
Died on the battlefield with honor, not with grief.

There was a rebel who fought the evil force.
He took the crown, became the leader of the north.

There was a young man, only 15 years of age.
But felt honor in his heart, became a leader not a slave.

There was a servant, who didn't want to serve.
Well, he was killed but his rebel call was heard.

[Bridge]
Warrior, you heard a call
Guiding you to the brave men's hall.
To the brave men's hall.

[Chorus]
Heroes have burdens to bear.
Heroes can't be found everywhere.

[Verse2]
There was a father, the evil asked what he could give.
He gave his own life, so his family could live.

There was a soldier, on the frontline he did kill.
Defends his people with proud heart and iron will.

There was a coward man, who flew from the attack.
He grew old a hundred years, but he died weak in his bed.

There was a hero, who fought with steel. All Hail!!!
Well, he died young but for thousand years they told his tale.

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

Born to be a Hero, I'll fight against their lies.
For my sisters, for my brothers I would give my life.
So if my clan is calling, my sword is on your side.
For glory and for freedom. For wisdom and for might.

[Chorus]

[Finale]
I'll always live adventure, returning to the fields.
I'm born to reign in glory, I'll always fight for steel.
BORN TO BE A HERO

I'd rather die in battle than run away and pray.
When my bones are dieing, my deeds will all prevail.
BORN TO BE A HERO

We are a sacred army, the troops of iron pride.
We're here to kill deceivers, deceivers we will fight.
BORN TO BE A HERO

When we die in battle, I know where we will go.
The gods up in Valhalla await their sacred sons
BORN TO BE A HERO
