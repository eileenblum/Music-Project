[Prelude]
I am sleeping in the dark.
There is blackness in my heart.
I'm calling to the gods.
Give me the power for my march.

[Verse 1]
Up in the highlands, there's wisdom and silence.
Where thunder and wind is in the air.
My spirit was sleeping. Enbodied and deepened
Down in an unholy sphere.

And now it's been wakened. The mountains were shaking.
A rumble accured in the sky.
My eyes start to see and my old wounds are bleeding.
I know I was sent back to life

[Bridge]
Down in the halls I was chained down to the ground.
I lost my power.
But now these chains broke and I know
This is my hour.

[Chorus]
I, I am the leader of men and land.
I, I am the captain, so I command.
Born to be the ruler, they hail my throne.
I free the land by the oath that I've sworn.
Like a falcon in the storm.

[Verse 2]
I'm settling my black horse to ride on my old course
Down to the fortress I know.
The path down the valley, once built like an alley,
Is destroyed, but I know where to go.

I feel true power, as I see the old tower.
It is covered with snow in the storm.
As my people now see me. My brothers, my army.
They welcome their leader with horns.

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

When the cold wind blows throughout the trees
And the snow is falling down.
Than a rider knows his destiny,
Because he knows the gods are calling him so loud.

Let us ride over the fields of war.
Follow me into the night.
See the valkries flying through the stars.
Let us win or let us fall to earth with pride.

[Chorus]
