[based on a forthcomming novel by Tarek "MS" Maghary]

[Verse 1]
A bloodred moon, a landscape black and grey.
A rotting graveyard, bones are on it's ways.
There we're standing, black robes we wear.
To call the master of evil. He'll be there.

Hate is in our heart. The rhyte is starting.
We cast the secret spell. He will awake.
Let his spirit rise to bring the darkness
Right over the land, under his command.

We're here to give you blood, to give you power.
We sacrifice a gift, a virgin girl.
Get out of your grave, oh Lord of darkness.
Your children will await to slaughter in your name.

[Chorus]
Lord of the damned
You rule the land
Lord of the damned
Give us command
Lord of the damned

[Verse 2]
The fire is burning, flaming red as blood.
A giant cauldron. Dead meat we're heating up.
The stars are falling, the sky is black.
We praise your glory. Lord please come back.

Smoke is turning up out of the earth now.
The virgin starts to cry, she feels the pain.
We're falling on our knees to praise your glory.
The children of the night. In your hand we lay our lifes.

We look into your eyes, our hearts are beating.
We will sacrifice, give us command.
You're the horned king, so you shall lead us.
Awaiting your desire. Come to us tonight.

[Chorus]
[Bridge]

666 - The great storm has begun
666 - Your time has come
666 - You shall be our guide.
Werewolfs barking az the moon.
You bring them doom.
Show them death tonight.

[Finale]
You are our only master, the reason why we live.
Turn the rivers red, darken the night.
You bring the world desaster.You make the dead alive.
23 red doomstars in the sky.

Demon, Demon, Demon
Get out of your grave.
Demon, Demon, Demon
Get out of your grave.
Demon, Demon, Demon
Ritual of the brave.
Demon, Demon, Demon
Get out of your grave

And show us all your wisdom, spread it throughout the land
All the worls shall fear the horned king.
Built the evil kingdom, your armies will defend.
Hymns of the forgotten rhymes we sing.

Demon, Demon, Demon
Get out of your grave.
Demon, Demon, Demon
Get out of your grave.
Demon, Demon, Demon
Ritual of the brave.
Demon, Demon, Demon
Get out of your grave

[Lord of the Damned:]
"I salute you, my servants.
You brought me back to life.
I will cover the sun with blackness.
My kingdom shall be spread out wide.
Let everyone kneel in fear.
Doom shall reign.
May blood flow in the rivers.
Let the order go insane."
