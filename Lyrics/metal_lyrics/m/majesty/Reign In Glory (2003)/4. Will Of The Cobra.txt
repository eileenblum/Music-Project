In golden times of dawn, a union proud and strong
Was born to rule the earth.
Their symbol was a snake. Their eyes were full of hate
And than their god accurded:

[Snakegod:]
"I am your only god, so you shall never stop.
Spread my wisdom throughout the land!"

[Clan of the Cobra:]
"You are the one and we are your soldiers.
With pride our warriors will stand.
Yes we are strong. We got the Will of the Cobra.
We're born to rule the world again."

And than the war began. A thousand willing men
With hammers, swords and shields.
They fought with hand and blade, built churches for the snake.
And prayed for victory.

And than the snakegod laughed. Looked at his game of chess.
Sent a blast, destroyed the earth.

[Clan of the Cobra:]
"You are the one and we are your soldiers.
With pride our warriors will stand.
Yes we are strong. We got the Will of the Cobra.
We will spread the fire.
That is our heart desire.
We're born to rule the world again."
