[Verse 1]
In the times when the clans ruled the land.
The ground filled with blood of true heroes.
When children have killed on command.
The lord of the damned brought them nightfall.

[Bridge]
"Up In the sky
I heard a call.
I'm on my way to bring them glory.
I'm sworn to ride
Until I fall.
I am the one, their chosen son.

[Chorus]
They are calling me defender
Defender of the brave
Never I surrender
My mission is to stay."

[Verse 2]
When all of the hope they once had
Was killed by their final surrender.
There's one chance to go, they all said.
So they called for the chosen defender.

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

"The sky is bright, the stars all shine.
I feel the wind of cold december.
My given right to wear the sign,
To carry the sword of the defender.
Up In the sky I heard a call.
I'm on my way to bring them glory.
I'm sworn to ride until I fall.
I am the one, their chosen son."

[Chorus]
