We are the sons of a new millennium, let the revolution begin
So watch tonight the storm will come
And we are born again

Stand up for a reason, shout out with one voice
No longer retreating, kick down all of the doors
Forever weâre fighting, see the truth in the words
Let âem speak all around the world, let them be heard

We are the sons of a new millennium, let the revolution begin
So watch tonight the storm will come
And we are born again

We are made for a free world, no more cheating and fakes
Let us fight for a new way, before itâs too late
Join the revolution, you should believe in yourself
Because you are strong, a millennium son

We are the sons of a new millennium, let the revolution begin
So watch tonight the storm will come
And we are born again

The visionâs everywhere, let freedom reign
No one can stop us now, the end of their game

We are the sons of a new millennium, let the revolution begin
So watch tonight the storm will come
And we are born again
