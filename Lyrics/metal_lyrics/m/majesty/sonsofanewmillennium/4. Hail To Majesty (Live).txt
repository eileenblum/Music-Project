The crowd is here, the stage is set,
The fire starts to burn
All are ready for a final rage
Feel the Metal-Atmosphere
Ready to attack
Now it's time for us to go on stage

Guitars screaming loud in the air
The magic, the power is there
And the moonlight is shining on me
Raise your swords in the air for Majesty

The drums shall shake the ground
With Metal-sound
Forever bound
We will always play,
Every night
And every day

Forever we will raise our sword,
Forever we will fight
Play our music till the end of time
The Amplifiers getting hot,
The rhythm is loud and tight
Everyone of you show me the sign

Guitars screaming loud in the air
The magic, the power is there
And the moonlight is shining on me
Raise your swords in the air for Majesty

The drums shall shake the ground
With Metal-sound
Forever bound
We will always play,
Every night
And every day
