Deep in the forest of wisdom
High on the mountains we found resort
Honoured our ancient religion
The secrets of the world

For centuries the old ones had told of
The riders of dragons - the sacred ones
High in the clouds they were calling
ThereÂ´s magic in their words

Deep in our halls youÂ´ll find them
Our written chronicles
Knowing that only the chosen
Can take wind to the stars

Dragon come over sea - we will fly eternally
Hear the anthem that we sing
We are children on the wing
Take me high to the sky - our spirit will prevail
We are guardians of the dragon grail

Breaking through wind and through fire
Dragon - letÂ´s fly to the crimson shores
Freedom is all we desire
A bond without a care

Over mountains and rivers
Over the land thereÂ´s a mystic force
I know the red moon will guide us
Through the northern air

Deep in our halls youÂ´ll find them
Our written chronicles
Knowing that only the chosen
Can take wind to the stars

Dragon come over sea - we will fly eternally
Hear the anthem that we sing
We are children on the wing
Take me high to the sky - our spirit will prevail
We are guardians of the dragon grail

Times have changed - years gone by
I see sadness in your eyes
Mighty dragon fly the earth
Leave all sorrow from this verse
Let us rise into night
Where our dreaming cannot fail
We are guardians of the dragon grail

Dragon come over sea - we will fly eternally
Hear the anthem that we sing
We are children on the wing
Take me high to the sky - our spirit will prevail
We are guardians of the dragon grail
