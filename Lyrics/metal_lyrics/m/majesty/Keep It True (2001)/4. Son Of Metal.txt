The strengh of the wind and the power of the night.
They are always in me, they'll always guide.
Might of steel, is what I feel.
I am a rebel, my feelings are real.

The power of Metal is my pride.

Yes I am the chosen one.
(I'm almighty and I'm so strong)
I am a Metal-son.
By the wind, the moon, the stars and the sun
(All my brothers sing this song)
I am a Metal-son

Magic and fire are taking me higher, 
as high as the mountains which I admire.
Some people always cry, I know they will die.
But I'll life forever cause Metal is on my side.
