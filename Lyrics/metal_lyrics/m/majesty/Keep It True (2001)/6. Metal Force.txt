The wind blows loud and wild.
Tells me that I am his sacred child.
And I know that the flames of war will burn.
I'm on a path of no return.
I feel it deep inside, it's a part of me.
The magic of the night.
I will always believe!

I am a warrior
Metal Force
Guided by the stars
Metal Force
My sword is always by my side
Metal Force
Blessed with majestic pride
Heavy Metal Force

Through the dark I ride
And I know that the force is by my side.
It is still a long, long way to go.
But at the end we have conquered you all.
