The secret gate will close
in a few moments of time, 
but we will go through it.
The fastest way we choose,
riding through the night.
Not afraid, not a little bit.

[Bridge:]
We're riding on.
Don't know how long.

[Chorus:]
Strong as steel
Stark wie Stahl

The dragon is awaiting us, he is big and strong, 
but we are not afraid.
We look into his eyes, showing him our steel

And kill him with pride.
