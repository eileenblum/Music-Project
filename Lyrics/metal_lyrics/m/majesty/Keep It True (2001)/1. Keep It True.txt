I turned on the radio, it shocked me, yes it did.
I heard some dolls of media, interesting like a piece of shit
I turned it off and swore an oath, if I'll break it I shall die
I will fight for Metal the rest of my life

[Chorus:]
If you're playing Rock 'n' Roll, play it without lies.
Always be as brave and proud like an eagle in the sky.
If you want to be remembered, there is one thing you should do
When you play your music (you) gotto KEEP IT TRUE

If you look at the Billboard-Charts, position one to ten.
They change every fucking day, short is every trend!
Now it's time to raise your hands and tell them what we like:
Heavy Metal, loud and wild.
