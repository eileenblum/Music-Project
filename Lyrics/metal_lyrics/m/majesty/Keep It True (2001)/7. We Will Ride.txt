Here we stand together, 
our eyes are filled with pride.
Dreaming 'bout our future
and the glory of our fight.
Our hearts are filled with power.
Holy eagle spread your wings.
Victory will be ours
and than we will be kings.

The gods of war will be on our side.
They'll give us strength, 
they'll give us pride.
We will fight together when we will ride.
Let your sceptics fly a part
We will fight with a metal heart.
Our enemies will kneel and we will ride.

After our victory, our kingdom will be wide.
Friends, we will be with you. We'll be standing side by side.
And the enemies of our kingdom will feel the power of steel.
We'll fight together. Hail to MAJESTY!
