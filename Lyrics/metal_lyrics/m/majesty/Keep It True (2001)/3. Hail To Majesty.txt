The crowd is here, the stage is set, 
the fire starts to burn.
All are ready for a final rage.
Feel the Metal-Atmosphere.
Ready to attack.
Now it's time for us to go on stage.

[Bridge:]
Guitars screaming loud in the air
The magic, the power is there.
And the moonlight is shining on me.
Raise your swords in the air for MAJESTY.

[Chorus:]
The drums shall shake the ground
With Metal-sound
Forever bound.
We will always play, 
every night
and every day.

Forever we will raise our sword,
forever we will fight.
Play our music till the end of time.
The Amplifiers getting hot, 
the rythm is loud and tight.
Everyone of you show me the sign.
