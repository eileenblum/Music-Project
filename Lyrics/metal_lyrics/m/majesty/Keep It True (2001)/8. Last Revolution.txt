The king is bad, the king is cruel.
I don't like the way he rules.
False corruption, slavery.
You know that's true, so follow me.
We can break our chains 'cause we are strong.
The last revolution.
Oh the king shall be dead.
Raise your swords, we want this head.

Follow me and we will win.

On your horses, it's time to go.
Battle hymns we sing.
I'll guide you to victory.
I'll be the new king.
We are mighty, yes we are.
Our power is for real.
The last revolution is made of steel.

Steel meets steel, fire heats
On this bloody battlefield.
Many died, yes indeed.
We ended it in victory.
I caught the king, for mercy he begged.
I took my sword and cut off his head.
His body broke down on the grass.
Yes we kicked his god damn ass.

A new era is beginning of glory, pride and winning,
because of me.
Thank you for believing, we'll celebrate this evening.
No more slavery.
I take the crown with glory, I'm writing history.
I'm your new king
A night to remember, no more fear and anger.
Time to sing.
We got the glory and the believe.
A new beginning, a new spring, all hail now
I am your new king!
