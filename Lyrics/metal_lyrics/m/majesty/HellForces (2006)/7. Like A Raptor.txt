It's late at night in Central Park
You want to see me but it's much too dark
And I just crave who you are

You are staring, I see your soul
You can feel my presence, but it's cold, so cold
'Cause I know your fear of the night

Looking with dark eyes, they're aiming at you
Better move and run anywhere
Into the shadows, I know what to do
You can scream but nobody cares

I will hunt you like a raptor
Like a raptor, hunt you like a raptor
Like a raptor honey
Like a raptor, like a raptor

You can hear my breathing and the closer I get
Look around one last time, you know that you're next
And now I am not far behind

I'm dealing with the devil and I know all his tricks
Dialling up my number, it is 666
And I, I will get you tonight

Looking with dark eyes, they're aiming at you
Better move and run anywhere
Into the shadows, I know what to do
You can scream but nobody cares

I will hunt you like a raptor
Like a raptor, hunt you like a raptor
Like a raptor honey
Like a raptor, like a raptor
