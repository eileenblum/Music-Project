I'm living fast, that's how I am
I'll never be a nowhere man
Stand up and fight to make a stand
I'll never be a nowhere man

Hey you, live the road ahead
Hey you, you can rest when you are dead
Hey you, don't you be afraid
Hey you, there is no more time to wait

Don't me messin', just leave 'em guessing
You can be free, don't you believe me

I'm living fast, that's how I am
I'll never be a nowhere man
Stand up and fight to make a stand
I'll never be a nowhere man

Hey you, time to turn around
Hey you, you can tear the borders down
Hey you, you are strong not weak
Hey you, you should make up from your sleep

Don't be messin', just leave 'em guessing
You can be free, don't you believe me

I'm living fast, that's how I am
I'll never be a nowhere man
Stand up and fight to make a stand
I'll never be a nowhere man
