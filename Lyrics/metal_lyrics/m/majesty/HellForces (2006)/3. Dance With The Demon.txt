Hear the devil calling, he's calling my name
So take the demon ride up on the road of fear and pain
When the wind is howling and the sunlight is fading away
I'm driving down the highway with my old black Chevrolet

Oh, rock 'n' roll
Is always present in my soul
Oh, rock 'n' roll
Into the Reich of darkness we will go

Dance with the demon

It's getting close to midnight, hear the raven scream
When the night is falling I'm a marching steel machine
Oh, they all feared me, tried to punish me and send me to hell
But there's one thing they've forgotten: that I like it down there well

And I know what to do
I'm on the devil's rendezvous
Oh, rock 'n' roll
Into the Reich of darkness we will go
Come on, come on, come on

Dance with the demon, come and dance with the demon
Dance with the demon, come and dance with the demon
With the demon
