In a night of glory, a night of history
The troops began to march for revolution
Can you feel the fire, it's burning in your dreams
Set the black flame free from your delusions

Like a falcon flying in the storm
We're the children of the ancient riders of power and doom

We are the metal law, warriors we're fighting
We are the metal law, never we fall
We are the metal law, in the night we're riding
We are the metal law, battalions
Battalions hear our call

Metal is our spirit, metal is our soul
Hellfire and damnation is our amour
We're born to reign in glory, with sword and sorcery
We keep it true, our hearts are filled with honour

Like a falcon flying in the storm
We're the children of the ancient riders of power and doom

We are the metal law, warriors we're fighting
We are the metal law, never we fall
We are the metal law, in the night we're riding
We are the metal law, battalions
Battalions hear our call
