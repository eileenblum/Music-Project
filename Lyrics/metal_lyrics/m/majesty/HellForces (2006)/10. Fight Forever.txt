In times of war and insanity
You should fight for your destiny
When they try to destroy your hope
There is only one way to go

Get a life, free yourself, play no games, seek your revenge
Get it right, rule the night, break the chains, show them you can

Fight forever, when you're the blinding light
Stand together, forever free and right
Fight forever

When the world is all over for me
I hit right back, I am hard as steel
I'm a winner and that's for sure
Break the law and unlock the doors

Get a life, free yourself, play no games, seek your revenge
Get it right, rule the night, break the chains, show them you can

Fight forever, when you're the blinding light
Stand together, raise your voices high
Fight forever, always side by side
Stand together, forever free and right
Fight Forever
