There are times of sorrow, of desperate cries
But you should never lose your hope
There's a bright tomorrow, if you try
The winds of fate will bring you home

There are always people who say you won't
But you should know that they just lie
If you really want to live your dreams
You can reach the sky

In the night the crimson light is bleeding
A new life shall start with a freedom heart
Call aloud and never stop believing
When there's only one reward, a freedom heart
A freedom heart

In a world of fire, of broken dreams
On the road of fear and hate
You must stand for freedom, for your beliefs
It may be dark but not too late

Don't let them ever tell you that you're too small
'Cause your fate comes from within
You are strong forever, you heard the call
Of a new spring

In the night the crimson light is bleeding
A new life shall start with a freedom heart
Call aloud and never stop believing
When there's only one reward, a freedom heart
A freedom heart

Beyond the stormy weather, we can find the stars
We can work together, and you'll feel your thundering heart

In the night the crimson light is bleeding
A new life shall start with a freedom heart
Call aloud and never stop believing
When there's only one reward, a freedom heart
A freedom heart
