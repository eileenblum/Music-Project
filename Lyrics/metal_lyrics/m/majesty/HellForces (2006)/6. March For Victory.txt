Heat of the night caused by flames of war
Burning in the moonlight
When the soldiers unite for a sacred law
And the armies march through lands wide

In the valley the eagles soared
And heard the trumpets report

Ride over the mountains, head to the northern sea
Spreading the words like a fountain
And march for victory

A mission ahead, which shall be fulfilled
We secure the borders
Our kingdom is strong when the blood is spilled
Of those who fell before us

In the valley the eagles soared
And heard the trumpets report

Ride over the mountains, head to the northern sea
Spreading the words like a fountain
And march for victory

Ride over the mountains, head to the northern sea
Spreading the words like a fountain
And march for victory
Desolation messiah
