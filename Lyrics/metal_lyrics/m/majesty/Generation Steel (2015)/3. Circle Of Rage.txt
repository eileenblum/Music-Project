The tyrants of destruction, emerging from the sky
Invaders came, they brought us pain, and many of us died
But now we strike, yes we shall strike
But children of true fury can not be torn apart
In unity, we're standing free with glory in our hearts
And we will fight, now we will fight

The battlefield is ours and we will never kneel
We are mighty warriors, the generation steel

Blood in the sky when the infidels cry
Justice will end all their hate
The enemies die or they rot in a cage
Come join the circle of rage

We are the chosen army, defending our fate
Freedom is our holy good which they can never take
And we will stay, yes we will stay
All over the wasteland the free ones shall unite
Far away from our homes we're fighting for our right
We're far away, so far away

The flame of revolution is burning in the sky
Forever we defend our right against their rancid lies

Blood in the sky when the infidels cry
Justice will end all their hate
The enemies die or they rot in a cage
Come join the circle of rage

Rage is our power, our infinite soul
Rage is our passion, the force of control
Rage is the way to be self-paced, invictous and free
Rage is the fury inside of us all
Rage is for heroes who fight and stand tall
Rage is our homes, on the fields, in the halls, on the stage
Born in the circle of rage

Blood in the sky when the infidels cry
Justice will end all their hate
The enemies die or they rot in a cage
Come join the circle of rage
