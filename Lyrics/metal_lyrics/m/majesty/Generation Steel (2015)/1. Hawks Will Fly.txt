Out of the darkness they're coming
Daemons so evil and dark
Over our borders they're running
Adjecting our kingdom, our heart

Time for the sacred alliance
Ancestors ... every night
The one who has speed and defiance
To tirense that all of the blind

We call the hawk
Out of the dark
We call the hawk
To be our guide

[Chorus:]
Hawks will fly
Up in the stormy sky
Hawks will fly
Our troopers shall unite
And tonight we all remember
We're sons of the defender
Fist up high
When hawks will fly

High on the towers we're calling
Sons of the chosen unite
The enemies coming to pall in
But dignity strong on our side

We will fight darkness with fire
Marching to battle tonight
Follow our ardent desire
Defend our fortress with pride

We call the hawk
Out of the dark
We call the hawk
To be our guide

[Chorus:]
Hawks will fly
Up in the stormy sky
Hawks will fly
Our troopers shall unite
And tonight we all remember
We're sons of the defender
Fist up high
When hawks will fly
