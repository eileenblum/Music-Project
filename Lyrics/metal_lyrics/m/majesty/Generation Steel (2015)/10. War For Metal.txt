Siblings of the fire, have you heard the call
Black wolves are howling our names
Hawks are rising higher, flying for us all
The kingdom is covered in flames

Hail to the chosen defenders
March 'till our kingdom is free

When the giant's calling we hear the command
On a war for metal we are sent
Let us march for glory with swords in our hand
War For Metal 'till the end
On A War For Metal
Into the battle
War For Metal 'till the end

We are the sons of metal and steel is in our blood
MAJESTY is our name, Hail, Hail
On stage we start the battle, the air is getting hot
We're keeping it true, never fail

Hail to the chosen defenders
March 'till our kingdom is free

When the giant's calling we hear the command
On a war for metal we are sent
Let us march for glory with swords in our hand
War For Metal 'till the end
On A War For Metal
Into the battle
War For Metal 'till the end

Giants call and demons fall
When Thunder Riders hail
The war begins, the war of kings
The truth will never fail

When the giant's calling we hear the command
On a war for metal we are sent
Let us march for glory with swords in our hand
War For Metal 'till the end
On A War For Metal
Into the battle
War For Metal 'till the end
