We are the sons and the daughters of fire
Oh Oh Oh
Live wild and free is our highest desire
Oh Oh Oh
We're born to rock 'till the days of perdition
Oh Oh Oh
Until the end we will follow that vision
Oh Oh Oh

By thunder and lightning
We're young and we're free
Never, ever, ever shall we doubt what we feel
The anthem we're singing, our words are defined to heal

Generation Steel
We're standing here until the end is near
Generation Steel
One by one, forever wild and strong
We are burning like fire, rise from the ashes for real
We came out of the dark
Generation Steel

We hit the stage, we all know it is true, man
Oh Oh Oh
Yes, with our fans we are building a union
Oh Oh Oh
We rule the world when we're standing together
Oh Oh Oh
It's in our blood, keep on playing forever
Oh Oh Oh

By thunder and lightning
We're young and we're free
Never, ever, ever shall we doubt what we feel
The anthem we're singing, our words are defined to heal

Generation Steel
We're standing here until the end is near
Generation Steel
One by one, forever wild and strong
We are burning like fire, rise from the ashes for real
We came out of the dark
Generation Steel

Generation Steel
The chosen ones, we are the Metal sons
Generation Steel
Strength we feel, yes we will never kneel
Generation Steel
We're standing here until the end is near
Generation Steel
One by one, forever wild and strong
We are burning like fire, rise from the ashes for real
We came out of the dark
Generation Steel
