I am fire, when wind is wild
I am darkness when there is crimson light
When they're calling for help I come
They don't know me, I am the shadow's son

Whenever they need me the flame of rebellion will spark
My deeds will prevail but my name will be lost in the dark

They're calling appalling
Damnation Hero
Defender, Avenger
Damnation Hero
Damnation Hero
Damnation Hero

They are failing and lose control
I'm their guardian and I will save their souls
Their avenger who does the dirt
Their defender when they are getting hurt

Whenever they need me the flame of rebellion will spark
My deeds will prevail but my name will be lost in the dark

Rebellious and gracious
Damnation Hero
Devastation in their nation
Damnation Hero

My lonely heart is pounding for reward
For glory and for fame
I save their lives, their children and their wives
And they don't know my name
And they don't know my name

They're calling appalling
Damnation Hero
Defender, Avenger
Damnation Hero
Damnation Hero
Damnation Hero

Rebellious and gracious
Damnation Hero
Devastation in their nation
Damnation Hero
