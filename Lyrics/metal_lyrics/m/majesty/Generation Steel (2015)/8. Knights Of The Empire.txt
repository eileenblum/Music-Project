They came randomly to pillage
They burned down our home, our village
Ten years old, I had to see my people die
I was lying broke and lonely
So they left me to die slowly
But days later I was found by a proud knight

He took me home to an old fortress
His wife gave me food and hostage
He was leading the defenders of our land
They're called the knights of the empire
And they gave me new desire
Trained me to become a member of their clan

And now I am strong, I'm defending our home by my hand
Forever a part, with true pride in my heart I will stand

Knights Of The Empire
Knights Of The Empire
I'm hearing the call to march 'till I fall
I am, and I say that with pride, an empire's knight

On the path of sublime virtue
I am bound to keep it true
I will hunt down all the enemies I find
Seek revenge for my own people
Transform culprits into creeples
For the empire I ride into the night

With my brothers in a union
We are members of a proud clan
All together, one for all and all for one
When it's dark and wolves are howling
We're the light that cleans the fouling
When the sign is in the sky our time has come

Yes, I am strong, I'm defending our home by my hand
Forever a part, with true pride in my heart I will stand

Knights Of The Empire
Knights Of The Empire
I'm hearing the call to march 'till I fall
I am, and I say that with pride, an empire's knight

High on the mountains, observing our land
I see the enemies falling
I'm wielding my sword when I hear thy command
Whenever the empire's calling

Knights Of The Empire
Knights Of The Empire
I'm hearing the call to march 'till I fall
I am, and I say that with pride, an empire's knight
