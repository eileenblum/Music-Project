I was lost and lonely and I had no place to go
I felt the wind was stormy and my heart was black and cold
But then I thought it over and I knew what I should do
I broke out of my casket and I found my only truth

Rising high where the eagles fly
Ride on the thunder tonight
I am free and I always be the master of glory and pride

Shout at the world till your heart is free
Shout till they all know about
Shout at the world, it's your sole belief
Your call is immortal and proud
Shout, shout. Shout at the world
Shout, shout. Shout at the world

Hey sisters and hey brothers, I salute you, one by one
We are the generation and I know our time has come
Let's take away these borders and let's tear down all these walls
Let's build a mighty kingdom for the ones who heard the call

Rising high where the eagles fly
Ride on the thunder tonight
I am free and I always be the master of glory and pride

Shout at the world till your heart is free
Shout till they all know about
Shout at the world, it's your sole belief
Your call is immortal and proud
Shout, shout. Shout at the world
Shout, shout. Shout at the world
