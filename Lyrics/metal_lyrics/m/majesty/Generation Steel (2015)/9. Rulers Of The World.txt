We came to reign in glory
Our voices will be heard
Raise your fist and tell our story
We are rulers of the world

Holy is the fire, it's burning in our eyes
We're chosen by a signal from the gods in the sky
Follow our desire, our empire shall rise
We conquer by the spirit of the hawks, they will fly

They're calling us the overlords
The masters of the night

And we came to reign in glory
Our voices will be heard
Raise your fist and tell our story - OhOhOhOh
We are rulers of the world

Yes, Metal is our power, forever born to reign
Soldiers of true force are standing proud side by side
In darkness and in sunlight, in snowfall and in rain
We raise our banners high and march for glory and might

They're calling us the overlords
The masters of the night

And we came to reign in glory
Our voices will be heard
Raise your fist and tell our story - OhOhOhOh
We are rulers of the world

We will conquer all their nations
By the Metal Law they burn
We're the chosen generation - Generation Steel
We are rulers of the world

And we came to reign in glory
Our voices will be heard
Raise your fist and tell our story - OhOhOhOh
We are rulers of the world

We will conquer all their nations
By the Metal Law they burn
We're the chosen generation - Generation Steel
We are rulers of the world

And we came to reign in glory
Our voices will be heard
Raise your fist and tell our story - OhOhOhOh
We are rulers of the world
