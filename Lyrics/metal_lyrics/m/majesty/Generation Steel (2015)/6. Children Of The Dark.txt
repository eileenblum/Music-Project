Ohohoh Ohohoh, Ohohoh Ohohoh
We are the children of the dark
Ohohoh Ohohoh, Ohohoh Ohohom
We are the children of the dark

Deep inside the blackest storm the castaways unite
A gathering of the lonely souls
We all found the last resort inside the gloomy
On grounds as dry as burning coal

We are calling, hear our bawling
Black wolves howl loud in our hearts

Ohohoh Ohohoh, Ohohoh Ohohoh
We are the children of the dark
Ohohoh Ohohoh, Ohohoh Ohohom
We are the children of the dark

The ones who lived a life of pain are welcome in our Reich
They find the ultimate refuge
We're creatures of the moonlight so the sun we do not like
And at the end we bring deluge

We are calling, hear our bawling
Black wolves howl loud in our hearts

Ohohoh Ohohoh, Ohohoh Ohohoh
We are the children of the dark
Ohohoh Ohohoh, Ohohoh Ohohom
We are the children of the dark

Find the children, join the children
Hail the children of the dark

Ohohoh Ohohoh, Ohohoh Ohohoh
We are the children of the dark
Ohohoh Ohohoh, Ohohoh Ohohom
We are the children of the dark
