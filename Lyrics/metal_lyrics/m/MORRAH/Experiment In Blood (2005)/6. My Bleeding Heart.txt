First I smash his skull
Work intoxicating me
Dismembered his remains
Scattered all over

My heart's bleeding
Killing can heal
Choose the way of dying
It's your last will
Overpopulation needs my control
Clean-up has just begun
Give me your soul

Abdomen is my favourite part
I open it and look inside
Unwind disgusting guts
For several meters

My heart's bleeding
Remedy is close
Every murdered victim
Revives my sweet hope
But this worthless world
Is crowded for me
Just close your eyes
Sleep eternally

I observe his ligaments torn
Father of many children
They should never have been born
The poison of the planet

Social claustrophobia puts me out and makes me sick
Trust me it was torment to destroy those breeding freaks
