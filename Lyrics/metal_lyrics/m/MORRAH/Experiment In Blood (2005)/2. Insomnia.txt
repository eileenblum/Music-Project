Headache
Disguise
The source of evil
When it's close to sunrise
Insanity leads to what you cannot see
And comprehend
To the cruel land

[CHORUS:]
Lunacy
Disharmony
The time you can't fall asleep
Insomnia

Twilight
Streets
The call from inside
To my grown dim mind
You're thinking of way to busy yourself
To bear the pain
To take off the strain

[CHORUS]

Finding a victim is not a question of time
Look in her eyes, they radiate the fear
You throw her into the slime
Mercy is sleeping but you are tired of fight
Blood is the drug, it helps you to survive
And bear this horrible night

[CHORUS II:]
Throat is gurgling, time of agony
Intestines are scattered, the soul is free
Victim was innocent, what have you done for?
Life became death and the blood became gore

The gore is the pain
The way obstructed
You've chosen the abnormal solution
You close your eyes
The dreams are coming
They make you recall the last breath of the dying

[CHORUS II]
