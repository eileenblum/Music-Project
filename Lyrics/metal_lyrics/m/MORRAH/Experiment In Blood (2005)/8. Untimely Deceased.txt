Darkness absorbs the light
One can see there is some kind of philosophy
The odour of easy flesh
Gives me direction of supposed victim

In the dark I walk my way
I'm scared of creature who dwells in this place
It's appeared since my father's gone
I hear his hiss and his moan

In the dark I feel thirst
In this race I will be first

Untimely deceased I haven't yet gone from this world of nothing
Concealed by the night I am the lord of the woods and pain
Devour the flesh and disembowel of those who got lost
Who got lost

Come to me, pretty beast,
Your sharp teeth I can see
Morbid face, no disgrace,
No time waste, I'll get you

In the dark I feel thirst
In this race I will be first
Silly human, you think you can catch me
That's nonsense.

Untimely deceased I haven't yet gone from this world of nothing
Concealed by the night I am the lord of the woods and pain
Devour the flesh and disembowel of those who got lost
Who got lost

Come to me, pretty beast,
Your sharp teeth I can see
Morbid face, no disgrace,
No time waste, I'll get you

Caught with my net
Now I recognize you, my son
You made me dead
And your greed, look what I have become

In the dark I feel thirst
In this race I will be first

Darkness absorbs the light
One can see there is some kind of philosophy
The odour of easy flesh
Gives me direction of supposed victim

In the dark I walk my way
I'm scared of creature who dwells in this place
It's appeared since my father's gone
I hear his hiss and his moan
