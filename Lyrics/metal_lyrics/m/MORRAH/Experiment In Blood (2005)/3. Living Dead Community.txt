Desperate fatality
Fictional reality
Belief in immortality

You will never see the skies
Paranormal paradise
Of the merciless butchery

Rotten flesh is the only meal
Otherwise you have to kill
Only hunger is real

Starving creature in the night
Living in the damned site
Nature and atrocity

[CHORUS:]
Pain and torture
When claws tear the veins
Blood flows from the body
You enjoy his pain
Bloodthirsty leads you
You are full of hate
Murder and slaughter
Is the key to the gate

Order of depravity
In this world of vanity
Breeder of insanity

Temple of the damned souls
Shadows from the deepest hole
Altar of inhumanity

Institution of a sin
Darkness will invite you in
The living dead community

Mercy is what's left behind
Single thought is in your mind
This is your reality

[CHORUS]

All my former life
All my passed days
You believed it's the superstition
The life of living dead
But they exist
Undead called zombies
The life becomes nightmare
The man becomes the beast

Liquid called blood
Flows out of the body
The inhuman things
You listen attentively the moans of the dying
The pain is unbearable
Reflecting your centers of pleasure
There is dark and cool
You're drinking the blood beyond measure

[CHORUS]
