When he came down to the Earth
The work was almost done
Convinced by Holy Church
The people made bonfires
Did they need what you present
The freedom that did not satiate
Power of inquisition
Turned people's life right way

[CHORUS:]
It's time, my friend of misery
Tonight you shall burn. Dixi.
We're right with the blessing of eternity
Near future I can see.

When the evil wise spirit
Asked you three times in sands
You did make no decision
Brought freedom to those lands
Human who was born rebel
Could not be free himself
Without our tactful guidance
We serve the whole mankind

[CHORUS:]
It's time, my friend of misery
Tonight you shall burn. Dixi.

Eternal power
We took what you refused
Do you know our secret
We are with Him, not with you
I say: who worships you now
Tonight will dig your grave
You came to prevent our mission
So, kneel and pray.

[CHORUS:]
It's time, my friend of misery
Tonight you shall burn. Dixi.
We're right with the blessing of eternity
Near future I can see.
