Hell's bells
And buckets of blood
You don't want to die
Your meat is full of blood
I like to hear your cries

Close your eyes
Enjoy the pain

Your veins
They are so strong
But I shall cut off them all
You are so womanish
I hate such bodies at all

Close your eyes
Enjoy the pain

I'm the butcher at work
You are still alive
I hate the way you live
You won't survive

I shall pull out your heart
It's beating so loud
I shall tear it apart
To throw to the ground

I'll cut off your veins and meat
I have no time limit
I'll press out ugly eyes
I'm laughing 'till you die

Just enjoy eternal pain
Do you know I'm insane?
I'm bathing in your blood
I'm butcher, I'm God

Hell's bells
And buckets of blood
You don't want to die
