I am rich
And powerful, and my business
Rule's too much is not enough
In detail,
The nation that disturbs me
Sucks and no one can survive

I am who sold the world
Judas is my name
I am who'll see the mankind's fall
Risen from the grave

For justice I strive
Money's my life

Globalism
The idol of my income
Scares opponents of my will
Betray and sell
The law of money-making
And nobody is trusted

I am who sold the world
Judas is my name
I am who'll see the mankind's fall
Risen from the grave

For justice I strive
Money's my life

[instrumental]

For justice I strive
Money's my life
