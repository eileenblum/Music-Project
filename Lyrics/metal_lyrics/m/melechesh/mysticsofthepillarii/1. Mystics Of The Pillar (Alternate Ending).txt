Lions' will
Lions' will as living form
Mystics of the golden column
Revealed the pictures of the unknown
Snakes and ladders will keep you above

Stylites over stone pillars
Pilgrims of the mind's eye
Irrational reflections recur as multi reason
Wait for hidden answers, they are cosmic beams

Neither Enki, nor Ishtar
Can see through the sacred blackened mirror

Abide by the bygone code
Snub the shrouding archetypes
The prime project alter reason
Evolution of the soul
Their thoughts are veiled

May the sands of Mashu bless them
While the cloud bridge the mountains
Devourers of sacred notions
Bring us answers, bring down the sky

Neither Enki, nor Ishtar
Can see through the sacred blackened mirror

May the sands of Mashu bless them

Cite the owners of the throne
Embrace madness for it is sanity
Mystics of the shining pillars
Isolate the soul from extinguished body

Cite the owners of the throne
Embrace madness for it is sanity
Mystics of the shining pillars
Isolate the soul from hybrid flesh

I call you thrice and come
A chamber filled yet hollow
Arraign the tenets of lies
That shrouds the third eye of the mind

May the sands of Mashu bless them
