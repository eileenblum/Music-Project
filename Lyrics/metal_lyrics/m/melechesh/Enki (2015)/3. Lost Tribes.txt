Chaldean spells
Look within
All towers have crumbled
Heedless creed
Tread free
In the soil
Medus solum cresent
Heads buried in the sand
You are impotent

Cultures crystallized by plague
Bedlam
Tree of death looms
You made this reversed to nothingness
It's void creatio ex hinilo

Lost tribes [2x]

Look beneath the roots
Rise
Leave the cross you bear
It weighs you down [2x]

Retribution's hands will come by the fathers of the clans
Sect of the wool in trance
The peacock
Angel's bloodline

Lost tribes
Look beneath the roots
Rise
Leave the cross you bear
It weighs you down [2x]

Retribution's hands will come
It's all there carved in arcane stone

Cultures crystallized
Bury your heads in sand

Look within
Chaldean spells
Your omni
Two-faced idol has lost your dignified origin

It weighs you down [2x]
