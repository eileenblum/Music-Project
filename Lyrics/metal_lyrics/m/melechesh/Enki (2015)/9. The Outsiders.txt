Clan of Fire march the lands
Mesmerising souls, migrant clans
Invisible crowns

Censer smoke open doorways
Meridian bridges
Invisible crowns what a sight - transmission

Shapeshifters what a sight
Wings of Ahura many seek

Shapeshifters what a sight
Wings of Ahura many seek
Invisible crowns

Esoteric port negate the lost
Dastour, Dastour... revelations
Invisible crowns
Miasma hollow shells they are
Chameleons in divine paths
Monochrome Picatrix

Miasma hollow shells they are
They bless, they give they are unseen
Sedating the senses

The bless they give they are unseen
A tale of constants don't you believe?
Duality! All is transposed

The Outsiders come

Lord Curse: drums, percussion
Melechesh Ashmedi: vocals, percussion, guitars, sitar, keyboards
Moloch: vocals (backing), saz, guitars
Scorpios: vocals (backing), bass
