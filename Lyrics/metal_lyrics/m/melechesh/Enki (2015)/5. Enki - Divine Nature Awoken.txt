Blessed watcher, orthodox father, Suzerain king of fates, maker of man
Prime of archetype, Living matter and form, Sage of the gods, Ea, Enki

Divine Nature Awoken

Through the void, cyclone, fire and cosmic stones
May Utnapishtim sail
For your servant cosmonaut
Master of chromosome vessels - it must be done

Bring the waters of life, essence strains
Dweller of the liquid universe 
Mankind he made, mankind he dictates
Sonic creation, power of the word

Blind upon it the will of the gods
Mix the heart of clay that is over the Abyss

Set the seeds your disciples are born
Enki - exalted ruler of House of the cosmic waters - Eridu
"The Sage of the Gods"
