Inheritors of earth awake / You have lost your ways
A blanket of hypnos seal the pale / Midnight neon sun... omnipotence
The Ancient Ones embrace

Lord of the winds and storm / Triad's vengeful one
Mankind's demise / Channels to the mind cut
From Nebiru, ethereal globe

Dimensional collapse / Seal all infinity
Two serpents are entwined / Enlil, Ea spectrum polarity
Mankind - servants of the gods / In denial, static life

Tempest Temper Enlil Enraged
Mute the Human Vermin
The Skies' Anger Enlil Enraged

Three hundred Cosmonauts / Orbit this cursed mass
Before Enlil treads / On these wretched prototypes
The Ones who see and observe / After the Lugal-e
Comes the war of gods and men / King Nunanmir, I am Nunanmir
He is filled with spite / Earthquakes and floods
Divine artisans / Crafted under his command

Tempest Temper Enlil Enraged
Mute the Human Vermin
Nunanmir's rage

Abstention on enlightenment / Collective consciousness synchronized
Is this happening again? / Mankind muted and obsolete!
