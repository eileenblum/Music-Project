Lost wandering dreams with a signal from the Eastern skies
Saga transmissions through the ages
Cosmic winds and recurrent time
Eyes folded blind from revelations with thorns, mud, gold and wine
There you stand as a shadow it seems
Arcane, ordained

The Pendulum Speaks

A weight lifts, the chest unchained
Shed light yet the mystery remains
Scale the stars, sense the sense
Ecto-white seeps space universum parts
It seeps slow, they seep slow
Enunun - Sky Giants come

Descend the stairs - Zagros 

Like Gilgamesh's tale the answers are there for you
The sky below, as above so below, so below so above
Qere &amp; Kethib revelations!
Play with fire, let your fingers burn
This key will purge, it will transform
Let them come and call your name
The Pendulum Speaks
