A chain of continuum

Messages from the Abyss
Liquid sky tears they are
Connectors from them

The palm tells the way
This is a warning

Three eyes shatter the dust
You say I am I am I am
You say I am but your are not!
Trivial space dislocators
Parasitical energy larcenists
For it is decay in you

Bronze hand bronze map
Bronze hand of knowledge
Feeds the vulgar
You bite it yet you feed

[Lead: Rob Caggiano]

This is your warning - gray mass will return

Drink the arcane Lazulum
Cast out myopia of the wind
No codex only reflections - only reflections
Syncretic, dualistic new dogma
Let me show you the way
I, I am
