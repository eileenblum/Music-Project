STARSEED
Starseed come forth
Intruders have annexed thee
While dajjals germinate
Penta-wings shun all lies

The mirror image unjustified

From Keter to Malkut
The mirror image unjustified
The crown and kingship road
Binaural creation keys
We thrive, (while) shadows are on their knees
Hexahedron the garden of knowledge
Thirteen spheres, it is done

Metatron you aren't dead
The angel skin you must shed
Annunaki supreme
The fallen ones are calling you

Metatron you aren't dead
The angel skin you must shed
The fallen ones are calling you

Omhaom
Omhaom breathing light
Merkabah majestic astral flight
Star scions chaos whispers
Victory, the fallen never fell

Metatron, Omhaom
