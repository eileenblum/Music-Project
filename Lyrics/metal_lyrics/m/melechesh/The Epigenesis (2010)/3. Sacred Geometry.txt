Sons of Sumer open your eyes
Awake, discover maze of the sublime
Born within the cradle
Voices of the essence
Curious Enlil's legions forever watchful
As we transcend plural psyche banishing
The essence speaks to us
In every cell in every stone and space

Meen fee hali ou bali
Meen bis'aal il wali il fee
Blessed be the cosmic dust
We are all of Enlil's plan

Meen fee hali ou bali
Meen bis'aal il wali il fee
Blessed be the cosmic dust
We are all of Enlil's plan

Submit to the grace of chaotic order

With his hands, he molded us
Find the hidden meanings
Facets inseparable from his plan
Frequencies, pulsation, voices of the world

Magickal stains vaporize from
(The) proverbial, cosmic energy spheres
Doorway to the other will unlock
Neo-spiritualism
Arcane arts' interpretations
Sons of Sumer open your eyes

Intrinsic unity of creation
