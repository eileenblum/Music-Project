When there was no shape
The apex of answers was still untold

They are not the prime of existence
Nor are they of the other realm
They are not the mouths that breath life
When the heavens and sky were still not created
They were not the void or the light

Reverse the thoughts
Channel the foundation
Earth Station One may give us a clue

When there was no shape
They were not the source

Dimensional disassembly
The apex of answers may unfold

Three times metamorphosis
They are of the No-thing, if anything
Negate the divine for an answer
Discover the meaning, trace the lines

Lahoot Salbi, Apophasis

Even asks Zarathustra
Who are the divine?

Reverse the thoughts
Channel the foundation
Earth Station One may give us a clue

The Word, the Sham, the Vessel

Repeat the word like grains of soil
Cycle of queues in the dark

THEY ARE NOT!
