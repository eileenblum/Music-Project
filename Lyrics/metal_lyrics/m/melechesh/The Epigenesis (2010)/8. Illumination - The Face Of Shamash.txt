Wings from letters
Carry me beyond the white
Here I am standing
Burning winds fill my lungs
My eyes are open
My palm is read

Prophets propel me, propel me to the zone
They enter my mind, LIGHT!
These are Sumer's chosen ones
Angst from enlightenment

Face of the Sun will guide me
Shamash, carry me beyond the white
This is the will of fate
Dead trees are you

Position the fingers forward (whispers)
