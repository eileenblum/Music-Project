Resonance waves, the Dajjals are here
Tremors shake the burning candles
Primeval air entering the being
As written on chariots from stone

For no fool, nor Dajjal, nor Sham
Can taint the celestial jar

Power of divine speech
Echo in the Synod of truth
Are they whispers? Or are they souls?
Clad in black they are the Omni Inventors

Tell us the tale of ego and loss
Umbiblical cord served, Belet-Jli
Loss of divine sight, Alas

The silk lanes of Henna
Labyrinth map
Tell us the tale of ego and loss

ZAKAR bring us the Well

God of dreams, pantheon of Babel
Shield our souls, protect the night

ZAKAR bring us the Well
Loss of divine sight

For no fool, nor Dajjal, nor Sham
Can taint the celestial jar

ZAKAR
The Dajjals are here
The burning candles
Enter the being
On chariots from stone
