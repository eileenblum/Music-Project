Nomadic souls strive and search for reason
The peak of genesis - ESCHATON!
When Uru-Salim purges itself
The Djinns of this earth will depart
Carried in the colossal Sphynx-like chariots
The Emissaries' task is fulfilled

Forming myth's dual meaning
This is the testimony of the Epigenesis

When Uru-Salim purges itself
The Djinns of this earth will depart
Carried in the colossal Sphynx-like chariots
The Emissaries' task is fulfilled
The Epigenesis
This is the testimony of the Epigenesis
