Drones, you destined dust eaters
This is your anecdote
You dwell in a state of hypnos
Lost in the illusion of being
Subsistence, survival, let us serve
Myth and reality altered
Samsara, your marked fate

Tyrants - we will tame you
Decipher - the codes and be free
Subservient - wanderers of this earth are

Ur-Nammu comes to lay his claim
Decree the fate of the dead
Like drones you are our slaves in rapture

Tyrants - we will tame you
Decipher - the codes and be free
Subservient - wanderers of this earth are

Thousand lies twisted around you
Serpentine lines cage the feeble minds

As the magickan leads the Drones
Ur Nammu's sons, mere skin on bones
Sink to E-Mumah
House of the exalted name
Manzat - sanctuary of Babylon
The Great Chamber with the seven gods
Greets the cold gaunt drones

Tyrants - we will tame you
Decipher - the codes and be free
Subservient - wanderers of this earth are

Thousand lies twisted around you
Serpentine lines cage the feeble minds

Drones, you destined dust eaters
This is your anecdote
You dwell in a state of hypnos
Lost in the illusion of being
