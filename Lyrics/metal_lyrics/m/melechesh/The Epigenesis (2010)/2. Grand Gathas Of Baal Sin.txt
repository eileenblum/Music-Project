GRAND GATHAS, BRINGERS OF MAGICK!

Grand Gathas, bringers of magick
Stun the norm, sublime ideas
Builders of restless towers
They grow to reach the heavens

NINE... Nine spirits wreak havok
NINE... Nine spirits ever defiant

Reconstruction of the golden age
Guided by giant bearded sages
Metaphoric mirage of the ideal
Materialize the spoken word

NINE... Nine spirits wreak havok
NINE... Nine spirits ever defiant

Under the eye of Ashur
And all the wise
All the bearded giants
With their liquid souls we're baptized
SIN!
Caliphates of the truth
Khamsa fee ein Il'adoo

Polymaths are the ones who question
Polymaths are the ones who hear
Surreal voices scream
Awake and march to the next domain

Under the eye of Ashur
And all the wise
All the bearded giants
We're baptized with their liquid souls

Bringers of shadows
Shun the mask
That mask the illusion of the mass

Grand Gathas, bringers of magick
Stun the norm, sublime ideas
Builders of restless towers
They grow to reach the heavens

NINE... Nine spirits wreak havok
NINE... Nine spirits ever defiant

SIN!
BAAL SIN!
