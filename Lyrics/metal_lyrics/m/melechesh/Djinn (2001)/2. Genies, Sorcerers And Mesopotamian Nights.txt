[Music: Ashmedi, Moloch / Lyrics: Ahsmedi]

The fire is burning
The temple is standing high
Priests of the seven elders
Are conjuring his might
The sphinx flies in the mystic black sky
Ecstasy winds blow over the magical plains
Terrestrial power chain and magnetize
The lunar key of Nebo's lands
Celestial power chain and magnetize
The solar gate opened by Nergal's hands

The Order Of Mesopotamia will rise
The post wisdom treasure will finally be earned
Secrets unveiled in the most abstract ways
Genies, Sorcerers
Genies, Sorcerers and Mesopotamian tales

End of all days, watch the new way
The rites of infernal magic in this tale

The warlock, the witch and the wizard will bind
Triangling the last tower of might
Rites of Nazu the desert behold
Summoning the great entity of gold

The Genii is near
My search ends here
Lord of magicians
I journeyed the night
Forever in the night
The maze of the deep

Mesopotamian nights

End of all days, watch the new way
The rites of infernal magic in this tale

The fire is burning the temple is standing high
The warlock, the witch, the wizard will burn
End of all days, watch the new way
The rites of infernal magic in this tale

[Lead: Ashmedi]

The warlock, the witch and the wizard will bind
Triangling the last tower of might
Rites of Nazu the desert behold
Summoning the great entity of gold

The Genii is near
My search ends here
Rites of magicians
I journeyed the night
Forever in the night
The maze of the deep
We walk and we walk
The plains of Uruk
In search for the Talisman
Beyond the realms of the suspended rock
We continue this tale...
