[Music: Ashmedi &amp; Moloch / Lyrics: Ashmedi]

All will sigh when they realize we dwell in the land below
Keepers of Nergal's knowledge of Zingir behold

The siege of Lachish
Our demon spirits
The valley of Gehenna
We are heard so loud

From blood they are running now
Legions of ours slay the enemy
They are going to die when the fall of the site begins
On the mountain side let it be, the slaughter of the deity
Life is blind life is death, the siege of Lachish will stop the slaves, so bow!!!

March of the wicked, the mighty breed
Winds of the fearless Nineveh will blow
Finding the realms of the mighty brethren
Waging the siege now the siege of blood

[Lead: Ashmedi]

The siege of Lachish
Our demon spirits
The valley of Gehenna
We are heard so loud
