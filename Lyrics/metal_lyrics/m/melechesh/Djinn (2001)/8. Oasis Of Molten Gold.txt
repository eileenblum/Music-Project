[Music: Ashmedi / Lyrics: Ashmedi]

Rune of the Lion's Eye
bring the salt cyclone
Lightning from the ground
The Oasis of Molten Gold

Rune of the Lion's Beard
Open up the stone
Blasting thunder sound
Reveals oasis of gold

Assyrian hordes the forces of darkness
Marching on the twilight sand
Conqueror Nebuchadnezzar
Sworn to take all cosmic lands
Travelling, back and forth in time
Overwhelming all in their path
On alabaster it has been written
They arise from golden ash

Tunnel of Time
Come pilgrims of the beats
Kinetic powers
Bringers of the plague...BRINGERS OF THE PLAGUE!

Masses of Edimu...
Stomping on the ground
They are approaching with bloodshed on their minds
Legions of Shedu...
Marching on their side
Unseen evil powers superior minds

Sigh ...Cry...
I'm the Master Of Backward Time
reverse! ...hgiS
retsaM fO drawkcaB emiT

By Reverse Magic all will be concealed
Pshych-alchemic mastery
