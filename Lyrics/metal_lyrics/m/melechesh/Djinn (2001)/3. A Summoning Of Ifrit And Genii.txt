[Music: Ashmedi / Lyrics: Ashmedi]

Into burning eyes
You stare hypnotically
You're Possessed by the Mesospotamian Genie
Cults of Chaos
Desert Sabbaths
Of witching Minds
Summoning the Ifrit...Ah...

Give into your desires, bring forth a being to (fulfill) you needs
From another timeless dimension
An entity of malefic breed

Into red burning eyes
You stare hypnotically
You're mine forever, ever and ever...

Your shell is yours free!
It's nothing but ashes to me
Your soul is mine, mine, all mine!!

Into burning eyes you stare
You are mine FOREVER!!!

Give into your desires
Bring forth a being to (fulfill) you needs
From another timeless dimension
An entity of malefic breed.
