[Music: Ashmedi / Lyrics: Ashmedi]

We walk this earth
Searching for the truth
We learned the human mind
To satisfy our wicked way

A silhouette of the beast
Stand before my eyes
His temptation sinks so deep
Deeper than the deepest mind

"Rub the lantern!
Rub it now!"
I see the earth is shaking
I see the smoke is rising

Walking through the mountain
Into an oblivious town
Seeing the tent of the peddler
That came from another dimension
We wore the sign of Utukku
The sign of the ancient curse
He bore the sign of Akrabu
The symbol of the scorpion-man

A silhouette of the beast
Stand before my eyes
His temptation sinks so deep
To reach for the Lantern of Might

Through the centuries of hidden knowledge
I've learned the weakness of man
Feeding on their lusts
I return again, again and again
Higher form magic
To capture your soul
Hallucinate with sour fury
We create what man hate

"I tempt you"
Knowledge is like a looping tower
Inside a golden pillar
that contains the secrets of the Micro and Macrocosm

We create what man hate.
