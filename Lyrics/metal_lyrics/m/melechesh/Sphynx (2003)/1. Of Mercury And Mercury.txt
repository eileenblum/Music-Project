[Music: Ashmedi / Lyrics : Ashmedi]

Like a thread of spider silk
Burst from the third eye
Inverse energy released
From the mind, pointing to
The land of the delta prophets

Step in the bizarre bazaar
Here stands the ziggurat
Bursting plasma pointing to
Mercury's dimension
Micro-cosmic essence
Of the hallucinating vision

A world of occult (and) sorcery
Point the brass compass at you
Profound cult of the erie
Reveal the absolute truth

A world with occult (and) sorcery
Profound cult of the eerie
Point the compass at you

It's all in a circle
It's all within the triangle
Map the suspended earth
A parallel world stands there

It's all in a circle
It's all within the triangle
Map the wretched earth
A parallel world stands there

The Alpha point, points at the sky below
What the land of Sumeria has foretold
Is like the hypnotized snake's swallowed tail
Infinity is complete; the spirit of the prophecy is here

The King of Fire shall seal this prophecy
With a Mercury mail
