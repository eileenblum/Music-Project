[Music : Ashmedi / Lyrics: Ashmedi]

Lugal - E the cosmic battle
Release the evil winds
Ninutra charges, he is poison
Like a Shem, great and supreme

Anzu, you will be diminished
Witness the wrath of the avenger
Usurper of Durnaki's pride
Kurnugi awaits, you will never hide

The arcane tablets of infinite destinies
Control the Seven dimensions
Reverse the spell, transform to clay
The panel of Fate must return

Two grand masses clash like thunder
A flash of light burns the sky
Beam after beam after beam, gleam
Like a horned serpent stream
The roar of creatures of malice is shrilling and super supreme

Ninutra, like a magma duct
Flowing rage and whirling frenzy
Boiling and full of hate
Spilling spite on the thief of pride
From the ashes of the winged one
The destiny stones must be returned
Behold, the language of the palm is now born

The arcane tablets of infinite destinies
Control the Seven dimensions
Reverse the spell, transform to clay
The panel of fate must return

The ghoul of Anzu. "be entrapped"
Within the marble citadel
Masked in the mountain of fury stones
Amid Ashur, Babel and Ur

Anzu you are now diminished
Feel the wrath of the avenger
Usurper of Durnaki's pride
Kurnugi's winds you shall ride

Ninutra, like a magma duct
Flowing rage and whirling frenzy
Boiling and full of hate
Spilling spite on the thief of pride
