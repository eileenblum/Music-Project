[Music: Ashmedi / Lyrics: Ashmedi]

"Fiercest Gallu demons rise"

Seven headed serpents
Born of genius and rage
Slaves to the olden Unnamed
Shield the cosmic deserts
Seven noble sages
Born of princely progeny
Of elevated golden blood
Praise the nameless Ancient Gods

Quick-sand, vacuum,
Sky of sand in the sphere of the damned
A dimension of cosmogony
Overwhelm the will, grim thrill
Seven headed serpents
Born of genius and rage
Slaves to the olden Unnamed
Shield the cosmic deserts

"Fiercest Gallu demons rise"

Giants, titans, people of the Shem
Architects of Lugal-E
Recluses of innate dominance
Sires of earth, Shahs of the universe
Seated on their thrones of gold
They weaved all essence
In opaque storm of vacuum
Seven noble Sages
Born of princely progeny
Of elevated golden blood
Praise the nameless Ancient Gods

Barron land Nazu domains
Malefic phantoms rise
Like an oath of the surreal fiend
Uttuku's curse forever remain

Land of Nazu domains
Malefic phantoms rise
Like an oath of the surreal fiend
Uttuku's curse forever remain

"Sebittu, Iminbi, Lugal - E"
Annunaki's Golden Thrones
