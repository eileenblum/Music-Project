[Music: Al'Hazred, Ashmedi, Moloch / Lyrics: Proscriptor]

Ea rewards the Sages with seven gems
Each is stamped onto copper and burnished gold
Ea melts defined sigils into magic squares
As the cyclones of water start to rise

[Ea:]
"Now, you are emerging from the voids of Apsu
Your law will shelter the gifts of enchantment
But when the silhouettes of the icons appear
(The) five deities of planets will stalk below"

Tempests break through as Ishtar arrives
Wer and imsuhhu as a unit collide
Stones fall to pieces as Nabu becomes visible
Shulpae leads the others into confiscation

[Ea:]
"As I flood the fresh water with my insight,
Symbols sculpt and carve the charms with my rule
As I stand before the set of deities
I rape magnetic charge from their earthy path"

He went through gates of fate
According to cuneiforms
It said Dreamers observed
To find him crown the shrine:
"While we gave your wisdom to the far-sighted
We beheld Ea falling in the Apsu."
