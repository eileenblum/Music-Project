[Music : Ashmedi / Lyrics: Ashmedi]

Sinking and sinking and sinking in the land of dreams
The art of forbidden sights, Kuthulu spells set free
Invoking the Sphinx that rules the deserts of Nebiru
Shifting the beam of light piercing the sand skies

Nebiru ground of the olden rise
Dunes of the formers cipher the cries

Rites of ill winds, burning the awareness path
Rites of Dingir never to be for mankind
In the maze of the dome it shall be sealed
The secrets of sphynxology will never be revealed

Nebiru ground of the olden rise
Dunes of the formers cipher the cries
Lies!

Nebiru ground of the olden rise
Dunes of the formers cipher the cries

Like Dervishes menacing whirl, a vortex of Shamash turn
Sacrament of the Sphynx, release it from stone
A convoy of centaurs circles the enigmatic dome
Forming energy crescents and smiting snake spears,

Sphynx, your might is so pure your magick is supreme
Sins of arcane hunters, of knowledge so pure
Sphynx

[Lead: Ashmedi]

Rites of ill winds, burning the awareness path
Rites of Dingir never to be for mankind
In the maze of the dome it shall be sealed
The secrets of Sphynxology will never be revealed

Sinking and sinking and sinking in the land of dreams
The art of forbidden sights, Kuthulu spells set free
Invoking the Sphinx that rules the deserts of Sages
Shifting the beam of light piercing the sand skies

Sphynx, your might is so pure your magick is supreme
Sins of arcane hunters, of knowledge so pure
