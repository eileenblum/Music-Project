[Music: Al'Hazred, Ashmedi / Lyrics: Proscriptor]

I unite symbols that form lion shapes
I invoke dreams that dance in the minds' eye
I throw the firebrands across the firmament
I am the blaze that mirrors the desert lands

The stars abide not, as the stellar plains drift
The image is my nature and solar is my name
The beam of rays is the essence that soars
The auras of deifying curses are there

I am Shamash
Utu, Ag, and the Sun
Here I am ancient
There I am protracted
As ages go by
Stars coil above me
My secrets murmur
As they are deafening

I am Shamash
Utu, Ag, and the Sun
Here I am ancient
There I am protracted
As ages go by
Stars coil above me
My secrets murmur
As they are deafening

I am Shamash
Utu, Ag, and the Sun
Here I am ancient
There I am protracted
As ages go by
Stars coil above me
My secrets murmur
As they are deafening

My eruptions arrive, as the chaos rolls again
My vile light is attesting from the old times
My dancing fire shines on temples, the lucid flame

I am the gem that glistens in the lion's eye
I invoke the mirage of the day's frontier
I throw the firebrands across the firmament
I 'm the fire that rives the breach in the sky

A sacred mystery is seducing, yet untold
An image of my magic power will appear,
And will expose light onto the sand of gold
A hallowed mirage is drifting, yet hanging

I am the species, which is seen, in pure gold
I am the one that confines in this common space
I am the firebrand across the firmament
I am the twilight...

My fire enters gateways of all horizons
My range of vision is where gloom meets the sky
My radiance diminishes as the night develops
My commands are deafening to those horizon...
