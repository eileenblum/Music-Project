[Music: Ashmedi / Lyrics:Ashmedi]

Breath the universe
Rites of Annunaki's time
Bringing the essence, bring
The origin of Man's being
Forever your 'cosm is mine
Its mass in my crystal ball
Now heed your fathers are here
We claim the sons you bear

The Purifier the claimer will return

Now heed your fathers are here
We claim the sons you bear
Now heed your sons are here
We claim the fathers you bear

The Purifier, the claimer will return
Fulfilling his destined way

[Lead: Andy La Rocque]
[Lead: Ashmedi]

From the planet unknown and apart
Spawned the seed of earth's bond
New lands for our slaves
Purifier of the stars has made his way

Breath the universe
Rites of Annunaki's time
Forever your cosm is mine
It's mass in my crystal ball
Bringing the essence, bring
The origin of Man's being
The ritual of the scorpion's sting
Will take you on my wings

Breath the universe
Rites of Annunaki's time
Bringing the essence, bring
The origin of Man's being
Forever your cosm is mine
Its mass in my crystal ball
Now heed your fathers are here
We claim the sons you bear
