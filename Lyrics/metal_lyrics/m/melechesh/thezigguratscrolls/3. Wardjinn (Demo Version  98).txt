Spheres of Chaos, bring forth demise
I see destruction through my eyes
Behold the sphinx of Ashur rise
He brings Akkad's demise

Assyrian war Demon
Assyrian war Genii

A hail of demons attack from the sky
Black form figures with red eyes
Armed with scimitars forged in gold
Hear their howling and their cries

Assyrian war Demon
Assyrian war Genii
Assyrian war Demon
Assyrian battle skies

"I traveled all the worlds
I see it before my eyes
The land of all nine whores
New Babylon in the sky
This is the only way, to rule with fire
Wardjinn leaves the stone"

The creature is unleashed
Blowing the hot xul sands
Spreading his wings
Fire lightning from his hands
This mighty Djinn
A beast made before man
Macro-destruction released by his chants

His chants:
"Xul alla xul"
Shout
"Zi dingir alla xul"
His chants:
"Xul alla xul"
"Shamash maklu xul"

His chants:
"Xul alla xul"
Shout
"Zi dingir alla xul"
His chants:
"Xul alla xul"
Infernal chants
"Shamash maklu xul"

Whirling fire-winds sweep the battle fields
Oh, the beauty of their cries
Nineth Sphere of Chaos released from the mind
Macro-destruction, the wardjinn smiles

Assyrian war Demon
Assyrian war Genii
Assyrian war Demon
Assyrian battle skies

Assyrian war Demon
Assyrian war Genii
Assyrian war Demon
Assyrian battle skies
