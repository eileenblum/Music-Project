Ravaged drones obey!
Gaunt Dust Eaters, servants in E-Meslam
In static darkness the Etimmu stay

Noble ruler draped in black
Trampling man, he appears bleak and grim
With a double headed lion sceptre
And a scimitar on his side

God of the dead
Nergal they dread
Shamash, illuminate
Shamash, stretch your hand
Clash with the underworld

Bring forth union!

[Lead: Ashmedi]

Like a snake, the rays of light
Creep through the cities in the forbidden domain
It creeps and it creeps

Bring forth union!

God of the dead
Nergal they dread
Shamash, illuminate
Shamash, stretch your hand
Clash with the underworld

Eternal balance
Attest the surrealistic
revealing the omnipresent,
Swallower of all light
blend with the solar star,
Absorb the chaos

Fourteen Gallu guardians of Nergal awake!

God of the dead
Nergal they dread
Shamash, illuminate
Shamash, stretch your hand
Clash with the underworld

Ravaged drones obey!
Gaunt Dust Eaters, servants in E-Meslam

[Lead: Ashmedi]

God of the dead
Nergal they dread
Shamash, illuminate
Shamash, stretch your hand
Clash with the underworld
