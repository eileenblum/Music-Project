[Act I - Cast tempest from the east]

Winds rise! Seven ills will charge.
Vanquish cities of mankind and divine stellar spheres
Callous demons created in the vaults of the heavens
Raging storms, menacing gods are they

The first is the south wind - rampant havoc
The other is a dragon, whose mouth is the sky
The third is a terrible Shibbu
Fourth is a grim beast, which carries off the young

Tempest of malice
A tempest of vice
The right of Adad
Presaging the baneful storm
Conquer stellar spheres
At the right of Adad
Vanquish cities of man
They are stalking

Winds rise! Seven ills will charge
Conquer stellar spheres of Sin, vanquish cities of man
Created in vaults of the heavens, these callous demons
Bringers of the eclipse, menacing gods are they

The fifth is a furious wolf, who knoweth not to flee
The next is a rampart, which marches against god and king
The seventh is a storm - taking vengeance
Seven are they, messengers to king Anu

Tempest of malice
A tempest of vice
The right of Adad
Presaging the baneful storm
Conquer stellar spheres
At the right of Adad
Vanquish cities of man
They are stalking

Upholding the symbol of the crescent disk
Sin, lord of the oaths, the moon god of Ur
A duel for control with the seven winds

No bolt can turn them back
No door can shut them out
To wreak destruction
Forward they go

Deluge of delusional dreams

With a sanctified pestle and mortar
The counter spells are prepared

[Act II - Enlil's Retaliation]

Incomplete eclipse - Army of Sin rise [repeat]

Hearing these tidings
Elil shaped a plan to retaliate against the seven winds

Exalted Massu of the gods
In divine counsel
The Elder Lords they beheld

The horned crown placed on the throne
Designate the presence of Enlil - glorious one

Army of Sin rise... Rise!

When the seven evil gods storm to sacred vault
Retaliate!

Under Enlil's glare, the triads avenge
They set themselves angrily
The seven winds are subdued
...They will return
