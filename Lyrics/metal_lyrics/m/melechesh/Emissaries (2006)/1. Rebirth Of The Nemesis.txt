Dynasty of the Salt-Water People
Time is ripe for Uruk's typhoon
The circle is completed, the feeble is stampeded
The storm of shredded glass has proceeded

The howl of the Scaled Deity
Shrill like a whirlwind in a cave
Asserting its return
As a million lost souls tidal wave

Realized is the legend of legions
Headed by the Aqua Demon!
Tribes of the serpent - iron clad
Rebirth of the Nemesis - TIAMAT

Return with wings of liquid fire
From the desolate pre-universe
Ruling a domain much higher
You are the Creator! Are you the Creator?

Enumma Elish is re-written
Fate was never sealed in stone

The Aqua Demon once forgotten
Integration of the celestial (and) terrestrial

Enumma Elish is re-written
Fate was never sealed in stone

Returning with arrogant pride
Linking polarities of conjectures

Proclaimed on the citadels
of the Alpha post

It's all mapped on the hand

Returning with arrogant pride
Linking polarities of conjectures

Return with arrogant pride
The Serpent Nemesis
Queen of creation
Polytheistic light

Lla Tchaf Lla min Tiamat
Enuma Elish is re-written

Queen of the universe

Lla Tchaf Lla (min) Tiamat
Enuma Elish is re-written (repeat)

Don't fear don't, this deity, don't!
Rebirth of the Nemesis has been foretold
Return with wings of liquid fire
Fate was never sealed in stone
