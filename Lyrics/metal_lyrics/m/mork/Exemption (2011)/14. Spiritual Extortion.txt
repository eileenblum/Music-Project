Based on false promises you sell a piece of heaven
That the desperate mob buys without questioning.
Doesn't even matter what you've done in your life,
Murders, thieves, rapists there is always a price.
Salvation is for those who can afford it.

The world now is the fruit of your spiritual extortion!
Bringing false devotion and mind abortion!

Gaze upon this land now filled with hatred,
It is the consequence of your religion intolerance.
As you take from us everything through force or lies
The disbelief grows and spread in our blood,
Like a deadly taint taking over its carrier.

The world now is the fruit of your spiritual extortion!
Bringing false devotion and mind abortion!
Spiritual extortion!

Break the chains that let you trapped in ignorance
And see a world much bigger than you believed to be real.
Freedom of mind and soul comes from within
With the strenght of heresy.

Nosce te ipsum.
Nihil est quod homo efficere non possit.

Doubt, reflect and think over the words entrusted in your tongue
For they are venom to your life.
Reach your own ideals of a perfect life
And you will see the carapace that hides rottenness

Nosce te ipsum.
Nihil est quod homo efficere non possit.
Know yourself
To men nothing is impossible.
