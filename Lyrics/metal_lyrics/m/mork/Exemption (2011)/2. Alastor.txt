Bring the torture, spread the blood,
Convert the saints in angels of death.
Break the faith, shatter the soul,
Raise the army of infernal horde.

This is the task, wise demon
Who reduces mankind to agony.
Unmake the seal that hold me in this cel,
For I will bring the oblivion to the sinners.

Human desires will be created
By the grace of your fake illusion,
Fed by their week and little minds
Waiting the blessing to arrive.

Alastor, the name of pain,
The new aeon of terror.
Unequalled apostasy, servant of suffering,
Invoker of nemesis.

Spread my word of fire. 
Free my chaos in the land of the worms.
My worship will come to hew this cattle.

Twisted toughts,
Distortions of fake doctrines
From a fake society.
Domination upon your life
To make you believe in the mith.

Decay in numbness,
Inconsequent fools.
The end will come.

Bring the torture, spread the blood,
Convert the saints in angels of death.
Break the faith, shatter the soul,
Raise the army of infernal horde.

Give your lives to the torturer.
In his kingdom your race is dust.
Join him, and your body within darkness
Will overflow the pain.

Die with the hypocresy
And with the lies of your fake prophet,
Believing that salvation is at hand
And that hope will come between the black flames.

Alastor, the name of pain,
The new aeon of terror.
Unequalled apostasy, servant of suffering,
Invoker of nemesis.

Spread my word of fire.
Free my chaos in the land of the worms.
My worship will come to hew this cattle.

Twisted toughts,
Distortions of fake doctrines
From a fake society.
Domination upon your life
To make you believe in the mith.

Decay in numbness,
Inconsequent fools.
The end will come.

My legion, my slaves, my rules.
Of your impure blood I control all.
The crimson star of the damned,
Great Alastor, send the weaks to hell.
