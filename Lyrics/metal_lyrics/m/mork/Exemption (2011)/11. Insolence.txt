From the universeâs womb a new race is born,
That through time have shown itâs damned face,
Where corruption and lies predominate
In the land of the forgotten.

Addicted in its own pleasures,
Destruction is the leader to dominate.
Tamed by blood and soul
Possessing his body.

From the earth rise devastations
Pitiless for the justs.
The sin will command,
And the world, by its desorder, will perish in pain.

Denying the own creator,
Destroyed by his desires.
Corrupted by self inflicted fear
We fall on our knees.

Of their own speeches,
Death feeds their hearts with diabolical principles,
Invoking their souls in abysmal choirs.

Insolence is the bringer of storms,
Vanishing the filthness of illusions.
We search for the awakening of the mourning,
And face the scorn in this landscape of hell.
