In the depths of your intelectual pride
Fury and vengeance were consumed in orgy,
Observing those monstrous atrocities
Done by the holders of inquestionable faith.

Be dogmatic or manipulator
You shall instigate my disgust,
For the human being is nothing but a fool
That consumes the souls of the ones who are free.

I became a heretic,
My mind was free of such ignorances.
And I regarded for the true knowledge
Passed by our fathers.

Spirits of flesh and blood possessed his sinful body,
And now death is whithin.

One by one, the justice made itâs glory,
And the taste for freedom took form.
The flesh that burns, the bones that breaks and the endless screams
Echoed in the dimension of the saints.

Behold the hell that await for you beside his hammer.
Run for the abyss and die in despair.

One by one, I exterminate your pathetic teachings.
I free my brothers from ignorance.
We create chaos and persecute the worshipers,
Because we are the tyrants.

Become free.
Follow your own path
And the exalted knowledge will embrace you
With the angels of death.
