My Lord, The Alfa and the Omega,
I demand your resplenderous throne,
For I am the light that will cure souls
Of doubt and fear to sin.

My angels united, legions upon legions,
We are revolts of the stigmated domination.
We have the science and the sovereign knowledge
To unmask this tyranny.

See my army and fear!
We will rise!

You created me in perfection,
And the wonders of life are in my power.
God beneath my glory!
I have the powers of Heaven and Hell.

The battle will set us free of the holy supremacy,
Will eliminate the scorn protected by ignorance.
We need to unravel the human eyes,
To fight against the mental manipulation.

See my fury and bound!
We will rise!

You created me in perfection,
And the wonders of life are in my power.
God beneath my glory!
I have the powers of Heaven and Hell.

âMy path will be followed by millions.
For I am the rival of repression.
I will guide the sons of God
To deny the salvation
And freedom!â

God beneath my glory!
