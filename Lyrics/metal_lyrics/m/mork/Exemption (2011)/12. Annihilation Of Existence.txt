Behold the stars that pierce your eyes,
The tormented of the universe canât be understood.
Insignificant being, I will shatter your soul with my glibness.

Be cursed by the moonlight
With those profane words that I spit.
I will annihilate the existence of this nation
For the despair of Fate.

Lust, Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Wrath, Envy and Pride.
This is what you are.

Pathetic! Immolated!
What is your reason to live as such?
Deceived! Abandoned!
The truth has already putrefied your face.

Mortals, I come to decimate this love for temporary things.
The Grace has already deteriorated in your mental carnage.

Pathetic! Immolated!
What is your reason to live as such?
Deceived! Abandoned!
The truth has already putrefied your face.

I burn, I destroy, I bring hate
To this land, fucked by mankind.

I am the darkness and the light.
I am the reaper of the reapers.
I am the torment of Man.
I am the annihilation of existence.

[music: Gabriel, Rafael, Pedro and Samuel]
