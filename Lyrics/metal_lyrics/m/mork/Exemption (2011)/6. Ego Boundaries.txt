The fear, the wrath,
The doubt, the madness.

The roam, the lie,
The voice, the mistake

That pierce each single and uniform tought,
Draining the truths by your corroded throat.

He is your enemy.
He pull the strings of your mind.
He controls everything
And burn your soul.

The desire for your suicide is fomented constantly
By the devil projected from your interior.
Labyrinths of enigmas desconstruct your reasoning
And make you act as His will.

The pain
Of the paths to misconception.
The cruelty
Of knowing your ego.

Machiavellian conceptions of the evil that disturbs you.
Dread the one that seems damn.
Conflict with pure and faithfull ideologies
Drags you to the tempting darkness.

The pain
Of the paths to misconception.
The cruelty
Of knowing your ego.

âYour greatest enemy is your own inner perception,
Your own ignorance,
Your own ego.â

[music: Rafael, Pedro and Samuel]
[lyrics: Samuel]
