When fear is greater than all elements of the soul,
A prophecy of pain is written within Satan.

Sons of pain, rejected by your king, abandoned their dogmas
And lost power to the legions of the infernal pastorate.

Deluded by words of confort,
The race of the weak are doomed. 
Slaves to an ideological orgy, the teachings passed to you by the centuries 
Gorge in the flames of oblivion.

I prophesize the end of intellectual freedom.

You drank from the black grail,
Your souls now belong in the eternal agony 
Of knowing that you left your brothers to die.

I prophesize the end of intellectual freedom,
And the extinction of the virtuous.

Sons of pain, rejected by your king, abandoned their dogmas
And lost power to the legions of the infernal pastorate.

Be haunted forever by the screams trapped in your deepest thoughts.
Pain will never end, mankindâs suffering runs in your putrid veins.

I prophesize the end of intellectual freedom.

Filthy beings, lost honor to be tamed like swine by the great corrupt.
The curse will be delightful as your guts ripped by my hands.

I prophesize the end of intellectual freedom,
And the extinction of the virtuous.

There is no forgiveness for your kind.
Cross my path and feel the anger of your ancestors 
And the remorse of leaving your land.
Be enslaved by your new tyrant king,
And embrace the diabolical felling.
