My eyes reflect the hate for this race.
Their meanness burns my thoughts like embers of hell.
Whispers inside me beseech for their end.
Creatures of greed, my shame of existence.

Each filthy step that they take is a curse
Because their words deteriorate sanity.
Your fall represents my triumph,
And your nightmares my dreams.

I condemn!
Your carriage to hell is here.
I condemn you all!
Hateful kind.

In the fall of the night you will know that my wrath has awaken,
And the ones once tortured by you are now my brothers
And your worst enemies.

Now you can only pray to the one that is wont to listen,
For this is the time of purification 
With the bloodshed.

I condemn!
Your carriage to hell is here.
I condemn you all!
Hateful kind.

So I leave for you the insanity and desire of death,
Your death, my lifeâs elixir.
