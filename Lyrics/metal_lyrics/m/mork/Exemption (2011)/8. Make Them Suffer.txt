I have become greater than your God,
Greater than you and your pathetic creed.

Iâve purified my soul with hate,
And I demanded penitence.

Iâve broken the chains of this slavery.
Iâve crushed this plague with my sins.
Where the just and incredulous live there is a truth we need to find.
To disseminate for those blinded by probo nature.

Iâve purified my soul with vengeance,
From this malicious hordes.

I am alive to the world.

The pleasure in fornicate your spirit
Is part of his sickening orgasms.

Libera nos a malo. Amen. (Nos livre do mal. AmÃ©m)
Benedicite ecce homo. (AbenÃ§oa este homem)
Ora pro nobis. (Ora por nÃ³s)

Penetrating your inocence
With vomited teachings.

Libera nos a malo. Amen. (Nos livre do mal. AmÃ©m)
Benedicite ecce homo. (AbenÃ§oa este homem)
Ora pro nobis. (Ora por nÃ³s)

Can you see what theyâve done to your life?
Can you see what theyâve done to your soul?
Can you fell what theyâve done to your utterence?
Can you fell the hate?
Can you rise and fight for your dignity?

What will you do to make them suffer?
