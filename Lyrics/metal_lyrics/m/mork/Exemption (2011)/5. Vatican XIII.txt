Youâll be judged by me
For the heresy and the sins youâve committed.
Succumb by the torture that will make you regret what youâve done.

Gather my inquisitors
To vanish the despiteful kind.
Deliver them the punishment of god
And cast their souls in the abyss of suffering.

Burn in the righteous fire of my sacred church!
Give way to my will and bow to my holy name.
Beg for the mercy of the divine and renounce the profane!
Reveal the hidden heresy that lies behind the virtuous.

Impure thoughts lead to profane actions!
You shall be purified!
By our laws, sanctified!

Sanctifiedâ¦

Close your eyes for the holy contradictions,
Accept all as a gift of god.
Listen to the words of oppression and do as it says.

Do as it says...

Burn in the righteous fire of my sacred church!
Give way to my will and bow to my holy name.
Beg for the mercy of the divine and renounce the profane!
Reveal the hidden heresy that lies behind the virtuous.

Afflicting the souls of our foes we have endured for centuries,
Stimulating intolerances and providing confusion.
We dominate all who oppose us and lead them to ruin.
With an iron fist we tyrannize!
