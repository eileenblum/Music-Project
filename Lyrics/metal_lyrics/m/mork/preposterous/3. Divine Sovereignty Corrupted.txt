The earth, the skies are trembling in the night
By the voices of the failed sovereignty,
Dragging what they can deceive 
In the valleys of corrupted lands.
My face, my flesh are burning under the screams of the dammed

Bloodbath brought by the winds
With necrosis at every storm
Punisher empire, fulfill my desires!

Pure and decayed eyes, drowned in bitterness.
Possessed through poisons of time,
Oh fallen kings corrupted!
Your flagellate legs will breach once inhabited by your harvests,
Possessed through poisons of time,
Oh fallen kings corrupted!

Hypocrisy that reveals 
The crossroads of despair 
Where reason and temptation becomes as one
In the cycle of spiritual flesh

Pure and decayed eyes, drowned in bitterness.
Possessed through poisons of time,
Oh fallen kings corrupted!
Your flagellate legs will breach once inhabited by your harvests,
Possessed through poisons of time,
Oh fallen kings corrupted!

Now, supreme carnage of razors
Consume them inside the portal of fury
In the burning lakes of asleep dimensions
At misanthropic palaces

Glory of evil overcoming their faces 
Loyal subjects of submission and torture
Mankind deserves a savior such as you
Slayer of souls

My revenge, as history tells
Was forged in hate of complete disorder
Of damnation, and defiance to destroy. 

The earth, the skies are trembling in the night
By the voices of the failed sovereignty,
Dragging what they can deceive 
In the valleys of corrupted lands.
My face, my flesh are burning under the screams of the dammed
