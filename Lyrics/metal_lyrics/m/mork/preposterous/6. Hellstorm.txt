I reject the humans path
In blackness I see your rotted truth
Where men call them selves as gods

From hell your fury was fed.
This revealed the power of black heart,
O great dark torment!

Temples infected with lies made us burn our first bourns,
That over the burning flames announced his birth.
The despair of nations raised dead armies,
Turning their backs to us.
Tongues of fire will scorch the heavens
Proclaiming the infernal prophecy.

Abominating earth and sky,
Inverted dilacerated mind.
You will pay for the false truths that made us believe.

Innocents cried on their feet begging for mercy,
Although their honor carried blades.

Temples infected with lies made us burn our first bourns,
That over the burning flames announced his birth.
The despair of nations raised dead armies,
Turning their backs to us.
Tongues of fire will scorch the heavens
Proclaiming the infernal prophecy.

In the end there will be no mercy inside the hell storm,
The hell storm.

Abominating earth and sky,
Inverted dilacerated mind.
You will pay for the false truths that made us believe.

You will rot in the lake of the damned,
Were your lies will become claws dragging you under
And no one will hear your screams, no one will rescue you.
In the blackness and in the silence you will perish forever
Among your blind disciples, praying for your god.
