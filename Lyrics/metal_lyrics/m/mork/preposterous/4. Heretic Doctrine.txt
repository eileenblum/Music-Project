In hipocrisy they have emerged your cradle
Before the throne of perversity you have bound by the nails of the black doctrine
In the principles of true beliefs he created his fortress
Where his sacrifices for divinity falled in paranoi
Bilding a cript for his past of torments and blood

Come, heretic doctrine
And cast the abolition of this minded slaughterhouse
Where has been immaculated the roots of apostasy

For his unacceptable mistakes
The hybrids of discord have payed
In their own foundations lies the inexhaustible abomination 
All of those who inhabit the lands shall fall in endless agonizing hallucinations
That with ardor will expell of your mortifying thoughts
What is real in the human rottenness

Come, heretic doctrine
And cast the abolition of this minded slaughterhouse
Where has been immaculated the roots of apostasy

And the pain shall rise
Destroying the humankind
And Babylon will revive
Killing, corrupting, ripping, lacerating his body

[Acustic part]
For those who hear only the inner self
Believe in the power and seek for the veracious creed 
The one that is for destroying legacies
Of the envoys of blackness
