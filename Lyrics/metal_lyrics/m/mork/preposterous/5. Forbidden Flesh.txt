Rejection and disgust printed in all that we touch.
Hatred, repudiated and destroyed by their own words.
As we are from the inside, it comes out like rotted breath,
Contaminating what can find, feeding as a devourer of souls.

Poisoned by the cursed fruit
Laying beside the crypt
Deaf fools by the human disorder 
Shall serve for all the eternity  

In the pitch black of consciousness there is no more hope for sanity,
What has been left behind is obsolete and irreparable.
Damned land shall rot by the tumor that was generated in your own belly,
Casting down the destruction of your empire.

Poisoned by the cursed fruit
Laying besides the crypt
Deaf fools by the human disorder 
Shall serve for all the eternity  

Die by your ruler, inferior minds 
Behind the leprosy of truth, cruelty with pain lays 

Forbidden Flesh

In the eternal lake of torture pay for your exile.
All the gloom and all that remain lost in deathâs face.
A brilliant star shining like fire in those eyes,
Keeps your breath until the butcher feeds with your mind.

Forbidden Flesh

The dogs that waits behind the gates of infinity 
Cast the spells of black doomed night
A face within all this terror is finally revealed 
He hunts for you, donât try to deny the truth of the crucifix.

Forbidden Flesh
