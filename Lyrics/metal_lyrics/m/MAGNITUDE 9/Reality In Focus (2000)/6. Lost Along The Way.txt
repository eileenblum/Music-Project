Sailing into grater places out on a sea of gold
wandering into the mazes, the keys to life we hold
and we search for knowledge the power of our soul
we embrace the courage that leads us to the goal

And the winds of change must fill our sails and take us to that place
this could be our only one chance that is lost along the way
could be missed with only one glance lost along the way

Drifting on a sea of madness, we keep our dreams alive
counting on what fate will hand us, it`s changing all of our lives
we must race the current that leaves us from our home
and embrace the courage that leads us to the goal

Now the winds of change must fill our sails and take us to that place
this could be our only one chance that is lost along the way
could be missed with only one glance lost along the way

[solo: keys &amp; guitar]

Will we begin to discover the shore that lies ahead?

[solo]
[intro]

This could be our only one chance that is lost along the way
will we ever see what fortune lies ahead....lost along the way
Could be missed with only one glance....lost along the way
Will the winds of change take us to that place....lost along the way?
