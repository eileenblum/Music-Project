Looking on to the road of forever
finding my place along the way
longing to discover the places in my mind
trying to reach within my soul
and along the way I`ve discovered
the days I`m here are numbered
trying to climb out of the hole

Everyone`s in a race against the hands of time
now the time is at hand for us all
to face the truth on our own

Hearing the words, as we try to remember
a dream that was lost along the way

Longing to recover the memories of our mind
Trying to reach a common goal
and along the way they`ll discover
the days they`re here are numbered
trying to fight out of the hole

Everyone`s in a race against the hands of time
Now the time is at hand for us all

Now I`m standing here to face the world alone
and I`m running out of time
and I`m seeing clear, the way that I must go
and I fear that I won`t, and I fear that I don`t know the way

[solo]

Mind over fear, take a trip into your mind, into the unknown
Mind over fear, take a trip into your mind, into the unknown

Now I`m standing here to face the world alone
and I`m running out of time
and I`m seeing clear, the way that I must go
in the race of mankind
now I standing here to face the world alone
and I`m running out of time
and I fear that I won`t
and I fear that I don`t know the way

[solo/break]

Mind over fear
Take a trip into your mind, into the unknown
mind over fear
to a place where you will find, into the unknown
mind over fear
take a trip into your mind, into the unknown
mind over fear
to a place where you will find, into the unknown
