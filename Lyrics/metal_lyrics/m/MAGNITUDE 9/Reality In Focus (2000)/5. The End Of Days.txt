End of days, still remains in question
We`re living in these times
have we known it all along?
Could it be, that we never noticed
what`s right in front of our eyes
And all along we`ve hid within ourselves
Don`t know what to do but I feel the fear myself
and the emptyness surrounds me
not revealed, but I know someday
we`ll be given all of the signs
We`ve confused them all along
Can`t we feel, that the world is changing
It`s drifting from our lives
and all along we`ve hid within ourselves
don`t know what to do I feel the fear myself

[solo: Keys/guitars]

We all are lost souls, our destiny remains
Our lives begin again, in the end of days

[solo: Keys]

Can`t believe, that we never noticed, right before our eyes
and al along we`ve hid within ourselves
don`t know what to do but I feel the fear myself

We all are lost souls, our destiny remains
Our lives begin again, in the end of days
