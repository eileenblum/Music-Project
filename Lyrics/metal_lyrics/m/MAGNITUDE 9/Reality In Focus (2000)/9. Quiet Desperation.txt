Looks like it`s over
the beginning of the end, between you and me
there`s sadness in your heart
trying to hold back the tears in your eyes

I`m empty inside; my soul`s left to die without you
I`m losing my mind
and I don`t know what I should do

Try to retrace where we wnt wrong
it`s not the same without you

This indecision is tearing us apart
leading to this quiet desperation
Our lack of vision, we`ve carried from the start
leading to this quiet desperation

Now our lives are torn apart

[solo]

I`m empty inside; my soul`s left to die without you
I'm losing my mind and I don`t know what I should do

We said forever, can we comprehend, how it use to be
and it`s breaking us apart
threatening to take all the dreams in our lives

This indecision is tearing us apart
leading to this quiet desperation
Our lack of vision, we`ve carried from the start
leading to this quiet desperation
