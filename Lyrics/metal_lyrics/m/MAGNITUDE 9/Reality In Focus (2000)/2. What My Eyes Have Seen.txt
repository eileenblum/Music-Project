I saw the sun today in the usual way
but there`s been an unseen change
and we carry on with our lives, like we`ll live forever
but the fact remains, we`ll continue this way, the only ones to blame
it s time to realize, that we`re in this together

Flying high above blue skies, on wings we`ll never see
knowing only for a while,we try to change our minds
try to face the truth and open up your eyes

It's a sad disgrace, and we`re losing the race
our greed has made us blind
now we`re far beyond our needs
and too late to recover

Flying high above blue skies, on wings we`ll never see
knowing only for a while,we try to change our minds
try to face the truth and open up your eyes
Staring over endless miles, a memory where we have been
hoping we`ll remember, what our eyes have seen

Sa the world today, always spinning away
while the simple fact remains

That the balance og mandkind, will be changed forever
how can we, a society, make ammends to save our race
while we rob our future bilnd, knowing forever

Can`t we remember, we`re in this together
there will not be another way

Flying high above blue skies, on wings we`ll never see
knowing only for a while,we try to change our minds
try to face the truth and open up your eyes
Staring over endless miles, a memory where we have been
hoping we`ll remember, what our eyes have seen

hoping we`ll remember, what our eyes have seen
