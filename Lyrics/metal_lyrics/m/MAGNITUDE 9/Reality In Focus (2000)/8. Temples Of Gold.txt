Temples of gold ascend to the sky
Monuments made for their kings
as they wait for the sign
Towers of stone, still mystify, ruins are all that remain
Faith in their god they relied

How long til the heavens are one with the earth
and the fire will rise from below
how many times have we try to deny
as if it has happened before
we see but nobody wants to be told

As we stare into the sky and believe we are not alone

Omens were scribed, the writings remain
reminding of what to foresee
did they know so long ago?

Progression of time, technology breeds, a powerful society
denying the words heard before

How long til the heavens are one with the earth
and the fire will rise from below
how many times have we try to deny
as if it has happened before
we see but nobody wants to be told

As we stare into the sky and believe we are not alone

How long til the heavens are one with the earth
and the fire will rise from below

"and there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon,and in the stars
and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity
the sea and the waves roaring, men`s hearts falling them for fear,
and for looking after these things which are comming on the earth
for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken,
and when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your
heads
for your redemption draweth near"
[Luke 21:25,26,28 King James]

How long til the heavens are one with the earth
and the fire will rise from below
how many times have we try to deny
