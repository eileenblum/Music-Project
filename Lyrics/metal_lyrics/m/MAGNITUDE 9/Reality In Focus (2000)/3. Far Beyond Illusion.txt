With my eyes wide open and a clear and conscious mind
The words you`ve spoken, causing me to redefine
The way I feel, the words cannot describe
I know it`s real,it`s up to me to realize

I`m running on emotions, fleeing to the light
I`m drifting on a ocean, sailinghome tonight

Are they afraid og what we see, they draw their own conclusions
this twist of fate between you and me is far beyond illusion....
...far beyond illusion

are you afraid, to tell me how you feel
can you deny, when you know the feeling`s real
is the path you`ve chosen, one you wish to lead
can you ignore the hunger, the one you know you want to feed?

I`m running on emotions, fleeing to the light
I`m drifting on a ocean, sailinghome tonight

Are they afraid og what we see, they draw their own conclusions
this twist of fate between you and me is far beyond illusion....
...far beyond illusion

[solo]

Are they afraid og what we see, they draw their own conclusions
this twist of fate between you and me is far beyond illusion....
...far beyond illusion....
...far beyond illusion

[distorted vocal] With my eyes wide open, far beyond illusion
and a clear and conscious mind, far beyond illusion
The words you`ve spoken, causing me to redefine
far beyond illusion
