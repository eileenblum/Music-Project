Riding along the wasteland, this barren stretch of earth
We plan the battle of our lives.

We`ll march `til nightfall and scout a place to lie
Our enemy will not expect an attack, behind their lines
Send out the call to the ridings ones, to fall back `til I give the word
By the sword they`ll be dying here the price paid in an act of war

They better run for their lives, or stand and fight
They`ll make the sacrifice, forever we roam

Will we live through today, the battle will rage, on the attack
We will fight to defend all our own, no turning back
The plan has been made, tomorrow we raid
knowing an ending is near
dispite of an outcome we fear, no turning back.

What is the cause for outrage, is there more than meets the eye?
Our sanity is displaced, by the choice to fight or die
I hear the cries of the dying ones
As we fight through the bloody war
Our enemies turn and run away,"It`s not worth fighting for"

They better run for their lives, or stand and fight
They`ll make the sacrifice, forever we roam

Will we live through today, the battle will rage, on the attack
we will fight to defend all our own, no turning back
The plan has been made, tomorrow we raid
Knowing an ending is near
Dispite of an outcome we fear, no turning back

"But if the cause is not good, a heavy burden lies on the King"

[solo]

Will we live through today, the battle will rage, on the attack
We will fight to defend all our own, no turning back
The plan has been made, tomorrow we raid
knowing an ending is near
dispite of an outcome we fear, no turning back.

Out on this barren wasteland, no turning back
The balance of life, lies within our hands
Out of this barren wasteland, no turning back.
