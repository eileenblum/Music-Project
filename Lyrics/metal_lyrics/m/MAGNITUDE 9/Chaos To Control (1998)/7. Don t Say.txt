Feeling alone, it`s so cold inside,why did you ever leave
fear of the pain, I can`t no longer hide all that`s inside of me

Afraid to admit that it`s over, we`ve gone our own way
and now it`s lost forever, now there`s nothing left to say

Stay, don`t walk away, just don`t say, it?s over
wait, don`t throw it away, just can`t say it`s over.

Why can`t we try to re-right all the wrong, bring it back again
God knows I`ve wanted to hold you for so long

Afraid to admit that it`s over, we`ve gone our own way
and now it`s lost forever, now there`s nothing left to say

Stay, don`t walk away, just don`t say, it?s over
wait, don`t throw it away, just can`t say it`s over.
Try another day, don`t end it this way, just don`t say it`s over
Try to find a way, say that you`ll stay, just don`t say it`s over

[solo]

Stay, don`t walk way....[repeat]....
