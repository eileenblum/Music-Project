Chart a course to the of unknown
where the sun and the moon may show
to a place where no one`s been before

And the tide is rising higher every day
the risk is greater the longer that we wait

I hear voices of doubt, haunting my every move
as we keep our eyes to the starlit sky
we journey onward,
with hopes of what we`ll find
We`re crossing over to another world

Our fears controlling every step we take
Could this decision be the last that we make

I hear voices of doubt, haunting my every move
as we keep our eyes to the starlit sky
we journey onward,
with hopes of what we`ll find
We`re crossing over to another world

[solo]

I hear voices of doubt haunting my every move
as we keep our eyes, to the starlit sky
we journey onward with hopes of what we`ll find
we`re crossing over, to another world....to the other side.......
