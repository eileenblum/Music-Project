As I lie awake, amidst the silence, I think about the places you might be,
although the feeling`s not gone, I know it`s you I`m far from and this
loneliness is consuming me.

And I scream out loud but no one hears, alone in this silence to face my fears

I wait for the moment when you come back again, thought that you always be
there till the end of time

Never thought I`d see the day, never thought that time would end

[solo]

I feel the pain and sadnes, I`m alone in this madness, Can`t change a thing to
bring you back to me, I still feel you, you`re here but my thoughts are not
clear, I`m not the same, as I used to be

Never thought I`d see the day,never thought that time would end

I wait fir the moment, when you come back again, Thought that you`d always be
there, till the end of time, Now the walls come closing in. as I close my
mind, Time`s running short for us, to the end of time, End of time, end of
time,end of time

Thought that you`d always be there, end of time, Now the walls come closing
in, end of time, end of time,end of time......
