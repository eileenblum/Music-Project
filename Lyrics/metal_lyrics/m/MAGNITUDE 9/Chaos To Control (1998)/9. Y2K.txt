In the name of progress
they created the machine
A chain reaction,things unforeseen

can it see me, will it read my mind
does it feel me, it`s not far behind
feed it knowledge
our mistake from the past

In the future will we lose control?
This wizandry will take it`s toll
We set out to answer
to search the unknown
did we end up in a road to nowhere

[solo]

It`s a matter of time before we see the day
When we realize that
we`re trapped in the maze

[solo]

It reads the code, with it`s one track mind
will technology cause the end of mandkind?
the age of innocence lost, at whose cost?

In the future will we lose control?
This wizandry will take it`s toll
We set out to answer
to search the unknown
did we end up in a road to nowhere
