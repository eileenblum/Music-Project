You say you`d give anything to know
You say you`d live anyway to go
you`re reaching for the stars, careful what you wish for
what`s the price you`ll pay, it may come to you

Who`s to say, if you had the chance, you would
Would you be content if you realized you could

Do you really want to know, who is the keeper of your soul...

So there is no way to get out
and you`ve just been played the fool
Sad to realize it isn`t what it seems
and your innocence has been lost within the scheme

You`re reaching for the stars, careful what you wish for
What`s the price you`ll pay, it may come to you
Makes me wonder why we dream for it all
Time to open your eyes, before you step to fall

Do you really want to know, who is the keeper of your soul
For a price you give it all, who is the keper of your soul

[solo]

They`ll say you`re the reason for it all
and the bigger they make you, the harderyou`ll fall
You`re reaching for the stars, careful what you wish for
what`s the price you`ll pay, it may come to you

Do you really want to know, who is the keeper of your soul
For a price you give it all, who is the keeper of your soul....
