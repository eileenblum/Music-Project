I`m sitting, I`m waiting,I`m watching as the day goes by, and I`m wondering if
I can find some answers to the reason why, and I feel I need to make some
changes in my life, Took some time to realize that there will come a day, and
I?m not the only one to have ever felt this way, although the feelings have
been numb, the memories still remain

As the curtains starts to fall on the stages of life,and the lights begin to
fade away, as we search for distant signs, to find a common goal, for the
meaning to it all, Into the Sun....

And we`re running out of time, we dream for something more, as we disappear
into the setting sun, into the setting sun
and my eyes begin to close, for another day, and I feel I`m getting close, it
all seems so far away

As the curtains starts to fall on the stages of life, and the lights begin to
fade away, as we search for distant signs to find a common goal, for the
meaning to it all, into the sun, and we`re running out of time, we dream for
something mere, as we disappear in....

[solo]

As we search for distant signs, to find a common goal, for the meaning to it
all, into the sun....and we`re running out of time, we dream for something
more...
As we disappear in...

And my eyes begin to close today and I feel I`m getting close, the lessons
learned along the waym will always chance with time, Dream for something more
today, leave the past behind
Heading into the sun....into the sun....
