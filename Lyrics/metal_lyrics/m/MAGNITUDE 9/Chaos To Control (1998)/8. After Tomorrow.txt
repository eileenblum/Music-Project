What would we say if our lives we live today, had suddenly made a chance
How would we feel if our fear became real, and everything`s gone away

I can`t seem to remember nothing at all
Memories lost with time I can`t recall
We`re running through life trying to reach out dreams
As our whole world around us is falling apart at the seams

When will it end now we`re falling, will we know after tomorrow

We may not see the way it will be if the sands have run out of time

I can`t seem to remember nothing at all
Memories lost with time I can`t recall
We`re running through life trying to reach out dreams
As our whole world around us is falling apart at the seams

When will it end now we`re falling, will we know after tomorrow

[solo]

Searching to find the way, feels like I`ve lost control
lonely I long for the day I can get back to my home

We`ll never know what fate has to hold in the balance of our life

I can`t seem to remember nothing at all
Memories lost with time I can`t recall
We`re running through life trying to reach out dreams
As our whole world around us is falling apart at the seams

When will it end now we`re falling, will we know after tomorrow
