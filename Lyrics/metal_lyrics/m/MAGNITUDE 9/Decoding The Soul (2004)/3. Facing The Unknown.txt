Now I cannot feel, I am numb from the pain of yesterday
So insane it remains unreal like it was never really happening
To you, to me, together all alone in this reality

Wherever we may go, whatever we may find
Our fate is what we hold, can our fears be left behind?
How are we to know when tomorrow's due in time
We can never give up hope and leave the fear behind
And leave our fear behind

Seems hard to believe, all the lives that were changed by destiny
And I've had my time to grieve, now the anger's growing
Deep inside of you and me, together all alone in this reality

Wherever we may go, whatever we may find
Our fate is what we hold, can our fears be left behind?
How are we to know when tomorrow's due in time
We can never give up hope and leave the fear behind
And leave our fear behind
Yeah

Wherever we may go, whatever we may find

Wherever we may go, whatever we may find
Our fate is what we hold, can our fears be left behind?
How are we to know when tomorrow's due in time
We can never give up hope and leave the fear behind

And leave our fear behind
Yeah
