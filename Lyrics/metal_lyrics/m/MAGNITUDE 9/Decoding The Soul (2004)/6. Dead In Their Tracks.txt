Burning with fire, determined desire to rule all with their "Iron
Fist"
Eyes filled with rage, as they march through the blaze
To rape unknown lands in their midst

Fighting the wars between them - Impacting innocent lives

As it begun, war rages on - To the victor the spoils of war
The fight will be long, we must be strong - See the fear in their eyes
We will fight like we're Gods of war!

They will be dead in their tracks, as we lead the attack
We battle with sweat blood and tears
The war plans are made, as we plan to engage
To seek and destroy all that lives

Fighting the wars between them, paying the ultimate price

As it begun, war rages on - To the victor the spoils of war
The fight will be long, we must be strong - See the fear in their eyes
We will fight like we're Gods of war

Oh how can we stop this world from hurting?
Can we search for inner peace
Like a wheel that keeps on spinning, turning
In our faith we must believe - Yeah!

As it begun war rages on - To the victor the spoils of war
The fight will be long, we must be strong - See the fear in their eyes
We will fight!

As it begun war rages on - To the victor the spoils of war
The fight will be long, we must be strong
We must be strong - See the fear in their eyes
We will fight like we're Gods of war

Gods of war
