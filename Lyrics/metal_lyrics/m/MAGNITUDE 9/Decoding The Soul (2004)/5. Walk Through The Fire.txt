The mirror reflects with uncertainty
Like the mist that clouds the vision of the choice that's plainly seen
The new day greets with bitter sweet beginnings
My heart's in another place, that it has never been

The saddening truth, to my reality
I am stuck within this moment in which I cannot change

Walk through the fire alone - Baptized my soul again
Walk through the fire alone
And I am stuck within this moment - Yeah again

Now I am left with uncertainty, view my life with clouded vision
All the choices not plainly seen
Another day greets me with such sweet beginnings
My soul's in another place, that it has never been

The saddening truth, to my reality - I am stuck within this moment
The saddening truth, to my reality - In which I cannot change

Walk through the fire alone - Baptized my soul again
Walk through the fire alone
And I am stuck within this moment

Walk through the fire alone - Baptized my soul again
Walk through the fire alone
And I am stuck within this moment - Yeah again
