Try to trace the steps, look to find a reason
Hidden truths we missed, changes all that we believe in
The shadows won't reflect, the waters we're too deep in
Taken one last breath, before we dive into the deep end

The changes we must face, are facing you and me
Now I'm searching for the truth in our faith we must believe
Find the truth, the lies they speak
Try to find a reason
Find the truth, the lies they speak

Searching for a place
Trying to achieve
Promises they make
All they want us to believe
See the grin upon their face, an image that misleads
The masses will embrace, all the lies that they will speak

The changes we must face, are facing you and me
Now I'm searching for the truth in our faith we must believe
Try to find a reason
Now I'm searching for the truth in our faith we must believe
Try to find a reason

Search to find the truth, a faith that we believe in
Change your point of view and try to find a reason

The changes we must face, are facing you and me
Search to find the truth, in a faith we can believe in

Now I'm searching for the truth in our faith we must believe
Try to find a reason
Now I'm searching for the truth in our faith we must believe
Try to find a reason
Now I'm searching for the truth in our faith we must believe
Don't you know that it's our faith we must believe
Try to find a reason
Find the truth, the lies they speak
Try to find a reason
Find the truth, the lies they speak
Try to find a reason
