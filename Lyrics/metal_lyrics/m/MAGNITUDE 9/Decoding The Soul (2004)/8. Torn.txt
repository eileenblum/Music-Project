Another day, another place for me, another chapter in my life
Hard to believe, how my life has changed
As I leave the remnants of my past behind
More and more I've learned to see
How I lived my life so completely blind

I couldn't know, all the changes seen in the pictures of my life
I was afraid, but you've come to me, now I can't believe my eyes
Can't believe my eyes

Call on me, I can hear your voice as the winds carry away
Set me free, from the darkest days
I can never tell you just how much you have changed my life
More and more I've learned to see
How I've lived my life so completely blind

I couldn't know, all the changes seen in the pictures of my life
I was afraid, but you've come to me, now I can't believe my eyes
Can't believe my eyes

Call on me, I can hear your voice as the winds carry away

I couldn't know, all the changes seen in the pictures of my life
I was afraid, but you've come to me, now I can't believe my eyes
Can't believe my eyes
