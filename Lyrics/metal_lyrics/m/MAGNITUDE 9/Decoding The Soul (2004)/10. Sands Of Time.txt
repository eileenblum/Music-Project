My boy, he said, listen to me, I've lived my life alone
Now alone I'm left to be someone I do not know
Someone who I can't agree
Time is running out now it's plain for me to see

My life was wasted on a dream

The sands of time won't wait for me
The winds of change have blown my way, for one last time

I was a lot like you, faced the world
With the strength of youth
Thought that I was strong
Had my own points of view
It's a sad fact of life,
There is beginning and an end
The race we have with time
Will we ever comprehend?

My life was wasted on a dream

The sands of time won't wait for me
The winds of change have blown my way, for one last time
The sands of time won't wait for me
The winds of change have blown my way, for one last time

If I could live it over again, I think I'd live it over again

The sands of time won't wait for me
The winds of change have blown my way, for one last time

The sands of time won't wait for me
The winds of change have blown my way, for one last time
