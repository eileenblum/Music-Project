[Spoken Word]
And I saw a new heaven, and a new Earth,
But the first heaven and the first Earth were past away,
And there was no more sea.

Holding their dreams,
They believed that they could move the mountains
Always believed,
What they could see was only truth beyond illusion.
The power of faith,
They controlled their fate and they controlled the heavens.
They never chose between,
The promise of faith or the fears of false delusions?

Channeled through the mind, the powers of unseen
We can't hear the voices, the difference between you and me
They see through the mind's eye

The powers that be, controlling all our lives, and our destiny
Why can't we see through the centered curtain
To confirm what we believe?

Channeled through the mind, the powers of unseen
We can't hear the voices, the difference between you and me
They see through the mind's eye

Crossing over into a world few have ever seen
They have made their decision, to carry through,
Into a new dimension
Into a new dimension

[Spoken word]
They are of the world,
Therefore speak they of the world and the world hear-eth hem,
We are of God he that know-eth God hear-eth us

Crossing over into a world few have ever seen
They have made their decision, to carry through,
Into a new dimension

Crossing over into a world few have ever seen
They have made their decision, to carry through,
Into a new dimension
Into a new dimension - Into a new dimension

[Spoken word] And there was no more sea.
