Lock all of the doors
Before you close your eyes and go to sleep
The creatures of the night
Will prey upon the young and weak
Feel your blood flowing through your veins
Your heart is quickening
They can smell your fear
As the dark of the night
Becomes our reckoning

In the dead of the night, they prey upon our dreams
Thirty days of night
As we pray for the light, they feed upon our screams
Thirty days of night

The taste of blood, calls to them
The Devil's symphony
The frenzy has begun, they come in the night
To feed their lifeblood for eternity

In the dead of the night, they prey upon our dreams
Thirty days of night
As we pray for the light, they feed upon our screams
Thirty days of night
Thirty days of night

You better pray for the light

In the dead of the night, they prey upon our dreams
Thirty days of night
As we pray for the light, they feed upon our screams
Thirty days of night

In the dead of the night, they prey upon our dreams
Thirty days of night
As we pray for the light, they feed upon our screams
