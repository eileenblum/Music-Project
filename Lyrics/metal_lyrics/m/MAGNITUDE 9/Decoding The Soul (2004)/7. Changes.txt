I close my eyes, and say goodbye to the day
And I'm feeling older, but I've missed it all somehow
And I begin to wonder if we've forgotten all about
Why are we here and what we should know
These things that we fear are only the unknown

And I'm looking to the son and I'm asking if he knows
Of wonderful places where everyone's supposed to go?
And the seams have come undone, scattered pieces of my soul
Now the pressure is taking it's toll

Changing reasons - Changing through time
Won't come between us
And it's changing our lives

And the winter's colder
And all of life evolves around
And as the world grows colder
And more clues to life are found
Why we are here and what we should know
These things that we fear are only the unknown

And I'm looking to the son and I'm asking if he knows
Of wonderful places where everyone's supposed to go?
And the seams have come undone, scattered pieces of my soul
Now the pressure is taking it's toll

Changing reasons - Changing through time
Won't come between us
And it's changing our lives

Won't come between us, I close my eyes and fade away
And I say goodbye to the day
And I'm looking to the son and I'm asking if he knows
Of the wonderful places where everyone's supposed to go

Why we are here and what we should know
These things that we fear are only the unknown

And I'm looking to the son and I'm asking if he knows
Of wonderful places where everyone's supposed to go?
And the seams have come undone, scattered pieces of my soul
Now the pressure is taking it's toll

Changing reasons - Changing through time
Won't come between us
Won't come between us
And it's changing our lives
