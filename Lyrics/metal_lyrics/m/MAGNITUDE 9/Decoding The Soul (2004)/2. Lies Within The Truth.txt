Running away, chasing my dreams I've created problems
Trying to say, what I am feeling is hopeless and I am
Calling to you, though it never seems that you are ever open
What will I do to change the way I feel I know I am hopeless

And I believed in you, when you came into my life
Now I'm so far away

After all the things that we've been through seems like yesterday
Will we ever understand the lies within the truth?

Counting the times I could have changed my ways
And how I should have treated you
Changing my mind a thousand times it seems
I never knew what I should do

I was afraid, but you never noticed all the fear I hid from you
What will I do to change the way I feel I know I am hopeless

And I believed in you, when you came into my life
Now I'm so far away

After all the things that we've been through seems like yesterday
Will we ever understand the lies within the truth?
After following dreams I've seen the truth
Now the fear has gone away
Will we ever understand the lies within the truth

And I believed in you, when you came into my life
Now I'm so far away

After all the things that we've been through seems like yesterday
Will we ever understand the lies within the truth?
After following dreams I've seen the truth
Now the fear has gone away
Will we ever understand the lies within the truth?

The lies within the truth.
