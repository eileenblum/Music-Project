Odin called us to war
Far away to foreign shore
Dragonships pound through the water
Onwards horror, onwards slaughter

Our banners flying high
Through the blackened midnight sky
Riding on our steeds of doom
Swords and axes gleaming in the moon

This night is an unholy one
We kill the Christians one by one
Revenge for our enslaved brothers
Triumphant the gods of our fathers

We burn their homes and kill their creed
The unholy fury will not deplete
The water on the shore turns red
When we depart their god is dead

Serving our highest god
Wading through Christian blood
Breaking bones and ripping guts
Wading through Christian blood
Their wives and children spare them not
Wading through Christian blood
Let their bodies lie to rot
Wading through Christian blood
Pouring like streams and flood
Wading through Christian blood
