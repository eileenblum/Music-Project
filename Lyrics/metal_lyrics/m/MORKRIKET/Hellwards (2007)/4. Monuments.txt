Monuments of faith
Turning into dust
As the sun no longer shines
The portal opens..

Aspects of faith crumbles
Heaven above disappears
As the black hole rises
Darkness floats out..

Religious beliefs
Denied by logic
Animalistic instinct
Return to man..

Desecration
Of all values
Nothing is sacred
All is emptiness

The world drowned
In fire and ashes
Eternal blackness
Bleeding through
