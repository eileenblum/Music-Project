Through the ages I acquired Knowledge
Knowledge of the forbidden secret kind
Black loathsome alchemy brought forth
Brought forth the hideous elixir of life
The price was submission to the master with horns
Live life as a demon and worship the saints of hell

Henceforth I was bound to a life in darkness
Studying the black arts in the secrecy of night
With open arms I embrace all the gifts of the second sight
I was malicious adviser of the kings
Every fruit that was ripe I picked for Satan

Hail, hail, hail Satan
Hail, hail, hail the unholy Lord

I am the one
Ruler of all the earth
Come and join my legions

I float above the stars
I roam beneath the earth
Hunting the sheep of the weakling

For i am the law
The aeon old prophecy
I am the eye in the darkness

Walk the hidden path
For at the end there will be
Hell in all its glory
