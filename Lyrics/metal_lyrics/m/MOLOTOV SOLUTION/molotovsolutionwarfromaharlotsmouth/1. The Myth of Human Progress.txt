The first step to revolution is consciousness,
So I wont stop screaming at you until this all make sense.

"Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists", says the president.
In that case I'm with the "terrorists".

Its 2006, and we're still labeling indigenous individuals "terrorists"?!
Like the "hostile" native Americans of the 1840s, no difference.

But your history books omitted that part about this place,
Dashing infants' heads on rocks, millions of natives slaughtered and raped.

Instead we're fed romanticized versions of our history at an early age,
conditioning us into accepting the mass genocides of today.

Like the current one in Iraq (and other government sponsored terrorist attacks.)

Meanwhile millions of "Support our Troops" magnets are sold,
But I don't see any of the buyers crying out "Bring them home!"

Cant you see that giving up liberty does not bring security, but instead total fucking tyranny?! 
Pick up a book and read about our fucking history.
And you'll see that giving up liberty does not bring security, but instead only fucking tyranny.

The very first step to revolution is consciousness,
And I'll never stop screaming until this all makes sense.
