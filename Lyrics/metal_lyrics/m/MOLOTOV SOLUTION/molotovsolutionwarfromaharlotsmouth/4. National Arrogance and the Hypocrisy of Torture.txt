Sodomized with broomsticks dripping with acid,Forced to engage in anal sex"Now smile for the camera!"Female prisoners raped by guards,Young children's genetalia crushed in front of their parents,"Now answer the question!"What the fuck is this? I don't want to hear Saddam was evil, torturing and raping his "own people", because the one's getting off on this sickening shit are some of your nation's people. Am I the only one who sees the hypocrisy in the torturing of supposed "enemies"? And this administration's choice to do business with a company running sex-slave-trade-rings? Little girls kidnapped right from their fucking homes,swiftly shipped all over the world to be sold,Toddlers heads blown off for the latest snuff flick,legislation stalled by DynCorp lobbyists. And we let this continue even after its admitted, and it makes me sick. How could anyone just ignore this shit? It makes me sick. (I do these things not to change the world but so that this world will never change me.) Fuck everyone who has ever tried to tell me we have no control over what tomorrow may bring, because the reason there's some truth in that belief is that so many possess that mentality.
