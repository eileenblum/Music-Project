Enslaved by your fear, by your unquestioned faith because for you it is easy to obey
If unquestioned faith is slavery; then we are all slaves to the monetary system, and the dollar is our shackles
In God We Trust
Physical slavery requires people to be housed and fed.
Economic slavery requires people to feed and
House themselves constant inflation, devaluing the dollar while destroying our lives, the erosion of sustenance.
Guaranteed by the weakness of mankind, we're all robbed blind by a system that doesn't care.
Enslaved by your fear, by your fear, by your unquestioned faith because for you it is easy to obey.
Welcome to your grave
You lived your life like a slave, you dug your own grave
Welcome to your grave
Welcome to your grave
If unquestioned faith is slavery; then we are all slaves to the monetary system, and the dollar is our shackles
In God We Trust
"It is as international as murder, as greed for power, as injustice, as madness
In our time these horrors are translated into political and cultural actuality..."
Impairment of virtue and morality; the corruption of luxury among the moral majority
Get on your knees and beg! Through fear there is no salvation
Get on your knees and beg! Through fear there is no salvation
Get on your knees and fucking beg!
