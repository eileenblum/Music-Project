Severed should have been the serpent's head as thunder broke through the endless night
By the time the sun shone through, the forked fascist tongue no longer spoke
Under the disguise of peace and prosperity his seed has grown into the perfect monstrosity
Adapting, consuming, and destroying everything that gets in its way
Nurtured from good willed conservatism into the national socialists dream,
A monolithic apparatus, the ultimate killing machine.
Its branches reaching every degree
Under the disguise of peace and prosperity, you've been blind to his true identity
For the beast is no single entity, its existence alone is an atrocity
Corrupting the land of the free, it's backed by corporate greed
Headed by its monopolies on what we need, think, and see.
Corrupting the land of the free, contrived by the elite.
Headed by its monopolies on what we need, think, and see.
Under the disguise of peace and prosperity, the serpent has risen portraying sincerity, corrupting the minds of our posterity
Severed should have been the serpent's head as thunder broke through the endless night
By the time the sun shone through, the forked, fascist tongue no longer spoke, laying dormant until now
