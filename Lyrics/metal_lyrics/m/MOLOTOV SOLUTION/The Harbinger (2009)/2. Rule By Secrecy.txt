Heavy lies the crown of the treacherous king, the self appointed monarch of society
His subservient drones do his bidding, blindly manipulated under his decree
A thousand global elite meeting in secrecy, politicians and corporate kings of a false monarchy
Clandestine pacts and treaties, that's not democracy, just their plan for control, villainizing you and me
We are the enemy
To those who rule by secrecy
We are the enemy
To those who rule by secrecy
Today he controls the six billion members of the human community not with force, but through deceit and secrecy
We are the enemy
To the corrupt makers of policy and international bankers that seek to profit off of our slavery
We are the enemy
To those who rule by secrecy
It's time to overthrow the king
Death to the king!
A thousand global elite meeting in secrecy, politicians and corporate kings of a false monarchy
Clandestine pacts and treaties, that's not democracy, just their plan for control, villainizing you and me
He is the father of murderers and thieves, the power hungry, the clandestine
Heavy lies the crown of the treacherous king, the self appointed monarch of society
His subservient drones do his bidding, blindly manipulated under his decree
Heavy lies the crown of the treacherous king, the self appointed monarch of society
His subservient drones do his bidding, blindly manipulated under his decree
Their treachery knows no bounds, a monarchy of tainted crowns
Protected by the dark they conspire, secret societies that built an empire
This is more than just a question of whether or not their war is upon us
It is where we draw the line; make the sacrifice to save our lives.
To save our liberties?
We, we are the enemy!
Death to the king!
We, we are the enemy!
Death to the king!
This is more than just a question of whether or not their war is upon us
Draw the line; make the sacrifice to save our lives.
To save our liberties?
