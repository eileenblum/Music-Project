I don't care if you think I should live my life my life by your rules and standards
You have no real faith and I have no faith in you
I have no faith in your corruption
I have no faith in your corruption
Fuck what you say there is no one way to live your life, no one path to follow
You have no real faith and I have no faith in you
You will not close my, my open eyes, your god will not control me I won't believe your lies
Ignorance...hardens the heart and enslaves the mind
Ignorance...hardens the heart and enslaves the mind
Only the dead will see the end of this fucking war
Only the dead will see the end of this fucking war
I have no faith in your corruption
I have no faith in your corruption
You've attempted to eradicate, any challenge to your authority,
By the most violent means, for blind faith can only lead to slavery
Let your throats be ripped out your eyes sewn shut
I don't need your psalms of hope, I'll try my luck
Only the dead will see the end of this fucking war
Only the dead will see the end of this fucking war
I don't give a fuck about you or how you think I should live my life
