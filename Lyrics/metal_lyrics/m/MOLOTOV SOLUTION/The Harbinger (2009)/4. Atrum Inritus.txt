Don't wait for the corporate controlled media to inform or explain
Free yourself from conventional forms of propaganda and understanding
And I'll scream at the top of my lungs
"Open your eyes, open your mind"
To the possibility of a better life
We are the employees of hypocrisy, in this corporatocracy
America we are no longer a sovereign nation
For the first time in my life I can see the beginning of the end of freedom, the end of happiness
For the first time in my life I have the strength to stand and say I will never let that happen
