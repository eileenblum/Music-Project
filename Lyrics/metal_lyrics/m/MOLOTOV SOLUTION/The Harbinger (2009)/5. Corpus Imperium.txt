Behind the throne of an empire sits an evil lord.
Abusing power at a cost we cannot afford
The world is governed by very different personages from what is imagined to those
Who aren't behind the scenes.
Business, especially corporate business, is king.
Giant corporations governed by faceless elite to dark proprietors controlling everything.
A shadow government that's owned by corporate greed.
Not a democracy or a free market economy, but an oppressive fascist corporatocracy
The machine fueled by blood, globalization.
Monopolize and corporatize without authorization
Open the gates to flood, the revelation.
Recognize and mobilize to exceed their expectation
Take revenge!
The world is governed by very different personages from what is imagined to those
Who aren't behind the scenes.
Business, especially corporate business, is king.
Giant corporations governed by faceless elite.
From one seat of power and corruption to the next, illustrating and intertwining connection of the globalists.
Behind the throne of an empire sits an evil lord
Abusing power at a cost we can't afford
This system is failing
This system is failing you
