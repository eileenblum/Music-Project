Arise and stand to fight with all your might
Arise and stand before they take your life
This is not a promise, this is a fucking threat
Witness the death of tomorrow as today comes to an end
The time for brute force has passed.
They're waging a war on the middle class
An economic war fueled and paid for by the money that comes out of our pockets
Scientifically created panics further consolidate the monopoly of banks
And control the state of the nation like a mathematical calculation
Looking to the past, there is a pattern, repetition of occurring events in order to break our spirits
And exploit the population's false sense of security
Warlords of today control a weapon that will make our nations sovereignty obsolete
A series of contrived panics, recessions, and buyouts, further consolidating the power into the hands of overlords and tyrants, used to condition us to the point of accepting the solution offered by the same people that produced the problem.

Undermining the structure of our home through inflation and deflation; paving the way for totalitarian control.
Those who strive for power will achieve it if we let them, but our numbers are stronger than ever before.
We have it within us to stop the dissolution and end this fucking war.

The time for brute force has passed
They're waging war on the middle class
This is not a promise, this is a fucking threat
This is not a promise, this is a fucking threat
This is not a promise, this is a fucking threat
If you don't take action it will be your death
