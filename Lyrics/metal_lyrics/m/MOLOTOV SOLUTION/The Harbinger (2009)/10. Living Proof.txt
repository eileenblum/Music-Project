We are being cornered, the danger will never fade, an unholy alliance of power to dominate and enslave the human race.
They're sponsored by the mandrake mechanism, which creates power out of thin air.

That's what you get when corporations would rather profit from our pain than help improve their nations.
Instead they use our suffering as means to get what they need, maintaining constant dependency so that their plans can proceed.

We are being watched, monitored every day, from what we buy to what we eat and think and fucking say.
So now they want us to carry a tracking card or "get chipped", well fuck that shit I say we show them that we're sick of this.

What's the price of a better life, free of corruption and dishonesty?

We the people deserve a fucking explanation for the life we're forced to endure!
We the people will not stand for this exploitation anymore!

WE THE PEOPLE!
DESERVE A FUCKING EXPLANATION!
WE THE PEOPLE!
WILL NOT BE EXPLOITED ANYMORE!

We are being bought, in the worst possible way, to strive for a corporate pushed lifestyle, one of which is portrayed in almost every form of entertainment so that we become what they want and think what they permit.

That's what you get when corporations would rather profit from our pain than help improve their nations.
Instead they use our suffering as a means to get what they need, maintaining constant dependency so that their plans can proceed.

Kill! [x4]
Our freedom and our only hope for tomorrow.
Kill! [x4]
All of us or watch your dreams fall dead because...

We Are Living Proof That Humanity Has a Right To Choose! [x2]
