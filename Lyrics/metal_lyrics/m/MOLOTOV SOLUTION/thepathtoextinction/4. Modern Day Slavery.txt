Forced to endure 12 years of subliminal mind conditioning,Emancipated only to be enslaved once again,This time sentenced 25 to life in a congested cubical,(Consumption will consume you)No need for bars because you're bound by your material possessions.Born into a prison.Luxuriance renders a false sense of achievement,Temporary happiness to one's miserable life of imprisonment.There's more to fucking life than this.But until we change our fucking ways, we'll be enslaved to the fucking grave.The revolution starts with the individual.Its not too late.
