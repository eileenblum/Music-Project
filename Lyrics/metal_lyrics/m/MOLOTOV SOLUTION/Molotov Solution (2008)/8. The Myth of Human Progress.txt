The first step to revolution is consciousness,
so I won't stop screaming at you until this all makes sense.
"Either you are with us or you're with the terrorsits",
say the president.
In that case I'm with the terrorists.

We're still labeling indigenous individuals terrorists?
Like the hostile Native Americans of the 1840s, no difference.

But your history books omitted that part about this place,
dashing infants heads on rocks,
millions of natives slaughtered and raped.

Instead we're fed romaticized versions of our history at an early age,
conditioning us into accepting the mass genocides of today.
Like the current one in Iraq and other U.S. attacks.

Meanwhile, millions of 'Support Our Troops' magnets are sold
but I don't see anyone crying out "Bring the home!"

Can't you see that giving up liberty does not bring security,
but instead only fucking tyranny?
Pick up a book and read about our fucking history and
you'll see that giving up liberty does not bring security,
but instead only fucking tyranny.

The very first step to revolution is consciousness
and I'll never stop screaming until this makes sense.
