Iris scanning. Microchipping. Wiretapping.
Cataloging information on innocent citizens lives...

In this panopticon society of slavery.
A culture of sheep with no concept of privacy.
Those who question the system are demonized because
why would you mind if you have nothing to hide?

If you have nothing to hide then why the fuck would you mind?
Why the fuck would you mind that they torch the Bill of Rights,
listen in on your conversations and trace everything that you buy,
and microchip your cars to track and tax you by the mile?

Wake me up from this Orwellian nightmare!
I'm screaming but no one around me seems to care as IBM invests
in RFID technology, the same corporation that cataloged
the Jews for the Nazis to be exterminated.
Now they're targeting you and me.

Iris scanning. Microchipping. Wiretapping.
Cataloging information on innocent citizens lives.

Prison planet. Can't you see where this is all headed?
To a high-tech police state control grid.

In this panopticon society of slavery,
a culture of sheep with no concept of privacy.

Prison planet.
