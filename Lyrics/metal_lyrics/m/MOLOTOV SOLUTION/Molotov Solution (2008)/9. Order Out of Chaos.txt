In need of an excuse to seize total control of Germany, The Nazis coordinated the false
flag burning of their our building. Followed by a staged attack against a radio station,
Hitler won the people's support for a German invasion into Poland.

Fast forward to a CIA coup in Iran when they overthrew Mohammed Mosadeq.
From machine gunning crowds to bombing houses with no regard for
innocent civilians as they stage terror attacks. A well-documented fact that
governments use false flags to further hiddin agendas.

does the Gulf of Tonkin ring a bell? The reason we fought a war in Viet Nam.
Well it turns out they never fired at us. Little damage resulted from this staged
provocation except the deaths of 58,000 Americans and
more than a million Viet Namese.
A war only good for political elites, just like every other war it seems.
While they sleep soundly at home our families die in wars designed to fail.

Because afterall, why rush to solve a conflict when prolonging it maximizes profit and expands the
amount of liberties people are willing to relinquish in exchange for security. A tactic as old as
empire, governments have use fear to control their populations.

Order out of chaos
Governments have always used fear to control their populations.

A seemingly endless history of U.S. sponsored terror and yet I'm call a
"conspiracy theorist" for asking questions and having no trust in our government.

I have no trust in any government.
