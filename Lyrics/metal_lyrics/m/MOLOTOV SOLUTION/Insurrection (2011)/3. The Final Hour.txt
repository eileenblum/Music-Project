People should not fear their Governments, Governments should fear their people.
This is the final hour, the last battle in a struggle for power.
We stand upon the front line. The clock strikes twelve, youâre out of time!
This is the final hour, the last battle in a struggle for power.
We stand upon the front line. The clock strikes twelve, youâre out of time!

We shall meet in a place where there is no darkness and we will fight in the light! We will fight!
You have been waiting in the shadows since the beginning of time. You have infiltrated every aspect of our meaningless lives.
We shall meet in a place where there is no darkness and we will fight in the light! we will fight! Like poison from the wound we will draw you from the shadow into the light!

Destitute of common knowledge and deprived of unchained life. This struggle ends tonight.
We have broken our bonds and abolished the chains that bind our guarded minds. This struggle ends tonight.
Defect from slavery and denounce your name. Become faceless and kill, kill without shame.
The truth will be revealed at the hands of a slave stained red with the blood of his master name.

The population is broken and dead, revolution an imminent threat.
In our eyes we see only red. Our darkest days lie ahead.

Run in fear! The end is near! Run in fear!

People should not fear their governments. Governments should fear the people.

This is the final hour. Run in fear!

This is the final hour. The end is near!
