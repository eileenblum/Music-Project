The stage is set, and so is the plan.
When the dark lord calls, you will understand.
Fall from grace was the ultimate sacrifice.
You will behold his greatness with your own eyes.
Weâll take your life into our hands.
Weâll take your lives with our own hands.
This blasphemy will be your end.
This will be your end!
Take me to the grove.
Itâs time to cremate care.
Red and white robes, worship upon the air:
The sacrifice of an innocent child, for the greater good of man.
The worship of a false idol under false pretenses: your faith will fail.
Forsaken we will be, despite hypocrisy, when the stars align at night, all the wrongs weâll right.
Set a fire in our skin, we have been freed of sin we will cast our cares to the wind.
All the wrongs weâll right.
The worship of a false idol under false pretenses: your faith has failed you.
Feel the hate when youâre burning at the steak, crucified for your crimes against humanity.
Feel the hate when youâre burning at the steak, crucified for your crimes against humanity.
Feel the hate and burn the book.
Feel the hate and burn the book.
Priests and politicians play the same sick fucking game.
Swine, serpents, and servants will be purged in the flame.
The stage is set, and so is the plan.
When the dark lord calls, you will understand.
Fall from grace was the ultimate sacrifice.
You will behold his greatness with your own eyes.
The worship of a false idol under false pretenses: your faith has failed you.
Forsaken we will be, despite hypocrisy, when the stars align at night, all the wrongs weâll right.
Set a fire in our skin, we have been freed of sin we will cast our cares to the wind.
All the wrongs weâll right.
Weâll take your life into our hands.
Weâll take your lives with our own hands.
This blasphemy will be your end.
This will be your end!
