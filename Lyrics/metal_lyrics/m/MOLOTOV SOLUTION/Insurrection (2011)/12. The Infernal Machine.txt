[Bonus Track]You canât stop the infernal machine.
It has no human feelings, just an end to meet.
Leaving nothing in its wake, carving a bloody path through our history.
Institutionalizing the over played concept of a healthier reality.
Incremental dissolution of individual humility.
Aesthetically perfect, or so you think, underneath the exterior evil awaits a horror both colossal and ornate.
A creature that destroys does not create.
What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object?
What happens when we enforce the very peace that we neglect?
Corruption breeds dissent amongst humanity.
Corruption breeds dissent amongst humanity.
You canât stop the infernal machine.
It has no human feelings, just an end to meet.
Leaving nothing in its wake.
Carving a bloody path through our history.
Institutionalizing the over played concept of a healthier reality.
Incremental dissolution of individual humility.
I have come to the realization, this new order and its creation, is a fucking reformation, of an abomination.
We are the victims of an unknown fate.
Realize the real lies and release your hate.

Sever the head of the authority.
Ensure the existence of the majority.
Terminate this ruthless tyranny.
Sever the head of the authority.
A never ending, worthless war in the world today is merely not coincidence.
Much to our dismay, turmoil is a part of their master plan; globalization is now within their hands.
Domination should be feared.
It is the force behind the puppeteer.
Construction of their plan is now complete.
A slow and silent death for you and me.

You canât stop the infernal machine.
It has no human feelings, just an end to meet.
Leaving nothing in its wake.
Carving a bloody path through our history.
Institutionalizing the over played concept of a healthier reality.
Incremental dissolution of individual humility.
Corruption breeds dissent amongst humanity.
Sever the head of the authority.
