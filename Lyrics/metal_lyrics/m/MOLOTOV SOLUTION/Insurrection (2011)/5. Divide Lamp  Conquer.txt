Segregation of the races.
Religious feuds and hatred.

Pitting brother against brother.
HATRED.
Turning friend to foe.

Where is your allegiance?
Where do you stand?
Blind submission threatens the survival of the free man...  and if you stand for nothing, I will still stand for you.

This is more than a call to arms!
This is a fucking revolution!

Our country is not the only thing to which we owe our allegiance. It is also owed to justice and to humanity. Patriotism consists not in waving the flag, but in striving that our country shall be righteous as well as strong.Â 
[- James Bryce]

Divide &amp; conquer.
Tolerance and apathy are the last virtues of a dying society.

Breed genocide of a feudal race.
This is a mass execution.

Tolerance and apathy are the last virtues of a dying society.
Where is your allegiance?
Where do you stand?
Blind submission threatens the survival of the free man...  and if you stand for nothing, I will still stand for you.

This is more than a call to arms!
This is a fucking revolution!

In the beginning of a change the patriot is a scarce man, and brave, and hated, and scorned. When his cause succeeds, the timid join him for then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[- Mark Twain]

Depreciation of self.
Corrosion of the classes.
Break the boundaries that bring confusion to the masses.
Opposition stirred the goal to inflict a mortal wound in the fragile heart of man.
Irreparable and internal, it will destroy us from within.

Divide &amp; conquer.
Divide &amp; conquer.
