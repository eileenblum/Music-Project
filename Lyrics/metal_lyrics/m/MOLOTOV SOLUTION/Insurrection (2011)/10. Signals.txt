When the lines blur and the colors fade, give ear to the earth shaking serenade.

You can feel your fragile brain decay, an unjust sentence to all who would disobey.

This is a fucking dissolution of a false day.
We are all that is left of a lesser race.
Just like a rampant plague, your power weâll decay, and bring forth the end of your ascendancy.
If you arenât a part of the solution, then youâre a part of the problem.
Your sheltered seclusion, helpless, force fed pollution.
Your strength will falter.
America the beautiful, America the brave, an illusion, a prison, a nation betrayed.
The skies will tremble and the earth will shake, foundations will crumble when the HAARP is played.

This is a fucking dissolution of a false day.
We are all that is left of a lesser race.
And like a rampant plague, weâll bring forth the end of your ascendancy.

The New World Order has a plan to keep you and I sheltered and afraid.
As the populous struggles to stand, with our nationâs wealth decayed.
Their instruments break our bodies and pollute our minds with fabricated truth to perpetuate a lie that enables their rule, a solution at the hands of the cruel.

Diminishing our power to fight back against a darkness itâs the strength we lack, but we will always be more than they understand.
Though they are doing everything they can.
To hold us back.
You wonât hold us back.
We wonât let you take control.
When the lines blur and the colors fade, give ear to the earth shaking serenade.

You can feel your fucking brain decay, an unjust sentence to all who would disobey.
An imperfect world, seen through the disguise, destined to for perfection, but not for our eyes.

The New World Order has a plan to keep you and I sheltered and afraid.
As the populous struggles to stand, with our nationâs wealth decayed.
Their instruments break our bodies and pollute our minds with fabricated truth to perpetuate a lie that enables their rule, a solution at the hands of the cruel.
