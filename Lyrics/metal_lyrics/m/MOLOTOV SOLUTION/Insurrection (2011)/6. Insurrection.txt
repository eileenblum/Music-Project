It has been ten years since the descent began, the most recent chapter, 100 years into their master plan.
It has been ten years since the towers fell, in a free fall economy, integrated into a man-made hell.
Congruency cannot be questioned.
A closer look depicts codes of deception.
All our freedoms are stripped away.
This fascist regime has risen from the fucking grave.
Weâre not the only ones that see behind closed doors, you canât hide anymore.
Weâre not the soul-less ones who brought upon this war, you canât hide anymore.
It has been our fear, since they conceived their plan, that allowed them to become our masters, what is it that you donât understand?
It has been our fear since the election, taking the power from the people, reminiscent to a planned insurrection.
The difference between us and you is that youâre killing innocents and weâre killing you.
Weâll bring you to justice, just like the governments you are toppling you will fall, you will follow them to the ground.
We will watch you fall.
Itâs time for a new page to be written, not in ink or concrete, but with your blood.
A new age will begin with your end.

Weâre not the only ones that see behind closed doors, you canât hide anymore.
Weâre not the soul-less ones who brought upon this war, you canât hide anymore.
We wonât change for this world; weâll change this world for us.
We wonât change for this world; weâll change this world for us.
Fuck your world.
You can have it.
Fuck your world.
You can have it.
The difference between us and you is that youâre killing innocents and weâre killing you.
Weâll bring you to justice and just like the governments you are toppling you will fall, you will follow them to the ground.
We will watch you fall.
