New World Nightmare
This is not the dream that you had once believed.
They have forced their hand and taken everything.
For what is a dream, but a fictitious reality?
A global nightmare fraying at the seams.
We spend our lives living off the benefits of their crimes and lies.
Permanent sleep blinds our eyes, and leaves our people paralyzed.
Your eyes are open, but youâre not awake.

We lie unbroken in their wake.
We stand for truth, The American Dream.
They destroy truth, thatâs The American Way.

We stand for everything that you want to believe.
Perpetual darkness and suffering you canât conceive.
Sickened by the thought of reality, in this nightmare youâll find your mortality.
We do not fear you, we are not afraid.
Weâd rather die fighting you than living as your slave.
Rise!
We do not fear you, we are not afraid.
The futureâs controlled by you, not lying in our grave.

Rise!
From this nightmare, we must awaken.
Take back our lives that they have taken.
Rise!
We must awaken.
Take back our lives that they have taken.
Rise!
We must awaken.
Take back our lives that they have taken.
Can you sleep at night?
Do you pray in fear by your bedside?
No longer will we crumble under your weight; itâs time to pay for your mistakes.
Can you sleep at night?
Do you pray in fear by your bedside?
No longer will we crumble under your weight; itâs time to pay for your mistakes.
We have set ourselves free.
We will create our own dream.
We have set ourselves free.
We will create a living dream.
