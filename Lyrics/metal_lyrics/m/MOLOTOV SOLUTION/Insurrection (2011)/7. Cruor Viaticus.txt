You deal in fear, selling security in a box.
Lives disappear, selling our souls at a premium cost.
Insatiable hunger for gold and lust for power.
Youâre fucking scum.
Your riches will stand for nothing in the 11th hour.
Youâre fucking done.

Wealth over commonwealth: of, by, and for the corporations and not the people.
Wealth against commonwealth: a battle for the preservation of good, not evil.
We wonât be bought and sold.
Your debt to the human race is long overdue.
We have come to collect; this is it youâre through.
Wealth over commonwealth: of, by, and for the corporations and not the people.
Wealth against commonwealth: a battle for the preservation of good not evil.
We wonât be bought and sold.
You want my life then come and get it.
We wonât be bought and sold.
You want my life then come and get it.
A drop of blood for every innocent man that has suffered at your hands.
Youâll never fucking bleed us dry
Spreading your lies x youâll never fucking bleed us dry
No more lives lost at your hands.
When will the cost meet your demands?
No more innocent souls condemned.
How many more will you expend?
My words heed, consumed by your greed.
You will see, tyrants can still bleed.
You deal in fear, selling security in a box.
Lives disappear, selling our souls at a premium cost.
Bloodshed.
Senseless.
Bloodshed.
My words heed, consumed by your greed.
You will see, tyrants can still bleed.
Today will live in infamy; the story of your death will forever be burned into the pages of history.
Your rotting corpse will be put on display for all abandoned eyes to see,
It shall serve as a warning to all who would follow you for the rest of eternity.
Today will live in infamy; the story of your death will forever be burned into the pages of history.
