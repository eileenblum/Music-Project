I thought you would've came.
I thought you would've cared.
Seems like a deja vu.
When you'd stand me up or two.

Behelded to your name,
and nothing but a shame.
I'm nothing.
I'm hopeless.
Behelded to your name,
and nothing but a shame.
I'm nothing.
I'm hopeless.

Look into my eyes,
tell me I'm a waste.
Prove to me that 18 years,
of hell would give me grace.
Look into my wrists,
dare to give me bliss.
I don't want your pity,
so just get the fuck away from me.
