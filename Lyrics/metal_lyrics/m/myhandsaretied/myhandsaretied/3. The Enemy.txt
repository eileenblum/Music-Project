Here's a story bout an little soul,
who though she was it all.
You left me fucking crying dear,
and you took it fucking all.

Die, please,
leave me.
You are the enemy.
Die, please,
leave me.
You are the enemy.

Brick by brick, stone by stone,
they all fell down on me.
But you, made, sure, that,
you made it for your greed.

You cried rape when you needed to,
but you left when I needed you.
I'm torn apart, from the inside out,
and only wealth is on your mind.
You cried rape when you needed to,
but you left when I needed you.
I'm torn apart, from the inside out,
and only wealth is on your mind.

You are the enemy.
You are the enemy.

I am your
victim,
of mental abuse.
This is who I am.
I abhor you.

Die, please,
leave me.
You are the enemy.
Die, please,
leave me.
You are the enemy.

Brick by brick, stone by stone,
they all fell down on me.
But you, made, sure, that,
you made it for your greed.

You cried rape when you needed to,
but you left when I needed you.
I'm torn apart, from the inside out,
and only wealth is on your mind.
You cried rape when you needed to,
but you left when I needed you.
I'm torn apart, from the inside out,
and only wealth is on your mind.

You are the enemy.
You are the enemy.
I thought I needed you.
