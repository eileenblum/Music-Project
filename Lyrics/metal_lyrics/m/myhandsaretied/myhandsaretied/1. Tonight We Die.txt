Systems of a modern world.
Overcome by the mainstream trap.
Integrity pushed aside like a dust ball.
And the rest of the lives we knew.

This is a system that we'll never shake.
This is a war that we will never win.
This is a system that we'll never shake.
This is a war that we will never win.

We are dead on the inside,
living a lie that we know.
Expressive thoughts underground,
societies norm are crowned.

Tonight we die,
free from all the cries.
Tonight we lose,
what we thought we knew.
Tonight we go,
to the ends of the world.
Tonight we give,
the rest of our bliss.

I always thought the world was better,
I gave it all its credit.

I was wrong.

I thought,
we'd over come this.
But I was wrong.

Systems of a modern world.
Overcome by the mainstream trap.
Integrity pushed aside like a dust ball.
And the rest of the lives we knew.

This is a system that we'll never shake.
This is a war that we will never win.
This is a system that we'll never shake.
This is a war that we will never win.

We are dead on the inside,
living a lie that we know.
Expressive thoughts underground,
societies norm are crowned.

Tonight we die,
free from all the cries.
Tonight we lose,
what we thought we knew.
Tonight we go,
to the ends of the world.
Tonight we give,
the rest of our bliss.
