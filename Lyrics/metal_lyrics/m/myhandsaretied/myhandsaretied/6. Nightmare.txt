Seems like another messy ending
where your head wins, and its not fair.
I try my hardest to be there
but I will always fail.

It's like a broken record,
depression has its anchor.
panic will fill that void of
hell and you will always lose.

And I'll pray for the ending to come.
And I'll sit by your side even though
that we lose everyday,
we lose anyway.
Sadness has broken
my insides, every time.

This is my life,
this is my fucking life.
It's not your fault or mine
But can this never die

Blegh.
