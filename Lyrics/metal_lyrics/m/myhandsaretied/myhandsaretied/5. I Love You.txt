I love you, but your poison to me.
I love you, but you pushed it on me.
I love you, but my soul took control.
I hate you, that's why you're dead on my bed.

My feelings dead to you,
you never cared, you.
I ripped your smile off your face,
and I had pleasure too.

What will I do,
what will I do,
when they find you?
Cause in the end,
oh in the end,
I will confess to,

Killing you,
killing you.
You fucked me up through,
thoughts and dead things,
I compared you too.

Expressing life throughout my head,
was impossible.
I wanted you to live my life, though my nightmare.
