This is a battle that's endless,
like clouds will never fail.
Because the world is a ruthless bitch,
and the anxiety will never quit.

Be my confrontation,
be my resignation.
Be my designation,
by my extermination.

Endless depression.
Endless depression,
will call my name.

Be the one who caused.
Be the one that cursed.
Oh will I ever learn my fucking lesson.
Bleeding has done nothing but make things worse.

Blegh.

Be the one who caused.
Be the one that cursed.

This is a battle that's endless,
like clouds will never fail.
Because the world is a ruthless bitch,
and the anxiety will never quit.

Be my confrontation,
be my resignation.
Be my designation,
by my extermination.

Endless depression.
Endless depression,
will call my name.
Endless depression.
Endless depression,
will call my name.
