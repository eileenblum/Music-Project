It's in her eyes again
Frail but yet relentless
Convinced once more to fall on my knees
And I yearn for more
As I allow myself to be a part of the game
Restrained, relieved, and self-deceived

It's in her eyes again
Frail but yet relentless to the core
Convinced once more to fall on my knees
And I yearn for more
As I allow myself to be a part of the game
Restrained, relieved, and self-deceived

And the play goes on and on and on

Decide my pain, make me obey your every word
Decide my pain and let me stay
Make me whole again

Can't find a way out
And stop defrauding myself once more
Convinced to stay again
Restrained, abused, constrained, subdued

Decide my pain, make me obey your every word
Decide my pain and let me stay
Make me whole again
