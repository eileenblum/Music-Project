Another sleepless night
Shadows form and haunt my mind
I gasp for breath
I feel so cold, leave me alone

My inferior life is torn
Torn into pieces
The path that I've chosen
The man that I swore not to be
Is what I see in my own reflection
The trail that I follow diluted by pain once again

Cold

A frantic state of mind
Numbs my guilt and feeds my anger
It fills the void and emptiness

Cold
