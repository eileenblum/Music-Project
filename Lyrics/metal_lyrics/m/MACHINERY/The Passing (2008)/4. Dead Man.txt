Nothing's different since yesterday
Still not a man but property
The liberated call me devil's creation
A disgrace in the eye of god

They make me plead for mercy then whip me again
They lure me with false pretensions 'til I'm driven mad
Just when it feels right they tighten the noose
And pull me back in

[Chorus:]
I'm slave to another man
Slave in the promised land
Out of reach for a helping hand
Chained to the ground

I can't shake it off it's now a part of me
It's in my system and runs through my veins
I take a step forward and fall two steps back
I've lost my identity

Unaccepted I walk through this land
Degraded until I'm too afraid
In the end hanging in a rope
Condemned by faithful hand

[Chorus]

Slave to another man
Slave in the promised land
Out of reach for a helping hand
Chained for a greater cause

Once a man now utterly destroyed
Dragged down the road and now accepts his fate
Out of reach for a helping hand
Chained for a greater cause
Though he knows there will be another time
A time to repay for man what he has done
