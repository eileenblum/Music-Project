A streaming sense forms a downward spiral
Receding flood gives birth to another tide
A new ambition to mend our guilt and shame
While we step forward and sleepwalk back again

Reformed, defined, confided, aligned

A truth deceiving
The conflict within
Reveals the meaning
When finding closure

Fulfilment by need defines our own bloodline
Repetition be the nature of man
Raised to follow our fathers trail
And wind up on the very same road
