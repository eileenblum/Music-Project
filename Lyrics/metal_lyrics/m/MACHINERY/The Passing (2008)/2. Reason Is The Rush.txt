Disturbed - in pursuit for the ultimate high
Need to breathe, need to sleep, need to clear my mind

Restless - my body aches for more
Too many times I've changed my mind
Too many times I act without pride

Restless, disturbed
In pursuit for the ultimate high
Need to breathe, need to sleep, need to clear my mind

Reason, rush, reason is rush
Reason, rush, reason is the rush

Insane - the blood boils in me
A bottomless urge to feed
Denial - only one more time
Don't tell me no, don't ask me why

Restless, disturbed
In pursuit for the ultimate high
Need to breathe, need to sleep, need to clear my mind

They think they know it all
Soon they'll realise they're wrong
Yet they don't know that I'm god
Soon I'll have it all

Reason is the rush
