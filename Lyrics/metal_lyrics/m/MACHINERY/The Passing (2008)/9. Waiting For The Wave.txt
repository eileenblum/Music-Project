I'm bleeding
All of me bleeding
Let me run, let me fade away

Can't hide behind the curtain
Don't fit in within the frame
And I plunge deeper and deeper
From solid ground the tide sweeps me away

I've tried so hard to make it all better
To please and make everything seem right

I keep telling myself to breathe again
To go on and live through another day
But it takes me down, I gasp for air
It chokes inside me, wants me dead
The pounding aches harder and harder
Deeper and deeper I fall

Another ray reaches to an end
Battered, beaten, deluded, degraded
I've tried to scrub it off, I've tried to wash it off
But it stays
Remains inside of me

I keep telling myself to breathe again
To go on and live through another day
But it takes me down, I gasp for air
It chokes inside me, wants me dead
The pounding aches harder and harder
Deeper and deeper I fall

I've tried to scrub it off, I've tried to wash it off
But it stays
Remains inside of me
