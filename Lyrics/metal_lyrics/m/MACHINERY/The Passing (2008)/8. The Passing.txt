It's a part of me
It's a part of you
A collective need
To restore our dreams

And I watch you all
When you lose control
Sensing light beyond
Revelations gone

Come, come grovel, crawl in front of me
Come my children, your souls belong to me

With a sigh I pass
To the other side
Forever sleep
In the withering void

And we take the fall
Neglect our call
Our purpose told
To friend and foe
Our fate unfolds
What our dreams uphold
We create a god
For the sake of all

Slave
