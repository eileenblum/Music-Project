Now arrived at the dusk of my aeonic existence
But yet, too short
My hands are bound in my back with a thorny rope
And yet, so tight

Raising my prophetic gaze one last time
The only things I meet are blight
And contempt, vomited by all those mouths
United by the dogmatic boundaries of so-called human decency

Unanimously condemned by a mislead humanity
And yet, too quickly
For daring to bother the established with cosmic words
And yet, so true

Thus destined to such vile death
A revengeful spectacle for the shocked memory
I look at the fire burning higher and higher around me
Already suffocated by the smoke's hypnotic breath

I suddenly feel a freezing warmth
Like boiling acid rolling on my body
From my feet to my chest
The flames are devouring me

Vile mass exalting christlike fantasies
I will not wash your sins
For of all the scourges your sick mind creates, my body i s free
As it has ever been and will always be

The pseudo heroic act of self-castration
Reanimated their old morbid satisfaction
Again, repeating time and abandon
They missed their target and reached perversion.
Deafened by the morbid pulse
Roaring in their ears and spreading its curse
All their mouths were sinisterly open
For their blaming how to straighten

No sacrifice hidden behind this murder
You deserve nothing but a contemptuous laughter
Your cause is senseless, so is my agony
Staining your hands forever with blood of perfidy

Forget all your neurotic constructions
And face the source of your dissatisfaction
One last time
One last time...
Or have all my attempts always been vain
Disregarded, lost under disdain?
Could all my scars and wasted blood
Only be remembered by the silent mud?
Sucked away from each infected memory
Vanishing under each gaze, inexorably?

During this everlasting agony
A smile distorted my cracked lips
One last time
For even though my time had gone
Somewhere a seed had been sown

One last time my thoughts wandered free
Beholding future hatching potentialities

I hate you world
I wasn't made for you...

Alas...
