Lying under a melting moon
I bemoan the truth I shall never know
For I'm pulled by the winds of Eternity
In a chasm where no sparkle of light dances

Infinite thoughts dyed with madness
Like celestial gazes through a maze of Nothingness
Thus wanders my dreamful soul
Like an absurd shadow fleeing the sun

Against all nature, against the tide
Again and again I try
To escape that blindfold iron era
In order to reach the stars, carriers of wisdom

So let my eyes close
And my mind travel
Beyond the illusory beauty
Beyond the silent and motionless rivers of pain

Over the frozen waterfalls we shall rise hand in hand
And top the corpse of the moon eyeing us scornfully down
 From her mirrorthrone in the nightsky
Whence she spells her curse on our yet blackened hearts

No smiles shall enlighten our faces sculpted in marble
For lost is our cause
But through astral travels we shall find another reality
The true essence of LifeÂ and Death
