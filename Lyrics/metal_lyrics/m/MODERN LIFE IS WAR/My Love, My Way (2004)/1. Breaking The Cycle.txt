This marks the return of a threat that we should have never taken
back: To live our lives with unwavering intent and in the spirit of a
new romance. Growing up in an age where monotony reigns...it's so easy
to keep your heart and mind locked away. And it's up to you to rise
up...to break away. We've got no more time to spend spitting ugly
words at our vicious circles from within. The time has come to adapt
and reinvent. Let yourself go. Come unhinged. Claws out...stuck in a
place where you don't fit. Focus or Fold....no more sitting on the
fence. Today is the day we face ourselves and forgive, because the
world won't wait while we fail to make amends. Late Night Adventure.
Reckless Abandonment. We're going to live our lives like it's our last
chance. Revenge: We're taking back what they stole. Prepare your soul!
