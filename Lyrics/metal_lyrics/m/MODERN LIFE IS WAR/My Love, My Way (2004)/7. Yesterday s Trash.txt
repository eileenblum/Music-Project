Another new beginning: down the fucking drain. Screaming "never again"
as we watch it wash away. God Damn. Disappointment sure does have a
way of adding up. But it's all a matter of perspective so we'd better
start looking up. Don't give up...cause someone said these are our
glory days. So let's do our best to beat the misery that comes with
being young and fucked up. Time to rise up. Before yesterday's trash
becomes tomorrow's hard luck.
