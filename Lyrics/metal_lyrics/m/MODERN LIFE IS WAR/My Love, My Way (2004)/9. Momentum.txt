Down the old staircase...I'm walking out the door. I feel lost here
tonight, everything has changed since that summer before. Stumbling
forward...I'm glancing back. There's no one in the window begging me
to come back. The streetlights are burning. But I'm not yet ready for
this day to be done. Cause I always come up short. I'm always lusting
for something more. And so I push right into the night harder and
harder until my heart beats just right. Across downtown and over the
tracks. Exhaustion finally taking hold...down to the place I love
where nobody knows. Old photographs much too late at night. I Dream of
times I wish I could leave behind. And I always Wake up ugly and
dissatisfied. I've gotta change my mind. I've gotta change my life:get
down to the root of the problem:cure my misdirection:cause all the
laughs die at closing time and I lie awake wondering why I'm an all or
nothing kid and why I've been feeling like nothing all of the time.
Where do I go? Am I on my own?
