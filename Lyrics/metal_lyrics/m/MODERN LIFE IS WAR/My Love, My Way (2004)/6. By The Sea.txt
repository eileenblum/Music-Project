We were young, numb, and violent all at once. We were always smashing
glass but it was never enough to make us feel OK. Are we normal boys?
Is this the normal way? We've been dragging dead weight across Midwest
towns. Killing our times with our frowns. Alone in the crowd four
years down feeling torn and beaten down. Alone in the crowd four years
down, our hearts were beating to this sound. Me and you: we never got
much sleep those nights. There was too much turmoil too deep inside.
Lost in the dark without our pride...there was a light at the end of
that tunnel, but we chose to shield our eyes. Could It be? Are we
seeing clearly for the very first time? We've been to the edge and we
know what it's like to want to die...and that's something we won't
glorify. We'll leave those miserable times behind. How far can I go?
I'm rising from the depths of my own hell. I don't need another tragic
tale. I need the strength to walk the other way. I found conviction in
my ever changing mind. I grew up tied down and bleeding on the inside,
but I know I was a victim of my own device, and I want to live to see
a brand new life.
