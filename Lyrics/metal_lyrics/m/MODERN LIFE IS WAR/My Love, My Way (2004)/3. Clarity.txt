Force fed from the outside. We live a crowded life it seems. Fragile
minds in a fast paced world. Can't compute the images coming through
the screens. Can't seem to bridge the gap between AM reality and late
night schemes. Can't seem to focus as the glitter fades to green.
We've lost control. Stained glass from the outside. We suffer from a
lack of clarity. Impatience in the information age has taken it's toll
on me. Sharp minds dulled down to nothing and filled with fantasy.
Exhausted Options: set me free. Walking Backwards. Shedding Skin. I
try to block it out. They keep trying to get in. We've lost control.
Confusion and Identity Crisis deep in the heart of my America. Another
generation has been bought and sold. We've lost control.
