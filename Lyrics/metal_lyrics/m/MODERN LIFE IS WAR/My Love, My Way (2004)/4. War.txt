Between the world and me: pressure-splitting seams. Imminent danger in
the headlines. Glamour on the T.V. Chasing fools gold. Growing cold.
Drowning in anxiety. Lack of reason: pushing symbols and clever
phrasing. False notions of ritual, credentials, comfort, safety.
Relentless and crowding. It's hard to breathe. They'll give you the
disease, then they'll sell you the cure to set you free.
