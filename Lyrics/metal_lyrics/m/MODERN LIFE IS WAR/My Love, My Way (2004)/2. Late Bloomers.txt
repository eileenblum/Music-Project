How did it feel to fail? How did it feel to feel? All of those times,
we tried our very hardest, and our best was never good enough for
them. Well, those days have come to and end, my friends. We no longer
answer to anyone and this new life is ours to live. The end. This is
the end of the way we used to live. The end. The end. This is the
death of the days that we were better off dead. No more second
guessing. No more fucking patience. No more self-doubt. No more
inhibitions. Adapt. Outlast. Adapt. Outlast. At Last. The end.
