Is it wrong to want to walk away when every day of your life looks
like today and today looks like a rotting lifeless gray? I don't know
where things went wrong with me...but I feel like I've become a timid
shadow of the person I've always wanted to be. And I've been thinking
about my past today...thinking of all those times I was afraid...and
all those times that I felt worthless and ashamed. I know, I thought I
was strong. I said I would never change...but that burning house left
me an empty frame...and no longer can I decay...no longer can I keep
my heart locked away. Have you ever felt like you are wasting your
whole life searching for something you can't find? There's been so
much talk of so many slashed up wrists...but we're much too young to
be dwelling on thoughts like this. So scrape your heart up from the
bottom of the bottom of the barrel. Keep your faith in the path that's
growing narrow. Kill the doubt inside your head. We overcome. We push
ahead.
