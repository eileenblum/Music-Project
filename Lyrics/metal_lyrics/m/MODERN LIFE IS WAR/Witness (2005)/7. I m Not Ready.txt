In this life there are no clean breaks...
But starting again is a chance that you can take.
I always thought that someday we would overcome the bad luck
And from the burden the gift would come.
Maybe I should have known better.

But I know we're coming closer to the end of whatever this has been.
When you're 16 you don't know what forever means.
When you are 23 you couldn't be more sorry to say.
That after all this growing up together all the good has gone away.
Sometimes the boys that should be yours best friends become strangers with familiar faces.
Just don't tell me that it's all too far gone...
That they weren't meant to live on...
And don't let go.
I just don't want to have to pretend...
If we're not in this together...
If we're just stuck inside our own heads.
And I'm sorry that it took me so long to find the words to write the song
That we can all still truly believe in
But I truly believe that we can still start again.
