I'm in an awful state.
It's getting late and I'm full of question.
My overactive mind has been wastin' all my time.
So I've been wandering aimless every night and sleeping every day.
But it really doesn't matter anyways
'Cause the second coming has been cancelled since sometime around
1982 when Jesus looked down from his cloud and saw school kids...
They were duck and covering.
There's nothing gonna happen out there.
So let's stay in.
Just come on over and let me in.
Outside my windows the sun could be shining but in my head it's all rain, rain and sirens.
We'll have our own Hollywood scandal show.
You wire me up.
I'll be ready to go.
I'll do anything.
I'll assassinate all the stars of all of your bad dreams.
I'll be all yours just as long as you stay here with me
'Cause I don't wanna be alone when these walls start closing in.
