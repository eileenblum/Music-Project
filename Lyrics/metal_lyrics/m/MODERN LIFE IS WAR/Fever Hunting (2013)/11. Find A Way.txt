I believe I am here to create.
Armed with love &amp; knowledge I will find a way.
If you believe you are here to create.
Seek love &amp; knowledge and you will find a way.
If we believe we are here to create.
Armed with love &amp; knowledge we will find a way.

And I know there are those that would like
to see me fail. I wish you health.
I wish you wealth. I wish you could
understand that there is nothing that
you could do to me that's worse than
what I've already done to myself.

The Old Fears are Still Here. Still
New Frontiers are Still Waiting.
If the Fear cripples You and
You lose your chance to try.
You'll have to live with your own
Wasted Life.

I believe I am here to create.
Armed with love &amp; knowledge I will find a way.
If you believe you are here to create.
Seek love &amp; knowledge and you will find a way.
If we believe we are here to create.
Armed with love &amp; kinowledge we will find a way.
