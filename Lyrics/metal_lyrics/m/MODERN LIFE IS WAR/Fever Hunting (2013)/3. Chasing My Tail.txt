Steal my heart in the summer. Thoughts &amp; visions from
another time cloud my mind. Thinking I was not meant
to live this long. Thanking an absentee god that I
did not take that accidental fatal fall. Distractions
as lifeblood. Stranded drunk on a humid night.
Pushing ply. Burning sky. Making peace with vice,
constantly increasing the pressure in my life.
Aim &amp; Ambition. You've come at age. The money must be
made, the bills must be paid. I live hand to mouth
&amp; simplify. The things I can't afford to lose
have multiplied. Friends have scattered.
I miss them all so much. I'll see you at weddings
&amp; funerals. We'll catch up &amp; we'll wish each other
well. Only time will tell. I wish you well.

Scrape &amp; crawl to gain position
Chasing my tail in the land of competition.

Scrape,
Crawl,
Scrape,
Crawl,
Scrape,
Crawl,
Scrape,

Scrape,
