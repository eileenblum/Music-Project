Balance is bittersweet when all you know is madness.
Count my blessings. Poke out my eyes.
Privilege magnified &amp; shoved in my face
when I walk through the tunnels where
the invalids lay.

I'm wading in dark water when I should be in bed.
With a head full of magic &amp; a heart full of dread.
My labors of toil. My labors of love.
Streetlight pale. Goddamn the sun.

We're all dangerously close to the bottom.
Anguish &amp; Joy could be slammed shut.
In the wink of an eye.. In the inky night.
I'm a nightcrawler &amp; I don't know why.

Balance is bittersweet when all you know is madness.
Count my blessings - Claw out my eyes.
There's no rain to wash the piss stench away
when I walk through the tunnels where the invalids lay.

I'm wading in dark water when I should be in bed.
With a head full of magic &amp; a heart full of dread.
My labors of toil. My labors of lust.
Streetlight pale. Goddamn the sun.

We're all dangerously close to the bottom.
Anguish &amp; Joy could be slammed shut.
In the wink of an eye.. In the inky night.
I'm a nightcrawler &amp; I don't know why.
