Is this bitter disdain or just yearning?
Am I standing still or am I slowly turning?
Welcome me back and make the embrace warm.
Cause I'm still screamin' at the same walls
I was screamin' at five years before.
Fight invisible enemies. Warriors without a war.
Our condition remains unchanged until there is
something worth dying for.. If you don't understand,
I understand. It's ok. If you don't understand,
I understand if you just walk away. Money blown.
Opportunities thrown out the windows of rented
rooms. Nothing humbles the anger of youth like
a few more years of truth. I'm just as guilty
as anybody else. I know what's right, can't
put desires on the shelf. I've got a list,
if you've got one you know, you never reach
the end... It just grows and grows.

The wise are panicked.
The blind are breeding.
Sing the kings &amp; queens
of broken dreaming.
The sadness lingers.
The bliss is fleeting.
Sing the king &amp; queens
of broken dreaming.
