I am rising with the concrete tide. Bumps'n'cracks
shake loose the cobwebs in my mind.
Bail or smash. For old mistakes I won't do time.
Sincerely sorry if I was a fool. If I acted
arrogant or cruel. My vessel moves forward so
must my soul. Shouting matches with father
time about my former sins. Burning
in my thighs, salty sweaty eyes, get
me where I'm going. I'm starting to feel
young again. Don't get. Don't get. Don't get.
Don't get lazy. You'll get. You'll get. You'll get.
Stuck again. My vessel moves forward so
must my soul. No time to go crazy so I
must roll... before this shell goes
arthritic &amp; rusts. Yes, I still know your
expectations. No, I still don't give a fuck.
Momentum must be maintained. So don't get
lazy You'll get stuck again. Rising with
the concrete tide. Bumps'n'cracks shake
loose the cobwebs in my mind. Bail or smash,
for old mistakes I won't do time. Sincerely
sorry if I was a fool if I acted arrogant
or cruel. My vessel moves forward so must
my soul. No time to go crazy so I must
roll.
