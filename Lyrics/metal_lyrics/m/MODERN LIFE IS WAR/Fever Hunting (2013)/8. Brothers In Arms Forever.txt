Some days I pray for collapse. Pray for my comforts to be snatched
From my soft hands. For the rug to be pulled from beneath
my soft feet. Maybe then finally, a true piece of mind
could be mine. Until then I need you now more than ever.
Permanent changes falling down like the weather.
Unconditional love, I need someone I can trust.
Even if all that's been broken can't be pieced back together,
after all you said you would be my brother in arms forever.

When I saw you after you got sick I got choked up.
Perfect injustice. Tongue tied staring into your babies eyes.
Unconditional love, I want to be someone you can trust.
Even if all that's broken can't be pieced back together.
After all I said I would be your brother in arms forever.

Somethings you've lost you can't get back.
Too many years spent on the wrong track, like a lonesome train.
But don't count us out just because our plans fell through our
fingers like grains of sand. We need each other now
more than ever. Permanent changes are falling down like
the weather. Unconditional love. We need someone we
can trust. Even if all that's broken can't be pieced back
together. After all we said we'd be brothers in arms
forever.

We always said we'd be brothers in arms forever.
Now you're sick - we're still brothers in arms forever.
All things have changed but we're brothers in arms forever.
In a violent world we're still brothers in arms forever.
Through thick and thin we're still brothers in arms forever.
Distance &amp; time we're still brothers in arms forever.
We always said we'd be brothers in arms forever.
Don't let me go we're still brothers in arms forever.
