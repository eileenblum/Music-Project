You know you have been deeper than this.
You know you have been begging for this.
For the rats to wake you from peaceful sleep.
For enslaved instincts to roam free.
Tonight your heart is fearful of a cruel twist.
Tonight on your knees begging for abyss.
No one has your number since you disappeared last November.
Lights flooding in into the cracks of your shack.
The rats will wake you from peaceful sleep.
Enslaved instincts roaming free.
Light is flooding in through the cracks and you rush to seal cold.
Steal someone's dream to satisfy your own, unfulfilled.
Dear foreign city 3 AM, keep her safe.
I have lost my way again.
If I sleep I will dream of shimmering smashed broken glass threaded into fresh blacktop, and sprinkled onto cracked concrete.
If I should wake up choking on brake dust, give me water, give me relief.
If I sleep I will dream of women, and money. Of freedom and honey.
And wake up in this city a slave to my desires. A slave to my design.
Unable to resist peeling back the drain.
Removing this respectable stitch.
So cold.
No one can stop this.
Unable to resist.
Embracing the cruel twist.
Drowning in this abyss.
