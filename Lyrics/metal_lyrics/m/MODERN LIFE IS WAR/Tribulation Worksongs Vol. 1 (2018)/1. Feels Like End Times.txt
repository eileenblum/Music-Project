I have been blissed.
I have been kissed by fate.
I have been made mad right where I stand.
See me I am drenched in the echoes of war.
With no future to sacrifice.
I declare my time is mine.
I am standing at the root of my truth, in the crossfire of love with no time to compromise.
Feels like end times.
Some will submit, some will be taken by force.
Cowards and weak hearts: time is tracking you down.
Find another working class apologist. I'm not your shill.
God wrath on rich hypocrites. A prophecy fulfilled. No time to compromise.
Feels like end times.
Clairvoyant fatal vision prophecy fulfilled. Walls scrawled with blood.
I've got trouble in my mind.
Another sunrise, another morning to thrive, another victim.
Another crime, another narrow escape from death on the vine.
I have been blissed.
I have been kissed by fate.
