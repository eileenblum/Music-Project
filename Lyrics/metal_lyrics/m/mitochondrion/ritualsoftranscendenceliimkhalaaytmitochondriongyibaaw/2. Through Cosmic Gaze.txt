Overwhelming foreboding - A glimpse into eyes of potential
Ancient immutable master - Harkening at the ocean's command
The deafening roar of silence, come, wash over desires
Impotent sense reawaken, once in contempt of the call
Essence drawn upward on gusts of released whispers
Imparative forces acknowledge all thoughts upon thee
Deep majestic void ascend forth
Enhanced with fires eternal
Natures forbidden knowledge
Discover in darkeness, roll hidden aeons

From the banished realms of the psyche
The gnostic messenger issues forth
Wherefore transcends this ethereal majesty?

Fixating the unwavering gaze 
Deeper still into oblivion
The boundary of the intrinsic value flickers in seclusion
Ecstasy and fear reach paramount, clash in dual absolution

Waters! Cleanse the progenous pathway
Waters! Carry the flames on waves of will
Tempest! Stir the ancient slumber
Tempest! Sunder this realm into chaos
Summoned guardians uncover the secrets long darkened
With weapon and crest dull the blade of prevention
Elements and symbols cast out all doubt and consciousness
For subconscious will must guide the left hand's path

Sea, the wind, and the void - Combine thrice in furious fervour
Unrestrained, omnipotent, thunderous - Ever flowing gaze revealed
Tributaries direct knowledge on the course of existence
The source of all that is and all that will ever be

Overwhelming foreboding - A glimpse into eyes of potential
Ancient immutable master - Harkening at the ocean's command
The deafening roar of silence, come, wash over desires
Impotent sense reawaken, once in contempt of the call
Essence drawn upward on gusts of released whispers
Imperative forces acknowledge all thoughts upon thee
Deep majestic void ascend forth
Enhanced with fires eternal
Natures forbidden knowledge
Discover in darkness, roll hidden aeons
