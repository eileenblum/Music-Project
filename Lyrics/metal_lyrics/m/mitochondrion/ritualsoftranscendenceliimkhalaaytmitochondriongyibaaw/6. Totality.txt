[Rites Of Thy Degringolade Cover]

Before mortal tongues muttered he hath departed
The events that occured. Oh thy journey, how thee
hath given me power to become as all.
Now the house is at hand.
They gaze at the sky for the final time.
Knowing this not their kingdom.
Behold the apparition of the Anti-Transport
Departure occuring
My grail is knowledge
My plate
We the purest
Devotion our life's work
I've become Totality
