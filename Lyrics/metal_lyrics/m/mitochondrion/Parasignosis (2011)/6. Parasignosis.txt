You are the finite (INFINITE)
You are the order (CONSUMING ORDER)
Within right and left
Both for and against disorder (PURE ORDER)

In the true symbol and nature of the beast
We enthrone the shape of the worm
In the false perception of prevolution all are
For god dwells within benthos: blood, and sperm

Oh hallowed parasite, to consume the benign
Ingesting all life, infecting beyond damnation
A needless evocation, of the unrestricted god malign
Axis of form and corruption (CORRUPTION)
Divinity in the DISGUSTING
Perfection in CONSUMATION
Absolute instinct metastasized, (the monolithic question remains)

When will you actualize?

Parasite!!!
Cleanse veiled eyes!!!
Parasight!!!
When will you entrust, actual-eyes!!!

When all have perished
When all have accepted Gnostic solitude
When all have betrothed infection
You will see
When all has lived
When all have received the hunter's arrow
Then, and only then,
You will see!!!

Sickness and plight are illumination
Pythagorean numinous ...

[SPEECH:]
Now I see the great black obstacle, in all its worm eaten grandeur,
A militant shining arch angel? an undiscovered daemon?
No! There is no mistaking the duality of it all,
This is the veiled god of 3 heads
THERE IS NO TIME TO WASTE he speaks
FOR THERE IS NO TIME, EMBRACE ME.
They whisper... AT LAST...GIVE ME YOUR EYES!!
NEVER!! (YES!!)

Without gods, spores prevail
Without masters, slaves prevail
Without daemons, worms prevail
Without blindness, parasight prevail!!

Parasight, Pure sight
Parasite, You will see
When will you entrust ACTUAL Eyes
