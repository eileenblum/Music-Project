Strike down Saturn
You shall never consume me
Strike down Saturn
For soon I shall be purely of the eleven!!!

Thrive vesseled man, evolve towards the sublime
Reconcile the numbers long lost in pneumatic cohesion
Blackest bile, PURIFY
Shining one, ILLUMINATE
Ensanguined, UNIFY
God within, CRUSH THE MELANCHOLIC ONE

Terrorize the great malefic
The devouring black obstacle

Strike down Saturn
You shall never consume me
Vitriolic wisdom
Curse the crescent below the cross

Darkness bringer I shall overcome
When isolation reigns over the unified
Fear imbalanced knowledge to transform
Descend the steps towards darkness, and to thus spirit become

Here, Drink to the blood of stone
Here, Thirst to the bile of ash
Here, Feast on the flesh of iron
COME! We shall reap and ignite the impure

Insurmountable perfection is the unity of all that is opposed
When one becomes the work, and when then work is the ONE
Cast out dyscarastic stigmas, balance the aeonic four,
Exaltations rearrange in truth nihil extraneum

When all have submersed
When all have combined
When all have been executed
You will hear
When all have become ALL
When all have become NOTHING
When all have turned to lead
You will hear!!
You will fear!!

Strike down Saturn
You shall never consume me
Vitriolic wisdom,
Curse the crescent below the cross
Strike down Saturn
You have and will never consume me
Strike down Saturn
And feel the SPEAR OF SATAN

For I am of the eleven
And I hunger as you
My purity, it shall melt your lead idol
And it is I who will consume YOU!

I feel the beating of the wings (OF VICTORY)
I hear the slithering of the nameless (OF THE DEEP)
I shall carry your chariot (OF DEATH)
For I shall spit the TETRAVIRULENCE

(And feast with Satan upon the one hundred, thirty, seven!!!)
