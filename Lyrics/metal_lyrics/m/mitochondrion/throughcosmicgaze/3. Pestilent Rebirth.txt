[music N. Gibas, N. Yanchuk, lyrics S. Hache]

An enigmatic pulse signals the beginning
An epic phase change ruptures moral fibre
Solid to liquid structure to calamity
Reveal the consequences of falsification

Reality begins where bliss ceases to be
Cacauphonies of ancient tongues in the foreground
Diminish to irrelevance and vague memories
A self manifestation of betrayal

Influence - An uprising

Fear provokes to states of such ignorance
Cure diseases with vision restoration
Blind induction, mass methods of control
Turn-Confront- Impending death eruption

Veil Defiled - Anger fed through deceit
Pride Restored - Free from false oppression

Band Akin - The ranks are ever growing
Suffering - Arise to strike as one

Weapons of agony strike against frailty
Newly discovered strength through sheer futility
Enlightened to the fact of life's mortality
Weakness, the flaw that serves inevitability

Fear provokes to states of such ignorance
Cure diseases with vision restoration
Blind induction, mass methods of control
Turn-Confront- Impending death eruption
