[music M. Aramenko, lyrics S. Hache]

Grail of achievement at half length's distance
Stunted by keepers of the coveted rank
A restriction of time's permutation
Oh loathed barriers overturn!

Infallibility prevented by birth
Unctuous seed prolonged at
Parallel ties
The morose catalyst
An expansion of sheer
Evolution
A bewildering sense of purity
Epochal equilibrium is
Contemplated
A lineage of damnable filth remains
New life breathed into corroded
Chains of confinement, memory's heirlooms

Defy nature's governance - Retribution is imminent
Secret seditious *council - Demigods on golden seats
Lie in wait in banishment, Frequent and so full
Pandemonic reason, defiant till reascention
In the mind holds the key to perception
Better to reign in misery that serve under tyranny

Oh cursed tyrant! Futile destiny fulfilled
Mounting paradox of free will and predestination

Defy nature's governance - Retribution is imminent
Secret seditious *council - Demigods on golden seats
Lie in wait in banishment, Frequent and so full
Pandemonic reason, defiant till reascention
In the mind holds the key to perception
Better to reign in misery that serve under tyranny
