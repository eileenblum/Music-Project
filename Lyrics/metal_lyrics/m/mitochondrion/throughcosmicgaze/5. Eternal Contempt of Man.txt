[music and lyrics N. Yanchuk]

Despair!! Wretched of man
Legions contemptuous march from the abyss
Opposed the unformed portal they mass
Await the hour to tear the gate asunder

Crush the sentry, swiftly and thus
Descend upon epic battles below
Source of their strength and source of their numbers
Lies are the waking magicks of old

WAR! The scourge of fire and pain engulf the earth
BLOOD! Relentlessly pouring from the wounded skies BLACK BLOOD!
TREACHERY! As the watchers fall their hate will grow
HATE shall be all the conquered earth will know

DESTRUCTION! Forces of flame and war are those that rule
CHAOS! For the watchers slay as would sordid demons MANKIND!
REVENGE will be theirs by Armageddon and so
HATE shall be all the conquered earth shall know

Despair, oh holy ones
The guardians in battle dissolve the pact
Forged in the bloods of earlier races
Protection sworn from darkness' attack

In alliance with the hordes of the serpent
Mankind, lay down all spears and all swords
Destruction and suffering multiply endlessly
Forces forgotten will reign once more

ONCE MORE!!

Forces forgotten, will reign, Once More!!

WAR! The scourge of fire and pain engulf the earth
BLOOD! Relentlessly pouring from the wounded skies BLACK BLOOD!
TREACHERY! As the watchers fall their hate will grow
HATE shall be all the conquered earth will know

DESTRUCTION! Forces of flame and war are those that rule
CHAOS! For the watchers slay as would sordid demons MANKIND!
REVENGE will be theirs by Armageddon and so
HATE shall be all the conquered earth shall know

Now the earth, sea, and sky all have torn
Now a gate from the void hath been born
Both the watchers and the unholy do agree
Eradicate that vermin filth humanity

FILTH!!!

Annihilation, devastation, decimation
