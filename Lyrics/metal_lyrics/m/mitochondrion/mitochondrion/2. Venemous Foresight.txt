[music N. Gibas lyrics S. Hache]

Through unintended acts of freewill
Witnessing the oncoming collapse
Carnage on the horizon
Deep withing forgotten realms of time

Venomous Foresight

Existing apart from reality
Their sources are tapped
Shrouds of malignant forces escape
And poison the vision of one

Venomous Foresight

Granted sight of prophetic abilities
A beacon of the impure masses
Burdened to carry this grim knowledge
The end is realized in full
Mysterious sources of Armageddon
Unknown spiritual assailants
Pierce and inject venomous foresight
Tampering with inevitable fate

Futile attempts to preserve this filth
Are eventually abandoned
Ultimate stages are bestowed
Visualize Mankind's wretchedness

Details unravel in dark horrors
A selfish species shall meet its doom

Blackened skies signal the beginning
Paralleled to the foreseen image
Visions come uninterrupted
As clouds begin to smolder and hiss
The stench of nonexistence thickens
Initial stages of extinction
As fire descends upon the deserving
Scorched earth and spilled blood shall shape a future

Cycles - Continue as determined
The unknown - force is unrelenting
Columns - of fire, wind, and ash flow
Illuminate - a once abused horizon

Sweeping across lands, sown hate is reaped
Ghosts of a putrid race remain

Scorched earth and spilled blood shall shape a future
Columns - of fire, wind, and ash flow
