When it returns from the darkness our world lies in threat.
For the last time the world shall stand.
In the end shall lay broken.

"The final terrible battle shall begin."

Thus everything dies, but only mortals die forever.
The others watch and wait eternally in the shadows.
The black sword of vengeance shall strike.

"Thus spake the one who sat in judgement.
For he foretold the ruin of the world."

His words were whispered among us all......
When the world is old and powers fade,
the sun and the moon shall be destroyed.
Surrender your sun to me.
Thus everything dies in the diminishing light.
This day we doth not speak for it shall be our last.
