Expiring visions beset the waters as honest
hearts embrace the sea.
At nightfall we sail this tempest of death.
A cry to their gods initiates a message in flames.
When land is found the brave are safe.
"For those who came to pass these
treacherous waters met a mysterious veil.
Pandemonium ensued."

Do not disturb the water!
Never again shall the eyes of men
gaze upon these shores.
