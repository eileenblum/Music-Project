"We are gathered as many, and we shall run as one.
My men, raise your swords.
Pledge your allegiance to our undying will."

Pledge your allegiance to our undying will.
For at night we march and we must be ready.
Never shall our sons witness the fall of our gods.
Prepare for war! Fear not the darkness.
Prepare for war! Fear not for death.
Prepare for war! We must endure.
With war we wander.
Prepare for war! We must endure.

"My men we must stand as kings.
My men, we must fear no evil.
Go! And unleash hell!"

Ride out for war - ride as many.
Through the darkness we shall gather.
Through the sunlight we shall strike.
And then we shall see the shores at dawn.
Forward!
