Damn this path I walk
All is so quiet here
Calm before the storm
End of humanity?

Unleash the demons of the dark
This time I have lost, went all in
Sweet smell of victory is gone
I wake up and sense the fear
When the hour struck us
When the fury tears us all apart
There will be a time for being strong
We created it all in the life we lived

Close the path I walk
All is abandoned here
In filth the demons crawl
Powered by all the shame
When the hour struck us
When the fury tears us all apart
There will be a time for being strong
We created it all in the life we lived

Caught in a silence everything's calm
I feel alone and afraid
I look at the world as it's holding its breath
Then I look away
Oh your deeds has come for you
Holy four rose like war
Now is the time to speak out!

A wave on the water a wind in the trees
Turns into chaos at once
The earth starts to shake and you run for your life
But there's nowhere to hide

A burning inferno rise to the sky
Turns the town into dust
The elder are screaming: "This is for our sins
Armageddon is now!"

Oh my savior where're you now?
We're forsaken
We're crucified
When the hour struck us
When the fury tears us all apart
There will be a time for being strong
We created it all in the life we lived
In the life we lived
