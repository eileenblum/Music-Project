You lead the fight
I bring the truth
Can't have it all
It's so unreachable
If you don't care

These staring eyes
They penetrate
Will reach your mind
If you know what I mean
Nothing to fear
Come see the world inside my head
Join the living dead
Believe the word and turn away from it all

Reveal the life
You kept within
Corrupted life
Take it away from me
I don't want my share

Protected minds
Of what's obscene
You failed their lies
And took it back from me
Welcome to my show
Come see the world inside my head
Join the living dead
Believe the word and turn away from it all

Life stands still
I pull the trigger
Set you free away from it all

To be the one
Who pulls the trigger
And set you free away from it all
Come see the world inside my head
Join the living dead
Believe the word and turn away from it all
Come see the world inside my head
Join the living dead
Believe the word and turn away from it all
