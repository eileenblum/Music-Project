In a world of fantasies
I float around like a ship without sails
A quick escape my remedy
Reach out your hand
And I'll show you the world of the damned

Nothing to do for me but pray
I close my eyes to leave my worries
It's my world please go away
I want it back, back what's taken from me
'Cause I am mortality
Say that we fade into grey
You are the pain inside us
Follow into the unknown

The world is set for me to reign
Under the sun to cast a shadow
I tried so hard to break these chains
I leave my hate to those
Who are beyond change
'Cause I am mortality
Say that we fade into grey
You are the pain inside us
Follow into the unknown

We stand on the edge
Let us dive into light
'Cause I am
and I fear mortality
Say that we fade into grey
You are the pain inside us
Follow into the unknown
Dive into the unknown
