Sweet caress
of humiliation
Ruled by a voice
of a forreign nation
Taking it's vengeance on you
with a war
Too late to pray for redemption

Here's your mission, obey your superior's command
Look at yourself in the mirror of confidence
Take no prisoners, kill them all
Wipe your hands clean with your own blood

Meet the beast
fed on pure oppression
Craven killers
shaped by human nature
Nobody's innocent here
this is a war
Look at yourself

Here's your mission, obey your superior's command
Look at yourself in the mirror of confidence
Take no prisoners, kill them all
Wipe your hands clean with your own blood

They're standing, laughing in your face as you scream
The pain will slowly take control of your soul

Here's your mission, obey your superior's command
Look at yourself in the mirror of confidence
Take no prisoners, kill them all
Wipe your hands clean with your own blood
Here's your mission, obey your superior's command
Look at yourself in the mirror of confidence
Take no prisoners, kill them all
Wipe your hands clean with your own blood
