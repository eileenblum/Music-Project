I'm afraid to lose the way
To never know my whereabouts
Unable to relate
I'm afraid I'm not awake
So wake me up before the dawn
And loosen my restrains

I'm afraid to walk another way
So get in line and look away
Too weak to disobey
Please remember me
Sweet dreams of who I am
An ordinary man
With an ordinary plan

Now it's time to cease the day
Of who you are and what you've been
Will always be the same
Yes life is just a game
Invite all fools and start again
I am the lie in the truth
I am reflections of a youth
Forever like in a dream
I rise again with my beliefs

Blinded by the pain
The acid disintegrates my name and nothing more
Lost in a modern world
Lost in a sudden world
Lost in a perfect world again
I'm crawling I've reached this far
The time has come to hear my call
Come closer show me who you are
There's a broken shadow in your heart

Believe the word...
I am the lie in the truth
I am reflections of a youth
Forever like in a dream
I rise again with my beliefs
Come closer show me who you are
There's a broken shadow in your heart
