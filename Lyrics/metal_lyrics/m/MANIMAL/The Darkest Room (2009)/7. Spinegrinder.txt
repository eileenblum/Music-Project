I'm an angel
I'm the grinding angel
And I've been watching you for a while
I've been standing in the corner
I've been hiding in your closet corner
So let's bring to light what seldom shine

Sending chills straight down your spine
If you hide then I will find
And I've been searching for a while
You can't protect yourself from me
I can see what you can feel
If you're weak then you will carry me

Agony and misery I owe
You man
Eternity commencing as you love...

the Spinegrinder
Spinegrinder

I see you
Yes, with a shattered future
You're with me?til the end of time
As the breaching of all borders
Freedom rings under six foot sorrows
A hasty life between infinity and forever

Agony and misery I love
You man
Eternity commencing as you owe...
the Spinegrinder
Spinegrinder
Spinegrinder
Spinegrinder

Here I am,
for all the world to see
with broken hands I am the king of me
sent to the world on my own, in order to redeem

Agony and misery I love
You man
Eternity commencing as you grow, grow grow...
a Spinegrinder
Spinegrinder
Spinegrinder
It's the Spinegrinder
SPINEGRINDER
