These walls they bleed
Of desire pain and faith
Are we to blame
For our shadows?

When the armies of weakness
Are rising from inside your heart
A society resting on shoulders
Falling apart
Fight your war
Leave your insanity
Say that you will return again
A promise you never kept
Fight your war

I bang my head against the wall
'cause all my dreams should not been dreamt
We bleed to death for our shadows

Can you feel all the weakness around you
Reach for your heart?
A society resting on shoulders
Fallingt apart
Fight your war
Leave your insanity
Say that you will return again
A promise you never kept
Spread your words
Follow your destiny
Look for the sign
It leads you there

When the armies of weakness
Are rising from inside your heart
A society resting on shoulders
Fall apart
Fall apart!
Fight your war
Leave your insanity
Say that you will return again
A promise you never kept
Spread your words
Follow your destiny
Look for the sign
It leads you, there!
