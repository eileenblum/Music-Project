Time moves on leaving me
In this godforsaken place
Left with thoughts of a life
Without dreams I would speak empty words
Shattered fame makes the end of it all
You will become who I am and what we are

With fragments of life I'm forging my
dream and I'm screaming for more
And I will receive the honour I've earned
In grief we will burn to clear our evil thoughts
Shattered dreams will resemble us all
Broken and lost they shall fall, into the...

Time will forget
Time will believe
All I have lost will return if I call

Dreamers and fools
Followed by fear
The search for our freedom will end on this day

So they face the evil
Keep on burning, take the fall

All shattered dreams will resemble us all
Broken and lost they shall fall, into the...
Time will forget
Time will believe
All I have lost will return if I call

Dreamers and fools
Followed by fear
The search for our freedom will end on this day
