In a time and place
The search is on of what's forgotten
Life has brought a name for you

They say it's gone
Appearances are all deceptive
I cry out my hate for you

Time will go on and on
Though life has to fade
Another failure
I believe that destiny is made
We are courageous
Fighting in despair

Follow the faithless
Look and find the spring of all mistakes
Another failure
Fighting 'til the end

Another lie another plague
Further setback for the bleeding ones
Don't you give me cures which can not heal

In vain we pray
But no one seems to heed the whisper
Judas is the name for you

Time will go on and on
Though life has to fade
Another failure
I believe that destiny is made
We are courageous
Fighting in despair

Follow the faithless
Look and find the spring of all mistakes
Another failure
Fighting 'til the end

Oh, in despair
In despair!
Never surrender
Never give up
