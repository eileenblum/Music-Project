I am the master of your nightmares
Touching your mind
Infecting your soul

Taste of pollution
Poison running through your veins
Fighting the internal pain

I hear him calling
My enemy, a silent scream in agony
One step from falling
I hear him calling out my name

Trapped in the shadows
Enlightened by darkness
Guided by demons
For eternity

A strong desire of a vengeance
Growing inside
Take back what was mine

Retaliation for the years I've been astray
Fed up with this mental decay

I hear him calling
My enemy, a silent scream in agony
I hear him calling out my name

Trapped in the shadows
Enlightened by darkness
Guided by demons
For eternity

Still hear him calling
My enemy, a silent scream in agony
One step from falling
I hear him calling out my name

Trapped in the shadows
Enlightened by darkness
Guided by demons
For eternity
