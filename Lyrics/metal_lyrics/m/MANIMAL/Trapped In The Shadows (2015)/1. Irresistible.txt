I am the face of the liar
Gaze at the world through my eyes
Ask yourself what you desire
Truth is the way of the weak

Out of the dark I resurrect
Chaos of mind
Feelings unkind
Swept away

Irresistible
Walk through fire
Irresistible
Cold desire

Coping with mental confusion
Am I awake or asleep?
Witness my own execution
Sinking into the deep

Caught in the jaws of hate and pain
Speeding through life
Sharpen the knife
Go insane

Irresistible
Walk through fire
Irresistible

Back on the train heading nowhere
Catching the ride of my life
Travelled too far to get sober
Vanishing into the mist

Resistance forever
You are indeed the devil
Existence together
Will lead to my downfall

Irresistible
Walk through fire
Irresistible
Cold desire
