Neglected and shaped out of treason
Tormented by evil and agony
A victim let down for no reason
Abandoned - the system has failed

Left out in the cold
On the edge of sanity

You are a man-made devil

Rejected, betrayed and forsaken
Degraded by gossip and calumny
An offspring whose childhood was taken
Mistreated and left in disgrace

Left out in the cold
On the edge of sanity

Man-made devil
Beyond the violence lays despair
Man-made devil
Searching for answers to his prayer

Try, walk the line
Though you're battered and hurt
Fight for your life
As you're dying internally

While the sun is setting
The bells begin to chime
Condemned to eternal darkness
For the nature of his crime

Man-made devil
Beyond the violence lays despair
Man-made devil
Searching for answers to his prayer
Devil
