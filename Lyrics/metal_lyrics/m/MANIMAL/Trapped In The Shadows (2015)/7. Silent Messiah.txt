Child, I'm the war in your soul tonight
And the spirit that haunts your mind
When you fall on your knees and pray
Pray for your life

Touching the ground of the liar
Watching him light the fire
You gaze at the sky
And ride upon the lie
The time of the sinner is now
Time to die

Caught in the fire
Make me shed blood, decry, obey
The silent messiah
Caught in the fire
Make me shed blood, decry, betray
In silence of God

Cry, there's a cold winter storm outside
Where the blind is leading the blind
Feel the flame in the wind of death
And take your last breath

Touching the ground of the liar
Watching him light the fire
You gaze at the sky
And ride upon the lie
The time of the sinner is now
Time to die

Caught in the fire
Make me shed blood, decry, obey
The silent messiah
Caught in the fire
Make me shed blood, decry, betray
In silence of God
