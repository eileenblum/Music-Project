Haunted by dreams of the past
Blinded by darkness the altar is calling
Sodom is rising from dust
To poison our souls

Look at the man on the cross
Where is your God now the angels have fallen?
There is no shelter for us
No future for mankind

You will scream in silence:
"No guidance from above!"
In the valley of the dead
You will rise

This is the march of madness
We've passed the point of no return
When we all stare down the abyss
Come taste the fire now and burn

Countdown to total collapse
The fight will go on 'til the last man is standing
Yet a collective relapse
Of manic abuse

Wounded we stand at the gate
Tortured by angels and blessed by the demons
Sentenced to anger and hate
The future of mankind

You will scream in silence:
"No guidance from above!"
In the valley of the dead
You will rise

This is the march of madness
We've passed the point of no return
When we all stare down the abyss
Come taste the fire and burn
