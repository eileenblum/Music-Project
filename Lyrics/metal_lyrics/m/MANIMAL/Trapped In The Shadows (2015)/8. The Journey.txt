Living in a dream of illusionary fantasies
Below a silent sun and I don't know where I am

All alone - lost in barren land

Faceless in this dream I am standing here in front of you
I'll guide you on your path if only pure of mind

Follow me - a journey so divine

The pain of a soul
A way of salvation
The end of the world
A slave of creation

Pass the Gates of hell as we walk beyond all sanity
The punishments of sins now appear before our sight

Without hope
Walk toward the light

Testify the pain and behold the sinners' agony
I will leave you now - from here you're on your own

Hear my words - seek and you shall find

Head held high - leave the past behind

The pain of a soul
A way of salvation
The end of the world
A slave of creation
