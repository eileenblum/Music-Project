There comes a time
When all must face
And wipe away the filth of the human race
To redefine
What we've become
And to restore order not to suffocate

Am I alive
Because I hate
Have I the right to alter another's fate
I realize what we've become
Can we restore order not to suffocate

I'm watching a world of decay
Lost forever
The time has come to roll the dice

Fight!
The hunger
The taste of blood
Riders of the dark

Through endless days and nights
I've tried to master the pain
Gaze beyond the spite
Before we've all gone insane

You don't know what I've sacrificed
I've seen the hate with my own eyes
I take the world and paint it black
To cover up and make us blind

I'm watching a world of decay
Lost forever
The time has come to roll the dice

Fight!
The hunger
The taste of blood
Riders of the dark
