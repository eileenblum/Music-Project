I see a darkened sky
The sun has fallen
Forsaken for all eternity
Time to unveil the lie
Reveal the mass deceivers
Believers misled for centuries

A rootless cry
In vain you die

You should have known it
You should have told it
We are invincible

You should have known it
Forever dethroned it
We are invincible

Grace in the night
Worn down of spite
Angels will fall from the sky

Preacher of lies
Devil in disguise
Feeding on preys of his life

You should have known it
You should have told it
We are invincible

You should have known it
Forever dethroned it
We are invincible

Is this the path that we must go
The end that we all know
It has begun, all's said and done
Now everyone will gain
Laughter and pain

Is this the path that we must go
The end that we all know
It has begun, all's said and done
Now everyone will claim
Fortune and fame

I fold my hands to the sky
And scream an endless "why?"
What if there isn't a God
Then what is left of us?

You should have known it
You should have told it
We are invincible

You should have known it
Forever dethroned it
We are invincible
