I was forced to make a choice
Though I can't tell right from wrong
You will pay for what you've done
When the final day has come

I will search a meaning
In the air I'm breathing now
Grasping for control
I will taste the spirit
Of another living soul
Reach my final goal

I can hear them calling
And their time is running out

Hear the million spirits crying out in vain
We should burn in flames
Hear the million spirits crying out the blame
Screaming out the shame

Haunted by a dream of truth
Hidden deep inside my mind
Come on here and taste the youth
Spit it out I hope you choke

I can hear them calling
And their time is running out

Hear the million spirits crying out in vain
We should burn in flames
Hear the million spirits crying out the blame
Screaming out the shame
