The final breath is deep
Followed by nothing but silence
-"Walk with me" says a dark, distant voice

Death's not the closing end
If you can defend your actions
New endeavors lay ahead of you now

A sign from above
A voice from below
The passing of a man
A dear friend or a foe

So take my hand
Let go of your hate
The Scales of Justice
Determine your fate

Mighty psychopomp
The guardian of angels
Mighty psychopomp
Keeper of the dead
Mighty psychopomp
The guardian of angels
Mighty psychopomp
Watching over me

A maze of shattered souls
Don't stumble and fall
The gaze from beyond
Is suppressing your call

So take my hand
There's nowhere to run
Unveil your soul
And let justice be done

Mighty psychopomp
The guardian of angels
Mighty psychopomp
Keeper of the dead
Mighty psychopomp
The guardian of angels
Mighty psychopomp
Watching over me
