Objecting the relative of it all
Challenging the confidence, so sadly
Repress the incline, desolate cavity, drained in deceit
My presence of mind shamed by dark views,
I yearn to ascend, forlorn!
Forlorn among the lie, sanctity denied
Reason of life brought forth and denied
Existence in pain the callous uprise
Grasping out alone but alive, suffer now forlorn and denied
Forlorn among the lie, I'm not gonna be
Suppress oppressive life, I'm not gonna be
Surreal in solitude
Cast out in my revulse
Forlorn among the lie, I'm not gonna be
Suppress oppressive life, I'm not gonna be, denied
So many times I fallen this path,
Time and time again wondering where does it end
So many times lost one time again,
So many days lost in the apathy
So many times lost one time again...again...again...
Shattered in my solitude of pain. Of fucking pain
Shattered and now forlorn
Not gonna be, never
I'm not gonna be, never
I'm not gonna be, never
I'm never gonna be forlorn...
