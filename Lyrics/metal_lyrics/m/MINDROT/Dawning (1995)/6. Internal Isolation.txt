Consumed by a memory untouched from inside
A time undiminished and so complete
Together we walk this path so carelessly
Alone I fall into the circle of insanity
Alone... alone, alone...
I cry from a dormant existence of love
Descending from agony is the day I used to... I used to know
I used to know, love, love, I used to know...
Barrier extended from darkness
Becoming a prisoner of my solitude
Built up to exactly what I despise
Oppressed by anger isolation from my own mind
Internal Isolation...
Shattered life, callous and once alive
Confounding alone in my bewilderment
When the walls grow from inside and this emptiness
Eats her alive she will reach the final fall of her life
When the walls grow from inside and this emptiness
Eats her alive she will reach the end of her life
Internal isolate, internal isolation, internal isolate
Interlan isolation, internal isolate, internal isolation...
