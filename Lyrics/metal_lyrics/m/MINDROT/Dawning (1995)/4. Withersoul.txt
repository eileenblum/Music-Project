Questioning and searching endlessly
Meaning will never seal complete
What that you learn detain, interpret the lies, forfeit our demise... demise...
Questioning and searching endlessly,
Meaning will never seal complete
Birds fly, birds try, the most I've seen tried
Human compassion, nothing but dissatisfaction
Standardize viewing, modern loving undoing... undoing
Human compassion, nothing but dissatisfaction
A blink of an eye as my world passes by
The finger points accused in innocence
Like our tales as forbidden, and misgiven
Breathe the hope, darkening remains I mope
Question my heart, plundered hearts roaming out of control
Seeing many faces, how many we forget,
The many we long to forget
Shedding the tears that ripple the tides
Though we speak and see in this present life
Shedding with tears that ripple the tides
Though we speak and see in this present life...
Missing vision deceiving my sorrow
Missing closeness of the past, letting go it came at last
Dreaming a vision thought deceiving
My sorrow was the only feeling
Mourne at the burdens mock this life
As we it passes like time touching feel ghost of this crime
Patch of coldness insight of mind
Willing to proceed and survive
Sun setting alone 'till next daylight
