Compelled by hatred
My perpetual scowl
No direction for my anger
This pain is always there

Never, never again
Never, feel this way again
Never, never again
Never... Feel this way again

Inside my life it's so simplistic
Visions of bliss and love for you
Outside my life is brutalized
Raped and murdered by this false emotion

Inspirations of my dreams
Replaced by factual nightmares
To awake in extreme disgust
Reclaim myself and walk away

I stay, far away
I stay, far far away

And I will never feel you, feel you again
A reclamation of all I have lost
Compelled by falseness your lustful sin
You're gone, no more cold skin

Stay away, for fear I may come, far away
Your tears still come down, alone and gray,
You're alone and gray
Far away, you stay far far far away...
