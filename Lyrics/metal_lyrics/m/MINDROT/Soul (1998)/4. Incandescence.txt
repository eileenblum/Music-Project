Apprehend seize of time
Mandatory means crucify my eyes
Mountain scene beautifully defined
Earthly worlds freeze frame divine
The book of life I see I open

Worn pages crumble, set about the flaps
Old tired faces stare into the lens of still life
What has been, and to think what will come
An elder and wise still growing stronger with time

Give me spirit, let it shine onto me
Breathe new tides, what I feel flowing deep
Take me to the high, take me too
Take me to the heights

Apprehension this seize of time
Mandatory means crucify my eyes
Mountain scene beautifully defined
Earhly worlds freeze frame divine

Worn pages crumble, set about the flaps
Tired faces stare into the lens of still life
What has been, and to think what will come
An elder and wise still growing stronger with time

Let it down on me
Can't you see it flowing through me?
Take me there, want to breathe the air
Wheel turn, it's turning with me
Take me, wheel turn, take me
Wheel turn, take me, it's a part of me, take me
It's a part of me, it's a part of me, take me
It's a part of me, it's a part of me
