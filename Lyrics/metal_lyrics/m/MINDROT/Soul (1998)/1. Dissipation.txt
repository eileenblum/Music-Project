My voice dissipates
My anger dominates
I cry inside, hurting all those in line
Never feel, I never feel
I fall into silent upheaval

Drained, gasp my last breath
Ravaged, hurting to set them in place

Delusion and rage
Need to be one contained
Need to slow down, take hold
Hope in need, time alone please

Delusion and rage
Headstrong where is my grace
Cry like the wind
Only answer is within
