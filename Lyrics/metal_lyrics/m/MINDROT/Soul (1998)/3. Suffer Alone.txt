I sleep through the melting sun
Caressed by its somber set
Free from the pain I suffered
A suffering you will never forget

You don't want to know my pain
You don't want to feel this way
Do you want to ease my pain?
Do you want to take it all away?

No, take it away
No, take it all away

It pours over washing out emotionless
I'm drained from the truth that's cold and dead
Cold and dead as I am

You brought all this onto yourself
So for my piece of mind I need you to

Suffer for me suffer
You will never feel
Suffer alone suffer
You will never feel alive

You don't want to know my pain
You don't want to feel this way
