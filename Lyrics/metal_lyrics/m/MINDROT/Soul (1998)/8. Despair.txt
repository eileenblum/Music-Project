Reach out find nothing
It was like we were always astray, alone

Alone far from the truth
Dark, distraugh, alone still no truth

Reaching out, finding nothing
No response, in trust with nothing
Worlds apart, and in-between
So this is me, this is me

Once I felt as one now alone, far from the truth
Slowly my soul tears apart

For me to see are we blind, why me?
Are we blind, to see, what truth will we see?

Enclosed withing, dreaming a sin, sacrifice my life for this
Fear to die my key for life to pass I wish
Black alone and misinformed slowly I die, die alone
Far from home and so alone
I've tried so hard
Far from home

This emptiness fills my mood
Night and day my heart hurts too
Why am I so cold inside?
Why must I slowly die?
