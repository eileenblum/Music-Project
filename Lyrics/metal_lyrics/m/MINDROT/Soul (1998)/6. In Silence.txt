Would you die for me now? Take your life for me?
Would you do these things for me?
I would die for you, take my life from you
I would do these things for you

This burden of guilt, weighs deep upon my shoulders
My tears are my strength I shall not release
And I give you the gift of enduring my pain
I am open to you now, cold through my eyes

Would you cry for me now...? In silence
Take your life for me...? In silence
Would you do these things for me?
I would die for you now, take my life from you
I would do this all for you, for you...

In the name of sorrow, I would give you all my pain
In the name of silence, I would do it again
And again and again
In the name of silence,
I would bring it all right down to the end

Would you cry for me now? Take your life for me?
Would you do these things for me?
I refuse to be now, setting my soul free now
And I do this all for you... You...

I would for you... in silence
I would for you... in silence
I would do this all for you

Would you cry for me now? Take your life for me?
Would you do these things for me?
I refuse to be now, setting my soul free now
I would do this all for you, for you...

I would, I would for you, and I and I and I would
Don't you know I would, I would for you
And I and I and I would
I would, I would for you
