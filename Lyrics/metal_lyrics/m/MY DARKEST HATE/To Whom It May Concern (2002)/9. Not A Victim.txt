You're not a victim
The victim is dead
Raped and killed
Blood mixed with sweat
It's like a sequel
It's always the same
Eyes full of lust
Who is to blame

Innocence
Sweet and pure
Mindless
That's for sure

Not a victim
Not a victim

Blood on your hands
Awaken in tears
Your mortal fear
So many years
Never forget
Immortal remorse
Justice will be
In due course

Innocence
Sweet and pure
Mindless
That's for sure

Not a victim
Not a victim

A life lost forever
Take your last breath
Dignity shred
Sentence of death

It's like a sequel
It's always the same
Eyes full of lust
Who is to blame
Never forget
Immortal remorse
Justice will be
In due course
