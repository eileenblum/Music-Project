I hate therefore I am
I know the reason why
You are the pain in my ass
You're gonna have to die

100 words mean 100 lies
There's nothing more to say
That's only one good reason
I want to crush and slay

My darkest hate
Will ever be
I'm gonna crush
I'm gonna slay

It's said that we should all forgive
To see the lord above
I won't forgive what you've done
I have no belief

You've told too many lies
So come under my feet
You're just a bunch of shit
I wanna see you bleed

My darkest hate
Will ever be
I'm gonna crush
I'm gonna slay

Hate is my power
My honour and pride
Hate is my substance
My love and my guide
