Remember the morning
Cold steel, full of blood
Screaming and yearning
Forever they rot
Thoughts full of rage
You never feel love
Abnormal, perverted
Your vision till death

Now you sit
Inside four walls
Judgement day
So hear the call

Eye for an eye
Tooth for a tooth
Eye for an eye
Tooth for a tooth

Your vision, abnormal
Freedom is gone
The wrong direction
Never the same
No mental home
Your Execution
Embrace your own death
Die in pain

Seek revenge
God willing
Absent-minded
Embrace death
