One like the other
None of human race
Built to exist
Not to resist
Are we the gods
Like he once was
Systems refused
Meaning of love

Built by gods
They are
Built by gods

A child forever
No mother and father
Victim of the future
Choose your brother
Sweet forbidden fruits
If you'd like to play
Through your eyes
They will be

Built by gods
They are
Built by gods

Evolution
The only way
Solution
Just one day
