G o d
I spoke to you
Still waiting
No answer

Hate is growing
So could it be
That it is
Is it me?

Eat my flesh
Drink my blood
I am god

God am I

Holy father
Hope is gone
Never again
I'm not your son

Power is mine
Now I see
The wall is broken
Now I am free

Eat my flesh
Drink my blood
I am god

God am I

Hate is growing
So could it be
That it is
Is it me?

All is forgiven
Now I know
It is me
Now I am free

God am I
