Going down
The stairs of life
Never look back
Plunge in a knife

Look in the mirror
No hope is left
Too weak to renew
Too strong to forget

Judgement day
Is coming nearer

Scars of life
Furrows of suffering

Written in faces
Anger and pain
Numberless hours
One life in vain

Find no solution
Pay all the cost
At the end
Your future is lost

Judgement day
Is coming nearer

Scars of life
Furrows of suffering
