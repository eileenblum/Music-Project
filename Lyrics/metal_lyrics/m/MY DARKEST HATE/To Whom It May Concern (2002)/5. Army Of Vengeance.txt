United we stand
In front of the beast
We have the power
Celebrate the feast

I hear the calls
I know them well
Brothers of vengeance
Straight out of hell

Eyes of fear
Deserve my hate
Hail to thee
I grasp your fate

We are the army
Army of vengeance

Put aside rumour
No sense at all
The strong will survive
The weak will fall

First strike is deadly
If not - we return
Armageddon
Pray, see and learn

Enough words are spoken
Vengeance is mine
Bleed and suffer
You're the next in line
