Lord in heaven
Jesus his son
Too young to see
Abandon - gone

Prayed to the false
No suffering relieved
The one and only
God is dead

Pain
Pain
Pain
Pain

A thought of anger
Is in my head
A thought of anger
Relentless, still sad
A thought of anger
Is in my head
A thought of anger
G o d I s d e a d

No love can fill
The hate I feel
Too many years
No wounds will heal

A thought of anger
A thought of anger
A thought of anger

No more religion
I know my way
Life is not easy
No sense to pray
