Bitter dreams of innocence
Seven visions in deep red
Judas your reality
Healing wounds pounding black

My name is blood
My name is blood

Fallen from grace
Fallen from grace

Nothing holy without me
Here I stand for ages
Your crown full with blood
Resurrection wages

My name is blood
My name is blood

Fallen from grace
Fallen from grace

I took your blood forever
You gave your life for me
No comfort in your reign
So it will be
