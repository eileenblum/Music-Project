No wonder will come
Until you create it
No sun will shine
When you donât face it
One year is lost
The father is waiting
Wounds donât heal
Start to stop bleeding

Breathe
Stand up
Scream
Donât stop

No wonder
Will come
No wonder
Will come

Get off your ass
At last youâre alone
Look at yourself
No safety home
Dry to define
Your own book of rules
Begin to ignore
The ocean of fools

Breathe
Stand up
Scream
Donât stop

Be your own master
Donât be a fool
Anger is healthy
Come use the tool
