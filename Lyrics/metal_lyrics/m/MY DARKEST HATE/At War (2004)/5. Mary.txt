Mary, mother
Your son a freak
Taking drugs
Flesh is weak
Senseless, mindless
So many years
Lack of knowlege
Millions of tears

Thanks for bleeding
I think you failed
No holy father
Just pure fucking hate

Mary
Mother of christ

Virgin or whore
Sinner or saint
Nobody knows
Cause for complaint
Fishes stink
Water to wine
I canât see
Grace divine

No way
No truth
No life
Just hate

Mary, mother
Your son a freak
Taking drugs
Flesh is weak
Fishes stink
Water to wine
I canât see
Grace divine
