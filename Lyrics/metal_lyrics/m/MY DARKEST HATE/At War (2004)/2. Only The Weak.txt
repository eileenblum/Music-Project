Power in my veins
Never feel the same
I am the chosen one
Freedom is my aim
Much to my regret
Youâll never win a fight
The loser is foregone
Let me be your guide

Proud here I stand
Another path I walk
Immortal is my will
My enemies I stalk

Only the weak
Will fall
Only the weak
Will fall

Believe in your own fate
My vision is still burning
The fire never ends
My enemies still learning
Life is full of shit
Donât be an easy prey
Even though you fall
Stand up and go your way

Proud here I stand
Another path I walk
Immortal is my will
My enemies I stalk

Only the weak
Will fall
Only the weak
Will fall

No chance to hide
I will reign
Feel my pride
Play my game
