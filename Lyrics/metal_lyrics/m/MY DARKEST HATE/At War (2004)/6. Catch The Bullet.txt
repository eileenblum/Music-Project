Bulletcatcher
Men of honour
Bulletcatcher
Strong and proud
Saving life
Through giving life
That is
What itâs all about

Catch the bullet
Blood will flow
Catch the bullet
Catch

A nother person
To die for
Your private way
To end a war
Twisting wounds
A victim
Pounding blood
Your dictum

Catch the bullet
Blood will flow
Catch the bullet
Catch
