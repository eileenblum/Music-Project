Where is my justice
Whereâs your respect
Merger of equals
Feckless insect

Light a fire
And offer resistance
If you want
Secure existence

Final
Warning
Profit
Seeking

Where is my justice
Where is my justice
Where is your respect

Pull no punches
Aggressive game
Demand for justice
What a shame

Drag in the mud
Bear that in mind
Justice will be
One can still find

Fight for your cause
Bear up against pain
Get the upper hand
Again and again

Light a fire
And offer resistance
If you want
Secure existence
