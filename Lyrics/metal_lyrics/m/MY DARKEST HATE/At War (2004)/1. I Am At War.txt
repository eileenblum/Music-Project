From the dirt
I am revived
So much resistance
I have survived

Here I stand
Pride in my heart
My anger will
Tear you apart

Bleed for me
You little bastard
Iâm here and
I am at war

I leech your mind
And spit your blood
Endless pain
Smell and rot

Your nightmare starts
I canât forget
Broken glass
I want you dead

Bleed for me
You little bastard
Iâm here and
I am at war

From the dirt
I am revived
So much resistance
I have survived

By grace of god
And god am I
My will shall be
As you die
