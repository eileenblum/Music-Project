The time is over
Enough is enough
Too much shit
Letâs get rough

A new day dawning
A chance to hate
Accept with pleasure
No longer wait

Pangs of hunger
Find and feed
Raise the limit
Embrace delete

I will follow
My own rules
I will follow
My own will

Keep the distance
Free your mind
Relieve, shake off
The daily grind

My farewell party
You will never forget
Summon a witness
Dangerous threat

Pangs of hunger
Find and feed
Raise the limit
Embrace delete

I will follow
My own rules
I will follow
My own will
