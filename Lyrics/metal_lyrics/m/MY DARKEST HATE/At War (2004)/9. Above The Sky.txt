Beneath the surface
An angel cried
Red is the color
Where humanity died

A vision beyond
A sea full of blood
A vision of greed
A vision of god

Sleepless, unconscious
Forever lost
The morning after
Amber black frost

A vision beyond
A sea full of blood
Your vision is greed
No substance no god

Above the sky
The color is red
Above the sky
The angels are dead
