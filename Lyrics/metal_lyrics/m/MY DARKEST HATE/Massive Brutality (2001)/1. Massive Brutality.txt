as red as blood can be
my anger and my hate
will last eternally
broken wings of fate

you thought nothing to fear
step by step â the end
your fault, your fear is here
and I will give and send

pounded into dust
I wanna see you cry
I spit on your face
and laugh when you die

MASSIVE BRUTALITY

speak the words goodbye
and greet the lord above
for you it's time to die
feel, enjoy my wrath

silence fills the air
green turns to red
hate, hate, hate
hail and greet the dead

pounded into dust
I wanna see you cry
I spit on your face
and laugh when you die

MASSIVE BRUTALITY
