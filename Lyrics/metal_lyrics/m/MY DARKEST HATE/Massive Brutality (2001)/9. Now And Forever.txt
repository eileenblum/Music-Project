emperor is rising
ashes forlorn
bleeding forever
left you unborn
immortal thoughts
extrem possession
I will hate with
extrem aggression

you can't break me
I will be free
you can't break me
I will be free

NOW AND FOREVER
I will be free
NOW AND FOREVER
my will will be

winds of anger
blown in your face
I will left you
in total disgrace
forever free
my mind is sane
I know the one
who is to blame

you can't break me
I will be free
you can't break me
I will be free

NOW AND FOREVER
I will be free
NOW AND FOREVER
my will will be
