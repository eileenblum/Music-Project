a smile on your lips
blood on your skin
is this the end
a new begin

your life is lust
your lust is pain
can you stop
this painful game

dark kiss
candle
burning
flesh
yearning

extasy / reality
faces behind leather
point of no return
forever, never, ever

PAIN FOR LUST

existence forgotten
reality is lost
pleasures received
you will pay the cost

weird thoughts
go through my head
sometimes I wish
you'd better be dead
