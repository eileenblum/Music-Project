I see the horizon
near the end
my final chapter
to late to repent

years gone forever
rain falls like blood
still I feel anger
I am my own god

the end is just
a new begin
for me, I come
and I will win

you never got
a chance to hide
I will reign
you feel my pride

I will not stop
before you bleed
you will pay
for your greed

The end is just
a new begin
so understand
that I will win
