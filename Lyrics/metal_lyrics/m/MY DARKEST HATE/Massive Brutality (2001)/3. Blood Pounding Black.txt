blood is
pounding black
fear is coming back

you suffer
my destiny
give blood back to me

bleed, my friend
like all the others did

I will...

smell blood
your skin is red
I love the dead

I am
the last
long forgotten past

bleed, my friend
like all the others did

no more...

BLOOD POUNDING BLACK

deep inside
feel hunger
nowhere I can hide

exist to
resist, forget
and forgive for god
