Sathanas in Victoriam!!!

Into damnation
From blackened skies
Through man's temptation
The Beast shall rise
End of creation
Infernal lies
No more salvation
Fake reptile eyes

Reptile!
The snake within your soul
Reptile!
Tempter of old
Reptile!
Through seeds of hate and fire
Reptile!
Serpent's desire

In Revelations
Mass genocide
Destroying nations
Four Horsemen ride
Scenes of elation
As Heaven cries
Evisceration
Of human life

Reptile!
Thourgh ceturies of war
Reptile!
Unholy Law
Reptile!
The snake beneath your skin
Reptile!
Immortal Sin

Sathanas in Victoriam!!!

Let the Hate begin
From the fire of Sin

Reptile!
Etenal life denied
Reptile!
Beneath the lies
Reptile!
Cast out from whence he came
Reptile!
You know His name
Reptile!
Reptile!
Reptile!
Reptile!
Reptile!

Sathanas in Victoriam!!!
