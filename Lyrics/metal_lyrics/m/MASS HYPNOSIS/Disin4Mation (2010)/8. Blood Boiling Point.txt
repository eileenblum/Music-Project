Mankind's greed for oil filtered trough my veins the blood begins to boll the hands
Are getting wet and once again left here on my own with fear of age stained upon my soul pride broken on a wheel spellbound beneath the surface
Consumed by fears i try to run away inside my conscience mourn of victims play ashes from the mountain began to fell felling upon this old and rusted soul
Consumed by fears i try to run away inside my conscience mourn of victims play ash from the mountain began to fell felling upon this old and rusted soul
Pride broken on a wheel spellbound beneath the surface consumed by fears i try to run away inside my conscience mourn of victims play ashes from the
Mountain began to fall falling upon this old and rusted soul
