Cut down the options set determination
sending millions to emigration
nations crawling in front of your feet
everyone is equal just don't measure it

Baptizing children hospital with napalm
hypocrisy
you are the plaque of this civilization
treachery
transforming brothers into sworn enemies
democracy?
declaring heroes, rewarding worst atrocities

Bloodthirsty armies waiting for your command
how many more children will lose their parents on your demand
mellifluous speeches have taste of poison
creating countless victims providing false serenity

hate, hate, hate, hate...
