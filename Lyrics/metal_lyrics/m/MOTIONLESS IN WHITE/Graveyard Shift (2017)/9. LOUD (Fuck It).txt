You gotta be loud you gotta be rude
So the world can hear you
You gotta be crass you gotta be cold
It's everything we know
Turn it up turn it up now

Another day a double shot of hate drink it up like gasoline
Underpaid you graduate to build somebody else's dream
With a noose as a tie do you fantasize of a much different life
The fix for who they want you to be directly streamed to your TV

And when they turn their backs on you...

You gotta be loud you gotta be rude
So the world can hear you
You gotta be crass you gotta be cold
It's everything we know
Turn it up turn it up now
Loud rude
When nobody hears you
You gotta stand up you gotta commit
Say fuck it make the best of it

A broken home you're trying to mend
You got one day left to pay the rent
We're not sure but we believe in the lie that it'll all be fine when we die
It's so easy to grant the mirror power to control what you want to erase
Don't become another victim put a smile on that face

You gotta be loud you gotta be rude
So the world can hear you
You gotta be crass you gotta be cold
It's everything we know
Turn it up turn it up now
Loud rude
When nobody hears you
You gotta stand up you gotta commit
Say fuck it make the best of it

The money's in the treatment baby not in the cure
So they fuel your pain with fear and shame and then hand you a brochure
The money's in the treatment baby not in the cure
So they build you up to watch you fall and then beg for an encore

What are you waiting for
What are you waiting for

You gotta be

You gotta be loud you gotta be rude
So the world can hear you
You gotta be crass you gotta be cold
It's everything we know
Turn it up turn it up now
Loud rude
When nobody hears you
You gotta stand up you gotta commit
Say fuck it make the best of it

Oh make the best of it
Fuck it f-f-f-fuck it fuck it fuck it
What are you waiting for

Another day a double shot of hate
It's everything we know
Drink it up like gasoline
Fuck it make the best of it
