I've watched the whole world drowning in chemicals
Dissociative but it takes its toll
Can I surpass time or would I start to rust
Depreciating collecting dust

And I fear myself as I fall away
In a cold deluded sense of fate
When the nightmares come and the doubt sets in
Will the fever break or will I burn from within

It's too late to feel I've lost my breath
With the hands of time around my neck
Am I more than the pen that wrote the past
Or am I just the sand enslaved by the hourglass

Will I live again or will I fade to black
Dehumanizing when the heart attacks
Will I expire before my dreams unfold
But if the futures so bright the path should glow

As the walls melt and the light fades
I'm letting quicksand take me
As the walls melt and light fades
I'm letting quicksand take me

It's too late to feel I've lost my breath
With the hands of time around my neck
Am I more than the pen that wrote the past
Or am I just the sand enslaved by the hourglass

If you look beyond the blindfold
You'll find the hole in my soul
One fear one mind
No hope no time
If you look beyond the blindfold
You'll find the hole

I'm on the edge of my seat holding out for a sign
Trying to rewrite the storyline

It's too late to feel I've lost my breath
With the hands of time around my neck
Am I more than the pen that wrote the past
Or am I just the sand encased in the hourglass

It's too late to feel I've lost my breath
With the hands of time around my neck
Am I more than the pen that wrote the past
Or am I just the sand encased in the hourglass

Fear is not my fate
Fear is not my fate
