Voices in my head again
Trapped in a war inside my own skin
They're pulling me under
Go!

I've swallowed myself but the fever remains
I'm numb to the pleasure but still feel the pain
If I showed you my soul would you cover your eyes
If I told you the truth would you dare me to lie

I keep it all inside because I know that man is everything but kind

Voices in my head again
Beating me in a war I can't win
I can hear them now
Trapped in a game inside my own skin
And I don't know myself anymore
They're pulling me under
Voices
Voices

As I walk through this valley of shadows and death
I curse not the wicked I praise not the blessed
If I told you the truth you'd beg me to change
If fear were a currency you'd own the bank

Voices in my head again
Beating me in a war I can't win
I can hear them now
Trapped in a game inside my own skin
And I don't know myself anymore
They're pulling me under
Voices

I don't want to live so calloused and frozen ugly and hopeless
I don't want to live forever I just want to live right now
You can't take me from me

Voices in my head again
Head again head again

Voices in my head again
Beating me in a war I can't win
I can hear them now
Trapped in a game inside my own skin
And I don't know myself anymore
They're pulling me under
Voices
Voices
They're pulling me under
Voices
Voices

I keep it all inside because I know that man is everything but kind
I keep it all inside because I know that man is everything but kind
