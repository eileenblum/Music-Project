They try to bend they try to break me by design
But I am the nightmare that will haunt you in the light

If it's war that you want then I'm ready to play
And the world's gonna know my name
Know my name
Know my name
Know my

Through everywhere that I go
Every failure I've owned
Every crack in my bones
I'm untouchable
Like a sleeping grenade
Built to blow you away
Pull the pin I explode
I'm untouchable

I'm untouchable
I'm untouchable
I'm untouchable

Born of the ground I dug myself out from the dirt
With every scar I will avow to shake the earth

Unless it's blood that you want get the fuck out my way
'Cause the world's gonna scream my name
Scream my name
Scream my name
Scream my

Through everywhere that I go
Every failure I've owned
Every crack in my bones
I'm untouchable
Like a sleeping grenade
Built to blow you away
Pull the pin I explode
I'm untouchable

Untouchable
(I will never be silenced)
Untouchable
(I will eclipse the pain)
Untouchable
Untouchable

You can't let it go the price that we pay
But I own the grave from which I came
You reap what you sow we don't bleed the same
'Cause I own the rights to my own fate
And I'll sleep like a king on my deathbed

Through everywhere that I go
Every failure I've owned
Every crack in my bones
I'm untouchable
Like a sleeping grenade
Built to blow you away
Pull the pin I explode
I'm untouchable

Every mile from home
Every failure I've owned
Every crack in my bones
I'm untouchable
Like a sleeping grenade
Built to blow you away
Pull the pin I explode
I'm untouchable

I'm untouchable
I'm untouchable
I'm untouchable
I'm untouchable
