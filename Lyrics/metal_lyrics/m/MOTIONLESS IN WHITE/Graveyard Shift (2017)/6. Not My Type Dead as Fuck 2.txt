She's got no soul heart black as coal
She's from Hollywood Forever dug her out of a hole
And here we go again spinning me in her web
She said, "There's just no rest for the queen of the dead."
There's just no rest for the queen of the dead
There's just no rest for the queen

Another trick to treat with candy apple dreams
Gonna rot her teeth 'cause I'm so sweet
One lick to rule them all
They crumble as they crawl

She loves me 'cause I like to give head like a zombie
Eat eat eat 'til her insides are on me
She loves me 'cause I give head like a zombie
Eat eat eat and nobody's gonna stop me

And in the glow of the pale moonlight
She goes for a spin on my haunted hayride

Tried out the living but I don't believe the hype
'Cause if she's got a pulse then she's not my type

Yeah if she's got a pulse then she's not my type

If she's got a pulse then she's not my type
If she's got a pulse
If she's got a pulse

She's got a temper in stock
Made of hemlock
Uses absinthe as a lip gloss
Death hawk
Fresh New Rock's
She'll use your corpse as a catwalk

She'll use your corpse as a catwalk
She'll use your corpse

She loves me 'cause I like to give head like a zombie
Eat eat eat 'til her insides are on me
She loves me 'cause I give head like a zombie
Eat eat eat and nobody's gonna stop me

And in the glow of the pale moonlight
She goes for a spin on my haunted hayride

Tried out the living but I don't believe the hype
'Cause if she's got a pulse then she's not my type
If she's got a pulse then she's not my type

She'll use your corpse as a catwalk
Plays truth or dare in the mirror
Uses absinthe as a lip gloss
Undead but she won't shed a tear

She's my graveyard baby
She's my

She loves me 'cause I like to give head like a zombie
Eat eat eat 'til her insides are on me
She loves me 'cause I give head like a zombie
Eat eat eat and nobody's gonna stop me

And in the glow of the pale moonlight
She goes for a spin on my haunted hayride

Tried out the living but I don't believe the hype
'Cause if she's got a pulse then she's not my type
If she's got a pulse then she's not my type

D-E-A-D
If she's got a pulse then she's not my type
