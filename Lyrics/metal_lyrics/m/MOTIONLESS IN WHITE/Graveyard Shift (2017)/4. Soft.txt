You're mine motherfucker

Let me begin with envy's a sin
You'll have to find new words to invent
'Cause I've heard your broken record and I'm not impressed

I love when you talk I just use it to drive me
I won't let your judgement define me
I'm not broken so don't fix me
I want you to hate me

Tell me what you've lost
Hang me on your cross
If you're so wise then why are you so soft
Do you leave your "throne" as you cast your stones
I'm above living under your microscope

Go!

You're mine motherfucker

I'm insane, I'm "insane in the membrane"
I wanna fuck your face with a switchblade
I'm not broken so don't fix me
I'll leave you behind me

Internet killed the video star
Internet kill the video star

Tell me what you've lost
Hang me on your cross
If you're so wise then why are you so soft
Do you leave your "throne" as you cast your stones
I'm above living under your microscope

Cry baby cry baby
Did I just hear you whimper
Cry baby cry
Suck my middle fucking finger

Cry baby cry baby
What have you done lately
Cry baby cry baby
What have you done

Tell me what you've lost
Demonize my flaws
Do they call you when dumb needs a mascot
Do you leave your "throne" as you cast your stones
I'm above living under your microscope

You dilate
God of your existence
Begging me to listen
While you "pray"

Swallow in vain
Silver-spoon religion
Closer from a distance

You're mine motherfucker

Cry baby cry baby
Cry baby cry baby

You're mine motherfucker
