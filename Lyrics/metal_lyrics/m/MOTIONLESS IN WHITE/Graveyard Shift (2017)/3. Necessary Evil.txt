[feat. Jonathan Davis of KoRn]Strip off the weight of morality
And check it at the door
I'll show you the worst in me
What I've become

Blow out the candles I need not a wish
For I am everything
Now crawl to my boots and lick
Kneel before me

I'mma have my cake and fucking eat you too

It's my party and I'll die when I want to
Die when I want to
Die when I want to

The monster you've made is wearing the crown
I'll be the king and you be the clown
I'll take the blame parade it around
You've made me the villain you can't live without

Reciting violence like poetry
No, you can't sit with us
Too fashionably plain
Now say my name

Forget everything you think you knew of who I used to be
I look much better asâas the enemy

I'mma have my fucking cake and eat yours too

It's my party and I'll die when I want to
Die when I want to
Die when I want to

The monster you've made is wearing the crown
I'll be the king and you be the clown
I'll take the blame parade it around
You've made me the villain you can't live without

I want you low
I won't let you die
I'll keep you alive
Just to remind you of what you are not

It's my party I'll die when I want to
You wanna see me fail but I won't die for you

It's my party and I'll die when I want to
Die when I want to
Die when I want to

The monster you've made is wearing the crown
I'll be the king and you be the clown

It's my party and I'll die when I want to
Die when I want to
Die when I want to

I want you low

I'mma have my cake and fucking eat you too
