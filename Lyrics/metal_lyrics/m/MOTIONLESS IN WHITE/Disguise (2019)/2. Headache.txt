Some days I'm narcissistic, some days I'm in my way
Some days I try to sleep with pins and needles in my brain
Some days I feel sadistic, a portrait of my pain
Some days I live in fear that I am every fucking thing I hate

Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up

Follow me down
Under the skin I am doubt
Feeding the flies in my mouth
Through my eyes
I know that I'm gonna be fine

Some days I feel addictive, some days I feel alone
Some days I fear the worst in me is the best you'll ever know
Some days I feel the static with everyone I know
Some days I feel like I just want to slit a motherfucker's throat

Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up

Follow me down
Under the skin I am doubt
Feeding the flies in my mouth
Through my eyes
I know that I'm gonna be fine
Swallow the pain
Selling my sorrow for shame
Sanity circles the drain
With a smile
I swear that I'm gonna be fine

I know that I'm gonna be fine
I know that I'm gonna be fine
I know that I'm gonna be fine
Oh God, am I gonna be fine?
Bright lights, am I dead or alive?
Someone say I'm not losing my mind
I made a deal with the devil inside
Oh God, I'm gonna be fine

(Go!) Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
(Go!) Shut up, shut up, shut up
(Go!) Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
(Go!) Shut up, shut up, shut up

Decay and follow me down
Under the skin I am doubt
Feeding the flies in my mouth
Through my eyes
I know that I'm gonna be fine
Swallow the pain
Selling my sorrow for shame
Sanity circles the drain
With a smile
I swear that I'm gonna be fine
