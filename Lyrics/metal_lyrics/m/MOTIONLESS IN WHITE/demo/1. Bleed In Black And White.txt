I'm running red lights, swear the stars,
Are putting circles in my mind.
A thousand miles to the white light,
To the glow of my head lights.

Keep driving, drive until we reach the end.
Now's the last time (Until we crash this car)
And still I hoped and prayed,
With blood in my blackened heart.
Keep driving until we hit this tree.

Before the snakes and fireflies,
I saw my life flash before my eyes.
(Broken glass from this broken windshield)
And I looked up at the rainy night,
The fires burn, the tires slide.

Now we're heading for a bridge,
While at the wheel, I fell asleep,
A thousand miles, but it's alright,
'Cause you're sitting next to me.

Sometimes I feel that I'd be better off dead,
Now's the last last time. (Keep driving)
We're bleeding black and white,
Feel the fire in your eyes.
Now's the last time I'll ever see your face again.

Before the snakes and fireflies,
I saw my life flash before my eyes.
(Broken glass from this broken windshield)
And I looked up at the rainy night,
The fires burn, the tires slide.

I'm stuck between my seatbelt,
When crushed against the window.
I'll leave my body here tonight,
I'll bleed in black and white.

So fade away,
Fade to one line,
In my short life.
