I don't even go see outside the ground and find the feeling that's inside me,
Forever calm and faceless love,
Please don't take this life from me.
I've got my head above the water while,
Shining in disaster, I'll rewind to the kiss goodnight so,
Your lips can kill me faster.
I don't even go see outside the ground and find that shit you never told me,
Your eyes caught in the shadows of dreaming while he sleeps.
I've lost all my only answers in one last dead romantic,
Your words they feel like weapons as the cuts sting to the bone.

Woah, I never said this would be easy to hold on,
But I'm not gonna let it go,
And when you cry yourself to sleep tonight,
Don't forget that it's killing me not to tear you apart.

The roses are red, violets are blue,
The petals fall like tears.
Your pictures worth a thousand words,
So light it up and watch it burn. (Ash to ash, dust to dust)
Strike a match, incinerate, feel the flames upon your face.

Woah, I never said this would be easy to hold on,
But I'm not gonna let it go,
And when you cry yourself to sleep tonight,
Don't forget that it's killing me not to tear you apart.
