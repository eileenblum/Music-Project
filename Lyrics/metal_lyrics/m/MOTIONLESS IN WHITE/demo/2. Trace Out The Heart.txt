This love I sealed it with a kiss
Nothing was supposed to feel
Quite like this

More brilliant words were never said
They make me want to snap your neck
This is just a test

My heart is a time bomb
Only seconds to go
Self-destructing as my chest explodes

Heart is a time bomb
And i thought you should know
Your killing me quickly
But it feels so slow

I'll put my bite marks on your neck
But thats nothing to the razors on
On your lips

So come on gorgeous kiss my wrists
I'll bleed until my blood runs out
And you ripped into my....

My heart is a time bomb
Only seconds to go
Self-destructing as my chest explodes

Heart is a time bomb
And I thought you should know
Your killing me quickly
But it feels so slow
So slow

My heart is a time bomb with only seconds to go
I'm getting ready, I'm ready 1 2 3 explode!

And this kiss, tastes like a hand grenade
The pin is, pulled out and thrown away

When my brain is scattered on your wall
Reminder, of what you did to me

My heart is a time bomb
Only seconds to go
Self-destructing as my chest explodes

Heart is a time bomb
And I thought you should know
Your killing me quickly
But it feels so slow

Screaming, I'm ready to..kill me
Lock and load
Go ahead, go ahead pull it back,
Fuckin kill me!

Inside my heart, I'm torn apart
It's black and white, theres red on the knife
What good will come of this?
Tonight you'll see a mirror grace my fist
