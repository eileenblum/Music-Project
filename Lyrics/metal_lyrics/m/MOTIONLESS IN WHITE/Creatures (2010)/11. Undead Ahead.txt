My love now where have you been?
She begs this night to just end
Tranquilize, fantasize
Until your heart caves in

Kill all the lights as midnight approaches
Tonight's the night my nightmares come to life
I must confess my final breath is heavy with the fog
He smiles back with his pumpkin grin.

At midnight he
Rides forth to the scene of battle
In nightly quest of his head, the pumpkin.
Eyesight moonlight this place is haunted
Sleepy Hollow, he follows.

I am the devil and I, I'm telling you to kill her 
So we can dance in death tonight
You cannot run you can't hide, sick screaming little whore, 
He's going to wrap you up real tight

This place is haunted, possession by a ghost
The headless horseman rides, at midnight
THIS PLACE IS HAUNTED!!

Tonight's the night of the living dead.
I know, I know. I knew it'd come to this
But we can't all be perfect.

Run quick, he cannot cross the bridge
Ichabod, Ichabod.

I am the devil and I, I'm telling you to kill her 
So we can dance in death tonight
You cannot run you can't hide, sick screaming little whore, 
He's going to wrap you up real tight

I am the devil and I (I am the devil), I'm telling you to kill her (telling you to kill)
I am the devil and I (I am the devil), I'm telling you to kill her (telling you to kill...)
YOU!!!
