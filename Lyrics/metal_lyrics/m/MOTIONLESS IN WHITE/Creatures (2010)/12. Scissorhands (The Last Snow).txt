MOVE!!!

Incomplete, alone and unfinished, my flaws in design are all I've become
I can feel myself wither away, the darkest of evils, this way will become
Isolation, mutilation as predicted this love has torn us apart
From temptation to damnation, my heart bars a distance that you can never comprehend

If you only knew how much I'd die just to hold you without my hands disguised
As the darkness approaches the light, I welcome the dead into my soul
And as vanity strikes with a vengeance to bury me under this 6 feet of snow
I've fallen in love

I'm a man with scissors for hands, I long for a love that I know I can't have
It's so sad, my heart in your hands, I melt like the snow in the part where you dance 
(the part where you dance)

I am immortal, as the look on your face when your walking away
Your pitiful, and the grip on my sanity's starting to sway 
(as the grip on my sanity's starting to sway)
Now come and take me away

I keep myself alive just to die more every day.
NO! I won't, I won't let you, I won't let you take this life from me,
I'm not sorry, you deserve everything that you get from this

Incomplete, alone and unfinished, my flaws in design are all I've become
I can feel myself wither away, the darkest of evils, this way will become
If you only knew how much I'd die just to hold you without my hands disguised

I'm a man with scissors for hands, I long for a love that I know I can't have
It's so sad, my heart in your hands, I melt like the snow in the part where you dance 
(the part where you dance)

I'm a man with scissors for hands (Scissorhands)
It's so sad, my heart in your hands, (Scissorhands)
(The part where you dance)
Something wicked this way comes.
Scissorhands.
