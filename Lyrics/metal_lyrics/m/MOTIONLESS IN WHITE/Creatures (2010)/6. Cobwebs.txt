How many years have passed me by?
Since I've stopped to take a look at all the changes in my life.
So many friends have come and gone.
But all those summer nights still burn inside my lungs.
I hope you will not forget this either.
Forever.

And I bet I'm not the only one who thinks.
I'm stuck in the past with all the friends I am losing.
I regret not holding onto more closely.
The past it the past, and I'm letting it kill me.

If I just had one wish I'll tell you what it'd be.
I'd bring back all the bands inside the dome.
And one last time have a fucking show.
Life is what you make it, what you make it and I believe in this.
What happened to the familiar faces that I've come to miss.

And I bet I'm not the only one who thinks.
I'm stuck in the past with all the friends I am losing.
I regret not holding onto more closely.
The past is the past, and I'm letting it kill me.

This sinking ship can't hold much water.
How much longer? 
How much longer?
Until these lights are dead and gone.
I will scatter the ashes of what's left of this place that I call home.

And I will scatter the ashes of what's left of this life this place that I call home
And to fight this fatal attraction, 
Just to sit inside and hang my head too low.

Living in the shadows of the scars.
The past defines just who we are

And I bet I'm not the only one who thinks.
I'm stuck in the past with all the friends I am losing.
I regret not holding onto more closely.
The past is the past and I'm letting it kill me. 
The past lives.
