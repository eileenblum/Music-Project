I've died one million times now I'm buried in the pavement.
Lying face down, everything went black before I even closed my eyes
And you will never know what hate is
To feel your insides burn away and want to end your life to numb the fucking pain

So let the first snow fall
And bury me under 6 feet of regret
You've got your trophy now leave me to my hate with no regrets
I am the deepest shade of Jaded
This is a love song, a threnody for these years of worthless waste
And now my hatred's all I fucking have left

I've never had the words to say, but I can quote them all
I am human and I need to be loved just like everybody else does
So Morrissey please sing me to sleep (sing me to sleep)
As I live and breathe you have killed me, you have killed me

I'm not your puppet, so cut the strings and free me from your hands
Get fucking over me
MOVE!
My fucking pain is my paycheck
Get fucking over me!

This is where it all begins
Two EP's and a full length later and I still can't let go of you

I've never had the words to say, but I can quote them all
I am human and I need to be loved just like everybody else does
So Morrissey please sing me to sleep (sing me to sleep)
As I live and breathe you have killed me, you have killed me

You've got your trophy now leave me to my hate with no regrets
I am the deepest shade of Jaded

Precision with incision is a tedious remark
With all the visions of submission of the fibers in your heart
Penetration validation for as sick as it may seem
Is all a morbid demonstration of what helps me to sleep

Fuck your pretty face!
FUCK YOUR PRETTY FACE!!!
I'm not your puppet!
