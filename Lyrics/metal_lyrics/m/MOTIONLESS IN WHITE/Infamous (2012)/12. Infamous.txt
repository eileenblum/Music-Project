Listen up now motherfuckers
And I donât give a single fuck if you like it or not
Your picture perfect enemey has become the anomaly
Yeah try all you want, but you wonât figure me out

Be careful what you wish for you might just get it
Set fire to your lungs and leave you choking on the ashes
Youâre wasting all the oxygen, blackballing but you canât stop falling
Then call me a fagot, stand up, now who looks more threatening?

I never asked to be model citizen for your decor
Even if you played the part I wouldnât fuck you for the score
So step up to the plate and take your best fucking shot
But it will never break the skin âcause I am something that youâre not, fool
I donât care what you have to say, it makes no difference
Itâs all because of you, weâre fucking infamous

Iâm not looking for a savior, I have all that I need
And I donât give a single fuck if God likes it or not
Your picture perfect life you see, is quite so fucking disgusting
I put all my faith in your âone two threeâ
Now Iâm your model citizen, nail me to a cross
Crucify me for my sins, and let my body rot

I never asked to be model citizen for your decor
Even if you played the part I wouldnât fuck you for the score
So step up to the plate and take your best fucking shot
But it will never break the skin âcause I am something that youâre not, fool
I donât care what you have to say, it makes no difference
Itâs all because of you, weâre fucking infamous

Now Iâm your model citizen, nail me to a cross
Crucify me for my sins, and let my body rot
I said this before and now Iâll say it again
Open your mind before you mouth and âget the fuck out of my wayâ

I donât care what you have to say, it makes no difference
Itâs all because of you, weâre fucking infamous
Weâre fucking infamous
Weâre fucking infamous
