I was the last choice, no voice, regular kid
Just livinâ out each day and layinâ low on the grid
But then I looked at myself, and saw that I wanted more
So I assembled my troops and I stood up to the world

I will defend that, we are the vanquished, and you will not make our decisions
I wonât pretend that, Iâm not a victim of a world that will not listen
We will rise.

Now Iâm the full grown man that you love to hate
And yeah you doubted me, but now Iâm laughing in your face
Youâre hoping I fail, but youâre just pressing your luck
âCause the one best part of me is I donât give aâ¦HAH HAH

I will defend that, we are the vanquished, and you will not make our decisions
I wonât pretend that, Iâm not a victim of a world that will not listen
They will fall, Nothing that I canât overcome
Conquer the battles one by one, crushing the head of whatâs become
Iâm screaming at the top of my lungs

Through all the struggles I face, And through the pain I embrace
Now Iâve become something more than you
You think youâre stronger than me, You think I fight for the weak
But we are 10 times the strength of you
I will not fall, I will fight to survive and keep this alive
We will rise without fail, Find the strength to survive and keep this alive
We will rise.

I will defend that, we are the vanquished, and you will not make our decisions
I wonât pretend that, Iâm not a victim of a world that will not listen
They will fall, Nothing that I canât overcome
Conquer the battles one by one, crushing the head of whatâs become
Iâm screaming at the top of my lungs
