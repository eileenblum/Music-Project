Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who s the ugliest of them all?
Severed, crawling like spiders
Injecting poison

Now kill the bile spewing
The walking selfish living dead
I turn to rust and you play in all the filth that you've created
No love, no loss in the wake of your stupidity
Show me where s your dedication

And when your dreams have come to end
How will you buy your happiness?
And when yourself is all you have left
With what will you fill your emptiness?

You are the cause of mans dissolving evolution
Is my heart completely useless?
Devoid the fake with full disdain
What when your life is worthless
I don t think you ll fit the frame

Fuck you, fuck this
Everything is distress
I don t give a shit if your ego is maniacal

I just want to watch you fucking die motherfucker!

I have come to crush you
And bring you all to your fucking knees
You are not fucking angels
And much less fucking kings
What have you sacrificed, preserving what you love?
You re just a hollow shell infecting who you fuck!

I just want to watch you fucking die
Motherfucker!

And when your dreams have come to end
How will you buy your happiness?
And when yourself is all you have left
With what will you fill your emptiness?
