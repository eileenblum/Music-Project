We take medication to be someone else
And we take off our clothes to pay for the bills
Where downloading content will buy you a sentence
And murder is free in the Hollywood hills

And I'm living one big nightmare, the ugly truth has a model face
Making saints out of useless pop stars
Where's the intelligence?

A-M-E-R-I-C-A
Home of the free, the sick and deprived
A-M-E-R-I-C-A
So why the fuck are you looking at me?

Oil prices are so high we can't feed ourselves
So we buy into fast food and occupy the will
We upload our status and beg for attention
While they're all eating cake up on Capital Hill

Still live in one big nightmare
God save the human race
Handing convicts fame in HD
Glorified ignorance

A-M-E-R-I-C-A
Home of the free, the sick and deprived
A-M-E-R-I-C-A
So why the fuck are you looking at me?

A-M-E-R-I-C-A
Home of the free, the sick and deprived
A-M-E-R-I-C-A
So why the fuck are you looking at me?

A-M-E-R-I-C-A
Home of the free, the sick and deprived
A-M-E-R-I-C-A
So why the fuck are you looking at me?
