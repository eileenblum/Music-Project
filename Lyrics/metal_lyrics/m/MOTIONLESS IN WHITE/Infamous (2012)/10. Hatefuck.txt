I am an architect of difference, you are just a hole
Oh how I love to hear you beckon and stripped to the bone
But when I come around I come inside and just leave
Because if I had a heart I wouldn't wear it on my fucking sleeve

You know you love it when we "oh oh oh"
I want it dirty, with the lights on, filthy, vile, and obscene
I wanna show you what a bitch I can be

You are an architect of ignorance, with nothing for a soul
Now I'm the only thing inside of you, that you cannot control
And when I'm through with you I'll just move on to the next
Because I packaged it with love but I just used you for theâ¦breath

You know you love it when we "oh oh oh"
I want it dirty, with the lights on, filthy, vile, and obscene
I wanna show you what a bitch I can be

Hate fuck, hate fuck,
My little hate fuck, my little hate fuck
Hate fuck, hate fuck,
My little hate fuck, my little hate fuck

I am an architect of difference, you are just a hole
Now I'm the only thing inside of you, that you cannot control
And when I'm through with you I'll just move on to the next
Because I packaged it with love but I just used you for theâ¦

You know you love it when we "oh oh oh"
I want it dirty, with the lights on, filthy, vile, and obscene
I wanna show you what a bitch I can be

I fucking love it when we ugh ugh ugh
I want it dirty with the lights off, coming apart at the seams
I want you to show me what a bitch you can be
