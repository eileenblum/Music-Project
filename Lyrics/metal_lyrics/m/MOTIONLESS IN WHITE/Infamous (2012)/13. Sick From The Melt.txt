[Deluxe Edition Bonus Track][feat. Trevor Friedrich]I never cared you weren't for me
This edge is tried and true
I never cared for you to stop
I've watched you play the fool

You're always one to disagree
Only love for what's prescribed
It's such a game to you
This is your fucking life

Wasting away just for the craving
A long for something else
Fading, your pictures on the floor will burn

I never wanted agony
Tragic waste of life
I only wanted you to see
There is no after life

There's no more hope for you
In this paradigm
No more love for you
I'll say this one more time

Wasting away just for the craving
A long for something else
Fading, your pictures on the floor will burn

She fell in love with herself
She fell in love with her distance from life
Sick from the melt
I can't forget her body shuddering

I never wanted agony
Tragic waste of life
I only wanted you to see
There is no after life

Wasting away just for the craving
A long for something else
Fading, your pictures on the floor will burn

I won't watch you burn
I won't watch you burn
