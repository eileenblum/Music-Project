I want to hurt you,
I don't deserve you
Unlace your body,
I want total control

Like maggots from the host,
You drain, I decompose
Swallow your faith, submit
And fuck until we overdose

You said this was "the last time" over and over again

The closer I get is the further I feel
(Blind eyes)
And I am losing my grip on remembering what's real
(Hands tied)

'Cause our synthetic love is all that we know
My head is a mess, and it's going to explode

I want to watch you,
Expose and drill through
Inject the poison,
I have lost all control

Crawling inside of you,
The fruit of the flesh is bruised
Swallow the pain, relive
And fuck until we feel like new

You said this was "the last time" over and over again

The closer I get is the further I feel
(Blind eyes)
And I am losing my grip on remembering what's real
(Hands tied)

'Cause our synthetic love is all that we know
My head is a mess, and it's going to explode

We lost our heads and minds explode
I don't want trust in losing control
I'm just a slave to how this feels
But, baby, please don't believe this is "real"

I wrap my hands around your throat
Bury your face, remove all your clothes
We're both just slaves that can't refuse
And everything that we have loved in the end we will lose

The closer I get is the further I feel
(Blind eyes)
And I am losing my grip on remembering what's real
(Hands tied)

'Cause our synthetic love is all that we know
My head is a mess, and it's going to explode
