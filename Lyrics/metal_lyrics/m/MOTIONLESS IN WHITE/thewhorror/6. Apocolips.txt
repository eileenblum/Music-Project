["The Whorror" Version]This is the story of a girl who sits in the dark room,
Wondering what's to become of her.
Her makeup is smeared and blood fills her dark heart,
The addiction is slowly sinking in.

With bloodshot eyes, she starts hallucinating,
The track marks fading from her arms.
She's as white as the snowfall,
And she's clung to the ceiling.

Dancing dirty needles broke the tip off in her skin,
The promises and false hopes are injected in her veins.

It's almost Armageddon as she falls to the floor,
Guilt straight affliction, now comatose.
Emptiness, (In her head)
She feels the room spin, (She forgets)
Somebody call a doctor, (Her reason)
We need an ambulance. (For living)

Trapped in this black hole, (Never killed the beauty queen)
Abandoned, alone. (Never killed the beauty queen)
And I'm here for you.
I am so sick, I am so sick.
I am so fucking sick of this.

The roses are red, violets are blue,
These petals fall like tears.

The petals fall...
Her pictures worth a thousand words, 
So light it up and watch it burn,
(Ash to ash, lust to dust)
Strike a match, incinerate, feel the flames of suffering.

Dancing dirty needles broke the tip off in her skin,
The promises and false hopes are injected in her veins.

It's almost Armageddon as she falls to the floor,
Guilt straight affliction, now comatose.
Emptiness, (In her head)
She feels the room spin, (She forgets)
Somebody call a doctor, (Her reason)
We need an ambulance. (For living)

Sick, as she smiles,
One last goodbye, this girl she cried so hard.
Broken bones, but I can't help her,
She's too far gone, (Apocolips) she soon will die.

This love, (This love)
This love. (This love)
This love and I can't let her go for her, my body and soul.
This love, (This love)
This love. (This love)
This love and I can't let her go for her, my body and soul.
