Oh, shit!

Get down, get loud.
Turn the radio up,
You're invited to a graveyard party tonight.
Punk is heavy and the moon is full,
Dead never looked so beautiful.

Gonna dance all night ('til the sun comes up)
'Cause we're all dead (we don't give a fuck)
So spin your partner round, dosey do,
'Cause this is a zombie rodeo.

Frankenstein is about to wreck the gate.
Wolfman is about to eat his teen.
The fire's scratching down in The Mummy's tomb.
Has Dracula spiked the punch with blood?

We put the fun in 'Funeral'.

Coffin kiss,
From that which you can not escape.
Misery,
Another reason to guard the gate.

What happened to the life of the party?
Ha ha, get it? We're all dead!
Now everybody's passed out, face down.
The sun is rising and the fire has faded away,
And even if we have to move it to the next town,
We're gonna rock it, this week anyway.
D-I-E... We won't be dead forever.

Fuck yeah!
