Go!
Your lips and skin, they taste of sin.

You've got my back against the wall,
You've got my hands around your throat.
Now watch the blood drip down your mouth.
You said let's dance.
(Begging for mercy, but nobody heard me)
(I so tried to stop this, but just couldn't help it)
Yeah!

Got you right now, on your way out.

The only sin in our lives is to not ever have one.
So let's sin, sin, sin.
The only sin in our lives is to not ever have one.
So let's sin.

You've got my back against the wall,
You've got my hands around your throat.
Now watch the blood drip down your mouth.
You said let's dance.
(Begging for mercy, but nobody heard me)
(I so tried to stop this, but just couldn't help it)

You've got your back against the wall, (Let's kiss, the taste)
You've got my hands around... (Of sin)
You've got my back against the wall, (Now take away something which you love so much)
You've got my hands around... (Again, again)

(Step 1)
The silence that your screaming,
(Step 2)
As I'm tearing out your tongue.
This'll be the last time, last time,
That we ever play this game.
(Step 3)
Feast upon your insides,
(Step 4)
Drain the blood out from your veins.
Fuck your torn through, lifeless body,
One last time.

The only sin in our lives is to not ever have one.
So let's sin, sin, sin.
The only sin in our lives is to not ever have one.
So let's... Let's sin.
The only sin in our lives is to not ever have one.
So let's sin, sin, sin. (Sin!)
The only sin in our lives is to not ever have one.
Sin, sin, sin.
