Paralyzed... by the envy of the night... 
I am lost without you here.
And outside it looks like rain, 
Say goodbye for the last time.
For the last time I'll bleed myself dry tonight.
We are all alone.
And nothing I could ever write would help you understand this life.
There's so much beauty when scarlet eyes lay lost in all the city lights.
The wax will drip as so as blood, 
Romance is dead and all is lust.
Your are the water in my lungs, we've lost it... 

And nothing I could ever write would help you understand this life.
There's so much beauty when scarlet eyes lay lost in all the city lights.
The wax will drip as so as blood, 
Romance is dead and all is lust.
Your are the water in my lungs, we've lost it now!
