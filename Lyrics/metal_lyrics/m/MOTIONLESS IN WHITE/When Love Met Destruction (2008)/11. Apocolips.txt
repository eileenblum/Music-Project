This is the story of a girl who sits in the dark room, 
wondering what's to become of her. 
Her makeup is smeared and blood fills her dark heart, 
the addiction is slowly sinking in. 

With bloodshot eyes, she starts hallucinating 
the track marks fading from her arms. 
She's as white as the snowfall, 
and she's clung to the ceiling. 

It's almost Armageddon as she falls to the floor, 
guilt straight affliction, now comatose. 
Emptiness, she feels the room spin, 
somebody call a doctor, we need an ambulance 

She smiles, this girl cried so hard 
She smiles, this girl cried so hard 

Her lipstick is all we have, is all we have of what she left behind
Her lipstick is all we have, is all we have of what she left behind

Her lipstick is all we have, is all we have of what she hid behind. 
Her lipstick is all we have, is all we have of what she left...

"There on the floor highlighted in red lied a girl. 
Her possession of immortal beauty brought the sincerest form of irony 
to this seemingly tragic display of lust verses love. 
It was black on black on black 
and such a shame that she could not resist 
keeping the only hint of red strictly to her fingernails"

It's almost Armageddon as she falls to the floor, 
guilt straight affliction, now comatose. 
Emptiness, she feels the room spin, 
somebody call a doctor, we need an ambulance 
we need an ambulance
we need an ambulance 

Sick as she smiles
One last goodbye this girl she cried so hard
Broken bones but I can't help her
She's too far gone, apocolips, she soon will die.

This love (this love)
This love (this love)
This love and I can't let her go for my body and soul

This love (this love)
This love (this love)
This love and I can't let her go for my body and soul
