The sun is silent in this place (the sun is silent), 
throw these hopes into the flames (and throw these hopes into the flames).
Place these dreams in the palm of your hands and crush them.
And crush them.
And crush them to dust.
And crush them.

I'm reaching out to a hand that no longer extends.
Letting go has never been my thing.
Letting go has never been my thing.

Lets wave one last goodbye (wave goodbye),
to this nightmare that we once knew.
Lets wave one last goodbye (wave goodbye),
to this nightmare that we once knew.
We once knew.
We once knew.  

This is a...
This is a... tragedy.
Tragedy.
This is a...
This is a tragedy.

And I fear that we are all doomed.

No one will make it out alive.
No one will make it out alive.
No one will make it out alive.
No one will make it out alive.
No one will make it out alive.
No one will make it out alive.
No one will make it out alive.
No one will make it out alive.
No one will make it out alive.

I fear that,
that we are all doomed.
We are forsaken in the eyes of the truth.
