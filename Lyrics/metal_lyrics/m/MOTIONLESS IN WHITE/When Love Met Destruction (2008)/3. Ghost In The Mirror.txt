Ghost in the mirror. 
Just look beyond, the balanced reflection. 

So tell me dear, can your heart still break 
if it's already stopped beating? 

Never take your pulse for granted again, 
she doesn't know the kiss of death. 
Black is black and love is, love is death. 
Black cats, Black hearts, the wicked never rest. 
I curse the day I let you in. 

Everyday is a funeral. 
I'm not afraid of being alone, I'm just afraid of being vulnerable. 

Ghost in the mirror, I curse the day that I let you in. 

This is horror, 
This is sin, 
We are evil, 
We are death
