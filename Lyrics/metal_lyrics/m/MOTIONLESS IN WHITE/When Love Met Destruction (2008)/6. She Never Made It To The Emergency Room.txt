If I cut off my hand and gave it to you, would you hold it then?
Tie me to the bed and put a knife to my neck,
'Cause tonight we'll let it out.
Covered in blood, all her skeletons in closets will dance to the sound of lust. 
Metal wrists break the urge to resist and fight this hatred 
that presses so hard against my lips.

She whispers in his ear, 
please darling don't be scared. 
I want you to bleed with me. 
(A brilliant suicide from you is all I want)
and we'll fall into the sea.

Against the wall, 
I will sink my teeth into your throat 
And rip it out.
And rip it out.

Inject these sins, 
the serpent speaks, 
for the devil awaits you and me.

She whispers in his ear, 
please darling don't be scared. 
I want you to bleed with me.
(A brilliant suicide from you is all I want)
and we'll fall into the sea.

My heart is a time bomb,
with only seconds to go.
Self-destructing, my chest explodes.

My heart is a time bomb
And I thought that you should know
You're killing me quickly but it feels so slow.

Explode.

The sound of screaming is like music to my ears.
The sound of screaming is like music,
to my ears.
