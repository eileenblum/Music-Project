This is what happens when love meets destruction. We'll watch the hourglass end, your time is up. And I hope the guilt consumes you. You're so fucking fake, that even the teeth you lie through are false. This is my life work, (but still) eleven tracks is not enough, to tell you how I've died inside. Love is lost like words, eleven tracks is not enough. This is what happened when love Met destruction. Life for life. If I die before I wake, you'll have your fucking soul to take
