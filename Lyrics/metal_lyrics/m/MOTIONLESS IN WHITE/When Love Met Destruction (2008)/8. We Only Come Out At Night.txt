["When Love Met Destruction" Version]Paint your face, tonight we terrorize this town, 
coffin case, we gather, our time is now. 
Ten Thirty-one, we roam the streets in thirst for blood, 
It all begins, all begins with you, with your life
We are the children of the night 
and we are rising from the grave. 
To haunt you in your sleep 
and drink you from your neck. 
We only come out at night
