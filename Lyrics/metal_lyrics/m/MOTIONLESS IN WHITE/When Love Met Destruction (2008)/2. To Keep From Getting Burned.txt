No amount of words will ever express my utter disgust at that fact that you're still alive, at the fact that you still breath. If I had one chance to do anything i could to you, i'de watch you suffer as you beg for help. You don't deserve to live the rest of your life as you are, you are worthless, a fucking cheap cigar. Everything that you ever loved will be taken away, the moment you shut your eyes, of all the things you've ever done, the worst was in the past few months, it's hard to keep from getting burned, when love is like fire. I've learned to make friends with fire, to keep from getting burned. I only had one heart to give, and you only had one heart to take, and I wish this plague upon both your houses, so that I may rest in peace tonight, and as I put my ear to yor mouth to hear your one last dying breath of words, I whispered back be still my dear for this will only hurt a second, but not even hell would forgive me for what I'm about to do to you. Love will kill us all
