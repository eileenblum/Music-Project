When I look in the mirror 
I know not who I see 
it's hopeless, I'm Hopeless 
but I'm not sorry for what that I've done, 
they had it coming, we all die someday. 

I do what the voices tell me to do. 

It's always easier to kill 
when your already dead inside, 
lock me up 
cause I've lost my fucking mind. 

Rock back and forth, it kills me, it thrills me. 
Rock back and forth, to see you dead. 

Destroying everything 
I'm bathing in your blood. 
(Destroy everything, destroy everything)
And when you try 
there will be no one to hear you scream, 
reach out to me. 

When I killed them all 
they begged for life but I took it away. 
Now here I am 
scratching all the paint off the walls again. 

The rain is a welcoming promise 
that tomorrow will be worse. 
Than today and forever 
we'll sing forever. 

Please give me something to believe in, 
I feel as if my minds slipping, 
I can't help feeling my life's going to end. 

Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god what the fuck have I done?
