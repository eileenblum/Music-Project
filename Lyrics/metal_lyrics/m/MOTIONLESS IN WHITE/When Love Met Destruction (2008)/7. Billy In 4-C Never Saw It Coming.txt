Oh my god, I could barely sit down to write this line,
And I'd give anything to hear your fucking voice again.
So apathetic and I know you must be dead inside,
You don't know what real love is.

And I will paint the darkness on,
Everything that reminds me of you,
And I haven't slept in days,
For I might not wake up.
And you say that passion kills?
Bitch, oh.

And I forgot what this hallow pit in my stomach felt like.

And I forgot what this hallow pit in my stomach felt like.
Now I have become death, destroyer of whole worlds.
Now I have become death, destroyer of whole worlds.

Now I have become my death,
Now I have become my death.

You are all that I have left,
And I am lost without you.
You are all that I have left,
And I am lost without you.
Your bloods not worth spilling.
Your bloods not worth spilling.


[2008 Version Only:]

[Whispered]
Never forgiving, there'll be no redemptions.
I'm giving up, those memories that are closest to heart.
You'll never ever be able to hurt me ever again,
One day, you'll be just a memory now, (A memory now)
Forever does not belong to us, (Never forgiving) 
I'm defeated, as I feel like forever;
Day to day, (Never forgiving)
Year to year, (As I whisper to you right now)
(Never forgiving)
My heart hits the floor,
(Never forgiving)
I just regret one thing...
