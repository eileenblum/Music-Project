[Bonus Track]The wall that I have built to keep you out is starting to rust,
Because everything around me just reminds me of us,
I am an addict for dramatics, black hair and pale skin,
Yet I'm still collecting bones, but that's why closets are for skeletons,
Undress your body, hold it over my head, 
Because you know that if you knock then I will always let you in,
I've been numb for so long that I forgot how to feel,
So I don't care if it will break my heart, just fuck me till we disappear,
You never said you'd hurt me,
Now this is all that we have left,
You were supposed to save me from myself, 
The wall that I have to keep you out has crumbled to dust, 
And I hope that every thing you see reminds you of us,
I've been gone for so long that I forgot what is real,
So I don't care if I will miss you, please just fuck me till we disappear,
You never said you'd hurt me,
Now this is all that we have left,
You were supposed to save me from myself, 
You said you'd never love me,
But look how hard someone can fall,
I was supposed to save you from yourself, 
Now the sky is on fire and we lie wide awake,
There is no other way than to make this mistake,
We can't control who we hurt, so we fuck the pain away,
So put all your pride, all your guilt into me,
And suck the breath from my lungs, I'll swallow your hate,
We can't control how we hurt, so we fuck the pain away.
