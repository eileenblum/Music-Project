I've got the best
It'll get you high
High as a vulture
parading the sky
I am the hit you need
Starving for attention, you will say anything
I see the users looking for their fixes
Willing to die to feed the addiction
Well if I take the pain away, you'll come back for more some day
I'm here to sell, I'm not here to buy
I'm here to sell my little white lies
Just do it, do it, do it
One more line
Just do it, do it, do it
God for the weak
What else do you need?
I found a way to feed the rich and the poor
I feed 'em all and watch 'em die on the floor
Where is the truth you seek?
Starving for attention you'll believe anything
