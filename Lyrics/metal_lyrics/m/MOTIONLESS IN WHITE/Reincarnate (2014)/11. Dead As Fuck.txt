I put my hearse in reverse, gonna go for a drive
Up to cemetary, get inside
I could smell her perfume got her blood in a vile
Now we're gonna dig, gonna be here a while yeah!
Two hours in, see her skin, threw the shovel aside
Pulled her from the dirt, caught a look in her eye
She's got worms in her mouth, spider webs in her hair
Yeah she may be fucking dead, but I don't care
DEAD she's my graveyard baby
DEAD she's my horror queen
Bride of Frankenstein, I'll make you come alive
Oh won't you please be mine?
DEAD she never tricks, she only treats
She was cold to the bone, open wounds on her flesh
Stitches are for bitches, body bag for a dress
I poured her a shot, she threw it back real quick
Now she's goin' to town, with her lips on my boomstick
Lips on my boom stick
She never tricks, she only treats
There's nothing she won't do for me
And then she did a little twist, it went just like this
