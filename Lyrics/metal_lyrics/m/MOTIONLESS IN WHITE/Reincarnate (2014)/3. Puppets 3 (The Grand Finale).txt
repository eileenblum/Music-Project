[feat. Dani Filth Of Cradle Of Filth]A graven, barren, broken tomb
Resides where once delicate orchids bloomed
No revocation for the damned
Cursed temptations ground to sand
Like a scornful, lustful breed
Dehumanizing virtue for your novelty
Serenade with a swollen tongue
Let no elegy be sung
I am the deep shade of jaded
Will I burn down your fortress of lies?
Six fucking years I have waited
To fucking cut you out of my life
No turning back

Iâve finally let you go and left the past to die
This is my resignation from
All that weâve loved and left behind
Now Iâll leave it behind

A portrait of torture we paint
Beguiling allure whilst adorned in lace
Eternally the porcelain cracks
A fatal passion forged in black
Like a creature of oddity
A captivating vessel of aesthetic beauty
Dressed in blood to provoke collapse
A fatal heart preserved in wax

Iâve finally let you go and left the past to die
This is my resignation from
All that weâve loved and left behind
In the grave you dug for me
A frame of bones reside
The flesh has burnt to embers
My muse, this is my last goodbye

Spit you out
Your beauty is bullshit
I was just a corpse you saw fit to drag around
Now your hold on meâs broken
But heaven knows Iâm miserable now
No longer your ashtray
To dispose of inside
Fuck your pretty face
This is finally goodbye
I am not your fucking puppet

Iâve finally let you go and left the past to die
This is my resignation from
All that weâve loved and left behind
In the grave you dug for me
A frame of bones reside
Six years Iâve pissed away
It ends right here - youâre dead to me
Goodbye
