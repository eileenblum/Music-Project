Through all that I've sacrificed
I'm numb but alive so how much more do I have to bleed
No fear
I am the name that's under your breath
White teeth in the dark, the voice in your head
(I) Embrace what's killing me

I will justify this pain
I will live another day
I will fight to earn my place
I will be unstoppable
Strength inside my veins
As I try to break these chains
Only honor will remain
We will be unstoppable

Through darkness I've seen the light
Tear down the walls and put me out of your misery
I know that I am the lie that keeps you divine
Sworn to the revery
I will smash my enemies
You wanted a war, you got one motherfucker
So bring the pain
You wanted a war, you got one
