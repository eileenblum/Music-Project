[feat. Maria Brink of In This Moment]In darkness, you're all around me
I know our future, I feel your body

What if I told you that I planned this?
What if I want to lose control?
What if I take the blame and become the drug
And dissolve as you swallow?

Covered in your silhouette
Elated for your bitter end
Don't hide the shame from our lips
Glowing in amber, burn in sin

Against the wall, we fall from grace
The pain we love is taking shape
A burning lust to touch the flame
Over and over again

We've played this role a thousand times
The same old script, just different lies
You disappear without a trace
Concealing the crimes on your face

Beneath all the pleasure, all you are is pain
And you deserve every second of your suffering
But yet I can't stop crawling to your doorstep
Every time you beckon
I'm self-destructing, trust in nothing
Save me

You burn like a cigarette
I took my time to suck you in
So take me out of my head
And spread your ashes on my skin

Against the wall, we fall from grace
The pain we love is taking shape
A burning lust to touch the flame
Over and over again

We've played this role a thousand times
The same old script, just different lies
You disappear without a trace
Concealing the crimes on your face

Fall

Your skin like winter
I felt you shiver
I heard you whisper
But the pills were quicker

I watched you wither
I am the killer

Against the wall, we fall from grace
The pain we love is taking shape
A burning lust to touch the flame
Over and over again

We beg like dirt and flesh disarms
We built it up to fall apart
Even the honesty was fake
Concealing the crimes on your face
