No compromise as I fight to break the cycle
And bring an end to this suffering
I'm a shadow, a black out, a storm in the background
One man's whisper, is another's scream
Searching between all the lines
Forsaken, I walk the night alone
No sanctuary
No place for me to call my home
But it's time to break the cycle. Go!
Nothing in mind can replace where I have come from
Can someone tell me who the fuck I am?
Now I'm on my knees, try to drain this disease
Repair this machine with unsteady hands
Searching for truth in the knife
I've been the prey
Of my own mind
3 records later, still confined
Now I've become my own device
Of malice and of contemplation
To go back to expired time
I'll break through the silence and leave it behind
And I'm lost on the stage I've spent
Isolating from nameless faces
Reliving the same dead end
Break through the cycle I swore to condemn
The past is haunting me
Let go and set me free
Open the door to the unknown
