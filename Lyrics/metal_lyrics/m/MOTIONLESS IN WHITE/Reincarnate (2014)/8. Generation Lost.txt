Throw your hands in the air and start this shit
We are the name of the game putting "filth" on the map
The right side of the reason, the wrong side of the tracks
It's not for fame, or for gain (that) we've crawled out from the dirt
Cause I still can't fill my pockets with my name on your shirt
Yeah, we bleed, scream, and get up off of our knees
We ignite to excite, we're taking back the night
Generation lost
We don't sleep at night, we don't give a...
Generation lost
Make a fist and close your eyes (yeah)
Generation lost
We're here to stay cause we've had enough
Generation lost
Middle fingers in the sky
We are a beacon of hope, the dark side of the light
We always aim for the throat, we only come out at night
If you need bodies you should see my collection
You're selling copies but they're lacking in passion
And now we bleed the dream, so get up off your feet
We ignite to excite, throw your hands in the air and scream
Burn alive to save yourself
And terrorize like no one else will
I'm screaming out so when I'm dead
We'll live forever in their empty heads
Coast to coast I hear the masses calling
Get up now this is your final warning
Throw your hands in the air and start this shit
