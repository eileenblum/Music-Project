[feat. Tim Skold]I smell like victory
I taste like blood
I'd sacrifice all I've got for one more second
I'd give away all I own
Final dictvm
I'll destroy all I know for just a moment
Forgiving only to forget
Repent repent
It's all the same
Bow down to a god so your life is saved
Revenge revenge
This punishment
Served cold to a world of malevolence
Spreading your legs for master
Slit wrists you fuck and pray
I'll help you fall down with me
Scream the holy spirit's name
I smell like victory
I taste like blood
Final dictvm
This bitter journey cannot end without beginning
So let the ending come to me
Final dictvm
And with your gods down on their knees the crows still singing
Singing only to forget
