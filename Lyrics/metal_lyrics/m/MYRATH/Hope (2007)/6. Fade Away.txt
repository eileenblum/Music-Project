I can see no future I just see the end
The end of love and the beautiful world
We built together in late September
When we first met and fall in love

Do you remember? All the stars above
Do you remember? The burning love
We shared together for nights to remember
Never thinking of days to come

Since you were gone and waved one last good bye
Are you still mine, still mine? Will we ever meet again?
Before this love will be fading away

Uncertain future No one can stand
Left to wonder with meaningful words
Love for ever sweet and tender
Will light be still shining through

We shared together for nights to remember
Never thinking of days to come

Since you were gone and waved one last good bye
Are you still mine, still mine? Will we ever meet again?
Before this love will be fading away

Since you were gone and waved one last good by

Since you were gone and waved one last good by
Are you still mine, still mine? Will we ever meet again?
Before this love will be fading away

Memories of last moments that we spent together
Hoping they will last for ever
Never to fade, fade away
