Once... while I was walking
I saw an angel down on earth...
Taking... my fears away
He sang... some song from heaven
Love... nothing but love
Can break this spell of loneliness
He... told me his story
So cruel... but not so far

Faith is there inside you... now and forever
I'll be there beside you... here and wherever

Why do I have to cry every time I try to love... someone?
Why do I give up fighting every time my feelings overflow?

I believe in love yes I do and in all mankind
Love is not a crime to hide and there is joy to find
All we need is to try, to try to heal
Your bleeding, bleeding heart

Inside your heart they will be there... they will be there
So dare the seeds of hell that burn your life... that burn your life
Get down on your knees, and start to pray, and start to pray
God may shine on you and stop the pain
Stop the pain
