Confessed my faults, and seven sins
Washed my soul for good from all the pain
Finally free ... from all my fears
I can see the light ... once again

Paid all my dues now it's all done
The darkness of my soul, is blown away
No path to choose, no need to run
Getting out of the hole, I fly away

Confessed my faults, and seven sins
Washed my soul for good from all the pain
Finally free ... from all my fears
I can see the light ... once again
