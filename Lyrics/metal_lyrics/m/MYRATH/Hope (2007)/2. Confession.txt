Here I go, back for more
Walking the path of hell No More
Life runs through my veins
I hear the judgement frightening bells
Thought that you would be there
Holding my hand here after death
But, if life is unfair
Death's even worse in pain

Ah ah ah
Are you laughing up there?
Standing upon my lonely grave
Here's my soul I gave
As greatest proof that I'm your slave
7 sins I confess
Those sins that led me to my death
I can't stand anymore
Still feel the pain of my last breath

Wounds on my soul
Hurt more and more
Lost my way
Light fades away
Seems like it's
My judgement day
