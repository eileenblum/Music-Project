Walking in darkness all alone
With no place to call my home
Winds Whispering sad sorrows
silent cries uncertain tomorrows

No tears to cry, to ease my pain
No way to heel, I'm going insane
Will darkness be left forever behind?
Will light ever shine in heart and mind

Light shines from the skies
Blessing angel in disguise
Reaching across eternity,
Saving a man uncertainty

No tears to cry, to ease my pain
No way to heel, I'm going insane
Will darkness be left forever behind?
Will light ever shine in heart and mind

Ah ah ah

Leaving bitter memories behind
Thinking of better days hard to find
Believe in Life don't loose hope don't despair
Oh
Believe in love don't give up the love you share
Oh
