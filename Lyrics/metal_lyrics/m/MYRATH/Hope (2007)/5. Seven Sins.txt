Man of all my dreams please detain my tears and stop all my emotions
Slot and gluttony your two favourite sins to kill all my sensations
Man of all my fears, let me drop my tears and regain all my devotion

Hate and agony that's all I can feel but these sins are immortal
All those dirty lies, you told me with no shame
Anger, lust and pride, it's how you played the game [x2]

I feel strong emotion, deep as an ocean
Just for you
I feel strong emotion, deep as an ocean
Just for you
I feel sensation, love and passion
Made me blind
All the time we spent together
I knew you were the perfect sinner
I believe there is no need to cry
Don't hide your seven sins [x2]

All the time we spent together
I knew you were the perfect sinner
I believe there is no need to cry
I believe there is no need to hide
So please don't go.... Please don't go...... Please don't gooooh

OH OH OH
OH OH OH
