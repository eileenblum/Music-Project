I... lost my mind... got lost in the depth of your soul
No... one can know... how hard it's to get far from you
Amere... it's so amere... to get to admit that you don't care
Hate... only hate... can finally break this nightmare

Oh oh oh love to the last breath
Oh oh oh love to the last breath

If I could make you feel the pain that i got through
Will you regret...
If I could make you feel the things I felt for you
Will you regret...
Lost inside your eyes... lost inside your soul... I felt so low
Brought me down to my knees... Help! Don't you go away please
I feel so confused... I feel so abused... what shall I do
With this love that grow, while hate is all I know, at least it's all you show

Oh oh oh love to the last breath
Oh oh oh love to the last breath
