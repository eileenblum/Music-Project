Cry then maybe I might
Give you another try
Falling your tears glow
And then die
Die in the indifference of mine
Underneath you pain
I won't believe your lies
Enjoy your demise

It won't belong
Feel your blood in flames
Rather you will hide
In sorrow
I let you down
Better be alone
'Cause I know you're just worth of my despite

Try to make me change my mind
Barely hide your pain
Remember all those times
Those chances you've had

It won't belong
Feel your blood in flames
Rather you will hide
In sorrow
I let you down
Better be alone
'Cause I know you're just worth of my despite

Die prison of lies
I think it's time to go

Cry better keep your face and go
Because I believe you are alone
To try to do things right
Cry couldn't change the way things are
Because I believe you're trapped and you cannot let go
But wait here believe me I know
Your silence is the last goodbye
