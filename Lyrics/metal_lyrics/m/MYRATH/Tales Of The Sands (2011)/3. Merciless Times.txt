Somehow I came to realize
That life was more than just a game
Unconsciousness have ruled my life
'Til now I never had to care

It's time to grow time to react

Dreaming while my life carries on and I stay behind
ÙÙÙØ§ÙÙÙÙÙ ÙÙÙØ§Ø¹ÙÙÙÙ
Stay behind
ÙÙÙØ§ÙÙÙÙÙ ÙÙÙØ§Ø¹ÙÙÙÙ
I know now
That the time is not on my side and it runs I know
ÙÙÙØ§ÙÙÙÙÙ ÙÙÙØ§Ø¹ÙÙÙÙ
Yes it runs
ÙÙÙØ§ÙÙÙÙÙ ÙÙÙØ§Ø¹ÙÙÙÙ

Some things for sure will come to change
I came across with too much pain
I pulled myself together again
I can't believe I cannot fail
I can't delay its time to start

Dreaming while my life carries on and I stay behind
ÙÙÙØ§ÙÙÙÙÙ ÙÙÙØ§Ø¹ÙÙÙÙ
Stay behind
ÙÙÙØ§ÙÙÙÙÙ ÙÙÙØ§Ø¹ÙÙÙÙ
I know now
That the time is not on my side and it runs I know
ÙÙÙØ§ÙÙÙÙÙ ÙÙÙØ§Ø¹ÙÙÙÙ
Yes it runs
ÙÙÙØ§ÙÙÙÙÙ ÙÙÙØ§Ø¹ÙÙÙÙ
