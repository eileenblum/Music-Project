Freeze the summer sun
Watch your words you know it hurts
Go walk out the door

I was close to die
From the pain inside
Wandering in the dark

Brought me down
Bleeding on my own
Fighting to survive

Breathing hardly now
I don't care I don't care
Seeds of hate have grown
Deep within my soul

Stop your lies

I was close to die
From the pain inside
Wandering in the dark

Brought me down
Bleeding on my own
Fighting to survive

I was close to die
From the pain inside
Wandering in the dark
Brought me down
Bleeding on my own
Fighting to survive [Ã2]

Stop your lies
Stop your lies
Stop your lies
