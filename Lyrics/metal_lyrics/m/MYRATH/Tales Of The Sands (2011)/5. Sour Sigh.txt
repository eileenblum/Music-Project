Breathe in and sigh
Wake up the beast I have inside
Dark thoughts of death run through my mind
Drums of wars marking the stars of the battle
I just don't feel the same

It's cruel and cold
A soldier in war
Striving to live
Losing control

Creeping down
Just crawling through the darkness
Falling to the silence
And gloom of my days

It's cruel and cold
A soldier in war
Striving to live
Losing control

Sometimes I try to know why I
Lost my mates and risked my life
Gave up on my dreams and hopes
Sometimes I wish I had more time
To heal, to heal my soul

It's cruel and cold
A soldier in war
Striving to live
Losing control
Am I
Just a pawn to sacrifice
Sometimes I try to know why I
Lost my mates and risked my life
Gave up on my dreams and hopes
Sometimes I wish I had more time
To heal, to heal my soul
