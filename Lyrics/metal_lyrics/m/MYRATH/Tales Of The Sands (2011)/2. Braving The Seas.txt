Sky trembles behind
Mourning clouds
And the weather is getting dire
On board, swindlers and crew
Singing loud
Some old sailor's songs
To lire

There you go
Cross the seas
And weather far
From your home
Fight for lore
And lust for gold
Scuttling towns and ships
Risking your life
Devil himself could not hold back your lust
Braving the seas, heavens and storms
Hard is the path of a pirate sire

Cursed and doomed by the gods
Free to hike
Follow only your
Desire
Now go skimming the shore
Swagging gold
Disappear into
Horizon

These you go
Cross the seas
And wander far
From your home
Fight for lore
And lust for gold
Scuttling towns and ships
Risking your life
Devil himself could not hold back your lust
Braving the seas, heavens and storms
Hard is the path of a pirate sire [Ã2]

Scuttling towns and ships
Risking your life
Devil himself could not hold back your lust
Braving the seas, heavens and storms
Hard is the path of a pirate sire
