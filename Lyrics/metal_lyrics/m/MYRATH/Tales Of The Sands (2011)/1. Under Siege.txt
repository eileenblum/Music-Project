Clouds of dust are rising to the sky
Legion marching all over the place
They omen doom
Death and decay
Run for your life now
If you want to survive

War has come
Bringing death
Lust and pain
Soiling our home

Mourns and cries
Kindle hate
Taint our hearts
Corrupt our souls

My shattered people will be mended now
I know that united we will fight
Brothers in arms
Free to the end
Rise up and fight now
If you want survive

[repeat Ã4]

War has come
Bringing death
Lust and pain
Soiling our home

Mourns and cries
Kindle hate
Taint our hearts
Corrupt our souls
