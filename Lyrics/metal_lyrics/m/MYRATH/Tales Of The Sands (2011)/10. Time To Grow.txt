Now
They say it's time to grow
Let your childhood go
Life won't give you your chance twice my son

Bring it on and fight
For what you think is right
Never fall to lust and pride
There's no doubt
You can make it on your own
You can make it on your own

I'm proud
Of what you are
You can make it on your own
You can make it on your own

Show
Mercy to the weak
Try to give a hand
What life has tore I'm sure you'll mend

Son
Be a better man
Than I've ever been
It's not hard just trust yourself I'm proud
There is no doubt
You can make it on your own
You can make it on your own

I'm proud
Of what you are
You can make it on your own
You can make it on your own

I'm proud
There is no doubt
You can make it on your own
You can make it on your own

I'm proud
Of what you are
You can make it on your own
You can make it on your own
