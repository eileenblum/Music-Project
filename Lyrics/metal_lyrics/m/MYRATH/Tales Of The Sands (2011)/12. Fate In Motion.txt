[Bonus Track]Nightmares and fears
Are Always in motion
Visions of you passing away
Scars of the past scrambles emotion
War Stripped you off out of my days

Within my hate, within my hate
I see no reason for such fate
Besides my pain, besides my pain
I carry on and walk away

Fading away, in the dark
Then she goes without a trace
Don't you leave, don't you leave me all alone
We used to say we'd never part
But I still long for that embrace
Don't you leave, don't you leave me all alone

Your brightening eyes
Marbled and closed
Witnessed your death I sighed
I've seen the harm war brought to us
Graves and mourning cries

Within my hate, within my hate
I see no reason for such fate
Besides my pain, besides my pain
I carry on and walk away

[x2]
Fading away, in the dark
Then she goes without a trace
Don't you leave, don't you leave me all alone
We used to say we'd never part
But I still long for that embrace
Don't you leave, don't you leave me all alone
