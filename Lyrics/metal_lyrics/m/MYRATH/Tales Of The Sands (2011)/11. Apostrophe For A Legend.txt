[Bonus Track]A new star is born
Shining while we sadly mourn

A new star is born
Shining while we sadly mourn
The legend is gone
Gone to rock for evermore

I'll walk your path
And stick to the tide
I'll keep my faith
In metal and myself
And will rock until I die

I'll call your name
And sound like thunder
I hear your voice
I see your face
Smiling on me
Shine now and for evermore

Hear my prayers
Gods of metal

By heavens I swear
By the everlasting moon
By the passion we share
By your presence gone too soon

Now I'll walk your path
And stick to the tide
I'll keep my faith
In metal and myself
And will rock until I die

I'll call your name
And sound like thunder
I hear your voice
I see your face
Smiling on me
Shine now and for evermore

Hear my prayers
Gods of metal

I'll call your name
And sound like thunder
I hear your voice
I see your face
Smiling on me

Shine now and for evermore
Shine now and for evermore
