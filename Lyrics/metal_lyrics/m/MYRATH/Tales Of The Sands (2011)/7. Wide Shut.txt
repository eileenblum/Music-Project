My eyes wide shut
Jumping in the void
Falling so fast
I touched the ground
Not a solution just an escape
I might awaken again
Oh
At least I have tried
Made all I can
Tried to fit the frame
Incorporate the game

I never could incorporate this frame
And I know
I can run
But never find the way out of here

Make up every lie
Even when you're right
Could not make it right
Give up who I am
Oh

I never could incorporate this frame
And I know
I can run
But never find the way

Oh

I never could incorporate this frame
And I know
I can run
But never find the way out of here
