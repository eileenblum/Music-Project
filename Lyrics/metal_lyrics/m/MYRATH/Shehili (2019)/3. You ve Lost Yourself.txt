I can't believe you've been my friend
By blazing my heart, you stole my light
Now I'm alone, you're gone away
I am so distraught by your lies

Don't know why you took my hand
Look what you've done, you will realize
I will never be the same
Then go ahead and let's say goodbye

My heartache cannot fade away
Don't want you to stay anyway, tonight

Now you've lost your soul
Can't forgive you after all
In the darkness of my heart
Yes you've lost yourself
And you made me someone else
I go mad thinking that I believed your lies (look into my eyes)

I know one day, you'll feel the pain
Of deceiving me, 'till the end of time
All along, I walked my way
Believe me or not, I've never cried

See you at the bitter end
So long, you, devil in disguise
We will never meet again
Then go ahead, let's say goodbye

My heartache cannot fade away
Don't want you to stay anyway, tonight

Now you've lost your soul
Can't forgive you after all
In the darkness of my heart
Yes you've lost yourself
And you made me someone else
I go mad thinking that I believed your lies (look into my eyes)

Time is running out, Like my blood
Time is running out
Like my blood flows in my veins

Now you've lost your soul
Can't forgive you after all
In the darkness of my heart
Yes you've lost yourself
And you made me someone else
I go mad thinking that I believed your lies (look into my eyes)
