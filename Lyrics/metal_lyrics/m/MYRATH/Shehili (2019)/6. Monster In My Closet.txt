I feel the wicked mist surrounds me now
I hold my breath and wait in fear and in sorrow
It crawls at night in the dark
Whispers pain into my mind

My guilty thoughts are going back and forth
To ripe the fruits of my madness to season
Monster in my closet
Consuming my soul alive

I will wait for the sun
To make my demons run
After they fed overnight
It's consuming my life
Burning deep in my soul
It will come back tonight

The pain is real, it's no more a fiction
It comes at night and wants my submission
I can feel that I'm loosing my sanity
I am longing for some peace and silence
I can feed it with my lust and vanity
I am sinking deep into the violence

I will wait for the sun
To make my demons run
After they fed overnight
It's consuming my life
Burning deep in my soul
It will come back tonight

I can feel that I'm loosing my sanity
I am longing for some peace and silence
I can feed it with my lust and vanity
I am sinking deep into the violence
