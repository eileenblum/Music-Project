Open your sail for me
Like a soul-searching, to flee
In all that silence, be free
I'd like you to hear my plea

My face in the hot dry wind
On and on, and on and on
I'll never be, ever misled again
On my way home

It's like a gale to me
Don't wanna lie, to me
Walking alone to the sea
It's my homeland that I need

My face in the hot dry wind
On and on, and on and on
I'll never be, ever misled again
On my way home, on my way home

Open your sail for me
I'd like you to hear my plea

My face in the hot dry wind
On and on, and on and on
I'll never be, ever misled again
On my way home
