Shadow cascading our soul
Bad blood to ravage us all

Wake up to see, the dead arise
Luring the weak to a dark demise
Dead souls, inside

Hopeless they steal the light
I just could feel their malice grow in time
Restless they roam to rule over the night
No time to run or flee
We write our destiny, tonight

Curse of war claiming our soul
Omens of hate damning all

Wake up to see, the dead arise
Luring the weak to a dark demise
Dead souls, inside (hearts returned to ice)

Hopeless they steal the light (we have to fight them to the end)
I just could feel their malice grow in time (we are there to remain)
Restless they roam to rule over the night
No time to run or flee
We write our destiny, tonight

Hopeless they steal the light (we have to fight them to the end)
I just could feel their malice grow in time (we are there to remain)
Restless they roam to rule over the night
No time to run or flee
We write our destiny, tonight
