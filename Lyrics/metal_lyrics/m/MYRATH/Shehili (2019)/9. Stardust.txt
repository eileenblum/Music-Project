The wind in the willows
Following your shadow
The people are silent here tonight
Oh I'm turning 'round and 'round
I've been roaming all along
Searching for the light

Stardust in the sky
It's you and I
You made me fear the dark
I let it be, let me go
Forever let it glowâ¦ Ignite
Close to the edge in the night

Stardust in the sky
It's you and I
You made me fear the dark
I let it be, let me go
But I don't want my life without your light
Come to the edge of the night

I'm mad, sunk in sorrow
I have no tomorrow
Alone on the silent hill, upright
Oh I'm fading away in time
Need to settle down my life
Standing strong or die

Stardust in the sky
It's you and I
You made me fear the dark
I let it be, let me go
Forever let it glowâ¦ Ignite
Close to the edge of the night

Stardust in the sky
It's you and I
You made me fear the dark
I let it be, let me go
But I don't want my life without your light
Close to the edge of the night
