I have been deceived
Those I believed
Vultures and thieves
You are just liars
In my eyes

For envy and lust
You broke my soul
Took all of me
I faced betrayal
You evil liars

I stumbled on the way
You've rattled all my faith
Now I am whole again
I turn the page today

Come bring it on
Give all you've got
When we'll be done you'll get to know
I'm stronger than you thought
Way over, I will survive you
Judas outshine you

I stumbled on the way
You've rattled all my faith
Now I'm whole again
I turn the page today
