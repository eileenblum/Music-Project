Sail away
Against the odds and face our darkest day
Let's try

As time runs out
We're fetching deep in our souls
Looking for
A beacon, for any bit of hope

Give everything we've got
Fight with no holding back

Do everything to hold into what I
Impersonate and everything that I
Surrendered for the beauty of your life
Just take my hand and let's start by and by

Do everything to hold into what I
Impersonate and everything that I

Call my name
We'll soon be reunited
I'll be there
In time
And we'll be fine

Give everything we've got
Fight with no holding back

Do everything to hold into what I
Impersonate and everything that I
Surrendered for the beauty of your life
Just take my hand and let's start by and by

Do everything to hold into what I
Impersonate and everything that I
Surrendered for the beauty of your life
Just take my hand and let's start by and by
