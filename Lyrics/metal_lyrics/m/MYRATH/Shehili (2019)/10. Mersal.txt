Nejma fi smeki ya hloua
Tedhoui ala ayemek, tebathlek mersel, ya maaâ¦

You waste away the blissful night, worn out to sleep
Loneliness hurts deep, burying the light
Say my name in the haze of your thoughts
And bring me back to life

It's time we've looked behind the veil
And left behind this masquerade
Universe align
It's time for you to see the signs

Nejma fi smeki ya hloua
Tedhoui ala ayemek, tebathlek mersel, ya maaâ¦
Say my name in the haze of your thoughts
And soon I'll be in sight

It's time we've looked behind the veil
And left behind this masquerade
Universe align
It's time for you to see the signs

Universe align for you and I
Universe align to who we are
It's time for us to see the signs
Universe align to who we are

It's time we've looked behind the veil
And left behind this masquerade
Universe align
It's time for you to see the signs

Leou lilek tal ou el sbeh baiid
Fi khyelek chams ou nhar jdid
Universe align
It's time for us to see the signs
Universe align to who we are
Universe align for you and I
