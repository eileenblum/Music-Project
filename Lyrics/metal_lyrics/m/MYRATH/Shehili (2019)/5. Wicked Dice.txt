How can't I see
The glow in your eyes
Flowing on the shape of your lies
Wake up to be
More than a dream
Fall into my trap
Let us roll the dice
Who knows when we will die...

Let it be, let me catch your signs
Holding on, on and on
Faking the silence
Let me see underneath your eyes
Holding on, on and on
I'm breaking your laws

I'm breaking your mind
Oh oh oh
I'm breaking your mind

Don't knock it until you have tried it for a night
You won't be cast aside
Let us play yeah yeah

Let it be, let me catch your signs
Holding on, on and on
Faking the silence
Let me see underneath your eyes
Holding on, on and on
I'm breaking your laws
