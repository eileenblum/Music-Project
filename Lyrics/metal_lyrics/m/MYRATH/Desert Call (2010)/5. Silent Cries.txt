Desperate, when I was on my own
Then you came, like in my dreams,
Tenderly your whispers echoed in my heart
Which I thought dead
With you I'm feeling warm
I'm alive... when you hold my hand

Hold my hand and get me out
From that hole I the dark
Let me see that gleam of light
Let it shine on my heart

Lost in the dark with my fears
No stars above, no one to love
Tears comes run down my face
And they fade as they fall
I heard your call, called my name

To hold my hand, bring me back to life
Yes now I'm alive, back to the real world
Now I'm feeling better
When you're by my side, I don't need to hide

I reached the bottom, you brought me back
When I was drowning you were in my mind
Oh, oh
It's your face I've seen shining down on my dimes

I feel the fever, Inside my soul
Burning desire, deep inside my heart
Now try to breathe just find some space
You are my last chance, my only way out
Oh, oh
When you talk to me,when you hold my hand

Hold my hand and get me out
From that hole I the dark
Let me see that gleam of light
Let it shine on my heart
