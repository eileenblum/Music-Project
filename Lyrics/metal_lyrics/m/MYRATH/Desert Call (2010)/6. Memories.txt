Deep breath and sweet whispers,
burning passion bursting from your lips.
A deadly addiction.
No, I never thought that blaze could fade.

Suffering and suffocating, trying so hard to forget
But I just can't forgive.
Suffering every minute, every moment, every night.

Take away all the memories with you
No more rain, let the sun rise, let the world be.
So take away all the memories with you
All with you. All with you.

Sweet bitter memories you left behind
Does it really matter, now that I no longer care?
I wonder why you played all this time with my mind
So let it go, because I did not know
that your heart was made of stone.

How did I believe your lies?
How I drowned my soul into your eyes?

Take away all the memories with you
No more rain, let the sun rise, let the world be.
So take away all the memories with you
All with you. All with you.
