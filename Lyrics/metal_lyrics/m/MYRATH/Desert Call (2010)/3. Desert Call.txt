Desert was silent and I was on my way home.
Stars shined like diamonds around a bright moon of chrome.
The soft wind of night was tickling my face,
made me feel alright, erased all my trace.

The wind start to harshen, I see a wall of sand.
A tempest was marching, covering the land.
The wrath of the Sahara was eating me alive
Unleashed all its power, the elements on strife.

I beg for my life,
the demons took over my mind.
The mighty sands just spared my life
I saw the tempest from inside.

The desert spirit was with me.
No chance to run, no way to hide,
it smiles to me and set me free.
