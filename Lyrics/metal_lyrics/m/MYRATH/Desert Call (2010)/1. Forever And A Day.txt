Through the years, time was flying by
Times were hard without you by my side.
Whenever I dragged my feet, you were always around,
showing me the wrong path from the right.

Guiding me, showing me the way
Always glowing inside, forever and a day.

I will burn each part of my soul
just to feel your warmness in this cold.
Shivering, my fingers touched your hands
No sign of life I didn't understand.

Guiding me, showing me the way
Always glowing inside, forever and a day.

I will burn each part of my soul
just to feel your warmness in this cold.
Shivering, my fingers touched your hands
No sign of life I didn't understand.
