Don't you see the red rain is falling down on us?
The pain and hate always rise, where is the trust?
I'm living in this empty world,
It's like a dead man - nothing works.

Why so many tears have had to fall,
don't you know, I'm tired of it all?

Our wishes and bloody hopes, everything is burned
And to the Lord I want to return.
My eyes are so tired because of what I've seen
How many times I pretended not to hear those screams.

Why so many tears have had to fall,
don't you know, I'm tired of it all?
So take me to another world
where there are only white birds,
where the feelings are not cold, where nobody hurts.

I flew when the planes were safe,
I cried happy tears in happy days.
I left all the crises and the wars,
my heart is tired now.
It's closing its doors.

I saw the bright sun and it didn't scorch my eyes
And I walked on the golden sand
when the sky was so beautiful.
I remember the first kiss,
the son and wife whom I miss.
First words I wrote on a candlelight
and the letters I read through the night.
