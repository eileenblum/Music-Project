I'm feeling anger
Run within my veins
For the ones who died
lost their lives in vain
Pain ain't no hope no more
misery is spreading faster
fallen angels cry
Blood, tears, and sorrows

The lonely nights spent on the front
Made me blind to all the pain around
Brave soldiers fall for no cause at all
Mighty blood quenching a thirsty ground

Soldiers fight to death
Showing blind obedience
suffering martyrdom
Tell me how could we
Pretend to build the peace
Brothers can't you see
That war is all there is
They're telling lies
Closing their eyes
Who pays the price?
With their own lives
