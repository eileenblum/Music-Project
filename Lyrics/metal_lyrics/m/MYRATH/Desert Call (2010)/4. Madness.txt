Carrying more than I can stand,
falling into the abyss.
Passing out, losing grip,
losing my faith, lost the battle.
Lost my soul by the way.
Here's my judgement
I lived a life full of regrets.

My disbelief, the hate and loneliness
consumed my soul from deep inside.
I slowly lost my reason and my mind
and fell into the madness.

Waiting for my day to come
Longing for eternal peace.
Stop the battle, close my eyes for eternity.
Madness.
