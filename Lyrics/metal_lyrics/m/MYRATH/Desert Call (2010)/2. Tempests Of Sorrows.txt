Crossing the desert alone,
the endless bright oceans of sand.
No walls and no borders on sight
Seeking the truth.

Inside my soul, silent mourns
Blind my mind, inside my heart,
tempests of sorrows drown my faith.

Went into the wild, merciless place in my mind
Where I had to find some kind of peace inside.

Wounds of the past, would they ever be healed?
Can you stop the pain and the ache?
Better tomorrows, never to come.
Bloody distant screams, seeking the truth.
