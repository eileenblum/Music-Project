It's like a shockwave to your brain
A voice that makes you go insane.
You feel that fire in your eyes,
no more chains and no more ties.

That freedom running in your vain,
under the pressure and the pain.
You're getting just as cold as ice
Like you'd get 7 with one dice.

When you're feeling wild, immature as a child.
Like a need to hit the road, ride the lightning like a god.

Feel like an atomic bomb,
From the cradle to the tomb.
From the desert to the pole,
Just let there be rock 'n roll.

Even when you're feeling low,
in the worst days that you might know,
Try to pick up your guitar,
Raise the volume to the stars.

When you're feeling wild, immature as a child.
Like a need to hit the road, ride the lightning like a god.
