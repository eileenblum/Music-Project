I can barely see the moon up in the sky
Twisting shadows blur my view and hide the light
I try to close my eyes of fear from the unknown
Still those shadows grow to fill my soul
I'm loosing control tonight
Another side seize me and belay
I, I've freed the beast inside
The one I've tried to hide
Feel every part of me start to fade
Can't face I feel so frail
Feel like I'm being flayed
By this beast that you fed with every lie
Listen mark my word
You will feel the hurt
Watch my fury blurt
Better run away
Like a deja vu
Helpful and so true
It was breed the hate
Burning me from inside
I'm loosing control tonight
Another side seize me and belay
