All these lies from you
I was such a fool
With nowhere to run
Leaving tears far behind

Shine rising sun
Sever the dark and let me go
With nowhere to run
I'm falling apart don't let me go
And I'll be there but I'm afraid
This spell you've cast on me
Forsaken have I become...this storm of lies

I don't want to know, your treason has been told
There's fire but my tears will dry tonight
Your heaven's fear burying me alive
Fading away and leaving you

Shine rising sun
Sever the dark and let me go
With nowhere to run
I'm falling apart don't let me go
And I'll be there but I'm afraid
This spell you've cast on me
Forsaken have I become...this storm of lies

[Solo]

Shine rising sun
