Righteous mask, putrid stench of decades past
This ancient stone shall crumble and fall
to ruin we were sentenced, to rule we are entailed
Biding our time in calm peace and blasphemy
Awoken from our anxious sleep with daggers to our necks
Dust now blown from shield and sheath, the hunt is on (is on)

Mercy none for the scum giving none to others
A vengeance swift and savage to even out the numbers
Bloodsea ridges invocations of the storm

The rightful kill is mother earth's for the taking
Today shall draw the line and let the rope run tight

Round their necks 'til the fire of life has left their eyes
String them up 'til the bells of war have lost their chime
Round by round, let the force of retribution sow
Cross after cross after cross on a godless shore

Depicted in your scrolls as a monument of evil
Dehumanizing faith to mold the human clay
And so you die with the promise of a sacred land
Yet in death's eyes we're all corpses all the same

In the absence of light
only darkness will thrive
and death shall prosper

Round their necks 'til the fire of life has left their eyes
String them up 'til the bells of war have lost their chime
Round by round, let the force of retribution sow
Cross after cross after cross on a godless shore

Hold you down as you gasp for air
Drive the cleaver further down
Bind those hands that clutch for light
Let the rope run...
Hold you down as you gasp for air
Drive the cleaver further down
Bind those hands that clutch for light
Let the rope run tight

Round their necks 'til the fire of life has left their eyes
String them up 'til the bells of war have lost their chime
Round by round, let the force of retribution sow
Cross after cross after cross on a godless shore
