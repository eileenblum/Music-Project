Burial, stigmatic scar-diminished flesh
Like ashes now descending failing memories of pain
Corridors, unearthly tomb, disciples of the false
Crumbling halls, tearing down the filthy cloth

Scorned monestary of worms
Womb of enfamished ruck
Downward maelstrom born of sin
Bloodless heart and lifeless skin

The poison image
Depleted life
Distorted archaic design
Burning holes of qualm beneath
Below the ruins, above the weak

Unhallowed, perfected glory
Bled to death yet reborn unholy

The poison image
Depleted life
Burning holes of qualm beneath
Below the ruins, above the weak

Fetters crushed
Pariah - the role set up to mock
