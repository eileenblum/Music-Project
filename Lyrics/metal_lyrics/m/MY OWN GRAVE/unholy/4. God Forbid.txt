The serpent coils are shifting
black wearing pale
With crown of thorns for horns
The beast was tamed

Man's endless thirst for a new god
By earthly wealth was quenched

What conceit is it not to be unfaithful
to the fate of man.
How grand the deception when head
disobeys the mind.
False idols and iconry
sworn apostles of hypocrisy.
A lifeless tail to slither in the dirt
beneath a crooked cross.

Bury Eden, burn it to the ground
now behold the remains
Is the chain rendered useless without master
without head
God Forbid

Behold the righteous
Behold the tamed
Behold voracious
nature conceiled in a gilded cage

Thou shalt not steal or murder
In no other's name than mine
Honor now your holy father
And thy will be done

Bury Eden, burn it to the ground
now behold the remains
Is the chain rendered useless without master
without head
God Forbid
