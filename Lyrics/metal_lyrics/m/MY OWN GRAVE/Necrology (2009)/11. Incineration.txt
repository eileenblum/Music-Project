Judgement day, holocaust
Fifteen seconds away from apocalyptic doom
All will corrode, suffer and die, foretold cosmic death
Irony how the species of god now torment in hell

As fire burns the sky
In violent demise
One generation left to die

Sentenced to death by the second law
Hellbent for destruction
Chaos was our origin and chaos shall be our end
Irreversible journey toward disorder

All that is shall perish, consumed by darkness
Through time evolved perfection reduced to emptiness
Hatred entropy, all immersed in flames
Swallowed by nonexistence

This is the end of all that is
Of all that was
And of all that could have been

Incineration - no judgement
Incineration - no rapture

Spires of doom, gorges of death
Gas and smoke drawn into your lungs as you slowly asphyxiate
War, god, power and oppression
All of man's precious inventions laid to waste

All that is shall perish, consumed by darkness
Through time evolved perfection reduced to emptiness
Hatred entropy, all immersed in flames
Ashes of necrology into nonexistence
