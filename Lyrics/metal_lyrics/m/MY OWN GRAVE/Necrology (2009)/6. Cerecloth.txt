Bastards of life, the harlots eclipsed by death
Spewed from the depths of her fractured mind

Macabre entombment as the carcass reeks, still warm
Flesh through lie to epitaph
Reborn, undead, unborn
Open the portal to the world below
Through necrosis inverted
Broken seals of necronomicon
The past shall be rescripted

In your final hour
You don't answer to god, you will answer to death
In cerecloth, your life entombed
Flesh shall rot and deeds live on

Gods of sepulchre stone
Govern over us
So life may imitate itself
By whom we enthrone
By the likes we condemn to never be born again

Life to you is a wait for eternity in heaven
What you consider yourself to be, it sickens me

Animal or man, equal mortal flesh
History by whatever hand
Pillars that life can never reach

In your final hour
You don't answer to god, you will answer to death
In cerecloth, your life entombed
Flesh shall rot and deeds live on
