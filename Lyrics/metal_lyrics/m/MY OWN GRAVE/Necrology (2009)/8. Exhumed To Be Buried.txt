Cold as ice, hearbeat flickering, vital flesh turning still
Spattered blood coagulating, dripping now from fainted skin
Descend like the maggots into your sockets
Rise now aborted children of the abyss

The gorgent feeding off itself
The quiet rotting in his chambers
As though we have no slaves to recollect our death

From the dawn of time in a lifeless dance
Exhumed to be
Sworn a crownless king
Baptized a godless saint
Reincarnated death
Exhumed to be buried

Flesh and blood, another shroud, another cloth
To veil our banes from the goddess of time
Kali! darkness fills my coffin
Degeneration soon to be

Death is near, hell is here

It's just another life
Another world, another time

Emperor, your sword won't help you out
Sceptre and crown are worthless here
I've taken you by the hand
For you must come to my dance

From the dawn of time in a lifeless dance
Exhumed to be
Sworn a crownless king
Baptized a godless saint
Reincarnated death
Exhumed to be buried
