In the fathomless darkness above
Burning bodies, a codex we conjure the existence
Flames made flesh
In their mind gateways are opening
Mirror pieces spread across the earth
Features of the coming god

Son of virgin whore, star of the hound beyond Orion
Sacrificed by his own, crucified, resurrected from the dead
Council to unite, fear of hell leads to power
Pagan god exhumed
Son of Nazarene by Nicean rule: bastard son of god

I am he whom fear has born
The lord, prophet, Jesus Christ
Laws of man will not confine me, none shall forget me
Before my time has come
None shall see
With open eyes

As it shone light as did it bring darkness
Allured by inborn attraction to simple ways
Primeval belief transmogrified, in mutation
Progress ceased by the inferior in dominance

Not even your made up god
Can hid her disgust for what you have become

I am he whom fear has born
The lord, prophet, Jesus Christ
Laws of man will not confine me, none shall forget me
Before my time has come
None shall see
With open eyes
