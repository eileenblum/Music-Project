With undying hunber, a fathomless swarm of locusts
As one, bottomless pit of gaping mouths
Parasitical leaches scavenging, bleeding the host dry
Black vulture wings extinguish the sun
The day of reckoning awaits, I shall spare no one
Master turns slave, the butcher himself becomes food for the rats
Fields ripe with putrefaction without end, and for the dead
No casket, no funeral, no mourning and no obituary

Walk the streets of solitude paved with bodies of the dead
Fear of dying stronger than the fear of life
Refuge in the shadows a rusted monolith, forlorn amongst the ruins

Bloodline broken

These voices from beyond, gnawing the flesh from my bone

Like a million voices screaming, draining the sanity from my soul

In this sanctuary, your heaven. with morphine in your blood to keep you safe
From madness tearing, clawing at your skin from the inside
In a haze through the grates, you witness the end

Walk the streets of solitude paved with bodies of the dead
Fear of dying stronger than the fear of life
Refuge in the shadows a rusted monolith, forlorn amongst the ruins

Over cemetery fields, the last of manking
Dethrone monarch in the kingdom of the dead
In no man's land, as despair has conquered his fear
Broken like his the bloodline is
