Cut out unwanted pieces, rebuild an age long lost
Colossus to the heavens
Block by block, bone upon bone
Panem et circenses. Play for the dead as they rot

Defiance strangled at birth, unquiet tongues cut out
Unruly voices silenced, decapitation

Worship a vengeful god, better be feared than loved
All through majestic corridors, the new mourning dawns

The untruth shall set you free upon the altars of deceit
Blood for gold, fear and greed
Ink for our necrology

Rabid eyes burst open
Rotted apparition of the god that never was
Putrid vessels clogged by filth grafted into his heart
In autopsy awoken

The time has come to collect, to take an eye for an eye
For soldiers marching to their death, cursing your name as they die
Time heels the deepest wound and fades the gravest mistake
To give the vicious ones eternal glory in death

The untruth shall set you free upon the altars of deceit
Blood for gold, fear and greed
Ink for our necrology

Eternal glory
Eternal glory in death
Devoured
The lives we lead
By our necrology
