Born in captivity, rising from a whisper to a scream.
A force too strong to seal within, leaking through the wounds of man.
I saw it back when it was a fetus and yet my blood was ice.
I've seen it now as I gaze into the undrying well of our demise.
"So listen to the inner voice of lies"
Spread the plague
Walk among the tainted ones
Spread the plague
Bear the mark of a new world order
Spread the plague
Infected, corrupted, devoured

Hungerless and sleepless, moving faster than the light.
Over oceans, over cities, destroying bounds, infecting hearts.
I'll have to end this now, for I feel I'm not alone...

Brother killing brother as the virus feeds.
Fire drinking deep from mother earth.
And the day the first bombs fell, who would take the blame?
Connected by blood, severed by greed, we were all infected!

All that was torn to see the dawn of a new day has forever been smashed.
The shattered pieces of yesterday are but memories, ashes and dust.

Spread the plague
Walk among the tainted ones
Spread the plague
Bear the mark of a new world order
Spread the plague
Infected, corrupted, devoured
