Foreshadow of the wicked,
uncanny beast of prey.
Bestowed with demonic virtue.
We watched you stray the path to hell.

Inside the sickened heart, terror dwells again.
The same old torture with just a different name.
The same old hunger begging to be quenched.
Another smite for vengeance, this is the theme for the dead!

Praise be the victims - fuel for his fire.
Praise be the blood - water for his barren realm.
The faces change but deep inside the mirage
echoes the ancient hymn of vengeance, the theme for the dead!

Inside the sickened heart, horror reigns again.
The same old carnage with just a different face.
The same old thirst begging to be quenched.
Another smite for vengeance, this is the theme for the dead!
