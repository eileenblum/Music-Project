Blessed are the blind for they do not see.
Blessed are the deaf for they cannot hear
the pestering cacophony or see the vermin crawl beneath the skin.

Strangled by life.
Smothered by the world.
Strangled by life.
I am infected with humanity.
Hatred.

I will not become another zombie wandering the streets of Sodom.
Rather dead and buried than a walking corpse.
Ten thousand days of torment ends now in a heartbeat.
Finally I'm falling into the bottomless pit.

Blissful are the dead hidden from the world.
Untroubled are the sleeping until they wake
to days of anguish, to open eyes in pain.
Despising time away, in a dying cage of flesh.

Strangled by life.
Smothered by the world
Strangled by life.
I am infected with humanity.
Buried.
