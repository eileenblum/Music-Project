Waiting in the grave
buried deep in the trenches of hell
Standing in line to die yet I'm already dead

Another morning ripe for killing
Death's scythe carving pawns of war

Forth for vengeance, forth for hate
I am every slaughter reincarnate
Split second murder we're all fuel for the machine
Behind impassive eyes dead bodies wait to be released

No time for mercy
make this day another man's funeral
And let the napalm rain wash our sins away

Forth for vengeance, forth for hate
I am every slaughter reincarnate
Split second murder we're all fuel for the machine
Behind impassive eyes dead bodies wait to be released

Genocide has begun
Detonations digging mass-graves
Paralyzed, hammered down
as my body is blown

Into pieces
