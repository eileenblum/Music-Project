Slowly I realize... I am awake
Lying under the wings of a majestic tree
Mystified by this returning life
Is this heaven? It sure ain't hell

Wondering how I got here
Getting up along the tree
I hold its stem and freeze
As its voice speaks to me...

Please let me introduce myself
I am your personal tree... of pain
Growing ever since your first tears
The living memory of all your grief
My roots guided you from hell to life
Lightening your wounds and heart
All prepared for another start

Thankful I bow and go
I walk on... to yet another try
To live, to love, and happiness
Wondering what will bring me down - this time
Wondering what will bring me down - in the end
I walk on... to my life's burial

C'est la vie, qu'on marche enfin...
La marche funÃ¨bre
Du berceau, jusqu'Ã  la fin...
La marche funÃ¨bre
