A somber view... of dying love
The air breathes pain and loss

I walk on dirty cobbles...
Shimmering of old tears
I walk on buried joy...
Drowned hopes and shattered dreams

Je me promÃ¨ne sur l'avenue des cÅurs passÃ©s
Et j'y trouve des belles Ã¢mes blessÃ©es
Je me promÃ¨ne sur l'avenue des cÅurs cassÃ©s
La chaussÃ©e des larmes et des cÅurs brisÃ©s...

At my left I see a young woman
Struggling for happiness
Her child cries my name
Until my ears bleed and my heart dies

Another tragedy somewhere on the right
Mother of some of my prettiest dreams
Her heart in her hand - Her eyes look at me
Black from unstoppable sadness

Others appear... all beautiful creatures
Once dancing as fairies under the moon
As succubae in rapture... with me
But I left without love...

Their pain is mine
Their broken hearts
Their shattered dreams
Are mine

In my dreams they haunt me
Angel claws tear my skin
Their grief is now mine
Leaving me... scarred and wrecked

I know I'll have to bury
These fragile dreams of love
So deep... so deep...
I wipe away my tears and walk on...
To my sad past's funeral...
