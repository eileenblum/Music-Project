We are
As in autumn
From the trees
We are the leaves
Welcome to my sacred world
A mise-en-scÃ¨ne of the nameless
I wait for the curtain t fall
On the stage of the forgotten

A face, a name without meaning
Your smile without a feeling
I'm casting roles without a tale to tell
In a theatre one cannot escape (from)

Jesus Christ on the wall
And children hiding in the garden

We are
As in autumn
From the trees

The lens closed its eye upon me
I'm captured in black and white
Left with nothing to fight for
No more days - I want nothing more

In a world where nothing speaks
I find but the traces of my deeds
My wish falls on a deaf crowd
Even screams could not escape my mouth

Not the same Christ on the wall
No children hiding in the garden

This world infects me without impressions
Leaving me numb without expressions
A thousand words I take with me
The screams, the anger, the dark whispers
You'll never know what I hate
You'll never know whom I love

I am still here, but I'm not alive
With no one to help
Why can't I tell you
Why can't you help me
Please, help me die....
