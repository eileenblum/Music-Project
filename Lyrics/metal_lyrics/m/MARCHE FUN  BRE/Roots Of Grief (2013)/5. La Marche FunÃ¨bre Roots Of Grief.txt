Feet stumbling, sweat running
I breathe dust and walk on
Until the end of the world
To this broken life's end

One way dead end road
I sense... darkness and death
I guess... this must be hell
And I know I have to go...

While my spine chills unendingly - I live!
My hands search for escape - I gotta get away!
Primordial instincts take control - I live!
A stronge force of life calles me - I gotta get away!

I grasp memories of blood and tears
Reason shut down as I ascend
I rise in trance as my life passes by
A kaleidoscope slightly fading to black...
