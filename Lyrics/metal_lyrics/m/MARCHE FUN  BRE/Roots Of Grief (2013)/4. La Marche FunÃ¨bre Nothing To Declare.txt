My eyes - died in salted sadness
My ears - drowned in floods of blood
My heart - buried with my past
My life - leaving me...

Nothing to declare - I left it all there
Nothing to declare - but infinite despair

And in this soundless darkness
Bereft of almost all senses
I wished and hoped for tranquility
Awake dreams of eternal rest

A myriad of distressing seeds
Planted by my self and soul
Awoke a restless inner ghoul
'Cause history can't be buried!

I see - the faces of those I lost
I hear - my name in desperate cries
I feel - pain in my crimson chambers
I know - I thought I had...

Nothing to declare

Sad memories haunt me
Grief written in every nerve and vein
The history of my dismal senses
Leaving me... no rest or escape!

This life-devouring desperation
Drags me to the ultimate edge
Embrace life (- Face death)
As only in life I might heal...
(Embrace life -) Face death
As only in death I can hide...
