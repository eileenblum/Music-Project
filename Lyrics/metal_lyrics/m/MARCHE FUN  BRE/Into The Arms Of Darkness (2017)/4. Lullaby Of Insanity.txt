Here, where clouds paint the sky
A canvas of pitch black darkness
All voices silenced, except those... in my head

No nightmare can compete
This sick melody, my lullaby
The last thing that I need
A sickening melody... of insanity

Here, where night is all and everything
And sleep is so much desired, so much...
To shut down the voices... in my head

Hear, the voices arrived... again
A panorama of ghosts and ghouls
On an ailing parade... in my head

Hear their cries, calling my name... again
Tragic echoes of my dire past
When silence is all I need... in my head

Shut down! End this masquerade of pain
Shut down! This call to the insane
Shut down! I plead, I beg, I crawl, I crave
Shut down! End this lullaby of insanity

To sleep is to live
We need it like air
To live is to die
First rule of life
And I ... I die to sleep...
Every night again
Yet these haunted moments
When we sail away
When we empty our head
These dreadful moments...
Take my breath away
And panic rules
When the hour is nigh
As for me
To go to sleep is... to die

End this masquerade of pain
This call to the insane
I plead, I beg, I crawl, I crave
End this lullaby of insanity
...and sink into oblivion
