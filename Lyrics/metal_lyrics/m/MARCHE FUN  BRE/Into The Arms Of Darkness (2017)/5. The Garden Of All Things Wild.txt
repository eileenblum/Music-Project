I have come from the valley
This track runs deep
Darkness overcome
Still the hill grows steep
Iâve believed all my demons
And the filth theyâve preached
Iâve awoken from that sleep
Now the summit I will reach

And see the field
Swarmed by scarlet light

I enter these novel meadows
Brimmed with vanes and folk
Praised by harlots and jesters
As a king foretold
Ruling over morrow and yester
I possess all but gold
Malignant or benign
All who lived would align

To feast and dine,
Drenched pyres with wine

In the garden of earthly delights
A place for all things wild
The garden of earthly delights
My Eden
Love and lust be my guide

Whoâs this creature before me
Known unto none
Sister of nightly moth
She worships the sun

With the beauty of a goddess
And wings fiery red
She stared into my soul
And awoke what I thought was dead

Her flight took to the sky
But in time she would be mine
From that moment on, I did yearn
Deeply prayed for her return
Ever did I seek her trail
By the flowers she kissed
One early dusk she sat sail
This time my grip did not miss

I poured her into a vessel cold
As her wings struck glass
Accepting the bold threshold
We both found rest, at last

The dawn was filled with regret
For morrow had brought death
From my queen all life had gone

Oh my poor sweet child
Now my own heavenâs denied
Oh my god, what have I done

I buried her in my hands
With the pity death demands
My tears fell unto her flesh

A motion, an act
Her wings moved, death was cracked
Forgiveness was mine
In one last kiss goodbye

To love you I must set you free
Never fully close my grip
Hope you return, come and rest with me
In my life of all things wild

To love me you must choose the sky
Along with the wind you need to fly
But come rest close to me,
And captivate me
In our garden of all things wild
