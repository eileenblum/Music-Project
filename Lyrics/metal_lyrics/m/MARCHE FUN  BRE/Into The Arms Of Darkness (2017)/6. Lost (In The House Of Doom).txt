Lost in a dream, I longâ¦ for you
Your eyesâ¦ haunt my nightly shade
Lost in a dream, I longâ¦ for you
Your voiceâ¦ whispers in every corner

So why? Why did you stepâ¦
Out of the dream and into my life?

Resistance was futile
Surrender with a smile
A sort of homecoming
In your house and arms
Never experienced and unexpected
Turning life upside down and inside out

In the house of doom
My heart has its place
For my entire life, alas
I can find no room

Lost in a dream, I longâ¦ for you
Your scentâ¦ calls my inner nature
Lost in a dream, I longâ¦ for you
Your touchâ¦ will shiver my skin

Lost in the house of doom
My heart desires to stay
Lost in my house of doom
Exit through the back door

In the house of doom
My heart has its place
For my entire life, alas
I can find no room

Iâll put out the lights
So I donât have to see
I turn my back
And go backâ¦
To my life â without you
To my past â without us
