Imagine... space...
Vast desolateness...
The attraction of light, starlight
In an ocean of black, the sun
You

Spaceâ¦
Iâm drifting, drawn
Towards you
My sun in dark times
Brightening my heart
The warm glow of love
Haven of hope
Heaven

Like Icarus â I dreamt of light
Like Icarus â I came too close
Like Icarus â I dreamt of light
Like Icarus â my melted dreams

Heaven within reach
Soul mates collision
A black hole instead
A collapse of faith

Heaven burnt to ashes
I came too close

You, my supernova, so near
No laws of nature could capture
Our mutual attraction, so pure
Our dreams of love â in vain

Like Icarus â I dreamt of light
Like Icarus â I came too close
Like Icarus â I dreamt of light
Like Icarus â my melted dreams

Imagineâ¦ it would have worked
But you could notâ¦ noâ¦ noâ¦
A galactic implosion instead
My sun cast me into infinity
A massive black hole
Devoid of you, I driftedâ¦

Deprived - I drift
Deprived from the light
I driftâ¦ into darkness
Deprived from love
I driftâ¦ into nothingness
Deprived from you
I dwellâ¦ into darkness

Dreamingâ¦ of you
Dreamingâ¦ of light
Dreamingâ¦ to endâ¦
This night... eternal

Deprived - I drift
Deprived from the light
I driftâ¦ into darkness
Deprived from love
I driftâ¦ into nothingness
Deprived from you
I dwellâ¦ into darkness
