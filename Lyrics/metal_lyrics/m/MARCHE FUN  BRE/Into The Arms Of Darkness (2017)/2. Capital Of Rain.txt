Welcome to the place we all know
Where we all feel home
And no one likes to stay
Meet those who fade to grey

Cette pluie Ã©ternelle, qui Ã©rode le corps, assombrit l'Ã¢me

Dejection
falls from the sky
eternally

Relentless tears shroud a city
Like mist from ages of dread
Grey skies untouched by sun
Host an empire of sadness

Cette pluie Ã©ternelle, qui Ã©rode le corps, assombrit l'Ã¢me

Dejection
falls from the sky
eternally

And in this capital of rain
There's comfort in tears
And in this eternity of mist
Eyes can see no light
And in this lightless place
All have faded to grey
And all this pouring misery
Mirrors their soul...

Darkness blinds all life and light
She is the Universe
