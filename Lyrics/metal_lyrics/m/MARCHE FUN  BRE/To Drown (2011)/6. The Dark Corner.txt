Whispers creep in me
Like splinters of glass on a crimson shore
Voices from the outside
Bleed my veins into cold dry rivers

This awkward feeling from my inner depths
Awoke my state of growing unease
Uncertainâ¦ I await my stormâ¦
A ghastly flood into the darkest of me

Do I always end up there?
With tears and a broken I?
A book full of words, hollow and empty
At the end, in the dark corner

The Dark Corner â where no one looks
Behind the curtains â where no one hears
The Dark Corner â where no one feels
But meâ¦

Every fresh start with a golden shine
Crumbles in a void of unspoken words
Any brilliant prospect fades
Into another dreadful endingâ¦

Betrayed, and stabbed in the back
Bruised â beaten â broken
My heart hurt, yet still alive
â¦ Far away from the light

Have I called it upon meâ¦ once again?
Is it my destiny to end behind the curtains?
â¦ Far away from the light
At the end, in the dark corner

The Dark Corner â where no one looks
Behind the curtains â where no one hears
The Dark Corner â Where no one feels
But meâ¦
