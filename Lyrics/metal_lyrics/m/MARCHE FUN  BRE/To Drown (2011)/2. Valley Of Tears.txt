A cold wind rose
A sigh to chill
In the valley of tears
The rosesâ grave...

Love grew like blooming spring
A long feast of passion fruit
Though loathsome ghosts of the past
Silently poisoned the hearts

How did it come this far?
All seemed fair and bright
How did it come this far?
To a love without light

With every moon new tears came
Initiating a catharsis of pain
A manmade soul rebirth process
That seemed never ever ending

And the tears kept coming
Like an ever flowing stream
Asphyxiating valley into lake
A sea of sadnessâ¦to drown in

Loathsome ghosts of the past
Poisoned the hearts
And drowned all hope
In the valley of tears
The roseâs grave...
