All what is said will be forgotten
All which is done is in vain
For the wise and for the fool
Thereâs no remembrance
It is lifted from our hearts all too soon

All we have seen are shadows flickering on the wall
No truth to be found
Just the name of things, great and small
Weâve hidden our eyes in darkness
Not knowing what the mind was
To turn towards the sun
Our betrayal of the senses

Here, where we breathe
Existence is thin
Heartbeats gallop
And veins rip our skin
From all our dreams
We are only to awake
As our lives unveil
A path to forsake

As all our seasons fade
Into this numbness, mass of grey
The sole gift of heaven is the scorching rain
From which we turn away with shame
All the stories that have been told
Are left here for none to behold

All under the sun will wash away
Whilst the desertion of god lasts forever
As every statue crumbles
The great absence is felt
In the end, pain condemns our consciousness

All we have done has lead to our downfall
âVanity of all vanities, all is in vainâ
