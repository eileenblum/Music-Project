O, dearest Princess
Did I still your heart?
Did I freeze your blood?
That passionate flood
I love so much

I know I hurt you
And the powerlessness
To undo this pain
To take away the vermin
Eating our unspoken bond
Is drowning me

No word, no smile
No blink of my eye
Seems to help me now
To kill this uncertainty

I feel myself slipping away
In the well of your thoughts
I feel myself
In the well that drowns me

All I really know
Are the tears in my eyes
The beating of my heart
The lack ofâ¦ You
In my arms
The lack ofâ¦ You
In my arms
My love

Did I still your heart?
Did I freeze your blood?
That passionate flood
I love so much

O, dearest Princess
All I really know
Are the tears in my eyes
The beating of my heart
The lack ofâ¦ You
In my arms
The lack ofâ¦ Me
In your arms
The lack ofâ¦ You
In my arms
My love
