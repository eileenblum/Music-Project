You can see them marching in With guns in their hands
Never fall back it`s time to face your fear
Kill or be killed death blast in the ear
feel that pressure beyond Dimensions

When metal meets flesh you gonna feel that pain
you gonna feel that pain, you all gonna suffer
you all gonna die, kill`em one by one

To the battlefield we go With blood on our hands
fire on command destroy another man
Your time fast tickin' feel the rush in the ear

taste that pressure beyond dimensions
When metal meets flesh you gonna feel that pain
you gonna feel that pain, you all gonna suffer
you all gonna die, kill`em one by one

Rules of engagement prepare to
Die
Kill
Live
On

Battlefield and no man's land
rules of war
battlefield and no man's land
rules of engagement

War is hell yeah scars of insanity
bloodline suffer no guts no tougher
kill or be killed death blast in the ear
feel that pressure beyond Dimensions

When metal meets flesh you gonna feel that pain
you gonna feel that pain, you all gonna suffer
you all gonna die, kill`em one by one
