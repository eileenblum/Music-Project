You`re born and you fall and you rise up again
you wonder how your life could be
You dream and you scream and you wake up again
you wonder where the hell you`ve been

I dig my own hole to be buried in
I bear the guilt on my shoulder I fear the sin
And all around I see this pain is it real
That the devils are dancing on my table again

You`re patronized and you have sacrificed
to the bottom of your soul
You created life and then you took that life
That you say was never meant to be

I dig my own hole to be buried in
I bear the guilt on my shoulder I fear the sin
And all around I see this pain is it real
that the devils are dancing on my table again

Half-hearted all hated, hated betrayed
In the shadow of the valley Of death
Never ever more feel this pain again
as we struggle on and on

I dig my own hole to be buried in
I bear the guilt on my shoulder I fear the sin
And all around I see this pain is it real
That the devils are dancing on my table again
