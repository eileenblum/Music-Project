Where can I go not to be disturbed
where can I hide to be alone
empty Words got nothing to tell
you can't give what you don't have

Bad old habits die hard
Bad old habits die hard
Bad old habits die hard
Bad old habits die

We all live in some disguise
in an eternal feeling that hides
nothing more and nothing less
precious time is timeless

Bad old habits die hard
Bad old habits die hard
Bad old habits die hard
Bad old habits die

When nothing seems to be
the way I want it - want it to be
someone gives another takes
and someone bleeds for nothing

Bad old habits die hard
Bad old habits die
Bad old habits die hard
Bad old habits die hard
