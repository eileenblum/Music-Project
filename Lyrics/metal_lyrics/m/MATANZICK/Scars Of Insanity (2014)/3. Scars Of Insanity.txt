I pray that inner demon will go away
Spare me from the cards you dealt

I kneel to confess what I feel
Betray me no more we pay back debt

I got scars of insanity
On the edge feel the adrenaline
I got scars of insanity
Stitch me up so I can heal

That motherfucker is in my head
I declare myself insane

claws rip through my brain
take my sanity away

I got scars of insanity
On the edge feel the adrenaline
I got scars of insanity
Stitch me up so I can heal

Scars of insanity
On the edge feel the adrenaline
I got scars of insanity
Stitch me up so I can heal
