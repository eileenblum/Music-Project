We ain't born to stay in rage
because it all turns to rust when we age
Pitch black eyes do perspire
leaving tracks: doing what we require

Hi baby you're gonna see
my conscience seems to be better than me
One down, two to go, yeah
pulling out, justice is near

You break it down while we build up
The machine
broken machine

We stay on course, straight ahead
ain't braking down, never make me bad
Payback; time to deliver
you're a taker I'm a giver

I let my guard fall down
I fell hard to the ground
One down, two to go, yeah
pulling out, justice is here

You break it down while we build up
The machine
broken machine

The machine
broken machine
