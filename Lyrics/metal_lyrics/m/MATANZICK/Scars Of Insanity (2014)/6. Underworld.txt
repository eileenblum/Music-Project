You pray With both hands strapped at your wrists
Just say those words and I might let you go
A solid state of mind we made up who we are
that life we lived and all of those scars

Two steps from the edge and I can`t stop bleeding
it`s like open wounds, and the underworld can`t save us all
we fight the demon`s desire

He's been told if he plays with fire he's gonna burn his soul
he says I don't bother, no I don't bother at all
Counting sculls in the underworld
he just wanna make things right
And listen to that voice inside

Underworld

So we ended up where we started at the end of the road
I feel a cold breeze breathing down my neck
Is this the world as we know it restless and doomed
Salvation lies within

Two steps from the edge and I can`t stop bleeding
it`s like open wounds, and the underworld can`t save us all
we fight the demon`s desire

He's been told if he plays With fire he's gonna burn his soul
he says I don't bother, no I don't bother at all
Counting sculls in the underworld
he just wanna make things right
And listen to that voice inside

Two steps from the edge and I can`t stop bleeding
it`s like open wounds, and the underworld can`t save us all
we fight the demon`s desire
