I never know where to go
They drag me down to the unknown

Sue me sue me in hell
Sue me sue me in hell
If you gonna sue me
you better sue me in hell
better sue me in hell

Destroy
Disorder
Disaster

Do I believe in god himself
In eternity forever me

Sue me sue me in hell
Sue me sue me in hell

Another time to free me mind
I'm losing grip I can't deny

Sue me sue me in hell
Sue me sue me in hell

Destroy
Disorder
Disaster

Sue me in hell
