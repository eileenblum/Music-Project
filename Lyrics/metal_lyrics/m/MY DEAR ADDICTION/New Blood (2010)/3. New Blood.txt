As I walk the path that we call life
Recollection is the only truth I know
Apart from these bitter memories
Our world lays within my reach

Our bond is the only way
To make this world our own

All I was and all I did
As the reason that I am
Can't recall those moments in the past
You're the reason that I last

I've got nothing left to give to you
These words are all I have
A shattered soul is yours to keep
At last my body comes to life

Our bond is the only way
To make this world our own

All I was and all I did
As the reason that I am
New blood

Can't recall those moments in the past
You're the reason that I last

I've got nothing
I've got nothing
I've got nothing
I've got nothing
Without you

All I was and all I did
As the reason that I am
Can't recall those moments in the past
You're the reason that I last
