I give in, this is my weak point
I try to walk the path of faith alone
To the ground I fall
Drained of hope I call

Make me feel serenity
Take this pain that's burning in my soul
I beg for you to see
And light the way for me

There is always a flame
There is always hope

And I, I give you my life
It's all that I have
And I, I give you my heart
It's all for you

Hear my prayers to you
Teach me how to live your spoken word
Please forgive my sin
That tears me deep within

Take me back to innocence
See the truth that's glowing in my heart
I know you hear my call and never let me fall

And I, I give you my life
It's all that I have
And I, I give you my heart
It's all for you

You have never turned away from me
And I will never turn away from you
