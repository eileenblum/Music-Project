Keep my fragile hands from shaking
Keep me up from slipping away
Lord, keep this fire burning
Keep me up and I will pray

Come fire my salvation
This love my determination

Through the ache and endless tears
Our faith began to grow
I could not see it at the time
But our light began to glow

I close my eyes 'cause then I see
And I feel you here with me
In the darkness you are my light
Your love will lead me right

Come fire my salvation
This love my determination

Through the ache and endless tears
Our faith began to grow
I could not see it at the time
But our light began to glow

Now you are here
Serenity inside
My eyes are clear
Together you and I

Through the ache and endless tears
Our faith began to grow
I could not see it at the time
But our light began to glow

Together you and I
Together you and I
