Time to open up your eyes
Time to leave all those lies
Time to face the truth
Strive for righteousness

Time to light the flames inside
Time for fire to purify
Time to leave this hate behind
Time to leave the dark side behind

Are you alive?

Something inside you faded away
You seemed weaker every day so I said a prayer
For the times when you were lost and all alone
And now I know which way you chose
I looked in your eyes
I saw your pain
In your heart was only rain
I will help you fight
I will lead you right
I will take your heart from dark into light

You've got one chance
One life now
Breath in , breath out
Embrace this life you've got now
Breath in , breath out

Time for you to stand up tall
Time for you to rise from your fall
Time to feel the love in your heart
Forgive and forget for a new start

Time to light the flames, the inside
Time for fire to purify
Time to leave this hate behind
Time to leave the dark side behind
