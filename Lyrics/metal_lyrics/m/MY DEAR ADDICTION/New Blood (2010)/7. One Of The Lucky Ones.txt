I give a piece of me
To the world if they wanna see
I've written this for you
For those out there who actually cared
I treasured in my heart
I can see the tears that you cried for me

Am I one of the lucky ones?
My breath is put to rest
Do you have a piece from me
Still there in your heart?
Am I more than a memory
When I'm leaving you behind?
Am I one of the lucky ones
To still bring light in your life?

Those days are gone
When I could hold your hand in mine
And tell you that I love you
Just by words (I love you)
I wish I could turn back time
So I could look into your eyes
And ask you not to cry
'Cause I will never leave you

I am in everything around you

To still bring light in your life
