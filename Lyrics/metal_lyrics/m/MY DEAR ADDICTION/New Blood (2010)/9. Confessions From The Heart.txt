Come clarity and divert the dark clouds in my mind
Sever the hate from my thoughts for deliverance

Give me the power to leave my dark side behind
This revelation there is a better life to find

Give me the strength for times
When I must fight these battles inside of myself

To keep myself in the ray of light

I close my eyes
To see your face before me
To find myself in you

I close my eyes
To see your face before me
To find myself in you

To find myself in you...

Take my pain
Take my scars inside of me
Cleanse my heart now
Take my hate
Take my rage inside of me
Set my soul free

I close my eyes
To see your face before me
To find myself in you

In the burnt out ashes my hope slowly begins to shine
I feel my faith grows so strong inside of me
I know for certain and I feel it deep in my heart

I close my eyes
To see your face before me
To find myself in you

I close my eyes
To see your face before me
To find myself in you

To find myself
