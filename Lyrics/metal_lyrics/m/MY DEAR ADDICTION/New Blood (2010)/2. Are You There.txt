Magnetic patterns capturing the weak
Unaware of life slowly fades
Injected with poison that drains what's left to be
The curtain falls down before their eyes

Show me the way
Let me know
That you understand
That you see

Are you there?
The memories bring a piece of light
Are you there?
The aching brings you back to life

Exhale the poison
That slowly makes you numb
Face your reflection
Break this curse
Carve out the pieces buried in your heart
Reclaim yourself
Face yourself

Show me the way
Let me know
That you understand
That you see

Are you there?
The memories bring a piece of light
Are you there?
The aching brings you back to life

All the pain in your heart and mind
Try to fight and try to find
Face to face with all your fears
And now you'll see it all so clear

Now is the time to let your rage go...
Now is the time to turn the page so...

But you can never change me
