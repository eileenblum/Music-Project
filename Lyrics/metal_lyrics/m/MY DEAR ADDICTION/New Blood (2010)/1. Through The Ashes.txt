Readjust and cleanse my mind
A broken past with scars to find
Away ahead and leave behind
The forsaken side of me

I face the mirrors own truth
Facing the reflection of myself
With strength I will rise again

I won't give in
Just break the doubts inside your mind
I won't give in
Inside your heart until the end of time

Through the ashes I will rise
'Cause now I see
There is a spoken path for me
Through the ashes I will rise
Embrace this life
There is another chance you'll see

You lead me forth when I was blind
As was my soul when you arrived
You embraced without a doubt
The forsaken side of me

To fail it's not an option now
Your presence made me realize
You're always by my side

I won't give in
Inside your heart
Until the end of time

I won't give in
Just break the doubts inside your mind
I won't give in
Inside your heart
Until the end of time
