Look at me now!

You tear me up
But couldn't break me down
I can remember
The lies you spit in my face

So here I am
I'm not going down
Look at you now
Don't you know
I made it
"What goes around comes around"

I gaze at your life, and I see a shattered soul
What's lost inside of you?
Is there a secret that you keep?

I hope your mind
Will turn from dark into white
Do you like that?
You like that?
That I care when you just left me there?

My time is here
I feel no pain
I feel no pain

Sacrifice yourself to bring back the fire in your eyes
Save yourself from the nothing you become

I know your mind
Will turn from black into white
Do you like that?
You like that?
That I care when you just left me there?

Look inside and there you'll see
Among the scars a part of me

Never alone when you are facing your fears
I was the one that brought you here
