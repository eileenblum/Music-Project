A gallery of my greatest fears, in sheer disdain
For a moribund heart and all that remains

Erase the sun

A pale orchid withers away
Tainted by deepest regret
Departure marked by decay
Carving bleak melodies on my chest

A symphony of suffering
Adrift in the sands of time
Summoning ghosts that haunt moments
Of days scarred and unrefined

Erase the sun
So I can see
Which star will shine in this soulless night

When sanity lies at its limit
Craving for a chance at redemption
Accursed by a broken spirit
I ache to find liberation

I ache for the loss of her splendor
An existence beyond sublime
Yearning for a dire breath
Her memory banned from my mind

Iâll be the one
On my bended knees
Beneath the moon, devoid of light

How does it feel to be alive?
Beyond all will to survive
This is the day I die

Erase the sun
So I can see
Which star will shine in this soulless night

Iâll be the one
On my bended knees
Beneath the moon, devoid of light
