I, tainted fiend
Withered, cradled by these woes
Hereby reap my sorrows
Writhing as I decompose

I, enslaved by the profane,
Bow to demons of guilt
Shackling this soul to shame

So it seems her absence was my bane
The blade that lacks a hilt
Ashes against the grain

In the eye of the storm birthed from the abyss
Ten thousand hymns are heard, hailing depravity
Embracing the last drops of indigo bliss
Amidst such shapelessness, drowning in lunacy

Here I am
Gouging out my eyes
Rotting as the daylight dies
Exorcized of lies
Crucified, I agonize

Crowned king of disdain
As the castle we built
Washed away with the rain

And thus, these tattered remains
Of adoration unfit
Fell into deathâs dark domains

Lacking the restraint
To save half of what I am
Adrift in the pain of temptation
The taint of deception
It condemns me to damnation

Gouging out my eyes
Rotting as the daylight dies
Exorcized of lies
Crucified, I agonize

Peace lies in defeat
Hope is now obsolete
A heartâs dire beat
Eternally incomplete
Shattered is all deceit
I submit to my defeat

Shedding two lonely tears
One for each of us, my dear
For the end draws near
And soon both of us will disappear
