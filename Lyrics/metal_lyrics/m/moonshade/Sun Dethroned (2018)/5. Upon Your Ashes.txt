With ashes in my mouth, I grieve
The stigmata of loss, it reaves
A soul lacking traits of humanity

Such hecatomb without resemblance
Awakens a thirst for vengeance
For the anathema that befell me

Engulf the world
In unforgiving flames

I dream of rivers of blood in a never-ending fire
This cataclysmic wrath will shatter the earth under thee
Unearthing our nature as slaves of desire
A cross to bear in all its unholy profanity

Stripped of the fabled veil of wonder
That blinds the face of all mankind
Finding solace in my insanity

Of love and loss I knew enough
As all bliss hastily turned to dust
All meaning lost through lifeâs opacity

All this hatred
Living within

I dream of rivers of blood in a never-ending fire
This cataclysmic wrath will shatter the earth under thee
Unearthing our nature as slaves of desire
A cross to bear in all its unholy profanity

A curse upon thee
Corrupt child of Man
For this is the day
We will come to end

All this hatred
Living within
Will trigger the coming
Of wages of sin

A new world so begins

Apocalypse dawns from the depths of despair
For an accursed race, condemned to decadence
A beast awakened, in darkness I dwell
Bleeding through the gashes in my innocence

Ephemerality flooded by suffering
Cleansed in an odious instance
