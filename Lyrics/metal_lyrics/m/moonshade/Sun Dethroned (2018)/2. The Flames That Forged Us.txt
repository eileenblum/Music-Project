A most erotic sÃ©ance
Of darkness embedded
Abandoned two lost souls in
The path they were headed

Bleeding accursed notes
Corrupted litanies
Relenting, repenting
The time theyâve not seized

A plethora of hearts so were torn
From the bosom of grief, two souls were reborn
And damned be the keys that she plays
Through these hallowed days

Bodies lie down between lives
Consumed by lust, their eternal demise
What lies beyond the gates of fear?
Of Heaven and Hell I know not, my darling dear

Thus we hail such blasphemy
In the path of tragedy

Bodies that love between lives
Consumed by lust, their eternal demise
What lies beyond the gates of fear?
Of heaven and hell I know not, my darling dear

Thus I chose to burn in your arms
As you turned all these doubts into opaque glass shards

Sin with me,
Whisper to me all we can be

Contemplating salvation
Bathing in fractals of us
The foundation of redemption
Forging both our hearts from dust

Cimmerian temptation at hand
None have ever witnessed a beauty so grand
A mixture of my deepest desires
The rebirth of a forgotten fire

As king and queen
Or pawns in a greater scheme
