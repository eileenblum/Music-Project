As I depart from this mortal coil
The fragments of my existence
Are laid to rest in barren soil
As the sun fades in the distance

I am nothing

The pouring rains
Have washed away the cross
And all bloodstains
Accursed phantoms of loss

Amidst demise
These blackened skies

Silence the embers
Blinding his weary eyes
Maddened with tales
Of a foolâs paradise

For it was fire
And all the lies it told
That through desire
Bound him to days of old

Heavens will shatter
In the twilight of the end
Stars will collide, everything dies
Darkness descends

The sun erased
Devoid of reason to rise
A moment traced
Throughout benighted skies

All that prevails
Is sheer impurity
The rotting wound, that all consumes
In obscurity

Consumed by anguish
Drowning in regret
Abandoned to languish
Of salvation bereft

This bleak horizon
Of morrow absent
Sorrow that rises
Above the firmament

The heavens shatter
In the twilight of the end
The stars collide, everything dies
Darkness descends

The sun erased
Devoid of reason to rise
A moment traced
Throughout benighted skies

All that prevails
Is sheer impurity
The rotting wound, that all consumes
In obscurity

The tomb he carved as a monument to mourning
Is ill-adorned by ten thousand forms of suffering

The sterile seeds of such calamity
Mundanity of one possessed
What never was can only be
Merely wishful thinking, at best

To sleep, perchance to dream
In oblivionâs bleak infinity
So it seems, nothing can be redeemed
Thus I am laid to rest for eternity

To sleep, the chance to dream
Was declared as yet another fantasy
So it seems, nothing can be redeemed
Thus I am laid to rest for eternity
