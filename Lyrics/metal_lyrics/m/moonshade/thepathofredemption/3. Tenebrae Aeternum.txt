Demonic, glorious
Sanctified denial
Rottened, bewildered
By Morpheus's veil

Upon thee comes the night
Awakened blood omen
As light turns to darkness
For this sin known as Man

Judgment, come before me
Enlight our path of wrong
Whisper words of hatred
Of sanity long gone

Descend, oh blessed night
We'll perish before long
Thunder clouds, fill the sky,
Sing us our final song!

Tenebrae aeternum
Mortis vir ensiferum

Repent in the cries
Of thy own demise
Guilt sweetens the tears
That stench of thou fear

Repent in the cries
Of the worlds demise
Regret for thou lust
As ashes turn to dust

Purify
The known world
So this curse
Can be banned

Punishment
Redemption
Will heal this
Tainted land

Witness all the pleas
Of forgiveness, undone
Yield to the power
Of this curse to come

Sound of the seventh trumpet
Hail the apocalypse
Dethrone these dictators
Merciless forsakers

Sound of the seventh trumpet
Ultimate curtain call
Dethrone these dictators merciless forsakers

Of our world
