Slice the ties that bind me in reality
I've no wish for this never ending pain
Know all thee who walk this darkened road
Misery shan't enter our domain

Heaven descend with all thy might
Cruel be thou fate, the way of light
Blinding the weakest souls in temptation
On the path of ultimate damnation

Feed theses eyes so blind
This encephalic shell
Hollow since thy dawn
Forever doomed to Hell

Forsake all those who see through the fog
May they be stranded in eternal doom
Erase from my mind all the mayhem
Denial is the seed from which happiness blooms

Heaven descend in all thy might
Cruel be thou fate, the way of light
Blinding the weakest souls in temptation
On the path of ultimate damnation

Shield these thoughts from me
Drowned in thy mercy
Crucified denial
Will vanquish this trial

Heaven descend in all thy might
Cruel be thou fate, the way of light
Blinding the weakest souls in temptation
On the path of ultimate damnation
