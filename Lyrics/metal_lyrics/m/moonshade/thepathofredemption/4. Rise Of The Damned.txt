As all light fades
Gone without a trace
May the world wither
As shadows take place

May the world wither as shadows take place

Darkness descend
Upon this land
Scream, all silenced
Rise, all those damned

As we walk through the dusk
Towards this sacred night

Oh, walking corpse
Drain these thoughts
This goblet of fire
Of ways so lost

Cradle in my arms
For a while
Burn the fake cross
Of thoughts defiled

May God forbid
All that I am
Kneel before this
Rise of the damned

Insurge against all those lies,
Thoughts mechanical

Oh, silent lamb
Take this life
Of echoes of blood
Of tainted strife

Honor thy will
Own thy fate
Truth shall prevail
Through the hate
