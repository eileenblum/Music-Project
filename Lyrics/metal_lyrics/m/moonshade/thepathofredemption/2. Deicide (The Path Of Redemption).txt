Don't tell me to run, don't tell me to hide, I am the one with no fear
Don't tell me to fight, to aim for the light, I won't shed even a tear
Don't tell to learn, don't tell to see, for I'll never bow down to you
Don't tell me to seek, don't tell me to keep, all that I believed to be to be true

Through the eyes of a Sinner like me
I see it all, all your insanity
Through the eyes of a Sinner like me
I see it all, all your profanity

As I rise from denial, my ultimate trial, destroy your darkness within
As I bury my shame, let go of the blame, I realize the meaning of sin
As I bury my pride, my beliefs have died, freedom as just at my reach
So don't tell me to pray, I've got nothing to say for all the words you preach

To be one who crawls to me
For I'm the only sacrifice

To be the one who runs from me
As I deny the book of Christ

To be the one, the one to see
No weakness in this heart of mine

To call my name, to hear your plea
As you fight to earn Charon's dime

A warrior, in my demise
To end all your hypocrisy

Your sacred Reich is bound to fail
Fall to the ground for all to see

There's no Heaven, there's no Zion
But still you kill in the name of God

As I move on, you're dead and gone
Thoughts lost in the land of Nod

Don't tell me to run, don't tell me to hide, I am the one with no fear
Tell me to kill, for all that I will, now I know that my path is clear
Don't tell me to learn, don't tell me to see, I'll never bow down to
Or your sickened mind games, infecting my veins, poisoning the blood flowing through
