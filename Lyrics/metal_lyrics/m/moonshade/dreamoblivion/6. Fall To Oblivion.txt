Death comes down

Disease holding hands with death
As paranoia suffocates us
War shreds all within its path
Enthroned hatred originates

Bodies paving ruined streets
Drowning in a grave of lies
Rising towards impending doom
Chorused by children's cries

Can someone tell me where to look
Amidst this madness
A world surrendered to the void
Engulfed by wings, oh so black

As I decay
Absent solace
From a world
So devious

As blood spills on these pages
Imprisoning ghosts inside my head
Holding on by a single thread
I weep for the songs of old

The passing of the ages
Weighs the cross I have to bear
For these fears have me ensnared
Trapped inside a life so cold

Violence dictates a world
Of souls living in vain
Madness takes its toll
For all the hope that has been slain

I decay
Destined countdown
Shrouded in anguish
Absent forgiveness

Can someone tell me where to look
Amidst this madness
A world surrendered to the void
Engulfed by wings, oh so black

And so I feel
Within my core
Death is alive
For evermore
