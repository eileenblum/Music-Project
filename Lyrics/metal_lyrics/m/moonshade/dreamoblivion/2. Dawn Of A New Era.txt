I rise in redemption, followed by these thoughts so vile
Defying all Iâve known in life-long solace and denial
Fists risen in anger, howling songs towards the moon
Free me from these shackles, for with reason Iâll commune

Souls gone astray envision catastrophe
Scenery set for our loss of identity

Truth shattered by lies uncovered, shining through
This judgment oh, so dire
Guiding us through hellfire

Pain that tortures me, yet I long to see
Better days slither through sorrow
Devour the hollow

Endless nightmare
Haunting my deathbed
Dreams of despair
Take my life instead

All your prayers
Reek of unconcern
Save your tears
Hypocrites shall burn

Lost in shadows
Oblivion
Cry, undelivered
Unrepentant

Souls gone astray envision catastrophe
Scenery set for our loss of identity
