Serpent deity, goddess of Vision
Eternal temptress of enlightenment
Come to us, in eternal wisdom
Truth being thy only commandment

Forbidden fruit
Open the eyes of the blind
Soil thyself
Upon the filth our kind

Dawn awakes thee to life
So arise, coming undone
And look down, with shame
To the evil that has been done

By the light that fades
From within, for what we've become
Take hold of my hand
Witness the chaos we condone

Under thy shade
Tree Of Wisdom
Witness the lies
Of Heaven's sons

Dawn awakes thee to life
So arise, coming undone
And look down, with shame
To the evil that has been done

By the light that fades
From within, for what we've become
Take hold of my hand
Witness the chaos we condone

Paint the skies in grey

We shall not fall, for we are the chosen legacy
The blessed, destined to ride the Beast with our wrath
In time, all the worldâs blindfolds shall wither
Raise thy fists, to walk the path of the Libra

Liars, sinners, traitors
Wallow in shame
Liars, sinners, traitors
You're all to blame

Crucified, dead inside
Torn apart, Iâve denied

All that I am, you'll never be
Cradled by the arms of disonesty
Wallow in shame, weâre all to blame
Call upon your saints to abide you
From all the evil that youâve done
In the course of your life
