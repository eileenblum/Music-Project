Sitting burning
Waiting for someone to save me from myself
A life lived in darkness
No light
Ever shines through
I feel myself breaking
Keep on fucking breaking down
Dark days are closing in
Fucking breaking down
You
You just sit and watch
Never know what you'll find
Until you've reached the end
I can see it all coming down
I can see it's all gonna end

Sitting
Burning
Waiting for someone
To save me
From my
From myself
