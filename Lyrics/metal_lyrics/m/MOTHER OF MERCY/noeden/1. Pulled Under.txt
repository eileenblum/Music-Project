Sinking deeper as I fall in the ground
No hope in anything I found
Trying to claw my way back to the light
I'm all alone
In this fight

Pulled down to the lowest depths
The life sucked from me again
Trying to claw my way back to the light
I'm all alone
In this fight

Scratching
Clawing
Trying to make my way out
Fighting
Losing
I keep on falling
Down
