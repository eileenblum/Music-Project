I try to forget
But everything catches up to me
Reminds me
I'll never be able to get past
What I left behind
What I left behind again
Something I won't see again
There's nothing to go back to
Everything is fucked
Everything just came apart
It all just fell the fuck apart
There's parts of me I'll never see again
You made a liar
Out of me
I just wanna forget
Get past regret
