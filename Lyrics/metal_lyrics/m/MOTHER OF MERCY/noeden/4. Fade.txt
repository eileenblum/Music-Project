Took the fall too many times
Put my faith in far too many lies
I'm left all alone to wonder why
Why it's always me that's left behind
I can't see a fucking reason why
Stuck wondering how this happened again
I can't pretend I can't look past
Everything I tried to leave
In the past

I can't see or understand
How I'm left alone in the end
I took the fall too many times
put my faith in far too many lies
I'm left alone
To wonder why
Why it's always me that's left behind
I can't pretend I can't look past
Everything I tried to leave in the past
