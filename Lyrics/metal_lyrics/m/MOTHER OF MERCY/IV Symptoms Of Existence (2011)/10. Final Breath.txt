In the dying hours
Before life is gone
Tell me what I would see
A quick silent release
A slow struggle alone
I wasnât there
And now Iâll never know
What did you think of?
Who did you forget?
Did you wake up and take a final breath?
Now all that Iâm left with are unanswered questions
That I think about everyday
I canât move ahead
I just stay the same
I keep looking back and think of whoâs to blame
Itâs no one fault
What Iâm forced to think
Thatâs not something I can accept
Consumes every thought
Every memory
I canât let it out of my head
Constant reminders
Surround me everyday
I canât make this ever go away
Did you wake up and take a final breath?
I canât forget
