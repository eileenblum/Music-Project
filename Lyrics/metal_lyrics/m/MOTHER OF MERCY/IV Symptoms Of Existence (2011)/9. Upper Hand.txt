Youâre a liar
Youâre a thief
I wanna nail you down
Take back what you took from me
Lie, cheat, steal
Do whatever you can
Youâve done it all just to gain the upper hand
Now itâs my turn
Youâll be the one that burns
You canât justify
You canât make it right
You canât justify
And make it alright
Iâve waited too long
And Iâve grown tired of all the excuses
Spent too many sleepless nights struggling to decide what to do
Youâre a thief
I wanna nail you down
Take back what you took from me
I can only take this for so long
You wonât admit that you were wrong
Iâm gonna make you see the way things are to me
You canât justify
You canât make it right
You canât justify and make it alright
Lie, cheat, steal
Do whatever you can
Youâve done it all just to get the upper hand
Now itâs my turn
Youâll be the one that burns
You donât know whatâs best for me
Who are you to decide?
We all get what we deserve
Itâs just a matter of time
