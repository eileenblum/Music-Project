I try to control whatâs in my mind
Run out of solutions
This is my only way to leave it behind
The lights go out
The chairs kicked out
Reach out with both hands
Never able to break free
Locked away in a dark room
Choking the life from me
I feel it burn
Scars into my neck
Digging deeper
Rope against my flesh
The light goes out
The chairs kicked out
It keeps getting shorter
All hope is fading fast
Iâve given up
This is my way out
