Show me hell
Show me torment
Show me pain
Iâll show you hell
Iâll show you torment
And all my pain
Scars-hidden-buried inside
Lifeless
Eyes
Staring inside
Inside
In a world of hurt
Unending pain
I bring more hurt
Just to endure more pain
Iâll drag you down
Through the dirt so you canât breathe
With the rotting bodies
Youâve forgotten but no me
Look through my eyes and tell me
What do you see?
Death everywhere you look
It wonât forget me
World
Of
Pain
Show me hell
Show me your pain
Iâll show you hell
Iâll show you pain
