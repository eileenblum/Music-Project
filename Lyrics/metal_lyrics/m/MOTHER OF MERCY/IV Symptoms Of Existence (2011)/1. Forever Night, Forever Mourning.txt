Ripped
From the solace you gave me
Thereâs no way this worldâs gonna save me
When the night came to take you away
It cast shadows in my mind
Crept closer each day in pain
Forever night, forever mourning
In this misery
Nothing could ever help me
No one could ever save me
No light, perpetual dark
Only fire in my soul burns my body through gray dusk
A dismal void, a blackened cell
Descend this endless chasm to my hell
Forever night
Forever mourning
