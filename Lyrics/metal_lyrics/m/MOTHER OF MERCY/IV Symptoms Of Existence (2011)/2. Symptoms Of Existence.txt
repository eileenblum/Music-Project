Symptoms of existence
I stand face to face with the flame
Tormenting revelation
Never free from the pain
Abandon all pleasures desire
Skin and bone burn with the fire
Life was the only mistake
Death is the only escape
Symptoms of existence
I stand face to face with the flame
Broken and defeated
Crushed under unbearable weight
Abandon all pleasures desire
Skin and bone burn with the fire
Life was the only mistake
Death is the only escape
Pulled from the womb
To fall into the ground
Symptoms of existence
A life insufferable
