Staring out
Nothing there
Only dark everywhere
Try to look
I canât see
Ripped apart, taken from me
Live through darkness
I stare in silence and close my eyes
Save the pain and say goodbye
Worlds on fire
Iâm burned alive
Thereâs no solace, no one survives
Live through darkness
Stare in silence and close my eyes
Save the pain and say goodbye
Worlds on fire, Iâm burned alive
Thereâs no solace, no one survives
Live through darkness
