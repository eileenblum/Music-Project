Become someone I just canât recognize
Were you ever even what I thought?
You took everything
So whatâs left for me?
You took everything
Thereâs nothing left in me
Take it away, take it away
Itâs all worth nothing anyway
Keep me away, keep me away
Iâm worth nothing anyway
How can someone ever be so selfish?
Itâs so clear to everyone
So clear to everyone
So fucking clear
That you are wrong
When the day comes
And you finally understand
Iâll be there to spit in your face
Iâll be there to watch you drown
