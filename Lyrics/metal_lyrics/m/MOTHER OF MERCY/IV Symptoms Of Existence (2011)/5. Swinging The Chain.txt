Savor the blood as it spills from my mouth
No pity for me
âCause I did this myself
Torch the funeral pyre
Where I already lie
Make sure to tell the priest I didnât want a goodbye
Swinging the chain
Pull the chord, let the blade fall
No time for regret
Iâm through with it all
Hammer in my nails and send me out to sea
Let the ones down below
Have whatâs left of me
Swinging the chain
Burn in my throat
Wonât ever subside
Feel the pain
Swing the chain
Swinging the chain
Thatâs wrapped round my neck
Time stands still
When youâre choking to death
Life brings pain
Only so much each day
Accelerate your demise
Swinging the chain
