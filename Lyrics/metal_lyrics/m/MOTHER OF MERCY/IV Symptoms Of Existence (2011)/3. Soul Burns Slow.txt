Hopeless
Canât make it through this
No longer feeling
The feelings passed
Helpless
No way around this
No longer healing
Canât heal the past
Stuck
Inside
Try to break away but something holds me back
A mental block I canât escape
Keeps me from choosing a path
Repeat mistakes to spite myself
Canât stand the sight of my face
A losing race Iâll never win
But itâs one I know I can control
Stuck
Stuck inside
Soul burns slow, I feel the flames rise and burn me alive
Thereâs no way to survive
Sit and stare, pretend to care
But youâre not even there
Not even there
A crushing weight Iâm forced to lift and put onto my back and itâs about to snap
An empty hope that went broke and sent me out on my own so Iâll do this
All alone
Hopeless
I feel so hopeless
No one can help this
Feeling of hopelessness
