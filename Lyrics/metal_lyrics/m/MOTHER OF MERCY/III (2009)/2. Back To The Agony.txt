back from the depths
i found myself lying in
endless regrets
i felt myself dying in
stuck between where i am
and what i was
back to the start
this is the end

back to the agony
back to the start
back to the agony
i'm pulled apart

back to the surface
to reap what i've sown
into the dark
the lonely unknown
stuck between where i am
and what i was
back to the start
facing the end

i'm coming back
back to the agony
