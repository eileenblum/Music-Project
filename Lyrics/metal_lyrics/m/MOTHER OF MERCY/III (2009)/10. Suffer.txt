suffer
i suffer beneath
the surface
watching everyone pass me by
crawling
on my hands
and
knees
disgusted
with what i've seen

it falls apart
it's split at the seams
i'm left to suffer beneath
the surface

suffer
i suffer beneath
the surface
watching everyone pass me by
crawling
on my hands
and
knees
disgusted
with what i've seen

suffer beneath
suffer beneath

suffer the agony
