turn blind eyes
don't wanna see what i've done
don't wanna be me
see what i've become
darkness follows
left in the cold
an emtpy shell
a lifeless soul

days go by
it's getting dark
fading fast
under a cold sun

turn blind eyes
don't wanna see what i've done
don't wanna be me
see what i've become

days go by
it's getting dark
fading fast
under a cold sun

can't escape it
can't erase it
can't cope with what
i can't see
