i've seen the divide
grow everyday
in front of my eyes
slipping away
open my hands
try to reach out
you shut me down
and lock me out
try to make sense
believe my own lies
i'm feeling it now
feel the divide

hollowed out
broken down

i've seen the divide
grow everyday
in front of my eyes
slipping away
open my hands
try to reach out
you shut me down
and lock me out

hollowed out
broken down

i've seen the divide
grow everyday
in front of my eyes
slipping away
