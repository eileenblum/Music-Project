trapped underneath the weight
burdens me everyday
beating me into the ground
sucking me under
beneath the surface
where i won't ever be found

it eats away
at me
it eats away at me
left to burn alone
left here on my own

throwing myself
headfirst into my own grave
that i helped create
no one
no one to hear me
no one to hear me
no one is here

it eats away
at me
it eats away at me
left to burn alone
left here on my own

no one to hear me
no one is here
