time changes nothing just adds to the suffering
it's burning me inside and out
i've got scars to prove
what i say is true
can't seem to get past this self doubt
time changes nothing just adds to the suffering
it's burning me inside and out
i've got scars to prove
what i say is true
can't seem to get rid of self doubt
my own cold hands
wrapped around my neck
try to reach out
there's nothing left
picking up the scraps but there's nothing
left for me
looking for someone to help me
there's no one left but me
inside and out
