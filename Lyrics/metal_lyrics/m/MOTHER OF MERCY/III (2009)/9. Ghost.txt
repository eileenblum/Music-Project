cold and desperate
you're all alone
it's too late now
you're too far gone

i'm the cause
the reason for this pain
the one who whispers things inside your brain
what makes you think that i could ever help
you know that i could never save myself

i'm not sorry
i'm not sorry

your world's shattered
you feel like there's no hope for you
death's cold hand coming soon
there's nothing you can do
