seeking comfort
in things that hurt me
isolation
and solitude
no escape
from these black skies
only hollowed
out insides
this soul
not my own
mine left
long ago
no one
left to hurt
alone
no one to hurt
staying in shadows
far away from you
look inside me
you'll find the noose
the reason why
i act this way
the reason why
we're not the same
don't look at me
cuz i'm not me
black skies
cover me
