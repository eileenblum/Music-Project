slipping into the grip of something
that i can't control
try to escape it
but i just slip again
and lose control

i slipped again and lost control

every good thing goes away
i'm left with empty hands
desperation setting in
i slip again and lose my mind

i slipped again and lost my mind

lose control
i just lost control

slipping
from
my hands
