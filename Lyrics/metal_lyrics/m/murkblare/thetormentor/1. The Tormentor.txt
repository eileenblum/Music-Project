This integrated rage,
The demon aggravates,
Left behind spawning cynical conviction,
Sick humane desist,
The creature liberates,
Agonized concentrated will of destruction.

Burn in the flame of subliminal cruses,
For you've distorted the peace within my soul.

Diligently crafted subtle incineration is evident,
Prepare yourself to find solace in hell.

Storm just a preface,
The wrath i hold within,
And it only get worse from here no pardons,
No mercy no forgiveness,
Hail the balancing of the sins.

And I'll resurrect the pain,
'Cause you has got enough to pay,
And you will surrender,
'Cause I'm your Tormentor!

Feel yourself becoming none,
As you succumb to my audacity,
I've got the forces like none,
You may run,
But you can't hide from me,
Can't hide from me,
I'm the colossus of ultimate power,
I worship the lord of fear,
Twisted fate served with misery,
And no one there to see,
No one there to see,

Burn in the flames.

About time you bitch,
Let me remind you,
The fallacies,
Everything I've been through,
Look deep in my swollen and bleeding eyes,
And its now your time to realize,
That every word left unsaid,
Ran back and forth echoed in my head,
And this never ending silence shaped me,
So let this power of demon unleash,

And I'll resurrect the pain,
'Cause you has got enough to pay,
And you will surrender,
'Cause I'm your Tormentor!

Burn in the flame of subliminal cruses,
For you've distorted the peace within my soul.
