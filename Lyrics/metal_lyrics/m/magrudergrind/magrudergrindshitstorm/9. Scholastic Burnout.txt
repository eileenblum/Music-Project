Woke up
Looked in the mirror
His blurry image stared back at him
Not remembering where he was the night before
His flip-up hat out of sight
Covered in steel reverse
From head to floor
Pounding headache
Blood red sockets
Screeching eardrums
Beer soaked pockets
He could not remember
Where he was the night before
He just saw Magrudergrind
The first night of their tour
