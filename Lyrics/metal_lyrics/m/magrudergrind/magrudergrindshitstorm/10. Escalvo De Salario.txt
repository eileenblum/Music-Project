Suit &amp; tie
Secretary's out to buy
A Delicious lunch for the guys
Earl Johnson's day is going great
Another successful day at the office
Earlier today, just picked up his brand new shirt
White dry cleaned and pressed
Lunch comes in McDonald's bag in hand
Grease leaking out like blood of a freshly killed 500 pound grass consumer
Shelly comes by to exchange capital for the lunch but something horrible happens
Shelly trips
Bag Rips
Blood red ketchup all over Earl
Burger splatters on the flood - Pickles, mayo
No tomatoes all over the place
Cow blood on his face
His feast of meat ceases to be
