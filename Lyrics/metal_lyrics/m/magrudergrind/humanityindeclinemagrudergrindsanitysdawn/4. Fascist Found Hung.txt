In 1945
A fascist man fled his home
To escape persecution
He fled to South American land
His hands covered in the bluff
In the blood of women &amp; kids
He was only 'following orders'
To mass murder innocent people
no genocide could ever be forgotten
No millions of innocent faces could ever leave
His skull
So he hangs himself to let everything go
Everything go
