The disease progresses
Through their veins
The accept

Each breath comes closer to death
Injected sickness
Contracted against their will
A human guinea pig
Victim of schizophrenic
Dictator hired physician
War of nations becomes
An internal conflict
A conflict between
Their internal organs
Their immune system
Begins to shut down
Their bodily fluids
Begin to come out
Contracted against their will
A human guinea pig
Victim of a schizophrenic
Government hired physician
Injected sickness
Sociopathic institutions
