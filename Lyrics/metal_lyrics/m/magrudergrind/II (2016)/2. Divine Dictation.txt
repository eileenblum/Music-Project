Consecrated by the hand of the holy one
A declaration
A lineage direct and divine

Rule of law based on
The monarch's decree
Liberties, crushed and abolished
God is a tool and a method to control
The holiest and most God-fearing
Are the first to go and slay
A witch-hunt powers encroaching
And coming for you
Heresies emancipation suppression
Divine dictation
Instill the fear of God
Created to suppress,
Dictate and control
