A self-fulfilling prophecy
To destroy everything
That seems to fit in its place

Rejecting an ability
To embrace any moment
Bound to a conditioning
Hardwired with a limitation
Cursed by a weighted down frustration
A life lived wishing for a salvation
Why does it have to always end up broken?
Why can't it ever be harmonious?
