We see right through you
Every word exposes truth
Your complex scheme

Comes to a head
Old allies now
Become your threat
You seek hiding
In fear of reprisal
Anxiety closes in
As the hunters
Build your trial
Nowhere to run
We're closing in
You gasp for air
Your reality is total despair
We have you in our sights
We're quickly gaining ground
You're losing motivation
We're got you hunted down
Down
