Why do we throw away the keys
To generations of non-criminals
Wrongly locked up and put in cells?

What is the social price
And who benefits from it?
Youth potential vacuumed
And assets wrongly seized
Incarceration state
Absurd judiciaries
Capital wasted in endless cycles
Instead of investing in mental health
Monetary and social returns
By allocating smarter
The prison industrial complex
Must be reformed
