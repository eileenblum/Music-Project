History repeats itself
Scapegoat throughout history
Over and over,

Slaughtered and smeared
Again and again,
Defamation, slander and libels
Same old tactics
New generation of propagandists
Why didn't you defend yourself?
Why didn't you take up arms?
Now you defend yourself
You are the "perpetrator!"
The victim once again demonized
A new face for the lie
And now legitimized
The biggest fraud of modern times
Syndicated on the world stage
The biggest fraud of modern times
Repudiation not self-determination
The biggest fraud of modern times
No peace, only war of annihilation
The biggest fraud of modern times
The world sides with doctrine of death
