The march continues on and on every battle won
Take no prisoners, advance forward as every border falls

Strike the Earth with a janbiya, another district taken
The authority grows stronger with every passing day

New rule of law declared throughout
Subjugate, slay and rape
Decimate their history
Burn their books and burn their towns
Bulldoze their monuments and destroy their proof of life
Concentrate all their men
Execute them in the city square
Wrap their women from head to toe
The holy scripture commands to do so
The black banner occupies another foreign jurisdiction
The march continues on and on with every battle won

Strike the Earth with a janbiya another district taken
The authority grows stronger with every passing day
