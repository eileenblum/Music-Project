They are your horror
They are your comfort
They creep into

Every facet of your life
You joined the movement
Counting down the days
Until your suicide
Fearful of showing opposition
Horrified that they will
Slaughter your kin
Wishing for death
Praying for the day
That you go to die
To fulfill your deed
To destroy your enemy
A devotion to the eradication
Of free thought
They tell you to kill yourself
For sake of the larger cause
Indoctrinated since the day of your Conception
With the rest of your generation
Like the cohorts that
Came before you
Discount the living and welcome
A death drenched
in martyrdom
A senseless death
In a pointless cause
