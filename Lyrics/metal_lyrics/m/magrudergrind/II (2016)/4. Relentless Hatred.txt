This hate is relentless and so deep-seated
It's rightful, it's earned, it's addicting
It stretches back centuries

It digs into bloodlines of tormentation
Yearning to uproot and decimate
The lineage of cowards
And perpetrators always
Cloaked as the pious clerics
Seeds so violent sown and internalized
A revenge so deep it turns formalized
Every moment crushed
A sorrow felt through the heart
Drilled into the psyche
A woe shared generations apart
A disgust so deep and profound
A vengeance seeking action
Retribution
Peel back the facade and expose
This human filth
Isolate it, hate it, wipe any trace of it away
