Another dose
Sedates the urges
The liquid flows

A new high surges
It all started out
With a doctor's note
A prescription wrote
For legal dope
A visit to the local pharmacy
And a prayer to change
And wishful hope
Anxiety disorder?
Swallow klonopins
Down your throat
Stress from work?
The pharmacy's got
The perfect cure
Medical advice
Without understanding
Convincing ourselves
That we lack any self control
Self discipline triumphed
The medicinal path commands
The mind and agency fail
Mind and agency fail
Anxiety disorder?
Swallow klonopins
Down your throat
Stress from work?
The pharmacy's got
The perfect cure
Addiction feeble mind
Frail infrastructure
