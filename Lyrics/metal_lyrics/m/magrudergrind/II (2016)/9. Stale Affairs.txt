Another empty threat
Another cry for help
One more trivial contention

One last argument
Pushed to my breaking point
Used me as your
Emotional resolve
Excuses will only go so far
Abuse my trust and blame
That your life's so scarred
Everyone has their own
Issues and baggage
What makes you think
You can dump yours on me?
