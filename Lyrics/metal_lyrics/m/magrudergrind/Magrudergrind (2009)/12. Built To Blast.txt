take a trip - to a distant place - across the
sea - with no boundaries
look across the fields of rice - skit ride
like a rural flight
baht paid for a muay thai fight - without
vinegar balut is not right
monkeys east at the caves of the bats - buko
pies will make you fat 
fines you'll pay if you decide to spit
the south east asian scene is the shit
take a trip - to a distant place - across the 
sea - with no boundaries
bootlegging shirts in the name of DIY
south east asian scene will always survive

[sound clip from Trailer Park Boys]
