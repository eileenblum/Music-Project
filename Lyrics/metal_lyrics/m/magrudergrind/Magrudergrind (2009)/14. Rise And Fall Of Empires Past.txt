economy has bombed
banking markets gone
life as you once knew it-
a nation no longer strong
every empire has its rise and falls
lessons of history
crossed out like a scrawl
depression hits as happiness plummets
utility of life ceases to a crawl
lessons of history 
crossed out like scrawl
utility of life ceases to a fucking crawl
the rise and fall of empires
the downfall of empires
the downfall of mankind
