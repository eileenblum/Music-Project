a continent torn by war and hate
fascist rule decides innocent fate
centuries past of propagation lies
ignorance allows people to turn an eye
invasion strikes as most are allowed to live
hell has begun for the victims of hateful lies
the ones who hid saw their homes looted by
their former neighbors who believed those lies

never forget the martyrs of the shoah
for their lives were taken by the hands of hate
don't ever forget each and every human
for their were millions murdered in the camps of death

slave labor used as a tool under nazi rule
before a village stood - now a mass grave cesspool
railroads align to a place of death
bystanders watch as the trains are filled
life as they knew it was stripped from their grasp
families torn as the chambers fill with gas

never forget the martyrs of the shoah
for their lives were taken by the hands of hate
don't ever forget each and every human
for their were millions murdered in the camps of death
