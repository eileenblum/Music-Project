pessimism overtakes the free-
living in total agony
life as a beggar - no incentive to progress
leaching off society - a claim to call it 
euphoria
just an excuse to live a wasted lazy youth
uniting to fight a revolution
a revolution priced as a decline of life
uniting to fight a revolution
it's not a revolution but a life of strife
it's the cost of living by delinquent ideals
the ideals of life so out of touch
with reality and the churning of misery
resolves in the dilution a blindfold over
the mind
uniting to fight a revolution
a revolution priced as a decline of life
uniting to fight a revolution
it's not a revolution but a life of strife
