the decline of estate
comes with racial ties
liquor stores corrupt police and
mothers cries
depreciation - of neighborhoods
exploitation - through gentrification
but why do they turn a blind eye
a youth brought up with prosperity and
relative luxuries
while pledging a plight of words which
contradict their actions

[sound clip from Boyz N the Hood]
