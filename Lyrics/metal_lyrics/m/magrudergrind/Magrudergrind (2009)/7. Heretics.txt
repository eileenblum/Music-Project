burned at the stake for the
accusation of heresy
endless torture till victims
developed stories
undeserving sentencing out of 
religious animosity
christian ethnography of killing
the false accused
a religion based on the murder of heretics
the name of christ used as a tool of death
history tied into endless violence
hate and war based on
the creed of the church
heretics nailed to a crucifix
blood of christ a staple of death
religious fraud rhetoric of the pope
lies and murder for profit
