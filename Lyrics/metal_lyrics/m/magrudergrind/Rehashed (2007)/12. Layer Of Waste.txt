Leech off of those
Who lend you their hand
Nothing in return
Scabies &amp; shitty jams

Spange off the rich
That's fine by me
Don't ask the pinks
For their money

Layer of waste
What a waste of life

You fuck up our shows
You fuck up my house
You're starving your animals
You're starving yourself

You're a waste of life

Instead of shooting up
Why don't you feed your dogs?
