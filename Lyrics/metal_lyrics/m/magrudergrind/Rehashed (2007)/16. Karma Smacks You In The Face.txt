It's just another day
Same routine
Strive to impress
Withers away
I'm living my life
For someone else
No feeling of notice
An obsolete hope

Time was spent
It was wasted away
Intellectual spark
together was prime
No sexual escapades
Learned each others lives
Time flew by fast
Now your gone
With the past

Looking behind, regretting precious time,
Mislead my life, in my mind your now dead

On my own
I'm just fine
The thought of you
Disbursed my mind
