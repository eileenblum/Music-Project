Lying about age
Stealing from friends
Burned every bridge
When will it fucking end?

Selfish deeds in the way
Parental dependence sways
Financial sources are stripped &amp; now you're ripping off friends

You lost respect from everyone
You're in isolation
You stole from people you called friends
You're a fucking thief
You lied just to gain acceptance
You're all a joke
You lied just to win acceptance
Alone

You're all alone
