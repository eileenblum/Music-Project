Please shut
Your mouth
I don't feel like
(Hearing it)
The words are coming
Out of you
Are total shit
Bullshit

I'm trying to finish my work
Your preaching is a waste
Of your breath
You talk down on my life
Yet your own is a
Fucking mess

Please shut
Your mouth
I don't feel like
Hearing it
The words coming
Out of you
Are total fucking
bullshit

You're constantly distracting my thought
With reasons of this &amp; that
It's ignorant
When someone questions your beliefs
You can't handle it
Cause you're full of shit

Raised through intolerant narrow mindlessness
Conditioned to the non-expectance of others

Your ignorance has gone too far
