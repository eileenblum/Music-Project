Pain

My mind, keeps on drifting away
In a time when I need it the most
When I don't want to think
It stays like a horrible dream

&amp; I can't seem to get a grip
Drifting away
When concentration never endingly slips
Drifting away
I've been on this road so many times to say
Drifting away
It never endingly slips

Drifting
