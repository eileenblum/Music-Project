Your beliefs &amp; your preaching
Are like the changing seasons
Depending on who your with
Fashion shows your lacks of depths

Taste in genre changes
Parallel to the way you dress
One week a wasted drunk
Next week a straight edge punk

Lack of identity
Lack of purpose
When acting like a fake
True colors show
