Party thrash has been here &amp; past
Exploited it up &amp; gentrified the "fast"
Pizza, beer circle pits in the mass
You need to cut it out &amp; go back to class

Party thrash has been here &amp; pass
Exploited it up and gentrified the "fast"
Your need to cut out &amp; go back to class

Every, show just another fucking gimmick
Quit fucking ripping off riffs that first
Came in this

Cause when its time to deal with real life
Your stuck in a fake state of mind

Funds cut out, you need to straighten up
Supporting yourself, waking up to real life

Don't group me with that fucking shit
Cause I'm getting fucking sick of it

Don't group me with this fucking shit
Cause I'm not a fucking part of it

I'm getting sick of it
