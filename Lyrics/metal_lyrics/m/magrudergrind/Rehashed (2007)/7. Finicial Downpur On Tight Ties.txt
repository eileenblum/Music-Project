Financial downpour on tight ties

Why does it seem for once everything's fine?
Next morning I wake to more problems &amp; bins
Friends ripping off friends
Blood against blood
Your necks are fucking tied
Greed fills you inside

Constant money struggle
Till the day we die
Never ending lie
Never eye to eye

Eye to eye

Constant money struggle
Till the day we die
Never ending lie
Never eye to eye
