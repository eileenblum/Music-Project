You don't go to shows
'You're too busy'
You don't go to shows
Your time is wasted
You don't go to shows
Your time is wasted
On trying to look pretty
Money is spend
On make up and tight clothes

Sold your records, to buy coke
Sold your life. You're a fucking joke
Lost interest in life, Gave up no hope
Now life is a Goddamn joke
Joke

Gave up
No hope
