RESTLESS AND HELPLESS
ANGST FUNNELED INTO CONFLICT
STRESS IS SOCIAL COMMONALITY
OUTLIERS LIVE IN SILENCE
STAGNANT LIVES ARE SHORT LIVED
POVERTY ARISE, ASPIRATIONS DECAY
CHANGES SUPPRESSED AND LOCKED UP
EDUCATION DISMISSED CIVILITY DECLINED
TRUE MISERY IS DISPLACED
WITHERS BY OUR CONSCIOUS MINDS
TRUE MISERY IS DISPLACED
WITHERS BY OUR STAGNANT LIVES
POLICIES CREATED TO RID THE POOR DISEASE
RIDDING NOTHING AND CREATING AN ENDLESS CYCLE
ARE INSTITUTIONS OR THE GOVERNMENT TO BLAME?
OR SHOULD THE COMMON PEOPLE HANG THEIR HEADS IN SHAME?
