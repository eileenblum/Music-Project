HOW CAN WE GO ON WITH OUR LIVES, THRIVING OFF THE GOODS DEVISED BY OTHERS
LABOR?
HOW CAN YOU PASS THE TIME GUILTY-FREE AS YOU PLUCK THE WELFARE FROM THOSE
TRULLY IN NEED?
WHERE DO WE COME OFF THINKING, THAT WE ARE ENTITLED TO THE GOODS OF OTHERS?
HOW CAN YOU CRY TO ME, AS THOUGH THE SYSTEM HAS CRUSHED YOUR WILL TO LABOR?
ARE THESE THE ETHICS THAT WE FLAUNT IN THE CULTURE CALLED DIY? NO
WE DENY MANY OPPORTUNITIES YET COMPLAIN TO BE
MARGINALIZED
LEECH
