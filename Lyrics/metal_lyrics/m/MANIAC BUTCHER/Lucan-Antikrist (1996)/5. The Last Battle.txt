Dense files of Lucans,
Blood-thirsty barbarians
Are rushing worth
To intense onslaught

Defending adversaries
Adherents of Holy Church
Are drowned in their own blood
As just born kittens

Heads of Christians are cut
By axes of Lucans
Crosses from neck-stumps
Are stamped into dust

Heavy battle uproar
Fatal for believers
Fear in faces of Christ's servants
To flee? To surrender? Death is certain !!

Dawn of judgment day
Twillight of Act of God
The last battle
Death of Christianity !!
