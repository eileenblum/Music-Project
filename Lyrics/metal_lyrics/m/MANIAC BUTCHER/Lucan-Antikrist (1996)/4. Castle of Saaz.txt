In the real heart of Luka
In the centre of Midnight Empire
On steep bank
Over wild river

In dazzling glare
Of silver fullmoon
Towers of Castle of Saaz
Glitter by gold

The seat of mighty masters
Famous Lucan emperors
Symbol of paganism
Glorious Castle of Saaz

Place of gathering
Of antichristian forces
Nocturnal preparations
For last battle
