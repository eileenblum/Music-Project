String of messengers
Of Southern religion
In the name of Jesus
Son of new god

Aim of their pure journey
Free country
Plentiful and flowery,
Czech and Moravian

False mission
Mendacios Tongues
Invoking the cripple
Nailed to the cross

Self-appointed messiahs
Noninvited saviours
Love in their words
More treacherous than a dagger in back

Never performed promises
Donation - bribes
Betrayed trust
Devastated land
