The eve on the death bed
Preparation for the way to God
Firm belief in the salvation of soul
Readness to die

The whole life with faithfulness to the Master
Suffering from His trials
Wallowing in dust under His legs
For acquirement of His favour

The "loving" of enemies
Exposing of the other face
The humble surviving in fear
The boasting about suffering

But only one
Your real pleasure
Trust that your torturers
Won't avoid the hand of God

You are writhing in heavy convulsion
On the verge of agony
Whilst your night mares
Have still a lot of strenghts

Awakening from a dark dream
Just before the coming of eternal sleep
Disclosure of severe truth about God
Only too late...!

The loss of trust in the power of God
Misbelief in his justice
Life wasted in lies and fear
Late throwing off of Christian fetters

Sudden fear from death
The rage towards powerlessness of a dying body
Disinterest in confession and absolution
Only enormous longing for revenge

Awakening in death
Revenge instead of confession
Volcano of unbelief and hate
Erupts in your mind

You hate all livng people
Your only wish is the revenge upon them
You wasted your time - you are dying
You are leaving without revenge!
