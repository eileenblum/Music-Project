Anxiety from emptiness after life
Solution - the idea of eternal being
Devotion to belief in life after death
The bond of soul to God

The loss of need to fight
For the freedom and the right to opinion
Successful smoothing of all cerebral scrolls
Change to mere implement in church's hands

You have believed in their promises
Of immortality
You lost the most expensive thing
Which you have ever had
Life!
