The crusade to the Holy Land
Jerusalem - back for Christians
Defence of peace and faith
Holy war -the legitimate affair

Mohamed's prohecy, sons of Allah
And their holy duty
Eexpansion of the Koran by a crooked sabre
Holy war - the legitimate affair

Jahve and the wisdom of the rabbis
The licking of enemies' spittles
The legitimate affair
Holy war - bargain and usury

Jesus, Jahve, Allah
Palestine, Jerusalem, Izrael
Christian, Arab, Jew
Pagan dogs and the choosen nations

The holy war
From chalif's command
With pope's blessing
For rabbi's pleasure

The holy war
The struggle for true belief
The clamouring of peace
The thirst for blood

The holy war
Endless battles
Crucifying of prisoners
Jewish pogroms

The holy war
For Holy Land
Two of them fought
The third one laughed

The abortion of Christian church
Jerusalem in pagan's hands
Never mind - millions of Indians, Eskimos and negroes
Are waiting for the holy baptism

Jews - masters of Holy Land
Persecuted rats in the rest of the entire world
Sionism, antisemitism
Usury and pogroms

Descendants of emirs - street beggars
Desolate mosques
Longing for revenge, pugnacity in minds
Stones against airforce

The holy war
The impossible peace
The eternal hate
Pain and blood
