Christian Church
Creator of Hell
The banishment of all
Former heroes

True symbol of the light and the Sun
Thrown down into dark abyss
Christian God - bright lord
Lucipher - dark monster

Lucipher - dark monster
Leviathan - disgusting slimy serpent
Free and loose ones - heretics, stray lambs
Belial - dangerous rebel

The most gracious God
Shepherd, flock keeper
He makes only goodness and love
Hovever, whom work are pain and death...?

The missing of evil-maker
Who will be held liable...?
Satan - master of Hell
Symbol of hate, the incarnated evil

Christian Church
Creator of Hell
The kingdom of all
Mighty heroes
