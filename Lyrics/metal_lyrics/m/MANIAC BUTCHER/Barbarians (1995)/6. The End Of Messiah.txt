...master of cripples
king of weaklings,
by rights condemned to cross,
he will bear it and be put to death on it...

...king of terrestrial rabble
is going to death,
oh, christian riff-raff
reflect upon the burden of the cross...

...rotten legs sink
and rise again - stimulated by whip,
they put the thorn-crown on his head,
blood and brain flow out from stabs...

...they put him upon the cross,
pierce his limbs by spikes,
bleed him by pike in his side,
suck the poor life from his poor body...

...floks of crows pecked out the eyes,
brain and blood flowed out,
flies laid the eggs into the tlesh,
hyenas tore out the limbs...

...eaten out skull rolled down to the feet,
skeleton without flesh flashed under the sun,
then the bones spilled, whitened
and turned in the dust...
