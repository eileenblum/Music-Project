Disgusting scenery
Of limbs of sheep all around
Is already veiled
in freezing darkness of night

Funeral feast
Gathering of ravens
Around the silent landscape
A song of conceited ravens sounds

Our prey, our dinner
Full beaks, no hunger
We, ravens are mighty hunters
Sheeps, dread us, only us !!

Plentiful prey, rich dinners
We do not know what hunger is
We, ravens are mighty flock
We do not know what fear is !!
