The croaky sound
Of the mendacious song
Has been heard
By ear of Krvestreb

Unpardonable audacity
Clamours for cruel revenge
Necessity of more blood
Woe is raven flock

It is need
To set a frightening example
To demonstrate supreme power
To poor rabble

The most croaking raven
Is sent to Nhaavah
By one strong
Deadly stroke
