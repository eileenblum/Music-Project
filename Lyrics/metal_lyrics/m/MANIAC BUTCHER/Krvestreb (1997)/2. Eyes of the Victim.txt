As quick as lightning attack
Has not met with opposition
Red blood, still hot
Quench thirst of the hunter

Dying away eyes
Of the feeble victim
Repent bitterly
Voluntary death

Too late they see
That they will not get
Any promised help
From god of martyrs

Falcon Krvestreb
Free, unrestrained
Hunter of humble ones
Only one master of himself
