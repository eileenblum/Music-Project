From white Storming-mountains
To deep dark Krivoklat-forests
There is abundant landscape
Land forever called Luka

His kingdom, ample fatherland
From height inaccessible for
Another, is guarded
By sharp sight of...

...Falcon Krvestreb
Carnivorous bird of prey
The mighties emperor
Of azure sky

No God-fearing sheep
Is not sure of naked life
It depends only on his will
If he clutch at her by his claws
