Some are pleasant, some are not
The things our fate has brought
Fights and battles of all kinds
Man has to go through

One and every decision
Is forever my own vision
When to make generous retreat
When to uncover the sword's heat

Now as it's been for many times

One must make up his mind
Better to put army together
To annihilate the pest forever
