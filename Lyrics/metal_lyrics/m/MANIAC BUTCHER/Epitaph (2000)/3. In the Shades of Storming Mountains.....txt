For it corrupts all my pleasure
And tears my veins up, either
When the bunch of useless parasites
Is wolfing at my feast tonight

Roast is tasty
Whores are lusty
Being as the loot
For my bravest troops

Parasiting vermin
Which we will be hunting
So now my true servants
Find and kill the filthy rats
