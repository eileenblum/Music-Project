For cripples and lamers
And sluts that can be bought
Let's prepare execution
And their lives will be not

Their bodies as the bells
Let's hang along the borderline
When the rope is not enough
On the laundry-string they'll chime

Let them be a visible
Warning and sign
That this is kind of carrions
In my kingdom I deny
