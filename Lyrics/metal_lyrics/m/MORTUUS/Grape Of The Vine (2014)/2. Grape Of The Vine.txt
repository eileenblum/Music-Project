Sons of daughters of Cain
Unclean breed of the original murderer
Children of the wastelands
Of the poison of God, of the mother of abortions
Serpent born
Now turn against each hindering law of God

In the wilderness
North of edenic illusion
Via bridges that lead from the roots of the outer tree
- Sitra ahra begins to unveil
Awake, awake!
In invocation and still contemplation
For the soul becomes a cup
And the treasures of the night the wine therein

With eyes open wide
The fruit is like the grape of the vine
Death becomes the mother of life
As their sons and daughters give in to the most deviant perversion!

In the chalice of water above
The human number is divided in two
Rending the two-fold dwellers of the deep
In the abyss, a gate to worlds unexplored
The forbidden fruit of the outer tree
Liberates from the slave-like rest of Eden
The birth place and the temple of a world separated from God

Your sorrow, your suffering
Your pitiful longing for union!
Your efforts, your struggles
Tears and halos fall as rain from above
Drowning the world in a deluge of emptiness
The deep becomes the devourer
Can't you see what has risen here?
A paradise without restrictions!

We stare in awe through the seals
And let the speech of the light bearer in
To resonate in the darkest reaches of the human mind
Listen, oh listen!
To a voice older than human language
The serpent's promise
As alive and clear as its been for centuries
