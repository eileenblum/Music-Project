A slight scent of sulphur in the air
Voiceless prayers in the dark
The devil speaks while I lie asleep
And I hear
My every thought tainted with filth
My every thought tainted with blood
And I hear
The devil speaks while I lie asleep

Once again Satan is taking a new form
An anathema and blessing alike
Wisdom from nothingness
-How ironic these words must have been to Job!

A Christlike shape dissolves in the fire
They transform as one
A slight scent of sulphur in the room
But there is nothing here
There is nothing here!

In deep trance I lie wide awake
But this is not me, this is not me
This is not me!
My every thought tainted with filth
My every thought tainted with blood
My every thought tainted with filth
My every thought tainted with blood
