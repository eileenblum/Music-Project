The pendulum is set in motion
In a heart beat day has turned into night
For a second, for centuries or an aeon of being
In a fleeting state, fear wearies our hearts
Hopelessness is the water we drink
And though stained with demonic dirt
Our tears are molded in shaded existence
To be everlasting in their death
Footprints in the astral filth, sustained and saturated
In the dwelling houses of the damned

My heart is stained, it has been painted black
with fatal marks scars of damnation
Under the passage of the tower
The ravens of dispersion hover above
In the commotion of three broken shells
Baal dissolves
To form a black halo above my head

With the taste of grave soil still on my tongue
The pendulum is set in motion
And in a heartbeat I have turned into nothing
Surfacing in the unstirred void
Through a black hole in the lower sea
The fierce stream of physical death, it leaves me cold!
Rising as serpents encircling the shadow's spine

Only the ashes can tell
A god forming or flesh for daemons
Eaters of souls, distorted ones
Will I feast upon myself, or be the devoured hereafter?
Only the ashes can tell
Were we phoenix or men

And through the black mirror I stare
At his sharp blades shining in the shadows
Preparing the slaughter
Baal dissolves
Forming a black halo above my head
