In the center of the night
We become unable tell where the darkness end and we begin
Where worlds collide in bleak stains
Echoes of our intense calling resounds
Deeper and deeper, in places out of reach
The names called are breeding and multiplying through themselves
It leaves me numb with sheer fear!
Still, with the chains of effort shattered
I force the mind to depart into places of unbridled lust
Temples shunned and forbidden, where ashes are born without fire
I stare myself blind at the stranger in the mirror
In the nexus of contradiction, in the commotion in between
The speaking serpent walks

As an uninvited guest in the flesh of a pious man
In sleepless hours, in restless woe
A stranger is born within
Alike an angel of sinister hunger, scourging the roots of life
Nerve by nerve
And when we dare to lose ourselves to that aching silence
With a fiendish notion even unto ourselves -
A phoenix brought back into suffering
Imagine what could be sleeping in abodes like these,
When their outer shells shine with the fires of hell!

Where the substance of god is fouled, and we are nowhere
Vessels for the nameless, hallucinations that grow into bridges to possession
We are nowhere, we are nowhere!

Slaves!
Kneeling with heads touching burning coal
Are you not as ashes born without flames -
Here, where the veil separating night and day is so thin?
For your eyes burn with forbidden fire
Through sleepless hours, in restless woe
You face the mirror forced to confess -
The world is so much darker now
And we are nowhere!

At the diabolist coven
Wading in the water of astral shadows
At the shore line
A breach between the worlds
