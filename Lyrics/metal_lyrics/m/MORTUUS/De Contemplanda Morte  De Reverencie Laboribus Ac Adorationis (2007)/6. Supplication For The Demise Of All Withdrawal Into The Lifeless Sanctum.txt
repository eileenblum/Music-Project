The spirit can not die in anything but in Thee
Therefore I implore Thee in prayer
for everything must be destroyed so that You can live,
...so that I can live
Oh, God of the perfect black, how could I possibly describe in words,
the awe and worship I feel for Thee?

The serpent of time withdrawn through Thee
the fountain of living water reversed
It becomes the mouth of spiritual Death
The last motion completes Itself, brought into being
when the breath of Chaos releases the central point

The spirit can not die in anything but Thee
Yea, above all thing Thou art!
And everything becomes Thee,
yes, everything dies in Thee!
For Thou art the channel of Thyself.
There lies the redemption of Death fullfilled
There is the salvation and final release
Amen.
