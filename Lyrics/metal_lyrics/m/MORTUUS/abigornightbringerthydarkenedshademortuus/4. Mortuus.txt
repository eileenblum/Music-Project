[performed by Mortuus]Below, below!
In antinomian deeps
In the heart of desolation
We are reflections of the other
We are reflections of the other

Come!
Downward the broken ladder
Penetrate, penetrate!
The harsh voice commands
Causing crackling structures of black and white
In the mirror before me
Severity!
Its principle is embodied in me
Entranced, seduced!
By the movements beyond the surface
And as my breath flees into another world
Its shadow twin pours over to ours

My soul is drained in a chalice of abandonment
As I inhale the essence of Samael

Separation, be my guiding star!
In the tunnel of the left hand
Where all decrees shall burn!
The painful ones in the periphery
Proclaim the death of god
Lightless!
Through abodes of desolation
Deeper, deeper!
Downward the broken ladder
To face the essence of the baneful beast
And draw it into my blood
As I burn in the fires of noxious poison!

Towards the everlasting
Step by step down the broken ladder
I follow this stranger light
A torch for the impure
Through tunnels and tunnels and tunnels
Below, below, below!
