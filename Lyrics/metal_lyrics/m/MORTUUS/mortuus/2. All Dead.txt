Through the bleak sight
The ruins beneath our fading steps
All dead but walking
With flesh so Old
Towards Damnation
Endless Pain...
Towards Damnation
Endless Pain!

The whore of life smiles
With murder and rape on her lips
And the laughter echoes so hollow
Tearing apart the lines of life
Deeper into the Darkness
The eyes of the Abyss
Stare into... His Dead heart

Life is nothing now
After the gloomy sight of Death
Endless paths into Nothing
Bound to the last Breath
With flesh so old
Chained to forever remain
Dead
Fading but never gone
