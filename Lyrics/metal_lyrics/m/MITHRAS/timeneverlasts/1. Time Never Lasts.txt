Because
Time never lasts
It ran down and out
Frozen we never were
Once endless
Now entropic and relative
Ending with no fanfare
In the beginning
Of the end
We tried to find escape
But time
Never lasts

Our hearts became so cold
But once burned
With cores of fire
Our auras everlasting
If only those moments could last forever

Joined as one
We chose this existence
Now all our works will be lost with time

The attraction fades
We drift apart
You grew so cold
We'll dance no more
Off into the dark
To orbits far from here

When young we played
Between the stars
We never knew
Time was set against us
And when the distant 
Began to fade
We'd stayed too long
Our time was gone

Because time never lasts
