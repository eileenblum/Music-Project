Riding forth - For the greater glory of their god
Riding forth - To rage against their infidel
Taking by force - Claiming holy lands as their own
Allachibar - Can no one withstand the power of their god?

Sent by their pope
They rewarded tolerance
With no mercy
To reclaim their
Holy lands
They had to have slaughter
Diplomacy a concept
Lost on these uncivilised barbarians

[Solo: Macey]

I come forth
An unstoppable wind of the east
Taking under my vast wing
New lands for my governance
Horsemen of the open steppe
No one can withstand
"If you had not been so evil, I would not have come"
For I am the wrath of god

[Solo: Macey]
