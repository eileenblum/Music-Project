I travelled far and wide
Searching.....
On paths trodden
Only by so few
I uncover the doorway
My journey nears its end
I complete the ritual
Which grants me passage unto -

This ancient tomb
Of kings - I open
I break the seal
Of three thousand years
What foul enchantment
Will befall me?
What will I
Behold?

Leaving the sun behind
Down passages so dark
The torch my only weapon
Against this vault of darkness
Soon I lose my way
Attempt to trace my footsteps
My torch fading fast
As I see a chink of light

My pace quickens
Running towards the distant glow
I stumble on the entrance
The awesome spectacle brings me to my knees

I behold the tomb of kings

On huge pedestals they stand
Mounted, weapons in hand
Once kings of this land
Their statues stand
Monarchs long forgotten
Rising towards the light
Once proud lords
Will rise again......

Terror in the air
Ancient tombs opening
Grotesque figures emerging
Still dressed in regal splendour
Followed by their servants
Entombed when their lord died
Empty eyes look towards the surface
As foretold: They rise again
