I embrace great victory! 
Ride spread the word 
Take to my people the great news 
We shall return 
To our splendid Capital 
We shall return 
And bask in the glorious greetings 

Bask you shall 
Bask you shall 
Fools 
Senseless fools 

Hark! Across the horizon - I see it 
Our homes - great capital 
Come forth and ride 
March on and return 
Our great victories 
Will make us heroes 
Our great battles shall make us nobles 

What am I? 
That follows 
That which is 
Unseen 

We return 
To our homes 
Oh great city 
We return 

I follow 
Come my lambs 
I call to you 
You shall follow 

You feast your armies 
- I'll take your sons 

Lead me to your precious babes 
I come for them 
And yet you know nothing 
Of all that I am 
And return with that 
Which shall take 
All that it desires 
All that it desires 

Oh! Father 
Can you see it... not? 
It calls me 
Beckons me to follow 
I feel a will overpowering me 
Save me - I must go 
The elders see it not 

Oh! Children follow 
My will captures your souls 
I take you and you shall follow 
Watch as they follow 
See not that which leads 
Those fools they know not of me 
But you my children 
Shall learn all 

To the mountain 
To the mountain 
Come infant disciples 
I shall grow eternally strong 
You hear my song 
It enchants your souls 
You are in my power 
I shall take you away
