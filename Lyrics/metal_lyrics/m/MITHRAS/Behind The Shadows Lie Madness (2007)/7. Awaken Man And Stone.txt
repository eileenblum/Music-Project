As Iâm pursued across this twilight world
High in a mountainside I discovered
A cavern like no other
Seeking refuge I discovered
A cavern like no other
Seeking refuge I descend
Closing sounds force me ever deeper
Resonating fear inside my mind
Then I slip and flounder in darkness
Falling I plummet deeper down

I slid into the mountain
I fell far and could not return
Resigned to this fate I crawl
Ahead I see a light

I found myself in ancient halls
Entombed beneath the rock
A civilisation lost
But how can this be?

Who are you from the outer world
Our realm is âneath the stone
We fled here when the cities fell
To live under the kings

Statues of rock eerie kings of stone
As giants dwarf us all
But we must leave this place
For something terrible will occur

And yet a pedestal cracks
Your king awakes
Alas my coming has doomed you all
Now we must run

He pursues us all
And he will crush us under foot
Flee the rock my comrades
He no longer wishes your devotion
Out of the mountainside
We run in terror
Follow me, this way
In the distance I see a spire
