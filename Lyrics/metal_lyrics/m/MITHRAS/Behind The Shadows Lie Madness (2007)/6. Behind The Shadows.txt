From spaces measureless to man it came
Fell from chasms out of time
Profound
Foretold
Walls raised between us were unmade
Thence humanity was shamed
Manifesting on the edges of our realm
An ingress yawning wide
A gateway to beyond
Walls raised between us were unmade
Hence reality was changed

Above the dark
Under the light
Behind the shadows
Lie madness

Above the dark
Under the light
Behind the shadows
Lie madness

As I trek across these ruined lands
In the distance are strange sounds
In dark skies there shine unearthly lights
Formless beings haunt the nights

Cast upon the winds â the souls of man
They sing to me â an awful song
They try to flee that which devours them
I feel it nearing â I must journey on
