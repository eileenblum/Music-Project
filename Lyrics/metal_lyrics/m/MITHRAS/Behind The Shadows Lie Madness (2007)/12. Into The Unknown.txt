The storm over, the ocean calmed. Far behind the night rolls across the waves, searching. But ahead, beyond the reach of night, something drifts towards a distant shore â itâs fate not sealed. This vessel nears the shores and drifts towards a beach. The sea lays it upon the sand where it comes to rest in the sun.
