Gazing across this vast seascape
Weâll journey to meet the unknown
To a place beyond imagination
There we will find sanctuary
I hear the call of the waves
Breaking upon the shore
They beckon â to me
To them Iâll soon return

Now we must depart
Cast off these cursed lands
For far across the sea
A place the sun never leaves
Foretold me in a dream
Something will bar our way
Although my end is near
I must protect my companions

The darkness grows
Yet the stars are all I see
The sea turns black
Serenity washes over me

From the depths it comes
The voyager from beyond this realm
Who endlessly pursued me
Now our time has come

An old friend you have arrived
Youâve come for me in your true guise
Iâll face you as I am and
Leave this shell behind

Youâll never reach the rest
My shield of light against your shadow
Come now weâll embrace
As you pull me âneath the waves

I reach for the surface
Yet I know my fate is sealed
I sacrifice myself to save
Those I leave behind

Youâll fall back to the abyss
And Iâll rise to planes beyond
Hear my final thoughts
Youâll never know the wonders Iâve seen
