[The Traveller]
This way, we must cross this ocean! We have to traverse these seas.

[His Companions]
But it waits for us?

[The Traveller]
It waits for meâ¦ and me alone.

[His Companions]
Yet it went beneath those wavesâ¦ waiting!

[The Traveller]
My friends, we have the encroaching night, or the sea. Your journey is across the waves as is mine. We must find the place the sun never leaves, away from the shadows, the haunted nights.

[His Companions]
Then now we must depart.

[The Traveller]
Ah my companions, my fate is sealed. In timelessness youâll know me and weâll be as one. Weâll cast off from these cursed lands and I hope youâll reach the place the sun never leaves.
