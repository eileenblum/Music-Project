Across the heavens
An astounding sight I see
A rotating moon
Drawing closer to our world
The distant sun
Shifted in the skies
We must embrace
This cataclysm weâve survived

A hole torn in space and time
Now we must survive
Underneath the three spheres
Under the three spheres

Something heard them cry
And now our world has changed
Underneath the three spheres
Under the three spheres

Iâm fixed upon my path
To search a ruined world
For any who like me
Endured the scourging of mankind
