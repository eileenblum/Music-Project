I cast my sight towards the past
And remember that which forced our flight
Our doom I saw and knew was near
But my warnings fell on deaf ears
My kin had left though I delayed
To greater planes I meant to follow
But as I made my flight of passage
The chasm opened in my path

Beneath me earth faded away â above
Titanic forces drew me to the abyss
Where time and space converged my memories blend
Yet now I recall what I saw:

From within this void something is looming
A monstrous presence engulfs me
As tentacles probe my mind
Iâm scrutinised from the rift
Its power is too great
I feel my light fading
As Iâm dragged into fell depths
I scream into the void

How I witnessed
As it drew me close
This my end
I would surely die
So I flared
And it threw me far
Through dark skies
Like a star I fell

I awaken â I have returned
I scream to the heavens â Why?
