On the horizon
An ever setting sun
Behind us lies eternal night
Yet there is a place
Where darkness cannot come
Bound by oceans
Over the edge of the world

Pursued by the encroaching night
We must strive to reach the light

Follow me
For we must go
To where the sun
Never leaves

Follow me
For we must go
To where the sun
Will never leave

Rise up Iâll lead you to the light
For soon Iâll pass beyond the reach of night

Follow me
For Iâll lead you
To where the sun
Never leaves

Iâll follow you
Youâll never go
To where the sun
Never leaves
