[The Traveller]
The sun never leaves, the night always encroaches. What manner of place is this? With these thoughts an oppressing slumber overtakes meâ¦ I yearn for worlds long lost, but not forgottenâ¦ I must shun the chilling breeze, and contemplate my fateâ¦ the distant cascading waves, voices so familiar yet unknown, facesâ¦ WAIT! What is this? Against the horizon, movements that should not be raise me from my slumber. What things are these, dwellers of the night? Creatures of shadow!? Beasts with transparent skin? How can these things exist? Such things were never meant to be seen by the eyes of man! They roam the edge of the night. Always in the shadows, drifting, following. These creatures pursue the darkness. These things are coming forâ¦ â¦ME! Run, I must run from them, for BEHIND THE SHADOWSâ¦ â¦LIE MADNESS!
