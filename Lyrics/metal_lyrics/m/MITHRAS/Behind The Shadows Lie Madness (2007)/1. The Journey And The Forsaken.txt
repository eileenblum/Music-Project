[The Great Councillor]
Again the gateway opensâ¦ and I sense it! Finally I soar, far beyond perceptions and physical senses â I follow in the footsteps of my kindred. I reach the bridge between space and time and the portals to worlds beyond. At last, I step through into the lightâ¦

[The Enigma]
Now we are as one!

[The Great Councillor]
NO! You cannot have found me now, this cannot be!!! What has happened? What cursed place is this? I resist you! No, cast me not from these heavens. (Falling) This cannot be, what has befallen me?
