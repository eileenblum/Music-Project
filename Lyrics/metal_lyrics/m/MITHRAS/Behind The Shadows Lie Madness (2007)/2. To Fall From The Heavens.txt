From nightmares of pain
I return
To fathomless dreams
And damnation
Yet no dream is this
For I see
The world we fled
Ruined around me
By mighty hands
Swept away
The works of
Humanity
To what have I
Returned
What fate will
Befall me?

What brought me here
Back to this space
To beyond the stars
I long to return

My people
I hear them no longer
The gates have closed
Our great link is broken
We went forth
To find another world
But still I walk the earth
I am not aloneâ¦?

This world fades
Chaos is born
For I am that
Which fell from the heavens
I have come
Forever more
To eat of this world
For I am of the abyss
