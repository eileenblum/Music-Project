[feat. Tyler Carter]I'm watching you leave
There is more to know and less to forgive
Holding you close, catching your taste
I'm feeling you around this place
I'm watching you go
And I won't forgive for all that I know
Holding your hand for the last time
My heart is covered in rime

You've burned me down again
Now you can be alone
And I swear to God
That I will never come home
Girl, I know there's day I'll meet you
Again and you will ask me,
You'll beg me to stay
But all of your hope are your wishes and prays
They won't guide your way
They won't guide your way, whoa
Give up your ambitions
Nothing's gonna be the same
Go play your selfish game

And now I'm feeling your cold
Even after all that I have told
I'm hearing your breath
But so much time has passed
And you're not the same girl
Now you're full of poison (of poison)
My lungs are feeling lack of ozone

[Tyler Carter:]
Girl if there's a place
Where all that I know shines right through my face
That would be world so vicious
That was never enough to meet your ambitions
Call me with a thunder wave -
My heart for you I saved
I don't wanna be the one
Standing on your grave
Call me with a thunder wave -
My heart for you I saved
I don't wanna be the one
Standing on your grave

Just stay forever
The world after all
(The world after all)
Comes never here I crawl
Stars never hear us fall

Just stay forever
Comes never here I crawl
(Comes never here I crawl)
The world after all
Stars never hear us fall
(Stars never hear us fall)
