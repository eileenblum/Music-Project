Call me after midnight
Call me after midnight

I stand alone watching the stars around me
I'm feeling so free
But I don't believe that I'm the only one
Who wants to know the truth about a million suns
And the lights that come to my dreams every night
And the lights that come to my dreams every night

I am not afraid and I'm not gonna pretend
That I don't want to touch it with my hand
Oh!

Wherever I am it seems so close to me
And I already can not wait

Call me after midnight
When the bright stars collide
To hear their cold silent scream (cold silent scream)
While they'll read our dreams

Straight to my face
Straight to my heart
So we no longer stand apart
No matter if your enemies
Or our Gods
We will no longer stand apart
[x2]

The moon and the stars are calling all of us (calling all of us)
On a trip into the silver dust (silver dust)
I feel its light and this time I can not trust (I can not trust)
That it heals my scars

We know it's real
We know it's real
We know it's real
We know it's real
It's real!

Call me after midnight

We know it's real

Our world's not standing still
And that's how we feel
And that's how we feel

We know it's real
We know it's real
We know it's real
