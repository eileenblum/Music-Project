[Intro:]
OHH!!
Let me see, see your dreams
And just let me touch your heart again
On the street where my beliefs
Never caused you no pain

[Verse 1:]
People hurt
They always leave in just a minute
For all those woken in my shirt
(YOU SHOULD ADMIT!) that I just did it
That I just did it

[Chorus:]
Feels so hard to find the reason of love
Can't take any longer
You're so much stronger
Since I've been dreaming of a sign from above
Don't get any better
Nothing does matter
My eyes are open wide to see what's coming next
The trace I walk is so empty
I'll give my life to make you never forget
Who the hell you wanted to make me
I'm better than you could be

[Verse 2:]
Always so sure
That you can climb the sky
Settle down your mind
And never ever die
Come and kiss me
Oh darling, make me believe
That I could ever give it back,
Just turn my back and leave

[Breakdown:]
Never knew if my words
Would make sense again
When you extend your name
With titles and awards
If there is a time for words
To make sense again?
If there is a planet of hopes
Where you and me remain?

You mesh my head
And that's the worst thing you could do
I never knew if my words would make sense again

[Chorus:]
Feels so hard to find the reason of love
Can't take any longer
You're so much stronger
Since I've been dreaming of a sign from above
Don't get any better
Nothing does matter
My eyes are open wide to see what's coming next
The trace I walk is so empty
I'll give my life to make you never forget
Who the hell you wanted to make me
I'm better than you could be

[Bridge:]
A tiny border between love and hate

[Breakdown:]
Yeah babe, I was laughing
But now it's true
So make up your mind
And look for your heartbeat
I would connect my life
With every single part

Yeah babe, I was lying
But now it's true
So make up your mind
And look for your heartbeat
I would connect my life
With every single part

[Outro:]
People hurt - they always leave in just a minute
For all those woken in my shirt - admit that I just did it

People hurt - they always leave in just a minute
For all those woken in my shirt...

Admit that I just did it bitch.

OHH!
