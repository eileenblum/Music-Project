Boom! There go your lips
Thought it would last forever
Now it's a time for our kiss
Stuck between hell and heaven
Don't you think that
We're all twisted
You're like a voice in my head
You're the threat
And you've always existed

Bring me down
Make me unconscious
Try to shut my mouth with your glove
Tryna take my heart but I won't allow

How could I know
That this is not your smile?
Not yours anymore, girl
But stolen for a while
You should have know
Encircled with a fire
A match was thrown
Into the heart of your empire

A match was thrown
Into the heart of your empire - set on fire

Envious still try to obsess your crown
Hidden far away
The day you lost your charm
Painted many lives in grey
You're all that we know
Whom we used to adore
Perfect years come and go
Behind your closed door

You never let me inside
You never opened that door
Even when your castle's burning floor by floor
You never looked in my eyes
You're always telling the lies
What part of the truth do you hide?

Don't you try to make me believe
In the perfect life, in the dream that you live
If time goes back in my reality
I would never forget what you have done to me

Bring me down
Make me unconscious
Try to shut my mouth with your glove
Tryna take my heart but I won't allow

HEY!

FORWARD MARCH!

A match was thrown
Into the heart of your empire - set on fire
