Sun is going down
Covering your eyes with shadows
Darkness is about to flow

All around, until you drown
Another day
Left nothing in your brain
Running like the rain
It fades away

Turn around
And I will take you far away
A cure to make your day was found
Can't feel the taste until you play
Dreams flowing from a pipe
Into your mind

Standing on your feet
No one lets you fall
Swallowing the beat
In the dancing wall
Monsters look so sweet
In your visions
You'd better move your fucking feet

Standing on your feet
No one lets you fall
Swallowing the beat
In the dancing wall
Monsters look so sweet
In your visions
You'd better move your fucking feet

It's now or never
It's now or never
It's now or never
It's now or never
It's now or never
It's now or never
It's now or never
It's now or never, Fuck!
It's now or never, Fuck!

Quit sleeping my dear
Clear up your mind and heart
These dreams will disappear
With new blood
You've traveled to places unseen

We never knew where you've been
We'll never know where you've been

Your world is turning round
Pipe dreams will make you stay
The secret's always found
As puff drifts away

A neverending day
Where everything you feel
Will make you fall astray

Forgetting what is real

You've lost your way!
You've lost your mind!

Open your eyes
Stop thinking it's okay
Cause you have lost your way
Under the purple skies
Open your mind
It's eating you from the inside

All the colors will make you go blind
In the fake place where you used to hide
