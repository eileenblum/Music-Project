Day after day
Time after time
You're paving your own way
And covering me with slime
Satisfying your pride
Carrying the torch of death
You'll be surprised to find
That I'm taking my last fucking breath
That I'm taking my last fucking breath

You never cared for me
Taking everything for free
I will destroy you stone by stone
Until you are left alone

Drowning in your greed
You will feel my curse
Drowning in your greed
You will feel my curse
You will feel my curse

This voice is to all of the nations
This call is for all creations
This voice is to all of the nations
This call is for all creations

I am the soil that feeds
I am the ground that gave you life
But you drill me till I bleed
You cut me with a giant knife
I will bear you till the days
When there is nowhere to hide
I will open my graves
To take you inside
To take you inside
To take you inside
To take you inside

Crying for you
Calling on you to save me
Don't turn your back away
Hoping for you
Craving on you for changes
That bring me life today

You caused a rain that hurts
You're acting like a stranger
Inside your only world

That's why I'm crying to you
I'm calling on you, my baby
To hear my priceless words

Just about the day to look back
On the things that you slay
On the world that you hack
Just about the time to realize
That you've got nothing to say
Looking in my eyes
