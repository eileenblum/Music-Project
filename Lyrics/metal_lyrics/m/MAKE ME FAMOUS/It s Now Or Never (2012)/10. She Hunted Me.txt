All the deepest fears
All the lying tears
Empty covers
All unanswered calls
All the broken souls
Desperate lovers
Can't you see? She hunted me
In my misery

Missed her lonely sight
Turned and left away
In the midnight light
There's a burning flame
Deep inside my bones
Take away my pain

Baby, come help me find my way
Come help me find my home

All the deepest fears
All the lying tears
Empty covers
All unanswered calls
All the broken souls
Desperate lovers
Can't you see? She hunted me
In my misery

Thunder of the road
Is my only friend
So many tales were told
But a few have seen the end
All the rest have gone
They were left alone

Baby, take me where I belong
Come help me find my home

All the deepest fears
All the lying tears
Empty covers
All unanswered calls
All the broken souls
Desperate lovers
Can't you see? She hunted me
In my misery

Will I ever disappear?
Spark that's flickering alone
Where a lie is always near
Where the truth is long time gone

Spitting out that poisoned wine
I will keep you by my side
Cause I know that you'll be mine
Cause you've hunted me tonight

All the deepest fears
All the lying tears
Empty covers
All unanswered calls
All the broken souls
Desperate lovers
Can't you see? She hunted me
In my misery

Missed her lonely sight
Turned and left away
In the midnight light
