Fuck your fake smiles
Fuck your lies
Fuck your vanity
Fuck your snide ways
Never getting involved 'cause you might take the fall
Do you ever think for your fucking self at all?
Following your leaders with the words that you speak
don't you realize that they are the tongues in your cheek?

The day will come when you're alone 
and your so-called friends won't be found
We're the ones who will still be going strong 
while you realize that you were wrong
Another footsoldier in an army of clones,"style": yeah, "substance": no,
flesh without bones.
You can look down on us, we don't give a fuck
Because: We're not like you. We don't need you.
We just hate you. 
Fuck you
