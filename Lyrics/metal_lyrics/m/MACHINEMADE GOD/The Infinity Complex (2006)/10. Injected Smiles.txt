Sweeping me up, but away.
Inadvertintly or not.
Smiles followed by frowns.
But they never last that long. Sweeping me up, but away.
Inadvertintly or not.
A single word and it's growing strength. A phrase and i'm almost lost.

This grip is tightened. Clockwise. Counter. Risking willingly a pain (so great),
for a pleasure greater.

Injected hopes by your touch into my open veins.
Wishes and blood intertwine.
Injected smiles from you.
A voice so soft and sweet, my reality is blurred when there is noone else but you.
Every word you say is a beautiful brand new song.
This needle pierces my skin and lets you in.
