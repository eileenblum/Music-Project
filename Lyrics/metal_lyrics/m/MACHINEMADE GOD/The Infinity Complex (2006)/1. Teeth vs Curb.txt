Another fairytale about these endless feelings.
This time I thought you were worth it but you proved me wrong, yeah
you proved me wrong again 
and all these words that we lost doesn't mean a thing to me now.

Fixated stares in your direction burn my eyes.
Your veins carry cyanide, while mu veinds carry rust.
Your heart bleeds black while mine pumps dust.
And I still remeber the last kiss

These lips still ache and seeing you less is too much too take
For today I learned my lesson now
This time, I hold my emotions all back and hide them in my secret place
and I swear: There's no "Forever"! Like a tidalwave knocking me down
this feels like teeth against curb.
