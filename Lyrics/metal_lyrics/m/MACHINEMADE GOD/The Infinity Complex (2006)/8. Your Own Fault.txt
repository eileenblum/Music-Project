You lose yourself always doomed to be alone.
You broke so many things that you can't keep track.
You lost so many friends but you wont look back.
You made some bad mistakes, showed no regrets.

Your knees are weak and there you fall, it's so hard to admit it all,
but it's all your fault and you know that now and you feel sorry for it all.
Through all these hardships you have walked alone.
Your life is forsaken your heart has grown cold.
You lost your feelings, forgot your home.
You feel sorry, so sorry for it all.
