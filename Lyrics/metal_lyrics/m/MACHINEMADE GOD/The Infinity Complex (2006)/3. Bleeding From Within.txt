Sweet is the knife that cuts the skin, 
I'm bleeding feelings from within.
Cold is the metal, bourne so rare and razor's blade returns so fair
Sweet is the hurt that drags away the pain, 
opens my eyes, makes me sane
Everytime I'm staring at myself I'm wondering of all this was in vain

One last time I try to face the mirror
This lonely moment seems to last forever
Everytime I see myself alone
everytime I have ever cried beacasue of you!

everytime when you you just looked away
I became emptier inside
Take me out of this haunting darkness...
Bring me back to life..bring me back to life
Salvation!
