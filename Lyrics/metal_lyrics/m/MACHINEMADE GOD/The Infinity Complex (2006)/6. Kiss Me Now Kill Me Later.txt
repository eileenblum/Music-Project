Kiss me now, kill me later.
Scattered ashes on the ground
Touch me now, leave me bleeding here.
No clue what is to be found just scattered ashes on the ground.
Kiss me now, kill me later, touch me now, leave me bleeding here.
A sky spun of roses and tulips, all black.

Such beauty found in your eyes and deceit in your lies.
All these boiling emotions with a flawless design...
(We could) make it trough, your sweet hand in mine.
But I stare alone at this beautiful blackened sky,
the perfect world would be you and I, you and I,
pull the trigger: BANG!
Even as the bullet painfully twists in my heart,
death could never tear us apart.
My life speeds by as I remain the same.

My body empty, my mind insane.
