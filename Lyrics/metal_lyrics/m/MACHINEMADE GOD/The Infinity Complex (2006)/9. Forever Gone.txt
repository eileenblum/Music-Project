The sky's been painted with shades of death.
The message was written all too vaguely.
Something was coming to an end, a pre-recorded fate hanging overhead.
We all knew that this day would come, we just waited mournfully.

As sheets of sheer black covered our coast,
time stopped and the ringing phone ensued soft whispers,
and gentle tears came through the electrical wires.
Your eyes were closed and we all hoped that your dreams 
were just beautiful as you slipped out of our grasp.

The sky had opened up for your soul we held our heads high towards the sky.
We won't forget, we won't let go...your stories will be told...
