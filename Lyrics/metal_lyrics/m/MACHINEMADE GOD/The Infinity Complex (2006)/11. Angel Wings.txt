You once had the warmth that melt the coldest hearts.
But your angel wings freeze in mid-air, 
shattered remains of memories lay dying on the cold and broken earth.
Sweet memories...fading away...

As I lose you now It broke, and broke me down.
I watched your eyes turn from seas of blue to sheets of steel,
as tears run down my bloody cheeks, cringingly I taste the death of me.
