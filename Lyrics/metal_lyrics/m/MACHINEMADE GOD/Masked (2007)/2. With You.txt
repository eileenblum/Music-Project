Like shadows in the moonlight,
I feel tonight, my bride.
I'm stalking through the alleys
To be with you I hide

Take deep breath and see
Your are the one for me.

Completely living in this,
We are living in this dream.
We cannot lift this burden,
Just avoid it's way

For you I failed, for you betrayed
Now I'm crawling through the dark
Alone...

Take deep breath and see
Your are the one for me.

So in the graves we roam.
Believing... deceiving.
Behind the wall we'll be
No one to set us free.

Take deep breath and see
Heartless times will be.

For you I failed, for you betrayed
Now I'm crawling through the dark
Alone...

The ground so cold...
The light so dark...
What if I discard?
Pictures in me
Become true
Everytime I am with you

I can tell you part by part
If you don't remember
Such a burden on my heart

All the things that I wished for
All the things are no more
So I mourn for you...

For you I failed, for you betrayed
Now I'm crawling through the dark
Alone...
