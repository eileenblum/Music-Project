This is for my friends, for those who care
about me in those desperate days

And I want you to know, that I will never turn
my back against you! And I want you to know
that I'm always there whenever you need me!

4 am. I don't care, call me up and I'll be there,
cause you would do the same If I was desperate again

This is for my friends, for those who care
about me in those desperate days
For the times we had, the words you said
when I was lost inside me

This one is for you, to let you know that I'm there
And that I'll catch you when you fall

I wont turn my back to you,
I would give my heart for you
We are so strong together,
We stand as one forever

Those times we laughed,
those times we cried,
those tears we shed,
those years we spent,
for all these memories
that I will always keep,
I thank you with this song,
don't you forget me when I'm gone
