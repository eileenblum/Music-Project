There she is, once again on her knees
breaking down right in front of me
Once again I just fall for her lies
I deceive myself

This is murderous I know,
Like leading the sheep to wolves,
I believe in her words
and make the same mistake again

I cannot sleep without her breath
right next to me
and I can't breath
each time she's leaving me

Here I am, once again on my knees
until the moment, it all comes down
The day, the hour I understand

This kills me
And I surrender!
You kill me

This is murderous I know,
Like leading the sheep to wolves,
I believe in her words
and make the same mistake again

I cannot sleep without her breath
right next to me
and I can't breath
each time she's leaving me
