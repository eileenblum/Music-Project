We can not stop ourselves,
so we just keep on going,
knowing that somewhere else
the horror plays and plays again.

We are healed by someones gift
of unearned and unwanted love.
But zombie-like it stalks
the world that we are living in.
it stalks the world we're living in
It stalks the world!

We are all forgiven.

One buries it deep
in a vaulted, leadlined chamber
the other keeps it in his heart.
Always remember

We are the darkened children,
we need forgiveness
for what we suffer innocent.
Guilt is the trademark
of our generation,
burned into our flesh
of memories.

We are all forgiven.

One buries it deep
in a vaulted, leadlined chamber
the other keeps it in his heart.
Always remember
