Everytime I am on my knees
the thirst for revenge is calling me

I've walked through hell and back now
but I would not be myself without the pain
I seek revenge this time
vengeance is mine!

Whatever, I'll never
forget the things you did
I'll make you suffer
til' the day that you're bleeding

Fear my hate for liars
Fear my hate for you
I will set fire until you burn in hell
Don't tell me to feel sorry
cause there is nothing that can hold me back this time
Be warned and save your prayer for yourself

Whatever, I'll never
forget the things you did
I'll make you suffer
til' the day that you're bleeding

I will set fire...
until your last lie burns!
And I won't stop to scream...
until the truth is heard

I've walked through hell and back now
but I would not be myself without the pain
I seek revenge this time
vengeance is mine!
