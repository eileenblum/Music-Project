Darkness for centuries, war for decades,
after years of misery, still I remain the same
But after the loss of the love of my life
I have felt the pain for the first time

Forever you, my yesterday
through the coldest nights
Forever me, eternity
save me from this tragedy

Gift of eternity turned out to be... my curse
The lust for life, desire for love made me turn into..

A restless soul walking alone
An empty shell without a home
A dying heart in a dead man's chest
This is all I have, this is all that's left

This is all I have, so take it back
cause I'll watch the sunset

Forever you, my yesterday
through the coldest nights
Forever me, eternity
save me from this tragedy

You kept dreaming always, on and on
And so I always will...

We keep dreaming always on and on
We are invisible...

We keep dreaming always on and on
We breathe eternity...

A restless soul walking alone
An empty shell without a home
A dying heart in a dead man's chest
This is all I have, this is all that's left
