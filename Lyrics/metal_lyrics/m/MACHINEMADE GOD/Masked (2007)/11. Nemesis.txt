The signs are everywhere
But your ignorance makes you too blind
to see the obvious
Instead of acting, you keep on waiting
in hope that someone else takes care about it

It's your last chance to save me,
time's running out, don't waste it
It's your last chance to save me,
time's running out, don't waste it

Exploiting nature...
A dying planet...
Slaughtered souls
in mass-production everywhere
Fat politicans full of corruption
grow fatter while the starving children die

It's your last chance to save me,
time's running out, don't waste it
It's your last chance to save me,
time's running out, don't waste it

It's time for us to rise!
It's time for us to act!
It's time to stand our ground!

It's your last chance to save me,
time's running out, don't waste it
It's your last chance to save me,
time's running out, don't waste it
