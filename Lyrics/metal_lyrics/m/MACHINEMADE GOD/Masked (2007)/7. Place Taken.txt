Watch me taking control of your game
I won't be a figure on your board of destiny
I became your strongest opponent
and now it is my turn
Even if I fail, I tried
and others will follow

The day has come
we rise
Questions fall away
Answers lead me
to lies

The storm is on, a thunderstrike
straight to your evil heart
A lightening bold to your regime
Clouds of justice and freedom
The rain of truth brings hope
The wind of change breaks your lies

The day has come
we rise
Questions fall away
Answers lead me
to lies
Anguished are my eyes

Sense fading through my eyes
anguish is leaving me
Stumbling through this maze and I disappear...
