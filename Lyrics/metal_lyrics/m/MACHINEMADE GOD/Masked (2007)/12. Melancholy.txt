The world is spinning even faster tonight
A moment clearly as the tears in my eyes
The ocean cries into the river of life
The agony that forces you to leave behind

We walk under the sky
We watch the stars up high

And even though I knew you'd go,
I revealed my feelings for you

And in your whisper I still hear,
everything you are.

We walk under the sky
We watch the stars up high
Your eyes so bright
Your kiss so soft tonight

And even though I may get used
to this melancholy
I've lost the taste of thine
And I miss your lips on mine...

We walk under the sky
We watch the stars up high
Your eyes so bright
Your kiss so soft tonight

Your eyes...
Your kiss...
