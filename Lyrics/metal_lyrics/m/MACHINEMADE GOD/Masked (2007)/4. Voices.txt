Stitch the lips closed, so that the promises are not in vain
Beautiful lies, broken dreams, false hope and hidden secrets
That is what can be found in the outside world...

But I won't let it drag me down!

All doors are nailed up and locked,
the windows are closed. The glass reflects the brightest blue
of my walls
so that the sky is always smiling when
I look out the sky its always smiling

So everybody listen up
I think my voice is bleeding
by every second breath I take
the picture starts to grow...

I am not afraid to fall asleep, I am not afraid to die
As long as we stand aside... we can make it through
Stand up and fight
against all demons if we
stand up and fight
all the wrongness in this world

So everybody listen up
I think my voice is bleeding
by every second breath I take
the picture starts to grow...

And as I am walking
I hear the other voices talking
through my ears into my head
Torture is everything we had

So that the sky is always smiling when
I look out the sky its always smiling...
So everybody listen up
I think my voice is bleeding
by every second breath I take
the picture starts to grow...

And as I am walking
I hear the other voices talking
through my ears into my head
Torture is everything we had
