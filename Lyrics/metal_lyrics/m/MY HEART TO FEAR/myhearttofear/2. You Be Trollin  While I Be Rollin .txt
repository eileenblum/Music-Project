Will you take my life
Like you said you would
Or prove to me that
All the words
You ever said
Were empty cartridges
From your magnum-mouth

Happy birthday
Hereâs your gift
And I donât plan to stay
A button to reset that jaw every single time
It dislocates

From the awe of what I am
And the weight of what youâre not
From the awe of what I am
And the weight
The weight of what
Youâre not

I donât need your opinions,
Theyâre all just anchors for the weak
Youâre like a wave in the ocean
You sound like all the rest

All who fear your words
Havenât lost the battle
They just canât see it from my view
If they knew you just like I do
You never follow through

Inspire me unless all your attempts
Spent every bit of intelligence
Youâll ever get
If you want to waste your own time looking for my faults
Then the only one who will ever care is you
So, go ahead

You have one life to live
And my deepest form of revenge
Is watching you waste it

If
You
Took my life
Like you said you would
Blowing bullet holes deeper
Then your magnum-mouth could
Iâd part your pride like the sea
You couldnât bury my dreams
