I can't decide
All alone and all alive
Right hand in His
The left in mine

Oh, the things I would do
To hold you one last time
All the things that I would give
To hold your hands in mine

So, take a breath and close your eyes
Knee deep in sleep
Dream well tonight
Whoa oh, whoa oh
You know it's gonna be alright
And as you open up your eyes
Remember me in your new life
Whoa oh, whoa oh
You know it's gonna be alright

Love is worth all the pain it takes to find the real thing
And even though she's gone
I know she knew it all along
Still undecided
All alone alive
Or death with you
Right hand in His
The left in mine

Father, take this breath from me
Choke me with serenity

You know it's gonna be alright
