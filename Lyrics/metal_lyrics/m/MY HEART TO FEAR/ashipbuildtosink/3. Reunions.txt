This is the end
Your life has crumbled before you
Give up or paint a new picture
Give up or paint the picture
Get on your knees
Donât fall for this bliss
Youâll drown in ignorance
So, keep your hands stretched toward the skies
A veiled symphony
Canât you hear our subconscious screaming
Our lack of fear protects us 
from the consequences
Ignorance is our security
Youâll drown in ignorance
My heart weeps for your soul
Reunions of the self
Reconcile lost signals to your soul
We are the anti-world
You are all slaves to yourselves
So, this is really the end
Or the start to a new chapter
Whoâs the one with the upper hand now
Donât you see that all these things are meaningless
Nothing satisfies
