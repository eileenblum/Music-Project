Whoa oh, whoa oh
Hey, baby, you have captured me
My nerve endings are frozen over
My emotions are a kind I never knew
Baby, I can feel you, moving closer
Closer
like a brain within your brain
Or a ship thatâs built to sink
Like a gas tank with a drain
Or a mind that cannot think
I am the Sun
I am the Sunlight shining through
I am the Stars 
I am the Moonlight piercing you
Itâs alright Here I am
Calling on Your name
Buried in my shame
Iâm trapped here once again
My name is Legion
I am the abscess of your soul
Flowered between white walls of flesh
Whoa oh, whoa oh
These habits are controlling me
I canât think for myself any longer
Iâve become a man Iâd never want to be
And to my heart itâs only moving closer
