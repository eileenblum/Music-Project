Six years of climbing and we're not done yet
A brotherhood of memories that we'll never forget
Conquer the mountain
Walk through the sea
There is no stopping us now
There is no stopping us now

I fear no man
And when the wicked stand in arms against me
I'll know what I died for
For I know that death is just a means of transportation

We haven't gotten where we are because we waited for this to get easy
Through bloodshed, sweat, and tears we have defied the laws of success
When the chips were down and all we had was our familiy, friends, and common sense
We will never be content
We came as children and left as men
This will never happen again

This is our legacy
We're all accounted for
So let us proudly proclaim:
This is a family
We've found what truly matters
Family!
Faith!
Pride!
Brotherhood!
(Family, faith, pride, brotherhood!)

Bring me the darkest hour
Show me the hardest way
(No) This is
(No) My risk
Never cease to persist
Bring me the darkest hour
Show me the hardest way
(No) This is
(No) My risk
Never cease to persist

This is our world to take over
This is our world to take over

Through every thought, every cold
Every dream I'll ever hold
I'll shed my blood
I'll shed my tears
I'll fight my way through all my fears
Through every thought, every cold
Every dream I'll ever hold
I'll shed my blood
I'll shed my tears
I'll fight my way through all my fears
A brotherhood of memories that we'll never forget
