Father where have I gone
Iâve been far away for far too long
I need You now to just show
Come and fill the void that she sewed shut
Iâm sorry I replaced You
But will I ever find love

All I want is a hand to hold
Another heart to cherish
A warmth that I can recognize without even opening my eyes
I need you more than ever
I donât wanna have to think
I need her to be satisfied

Where did you go because I know
I canât be satisfied
Iâd like to think that Iâd be okay dying alone
Iâd like to say Iâll find a way
But whatâs the use in telling lies

Father where have I gone
One of my biggest fears is dying alone
But if thatâs what it takes to follow my dreams
Then make it so
I want to fall in love before the end of the world
Will I ever fall in love
You would think this is a minimal price to pay for the cause
Of following my dreams
But oh how I long for the feeling
Oh how I long
