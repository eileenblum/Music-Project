Will you take my life like you said you would?
Or you prove to me that all the words you ever said
Were empty cartridges from your magnum mouth

Happy birthday
Here's your gift and I don't plan to stay
A button to reset that jaw every single time it dislocates

From the awe of what I am
And the weight of what you're not
From the awe of what I am
And the weight of what you're not
You're not!

I don't need your opinions
They're all just anchors for the weak
You're like a wave in the ocean
You sound like all the rest

All who fear your words haven't lost the battle
They just can't see it from my view
If they knew you just like I do
You never follow through

Inspire me unless all your attemptsÂ 
Spent every bit of intelligence
You'll ever get
If you want to waste your own time looking for my faults
Then the only one who will ever care is you

So, go ahead!

You sound like all the rest
You have one life to live
And my depeest form of revenge
Is watching you waste it
But if you took my life like you said you would
Blowing bullet holes deeper than your magnum mouth could
I'd part your pride like the sea
I'd part your pride like the sea
You couldn't bury my dreams
