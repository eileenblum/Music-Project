Why do we paint the walls of our churches
with the tears of the starving children?
Your genocide establishment

Day by day
You grow more complacent
Night by night
The money's wasted

Repent, Repent
Where is your heart?
Where is your heart?
Where is your heart?

Look me in the face
Tell me that you're doing
all you can to show God's grace

You are the disease
We are the vaccine

The lies hung above your head
are the millstone to break your neck
The lies hung above your head
are the millstone to break your neck

In the end all your wealth
Will only be coals
That fuel the fire
To burn down your walls
All of your wealth
Will only be coals
That fuel the fire
To burn down your walls

Where is your heart?

I disassociate all of your mistakes
From what I represent here on this stage
And when the day is done
Where are the ones you love?
All I see are dollar signs scribed on every page

You are the disease
You are the disease
Our love is the Vaccine
