Oh this newer generation, Drowning in self pity
Looking for every single possible way to scream "woe is me" to the world
For the high of sympathy

In a world filled with so many people
In a world with free will
How can we blame a God for our suffering
When we're the ones who beat our young for thrills
We rape, we kill
But we rarely claim the bill
We've made our homes in the undertow
No room for tears, only room for growth
We've made our homes in the undertow
We have no choice but to learn and grow

We blame God
It's easier than swallowing the truth
We chase our dreams but we still suffer
Pull at the seams but we still suffer
We blame God
For lack of human reasoning we question our suffering
We chase our dreams but we still suffer
Pull at the seams but we still suffer

Why do you think you're such a victim?
You act like your suffering is something new, but it's not
This is something we all go through
I won't stand for
This double standard held higher than reason
I won't stand for
This double standard held higher than reason

We've made our homes in the undertow
No room for tears, only room for growth
We've made our homes in the undertow
We have no choice but to learn and grow

We blame God
We chase our dreams but we still suffer
We blame God
Pull at the seams but we still suffer
We blame God
We chase our dreams but we still suffer
We blame God
