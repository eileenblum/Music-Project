I remember the day
I carried my best friend to his grave
I put him back down into the earth
Into the soil from which we came
I never felt pain like this before
I never felt pain like this before
Have you ever wrapped your arms around the grave
Of a father who lost the son of his dreams

Life comes fast
But death comes faster
Any moment we could stand
Face to face with our master
This is nothing new
To all who breathe the same air

Step up to reality
Step down from your first-world misery
You've got breath in your lungs
And that's potential to fight for

Many have been through worse than me
I'm not trying to compare our suffering
I just want to emphasize
Appreciation for family, friends, and life

Death is just shots fired in the dark
Chance is just shots fired in the dark
Death is just shots fired in the dark
Chance is just shots fired in the dark

And as the night went on
His dinner grew colder
Just like his little sister
With no brother to hold her

And as the news poured out
On that night of dreadful wonder
All the color was stolen
From the lives of his father and mothers

Thanks for all the good times
And all the things you taught us
We will never forget you
Just like you never forgot us
Thanks for all the good times
And all the things you taught us
We will never forget you
Just like you never forgot us

We'll press on
We'll press on
Oh how we wish you were here
We'll press on
Oh how we wish you were here
We will press on
Oh how we wish you were here
We'll press on
Oh how we wish you were here
We will press on
