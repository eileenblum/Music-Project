You don't have to die for nothing
You don't have to die for nothing

Welcome to the earth
It is a place with endless beauty
It is a place with endless pain
Where the best of men are broken
And where the best of men are made
Good pleasure turns into bad feelings
Love can turn to hate

Let's be real
We're all searching for a reason
In the menial passing of the time and the seasons
Can we look beyond all the money and the glamour
To see the naked human in his natural manner

I've grown so bitter against
All the trends
All the categories that we put ourselves and others in
But what is one opinion out of seven billion?

You don't have to die for nothing
You don't have to die for nothing

People ask what happened to music
It ran away when money tried to rip out its heart
Yeah, I may only be twenty years old
But I can proudly say I didn't sell my soul
And call it art

How many bodies is it going to take
Before we slow the earth as it rotates
How many bodies is it going to take
Before we slow the earth as it rotates

You say you'd rather live for nothing
Than live for something fake
Well what if nothing lets you down
You say you'd rather live for nothing
Than live for something fake
Well what if nothing lets you down
