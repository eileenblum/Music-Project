Itâs difficult to write a song against
A new paradigm of selfishness
When I know that it will never change
It seems that the law of entropy
Has found a home in our morality

So letâs imagine a world based off of instinct
It's every man for himself
No more handouts
No more second chances
All will hail
Pleasure exalted
Progression forever halted by the hands of our selfish nature
By the hands of our selfish nature

We would all be living in caves
Oh we would all be living in caves

Anyone can show hatred
But it takes a man to ignore his instincts
Anyone can show hatred
But it takes a man to ignore his instincts

It takes many men to build a home
But only a boy and a match to burn it down

My God, brotherhood, and heavy music
These are the only things real to me
My God, brotherhood, and heavy music
These are the only things real to me

Anyone can show hatred
But it takes a man to ignore his instincts
