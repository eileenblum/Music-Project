I've got a twenty
And a dead best friend that says
That by the end of my life
I will still be depressed
But that's ok
It's something that I've learned to accept
My problems are nothing to those with nothing left

Let's come together as one
All you fatherless sons
All you love-lost people
Children under the gun
All you nine-to-five workers
Keeping a smile on your face
All who feel out of place

This stage means nothing
We are all the same
In this world just a number
In heaven a name
And I'll take family over fame any day

Oh choke me with music
Your love, your spirit
Let's strip away all the distractions that we never needed
Any judgments on religion or political opinion
We're all only human

All are welcome to the family
Showing respect and love for humanity
All are welcome to the family
All are welcome to the family

And I don't even have a twenty
Because all the money's been spent
And now it's just me, my dog, and the heart that lies in my chest
But that's ok
It's something that I've learned to accept
My problems are nothing to those with nothing left
