[feat. Ricky Armellino Of This Or The Apocalypse]Innovative is the title for those who create new ways
to cure boredom and new ways to communicate.
The only reason that we progress technology
is to live long and surplus complacency.

We get all caught up in the pointless things.
Putting our knees to the floor for the TV screen.
Is this another 1945?
Will we make it out alive?

Could this be,
Could this be the end of the age?

This is the end of the age.
The towers met the floor.
This is the end of the age.
Singing songs of war.

We will overcome
Our sick compulsion to seek acceptance
We will overcome
Our dependency on the world we hoard
We will overcome
Our sick compulsion to seek acceptance
We will overcome
Our very selves in the form we know

All our lives we're told to get
a job and be somebody.
But does anybody know what that means?
We all are equally searching for the
answers to trying questions.
So, can we look past opinion and acclaim.

I went through my midlife crisis at fifteen.
I faked my way and turned out alive.
Turned every corner to hear advertisements.

Turn up the noise while you're looking
up ways to market my demographic.
I think I'm too outclassed,
I'll pass on it.

This is the end of the age.
Those towers they met the floor
This is the end of the age
Singing their songs of war

All our lives
We're told to get a job and be somebody
But does anybody know what that means?
We all are equally searching for the answers to trying questions
So can we look past opinion and acclaim

We will overcome
We will overcome
We will overcome
We will overcome
