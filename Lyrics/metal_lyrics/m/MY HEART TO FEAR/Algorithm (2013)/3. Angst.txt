Oh, protest me
Protest me please
I want your loveless theology
Protest me
Protest me please
I want your fake ideology

A private reich in the heart of Kansas state
The classic victim card laced with shock value and hate
You make these signs
To invoke the feeling of fight
You're hypocrites in your own right
Enabling the ones you protest
To take action in spite

"Better open rebuke than hidden love" [Proverbs 27:5]
This is an essential verse for growth
Well pull the log out of your own eye
Because it seems that you've managed to combine them both

So send me all of your sons
Send me all of your daughters
Let me show them what a real Father looks like
There is shame in your hate
From the God you claim to praise
And God bless the children
God bless the soldiers
God bless the ones who've held your words on their shoulders
It's been so long
Oh, it's been far too long

For the evil one is disguised
As angel of light
So I can choose the place
And you can choose the time
I've always wanted to know what the face of the devil looks like

But can your faith in hate cleanse both your body and soul?
Drop the cane and tell me I'm wrong
Step outside of your home
Oh step outside your home

"Better open rebuke than hidden love"
This is an essential verse for growth
Well pull the log out of your own eye
It seems that you've managed to combine them both

This song is not a threat but an oath
I will travel the world
Singing this song
And I will show that same world hope
