[feat. Josh Hines Of Maitland]We have these lifelong dreams of being loved and esteemed
Of finding meaning beyond what we see and achieve
But nothing on earth is worth living for

We can explore the world
Discover things we've never seen
Feel things we've never felt
We could see it all
But our hearts will still be wandering
Our hearts will still be wandering

We can live on our own
Just a number in the world
It will never fulfill our souls
We can live on our own
Just a number in the world
It will never fulfill our souls

No amount of pleasure
Will ever satisfy my soul
Oh!

You don't have to be addicted
You don't have to be alone
At the end of the race there still is a place we all can call our home
You don't have to be addicted
You don't have to be alone
At the end of the race there still is a place we all can call our home
A place we can call our home

You can live alone
Just a number in this world
Drifting in and out
We are falling, falling
It's gonna be alright
And we all know
There's a light in the darkness
Don't stop reaching
Though our eyes are lost
And our souls keep giving
We're all just searching
For a place we can call our home
A place we can call our home!
