In this astrophysical plane I roam
Searching for the place they call my "home"
Searching for the God they said would save my soul
And turn it into gold
My heart had never felt so empty
As it did when my faith had left me
What purpose did I have any more
Turn off the lights and close the door

So many voices telling me what to believe
Silence
This is what I need
You said "seek and ye shall find"
Well that's exactly what I'll do

I've seen the demons in my house
Engraving their mark into my friends
I've seen the real mountain of God
I've seen that the universe will end
I've seen the demons in my house
Engraving their mark into my friends
I've seen the real mountain of God
I've seen that the universe will end

Revelatory prophecy is knocking at my door
The rocks are crying out from the sky
And to the ocean floor
I cannot explain it all
In a single song-length's time
Just know that you all are welcome to come home if you decide

I don't want the world
And its money
There's no fulfillment in looking for more ways to look past
The things that matter most

Oh, I can see the shadow
Of the end
Dawning upon the earth
To take us home
Come take us home
Oh, I can see the shadow
Of the end
Dawning upon the earth
To take us home
Come take us home

So back to the astrophysical plane we roam
Searching for the ones left all alone
Telling of the God who truly saved our souls
And turned them into gold
My heart will never feel empty
Waiting for the day
The day you take us home
The day you take us home
