Oh great father grant war lust and strength
Hail thine abysmal wrath
To be graced upon each and all
Mercilessly!
His breath shall permeate the air
On that very last of days
And that whisper from the depths
Become a deafening roar
That flame ever-burning in wait
Spread now to devour
All, yes all!

To the wailing lamentations
Let us rejoice
And kneeleth in worship
In this final hour
In the glare of damnation
Heed the voice
Abide to the will
Onwards!

For long have we awaited
This punishment eternal
Exalted father beyond blood
Behold thine children
Embrace them
And curse all men
Curse! All! Men!
Oh sons and daughters of the deep
Let thine robes fall
Unveil thine beings
Enter the light
