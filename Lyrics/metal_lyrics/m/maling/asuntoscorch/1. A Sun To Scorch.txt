Low and behold
His ascension from above to below
Beyond black and white
Tearing time asunder withershins
And fear the wayfarer's might
As he rises godwards
To cast vengeance upon thine and thee

For he rises like a newborn sun
And its rays shall shine bright
To burn the eyes of enemies
Yet warm his breed
Emanating no life but death
With each scorching glare alight

Oh that veiled name of mystery
Shall be exclaimed
Piercing even the deafest of ear
Trembling flesh shall bow
Tarnished eyes cleansed too late
For even the heart most obscured
Shall be illuminated by its light

May it ever shine
Leaving eternal drought
And wildfire in its wake
