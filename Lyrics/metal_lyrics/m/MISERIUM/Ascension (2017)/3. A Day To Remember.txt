While I'm looking at the sea
A harsh battle cry runs through me
In the fields of valor and victory
We'll give our lives to history

Settled into battle lines
Just waiting for the leaders' signs
Today is the day to die
Brothers! One day, we will unite

Hold your horses great warriors you all forget something
Without a prayer the mighty gods will do us nothing
Just kneel down to the ground and say the words after me
Oh, thee Zeus try to save us and bring us glory

Just lead us into the inexperienced
And take us to the golden palace
Just hold us in your palm which is sealed
And save us with your mighty shield

A soft wind blows through between the legs
We stand as statues and wait what's next
From mountain top to valley deep
Death's whispering and it gently weeps

Restlessness on every face
We won't vanish without a trace
We won't let our names be erased
'Til it's time to return to grace

Look at us, we're kneeling down before you mighty gods
Do not let our brothers die today like studded dogs
Let us heal our wounds with your divine remedies
Oh, thee Zeus let us fuck the shit out of our enemies

Just lead us into the inexperienced
And take us to the golden palace
Just hold us in your palm which is sealed
And save us with your mighty shield

Just lead us into the inexperienced
And take us to the golden palace
Just hold us in your palm which is sealed
And save us with your mighty shield
Just lead us into the inexperienced
And take us to the golden palace
Just hold us in your palm which is sealed
And save us with your mighty shield

Bring us glory
