Hear the words of my silent prayer, Gods
Help me leave these barren lands and lead me into the light
But don't hide my mortal name when a new age comes
Let me be remembered as a hero, the damned one

Tear my soul out of my body, oh Gods...
And convey it to the celestial ones
Let the hero to die in honour
Hear a genuine repentance â of a slaughter

Finally we can feel
The dying moan of the agonist
Tear the yarn, forsake your will
Time to leave

Your false freedom will be your curse
Don't let yourself be averse
Divine descension will be your gift
To oblivion

Hear the words of my silent prayer, Gods
Help me leave these barren lands and lead me into the light
But don't hide my mortal name when a new age comes
Let me be remembered as a hero, the damned one

Wash away the tears from my eyes...
Its every drop impregnates the soil â with fear and disgust

Finally we can feel
The dying moan of the agonist
Tear the yarn, forsake your will
Time to leave

Your false freedom will be your curse
Don't let yourself be averse
Divine descension will be your gift
To oblivion

Hear the words of my silent prayer, Gods
Help me leave these barren lands and lead me into the light
But don't hide my mortal name when a new age comes
Let me be remembered as a hero

Hear the words of my silent prayer, Gods
Help me leave these barren lands and lead me into the light
But don't hide my mortal name when a new age comes
Let me be remembered as a hero, the damned one
