Sisters of fate turn thy eyes toward the ashamed hero's yarn
After the great war he became an outcast, torn
His actions turn the Dalia into saffron dust
He's wandering dishonored but desiring bloodlust

My tormented soul risen and fallen
The blood drenching the satisfaction
This perplexity makes me uncertain
I wish I could disappear â escape from their scornful eyes

Sisters of fate, there's no time to wait
Gather the threads, feel their weight
Sacrifice of blood, with honour and pride
Amidst the senseless slaughter

Sisters of fate turn thy eyes toward the ashamed hero's yarn
After the great war he became an outcast torn
With confused mind, he'd have taken arms against friend or foe
Benign gods restrained from the final blow

My tormented soul risen and fallen
The blood drenching the satisfaction
This perplexity makes me uncertain
I wish I could disappear

Silent sea weeps with golden sorrow
My noble actions cast to waves
Flowing towards bleak tomorrow
Sinking into ocean graves â and buried in oblivion

Oldest of fates, strain shears abhorred on wrecked yarn
Of one whose life is but ruins forlorn
