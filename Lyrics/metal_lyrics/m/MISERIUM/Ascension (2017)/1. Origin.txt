A cruel vision beats from scratch
The divine will makes the land eldritch
The Moirai see and kindly agree
With this aim, this dreadful destiny

Sisters of Fate, there's no time to wait
Gather the threads, feel their weight
Sacrifice of blood, with honour and pride
Amidst the senseless slaughter

The smell of death, the taste of threat
Blackening the sense of the last breath
Stellar flames, bloody rains
Promote pain to increase itself

Godless weight of wrath
Unequal dance with death,
The fear in your hearts
Will guide you 'til the end

Slake the wish inside
This war will be so sublime
Tame the fearless hearts
And guide them through their pride

Tangled skein cut to length
For the tapestry of mortal lives

Waving torments
Glorious doom
Infected wounds
Bring lifeless gloom

Whispering voices
Bitter disease
Cast in shadow
Resentful sleaze

When someone else tells the tale of your lifeline
All you need is the will to be just and true
May your fate be carved in stone deep inside
No one can find your way, only you

A sharpened blade and the gathered threads,
Waiting in Clotho's hands
Lachesis, Atropos
Set the line when our time ends

When someone else tells the tale of your lifeline
All you need is the will to be just and true
May your fate be carved in stone deep inside
No one can find your way, only you

Devastating forces fighting
Infected wounds bring lifeless gloom
Try to reach the essence of silence
To understand this glorious doom

Try to reach the essence of solitude
To understand this doom

When someone else tells the tale of your lifeline
All you need is the will to be just and true
May your fate be carved in stone deep inside
No one can find your way, only you
When someone else tells the tale of your lifeline
All you need is the will to be just and true
May your fate be carved in stone deep inside
No one can find your way, only you

Waving torments
Glorious doom
Infected wounds
Bring lifeless gloom

Whispering voices
Bitter disease
Cast in shadow
Resentful sleaze
