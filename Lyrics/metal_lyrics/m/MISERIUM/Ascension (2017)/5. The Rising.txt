Glittering lights roar before my eyes
A sharp noise taking me by surprise
Heavy scars glow and pulse in my body
Now my time comes to let myself revive

Crimson blood and broken heart
Our formation shan't fall apart
Just raise your arms up to the sky
Transform this war to the finest art

Rough blades, shields and armors collide
Brave heroes lie on the ground, petrified
In foreign soil Elysium denied
Of these two worlds I choose the light of life

Crimson blood and broken heart
Our formation shan't fall apart
Just raise your arms up to the sky
Transform this war to the finest art

Remember our true, brave brothers
Who fell in the great battle at Troy
Never forget their faces
Too many coins spent,
Too much treasure wandered to Charon

Brothers I call you to take a vast revenge
A deeper cut to wreak havoc upon them
Swim through the river of fear and blood
Then marching through their rotten corpses flood

Crimson blood and broken heart
Our formation shan't fall apart
Just raise your arms up to the sky
Transform this war to the finest art

Remember our true, brave brothers
Who fell in the great battle at Troy
Never forget their faces
Too many coins spent,
Too much treasure wandered to Charon

Rising souls fly high
Dressed in milky white
Flames aim toward the sky
Their lights coverin' the night

Remember our true, brave brothers
Who fell in the great battle at Troy
Never forget their faces
Too many coins spent,
Too much treasure wandered to Charon

With a half-dead smile on our face
Try to say farewell from the other side
