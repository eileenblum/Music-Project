We fought to the grave
Blade clashed on blade
For each mistake
One's falling

Faced Impossible odds
Defied the gods
Who planned our downfall
At Troy's gates

Still, death comes for everyone
Darkness consumes every light
Immortality's waiting for us
Before the sun goes down

We lost everything
And lost everyone
All that ever mattered
Is long gone

This bloodshed can't end
Our wounds will not mend
'Til they are avenged
With anger

Still, death comes for everyone
Darkness consumes every light
Immortality's waiting for us
Before the sun goes down

This
Cannot be the ultimate
War
That shatters the mind and the
Will
My only wish is
To finally finish
This
At the unyielding walls of
Troy
That try to halt
Us
Bleed us, break us
Drive us away

What keeps us sane through this strife?
Immortality
How could reason prevail?
In this fight

This
Seems to be the ultimate
War
That shatters the mind and the
Will
My only hope is
To finally cope with
This
Blasphemous misfortune at
Troy
That seems to haunt
Us
Bleed us, break us
Drive us away

What keeps us sane through this strife?
Immortality
How could reason prevail?
Glorious dominance
What makes us more than we are?
Our actions' echoes
Death lies where we all shall fail

Pay the wage of Charon
Show the golden coins
Do not be afraid
Take a seat 'cause
This will be your last journey
