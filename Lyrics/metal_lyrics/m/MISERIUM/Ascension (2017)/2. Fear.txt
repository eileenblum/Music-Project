Young warriors'
Blood on the walls
Silent screams
Run through the alleys

A strange battle song
Echoes all day long
The fear in our hearts
Becomes unbearable

Just watching us mortal sons we're washing away your fort
With the power of the great ancient flood
The light of flames what we made with the temple of your unknown god
Can show you how we'll destroy with rage

Wires in the walls clockworks in heads
The dawn of a new age is behind the glass
Just waiting to plug this sick connection
We'll all become dead or slaves so it's time to fight or

Runaway to the hills
Unleash our fears
Runaway and leave the palace
Cowardice or courage is our name?

Young faced boys
Become warriors
Breathless moments before
Those endless errors

A strange battle song
Suggest the number of the throng
The fear in our hearts
Makes us truly strong

Just watching us mortal sons we're washing away your fort
With the power of the great ancient flood
The light of flames what we made with the temple of your unknown god
Can show you how we'll destroy with rage

Wires in the walls clockworks in heads
The dawn of a new age is behind the glass
Just waiting to plug this sick connection
We'll all become dead or slaves so it's time to fight or

Runaway to the hills
Unleash our fears
Runaway and leave the palace
Cowardice or courage is our name?

Wires in the walls clockworks in heads
The dawn of a new age is behind the glass
Just waiting to plug this sick connection
We'll all become dead or slaves so it's time to fight or

Runaway to the hills
Unleash our fears

Cowardice or courage is our name?
