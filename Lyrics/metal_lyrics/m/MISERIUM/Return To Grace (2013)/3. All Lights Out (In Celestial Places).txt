all lights went out above the wasteland
the atmosphere was penetrated
by falling star-kin cast to dust
that glare like pieces of broken glass
in veins

i feed the self-encompassing chaos
i devour the shift of permanence
i long for stationarity
i long for the change to come

the sky was illuminated
blazing trails of light were torn
the past replaced by new-formed bodies
not of light but dirt and mud
of rains

i see my own thoughts rotting dissolved
i disguise my fear and disgust
i have to find a reason to be
i long for the change to come
change must come

the sky was illuminated
blazing trails of light were torn
the past replaced by new-formed bodies
not of light but dirt and mud
of rains...
