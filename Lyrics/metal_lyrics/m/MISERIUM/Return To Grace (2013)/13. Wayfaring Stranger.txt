I am a poor wayfaring stranger
While traveling through, this world of woe.
But thereâs no sickness, toil or danger
In that bright land, to which I go.

Iâm going there to see my father
Iâm going there no more to roam;
Iâm just a going over Jordan
Iâm just a going over home.

I know dark clouds will gather 'round me
I know my way so rough and steep;
Yet golden fields lie just before me
Where weary eyes, no more shall weep

Iâm going there to see my mother
She said sheâd meet me when I come;
Iâm just a going over this world
Iâm just a going over home.

Iâll soon be free from earthly trials,
my body sleep in the old church yard,
Iâll drop the cross of self denial
and enter in my great reward,

Iâm going there to see my savior
to praise his name forevermore,
Iâm just a going over Jordan.
Iâm just a going over home.

Iâm going there to see my mother
She said sheâd meet me when I come;
Iâm just a going over this world
Iâm just a going over home.
