the beginning and the end are just the same
we return where we were born to the Celestial Spheres
to the formless void above which the face of god lingers
to the primordial cosmos where no stars shine

"in principio erat Verbum et Verbum erat apud Deum et Deus erat Verbum"

God was alone in the nothingness he was also nothing, but
a thought - he thought of himself, so he came to be an idea,
entwined in itself like the snake that bites its own tail
so God became the word and the word was with him

there was no time as time stood still
an infinity has passed every second

"terra autem erat inanis et vacua et tenebrae super faciem abyssi et spiritus Dei ferebatur super aquas"

then God thought of matter and matter came to be
he severed the arid land from the sea
he painted soil with will to consecrate
for belief has power to create

impure matter so constrained and so imperfect
incapable cannot reflect God
frail dimensions insufficient for the pattern
thatâs why matter and idea had to be torn
separated by a veil not to be penetrated
impervious for mortal eyes

"et lux in tenebris lucet et tenebrae eam non conprehenderunt"

and so it came to pass that god was also split in two
the demiurge, or logos and the Primum Movens

"sic transit gloria mundi"

the creation was done parallel
the logos created the ideas
and the prime mover has done
its best to mirror them
Logos: planting soul seeds
Prime Mover: planting star seeds
and then they both watched
how their cosmos grew

then God thought of matter and matter came to be
he severed the arid land from the sea
he painted soil with will to consecrate
for belief has power to create
