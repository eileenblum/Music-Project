Why are my words lost in the void
never reaching up to the skies?

Where have you gone?
Where have you gone my Lord?

What happens to our prayers?
Why don't you answer our cries?
Why do you hide from us,
abandon us, and forget our dreams?
What happens to your children
without you showing us the way?
Why do you hide from us?
Why don't you ever answer our cries?

What happens to the children happens to the choir
of lost voices crying out your name?

when did we lose the gift of communication?
when did you mute our voice of complaint?
why canât we speak free without self-doubt?
why canât we perceive the world without boundaries?

why canât we see the truth inside the lie?
why did you let us wander on untrodden paths?

when did we lose the gift of communication?
when did you mute our voice of complaint?
why canât we speak free without self-doubt?
why canât we perceive the world without boundaries?

why canât we just join you leaving all behind?
if you will redeem us why waste our time?

where have you gone?
where have you gone, lord?

Disregard not a prayer, don't discard every single cry!
Stop denying from us, and witness us embracing our dreams!
Just linger above the waters remain here for a little while
donât leave us for an Eden suspended in a frozen distant sky

stay
