this night the moonâs darkened
the horizonâs lost in tint
star-stained sky and light-tainted cities
and nothing in between

the lookout-towerâs empty
the forestâs silent, still
time for a last dance
time for the last words
time to test the will

this night the moonâs darkened
the horizons lost in tint
star-stained sky and light-tainted cities
and no one in between

my mouth of prayers is empty
i am silent, still
the crushing weight of stillness
descends over me
and I surrender myselfâ¦ to thee

take a last breath
embrace the sky
fly high with the wind
be what you are
stardust

the crushing weight of stillness
descends over me
and I surrender myself to thee
and Iâll be born again
