Your intruding presence is intolerable
within our sacred garden amongst our faithful walls

you are no longer welcome in this heart so taintless
nor in this hollow temple devoid of faith and trust
you are damned to wander through the fields of sorrow
forgotten, barren vistas âneath tempest-bearing clouds

to learn subordination and feel humiliation
to face the consequences suffer the aftermath
pouring down on my skin the essence of heavy rains
washing away the sin bursting into my veins

to cleanse me from within and eliminate
your poisoning presence with the lingering sense
of guilt and shame

I miss your tender touch your fragrant, sensual scent
your frail figure in my arms your voice of assurance
you are always desired in this heart so lonesome
sheltered amongst memoires so often conjured up

features well-remembered traced in air by fingers
your every single sentence recited all by heart
but all torrents of passion run dry without action
longing without deeds is dead all of my deeds are dead

pouring down on my skin the essence of heavy rains
washing away the sin bursting into my veins
to cleanse me from within and eliminate
your haunting presence and the lingering sense
of fear and loss

destiny fades casually
memories frozen eternally
harmony breaks the blankness
agony leaves you in darkness
