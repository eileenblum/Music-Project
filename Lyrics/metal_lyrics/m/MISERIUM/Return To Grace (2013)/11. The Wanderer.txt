the wanderer returns home
ashes to ashes dust to dust
stars to stars souls to souls
leaving all matter behind

leaving the taste of death behind
with the cold earth of mud and rigid bones
leaving the ashes behind
parting from all the glittering stars

from all their lights
and from all the shadows they cast
parting from all the vast
emptiness that fills the hearts

tearing memories apart retaining but one
his image, holding onto it to guide them through the endless void
on the way where no stars shine and they cannot
navigate by their light

an eternal return to the infinite horizon
through the veil that mortal eyes cannot penetrate
past the wandering stars and the standing stars
past the firmaments and the prime mover himself

"omnia per ipsum facta sunt et sine ipso factum est nihil quod factum est"

back to the void the image the idea
to where it all began for that's where it has to end
for the beginning shall be the end
and the end shall be a beginning anew

tearing memories apart retaining but one
his image, holding onto it to guide them through the endless void
on the way where no stars shine and they cannot
navigate by their light

the wanderer returns home
ashes to ashes dust to dust
stars to stars souls to souls
leaving all matter behind

leaving the taste of death behind
with the cold flesh of mud and rigid bones
leaving the ashes behind
parting from all the glittering stars

from all their lights
and from all the shadows they cast
parting from all the vast
emptiness that fills the hearts

leaving all the lies behind the concept of prayers
the patterns of heaven of heaven and hell
"Parting is all we know all we know of heaven,
And all we need of hell And all we need of hell"

...so the beginning and the end are the same...
