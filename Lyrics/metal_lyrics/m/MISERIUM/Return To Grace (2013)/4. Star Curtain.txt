ages have passed
star-dust went cold
ashes formed mankind
and souls wondered
what is it like

to be bound by time
and thus souls left behind the formless arche
the void of apeiron
and took bodies of ashes
yearning to feel the sunshine on their skin

wind in their hair
cold in their bones
blood in their veins
love in their hearts

and the death in their mouth
to feel the binding of time
to be subject of age and decay

they enjoyed the light of stars
and bathed in each other's lights
they learned to love and hate
to wait and anticipate
