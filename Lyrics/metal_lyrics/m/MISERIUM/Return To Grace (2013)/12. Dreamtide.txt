Feel free like a particle
swim down on the stream thatâs human life
do the best you can in this world,
and leave footprints in the hearts

Life seems like a hurricane,
or a floating pattern on a painting
experience will make us prudent
all that we know can be stolen, right?

destiny fades casually
memories frozen eternally
harmony breaks the blankness
agony leaves you in darkness

Fight for your thoughts and faith
Believe in yourself, cause your acts determine you,
depression is not the way
which you have to walk on

Life seems like a hurricane,
or a floating pattern on a painting
regression is not the way
you will know it one day

destiny fades casually
memories frozen eternally
harmony breaks the blankness
agony leaves you in darkness

Lost in the dreamtide like a foolish childboy
It's time to break out from the dark
Leave the painful memories and scars
chances will be reborn
