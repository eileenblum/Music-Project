â¦and then they realised they can't return
they became infected with life
caught in its circle of change became slaves
to the snake that bites its own tail

and they learned to fear and shake
to wait and anticipate their return

they wanted to hear the word
to understand the logos once more
yet all they could see was but the face of God
in the works of the prime mover

ember went cold
skin wrinkled
bones broke
veins run dry
the hearts emptied
and the taste of death was bitter

and they learned to fear and shake
to wait and anticipate their return

the stars gave off all their lights
in bright supernovas
and the star-dust felt alone
for its parents had all passed
and the star-dust felt alone
for its parents had all passed
ancient darkness returned but
the voice of god lingered up there no more

the souls became sick of life
attempted to escape
by any means necessary
by prayers of faith
and outbursts of hate yet
the bindings of matter
and time were too strong

they had to transcend
to find and see and be the image
and not the pattern any more
to return to the stars...

...from where they came lit aflame
the stars from which they became
to end it where it all began
and the earth the earth was lit
by millions of new-lit soul-stars
and their light formed the pattern
and the pattern became the image
and they left the earth behind
