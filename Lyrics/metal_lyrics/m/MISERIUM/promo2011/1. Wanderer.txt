the wanderer returns home
ashes to ashes
dust to dust
stars to stars
souls to souls
leaving all matter behind

leaving the taste of death behind
with the cold earth of mud and rigid bones
leaving the ashes behind

parting from all the glittering stars
from all their lights and from all the shadows they cast
parting from all the vast emptiness
that fills the hearts

leaving behind the concept of prayers
the patterns of heaven and hell
"Parting is all we know of heaven,
And all we need of hell."

tearing memories apart
one by one
through the void
holding onto his dear image only
to guide them on the way
where no stars shine
and they cannot navigate by their light

"omnia per ipsum facta sunt et sine ipso factum est nihil quod factum est"

an eternal return to the infinite horizon
to the veil that mortal eyes cannot penetrate
past the wandering stars and the standing stars
past the firmaments and the prime mover himself
back to the void
the image
the idea
to where it all began
for that's where it has to end
for the beginning shall be the end
and the end shall be a beginning anew
as the beginning and the end are the same
