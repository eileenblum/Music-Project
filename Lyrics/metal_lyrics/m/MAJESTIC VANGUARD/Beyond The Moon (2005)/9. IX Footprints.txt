[Music &amp; Lyrics: Daniel Eskilsson]

Heavy wounds are bleeding,
when you leave your empty soul
Search to breath the lightness,
but shadows only see the dawn

So many fortunetellers
have put your faith in a harmless stone
Youâre lost in endless voices
and fight your way into hidden storms

There is a dreamland,
a land by gold,
a brand new kingdom stands,
a dream so old,
a land of gold sand
itâs made for you and me
I pray to see the land

Oh Father of might...
Give me!
oooh
... a sign up in the air
oooh
See the footprints in the golden sand
When you cross the river, feel no pain
Just take His hand,
Heâll lead you to the Promised Land

See my footprints on the golden sand
when I cross the river there is no pain
I take His hand and
we enter the Promised Land

When the scenes from lifetime
flash in front your haunted eyes,
you see a Man from dreamland,
who guides your footsteps in the sand

I feel His mighty hand,
the footprints in the sand
