[Music &amp; Lyrics: Samuel FredÃ©n]

I wonder and I search
Who is the man I always show,
at my home or in the church
Help me I want to know

Could there be a difference
that depends on where I am
What I do will make sense,
Iâll show them what I can

I donât want to wear a religious mask
Prepare me to perform your task

I donât want to be an actor
What I want is to be real
I donât want to be an actor
Clean my heart so I can feel
your presence

Iâll be the one they expect me to be,
I do the things I always do,
but now I will be free
Send me I want to go
