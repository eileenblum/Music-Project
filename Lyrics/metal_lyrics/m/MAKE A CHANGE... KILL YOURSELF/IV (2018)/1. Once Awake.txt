Once awake I was - vibrant with a thirst for life
An insatiable hunger for the world and everything it had to offer
Come on, anything, anyone, anywhere, anytime
No challenge too great to overcome
Possessed by a determination to be strong and survive
Now the world passes me by unnoticed
I can barely crawl out of bed, let alone find the motivation to go on
Feeding this useless machine of rusty old broken parts
Falling apart from wear, weathered by use and abuse that never seem to fit together, no matter how hard I try
Everyday a new puzzle left unsolved
The future never held less meaning
Once awake I close my eyes and simply drift away
My thirst has been drowned
My hunger has been quelled
I am nauseous from the feast of life
There is nothing left of me, there is nothing left for me
No passion, no heart, no purpose, no soul
Never shall I be what I once was,
A dreamless sleep I seek
Once awake I was
