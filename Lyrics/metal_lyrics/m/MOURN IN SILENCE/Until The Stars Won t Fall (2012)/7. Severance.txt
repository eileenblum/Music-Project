It was the darkness and the light
And then day and night
It was frost and flame, life and pain.
A descent through myself
Lying on the ground, blind

7 parts of me are pushing from inside
To leave up my soul and set me free inside
My flesh thrills before the sick and cursed soul
7 parts if me are burning inside
Consuming every instant of life
Consuming my heart screaming just pain

The Severance

7 souls that come out from my veins
My wounded heart ..bleeds
Through the shadow I can feel the severance.

Iâve lost myself, Iâve dismissed the reason
And now my wounds keep on bleeding
And so it was the darkness and the light and then day and night
It was everything and nothing
