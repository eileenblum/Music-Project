I've seen the power of time twisting and breaking existence
I've heard the wind to rule the land
"Crossing the doors of the night I starred at the moon
I kissed the stars ..and let myself fall."

Like an angel without wings I've sunk in the abyss

I burn in Tenebris
Like a tear I've drawn a furrow on the face of the sky
Losing myself in the emptiness.. it's the beginning of ruin

Embraced by the night, I descry the face of sunset
A feeble light reaches my hands
"Close to the cold abyss, fadeout of light,
Here is the end of every trace of life."

Like an angel without wings I've sunk in the abyss

I burn in Tenebris
Like a tear I've drawn a furrow on the face of the sky
Losing myself in the emptiness, it's the beginning of ruin

"Sicut angelus sine alis
Cecidit in profundum abissi"
