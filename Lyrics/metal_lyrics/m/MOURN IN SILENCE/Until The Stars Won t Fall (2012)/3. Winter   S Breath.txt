The wind talks to the earth, a tired sun let the clouds come
The sky dresses up in grey, ice covers everything
The sun stays without eyes to see the dying earth to ceasing to be
Time stops and listens to the winterâs breath
Listen to the winterâs breath
We, who listen to the wind look to the moon crying
See the snow falling and hear the winter calling
Winter
Finally the snow is falling on the earth, it will be eternal ice

Like the infinity everything remains without time
While the snow falls and renders everything without form
Hiding life at the eyes of the sky
In an eternal sleep everything rests forever
Listen to the winterâs breath
We who listen to the wind look to the moon crying
See the snow falling and hear the winter calling
Winter
Finally the snow is falling on the earth, it will be eternal ice

A wind blows, unhold by things
Itâs the white breath of a winter that never dies
A freeze that grows, unearthly cold,
In the depths of every menâs heart
