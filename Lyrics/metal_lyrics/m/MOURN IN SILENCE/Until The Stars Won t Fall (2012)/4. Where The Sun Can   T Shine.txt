The sky is crying, stormâs embrace
Rain falls on the earth,
Tears that bring cold sadness
Where the sun canât shine, days are dying
My eyes wonât see the light
Shadows will reveal the path.

I need to find another place where emptiness is gone
I need to try, for too much time Iâve lost my tears

Walking through the mist, Iâm searching for the end
I follow, the sparkling lights of candles

Majestic night kill my pain
Give me all the light
That your stars can grant me
Where the sun canât shine, days are dying
My eyes wonât see the light
Shadows will reveal the path.
I need to find another place where emptiness is gone
I need to try, for too much time Iâve lost my tears
