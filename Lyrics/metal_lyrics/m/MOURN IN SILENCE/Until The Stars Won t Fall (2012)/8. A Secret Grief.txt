âA light breeze blows at the end of the day
The night comes down blinding the eyes
Of the creatures that live beyond the light
Starting its race against time.â

Youâve followed me since the sky exists
Your sunset is my existence 
And while your rays take away the last moment light

I see you appearing following my tears

My destiny, Night
My secret grief

The Twilight whispers
Shadows swallow every shape
For a moment I can see you shine on the horizon

I see you appearing, following my tears

My destiny, Night
My secret grief
