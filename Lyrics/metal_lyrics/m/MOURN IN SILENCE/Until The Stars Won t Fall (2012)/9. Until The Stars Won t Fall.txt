Cold grey eyes looking through the sky
A last ray of light
Wings ruined by time, are waiting to fly again
No words for tomorrow
Donât waste your time
You will breakdown
Hear the voices

Here where flowers die, silence change our words
And stones keep the death
Until the stars wonât fall

Brushed by wind, petals fall like tears
Drops in the ocean
Closed lips, lie here silently
Donât waste your time
You will breakdown
Hear the voices

Here where flowers die, silence change our words
And stones keep the death
Until the stars wonât fall
