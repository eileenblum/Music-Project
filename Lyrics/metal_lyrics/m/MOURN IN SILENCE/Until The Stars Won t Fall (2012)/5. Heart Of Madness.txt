âThereâs a black, black cat in a black, black hole
If you watch his eyes, you will lose your soul.â

Follow me in the depth, where the silence screams
He screams desperation
Where the moon looks the light losing itself through my hands
With still sadness
We are heart of madness
The desire of sadness, the blood that stains
The fire that burns

We fell from grace
We walk on the earth, emptiness surrounds us

Listen, the endless silence cries
I hear nothing
Harmony reigns its last instants
While the time drags everything to the end
We are heart of madness
The desire of sadness, the blood that stains
The fire that burns

We fell from grace
We walk on the earth, emptiness surrounds us
Heart of madness
