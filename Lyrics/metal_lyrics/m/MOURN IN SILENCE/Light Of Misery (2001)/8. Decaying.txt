A dress of ice will cover my flowers,
the power of chill will stop the time
and all the thing while the wind will sweep
what remeins of my children away

"Father, i've done my work,
Lucifer and his angels have sank into oblivion,
your compassion has blind their eyes
but it has not saved their souls"

A ray will reflect itself on your face,
angels of darkness, and while your eyes are burning
i'll be there crying to see you...

"In my tears you'll understand all my despair
in my words the repentance and the shame,
in my heart there will be anything but sorrow and pain"
