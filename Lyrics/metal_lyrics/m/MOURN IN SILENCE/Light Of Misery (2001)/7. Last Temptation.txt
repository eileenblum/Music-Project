I walk along the path of the damned
beside the shadow of death to please the cursed
and rape the souls of the repentant.
I am the fire which burns the plant of compassion
I am the hatred which wraps eternal damnation.

...I drown in the tears of the dead...

I live to destroy the sky, obscuring sun
with my storm and burning the dead with my love

"Deliver me from evil take my soul on your lap
in the garden of death"

In this garden i grow my virtue
torturing the bodies of tempted souls.
