Between ice and flames my reign will arise,
where thives and torturer will find their home,
where weak persons' tears won't find love and compassion
but the neverending torture with pure violence.

...sorrow and tears will be the cry of my empire...

Here the only music will be the divine lamentation,
richness and ambition won't be a sin
but a reason of proudness.
Here i'll build up my sweet home and i'll call it Inferno.
