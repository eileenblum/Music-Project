Beneath the fire,
wax is writhing in motionless mourning
from envy to damnation on the candle of affirmation
between the ribs of the weak and jaws of beasts sacrificing
their lives to evil there is a safe support.

Drops of opaque wax, greedy rats earn color from hatred,
new color of ambition.
Drops of incandescent wax will wet their
reign with unavoidable shame.

Deep river beds are devuring the ground and dying
horrible shapes without eyes
thanks to those who want to be better
the gear of discord will move
in perpetual and alternating motion.

Drops of opaque wax, greedy rats earn color from hatred,
new color of ambition.
Their smoke will rise, anxious to mud the sky.

Creature of temptation
preach apparent beatitude with immaculate damnation.
