Intense light will slowly break the shadow
Penetrating the sorrow of obscurity
Behind the end of silence

Like a perpetual fire infinite time will burn
Leaving behind just the ashes of despair

Like a tempest it will wipe out the traces
Of sadness
Giving light to every forgotten being

I will meet you in the shadow
I will wind your body
By holding tight you cold  hands
I will give you back the heat and ancient light

You will erase the past

The power of light will destroy defects
And will kiss those who are weeping

You will erase the past
And will never shed a tears because of it
