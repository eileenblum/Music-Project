My figure represent your pain
My image reflects your suffering
In my body the scars of time
In my voice your dejection
My vests hide a dying fading life
And by his wound you ll see
My blood is flowing

In deep shadows I wait

In my hate you ll find yourself
From my hand you ll feel the force
Rage will be the one that will bring you deception
And you ll kneel behind me
And you ll cry with your eyes tired of distress

In deep shadows I wait thru my memories

Before dishearted and unarmed time
I slip down with your tears
Because I am the cries of your eyes

In the path of time I walk wounded by disease
Carrying my spirit thru the end
