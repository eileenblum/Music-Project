Behind the deepest black
In the abyss of desperation between my far memories
A weak ray of light, embraced by darkness
Shines of dejection

From deep misery is watching you
Waiting by your hands the promised charity
In her face desperation
In her eyes time s deception
In her pray the last hope

Gloria in excelsis deo

I ll overwhelm sorrow and burning my steps i ll step on suffering behind me
I ll leave void and silence
To guard your defeat
So that you cannot forget

Gloria in excelsis deo

The dominion of sadness will get rid of dreams
Invoking infinity in silence
