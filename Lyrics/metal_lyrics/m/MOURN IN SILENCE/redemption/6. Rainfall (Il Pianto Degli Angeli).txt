Carried by the wind clouds will suffocate the light in a weak embrace
The sky will get dark and make the tears of angels fall down

Thousand tears

The wind will bend every thought and shake those who have forgotten
Memories will come to me as my sons and in the wire of comfort they will sink among

Thousand tears

The rain will plough their souls
Till each drop will find its place
A flash of lighting will blind my eyes
And its cry will rip the silence
No mercy

The rivers will pick up all the sorrow and full of sadness they will slip towards infinity taking away with them

Thousand tears

The rain will consume the strength and slowly
Will give the light its space again
A flash of lighting will blind my eyes
And its cry will rip the silence
