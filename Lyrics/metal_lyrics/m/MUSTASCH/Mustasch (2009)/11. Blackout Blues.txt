IÂ´m one of those who overdoseGot no thoughts about mortalityI love itItÂ´s a war for standing tallTo defend my personalityI love itIÂ´m in a race, wonÂ´t hesitateItÂ´s the Blackout Blues you hearYou love it Self destructionItÂ´s another form of controlAt least itÂ´s youWho decide which way to go IÂ´m gonna sink another drinkMind burning rocket fuelI love itI get a kick from feeling sickAnd I puke on people like youI love itItÂ´s a race, donÂ´t hesitateLetÂ´s play the Blackout Blues Self destruction...
