The wind is blowing in the top of the pinesA gloomy sky where the sun never shinesYouÂ´re Deep In The WoodsThe night is so cold and your lost, far from home Inheritor of sorrowYou are doomed to walk these landsThis vast and lonely countryIt has been formed by your own handsWithin these bordersThe winters have grown colderWhile the darkness is fallingYouÂ´re on your own, far from home Though you hate the landscapeThis is the place where you belongTo be alone in silenceSmoke your pipe until kingdom comeInheritor of sorrowWill you survive this horrorWhile the darkness is fallingYouÂ´re on your own, far from home The wind is blowing in the top of the pinesA gloomy sky where the sun never shinesDeep In The Woods, where the night is so coldYouÂ´re lost, far from home
