I donÂ´t need to hideAll the gifts I haveYou wanna hear some moreHereÂ´s the score I remember the dayWhen I learned to playWhat a reliefKnowing this is meWhen I enter the stageNothing feels strangeNo it feels all rightGrief and guilt frustration died IÂ´m living my dreamThe Audience Is Listening This is insaneI donÂ´t need to hideThe gifts I haveYou wanna hear some moreHereÂ´s the scoreI was born to playGrief and anger blown away IÂ´m living my dream...
