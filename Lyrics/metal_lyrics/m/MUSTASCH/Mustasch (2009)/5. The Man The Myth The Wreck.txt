Well, IÂ´m sorry I drank too much whiskeyBut I am the starIÂ´m fire, youÂ´re gasoline babySo why be around YouÂ´re just a writer of yesterdayÂ´s newsYou knew what to expectGot no feelings of guiltGot no feelings of shameIÂ´m the man, IÂ´m the myth, IÂ´m the wreckThe Man The Myth The Wreck The Man The Myth The WreckI can see that youÂ´re hurtBut IÂ´m still in the spotlightSo thanks for the words Your writing is nothing but yesterdayÂ´s newsYou knew what to expectNo feelings of guiltNo feelings of shameIÂ´m the man, IÂ´m the myth, IÂ´m the wreckThe Man The Myth The Wreck
