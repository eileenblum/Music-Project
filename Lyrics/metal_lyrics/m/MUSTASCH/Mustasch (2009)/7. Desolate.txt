I live a life unsatisfiedI must break everything I likeNew mistakes, a piece of cakeI ran into the wall againI have died a thousand timesI donÂ´t know if I am alive ItÂ´s that voice I hate againI must obeyDesolateYouÂ´re doing great Scatterbrain, my middle nameI forced myself into this painLittle girl, youÂ´ve been hurtTell me whoÂ´s your daddy now ItÂ´s that voice I hate again... You stupid jerk, clean up your dirtOne day I know I have to learnI live my life unsatisfiedAnd I break everything I love ItÂ´s that voice I hate again...
