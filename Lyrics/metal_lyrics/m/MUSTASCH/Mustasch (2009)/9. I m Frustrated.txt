IÂ´m FrustratedAnd hereÂ´s where everything must endSo frustratedAnd you thought you knew me wellIÂ´m not crazyScreaming and shouting, that wonÂ´t helpÂ´Cause IÂ´m FrustratedPlease forgive me for what I said I am absent minded, I donÂ´t know what I doWhere are my keys, where did I put that bloody phoneI even donÂ´t know how to find myselfI wonÂ´t get no relief until IÂ´m dead IÂ´m FrustratedI am tormented by myselfAnd I hate itWhy canÂ´t I be like everybody elseIÂ´m FrustratedThis is where everything must end Light a candle for me, these patterns I must breakI must be strong instead of run awayI wonÂ´t get my relief until IÂ´m deadI wonÂ´t get no relief until IÂ´m dead This restlessness has made me to concedeWhat is wrong with me, why canÂ´t I fall asleepI wonÂ´t get no relief until IÂ´m deadIÂ´ll get my inner peace when IÂ´m dead
