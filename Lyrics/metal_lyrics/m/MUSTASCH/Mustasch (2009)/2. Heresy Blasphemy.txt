Hey Satan, here I amIt seems like you finally wonFour riders, here they comeChildren of the earth, run Crusaders from the westTime has come to clean up this messBlack robed hypocritesJesus words, you have twist and ripped Crucifixion, hunger and plagueHas turned into an evil playBlood is flowing like acid rainHeresy Blasphemy, thatÂ´s your name And your dirty power-mad urgeHas destroyed my holy churchYou are not the ones to lead the blindOnly the penitent one will survive this time Crucifixion, hunger and plague... Having thoughts about eternal lifeI think you are notÂ´Cause some day youÂ´ll also die Hey Satan, here I standIt seems like you finally wonFour riders, here they comeChildren of the earth, run Crucifixion, hunger and plague...
