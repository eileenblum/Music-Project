IÂ´m a man with a fully function disorderIÂ´ve got balls enough to cover it upIf youÂ´re prepared to stand the slaughterIÂ´m so LonelyAnd I tell you why no bloody chanceThat you in any way can control me You say you really want to hold meIÂ´m to wildI hate to say I told you soI was rightYou said I was the coldestCold as iceBut you can hold meYou can have me for a while ThatÂ´s just right, IÂ´m not soberThatÂ´s the way I like to beAmong people who donÂ´t know meIÂ´m so LonelyIf you really like to have me aroundYou will have to stand my disorder You say you really want to hold me...
