IÂ´ve been disownedYes I was aloneBut I tell you now, baby, thatÂ´s cool I have reached the pointWhere itÂ´s do or donÂ´tAnd I know you have been there tooGet ready to go I have learned a million timesThat a race ainÂ´t runUntil the racing been doneIÂ´m victorious, you better face downMine, the victory is Mine There ainÂ´t nobody like meCanÂ´t somebody just seeIÂ´m ready to go I have learned a million times...
