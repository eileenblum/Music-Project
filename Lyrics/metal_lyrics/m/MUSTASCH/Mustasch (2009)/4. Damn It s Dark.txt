Damn ItÂ´s Dark, and I feel severedYou and me used to be togetherItÂ´s insane it couldnÂ´t be much betterBut now itÂ´s gone and itÂ´s gone forever But I know that we did rightWhen we ended this on timeHere I sit alone in the darkDamn, you breaker of my heart Damn ItÂ´s Dark, this is not realThough itÂ´s good IÂ´ve got a really bad feelingYou like the sun, I like the shadowYou are the light, I am the dark matter But I know that we did right... The quiet night sky reveals a shooting starCome help me with my blackened mind and my bleeding heartDamn ItÂ´s Dark
