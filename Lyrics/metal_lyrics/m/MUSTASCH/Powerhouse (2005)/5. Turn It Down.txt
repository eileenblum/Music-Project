You said your life had become a lieDonÂ´t you come around to tell me you feel awful nowYou had your time to break up lies You feel youÂ´re lonelyWhy donÂ´t you roll itMake up your mindTurn It Down What did I say, get back to bedDonÂ´t pay attention to the voices in your head Do you wanna roll itThen youÂ´d better smoke itTurn It Down
