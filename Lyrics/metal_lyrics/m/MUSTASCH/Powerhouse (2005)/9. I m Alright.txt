One down, one to goCause IÂ´m tired being pushed by youI know what I can be, look outIÂ´m hard headed, IÂ´m about to blowIÂ´m gonna show you what I wanna doAnd I know what I can beLet me tell you how I feel IÂ´m AlrightIÂ´m aliveFor the first time in my life I was born with a broken heartSo I can tell you what itÂ´s all aboutBut I know what I can be, look outTomorrow, thatÂ´s another dayTake my hand, donÂ´t you be afraidCause I know what I can beLet me tell you how I feel IÂ´m Alright... Cry, cry, wonÂ´t help you knowNowhere to run, nowhere to hideLook out baby, IÂ´m a powerhouseYou can have a piece of meCause no one knows what I can be IÂ´m Alright...
