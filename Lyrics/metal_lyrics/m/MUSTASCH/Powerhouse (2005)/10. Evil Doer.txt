Multinational rulerGot no class, got no styleCalling me Evil DoerWhile committing the crime Mind destroyed by TV-show suppliersRuns on cyberboobs and self denialLeft the common sense for trust in science The one that does not suit their plans: Remove herBrainwashed by commercial mind controllerWipe your nose, the winds of change blows colder Left with two choicesIt ainÂ´t silver or goldHereÂ´s a dish of their droppingsHave it warm, have it cold Multinational rulerGot no class, got no styleCalling me Evil DoerWhile committing the crime
