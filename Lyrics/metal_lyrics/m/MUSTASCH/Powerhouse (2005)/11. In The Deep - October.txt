DonÂ´t raise yourself in angerWhen your life is upside downNothing will be betterIf you lose your self control Raise yourself to betterGo get that peace of mindCare for all that mattersAnd leave the rest behind DonÂ´t say a word, donÂ´t you make a soundDo you wanna be a broken manPride swallowed, now you shake that handTake a lesson from another who is lost and found DonÂ´t say a word, donÂ´t you make a soundDo you wanna be a broken manPride swallowed, now you shake that handTake a lesson from another who has waved goodbye Look so many stars to seeThey rule the universe and watching meThey canÂ´t have painBut they donÂ´t know the feel of a warm summer rain Look so many souls there areWe are as many as there are starsBut weÂ´re in painGod knows that our tears are warm like summer rain
