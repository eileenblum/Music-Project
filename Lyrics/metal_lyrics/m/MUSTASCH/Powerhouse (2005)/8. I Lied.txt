I said hello where are you fromAnd what is wrong, whatÂ´s wrongIs it what we have become, and what weÂ´ve doneAnd what we didnÂ´t do to get things undoneThe truth will sacrificeWhile we tried, while we tried to work it all outNow I need a place to hideI Lied, I Lied to you baby, thatÂ´s right I refuse to break downI wonÂ´t cry, I wonÂ´t cryHow come I never fall in loveI wonder why, I really wonder whyThe plan I had for my lifeIt seemed so rightI thought I had it all figured outNow I need a place to hideCause I Lied, I Lied to myself, thatÂ´s right Here in my hideout in the shadesI go insane, it feels like IÂ´m going insaneI call upon winds, I call upon rainCause I hate, I hate to loseThough I feel itÂ´s pretty coolI know that time, time heal all woundsI pretend that everythingÂ´s alrightI Lied, I Lied to you all
