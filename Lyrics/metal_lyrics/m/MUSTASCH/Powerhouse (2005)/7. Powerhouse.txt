I could never learn the codesThen youÂ´d have to stand the terror I was toldHere IÂ´m standing in the coldTrying to make myself face my own reality You want a piece of me, go cut yourself a sliceHere IÂ´m standing, running wildIÂ´m a Powerhouse WonÂ´t you please just let me inIÂ´ve been miles away, donÂ´t know where I have beenAnd I wonÂ´t stay for longIÂ´m a drifter and I walk in my reality alone You want a piece of me, go cut yourself a sliceHere IÂ´m standing, running wildIÂ´m a Powerhouse
