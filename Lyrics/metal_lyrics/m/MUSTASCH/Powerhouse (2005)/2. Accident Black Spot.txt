You say you are so cleverYou beleive that you are brightGo get yourself togetherTo the the life that you never hadYouÂ´re satisfied by nothingIt canÂ´t just be that bad YouÂ´d better find a solutionOr it will never stopWhy donÂ´t you find a solutionYouÂ´d better leave that black spot Good guys dwells in heavenBad boys go to hellYou feel youÂ´re on the levelThe moment you are deadWhy donÂ´t you listen to meThis is what I say YouÂ´d better find a solution... This is not a love songItÂ´s a song about fearIf you need a love songYou wonÂ´t find it here YouÂ´d better find a solution...
