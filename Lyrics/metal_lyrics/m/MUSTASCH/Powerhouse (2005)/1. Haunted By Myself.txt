I know I blew it allI closed all doorsI burned my bridgesAnd all I have to solveIÂ´m waiting for the last of minutesCanÂ´t tell the truth at allI break the law to push all limits IÂ´m Haunted By Myself I know I have to goIÂ´d better buy a one way ticketAt last, a wake up callFor once and all I leave Black City IÂ´m Haunted By Myself
