Take care of the good timesAs your days on earth will passYou gotta make them last a lifetimeNot the memories of the past Who do you think will thank youFor what you later will regretHow can you hope to die a happy manWhen you havenÂ´t started living yet Talk about your old dreamsI can hear it breaks your voiceBut it ainÂ´t too late to stand upItÂ´s time to make a simple choice Hang on to the good timesAs your days on earth, they passYou gotta make them last a lifetimeAnd not the memories of the past Lazy days or slaveryForced labour, living freeWhen the sun comes up tomorrowWhat itÂ´s gonna be?
