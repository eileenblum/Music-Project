ItÂ´s been a long way to runDonÂ´t you understandItÂ´s been a long long wayItÂ´s been a long way to run Like a ship in the nightIÂ´m sailing, IÂ´m sailing into the light Into the light IÂ´ve been on the wrong wave for too longIÂ´ve been on the wrong wave for fucking to longIÂ´ve been on the wrong wave for too long Like a ship in the nightIÂ´m sailing, IÂ´m sailing into the light Into the light
