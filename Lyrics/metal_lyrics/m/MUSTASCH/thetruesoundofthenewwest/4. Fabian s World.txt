I donÂ´t think that IÂ´m nervousCanÂ´t you see that IÂ´m coolI just paid my guitarSo letÂ´s play some blues Take a look at my angerTake a walk in my shoesClose the door, turn the keySo we can have a smoke I left my girlfriendThey will never learnI sold your drawingWelcome to my world Take a look in the mirrorTake a look at yourselfWipe that smileWipe it out of your face I beleive that youÂ´re nervousYou betrayed the bluesClose the door, turn the keySo we can have a smoke I left my girlfriendThey will never learnI sold your drawingThis is FabianÂ´s World
