I donÂ´t care if you donÂ´t like meI donÂ´t care if I donÂ´t grooveAll I need is some timingThen IÂ´m on the move IÂ´m gonna cross my oceanIÂ´m gonna explore my seaIÂ´ve been ready for agesWaves of doubt killing me IÂ´ve been holding myself on the lineIÂ´ve been trying to buy me some time IÂ´ve been waitingIÂ´m still waiting And IÂ´m tired of fightingIÂ´m tired of standing aloneStanding alone at the platformTo see the last train go And I explain my excusesUntil the ocean turns redIÂ´ve been ready for agesThe tide was all in my head IÂ´ve been holding myself on the lineIÂ´ve been trying to buy me some time IÂ´ve been waitingIÂ´m still waiting
