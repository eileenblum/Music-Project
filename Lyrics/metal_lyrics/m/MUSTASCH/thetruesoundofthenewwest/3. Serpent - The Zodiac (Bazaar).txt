Raised in painAnd grown in rageLearned to hateYou suffocate Pushed awayYou try to remainFight for spaceYou fall from grace No mourningNo relief Been running all my lifeAnd I always thoughtThat my eyes were open wideNow I realizeI canÂ´t waste my daysIn the search of the right sign Raised in painYou learned to hatePushed awayYou fight for space StillwaterDeep blue sea Been running all my lifeAnd I always thoughtThat my eyes were open wideNow I realizeI canÂ´t waste my daysIn the search of the right sign
