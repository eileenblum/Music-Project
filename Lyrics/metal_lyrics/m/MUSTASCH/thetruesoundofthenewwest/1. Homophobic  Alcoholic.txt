Like a long lost friend from the other side
If you were my mum, then IÂ´d have to cry
And if I had a girl, I wouldnÂ´t run, IÂ´d hide
And if I loved her, IÂ´d cover my pride

ThatÂ´s the price to pay
Just to hold it in your hand
Homophobic/Alcoholic
In a way you wouldnÂ´t understand

Rejection rules when I kiss your lips
IÂ´m in outer space on a deadly trip
Forcing your mind to board my ship
If my conscience hurts, not a fucking bit

ThatÂ´s the price to pay
Just to hold it in your hand
Homophobic/Alcoholic
In a way you couldnÂ´t stand

IÂ´m in outer space on a deadly trip
Fasten your mind, IÂ´m boarding your ship

ThatÂ´s the price you pay
For living in this land
Homophobic/Alcoholic
In a way you couldnÂ´t stand
ThatÂ´s the price to pay
Just to hold it in your hand
