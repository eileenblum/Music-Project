I know this guy I havenÂ´t told about beforeHeÂ´s always pissedYou can find him on the floorHeÂ´s not allright but wants to be respected He saidThis is my life and I am free of waste my timeUp to now the alcohol was the best I found Daybreaker, youÂ´ll make itIf you try And his girlfriend seem to stand the miseryShe should be moving on if you are asking meItÂ´s quite allright, but what he needs Daybreaker, donÂ´t break herDaybreaker, heartbreakerDaybreaker, donÂ´t break herIf you can This is the final stand before I break awayI do believe itÂ´s time for me to go insaneI feel allright, I want to be Daybreaker
