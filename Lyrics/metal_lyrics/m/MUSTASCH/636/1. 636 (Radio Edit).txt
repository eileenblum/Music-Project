IÂ´m piled up high the morning light
A giant silver screen
IÂ´m waiting for my mind to land
IÂ´m living in a dream

IÂ´m a wizard IÂ´ve got magic sticks
IÂ´m drinking liquid gold
The taste of metal in my mouth
Infected all my bones

IÂ´m piled up high, the morning light
A giant silver screen
IÂ´m waiting for my mind to land
IÂ´m living in a dream

I canÂ´t explain why colors fade
And everythingÂ´s a fuzz
I feel like IÂ´m a winterÂ´s day
Another hippie had enough

IÂ´m piled up high the morning light
A giant silver screen
IÂ´m waiting for my mind to land
IÂ´m living in a dream
IÂ´m piled up high the morning light
And everythingÂ´s unreal

IÂ´m piled up high, the morning light
A giant silver screen
IÂ´m waiting for my mind to land
Cause everythingÂ´s unreal
