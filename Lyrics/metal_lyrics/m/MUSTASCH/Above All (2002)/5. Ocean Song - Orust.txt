Let it outItÂ´s just pictures from your dirty mindAnd when you try to close your eyesAll the pictures seems to slideYouÂ´re on your own this time After staring the ceilingI fell asleep, now IÂ´m dreamingAll the restless emotionsDissolved into an ocean And when IÂ´m swimming the waterHorror memories hauntingI tried climbing the mountainsBut I got lost in the canyons I made it in the plainsBut I failed out in the wavesI try to grab a straw of hay You tried crossing my oceanThen you noticed itÂ´s frosenIt doesnÂ´t mean that youÂ´re evilWhen you are tired of people And when they say that they botherYou can wonder, who are theyThey try to puzzle my secretsBut I wonÂ´t give them the pieces I made it in the plainsBut I failed out in the wavesI try to grab a straw of hay
