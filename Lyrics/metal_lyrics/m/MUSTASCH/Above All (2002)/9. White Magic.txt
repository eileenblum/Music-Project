I believe that white is cleanItÂ´s all there in what you dreamAnd what we saw ainÂ´t magic seeds at all Truth is bold and good is goldThe only thing that IÂ´ve been toldAnd what we hold is closer to the fall White Magic Catch the mystery, catch the mythTry to figure out why we stand tall What you see is what you needIs why we bleed thereÂ´s nothing more at all White Magic
