When you see meYouÂ´ve been trying to hideI could eat youAnd it feels just allrightAny cold winter nightYou will all die When my prey is woundedThatÂ´s my only holy momentYou might move in herdsI Hunt Alone When I see youI donÂ´t hate you, I cryWhen youÂ´ve seen meYouÂ´ve been all paralizedIÂ´m the beast that you fearIn the shadows of night When my prey is woundedThatÂ´s my only holy momentYou might move in herdsI Hunt Alone Any cold winter nightYou will all dieIÂ´m the beast that you fearIn the shadows of nightWhen I see youAll I need is to smile When my prey is woundedThatÂ´s my only holy momentYou might move in herdsI Hunt Alone
