Your life has been a wasteNow IÂ´m here to control your faithWhat was stolen, IÂ´ll reclaimAnd you know it, IÂ´ll do it IÂ´ll make you all youÂ´ll have to follow meIÂ´m a charger in the leadFinally my voice is coming throughI know what I do, and I do what I have to do IÂ´m a Teenage Pacifier They were wrong, I was rightSweet birdie flyTo the nest where the others hideLittle mother cry IÂ´ll make you all youÂ´ll have to follow meIÂ´m a charger, IÂ´m the leadFinally my voice is coming throughI know what I do, and I do what I have to do IÂ´m a Teenage Pacifier
