Wicked rules been trying to putting youFrom where youÂ´re sittingYou had it all, but then these voices callWith something missing They donÂ´t seem to understandYouÂ´re not from a foreign landCatch the drift, donÂ´t talk so loudAnd then it maybe fits in I feel I could crawl up Insanity Walls Slowing down, thatÂ´s not the kind I amI like the speedingFences high, so you can move aroundThatÂ´s not my feeling I feel I could crawl up Insanity Walls Listen up, these things just had to stopIÂ´m turning evilThey grind me down, and try to shove me upYou hear me screaming I donÂ´t like the quiet roomI am not some stupid loonWicked rules, has pulled me back for goodAnd here IÂ´m sitting I feel I could crawl up Insanity Walls
