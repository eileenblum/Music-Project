DonÂ´t take me out tonightI feel afraid of lifeYou wonÂ´t be needing meCause IÂ´m so sick and tired I just wanna dieI donÂ´t think that IÂ´m alive ItÂ´s a long way backWhen youÂ´re downItÂ´s a long way backWhen youÂ´re Down In Black Get down, take cover nowIÂ´m gonna bring myself to liveIÂ´ll run, to get it onInto a place IÂ´ve never beenBlue sky and city lightsYeah IÂ´m coming in Used to be so slowI didnÂ´t know where I should go ItÂ´s a long way backWhen youÂ´re downItÂ´s a long way backWhen youÂ´re Down In Black
