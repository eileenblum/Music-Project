How was I supposed to knowWhereÂ´s the catch, donÂ´t mind, just signGet on the stage and do the show You wonÂ´t get a second chanceTurn the limelight onMost certainly the fools will start to dance... ...Into The ArenaWeÂ´re drifting into the arena IÂ´ll have to put this to an endA perfect stranger telling meThat heÂ´s my one and only friend I turn away and try to runExitÂ´s out, and here I standWith nothing else but my two hands Once you have passed the doorNo one escape these wallsSit back, enjoy them fallRelease the dogs... ...Into The ArenaWeÂ´re drifting into the arena
