She said that I am all that she needs
But donÂ´t try live your life through me
Now sheÂ´s down on her knees, begging please

Together, forever
Together, whatever

She said that IÂ´ve got a heart of stone
Hey girl, why donÂ´t you leave me alone
Sometimes I wish I never been born

Together, forever
Together, whatever
