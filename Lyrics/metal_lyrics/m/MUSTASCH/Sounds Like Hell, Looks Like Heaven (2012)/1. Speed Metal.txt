I could die for staying alive
The sky is the limit for me
High life is on my mind
I want to stay in ecstasy
I had a wonderful time
IÂ´m saved, IÂ´ve seen the light

And I feel like I am healed
Baptized in steel
I am going to preach
Speed Metal

ItÂ´s here to stay forever
The metal I inhale
Music, it makes me strong
And I will never ever fail
Going to be what I got to be

And I feel like I am healed
Baptized in steel
I am going to preach
Speed Metal
