Guess who says IÂ´m murder one
ItÂ´s a cold heart mother devilÂ´s son
IÂ´m going to drive this huckster out of town
SatanÂ´s finally falling down
Bitch

S.O.S. IÂ´m in need of love
Or have you lost your transfer to above
DonÂ´t want to see your ugly face no more
Creep before the rich and hate the poor
Dance little devil while you still around
Soon youÂ´ll leave this holy ground

Cold Heart Mother Son
ThatÂ´s what youÂ´ve become

IÂ´ll crush your temples to the ground
I will not leave one stone upon
IÂ´m going to drive them hucksters out of town
SatanÂ´s leaving holy ground
Dance little devil while you still around
Soon youÂ´ll see youÂ´re falling down

Cold Heart Mother Son...

S.O.S. IÂ´m in need of love
Guess who is the devilÂ´s son
Well we donÂ´t need you more, murder one
TransmissionÂ´s lost, your god is gone

Cold Heart Mother Son...
