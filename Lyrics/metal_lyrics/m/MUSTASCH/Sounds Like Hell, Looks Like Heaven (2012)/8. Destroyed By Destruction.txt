Megalomaniacs of the world
Listen to me now
You wonder why you have to bow
Your superior has arrived

Fame and fortune walks with me
Prosperity IÂ´ve gained
Do you want to mess with me
Please pronounce my name

IÂ´m destruction
I destroy
ItÂ´s but a fraction
Of what to come

Talent, joy, humility
Reigns within my state
Do you want to live in fear
Feed me with your hate

IÂ´m destruction...

You people of complacency
Now itÂ´s time to die
Wonder why you have to bow
Your superior has arrived

Slave, IÂ´m your master
Kneel before my hands
Listen to my word thatÂ´s spoken
Obey my laws or youÂ´ll be broken

IÂ´m destruction
I destroy
IÂ´m destruction
You are destroyed
