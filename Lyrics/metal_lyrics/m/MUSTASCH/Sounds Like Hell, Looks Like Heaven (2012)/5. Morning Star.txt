The sun and moon, IÂ´ll take them down for you
A little something for my gratitude
I am holding her right in my arms
IÂ´ve been blinded by the Morning Star

I used to be a self-centered man
All of a sudden thereÂ´s a change of plans
You came into my world and blew my cool
My sleeping beauty canÂ´t stop watching you
And if the thunder wakes you up tonight
I will comfort you and hold your hand

The sun and moon, IÂ´ll take them down for you
A little something for my gratitude
I have been blinded by the Morning Star
Â´Cause IÂ´m holding her right here in my arms

Morning Star

Now listen honey, IÂ´m am serious
Beware of danger, donÂ´t be too curious
I would die if you would hurt yourself
If someone harms you they will burn in hell
I will hold your hand and comfort you
I love you so it feels my heart could blow

The sun and moon, IÂ´ll take them down for you
A little something for my gratitude
I have been blinded by the Morning Star
Â´Cause IÂ´m holding her right here in my arms

Morning Star
