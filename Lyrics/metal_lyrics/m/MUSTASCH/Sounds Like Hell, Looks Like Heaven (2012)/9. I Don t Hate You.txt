IÂ´m on the road alone again
Riding the healing winds of change
I donÂ´t love you anymore
IÂ´m surprised that I can breathe
After nursing all of your needs
I donÂ´t hate you anymore

IÂ´m not your dog
Though I bite the bone
IÂ´m tired of being in love and IÂ´m scared of being alone
You hate my lifestyle
What can I do
There ainÂ´t no treatment, baby, that can heal my screaming ghoul

IÂ´m on the road alone again
Right in the healing winds of change
I donÂ´t love you anymore
IÂ´m surprised that I can breathe
After nursing all of your needs
I donÂ´t love you, but I donÂ´t hate you anymore

You brought me depression
You made me fucking bleed
You turned a normal guy into a raging jealous freak
Well now IÂ´m moving
I leave this town
I hope to be you friend though whatÂ´s been said and done

IÂ´m on the road alone again...

You took my money
And wasted my time
What more do you want
My freaking life
