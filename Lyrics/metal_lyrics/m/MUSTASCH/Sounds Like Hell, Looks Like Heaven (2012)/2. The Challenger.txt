The road is the law that I follow
The ride has been my meals
I donÂ´t care anything about tomorrow
IÂ´m a beggar on four wheels
I know I need some changes
I starve in supersonic speed

So IÂ´m challenging my fate
I refuse to go insane
I just need to have a brake
IÂ´m a challenger today

The road that you choose, you must follow
Feel free, go all the way
Forever is always forever
Promises arenÂ´t made to break
There are no easy answers
There are no shortcuts in your trail

So IÂ´m challenging my fate...

There is no sweet surrender
I wonÂ´t give in to pain
A horse-powered contender
I hate to fail

So IÂ´m challenging my fate...
