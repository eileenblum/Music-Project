If thereÂ´s something you like to share
Well IÂ´m prepared to lend my ears
But what I hear, the same old song and dance
Of what you donÂ´t and what you canÂ´t
IÂ´m fucking done

If youÂ´re going gets narrow baby
IÂ´m prepared to lend a hand
YouÂ´re doing wrong, I told you a million times
But you just put your stupid head in the sand

Calm down, youÂ´re way to loud
You made your mother cry
Sex, drugs and rockÂ´nÂ´roll
Your father he must be so proud

If thereÂ´s something that canÂ´t be told
Well I can try to find the words
It drives me crazy when you shut your ears
And what I said itÂ´s like itÂ´s never been heard

Calm down youÂ´re way to loud
You made your mother cry
Sex, drugs and rockÂ´nÂ´roll
Your father he must be so proud of you
