You lie awake, the mindÂ´s in overdriveThe sheets are made of steelYou feel like you are just about to dieAnd nothingÂ´s gonna healYou are a no one on a one way rideYou just want to scream Nothing seems to have a meaningWhy donÂ´t you try to leave the houseWe were born to live our livesBut you just close your eyes A sunny day is waiting outsideBut you go back to sleepThe phone is ringing you donÂ´t give damnWhy canÂ´t they let you beYou are a no one on a one way rideYou just gotta scream Nothing seems to have a meaningWhy donÂ´t you try to leave the houseNothing seems to have a meaningClose your eyes if you just want to die
