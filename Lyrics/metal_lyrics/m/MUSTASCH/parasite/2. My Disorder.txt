Down, I was walking blindHad no one aroundI tried to reach my life supporter Bad, this is all I haveI need a better brandI try to reach my life supporterNow I know IÂ´m just but mortal Burned by fire, drowned in waterPull yourself through My Disorder NowÂ´s the time to realizeI will never reach the skyIf you want to know whatÂ´s downTurn to me, IÂ´ll be your man Why must I be blindSave my mindI try to reach my life supporter Bad, This is all I haveIÂ´m running out of timeI try to reach my life supporterPull yourself through My Disorder NowÂ´s the time to realize...
