I tried to walk on waterI tried to lead the blindI couldnÂ´t save the mortalsSo they were left behind The cross I bear on my shouldersThe thorns I walk uponMine is to do nothingAnd even this, IÂ´m doing wrong IÂ´m around, pray for lightHere I am, weÂ´re going downAnd darkness riseÂ´Cause I have killed the light Judgement day is callingThe sinners stand in lineAll the angels have fallenBut IÂ´m just doing fine The cross I bear on my shouldersThe thorns I walk uponMine is to do nothingAnd even this, IÂ´m doing wrong IÂ´m around, pray for light...
