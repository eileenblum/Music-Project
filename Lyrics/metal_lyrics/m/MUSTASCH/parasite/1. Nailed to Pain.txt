IÂ´m a loner and IÂ´m living through my deedsAll my life I have been fighting in the streetsI canÂ´t stand if you donÂ´t practice what you preachIÂ´m a nightmare who will haunt you in your sleep I am standing in the rainNo one wants to know my nameIÂ´ve been Nailed To Pain What I have learned is that relations never lastIt kicks off well but usually ends up in a blastThereÂ´s no point in searching errors in the pastYou just move out there and put yourself to grass I am standing in the rainNo one wants to know my nameIÂ´ve been Nailed To Pain IÂ´m the nightmare in your dreamsDonÂ´t you want to know my nameIÂ´ve been Nailed To Pain
