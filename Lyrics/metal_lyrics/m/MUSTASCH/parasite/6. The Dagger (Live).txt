ThereÂ´s no time to check the stars outIÂ´m already on my wayIf youÂ´re up to call me psychoOr if you think IÂ´m out to play I use The Dagger IÂ´m a cold heart motherÂ´s sonThinking IÂ´m the only oneIÂ´m a cold heart motherÂ´s sonTrying to find my way home If youÂ´d like to be the hammerWell that seems to be okayNow you met a real ramblerWho refuse to be the nail I use The Dagger IÂ´m a cold heart motherÂ´s sonTrying to find my way homeIÂ´m a cold heart motherÂ´s sonAnd IÂ´m certainly the only one
