Hey baby, youÂ´re a Parasite
You need my blood to stay alive
AinÂ´t gonna get it, that's just right

Look who's talking, the lord of lies
You are nothing but a Parasite
YouÂ´re gonna get it, that's just right

Get back to mother and cry
You little Parasite

You hate to suffer but you want it all
You want to fly before youÂ´ve learned to crawl
AinÂ´t gonna get it, thatÂ´s just right

Unpleasant flavour as you take a bite
The bitter truth, Parasite!
YouÂ´re gonna get it, thatÂ´s just right

Get back to mother and cry
You little Parasite
