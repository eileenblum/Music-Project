Born a believer, I walk aloneCanÂ´t find a place where I feel at homeWell IÂ´m crazy, but I am saneIÂ´m guilty, but not to blameThis is my nature, who I amIf you donÂ´t like it, here I stand I wanna keep it, though I eat itShove it in my mouthI can't control my evil II wanna keep it, though I eat itHave a bigger biteI love you baby, though I hate youI'm a Double Nature! Now a heretic, I have becomeI've lost my faith in god and manI am a demon, free from sinBut thereÂ´s no angel who lets me inMy wheels are rolling, theyÂ´re rolling fastStraight outta hell, away from my past I wanna keep it, though I eat it... Now hereÂ´s a warning, some final wordsTurn me down, and youÂ´ll burn, burn...I am awaken, I never sleepMy eyes are bleeding, IÂ´m a freakIÂ´m short of patience, donÂ´t mean no harmIÂ´m just a guy with a burning heart I wanna keep it, though I eat it...
