I canÂ´t read, I canÂ´t follow
And I walk in constant sorrow
What I earn is what I borrow
I donÂ´t care for tomorrow

I donÂ´t believe in hunger
DonÂ´t believe in thirst
What I really need to know
Have I been cursed
Here I stand alone
IÂ´m spreading out the worst

Now I walk in the shadow
On my way to the gallows
Didn't steal, I just borrowed
No one reads, no one follows
They donÂ´t need the real me

Now I know whatÂ´s hunger
Now I know whatÂ´s thirst
Now I really know that
I have been cursed
Here I stand alone
IÂ´m spreading out my worst
