All my life I have been told
To bow my head in awe
Now those days are over
I refuse to feel small
Did you really think
This game could end up a draw
Did you really think you had
The arms to win this war

And you sacrificed a lot of time
To keep me to the floor
A renegade left bleeding cold
A stranger in your home
A little species you could breed
And form into your norms
Hey, the little species, now heÂ´s tall
So bow your heads in awe

Here it is, the night has come
The last defense, crumbled down
IÂ´m alone, but I feel strong
IÂ´m taking out the skeletons
