I hate to be in loveI donÂ´t like being fineWhen IÂ´m at worstIs when I really feel aliveAnd I canÂ´t stand to seeYou happy people smileCause IÂ´m a killerI would love to make you cry Bring Me EveryoneI need to hurt someoneIÂ´ll give you love, then I turn you downMy work here, itÂ´s done They say IÂ´m psychoAnd should be put behind barsThat I am damagedAnd my soul is full of scarsYou shiny peopleYou should never come this farCause IÂ´m a killerI got murder in my heart Bring Me Everyone... Ringing bells in the skyIs this the bringer of lightNo, you fools, it is IRun for cover or die
