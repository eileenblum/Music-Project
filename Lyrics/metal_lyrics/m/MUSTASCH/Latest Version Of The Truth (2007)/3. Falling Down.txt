The higher the flightThe harder the Falling Down IÂ´m down to earth but could go higherThough IÂ´m pretty safe here in my treeI really like to try go flyingBut I know IÂ´ll fall like tumbling leaves The higher the flightThe harder the Falling DownThe deeper the diveThe bigger the chance youÂ´ll drown I was raised to choke on my desireSometimes I felt unable just to breathSo I learned to be a fighterNow IÂ´m ready for that giant leap The higher the flight...
