How on earth were you createdEither it is heaven or itÂ´s hellI donÂ´t buy: "ItÂ´s not your fault"ItÂ´s you, and you must do this by yourselfTake control, rise and shineYou have to quit this living like youÂ´re dead You wanna break through heavenYou really need to changeSo donÂ´t say tomorrowForever Begins Today How on earth were you createdPlease donÂ´t treat yourself like human wasteYou better bring it up, sweet ladyBefore youÂ´re totally falling out of place You wanna break through heaven...
