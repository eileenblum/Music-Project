What is it you canÂ´t stand?The way IÂ´m living or that IÂ´m loudYou choose the safest trailBut I donÂ´t want to walk that wayGo care about yourselfI know I donÂ´t deserve your hate IÂ´m not aggressiveI just do what I must do!IÂ´m not aggressiveJust because IÂ´m not like you! You tried to get it outBut you donÂ´t dare to go that wildWell, whoÂ´s the angry now?Spread your wings, try and learn to fly IÂ´m not aggressive...
