HeÂ´s a nasty oneCanÂ´t take youÂ´re number oneHe just hates when you are rightHeÂ´s going to hang me highFilling you up with liesDonÂ´t want to have his kind around CanÂ´t you tell me something newLack of talent, it must be cruel If you cant sing or danceThis is your only chanceTell them all what they should doLook at that ugly faceYou can smell her hateBut girl, try to report the truth CanÂ´t you tell me something newLack of talent, it must be cruelWhat you do and what you say is who you areDonÂ´t try to decieve me Do you believe me nowWe have to put them downTheyÂ´re just wasting our timeLack of confidence, explains the arroganceDonÂ´t wanna have this kind around My review: They gotta go!
