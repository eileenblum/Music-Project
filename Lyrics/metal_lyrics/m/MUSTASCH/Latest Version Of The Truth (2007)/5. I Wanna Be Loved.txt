You canÂ´t break what is brokenAnd donÂ´t try to walk the oceanDig where youÂ´re standingA hole in your heart, why donÂ´t you mend itThe suffocation of your feelingsMakes your life lose meaning I could have met you half waysBut I'm an ego, this is what I craveI Wanna Be LovedI just canÂ´Â´t get enough of it The girl is sitting in her towerThe boy heÂ´s living in anotherHe said: Wanna come uptown?The girl said: Why donÂ´t you get down?What do we learn from this story?Both are winners when theyÂ´re scoring I could have met you half ways... IÂ´ll teach you body languageBaby donÂ´t be shyThe bad girls learned some mannersDonÂ´t you ask me howYour needs is what I hungerItÂ´s too late to cryI want two for tangoNow IÂ´m going down Are you ready to be shakenThis shake can cause you painMy feelings are but nakedMy pride is high at stakeA force of roaring thunderNo girl can stop this loadI know where theirs is headingYou made me explode
