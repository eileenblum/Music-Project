Is this what life is all about?A TV-chef, a homestyled houseThe LCD flat on your wallWill it make you reach the inner core? Is this what weÂ´re supposed to do?Forever being on the moveDoing the only thing we knowOur latest version of the truth WeÂ´re just a bunch of normal guysWho never seemed to learnTo keep our voices downSo here it is, our pride and gloryThe finest piece of art weÂ´ve ever doneI tell you man, it wasnÂ´t easyI never thought weÂ´d bring this sucker home Now itÂ´s time to face the curtainWas it worth the pain?It could always be more perfectBut here it is, our endYouÂ´re welcome to The End
