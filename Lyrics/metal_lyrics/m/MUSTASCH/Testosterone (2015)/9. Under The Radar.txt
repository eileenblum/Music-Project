I feel like fallen like I fell from the sky
No more tomorrow, am I dead or alive
There is no purpose, thereÂ´s no cure to apply
Well I donÂ´t care, this is a good day to die
Used to believe but I have started to slide
I never seemed to learn how to fly
The hardest part is trying to land
I had to crash because my beacons were out

I wonÂ´t get out of bed
IÂ´m gonna stay under the radar
My mode is set to stealth
IÂ´ll remain under the radar

We have a death sentence the day we are born
Gloom and sorrow are the things I adore
The road to your grave is a long way to crawl
This is about it, I canÂ´t take it no more
No more tomorrow, am I dead or alive
Well I donÂ´t care, this is a good day to die

I wonÂ´t get out of bed...

I never learned how to fly
IÂ´m gonna stay under the radar
This is a good day to die
And I remain under the radar
