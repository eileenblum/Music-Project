YouÂ´re my breed, youÂ´re my kin
You are my angels
In the darkest of dreams
IÂ´ll be your candle
I hear your calm breathing
My eyes leave me astray
I thought I heard you screaming
But I keep the darkness at bay

In the darkest of night
I will be your ranger

Dreamers
IÂ´ll give up my dreams for you
Dreamers
How I wish that your dreams will come true
