As a renegade from reality
IÂ´ve turned the truth into lies
I was not ready to testify
So no-one liked to being around
My thoughtÂ´s were wrong
But now itÂ´s under control
I have left all that behind

Right now, on the end of the line
I am breaking up with disaster
I have had it now, I must leave this ride
I got broken down somewhere down the line
Countdown, I must stay alive
I am breaking up with disaster
Somewhere down the line

Bleed and burn and murder
While IÂ´m summoning my wrath
Declining in the shadows
IÂ´m inspecting wounds and scars
The dying days are over
IÂ´m embarking first class car

Right now, on the end of the line...
