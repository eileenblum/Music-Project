IÂ´ve been walking a lifetime prepared to die alone
One step at a time was all that I could do
Now my future is clear and bright
I have met someone that changed my life

Sheer blackness grasps my soul
Just by the thought of losing you
Eternal darkness IÂ´m breaking through
I really hope I have to leave before you

Bail out as the first one has always been my plan
One after another they broke down and cried
I really hope theyÂ´ve found someone to love
But I have something that lasts until I die

Sheer blackness grasps my soul...

I am a black hole, sucking the light
I am the fire that oxygen canÂ´t stand
You are a rainbow, a lightning in the sky
You are the rain extinguish raging fire

Sheer blackness grasps my soul...
