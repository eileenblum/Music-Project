You're a big boy now
You are mean and proud
You have left your past behind
Have you forgotten all
What you promised yourself
When they broke you as a child?

Be like a man [2x]
Be like a man, man, man
I know that you can
Be like a fucking man

When you're big and strong
Don't you get it wrong
You're not weak when you're kind
When your near and dear
Are in need of your arms
Don't behave like you're a child

Be like a man [2x]
Be like a man, man, man
I know that you can
Be like a fucking man

Be like a man [2x]
Be like a man, man, man, man
Be like a fucking man
