During the days
The vision slips away
Cause in the light
I can barely see your face

But in the night
I see your face
Unable to comprehend
And when she smote
Smote your head
How I wish I could be there
And take your blows instead

And in my dreams
IÂ´ll hold you
To scare away the dark
IÂ´ll comfort thee
Them silent screams
IÂ´d help you make them stop
Cause in the night
I see your face
Unable to comprehend
And I will dry
Dry your tears
Female evil
I try to understand
I donÂ´t understand
The dark side of man
