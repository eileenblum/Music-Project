The boar is brawling
The bull moose is roaring
But the wolf he kills them all

You've been warned, do not follow my trail
When you can spot me it is far too late
Lock and load, it is all that I know
You better pray not to be in my aim
In a rage I defended my space
It's been a constant fight for my name

I am the hunter
I have always been stalked
I am the cancer I know
Hear my call
You've been warned

On the run like a lone wolf man
I've been tracking for better days
I am gone, you won't see me again
I'm still searching for my golden age
You've been warned, do not follow my trail
Scent my smell, it's fucking far too late

I am the hunter...
