Ease my pain, take me again
You will die as our two worlds combine
Rise and shine, ride or die
I feel alive and I need it now

SheÂ´s a Messiah, I am a god
Burning desire, leaving me cold
SheÂ´s a Messiah, flaming with youth
Trapped in the fire, my Testosterone

Steel and chrome, ride or die
I implode out of Testosterone
