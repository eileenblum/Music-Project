I have been toxic, I was spinning the wheel
The other tossers they were baffled with me
They said that hatred was the gospel I needed
Now IÂ´m addicted to another feeling
IÂ´m alive and I love it

Wherever I am is my universe
And I donÂ´t care about space time curve
IÂ´ve always felt that I am out of this world
IÂ´m anything but Down To Earth

Being a stryder I have striding enough
Unpack the bags I am leaving the dust
They say that all roads lead to Rome
My hatred left, I am finally at home
IÂ´m in love and I love it

Wherever I am is my universe
And I donÂ´t care about space time curve
IÂ´ve always felt that I am out of this world
IÂ´m anything but down

The rider of the storm returning home
The sibling of sin, a prodigal son
A dealer of doubt who never gave up
Sailing in to the light

Wherever I am is my universe...
