IÂ´m feeding, feeding my ghosts
TheyÂ´re better then ever before
IÂ´m speeding, speeding off course
IÂ´m heading in to the unknown
Borders, borders are crossed
On my journey to know who I am
Memories turned into dust
I have missed my own history class

ItÂ´s a road I must travel alone
With a cargo I cannot unload
I am heading in to the unknown
IÂ´m The Rider

IÂ´m feeding, feeding my hope
I am ready to cast off my load
Meaning, itÂ´s time for a choice
While IÂ´m idling at the crossroads
IÂ´m dealing, I deal with the ghosts
I feel better then ever before
Mountains are crumbling down
As I speed from my past in the dust

ItÂ´s a road I must travel alone...

IÂ´m at ease, IÂ´m at ease at last
I have survived
My own history class
This is me, I am my past
ThereÂ´s no meaning to hide
The future is bright

ItÂ´s a road I must travel alone
But my cargo is under control
I am heading in to the unknown
IÂ´m The Rider
