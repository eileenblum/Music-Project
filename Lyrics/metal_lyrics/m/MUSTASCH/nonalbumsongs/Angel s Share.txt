AinÂ´t no one gonna bring me down
Â´Cause I feel like flying
Here I stand in a rocking band
And I hope you like it

I give you what I got, I hope you care
ItÂ´s the best you wanted
The best you got it here

Yes means yes, but no means no
And I never broke it
I aint the one gonna let you down
My word is spoken

AinÂ´t no one gonna bring me down
Â´Cause I feel like flying
Here I stand with my rocking band
And I hope you like it
