I donÂ´t like your kindDonÂ´t you waste my timeI donÂ´t want to have you around My embassyHas been closed for yearsI canÂ´t feel sympathy Jesus Christ is walking againBut he wonÂ´t stand up for me Cause I Kill You For Nothing If youÂ´re feeling downReally down and outDonÂ´t you take it out on me DonÂ´t you waste my timeI donÂ´t like your kindI donÂ´t want to have you around Jesus Christ is smoking againBut he wonÂ´t pass on to me Cause I Kill You For Nothing
