IÂ´ve always felt rejected
IÂ´ve always strayed the streets on my own
Like a stranger that nobody knows
I lied and made up stories
To hide the fact that I was alone
An outcast from a broken home

Here in my dreams
I know what I want to be

I wanted to be loved, at least admired
If not I want to be feared and hated

We want to be connected
We shiver deep down in our souls
For the void of not being known
IÂ´m tired of dwelling in silence
I donÂ´t believe in unwritten laws
I was meant for a higher cause

Here in my dreams
I know what I want to be

I wanted to be loved, at least admired
If not I want to be feared and hated
