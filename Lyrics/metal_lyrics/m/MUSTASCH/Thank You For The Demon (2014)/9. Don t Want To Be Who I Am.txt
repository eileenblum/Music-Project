I called a friend the other day
His life was easy, fine and quite okay
It made me stunned
Cause itÂ´s usually the other way around

I can hear the sound of cawing crows
I really like it when they sing their blues
IÂ´m used to it now
Well misery is on the house

Yet another lonely quiet dawn
In my melancholic blacked out room
And I wonder will I ever be able to close that door

ItÂ´s about time for me to take a stand
Before heaven comes crashing down
DonÂ´t want to be who I am
I want to be who I imagine I am
