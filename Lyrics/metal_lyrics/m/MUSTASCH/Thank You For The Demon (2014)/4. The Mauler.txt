IÂ´m the mauler, IÂ´m a caller of the wild
Your vain attempts of resistance makes me smile
Submission is your only option now
My name will shine like fire in the sky
IÂ´m the mauler

I am a beast, I am untamed
IÂ´ll never take the chain
Suite yourself, cross the line
This dog do not bark before he bites

IÂ´m the mauler and IÂ´m gonna get you down
I wonÂ´t give up until IÂ´m number one
Submission is your only option now
The title of the universe will be mine
IÂ´m the mauler

I am a beast, I am untamed
IÂ´ll never take the chain
Suite yourself, cross the line
This dog do not bark before he bites

IÂ´m the mauler, IÂ´m a caller of the wild
IÂ´m the mauler and IÂ´m gonna get you down
IÂ´m the mauler
