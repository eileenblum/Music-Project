All my life, IÂ´ve had to cover up what others done
And IÂ´m so tired, it still happens to me all the time
Let it be, they always say a better day will come
How could IÂ´ve been so blind

All my life, IÂ´ve been trying to find out who I really am
And I ainÂ´t done, whatÂ´s clear to you IÂ´ll never understand
How I screamed, how I cried in the dead of night
It was just a dream, one of those nightmares we donÂ´t talk about

How did they dare not to let me speak?
But this bird is soon about to fly free

All my life IÂ´ve had to cover up what others done
But youÂ´re right, my day will COME!

Now IÂ´m mad, I wanna have those things I never had
I can be bad, the consequenses of your actions strikes back
IÂ´m not mean, you just havenÂ´t seen the real me
Let it be, you will get used to it, youÂ´ll see

All my life, IÂ´ve been looking for a place called mine
I have tried, still havenÂ´t found out who I really am
How I lied when I told you I was satisfied
And I lied when I said itÂ´s gonna be alright
I could not find any piece of mind

Now IÂ´m done, IÂ´m fed up being angry all the time
But donÂ´t be calm, IÂ´m on to everyone who clouds my skies
Cause itÂ´s true, break bad patterns, thatÂ´s the way to go
All I know, my loved ones will not face my cruel doom

I can talk about it now
IÂ´m not afraid to fly
Many years has passed me by
Everything will be alright

I can talk about it now
IÂ´m not afraid to fly
Everything will be alright
But IÂ´m not satisfied
