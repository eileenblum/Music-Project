I got my hands on the steel
And satan sitting by my side
I have a gang full of rats
WeÂ´re gonna raise hell tonight

We gonna feast to our death
Drink your blood, split your spine
YouÂ´re looking kind of cute
Wanna have a date with death tonight?

I make my way through the night
And you might disagree with my style
IÂ´m gonna drive until the end of time
Tonight itÂ´s lowlife highlights

Never mind what youÂ´ve been told
Just let it be
Things are looking fine
When chaos is all around

I make my way through the night
And you might disagree with my style
IÂ´m gonna drive until the end of time
Tonight it is lowlife highlights
