IÂ´m a king without a kingdom to rule
The day I was born was the day I was doomed
But the scars that you gave me, they made me look cool
So I thank you for the demo

IÂ´m the intruder who gave you pure hell
An outcast that all of you easily could blame
Your hate and your envy only made my ego swell
Thank you for the demon

IÂ´m a king without a kingdom to rule...

No one listened whenever I spoke
My talent made you existentially provoked
I spent all my life being angry and choked
But I thank you for the demon

IÂ´m a king without a kingdom to rule...

IÂ´m grateful of the pain
The guilt and the shame
Your self-absorbed behaviour
You robbed me from my crown
But pushing me around
Made me who I am

IÂ´m a king without a kingdom to rule
A lifetime in exile in the land of the fools
The scars that you gave me, they made me look cool
Thank you for the demon
