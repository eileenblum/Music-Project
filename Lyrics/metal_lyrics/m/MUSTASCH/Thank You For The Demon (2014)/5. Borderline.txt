Hey you, IÂ´m borderline
If you leave me behind
IÂ´ll cut myself in half

I donÂ´t want to be all by myself

I need some serious help
Unstable sense of self
But confident as hell

I neither want to live or die, thatÂ´s right

Darkness starts to rise
CanÂ´t see no end in sight
IÂ´m borderline

This pitch black soul of mine
Have got no urge to fly
Bring back my amnesia

Leave me be but please donÂ´t by myself

A wink from laugh out loud
My life is breaking down
What the hell is going on?
I neither want to live or die

Darkness starts to rise
CanÂ´t see no end in sight
IÂ´m borderline
