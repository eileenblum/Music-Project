Last nightÂ´s jive
Has made me know
To hate my life!

You can do it right
Or wrong, deliberately
But youÂ´re gonna go down

You can have a blast
And get some out of it
But youÂ´re gonna get it
YouÂ´re gonna get it at last

Can you see that girl?
A high-heeled beauty queen
You wanna follow her home

Now you see the light
Shine on her bedroom floor
YouÂ´re trying to get it
YouÂ´re trying to get through the door

Last nightÂ´s jive
Has made me know
To hate my life!

From euphoria to dystopia
Did you have enough
