I ainÂ´t a boring barfly
So please donÂ´t get me wrong
Come on, yeah come on
IÂ´ve been saying this for far too long
I hate to disappoint you
IÂ´m not the guy you need
So feel free, you can leave
Cause IÂ´ll never swing like a monkey from the trees

ItÂ´s of great importance
This is what you all should do

Bang your head clean off, just do it
Stomp your feet and clap your hands
IÂ´m a heavy metal groover
Bang your head cause I hate to dance

So take me away from the dance floor
Nemo saltat sobrius
Well thatÂ´s right, fucking right
IÂ´ve been telling you for far too long
I hate to disappoint you
But IÂ´m not the guy you need
You can leave, cause to me
Disco died in 1983

ItÂ´s of great importance
This is what you all should do

Bang your head clean off, just do it...
