WeÂ´ve been around for so longThe wheels of time keep turningThe hall of fameOur final destination of this journey Well IÂ´m a man trapped in this bandAnd now IÂ´m tour resistantBelieve me now cause I donÂ´t whineBut I want a careful ride You will remember our nameCause weÂ´ll lead the wayDonÂ´t you think that youÂ´re safeWeÂ´ll come for you again ItÂ´s been a hard dayÂ´s nightTo qualify for pole positionBut as time goes byReality turns into fiction Endless days and lonely nightsThatÂ´s all thatÂ´s left for meIf youÂ´re not buckled up youÂ´reUnsafe at our speed Rain is falling while weÂ´re boardingI donÂ´t know where we are goingRain keeps falling while weÂ´re boardingWe attend a never ending tour
