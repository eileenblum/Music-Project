I believe in my lifeUnder darkened skiesThereÂ´s no more time to be forgiven I just want you to sayItÂ´s OK anywayThereÂ´s a lot of time to be forgiven Call off the dogsWeÂ´re not wantedCall off the dogsThis place is hauntedCall off the dogsThe rats will be kings instead of us I was lost out of sightNow IÂ´m holding the lineI know this phase wonÂ´t last forever I believe in my lifeUnder darkened skiesI hope to leave this stormy weather Calling me a fool wonÂ´t help youYou know that I am rightIt gets me on the feet to seeYouÂ´re wrong and down and out Well IÂ´m alive and I live foreverYou all soon must dieCalling me a fool wonÂ´t help youYou know that I am right
