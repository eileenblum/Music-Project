A worn out manIn bed with a screaming demonThereÂ´s something wrong with his planThis ainÂ´t the life he dreamed of Give him a bottleIt might ease his painSunday evening death wishTomorrow it begins again HeÂ´s a Monday Warrior HeÂ´s a sold out soulAnd his cup been over flowedAinÂ´t no rockÂ´nÂ´rollIn being a day job soldier Frustration and angerThatÂ´s a bitter pillSwallow baby swallowWeÂ´ve got many holes to fill HeÂ´s a Monday Warrior
