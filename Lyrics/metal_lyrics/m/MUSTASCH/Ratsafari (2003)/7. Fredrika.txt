I saw an angelI can tell you I was far from homeThrough stormy weatherIÂ´ve been mislead but I was never goneI saw this angelThe queen of diamonds almost blew my mind awayShe tried to give it all just give it all to me Right out of the blueSheÂ´ll come for you tooRight out of the blueThe angel of truth Never say neverLook out and see whatÂ´s coming around the bendFrom bad to betterWho knows what it will come to in the endNever say neverThe queen of diamonds almost blew my mind awayShe tried to give it all just give it all to me
