IÂ´m piled up high the morning lightA giant silver screenIÂ´m waiting for my mind to landIÂ´m living in a dream IÂ´m a wizard IÂ´ve got magic sticksIÂ´m drinking liquid goldThe taste of metal in my mouthInfected all my bonesThe lightÂ´s so bright but when I close my eyesIt all explodes IÂ´m piled up high, the morning lightA giant silver screenIÂ´m waiting for my mind to landIÂ´m living in a dream I canÂ´t explain why colors fadeAnd everythingÂ´s a fuzzI feel like IÂ´m a winterÂ´s dayAnother hippie had enough IÂ´m piled up high the morning lightA giant silver screenIÂ´m waiting for my mind to landIÂ´m living in a dreamIÂ´m piled up high the morning lightAnd everythingÂ´s unreal The wizard lost his magic sticksThe world turned into stoneThe taste of metal in his mouthAnd everything explodes IÂ´m piled up high, the morning lightA giant silver screenIÂ´m waiting for my mind to landCause everythingÂ´s unreal
