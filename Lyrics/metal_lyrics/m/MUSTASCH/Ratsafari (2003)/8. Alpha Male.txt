I am number oneI lead this pack I wonÂ´t back downI push myself through snow and rainAnd if you challenge me IÂ´ll give you hell And all my enemiesThe fear and hate destroying themThey try to hunt me downBut they will never ever ever find the den IÂ´m just playing mother natureÂ´s gameYou surrender IÂ´m an Alpha MaleIÂ´m gonna get you babe Now your time has comeI bring the beast out of everyoneThe only way to save the dayGet down roll over and play dead Nothing changesIt stays the sameYou surrender IÂ´m an Alpha MaleIÂ´m just playing mother natureÂ´s gameIÂ´m gonna get you babe
