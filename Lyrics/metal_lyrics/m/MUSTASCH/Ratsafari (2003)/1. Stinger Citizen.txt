YouÂ´ve been holding down so longYou canÂ´t stand upYouÂ´ve become a lieAnd now you canÂ´t get up The one and onlyWeÂ´re gonna get you rollingStinger Citizen youÂ´re on a dead end rideCome on outDonÂ´t you back on down Do you wanna get up Stinger Citizen the fear of falling outStinger Citizen youÂ´re soon to see the lightThe one and onlyWeÂ´re gonna get you rollingDonÂ´t you back on down DonÂ´t you wanna get up
