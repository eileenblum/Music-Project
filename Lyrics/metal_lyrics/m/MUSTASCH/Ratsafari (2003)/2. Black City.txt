IÂ´m accused of being coldWith no emotions at allWell IÂ´m having a ballIÂ´ve got my motor running IÂ´m jumping with joySearch and destroyCome on come on come onIÂ´ve got my motor running Nowhere you can hideYou wonÂ´t leave this place aliveCause the sun ainÂ´t gonna riseThe sun will never shineIn Black City IÂ´ve got smog in my brainAnd gasoline in the veinsGet out of my wayIÂ´ve got my motor running Accused of being coldWell IÂ´m having a ballSearch and destroyIÂ´ve got my motor running I use you as I pleaseThe price you pay for walking my streetsCause the sun ainÂ´t gonna riseThe sun will never shineIn Black City
