IÂ´m sitting by the phoneLike so many times beforeIÂ´m waiting for a callBut I donÂ´t know what itÂ´s for A pale blue light the moonFrom outside it fills my roomAs I sit here in this gloomAnd I rise to face my doom I donÂ´t get any answers hereWhat can I say Could you cover me pleaseCanÂ´t you see how I feelI just need some loveBut IÂ´m on my own IÂ´m walking in the snowIt is Christmas and IÂ´m aloneI donÂ´t know where IÂ´m goingBut IÂ´m bound to get there soon And my destiny lies nearSo near but still unclearIn all my greatest fearsItÂ´s present now and here I am holding the answers hereI know whatÂ´s right Got to hang up the phoneI was born on my ownI just got to be strongI donÂ´t need your loveIÂ´m on my own
