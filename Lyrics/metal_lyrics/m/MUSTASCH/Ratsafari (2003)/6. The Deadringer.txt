Born to life abandoned by the godsHelpless try to hide while darkness fallsMy quest has been to rise above them allSo my anger and my pride has been my sword When youÂ´re telling me IÂ´m not the first aroundThatÂ´s just not realCause in my own universe the history begins with meI am not like someone elseI am The Deadringer of myself A flickering light is chasing night awayA deathmass for an alliance of betrayalThe coldest and most selfish of them allSo even though youÂ´re gods you have to fall
