These fields of blood where cries and pain
destroy my soul, this taste of death
This touch of fears nowhere to go
This smell of war, this sight of hate
Tyrant power, fragile justice
Certain glory, people suffocated
Certain glory, people suffocated
These fields of blood where cries and pain
destroy my soul, this taste of death

They are coming, masqueraded
They are commanding, they are imposing
They have their law, they have their truth
They bleed to death, fucking country

War in hell, tyrant power
War in hell, fragile justice
War in hell, tyrant power
War in hell, fragile justice

They are coming, masqueraded
They are commanding, they are imposing
They have their law, they have their truth
They bleed to death, fucking country

War they kill them on the ground
In front of their own sons, blood
War in hell, tyrant power
War in hell, fragile justice
War in hell, tyrant power
War in hell, fragile justice
