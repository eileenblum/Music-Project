Illusions of peace promised
while they make fortunes of lies and peace.
Their power, their richness.
Full pockets, government for a few.
To be born, to be crying
suffer, watch them die.
Cry for peace, I get mad
I get blind, no more pain.
Echoes of bullets sound
deep marks now leave their scars.
In my flesh mind and soul.
People scarified
their bodies exploding.
Cries and pain
they hunt, they kill, they die.
Clean my eyes from the pain
while the flesh confronts this fate with rage.
Tears that fall on the ground
getting wet, getting red.
Dead bodies are covered
by the ground that got red.
Illusions of peace promised
while they make fortunes of lies and peace.
Their power, richness

Bullets, evil bullets
Bullets, Satan bullets
Bulltes, evil bullets

War grows every day,
men kill their brothers.
Fear, they run, they flee
Hell before my eyes

Fear, disappear
Bullets, reappear
Hunger becomes real
Heaven burnt in this hell

[Guitar solo]

Those who kept silent
Those who tell lies
Those who survived
Those who have died!!!

Illusions of peace promised

I get blind, no more pain
Echoes of bullets sound
deep marks now leave their scars.

Bullets, evil bullets
Bullets, Satan bullets
Bulltes, evil bullets
Bullets, fucking bullets
