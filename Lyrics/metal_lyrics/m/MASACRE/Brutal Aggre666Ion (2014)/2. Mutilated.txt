Did not you how many children
exploded with your bullets.
Countless orphans and mutilated men
with your stupid policy.
Revolution how many of us
have been massacred
by your laws, Colombia kneels.
We are the people trapped in the middle
of this war, Colombia kneels.
We are the ones that pay and suffer for peace.
We are to live false laws, laws
suffer for peace, massacre, laws
government liars, democracy, laws.

We long to live in harmony
while supporting this glorious war.
We are the people adding to the death toll.

Mutilated men die by your laws.
Mutilated men die by your fucking laws.
Times of war, glorious death

Times of war, glorious death
Death... Death

[Guitar solo]

Mutilated men die by your laws.
Mutilated men die by your fucking laws.
Did not you how many children
exploded with your bullets.
Countless orphans and mutilated men
with your stupid policy.
Revolution how many of us
have been massacred
by your laws, Colombia kneels.
We are the people trapped in the middle
of this war, Colombia kneels.
We are the ones that pay and suffer for peace.
We are to live false laws, laws
suffer for peace, massacre, laws.
