Satanic peace
Merchants of peace
Death solitude
Hidden in the dark
Where muted voice deafens
And cries cover with blood
Muted faces, mutilated at war
Young men for this conflict
Satanic peace agreement
Plan for falsehood
Victims, cirme
Genocide, death
Insane country deceived
False laws, impunity
Blood of violent victims, defeated
Bitter gulp of coffee
Tastes like cocaine
Peace of mafias mocks at my back
Defeating our people
Death sums up in the deeps of earth
Sowing bullets for its harvest of war

Rivers go on flooding while
Wind strikes desert countries
With the whistle of fear
Pale faces of men 
seem to be trapped
in hell of being alive
In the middle of death.
