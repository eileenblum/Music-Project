Nothing in our fields
Rubbish in the cities
Poverty, misery
Religions and politics
Fuck you mafias
Fuck you morality
Fuck you hypocrisy
This fucking truth
People suffer the worst tragedy
Poverty in extreme conditions

Frustated and miserable government
Absurd laws of lies
Screams of latin pain
Of corrupted reality
Tragedy of cries and impunity
Fields devoured by fear
Bullets have shut up people
This country dances upon death
New silence the echoes

Reality death, reality death
Reality death, death

Tired without tears
Desperated void of three coloured
Wraps up flesh till dismemberment
This is a perverse truth

[Guitar solo]

This is a perverse truth
A painful reality
State of drugs and death
Of bullets, cries and blood
Dead bodies, more dead bodies
Shots in the air
People disappeared, impunity, die
All in the list, massacres, die, die

Nothing in our fields
Rubbish in the cities
Poverty, misery
Religions and politics
Fuck you mafias
Fuck you morality
Fuck you hypocrisy
This fucking truth
People suffer the worst tragedy
Poverty in extreme conditions

[Guitar solo]

Reality death, reality death
Reality death, death
