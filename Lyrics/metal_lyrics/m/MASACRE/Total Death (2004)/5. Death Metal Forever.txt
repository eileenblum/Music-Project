[Lyrics: Alex - Music: Jorge]

Death!!!
Disfiguring all the merits
Resuscitating the dead ones
Everything is razed after their steps
So dark, so gloomy, itâs just pathetic
I will carry on all of my fears
All over my back thereâs more and more pain
Just because of this absurd violence
Bullets entering into the bodies
Metal burns up inside my head
A strong mourning feel, lots of bitterness
Crying out, despair, my anguish is rising
Death!!!
Death Metal Forever
Thereâs a strong desire, to go on with my dreams
Iâll forget my cries, my misery
Thereâs a strong desire, to go on with my dreams
Iâll forget my cries, my misery
War means hunger, death, abduction
Victims, fear, trenches, madness
Sadness, horror, peace decaying
These are the symbols of this fucking nation
Death Metal Forever
This is my whole life, this is my slogan
This is my own flag
Only loyalty, only admiration
Long life to death metal

[Guitar Solo]

This is my whole life, this is my slogan
This is my own flag
Only loyalty, only admiration
Long life to death metal
Metal!!!
