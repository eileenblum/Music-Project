[Lyrics: Jorge - Music: Jorge]

They wonât forgive you
Armoured warriors
Not feeling mercy
Days and nights-long
Prosecuting, judging
Persecuting, killing
Run, hide,
Fight now
Here comes
The Soldiers of the Unknown
Their preys are chosen
Thereâs no turning back
They came to town
Brought a list of names
One by one
Will be called to account
Silent cries
Tied hands
Soldiers of the Unknown
Feel the bullet
Feel the bullet
Die in pain
Die!!!
Feel the bullet
Feel the bullet
Die in pain
Cry!!!
Feel the bullet
Feel the bullet
Die in pain
Pain!!!
Silent cries
Tied hands
Soldiers of the Unknown
Rep. I, II, III, IV &amp; V
Theyâve made a fine job
Corpses on the ground
Orphans and widows
Mourn their beloved ones
Vengeance in the air
Hate is growing up

[Guitar Solo]
