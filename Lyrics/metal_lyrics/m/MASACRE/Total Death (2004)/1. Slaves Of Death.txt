[Lyrics: Alex - Music: Jorge]

Wake up because left and right
Conquer, submit, take revenge
Forever we will be chained
Under the sign of violence
Youâll kill or you will be killed
You are a prey of this war
Drugs, poverty, left and right
Destroy, annihilate, devastate
Forever!!!
Blood by blood Iâll take revenge
Our harvesting fields are destroyed
They were displaced from their towns
Itâs a cry for the unprotected ones
Whole generations
Fighting for true peace
Which was stolen from my own hands
And made nests of violence
We still are slaves of death
Abduction, impunity
This violence, massacres, thorns
Nailed my soul and nailed my head

[Guitar Solo]

Slaves of Death, links of crime
Slaves of Death, links of pain
Slaves of Death, links of fear
Slaves of Death, links of blood
Wake up because left and right
Conquer, submit, take revenge
Forever we will be chained
Under the sign of violence
Youâll kill or you will be killed
You are a prey of this war
Drugs, poverty, left and right
Destroy, annihilate, devastate
Forever!!!
Whole generations
Fighting for true peace
Which was stolen from my own hands
And made nests of violence
