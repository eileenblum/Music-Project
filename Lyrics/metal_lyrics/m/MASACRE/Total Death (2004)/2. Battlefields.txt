[Lyrics: Alex - Music: Jorge]

My own sadness
I saw the way how they died
In their beds full of anguish
Your hands are tied
Violent men have killed
People before
My eyes, no more!!!
Next to me rivers of blood
Flooding fields of this country
I mourn for this
Reality, crude rage
These are wounds in
My soul, no more!!!
Used up the nationâs resources
These ones raping the others
Thousand bullets buzzing by
Massacred in battlefields
Weâre picking up from the ground
Human bones, ashes, bodies
Battlefields, Battlefields
Battlefields, Battlefields
Used up the nationâs resources
These ones raping the others
Thousand bullets buzzing by
Massacred in battlefields
Weâre picking up from the ground
Human bones, ashes, bodies

[Guitar Solo]

Used up the nationâs resources
These ones raping the others
Thousand bullets buzzing by
Massacred in battlefields
Weâre picking up from the ground
Human bones, ashes, bodies
With my heart and brain
Next to explode
Iâve reached my own sadness
My despair and my fear
With my arms tied up to build,
Tired and defeated
In blood and sweat Iâm bathed,
Dejected and neglected
Used up the nationâs resources
These ones raping the others
Thousand bullets buzzing by
Massacred in battlefields
Weâre picking up from the ground
Human bones, ashes, bodies
I saw the way how they died
In their beds full of anguish
Your hands are tied
Violent men have killed
People before
My eyes, no more!!!
Battlefields, Battlefields
Battlefields, Battlefields
