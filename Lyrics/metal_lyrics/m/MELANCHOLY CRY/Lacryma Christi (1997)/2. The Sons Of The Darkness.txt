Presence Of The Sons Of The Darkness
Is Perceptible In The Air
Blasphemous Silver Circle
Appears On The Black Sky
That's The Darkness That Opens It's Abyss
One Of The Seven Of The Sons Of The Darkness
With Beastial Name Of Mist
Caries The Baby Showing It's Innocence
Terrifying Cry Fills The Night
Unholy Light Subsides
Raised Dagger Cuts Cold Air
Stabs The Body
The Dark Sets In Again
And Darkness Breaks In
Every Innocent Lane
Dead Calm Sets In...
