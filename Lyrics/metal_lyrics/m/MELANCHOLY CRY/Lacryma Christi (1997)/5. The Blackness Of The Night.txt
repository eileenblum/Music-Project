You Try To Lift
Your Heavy Eyelids Up
To See The Flames Of Delight
But The Stream Of Tears
Inundates Your Glazy Eyes
And You Can Only See
The Cold Blackness
The Wave Of Ice - Cold Nostalgy
Overflows From Your Fawn Mounth
Wrapped With Fine Cubweb
It's Sower Of Evil Wich Snaked
Into Your Heart
Sadness Shades Your Face
Night Falled in Filled With
Sadness And Fright
Moon's Axe Feeling The Blackness
Of The Night Scatters Splinters Of Despair
Only Death
Can Explain You Everything
When It Spins Your Eyelids
Around With The Song Of Calm
In The Chasuble Of Mists
Under The Chasuble Of Mists
Under The Great Hoof Of Sky
You Melt Away
Shining With Your Triumph
Moon's Axe Feeling The Blackness
Of The Night Scatters Splinters Of Despair
