I Can See The Gloom...
The Incerse Fills Cold Night
Stretching Darkness Shows Lurid
Gates Of Dark Future
Moonlight Flows On Marble
Stained With Holy Blood
Suddenly Strong Cold Wind Blew
The Sky Covered With Raven Clouds
Cold Wind Of Hate
Converts Into Ice Cold Storm Of Hate
Lacryma Christi
It's The Next Tear Of Suffering
Which Flows Down The Christ's Cheek
Giving Him Insuppratable Pain
The Incerse Fills Cold Night
