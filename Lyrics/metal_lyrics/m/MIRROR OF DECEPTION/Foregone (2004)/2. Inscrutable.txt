Ratios thoughts ordaining your cubicle
The secured wrapped path dwindles
Veering mazed in a ring
My confidant undertow - whereto?

Welcome my sanctimonious friend
Plunge in ineffable truthfulness
Unknowing but foolish
Feed the sea with your dreams

Omnipotent amplitudes coupled with hope
Lower, sharpened with yearning
A blackened warped picture
Gobbling your boastfulness

Timeless depths conjuring fameless
Fly my prideful jester
Unreal glances, nail of distress of your entity
Embedded in an unenslaved range
