Autumn taking in
But I know that's not the cause
Halting reclusion drags me down

This life hesitates to be enjoyed
Not the slightest prospect of change
Vicious circle 
That I'd thought to have escaped
A lasting state of worry prolongs

Another mirthless year goes by
Another hopeless day
In another mirthless life

Regarding life's blithenesses
Like unattainable jewels in the display
Full of yearning
Yet aware they can't be mine

Grievously sensible 
That sudden griping feel
All activates irrelevant
An existence most fatally reduced

Conversant becomes that state of mind
Forming my personality
The longly missed pass of being spared
Falls into oblivion
