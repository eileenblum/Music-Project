It seems to have irrupted over night 
Convulsing worlds in its consequence 
Yet dainty and smooth in its motion 
Veritable only in a glimpse

Barely perceptible movements from the centre 
Point out the changeability of the instances 
Monuments constructed for ages 
Incrementally staggering

Former reliability becomes unreckonable 
Abstracted mere from the steady course of time 
Wearing the countenance of unease as a mask 
What was once familiar sheds its face

A perpetual motion machine of alteration 
The fostering gale can no longer be denied 
Long ago has belittlement lost its sense 
Still grief and paralysis canalize the force 
Impelled squarely by sobered lucidity 
We humbly walk a foregone way
