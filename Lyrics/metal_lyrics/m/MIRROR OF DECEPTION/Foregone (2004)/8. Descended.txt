Entangled in a plexus of fundamental lies
I simply can't imagine any other way 
This play must be screened off
Before they smell the bogus 
Driven by desperation 
Only an attempt to escape 

Abysmally desponded  
The shame is even stronger
Than the menacing fear
Of what awaits beyond
All affairs completed
Left you one last gasp 
Helplessly raising your arms 
You will watch me sliding

Down
Into my secret silence
Down
Into my silent void

Agonizing remorse follows my redemption
Terminating my ailment has destroyed much more
Don't ever try to fathom
Don't search for causes
Don't you try to join me
Don't escort me going

Down
Into my secret silence
Down
Into my silent void
