In moments of madness                                            
Staring at translucent monuments                              
Indwelling this place for aeons                                
With their eternalness appearing intangible                

The icy black waves enclosing ourselves            
Be breasted by lead heavy hearts                  
Vigor and force in flesh by sunlight                 
Shall do good in conquering trepidation                 

Still the brazen mist makes morals occult             
Abortive try to disperse the septum of haze            
Chilling clearance heisting hope                              
Nothing to be found abaft the stars                         

Obscure guises mocking men                       
Idiosyncratic perceptional torment                 
Yet a new crack of dawn draws near
