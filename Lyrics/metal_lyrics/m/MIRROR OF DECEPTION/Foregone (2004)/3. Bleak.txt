As the light fades
And hope evades
When darkness descends
And all joy ends

When dreams turn to dust
When life seems unjust
All colours turn to grey
And illusions melt away

When trust is betrayed
And frustration ambuscades
When friends turn to foes 
And the walls echo your woes

When dark clouds cover the sun
And the last shelter is gone
When you`re naked, facing the storm
And all you get is fleer and scorn

When forebodements haunt your dreams
And your deepest fears are redeemed
You creep back into your cave
Hide yourself and hope to feel safe

When nightmares turn real
And pain is all that you feel
On a permanent escape
But there`s none and that`s your fate
