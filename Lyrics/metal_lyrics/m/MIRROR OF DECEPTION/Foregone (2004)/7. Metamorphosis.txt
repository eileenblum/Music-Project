Icicles, heavy and fragile                             
Are witnesses of trickled felicitousness
Weigh floods on your mind
- Restless eyes, crying soundless

Dried up herbage, coated with glory
Of distressing transformation 
Drill clefts into transitoriness				
- Seething tears of your reality

Opressed hankering for redemption
Straitjacket of your soul
Solidifying floes to the fire				
- Raving in uncontrolled stagnation

Misty adumbrations laughing wise
Penned up in the infinite cosmos
Strange birds of prey circulate idly			
- Mystifying messengers of consolation

Hide in your cocoon
No occasion to crave
No one reaches you
