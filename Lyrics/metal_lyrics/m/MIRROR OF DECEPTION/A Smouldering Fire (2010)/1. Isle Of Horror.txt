Our ship ran aground on this strange foreign shore
We barely had water, and food anymore
Four went to hunt, only two to return
Telling weird tales that made our nerves burn:

Out in the woods, each two took one course
And then blood-curdling screams and battle-noise rose
Nothing was left of those adamantine men
Their guns were all bent and the cutlasses torn

They found no more traces than foul-smelling slime
What creatures would leave - that sort of grime?
We soon were to learn, when at night darkness fell
They came over the cliffs - abhorrent creatures from hell!

Not human, not kraken, but somehow inbetween
With lust for our flesh, and quite battle-keen
The fight went forever and losses were high
Only three of us left, the end being nigh

Now we made our retreat on the top of the cliff
Besieged by those beasts and by our fate miffed!
The last straw seems writing this notice to YOU
But when the bottle is found I guess our end was long due
