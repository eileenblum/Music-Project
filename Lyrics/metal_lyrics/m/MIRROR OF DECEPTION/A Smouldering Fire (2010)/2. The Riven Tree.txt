Far up north there grows a tree
It's splendour plain for you to see
Behold, the branches carry
Earth, universe and all -
Greed is eating at its roots
Breeding the impending fall
The eagle high up in the crown
In combat with the snake of earth
The tree forebodes its death, we frown -
Firewood, for ruin's hearth
The end is near, the tree will fall
Betrayed by every man and beast

And meanwhile in a golden hall
Hypocrites, liars thrive and feast

But at last the all-cleansing war-fire rages
Devouring man and gods alike

Ignorants finally getting their wages
Heads of the earth ending pierced on a spike

Blood and poison, fire and ice
Cleaning the slate can be oh so nice!
