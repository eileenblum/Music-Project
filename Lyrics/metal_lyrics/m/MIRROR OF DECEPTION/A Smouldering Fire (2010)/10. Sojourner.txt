When the day breaks I'll be gone
At dusk a mere memory
You will wonder
What lead me away

But I will return
Every once in a while
When you travel within
And remember
The precious times
That we shared

The traces are now all washed away
And blown by the wind
The picture on your wall faded
And the empty chair collects dust

Sometimes you'll search the horizon
Scan faces in a crowd
For a familiar figure, a gesture
Or a voice so well known
But then you'll realize
That I was just a sojourner

Everything must come to an end
And now I am away
But I will return
Every once in a while
And put a smile on your face
