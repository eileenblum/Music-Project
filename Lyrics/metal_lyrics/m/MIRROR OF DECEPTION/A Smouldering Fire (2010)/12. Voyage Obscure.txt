Went for a walk
In a cloudy night
Under a waning moon
Followed a path unknown

As I wandered erratically
Across open plains into the woods
Without an idea
Where it would lead me to

When I left my home
Driven by an urge
I couldn't explain

When the first day broke
I reached a lake
Its dark, brooding water streaked by the wind

First beams of sunlight
Shone through the trees
And thawed the nightly cold

Out of my bones
As I journeyed on
And left the woods behind
The scenery changed slowly

Until a vast plain spread out before me
A dusty, barren veld

Sparsely covered
In scrawny low scrub

Everything silent apart from a whistling wind

On the top of a mountain
I watched another day rise
How I got there
How long it took me
I didn't know
Up on the plateau I overlooked
The inscrutable desert below
Was this my destination?
Was this my fate from the beginning?
