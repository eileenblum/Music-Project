Ridden with a strange disease
A reminder of the mists
Which covered mountains
Wastelands and seas alike
And descended like
An untearable shroud

The fevered dreams it bred
The pain and woes it summoned
Dread, hysteria, madness
Were unlike anything
Known to man
Were unlike anything
The world has ever seen

Yet no one died
From that mysterious disease
Even though many were longing
For the final shiver
And the very last breath
To put an end to this
Overarching obscurity

But like a smouldering fire
The scourge sprawled out
Conquered the lands
Possessed man everywhere
Countless helpless attempts were made
Still no cure could be found

All of a sudden and without warning
The plague came to an end
Vanished as it had appeared
But in their minds
It still lingers on...
