I dream you're in trouble
So I lay down my gun
Feeding on memories of those I loved
Sending a portion of spirit and food
To you, through the bright burning fire

Knowing that we soon will share
A silent smoke, makes life seem less dire

You're walking through the clouds
There's no need for a shroud
Your hardship I'm trying to soothe
I'm sending relief
Not to feel all this grief
By night, through the bright burning fire

The answer is here
Bird-call tells me, my dear
That you got all I had sent to you
And when my time has come

To know I'll soon be gone
I'll lay down my gun
And watch the flames of the fire

I'll be walking through the clouds
There's no need for a shroud
We'll meet again under those trees
I'll still have my gun
Sending deer on the run
By night, in this forest-clad mire
