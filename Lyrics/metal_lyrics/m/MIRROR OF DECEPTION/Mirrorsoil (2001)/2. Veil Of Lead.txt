[M. Siffermann]

Don't try to remember
But longings are stronger
The tangled ghosts
Taking shape in my mind

A veil lower over me
I try to slide through
Threaten to suffocate
Still I am strong

Sweet spittle fulfill your mouth
Flew down the throat
Became liquid lead
Frozen in your soul
It took a fragment
And left a gaped wound behind

Distant memories
Hurting in my mind
I look for a course
To your poisoned soul

A veil lowers over me
I try to slide through
Threaten to suffocate
Weakness spreads in me
