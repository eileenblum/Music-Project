[M. Siffermann]

Probably lost, all alone, I stand beside me
Hearing bizarre voices, echoing in my brain
Impaled eyes staring from above
I creep away in my silent cry

Anger, rage burst out of my fragile soul
Eager for an answer which relieve my mind
Caught in this dreams of misery
A neverending whirlpool of suffering

Feelings and emotions without control
Surround me in an impervious swarm
No escape from this scary nightmare
I propel to my aimless destiny

Bleeding orchids growing from my ceiling
Immaterial clowns dancing on my grave
Caught in this dreams of misery
A neverending whirlpool of suffering
