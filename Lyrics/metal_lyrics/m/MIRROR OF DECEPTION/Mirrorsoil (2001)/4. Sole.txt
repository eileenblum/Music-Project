[J. Fopp]

The sole disciple
Of a forgotten faith
Buries the last survivor
In a fading soil

Bleeding black, I'm bleeding black
Wounded
A hope is falling apart
Beneath the sacred surface

Cracks in the eggshell
Called life
Still feasting on this solemn moment
Descending... to a narrow place

Fevered dreams
Inside this immortal asylum
Eternal yearning
And petrified emotions
