[J. Fopp]

In my melancholic asylum
I embrace the things to come
Betray the world with my solitude

Despair is my middle name
I'm the one who's to blame
Wear disguises of sorrow

Hide beneath the clouded sky
Dry the tears in my eye
Await the shroud
Of relief

Silence thy lullabies
Look behind the disguise
Envision
A pity entity
