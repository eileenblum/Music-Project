[M. Siffermann]

What I hoped for
Disbaned in haze
Looking out for a sign in maze
A leap in the dark

What I believed
What I believed
Illusions in time

A beam of light
Which was in sight
Determined in mourning

What I hoped for
Disbaned in haze
Looking out for a sign in maze
A leap in the dark

What I sought
In my mind
A wall in my head

I swim
In a sea
Of uncertainty

What I hoped for
Disbaned in haze
Looking out for a sign in maze
A leap in the dark

My eyes
My tired eyes
Frozen in the sky

I see
A way again
A neverending circle

What I hoped for
Disbaned in haze
Looking out for a sign in maze
A leap in the dark
