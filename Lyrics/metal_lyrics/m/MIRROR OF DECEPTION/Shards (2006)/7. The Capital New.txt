The approved has reached it's retirement age
Over are the days of the old
A fresh esprit takes over the ears
Not leaving any space for backwardness

And with all the rotten apples
The whole great crop will be disposed
All that thus becomes forlorn
We'll be repayed by the Capital New

But then you look askance at the scene
As wonted processes no longer suffice
I wouldn't bet a dime on all
That used to be dependable before

Now don't believe your works still sell
Don't believe you are needed here
With The Mighty New taking over
There's not many here with a reason to cheer

But despite the grand earthquake of change
Some ancient heritage maintains
Still grinded are the faces of the poor
And the pauper keep on dying
And the rulers keep on lying

And the coscientious keep on trying
Pretending unpertubed
That ignorance will be punished toughly
Without mercy in the end

And unbridged liberty without common sense
Will lead the world
Into perdition
