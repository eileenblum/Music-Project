Life is nothing but a cathartic journey
A mere assemblage of sins and well done deeds
Enjoying the Cleansing of purity
Out of your body, out of your mind, treason
The bittersweet essence of life, catalysed life
To a vision of sorrow

Multifarious forms are taken by pleasure and delight
The fire of lust and greed burns inside
Blue flames
Eating body and soul

The pyre of self-inquisition starts to burn
Instruments of torture inside the head
Enchaining the guilty self to the wheel
But sin is tempting, and moral is lost
Pour Champagne over the burning flesh
Decadence rules supreme!
