Infinity is an illusion
Nothing is bound to last forever
A world can turn upside down
In the blink of an eye

Fragile is all safe ground
All denial is futile
The soil beneath our feet starts to tremble
When it's least expected

Certitude is meaningless
Endurance is a bliss
Fate is tempted constantly
Without being aware

Life is a game of chance
Each existence destiny
Doom is lurking underneath
The death of all things a fact

Countless lifes have come and gone
Perishability and birth
And endless cycle or just an episode
Permanently on the edge

Who will bring those shards back to light
Who will reconstruct those fragments
Will anyone ever interpret their meaning
After all will anyone care?
