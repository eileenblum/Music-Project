Welcome to a new world
Full of dread and grief unseen
No rules, no exceptions, vile is everything you know, now
No god abroad, just the merciless master
Leading us onward to a bitter destiny

No one shall be in his way
For his will is stronger than all
Forceful men have paid the price for rebelling
Against his intent, and now the sea
has become their tomb

Goodness is not for here
Grace never a thing to expect
All life must be in tooth and claw
Abiding the end at any time is the only way to survive
And yet, it is not your decision
To live or to die
