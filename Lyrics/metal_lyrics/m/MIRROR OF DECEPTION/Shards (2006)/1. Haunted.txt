When the night came
He shivered
And went astray
On the run
From unnamed horrors
His mind
Starts to tremble

Haunted
By entities unknown
The unspeakable
Dread
Haunted
Facing his fears
The unexplainable
Has risen

Driven
Into insanity
His world
Falls apart
No escape
No place to hide
Extradited
And lost
