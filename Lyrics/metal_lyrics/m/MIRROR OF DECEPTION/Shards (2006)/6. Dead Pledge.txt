My destiny in another one's hand
I could be shattered in the blink of an eye
Paralized and powerless
In an iron grip
Depending on the hypocritical mercy
Of an unbidden judge
Snipping of knowledge of a misconduct

Lead into this trap with no escape
I am fighting an uphill battle
Just to be run over and washed away
By waves of hostility
In the eye of the storm I prepare the funeral
Of a life now past

Shattered in the open coffin lie the bleached bones
Of a long lost hope
So no more need
for confessing my sins now
Much too late for all regrets
A raging maelstrom is pulling me down
As I accept the inevitable...
