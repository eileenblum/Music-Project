Noises
All these noises in the air will make me sick
Silence
I need silence over here and I need it quick
Roaring
All this roaring everywhere driving me insane
Island
I need a quiet island somewhere to relax my brain

Your handclap a thundering peal
Your placid voice has the coldness of steel
Your tender whisper just like a buzz in my ears
Your friendly laughter a front of tears

Touches
All these touches on me causing only pain
Trying
to force on me what I'll never be able to gain
Movements
All these movements of bodies I just can't sustain
Impressions
Too many physical impressions overcharging my brain

Your handshake clamps me like a vice
Your tender stokes that I despise
Your helping hand burning like fire
Your presence strangling me like a wire

Distorted perception
Deranged is everything that I feel
Distorted emotion
So don't lament
Please don't lament over me

And don't cry over me
For I can't stand your pity anymore
