Staring at the shards of life
With no one around
A leaden silence, no answers
No response, no remorse
For the grand failure and all that took part
In the futile crusade of cretins

When life fades, shadows rise above all things mortal
And relentless winds scatter the ashes we leave
Love is just a distant memory, left long ago
leaving battered feelings
Turning life bitter

Hope dies anyhow, as love never rained from the sky
And then things get cold
So, take the outraging sheep to the shambles
to melt the as yet
Frozen Fortune with their blood, for they shall serve
Serve in setting free
the strength live the life of a king
