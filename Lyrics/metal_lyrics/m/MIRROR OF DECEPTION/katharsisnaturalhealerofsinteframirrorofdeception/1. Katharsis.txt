[performed by Mirror of Deception]Before the paralyzed parasite was cleansed
The bones of the enemies were stacked while
The omniscient goddess hid in the closet
The alkaloidal aftertaste bred an apparition
Subsequent perceptions deceived
Yet anticyclical patterns in the abattis revealed
The attachability of the absolute convergence

Vague, miasmal oceanography
Barely veiled by the aliquant confidant
Shulking through the ashes
Of a crashed monolith
Billowed eyes beheld barren carapaces
An infinite parade of blank faces
Wandered by and vanished

A sudden stream of fervor
Ascended from oblivion
Defervescence
Vanquished indifference
