Fading traces
Vanish in ablation
A flickering glimpse
Hallmarks alienation

Sudden apparitions 
Play tricks on the inner eye
The scent of perception
A delusion to defy

Mystified reminiscence 
Retrospections arcane
A pondering silence
In a dwelling orphaned

A shuffling soul  
Trudging through anemic days
Evanescence of the common ground
Squires catatonic forays

The haunting incertitude  
Indicates the dread
You could just be away for a while
But you could as well be dead
