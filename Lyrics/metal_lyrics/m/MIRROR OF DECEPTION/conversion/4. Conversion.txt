Loss and recollection escort a quietus.
Conclusion of an era implies not terminus.
Altering the state, shape and prospect.
Reappearing symptoms assuring reconnect.

Decampment and continuation.
Margin for aberation.
Breaking unknown ground. 
Embodies conversion.

An apple of discord.
Tossed into the void. 
Indefinite echoes.
Die away in nothingness.

Scattered entities. 
Gather in the mist.
Convergent paths.
Encounter in the dark
