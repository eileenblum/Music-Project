A cold wind breathes
Ancient mighty castle
I stood here on this mountaintop
My tears mixed with sorrow

The black waters shine
Descending thoughts of grief
The eagle rules the land
Hear the cry of the valley

The angel's eyes
Dark end of the rainbow
The grail to the truth
Infinite dreams

My longing is endless
Landscape... majesty
My last trail it has begun
Oh sunset this final time

The everflow ends
My only domain
Enthralled by this silence
Emptiness reigns

The angel's eyes
Dark end of the rainbow
The grail to the truth
Infinite dreams

These are my dreams of infinity

Last hour of life
Sonnets of nature
This step I'm prepared
Transcendence begins

Acquiescence with death
Afterlife is near
A dream in a dream
In these endless dimensions
