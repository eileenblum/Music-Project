Oh hades I have been longing...

In ancient times there rose a kingdom
Splendid grand mysterious
I travelled on the left hand path
To see the uprise
And the fall...

Dark clouds rise above the kingdom

Last taste of life... bitter scent of times long forgotten
As I saw the sun... disappointed beyond the horizon
I knew from the bottom of my heart... it would be the last time
This stonewall of thoughts crumbled down
Still I looked up into the sky... beyond the stars
Beyond the universe...

For is it infinite for is it real
Shall my flesh be licked by eternity
Or will thy autumn of thoughts lead me
Into this winter of nothingness

At dawn I dead... through life
The tunnel embraces me... I fall
My name carved in stone... epitaph of souls
Flowers on my grave... certainty

I felt my black heart for there was no return
River Styx lead me to the truth
Summon the ancient gods destroy the feeble mind
I was reborn
