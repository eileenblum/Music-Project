I gase into the sky
My lips thrist evermore
Secrets undiscovered
Will I reach Valhall

Far beyond the universe
In this unknown land
Seek the truth eternally
Drift through cosmic sands

Centuries of sorrow
Thoughts as cold as ice
Flaming red this vast horizon
As I capture god's demise

Far beyond the universe
In this unknown land
Seek the truth eternally
Drift through cosmic sands

For There Are No Borders But The Ones You Create

Cosmos thy beginning
Beauty of this final dawn
Dreams of oceans crystal clear
Crown's everlasting thorn
