Longing for my desires reaching unknown borders
End of this final cycle

My throne of wisdom... the only one
Travel on this alley of stars... I joined the hall of souls

Shadows of passing dreams at last my wisdom arose
Out of the ashes of time

My throne of wisdom... the only one
Travel on this alley of stars... I joined the hall of souls

Knowledge will be mine
I reached the throne of wisdom
My eternal landscape
Let me burn in hell

The end of infinity the lake of thoughts
Will drown forever
