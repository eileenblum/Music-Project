[Chapter I of the Mephistopheles Saga]

See me disappear I fly away
This trail of tears... path of fears
The journey hath begun

My friend walk with me this road of myths
The spring of time... the spring of time

As we reach the end of time... my heart will bleed... please let me die
Peace... at last I reached infinity... nature's circle... journey of the mind

Tragedy of death
Roses turning black
Midnight mist is near
Silence I hear

Dusk possesses me
Threshold's freezing fear
Withering of flesh
Wilted flowers left
