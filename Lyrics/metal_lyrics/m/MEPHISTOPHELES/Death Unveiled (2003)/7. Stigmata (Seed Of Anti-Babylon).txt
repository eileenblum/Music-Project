Those dreams Thou hidest before my sleep 
In darkness dwells their potency 
Until unleashed in ecstasy of monumental pride 
So purely focused within my heart 
I promise we will never part, my darkness 
Let the blind ones kill the light 
And even death shall not survive 

Alas, I await these final days 
When all false grace shall be washed away 

Thus, torn apart am I between the worlds that I once knew 
Unequal are the boundaries of mental strength 
Through which my will surrenders to instinct 
Unleashed is hatred, the seed of existence 
Possessed by alliance's words they shall die 

Und was mir bleibt sind nur die Traenen 
Worin die Finsternis noch brennt 
Unvergessen diese Seele 
Die nun die Welt vom Feuer trennt 
Vergib mir die Unendlichkeit 
Es tut mir leid, es tut mir leid 

Combining silence with primal fear 
I hunger for lost innocence 
Pray for an end but no-one hears 
The echoes in a sheltered mind 
Sheltered from the path of Thine 

Our hearts remain as one to forever be undone 
I will intoxicate the sun 
Burning colder since they're gone 
In an endless maze of remembrance 
...breeding grace... vengeance... 
(As I adore the lack of existence)
