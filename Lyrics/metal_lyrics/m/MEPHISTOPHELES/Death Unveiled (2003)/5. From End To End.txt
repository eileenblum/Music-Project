Helpless bound to Earth am I and though 
My will drowns in eternity 
Unable to divert her heart from this divine intensity 
Of what shall grow inside our souls 
Doubt hath led me here 
To conquer all her hidden dreams 
The source of which she fears 

Defender of eternity 
Blood tells our history 

Seed of Anti-Babylon an unborn angel's sin 
Far beyond the truth she speaks 
Thy words, and yet, therein I found 
The bleeding wound which Thou hast once called home 

That which grows inside must die 
Interstellar Nemesis I praise Thy counterfeit 
Disgrace... 
Whence came these dreams I learned to hate 

A static war while I have changed 
Whence Thou hast come Thou shalt be sent 
To bow before our dark romance 
And die before my eyes 
Yet, sheltered by death-bringing hands 
Kneelst Thou down in confidence 
Breaking through my ignorance 
For Thou shalt be the shadow 
As I am the light!
