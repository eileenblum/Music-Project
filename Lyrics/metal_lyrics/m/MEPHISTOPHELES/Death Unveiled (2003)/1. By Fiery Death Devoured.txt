Killing all that's left in me 
Thus, close my heart from unity 
To never lose control again 
And never hide from what I am 
Awake, my anger and haunt this earth 

Broken she stands and broken I am 
Wishing to feel the pain again 
Creating dimensions by Thy hands 
Dark angels come to me... 

Never dare to speak to me again 
Yet, my will is drowned in anger 
Parting the fire from our earth 
Enforcing my desire with the gift of death's rebirth 

Dark angels come to me 
The truth is mine to speak since all hope has died 
Consuming life that crawls the Earth for a last time 

Hide before the light 
Running back in time 
Reign until the end 
Thou shalt be crowned with blood on Thy hands 

Echoes in my soul have died 
Long before the dawn of time 

What I have seen lies beyond all imagination 
I never thought this could be the end 
All through my mind, through my soul 
Through my burning hatred 
Gelaeutert von der Essenz der Zeit
