"Predestin'd is the path of Thine 
Though in blindness Thou shalt wander 
As long Thou on the Earth dost live 
Death shall follow Thee but never 
Caress Thy spirit with his kiss" 

Truth spake to me

My soul doth in anger listen 
And thus, the bolts ye fail to stir 
Beyond Thy words I am imprisoned 
To lose my hate is my only fear 

Time hath not yet come for us to meet again 

As with the night my soul darkens 
Like every night before 
Angels dance in ecstacy by fiery death devoured 
To see the Earth through eyes divine 
Through eyes like mine 

I shall die 
As long as Thy words disguise her tears 
Consume my pain 
No morning shall greet the final day 

Supreme am I due to the loss of doubt 
Yes, I am a sinner 
But thus my flame is burning strong
