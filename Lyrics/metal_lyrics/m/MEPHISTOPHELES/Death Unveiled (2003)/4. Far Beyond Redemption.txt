Solemn art Thy gifts of passion 
Since Thou hast welcome'd me before 
On that primal day Thou hast created 
Hadst Thou not dared to ease them all 

"Thus, fathom her I will 
Of Earth claimeth she her splendour 
As trinity dwells she 
Her spell to cast in rival anger 
Thy sinful race she doth thus kill" 

This is Thy sin, Thy crime, alas 
Though in my heart the dark doth last 
A servant yet I am 
Bound to linearity poison their future entity I will 

"Thou hast compelled me to receive Thy will 
But hear 
Disgust I feel for Thee 
Open lies Thy secret and her will I lead 
Betrayer of the origin 
Dost Thou now fear Thy hateful seed?"
