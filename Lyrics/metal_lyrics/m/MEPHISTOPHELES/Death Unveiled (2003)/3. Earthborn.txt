Thou touchedst my soul as I lay wounded 
Thus, my will Thou didst not fear 
Thy mortal eyes beheld my secret 
My tears I'll dedicate to her 

As destiny must be fulfilled 
By mortal hands we shall be killed 

So much hate to give 
Since I became the enemy 
I promised once to not forgive 

My tears are now of dignity 
That pours throughout conspiracy 
Art Thou the one I once called me? 

She took my name and kept it 
Inside her sacred poisenous heart 
Vergeltung allein ist mein Vermaechtnis 
Damit die Welt uns nie vergisst 

This promise I give shall 
By the truth of death be sworn 
Eternity shall be my witness 
Lay all Thy all darkness into my arms 

The essence of soulstream 
Far beyond redemption 
The truth which in Thy heart doth lie 
Hath led us to extinction 

Death is the path of creation 
Denied to be granted to Thee
