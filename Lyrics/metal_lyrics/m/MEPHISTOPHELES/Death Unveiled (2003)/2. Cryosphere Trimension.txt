Delivered to powers beneath understanding 
Fear is the only way to descend 
Her body forced to suffer from terror 
The source of which I surely am 

Desecrating holiness 
Inspiring my will to die 
Divert my spirit from its primal source 
Leave nothing but believe behind 

I'll burn the truth into her eyes 
Make her feel the end of life 

Unveil Thyself 
Thou, who by my words art sentenced 
I am not like Thee 
I breathe Thy spirit, demigod 
The dust of centuries I wear 
Wouldst Thou, oh Earth, let me die again? 

From end to end I haunt the Earth 

I tend to measure time in aeons 
As eternity is passing by before their eyes 

Quelled hast Thou the source of darkness 
Thus shalt hatred lead Thy life 
Into the dephts of earthly pride 
Whence all false grace derives
