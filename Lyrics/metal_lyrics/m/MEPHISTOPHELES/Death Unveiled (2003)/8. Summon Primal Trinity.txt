And through the night I rise 
Sheltered by my open eyes 
Burn the sacred past that lives within my soulless heart 
Branded is her path 
To hide our secret behind the mask she wears with untold pride 
Sentenced by the blinded mass, evolution is on her side 

Unborn Thou art! 
Unable to receive the gift I offered Thee 
Thus, I'll cleanse this earth from superior existence 
Evoked be my anger with every resistance 
Against the storm of fire I ride 

Never break my will 
For every breath I take 
Is a step back to primal hate 

And thus, my friend, I know Thy fate 
What I receive is the cause of hate 
Thy limit is eternity 
Thy will becomes reality 
Thy loss of life shall be my birth 
Amidst the creatures of this earth 

Although angels fear my sin 
I'll never go where Thou hast been 
To grant my ancient eyes a view upon the truth 
Which keeps the past alive 
Wie soll ich vergeben wenn ich nicht vergessen kann 
I'll never die 
I'll hide our secret behind the mask I wear with all my pride 
Sentenced by the blinded mass 
Evolution is on my side
