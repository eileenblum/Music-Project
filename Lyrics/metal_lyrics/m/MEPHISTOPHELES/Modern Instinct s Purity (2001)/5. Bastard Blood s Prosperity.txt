Forgive my immortality
As this shalt be my destiny
Lead Foundations enemy into the stars
Paranoid entity, Thou art of me

Static spheres illuminate the tyrant tear's last diversion
Lay to rest the second breed
Will I control, will I succeed?

From destiny to infinity
The one that walked alone through bastard blood's prosperity
Among the stars I've grown with hatred burning in my heart
I would not follow Thy sinful path
Leading to the end of time
Bury me beyond divine

Challenger of blasphemy
Behold the loss of eternity

Entering a million years:
Static spheres illuminate the tyrant tear's last diversion
Lay to rest the second breed
Will I control, will I succeed?

Synnoetic universe
The more they dwell the more I kill

Existence no longer linear
Controversial alliance in the time of Vega's guide
Thy future lies therein
Nothing is the way it seems
Where life exists Thou canst not be

Twisting through dimensions
Creation of tyrant yet to come
All I feel is hatred and pain
Collapse to cause the beginning of time
Eldest until the end
Out of the chaos Thou shalt rise
To conquer and praise the system's grace
