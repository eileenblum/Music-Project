Eternally be the words I speak
Heard throughout the universe
To tear apart Foundation's peace
That spreads towards an ancient Earth

Angel tears are frozen
As the Earth has spoken
"Turn Gaia to Galaxia
An empire beneath the sun
Cast me from my throne of fire
All entities combined as one"

A million years of consciousness
I've thrown into the stars
The loneliness of which I hide
Behind the walls of emptiness
A monument of divine pride
Built upon the darkest path

Forever to surrender
Since we cannot die
Without the hatred that I seed
The Earth shalt not be mine

Angel tears are frozen
As the Earth has spoken
"Turn Gaia to Galaxia
An empire beneath the sun
Cast me from my throne of fire"

Keep their world as dark as mine
God's sin is my guilt
Ignorance keeps me strong as I
Cleanse the Earth from grace

I proclaim mortality
Now sentence me
