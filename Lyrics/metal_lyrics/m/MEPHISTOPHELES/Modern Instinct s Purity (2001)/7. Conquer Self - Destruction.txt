Ancient soul, in blood Thou dwellest
My newborn heart is purest hatred
I rise from the ashes, for Thou art mine
And grant Thee immortality to suffer through eternity
Oh, how I wish to lick Thy lips
To steal Thy speech, to poison Thy mind
The master of ignorance, thus
Hath crowned a different kind

"Hass ist eine Leidenschaft, und die Erfuellung ist der Krieg
Der um seiner Selbst Willen ewig waehrt
Ohne Hoffnung auf den Sieg"

Pale conscious spake of redemption
Remind me not to trust again
The lower minds of earthborn creatures
Gifted with Thy punishment

Thou shalt obey, for what they pray
Is the truth that even angels fear
To weak to speak against my word
Confront me now as I wait for rebirth
Into a modern day whence tyrants passed away
Forever to drown in their million tears
As love and hate collide leaving purpose sacrificed
Our blood in darkness dwells

I hide my shade behind the darkness
Whence all the scorn hath come
To banish emotions as she offers her body
Preaching intolerance for we are of one
The burden of sorrow has taken my powers
For seconds that I won't forget as
Eternity is torn asunder by the grace that I shalt not possess

Thine is the past I'm drowning in
Yet, the promise is forever
