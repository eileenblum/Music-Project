Burn the Earth as I burn the stars
That open my mind to a darker path
Summon the eternal darkness wherein tyrants dwell
May they be the ones to cast death's spell
On their cosmic journey through an endless mind
Embalmed in utter chaos I steal their pride

"I'd offer my soul for the silence
Behind which Thou hidest thy crimes
The loss of Thy faithful alliance hath struck me blind
Until the end of time"

Elder breed, who came from darkness
Quest for dimensions is in vain
The tyrant's tear a toxic carcass
Long lost through Foundation's reign

Focussing the synergy through the centre of Thy heart
Thus, those forces caressing Thee
Shalt never recombine the elder darkness
With the essence of Thy soul
As death embraces Thee

Nevermore to recreate all that they have erased
Solar extinction as our worlds collide
In modern instinct's purity led by psycho history
