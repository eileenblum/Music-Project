Growing from eternity
I kneel before the truth she rapes
Burning all the memories

My darkened soul denies to hate
I tried to forget whilst thou betrayed
Regretting nothing but enforced faith

Listening to silence as she never spoke to me
Emptiness, the final truth again
Banish my integrity
Everlasting darkness fills the nothingness inside
Never tried to understand, Keeping death inside thy hand

Hope has died through all Thy glory
And far beneath my sinful mind
Another death invades my body
Standing strong to leave behind
This fatal grace
Since all I learned shalt be Thy fate

Thou who art the murderer of Thy own creation
