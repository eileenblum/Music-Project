I am legion
Crimson eyes of thousands
Death kiss the undead's glory
Await the new beginning
They pledge to their swords
Darkday is near
Nature's grand powers
Mankind's soul disappears

Flames of fire kiss the night
Stormclouds like black tears
Flames of fire kiss the night
Guarding spiteful angels
Flying in the Carpathian nightsky

I am legion
Crimson eyes of thousands
Death kiss the undead's glory
I am legion
Crimson eyes of thousands
Await the new beginning

Flames of fire kiss the night
Stormclouds like black tears
Flames of fire kiss the night
Guarding spiteful angels
Flying in the Carpathian nightsky

All mortal ones shall be lost
Waves of blood at the horizon
Join the force and shun the cross...
