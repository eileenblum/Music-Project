As darkness falls over the lands
My time has come to crush humanity's daughters and sons
War and hate peace will never be
Total damnation not one's soul will be free

Grains of sand filled with blood
On these shores of despair
My march will continue
The star's final glare

My endless strive for domination
Armaggeddon's leading son
Fulfillment of this greater vision
There shall be only one

The last day has ended
Heaven will mourn
I stand high on this hill
Adam's race died at dawn

Darkforce be my guide
Towards the eternal reign
Last battle on earth
This night there shall be only one

My endless strive for domination
Armaggeddon's leading son
Fulfillment of this greater vision
There shall be only one

Behold The Kurgan
Master Of Fog
Behold The Kurgan
Master Of War
