Call my council hall of might
Towers of darkest dimensions
Build it up by magic Pandemonium
Tempt mankind forever

Chaos direct me through the gates of hell
Created free they will soon fall
Go to the rim of the universe
Passing the limbo of vanity
Wait to reach the nighttime stars
An army of immortality

Satan Godmaster
Lucifer One Shining Star

I Fall I Rise
Return of the highest in spiteful disguise
I Fall I Rise
An unending path to be seen in his eyes

Seducing god's creation
Serpent's lonely voice
Invert the lie betray them
Leave the garden forever...

Chaos direct me through the gates of hell
Created free they will soon fall
Go to the rim of the universe
Passing the limbo of vanity
Wait to reach the nighttime stars
One army of immortality
