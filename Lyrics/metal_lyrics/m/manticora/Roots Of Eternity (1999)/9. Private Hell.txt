Standing up - I'm looking down
at the ground below
Can't change my situation
by execution

How can it be my life it means so much to me?
I'm doomed anyway - my friend can't you see?

There's no god to save me
From this private hell
No angel of mercy
Comes to my cell

How can it be my life it means so much to me?
I'm doomed anyway - my friend can't you see?

Standing up - I'm looking down
at the ground below
Can't change my situation
by execution

How can it be my life it means so much to me?
I'm doomed anyway - my friend can't you see?
