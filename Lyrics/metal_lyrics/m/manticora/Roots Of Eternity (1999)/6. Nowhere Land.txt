(The timegate is opened...)

I'll desecrate your weak beliefs
You must feel so old
Went out to see another world
And found that it had turned so cold

Stranded in unknown sourroundings
In a place where time has no meaning
Cant seem to find my way out of here
Trapped in a nowhere land
Open my thoughts to the masses
The manticore is my illusion
Cant seem to open the door out of here
Trapped ina a nowhere land

Absent but absolutely there
Consciousness expanding
I know the meaning of it all
That's what im thinking

Stranded in unknown sourroundings
In a place where time has no meaning
Cant seem to find my way out of here
Trapped in a nowhere land
Open my thoughts to the masses
The manticore is my illusion
Cant seem to open the door out of here
Trapped ina a nowhere land

And so we fought...
