I eager for knowledge
And the power to travel beyond
It's the soul within i'm after
to journey with you is my bond

Towards Algol - The demonstar
We fly above valleys so deep
In the shining mists of Orion's sword
We'll meet beyond the walls of sleep

More than two thousand years from now
Evil empire Tsan-Chan will appear
And what you call ancient egypt
Is where i'll dwell next year

Towards Algol - The demonstar
We fly above valleys so deep
In the shining mists of Orion's sword
We'll meet beyond the walls of sleep
