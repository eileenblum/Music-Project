Today the sky is gray
gray as the thoughts in my head
And i have been down for so long
always endless trails i tread
I've climbed the highest mountains
But I still can't reach the top
Looking at a wasteland
That just never seems to stop

Come walk with me the world to see
And look for understanding
Come walk with me blue sky to see
And hope to be set free

Then like from out of nowhere
a vision comes to me
Picturing the king of eagles
coming from the sea
He talks to me in tongues
That i have never known before
but i notice that i understand
as if it were my own

Come fly with me out to the sea
I'll show you understanding
Come fly with me the end to see
And i will set you free

So now im flying to the sea
To see the world with diffirent eyes
I've found a place to call my own
Where i can learn that i have been set free
