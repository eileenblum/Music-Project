Now that everything is lost my colours they are slowly fading
I cast no shadow but another level is waiting
Journey through the black abyss is only in my fevered mind
Even time and space have gone - impossible to find

From far beyond the nothingness - the end
A twilight voice is calling me back again

Waiting at the bottom of the sea in giant twisted cities
The story of mankind is soon to be unwritten
Boundaries of dim expansion growing to a roaring river
I'm screaming silent - I'm raving mad with fever

From far beyond the nothingness - the end
A twilight voice is calling me back again

I stare into the darkness
trying to believe my eyes
Through eons dwelling formless
Now it's time for you to rise

Come rest thy tired soul until forever ends
Rest until you know the future again on you depends
Then go and free your mind - make up another paradise
And the humans will be waiting...

When forever ends i'll be thy servant, i'll be there for you
your rotten smell is sweet - delight in mystery
I will gaze into your eyes with black amazement in my head
The Great Old Ones will now consume our hopes

From far beyond the nothingness - the end
A twilight voice is calling me back again

I stare into the darkness
trying to believe my eyes
Through eons dwelling formless
Now it's time for you to rise
