One hour ago - a step back in time
The season drew the pupils in my eyes
When the water turned to blood
It turned my guilt into the lies

Gold is the metal of purity
My body has turned in for good
Every crawling corner in my mind
Changing the things i understood

How can it be - That you're blinded again
You can hear them dying within
the souls under your skin
Crunple in a sea of sin

Gold is the metal of purity
My body has turned in for good
Every crawling corner in my mind
Changing the things i understood

So well - so bright
Im flying away - i cannot stay
dawn breaks free
and pale faces are turning the night

Gold is the metal of purity
My body has turned in for good
Every crawling corner in my mind
Changing the things i understood

So well - so bright
Im flying away - i cannot stay
dawn breaks free
and pale faces are turning the night
