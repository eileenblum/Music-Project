Another soul departed today
A grieving fact that I have grown used to
Ashes to ashes and dust to what?
A ticket to oblivion when your dear ones follow you

Sickness drained the lake inside me
That I used to shed my tears
Sorrow and sadness in abundance
Left a desert through so many years

Gone forever, all but a memory
A grain of sand in a brief moment in time
The rain is pouring down, saddening me
As I listen to the sound of the church bell chime

Sickness drained the lake inside me
That I used to shed my tears
Sorrow and sadness in abundance
Left a desert through so many years

What is life but a flash of a switch in the light of eternity

Another soul departed today
Accompanied by the choir's song
Another soul departed today
It took a little part of me along

Sickness drained the lake inside me
That I used to shed my tears
Sorrow and sadness in abundance
Left a desert through so many years
