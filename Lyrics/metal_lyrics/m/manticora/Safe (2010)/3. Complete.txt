But there was always something missing out there
There was always something I couldn't put my finger on
The driving force behind me wanting to be number one
Whatever it was, it is now gone

I have come to the ultimate understanding
That this one also has to pass away one day

You are the one to succeed me
You're the one who carry on my reason to be
But you also brought me the apathy to think it was all to no avail

I have finally become complete
You have made me complete
I could die happy, knowing
That I became complete

A veil of destruction crosses my path
And degeneration plants in me a growing seed
It is however but a fleck of dust to me
As you have made me
Helped me
Saved me!

My grand illusion of immortality
Was my youth that now fades away

I gave you life
I fueled the spark that created you
And marked the spot in the horizon, the end to my own tale

I have finally become complete
You have made me complete
I could die happy, knowing
That I became complete
