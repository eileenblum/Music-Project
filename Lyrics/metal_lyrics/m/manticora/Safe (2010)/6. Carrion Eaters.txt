Through the portrait you paint, you become the creator, you can destroy at will
The claustrophobic sensation increases
My freedom of speech has been sentenced to death
Before we know it, the sword comes out of its sheath

By the sculpture you mould, you become the creator, you can destroy at will
Level of stupidity increases the more, you choose
Your deity to decide for you
You actively seek discomfort and call for me to feel it too

Find and Destroy them all
For they have no right to live
Find and Destroy them all
For they have the nerve to think
Find and Destroy them all
For theirs are live to spill
Find and Destroy them all
You have his blessing to kill

Keep on believing and you shall receive
You will be filled by his power
But what is there left to believe, believe in nothing
When belief has turned sour

Through the fire you fuel, I become the destroyer, I choose to destroy!
I'm feeling cold, I have grown numb
There's nothing left inside this hollow shell
You killed the freedom and no one lives to tell

Find and Destroy them all
For they have no right to live
Find and Destroy them all
For they have the nerve to think
Find and Destroy them all
For theirs are live to spill
Find and Destroy them all
You have his blessing to kill
