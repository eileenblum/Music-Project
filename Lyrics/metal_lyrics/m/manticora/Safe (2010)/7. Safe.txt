[Searching]

So the search went on to find where the essence of things lay
Always on the prowl to discover the light of day
Somebody once told me that all good comes to he who waits
Hard to believe when the lung of life deflates

The only thing worse than losing you mind and being
Is to know about the fact that it is happening
So why do we keep on fighting when Death's cold embrace
Brings us nothing but nothingness... Still we carry on...

And my search always ends in Death!

[A Miracle]

Then came the day when it was time
To greet you with a "Welcome to the world"
I saw a miracle unveil before my eyes
The birth of a little baby girl

A picture says more than a thousand words
So here I am - look at me
Try to fathom the love you see in my stare
My blood, my love, my life

I'll fight for my miracle
I'll conquer for my miracle
I'll endure for my miracle
I'll die for you - my miracle

and I'd kill the whole world if I knew it'd made you smile
Down to the last of human kind
They've got supremacy in numbers
But I have an image of you in my mind...

So I look at my miracle and fill with pain
That I ever have to separate from you again
I think of my miracle and tears fill my eyes
As all my frustration fades and dies

I'll fight for my miracle
I'll conquer for my miracle
I'll endure for my miracle
I'll die for you - my miracle

[Fading]

I feel my days are growing shorter
And with that, a battle has begun
To live and breathe every moment with you
To stay with you under the sun

I planted a seed - the image of me
And now that you're here
I wonder about my own mortality

Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder
So I am not objective, that's true
But you are the sweetest thing to gaze upon
And I bleed inside when I look at you

I planted a seed - the image of me
And now that you're here
I ponder my own immortality

[End(less)]

Now that nature can dispose of me
I ask myself, how can you go on
The answer lies in you
You made me SAFE
My life, my love, my blood...
