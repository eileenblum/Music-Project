Tired of pulling knifes out of my back
They say you reap what you sow
But where along the road did I do wrong
I guess I really just don't know

A boy, made man by lines - trenches that deepen day by day

In the dreamland between sleep and reality
On the verge of tears I hate
I have seen the truth
In the eyes of and angel of light
From the bottom of my aching heart

I'm sick of cleaning up after all your quarrels
They say you learn from your mistakes
So now I have to find where I go wrong, where I go wrong
I guess that's really all it takes

In the dreamland between sleep and reality
On the verge of tears I hate
I have seen the truth
In the eyes of and angel of light
From the bottom of my aching heart
