I never thought it'd come to this
The day when freedom was raped and torn
Burned into a cinder
And cast away for us all to mourn

...and if I disconnect sometimes
Just leave me be
If I should disconnect
Just plug me in and see

Freedom - Freedom - Freedom - Freedom!

You keep on giving in to demands
A paradoxical right they have abused
The parasite is slowly eating his host
When freedom dies, you stand accused

...and if I disconnect somehow
Don't you contemplate
If I should disconnect
Just plug me in and wait

Freedom - Freedom - Freedom - Freedom!

Condemn the atrocities committed in the name of the one
Not a trace of remorse to be found
Even if we know that man made god
Not the other way around

...and if I disconnect again
It's just that I'm sick of it all
So if you plug me in
I'll make you beg and crawl

Freedom - Freedom - Freedom - Freedom!
