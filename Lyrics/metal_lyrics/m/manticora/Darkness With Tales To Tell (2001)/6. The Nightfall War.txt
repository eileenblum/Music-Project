[Saga Of The Exiles Part 4]

The timegate reopens...

Subsuming the minds of the traitors made me crazy
Insomnia's their way of paying back
My powers are lost, I'm calling the Grand Master
Hidin'in her shelter at Black Crag

The longlasting winter, the fall of Nodonn
Adversary's coming, his breed on the run
Predicted in old tales, envisioned before
Indications of the Nigtfall War

Searching the land for the metallurgist
Only he can built the timemachine
The children of Abbaddon I protect now
Hidin' them within my mental screen

The longlasting winter, the fall of Nodonn
Adversary's coming, his breed on the run
Predicted in old tales, envisioned before
Indications of the Nigtfall War

Floating in trance in the Quicksilver pool
The lion, the dragon, the eagle - the healers

Symbols of being reborn in the world of the living
Will shine on forth in pain

The conquesting races in false harmony
Gathered on the ancient Field of Gold
I saw through their treachery, saw through their lies
Their minds are now ashes, their bodies are now cold

The longlasting winter, the fall of Nodonn
Adversary's coming, his breed on the run
Predicted in old tales, envisioned before
Indications of the Nigtfall War

The War...

"...and now,no one shall doubt my power.
For I am the non-born king, and only I rule the many - coloured land".

[Lars]
