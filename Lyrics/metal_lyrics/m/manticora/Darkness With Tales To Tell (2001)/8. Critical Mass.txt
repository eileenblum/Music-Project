I see no sense in what's going on
U sense no meaning, I see no light for us all
Cold chill in spine shows me no future
There's no safety around us - no protection, no wall

Blind ignorance throuth generations
It's hidden black on white, I turn to stare
There's a taste of blood in my mouth
It's sick, when I breathe the air

I see no light in the ways that I choose
No matter how I twist and turn, I lose
I see no light in the ways that I choose
No matter how I twist and turn, I lose

I can't escape the numb feeling of
Perpetual deceiving dreams again
Problems too dark to touch, we're reaching
Critical mass - The end

I see no light in the ways that I choose
No matter how I twist and turn, I lose
I see no light in the ways that I choose
No matter how I twist and turn, I lose

Silence in governments shows the taste of fear
Our world is falling apart, it's in the atmosphere!!
