You've betrayed the men by your side
People with hopes and with longing
Hopes of an endless Utopia
Now you see that a new plague is coming

...a new plague is coming
now you see that a new plague is coming.....

Take a look at your burning lands
You convinced them that you've got the power
The death and destruction that came from your hands
Will grow 'till it reaches your own tower

...it reaches your own tower
will grow 'till it reaches your own tower...

A ruler is killing  for pleasure
In a land all to near
We all look upon a cursed kingdom
The dynasty of fear
Fleeing your homes and your cities
That once to you was so dear
We all look upon a tragic kingdom
The dynasty of fear

The symphony of well-meant ideals
Working in laws of regressive progression
Enchanting the hearts and the souls of men
Dictating their violent agression

...their violent agression
dictating their violent agression...

A ruler is killing  for pleasure
In a land all to near
We all look upon a cursed kingdom
The dynasty of fear
Fleeing your homes and your cities
That once to you was so dear
We all look upon a tragic kingdom
The dynasty of fear
