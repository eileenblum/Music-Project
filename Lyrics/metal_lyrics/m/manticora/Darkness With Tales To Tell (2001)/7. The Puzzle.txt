A hundred lightyears away, lies a hidden heart
Made up for a purpose, I can't tell
A bridge so insane, it tears my soul apart
Made up for a reason I can't tell

I can't remember my own name
I look around, am I insane?
Eternity is lost, and I am turnin' upside down
Forever in the puzzle of my life

A path of crooked thorns leads my lonely way
Disappears in a distance, I can't tell
A shadow in the dark, makes me so afraid
Whispering me a story, I can't tell

I can't remember my own name
I look around, am I insane?
Eternity is lost, and I am turnin' upside down
Forever in the puzzle of my life

A path of crooked thorns leads my lonely way
Disappears in a distance, I can't tell
A shadow in the dark, makes me so afraid
Whispering me a story, I can't tell

I can't remember my own name
I look around, am I insane?
Eternity is lost, and I am turnin' upside down
Forever in the puzzle of my
Forever in the puzzle of my
Forever in the puzzle of my life
