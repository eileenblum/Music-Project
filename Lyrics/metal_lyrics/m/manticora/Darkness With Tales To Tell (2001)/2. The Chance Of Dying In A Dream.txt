The hunter,the dark one is craving your mind
Malicious,your dreaming is seen  as a sign
Your breath is burning,in a throat full of scream
No fear,you don't have to die in a dream

Twisted, distorted. out of proportions
The eyes and the mouths are placed in random disorder
Acid smell, fear as its skin starts to gleam
You've taken the chance of dying in a dream

Scream - the chance of dying in a dream -Scream
Scream,scream

Subdue to the metamorphosis of flesh
The pictures, to make you eternally mad
Beyong your reality, nothing is clear
You've waken the old ones and now they are here

Nothing is ever what it seems
Open the gates for me now
The calling for powers, the falling of towers,
Abstract to the weak fragile human mind

Scream - the chance of dying in a dream -Scream
Scream,scream

[Lars]
