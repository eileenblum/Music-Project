And I stand there like a King
Confronting you all, a hall of condemned
Almost like silent puppets on a string
You dance by my hands into the shadows of death

Your pathetic life means nothing to me
Random killings just for my exquisite pleasure
A violent game of destiny
I sit back and enjoy like judge and jury

Playing God...
Walk into my world of pain
Never walk out of here again
Playing God...
Soon I shall reveal for thee
The hatred buried deep in me

"Bones and skulls monumentally piled
To greet your arrival
Inhuman slavery, meaningless surgery
To prevent your survival"

And I stand there like a God
Watching my herd, my dejected flock
Disposing of your kind as if you were never here

Playing God...
Walk into my world of pain
Never walk out of here again
Playing God...
Soon I shall reveal for thee
The hatred buried deep in me
