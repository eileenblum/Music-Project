Left behind, pushed aside
Alone with my confusion
In sickness, in health, 'till death do us 'part
It was all an illusion

After dark, dressed in black
Still my presence is unknown
Watching you, with raging eyes
A side of me I've never shown

The deceit of my trust, the betrayal of my heart
My life in ruins, my world torn apart
Just floating around in a timeless hole
Holding on to my sanity, searching my soul
It feels like the end....

One wrong step, one wrong word
Every stranger you meet is a fake
No one else, deserves you like me
I strike like a slithering snake

The deceit of my trust, the betrayal of my heart
My life in ruins, my world torn apart
Just floating around in a timeless hole
Holding on to my sanity, searching my soul
It feels like the end....

"I let jealousy burn
Maybe then you will learn
As my pace is getting faster
And my rage is turning to laughter
I'm closing in on your back
I'm ready for the attack
I wish that time would re-wind
Too late... I... I... I'm only one step behind"

Terror on your face, horror in your mind
Your heart frozen dead in your chest
A mental note I'll send to you
Saying "I will never rest"

The deceit of my trust, the betrayal of my heart
My life in ruins, my world torn apart
Just floating around in a timeless hole
Holding on to my sanity, searching my soul
It feels like the end....
