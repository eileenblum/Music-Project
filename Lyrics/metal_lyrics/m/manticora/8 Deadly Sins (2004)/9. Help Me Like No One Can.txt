"...Branded deep inside with the mark of melancholy"

It hurts so much inside, like a lethal chill down my
spine
The destruction of my pride strangled this heart of
mine
I have to live with this tragedy, get used to
everybody's stare
A wilted flower inside of me, I know you no longer
care

I had a dream of breacking out from all the others
To me there was no other plan
Lost to myself now in a hole of self-destruction
Help me like no one can

...But what about me? 
What about my destiny 
No one else but me 
Could see the tragedy 
I'm drowning inside with apathy

My fires have disappeared, like the hopes of a better
day
My future sadly weird, the insanity has come to stay
I see you in the darkest night, talking through my
maze of depression
I almost feel your light, I turn my back on you with
no hesitation

I had a dream of breacking out from all the others
To me there was no other plan
Lost to myself now in a hole of self-destruction
Help me like no one can

...But what about me? 
What about my destiny 
No one else but me 
Could see the tragedy 
I'm drowning inside with apathy
