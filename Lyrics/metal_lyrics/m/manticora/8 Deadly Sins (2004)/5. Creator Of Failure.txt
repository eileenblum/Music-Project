"The issue of beauty lies in the eye of the beholder"

Future bright, now another dimension
Wrapped up in endless tension
In my blurry haze, I see no tomorrow
I'll drag you in coz'I'm crippled by sorrow
Downwards in a spiral I fall
Sentenced by my own pathetic call
Weak and fragile, thought I am strong
Pouring out a blind heart that went wrong

Sin upon sin, hidden deep within
The creator of failure will sell you anything
Worshipped for my deeds, sowing failure seeds
The creator of failure shall forever sing

...And the sweet I wished for in despair
Dissipates in empty, lifeless air
Seeking perfection I cry awkwardly
And re-enact the dream in fantasy
While my own deceit was called upon
You treated on me, waking aggression
I'll sell you the fortune if I can
Of dying for leaving me, a lonely man

Sin upon sin, hidden deep within
The creator of failure will sell you anything
Worshipped for my deeds, sowing failure seeds
The creator of failure shall forever sing

"Last night she abandoned me
This beautifull creature, she
Who chose to be forever by my side
When she was dressed in white
Now I am left here in misery"

I burn the pictures of you and I
And curse your name in outrageous cries
Hostile in order to keep up the show
That I can imagine the whole world's my foe
The oceans of dreams our emotions created
Have now become deceit-agitated
You, the virulent mutant cancer
I shall remove to build myself a decent answer

Sin upon sin, hidden deep within
The creator of failure will sell you anything
Worshipped for my deeds, sowing failure seeds
The creator of failure shall forever sing
