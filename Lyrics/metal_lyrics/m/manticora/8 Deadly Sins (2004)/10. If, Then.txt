[Outro]

Did I really sin?
Should I suffer these bleedings within?
All of my body lying stigmatised
Beneath my skin - A flood oversized
Baptised - Sacrificed - Cannibalised!

I know now that every man has his deadly sins
Based on the scale of his own hollow conscience
Will everyone feel the bleeding deadly touch?
Or was 8 just a number too much?
Soul transition - Pain ignition - Blood corruption!

What if my reasons to believe have turned invalid?
What if I desire to deceive have proven solid?
What if I missed the difference of ecstatic and
fanatic?
What if... What if... What if... then...?
