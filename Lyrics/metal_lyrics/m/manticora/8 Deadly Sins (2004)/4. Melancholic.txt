Waiting for you in a garden of hope
Where the fountain of dying light shines
Taking a stroll through a pleasure plane
Soon my idea of joy redefines

"Silence falls upon me
Silence fills my mind
Images awaken
Misery underlined"

Watching for you in a garden of joy
Where the silent breaths of the roses are heard
Flying alone in my pleasure plane
Experiencing possession by a single word

Wipe my tears away
Find me colours in my life today
In the blink of an eye
See a whole life passing by
Give me reason to live
In spheres of betrayal, we refuse to give

Found you in the garden of truth
Where the treacherous choirs of damnation sing
Killing my soul in the pleasure plane
In castles of sand I shall be the king

"Silence falls upon me
Silence fills my mind
Images awaken
Misery underlined"

Wipe my tears away
Find me colours in my life today
In the blink of an eye
See a whole life passing by
Give me reason to live
In spheres of betrayal, we refuse to give
