Time has passed since my crusade began
The hours that fled my mind are gone
Still I recognize the feelings that I had
A selfish ignorant me undone

And as I fall from grace
Trapped from time and space
Can't remember the days
The light on your pretty face

I threw away the time I had with you
To show my foolish state of mind
I can't pretend that I was feeling anything
Only darkness I would find

And as I fall from grace
Trapped from time and space
Can't remember the days
The light on your pretty face

"And I can feel no more
I can't see the flaws in my head
The old man on the street is me
I will never ever see
My ignorance! Ignorance!
My ignorance! Ignorance!"

And as I fall from grace
Trapped from time and space
Can't remember the days
And as I fall from grace
Can't remember the days
...The light on your pretty face...
