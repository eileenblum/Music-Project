[Going back]

[Instrumental part]

Can I cover your eyes with my hands?
Can I make you walk in my darkened lands?
A pawn to move around in my game of chess
Feeling down?
Come to me child and confess

Oh what I'd give to be able to see
Your shameless mirrored reflections of me
Soulless eyes that try to penetrate
The shell I made, to find out it's too late

I use you solely for the sake of me 
In egocentric vile fantasy
Self-indulgent; I am throwing you in the dirt
In my own dark dream
I'm king of the absurd

Can I measure my intelligence on you?
Can I use you as my tool to pass on through?
The halls of dark oblivion thay make
I'm the diamond that was made to never break

"So you wormed your way into my line of thoughts
Passing all the trenches I built to keep you out
And you found the barrier that no one else could break
A synaptic fortress to show you what I'm all about"

Hollowed out by speculation 
In everlasting vile equation
Self indulgence; I'm drowing you in the dirt
In my own reality
I'm king of the absurd
