["Through a slow and painfull awakening"]

...They met on the captain's dining platform.
Seven pilgrims with different stories,
But neverless with equal main factor
- the mystery of the Chrome bladed creature
... the Beast

Each one carrying the hope of being the chosen one,
To have his wish fulfilled,
Knowing that the other six must die hoping.

All must they tell their story!
