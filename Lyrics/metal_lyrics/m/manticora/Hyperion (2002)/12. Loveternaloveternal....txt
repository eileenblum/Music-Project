["From true love only pain emerges, and yet the universe becomes one"]

We floated on the oceans in hazy dreams of love
Living life to the full, sun blazing from above
Strangers from different worlds
Yet oh so much the same
Dearest - I'll never forget your name
...I'll always remember your name

Making love under the water
Feel the pleasure on my skin
In your eyes I saw the burning flame
Of passionate vitality to fight a sin

[HOLOGRAM:]
Shipman, my love, to hide your disgrace
That, at least, I think, you could have done for me
See me the way I was in between "our" days
Shipman - The pain shall not leave you, it stays
...The pain crushes your heart forever

Making love under the water
Feel the pleasure on my skin
In your eyes I saw the burning flame
Of passionate vitality to fight a sin

It's time for the people of the sea to meet up with their sharks

You're ageing much faster than me
...irrevocable time debt separates us

Making love under the water
Feel the pleasure on my skin
In your eyes I saw the burning flame
Of passionate vitality to fight a sin

Entering your tomb, your monument of pride
On our last reunion, I'm there but you have died
Missing your touch - the energy you give
Dearest - you're gone, but your legend will live on

Your memory will last forever

I'm crying tears that you will never see...
