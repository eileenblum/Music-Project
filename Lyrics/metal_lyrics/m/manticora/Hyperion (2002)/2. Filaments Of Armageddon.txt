["In the Blazing Sunlight , the priest unveiled his horrid tale..."]

I travelled on through the swamplands , sailed up the river damp
To bring back the church from its state of oblivion
A mission to the land of the long gone retired tribe
The inbred people on the edge of the cleft
I crossed the lightning horrors of the burning forest
To face my unattainable holy task
A Hell alive , Armageddon , a violent energetic eruption
Of immense proportions

Domine Dirige Nos

Kept alive for eternity by this throbbing parasite
Distorting , numbing , mind reducing - Eternal life through this horrid growth

"Saying mass in my life's work - the awe striking chapel
- sweet communion , I'm at inner peace"
... to drive out this parasite by self inflicted non-lethal pain...
"I am eternal , immortal"
...I'm swirling in a vortex of the deepest agony...
...offered an eternity of mindless life...

I saw the wonder of a giant church carved into the moutainside
A descending path into the mystery of the labyrinthine worlds
Idolized and worshipped by the tribe of the short retard men
... I began praying to my God again

We walked into the tunnel mouth, eroded by elements
As darkness gave away to light brighter than thousand stars
I was embraced by the legendary avatar , (the creature of death)
In the illuminated glowing vaults

...I'll fight my immortality

Kept alive for eternity by this throbbing parasite
Distorting , numbing , mind reducing - Eternal life through this horrid growth
