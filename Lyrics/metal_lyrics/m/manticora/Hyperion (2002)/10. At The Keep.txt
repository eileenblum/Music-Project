["Everything changes tonight"]

Finally arriving at the keep
Reaching safety - the child asleep
Altars of atonement aqainst the walls
Whispering echoes in the endless halls

rough carved corridors painted blood red
Sparks of explosion from the distant bloodshed
Illuminates the sky with colours of gold
As the last story of the pilgrims unfold

... so hear the Keep - it shall reveal the traitor
