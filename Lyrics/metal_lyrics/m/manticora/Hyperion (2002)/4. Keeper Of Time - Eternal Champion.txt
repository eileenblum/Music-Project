["In love and dreams she comes to me... The Keeper of Time"]

Life as a soldier was all to easy for me - To eradicate and annihilate fit my identity
Raised as a fighting machine, to destroy the enemy threat
Suddenly and with no sense you came with the bloodshed

Sons and daughters of war, I have witnessed a creature I can't control anymore
Fell in love with a girl of the future, now talk to me, teach me... war lovers we will be!

You made a difference in the chaos I saw - You gave me a reason not to fight anymore
In between rage and sudden death - You gave me hope - you stole my breath

Brainwashed in the art of war I've got the will to fight on - All sense of humanity is a history              
-long gone
Following the orders - no remorse or no fear - You appeared to me
Like a mad dream here

Then you came from a distant unknown, between dream and reality
Fighting together from time to time, now talk to me, teach me... war lovers we will be!

I met you in your past, but in my future in a meeting still to come
And listened to your whispers, you had a voice that made me numb
Your eyes blazed like jewels in the sun as you whispered in my ear
I'll take care of you my love - you've got nothing to fear

When morning came, we kept each other perfectly warm in the chilling breeze
Constantly sand or snow tore at naked walls
Your voice burred with the hint of an accent unknown
Constantly sand or snow tore at naked walls

In a time of passion I close my eyes....... And see :
Bodies burning in the solid laser light
Heat of plasma explosions as I try to survive the night
Fireballs enlarging as I lie among the dead
More dead to come as suns explode in ruby red

THE DYING WORLDS!!!

Star systems, extinct in spasms of deadly fire
Thickened air itself aflame as I can't control my desire
Seas of superheated air rise in vast pulses of flame
Blazing in mad heat - you brought a war from where you came

THE DYING WORLDS!!!
