I lack the courage of youth
The power to struggle and fight
Not ever achieving my lying dreams
Not solving my problems right

A victim of passivity and indolence
I cast twisted shadows on your openminded sense
Guess I have to scream it out
Things they do not work your ways
Guess I have to scream it out right...
Right in your face

Buried in a coffin filled with dirt
Even though I try the rope is 'round my neck
It seems as if a hundred years have passed
It's the walls around me I will never break

A victim of passivity and indolence
I cast twisted shadows on your openminded sense
Guess I have to scream it out
Things they do not work your ways
Guess I have to scream it out right...
Right in your face

Years are wasted, they always are
And betrayal is the blind man's faith, I know
Time's too expensive and that's a fact
I look at you from here - it's from below

A victim of passivity and indolence
I cast twisted shadows on your openminded sense
Guess I have to scream it out
Things they do not work your ways
Guess I have to scream it out right...
Right in your face
