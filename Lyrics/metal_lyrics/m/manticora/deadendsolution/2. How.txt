What you get is what you see
Stick around in the infinity
Killing among our breed
You know on our lives you feed

You're to me - misery
I can't see (I can't see no mercy for your soul) - no mercy

All for nothing once again
That's nothing at all - dead end
Making up apologies
For the life - and you won't lose it

You're to me - misery
I can't see (I can't see no mercy for your soul) - no mercy

There's no honesty in truth these days
Just go on, live out your violent ways
There's no honesty in truth these days
How can you...
How can you...
How can you do it?

Sterilized by drugs you can't destroy
Never wish for you, life to enjoy
Sterilized by drugs you can't destroy
How can you...
How can you...
How can you do it?
