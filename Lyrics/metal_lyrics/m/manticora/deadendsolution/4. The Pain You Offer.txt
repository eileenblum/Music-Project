A cluster of rain in the sky
Took my breath from me
Turned my quest to impossibility
Made me no longer wanna see

And time it continues again and again
Aging my body and mind
Repulsive eruption of outrage
My selfish way to unwind

See the dark side of her
See how I'm filled with her
Rotting inside of me
Slaughter of dignity
I'm not sure I know
I know I'm sure
I turned my back and there she was

You know I can't resist the pain
The pain you offer me tonight
I'm drowning all alone, there's no one here
There's no one here to save my soul

The hand of greed it tells me
My beliefs are torn apart
Mindcontrol - it pulls me under
I'm devastated - I'm scarred

See the dark side of her
See how I'm filled with her
Rotting inside of me
Slaughter of dignity
I'm not sure I know
I know I'm sure
I turned my back and there she was
