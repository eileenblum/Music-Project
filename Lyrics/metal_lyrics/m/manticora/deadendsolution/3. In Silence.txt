Why do I see you
When you're not there
I can't believe the things you said
About the stairs

A long climb, a long walk
For no reason at all
Your empty eyes of dying pride
Forcing you to fall

Away - in silence
Away - in silence
To stay - in silence
I won't pray

I will remember
The smile on your face
Everytime the sun will shine
You will be there again

A long time, centuries
They are killing me
I will hold on to my last beliefs
To find out that you have gone

Away - in silence
Away - in silence
To stay - in silence
I won't pray
Away - in silence
Away - in silence
To stay - in silence
I won't pray
