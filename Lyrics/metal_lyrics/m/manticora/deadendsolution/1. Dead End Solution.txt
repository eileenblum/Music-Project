So what if your mind's messed up
I don't care if you live or die
You can tell me all your philosophies
All I see is one hell of a lie

You're a dead man in disguise
You're weak as time it flies

I am the snake in paradise
I'll be your hatred mountainsize
I am the retribution in your mind
I'll be your sword - the killing kind

I've searched for more in my life
Than you can ever bring
Now I'm here to look right in your eyes
I'm here to drain your energy

It's my solution, it's my command
To kill your lies and make a stand

I am the snake in paradise
I'll be your hatred mountainsize
I am the retribution in your mind
I'll be your sword - the killing kind

Now I know your mind's messed up
I know you're weaker than I
Your prostitution's obvious
And I couldn't care if you die

Don't come sneaking around me again
Cause my life's better without you, my friend

I am the snake in paradise
I'll be your hatred mountainsize
I am the retribution in your mind
I'll be your sword - the killing kind
The killing kind
The killing kind

The killing kind
The killing kind
The killing kind
