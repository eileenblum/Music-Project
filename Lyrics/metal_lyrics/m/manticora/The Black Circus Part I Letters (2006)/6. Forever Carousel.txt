My dearest friend,

Standing in the middle of the playground site you see the giant carousel with a sign saying children come to me.
Awe striking and full of life it surges through the air, one of many things you'll find to thrill you at this fair.
As electrical power engage you take your seat and enjoy the ride, round and round in circles you go and move into the light.
The innocence featured on this fantastic carousel makes you ride the light-shining carrier until they ring the bell.
I hear the children cry: "Mommy, can I go?"

Faster, it feels like this ride will go on and on... forever caressing your mind, eating your soul till you're blind.
Faster I feel like this ride is forevermore...
Once you try this carousel you never want to stop.

Horses, dragons, demons, you'll feel the magic of the tour as speedy, merging lights create a dizzying blur in the freezing night.
You won't feel the numbing cold as you stare at the pictures of the creatures of old!

Oh, how the children plead: "Mommy, can I go?"

Come on. Let's go faster.
It feels like this ride will go on and on...forever caressing your mind, eating your soul till you're blind.
Faster, I feel like this ride is forevermore...
Once you try this carousel you never want to stop.
