My friend,

As you visit the mindbender he presents his show in an extraordinary fashion.
"Welcome to my charming stage, feel free to volunteer.
Spectacular hypnosis all for you who are gathered here.
So don't be afraid my friend, all I can steal is your mind...
Seek absolution and you shall find."

He picked a young woman for hypnosis and said:
"Digging in your past I see your secrets now.
All your childhood fears they will surface anyhow.
So don't be afraid to let it all out, the only thing I can do is plant a seed of doubt.
Stare into my eyes, feel your body relaxing and believe in my lies.
Look into your soul, think that it belongs to me and fall into the endless hole."

In an even eerier voice he bellowed:
"I'll take your fantasies into a deep pit from where they won't disappear.
I will alter your brainwaves so you'll never again think clear.
Now, don't be afraid to let me in, all I can steal is your mind."
And so his chant went on and on and on...
"Stare into my eyes, feel your body relaxing and believe in my lies.
Look into your soul, know that it belongs to me and fall into the endless hole."

I stumbled out of the frightening tent and let my mind wander as I ran into the woods surrounding the circus...
