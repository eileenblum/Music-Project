Dear Friend,

I have finally found my call.
I shall tour in these landscapes with a circus of old times.
A carnival that belongs to the ancient travelling people of the old continent.
I would like to write and bid you welcome to the show â it is nothing like you know... but it will surely be something to remember.
I have waited for so long to get to move along and now it is funny how I can feel so small.
I am not going to waste more of your time with my bleak writings and silly rhyme.
I will write you about this fantastic show and maybe in a while you know, my dear friend... I bid you welcome to the show.
