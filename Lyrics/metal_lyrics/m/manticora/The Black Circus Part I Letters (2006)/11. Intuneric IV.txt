I've been given an offer by the gypsies, to become one of them, I already feel a bond I can't explain
So I can't see a reason to turn them down, is as if I'm losing my sanity, but gaining so much more instead
They discovered me an evening, while I saw something "I was not supposed to see"
It was a secret meeting that took place at the big tent of the Gypsy that "bends minds"
I've been invited to the next meeting by the Romani, they call it "the daily summoning" "the daily gathering"
At midnight, when the circus is empty and people are gone, this is so exciting...
