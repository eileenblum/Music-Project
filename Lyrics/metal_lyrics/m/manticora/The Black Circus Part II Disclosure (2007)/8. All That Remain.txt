Not a single trace, everything is gone, the circus has disappeared
Cool morning air, the dawn will come soon, the end of a night so weird

Walking purposeless, watching horrified, the bodies left all around
With the rotting smell of blood your last hope dies,
insane you fall to the ground

As you're lying there
A voice is singing to you
A growl as from deep inside the earth

For centuries your lost soul have been our feast
We leave your remains to bird and to beast
But in the black emptiness of space so cold
We'll wait patiently till we're older than old
And when finally the stars are right once again
We'll come back to rule you with torture and pain
Burning, destroying and with a violent gust
All that remains are ashes and dust

Again before your eyes, the gypsies are dancing,
a bloody face in the rising sun
you stumble to your feet, and without looking back,
you're screaming in fear as you run

As you're running away
A voice is singing to you
A growl as from deep inside your head

For centuries your lost soul have been our feast
We leave your remains to bird and to beast
But in the black emptiness of space so cold
We'll wait patiently till we're older than old
And when finally the stars are right once again
We'll come back to rule you with torture and pain
Burning, destroying and with a violent gust
All that remains are ashes and dust
