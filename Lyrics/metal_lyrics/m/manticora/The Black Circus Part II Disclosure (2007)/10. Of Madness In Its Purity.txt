Like a vampire, living beneath the stars -
I feel burned by the sun
Alive for a single purpose, to bring back the rulers -
to bring back the one
Finally, I found my call, my self has returned -
I'm free, I am strong
And will my faith restored in an entiny -
I'll see the World undone

Open your eyes to see the truth.
Oh, if only you knew.

If you could just see - if you could just hear their voices
You would follow us to the end of the World, and find eternal life.

Clearly I am not mas as I thought -
no one's controlling my mind
I feel inspired yes, but make the calls -
reality's for the blind
Would you really want to wage a war on a foe such as this -
full of might, full of death
I reccomend you to think again -
to become one of us and to bow in awe

Open your eyes to see the truth.
Oh, if only you knew.

If you could just see - if you could just hear their chanting
You would follow us to the end of immortality in eternal times

I would sacrifice my disbelief in you.
Oh, if you open your eyes to see the truth

If you could just see - if you could just hear their voices
You would follow us to the end of the World, and find eternal life.

If you could just see - if you could just hear their commands
You would follow us to be swept away by madness in it's purity

Purity!
