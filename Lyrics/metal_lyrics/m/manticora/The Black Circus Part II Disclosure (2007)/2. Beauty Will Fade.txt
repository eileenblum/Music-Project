There he stands, silent and proud
Doing his worst to please you, the crowd
Dressed to seduce, in living ropes
Surrounded by an aura of dreams and hopes

Vivid colours in a beautiful blur
Weird shapes to trick your minds
Twisting in and out of form
Reflecting infinite dreams

This is so much more than smoke and mirrors
Mesmerize
Hypnotize
Paralyse

Beauty will fade - wonders will fall
This magic conquers you all
Secrecy is gloomy and pure
Illusions - How can you be sure?

Authoritarian and standing tall
He commands you - one and all
Raise his hands to cast his spell
He has no heart to do you well

Hateful gloomy atmosphere
Astral signs from a future dark
A whispering and crawling fog
Echoes infinite nightmares

This is so much more than smoke and mirrors
Violation
Exploitation
Deprivation

Beauty will fade - wonders will fall
This magic conquers you all
Secrecy is gloomy and pure
Illusions - How can you be sure?

What is real? What is not?
Nothing matters when you lie in your blood
Waiting in silence for the magic trance
Now the gypsies will do their dance
