SILENCE...!

All the sounds have faded, everyone holds their breath
Suddenly aware of the heavy smell of death
Countless bodies shattered, like confetti on the floor
A single voice in the corner whispers "no more"

Entering the stage, floating like on shiny mist
Cloaked in pitch-black, with a binding silver chime in his fist
Dead eyes staring, at the dying panickering crowd
As he rings the chime monotonous, ears bleeding loud

Out of the sky
Riding on high
On wings of fire they're burning the night
Sharp as a knife
Destroyers of life
Reaping your souls to put out your lights
SOULREAPERS!

Of ancient time, from forgotten stars
Of unknown life, never healing scars

Out of the sky
Riding on high
On wings of fire they're burning the night
Sharp as a knife
Destroyers of life
Reaping your souls to put out your lights
SOULREAPERS!

With a piercing infernal blast, the sealing cracks to the free
A black hole on the black sky, the air filled with intensity
Waves of loaded energy, hits the frozen mass
Followed by the roaring sound, of ignited gas

Bursting out of the black, an ancient creature of old
Engulfed in living flames, but still the air is cold

Bodies rising from the ground, bleeding when stripped of their souls
A last victorious scream, as it fades into the black hole
All love's lost and all hope dies. All turns black, when the soulreapers cry
