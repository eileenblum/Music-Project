As you enjoy the show we stealthily sneak around
Behind the rows of spectators we empty your pockets
If your eyeballs were purely made of gold
We'd rip them out of their filthy bleeding sockets

With the secret skills that no one master better
We make your dearest possessions disappear
On the stage your vision is focused on the dancers
Don't turn your head now - our daggers will cut deep and clear

While the gypsies dance
- Your mind will be enchanted
While the gypsies dance
- You face a pick-pocket hand or a knife
While the gypsies dance
- Ooups, you turned your head towards us now
While the gypsies dance
- If we can't take your gold, we'll take your life

While the gypsies dance, the crowd is reduced in sheer brutality
Spellbound and shocked, people vanish into black insanity
Blood fills the rows where fathers once held their ponytailed daughters
And no one seems to notice the unbelievable slaughters

Now we take back what we know belong to us
Salvation lies in shiny gems - they satisfy
Unobstructed, we empower our own future
We'd steal the whole world in the blink of an eye

While the gypsies dance
- Your mind will be enchanted
While the gypsies dance
- You face a pick-pocket hand or a knife
While the gypsies dance
- Ooups, you turned your head towards us now
While the gypsies dance
- If we can't take your gold, we'll take your life
