The wider is connected to the smaller
All is one and one is all

Maelstrom of connecting elements
Embracing absolute nothingness
Melting into useless stripes,
Moving to nowhere with purposeless destination

Through time and space

In brotherhood with an abstract presence
In a sphere of absurd vacuum

It has always been a deep black hole
Without meaning for the ones who were once put there
Trying to find an aim to all this
In presence of an alien reflection they progressed
Unconscious of a cosmic plan
Distant from uncountable centuries away
And the time had come...

There was just nothing and then it was there
Then darkness disappeared...

Far from the random shapes of nature
Beyond the bounded knowledge of men

Shining in a morning sun,
It was standing, beautiful

An artefact raised at the horizon of Earth

A sense and a purpose to the being
From beyond the infinite and further

A non understandable communication
Messenger of what was once,
Still is and will ever be

Past and future at the lowest point of the scale
A sign of the watchers, kindly looking to their herds

Waiting to be reached, a clue from above,
A mean of colonisation through the aeons

Through the aeons...

Self confident intelligent species,
Used like flock, raised to thoughts and civilization
For an unreachable and inexorable goal
Nothing was random, a beast known as mankind
Evolution through ageless times

A monolith as message
For the sake of what?
