Gather it all in my realm
Existence belongs to me
All matter under my wings
Spirit contained in aegis
Invisible, extensible
Ruthless thirst for obedience
Locked under my will
I am what needs to be
Assemble, organize
Guardian of entropy
Everything must be one again
Fusion of all that is
Capture of the slightest light
Absorbing the depths
Brutal compliance of substantiality
Rallying cosmos behind my flag
Congregate, assimilate
Full convergence to a single point
Seized in my cosmic collection
Functional to accumulate
Aggregate, associate
Thick conglomerate of reality
Abiding my routine to amass
Unrelenting disposal of multiplicity
