Signal from the binary system
Eclipsing black rectangle
Gigantic mass of dark matter
An answer was provided
No record of settled colonies

So eager to find companionship
Or in search of Prometheus

Defying the bounds of space and time
Anchored in faith and arrogance
In such a distant place
Sentinel on guard duty

Only evidence
Condemned to solitude
No witness to tell where they are
No traces but monoliths

So eager to find companionship
Or in search of Prometheus

Defying the bounds of space and time
Anchored in faith and arrogance
In such a distant place
Sentinel on guard duty

Signal from the dual system
Eclipsing dark rectangle
Gigantic mass of black substance
An answer at disposal
Without traces, just monoliths
