And the time has come.
The last monolith was standing there.
We all knew it was our light.
And our doom. And our fate.
The gates of knowledge are wide open.
We have felt its breath.
Our protector. Our god.
Our creator. Our destroyer.
The artifact of a higher sentience.
We've learned we don't belong here.
Merely a cure for its ageless illness.
An illusion of life. A method of mayhem.
An injection. The void eater.
We'll cease that growing menace.
Until our own end.
We're not supposed to live here.
But we were made to arrive here.
There was nothing and then we were there.
The monolith was the key.
Attached to our existence.
We are the alien breed.
We all know we belong to darkness.
This place is going to return to serenity.
With it, without us.
