They tried to speak with no language.
As astral equilibrium was standing
on a razor's edge once again an oracle
has been sent to the bounds. Resurrected
for uncountable times with a message
to leave. In machinery those who were
there before carved their names, in flesh
and blood the sound of the herd breeds
the race. They tried to teach us who
we are. On monolithic pillars life has
found the script of its own. How many
more to raise... How much space
to cross... How long will it last...
How much new branches will grow...
Is the truth hidden in endlessness?
Monolithic pillars, ten feet underground.
And so much more out there. Just
under our blind eyes. Like a book with
unknown words. Like thoughts without
logic. It was there and that was all.
We searched answers, but all we got

...was silence.
