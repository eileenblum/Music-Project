Deep, dark, meanings that bless our souls
A sense of feeling we've lost
Dark, deep shadows consume us whole
We don't consider that cost
Amps turned up in the dead of night
A subtle moonlit glow
Anticipating with bloodless cries
Welcome to the show

Bring hell
To the holy
Bringing hell
Bring hell
To the holy
We're bringing hell
To the holy ones
To the holy ones

Decapitated, the torsos lie
Piles of severed heads
Religious conversations reversed
Summoning words of the dead
Consume your body to gain your soul
Raping your mind as they please
We join together so they can't win
We'll bring them to their knees

Bring hell
To the holy
Bringing hell
Bring hell
To the holy
We're bringing hell
To the holy ones
To the holy ones

Will you do it - Come on, Come on, Come on, Come on
You want to do it - Come on, Come on, Come on, Come on
Will you do it - Come on, Come on, Come on, Come on
You want to do it - Come on, Come on, Come on, Come on

Hell
To the holy ones
Hell
To the holy
