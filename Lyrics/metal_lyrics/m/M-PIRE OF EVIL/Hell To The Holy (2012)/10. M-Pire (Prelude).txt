This evil rules the m-pire
Worshipped and obeyed
His evil stokes the fires
The weakest shall be slain

His anger will be feared
His fires will scorch your bones
Bow down before your king
And kneel before his throne

Feel the power surge right through your soul
See the monolith stand, cast from gold
Sense the evil rising, out of man
Join the holy chant of Hail Satan

M-pire
From blackened hearts of man
M-pire
God's unholy clan
M-pire
At lucifer's left hand
M-pire
Of evil
Evil
