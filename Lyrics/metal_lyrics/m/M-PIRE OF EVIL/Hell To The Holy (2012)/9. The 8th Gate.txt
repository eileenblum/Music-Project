Beyond the realm, where demons dwell, far past the flames of hell
Remains a gate, denied to all, wherein true evil lies
The 7 gates, lie open wide and hell breaks out on earth
But far beyond the reach of all, where hatred gave its birth
Drenched in blood and swathed in gold, the sins of humankind
One million martyrs screaming souls, within here you will find

All hell behold
The sins of man
Since ages old
On earth behold
Since time began
You sold your souls

Now you have the key
For eternity
Behold the 8th gate
Now you turn the key
It's your destiny
Behold the 8th gate

There is a secret, deep within, the sacred lake of flames
Kept by one so evil, known by so many names
He's there each night, you fall asleep, he wakes with you at dawn
He'll take your hand when you're with death, he's there when you are born
Approach the lock and place it there and soon all will be found
Turn the key, reveal yourself, mirrored in your eyes

All hell behold
The sins of man
Since ages old
On earth behold
Since time began
You sold your souls

All hell behold
The sins of man
Since ages old
On earth behold
Since time began
You sold your souls
