You believe, faith is all you have
Question nothing, blindly led
But who does your god save?
John the Baptist to Jesus Christ
Mohammed's holy war
Mary, mother, sweet and true
Or Magdalene the whore?

All hail
Crucifying, endless pain, mother Mary's son
All hail
When the world's reduced to dust, for the love of god
All hail
Seek redemption at the hands of those who lust for war
All hail
When you down there on your knees pray, for the love of god
All hail

Could you be so naive
You think that you're the one?
You're all god's orphan's
One and all abandoning his son
Jehovah's witness witnessed what
And what did Mary see?
A thousand fates to drown our mind complete insanity

All hail
Behind the preacher at the death, the sins that he forgave
All hail
Wasted blessings all for what? For the love of god
All hail
Now the page that turns for us, is bathing us in sin
All hail
Where we start is where we end for the love of god

All hail
Crucifying endless pain, mother Mary's son
All hail
When the world's reduced to dust, for the love of god
All hail
Seek redemption at the hands of those who lust for war
All hail
When you down there on your knees pray, for the love of god
