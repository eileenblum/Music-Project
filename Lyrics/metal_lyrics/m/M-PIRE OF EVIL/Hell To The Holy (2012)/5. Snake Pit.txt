Take a seat, fill a glass, let me tell the tale
One hot night in '85, this joint just came alive
The snake was on the jukebox and so the scene was set
She caught my eye, between her thigh, we made a little bet

Her curves beyond compare one more drink will get me there
Two more drinks I'll be prepared, out of your league

Southern comfort, vodka spin, whisky and a little gin
It's time to let me in, down at the snake pit
Hair and denim, leather and lace, bullet belts we all embrace
This is our sacred place, this is the snake pit

Long blonde hair, patchoulie oil, one more look the snake uncoils
Spandex clad, skirt so tight, time to make a move
Who's the band? No one cares, one more drink, I'm down the stairs
Stake your place and 'bang your head' down in the snake pit

One more bottle, I'm your man, if I can't do it, no one can
Hey babe I'm in the band, I'm in the snakepit

Southern comfort, vodka spin, whisky and a little gin
It's time to let me in, down at the snake pit
Hair and denim, leather and lace, bullet belts we all embrace
This is our sacred place, this is the snake pit

Bang your head

Judas Priest, she's cold as ice
And Iron Maiden's Kiss
A Rainbow from a Scorpion
A heart-less Angelwitch

Southern comfort, vodka spin, whisky and a little gin
It's time to let me in, down at the snake pit
Hair and denim, leather and lace, bullet belts we all embrace
This is our sacred place, this is the snake pit
