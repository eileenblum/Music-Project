Rise to fight and kill, we kill
Die, we die, the will to live
End to end and dust to dust
Prime of life evil lust

Disembowel, eviscerate, annihilate, disseminate, tearing down the walls of lies of those
From which they emanate, look and seek and you shall find, their leaving all the good behind
Raise your hands motherfucking hellspawn

Rise
To arms hellspawn
Rise
All hail hellspawn
Rise
Wie geht es hellspawn
Rise
Till death hellspawn

Life in black we stand as one
Here's to you, it has begun
It's your time to show them all
Horns held high, to heed the call

Disembowel, eviscerate, annihilate, disseminate, tearing down the walls of lies of those
From which they emanate, look and seek and you shall find, their leaving all the good behind
Raise your hands motherfucking hellspawn

Rise
To arms hellspawn
Rise
All hail hellspawn
Rise 
Wie geht es hellspawn
Rise
Till death hellspawn

I'm primed
Locked and loaded
Metal in my brain
I'm evil
Heretic
Metal in my veins
Locked and loaded
Now is your time
Primed and evil

Yeah rise
Hellspawn
Rise
Are you with us
Rise
Let me hear you say
Rise!
