Demons, that press my senses
Evil, that speaks to me
Life and death, I'll give to you
Death And life I'll take from you
You'll be waking up dead

Burning, I feel it burning
Raging inside of me
Life and death, I'll give to you
Death and life I'll take from you
You'll be waking up dead

Life and death I give to you
Death and life I'll take from you
You'll be waking up dead
You'll be waking up dead

Dreams and solitude
Waits to hold me back
Please leave me alone
I die and turn to black

You'll be waking up dead

Dying, I think I'm dying
Falling into my mind

Life and death I give to you
Death and life I'll take from you
You'll be waking up dead
Waking up dead
Waking up dead
