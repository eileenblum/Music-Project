You hide behind your smoke, you're going down you fucking joke
No leaning on the rope, one shot goodnight!
No way to make it right, no judge, stand and fight
Yellow strip down your spine here is the grudge, now is the time

Got to choose, pay your dues, you end is over too, either way you lose

Shockwave
Intense and volatile
Shockwave
Collision course
Shockwave
Explode and amplified
Shockwave
No remorse

Your time is over now, you wonder when, you wonder how
You took your final bow and it's on its way
You feel your world collide from everywhere and every side
Personal genocide, and I'm on my way

Don't react, face the fact, borrowed time, you crossed the line

Shockwave
Intense and volatile
Shockwave
Collision course
Shockwave
Explode and amplified
Shockwave
No remorse

Living endlessly inside your head
Motherfucker, you're a long time dead

Now you're within my sight, how will you sleep at night
I'll help you see the light, will Jesus save?
Completely unaware, in shadows everywhere
Come face me if you dare, your final breath

Change your ways, nowhere to run, you live your final days, your time has come

Shockwave
Intense and volatile
Shockwave
Collision course
Shockwave
Explode and amplified
Shockwave
No remorse
