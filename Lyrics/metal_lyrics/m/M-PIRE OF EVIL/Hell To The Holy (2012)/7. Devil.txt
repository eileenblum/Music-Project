A widow on a Sabbath day, the snake that did us wrong
Way before it all began the delta sang it's song
A honey dripping hooker, drove me blind in a muddy creek
I was talking to the devil, when I swear I heard my momma speak
She said
Don't go down to the crossroads, it'll take you straight to hell
Sold my soul at the crossroads, got me some of that 6 string hell

Yeah
Gimmie some'o that
Hell yeah
I want some'o that
Hell yeah
I got nothing to lose
Yeah
Gimmie some'o them devil blues

From Singapore to Santa Fe, the whisky soaks my soul
Another drink, another day, in the name of rock and roll
Reign in heaven reign in hell, coz lightning can't strike twice
When your sliding with the devil, it's time to pay the price
He says
Slide the lightning Elmore, got me some tales to tell
Sold my soul at the crossroads, got me some of that 6 string hell

Yeah
Gimmie some'o that
Hell yeah
I want some'o that
Hell yeah
I got nothing to lose
Yeah
Gimmie some'o them devil blues

Gimmie some'o that
Want some'o that devil blues

Hell yeah
I want some'o that
Hell yeah
Gimmie some'o that
Hell yea
Gimmie some'o those devil tunes
Hell yeah
I want some'o that devil blues
Hell yeah
Bake me some'o that devil's food
