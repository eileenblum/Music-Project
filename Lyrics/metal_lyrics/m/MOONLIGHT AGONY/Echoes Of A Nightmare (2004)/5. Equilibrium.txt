[Music: Willstedt, Mellstrom, Lyrics: Willstedt, Landin]

A mutilated spirit
corrupted by oppression
I'm stronger I want my revenge
(the dark power runs through your veins)
Pray for your lives kneel for my feet
still I will spare no one

[Chorus:]
Feel my wrath
I will repay the ones
That crushed me
Watch your back
Vengeance will strike you down
regret your deeds

A life in solitude
(It's time to show them, do what has to be done)
Your deeds enslaved my hungry soul
I'm stronger I want my revenge
(the dark power runs through your veins)
Pray for your lives kneel for my feet
still I will spare no one

[Chorus:]
Feel my wrath
I will repay the ones
That crushed me
Watch your back
Vengeance will strike you down
regret your deeds

[Chorus:]
Feel my wrath
I will repay the ones
That crushed me
Watch your back
Vengeance will strike you down
regret your deeds
Feel my wrath
I will repay the ones
That crushed me
Watch your back
Vengeance will strike you down
regret your deeds
