[Music: Willstedt, Mellstrom, Lyrics: Willstedt, Landin]

A life, all wasted on false ideas
My eyes, I can't see clear

A shadow fell, inflamed my eyes with rage
Discover the way, to ecstasy
Imprisoned for eons, in exile from the world
Unleash the fear

[Chorus:]
Into darkness, searching the truth
Painful visions,haunting my mind
turned into two, insanitys creation
Moon is rising, filling my body with hate

Awake til dawn, another sleepless night
It's burning my soul, I'm torn apart
A vision growing stronger, I see an open path
It all makes sense

[Chorus:]
Into darkness, searching the truth
Painful visions,haunting my mind
turned into two, insanitys creation
Moon is rising, filling my body with hate

Stronger here I rise
Free from all my bonds
Morbid ways to find revenge
Creature of the

Night turns to day
all the fear fading away
Now, I see it clear, deeper and deeper i fall

[Chorus:]
Into darkness, searching the truth
Painful visions,haunting my mind
turned into two, insanitys creation
Moon is rising, filling my body with hate

Stronger here I rise
Free from all my bonds
Morbid ways to find revenge
Creature of the night

Stronger here I rise
Free from all my bonds
Morbid ways to find revenge
Creature of the night
