[Music: Landin, Willstedt, Lyrics: Willstedt]

Insane, i slay my sworn enemies
with the demon right by my side
My fate was destined since long ago
Only bloodshed keeps me going on

With my mind and spirit you'll win
(You know I give myself to thee)
Come follow my footsteps I'm greater than all
This nightfall in moonlight we'll rise
(We're brothers in eternal oath)
The dark scrolls possessing my mind

None can stop our rage
(Fluid red will still our thirst)
My guidance you follow, destruction awaits
A storm raging up in the sky
(Chaos spreading in the world)
All fear us no souls will be spared

[Chorus:]
From the deepest crypts of earth
Our ancient codes were made
Doomed to spread destruction to the world
All fear my strength, I will chase you down
From the nightfall, 'til the first spring of the light
As the mayhem fills the night

With my mind and spirit you'll win
(You know I give myself to thee)
Come follow my footsteps I'm greater than all
This nightfall in moonlight we'll rise
(We're brothers in eternal oath)
The dark scrolls possessing my mind

[CHORUS]
From the deepest crypts of earth
Our ancient codes were made
Doomed to spread destruction to the world
All fear my strength, I will chase you down
From the nightfall, 'til the first spring of the light
As the mayhem fills the night
