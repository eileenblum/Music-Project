[Music: Landin, Lyrics: Landin, Mellstrom]

Blue eyes entangled me, but not any more
A light had faded, the chill burns to the core
Just cause I killed you doesn't mean I don't care
Somehow your burden was to heavy to bear

And the shadows of our lives will fade away

[Chorus:]
On icy plains, we'll walk
with bloodstains on our hands
the gate is closed, and there is no turning back

Killed you at nightfall with the moon on the rise
On darkened paths, I've got my blood turned to ice
Righteous was I, no guilt here to find
Vanish from me vile man, your time's running out

[Chorus:]
Over sea and land
on icy plains, we'll walk
with bloodstains on our hands
the gate is closed, and there is no turning back

I have now lost the only one, I am helpless now
I have now closed the only door, out of insanity

I search for a salvation, to rescue my mind
evade all of damnation, but nothing do I find
I feel that I'm losing my powers, they're fading away
This magnificant world of ours,
I'll try to blast it's sorry ass to hell.
