[Music: Willstedt, Mellstrom, Lyrics: Willstedt]

Truth, mysteries of darkness
buried in the shadows of the my life
Still, hatred inside me
Will I ever find a way to die?

[Chorus:]
Years of sleepless nights, insomnia
Didn't help me fear this unknown foe
I had seen it all, the end of my lifetime
Only echoes of the Nightmare remains

Dead, frozen in this moment
A path to death infecting dreams of life
Lost, haunted by this vision
A circle ending with my death

[Chorus:]
Years of sleepless nights, insomnia
Didn't help me fear this unknown foe
I had seen it all, the end of my lifetime
Only echoes of the Nightmare remains
