[Music: Landin, Lyrics: Willstedt, Petersson]

Rise under moonlight, a mind to weak to trust
A beast torn apart in the morning rain
Heart corrupt by darkness, still he's searching answers
Bring your steel and join the wicked ceremony

[Chorus:]
Now come gather all around, by damnation we are bound
I'm feasting like a vulture til the moon is going down
Now the ground is coloured red, a sign for the mislead
A new order lies ahead

A path near it's ending, some answers still untold
The questions are vital to reach the goal
My quest now completed, my foes all defeated
All come join the circle in the ceremony

[Chorus:]
Now come gather all around, by damnation we are bound
I'm feasting like a vulture til the moon is going down
Now the ground is coloured red, a sign for the mislead
A new order lies ahead
