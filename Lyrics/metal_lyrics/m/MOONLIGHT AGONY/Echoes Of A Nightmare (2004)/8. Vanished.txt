[Music: Landin, Lyrics: Landin]

Now I am finally there
this is the moment of truth
Blood from their veins on my arms
taste of their fear in my mouth

All preparations are done
conversion is ready to start

This is the time when the fruits
of my work will reveal themselves
where are you, childs o'mine?

Why is the world still the same
Nothing, yet something has changed
I'm human of flesh and of bones
A god am I not, just a man

Have I been fooled to believe
I had powers beyond my reach,
it cannot be that way.

The night has transformed into day
awareness ascending to life
The darkness is fading away
The shadows are falling behind me

[Chorus:]
Vanished is my dark companion
I'm free from his will and imprisonment
gone now is my shallow sanity
vanished half my soul

[CHORUS]
Vanished is my dark companion
I'm free from his will and imprisonment
gone now is my shallow sanity
vanished half my soul

All was in vain, all was air
A fiction, but real in my mind
What monster have lived inside me?
How could I let this beast come loose.

How can I repay the victims
that suffered my lunacy,
please tell me how shall I?

Is there a price for all crimes?
A sentence for every sin?
I see only one path ahead
from ashes and into the fire

[Chorus:]
Vanished is my dark companion
I'm free from his will and imprisonment
gone now is my shallow sanity
vanished half my soul
Nothing can ever redeem my deeds
There is no way for absolution
Only one way to reach peace of mind
Vanished is my soul
