[Music: Landin, Lyrics: Landin / Willstedt]

Roaming the docks, this moment I've dreamt of all my life
Oceans roaring my name, this is my fate
Weigh anchor, set sail
The ship soon embarks, the harbour fades
Soon we're under attack, pirates by our side

They are merciless, I must flee from this chaos to live
I shall seek revenge, they all must die

In the night, the thunderous sounds
Of my dreams blowing up in the air.
The last image I see
Is the ship with the blood red sails

Floating ashore, I wake as the sunlight burns my neck
Marooned, deserted am I. This island is my cage
Days turn to weeks
The fires I light are pointless
No one comes to my aid, seasons come and go

But one autumn day, as I sit in the sunset alone
There, a ship appears in the distant sea

In the night, the thunderous sounds
Of my dreams blowing up in the air.
The last image I see
Is the ship with the blood red sails

In the night, the thunderous sounds
Of my dreams blowing up in the air.
The last image I see
Is the ship with the blood red sails

In the night, the thunderous sounds
Of my dreams blowing up in the air.
Five years, imprisoned I've been
At last they will take me away

In the night, the thunderous sounds
Of my dreams blowing up in the air.
In fear, I suddenly see
It's the ship with the blood red sails

In the night, the thunderous sounds
Of my dreams blowing up in the air.
The last image I see
Is the ship with the blood red sails
