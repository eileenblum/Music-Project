[Music: Landin / MellstrÃ¶m, Lyrics: Landin / Willstedt]

Carrier of my charging minions
You should stand by my side
You've proven yourself worthy at many occasions
Holding hard on my line

You betrayed me when I needed you the most
Never have I ever let you down
Forcing me to face this shameful scene alone
Pathetic little useless worm

How dare you to defy my orders?
Hold the lines and advance
A stab in the back you spineless deserter
Hiding safe in your cave

You betrayed me when I needed you the most
Never have I ever let you down
Forcing me to face this shameful scene alone
Pathetic little useless worm

Victorious and as one
Together our armies shall storm the dark ravines
United and side by side
I gave you my blood but with empty hands I stand

Victorious and as one
Together our armies shall storm the dark ravines
United and side by side
I gave you my blood but with empty hands I stand

[Guest solo: Kristian Niemann]

You betrayed me when I needed you the most
Never have I ever let you down
Forcing me to face this shameful scene alone
Pathetic little useless worm
