[Music: Willstedt / Landin / MellstrÃ¶m, Lyrics: Willstedt]

[Solo: Peson]

Stuck in isolation
From the bottom I must rise

What went wrong, what could I've done?
I was blinded by my self-contempt

Leaving this world, leaving everything I ever knew
There was love and hatred, joy and sorrow, but always pain
Leaving solitude, restrain my inner fear, my only choice

Lost like a stray dog
Who shall guide me on my path?

No one else but me
Now I take the step, what have I to lose?

Leaving this world, leaving everything I ever knew
There was love and hatred, joy and sorrow, but always pain
Leaving solitude, restrain my inner fear, my only choice

[Solo: Landin / MellstrÃ¶m]

Leaving this world, leaving everything I ever knew
There was love and hatred, joy and sorrow, but always pain
Leaving this world, leaving everything I ever knew
There was love and hatred, joy and sorrow, but always pain
Leaving solitude, restrain my inner fear, my only choice

[Solo: Peson]
