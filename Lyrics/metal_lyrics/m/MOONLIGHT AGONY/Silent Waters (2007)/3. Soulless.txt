[Music: Landin / Willstedt / MellstrÃ¶m, Lyrics: Ãkesson]

It's the outcome of vile seduction
There's a shadow that looms over me
So desire has sealed my future
I'm Mephisto's slave

Consuming me
And it burns inside
And insanity feels this way

In a world where wisdom is power
I'm constantly searching for more
In my efforts to reach perfection
I have sold my soul

Insanity, burns in me
Pay the price you offered
Soulless

The inferno of the underworld
Dominions where darkness rules
The million minions of Beelzebub
Consuming me from within

Now my spirit is doomed to submission
By a covenant that's signed with my blood
Sold out for earthly pleasures
In the end enslaved

Insanity feels this way
Soulless

The inferno of the underworld
Dominions where darkness rules
The million minions of Beelzebub
Consuming me from within

[Solo: Peson]

The inferno of the underworld
Dominions where darkness rules
The million minions of Beelzebub
Consuming me from within
