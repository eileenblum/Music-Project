[Music: Landin / MellstrÃ¶m, Lyrics: Ãkesson / Landin]

The skies have darkened over me
This is my final chapter
Never knew that I would feel this way
Facing the end of it all

But still I breathe, and still I feel
You must encourage me
One last goodbye, one teardrop falls
Now hear me calling

The ending draws near
Yet the final page remains
Come, join my side
Until Kronos takes his toll, I'm alive

No inhibitions keep me down
I'm leaving this pain and suffering
Head on a journey through the lands
Alive more than ever

[Solo: Landin]

The ending draws near
Yet the final page remains
Come, join my side
Until Kronos takes his toll, I'm alive

On distant shores, the evening sun
Embrace my tired limbs.
One final breath, I leave this world
Ashes to ashes

The ending draws near
Yet the final page remains
Come, join my side
Until Kronos takes his toll, I'm alive

The ending draws near
Yet the final page remains
Come, join my side
Until Kronos takes his toll, I'm alive
