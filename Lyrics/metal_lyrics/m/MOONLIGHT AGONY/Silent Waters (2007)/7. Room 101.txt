[Music: Willstedt, Lyrics: Willstedt / Ãkesson]

Trapped in this misery
There's no escape, no hope

They've clouded our minds
Controlling our thoughts
What have we become, what?

Somber walls surrounding me
In room 101 I face my fear

Sold out my only love
My life is useless now

They govern our lives
Controlling our thoughts
What have we become, what?

Somber walls surrounding me
In room 101 I face my fear

[Solo: Peson]

Somber walls surrounding me
In room 101 I face my fear
He is my shepherd and my emperor.
In room 101 my story ends
