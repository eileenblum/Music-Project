[Music: Landin, Lyrics: Landin]

[Solo: Landin]

For twenty thousand years
The search for answers has been on
And some have come to think that they have found one

They're convinced that their religion is the one
Possessing all the answers and everyone else has failed

Humble priests why are you the chosen ones?
Can it be true that the rest is doomed?
Are we unrighteous, all of us that are not enlightened?
What is the price I must pay for that bliss?

I will never regret my view of life
It's impossible to choose

Don't you come to me and tell me that you know
So have many done and all of them tell different stories
Mortals how are we supposed to choose?
If there's thousand gods
What separates the right from all the other ones?

Marduk and Ra
The ancient gods from dawn of man
Who pays respect to them? Neglected superstition

What's different now? Is everything not just the same?
Though everything progress gods still haunt us

Don't you come to me and tell me that you know
So have many done and all of them tell different stories
Mortals how are we supposed to choose?
If there's thousand gods
What separates the right from all the other ones?

It is my claim, my belief, that we cannot know
Many are those who are greater than I
Still they don't seem to agree and it puzzles me
Shouldn't the wise admit to one faith?

Don't you come to me and tell me that you know
So have many done and all of them tell different stories
Mortals how are we supposed to choose?
If there's thousand gods
What separates the right from all the other ones?

For twenty thousand years
The search for answers has been on
And I have come to find that we are let down and left alone
