[Music: Willstedt, Lyrics: Willstedt]

Burning my skin I can't go on, the end is near.
Sand is my hearse, vultures circle the sky

On dunes in the distance silhouettes of saviours rise
From this hell triumph comes
Sargon lead us

Through the desert storm we will ride our way to the Pharao
We shall claim their throne
Egypt fear the dawn

Hooves shake the earth as we ride, no return
Glorious we'll stand when the night turns to day

In the horizon tombs of the kings appear
Chariots, lead the way
Legions charge!

Through the desert storm we will ride our way to the Pharao
We shall claim their throne
Egypt fear the dawn
Through the desert storm we will ride our way to the Pharao
We shall claim their throne
Egypt fear the dawn

[Solo: Landin]

War rages on, spare no soul
The Nile is red

Triumph and victory, battlefields lay desolate
Fallen is Pharao
A new king rises

Through the desert storm we will ride our way to the Pharao
We shall claim their throne
Egypt fear the dawn
Through the desert storm we will ride our way to the Pharao
We shall claim their throne
Egypt fear the dawn
