[Music: MellstrÃ¶m / Willstedt / Landin, Lyrics: Willstedt / Ãkesson]

[Solo: Peson]

Unity fades, look at the world
We are divided
The ancient laws possessing us
Blackened horizon

A blood red sunrise and all hope is lost
Vast dominions of evil

Divinity justify war
Hell breaking loose

When the chaos ends and all is over
There will be no one to save our souls
From the ashes rise a new world order
Pain and misery, the dark era rise

[Solo: MellstrÃ¶m]

When the chaos ends and all is over
There will be no one to save our souls
From the ashes rise a new world order
Pain and misery, the dark era rise

Living by words taught by a man
Dead for millennias
Oh, can't you see how it will end?
Total devastation

A blood red sunrise and all hope is lost
Vast dominions of evil

When the chaos ends and all is over
There will be no one to save our souls
From the ashes rise a new world order
Pain and misery, the dark era rise

[Solo: Peson]
