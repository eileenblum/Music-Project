[Music: Peson / Landin / Willstedt, Lyrics: Willstedt / Landin]

From outside I hear the grim cold sea
In this abyss we've descended

[Solo: Peson]

No one answers our desperate calls
800 feet below surface

We're trapped inside for weeks for months for years
Set us free

Where no daylight reach we're marooned in solemn waters
Losing track of time, everlasting night
Have no memories of the world outside this prison
Steel that shielded us is our tomb

The air ran out so many years ago
There is no way we're alive

Still we go on, walking dead we are
Set us free

Where no daylight reach we're marooned in solemn waters
Losing track of time, everlasting night
Have no memories of the world outside this prison
Steel that shielded us is our tomb

Where have you gone?
I can't move on until I know
Lost, left me here
Alone... Alone

[Solo: Peson]

Where no daylight reach we're marooned in solemn waters
Losing track of time, everlasting night
Have no memories of the world outside this prison
Steel that shielded us is our tomb
