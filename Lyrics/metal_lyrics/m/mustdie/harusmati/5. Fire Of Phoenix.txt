This fire has burned my soul
I cried in a breathless dead
A fire storm of birds in the strands
Penetrate into the body to destroy

Right now has held
The spirit of burning now
Right now has held
The spirit of burning now
Right now has held
In the soul of the dead

This death, saw the fire in the hand,
Spread within the chest, feeling it burn!
Tired of this, immerse the soul, into the fire
Blind eyes of the heart!

I could not move.can not speak well
Ill crawl trail still tied to a burning fire
I could not move.can not speak well
Ill crawl trail still tied to a burning

Threat of an overwhelming and destroy
Threat of an overwhelming and destroy

I can not get anything do know what happened
Just feel the beat hard in the chest
I can not get anything do know what happened
Just feel the beat hard in the chest

Darkness is now burning like
This death, saw the fire in the hand
This death, saw the fire in the hand
Spread feeling it burn

This fire has burned my soul
I cried in a breathless is dead
A fire storm of birds in the strands
Penetrate into the body to destroy

Darkness is now burning like
This death, saw the fire in the hand
The spirit of burning now
This death... this death...

This darkness is now burning lie
This darkness is now burning lie

This fire has burned my soul
I cried in a breathless is dead
A fire storm of birds in the strands
This darkness is now burning like

This darkness is now burning like
This darkness is now burning like

Is now burning like!
