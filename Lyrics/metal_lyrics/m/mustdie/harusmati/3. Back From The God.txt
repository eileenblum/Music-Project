Now ..
In mortality / Tying on religion
And norms of the life of the world
In mortality / Tying on religion
And norms of the life of the world

Through global igno-rance / Without forgiveness
There everywhere / Rule the world
Through global igno-rance / Without forgiveness
There everywhere / Rule the world

Justify his return
Waiting for the evil come here
Slaughtered to death
Against the forces of the evil
Dreams and the illumination

He rise from triangle
Seeing with the eyes of wild
Creating replica of heaven to hell
Ensnare the people by deception

Looking for people
Neglect to strategy
Hurt accompany die

And was a spear at a gate
With any sense of dead eyes cry

He rise from the triangle
Seeing with the eyes of wild
Creating replica of heaven to hell
Ensnare the peopleb deception

Hell open for him
And all for his people
Your hell for your world
My hell for you forever
Hell open for him
No fall now over

Hell open for him
And all for his people
Your hell for your world
My hell for you forever
Hell open for him
And all for his people
Your hell for your world
My hell for you forever

Now
In mortality / Tying on religion
And norms of the life of the world
In mortality / Tying on religion
And norms of the life of the world

Back from the gods
Justify his return
Waiting for the evil come here
Slaughtered to death
