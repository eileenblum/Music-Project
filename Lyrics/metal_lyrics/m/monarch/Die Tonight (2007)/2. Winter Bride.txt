You've left me here alone, Me, your bride to be,
You've left me for that harlot,
You've left me for the sea
You, my one and only. my always and forever,
Without You there is no tomorrow,
I can wait no longer
You've left me here alone, Me, your bride to be,
You've left the winter in my heart,
You've left the cold take hold of me,
May You live in terror and die in horror,
Smothered in your wenches arms,
Embrace the wretched curse dripping from these veins,
That pours from this black heart,
That marks the crimson letter on she
That make you part
