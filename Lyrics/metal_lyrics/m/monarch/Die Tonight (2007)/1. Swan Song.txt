Nothing separates the sea from the heavens
from the vesperal depths below,
On deck no one is dancing yet the orchestra plays on,
A subtle death-hymn, they play their last song,
A final song to sooth the soul,
A few last notes played in tears,
A final song to ease the pain,
A few last notes as we sink in fear,
With the dying lights last spark,
Commotion hits like chaos bewitched,
Abandoned in darkness,
A great wave of desperation overcomes the frantic mass, amidst the reigning pandemonium,
No melody can be heard, the orchestra therefore decides to lay their instruments to rest and opt for the sea soothing silence
For no one can drown out 1000 dying screams
