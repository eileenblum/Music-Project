Sailorman, please take my hand
For a great wind has been sent upon the sea
Oh sailorman, come take my hand
Your sole salvation lies deep with me
These clear blue eyes have seen far too many men perish
Have you ever wondered why the sea tastes so much like tears?
Sailorman, please take my hand
Oh tender sailorman
Hold on to my love
