Listen to the sea
Listen oh so carefully
She speaks not in tongue but in song
Hear her harmony
Listen to the sea
Listen carefully
The turbulent tide that we ride is a song of battle
Sing with her today and be heard yet tomorrow
You will live on in song for melody is immortal
Sailing over a sea of flames
Onward towards a sea of blood
We sing the song of battle
We sing the song forever
We are the musicmakers
We sing the song of battle
We sing the song of steel
Such is the thunder of our call
We are the musicmakers
We sing the song of glory
The eagles will feast voraciously tonight
