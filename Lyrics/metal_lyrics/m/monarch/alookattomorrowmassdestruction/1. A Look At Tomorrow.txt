[Discharge Cover]

I look out my window to a blinding bright light
Enola passes passes by
Tomorrow tomorrow
A look at tomorrow
Hysterical men women and children
Run in search of their families
I look out of my window to a blinding bright light
Enola passes passes by
Skin is shed like that of snakes
But it's not the work of mother nature
Tomorrow, tomorrow, a look at
tomorrow
