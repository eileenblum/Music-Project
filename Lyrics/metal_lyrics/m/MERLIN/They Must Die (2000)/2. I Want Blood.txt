Let me introduce myself
They call me Doctor Death
A scalpel is all that I have
I wanna see you die, that's all that I need
It satisfies me to let you scream and bleed

Your blood is my wine, your body is my bread
Your pain is my fee, your fear makes me glad
Your life's energy is running through my veins
Fills me with incredible power, such a pretty gain

I want blood, that's all I need
I want blood, it's my destiny
Want blood, that's why I kill
I want blood...

Doctor Death wants blood
And you'd better hide away
Never turn your back on me
I'll attack, don't you know that?!

I was supposed to kill just before my birth
Smell of rotten and decease
A mass of flesh and bones
Deadly silence of the crypt
Spots of clotted blood
That's the dream I used to see as an infant

Wanna see your throat and belly
Torn Apart. Slime and blood and fear
Just what I need

I want blood, that's all I need
I want blood, it's my destiny
Want blood, that's why I kill
I want blood...

Doctor Death wants...
Blood
