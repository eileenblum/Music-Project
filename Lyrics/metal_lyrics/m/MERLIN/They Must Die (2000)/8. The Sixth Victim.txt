The full moon
It's the sixth full moon
It's the final full moon
Before all of my life has been changed at once
The high knowledge must be the price
All alone, I am standing here
Feel like doing the final job
I'm exited, I'm almost dead
Standing forward to sacrifice

Where is she
I can't wait too long
It's about time, she approached
Oh my god, I can't wait so long
Expectation drives me mad

I'm in a panic, I don't know what I should do
If she doesn't come, I'll get lost
I'll be into misery
Provided I kill the six

My sixth victim
I'm pleading you to come
Please don't break my plans you bitch
Listen, I'm not kidding
That's the business of my life
I need your experience

I must love you
Then I'll kill you
Then I will crack your skull
I don't want to hurt you baby
But I must eat your brain

You'll revive

The experience of the six
Will revive inside my head
What a power, what a strength
The reunion of their spirits
All of them inside my brain and soul
That's what I dream about

The full moon
It's the sixth full moon
It's the final full moon
Before all of my life has been changed at once
The high knowledge must be the price
All alone, I am standing here
Feel like doing the final job
I'm exited, I'm almost dead
Standing forward to sacrifice

The business of my life
The knowledge of the six
The mystery of gods
I must be kept into the mystery
