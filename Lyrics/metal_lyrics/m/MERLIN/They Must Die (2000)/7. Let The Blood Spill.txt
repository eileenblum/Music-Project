Looking at the burning sky
I couldn't believe my eyes
I don't know if it was true
Rain of blood, smoke and fear
Destruction and disgrace
Utter desolation
Forces from the emptiness
Spreading seeds of hate
Picking crops of malice
Executioners and fools
Doing their job
Killing without warning

Voices from the emptiness
Scream the words of white lie
Holy war justify

Hey warrior you're blessed
Sacrifice your life
And you are a saint

Grind your knife, realize your hate
Never hesitate
Holy war, it's time to kill
Let the blood spill

Heaven is waiting son
Waiting for their heads
cast aside any doubts, you're right
Kill all the enemies
Kill your brother and son

ï¿½Twas the sign of death that I saw
ï¿½Twas the voice of death that I heard
ï¿½Twas the touch of death that I felt
ï¿½Twas the wind

Looking at the burning sky
I couldn't believe my eyes
I don't know if it was true
Rain of blood, smoke and fear
Destruction and disgrace
Utter desolation
Forces from the emptiness
Spreading seeds of hate
Picking crops of malice
Executioners and fools
Doing their job
Killing without warning

Holy war, it's time to kill
Holy war, Let the blood spill
Holy war, justify your sins
Holy war...

Grind your knife, realize your hate
Never hesitate
Holy war, it's time to kill
Let the blood spill

Let the blood spill
