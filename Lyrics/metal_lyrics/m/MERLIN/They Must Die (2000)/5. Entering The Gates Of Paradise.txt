Hear what I say
God loves you and you must die
Ritual suicide is the path to heaven

Take a step
The final step in your life of before
Entering The Gates of Paradise

Don't hesitate
Don't break his trust you see

Jesus loves you
You'll fly as an angel in the sky
You see...
Dying for sacrifice
You just make his will
So jump down

These last days
I've heard some voices from the outside
Calling me to join the chosen and saints
Visions of a distant kingdom driving me mad
Corroding my brain and soul, I'm so tired
I'm scared, I'm going home

Looking down
I see an abyss
Just before my eyes
Attracting me

I don't know if I should have
I'm going insane

That's the fall
That becomes the greatest climb
Just a step and you'll fly
As an angel in the sky

Don't hesitate
Don't break his trust you see
Ritual suicide is the path to heaven
Don't break his trust
Die for sacrifice
Visions of a distant kingdom
Driving me mad, attracting me

These last days
I've heard some voices from the outside
Calling me to join the chosen and saints
Just a step
I'm gonna do as I'm told
I don't want to break his trust
I must leave, leave this realm of the damned
