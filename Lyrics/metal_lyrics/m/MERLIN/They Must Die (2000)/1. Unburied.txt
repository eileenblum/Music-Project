They were killed very long ago
Their lifeless bodies lied unburied
Mutilated and decayed
Torn apart by animals and tortured

Their mouths open wide
Empty eyes of theirs staring at the sky
And seeing nothing
Their hands snatching at the emptiness

They've lied for years
Parched by the sun
Covered by snow
Standing heat and cold
They're not alive
And they're not dead
Their souls have been lost

They have stayed between the worlds

They vanished from this place
But they've never known another life
Suffering forgotten shades
Screaming silently, unknown and nameless

Nameless heroes
Prisoners of darkness
Regards and fame
Will never find them
