I will send forth my terror before you,
And I will throw people into panic among those who came,
And I will make all your enemies turn tale before you...
I will drive them out before you, little by little
Until you have increased and possessed the land

Three hundred years of slavery
Three hundred years of pain, humiliation and torture
Three hundred years of violence and suffering

It's time to pay the cost
I'll stop them ï¿½cause I'm a hand of god

I feel like taking revenge
It must be so sweet
In the name of god, I'll kill I swear
My mission's heavy, I must set my people free
That's my destiny

I am a hand of god
His punishing sword
I'm gonna burn this land to ashes
Sinner cry
No way to hide
Innocent you'll be saved
Don't worry, yeah
I'm a defender of the faith, they must die
They all must die

Gonna rub them out
Let the bastards die
That's my heavy duty
Final sacrifice

I'm gonna burn this source of infection to ashes

They all must die

Three hundred years of slavery

They all
Must die
They all must die...
