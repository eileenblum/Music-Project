You abuse of our attention
Talking nonsense endlessly
You pretend and mesmerize us
They applaud in ecstasy
Empty words so nice and clear
Striking as the words of god
They take at all its value
All this bullshit learnt by heart

They think you're a fighter
Savior and defender
Empty words are so sweet

That will just disappear
I got tired of you show
There's no point trying to twist me
Round your finger anymore
Wish you'd leave with all this riff-ruff
All these drunkards, rouges and fools
For some desert island
Such a pretty place to rule

Miserable poser
You're an idol talker
You don't waste my time

Don't waste my time

Shut up and get away
You've got nothing more to say
It's not worth continuing the play

Stop this fucking show
You stop stringing me along
Listen man you really should go

Listen man
You'd better get away
Don't try to dupe me buddy
It's a waste of time

Don't waste my time

Stop this fucking show
You stop stringing me along
Listen man you really should go

You don't waste my time...
