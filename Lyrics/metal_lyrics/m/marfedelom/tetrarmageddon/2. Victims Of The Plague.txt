We are here in our own land
Desecrated by nature
And even our bastards are
Victims of the plague

The coughing never ends
Our state is critical
My head is going to explode
Nothing can stop the pain

Not a parasite or virus
What afflict us transcends the body
There's no common treatment
No common Medicine

The fever burns even the mind

March! March to your grave
We will be dead
Before the sun rises

Rise! Rise from your beds
Go meet your ends
Don't let your freedom go down

March! March to your grave
We will be dead
Before the sun rises

Rise! Rise from your beds
Go meet your ends
Don't let your freedom go down

March!
Rise!
Don't be another one!

War with an invisible force
Not even fire can give us an advantage
To confront this menace
To cleanse our bodies and souls
Of the toxic guest that destroys
Of the toxic guest that roams

You're here looking for treatment
But you will perish
You will fall

You will Perish
You will fall

You're here looking for treatment
But you will perish
You will fall

You will Perish
You will fall
