The time has come
Time to fulfill the cycle
TetrArmageddon
The final step

Fire coming from above
And fire coming from below
Forces far stronger than everything we know
We're into the firestorm
Fire, Firestorm

The gods are cowering and spirits were the first to run
Nothing escapes the fiery wrath of the storm
Blazing purity purging all in it's path
Everything that we know is coming to an end

The light that burns
Obliteration is coming at us
Burning fire tearing my skin
I cannot think and of course I cannot act
Hypnotized

The light that glows
Blinding flash, under the sea
Above of the stars
The light burns

Fire

Grief no more or mourn it
All our greed reverted
Onto our breed and to the old

Fire coming from above
And fire coming from below
Forces far stronger than everything we know
We're into the firestorm
Fire, Firestorm

Oh firestorm
We're into the firestorm
And tonight we'll die
