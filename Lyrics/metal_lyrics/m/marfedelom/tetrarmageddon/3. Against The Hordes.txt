The horde approaches
And here I am alone
Weapons in hand
To face true horror and blood

The land was blighted
Blackness has swallowed the minds
The minds of earthlings
Both animals and human beings

The horde approaches
And I am here
Waiting bold it's arrival
I will fight to stop it or at least I will try to defend

Behind me is another horde
The ones that have their eyes closed
Those are not the undead
I call them the living dead

No motivation
No goal to achieve
Their machines control them
They are all the same

They are reflections
Of their own shadows
And as much sense these words are making to you
Their world makes sense to me
Here comes the gloom
Here comes the carnage
And soon we will be one with the dust
And soon we will be one with the dust

The horde approaches
And I am here
Waiting bold it's arrival
I will fight to stop it or at least I will try to defend

Behind me is another horde
The ones that have their eyes closed
Those are not the undead
I call them the living dead

I will kill
I will die
But I'll send them back to the stone

I will kill
I will fight
I will tear them limb by limb

I will kill
I will die
But I'll send you back to the stone

I will kill
I will fight
And for sure I will fall here
