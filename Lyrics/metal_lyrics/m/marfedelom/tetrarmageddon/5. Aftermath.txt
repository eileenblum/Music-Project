I felt the thrashing
I survived the sickness
I endured the piercing bites
I suffered the burning heat

I felt the thrashing
I survived the sickness
I endured the piercing bites
I suffered the burning heat

Why am I alive?
I should be dead
Why I still feel
The breeze on my face?

The sky crimson red
No water to drink
The land is so dry
And I cannot breath

I don't enjoy heaven
I don't suffer hell
Is this purgatory?
Or everything is fake?

The tales I have heard
Are nothing like this
It was supposed
Nothing was going to be spared

I felt the chaos of the crumbling nature
Felt the pain that death can cause
I survived the ravaging of human flesh
Survived what destroyed all free will

I endured the consequences of stupidity
Endured the destruction mankind provoked
I suffered the implosion of reality
Suffered total disintegration

Why am I alive?
I should be dead
Why I still feel
The breeze on my face?

The sky crimson red
No water to drink
The land is so dry
And I cannot breath

I don't enjoy heaven
I don't suffer hell
Is this purgatory?
Or everything's fake?

The tales I have heard
Are nothing like this
It was supposed
Nothing was going to be spared

I cannot see a soul
There's silence everywhere
I cannot touch myself
Did I become a ghost?

The world has ended
Or has begun?
I don't even know
What's going on

I cannot see a soul
There's silence everywhere
I cannot touch myself
Did I become a ghost?

The world has ended
Or has begun?
I don't even know
What is going on

There is nothing above
There is nothing below
There is nothing left or right

I felt the chaos of the crumbling nature
Felt the pain that death can cause
I survived the ravaging of human flesh
Survived what destroyed all free will

I endured the consequences of stupidity
Endured destruction mankind provoked
I suffered the implosion of reality
Suffered total disintegration

Why am I alive?
I should be dead
Why I still feel
The breeze on my face?

The sky crimson red
No water to drink
The land is so dry
And I cannot breath

I don't enjoy heaven
I don't suffer hell
Is this purgatory?
Or everything's fake?

The tales I have heard
Are nothing like this
It was supposed
Nothing was going to be spared

Chaos Reborn
