Nothing can stop it
The madness unleashed
By our own doing
We called a Planetary Downfall

Gaia's power always magnificent
Nowhere to run we will die embraced
Our home demise finally has started
Mankind suffer all what you provoked

Gloom

I blasphemed against Earth
And I will never take it back
Land polluted
By the hate of man and his pride

Tampling over the philosophy
That we're just cells in the great organism
We just maimed the body
That will sustain our lifeform

Bloody murder has become the earth
Nothing escapes from her crimson clutch
To kill who gave us life
To blame who gave us all
Now we are suffering
The consequences of our foul acts

Buffeted by the tempest
Enveloped by the pit
Drowning in life giver
Consumed by the fire

Gaia's power always magnificent
Nowhere to run we will die embraced
Our home demise finally has started
Mankind suffer all what you provoked

I will leave from this realm
And nothing will take me back
War foul rule
And the past that stains all black

Tampling over the philosophy
That we're born free and free we should die
The brutal desires
That brought the earth to climax and to die

Planetary Downfall
