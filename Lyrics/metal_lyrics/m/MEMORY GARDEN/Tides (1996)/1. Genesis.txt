I'm the ruler of time
And I'm the creator of life
Because I am the dominator and faith
Condemned by me thou who are immortal
Lights of life, darkness of death
I am your judge
The emperor - a king

I am the ruler of everything

I paint the world with dreams and illusions
You are my puppet on a string so fragile 
I watch and demand
The emperor - a king

I will be eternal
When you've been dead and gone
I fool a new believer
A new dimension to your life

I am the ruler of everything
The master of all
