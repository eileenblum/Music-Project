Welcome to a wierd place called life
A godforsaken place for beggar man and thieves
Face to face with your own horror and frustration
Followed by expectations of fortune

Swallow your pride, humiliation continues
Stabb or be stabbed, you chose or you lose
Friend or enemy is there a difference
Feed the fire of envy to success

A new dawn, a new place
A new world in our own pace
A new dawn, a new place
A new world in our own pace

Play your own part in this tragic comedy
Chocked by your own life, your act
Climb the ladder , touch of heaven, be a God
Look in the mirror, face your nemesis
Erase me by myself, a favour to me

A new dawn, a new place
A new world in our own pace
A new dawn, a new place
A new world in our own pace
