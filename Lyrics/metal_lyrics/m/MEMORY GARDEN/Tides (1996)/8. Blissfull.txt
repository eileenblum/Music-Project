Drifting away, embraced by silvery veils of grey
Something grasps my senses and gently strokes my face
Prayers got granted, at last detatched from all despair, all the past
The lewd life I led, all the blood I shed
My mortal remains soon wilted and decomposed
Where am I now and who is my host?

Overwhelmed by such perfect beauty
Wrapped up in fathomless harmony
I close my eyes, no need to see, as nature is
Delivering me 
I close my eyes, no need to see as nature is
Delivering me
