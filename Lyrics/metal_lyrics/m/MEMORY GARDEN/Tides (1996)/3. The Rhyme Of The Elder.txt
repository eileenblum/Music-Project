Leave me alone
Between my walls of stone
I would travel away from me
Trapped in a jar - can't get free

Goodbye and don't you ever follow
Another day goes by, a mist in grey so shallow
So safe in the youth
Grow older and get the bitter taste in your mouth

Life, oh life, where did you fly?
Were my dreams all set to high?
Life, oh life, where did you fly?
Were my dreams all set to high?

Light of the so treasured life
The curtain of youth will fall
And now enter this sleeping old hall
Where time is a carving sharp knife

For so long I've been awake
Hopefully death won't forsake
And lay my wining body to sleep
A quire will cradle me deep

Life, oh life, where did you fly?
Were my dreams all set to high?
Life, oh life, where did you fly?
Were my dreams all set to high?
All set to high, all set to high?
