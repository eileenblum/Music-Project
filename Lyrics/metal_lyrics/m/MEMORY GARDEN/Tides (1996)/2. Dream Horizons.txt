Rest your head and close your eyes
When the dream starts your problems fly
Like a never ending floating stream
You await the exciting dream

To a world of wishes and horrors
Where laughter can turn to sorrows

When the light of the night
Can be so warm and bright
It might be drenched in red
When you wake you wish you were dead

Strangled in a solid iron chain
A harvest of a burning pain

Some of us will slowly awake
Some will the grim reaper take
A kingdom where we'll travel to lay
But a few will eternally stay

Drowning in my own dreams
Beyond the wall of realms
In this alley of shadows
Where it ends no one knows

A place where everything is in unison
You know wisdom better than none
A blue sky and the magic sunlight
Can turn to suffering and everlasting night

Sail with those silent winds
Towards where no one loses, no one wins

A stream of light in my veins
A vision for hell but so in pain
A room full of strangers but I'm alone
Second by second, life's alone

Some of us will slowly awake
Some will the grim reaper take
A kingdom where we'll travel to lay
But a few will eternally stay
