I've seen the sun set
And transform into the eastern moon
I believe the river of nile will flood real soon
A plague will strongly dominate
Where the curses and misery participates

This claustrophobic moisty air
Makes me shiver in despair
I'm lost, I'm buried alive
I'm searching - I will strive

Arriving to the valley of the kings
Guarded by snakes - I fear their deadly sting

Your own body will come apart
The gods own created art
I hear their voices but they don't hear me
It's all in my mind driven by fear you'll see

Running down this hall of eternal mystery
Covered with webs and sweat
Halfway to insanity

I've seen the sun set
And transform into the eastern moon
I believe the river of nile will flood real soon
A plague will strongly dominate
Where the curses and misery participates

Arriving to the valley of the kings
Guarded by snakes - I fear their deadly sting
Arriving to the valley of the kings
