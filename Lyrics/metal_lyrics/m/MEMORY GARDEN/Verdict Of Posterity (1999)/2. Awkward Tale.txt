I know where it is but can't find the right way to it
Listening and watching all the time and reading the writ
Wrong me hard, can't think clearly enough to work
A step forward is a step closer to berserk

Tapestry of the truth makes me a wakeful weirdo
The first wedge in a solid foundation

Throw my head back, in a minute I will crack
The mirror never lies, a reflection shows me a wreck
A billowy feeling turns everything back to zero

Tapestry of the truth makes me a wakeful weirdo
The first wedge in a solid foundation

Our own personal jesus collects his ovation
This drunken frenzy broke into a beautiful, beautiful world
For the gathering to a gigantic herd

Tapestry of the truth makes me a wakeful weirdo
The first wedge in a solid foundation
Tapestry of the truth makes me a wakeful weirdo
The first wedge in a solid foundation
