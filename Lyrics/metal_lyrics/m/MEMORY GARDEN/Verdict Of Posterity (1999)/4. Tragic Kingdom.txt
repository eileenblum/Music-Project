[Words: A. LoostrÃ¶m Music: T. BjÃ¶rn, A. LoostrÃ¶m, S. Johansson, M. Wead]

Protected from the maze, the outside world
Empty eyes, distorted face
Without mental penetration from the wicked civilization

This isolated cold asylum an unforgiving salvation
She's a prodigy so very pure and delicate

Take her away to a place she can stay
Away from this gateway to madness

Turmoil feelings comes in random
A princess from the tragic kingdom
Given shelter from decline
Not a taste of life nor wine

Beyond all recognition, a piece a thing
The art of suffering
Today'll be yesterday tomorrow 
In this chamber of sorrow

Take her away to a place she can stay
Away from this gateway to madness
