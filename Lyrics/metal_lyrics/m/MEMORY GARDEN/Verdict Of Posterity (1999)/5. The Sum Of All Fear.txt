It's time to go to bed again
Another sleepless night in sweat and pain
I can't face it again and again
I hear them they are everywhere

A razor-blade on my wrist again
I would rather bleed to death than hear it
Another sleepless night
Seconds of waiting to exhale

Legions of the lost approaches again
Another sleepless night in sweat and pain

Convicted to fear night and hour
Where is my strenght where is my power
Twisting and turning for some peace of mind
At dawn I leave it all behind

Try to turn on the light but I can't move
The insomnia crushes me with it's massive weight
This distorted nights makes me wait and wait
For a new morning, a new sunrise

Legions of the lost approaches again
Another sleepless night in sweat and pain
My fear is here
