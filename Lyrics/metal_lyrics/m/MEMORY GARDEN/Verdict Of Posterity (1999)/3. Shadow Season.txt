[Words: A. LoostrÃ¶m Music: S. Johansson, A. LoostrÃ¶m]

It falls slowly in a gentle silver rain
Try to figure out, try to figure out
Touch the edge and go insane it will remain
Without a doubt, without a doubt

A handful of something demonic
Holds so very harrow
A gesture from the evil and twisted
An alley so narrow

It seems like something unusual
Figment of the imagination
Croon the harmony of the fall
Welcome satanic domination

A handful of something demonic
Holds so very harrow
A gesture from the evil and twisted
An alley so narrow
