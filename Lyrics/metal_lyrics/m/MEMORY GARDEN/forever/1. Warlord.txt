I am a northener
I love the cold north wind
Which carries my dragonship
To foreign land on foray

I am a mighty warrior
With blood and guts of a viking
With my sword and spear
I'll make the heretics suffer

To pacify the Gods
My oblation will be blood
To be recieved in Valhalla
I will die in battle

With our heads high
And muscles of iron
We fight side by side
With our swords raised
And no mercy to give
We see honour and victory

I deny I am a savage
Who plunders, rapes and kills
I'm just a faithful servant
Who pays tribute to the aesir belief

To pacify the Gods
My oblation will be blood
To be recieved in Valhalla
I will die in battle
