[Words: A. LoostrÃ¶m Music: A. LoostrÃ¶m, S. Johansson]

On the rough roads between the sun and the shade
Denunciation of denial, sketches of what to expect and await

Wake up it might be all too late
Convicted to wonder and drift in this game of damnation

Don't fight it just float away
Here's where the story ends
The river of sludge

Go home and lock the door, pull back the curtains
I am in my shed so safe
It's too late for spiritual awakening

Don't fight it just float away
Here's where the story ends
The river of sludge
