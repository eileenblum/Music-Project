[Words &amp; Music: T. BjÃ¶rn]

Crying eyes, they are mine
Unlike you, I believe I can feel
What have we come to?

Coexisting for what?
Everyday's an insult
Every action is an act of conceit

A dream made me strong inside
But you've torn it apart, and cast it all away

Trying to soothe my pain of loving in vain
What have you gained from your wicked reign
You have lived your life so self-occupied
My fatuity has passed me by

Your words are delivered with erosive spite
Eating my heart out
My blindness must end
I've been under this delusion for too long

It seems like we both will lose
I, my loveâ¦.you, your life

Trying to soothe my pain of loving in vain
What have you gained from your wicked reign
You have lived your life so self-occupied
My fatuity has passed me by

Now that you lay there dying
I'm devoured by great delight
You were never this warm and loving before
I like you better now
As I watch you fade before me
One last gasp, a frozen gaze
The only eyes that are crying now are yours, and yours alone
