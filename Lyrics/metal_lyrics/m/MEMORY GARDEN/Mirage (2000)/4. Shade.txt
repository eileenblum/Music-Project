[Words &amp; Music: T. BjÃ¶rn]

It knows no time, life or race
Terminates, leaves just an empty space
It rises high, black and shapeless
Falls low, smooth and soundless

All in it's way, will be gone like yesterday
Crawling faster, our disaster

Now it has come to take us there
To the place where we all beware
And who knows what it has to show
We'll figure it out from down below

Next in line, a sorrowed face
Swept away, end of chase
Another foolish desperate try
Keeps me asking the question, why?

Prayers are good, for lack of sense
The final stand, darkness so dense

Now it has come to take us there
To the place where we all beware
And who knows what it has to show
We'll figure it out from down below

Even though the sun might shine now
The shade will come and tuck you in
Even if your life's divine now, it too shall end

You're in denial, trying to turn away
But it will catch up on you someday
Maybe tomorrow or the next decade
But everyone will face eternal shade

Even though the sun might shine now
The shade will come and tuck you in
Even if your life's divine now it too shall end
