[Words: S. Berglund Music: T. BjÃ¶rn, A. LoostrÃ¶m, S. Berglund]

I am falling fast out of control
I hear the bells, for me they toll

Is this an illusion? Am I still asleep?
I enter this black crypt, a daze so deep

My aging body longs for sleep
Hallowed soil my coffin it shall keep

I've seen the thoughts in my childrens mind
Wondering why this must be the last goodbye

My aging body longs for sleep
Hallowed soil my coffin it shall keep
My aging body longs for sleep

Moist hallowed soil my coffin it shall keep
I'm back to where it all began
Back to where it all began
