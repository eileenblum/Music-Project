[Words &amp; Music: S. Johansson]

A broken picture, a broken mind
The colored life turns black and white
The remaining pieces won't tell you why
When questions gather it reveals a lie

Empty, meaningless
Cold, nothingness
At the end of life, ooh oh 

Erase reality, erase normality
The common life turns dark as night
Remember vaguely the loss of pride
Suddenly clearer, resistance dies

Empty, meaningless
Cold, nothingness
At the end of life, now beyond
