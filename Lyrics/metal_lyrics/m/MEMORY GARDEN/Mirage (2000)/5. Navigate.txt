[Words: A. LoostrÃ¶m, S. Berglund Music: S. Johansson]

I lower my head and long for peace of mind
Trying to sort out the old, to get a new start
To be alone won't resurrect me
I slip and there's nothing to grasp

I navigate my life trying to flee from the lies
The endless search is here, a step forward without fear

As time will come and pass
My bleeding wounds will heal
Like the angel lost and found
I have the grace of being complete

I navigate my life trying to flee from the lies
The endless search is here, a step forward without fear

So few rights, so many wrongs
I hate with silence, righteous silence

I navigate my life trying to flee from the lies
The endless search is here, a step forward without fear
