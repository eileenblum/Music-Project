Born out of happiness, a child so innocent
Crawled so blind into this world
From a young boy to a cynical man
Tried to deal with both pleasure and pain
Years passed by, winter by winter and fall by fall
Tears passed by, one by one and still they fall

I slowly awake, as dreams start to fade, and I clear my head
I rise from myself, so still
As I welcome the King of the Dead

The lust found in sorrow, the seeking of Gods
In memory scattered, betrayed by life's odds

An emptiness so deep, from all that was lost
Insignificance grew larger, life raised the costs

Denial fed weakness, it's food for the vile
Rest under dark skies and cry with a smile
