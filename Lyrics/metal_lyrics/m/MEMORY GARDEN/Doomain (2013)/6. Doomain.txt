There's no absolution for what you have done
A crime so horrendous, time after lime
You've taken advantage of the weak and bereaved
Now take a few minutes to repent
My justice descends

A riddle is given, your memories unlock
The fear that you feel was long ago mine
Been calling yourself a man of pure heart
Now what awaits you will perfectly tear you apart

Deep down in my doomain
You'll have your share of pain
Tangled in my reigns
In my bloodstained doomain

A syndicate of sin
Formed by the dark intentions of man
Dressed up in modesty
Your cold eyes reveal perversions grown too strong

I lead, you follow
We're dancing on glass
My chamber of reprisal
Won't let miscreants pass
