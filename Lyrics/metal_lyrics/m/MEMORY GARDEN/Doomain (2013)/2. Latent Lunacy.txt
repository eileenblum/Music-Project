Minute by minute
Everyone by himself
Step by cautious step
A sandpit-minefield hell

A strict hierarchy
None but one's law apply
Don't look, don't argue
Never ask the question why

Dread the night
Fear the dawn

Psychosis spread like a virus
Men reduced to beasts
The weakest turns to victim
Vultures come to feast
Manipulated minds
All dignity is lost
Just follow order through your holocaust

A blank expression
Dead eyes staring back
Too late to save yourself
Facade of innocence loudly cracks

Demons down
They all respawn

Given every chance
Wasting it all through hatred and pride
Spiralling down, to die away
The deepest pit of hell is where you'll reside
