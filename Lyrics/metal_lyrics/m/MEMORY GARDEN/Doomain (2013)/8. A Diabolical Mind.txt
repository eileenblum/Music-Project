Another trainload of pure despair
Serenaded by the finest waltz
Thousands shiver
Confusion and fear
Unworthy lives
Diminished to less than nothing

Diabolical mind
Visions so absurd
The angel of death makes every prayer unheard

The waves of misery hit your feet
Relish your task of selecting
Left or right
The white-gloved hand swing the cane of fate
Live another day, or die right away

Suffocating smoke rise to the sky
Trenches of fire consume them all
Some were spared, but only momentarily
Just to be exposed to his sadistic frenzy

Science of the fictitious kind
Horrible procedures
Growing madness in the heart of hell
