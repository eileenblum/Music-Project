Marion runs, she runs to save her life
She knows she is innocent but the crowd will see her burn
Lost and lonely with no one on her side
Nothing in the world can ever help her to save her pride

This innocent beauty is torned by the shame
What can she ever do to be free again
Young and beautiful but she will soon stand in flames
Sent to the world all evil, people say

She's not ready to meet her creator
She's too young to be sacrificed
Caught between two evil forces
Caught between her nightmare and death

Nothing in the world can help her, help her to save her pride

Young and beautiful but she is torned by the shame
Sent to the world from Satan, people say

She asks herself, can I run forever
Choose to stand up and face the pain
The haunting crowd will soon catch her
Marion's tears is flowing down her cheeks

Nothing in the world can help her, help her to save her pride

Young and beautiful but she will soon stand in flames
Sent to the world from Satan people say

They put Marion into chains
They dragged her away to the stake
In flames and smoke, they heard her scream
I will come back to haunt you all...
