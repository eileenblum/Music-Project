We started at the dawn of our life
Through our thoughts we ride
A search for eternity
No end and so it will be

A journey to the void
In misery we will be destroyed

The wasteland that we cross
It takes our life from us
We have been to hell and back
Back to you I want to be sent

God almighty in heaven
Now you are our only friend
Please make our journey to end

Death cold winds blow
Sins which nobody knows
It bring tears to my eyes
Makes my soul cold as ice

A journey to the void
In misery we will be destroyed

Feelings still live after these years
Pictures of you reappears
I know I won't see you again
This might be the end
