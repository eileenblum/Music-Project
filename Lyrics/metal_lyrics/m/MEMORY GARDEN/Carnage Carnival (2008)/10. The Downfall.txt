[Music: Memory Garden, D. SwanÃ¶]
[Lyrics: S. Johansson]

I try to be the one to show you the way
From all of the lies that's eating you up from inside
Come, don't be afraid. Let's hide from the day
You cannot deny the path we must take to survive

We're at the dawn of a new day
We're at the dawn of eternal decay
We see the coming of fire
No one believe that this is the end of the world

End of the world, of the world
This is the end of our civilization, it dies
End of the world, of the world
This is the end of the world

I carry on with my battle, trying to get out of this pain
Avoid all the cruel deeds of madness
Our struggles might all be in vain

Praying for something to carry me back to the light
Praying for someone to take me to hell, to hell and back again
Promises broken, promises broken again

Darken my soul, oh father of darkness
Out of control, oh father of darkness

Is this just a massive illusion?
Is this just a taste of a bitter charade?
Am I at the end of my journey?
Will the preachers find me again?

Life's so full of expressions
Its tragedies might seem so obscene
Left of it now are just fragments
Keeping my heart within the dark

It feels like I am trapped within a dream
What evil awoke the terror revealed for my eyes?
I hope that what I see is not for real
I can not believe that this is the end of the world

End of the world, of the world
This is the end of our civilization, it dies
End of the world, of the world
This is the end of the world
End of the world, of the world
