[Lyrics: T. BjÃ¶rn]

I'm not alone, there's something else inside my home
From within the walls shadows crawl out as darkness falls
No place to hide, I've learned from all the times I tried
In this midnight hour, horrors has got me devoured

The slithering steps down the stairs
Raises my whole army of neck hairs
The frowzy stench hit my face
I greet the morning far in the haze

Paralyzed with bloodshot eyes
I clearly recall my mother's lies
There's no ghost or entity
Just say your prayers and you will see

The preludes over, time for this morbid show
It bring some friends up from below
One's missing body and one's missing head
I'm forced to watch the dance of the dead

How can I do penance, and for what I wonder?
What did I do to awake this evil from its slumber?

In this infested hellhole, I'm forever bound to stay
These ungodly beings that lacerates my reason won't let me get away

Paralyzed with bloodshot eyes
I clearly recall my mother's lies
There's no ghost or entity
Just say your prayers and you will see

There's no ghost or entity
I clearly recall my mother's lies
Paralyzed with bloodshot eyes
I say my prayers and wait for another night
