I've lived through a million dreams
I breathe at night and vanish with the light
I've found places of forgotten legends
I've drunk the water from the very first well
Can't still the never ending thirst
Nothing is what it seems, nothing is what it seems

I've searched for pleasures and gold
I can tell the tales that never should be told, never should be told
Now I'm sitting here all alone waiting to get old
My restless soul is slowly getting cold

Drink with me, I'll tell you the secrets within
I am the bringer of lust, the deceiver foretold
I'll make you long for your time to come
Prepare for what you'll see

I've searched for pleasures and gold
I can tell the tales that never should be told, never should be told
Now I'm sitting here all alone waiting to get old
My restless soul is slowly getting cold
