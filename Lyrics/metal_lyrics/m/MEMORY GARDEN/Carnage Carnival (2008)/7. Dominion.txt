For so many nights I have been waiting for my shadow land
And to many years I have been yearning
Come take my hand
So many times I have been waiting for these magic words
I'm longing for you won't you come back to me...
Back to hell

I'm begging for darkness to take me away
To where I contort in dismay
The silence is louder when no one's around
The relics of me won't be found

In so many dreams I'm always falling down
Falling so fast
Don't look behind cause there is nothing there
Nothing to see
For the first time I have realized, grief is my shadow

I'm begging for darkness to take me away
To where I contort in dismay
The silence is louder when no one's around
The relics of me won't be found

I carry on the struggle within, an everlasting battle
Angels and demons are marching with me, my only true companions
A stream of light came over me now I am burning please set me free
To hell with it and all of you
I am condemned and so are you

Undo my chains I have suffered enough
Enough for a lifetime
I hear them screaming in my head and I know
The priest has arrived to read me my last rites

I'm begging for darkness to take me away
To where I contort in dismay
The silence is louder when no one's around
The relics of me won't be found
