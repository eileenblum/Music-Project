[Lyrics: S. Berglund, A. LoostrÃ¶m]

Who's inside my head?
Am I alive or dead?
My alter ego haunts me
Only my nightmares set me free

Deep inside my darkest dream
I see you torn to pieces
Beg for mercy, cry for help
Screaming out in pain and endless fear

A silhouette that want to play
The whispering pain won't go away
I try so hard to stay in control
Still I can't, my sick mind is my tool

Deep inside my darkest dream
I see you torn to pieces
Beg for mercy, cry for help
Screaming out in pain and endless fear
