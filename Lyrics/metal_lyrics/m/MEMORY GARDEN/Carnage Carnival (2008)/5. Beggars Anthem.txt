[Lyrics: A. LoostrÃ¶m - Inspired and adapted by the poem Memento Mori written by Dan Andersson]

Brother, when our painful years
Has rumbled away in the distance
And our last goblet has calmed us all to death

We saw Satan behind a crack in the clouds
With a heart full of songs, with a heart full of songs for lust and whore

Our trembling souls will be judge by our lord
Then our thirsty flesh is eaten by worms

Do we remember the anguish in happiness?
Do we remember fear of living?

Hidden behind the shadows of fear
We laughed at the stupid ones
And again we raised a filled goblet
Though even in the kingdom of death
Fields are filled with carnation
And with happiness we danced
With every harlot at the jesters ball

Our trembling souls will be judge by our lord
Then our thirsty flesh is eaten by worms

Do we remember the anguish in happiness?
Do we remember fear of living?

Harps with ornaments, jewels and gold
We will be forgiven our sins
