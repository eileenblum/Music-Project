We're selling death today
No bargain time to pay
The world has frozen in time
And I take place in line

Impatience burns in me
Curious of what to find
Downward into silence
Downward into hell

If you got a soul, a soul to sell
So go and throw a coin, a coin in the wishing well

Welcome to the carnage carnival
The beginning of our own nightfall
At the carnage carnival

We're selling pain today
Evilution is here to stay
The world burns in flames
And the only thing that remains

Is the fact that nothing is sacred
So please take place in line
Downward into silence
Downward into hell

If you got a soul, a soul to sell
So go and throw a coin, a coin in the wishing well

Welcome to the carnage carnival
The beginning of our own nightfall
At the carnage carnival
A merry go round without sound

Flaming red eyes burn hole in the night, a need to kill is their light
A tightrope dance at the edge, at the edge of the world

I am wrapped up in fear, the nightmare is here again
I am wrapped up in fear

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our carnage carnival
Throw a coin in the wishing well and I'll send you straight to Hell

Welcome... Hell comes... Welcome... Hell comes

Welcome to the carnage carnival
The beginning of our own nightfall
At the carnage carnival
Hell comes to the carnage carnival
The beginning of our own nightfall
At the carnage carnival
A merry go round without sound
