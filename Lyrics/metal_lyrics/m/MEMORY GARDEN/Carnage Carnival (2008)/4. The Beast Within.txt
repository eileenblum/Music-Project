[Music: T. BjÃ¶rn]
[Lyrics: T. BjÃ¶rn, S. Berglund]

Waking up, to what might be
A pleasant and fun memory
The darkest hour, will be my time
I'm only a few steps behind

A madman's work, to the naked eye
Frustration, one by one they die
The worship of beauty's just feeding my flame
The ugly ones taking the blame

Hiding in the shadows
The Beast within the man
I witness my perfection
And relive it all again

People in panic, a preacher so manic
Declare evil has come, from hell

The truth is you should be grateful
I'm cleaning this filthy world up
Descend once again into morbid depression
You'll never hear my confession

People in panic, a preacher so manic
Declare evil has come...

Hiding in the shadows
The Beast within the man
I witness my perfection
And relive it all again
