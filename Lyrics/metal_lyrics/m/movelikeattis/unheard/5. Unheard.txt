Walking the same streets over and over
With no guidance to point my feet
Looking in mirrors to see my face distorted
Is there no end to my self-defeat?

I clench fist
I'm done with this
Tear the serpent from my spine

I'm confessing everything
I'm calling out what I see
I see the world in constant ruin
Tongues of disgust much too fluent
Our impressionable youth is watching the world burn
I am only one man fighting with my own hands
Out of the darkness so listen and understand
That if we stand up and speak as one
Then maybe one day we will see the rising sun

This is your life
But tell me what are you living for?
Selling more than the blood flowing through your veins
Don't tell me that you can't fight through this
When you never even asked to be alive
You never had to be alive

Unbreakable shackles
Holding you back
Constantly pushing back the knife that grazes your neck
Everyday you awake in panic
And claim to sleep untrue
I can hear your beckoning go unheard, so my friend
Let me ask you
What if I just fell apart?
What if I just slipped away?
What if the last breath left your lungs?
What if it all just ends today?
I pray and pray so God
Hear me now I've finally made my choice
All I want is to reach out and tell them
But what if they never hear my voice?

What if I just fell apart?
What if I just slipped away?
What if the last breath left your lungs?
What if it all just ends today?
I pray and pray so God
Hear me now I've finally made my choice
All I want is to reach out and tell them
But what if they never hear my voice?

All of the lust that fooled my flesh
All of the bullshit that fills my ears
All of the hatred that spills my blood
Just take this all away
Think of all the years you've spent
Before the last breath leaves your lungs
Think of all the words you could say
What if they never hear your voice?
