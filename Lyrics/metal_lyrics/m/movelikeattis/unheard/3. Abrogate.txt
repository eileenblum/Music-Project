Who are you to me and to what do I owe the pleasure of being shut down
I'm being ripped up and cast aside
Just another product of a manipulative machine that plagues this earth
I'm bleeding every ounce of abhorrence out from my neck

I'd die one thousand times before you ever opened up your eyes
To what is real and what is counterfeit I've done my time
I've made my calculations
Your fear is my map and I'm going to find you
So brace yourself

You see the things that you want to see
Preaching the lies you bestow on me
I wait for all of the world to see
You are the darkness surrounding me

You say my name
I play the game
Then when the water's calm you'll say its all the same

Its time to break from the mold
Free your mind from what you've been told
Watch me as I abrogate

I'd die one thousand times before you ever opened up your eyes
To what is real and what is counterfeit I've done my time
I've made my calculations
Your fear is my map and I'm going to find you
Watch me as I abrogate

With heavy hearts and broken souls
We crawl to the light
We reach for the gold
But what are we if we are silent?
Forced unto the gallows we watch each other die

This world is an abomination of human life
Isolate the ugly
We force-feed lies
Why do we live?
Why do we die?
Why do we destroy everything we see?
I'll change your destroyed life
But first I'll split the ground open

(You say my name
I play the game
Then when the water's calm you'll say its all the same)
We will not fall through the cracks
You know I'm watching you
It's time I stood my ground and fight you
The world may fear your open mind
