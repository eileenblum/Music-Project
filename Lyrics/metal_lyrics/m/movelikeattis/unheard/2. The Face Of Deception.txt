[feat. Nick Author of Molotov Solution]It's time to take back what's mine

Killing dreams with stone cold lies
These traditions seem everlasting
Leadership from hateful minds
Everywhere you look there is a forceful hand
Pushing forward
Moving backward
Exposing your open mouth
Now my time has come to force this down your throat

If I were you I'd wipe the grin right off your cunning face
Your days are numbered and everything is falling into place now
I've spent my life watching this corrode my mind
I am the product of your fault

Dispose, sudden death
You saw this coming
Didn't you?
Taking all we had
This is despotism

[Nick Author]
Your lies have led you nowhere but to your grave
The lies you make us all hear will all die with you

The world around me crashing down
Will I refuse to stand my ground?
With every step and every breath this leads us closer to our death
Will we let this happen?

And in my mind
All I see the people all around me
These painful looks surround me
We can't be alone
I'm trying my hardest to keep my head level
And what am I?
Just a another life that lives and breathes just as you do
You've devalued the things that I love so much
To the point where I don't know myself

Feel my pulse at least I have one beating faster to the sound of justice being served
Devastation, defoliation, hearing the words come from your mouth
Again and again as you try to expand this two-faced vision of our nation

[Nick Author]
And now the time has come for me to stand up and tell you
You have no idea how long I've waited for this
You're holding hands with the one who enslaves humanity
You think you own me
When you don't even know my name
It's time to get up

You don't know my name
And you think you own me

Killing dreams with stone cold lies
These traditions seem everlasting
Leadership from hateful minds
Everywhere you look there is a forceful hand
Pushing forward
Moving backward
Exposing your open mouth
Now my time has come to force this down your throat
