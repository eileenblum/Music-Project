This is for the souls constantly at war For the ones who have been cast down
But never brought back up
I am here to show you that you are more
Than the worthlessness that they have left you for
I am a sinful man; my heart is heavy just like yours
But I'll be damned if I just let this end me
I'm gonna stand up and be all that I can be

One by one we build them up
The cities to come and the cities that are to fall
This is our painful cycle in which we're trapped
Everyday you think you're living a nightmare

But I won't back down from the calling I've heard myself
And you won't stop me
you won't shut my liberal mouth
Between the heart of God and my selfish mind
I am alive for
I fear no man

I fear no man

Cut out their tongues from their throats as they try to speak
Force them to hear all the lies from your disbelief
All for one and one for himself now
Show me you're here
Show them you're here
It's time to rise up
Take back the lives they stole
Push forth
Open the doors they close
Are we as pointless as they make us out to be?
Or are we men that will fight until we're free?
Make the choice

I know that you're trying to speak
But they'll never hear you when your lungs are too weak
When they tell you what's done is done
Just remember who you are before they shoot the gun
When they tell you that you're in debt
Just remember who you are
When they tell you to take what's left
Don't give up on yourself

Look around
This is old news
Men who desire power with a drive to kill
History repeats over and over again
Nothing changes but the faces and names of the men
We drown in their flood
While they're drenched in our blood
Over and over and what do you have to show?
Nothing more than the dollar bill that you owe

Men who desire power with a drive to kill
You wanna shut me up
You wanna slow me down
You wanna mock everything I live for
But I'll be damned

All around us
A faithless world of deceit
Leaving gaping holes in our minds
But when I look to my home
I recall my heart was always broken

My heart was always broken
When they tell you to take what's left
Just remember who you are
Don't give up on yourself

This is for the souls constantly at war For the ones who have been cast down
But never brought back up
I am here to show you that you are more
Than the worthlessness that they have left you for
I am a sinful man
My heart is heavy just like yours
But I'll be damned if I just let this end me
I'm gonna stand up and be all that I can be
