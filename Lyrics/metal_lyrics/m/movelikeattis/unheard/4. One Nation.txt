Humanity
Civilization object to the unholy one
Hatred stains everything you see
Now I'm left standing here with him staring at me
Bitter cold cuts right through my core
I hear his voice but I refuse to obey

To the public eye they disguise the truth
The world hides the voice from behind the booth
But there's so much more to life than beating yourself to death
Come on

Separated by the brainwork of superiority
Catechized to think that money can save you
Looking at your life as if you're decomposing
And don't you know that you're more than this?
Take me to the basis of your mind
So I can show you real truth
We're so close to the enemy
The only thing on our mind is war

Humanity
Civilization object to the unholy one
Hatred stains everything you see
Now I'm left standing here with him staring at me

One nation in distress
When they turn their back the world sees us wrong
One nation under God
But you tell me
Honestly
Is God the one dropping the bombs?

Somewhere along the line they forgot who we were
Did you forget who you were?

Lifetimes of senseless cycles
Born free then forced unto the circle
Will you accept the chains that they forge?
Or will we fight for the life we're born for?

I will not be blinded
I will not be set aside
I cannot let them cover my mouth
I'm gonna pull back their fingers
Until the whole world hears me speak
I've been waiting for too long
I can hear the music
But not the song
It's time to sing as one
It's time to move the nation
It's time to move this world
