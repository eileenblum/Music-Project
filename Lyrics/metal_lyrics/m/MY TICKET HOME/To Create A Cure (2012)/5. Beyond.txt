Beyond the wall!
Beyond the wall we hear cries.
All the screaming! We can't delay.
Sacrifice me, captivated by fear.
Am I the offering?
Do my thoughts deceive me?
Are these the eyes of a monster?
Beyond the wall we hear cries.
All the screaming!
They've taken our last hope.
Beyond the wall we hear cries.
All the screaming! We can't delay.
Beyond the bone wall we're hunted.
Beyond the bone wall.
Beyond the bone wall we're hunted down.
We're hunted down.
