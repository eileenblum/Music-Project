Speak aloud to the air as if you don't know the words that you're saying.
This is where we've found a safety, a peace, beneath the shadows of walking giants.
Tell me, tell me. (How will you feel?)
How will you feel when you find out who you are?
Tell me, tell me. (How can you heal?)
How can you heal if you don't have any scars?
Test the waters again as if you don't know the dangers of your ways.
Face to face, the cold blooded war machines are all around us.
They're all around us.
Tell me, tell me. (How will you feel?)
How will you feel when you find out who you are?
Tell me, tell me. (How can you heal?)
How can you heal if you don't have any scars?
I fear reality has changed forever.
Take the shape of my demons.
The things I once knew are turning against me.
What next? What now? What will we find in the wasteland?
Tell me, tell me. (How will you feel?)
How will you feel when you find out who you are?
Tell me, tell me. (How can you heal?)
How can you heal if you don't have any scars?
