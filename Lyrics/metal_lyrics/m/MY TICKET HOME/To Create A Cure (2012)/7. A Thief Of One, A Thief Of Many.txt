Stand at attention. Get in rank. Stay in line.
Open fire on my command.
We're gonna find them where they hide.
To restore the broken and poor souls.
We're gonna find them where they hide.
To take back what they've stolen from us.
Smoke out the foxholes. Cut off the exits. Keep them alone.
This ends here. This ends now.
This ends here. This ends now.
We won't let them escape. We're not about to start over.
We won't let them escape so easy.
We're gonna find them where they hide.
To take back what they've stolen from us.
We lay our guns on the ground for them.
They know we'll rise again.
We raise our hands to the sky for them.
We know we'll rise again.
We should have been gone. Been far away by now.
But we failed. This wasn't part of the plan.
We won't get caught again. We're not about to be caged.
We won't get caught again so easy.
We're gonna find them where they hide.
To take back what they've stolen from us.
We lay our guns on the ground for them.
They know we'll rise again.
We raise our hands to the sky for them.
We know we'll rise again.
But now they've got us.
They'll write the headlines.
They'll say it had to be done.
Was it worth the profit?
They'll say we deserve this.
We're gonna find them where they hide.
To take back what they've stolen from us.
We lay our guns on the ground for them.
They know we'll rise again.
We raise our hands to the sky for them.
We know we'll rise again.
Was it worth the profit?
