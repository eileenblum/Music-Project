I know that my time is short
And I know at this distance I can't afford to make everything worth my time
So I'll find a day and I'll make a display

All over town, go all around
And make everything go your way
I'll make every request and I'll make it my mess
As long as I push you away

I don't need you to tell me the way
'Cause I know that I'm here to stay
Don't tell me to leave while I'm resting, at peace
When I have to go I'm spending my time alone

Oh I know that my time is short
And I know with this patience I can afford to make everything worth my time
So I'll make it a day and I'll run my parade

All over town, go all around
And make everything go your way
I'll make every request and I'll make it my mess
As long as I push you away

I don't need you to tell me the way
'Cause I know that I'm here to stay
Don't tell me to leave while I'm resting, at peace
When I have to go I'm spending my time alone
