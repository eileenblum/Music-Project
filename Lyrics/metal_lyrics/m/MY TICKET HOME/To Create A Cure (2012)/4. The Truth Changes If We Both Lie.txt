You've showed me disgrace but I don't need you to waste my time
I won't leave you alone just come back home

I've been trying for far too long to make this happen
I've been making noises to catch your attention, girl
Things are changing and I know that I'll be

Living without you, breathing without you
It's like I'm losing my mind when I'm trying to be here without you
Look at what you do, why won't you give us some time

I've heard your complains but I don't need you to waste my time
I won't leave you alone just come back home

I've been playing a game so long
I can make your teases moving
Trying harder to make me forget you girl
Please attend to know that I'll be
Living without you, breathing without you
It's like I'm losing my mind when I'm trying to be here without you
Look at what you do, why won't you give us some time

I've heard your complains but I, don't need you to waste my time
I won't leave you alone just come back home
And I'll be there in case you try to leave town and escape tonight
I won't leave you alone just come back home

I'm laying without you and I'm lonely alone
I'm living without you and I'm lonely alone
I'm leaving without you and I'm lonely alone
I'm lonely alone
I'm lonely alone

I've heard your complains but I don't need you to waste my time
I won't leave you alone just come back home
And I'll be there in case you try to leave town and escape tonight
I won't leave you alone just come back home
