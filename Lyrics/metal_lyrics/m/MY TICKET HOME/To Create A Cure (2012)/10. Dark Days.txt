(Spineless. Worthless. Self-Absorbed. Self-Assured.
Don't tell me it's fine. Don't tell me to calm down.
I am not afraid to end this hard way.
So it's come down to this. Your lies, my hate, and one bad decision.
This is beyond hypothetic. This is as real as it gets.
And I can't wait to forget you.)
(And to think I believed you.)
Subliminal thoughts leak from my mind.
Because I just cant, I can't wait to snap the next time you try and test me.
Dark days! You say you feel shame?
Just wait until you're exposed.
Dark days! You think you know pain?
I can't wait to cut you out.
(Oh God, I think I'm gonna be sick.)
I am infected beyond hate.
I'm gonna make you question your safety.
You never belonged here.
You never belonged here.
We are infected with a hate beyond control.
(No! No! And to think I believed you.)
Subliminal thoughts live beneath my skin.
But I have held my tongue.
I cant wait to prove that we never needed you at all.
Dark days! You say you feel shame?
Just wait until you're exposed.
Dark days! You think you know pain?
I can't wait to cut you out.
Dark days! You want to see rage?
But you can't begin to know.
And to think I believed you.
You cast the first stone and I can't wait to watch you admit it.
