Am I the victim?
I woke up at the end of my rope today, but Iâm fine.
I feel just fine.
On the inside Iâm falling apart.
On the inside Iâm falling apart.
Look away, donât watch this happen to me.
I thought the hard times were changing.
Go away, just let this happen to me.
I know my struggles arenât ending.
(Who else knows? Who else knows? Tell me who else knows. Who else knows?)
(Iâm not a troubled man. Iâm not a troubled man. Iâm not. Iâm not.)
They knew all this time.
Run like rats in maze.
Chasing, and chasing a walking nightmare.
Escape! Escape!
Escape from them, from myself.
Look away, donât watch this happen to me.
I thought the hard times were changing.
Go away, just let this happen to me.
I know my struggles arenât ending.
Who is 67?
Tell me how.
How do I escape?
(How do I escape?)
Am I a troubled man?
Donât prescribe me a lost cause.
I am the victim.
Look away, donât watch this happen to me.
I thought the hard times were changing.
Go away, just let this happen to me.
I know my struggles arenât ending.
