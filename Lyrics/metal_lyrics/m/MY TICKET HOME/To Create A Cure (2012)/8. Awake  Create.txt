Our world is ending.
Awake me, awake me. Revive what's dead inside.
Create me, restore me. To bring a new life.
Tearing this world apart. Breaking! Burning!
Was this the end from the start?
Our world is ending.
We're all looking for a place to stay just to stop wandering.
But our homes are all so far away from where we meant to be.
Don't keep looking like you know you're alive.
What if we can't survive?
Cause you don't know what you'll find.
Control me, control me. Hiding behind a lie.
Release me, release me. To save an old life.
Collapsing inside out. Breaking! Burning!
Are we the end?
Are we the end or the start?
Are we the end or the start?
Can we change failure?
Our world is ending.
We're all looking for a place to stay just to stop wandering.
But our homes are all so far away from where we meant to be.
Don't keep looking like you know you're alive.
What if we can't survive?
Cause you don't know what you'll find.
You never should have let me in.
As if I'd ever let you begin.
Our world is...
We're all looking for a place to stay just to stop wandering.
But our homes are all so far away from where we meant to be.
Don't keep looking like you know you're alive.
What if we can't survive?
Cause you don't know what you'll find.
Our world is ending.
