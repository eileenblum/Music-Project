(No! You said you wanted to help me.
None of this was any use.
You said you wanted to help me.
You lied to me. No!)
(Can you feel? The ground is burning.)
Look around. You're in a safe place.
Breathe deep and count to five.
Fear and never-ending guilt is haunting me.
It's haunting us.
How you gonna leave when we're going strong?
How you gonna wait so long while we rebuild the life you lead?
Where the grass is green, and where your slate is clean.
Where the world's not always as down as it seems.
You said you wanted to help me expose the fear of change.
Medicate me! It's no use.
You said you wanted to help me.
How you gonna leave when we're going strong?
How you gonna wait so long while we rebuild the life you lead?
Where the grass is green, and where your slate is clean.
Where the world's not always as down as it seems.
Can you feel this?
Chaos reigns.
Can you feel? The ground is burning.
You said you wanted to help me.
