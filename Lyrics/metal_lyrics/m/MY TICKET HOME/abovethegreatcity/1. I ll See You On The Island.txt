I have lied to you so many times, oh God.
But tonight, we're turning this around.
Youâve lived your life for nobody but yourself, blaming it on them.
Come on baby weâll just make it through tonight, 
donât be afraid and just take my hand.
He understands.
And now the tide is pulling you under, as the water fills your lungs.
Itâs hard to breathe when your bodyâs sinking.
I guess tonight weâre not going home.
Why canât we see this?
Now, we go our separate ways.
To find this place, so far away.
I can't see through this lifeless fog.
Itâs closing in on your heaven.
And now the tide is pulling you under, as the water fills your lungs.
Itâs hard to breathe when your bodyâs sinking.
I guess tonight weâre not going home.
