Again we pile the dead, their bones will not heal.
This isnât over yet.
Weâre gonna show the world.
We march on!
Again we bury our dead, our wounds will not heal.
This isnât over yet.
Weâre gonna show.
So listen up, Iâm calling everybody in town.
Weâre gonna set this place on fire.
Your entire cause was lit up in my eyes.
But I wish you told me that the truth was all a lie.
Cause you weâre dressed to kill, and just wasting all my time.
Considering this is your first time out, weâre gonna take.
Weâll take it slow to show you the way.
Try to keep your hands from shaking.
Hold emâ steady hold emâ still.
We got to stop the bleeding, all together now.
Dream of the day weâre gonna show them.
Weâre gonna show them all.
So listen up, Iâm calling everybody in town.
Weâre gonna set this place on fire.
Your entire cause was lit up in my eyes.
But I wish you told me that the truth was all a lie.
Cause you weâre dressed to kill, and just wasting all my time.
