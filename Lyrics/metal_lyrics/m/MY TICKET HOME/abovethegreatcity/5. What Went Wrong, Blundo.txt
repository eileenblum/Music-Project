Now I know, that Iâm tearing myself apart, turning the inside out,
Is this what we are chasing after, or what we are running from?
I see you breathing in, but thereâs nothing you can say.
I never thought weâd fall apart.
You donât have to say a word.
His love will not falter.
And Iâm hoping that you know thereâs so much more inside you.
Just let him make you believe.
Is this what weâre chasing after, or what we are running from?
This cant be our ever-after.
Thereâs so much more to love.
I see you breathing in, but thereâs nothing you can say.
Our eyes turn toward the skylight.
We stand beside ourselves.
Thereâs nothing left to see here.
This is our way out.
Now close your eyes and donât be afraid.
This is why we live, why he calls our name.
Is this what weâre chasing after, or what we are running from?
This cant be our ever-after.
Thereâs so much more to love.
Donât close your eyes.
Donât look away.
Heâll save your life.
