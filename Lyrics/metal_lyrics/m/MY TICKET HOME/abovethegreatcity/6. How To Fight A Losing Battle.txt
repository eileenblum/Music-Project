Is this way?
Is this way that we should say goodbye?
Just stay with me, Stay alive.
I swear to god.
I wonât give up.
Open your eyes.
Just keep breathing.
Donât look down.
Again! Again!
This is nothing but the worst.
Again! Again!
I see nothing but the worst.
Youâve got me weak tonight.
Cause Iâm walking down this dotted line.
Just stay awake, stay alive.
The bloodâs on your hands.
The guiltâs on your hands.
Oh lord, are we just too busy to see the grass so green right beneath our feet?
If you donât stand for something, youâll fall for everything.
