Grow, grow, grow, grow, growing up
Getting old ain't growing up
I'm sleeping my days away (away)
In a bed I never made
You're kill, kill, kill, kill, killing me
Little birdie you're killing me
I gave my mind away (away)
But I don't wanna change

I found a hole in my head
I tell myself that I'm wrong
You ask me hello, but I keep alone
I'm stuck at home in my head

I'm feel, feel, feel, feel, feeling numb
Dirt is good and clean is dumb
Kick my chair, I'll fall through to the floor
Head first right into your heart
Fill, fill, fill, fill, filling me
Wild smoke is filling me
I burnt my mind away (away)
But I don't wanna change

I found a hole in my head
I tell myself that I'm wrong
You ask me hello, but I keep alone
I'm stuck at home in my head

I keep your words in mind
I let your thoughts unfold
I keep your words in mind
I'm falling through your floor (your floor)
Falling through your floor (your floor)

Won't you keep, keep, keep in touch?
To lay with you I'm thinking of
Love helps me consume (consume)
But I don't wanna change

I found a hole in my head
I tell myself that I'm wrong
You ask me hello, but I keep alone
I'm stuck at home in my head

I'm falling through your floor (your floor)
I'm falling through your floor, I'm falling through you
