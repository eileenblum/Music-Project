I'm feelin' okay when I want to
I'm feelin' okay when I want you
I'm feelin' okay when I want to
I'm feelin' okay, it all goes...

Play catch with a fishhook
Cut up your notebook
You all know better than me
Make friends with the lights off
Cover your heart up
You all know better than me
My brain is leaking out glue
I'm good for only one use

I'm feelin' okay when I want to
I'm feelin' okay when I want you (you)
I'm feelin' okay when I want to
I'm feelin' okay, it all goes:

Slow (some things feel best when they're not real)
I'm starting to fray (intentions tender; intentions whither)
The strands all let go (some things don't feel like they should feel)
But I'm glad to be grey (it's my place and I like it)
It's my place and I like it, come on!

I'm so close to your heartache
I feel retarded
We all know better than me
I feel stupid and laughed at
Promise I'm here now
We all know better than me
My brain is leaking out glue
I'm good for only one use

I'm feelin' okay when I want to
I'm feelin' okay when I want you (you)
I'm feelin' okay when I want to
I'm feelin' okay, it all goes:

Slow (some things feel best when they're not real)
I'm starting to fray (intentions tender; intentions whither)
The strands all let go (some things don't feel like they should feel)
But I'm glad to be grey (it's my place and I like it)
It's my place and I like it

I'm feelin' okay when I want to
I'm feelin' okay when I want you (you)
I'm feelin' okay when I want to
I'm feelin' okay, it all goes:
