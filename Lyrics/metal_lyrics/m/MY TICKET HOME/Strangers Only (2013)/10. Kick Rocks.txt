You're full of it!

Say, say it
Say that I'm an evil game
Take, take it
Take it from me anyway
Sell, sell it
Sell your worries all in one
Tell, tell it
Tell me that it's no fun

Bullshit
Poser
Who are you?
Bullshit
Poser
Get a clue

Suck my poison
Suck my poison

Drain me everyday
Stay a tender age
Pay to sing along
You kick, you scream until it's all gone
(Drain) Drain me everyday
(Stay) Stay a tender age
(Pay) Pay to sing along
You kick, you scream until it's all gone

Bullshit
Poser
Who are you?
Bullshit
Poser
Get a clue

Say, say it
Say that I'm an evil game
Take, take it
Take it from me anyway
Sell, sell it
Sell your worries all in one
Tell, tell it
Tell me that it's no fun

Straight from the ass, out of your mouth
Straight from the ass, out of your mouth
Bullshit

Straight from the ass, out of your mouth
Straight from the ass, and out of your mouth
Bullshit
Straight from the ass, out of your mouth
Straight from the ass, and out of your mouth
Bullshit

You've choked already
You've choked already
Bullshit
You've choked already
You've choked already
You're full of it

Drain me everyday
Stay a tender age
Pay to sing along
You kick, you scream until it's all gone
(Drain) Drain me everyday
(Stay) Stay a tender age
(Pay) Pay to sing along
You kick, you scream until it's all gone

Bullshit
Poser
Who are you?
Bullshit
Poser
Get a clue

You're full of it
