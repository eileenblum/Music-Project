I dwell alone
With thoughts I had
It's all I know
It's what I am

I want to know myself like you do
Want to know myself like you
I want to know myself like you do
I want to know myself from you

Give me a new energy
Until my loneliness is gone
You are the push (I want to know)
I am the pull (myself from you)
I bathe in your energy
Until my loneliness is gone
You are the push (I want to know)
I am the pull (myself)

I dwell alone
I have no plans
It's all I know
It's what I am

I want to know myself like you do
Want to know myself from you

Give me a new energy
Until my loneliness is gone
You are the push (I want to know)
I am the pull (myself from you)
I bathe in your energy
Until my loneliness is gone
You are the push (I want to know)
I am the pull (myself)

Revival

You're the push
I am the pull
You're the push
I am the pull
You're the push
I am the pull
I just wanna know, I just wanna know
Myself from you

Give me a new energy
Until my loneliness is gone
You are the push (I want to know)
I am the pull (myself from you)
I bathe in your energy
Until my loneliness is gone
You are the push (I want to know)
I am the pull (myself)

Revival

I want to know myself like you do
Want to know myself like you
I want to know myself like you do
I want to know myself like you
