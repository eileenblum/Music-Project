I'm all alone, stealing things from myself
I wonder why people never ask for help
I don't know why things taste better burned
I've got the time, but I don't wanna learn

Sicken me
Somebody
Show yourself
Run away

I love it, I hate it
I love it, I hate it
I love it, I hate it
I love it, I hate it
I love it, I hate it
I love it, I hate it
I love it, I hate it

Hey, hey, hey
Are you paranoid?
Paranoid you're in a daze?
What do you know anyway?
Your misery only a phase
Hey, hey, hey
Are you paranoid?
Paranoid you're in a daze?
What can you do anyway?
Your misery only a phase

I'm all alone
Lucky I'm by myself
I figured out why no one ever asks for help
I don't know why people think they're not worth each other's time
But I don't gotta learn

Sicken me
Somebody
Show yourself
Run away

I love it, I hate it
I love it, I hate it
I love it, I hate it
I love it, I hate it
I love it, I hate it
I love it, I hate it
I love it, I hate it

Hey, hey, hey
Are you paranoid?
Paranoid you're in a daze?
What do you know anyway?
Your misery only a phase
Hey, hey, hey
Are you paranoid?
Paranoid you're in a daze?
What can you do anyway?
Your misery only a phase

Are you paranoid?
Are you only a phase?

I love it, I hate it

I love it, I hate it, I, I...

Only a phase
