Kill your phone
Break your mirrors
Throw your TV away
Turn the amps up to 10
Start a fire on stage
Piss on it

Sell your house
Sell your car
They're no good anymore
Burn your bills
Throw your coins at the pigs in the mall
Start wishing

Fuck yeah

Plan your life
See your death
Dig a hole for a friend
Chasing girls, see the world
I want it all right now
Keep dreaming

Fuck yeah
I want it all right now

I, I like you more than me
I like you more than me
I like you more, I like you
You, you, you!

Take advantage, advantage of me
(Take what you wanted)
Take advantage, my money is cheap
(Take what you needed)
Take what you wanted
Take what you needed
Take what you wanted

I'll lend a hand to your hands
If my hand you would need
Nevermind
This is fine
I've got nowhere to be
Start wishing

Fuck yeah

New or used
I'm confused
It's the hole that I'm in
Chasing girls, see the world
I want it all right now
Keep dreaming

Fuck yeah
I want it all right now

I, I like you more than me
I like you more than me
I like you more, I like you
You, you, you!

Take advantage, advantage of me
(Take what you wanted)
Take advantage, my money is cheap
(Take what you needed)
Take what you wanted
Take what you needed
Take what you wanted

Yeah, you would know
Yeah, you would know

Everything sucks
Everyone sucks
Everything sucks
Everybody sucks
Everything sucks
Everyone sucks
Everything sucks
Everybody sucks

Yeah, you would know
Yeah you would fucking know

Take advantage, advantage of me
Take advantage, my money is cheap
Everything sucks
Everybody sucks
Everything sucks
Everyone sucks
Everything sucks
Everybody sucks

Take advantage, advantage of me
Take what you wanted
Take advantage, my money is cheap
Take what you needed
Take what you wanted
Take what you needed
Take what you wanted
