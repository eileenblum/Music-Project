Where has all of your time
been spent, been wasted
if you don't know the reason?

If only we could look past the surface
to end the cycle spinning over and over.
If only we could look to our neighbor,
we will all be closer to him.

We cannot relieve
this strain, this tension,
of unbearable routine.

Why, why don't I ever feel complete
When I know it's all privilege?
We have no rights.
We have nothing.
We have nothing.

If only we could look past the surface
to end the cycle spinning over and over.
If only we could look to our neighbor,
we will all be closer to him.

Are you listening?
Do you understand?

Are you listening?
I am talking to you.
Are you listening?
Are you listening?
