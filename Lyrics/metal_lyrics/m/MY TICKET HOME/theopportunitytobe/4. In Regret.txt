In times of need we seem to find ourselves alone
Maybe the day will come, when the ground that we stand upon, stand upon

Is gone, and then you'll finally see exactly how it feels
To lose everything we had

I can't believe I ever beared
Your burden for so long
Everything that I went through, that I went through for you

I can't believe I ever cared
But now I'm moving on
Cause everything we thought we had is gone, everything we had is gone.

(I bet you thought) This dream would never come to an end,
I've stripped away all the lies
And now I'm removing the dead branches.
Day by day I failed, I failed, to see. The. Truth.

I can't believe I ever beared
Your burden for so long
Everything that I went through, that I went through for you

I can't believe I ever cared
But now I'm moving on
Cause everything we thought we had is gone, everything we had is gone.

I, I created the problem
It seems that I, I created the problem
I, I created the problem

Don't even apologize, the word sorry means nothing in your mouth
Don't even apologize, because, your words mean nothing to me now.

All that you'll ever be is a pathetic excuse
And I won't waste a moment missing you.
