(Cast off these crutches and leave behind it all.)

These diseases, will tear us apart one by one.
It seems this storm will never pass. 
It feels like this will never pass.
These conditions we embrace will start the engines of decay.
Cast off these crutches and leave behind it all.

The clock is ticking now.                                   
We watch as time passes by.                                  
I cant believe we didn't see this coming.
The pace is quickening.
This fight will swallow us alive.  

Can we all stand by as all these years rot away?
I feel shame in the wasted potential.      
How can we turn away?   
We never learn.
How long will this take?  

The clock is ticking now.                                   
We watch as time passes by.                                  
I cant believe we didn't see this coming.
The pace is quickening.
This fight will swallow us alive.  

Now embrace the end.
If only we did not desert him.
