You've chosen your path 
But when you look back
Your empty trail won't be there to guide you
Just open your eyes
And see what you've left behind
All that's left inside you

Turn around, there's nothing left to see
There's nothing left for you and me
Go on your shallow ways
Turn around, there's nothing left to see
There's nothing left for you or me
You chose this so go

You chose this so go
You chose this so go

You can't hold back the lies
There's no sign of slowing down
Your lies they can't hold water
You're flooding this town
I can't hold back my eyes
Watching you lay on the ground
I can't believe the lies 
That flooded this whole town

Turn around, there's nothing left to see
There's nothing left for you and me
Go on your shallow ways
Turn around, there's nothing left to see
There's nothing left for you or me
You chose this so go

Turn around, there's nothing left to see
There's nothing left for you and me
Go on your shallow ways
Turn around, there's nothing left to see
There's nothing left for you or me
You chose this so go

You chose this so go
You chose this so go
