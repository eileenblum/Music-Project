This life wont be another failed attempt, a life wasted.
This wont be left to chance.
I've found, a message, a meaning.
This is something to stand for.
Faith is the message, the meaning, the answer.

As we live together, we fall too hard, 
forgetting our actions have consequences.
Watching our lives passing by 
as we look to our neighbors for guidance. 

There is no greater truth, 
No finer example of the truth.
He is our anchor.
I cannot stand alone 
but maybe I can make a difference in this world.

Will you make a difference? 
Can you just stand by and watch this happen?
