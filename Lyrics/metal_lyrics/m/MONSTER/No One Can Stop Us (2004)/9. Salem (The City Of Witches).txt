[Original version "Salem (A Cidade Das Bruxas)" by Harppia on "A Ferro e Fogo"]

It Happened circa around 1692,
34 people were executed
The accusation, Witchcraft
The City, Salem
Cats, rats, crows and bats, they act like guardians
While boils the pot of sortilege
And black magic is running loose tonight
But in this city itâs not a sacrilege

Spells and plagues burn in the middle of the night
Making a tormenting omen of the darkness
Human minds pray and proclaim
Satan, come to us, Oh king of the damned

Hold on there, eternal warriors
âCause the masterâs waiting for you
In loyalty thou shall stay
âCause then, hell will be yours

Salem, the city of witches
Salem, The domain of hell
Salem, The city of witches
Salem, Where evil is eternal
Salem
