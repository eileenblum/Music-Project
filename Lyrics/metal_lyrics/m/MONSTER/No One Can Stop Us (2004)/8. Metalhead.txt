[Original version "CabeÃ§a Metal" by SalarÃ­o Minimo on "Sp Metal I"]

It's a screaming that echoes from inside my head
It's a weight that I carry inside my heart
It's the blood running through my veins that never
Stops
And here I stand, always asking for more
Like a man made of steel
Like an ice man, I am
All the emotions are secret
Inside my metalhead
Inside my metalhead

Metal, Metal, Metal
