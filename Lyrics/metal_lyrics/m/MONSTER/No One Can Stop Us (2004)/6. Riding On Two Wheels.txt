[Original version "Duas Rodas" by CentÃºrias on "Sp Metal I"]

He always goes down the highway, Like a lightning
He's Running from the common place
Defying the darkness
Crossing highways, heâs tracing his destiny,
Without fear, riding on two wheels.

Riding on two wheels, Riding on two wheels

He always goes down the highway,
The wind is cutting through his skin,
His fateâs being written
As he flies like an eagle

Riding on two wheels, thatâs how he lives
And he feeds himself with danger

Riding on two wheels, Riding on two wheels

Draining off the blood of his steel machine,
Down the highway âtill the end

Riding on two wheels
