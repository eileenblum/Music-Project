[Original version "Anjos da EscuridÃ£o" by SalarÃ­o Minimo on "Beijo Fatal"]

When you hear the sound of the tolling bells
The gates of heaven will open
Those that have acomplished their mission on earth
Will get into the eternal realm
Those souls that lived in shadows
Will be wandering out in space
And they will cry out for mercy
But then it will be too late

Angels, Angels,
Angels of darkness
