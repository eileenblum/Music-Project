Here we are again, ready to burn down the place
Theyâve turned down the lights, thatâs the cue for us to start
No motherfuckerâs going to stop us now!
Up here on the stage sweatâs running down my face
Itâs too hot in here, I donât know how we can still breathe
No motherfuckerâs going to stop us now, and thatâs for sure!

We are here, Weâre here just for you
You know exactly what to do
Letâs put this place on fire

You hear the guitar sound, and your blood is boiling down
And now the damageâs done, thereâs nowhere for you to run
Thereâs nothing you can do to stop it now!

âCause thatâs like a disease, it puts you down on your knees
But you want it so much, the more you get, the more you want
Thereâs nothing you can do to stop it now, and thatâs for sure!

I know that they canât stop us now
(No one can stop us!!!)
You know that they canât stop us now
(No one can stop us!!!)

âCause thatâs the right place for us all
Loud and proud, we heard the call

It doesnât matter what they say
Weâll make it happen, yes we can
Weâll never gonna give up
I know weâll stand together âtill the end

Now youâre on the stage with a guitar on your hands,
And by the smile on your face, I know what is taking place
No motherfuckerâs going to stop you now, and thatâs for sure
