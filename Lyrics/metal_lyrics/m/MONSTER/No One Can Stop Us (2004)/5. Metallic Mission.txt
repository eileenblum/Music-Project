[Original version "MissÃ£o Metalica" by Avenger on "Sp Metal I"]

I see the clock striking midnight
Chains are clinking at the corners
Millitary marching can be heard
Lots of shadows under the haze
In every corner thereâs a face
In every face you see the power
In every man the will
The confidence in us all

The union is with us
The strength is with us
All together weâll keep fighting for our goal

Metallic mission, metallic mission
Metallic mission yeah!

Screaming out loud,
We will keep on fighting
