[Original version "Espartaco, Gladiador Rei" by SantÃºario on "Sp Metal II"]

There was a nation, a long time ago,
They always lived like slaves
Then among them a new king arose,
Spartacus was his name
No one to save them, no one to believe,
'Cause they have always lived in fear
The Cowards, killing to live,
He would survive on the arena

Go ahead warriors, to conquer all the world,
Go ahead warriors, our faithâs gonna set us free

But Spartacus, he never lost his faith,
And his people always believed him,
So now, slaves of the faith,
Spartacus gonna set you free

Go ahead warriors, to conquer all the world,
Go ahead warriors, our faithâs gonna set us free

The king, the king,
For now and forever, in spite of the chains
