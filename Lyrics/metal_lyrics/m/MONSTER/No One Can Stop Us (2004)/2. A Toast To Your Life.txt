Please tell me that itâs not true
Yes, there must be some mistake
I still canât believe it
Still think about you everyday
We all try to pretend
Or we never think it can happen to us
But the truth is different
No one is safe here at all

Everyday I wake up, and itâs like nothing has changed
Then I think of you, I know it will never be the same
All the laughs we shared, the suffering of your last days
I know youâre better now, no more laughter, but no more pain.

All the things that youâve been through
All the good things that you did
They were just not enough
To guarantee you here with me

We all try to pretend
We always find a way to explain
But the truth is different
Nothing you do can change it

Life goes on, they say. itâs just a matter of time
So Iâm here today, to celebrate your life

Raise your glasses now, everyone in town
This song will be just like a toast to your life
Come on here with me, everybody, cheers
Listen to me, âcause itâs a toast to your life

Living is not that easy, now that youâre gone
But Iâll try to make it better every time I play this song

[Chorus]

It will always be

One thing I know,
Is that youâll always be by my side
And every note I play
Will be a pray for you,
I know youâre praying for me too

[Chorus]

A celebration of your life
Here I am toasting to your life
A celebration of your life

Here I am toasting to your
A celebration of your
A song to celebrate our lives
