[Original version "SantÃºario" by SantÃºario on "Sp Metal II"]

The world is ending, and no one here knows what to do
Victims of despair, they try to run but thereâs nowhere to
The crying souls, thereâs blood everywhere
Will it be the extinction of the human race?
Where should we go now?
Killing to live
Then a voice cries out

Sanctuary
Sanctuary

Living under the flames, or with the thunderbolt
Searching for an answer in a world beyond
Opening the old wounds like a hurricane
Living forever, I don't know where and how I'm gonna
Live

Where should we go now?
Killing to live
Then a voice cries out

Sanctuary
Sanctuary
