Watch me fall
You wouldnât lose it for nothing
You never fall
But likes to watch people falling
Everyone say itâs so hard to climb
With walls of 25,000 feet
My hands are grabbing the rope so tight
Iâm trying to make it, but then I slip

And fall again
You like what you see once more
Then you sit and wait
Somebody else hits the floor

And as I hear the roar of the crowd
I try to think just in what Iâm doing
Iâm getting closer, I see the top now
Iâm almost there, I will do it, look at me

Look at me now
Iâm standing at the top of the mountain
Above the clouds
But I know that things can change suddenly

âCause Iâm over the edge, now
I like to be over the edge
I always live over the edge, baby

Watch me fall
The same scene over again
But you will never know
Which way I took to get up there

Youâre an expert in the art of falling
âthough never tried to climb a mountain
But then again when you thought I would fall
Iâm here reaching the summit, look at me

Look at me now
Iâm standing at the top of the mountain
Above the clouds
But I know that things can change, but not now
Look at me now
Iâm standing at the top of the mountain
Above the clouds
But I know that things can change suddenly

Next time Iâm gonna make it
But if I fall,
Iâll fly and then Iâll get higher
And higher

Now Iâm so high that you canât see me
Iâm so much high for you to see
Now Iâm so high that you canât see
Iâm so much high for you to see

But Iâm over the edge, now
I like to be over the edge
