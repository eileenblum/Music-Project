Your whole life is in my hands
My wish is your command
I'm in control of every step
Everything goes as I Plan

But you thank god everyday
Just because I've crossed your way
Cause without me you don't have a life

Yes I've never treated you bad
That's just another way I have
To manipulate, so I know you're mine

Everything that you may need
I can give you what you please
But you don't realize, my love
Nothing that you have is yours

And if you had enough of me
You can go, I set you free
You have my blessings, go and live your life

Cause I know you'll be back again
Begging me please let me stay
There's nothing like it, to make me feel all right
That's right

I don't tell you what to do
But you do as I please
I'm your master, you belong to me

You think you're in control
But you're always on your knees
I'm your master, you belong to me

Any problem that you could have
Just call me, I will be right there
So you don't have to face your fears
That's my way to keep you weak

Yes, I'll make your life complete
And you will never blame me
For this emptiness, that you feel inside

I'll command your every move
You will live by my rules
And you will thank me till the day you die
That's right
