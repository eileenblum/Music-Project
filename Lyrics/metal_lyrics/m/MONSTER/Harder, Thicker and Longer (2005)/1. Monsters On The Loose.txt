Louder, faster and heavier than you can think
Bigger and stronger, we're ready for everything
Playing and screaming we're preaching what we believe
Harder, thicker and longer, that's how it is

We don't five a fuck about what people say
We could not care less
'Cause that's the way it's meant to be
That's our way, yeah, that's our way
No way, we will never turn it down
Our way, we call it Monster sound
No way, there's nothing they can do
Our way, Monsters on the loose

In your veins you will feel the rush of adrenaline
You just feel out of control, insanity
My brothers E.V. and Stone are here with me
We're ready to kick your ass, you'd better believe

And here we go again, one, two, three, four!

Never ending energy, the roar of a thousand screams
The walls are sweating; heads are banging, losers on their knees
Feel the wall of sound, we are Monster and we are proud
Come on Monster let's show tem how the big boys do it

Hours of work searching for the right sound
Hours of journey, we're travelling from town to town
Sleepless nights, all mother fucker in our way
It all doesn't seem to matter, we just want to play
