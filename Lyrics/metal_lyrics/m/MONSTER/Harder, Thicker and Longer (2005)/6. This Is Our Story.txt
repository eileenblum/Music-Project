Listen, why don't you listen?
You never hear the things I'm saying, you never listen,
If you don't want to listen to me, why do you ask me?
Why do you ask me what I think

Choices, we have to make them
You always make the worst choices then you pretend that
That you control the situation and still remain with
That stupid pose that makes me sick

This is your story a life full of glory, but

Hey, what you're going to say? what you're going to do?
When the mask falls to show the real you
I'm here to warn you, I'm here to help you
But you're much too blind to see what is right in front of you
Just don't tell me that I didn't warn you

Yes, you had heard it all
A thousand times before, you just reap what you sow
I'm telling you once more, this time why don't you listen?
I'm trying yo help you once again

But you're too proud to listen
You always act so proud, but I can't see a reason
What are you proud about? You keep shooting your own foot
Your life has always been a shame
