Let's go back to 1985
He was the coolest motherfucker at junior high
The faster guitar player, his hair down to his knees
He used his tight jeans with a pony MVP
Iron Maiden T-shirt, what more could he need?
Metal Boy

If he had the right grade. He could play his guitar
Cause daddy said he'd be a lawyer as his daddy was
His mummy used to buy all records she could get
But not Ozzy Osbourne, he ate a bat's head!
He used to put people down, cause he was the one
Metal boy

Hey metal boy, you used to say that you're the best
Hey metal boy, now we know who laugh last

After twenty years, the metal boy is gone
Now heis a lawyer, like father, like son
Looks like a watermelon with a suit and a tie
His wife's a fat woman that controls his life
They have a fat kid that thinks that he's the guy
Metal boy

After twenty yeats, my hair is not as long
As yours used to be, but I still got them, you are bald
I still can't play as fast, as you used to play
But I'm still here playing in a metal band
I can say with pleasure, I wrote this song for you
Metal boy
