All these lies, I couldn't stand it
Alibis, He tried to justify
Our last chance, people believed him
All in vain, that's why I took this knife then I

Stabbed 'till he died, what should I do
Stabbed 'till he died, no mercy for his sins
Stabbed 'till he died three, for, five
Stabbed 'till he died stabbed 'till he died

And now you arrest me
Why, I did something wrong?
If you had arrested him
But I had no choice
That's why I've killed the president

Every time, he's tried to apologize
Then he cried, the same shit again
So I said, I'll put and end to it
That was it, that's why I took the knife then I

Stabbed 'till he died, what should I do
Stabbed 'till he died, no mercy for his sins
Stabbed 'till he died eight, nine, ten
Stabbed 'till he died stabbed 'till he died

And now you arrest me
Why, I did something wrong?
If you had arrested him
But I had no choice
That's why I've killed the president

Of what crime am I guilty?
Something has to be done
All the crimes he commited
You left me no choice
But to kill the president

You know, you can't blame me
What? Who will take his place?
I can't believe what I'm hearing
Give me back my knife,
Cause my job is not completed

Stabbed 'till he died, what should I do
Stabbed 'till he died, no mercy for his sins
Stabbed 'till he died thirty five,
Stabbed 'till he died stabbed 'till he died

Of what crime am I guilty?
Something has to be done
All the crimes he commited
You left me no choice
But to kill the president

Die
