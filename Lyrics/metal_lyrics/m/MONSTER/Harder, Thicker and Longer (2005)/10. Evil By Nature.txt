I'm trying to write a love song
But the words are all the same
I'm trying to write a love song
That didn't say the same things

I'm trying to write a love song
But the music is too loud
I'm trying to write a love song
A song that would make you proud

Instead, this song of hate is pounding in my brains
It just keep coming back, It's driving me insane

I'm trying to write a love song
I'm not bitter to even try
I'm trying to write a love song
But this feeling in me has died

I'm trying to write a love song
But the lyrics didn't fit
I'm trying to write a love song
That's the way it should have been

Instead, this song of hate is pounding in my brains
It just keep coming back, It's driving me insane

Whi is it harder to talk about love now?
What makes destruction so pretty?
So don't you try to be good, we don't know how
Cause we are evil by nature

I'm trying to write a love song
Again I'm using the same line
If you think I'm out of ideas
You don't have to think twice

People talk about anything
In songs, poetry and rhymes
I'm just trying to write a love son
And I can't do it, not tonight

Because, this song of hate is pounding in my brains
It just keep coming back, It's driving me insane

This song of hate is dedicated to you all
No songs of love here for you
This song of hate is inspired by you all
No song of love can be true

Hate

This song of hate is dedicated to you all
No songs of love here for you
This song of hate is inspired by you all
No song of love can be true, don't you heard it?
