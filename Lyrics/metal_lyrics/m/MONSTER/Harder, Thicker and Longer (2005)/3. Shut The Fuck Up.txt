The story never ends, yes, here we are again
I've seen this scene before and it's happening once more
There's nothing for you here, but you have to appear
You always talk too much, so I'll tell you what bitch

I hate bastards full of shit
Shut your mouth or taste my fist

One more word and I'll tie you up with an entire roll of duck tape
Shut the fuck up!
That's absurd, what's a jerk liek you doing here?
I think I'd rather have been born deaf
Than to hear your voice bitch

I'm trying to concentrate, just trying to do my thing
But everywhere I look, there's someone just like you
If you have nothing good to say, please don't come my way
You just bring me more problems, so I'll tell you what bitch

It's funny how I can perceive
The smell of mediocrity
I see some movemente in your lips
But nothing good comes out of it

The simple fact that you're alive
Must be a shame for all mankind
If someone like you crossed your way
Then you would understand that
You should have been born dead
