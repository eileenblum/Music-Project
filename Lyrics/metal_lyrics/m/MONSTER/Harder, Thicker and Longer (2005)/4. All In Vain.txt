Yes, I know what you've been through
All those lies he told to you
But you know I'm not that kind of man

So I don't want to have to explain
Every little move that I make
Don't want to pay for his mistakes
You have to work it out

Every time I talk to you
Is just like I'm not being true
I'm sick and tired of being the villain here

That's the last time I'll pretend
Pretend that everything's ok
You better trust someone again
Or you will end up alone

In every word I said, I know you heard his voice
In every word you said, you left me no choice
In every way I've tried to be the best for you
And everyday I died a little more, it's true
All in vain

People tend not to care
With the consequences of their acts
It is all about now, it's said and done

But the truth finally rises
Yes, it is right before your eyes
Everyone in your life
A victim of your father's lies
