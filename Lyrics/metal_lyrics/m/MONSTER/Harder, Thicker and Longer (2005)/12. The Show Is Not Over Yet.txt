The curtain is closing
Lights are down
I'm on my way backstage
But this time I know, that's all

It's been more than a thousand stages
The applause of a million hands
Yes I know I will miss this
Yes I know they will miss me

Thank you, for the best times I've had
That's the end of the set
But I know as long as my songs are there
The show is not over yet

I look at all the people that
Used to work with me here
As they try to face it all

The smiling faces that I knew
Are not what they used to be
But I can't hear what they're saying
'Cause my music keeps playing

I know that every stage that I've played
Has made my life worthwhile
I know that you who've screamed my name
Will keep my songs alive
Cause there's someone that I've never turned down...
And it's you
