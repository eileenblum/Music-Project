I beg your pardon my dear, but what I will say to you may hurt your feelings
But I've got nothing to fear cause all I'm saying here is true
Every man thinks like I do

Well they can say they don't agree with me
But deep inside they know that's how it is
When you see a hot chic pass
Take a look at that ass

Women! They're mine! The more the better, that's right
Women! They're mine! Two or more at the same time

So you ask me about love, and about monogamy
Who are you trying to fool my friend?
Cause I saw your boyfriend watching that girls double
D's
Blame Mother Nature on it

Monogamy is a social or religious thing
I'm not religious and I don't give a shit

And then you talk about cheating,
And how wrong it can be
Well if you don't want more women,
You can leave them for me

I'm not cheating anyone
They're with me cause they want to
I know that they think like I do

So I'll be true to myself
Do what my body wants me to
And I'm starting with you
