Get me out of this shit now
I don't need more problems
The more I try to make things right
The more they stay the same
That's how it is...

Another night that I can't sleep
Another day that I have to keep on fighting to be awake
Another problem to be solved
Another hole that I have to cover with what has remained

My head is spinning 'round and round
My self esteem falls to the ground
And it fells like there's no way out
It seems like that's the end, and then it starts again

And every night I say my prayers
Pretending it will help but then
My eyes don't close till 6 AM
Pressure on my chest, warning me what's next

Another working day begins
And once again I have to grim like everything's ok
Another day where I have to wait to hear the bullshit that you say,
Time and time and time again

The worst part is what I get
I'm always here to clear the mess
And it's always been like that
It seems like that's the end, then it starts again

Another nioght, the same old prayers
I try to fool myself again
It is AM, I'm still awake
That's enough for me, get me out of here

It's never enough, don't matter what I do
Don't matter what I say
The things they do, the things they put me through
Tell me, Is it to late to start again?
