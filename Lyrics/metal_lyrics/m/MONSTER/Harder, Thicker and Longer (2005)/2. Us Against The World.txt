They say that we can't make it
That we're just a fraud
But I say, let them talk, then
The time will prove they're wrong

So let the games begin
And you will see us win
That's it! Enough with talking
Watch and learn with us

We came to the battle
With our swords, axes and stones
Knowing it will be us against the world
Let's fight the good fight

They say the contender
Will beat us anyway
But I prove that we're stronger
The arena is our place

So let the games begin
And you will see us win
Let them buy the audience
We prefer to do it our way

We came to the battle
With our swords, axes and stones
Knowing it will be us against the world

Ready for the battle
We're sword, "X" and Stone
Knowing it will be us against the world
Let's fight the good fight

If you wanna fight with me
We'll see who will lose in the end
