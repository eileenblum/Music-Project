Some people don't know
The level of pressure that someone can take
Just pass one inch from the limit
And a disaster becomes eminent 
Just when you thought it was all right
You've planned each step
That I would take from here
I'm here to say, man it's not that right
'Cause it still depends on me

You think that you know me
You think that you know this one by your side
I could be the best of your dreams
But I'll be the worst nightmare you could find

Your words of order
Just feeds the hate that's been growing up inside
The way you look at me
It's so stupid that just makes me laugh

The same old story, the strong survive
And all that pose don't make you strong enough
So you will know time after time
I'm not your property

You think that you own me
You think that you own this one by your side
I could be the rest of your dreams
But I'll be the worst nightmare you could find
