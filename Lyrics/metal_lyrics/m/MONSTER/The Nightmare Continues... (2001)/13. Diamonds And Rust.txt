I'll be damned, here comes your ghost again
But that's not unusual
It's just that the moon is full
And you decide to call

And here I sit, hanged on the telephone
Hearing the voice I've know
A couple of light years ago
Heading straight for a fall

'Though we both know what memories can bring me
Bring diamonds and rust
Yes we both know what memories can bring me
Bring diamonds and rust

Now you're stand all around
With snow in your hair
Now you're looking at the window
Of that crummy hotel over Washington Square

Our breaths comes out white clouds
Mingles and hangs in the air
Speaking strictly for me
We both could've died then and there

Now you're telling me you're not nostalgic
Then give me another word for it
You're who're so good with words
And at keeping things vague

'Cause I need some of that vagueness now
It's all come back to clearly
Oh! I loved you dearly
And if you're offering me diamonds and rust
I've already paid
