I did everything that a man can do
Anything that you want
But I don't know if you
If you can trust 
Put in risk my skin
Did everything I could
I could give up my life
And still don't know if you
If you can trust me

If you can't trust me
There's nothing more to say
If you can't trust me
Get out of my way!

If I tell you something
You say that it's a lie
If I have a way to prove to you
That's my alibi
If you can trust

You should know that my word
And the attitudes that I take
Mean more than a contract
Signed on every page
If you can trust me

If you can't trust me
There's nothing more to say
If you can't trust me
Get out of my way!
Fuck you, Fuck you...
'Cause I don't wanna live like this!

If you can't trust me
There's nothing more to do
If you can't trust me
Fuck you, Fuck you...
'Cause I don't wanna live like this!
