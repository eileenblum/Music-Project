All the things that you wanted to achieve
Money, fame, sex, everything more that life could give
You've got in just one week, when they discovered you
They turned a moron into a money making machine 
'Cause every single day another stupid will become
The New, "The Best"

Your skin, your hair, your clothes, your car
It doesn't look the same
Nightmare's Freddy K. Now has a pretty, pretty face
The girls they scream your name
Waiting to have your baby
The more money you get, the more you're beautiful to
them

'Cause every single day another stupid will become
The New, "The Best"

When you got a fool that knows that he's a fool
Everything's OK, he knows there's nothing he can do
But when you got a fool that thinks he's very smart
My friend you better beware
That's when the trouble starts

That's the way it works, and you better learn
'Cause that will be like this until the world stops to
turn
But if you know someone as described in this song
Don't think that's something personal
Please don't get me wrong

'Cause every single day another stupid will become
The New, "The Best"

And every single day another girl will get laid with
The New, "The Best"

So tonight we'll pray that tomorrow we'll become
The New, "The Best"
