Tell me how can you sleep
And how can you relax
Tell me what's in your dreams,
All those scenes from the past
Tell me if you forgot
What you did, what you said
'Cause I know that they can't forget you 
But I'm here just to make sure
That you will never rest in peace
Every night, you know, I'll be your torment
As long as you live

All the people that trusted
In what you used to say
Led their lives to an end
They have learned too late
As they looked in your eyes
While you slice them 'til death
They could see a cold smile on your face

But I'm here just to make sure
That they can now rest in peace
Every night, you know, I'll be your nightmare
As long as you live

Try to fool yourself, to fool everyone else
But I tell you there's no way that you can fool me
Try to sleep at night, then I'll prove I'm right
'Cause I will be there, I'm The Hangman

It's late at night, but you can't sleep
It's getting hard for you to breathe
You close your eyes but you still see me
I hope you live a hundred years
'Cause The Hangman like it slowly

Yes, I'm The Hangman, The Hangman...
Sweet dreams!!!
