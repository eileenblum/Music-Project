Yes, I'm ready to go
Ready to go my way
And I want you to know
What makes me feel this way 
Something inside me screaming
Man you've had enough of this

Everything seems to show
I'll not come back again

Yes you can't beat me
You'll never tread on me again
If you wanna fight with me
We'll see who will lose in the end
Wait and see my friend
You will lose in the end

You better know what you've been looking for
Now you're on your own
Yeah, I have told before
If trouble is what you're looking for
Come on guy be my guest

All the time it's screaming
Man you've had enough of this

And all I need to show
Is that I don't give a damn
