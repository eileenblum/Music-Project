In the beginning everything was silence
You could hardly hear a sound
But suddenly you hear a noise that's coming
You decide to check it out
You can't believe in what your eyes are seeing
You can't believe what you hear 
Tonight, today
Beware of the monster, it's coming your way
Tonight, today
Better hear what I say
Monster sound, like you never heard before
Monster sound, poundin' kickin' at your door
Tonight, today
The sound of the monster's gonna make you insane

The guitar's screaming through the Marshall speakers
Only they can stand the sound
The bass a pumping' hard right on your stomach
Like a thunder shakes the ground
The drums making a hole right through your ears
The voice is always too loud

And now the Band is playing the final chords
And it leaves you begging for more
You go to your house and still feel electric
Your jaw's still dropped to the floor
But there's another town for us to conquer
So we will do it all once more
