Please don't waste your time with me
If you wanna help me
'Cause I don't care what you might say
So please don't try to help me
Don't try to help me, no... 
'Cause if there's nothing left for me
I'm sure there's nothing left for you
So we will feel the...

Fire, burnin', fire burnin' our souls
Fire, burnin', fire
Deep there they will burn our souls

You have always been so proud
In the role of the good guy
But if they knew the things you do
They'll see I am cleaner than you might
So if I'll burn you will burn too

And the priest, that holy man
Is laying with another man
The father, drowning in cocaine
Will give a better sermon then

People killing just for fun
The rulers of this fuckin' world
All those whores there down the road
And people just like you and me
Will always burn

Deep there than you'll know
That you're just not better than
Those there that will burn our souls
