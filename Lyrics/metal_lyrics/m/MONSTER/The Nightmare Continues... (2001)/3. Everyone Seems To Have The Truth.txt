Well I don't care 'bout what you have to say
Instead of hearing you, I'd rather see if you can!
What are you talking about? Nothing to say?
Your voice is clear and loud, but I can't hear you 
The way I live my life is totally wrong for you
You're always right, so fuck off man, I don't care
What are you talking about? Nothing to say?
Your voice is clear and loud, but I can't hear you

Everyone seems to have the truth
Everyone knows just what to do
The famous "Who" is trying to prove
That he knows everything
If you're so smart tell me
What you're doing here my friend

'Cause here you go again
Saying the things you say
Playing by the rules you made
Get out of my way man!

So here you are again, the biggest joke in town
The best succeeded loser, telling me what it's all
about
Too much "blah, blah, blah, blah, nothing to say?
Your voice is clear and loud, but I can't hear you

'Cause here you go again
Saying the things you say
Playing by the rules you made
Go on stupid!!!
