Tell me what you want me to be
I can't stand myself anymore
Tell me what you want me to see
I can't find my way off the floor 

Took me like a hurricane
I think it's gonna rain, yeah!!!
I think it's gonna rain

Rain down on me

Tell me what you want me to know
Tell me what you're dyin' to say
Throw your feelings up in the air
Let the pieces fall where they may

Wash me like a hurricane
I think it's gonna rain, yeah!!!
I think it's gonna rain
I think it's gonna rain down, down, down
I think it's gonna rain

Open your eyes
You can't deny
It's just a fantasy, yeah!!!
Some things will end, some will begin
Some things will never be
Yeah!!!

Rain down on me, Rain down on me...
