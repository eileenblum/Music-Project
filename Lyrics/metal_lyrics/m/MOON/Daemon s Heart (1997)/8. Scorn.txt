You feed the fire
Of your lips
With your body
You are the woman of darkness
The Goddess and the sign

The bunch of liars
Their desire for you

I will not betray
My own might
I will not rest
At your feet
I will not tarnish
My faith
The next night

Stretched on the cross
You bite your lips
You burn in my fire
You will not be the clean one...

Hatred is your pain
I will be the truth
I will be the oracle...
