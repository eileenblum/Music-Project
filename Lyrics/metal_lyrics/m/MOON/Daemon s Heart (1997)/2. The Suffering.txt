The angels of loneliness
Condemned to fire
Without the passion
Without the truth
Under God's eyes
Clean in their lies
The angels of loneliness
- Stay Silent
Poisoned are the tears with words of gods
The suffering of feelings in eternal abyss...
The wings of hope
Among the prayers
- Are dying
I renounce the truth
I chant the incantation
In their eyes
Their hatred
Their liberation
Arise!!
Arise!!
The gates wide open
Shoulder your love
Shoulder your faith
Arise!!
Under God's eyes
Clean in their lies
The angels of loneliness
- Stay silent
