Here I am
I am the devil's eyes
I drink the blood
I hang on the crosses

Here I am
In the nuns bodies
I build the altars
I protect the secrets

I - The effigy of prayers
I - The effigy of sin
I - The confessor of time

Here I am cursed
With black eyes of lair
Converting myself
I convert the nothingness

My sanctuaries will fall down
My desires will burn down
My altars will fall down
Cursed my incarnation
