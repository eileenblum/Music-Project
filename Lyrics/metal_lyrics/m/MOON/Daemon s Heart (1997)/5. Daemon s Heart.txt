The dark desire
Of my sin
In the moonlight
My tears - My wish for pain

Dark side of the soul
Like crying moon
Among the gods
Between the lies

I am the night
I am the cry
I am the heart of the daemon

Satan - Ave!!!
Praise the night!
Praise the sorrow!
Praise the darkness!
Praise the light!

I am the night
I am the cry
I am the heart of the daemon
