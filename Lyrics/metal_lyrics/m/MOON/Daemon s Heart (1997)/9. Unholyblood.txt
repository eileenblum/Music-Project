I shred the sky
With my glance alone
My blood is the thorn
In the eyes of non-existing ones

In fire
I find the beauty
In fire
My blood is the life
In fire
I find the beauty
In fire
I destroy the order

Children liars
In possession of faith
Dying in my arms

Children liars
Hidden in the daytime
They fear my eyes
They fear dark mazes

Children liars!

In fire

Unholy blood
My faith
Unholy blood
My wishes
