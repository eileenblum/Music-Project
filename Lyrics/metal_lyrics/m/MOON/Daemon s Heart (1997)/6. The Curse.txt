Let the wish for sin
Be the payback
Let the lust for pain
Be the victory

I killed the god
With the hands of whores
I killed the truth
In madman's eyes

I am the nocturnal bird
I am lonely wolf
I have created the body
The evil I created and the lie

I am the demon
Sleeping in the eyes
I am the lie
Sleeping on the lips
I am the curse
Profanity in the mouth

I am the nocturnal bird
I am lonely wolf

I killed the god
With the hands of whores
I killed the truth
In madman's eyes
My heart is still crying
And cries the moon
The gods like whores
Give themselves for you...
