I will never be your light
The gates wide open before me
Your nothingness sinks into
Fool's minds only

The shining
The breath of wind
The shining
The soul of the north
The shining
Existence in truth
The shining
Passion in sin
The shining

Your eyes don't see
Your voice doesn't reach
I exist in profusion
Love - Priceless faith
Love - Blasphemy of the beauty
Love - In
Love - Priceless faith
The shining...

I suffer
Tears among the wind
In their wings wilderness
Wake up and die
The might
Like the shadows
Comes back to life
Inside of me

For blood
For faith
- The shining

For blood
For faith
- For victory...
