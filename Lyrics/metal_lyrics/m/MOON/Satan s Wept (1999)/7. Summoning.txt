I summon the force
I summon the hate
I summon the night
I summon the pride

I summon legions
I summon the fire
I summon darkness
I summon...

I'll summon you in sadness
I'll summon you in despair
You'll be my eye
The source of real power...
You'll be my eye
Eternal darkness...
You'll be my eye
Eternal lightness...

I'll summon you in loneliness
I'll summon you in disdain
You'll be my eye
The source of real power...
You'll be my eye
Eternal darkness...
You'll be my eye
Eternal lightness...

I'll summon you through the wind...
I'll summon you through the storm...
