Pale reflection of my face
Is in the mirror of your suffer
Moon's blood slowly flows down
Your wounded body

Through the Demon's heart
Your face shows up
Stained with naive's blood

Evil for Good
Hateress for love
Sacred head of Nazarene
This is my kingdom
And it will never die

Come behind me to him
Go through the mirror
Into the beauty of the night
Into the wild spell
Into the taste of hot blood...
The night...
Starless abyss
The moon...
Master of sadness and light
