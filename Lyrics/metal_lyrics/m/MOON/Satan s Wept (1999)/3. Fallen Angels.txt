Arise from the ashes
Thorns on the head bleed again
On the palms of suffer...
We'll renew the kingdom
Under the sign of silver
Under the sign of silver moon...

Our hearts are burning
Boiled blood in one's vain...

Arise from the ashes
Raise your heads
We are the kingdom
We rule...
We are the Satan
We are the Beast
We are the Fallen Angels
We rule...

War !!!
The war for freedom...
War !!!
The war for freedom...
War !!!
The war for freedom...
War !!!
The war for freedom...

Our heart is burning
Our eyes are blooming
Our hands - Unholy powers
