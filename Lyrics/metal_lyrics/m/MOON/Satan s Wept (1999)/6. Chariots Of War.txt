Starful eternity
Entrance to immortality
I am inside
I last inside

Lightning's in gloom
Cross my cry
Suffer of Gods stops
The kingdom gets bathed
In the fire...

Fiery dragons
- You can hear their scream
Fiery snakes
- You can see their venom

Chariots of fire draw near
Chariots of war draw near
Be scared
Or die in light that comes
Be Scared
Or die in coming light
