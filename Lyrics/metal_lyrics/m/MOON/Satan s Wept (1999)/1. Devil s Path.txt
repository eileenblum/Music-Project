I am the road related with angels
I look for a martyr among you
My claws choke your throats
I am the madness

My tears have stayed only on the road
...To the sky

My Tears have stayed only on the road
...To the sky

I stand in front of the wind
Lead my eyes into heavens
I bleed...

I am the road related with angels
I look for a betrayer among you
In my heart a warning
...Shame, Thorns...

I stand in front of the storm
Spit my blood into heavens
With madness only my sin
Intensify...
