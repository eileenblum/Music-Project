Labyrinth of lights
Hidden in Lucifer's hand
I take glare
I take him

Labyrinth of lights
Collected in my hands
Is part of the fight
To rule the faith

Lucifer's light
Find the power
In a cursed moon...

Lucifer's light
Finds the power
In mysterious Pentagram...

His light is his eye
And winged snakes
Strangle the faithful of Christ...
