Let me
Be procreated together with you
Let me
Be born from your uterus
Let me
Be fed milk of lions
Let me
Raise wings and see you

A night
A secretive face
A monastery of resurrection
You are changing a shape of being

Let me
I'll wear you a coat of fire
Let me
That a fire of lavas will christen you
Let me
Lead you an avenue of deity
Let me
Evaporate to a reality of dream

A night
A dusk has compressed
From an abyss of my soul
You are creeping on the world

Apartments of a hunger
Heads are your food
They whisper in a trance
A content of holly psalms
On a bottom of a cellar of hell
Full of Baphomet's Snikes
