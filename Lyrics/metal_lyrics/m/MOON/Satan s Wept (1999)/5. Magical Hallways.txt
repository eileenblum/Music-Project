Fallen angels
Hold the light
Fallen angels
Throne and kingdom
Fallen angels
They wait...
They call to fight...they call to fight
The lost labyrinth of lights
Feel I have not only been here once
Again I summon unholy powers
To make memory kind

In magical hallways
Haven't found my children
Only light will bring it out of the sin

Labyrinth of lights
My hear inside
Labyrinth of lights
My soul inside

Oh, Lord!
Take my hand
Oh, Lord!
Show me the way out!
Oh, Lord!
Lead me out!
Oh, Lord!
Lead!!!

Fallen angels
Hold the light
Fallen angels
Throne and Kingdom
Fallen angels
They wait...
