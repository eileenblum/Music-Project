Cry in my eye
With the sin in your heart
Suffering only the shame
Curse in the names

The truth is contempt
And essence only
The shadow of symbol...

Ideal of beauty go lost in a word
And thoughts go lost
Only scream stays unchanged
The shame as on the beginning of creation

You were my brother and messenger
You were my brother
Ray and fire
You were my brother and messenger
You were my light
You were my fire

You were my water stainless
Spring, grain...

Now only one part of your wings
Dose in me
Mercy and might
Tears from which you drink your hateress
