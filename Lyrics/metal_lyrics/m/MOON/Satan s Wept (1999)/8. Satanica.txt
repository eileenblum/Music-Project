You have come unwanted
You have come despised
Your heads feed themselves
With my seed
Your eyes feed themselves
With my madness
Winged godless...
Your blood flows down
With my body...

Wings of beauty
Protect your stigma
Caused by hell...
Your tongues
My blaze
Full of power
- Winged godless...

Satanica!
Satanica!

I am the one
Let me be your son
I am the one
Princess of Hell!
You are my light
You are my blaze
Open the gates!!!
The demon gates!!!

Satanica!
Satanica!
