Here's the day
Of our reign
Here's the day
Of the final war
Here's the glory day
Of our kingdom
Here's the glory day
Of our hateress...

That's the one
Who knows the mysteries?
That's the one
Who is the desire?
That's the one
Who is the truth?
That's the one
Who is the eye?

Christ's Blood
Will be shed
Or die in his light

That's the one
Who knows the mysteries?
That's the one
Who is the desire?
That's the one
Who is the truth?
That's the one
Who is the eye?
