Let's go!

Against your demons we rise.
Who is your enemy is mine.
And if our fates must be divided,
Know that we suffer in this united.

I see it in their eyes,
They see the shame in mine.
This legion's my creation
A devastating recognition,
To face the weight of what I've hidden.

Eyes of mercy, piercing through me,
Break my vanity, rend my heart.

My sin is only mine.
Why should they share my plight?
Just Let me take the blame.
I would be better off abandoned.
I don't deserve what grace I'm granted.

I see it in their eyes
They won't leave me to die.
A triumph of volition
An agony that can't be fathomed
Is swallowed up
By this Compassion,
By this one act of suffering with me.
