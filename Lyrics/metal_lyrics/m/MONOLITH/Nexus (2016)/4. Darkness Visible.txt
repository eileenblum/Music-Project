"Light will be unseen. Darkness be thy light.
One subtle deception, thy fatal fabrication."

I heard of the prehistoric oracle, it holds the wisdom of a thousand worlds.
Not one of these can understand me. I must withdraw if I hope to return.

"These ancient words of invocation will make a master of you.
Nature, by artifice, your subject. Your heart's desire by your own command."

"Darkness made visible: What is dark will be light. By this power you return to restore your paradise."

Wisdom, power, all that I want come to me, what I desire.

I feel the ancient power, it pulses through my veins.
I see the veil of nature falling away.

I raise my trembling hand, I cry, "My god, pluck me out!"
And my creation is complete.

Among the falling stars, the planet groans in convulsion,
The universe cries.
All is lost.
