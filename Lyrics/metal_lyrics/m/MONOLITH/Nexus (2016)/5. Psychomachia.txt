Clarity, come silence. Conscience splinters within.
Constancy, come sanity. A tear in the web of reality.

We chase a red horizon beneath an open sky.
Clear waters line the rugged lands.
The crew has called me their own. I wish I could belong,
But they can never know what I hold inside.

Our hopeful destination, where central powers reside,
Is full of pride to mortify.
I long to join their mission, to know fraternity,
But my creation haunts and I can't abide.

I don't belong here.
God, I want to.
Where no path is clear
I can't hear You.

For a time the wind is silent, and I am far from alone.
For a moment all is quiet, but I'm so far from home.
Alive for once, but once is all I would ever dare to feel.
For the storm always returns.

All I ask is just an answer.
All I want is Unity.
These voices clash. Don't leave it up to me.
Just make a way out of this endless ambiguity.
