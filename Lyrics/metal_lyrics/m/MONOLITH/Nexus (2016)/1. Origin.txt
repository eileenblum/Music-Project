I am a man created in the image divine (breathed into life)
I bear the name disgraceful from the first bloodline (resigned to die)

Remember from the beginning
Remember it wasn't so
Remember all that we are
Our state of Origin

How did we come, forgetful, to be so far fallen? (our exodus)
How can we go, eternal, to a place forgotten? (the journey's end)

We can't forget our state of Origin.

The place I fled has become an abomination.
I know not how I came nor where I am.
For all we've lost I take account, I need restoration.
Our first disobedience is not our first Origin.
