On wounded heel I stand, with wounded heel strike back.
The mortal blow is fruitless, is not the last attack.

Oh! Point out the error,
It can't survive the light.
Oh! Now show what you're made of.
Add faith to force, open the great divide.

And it deceives us with beauty atrocious,
And with cunning it feeds us the lie.
It whispers the seed of seduction,	
marking forfeit our souls so we die.

The great deceiver ever pursuing
A fatal bite, but a sterile wound.
The great deceiver ever confusing
A shed skin, an enduring soul.

Oh! Don't heed the horror.
Fear not the narrow gate.
Oh! Now follow the windings,
Sever the source, lest it should take you alive.

Although the payment is bloodshed, the surrender of flesh,
We relinquish the body and look to the Ascent.
We will rise again.
