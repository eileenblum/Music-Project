How far do I have to go to get just a glimpse of you?
If your burden is easy, then whose is it that I carry?

There are no heroes here; the tower that I've built collapses.
All that I thought I knew, like smoke begins to vanish.
Dissolution: foundation turned to fragments.
A heap of broken images is all I know.

Who has authority? Who can answer the question?
Who can bring water to the wasteland?

Where can I go to find refuge?
Who else has claim to this truth?
Show me a path of transcendence, tell me,
What greater power than you.

I see no vision here, the looking glass to pieces shattered
I would trade everything for just the darkened image.
Abnegation: my sense of self, it clashes.
With each reality I'm blinded by the truth.

I'll go as far as I have to go just for one piece of you.
If your burden in easy, then all others, I refuse.
