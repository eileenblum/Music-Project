All is shrouded in mystery.
A word pierces the silence, calling me to come away.

A cold burn, a hollow aching,
A search for phantom shades in empty places.

Is this a hopeless aspiration or am I coming to the dawn?

I will not rest until my eyes behold what calls beyond,
What follows me to every world.

The bitter wind, the laboured paces,
The yearning for an unknown destination.

Long ago I heard the voice that brought me here.
Ever since, I strain to recall.
