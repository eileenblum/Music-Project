This flood of poison outpoured, this horde of demons unleashed.
How many are my foes,
How many rise against my soul, my life.

I believed the words that I said would mean deliverance.
I believed the work of my hands would give me freedom.
So deceived, the bonds of the vow, the call of the siren,
all empty promises.

No matter where I run, the darkness I unleashed surrounds me.
No matter where I hide, I can't escape the evil inside.

I alone awoke from the depths the fabrication.
I alone opened the way to the host of shadows.
Leave me to face what I've done, to fall to the swarm unholy.
Save yourselves.

By hope unreal I brought this endless scourge upon us
I was deceived to think that redemption was in my hands.

Standing on the edge of ruin, my conscience weighing,
With the darkness pursuing, the lie is revealed.

The weight of guilt is crushing.
The endless ranks approach.
