The skies fall and I am loathe to look back.
Be not afraid, not all dangers can destroy you.
The waters surge. The pass That left no man alive.
Look not behind, aid unseen lights the way ahead.

The signs fail. My surest foot is behind.
Be not afraid, not all dangers can destroy you.
The light breaks, but I am forced into shadow.
Look not behind, aid unseen lights the way ahead.

Fix your eyes upon what lies above the climb,
On the source of all desire.
Fix your eyes, for you have left the storm behind,
For the Origin awaits.

Oh, in the face of the abyss I unwill what I once had willed.
Assailed by cowardice, a wound that can't be healed.
In the tempest of my thought I annul the task I chose.
But as light breaks, a shade, my guide; the blessed pray: Arise!

My will to yours united. Your wisdom, my guide.
Three blessed souls my strength. Go forth, as worlds collide.
