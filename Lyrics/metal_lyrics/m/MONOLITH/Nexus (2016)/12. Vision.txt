Be not afraid my son, for I have given you a name
That will never be erased, that will never be undone.

And oh, I knew you long before her.
You are enough, you will overcome.
And oh, I made you for this purpose.
You are enough, you will overcome.

I have called you out from the wilderness.
Your wandering is over now, and the journey's just begun.

If there is any hope for me,
It isn't in return.
If this is what is meant to be,
I say let it be done.

At the center of the universe there's a point that doesn't turn,
Intersecting every world, the only gateway to the source

We are many, but part of The One.
Seeing darkly, but soon face to face.

The Witness to the first descent,
Watching death infect every age.
This is the reason for the burn,
consuming darkness with its flame.

My eyes fail, but still I see into the heart of light, the silence.
The Oracle is now revealed.
I see a vision of a throne,
The Fire and The Rose,
Two Golden crowns intertwined,
A flood of Blood and Water.
Overflow the void.

Take it all, I give it freely,
Place my life in your hands.
Take it all, I give it freely,
Bend my knee to your plan.

I am given a cloak to cover me,
Hope in suffering.
There may be no return,
But there is another Way.
