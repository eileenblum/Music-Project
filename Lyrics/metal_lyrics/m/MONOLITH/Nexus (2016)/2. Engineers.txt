Follow the trail of lies "and man shall be brought low."
This is our humble enterprise.
Swallow your pride. If not, we'll make it so.
We aim to misbehave or die.

The way ahead is never clear to us,
But there's no need to try to make it alone.

Sorrow consumes their lives. We only help them know:
The one with less is who survives.
Tomorrow we cross the skies. Your heart prepare to go.
The time of reckoning is nigh.

This brood of vipers, they wear a mask.
Come with us to tear it off, to see the face, to see the eyes,
to see the face beneath.

I cannot go. This burden's mine to bear alone.
The way is lost. I have no hope alone.
I cannot go. How can I bear it on my own?
The way is lost. I have no hope alone.

The way ahead is never clear to us,
But there's no need to try to make it alone.
The journey's end is never obvious,
But you're a fool to make it on your own.

This brood of vipers, they wear a mask.
Come with us to tear it off,
To see the face, to see the eyes, to see my face beneath.
