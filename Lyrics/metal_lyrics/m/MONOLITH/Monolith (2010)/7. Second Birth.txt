Lifeless, never-ending emptiness
With no one to witness
Only transcending space and time
Made known to me

Spoken into the heavens
An empty lifeless void
Where once was nothing to behold
Now the universe resides

And yet, at the appointed time
The author became flesh
That He might fulfill
The Word that always was

History's culmination, the beginning of the end
Hope for tomorrow found in promises secured

We do not know what the future holds
But we know where we have come from
Some will call it mystery, others ancient history
Yet all of our prosperity is fading

When will we recognize our present perfect lives
Hinge on the sacrifice of those who came before?

The scales have fallen from my eyes
This heart of stone replaced with flesh
This life though once consumed with self
Now finds its freedom and its worth
In dying for this second birth
