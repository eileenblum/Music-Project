Oh can you feel it? The foundations, how they shake
This fortress built on stone eroded, washed away

The past is dead, new hope is born
So come let us worship, the saints of tomorrow

And so we stand as few but strong
Ready to face this coming dawn
Lost at sea, amidst winter storm
The world we knew has all but gone

Oh how glorious our inheritance now defamed
The mantras of our fathers rewritten will be blamed

And when they say, as men of old,
"The truth you hold is but your own,"
Across this land, these words resound,
"Forsake your God, and worship self"

How long will we endure
This selfishness as the cure
For our complacency?
Reclaim our lives from slavery?

Is this our fate, to cave within?
Trade liberty for a license to sin?
