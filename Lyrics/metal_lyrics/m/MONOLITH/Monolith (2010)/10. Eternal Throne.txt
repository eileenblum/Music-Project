Now we face this rising tide
And against all odds we stand
Firm upon this rock
Amongst crashing waves and sand

Counterfeit salvation turned tyranny at last
Courage of the ancients
Our dying hope held fast

Never will we fall in line
No, never will we bide our time
As loyal subjects of this mortal kingdom

Our darkest days are yet to come
The gates of Hell hath come undone

And yet shall we sing praises to our King
So that we might endure this test
Now we give our lives in full witness

We suffer for His sake,
In death we will not break

Just as those who came before
We long to see that day
With the Architect revealed
This world will fade away

The promises of old
Will never be undone
Nor will we waver
Until our monarch comes

By way of holy fear
We are the righteous heirs
To an eternal throne
Our origin made known

What more then shall we proclaim?
Our weakness turned to strength
Through torture we will stay
Though only death remains

Destitution lies at the foot of shallow graves
Though this world condemns, tenfold they'll be repaid
