Our eyes betray
In everything
Hearts of broken men
We do not hope
With certainty
For that we cannot see

Escaping death
Through fury quenched
We trust not ourselves
Those once despised
Have overcome
Silenced, the scoffers cry

We are the few but faithful
Our hearts ablaze
When all the world forsakes us
We will remain

Unchanged amidst
Condemning cries
We will not sever ties
These ancient words
That promised day
Will never fade away
