Despair is waiting
To make the kill
Depression paralyzes
My very will
I've lost so much, squandering time

And at the hour when we're put to the test
We are asleep as slaves to idleness
This withered image we see in our reflection
Is only proof that there's no life within us

There is no time left, I must decide
This is the ultimatum, will I abide?
I know your promises, you've proved your faith

Here where the path diverges, I have to choose a side
My stubborn heart won't let my judgment override
I'm so outweighed by failure, I cannot bear the thought
I pray for freedom now, from all the pain I've wrought

Despite fear
I choose now
To dwell here
Forever

I could leave you, but to whom would I go?
You hold the words of truth, and so my faith rests in you.
