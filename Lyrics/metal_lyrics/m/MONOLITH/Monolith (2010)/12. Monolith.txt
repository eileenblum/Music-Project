Your eyes gaze upon the shores of barren seas
Lost worlds far beyond our reach, they speak Your name

We cannot hope to grasp the vastness of Your universe
No veil of darkness will prevent the light that radiates
From everything

But who an remember the hour they came to be,
And who can predict when their heart will cease to beat?

So we all pretend that, that the world is in our hands
And faithfully we trust, one day we'll understand

Your hands labour through the night, a star is forged
Raptured in blinding light, it worships You

No one will ever know the ageless wonders of Your realm
No singularity escapes the One that permeates
Through everything

Transcendent Monolith,
Now revealed to us
Your meaning hidden from
Those withholding trust

Your power
Your strength

Your love
Your grace
