Don't let it take advantage of your desires
This shadow of fulfillment is laced with poison

I know the hunger you feel
Take heart, for it can be filled

The beauty you are drawn to is not the evil
Denying that it's sacred
The greatest pitfall

Temptation never leaves you
Use your decision
There is only triumph in mastery

Reject the counterfeit that empties you
Embrace the new creation, begin anew
