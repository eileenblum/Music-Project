How long can we hide our eyes?
How can we stand to be so simple?
Why don't we see we are such fools?
When will we stop to heed the call of wisdom?

Forget tomorrow
I'll never be prepared for anything
Live for today
So long as I persist in this delusion
And now

Let it flood
And wash away the filth
May cleansing bring wisdom

Cry out for the gift of insight
Understanding will come to you like rain
Listen and cling to righteousness
Wisdom will make all of your paths unbroken

We must heed the call
Those who hate reproof will be sated with their own devices
