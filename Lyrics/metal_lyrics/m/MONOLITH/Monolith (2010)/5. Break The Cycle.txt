Our own fathers
Have failed us
Now we bear their burden

Their lust consumes us
Fear corrodes
And pain corrupts

Even to death, I would not deny you
Surely not I, I would ever betray with a kiss

Now we suffer
For their sins
We are the consequence

Well I refuse to
Be consumed
I will not compromise

Three times I could not face
The burden of your name
My weakness stemming from
His willing fall from grace

I'll become the model
I will break the cycle
