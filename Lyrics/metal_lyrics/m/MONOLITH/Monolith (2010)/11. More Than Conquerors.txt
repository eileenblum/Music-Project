What can you cleave from a gift that's given absolutely?
Nothing can circumscribe a nature that's infinite
Known forever, our plotted path
This destiny, our calling
Through this quest we are justified
Adorned with endless glory

Like slaughter lambs
Our blood is spilt
The suffering is ceaseless
But chosen to be His elect
We render death defeated

Shall our hearts' distress, or famine, our fear in tribulation
Peril, sword, or poverty, the agony of persecution
Separate any one of us
From the all-pervasive love?

For Your sake we face death all day long
But through this, we are more than conquerors

There is no power in death or life to pry us from salvation
No angel's voice or demon's scheme can cause such deprivation.
Such deprivation through separation cannot hold us.

There is no force in all of time or creation
To sever us from the One
Through whom our death is more than conquered
