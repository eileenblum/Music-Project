We want to know we're in control
Our destiny must be our own
But holding onto liberty,
We will forsake eternity

Our hearts' desire
Is not our minds' intent
How can we follow
That which we can't prevent?

There's always something
A secret vice
We can't let go of
Despite the price

Into this bondage
We go with apathy
The chains that bind us
Our eyes refuse to see

Oh it's killing me
The weight of all I regret
I'm haunted by
The life I can't forget
