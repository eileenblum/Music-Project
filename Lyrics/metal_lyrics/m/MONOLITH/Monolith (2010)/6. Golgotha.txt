The hour is at hand
And the Son of Man
Is betrayed into the hands
Of sinners

Flee in fear of death
Let the scriptures be fulfilled

Silent power bows its head to blasphemy
By blatant perversion of justice, truth made fallacy

Sounded for our transgression
Crushed for our iniquity
Struck down to fill our emptiness
So that we might be made whole

These hands are washed clean from stain of guiltless blood
Crucify your teacher, the man whose only charge is love

It is complete

This day all things are made anew
This day we're reconciled to you

Returning victorious
Death's hold destroyed
With evil vanquished
The serpent undone

When He breathed His last
And the sun went black
The blood of the lamb is spilled
For sinners

Take this flesh and blood
For the scriptures are fulfilled
