Oh! No road can lead us back home.
Oh! We go into the unknown.

Leave it all behind,
all the hopeless ways we try to keep ourselves safe.
The comfort of these walls seems only to betray
the mysteries our hearts contain.

Can you let go of all the fear that has kept you waiting?
Abandon hope of all control.
Embrace the risk of mystery
and follow the Spirit.

Our greatest dreams are but a faint illusion,
traces of the tower of Babel.
Let the fear give way to the thrill of freedom.
Unveil the hidden way to heaven.

The current of the ocean draws us into the abyss.
The power of the wind takes us further from our home.

Oh! No road can lead us back home.
Oh! We go into the unknown.
