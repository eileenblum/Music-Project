Alone I stand.

Hear my brothers, as you have obeyed
in my presence, now much more in absence.

Set your face as a flint.
Zeal for your house consumes me.
I know not fear, I feel no pain,
I have killed beasts with my bare hands.

The kingdom of heaven suffers the worst of violence.
Violent men take it by force, they seek to protect its gates from evil.

Surely I am with you always, until the end of the age.

Confront the enemy with authority of God.
Give no room in your heart for the accuser of the dead.

Through it all, removed from consolation,
I will obey with fear and trembling.
Through it all, in spite of desolation,
I will adore with fear and trembling.
