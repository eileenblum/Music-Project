Broken, I kneel beneath your judgment.
Hopeless, I bow before your throne.
These chains bind me to my fate in death.

Remember not my sins, the failings of my youth,
I will relinquish all unto your cleansing flame.

I plead for sacrifice,
my strength is not enough,
I cannot hope to pass the measure of your rule.

All of my foolish wisdom,
this veil of pride I wear,
will be set ablaze on the altar of your wrath,

Forgive me for these thoughts,
my own self-righteousness,
I cannot bring myself to look upon your face.

I bleed in vain for you, my blood cannot atone
for my transgressions against your word.
