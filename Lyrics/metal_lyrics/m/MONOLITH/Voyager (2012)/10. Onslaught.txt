Now we've reached our darkest end.
The war is lost, we count the cost.
At last, we face this coming dawn
and pray that the light will save us.

The dead are all around us.
Our wounds are bleeding us dry.
This onslaught will be our downfall.
We can carry on no more.
With endless fervor the battle rages on.
The lines break and numbers wane,
now I stand alone.
The pain is searing, soon it breaks my will.
I mean to fight, and cling to light,
but the darkness closes in.

I pass amongst these fallen souls,
tormented men, they draw me in.
But now their hollow faces fade.
I pray that the light will save me.
