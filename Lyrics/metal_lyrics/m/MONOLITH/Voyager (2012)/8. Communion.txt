Break bread in rapture,
Fill your cups in exaltation.
We feast in glory of this victory.

Tell us a tale of wounds borne in honour,
stories of courage survive generations.
Legends remember your sacrifices
Our king adored by your perseverance.

The blood of man is spilled in oblation.
This feast is an omen of communion to come.

Our fallen men testify to our purpose.
No man can live if he can not die free.
Martyrs we'll be as we stand firm in the truth,
await in hope the return of Eden.

All of my life I have longed for
the origin and fulfillment
of the ache that beauty stirs.
