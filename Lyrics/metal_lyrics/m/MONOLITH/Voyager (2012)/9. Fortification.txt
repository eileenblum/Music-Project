Fall back to the ancient stronghold and make ready for war.
Our fortress everlasting
We will prevail.

We are a remnant, descended from a royal throne.
Now we hold fast to the hope our fathers knew.

Brace these walls with solid stone and iron from within
We may fall to protect our own but this sanctum will not break.
(Brace these walls from within. We may fall, they will live.)

Silence at nightfall, the horde is camped outside our gates.
Form rank and take up the weapon of your guild.

We will not compromise the truth on which we stand.
So we fight to leave our legacy now.
We fall, but this monument remains.
We will not subjugate ourselves to a mortal king.
We will defend this holy refuge with our last breath.
