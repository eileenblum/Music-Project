I am a child in ambush with no means of defense.
There is no hope for resistance. I submit in silence.

I lie with the enemy and betray my soul.
My courage, it fails me.
I am a prisoner of war.

I find myself a slave
to the ruler of this world,
my dignity defamed,
sowing seeds of the fruit of the fall â
the fall for which he blames.

I will not endure this prison.
Take heart, defy these shaking hands.
There must be truth, there must be freedom.
With broken legs I'll make my stand.

I won't lie with the enemy
or betray my soul.
I will find the courage
to be a Man at War.
