We lie alone under this cobalt sky
and hold our breath as tracers fly.
Now they're all around us, they're closing in.
We hear their voices. They mean to kill.

With shadows falling, they cross the field.
We've only seconds left, and now:
The ground is shaking and I feel their steps.
With trembling hands I stand to fight.

We will not die on enemy soil.
Against all odds we will endure.

Forgive me, Father. I long for peace.
Grant me strength to bear this guilt.

Beyond the ridge, a flood of light, our salvation. Deliverance.
Scatter evil from our midst, return us all to our King.

We will endure.
