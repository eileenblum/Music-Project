âSon, take heed: be not naÃ¯ve.
Your noble vision is but fantasy.
All men betray. All lose heart.
In these times men act as they must.â

âWhat good is passion when all is lost?
And what of virtue, if you can't bear the cost?
So take my counsel, my dearest son:
Pursue your rightful throne with ambition.â

âAbandon this flight of conscience.â

Your broken eyes, they tell the truth your tongue denies.

I don't want to lose heart.
