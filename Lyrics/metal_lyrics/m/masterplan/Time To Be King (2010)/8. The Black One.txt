Hey can you feel my winter
I have frozen out the pain
She gave me her heaven
Then she sent me to the deepest hell
My demons are calling
I feel them crying like the howling wind

She took my heart like an eagle
And flew me up into the highest sky
I say that woman is evil
Love was flying on wings of a lie

She made me the black one
The darkness behind the sun
My rainbow has gone

I am walking in the darkest cold land
Saving strength to open doors
From ashes to fire
I have to rise from my inner war

Stole my heart like an eagle
Love was carried on wings of a lie
That woman is evil
Flew me up into the highest sky
And dropped me out

Oh! It made me the black one
The eclipse of the sun
Waiting for the light to come
Hey... They call me the black one
The darkness blocking out the sun
My rainbow has gone

Oh! - You can call me the black one
The darkness behind the sun
My rainbow has gone
Yeah! - Look out for the black one
The eclipse of the sun

Yeah! - I am the black one, black one...black one
The darkness has come
