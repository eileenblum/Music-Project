Once there was a young boy in Berlin
Playing in the streets as the war was flying in
Raining down from heaven came the fire
And burned away his city and desire

Winston Churchill and his secret agents
They had their meetings there in London town
Back in Germany one man had made the people see
It was a vision that could never be - No

The SS-Officer of death he was just a marionette
An evil play inside the game
Freezing out the truth sending coldness to the youth
Their souls were taken

New Europa blue the land
Longing for glory it's the nature of man

From New York City to the heart of Tokyo
Breaking news on every radio
The war was over they all gathered round to celebrate
Smiling faces on the streets of faith

Their freedom they had won
No more hiding from the sun
And so many moved to far away
They never forgot the burning
And how their lives were turning
Into something new

Oh Europa new the land
Remember the story when the fire began

Time is moving faster as we strive to earn our holidays
Dealing business in our western way
Romantic places for the perfect modern love affair
To Paris or Rome I'll take you there

The darkness of our history shadowed by the light we see
We are the future

Blue Europa fatherland
We sail on forever to explore and expand Europa
It's possible our plan
We try to believe it it's the only way we can live
