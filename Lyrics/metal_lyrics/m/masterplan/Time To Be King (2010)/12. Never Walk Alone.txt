[Bonus track]

Hmm mm blue day and I face the world
One song and our lives are turning
It seems so far back when it all began
But time was closing in now IÂ´m a fading man

Kings and queens love and dreams
I was like Romeo and Juliet was mine
Taken from the deepest sorrow
To the joys of tomorrow weÂ´ll follow a rainbow

YouÂ´ll never walk alone
Â´cause weÂ´re going home together
YouÂ´ll never stand alone like a burning sun
You will be my friend and sister til the end
I never cry alone aah ah

Lonely night and the starlight brings a feeling
Small and might in a picture so revealing
ItÂ´s all much clearer now thereÂ´ll be no return
So many moments passed us by
And we still got things to learn

Brave new time I wish you well
When I canÂ´t hold on any longer
I hope you will tell my story with glory

Never walk alone on your journey home forever
Never shine alone like a crying sun
WonÂ´t you be my friend and angel til the end
Â´cause I canÂ´t walk alone

Never walk alone on this journey home to never
Never dream alone like a distant sun
I can be your friend and brother til the end
DonÂ´t wanna die alone
