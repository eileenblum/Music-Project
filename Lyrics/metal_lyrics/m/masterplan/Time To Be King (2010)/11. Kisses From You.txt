[bonus track]

It's a cold night and I'm starting to freeze in my lonely world
Only kisses from you can save the day
And melt the ice around my heart

Only kisses from you
Can stop me from feeling blue
Conversations romance revelations
Life is a beautiful game
Under the sun a new day has begun and I wake up
Wake up with the one that I love
I begin again working till the bitter end
My time is just a fast burning candle
Black is the day when there's no more secret words to say
But the music will play - Hey
There's a moonlight and I dream in the shadow
Rainbows flash when I'm thinking of you I know it's true
You are like fire my sweet desire

Only kisses from you can stop me from feeling blue - yeah
We begin again trying till the very end
Life is a hard case to handle
Black is the day when the melody has gone away
No more music to play
Cold night and I'm feeling the breeze in this lonely world

Only kisses from you can save the day and melt the ice around my heart
Only kisses from you
Cold night
Yeah
Hey
There's a moonlight
Only kisses from you
Only kisses from you
Only kisses from you can stop me from feeling blue
