Sending a message to man
I am the sound of the road
Moving with darkness to my home
Searching for reasons to grow
Cynical creatures of coldness
I am the master of soul
Burning like fuel to the hellfire
Power is out of control

In this wheel of deception we feel then we die - Yeah

I am flying with the wind
It's my time to be king and rise

Melting this world of destruction
I am the devil below
Torching the ground of the holy
My heart is black as coal

I am one with the thunder
Crushing the tower of stone

Walking so brave till my breath fades away and I die - tell me why

I am gliding on a wind
It's my time to begin soaring high
And I'm going home

Sending my fire to mankind
I want the story told
Remember the lord of the lonely
I was your rock and roll
Screaming the beast in the monster
My engine is ready to blow
This machine of confusion will fade out and die right
On this earth of conception we break down and try again
Till the end we believe you and I
Our vision has entered the sky

I'm the storm from within
Hear me crying like the wind now
Spread the word across the land
The crown is in my hands
Time to be king
