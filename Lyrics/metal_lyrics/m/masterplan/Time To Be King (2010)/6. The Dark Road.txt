Going back to the beginning
We were only seventeen
I thought that we would last forever
But I was just too young to see

You took our love into your sunset
And left me dealing with the pain
When I think of you it brings a feeling
I can still remember
I was crying in the rain

It was the first time
Feeling lost and blind
And the story's never ending
Someone's heart in need of mending

Now I stand on the dark road
Feeling so cold
And I dream of a place
For tomorrow without sorrow
Where my heart is never blue

The day goes on
And soon the lights grow dim
And my neon city shines the night
I wonder what waits up ahead for me - Yeah!
I still try to find the signs

I have learned to be the lonely
And I'm not the only one - No!
I found my own way of reason
And some kind of peace of mind

Oh! I remember the first time
I was lost and blind
And the story's never ending - Yeah!
It was the first time
If you ask me how I know
My rock and roll
All my life I gave my heart
And my soul

Here I stand at the threshold
Feeling so old
And I long for a place without sorrow
A new tomorrow
For the world to see
Deep inside me a black light
Feel my soul night
As I sing to you
There's no time for us to borrow
Death will swallow
It's the melody of destiny

Oh! So I stand on the dark road
Feeling so cold
And I dream of a place
For tomorrow without sorrow
Where my heart is never blue
Oh! - Yeah!
Deep inside me a black night
Feel my soul night
When I sing my song to you - Hey!
In my time I gave you thunder
And now I'm going under
I am going under
