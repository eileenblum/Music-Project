I've got something to show you
I give you something real
I'm gonna rock till it's over
I came to make you feel - Yeah!
Someone took me from heaven
I was a holy child
Now I'm a lord of thunder
I rose above the cry

On the road to somewhere
I'm not going back again
Sending all my power to the lonely

You can walk the distance with me
And follow till the end
And burn the spirit in your heart
The sun is in your hands

Heartless ride for the lonely one inside my wishing well
I took my blues to the dark side to break the chain of spell - Yeah!

I sold my soul to trouble
Forever a gambling man
Climbing up the tower with my fire
I'm not going back again
On the road to somewhere
Hoping for a lifetime that is longer - Yeah!

You can walk the distance with me
And follow till the end
And burn the spirit in your heart
The sun is in your hands - In your hands

When life is a heartless ride
I take my blues to the other side - Yeah!

Selling my soul for double
Always a gambling man
Sending all my power to the lonely

Hey stranger we can't breathe in water
We can move the land
So find the magic in your heart
Cause you can walk the distance with me
And follow till the end
And burn the spirit in your heart
The sun is in your hands
