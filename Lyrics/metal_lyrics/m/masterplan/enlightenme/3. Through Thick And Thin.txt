I was walking down the street one day
She was there from far away
She came to stay
It was a bright sunny afternoon
I was blue but very soon
She made me bloom

I never believed in love
Now I'm sleeping in a bed of roses
I was lost but now I'm found ,baby
You made me see when I was blind

Swear you'll never let it be
And walk with me forever
I'll be with you endlessly
Always there together
Oh baby, I give you my soul

We go together reaching for the light
In the dark we're shining bright
We'll stand the fight
Open doors of possibility
It's only you and me
We have the key

I never believed in love
Now I'm sleeping in a bed of roses
I was lost but now I'm found
You made me see when I was blind

Swear you'll never let it be
And shine on me forever
I'll be with you endlessly
Always there together

I used to wander in the rain
I always thought my love would be in vain
But then I saw it in your eyes
You moved me with your secret smile

Swear you'll never let it be
And walk with me forever
I'll be with you endlessly
Always there together

I'll be with you through thick and thin
You and me baby will always win
Can't think of anything to tear this love apart
And I give you my soul
I got your heart and you got mine
