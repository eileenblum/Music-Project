[Led Zeppelin Cover]

Hey mama, said the way you move
Gonna make you sweat, gonna make you groove
Oh child, the way you shake that thing
Gonna make you burn, gonna make you sting

Hey, baby, when you walk that way
Watch your honey drip, can't keep away

I gotta roll, can't stand still
Got a flame in heart, can't get my fill
Eyes that shine burning red
Dreams of you all through my head

Hey baby, oh baby, pretty baby
Tell me what you're doin', what you do to me
Oh baby, pretty baby, oh baby
Tell me won't you do me now, what you do to me, baby

Didn't take too long before I found out
What people mean by down and out, down and out
Spent my money, took my car
Started telling her friends she's gonna be a star
I don't know but I've been told
A big-legged woman ain't got no soul

All I ask for when I pray
Steady rollin' woman gonna come my way
Need a woman gonna hold my hand
Tell me no lies, make me a happy man

Oh baby, baby, baby, baby
Oh baby, oh baby
What you're doin' do to me
Watch your honey drip, can't keep away
I gotta roll, can't stand still
Got a flame in heart, can't get my fill
Oh baby, oh baby
Tell me what you're doin' now
