Heart like an ocean, he rings a bell upon the door
Masked in emotion, just a fool to believe
With eyes like a vulture, she bleeds his body to the bone
The perfect communion, of passion and pain

Heart of darkness, give me shelter from the rain
Let your madness take me home
Heart of darkness, call your enemies insane
In this emptiness you roam

This distant illusion, of this freedom that you speak
You tear out my inside, then leave me hear to die
Blinded in silence, why you throw my soul away?

Heart of darkness, won't you save me one more day
Let my spirit carry on
Heart of darkness, oh, I bow to you and pray
Before what's left of me is gone

Oh... I see your smile, and it's burning me inside
I can not cry, but I'm losing my mind

Heart of darkness, give me shelter from the rain
Let your madness take me home
Heart of darkness, call your enemies insane
In this emptiness you roam
