Trapped in this world of illusions, knowing I cannot break free
With every drop of my own blood, I can see
Can't find an easy solution, all of this blindness surrounds
Filling my mind with pollution, all I've found

Still I'm alive
The warrior's cry
Broken but true
Slowly, we rise

With my hand, I call to you
The smoke will rise from burning through
Now I'm alive, we must decide...
Whether to stand or hide from the light...
Won't you see it through?

The women are begging for mercy, his power so full and divine
It's just a moment from evil... Ain't that right?
A walk in the devil's direction, and soon you will find
It's such an easy selection... Who will die?

Still I'm alive
The warrior's cry
Broken but true
Slowly, we rise

With my hand, I call to you
Smoke will rise from burning through
Now I'm alive, we must decide...
Whether to stand or hide from the light...
Won't you see it through?

With my hand, I call to you
Smoke will rise from burning through
Now I'm alive, we must decide...
Whether to stand or hide from the light...
Won't you see it through?
