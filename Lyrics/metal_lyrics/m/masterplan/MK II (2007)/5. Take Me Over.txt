Something burning in my head, remember words that you once said
Feed the anger deep inside, all this hatred leaves me blind
Just a man you left me torn and broken
Screaming deep within my soul
Now I'm trapped inside this hell I've spoken
It's buried in us all

I don't see, I don't feel...
I can't hear the words you're screaming in my ear
Don't you know to take me over
I can't live, I can't die... I can't run because my feet are in the fire
Let me go or take me over

Soon I've got to find my way, gotta find my life today
Tired of broken memories, they burn the fire eternally
Just a man you left me torn and broken
Screaming in my soul

I don't see, I don't feel...
I can't hear the words you're screaming in my ear
Don't you know to take me over
I can't live, I can't die... I can't run because my feet are in the fire
Let me go or take me over

The masters got a hold of me, in a world of savagery
Broke this spell and let me go... Or take me where I'll never go
Just a man you left me torn and broken
Screaming in my soul

I don't see, I don't feel...
I can't hear the words you're screaming in my ear
Don't you know to take me over
I can't live, I can't die... I can't run because my feet are in the fire
Let me go or take me over

I don't see, I don't feel...
I can't hear the words you're screaming in my ear
Don't you know to take me over
I can't live, I can't die... I can't run because my feet are in the fire
Let me go or take me over
