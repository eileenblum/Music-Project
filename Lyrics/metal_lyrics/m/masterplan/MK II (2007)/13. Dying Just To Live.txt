[Bonus Track for Japan]

Only time keeps me hanginÂ´ on
And just this once I fall apart
Break these chains
Take these chains
And lift them from my soul
If this time I find a way
WonÂ´t you take from me
Dying just to live
Still givinÂ´ all I give
Dying just to live
This all I ever did with my soul
IÂ´m burninÂ´ up yeah
And IÂ´m fallinÂ´ down
But I never knew all I had I found
In this place I have not know
The feelings I had lost
Oh and if I find another way
The sun will burn on through yeah
Dying just to live
Still givinÂ´ all I give
Dying just to live
This all I ever did with my soul
Oh IÂ´m fallinÂ´ down
Oh oh IÂ´m fallinÂ´ down
Oh I have not found yeah my way
Only time it keeps me hanginÂ´ on
Listen just this one and ah I fall apart
Break these chains from me
And take these chains from me
WonÂ´t you lift them from my soul
And let me hold
