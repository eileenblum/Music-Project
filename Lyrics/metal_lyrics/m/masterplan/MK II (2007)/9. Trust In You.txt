See my fears along the road, empty dreams and broken homes
Calling out to yesterday, bring me home and hear me say
All alone I struggle on, a fallen man whose life is wrong
These faded dreams they come and go, seems I've lost all that I know

Close the door... You close your eyes
End this tale of sacrifice
Break your spell... Or let me go
I fall apart as the fire slowly grows

Through my eyes, I see no end, no remorse and no revenge
You paint a picture of me still, hold me here against my will
You break me down, you leave me be, a lonely man in misery
You throw my world into the lost, my wounds are deep
They hide the cost!

Close the door... You close your eyes
End this tale of sacrifice
Break your spell... Or let me go
I fall apart as the fire slowly grows for you...
Am I dying?
And there's no more trying
I can see I'm not finding
And my heart belongs to you

Close the door... You close your eyes
End this tale of sacrifice
Break your spell... Or let me go
I fall apart as the fire slowly grows
