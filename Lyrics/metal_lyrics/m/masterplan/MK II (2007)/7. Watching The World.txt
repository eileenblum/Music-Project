I'm watching the world as we lose
I'm searching for something to choose
I'm ready for something to come
Be ready to elevate me
Be ready for something to show
Do all you can do

Alive with the secrets of the night...
Keeping your secrets inside
Learning there's nothing to hide
Are you ready for someone to come
For someone to captivate you
Are you ready for something to show
Do all you can do

There is no light inside this paradise
Watching the world
Do you believe all you must sacrifice
Watching the world

Watching this world through the darkness of night
Finding my way like it's over
Searching for something to keep up the fight
Never let go...

Is there a light inside this paradise
Watching the world
Do you believe all you must sacrifice
Watching the world

Finding the power to keep up the fight
Never give up, never give in... Never

Why can't you see inside this paradise
Watching the world
Finding an answer through darkness of night
