Head in my hands on a cold and lonely night
Blood in my veins working hard to keep me right
In this darkness hell is raging all around
Nothing new, same old hatred we have found
No mind to let you go... Would you do the same for me?

Enemy... why you fight so hard?
I'm just a player in your game

Broken memories dancing on the wall
Pictures of another time
Painting nightmares and sharing alibis
Does this darkness make you blind?

Enemy... why you run so far?
Fighting till your dying day
Enemy... Covering your scars
Why have you lost your way?
Enemy... why you run so far?
Fighting till your dying day
Enemy... Covering your scars
Why have you lost your way?
