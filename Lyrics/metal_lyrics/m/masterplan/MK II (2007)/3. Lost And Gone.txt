You know I come running
whenever you call.
You led my heart to love,
now you made it fall.

You left me here.
I'm crying in the rain.
Someone's pleasure is another's pain.
The promises you gave are lost and gone.
Lost and gone forever.

Offered all I got for sacrifice.
Yet I had you once, was it worth the price?

You left me here.
I'm crying in the rain.
Someone's pleasure is another's pain.
The promises you gave are lost and gone.
Lost and gone forever.

You left me here.
I'm crying in the rain.
Someone's pleasure is another's pain.
The promises you gave are lost and gone.
Lost and gone forever.

You left me here.
I'm crying in the rain.
(Yeah, I'm crying in the rain)
Someone's pleasure is another's pain.
The promises you gave are lost and gone.
(Ooh, I pray, lost and gone)
Lost and gone forever.
