I watch them falling, to their knees, I've worked my fingers till they bleed
In the dark of night you hear them scream, help me get away
And so I've chosen to break free, sail my ship across the seas
Always reaching for eternity... Now it's time

I'm gonna win... Waiting for the moment to be free
Gonna find a way
I'm gonna win... Never gonna lose again you'll see
Gonna fight today... I'm gonna win

Now I'm learning what is right as the fire burns the night
Gonna find my way to truth tonight... Now it is my time

I'm gonna win... Waiting for the moment to be free
Gonna find a way
I'm gonna win... Never gonna lose again you'll see
Gonna fight today... I'm gonna win

Walking through darkness with me
I see the light can you see
Finding the power that grows in you
This is for real

I'm gonna win... Waiting for the moment to be free
Gonna find a way
I'm gonna win... Never gonna lose again you'll see
Gonna fight today... I'm gonna win

I'm gonna win... Waiting till the moment comes to me
Gonna find a way
I'm gonna win... Soon I'll let the spirits set me free
Gonna fight today... I'm gonna win
