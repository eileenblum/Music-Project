Riding through the black of night, to bring you to my knees
To beg forgiveness for your souls, and never left alone
Dress your bodies black and white, won't you pray for me
Just a memory in time... it never lies
Beg for mercy in my eyes

Call the gypsy... Put your mirror on the wall

Throw your earth into the grave, and wipe your tears away
Just your sorrow blindly gave... Bring peace to me
Beg for mercy on this day

Call the gypsy... Put your mirror on the wall
Calling all you... Listen for your dying call
Call the gypsy... I'm waiting for your dying call
