[Japanese bonus track]

Hopes and dreams flow in inside of me
Even now that I'm lost I'm keeping my spirit high
I've got no tears to cry anymore
And I sway on my fate 'cause I'm tired in me
If I can't stay with you how can my love come true
I wonder how much more it to give
Oh how many distant shores will pass me by
I'm wondering and so my love cries
And there's nothin' like this paradise
We are raging through stormy days
Searchin' to find our way back home
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Captured in a world of lies all alone awake in the night
Feeling colder without your love
Hopes and dreams flow inside of me
Even now that I'm lost I'm keeping my spirit high
Got no tears to cry anymore
