I felt your love slip away
You know you shouldn't want to stay
Tell me why you disappeared
And why you've come back here
It hurts to have you near

The roaring silence fills the air
I gotta get myself out of here
Spilling coffee on my shoe, I shiver cause of you
My heart turns black and blue

How can I be with you after this war
My feelings are soar...baby
Why did you come back to hurt me some more
This is after the war

Now in this war I can't pretend
And our souls can never mend
This has to be the end
I've got to leave it all behind
On my way to another life - my new life

I have to go...oh baby

How can I be with you after this war
My feelings are soar...baby
Why did you come back to hurt me some more
This is after the war

Why did you come back
Please let me know, I don't understand
Why did you hurt me again
This is after the war...and I can't let you go
