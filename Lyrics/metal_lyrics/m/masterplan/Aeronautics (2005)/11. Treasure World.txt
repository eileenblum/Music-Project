[Bonus Track]

Out in the rain - I stumble in the Morning darkness
Lonely shadow chasing me
Going insane - I'm looking for a deeper meaning
Will my heart know what is real

I can steal and I can lie
I can play the game
To be the clown that makes you cry,
lead you to the flame

[Chorus]
It's a treasure world
It's a pleasure world
But I am living a lie - Living a lie
And the world is all I need
I see stormy clouds
Changing weather sweeping the sky
Painting the night - Cold winds will blow

Haunted by the things I needed
Cast away from my own soul
Who will take the blame
And will I ever know the reason
Questions piercing my broken mind

Free me from the spell I'm under
I can't ease the pain ... no ...

[Chorus]
It's a treasure world - It's a pleasure world
And we're living a lie - Living a lie
Still the world is what we need
See the stormy clouds
Silver feathers touching the sky
Painting the night - North winds will blow

[Chorus]
It's a treasure world - It's a pleasure world
But I'm living a lie - Living a lie
Still the world is all I need
See the stormy clouds,
Changing weather, Sweeping the sky
Painting the night - Cold winds (cold winds) will blow
