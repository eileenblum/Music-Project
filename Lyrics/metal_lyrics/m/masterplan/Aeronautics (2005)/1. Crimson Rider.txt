As far as the eye can see
Sharp dressed fools with their crazy rules here
And blinding advice from all my friends
Reaching for perfection
I take off in the night
It won't be long, I'll be fighting there
When dawn is breaking

Holy fire I'm not scared of you
I'll take you to burn

Watch out for your enemy

Death can be seconds away
Live for now like there's no tomorrow
And forward we ride in this warlike machine
There'll be no returning

Holy fire I'm not scared of you
I'll take you to burn
Crimson rider, I am the baron of the sky
Come feel the wind turn

Holy fire I'm not scared of you
I'll take you to burn
Crimson rider, I am the baron of the sky
Come feel the wind turn
And when life is evil
I'll fly my wings across the sky

Is it our destiny
Killing our brothers
