Stranger in a foreign land
I reach for you so take my hand
Torn inside I give the best I can
Crave to feel and throw the dice
We'll make another sacrifice

Bring me the light, show me paradise
Forever fighting in this shadow land
Come wind, rise fire

Cool wind, warm fire
Inspire me to live
Cold rock I know you
From my years of pain
I must find my strength again
And the story will be told
After life has been broken
My voice will return

Melting the steel, close to the sun
Dreaming away from this nightmare
A digital world where everyone feeds on lies
Falling from grace, the human race
Religion can never unite us
Only a few who stay on the barricades

When the news are heard
About the fallen bird
Sing my song so you can remember
I just wanted to be here forever you see
To create my soaring melody

And I'm black in the burn

Over the edge to the other side
Your enemy waits in the darkness
You must be strong and prepare for a change in time
Heaven is hell, no one can tell
Illusions of holiness blind us
A fragment of time is all that you'll ever know

When the news are heard of the fallen bird
Sing his song so you will remember
He just wanted to be here forever you see
And create his soaring melody

Deep in the cold, is it the end, I surrender to you
Always a mystery, destiny
far from home we're all alone
Heavy heart, no escape
Death will take us all away
Down in my darkness fights the demons in me
Can you hear me now
I'm sending madness, madness from below
No one can save the warrior soul...no
Welcome to this nightmare

When the news are heard of the fallen bird
Sing his song so you will remember
He just wanted to be here forever you see
And create his soaring melody

We crave to feel and throw the dice
It's just another sacrifice
Black in the burn

There's no returning
Turning black in the burn
