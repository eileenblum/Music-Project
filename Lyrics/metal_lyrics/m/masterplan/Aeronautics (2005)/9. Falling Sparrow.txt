I see a new beginning
As I'm moving towards my grave
I'll be rising from this life into silent darkness
It's just a glimpse of our time
I must act while I'm clear in my mind
Soon I'll be the ghost that lived with fury

And no one's listening in my mind...no
I'm searching for an inner sign

I'm crying colder, the lying's older
Fading are my eyes
Can you catch me I'm a falling sparrow
After all, don't let my soul wings die

We see the world in different stages
Always climbing from our blues
I guess the sour taste of bitterness can breed evil

If we could stop and turn back time here
Would we remove ourselves from crime
Some people say they're doing fine
But there's a struggle in their minds

Feel it coming, no more dawning
Fading are my eyes
Angel catch me, I'm a falling sparrow
After all, don't let my soul wings die

Feel it coming, no more dawning...no more

I'm crying colder, the lying's older
Fading are my eyes
Feel it coming, no more dawning
Fading are my eyes
Angel catch me, I'm a falling sparrow
After all, don't let my soul wings die
