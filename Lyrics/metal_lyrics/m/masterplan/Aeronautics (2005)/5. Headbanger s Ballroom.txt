She's got fear in her mind, killing pain all the time
And the loneliness makes her feel hollow
She will stay out of sight, from the bright daylight
To forget all her troubles for a while

She just wants to dream away
Sick and tired of the games that people play
Hoping for a better day
She needs something to believe in in a life so unreal

Down to the Headbanger's Ballroom she will go
Seeking shelter from the storm
There she can party till the rising of the sun
A night creature on the run

He comes out in the night, he is one with the moonlight
Been looking for love to rely on
She'll be painting her lips, black jade on her fingertips
Trying to catch him with a smile

When her eyes begin to glow, there's a fire from deep down below
Getting ready for the show
She just wants to be near him, cause she knows he's the one

Down at the Headbanger's Ballroom they will dance
Finding shelter from the storm
They're not different only dreamers on the run
Dark creatures of the sun

Down at the Headbanger's Ballroom they will dance
Black leather witches and their boys
Where they can party till the rising of the sun
Night creatures on the run
