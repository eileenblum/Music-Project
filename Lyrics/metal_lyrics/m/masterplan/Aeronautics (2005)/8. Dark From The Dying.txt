Under the moon I'm a warrior
Seeking the shades of the night
Crossing the land like a hero
Marching with pain and delight
Nothing to gain but the scars inside
Cold is the mask and I'm sore from crying

I'm running blind in my shoes
I need places to go, I need things to feel
So I can find it myself something real to believe
I am ready to receive and I'm dark from the dying

After the storm silent water
Spirits must heal in the sun
But I am restless and aching with sorrow
Pushed without nowhere to run

Blind in my shoes
I need places to go, I need things to feel
So I can find it myself something real to believe
I am ready to receive and I'm dark from the dying

I follow a trail between love and lies
Bring me changes and I'll sacrifice

Finding myself
I need places to go, I need things to see
Blind in my shoes
As I'm longing to see what is meant to be
Finding myself...
I've got places to go...I've got things to see
And I'm dark from the dying
Sore from the crying
