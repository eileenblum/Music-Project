Black oil on water - dark soul in pain
My eyes cry softly in the pouring rain
Rising from the ashes where the fire took its toll
And the wheel keeps turning
As the wind is blowing cold

I'm not afraid you know
I'm not afraid to rock the show
My heart is pounding in the night
I seek the light, I seek the light

Unleashed is the power
In the spirit of my dream
I've been tearing down the fences
Always trying to achieve
Come back to the living
Let your sorrow come undone
Cause you have to believe it
From your grief you can't run

I'm not afraid you know
I'm not afraid to rock the show
My heart is pounding in the night, I seek the light
I'm not afraid you know - I'm not afraid
I am a pagan far away from home - I'm coming home

I'm not afraid you know
I'm not afraid to rock the show
My heart is pounding in the night, I seek the light
I'm not afraid you know - I'm not afraid
I am a pagan far away from home - I'm coming home
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
My heart is calling from afar, coming home
