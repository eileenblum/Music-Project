Out in the distance
I still hear them crying tonight.
Cry for the power
is praying to live through the night.

One more time if you dare.
One more minute can you spare.
What shall ride and on hall
Hear them come.

Put my feet Upon The Ground
now i pray that i can fly.
Picking Me Up,
ready to burn in fire today.
Can you see what I feel?
Is it true? Is it real?

I feel the power
that's burning inside of my soul.
Leaving me broken,
I keep my heart from this all.

No more traps, no more lies.
Take a minute to decide.
See the fears start to grow,
let it grow.

Put my feet upon the ground
now i pray that i can fly.
picking me up,
ready to burn in fire today.
Can you see what I feel?
Is it true? Is it real?

Put my feet upon the ground
now i pray that i can fly.
picking me up,
ready to burn in fire today.
Can you see what I feel?
Is it true?
Can you see what I feel?
In that way?
Can you see what I feel?
Is it real?!
