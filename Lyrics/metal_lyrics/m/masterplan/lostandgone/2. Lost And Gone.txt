You know I call your name
whenever you call.
You let my heart to love;
now you made it fall.

You left me here.
Iâm crying in the rain.
Someoneâs pleasure
isnât longer sparing.
The promises you gave are lost and gone.
Lost and gone forever.

I have said all I got for sacrifice.
Yet I had you once, once they were the price.

You left me here.
Iâm crying in the rain.
Someoneâs pleasure
isnât longer sparing.
The promises you gave are lost and gone.
Lost and gone forever.

You left me here.
Iâm crying in the rain.
Someoneâs pleasure
isnât longer sparing.
The promises you gave are lost and gone.
Lost and gone forever.

You left me here.
Iâm crying in the rain.
(Yeah, Iâm crying in the rain)
Someoneâs pleasure
isnât longer sparing.
The promises you gave are lost and gone.
(Ooh, I pray, lost and gone)
Lost and gone forever.
