I can see you have secret in your eyes
fooled me twice with your fading smile
No one ever seemed to take you higher
and like the loverÂ´s hand youÂ´re hard to belive in

I canÂ´t belive it, what am I seeing
playing the games that you play
I canÂ´t belive it, hiding my feeling
donÂ´t wanna force you to stay

[CHORUS]
Why canÂ´t you tell me your lies,
we just canÂ´t stay together
And why donÂ´t you tell me goodbye,
we lost our time forever

IÂ´ve stayed awake for so long, now I am changing my way
The road that IÂ´m crossing is leading astray
I feel the dawn of my changing love
IÂ´m feeling my heart is gonna stop

Never revealing, always deceiving
Wasting my time once again

[CHORUS]
Why canÂ´t you tell me your lies,
we just canÂ´t stay together
And why donÂ´t you tell me goodbye,
we lost our time forever

IÂ´m feeling so alone, why canÂ´t you see
What have you done to me, oh canÂ´t you see

[SOLO]

[CHORUS]
Why canÂ´t you tell me your lies,
we just canÂ´t stay together
And why donÂ´t you tell me goodbye,
we lost our time forever

Why canÂ´t you tell me your lies,
we just canÂ´t stay together
And why donÂ´t you tell me goodbye,
we lost our time forever

No, donÂ´t be a stranger, oh no
IÂ´m feeling so alone.....
