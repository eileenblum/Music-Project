Don't you ever wonder if there's no more right or wrong
Maybe life will treat you like your heart of stone
Chances have never seemed to play the cards right in your hand
In the end you have to call, even if you lose and fall

Chained, chained,
Forced to play their game
I can see you've lost your time along the way
Chained, chained,
You'll never be the same
Now you sold your soul and you will see
They will never set you free

I can't take my life into the dark of hope
Have to keep my faith out of misery
I will face my heart of stone,
No one will be heard alone
You will guard the gate for me,
Show me where to go

Flying high
Reaching over unknown land
Closer to the sun
I'm feeling free

Chained, chained,
Forced to play their game
I can see you've lost your time along the way
Chained, chained,
You'll never be the same
Now you sold your soul and you will see
They will never set you free

Now the journey's reaching far from home
On my way to see the changing dawn

Why can't, why can't you do
I can see right through you
You will never catch me on the run

Why can't, why can't you do
I can see right through you
You will never catch me on the run

Flying high
Reaching over unknown land
Closer to the sun
I'm feeling free

Chained, chained,
Forced to play their game
I can see you've lost your time along the way
Chained, chained,
You'll never be the same
Now you sold your soul and you will see
They will never set you free

Never set you free, no
