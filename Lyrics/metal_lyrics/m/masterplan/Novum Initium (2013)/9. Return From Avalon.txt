Abandon your dreams,
all hope is lost and gone
Time to stop fighting,
unwinnable wars

LetÂ´s make a choice between heaven and hell
Finally found your way out of the dark

[CHORUS]
Swallow your pride, move on,
donÂ´t hide your heart of stone
IÂ´m haunted by memories from distatn times
Fires will burn, heÂ´ll never return from Avalon
Recovering his wounds in this lost paradise

Once you had a dream that would never die
In front of the abyss you are driven by fear

The blood on your hands
wonÂ´t change your destiny
Flames of freedom
leading out of the dark

[CHORUS]
Swallow your pride, move on,
donÂ´t hide your heart of stone
IÂ´m haunted by memories from distatn times
Fires will burn, heÂ´ll never return from Avalon
Recovering his wounds in this lost paradise

[SOLO]

The blood on your hands
wonÂ´t change your destiny
Flames of freedom
leading out of the dark

[CHORUS]
Swallow your pride, move on,
donÂ´t hide your heart of stone
IÂ´m haunted by memories from distatn times
Fires will burn, heÂ´ll never return from Avalon
Recovering his wounds in this lost paradise

Swallow your pride, move on,
donÂ´t hide your heart of stone
Fires will burn, heÂ´ll never return from Avalon
Recovering his wounds in this lost paradise
