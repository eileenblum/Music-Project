[Roland:]
I came within a whisper
feeling this road is blackening as coal
control the urge to scream and shout
But something keeps me locked out

[Rick:]
I know I never let you go
You canÂ´t run away from your lies

[Both:]
Chasing all shadows - weÂ´re alone in the dark

[Rick:]
Screaming
[Roland:]
Whispering

[Both:]
Here I stand with pain and fear
Close to the edge of losing all again
no one cares what IÂ´ll decide
Only God knows whatÂ´s wrong or right

[Roland:]
I can feel it coming down
again and again
a day to day battle between good and evil

[CHORUS]
[Rick:]
This road I remember was ready to pave,
but you are a sinner born lost and depraved
you suffered a setback to achieve all your goals
rip out the pages, let your life unfold

[Rick:]
Screaming
[Roland:]
Whispering
Craving
[Rick:]
Deceiving

[SOLO]

[Roland:]
Aaah...Life is changing to a side youÂ´ve never seen before
Oh life moves on - in so many ways
Please donÂ´t tell me I was always sick and wrong,
what I was looking for so long
And any child can see that I am standing on the edge
on the lonely - on the lonely side with a lonely cry

[Rick:]
I can see burden, no time for mourning
he canÂ´t take it no more
you will try but you will never find the way to carry on
I will burn, I will never learn,
the pain you put me through, the way I had to go
no way youÂ´re ever gonna catch me, nooo

[Both:]
Chasing all shadows - weÂ´re alone in the dark

[CHORUS 3X]
[Rick:]
This road I remember was ready to pave,
but you are a sinner born lost and depraved
you suffered a setback to achieve all your goals
rip out the pages, let your life unfold

[SOLO]

[Rick:]
Life is changing to a side youÂ´ve never seen before
Oh life moves on - in so many ways
Please donÂ´t tell me I was always sick and wrong,
what I was looking for so long
And any child can see that I am standing on the soil
For a brand new start - Novum Initium
