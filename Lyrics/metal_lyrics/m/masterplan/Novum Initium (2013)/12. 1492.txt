[Digipack Bonus Track]Early in the morning
Ships are sailed to find the distant land
For glory for kingdom no one will try
To stop what they already started

And now theyÂ´ve found a way a new world begins
TakinÂ´ everything that they can
Conquer and stealinÂ´ burninÂ´ and healinÂ´
Finding the world they were lookinÂ´ for

And when they sail across the seven seas
FindinÂ´ a whole new world finding a whole new world
All of the dreams and hopes will rise again
As the journey ends as the journey ends
In the name of the law people die for believinÂ´
TryinÂ´ to save their souls
Over and over again only defendinÂ´ their land

So the people are dyinÂ´
Where they spread across the newborn land
For power for passion no one will stop it
Closing your eyes canÂ´t believe it

And now theyÂ´ve found a way a new world begins
TakinÂ´ everything that they can
Conquer and stealinÂ´ burninÂ´ and healinÂ´
Finding the world they were lookinÂ´ for

And when they sail across the seven seas
FindinÂ´ a whole new world finding a whole new world
All of the dreams and hopes will rise again
As the journey ends as the journey ends
In the name of the law people die for believinÂ´
TryinÂ´ to save their souls

And when they sail across the seven seas
FindinÂ´ a whole new world finding a whole new world
All of the dreams and hopes will rise again
As the journey ends as the journey ends
In the name of the law people die for believinÂ´
TryinÂ´ to save their souls
