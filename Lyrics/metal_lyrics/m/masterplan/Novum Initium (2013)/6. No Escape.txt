I save the tears thatÂ´s falling from your eyes
all to use another day
ThereÂ´s no time to fear, regrets are all too late
They just fade away no matter how we try

You had your chance to make it right
but what went wrong
You donÂ´t seem to fear whatÂ´s going on
On a lonely street you call my name
And weÂ´re chained to our reality

Hard to belive we were ever younger
and how I felt your heart of gold
After all weÂ´ve been through I wonder
No more escape for me

I have been closing my eyes for too long
I canÂ´t remember your face
I will show you itÂ´s more than a feeling
But itÂ´s all too late

[CHORUS]
No way to escape from me
now and forever I will keep you down

I have been closing my eyes for too long
I canÂ´t remember your face
I will show you itÂ´s more than a feeling
But itÂ´s all too late
I will show you itÂ´s more than a feeling
But itÂ´s all too late
