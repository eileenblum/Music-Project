I can see the world is changing in time
No matter what I do IÂ´m always behind
I can hardly tell the secret in your eyes
I donÂ´t wanna know when the sun will fail to rise

Time will tell if thereÂ´s some truth or if itÂ´s all lies
And I donÂ´t want to turn around
NothingÂ´s gonna change your mind and I can
tell you that youÂ´re leaving us behind
The earth is going down

[CHORUS]
I canÂ´t see whatÂ´s in your mind
And the stars are burning black
Earth starts to shiver, down comes the river
Man was never a giver

Still belive that everything is alright
There is no way to go we never will find
I will never get the truth our of your mind
Please donÂ´t let me go I am fighting for my life

Time is running fast and nothing that we try
will forever stay together
The earth is going down

[CHORUS]
I canÂ´t see whatÂ´s in your mind
And the stars are burning black
Earth starts to shiver, down comes the river
Man was never a giver

[SOLO]

I can see that you run away, hard kind of feeling again

[CHORUS]
I canÂ´t see whatÂ´s in your mind
And the stars are burning black
Earth starts to shiver, down comes the river
Starting all over again
IÂ´m seeing whatÂ´s in your mind, stars burning black again
