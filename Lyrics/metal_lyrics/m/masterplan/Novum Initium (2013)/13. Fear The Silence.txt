[Digipack Bonus Track]Open your eyes you will see
That itÂ´s more than these ugly lies
Echoes of silence I fear
The vision will never be clear

Oh oh oh oh I am going insane

Love canÂ´t be free

And theyÂ´re coming for you and for me
Hear the secrets die

Every time I see the way you make me
Way you make me oh oh
Makes me wish for makes me wish for more
Every lie I hear

Oh oh oh oh I am going insane
Oh oh oh oh IÂ´m releasing you

Sometimes we fear
The future will never be here
NobodyÂ´s showing their tears
Never to be found to be found

Every time I see the way you make me
Way you make me oh oh
Makes me wish for makes me wish for more
Every lie I hear

IÂ´m begging for you begginÂ´ for you
Just canÂ´t see it
You just canÂ´t see no more

Oh oh oh oh I am going insane
Oh oh oh oh IÂ´m releasing you
Oh oh oh oh I am going insane
Oh oh oh oh IÂ´m releasing you
