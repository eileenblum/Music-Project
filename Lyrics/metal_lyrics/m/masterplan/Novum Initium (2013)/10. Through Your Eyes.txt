Look at me father
as I take a stand
How could I build you up
with my empty hands
Listen please mother
this is my voice
CanÂ´t do no other
itÂ´s my blind eyed choice

This is my freedom
this is my choice
Time is coming
IÂ´m the future so much
more to discover
Sailing my ship
across the seas

[CHORUS]
A moment from now
when I walk through that door
The world is changing again
And I know I will fall
on my way to nowhere
IÂ´m trying to find my home
Oh no, Trying to find my way home

Hear me, my first born
IÂ´ll let you go
Time is running
No more chance
before the night is over
And who is gonna save you
if youÂ´re fighting alone

[CHORUS]
A moment from now
when I walk through that door
The world is changing again
And I know I will fall
on my way to nowhere
IÂ´m trying to find my home
Trying to find, one more time
Oh no

[SOLO]

[CHORUS]
A moment from now
when I walk through that door
The world is changing again
And I know I will fall
on my way to nowhere
IÂ´m trying to find my home
Trying to find, one more time
Oh no
