IÂ´m feeling lonely down and out
I know my heart just wanna shout, no no no

And I tear down every feeling
IÂ´m convincing you to stay
All your sadness I can see no more
And itÂ´s all become a lie

[CHORUS]
And I pray on my soul, I wanÂ´t call your name no more
Never felt this way somehow before
And IÂ´m falling, IÂ´m hating, it feels like IÂ´m suffocating
There is no more chance, I canÂ´t hold on

LifeÂ´s never gonna fall apart
IÂ´ll give myself a brand new start

And I tear down every feeling
Not convincing you to stay
All your sadness I canÂ´t see no more
And I just became alive

[CHORUS]
And I pray on my soul, I wanÂ´t call your name no more
Never felt this way somehow before
And IÂ´m falling, IÂ´m hating, it feels like IÂ´m suffocating
There is no more chance, I canÂ´t hold on
I canÂ´t hold on!

[SOLO]

[CHORUS]
And I pray on my soul, I wanÂ´t call your name no more
Never felt this way somehow before
And IÂ´m falling, IÂ´m hating, it feels like IÂ´m suffocating
There is no more chance, I canÂ´t hold on
And I pray on my soul, I wanÂ´t call your name no more
There is no more chance, I canÂ´t hold on
