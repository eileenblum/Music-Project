After wasting my life away,
maybe you save my soul
the laughter is fading
As long as you tell me why,
I just canÂ´t say goodbye
the story is changing

Showing me a sign, there will never be time
Hiding from the light, you will hardly survive

[CHORUS]
Just keep your dream alive
I canÂ´t stay in the dark
when youÂ´re calling my name
Just keep your dream alive
Cause weÂ´re walking in shadows

Fear all the pain you chased away,
no more hiding just let it go
Just try to keep your heart alive,
and no one will ever know

Showing me a sign, there will never be time
Hiding from the night, you will hardly survive

[CHORUS]
Just keep your dream alive
I canÂ´t stay in the dark
when youÂ´re calling my name
Just keep your dream alive
Cause weÂ´re walking in shadows

I thought I lost you one more time
Just keep searching and youÂ´ll find
All the answers that youÂ´re looking for

[CHORUS]
Just keep your dream alive
I canÂ´t stay in the dark
when youÂ´re calling my name
Just keep your dream alive
Cause weÂ´re walking in shadows

Just keep your dream alive
I canÂ´t stay in the dark
when youÂ´re calling my name
Just keep your dream alive
Cause weÂ´re walking in shadows
