Hold on the medal of faith is gone
our paths filled with fading emotions
Slow down the time is against us
and uncaring souls canÂ´t remember

Have you ever ceased to wonder
Why weÂ´re going six feet under
Pride and glory leads us to revenge

[CHORUS]
I feel the madness rising from the ground
No hope for mankind itÂ´s too late
Black night of magic throwing us around
CanÂ´t find that feeling again

Proud heart keep fighting for what is right
no reason to call a chance a liar
We still are lost in the lonely night
mankind will never surrender

WeÂ´re all seeking human error
Blinded by the lawless terror
Losing prayers and the answers gone

[CHORUS]
I feel the madness rising from the ground
No hope for mankind itÂ´s too late
Black night of magic throwing us around
CanÂ´t find that feeling again

[SOLO]

[CHORUS]
I feel the madness rising from the ground
No hope for mankind itÂ´s too late
Black night of magic throwing us around
CanÂ´t find that feeling again

[CHORUS]
I feel the madness rising from the ground
No hope for mankind itÂ´s too late
Black night of magic throwing us around
CanÂ´t find that feeling again
