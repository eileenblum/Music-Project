We held up the metal torch
And they tried to take the flame
We've been running against the wall
But we always overcame
No sense no reason
We are the ones you love to hate

Feed the desire
Fighting for our dreams
Just look behind you
The visions once believed
Let's burn the bridges down
And cast dispersion to the wind

Who can we trust again
We must look to find another way to
That kind hearted light
Beyond the dark
But clouds still hide the seven seas
As the story unfolds
No regret
Unlock the key
To unitey eternally

Look for an exit
In a dead end strett of lies
Judgement day comes to all
Can you afford the price
Turn your blackened faith
And brain the venom from your mind

Who can we trust again
We must look to find another way to
That kind hearted light
Beyond the dark
But clouds still hide the seven seas
As the story unfolds
No regret
Unlock the key
To unite eternally
For eternity

Kind hearted light
Beyond the dark
But clouds still hide the seven seas
As the story unfolds
No regret
Unlock the key
To unite eternally
