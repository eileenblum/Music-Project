[Bonus Track]

There's been a change in the weather
I thought the sun was forever you and me
You know I'm into the music
So tell me why did you choose it
And let me believe - yeah yeah
What happened suddenly
You say you need to be free
And you're stone cold

You say I don't have the karma
You say I ain't got the soul
But one thing's for sure
When you walk out that door
The kid rocks on

I'll take my heart and go for the treasure
On my own to learn how to measure right and wrong
Travelling with no destination
Riding the tide of sensation
I can't let go...no no

People say I don't have the karma
They say I ain't got the soul
But there's one thing I know
I'll be coming down that road
Cause the kid rocks on...hey
You may say I'm a dreamer
You may say I'm not real
But they'll still play that song
When I'm long gone
Cause the kid rocks on

They say I don't have the karma
They say I ain't got the soul
But there's one thing I know
I'll be coming down that road
Cause the kid rocks on

When you hear it on the radio... hey
When you see me on tv
There is one thing you know at the start of the show
The kid rocks
The kid rocks
The kid rocks on
