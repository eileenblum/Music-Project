You cannot see it coming
Always without a warning
You need to hold on tighter
Find a brand new start

High on the wire
They taunted you like the Messiah
Time for a change
Before your life just falls apart

How could you find a way
From deep within your heart
Reach out and gaze at the star
Let the vision fly

We always have to sail on
Out of shadows to the light beyond
Never shut your waery eyes
But always try to see the line
Can you see it in your mind

Wearing the mask for so long
The clown must believe to hold on
Throw down your fears
and guide the strength which lies within

We always have to sail on
Out of shadows to the light beyond
Never shut your waery eyes
But always try to see the line
Can you see it in your mind

Can you see it in your mind

New rising sun will shine forever
All your power strong as steel
Turn the page and seek no saviour
Break free and see
The line through the wheel

We always have to sail on
Out of shadows to the light beyond
Never shut your waery eyes
But always try to see the line

We always have to sail on
Out of shadows to the light beyond
Never shut your waery eyes
But always try to see the line

Can you see it in your mind
Can you see the line
See the line through the wheel
Can you see the line
