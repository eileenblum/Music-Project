Send me a message in case you understand
Be sincere about it - this is for real
You feel this aversion to life
Fear and loathing, the weight of the world
It will all fade away

Now we climb up to a place
Where the beauty is everlasting
Our will as unshakeable
As the rock beneath our naked feet
I hardly know you
Face to face
On the brink of the grave
I won't persuade you

Like the snowflakes we will fly
A dying dance, a silence cry
We're at the peak now
Face to face
On the brink of the grave
Don't turn around now

To step into the light
Falling down
To step into the light
Falling down

Let the moment arrive, with no more tears to cry
The spirit will wave goodbye
And step into the light

To step into the light
Falling down
To step into the light
Falling down
