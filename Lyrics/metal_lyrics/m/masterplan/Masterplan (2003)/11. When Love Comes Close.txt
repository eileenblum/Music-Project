She put a spell on him
She had his heart in her hand
And when she squeezed a litte bit too hard
She tore the boy to pieces

Looked into the mirror I was hypnotized
There was a different man
Staring back into my eyes
Went to the doctor but he could not see
Only the love of a woman would be medicine for me

I went for miles in the pouring rain
Losing her wasn't part of the game
So I took the time to look around and see
Cause there had to be a future that was meant for me

Love can take you to the sky
Love may leave you in a haze to die
And you will always know it's true
When love comes close to you

I gave away everything I had
Spent all my money, I got thirsty and mad
No life for losers when the winner steals the price
In the heartbeat of the city
I was forced to roll the dice

Love may blind you with its cry
Love can haunt you 'til the day you die
Be yourself and don't pretend
Broken hearts can always mend

Love can take you to the sky
Love may leave you in a haze to die
You will always know it's true
When love comes close to you
