Out of the womd and into the light
It comes in purity, yeah
Arrive with peace
Untouched by man's decease
Awake and not aware.... no no

Feel the soulburn
Pathfinder

They teah him right but he knows they're wrong
He sees in silence
They tell him 'stop', but he wants to move on
Spread the wings to fly them

He hopes for someday soond

And the world is like a shiny diamond
The way it glitters if you polish it right
And if the light should turn and leave you blinded
Take the dream and give it one more try

Feel the soulburn

Papa says no time to loose
Go fast if you wanna make the headline news
The road to stardom can be painful and long
In the spotlight the heat is on

You'll be playing in the fire

And the world is like a shiny diamond
The way it glitters if you polish it right
And if the light should turn and leave you blinded
There'll be treasures on the other side
And the piper will play till sundown
As the preacher prays for it to rise
And if the wind should blow and leave you stranded
Sailing ships will always pass you by

Feel the soulburn
Pathfinder
Into the storm a child is born
Pathfinder
They'll make you burn
Pathfinder

And the world is like a shiny diamond
The way it glitters if you polish it right
And if the light should turn and leave you blinded
Take the dream and give it one more try
And the piper will play till sundown
While the preacher prays for it to rise
And if the wind should blow and leave you stranded
Take a breath and give it one more try
