Inside my camera is watching
Memorizing my view of earth
And stained is the eye
Ambitions not where they should be
Out of focus - too much fantasy
Within hides the dreamer

From the north to the desert sand
Chaos disturbed the land
And revelation was left behind us
Lost without a cry
A silent lullaby
And I'm waiting - waiting for the healer

I see with bleeding eyes
I carry the world on my shoulders
The load is heavy
And it's time for an awakening
The road is long - I've been told
But I think it's short
Time goes by - and I wonder how the world is taught

From the streets of Babylon
To the sound of a modern gun
I know the story but it doesn't come clean
I'm a superskitious man - fed the neon screen
Riding on the rise of tomorrow
Fading rainbow in the eyes of sorrow
I've read the script - rehearsed the dream
Faking death at the battle scene, yeah

I wanna change it - I wanna change it
I wanna change it - And rearrange it
I wanna change it - I wanna change it

I see with bleeding eyes
I carry the world on my shoulders
The load is heavy
And it's time for an awakening
The road is long - I've been told
But I think it's short
Time goes by - and I wonder how the world is taught

From the streets of Babylon
To the sound of a modern gun
I know the story but it doesn't come clean
I'm a superskitious man - fed the neon screen
Riding on the rise of tomorrow
Fading rainbow in the eyes of sorrow
I've read the script - rehearsed the dream, yeah
Faking death at the battle scene

From the streets of Babylon
To the sound of a modern gun
I know the story but it doesn't come clean
I'm a superskitious man - fed the neon screen
Riding on the rise of tomorrow
Fading rainbow in the eyes of sorrow
I've read the script - rehearsed the dream, yeah
Faking death at the battle scene

I see with bleeding eyes
I wanna change it - I wanna change it
I carry the world on my shoulders
I wanna change it
