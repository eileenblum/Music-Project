Why - why do we turn away
When they shout that hymn
Marching so brave
Their hearts beat on holdly right
Their souls belong to those of the weak

Walking so blinded
Surrounded by brown coated lies
Hear propaganda which says
Bleed for the master race

We're not under the same nation
The past has gone - don't fear the new
It's your only chance - your only salvation

Why should we blond and blue-eyed
Chanting a 'heil' - living a lie
Evil surrounds us - we lost our way
Darkness will lead us through fire and hell

We're not waving the same flag
Or going down the same road
So use your brains - just for one time
You can't rule mankind

We're not under the same nation
The past has gone - don't fear the new
It's your only chance - your only salvation

No no we don't want it - never more
We won't take it - like before
Crystal night - never more

We're not under the same nation
The past has gone - don't fear the new
It's your only chance - your only salvation

We're not under the same nation
The past has gone - don't fear the new
It's your only chance - your only salvation

No no we don't want it - never more
We won't take it - like before
Crystal night - never more

Never more - like before
No never more
