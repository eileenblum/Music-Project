Are we caught between good and bad
It's all just said and done
Longing for a better way
The feeling is so strong

Try to mend your broken ways
Why should we live within a haze

We're the heroes of a new world
The Masterplan's rising
Send freedom all over the globe

Willing now to pay the price
Just call it by the name
Unlock the gate to paradise
It's time to stop the game

Now can we fly with broken wings
Realize we're strong like kings

We're the heroes of a new world
The Masterplan's rising and dreams will come true
Sending freedom - like a warming rain
We show you the magic you've never seen arise-above you

We must cast aside our misery
Let's search for final liberty

We're the heroes of a new world
The Masterplan's rising and dreams will come true
Sending freedom - like a warming rain
We show you the magic you've never seen arise-above you
