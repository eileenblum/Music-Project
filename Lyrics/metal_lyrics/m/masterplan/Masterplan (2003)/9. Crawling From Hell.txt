On the edge of the galaxy
In the centre of Ura
I was sent to a planet to see
The war had just started
They killed in the name of God
Creatures of the Underlord
Praying with their hands of blood
And there was no surrender

So long they waited for the secret sign
And they were branded by the mark of evil
Monsters and demons - crawling from hell

I was trapped and I could not break free
In a place full of drama
It was meant to be peaceful
But their hate flooded over
And my soul was forever torn
Baptized on battle storm
Illusion always strong
In the eyes of the pretender

So long I've waited for the secret sign
And still I'm stranded in this land of evil
Monsters and demons - crawling from hell

Monsters and demons - crawling from hell

So long they waited for the secret sign
And they were branded by the mark of evil
