As far as the eye can see sharp dressed fools with their crazy rules here
And blinding advice from all my friends reaching for perfection
I take off in the night it won't be long I'll be fighting there when dawn is breaking
Holy fire I'm not scared of you I'll take you to burn watch out for your enemy
Death can be seconds away live for now like there's no tomorrow
And forward we ride in this war like machine there'll be no returning
Holy fire I'm not scared of you I'll take you to burn oh yeah
Crimson rider I am the baron of the sky come feel the wind turn
Holy fire I'm not scared of you I'll take you to burn
Crimson rider I am the baron of the sky come feel the wind turn
And when life is evil I'll fly my wings across the sky
Is it our destiny killing our brothers
