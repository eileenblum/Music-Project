Hey yeah oh oh yeah yeah aah aah aah ah ah
I've been making progress dealing with my sin
Like a private painter a vision lies within me
The picture drawn has a dark sky but I see a glimpse of sun
My spirit's clean and I'm true to the cause
Singing for the future so my music can stay alive
I'm lonely with my demons broken is the life I knew
My love is a rock far out in the sea
And your love is the wave crashing into me yeah haa haa oh yeah
Another city to swallow floods of nature must drown this land
But I'm safe in my tower should I lend a helping hand
From the cradle pure and innocent stumbling guilty to the grave
I'll make it through 'cause I'm hungry at heart
Looking for a reason and nothing will pass me by no
Clear starlight moon is bright cold whispering winds are here
My love is a rock far out in the sea
And your love is the wave crashing back at me back at me oh yeah
Clear starlight it's heaven's fire warm cosmic winds blow there
My love is a rock far out in the sea
And your love is the wave crashing into me into me
I'm lonely with my demons cold winds blow there
