I'm wide awake with the sacred sun sending echoes out to distant places
I hear the watch ticking on your wrist sleeping beauty I could not resist you
My head is aching from yesterday feeling guilty must be on my way
There's a voice deep inside of me it took me by surprise now I know where my heart lies
I'm crawling back for my life pleading to my love I've been lost in my desire
I was drinking wasn't thinking and I'm sorry if it makes you cry oh yeah
You call me up on the telephone you say you need me 'cause you're cold and lonely
Tempted by you but I have to stay could never walk away from my girl
There's a voice deep inside of me it took me by surprise now I know where my soul lies oh yeah
A feeling I can't deny it made me realise now I know why my heart cries
Crawling back for my life begging to my love I've been lost inside the fire
I was drinking wasn't thinking and I didn't mean to make you cry
I was breaking the rule acting like a fool getting close to you to you to you
I was a chancer a fake romancer but now I know
Where my heart is true where my heart is true yeah yeah
I was breaking the rule acting like a fool getting close to you to you to you
Crawling back for my life pleading to my love I've been lost in my desire
I was drinking wasn't thinking and I'm sorry if it makes you cry
I was breaking the rule acting like a fool getting close to you to you to you
I was a chancer a fake romancer but now I'm home
Where my heart is true where my heart is true
