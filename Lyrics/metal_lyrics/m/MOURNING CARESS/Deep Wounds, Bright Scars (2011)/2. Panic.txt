The Keeper Of Madness 
Is Back Again 
ItÂ´s Impossible To Breathe 
IÂ´m Swimming Through Flames

A Mental Nightmare 
Once So Far Beyond 
The Weight Of A Thousand Burdens 
Not Able To Carry On

Here Is No Harmony, Here Is No Peace

My World Is Slowly Drowning 
Blackening My Heart 
My SoulÂ´s Possessed By Fire 
My Dreams Have Been Torn Apart

There Is Blood On My Hands 
I Confess And I Deny 
I CanÂ´t Forgive When I CanÂ´t Forget 
You`d Better Tell Me

Why â Is This Life So Confusing? 
Why â Do I Hurt Myself? 
And Why â Do I Believe All These Lies? 
Why â CanÂ´t You See The Downfall?

Can You Feel What I Feel, See What I See?

You DonÂ´t Understand Me 
Do You Care At All? 
Apparently You Feel Safe Now 
ThatÂ´s Fine, Leave Me Alone

IÂ´m Exposed To Madness 
Too Close To The Edge 
Neverending Terror 
My Soul Is A Wasteland

Here Is No Harmony, Here Is No Peace

My World Is Slowly Drowning 
Blackening My Heart 
My SoulÂ´s Possessed By Fire 
My Dreams Have Been Torn Apart

There Is Blood On My Hands 
I Confess And I Deny 
I CanÂ´t Forgive When I CanÂ´t Forget 
You`d Better Tell Me

Why â Is This Life So Confusing? 
Why â Do I Hurt Myself? 
And Why â Do I Believe All These Lies? 
Why â CanÂ´t You See The Downfall?

Here Is No Harmony, Here Is No Peace

Can You Feel What I Feel, See What I See?

There Is Blood On My Hands 
I Confess And I Deny 
I CanÂ´t Forgive When I CanÂ´t Forget 
You`d Better Tell Me

Why â Is This Life So Confusing? 
Why â Do I Hurt Myself? 
And Why â Do I Believe All These Lies? 
Why â CanÂ´t You See The Downfall?

Why?
