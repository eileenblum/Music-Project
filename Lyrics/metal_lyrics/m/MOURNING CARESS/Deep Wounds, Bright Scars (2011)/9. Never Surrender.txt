Open Your Eyes 
DonÂ´t Waste Your Time 
See The Golden Dawn 
Enchant The Sky

Please Take My Hand 
Our Time Has Come 
Today We Will Strike Back 
It Has To Be Done

Tear Down The Walls 
Break The Chains 
And Make It End 
Just Take My Hand

The SpiritÂ´s Lifted 
The Mind Is Free 
LetÂ´s Fight The Darkness 
Define Our Own Destiny

Keep Your Head Up High 
DonÂ´t Be Afraid 
DonÂ´t Spend The Time 
With Digging Your Own Grave

Tear Down The Walls 
Break The Chains 
And Make It End 
Just Take My Hand

United Marching On 
To Where Our Hearts Belong 
Together We Will Never 
Never Surrender 
United Marching On 
Forever On And On 
Together We Will Never 
Never Surrender

Yes I am Grateful 
And I Will Always Be 
It DoesnÂ´t Make Any Sense 
To Reflect About The End, I See

You Made Me What I Am 
You Told Me Never To Go Back 
And Now We Are Here 
Brave And Strong, Ready To Attack

Tear Down The Walls 
Break The Chains 
And Make It End 
Just Take My Hand

United Marching On 
To Where Our Hearts Belong 
Together We Will Never 
Never Surrender 
United Marching On 
Forever On And On 
Together We Will Never 
Never Surrender

We Will Never Surrender!
