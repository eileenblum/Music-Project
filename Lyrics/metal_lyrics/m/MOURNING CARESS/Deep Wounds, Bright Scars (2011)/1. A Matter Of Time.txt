I Am The Light And I Am The Dark
When All Hope Is Gone And Life's Forever
Forever Lost
I Will Be Heard, I Will Return
My Time Will Come
In Defiance Of A World
That Directs Me Straight Into Hell
Dancing With My Demons, Kill Them With A Smile
I Don' t Know If You' re Right Or Wrong
I Have To Cross That Line
A Matter Of Time
I Am The Light And I Am The Dark;
What Have I Done?
Pitchblack Dead Visions
So Cold, So Deep, So Pure
So Strange, So Wrong For Me
It Must Come To An End
Unchain My Power
This Life's Too Short To Simply Throw it all Away
Dancing With My Demons, Kill Them With A Smile
I Don't Know If You're Right Or Wrong
I Have To Cross That Line
A Matter Of Time
It Must Come To An End!
I Am The Light And I Am The Dark, I Am
Dancing With My Demons, Kill Them With A Smile
I Don' t Know If You' re Right Or Wrong!
I Have To Cross That Line
A Matter Of Time
Erase The Pain,.Erase The Guilt,
Erase The Pain, Erase The'Guilt
A Matter Of Time...
