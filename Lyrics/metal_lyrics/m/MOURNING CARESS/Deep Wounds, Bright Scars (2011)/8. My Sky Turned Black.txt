Welcome To My World
Welcome To The Chaos That I'm In
Hate And Denial
For Those Who Never Learn
Hate And Denial
You Seek Fire And You Will Burn
When Empathy And Dignity Are Gone
Rest Assured The Worst Is Yet To Come
Look Into My Eyes, Can You See The Flames Of Hate?
Look Into My Eyes, I Swear You'll Have To Pay
Oh, How I Like To See You Bleed
I Can't Describe This Feeling
My Anger Is Growing Constantly
There Is No Turning Back
No Turning Back!
Hate And Denial
For Those Who Never Learn
Hate And Denial
You Seek Fire And You Will Burn
When Empathy And Dignity Are Gone
Rest Assured The Worst Is Yet To Come
Look Into My Eyes, Can You See The Flames Of Hate?
I'll Show No Mercy,!No Fear, No Compromise
No Mercy! No Fear! No Compromise!
Hate And Denial
For Those Who Never Learn
Hate And Denial
You Seek Fire And You Will Burn
