Down Below
I Wander
Needing Silence And Peace
My Body Lies Broken
My Flesh Is So Weak
Another Day, Another Struggle
It's Just Another Day
Another Day, Another Struggle
It's Just Another;Day
I Shade My Eyes
Forsaken
Confusion Leads The Way
From Sunrise To Sunset
Misguided
Will This Torture Ever;End?
Another Day, Another Struggle
It's Just Another Day
Another Day, Another Struggle
It's Just Another Day
Sadness Invites Me And The Suffering Continues
Will You Ever See Me Bleeding?
Madness Controls Me And The Suffering Continues
Will You Ever Free Me?
Will You Ever Heal Me?
You Turn Away, I'm Bleeding
You Turn Away, I' m Bleeding
I Still Don't Know How To Carry On
You Turn Away, I'm Bleeding
You Turn Away, I'm Bleeding
You've Been Waiting Far Too Long
Another Day, Another Struggle
It's Just Another Day
Another Day, Another Struggle
It's Just Another Day
