And Here I Am
Crawling Into Darkness
Fade Away
In The Arms Of Desolation
To Stay
Creeping On The Edge Ready To Fall
Insecurity And Death
Aren't You Afraid
To Lose It All?
The Sun
The Moon
Prepare To Fall
Staring, Staring Into The Abyss
Staring, Staring lnto The Abyss
I Am Staring Into The Abyss
Staring... Into The Abyss
Perishing Cold, Infinite Fade Away
In The Arms Of Desperation
To Stay
Pale Light Interferes The Dark
As A Spark Of Light Enters My Heart
Aren't You Afraid
To Lose It All?
The Sun
The Moon
Prepare To Fall
Staring, Staring Into The Abyss
Staring. Staring Into The Abyss
I Am Staring Into The Abyss
Staring...Into The Abyss
Into Isolation, Dust And Decay
Into Isolation, Dust And Decay
Staring, Staring Into The Abyss
...Into The Abyss
