Wastelands Within

It Is The Pain That Led Me Here 
It Is The Pain That Kills Me 
These Tears Will Never Dry

The Siege On What We Hold So Dear 
It Is The Pain That Kills Me 
I Raise My Hands To The Sky

ItÂ´s In Our Nature To Destroy 
We Are The Ones To Blame 
Eternally Follow The Rain

Break Down And Build Anew 
Break Down And Build Anew

Wastelands Within 
A Price To Pay 
An Everlasting Strive For A Change 
Wastelands Within 
Stranded In A Lost World 
This Neverending Pain In Our Hearts

As The Flesh To The Sun 
The Weakness Of One 
A Curse Of The Ages 
To Never Be Gone 
To The End Of All That Brought Me Here 
I See The Snake In The Sand 
This Losing Battle 
Against Myself

Wastelands Within 
A Price To Pay 
An Everlasting Strive For A Change 
Wastelands Within 
Stranded In A Lost World 
This Neverending Pain In Our Hearts

Everlasting

Wastelands Within 
A Price To Pay 
An Everlasting Strive For A Change 
Wastelands Within 
Stranded In A Lost World 
This Neverending Pain In Our Hearts
