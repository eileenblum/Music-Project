Once And For All I Make It End
Once And For All I Spit It Out
I Bury The Guilt, Good-Bye Insanity
What Will Become Of Me?
I Bury The Fear, Hello Melancholy
What Will Be Left Of Me?
Torture, Pressure, Pain
Repeating Day By Day
And Once Again I Make It End
And Once Again I Spit It Out
My Love's Eternal, The Curse Is Dead
Let' s Face Forever And A Day
Any Burden I Carry For You
To The Edge Of The World
Filling The Emptiness
Is All I Can Do
