I let loose reality one more time
In the dark it's so easy to hide
I driftaway and see you
Coming into my life
Bringing back this guiding light
And all the grey is fading away

The sun sets down
I am awaiting the night
You make mee feel
You make me feel alive
I am able to forget the pain
To move on such a different way
But I am all alone
Until you feed my dreams

I am too tired to grasp the light
I will be left behind
Strong but weak
Only for your heart I seek
It's all so senseless
It's every time the same I fall
To rise and fall again
Pushed back into madness
My thoughts they cause this pain
I need your healing hand on me
And all the grey is fading away

The sun sets down
I am awaiting the night
You make mee feel
You make me feel alive
I am able to forget the pain
To move on such a different way
But I am all alone
Until you feed my dreams

And all the grey is fading away

The sun sets down
I am awaiting the night
You make mee feel
You make me feel alive
I am able to forget the pain
To move on such a different way
But I am all alone
Until you feed my dreams

The sun sets down
I am awaiting the night
You make mee feel
You make me feel alive
I am able to forget the pain
I am able to forget the pain
