Close to oblivion I was
Endeavoured to make a change
This legacy of broken faith
On which I've to build my world
What a glorious fuck is it
In which I'm stuck right now
Searching for the origin
I don't have to look far

No, it's right beside me
Is just so close
I can feel your heart beating
Oh no, It's right beside me
Is just so close
I can feel your heart beating

Towards the decline of existence
A hierarchy of ruin
I'm caught beteween love and hate
A hierarchy of ruin
Straight into the realm of the lost souls
A hierarchy of ruin
What the hell have you done to me
A hierarchy of ruin

Running, tumbling, falling down
This is the way our life's to go
We living, dying, to be forgotten
That's the way and there's nothing to change
The end it seems so near
My hopes begin leaving me
Nothing's like before
Soon you will feel it too

At last you turn your back on me
And found your luck in another's heart
My thoughts kill every dream in me
I'm floating in life's hopeless stream
Floating on and on

Towards the decline of existence
A hierarchy of ruin
I'm caught beteween love and hate
A hierarchy of ruin
Straight into the realm of the lost souls
A hierarchy of ruin
What the hell have you done to me
A hierarchy of ruin
