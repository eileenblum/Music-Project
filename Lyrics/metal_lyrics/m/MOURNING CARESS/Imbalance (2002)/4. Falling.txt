Do you feel the same
Like I do know lost all belief
Can't stop the fall
Do you  pierce them with your eyes
With your eyes
Everything in life now has gone wrong
Eyes closed - I better hide
Not run, I can't accept this any longer

Nothing, nothing can make me stay as no one
No one can feel this pain
I just tried to taste a piece of heaven

I am falling again
Dying inside
I am falling again
Dying inside

Get out of my way
Don't want to hear another lie
All your stupid words I deny

Nothing, nothing can make me stay as no one
No one can feel this pain
I just tried to taste a piece of heaven

I am falling again
Dying inside
I am falling again
Dying inside

For most of the time
I wonder what am I doing here
For most of the time
I see darkness
And live in in fear

For most of the time
I wonder what am I doing here
For most of the time
I see darkness
And live in in fear

What I am doing here
I see darkness
And live in in fear

I am falling again
Dying inside
I am falling again
Dying inside
