I'm on my way down to no-man's-land
But still you ask me who I am!
I am the sadness
The one who's counting all your tears
The desperation
I am constant, I never dissapear
I am the pain
Watch me crawling from behind

I am insane
...And I follow the rain

Say what you want
I still believe in sadness
You can go on
I'll wait here drowned in madness

I am the darkness
You are longing for my embrace
I am the suffering
Penetrating your soul forever
I am the madness
Making you cry before my eyes

I am insane
...And I follow the rain

Say what you want
I still believe in sadness
You can go on
I'll wait here drowned in madness

Still you ask me who I am
Say what you want
I still believe in sadness
You can go on
I'll wait here drowned in madness
