Save me from myself

Could you please explain this word
To me it's confusing, It's so unreal
My answer to this chaos is devastate it all

Take me as I am and lead me into frustration

Hey my friend you better think twice
It is no game, it's your life
Bloodshed is what I like
Remember this is your life
In the end you are always wiser
But this pure aggression
Takes me higher and higher

Take me as I am and lead me into damnation

Being my own master
Creating a hell
Being my own saviour
Creating a hell
Being my own God
Creating a hell
Being my own slave
Creating a hell

Sometimes I close my eyes
See burning bodies, a burning sky
I can't find the peace of my mind
Seasons they'll never change
As long as blood is pumping
In my veins eveything dies

Take me as I am and lead me into damnation

Being my own master
Creating a hell
Being my own saviour
Creating a hell
Being my own God
Creating a hell
Being my own slave
Creating a hell

My own master
My own saviour
My own God
My own slave

Being my own master
Creating a hell
Being my own saviour
Creating a hell
Being my own God
Creating a hell
Being my own slave
Creating a hell
