Welcome to my life
Despair is all you find
Welcome to my life
I know that I am wrong
And this way it can't go on
I know that I am wrong

So take my hand Lady
Show me around, make me bleed
Soon I'll understand maybe
That only with pain this life's complete
And still there is no end in sight

Day by day dying for another soul
Screams piercing the night
This cold and riniy place
I only want to leave
Screams piercing the night

So take my hand Lady
Show me around, make me bleed
Soon I'll understand maybe
That only with pain this life's complete

Getting used
I'm getting used to it
I'm Getting tired
I'm getting tired to it

Nowhere to go
It's far too late for me
No dream came true
Don't you understand
At least I have to try
To run into the light
And to take away this chain
Take it away

Would you please take it away

Nowhere to go
It's far too late for me
No dream came true
Don't you understand
At least I have to try
To run into the light
And to take away this chain
