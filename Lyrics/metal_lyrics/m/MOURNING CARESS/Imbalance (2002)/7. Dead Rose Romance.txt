Why do you look at me as if I failed
I've done everything that I could do
Don't you think
That this dream here died too young
The source of life for me is you and only you

One last time I touch your skin
And bury this rose deep inside of me
So much is broken, maybe too much to go on
A hole so deep, maybe too deep to breathe

Dead rose romance
The end of all my dreams
I suffer day and night
My life is lost, yes, so it seems
Dead rose romance
The end of all my dreams
I suffer day and night
My life is lost, yes, so it seems

Where is the fire in my heart
I'm tumbling completely torn apart
Still I'm falling and falling into your arms
I'm only dreaming and dreaming of your love, of your love

Bury this rose, come on
Bury this rose, yes, bury this rose
Bury this rose in me
As I touch your skin
Bury this rose deep inside of me
So much is broken, maybe too much to go on
A hole so deep, maybe too deep to breathe

Bury this rose
Bury this rose
