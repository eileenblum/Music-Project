When darkness conquers everything in me
And impossible thoughts destroying my mind
I will never get down
I'll never surrender
It's a raging storm
But I stand tight

Is there a sense in life
To be and not to die?
Is there a sense in life
To be and to survive
A simple sense in life? No!
It's hard to be alone again and agian
I hunt the shadows in the night

My hope dies at last
I found the lost path
I leave you now
My hope dies at last

Is there a sense in life
To be and to survive
A simple sense in life? No!
It's hard to be alone again and agian
I hunt the shadows in the night

My hope dies at last
I found the lost path
I leave you now
My hope dies at last

It takes my heart
It takes my soul
It's killing me
It takes my heart
It takes my soul
It's killing me

My heart, my soul
My heart, my soul

Vaya con dios, amigo!   (Spanish: Go with God, My friend!)
A part of me is dying
But the others reaches for your hand
Soon another night takes place
For this ordinary day
Nothing happened
Nothing that would make me smile

My hope dies at last
I found the lost path
I leave you now
My hope dies at last
