Now as I sit here fragile
And watch my memories pass
Where is the sun?
Where are the stars?

My eyes staring down at this thing
Remembering me and you
Was it heaven or was it hell
That I went through

A lifeless time
A lifeless time
Is when you love me and I ignore it
Is when I love you and you don't feel it
Anymore like the sun
Went down forever emptiness

You may speak words of truth
But they mean nothing to me
I reach out for the dark
This is where I can see

And if I should paint a picture
It would be full of dying art
I don't know what can heal my suffering heart
Right now I really don't know!
I really don't know!
I don't know!

...And the rain keeps on falling down on me!
Loneliness dying art
Emptiness fills my heart

A lifeless time
A lifeless time
Is when you love me and I ignore it
Is when I love you and you don't feel it
Anymore like the sun
Went down forever emptiness
