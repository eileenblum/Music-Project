Caught outside
World isolated
As life slips slowly out of my hands

I can't take it
I can't take it
I can't take it
I can't take it

No more

It's within me, it's within you
It's the thorn of life
That pulls us through
It's within me, it's within you
It's the thorn of life
That pulls us through
Inner exile, inner exile
Within me, inner exile
Inner exile, within you

Too much noise surrounding me
My body is getting weak
I don't want to talk
I drift away

Locked inside
World isolated
Penetration of my soul
Fragile I am
Fragile I fly

I fly

It's within me, it's within you
It's the thorn of life
That pulls us through
It's within me, it's within you
It's the thorn of life
That pulls us through
Inner exile, inner exile
Within me, inner exile
Inner exile, within you
