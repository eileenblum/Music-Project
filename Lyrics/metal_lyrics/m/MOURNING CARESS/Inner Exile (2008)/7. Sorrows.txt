Sorrows
Another withered day embraces the night
Sorrows
Emotions stripped, my decline
Sorrows
A moment blurred obscures my mind
Sorrows
This well known feeling, I resign

I cannot move, I cannot hide
These thoughts are killing me, am I alive
I cannot move, I cannot hide
If this is my place I wonder why
In this life I cannot rest
My tortured soul is all alive
In this life I seem to forget
That there is something, the other side

I cannot move, I cannot hide
These thoughts are killing me, am I alive
Sorrows, sorrows, sorrows
If this is my place I wonder why
In this life I cannot rest
My tortured soul is all alive
In this life I seem to forget
That there is something, the other side

It is the fear that pulls me under
The insanity
The insanity that feed my demons
Sick fantasies

Where do I come from?
Where do I go?
Illuminate, show me the way to go

In this life I cannot rest
My tortured soul is all alive
In this life I seem to forget
That there is something, the other side
