I know that there is hope
In this world of mine
My heart is beating
Onwards I crawl

Take away the sadness, take away the fear
Whatever may come, may come
Why should I give away my dreams?
Yes, my eyes look empty, afraid, full of tears
But I do trust in better days
Yes, I do trust

In my life, shadows gone
Precious world, you are my life
In this world of mine you are

Brighter than the fire I burn
Higher than the clouds I reach
Out there somebody's waiting
Somebody to collect our tears

Take away the sadness, take away the fear
Whatever may come, may come
Why should I give away my dreams?
Yes, my eyes look empty, afraid, full of tears
But I do trust in better days
Yes, I do trust

In my life, shadows gone
Precious world, you are my life
In this world of mine you are
