Turn around look into my eyes
Can't you see how I feel?
Can't you see this slow demise?

And behind my eyes chaos rules my world
And behind my eyes the flame refuses to burn

Well, this is the end
Tell me this is the end of it now

Well, I've lost my way
Madness spreads within my soul
I am sick I've lost control
Well, I've lost my way
There is nothing more to hide
'Cause it's too deep
Too deep inside

Like I can see myself
Feel pity for the weak
Like I begin to fall
And never hit the ground
I start to scream
Sanity for sale

Well, this is the end
Tell me this is the end of it now

Well, I've lost my way
Madness spreads within my soul
I am sick I've lost control
Well, I've lost my way
There is nothing more to hide
'Cause it's too deep
Too deep inside

Shall I go forward
Shall I go back
A living target to attack
Aiming high but feeling low
It's not over, it happens now

Turn around now

Well, I've lost my way
Madness spreads within my soul
I am sick I've lost control
Well, I've lost my way
There is nothing more to hide
'Cause it's too deep
Too deep inside
