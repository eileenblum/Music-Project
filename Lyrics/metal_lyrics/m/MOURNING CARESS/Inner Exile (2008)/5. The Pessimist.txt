What a fantastic place to let myself go
To torture the body, to torture the soul
On and on into veiling visions
On and on and I close my eyes
I am the fallen one

Devastation, termination is what I see
Backwards into isolation
I kill myself, I am free
Devastation, termination is what I see
Backwards into isolation
The pessimist it's me

In self pity I will drown forever
It's the easiest way for me
To continue life I count to zero
Looking never forward, looking ever back

I cannot change it
I cannot change my life

Here I'm standing, all on my own
It is my will, my choice, why carry on
Here I'm drowning, still on my own
It is my will, my choice, why carry on

Devastation, termination is what I see
Backwards into isolation
I kill myself, I am free
Devastation, termination is what I see
Backwards into isolation
The pessimist it's me

Backwards into isolation
Devastation, termination
Backwards into isolation
The pessimist, it's me
