Bright and tearful eyes
Pretending it's all right
Never turn the inside out
Every single word is in doubt

These words they have no meaning
This world it has no meaning
I swear I tried

These bitter moments
Oh how sweet they are
Darkest hours, life is cold, cold as ice
A future still uncertain
My pounding heart, solutions none
In search for the green eternal
Shores of unknown land

These words they have no meaning
This world it has no meaning
I swear I tried

My hope close to collapse
My dreams close to collapse
I am close, so close

These words they have no meaning
This world it has no meaning
I swear I tried

My hope close to collapse
My dreams close to collapse
My hope, my dreams
