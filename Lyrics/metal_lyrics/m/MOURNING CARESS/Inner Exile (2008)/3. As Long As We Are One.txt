The affiliation, unknown intensity
Together into the sunlight, this is our destiny

Great assembly, time to inhale
We won't suffer any more
In search for different ways
This creed in our hearts
As long as we are one

A constellation, made for eternity
My life grows safe in your hands
This is our destiny

Great assembly, time to inhale
We won't suffer any more
In search for different ways
This creed in our hearts
As long as we are one

As long as we are one

One

The affiliation, I'd die for you
The intensity, this is our destiny

Great assembly, time to inhale
We won't suffer any more
In search for different ways
This creed in our hearts
As long as we are one

One
