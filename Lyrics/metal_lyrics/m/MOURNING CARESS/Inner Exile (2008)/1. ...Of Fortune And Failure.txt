Sometimes I close my eyes
To reconsider what I've done
The waste of time comes to my mind
Helpless
I draw the final line to carry on
Salvation
Once again my confidence is gone
Once again I'm struggling
For a silent whisper

I need you, I trust in you
This is the only way to be
Of fortune and failure
Of fortune and failure

Flowers turn to dust in my hands
Millions of colours turn into gray
My heart is straining, full of rage
My hands are trembling
What's coming next?

Once more I return
To question all that I have done
You know the meaning of my words
Don't you
The desperate longing for a change
Worthless
Once again my confidence is gone
Once again I'm struggling
For a silent whisper

I need you, I trust in you
This is the only way to be
Of fortune and failure
Of fortune and failure
