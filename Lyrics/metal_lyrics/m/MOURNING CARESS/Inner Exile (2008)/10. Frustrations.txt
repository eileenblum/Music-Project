Deep down, deep down into nothingness
To seek the weakest heart of all
Deep down, deep down into emptiness
To see the bravest fall

What is the essence of our lives?
Forever torn apart

To win a battle we are too weak
Without a single word we try to speak

Open your eyes

Frustrations breed within
First they break your bones
Then they slowly burn your skin
Frustrations breed within
First they break your bones
Then they slowly burn your skin

Deep down, deep down into weariness
Where the pain is everlasting
Deep down, deep down into loneliness
To kiss the joy of life goodbye

What is the essence of our lives?
Forever torn apart
Torn apart

Frustrations breed within
First they break your bones
Then they slowly burn your skin
Frustrations breed
Frustrations breed within
Frustrations breed
Frustrations
