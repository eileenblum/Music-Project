As life turns in circles
I am dead again
Believe me, here is nowhere
We are lost again

A feeling gone, like in the past
Nothing has been done

Today I bleed myself dry
Until I am dust again
Tomorrow I watch myself cry
Until we are dust again

A feeling gone, like in the past
Nothing has been done

I take my last, I take my last
I take my last chance
To make myself clear that I am

A moment of illusive sanity makes me wonder
Makes me think I'm free
A moment of purest clarity
Occasionally I try to rescue me

A feeling gone, like in the past
Nothing has been done

I take my last, I take my last
I take my last chance
To make myself clear that I am

I take my last, I take my last
I take my last chance
To make myself clear that I am

I take my last, I take my last
I take my last chance
To make myself clear that I am
