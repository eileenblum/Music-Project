If I tell anyone who you are
They will run
And they'll keep running
And one day
You're fine
And the next you're gone
Multiply it by infinity
And take it to the deep of forever
And you still have
And you still have
Every bone six feet under the ground
I've seen it in silence
Now their crosses
Now their crosses buried in
Buried in green
But they will run again
They will run again
From you
From you
From you
(But they will run again)
If I tell anyone who you are
They will run
And they'll keep running
