tunnels crossing in diferent directions,
it's never seen, it's all so thin,
different matches and over created back lashes and white big nails,
I succeed where no one fails.

soft as cotton, take me under,
a thought about life and death and how sad it is.

some achieve a stamp in world humanity,
there's no other way keep on attempting,
on the top there's a place for all of us,

but the sky is not smilling.
where do we begin?
it's all good,
and we'll finally be there,
where do I find all that makes no sense
