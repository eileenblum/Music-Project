Yes I got you here my friend
I know you're down
But we said forever
We close our eyes
We close our...
We freeze and travel somewhere else

We're laughing while we're facing death
We're facing death for the first time
We're laughing while we're facing decay
we're facing death for the first time
Sparrows are flying again

The world's a stage
Acting makes everything clear
It takes just a second to ruin the play

Yes I got you here my friend
I know you're down
But we said forever
We close our eyes
We close our...
We freeze and travel somewhere else

Sparrows are flying my friend
They're looking for
Slitted wrists with broken glass
And drops of blood
To track us here and take our hearts

The world's a stage
But we said forever
The world's a stage (the world's a stage)
But we said forever (on a trip to goth' am city)
But we said forever (on a trip to goth' am city)
(But we said forever)
