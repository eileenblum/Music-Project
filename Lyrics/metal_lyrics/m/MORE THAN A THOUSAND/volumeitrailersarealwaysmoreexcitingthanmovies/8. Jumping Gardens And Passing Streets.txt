Scouts search too far
Fall
Wait
Bright marks forming into e's
Waiting
Watching icebergs melt outside
And I am thinking about going out
Black and red
Bi-colored streets
I'm wondering where this town ends and the next one begins
The roads we follow never end
I wonder when you're alone
If you're really as high as a cloud
Or your heart comes undone without mend
I wonder when you're alone
If you're really as high as a cloud
Or your heart comes undone without mend
Scouts search too far
Fall
Wait
Bright marks forming into e's
Waiting
Watching icebergs melt outside
And I am thinking about going out
