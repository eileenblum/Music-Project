She was sitting,
Where you belong.
I'm in a body
Surrounded by some ghosts and vultures
It reminds me of heaven
I vanish as days pass

Beside your corpse
I found a bottle of lye
Looking in your eyes like I never did before

Now it's late
Now it's late
Now it's late

They said
They said
She died, she died, she died of a
She died, she died, she died of a
She died of a broken heart
She died of a broken heart

Leaving dreams behind
I felt stings
You were by my side
And I woke up with a rope around the neck
Leaving dreams behind
I felt stings
You were by my side
And I woke up with a roupe around the neck

With a rope around the neck
With a rope around the neck
With a rope around the neck
With a rope around the neck

And they said
And they said
And they said
And they said

And they said
"the beautiful faces hide witches"
