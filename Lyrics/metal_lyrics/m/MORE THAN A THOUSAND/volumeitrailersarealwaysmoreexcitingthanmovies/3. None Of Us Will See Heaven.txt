My dreams ink printed on white paper
No one wants to hear, read, sing.

Beside these buried coffins, I'm alone
Alone like all of them
And I'm running, and I'm keeping a secret they all (want to know)
Beside tthese buried coffins, I'm alone
Alone like all of them
And I'm running, somewhere...

I'm leaving this hell
I'm leaving this hell
I can't be stuck here any longer
Someone better pull me out

I think I (Thank God)
Committed a crime (Thank God)
For a day or two
And I think I committed a crime
I think I (Thank God)
Committed a crime (Thank God)
For a day or two
And I think I committed a crime

Beside these buried coffins, I'm alone
Alone like all of them
And I'm running, and I'm keeping a secret they all (want to know)
Beside tthese buried coffins, I'm alone
Alone like all of them
And I'm running, somewhere...
