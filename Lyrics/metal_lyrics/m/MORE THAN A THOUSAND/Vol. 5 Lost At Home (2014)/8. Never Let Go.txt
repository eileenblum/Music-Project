As the day light dies
They all fall asleep
Darkness over light
You're all doomed
We cannot sleep at night
We won't fear death, we're afraid of not living enough
Run

Till a cross do us part
The sun turns black
Will death never go away?
Stand your ground

Every man woman and child
Don't fall asleep
Take cover
There is no hope for anyone

Live like there is no tomorrow
We cannot sleep at night
No hope!
Don't let go don't leave me alone

We'll get lost in dark
Rip the skin from our bones
Bury me by your side
We love live and we die but we we'll never let go
We will never let you go
We'll never leave you, we'll never die

Stand your ground

Every man woman and child
Don't fall asleep
Take cover
There is no hope for anyone

Live like there is no tomorrow
We cannot sleep at night
No hope!
Don't let go don't leave me alone

We'll get lost in dark
Rip the skin from our bones
Bury me by your side
We love live and we die but we we'll never let you go
A promise to our hearts to keep
We'll never leave you, we'll never die
We won't let you go

(Don't let go)

We'll get lost in dark
Rip the skin from our bones
Bury me by your side
We love live and we die but we we'll never let you go
A promise to our hearts to keep
Never let go
