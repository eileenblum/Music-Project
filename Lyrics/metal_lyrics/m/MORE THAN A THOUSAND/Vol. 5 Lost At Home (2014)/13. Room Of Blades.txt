We are the hollow
We are the dead
Won't stop until you bleed
We stand together
We are forever
We are the new breed

Kill or be killed
In this room of blades you're better off dead
Kill or be killed
We won't remember your name
I know all your fucking secrets
You stand alone, your on your own
Slit your wrists, we don't give a fuck

You hate it all, you want it all
You're fucking everything that we stand for
Now you know what it's like to die alone

You can say what you want it won't change anything
Won't change a thing in me
You should try to do better than that
You can say what you want
Won't change anything
Press that knife against your chest

We are the hollow
We are the dead
Won't stop until you bleed
We stand together
We are forever
We are the new breed

I wish you happily ever after in death
We won't remember you name
Kill or be killed
In this room of blades you're better off dead
Now you'll know what its like to die alone

You can say what you want
It won't change anything
Press that knife against your chest

We are the hollow
We are the dead
Won't stop until you bleed
We stand together
We are forever
We are the new breed

Mark my words you'll get no mercy
Fuck you
You're fighting a losing battle
You'll get no mercy
You're fighting a losing battle

Better turn yourself into a wolf
Say what you want, we'll never fall
Your scars won't heal
In a hail of bullets
Where we live, where the nights grow cold
But you don't care at all
It's hell until I say it's over
It's gonna be hell until I say it's over

We are the hollow
We are the dead
Won't stop until you bleed
We stand together
We are forever
We are the new breed

Kill or be killed
In this room of blades you're better off dead
