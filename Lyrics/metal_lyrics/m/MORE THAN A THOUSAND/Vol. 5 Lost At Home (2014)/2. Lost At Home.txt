I know exactly what you are
Eyes so cold they cut through the bone
No emotion, explosion, you're death
I know exactly what you want

Send my heart away anywhere but here
Fuck this shit you don't understand
Get it?! We're not the same
Devil. Arms of the dead

After the wave here comes the shark
You will never get me out alive
But how do I know if I'm still awake?
I said I'd be here forever
We were trapped in this together
The wolves are at your gate
Send my heart away anywhere but here

Is this the place you call home?
Have I been sleeping all this long?
My blood runs cold, my heart is gone
Get me out of your casket

I know exactly what you are
No emotion, explosion, you're death
For once in my life let me live

After the wave here comes the shark
You will never get me out alive
But how do I know if I'm still awake?
I said I'd be here forever
We were trapped in this together
The wolves are at your gate
Send my heart away anywhere but here

Let me sail away into the arms of the dead
For once let me breathe
Let me sail away into the arms of the dead
For once let me live

After the wave here comes the shark
You will never get me out alive
But how do I know if I'm still awake?
I said I'd be here forever
We were trapped in this together
The wolves are at your gate
Send my heart away anywhere but here

No glory. No second chance
You can search until the end of time
I'm sorry no second chance
