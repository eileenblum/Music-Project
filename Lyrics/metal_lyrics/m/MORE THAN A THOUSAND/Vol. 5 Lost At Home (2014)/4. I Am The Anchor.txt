Never a failure, always a lesson
Somehow you always knew the right thing to say
Where were you when I was lost?
You let go too fast
I kept following the sound till the point of no return

I've wasted all my time with you
Every step you take, it's another mistake
How could I be so wrong?

Another wasted night
I guess I always knew it was all your fault
I'm done with you

I am the anchor that will bring you down
We're all going down
Not much you can do when you're weightless
Let's stop wasting time it's a deadly fight, we all go under
Not much you can do when you're weightless

After all the things you've put me through
How could I spend my days with you?
I should've known you're not what you seem
I will be there to watch you fall

I am the anchor that will bring you down
We're all going down
Not much you can do when you're weightless
Let's stop wasting time it's a deadly fight, we all go under
Not much you can do when you're weightless

Your lies weren't good enough to make me stay
Try to turn the tide

I am the anchor that will bring you down
We're all going down
Not much you can do when you're weightless
Let's stop wasting time it's a deadly fight, we all go under
Not much you can do when you're weightless
