We won't live forever
But we're not fucking dead
You did all this so die with it
Nail up the coffin
Bury us now
You name is the first at the top of our list
You know we'll never be afraid
We've been hiding in the shadow for a long time
You know we'll never be afraid
Your name is the first at the top of our list

You've got a date with fate
We just can't wait, we'll cast you away
You've got a date with fate
We just can't wait, we'll cast you away

We'll never trust you again
You're everything that we stand against
This wasn't the first, it won't be the last
How many times can you die in my fucking heart?

We will make the stars bleed tonight
We will make the stars bleed tonight

We won't live forever
But we're still not fucking dead
You did all this so die with it
Nail up the coffin
Bury us now
You name is the first at the top of our list
We wish you the best
Die with the rest

Raise your fucking hands and sing with me
Pick up the flow
Don't die on me now
No mercy for the weak
Pick up the flow
Don't die on me now
No mercy for the weak
Pick up the flow
Don't die on me now
No mercy for the weak
Oh, no mercy for the weak

You've got a date with fate
We just can't wait, we'll cast you away
We just can't wait, we'll cast you away

We'll never trust you again
You're everything that we stand against
This wasn't the first, it won't be the last
How many times can you die in my fucking heart?

We will make the star bleed tonight
We won't live forever
