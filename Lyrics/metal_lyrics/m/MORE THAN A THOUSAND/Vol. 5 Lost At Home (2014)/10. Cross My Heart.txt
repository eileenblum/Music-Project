We've been lost, we've been found
We are meant to be so much more
Bring me faith, give me hope
We are meant to be so much more

Is there still something worth fighting for?
I still remember when we had everything to lose

Is this what I've been searching for?
Your eyes tell me more than I need to know
My regrets are nothing new to you

I wanna know
Will I get something from your cold dead lips?
When did you become so fucking empty?
My love is lost
You're better off dead
You became everything I hate
You're fucking dead to me
Every part inside of me knows there's nothing left worth fighting for
Is this a drunk love song?
You became everything I hate

Bring me faith, give me hope
We are meant to be so much more

Is this what I've been searching for?
Your eyes tell me more than I need to know
My regrets are nothing new to you
We both know that everything you did was wrong
Your eyes tell me more than I need to know

You will be the death of me

Cross my heart and hope to die
We'll never change, this is who we are

Is this what I've been searching for?
Your eyes tell me more than I need to know
My regrets are nothing new to you
We both know that everything you did was wrong
Your eyes tell me more than I need to know
