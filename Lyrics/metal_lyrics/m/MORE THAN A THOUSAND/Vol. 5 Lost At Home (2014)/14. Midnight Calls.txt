It's early morning
The night is asleep
It's dark outside
Stars light up the street
I watch the world from a far

Nights of fear when our hearts are in love
Lies and lust
I guess they're not enough
The smell of our dead skin
Lost in our midnight calls

I remember the night we fucked a thousand times
You tied me up to your bed of shattered broken glass
Darkness falls into the night
Darkness falls into your eyes
The sound of a gun from the tip of your tongue
You've got a fire inside
But you can't keep me away

Together we learn, together we fight
Together we bur, together we die

It's hot and cold
We're moving slow
It's hot and fast, I will not rest
When your heart races faster than light, you're the one that makes me feel alive

Together we learn, together we fight
Together we bur, together we die

It's hot and cold
We're moving slow
It's hot and fast, I will not rest
When your heart races faster than light, you're the one that makes me feel alive

We're moving
We're moving slow
