Shut your mouth
Swallow your words
I don't really feel them
I could never rely on you
Cause you decide what is true
I know I'm better than you
I stay true to what I believe in
Your blood runs cold your heart is stone
My love is gone

You've cut my throat and watched me bleed
I'll never say never, ever again
You kept me alive but not under your chest
I am more than you think

Bite your tongue, swallow your poison
You had my voice under arrest
You love when you hate it
Nothing will save you
What I gave you threw away

You're loving every minute of it
You left your scar
Everything you do turns out the wrong way
You've got a lot to say
Act like you have nothing to lose
That's something you will never change
My heart has no room for liars

You've cut my throat and watched me bleed
I'll never say never, ever again
You kept me alive but not under your chest
I am more than you think

Bite your tongue, swallow your poison
You had my voice under arrest
You love when you hate it
Nothing will save you
What I gave you threw away

Bite your tongue, swallow your poison
You had my voice under arrest
You love when you hate it
Nothing will save you
What I gave you threw it all away
You threw it all away

This is a war I've dying to start
The time has come give me your best shot
Give me your best shot now

Bite your tongue, swallow your poison
You had my voice under arrest
You love when you hate it
Nothing will save you
What I gave you threw away

What I gave you threw it all away
I gave you all, you fucking whore!
