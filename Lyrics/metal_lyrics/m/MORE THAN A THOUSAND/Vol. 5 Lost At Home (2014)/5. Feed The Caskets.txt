Stay the fuck away from me!
9,10 never sleep again
How the fuck did I end up like this?
Back from the dead
Your demons keep crawling under my skin
9,10 never sleep again

It seems that I can't escape this place
How can I kill the noise?
This war is yours to lose
Supposed to love it not leave it
Instead of loving it you've killed it but I refuse to die
Stay the fuck away from me

We're supposed to be together now and forever for better or for worse

I thought I'd leave this war without a scar but I'm burning faster than a shooting star
And I've been thinking, I guess I always knew just who we are
I'll take our secrets to the grave
I never knew it was already late
You played your part again
I swear I leave this war without a scar

I'm sure tonight we'll burn in hell
9,10 never close my eyes again
I feel something is missing and still you never listen but I refuse to die
(1,2,3,4) I was left for dead but my motherfucking heart is still alive
You couldn't care any less
I will never forget until the day I die
You can't destroy me

I thought I'd leave this war without a scar but I'm burning faster than a shooting star
And I've been thinking, I guess I always knew just who we are
I'll take our secrets to the grave
I never knew it was already late
You played your part again
I swear I leave this war without a scar

Stay the fuck away from me!
You can't destroy me
