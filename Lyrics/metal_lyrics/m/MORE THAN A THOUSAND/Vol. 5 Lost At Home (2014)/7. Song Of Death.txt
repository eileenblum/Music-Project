Our time is now
This is what we have to say to you
We'll be remembered by those who won't fucking quit
Find your place in the world because we will never fall

All we hear are echos from your fucking voice
You don't know nothing about us we won't back down
We'll keep singing along because our hearts beat free
Go dig your grave

This is all we have to say to you
W'll be remembered by those who won't fucking quit
Find your place in the world because we will never fall
Find your place in the world because we won't fall
Redeem yourself
Ignorance is a bliss
Don't live with hate, die in love
Sing the song of death if your forever means a second
You should know that we always protect our own

Get up, Get out
We are together
You will slowly choke on poison
You will slowly drown in your words
Get up, get out
We'll live forever
You will slowly choke on poison
You can say what you want
We'll never hit the ground

All we hear is wolves
Crying for a winning fight
All we hear is wolves but no wolf walks alone at night
You're doomed
no wolf walks alone at night
You're doomed

Get up, Get out
We are together
You will slowly choke on poison
You will slowly drown in your words
Get up, get out
We'll live forever
You will slowly choke on poison
You can say what you want
We'll never hit the ground

Open you eyes
You're not alive
If you can't live with yourself if you're dying to breathe
Open your eyes
You're not alive
If you can't live with yourself if you're dying to breathe

This is all we have to say to you
We'll be remembered by those who wont fucking quit
Find you're place in the world because we will never fall
Find your place in the world because we won't fall
Redeem yourself
Ignorance is a bliss.
