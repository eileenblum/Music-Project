Fuck the world
There's not a day that I don't think of you
You'll be waiting at the gates of hell
You've always understood the meaning of love and devotion
You never failed me
You're buried in me
I wish I had the time to say goodbye
You had the spotlight in you
You never failed me

You're a symbol, a brother, my friend
Bonded together in this life and the next
Your vision, your light will remain in me
True friends don't come and go

You and me against the world
We're bound for glory
We are the one who fall but we get back up
We are the one who fight and we'll never lose hope
We rise, we fall
We're bound for glory
We are the one who fall but we get back up
We are the ones who fight and we'll never lose hope

Is this the price to pay?
Fear the violence in my heart
Always and forever follow the siren that leads me home
I wonder is this all we get for all this life time?
You've always understood the meaning of love and devotion
You never failed me

You're a symbol, a brother, my friend
Bonded together in this life and the next
Your vision, your light will remain in me
True friends don't come and go

You and me against the world
We're bound for glory
We are the one who fall but we get back up
We are the one who fight and we'll never lose hope
We rise, we fall
We're bound for glory
We are the one who fall but we get back up
We are the ones who fight and we'll never lose hope

All these moments will last forever
Now you know, now you know
You're everything that I stand for

(We are the one who fall but we get back up
We are the one who fight and we'll never lose hope)

You and me against the world
We're bound for glory
We are the one who fall but we get back up
We are the one who fight and we'll never lose hope
We rise, we fall
We're bound for glory
We are the one who fall but we get back up
We are the ones who fight and we'll never lose hope
