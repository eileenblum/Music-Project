I'll slit the throat of every rose
I won't live this life on my fucking knees
Call me Devil and no longer lover
Evil stitched to evil stitched
Where is the fucking trust?
You left me with nothing
Is this the taste of love?
I fucking call this hate

Obey
I let myself open to you
And this is all I get
Save your pity for the dead
I stay true to myself
Proud like a lion
I wear the crown

[Chorus:]
I'm floating in the dead man's sea
I've been hiding from something I never did
I forgot who I used to be
I want to sleep this life away

Back stabbing bitch
You will die by your hands
I'll see you in Hell
Your demons await
Taste my revenge
Oh

You're in the dead zone
Your time has come
You're in the dead zone

Obey
I let myself open to you
And this is all I get
Save your pity for the dead
I stay true to myself
Proud like a lion
I wear the crown

This is where you lose your ground
Bounce
This is where you lose your ground
(Ground, ground)
Bounce
This is where you lose your ground

[Chorus:]
I'm floating in the dead man's sea
I've been hiding from something I never did
I forgot who I used to be
I want to sleep this life away

Hate fast, love slow
Where did you go?
(Where did you go?)
This place that I hate
Made me lose my faith

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

I let myself open to you

[Chorus:]
I'm floating in the dead man's sea
I've been hiding from something I never did
I forgot who I used to be
I want to sleep this life
Sleep this life away
