I can't fall asleep
My life is upside down
Every day is exactly the same
Everyone tells me I've got nothing to give

Well, fuck that!

I'm giving everything I've got
I'm everything I always wanted to be
And I know this is what you wanted
So fuck you
You can't take this from me
You can't take this away from me

I wanna know why is everyone against me
I wanna know what has happened to my friends
Why do I feel like the world is against me?
Am I really on my own?

Have I been waiting for something that will never come?
Will never come

I know I could be dead by the end of the day
And I know this is what you wanted
But I'm not sinking down
Fear is just a lie that kills me inside

Let's fucking go

I'm giving everything I got
Give it up
Give it up
Let's go
Fuck you
I'm giving everything I've got
Until you lose

Won't let you sink me down

I wanna know why is everyone against me
I wanna know what has happened to my friends
Why do I feel like the world is against me?
Am I really on my own?

Have I been waiting for something that will never come?

I can't fall asleep
My life is upside down
Every day is exactly the same
Everyone tells me I've got nothing to give

Well, fuck that!

I'm giving everything I've got
I'm giving everything I've got
Fuck you
You can't take this from me
I'm not sinking down
