Laying on the floor and my eyes are
bleeding. Beaten up and torn by these
demons that won't let me see you face
but if you still hate me know that
everything that i do is for you.

Distant and reserved and i'm barely
breathing, struggling to recall your image
and voice in this time and place, but if
you still hate me know that everything
that i do is for you.

Reach for the off switch,
this is taking too long.
Reach for the off switch,
come and take me back home.

Laying on the floor and my eyes are
bleeding. Beaten up and torn by these
demons that won't let me see your face
and if you still hate me know that
everything that i do is for you.

Reach for the off switch, come and take
me back. Reach for the off switch, come
and take me back, back home.
