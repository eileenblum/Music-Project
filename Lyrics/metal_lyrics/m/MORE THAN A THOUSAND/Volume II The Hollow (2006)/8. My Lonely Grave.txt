I close my eyes and think life is great
and the world is safe,
I think I've got all the answers
but I'm out there lost and gone, lost and gone...
with a life that gives me the creeps.

I don't know who I am anymore...

I've been seeling my sins to each one of
them, I've been selling myself
then hide back in my shell,
but I'm out there lost and gone, lost and gone...
with a life that gives me the creeps

I don't know who I am anymore.
I can see my lonely grave on the floor.

My eyeball staring wide open,
even with my eyelids shut.

I don't know who I am anymore.
I can see my lonely grave on the floor.
