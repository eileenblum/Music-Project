I'm a virus,
A burning ache...
I am the fire
That crawls underneath your skin.
I can make you fall asleep,
I cannot let you sleep
I control the emption on the
Earth.

No needles nor drugs will take me away
I cannot let you go.
No needles nor drugs will take me away
I cannot let you go.

I am the empty that you always feel.

No needles nor drugs will take me away
I cannot let you go.
No needles nor drugs will take me away
I cannot let you go.
