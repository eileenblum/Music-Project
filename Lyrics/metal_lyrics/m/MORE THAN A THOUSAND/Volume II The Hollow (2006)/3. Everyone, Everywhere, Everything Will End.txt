As I promised you
One by one
Living or dead
I'll lead them to you

How could they have been
outside all this time
And no one ever noticed?
I'll bring you back, bring you back
I will follow you 'till the end

This is the end of everything
This was the first time that we've
Ever felt, ever felt
Don't be so scared of dying

As I promised you
One by one
Living or dead
I'll lead them to you

This is the end of everything
This was the first time that we've
Ever felt, ever felt
Don't be so scared of dying

I promised you
I'll bring you back
And I will follow you 'till the end
I promised you
I'll bring you back
I'll bring you back

This is the end of every-thing
This was the first time that we've
Ever felt, ever felt
Don't be so scared of dying
This is the end of everything
This was the first time that we've
Ever felt, ever felt
Don't be so scared of dying
