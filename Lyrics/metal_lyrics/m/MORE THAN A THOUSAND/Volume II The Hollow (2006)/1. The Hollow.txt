Who brought us here? How can we go so
far? Why do we always want more?
While wasting time angry, feeling guilty
and not knowing why... her little creature
called heart was losing its beat, is it really
this deadly? I allowed my creature to
crawl out of me while I was walking
through the hospital corridors.

Your creature is losing it's beat,
it's far more than real you've been my
hero but sometimes even heroes reach
and fall...

It doesn't matter if I'm ready or not... it
will aways be too soon... groans and
exhales... the human in me says "you'll be
gone to a place where nothing can harm you".

Your creature is losing it's beat,
it's far more than real you've been my
hero but sometimes even heroes reach
and fall...

My throat has now shrunk to the point
where I can no longer speak.
