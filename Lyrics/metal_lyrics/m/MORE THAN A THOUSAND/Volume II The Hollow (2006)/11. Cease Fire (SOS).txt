Cease fire
please take me out of here
Cease fire
I never asked for this
Please god take me home...
...now safe at home...
But i still remember
how the earth was
Bleeding and the white flashing lights
over and over...
awake to their sound, awake to their sound
couldn't fall asleep...

Stupid war i won't fall for you
Anymore... god save our souls in here

And every single second we lived more
All the stupid hope that we held
Everything started to fade away
Everyone said "this is hell"
you're the
Wave that swallows men and their
Dreams, you're the biggest of all when it
Comes to "kill"
and only the dead knows
Who you really are
but all of the dead are
Now gone far,
the earth was bleeding...

Stupid war i won't fall for you
Anymore... god save our souls in here
Stupid war i won't fall for you
Anymore... god save our souls in here

But nothing was left to save
nothing was left to say
when we were dragged
Through the mud,
nothing was left to
Save nothing was left to say
after dagging our souls through hell...
