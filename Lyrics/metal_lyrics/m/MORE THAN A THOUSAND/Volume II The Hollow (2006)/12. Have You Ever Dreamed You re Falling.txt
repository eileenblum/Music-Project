Up in the night we set our wings to fly, far from here. Please come back to me, I won't sting you anymore.

Dead in dreams, broken wings
I guess I'm falling again.

You can call me a cold machine, you can say between love and hate. We fall apart, in life and death we say goodbye.

Dead in dreams, broken wings
I guess I'm falling again
This nightmare means we'll die like this
I guess I'm falling again
I guess I'm falling again

Dead in dream, dead in dreams, I guess I'm falling again, I guess I'm falling...
We'll die like this

Dead in dreams, broken wings
I guess I'm falling again
This nightmare means we'll die like this.
I guess I'm falling again,

I don't believe what I've just seen
(falling again)
I don't believe this movie scene
(falling again)
