From hell you've come back
Back into your shell
Follow blood and secrets you will never tell
A pool of fire
Burning down,
Burning down across you cannot bear.

The reason I'm alone is the reason why I'm dying, I'm dying.

And I know you crave this
Like needles in your arms
Slowly getting inside of you
Spit my poison
Being pumping to your heart
It's taking over, it's taking over.

The reason I'm alone is the reason why
I'm dying, I'm dying, I'm dying.

Shadows on the sidewalk, hit me one last time
As the haze starts to lift, envy comes and burns right out of you.

I know you crave this
I know you crave
I know you want this
I know you.

Time come and take me to the past
Where I still breathe, where I still be.
[2x]
