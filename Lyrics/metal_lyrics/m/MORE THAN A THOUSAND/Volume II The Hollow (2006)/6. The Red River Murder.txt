At dawn's first light I saw your silhouette
Walking through my door you passed as if to say
"How could I die right now?"
"How could I die right now?"

Now I'm burning in red
Just like you said
I won't make a sound
Just let me fall

Later on that day when you emerged from the river
Wrapped my arms around you, oh no...
Why did you die right now?
How could I die right now?

Now I'm burning in red
Just like you said
I won't make a sound
Just let me fall to the ground

Now I'm burning in red
Just like you said
I won't make a sound
Just let me fall

Fade out the light
I'm lying at the bottom now
These vines like arms they pull me down
The siren sings and pulls me down

Now I'm burning in red
Just like you said
I won't make a sound
Just let me fall to the ground

Now I'm burning in red
Just like you said
I won't make a sound
Just let me fall

Moving in circles around and around
Into the deep where you will be found

Around and around...
