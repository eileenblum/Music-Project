Please wake me up someone wake me up
I got a notion in my mind saying I should
be fine but all my memories are fading
away my dreams are gone.
On the day I was born to live that's when
I started to die

I've been trying to open my eyes, but
now this voice in my head says I should
be dead.

The world is turning and I'm still the
same, someone wake me up, please wake
me up.

All my memories are fading away my
dreams are gone

The world is turning and I'm still the
same, someone wake me up, please wake
me up.

My memories are fading away please
wake me up, my dreams are gone now.
