Lately, I can hardly sleep.
Days are getting longer and colder.
It's raining and there's no one
in the street.
Two more weeks it's over,
but I still sing the same song...
but I still sing the same song.

[Chorus:]
Time take me away
'cause I can't fight anymore.
Time take me away
'cause I can barely hold on.

I look outside the window,
but it all looks the same.
I know we will be heading home soon,
but I still sing the same song...
but I still sing the same song.

[Chorus:]
Time take me away
'cause I can't fight anymore.
Time take me away
'cause I can barely hold on.

And after all these miles
I'm getting closer to you
and after all these time
I'm getting closer to you.
We're in this together,
we see our city lights burn and
now I know I'm getting closer to you.
We're in this together,
we're in this forever.

When your life goes wrong you got
to be strong, just hold on, hold on.
When life is not easy, you got to hold on,
just hold on, hold on.

[Chorus:]
Time take me away
'cause I can't fight anymore.
Time take me away
'cause I can barely hold on.
