We only stop at the morning light
We only stop when it all feels right
The fat lady is not singing tonight
Like stubborn motherfuckers we all die

One, two, one, two men in (Yeah!)
One, two just one man out (Oh!)
Round one boys and girls
You better get ready to party

If you're not feeling the rhythm you're not ready to die
Fill your lungs with air and make sure you're alive
If you're not feeling the rhythm you're not ready to die
If you're not getting the rhyme you're not ready to die

One, two, one, two men in (Yeah!)
One, two just one man out (Oh!)
Round one boys and girls
You better get ready to party

Clear the fight scene and get the fuck out

Who's gonna win this fight?
Who's gonna win this fight?

To all motherfuckers in the house get your hands in the air
This ain't a goddamn funeral
To all motherfuckers in the house get your hands in the air
This ain't a goddamn funeral

The fat lady won't be singing tonight
We only stop at the morning light when it all feels right
The fat lady is not singing tonight
Like stubborn motherfuckers we all die

One, two, one, two men in (Yeah!)
One, two just one man out (Oh!)
Round one boys and girls
You better get ready to party

Clear the fight scene and get the fuck out

(If you can't beat us)
If you can't beat us, join us
(If you can't beat us)
If you can't beat us, join us

To all motherfuckers in the house get your hands in the air
This ain't a goddamn funeral
To all motherfuckers in the house get your hands in the air
This ain't a goddamn funeral
