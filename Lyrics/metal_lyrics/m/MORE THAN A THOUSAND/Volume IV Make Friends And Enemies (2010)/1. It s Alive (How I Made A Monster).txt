Six to midnight it's cold and ready
Five to midnight just keep it steady
Four to midnight and you know it's ready

3, 2, 1, it's alive it's alive it's alive
3, 2, 1, it's alive

I'm made of body parts from murders and liars
I've got six pieces of heart and the eyes of the dead
Screws coming out from each side of my neck
Holding a mind of a troubled man

Someone please just put me to sleep
'Cause everyone keeps running away from me
Someone please just put me to sleep
Nothing lasts forever

I am not afraid
I am not afraid with you by my side
I am not afraid
I am not afraid with you by my side
You won't drive a stake through my heart
You won't drive a stake through my heart
You won't drive a stake through my heart
You won't drive a stake through my heart

I'm made of body parts from murders and liars
I've got six pieces of heart and the eyes of the dead
I could have a hundred faces, I could have a million names
Some were lovers, some were haters, I do not know their names

Someone please just put me to sleep
'Cause everyone keeps running away from me
Someone please just put me to sleep
Nothing lasts forever

3, 2, 1, it's alive it's alive it's alive
3, 2, 1, it's alive
A million stitches sewed together
All the body parts you stolen
You brought me to life, but I'll bring death to you.
