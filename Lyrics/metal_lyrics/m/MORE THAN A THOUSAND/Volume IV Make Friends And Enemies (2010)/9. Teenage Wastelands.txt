I lay awake at night in a bed of thorns I can't close my eyes
I'm fading into the dark as the light burns out from my only star
My blood runs cold in this ghost town covered by these black clouds
Where no one knows where I am
Where you can't hear me scream

Try to find a way as I lay awake
In this place with no doors
Try to find a way as I lay awake
I'm screaming your name

Come and get me out I'm crawling without you
Come and take me away
Hiding in the dark I'm so lost without you
Come and take me

I talk but no one listens, I just keep talking to myself
I've been screaming your name but still I live to fight another day
I believe the light is coming to this hole that I call home
I gave you my heart a thousand times but now it's just my fist covered in blood

Try to find a way as I lay awake
In this place with no doors
Try to find a way as I lay awake
I'm screaming your name

Come and get me out I'm crawling without you
Come and take me away
Hiding in the dark I'm so lost without you
Come and take me

And after all these years everything seems out of reach
It's boiling in my blood, It's running through my veins
My eyes are turning red from all those words you said
I'm breathless of waiting

Come and get me out I'm crawling without you
Come and take me away
Hiding in the dark I'm so lost without you
Come and take me
