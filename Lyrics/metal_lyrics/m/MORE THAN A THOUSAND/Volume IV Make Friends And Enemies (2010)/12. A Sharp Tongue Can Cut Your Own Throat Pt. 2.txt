[Hidden Track]None of your words makes any sense
The blood rots in your veins and I breathe it's scent
Your world's under a spell and you're not doing so well
I'll be here next to you through the fires in the sky
Down this long, heavy road
I'll be here next to you, I won't let you go down
Down this long and heavy road
I remember you were always there for me
If now you can't see through, I'll carry you
If it's now you need me most, I'll carry you
And I'll be next to you, through the fires in the sky
Down this long heavy road
I'll be next to you through the fires in the sky
Down this long heavy road
(you don't have to fight alone)
(you don't have to fight alone)
(you don't have to fight alone)
(you don't have to fight alone)
(you don't have to fight alone)
And I'll be next to you through the fires in the sky
Down this long, heavy road
I'll be next to you, I won't let you go down
Down this long and heavy road.
