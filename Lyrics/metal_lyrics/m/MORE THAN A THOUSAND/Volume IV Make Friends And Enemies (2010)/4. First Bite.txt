The world of the the dead
Sings at your door
That's why you can't sleep at night
You've haunting this city for too long
Hiding underneath the london fog

You were bitten first on the darkest of nights.
Now you'll be living this life forever
And no one is ready for this, and no one is ready for this,
But I'm not afraid to die

[Refrain:]

It's in your eyes, under your skin
and I don't understand
up in the sky, on the blackest night
come down and take my hand.

Every minute you live someone dies
I swear that I have tried
Only to find that I am lost again

Another night,
The streets are filled whit filth and shit
They smell like blood and cheap wine
You live in the depths of forever but I will find you
You live in the depths of forever but I will hunt you down

You were bitten first on the darkest of nights.
Now you'll be living this life forever
And no one is ready for this, and no one is ready for this,
But I'm not afraid to die

It's in your eyes, under your skin
and I don't understand
up in the sky, on the blackest night
come down and take my hand.

Every minute you live someone dies
I swear that I have tried
Only to find that I am lost again

Like an anchor,
All I do is drag you down with me [x2]

DRAG YOU DOWN WITH ME!

It's in your eyes, under your skin
and I don't understand
up in the sky, on the blackest night
come down and take my hand.

Every minute you live someone dies
I swear that I have tried
Only to find that I am lost again
