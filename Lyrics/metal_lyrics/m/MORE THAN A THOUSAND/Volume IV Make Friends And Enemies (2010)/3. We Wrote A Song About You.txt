Yeah it's true
It's another love song
But this one goes out to my friends
To the ones that I trust with my life
I would trust my heart in their hands
All these words
All these songs written with care and devotion
They remind me of what we've been through
Of your friendship and protection
But these words won't mean a thing

You know how it is
People got us all wrong
We're not in this game for the fame
And we've seen you taking shots for us
We've heard you standing up for our name
But these words won't mean a thing

Tell me this won't change
These promises we made will stop me from falling

Let's share this moment
This song goes out to you here tonight
Let's share this moment
We'll set this stage on fire

I'm telling the truth
This feeling is real
I'll wear my heart on my sleeve
This is our life
We'll stand up tall
We'll pick you up every time you fall
Sing with us one more time
These words about good times and friends
To the ones that I trust with my life
I would trust my heart in their hands
But these words won't mean a thing

Tell me this won't change
These promises we made will stop me from falling

Let's share this moment
This song goes out to you here tonight
Let's share this moment
We'll set this stage on fire
We'll set this stage on fire

'Cause the biggest fire in the world
Couldn't burn our bridges
Wake up wake up, we're coming home
We wrote this song about you
'Cause the biggest fire in the world
Couldn't burn our bridges
Wake up wake up, we're coming home

Let's share this moment
This song goes out to you here tonight
Tell me this won't change
These promises we made will stop me from falling

Yeah it's true
It's another love song
But this one goes out to my friends
To the ones that I trust with my life
I would trust my heart in their hands
Sing with us one more time
These words about good times and friends
To the ones that I trust with my life
I would trust my heart in their hands
