Our love must die tonight
'Cuz I can't take it anymore.
Should I just lay down dead on the floor?

Our love must die,
By the end of the night.
Our love must die,
I'll bury it deep with all your lies.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
But there's no other way to drop the bomb.
Oh baby, I'm sorry,
I know you never cared for right and wrong.
Our love must die tonight,
'Cuz I know I'm still alive. [2x]

You have my heart in a box,
Where it was cold and dark,
And I'm dying searching for the light. [2x]

Our love must die tonight
'Cuz I know I'm still alive.
Our love must die tonight
Let me hear you scream.

You keep company with wolves,
that a betrayal.
You keep company with wolves,
I cannot save you.

You keep company with wolves,
what I betrayal.
You keep company with wolves,
I cannot save you. [3x]

You have my heart in a box,
Where it was cold and dark,
And I'm dying searching for the light.

I tried not to become someone like you,
And I'm dying searching for the light.

Light...

If you think that I should stay...
You better look back...
(look back, look back) [2x]

You have my heart in a box,
Where it was cold and dark,
And I'm dying searching for the light. [4x]

I tried not to become someone like you,
And I'm dying searching for the light.

My heart's not easy to read for someone like you,
And I'm dying searching for the light.

If you think that I should stay...
You better look back...
(look back, look back) [4x]
