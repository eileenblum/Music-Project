Let's go
I was once a part of that pack
And I've heard what they tell you
Believe in this my friend, I would get away if I were you
Talking shit behind your back
"You're not with us if you're dressing like that"
It's all about the way they look
Always judging covers, never reading the book

Music fades out
Lights go off now
We'll give you everything we got
This song goes out to you

We hold you deep inside our hearts
'Cause you're the reason why we're here
Words can't explain my thoughts of every moment we shared

You're taking the quiz "Am I a scene kid?"
You shouldn't even worry, I know we never did
Closed minds are a dangerous thing
How do you know what's best if you always go the same way?
Talking shit behind your back
"You're not with us if you're dressing like that"
It's all about the way they look
Always judging covers, never reading the book

Music fades out
Lights go off now
We'll give you everything we got
This song goes out to you

We hold you deep inside our hearts
'Cause you're the reason why we're here
And words can't explain my thoughts of every moment we shared
We hold you deep inside our hearts
'Cause you're the reason why we're here
And words can't explain my thoughts of every moment we shared

A sharp tongue can cut your own throat
A sharp tongue can cut your own throat
A sharp tongue can cut your own throat
A sharp tongue can cut your own throat

A sharp tongue can cut your own throat
The wrong friends one day will leave you alone
You're safe in here and you will always be home
We're not perfect, we're only flesh and bone

Music fades out
Lights go off now
We'll give you everything we got
This song goes out to you

We hold you deep inside our hearts
'Cause you're the reason why we're here
And words can't explain my thoughts of every moment we shared
We hold you deep inside our hearts
'Cause you're the reason why we're here
And words can't explain my thoughts of every moment we shared

And words can't explain my thoughts of every moment we shared
