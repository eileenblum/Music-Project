Do what you want
Throw me out
Just leave my bag at your door

As I loved, you've hated
There's nothing I can do to change it
Just leave my bag at your door

And I'm not running away
Please just give me a sign
Because this feels like I'm burning inside
And I'm not running away
Just give me a sign
This feels like I'm burning

Come on

I know sometimes it's hard to understand what I do
I got so much to lose, so much to lose
I'm not your inspiration
I know it's not easy to love someone like me
I never wanted to hurt you

But this is what I do
And it takes you to the edge, I know
But this is what I do
And this is how I feel

And I'm not running away
Please just give me a sign
Because this feels like I'm burning inside
And I'm not running away (Not running away)
Just give me a sign
This feels like I'm burning

You say I'll die alone, but I'll die doing what I love
You say I'll die alone, I give everything I got
You say I'm on my own
Then I will die alone

'Cause this is what I do
And it takes you to the edge, I know
'Cause this is what I do
And this is how I feel

And I'm not running away
Please just give me a sign
Because this feels like I'm burning inside
And I'm not running away
Just give me a sign
This feels like I'm burning

And I'm not running away
Please just give me a sign
Because this feels like I'm burning inside
And I'm not running away
Just give me a sign
This feels like I'm burning
