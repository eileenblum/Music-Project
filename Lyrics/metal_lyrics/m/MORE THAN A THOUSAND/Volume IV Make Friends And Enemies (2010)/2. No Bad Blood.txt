This is who we are
Tonight we'll stay together
This is who we are
How I'll remember you!

I still remember the good times
We thought we were friends
We were in this until the end
Did you think we would stop when you left?
Did you think we were dead?
You know us better than that!

Nothing breaks our hearts
Nothing breaks our hearts
You can't take this away from us!
We forgive! We forget!
Let's put the past behind
Let sing it like if it was the last time

This is who we are
Tonight we'll stay together
This is who we are
These words will last forever

I'll remember tonight until the day I die
I want to stay in this moment for the rest of my life
I'll remember tonight until the day I die
I want to stay in this moment for the rest of my life
Tonight we're lions! And we're not going down (haters!)
Tonight we're lions! And we're not going down (haters!)

This is who we are
Tonight we'll stay together
This is who we are
These words will last forever
Even when you're gone

Are you ready?
One, two, three go!

From those I trust the most comes the greatest threat
From those I trust the most comes the greatest regret
From those I trust the most comes the greatest threat
From those I trust the most comes the greatest regret

This is who we are
Tonight we'll stay together
This is who we are
These words will last forever
This is who we are
Tonight we'll stay together
This is who we are
These words will last forever

These words will last forever
Even when you're gone

Nothing breaks our hearts
Nothing breaks our hearts
I'll remember tonight until the day I die
This is who we are, and this is what we've got
Goodbye my dearest mother fucker
