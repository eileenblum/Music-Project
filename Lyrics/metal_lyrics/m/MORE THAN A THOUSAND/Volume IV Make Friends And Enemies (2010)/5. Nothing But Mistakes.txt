It seems like I've done everything wrong
It feels like I was nothing but mistakes
I thought I'd given up
But now I see the burning sun.
Will good come to an end?
Because I'm starting to feel alive.

No matter where I go
This haunts me more
All I need is you
You don't know what you got until is gone
My heart died with you
And it's getting hard to breathe
And all I need is you

There's too much noise from all these voices around
Sometimes it hurts to say "Am I a ghost to You?"
I guess I always knew
But I just couldn't see the truth
But in this darkest hour
I'm starting to feel alive.

No matter where I go
This haunts me more
All I need is you
Don't know what you got until is gone
My heart died with you
And it's getting hard to breathe
And all I need is you.

All your snakes around my neck
And I don't seem to care
With these snakes around my neck
I crawl into the dark

No matter where I go
This haunts me more
All I need is you
Don't know what you got until is gone
My heart died with you
And it's getting hard to breathe
And all I need is you.

No matter where I go
This haunts me more
All I need is you
Don't know what you got until is gone
My heart died with you
And it's getting hard to breathe
And all I need is you.
