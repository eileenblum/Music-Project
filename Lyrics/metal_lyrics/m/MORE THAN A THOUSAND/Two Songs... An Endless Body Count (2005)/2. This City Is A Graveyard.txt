Rib cage made of broken bones
Cuts and bruises, glass and stones
My jealousy on your passenger side
I hope it died, I wish you died too

I can't forget your scars
When when you crashed your car
At 100 miles an hour against that wall
You're the only one who
Makes me forget that I will die too

This city is a graveyard
I whisper dreams into the dead
But they don't see it
I see you shinning to me
Like a candle on the river
But I'm sure we will die too

Rib cage made of broken bones
Cuts and bruises, glass and stones
My jealousy on your passenger side
I hope it died, I wish you died too

I can't forget your scars
When when you crashed your car
At 100 miles an hour against that wall
You're the only one who
Makes me forget that I will die too

This city is a graveyard
I whisper dreams into the dead
But they don't see it
I see you shinning to me
Like a candle on the river
But I'm sure we will die too

Heaven clouds collide
Under our will
And I have to saw
Those corpses
To get you out of there

I can't forget your scars
When when you crashed your car
At 100 miles an hour against that wall
You're the only one who
Makes me forget that I will die too

This city is a graveyard
I whisper dreams into the dead
But they don't see it
I see you shinning to me
Like a candle on the river
But I'm sure we will die too

And I'm sure we will die too
