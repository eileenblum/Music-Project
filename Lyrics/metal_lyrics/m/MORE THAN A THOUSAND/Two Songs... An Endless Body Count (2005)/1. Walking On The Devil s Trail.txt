You were walking on the devils' trail
And the end is extremely fucking near
I will look down
I will look down
I will look down to your corpse and smile

I'm running out of bullets
I'm running out of bullets
I'm running out of bullets

In every corner and every alley,
Another place to hide
You're running through the city
And I can smell your hair

I followed you into your house,
I put a gun straight in your mouth
And that was the end...
You begged me "Don't kill me"

You were walking on the devils' trail
And the end is extremely fucking near
I will look down
I will look down
I will look down to your corpse and smile

I'm running out of bullets [3x]

In every corner and every alley,
Another place to hide
You're running through the city
And I can smell your hair

I followed you into your house,
I put a gun straight in your mouth
And that was the end...
You begged me "Don't kill me"
Begged me "Don't kill me"

By the time the lights were turned on
A thousand bullets are in your heart
It's not enough, it was not enough...

I'm choosing a weapon to kill you [5x]

In every corner and every alley,
Another place to hide
You're running through the city
And I can smell your hair

I followed you into your house,
I put a gun straight in your mouth
And that was the end...
You begged me "Don't kill me"

I followed you into your house,
I put a gun straight in your mouth
And that was the end...
You begged me "Don't kill me"
