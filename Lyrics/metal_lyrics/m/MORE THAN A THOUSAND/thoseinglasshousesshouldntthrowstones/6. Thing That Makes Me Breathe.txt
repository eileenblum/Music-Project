What can I do to impress you?
Since you got it all in your hands
And I'll go without it
Someday I'll make it
I'm looking for attention from someone who gets it

I'm coming after it, after all it's all I want to do
And I'll bear it all for the thing that makes me breathe

Under stage and lights or down to none
I guess life shouldn't be ordinary
And I'll go without it
Someday I'll make it
I'm looking for attention from someone who gets it

I'm coming after it, after all it's all I want to do
And I'll bear it all for the thing that makes me breathe

Without it
I'm nothing
The thing that makes me breathe
I know I'll make it
