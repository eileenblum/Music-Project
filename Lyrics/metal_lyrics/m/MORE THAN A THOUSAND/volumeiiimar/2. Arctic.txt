I felt my voice broken
Looking for a sound for every word
By searching for a touch from the soul.
I've lost my place,
I carry the burden.
The voice inside knows no love anymore.
Leave me out this time my friend I've grown to hate.

Time out.
I'm out.
Shut up.
I'm out.

You fix it if it's broken,
You heal it if it's sick.
Some days never end,
Some days are never born.

Should I surrender?
Should I travel to your side?
You're the coldest December,
But I'm your coldest night.
(Yeah)
Shut up
Time out
I'm out

I never glow,
You never listen.
And I just can't pretend.

Why don't you burn me alive?
You get what you want.
You want what you get.
Is that the best you can do?
You can take all with you.

Should I surrender?
Should I travel to your side?
You're the coldest December,
But I'm your coldest night.

How can you not see?
We are the same!
