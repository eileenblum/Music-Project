The waves will come. And weâll float to its sound.

The waves will come. The waves will come and everybody floats to its sound.
The waves will come.
Is that what you want? Is that what you want?
The entire me turns into reflections of you.

We all got one (yeah!)
But youâve got none (yeah!)
Itâs better to run
Itâs better to hide
Everybody better get out of here.

Can you feel it?
Can you hear it scream?
Can you hear it?
I canât hear you!

The waves will come and weâll floatâ¦
We lit this fire. We let it burn.
Weâll turn to ashes. The sea will come.
Is that what you want? Is that what you want?
The entire me turns into reflections of you.

We all got one (yeah!)
But youâve got none (yeah!)
Itâs better to run.
Itâs better to hide.
Everybody better get out of here.

Can you feel it?
Can you hear it scream?
Iâm what matters here. Not you!

When our time is done.
Certain as the grave.
You can see it comeâ¦ (Your wave...)
And everybody floats to its sound
Everybody floats to its sound
Everybody here floats to itsâ¦soundâ¦.
