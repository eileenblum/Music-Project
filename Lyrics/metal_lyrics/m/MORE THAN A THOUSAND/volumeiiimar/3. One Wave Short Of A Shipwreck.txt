ITâS TOO LATE TO STOP
PUT YOUR ARMS AROUND ME
NEED YOUR ARMS AROUND ME
I FALL FOR YOUR LINES
OH, IT STINGS, IT STINGS, IT STINGSâ¦ And you knowâ¦

Hold the needle right
My heaven can wait
It burns all night
While I dream awake

Like fire every moment is floating
Itâs over flowing and Iâm sinkingâ¦ DOWN!
Like the earth is crashing down on me
CAN YOU HEAR ME SCREAM!?

BESIDE HER MY WORLD IS GETTING BLANK
SHEâS A LIARâ¦ Sheâs a liarâ¦
AND SUDDENLY ALL MY FRIENDS DISAPPEAR
SHEâS A LIARâ¦ SHEâS A LIAR!

How far can you get?
I'm now aware
Hear the soundâ¦ The soundâ¦

Take cover, itâs coming over
Itâs too late to stop

ITâS TOO LATE TO STOP
PUT YOUR ARMS AROUND ME
NEED YOUR ARMS AROUND ME
I FALL FOR YOUR LINES
OH, IT STINGS, IT STINGS, IT STINGSâ¦ And you knowâ¦

HOLD THE NEEDLE RIGHT
My heaven can wait
IT BURNS ALL NIGHT
While I dream awake

BESIDE HER MY WORLD IS GETTING BLANK
SHEâS A LIARâ¦ Sheâs a liarâ¦
And suddenly all my friends DISAPPEAR
SHEâS A LIARâ¦ SHEâS A LIAR!

How far can you get?
Iâm now aware
Hear the soundâ¦ The soundâ¦

Take cover, itâs coming over
Itâs too late to stop this now
Take cover, itâs coming over
Itâs too late to stop this now
Stop this nowâ¦ ( Take coverâ¦ Take coverâ¦ )
Stop thisâ¦ NOW! ( Take coverâ¦ Take coverâ¦ )

Beside her my world is getting blank
Sheâs a liarâ¦ SHEâS A LIAR!

( Hear the soundâ¦ )
( Iâm leavingâ¦ Tonightâ¦ )

This is the moment that I leave you in here ( Hear the soundâ¦ )
This is the moment that I leave you in here
This is the moment that I leave you inâ¦ ( Iâm leavingâ¦ Tonightâ¦ )
Hear the sound, hear the sound, hear the sound
This is the moment that I leave youâ¦ GOODBYE!
