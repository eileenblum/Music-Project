all day i thought
this moment of happiness
longing to see you
cut you
and breath you in

i thought i wouldn't miss a thing
and all that i wanted was to cut your face in two
do you believe me?
do you believe these dreams i tell you?
don't be afraid of
these twisted thought i share with you

in every word i said
in every cross i beared for you
i've seen it
in every sting i took for you
in everything we left undone
i've seen it (in every cross i've beared for you)

i thought i wouldn't miss a thing
and all that i wanted
was to cut your face in two
do you believe me?
do you believe these dreams i tell you?
don't be afraid of
these twisted thought i share with you
i share with you
i share with you...

and i will not scream without you
and i will not run without you
and i will not scream without you
and i will not run without you
and i will not scream without you
and i will not run without you
and i will not scream without you
and
i will not run without you

do you believe me?
do you believe these dreams i tell you?
don't be afraid of
these twisted thoughts i share with you
i share with you
i share with you
i share with you...
