It's the blood, there is something in the bloodâ¨
i'm not mad, i just feel like killing you...
â¨i've been trying to tell you how i felt so wonderful
â¨i've been trying to tell you i'm not what you used to knowâ¨
butâ¨
know this until the day our hearts are taken and ourâ¨
souls are replaced with ghosts and demons, hollow.
â¨this is a beautiful ending let's drown in our own bloodâ¨
i'm not mad, i just feel like killing you...
â¨i've been trying to tell you how i felt so wonderfulâ¨
i'm not the one you used to know...â¨
when hell is full the dead will start walking down the streets
â¨you don't know what i have seen, you don't know where i have beenâ¨
when hell is full the dead will start walking down the streetsâ¨
i've been trying to tell you how i felt so wonderful
â¨i've been trying to tell i'm not what you used to knowâ¨
but
â¨know this until the day our hearts are taken and our
â¨souls are replaced with ghosts and demons, hollow.
â¨this is a beautiful ending let's drown in our own bloodâ¨
you don't know where i have been, you don't know
