Nobody panic here!..
I've seen their footsteps at my door.
Show me evidence, show me what you b'lieve.

I've never been so close t'the edge without looking down.
I've got a fire b'neath my skin. Let my mind expire.
I've got a plan where nobody needs you.
I'll leave your body on a trail so no one knows..
How t'find you..

They got a way t'hold my feet down!
They want t'follow in my broken footsteps.
They've come to break my stride and vision.
They got a clever way t'chain me t'the ground!

They always get too close,
they come along and ruin everything.
Digging deeper into my skin. Let my mind expire.
I'll build a fire and put it b'neath you.
I'll take a picture and I'll remind everyone..
Where t'find you..

They want t'watch me feel my heart stop beating.
Dear intruders, come find me at that line,
This has to end t'day!
Dear intruders start running for cover quick.
This has to end today.
Just send them all away.
Send them my way..time keeps moving.
They don't deserve t'live, theres no time for those distractions.
Time is running off, I'm getting ready t'fight them off.
I'll stand my ground, they always get too close and ruin everything.
Surrounding me. Dear intruders don't ever cross that line.
Without looking for a fight.
Dear intruders start running for cover quick!
This has to end t'day.
They always get too close, they come along and ruin everything.
Digging deeper into my skin.
Let my mind expire.
I'll build a fire and put it b'neath you.
I'll take a picture and remind everyone where t'find you.
