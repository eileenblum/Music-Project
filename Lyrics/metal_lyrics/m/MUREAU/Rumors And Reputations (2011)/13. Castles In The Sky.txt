If i could run!
Somewhere off in the darkness, I'd be fine.
Crawl to safety,
Take away the good things i have left.
From a distant life, everything changed in an instant.
I've known my mind t'play some tricks, what happened?

This world walks, I've seen it breathing in and out!
I love all the pulse that beats my heart.
Here in my coma,
I get to choose whats real and whats fake.

I can't accept this..
Here in my coma,
I get to choose whats real and whats fake.
They left without me, they're gone too soon.
A part of me can never feel safety..
If this is real!
I'll wear the date across my chest.
Why is it me!..
that has t'bury his best friend..and continue.

Somebody chose me,
Let it out, let it all come t'me.

Leave everybody with no sense of time
Suffocating like I've never been breathing.
Why is it me?..
who gets to live while they get death..
Enjoy your castles in..
THE SKY!

If this is real,
I'll wear the date across my chest.
Why is it me?
(Why is it me!)
who gets to live with so much death.
