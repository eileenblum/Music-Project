Last night i woke up from this dream.
I lay dissapointed,
Nothing can compare t'what I've seen.
There is another place for me.
I've got another world behind my eyes I wish that you could see.

There's no point in waking up from a good dream.
Somebody save me.
There's never enough here for me,
I'm going back t'sleep.
Nobody wake me.

Reality is such a nightmare!
I'm gonna close my eyes,
Live here inside this dream.
I've always been a dreamer.
I do it for myself.

I've been to paradise and back.
I've seen so many fucking colors.
God Damn!
That place was beautiful!
I'm looking straight in from the world.

There's no point in waking up from a good dream.
There's never enough here for me,
I'm going back t'sleep.
I'm going back t'sleep.
From the moment that i wake up, I'll be thinking.
There's nothing i can't do while I'm dreaming.
. .
DON'T!!
. .
Don't take it all so seriously,
You can make your own fate if you just believe in me.
This life is too short t'get caught up in things that keep you down.
I'm going back t'sleep..

Never wake me up!
I'm always dreaming..
NEVER WAKE ME UP!
