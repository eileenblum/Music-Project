I've got a problem.
The sidewalks are splattered with your brains and more.
I've gotta get some,
The real world is gone,
I've gotta keep sane!

Did you call just to lie while your leaving?
I'm the reason you die, I'm with you.

You made such a big mistake!
Your covered with them lies that you told.
I've gotta keep moving, I hate what you did.
I can't kill the past!

On the blackest of nights,
while your bleeding.
I'm the reason you die, I'm with you.

Just tell me something,
I don't know our ending.
You live your life by the book.
You went and planned out the garden of secret.
You think your so fucking clever.

Did you call just to lie about leaving?
I'm the reason you die, I'm with you.
