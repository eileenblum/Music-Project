Everybody's moving!
In double time in the same direction!
Is anybody listeniiiing!
To the cries of the fallen?
One foot in front of the last one,
Our only choice is to pray and hold on.
I see the pain in their eyes,
it's starting to make my stomach turn.
I hope we live through tonight,
The fear and the filth go hand in hand.
We found ourselves in hell,
No time for sleep, no time for sleep the fighting consumes us.
I'm not afraid t'die here, these bullets tear at my flesh,
they'll never take my mind.
This is a promise i made to myself.
Another day in the wastelands,
The darkest hour is upon us, time is standing still.

I'm staring at the stars.
The only way of pretending it's a dream.
I'll keep my weapon near me,
Just in case the enemy is..
looking for some trouble.

They aim and fire upon us,
they're never going to surrender.
We're gonna push them one by one,
here they come by the thousands.
Hold your fire, wait till' they're close,
Take aim, shoot until they all lay lifeless!
The only good ones are dead ones!
Give them just what they came for,
Lay their bodies to waste!

I see the pain in their eyes, it's starting to make my stomach turn
I hope we live through tonight,
The fear and the filth go hand in hand.
. .
Don't.. leave me wasted!
I've got so much to tell when i come back home.
I took a chance to be abnormal.
This is a promise i made to myself.
We are the only survivors,
We made a family of strangers,
Time is standing still.
