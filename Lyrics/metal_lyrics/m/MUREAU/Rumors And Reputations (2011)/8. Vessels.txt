SIT DOWN!!
Never sit when you can STAND UP!
GET DOWN!!
Never crawl when you can LAY DOWN!

Never stay awake,
When you can sleep it off.
There's always a next time,
Grab the moment before..it's gone for good!

You can't have it all..
If you don't go take it.
Someone else is..
Trying to steal it from you!

Times up!
None of your stories make you famous.
Show me!
Give everything you have,
Prove t'me your going to claim it.
(you can't shake hands with a closed fist..)
OH!
. .
Never stay awake..
When you can sleep it off.
There's always a next time,
Grab the moment before it's gone for good.

Sit down!
Never sit when you can STAND UP!
Get down!
Never crawl when you can..
STAND ON YOUR OWN TWO FEET!
Show me!
None of your stories make you famous.
Get down!
Give everything you have..
Stand on your own two feet.
