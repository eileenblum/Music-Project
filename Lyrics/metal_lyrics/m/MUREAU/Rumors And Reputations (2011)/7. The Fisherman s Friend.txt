Suddenly it's perfect, the music plays a striking harmony.
We are a sound of melody combined.
Living in this moment,
A wall of sound made from different voices,
we know the words we sing so softly.
When i call for safety, I'll keep this near me.
And when i feel like everything i live for has given up,
I'll keep waiting.
Well remind them what we live for.
No one can take this away from me.
We will always have what we're proud of.
No one can take this.
