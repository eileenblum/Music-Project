I'm going back to sleep.
This world behind my eyes is what i seek.
Please stay away from me.
Leave all my troubles behind in the real world.
I'm gaining nothing from this hurting.
Don't cry when you find me rested.
I'll be lost in a dream where its painless.
I'll help you fight for your life while you got one.
Keep my memory among the good ones.
Don't cry when you find me rested..
