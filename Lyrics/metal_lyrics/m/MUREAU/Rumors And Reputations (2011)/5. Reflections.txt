We walk these roads, a mile at a time.
We took it apart but got there fine,
They're lying t'me when I'm behind the wheel..

They take my arms and drag me through the mud..
so polluted, Wastelands remind me of what I've got t'do
The power to create, The power to destroy
Time was non-existant
The distance between us grows so thin

Running in circles we drew ourselves,
Pick your battles before you go to war.
We constructed these monuments from stone.

Before I go, let me remind you i was here!
I helped you create life, I filled your lungs with air.
I helped you poor the water into the seven seas
You helped me plant the trees,
We taught ourselves t'breathe!

Where did you go? Creators of the skies.
We waited so long to call this home..
I'm dying to leave..
This world was all we knew.
They take my arms and drag me through the mud..
so polluted..
Wastelands remind me of what I've got t'do.

Before it's gone, let me remind you why i came!
You left us all alone,
You've got yourself to blame.
I helped you poor the water into the seven seas.
You left us all alone,
You've got yourself to blame.
