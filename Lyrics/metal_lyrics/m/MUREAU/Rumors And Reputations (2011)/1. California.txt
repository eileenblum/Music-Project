Spare me! All the details!
You must have me confused?..
Drop this one..like a bombshell.

DON'T FORGET!!
All your friends back home!
We adore you, 
you put this in the wrong hands.

Please come home. 
What made you run?..
You put this distance between us both.
Who made you think.. 
That these miles will bring you home!

[Chorus:]
"Grab my hand and come with me across the state lines."
"I'll be your peace when you need distraction."

When the distance! Starts grabing hold of you!
I'll take this in my own hand, 
Grab your shit!!
Lets get you back to your real home for good.
I hate this distance between us.
What made you leave in the first place?..
Lend me your ears!

[Chorus:]
"I can't wait t'get you back to California.
Live inside that dream where..you never left town."
"Grab my hand and come with me across the state lines."
"I'll be your peace when you need distraction."

This is the way t'say I LOVE YOU BOTH!
PLEASE! come back home.
They'll never love you like i do.
Friends are the family, you choose yourself!

[Chorus:]
"I can't wait t'get you back to California,
Live inside that dream where..you never left town."
"Grab my hand and come with me across the state lines."
"I'll be your peace when you need distraction."
