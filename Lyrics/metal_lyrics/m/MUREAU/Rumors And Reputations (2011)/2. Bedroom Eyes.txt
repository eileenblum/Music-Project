[feat. Brendan Foley from Betrayal]THAT GIRL!!
I hear her voice from across the room!
I see her body up close!
Her sweat feels just like venom.
I hope your boyfriend will never know!

All things I wanna do to her.
I trace the curves of her body..
With my fingertips!

We'll spend our lives in the bedroom!
Were gonna lock all the doors.
She is the ghost of my hallways!
My fingers tracing her movements.

[Brendan:]
We slept!!
In the same tiny bed!
I covered all her corners.
With my hands..
I love to feel her on my skin!

I love her sweat on my body!
I am a secret she wants to keep!
Folded in laundry,
Tucked in the sheets.

I love her body in my control.
I love to feel her on my skin.
She is my favorite Friday night!
Shes got more curves than a canyon road!

She calls!!
When she wants something evil.
Im glad to give her just what she needs!
Take her straight to the bedroom floor..
She stares at me with those bedroom eyes.
BEDROOM EYES!
..
BEDROOM EYES!

We'll spend our lives in the bedroom.
Were gonna lock all the doors.
She is the ghost of my hallways!
My fingers tracing her movements.
