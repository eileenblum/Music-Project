Rumors! and Reputations!
Get the most of your time!
I love to hear these words.
I'm waiting for the echo.
My favorite timeless sound.
Stories told are nothing like the truth.
I love t'see your face staring back at me t'see me smile.
Another perfect day, one I'll remember for some time.
I will look forward to you following me to the blackest holes.

Too many keys, Too many doors.
I'm getting tired.. of all these rumors and reputations.
Take me away from all of this bullshit.
I love t'hear your words.
When you seek your apologies,
I'm waiting for the echo!
My favorite timeless sound.
Stories told are nothing like the truth.
I love your face staring back at me t'see me smile.
Another perfect day, one I will remember for some time.
I will look forward to you following me to the blackest holes.

Too many keys, Too many doors.
I'm getting off the bullshit!
Too many keys! I'm getting off the bullshit.
Too many keys, too many doors.
Too many keys! too many doors!
I'm getting off the bullshit.
Too many keys!.. too many doors!

Waiting for the echo.
My favorite timeless sound.
Stories told are nothing like the truth.
I love t'see your face staring back at me t'see me smile.
Too many keys, too many doors.
Too many keys!..too many doors.
