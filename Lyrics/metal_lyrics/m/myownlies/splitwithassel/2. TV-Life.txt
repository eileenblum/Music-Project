turn on the TV.
stare into the void be dumb and believe.
pray to the hi-tech-god.
watch all that crap pay to be shaped
consume what they show and turn off your mind
this is your life do you like it?
this is your life dump and blinded.
stare! pray! distorted reality.
one half of the truth
dogmatisation to create a content fool.
