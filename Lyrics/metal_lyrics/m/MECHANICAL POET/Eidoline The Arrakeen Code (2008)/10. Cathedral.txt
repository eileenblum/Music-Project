I used to be so tough.. From times to times. I used to be so rough.. .To many people. I tried to live in just as angels do for sure. Without spite and blame. But I am just a man.

I've built inside my heart a cathedral. It's made of happiness and grief.

I yearn to be like Sun that gives its shine to everyone. I'm used to smile at every face and not to wait an answer.

All doings have their reasons. 

All chances have their bounds. Be careful with your inner flame or it will burn you down.

I've built inside my heart a cathedral. It's made of happiness and grief. I've built inside my heart a cathedral. Its made of trust and disbelief.

I used to be reserved...It was my way to win. I used to be concerned about every single thing. I wanted to be loved like all my heroes. I tried to find the bliss... But I have found the peace.
