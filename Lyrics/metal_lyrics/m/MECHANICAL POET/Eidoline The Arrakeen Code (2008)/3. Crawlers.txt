I see the land in wounds. And many painful scars.

I hear the scream of engines spreading to the stars.

I find the trace of hungry maggots. Prophets of new breed.

No peace of mind in wild eyes. Just empty holes to feed.

Crawl down and take it all. Then let me see you dying. You're suffocating in your greed.

Crawl down and take it all. Then let
me see you dying. I like to smile as you bleed.

I watch the crawling bugs in avid search of fare.

I smell the sense of madness streaming through the air.

A wild fight. A bloody war. A downfall of a cruel system rotten to the core.

From dark of night till light of dawn. Somebody eats someone.
