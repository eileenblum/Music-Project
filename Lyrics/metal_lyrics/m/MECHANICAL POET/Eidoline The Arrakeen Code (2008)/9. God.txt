When you break the rules and go against the tide...

When you face the nature blind of your pride...

You don't have a chance...

When a hurricane meets you on its way...

When you cross the line and run away...

You don't have a chance...

God...If you are not the god.

God... If you are not the...

When your ego makes you forget your place...

When you think that power is in your hands...

When you're not the god...

When you summon monsters you cannot tame...

When you put your hand in the wild flame...

Fear...

Crossing the path of the giants.
