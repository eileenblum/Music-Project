How many days have passed since
That crazy summer day
I havenât seen your face so farâ¦
Whatâs up with you today?
It seems like everything is wrong
I cannot sleep at night
And all I have is justâ¦ that void inside

Somebody help me to change what Iâve done
I feel that time is against me
I have no time
Give a chance to explain it to everyone
I know that time is against me
I have no time

From early morning till late night
My company is me
I hate this place and even more
I hate myself for being here
If only I could say a word
But you donât give a try
You didnât come, you didnât callâ¦
And no one tells me whyâ¦

Somebody help me to change what Iâve done
I feel that time is against me
I have no time
Give a chance to explain it to everyone
I know that time is against me
I have no time

Somebody help me to change what Iâve done
I feel that time is against me
I have no time
Give a chance to explain it to everyone
I know that time is against me
I have no time

Somebody help me to change what Iâve done
I feel that time is against me
I have no time
Give a chance to explain it to everyone
I know that time is against me
I have no time

Somebody help me to change what Iâve done
I feel that time is against me
I have no time
Give a chance to explain it to everyone
I know that time is against me
I have no time
