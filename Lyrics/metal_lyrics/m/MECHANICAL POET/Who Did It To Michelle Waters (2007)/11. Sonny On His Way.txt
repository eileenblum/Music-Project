The countryside was left behind, some towers showed up
The sleepy station heaved in sight, my train came to a stop
I take my bag and coat, I know itâs cold but Iâm so happy to be here
I hit the dusty ground and look around, the dirty cityâs roaring near

Letâs make some noise
Iâll do my best in stirring up this hornetsâ nest
Itâs time to go ahead and make a breakaway
Letâs make it clear
You may protest against an uninvited guest
But no one cares of what you say
Itâs Sonny on his way

The lines of shining streets, the crowds of running folks
Wherever you may be youâll hear a never-ending drone
The pulse ?? urban beats, stone walls and giant blocks
A place where you will never be alone
I watch out carefully, itâs not what I used to see
The stone jungle full of threat
My goal is somewhere near, I go without a fear
I got a plan inside my head

Letâs make some noise
Iâll do my best in stirring up this hornetsâ nest
Itâs time to go ahead and make a breakaway
Letâs make it clear
You may protest against an uninvited guest
But no one cares of what you say
Itâs Sonny on his way

The countryside is far away, the towers rise a field
The sleepy station lies behind, new world is revealed
I hold my bag and coat, I know itâs cold but Iâm so happy to be here
I walk the dusty ground and look around, the cityâs roaring near

Letâs make some noise
Iâll do my best in stirring up this hornetsâ nest
Itâs time to go ahead and make a breakaway
Letâs make it clear
You may protest against an uninvited guest
But no one cares of what you say
Itâs Sonny on his way
