This sunny morning looks so nice
And all is so refreshing
She hears the ticking of her clock
No sign of past depression
But yet she feels itâs not some stupid dream at all

And Snow White awakes
And Snow White awakes
Your soul is full of light
Youâve found the heart you miss
And Snow White awakes
And Snow White awakes
The sleeping belle revived
Because of true loveâs kiss

But not a day beforeâ¦when all was painted in black
She cried by nights and felt so weary
And everything around seemed to be evil and unkind
Her tired eyes were blind and blearing
Itâs odd to see the smile now in a looking glass

And Snow White awakes
And Snow White awakes
Your soul is full of light
Youâve found the heart you miss
And Snow White awakes
And Snow White awakes
The sleeping belle revived
Because of true loveâs kiss

This sunny morning looks so nice
And all is so amusing
You see the things you never knew
This world is so confusingâ¦
It fells like you become a freaky child again

And Snow White awakes
And Snow White awakes
Your soul is full of light
Youâve found the heart you miss
And Snow White awakes
And Snow White awakes
The sleeping belle revived
Because of true loveâs kiss
