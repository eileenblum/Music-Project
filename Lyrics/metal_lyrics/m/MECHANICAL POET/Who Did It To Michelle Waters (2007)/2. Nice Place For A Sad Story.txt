A naughty boy, a pretty girl
The coolest lad and prom night queen
A sleepy town, a country school
The cruelest place youâve ever seen
The signs of bars and traffic lights
So where you think could all this happen?

Right!
Just look outside
Ainât it the same street spreading far and wide?
Just step outside
And see this story with your own eyes

A cell, a flower store
A field of gravesâ¦ thatâs something weird
It may be strange, it may be odd
Sometimes itâs hard to hold your tears
Itâs not a tale with elves and knights
You almost know where it could happen

Right!
Just look outside
Ainât it the same street spreading far and wide?
Just step outside
And see this story with your own eyes

âMore spite and love, less joy and laugh,
This time itâs all a real life
Frustrated plight, a suicideâ¦
No chance to wait for a happy endingâ

Right!
Just look outside
Ainât it the same street spreading far and wide?
Just step outside
And see this story with your own eyes

Right!
Just look outside
Ainât it the same street spreading far and wide?
Just step outside
And see this story with your own eyes
