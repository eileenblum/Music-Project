A youthful fellow humbly came into a flower store
A present for a pretty girl is what he's looking for
He knows that she is wild about handsome yellow blooms
How many roses in the room... That's good one, he presumes

A yellow rose for Michelle
A rose for Michelle
We disagreed but now it has no sense
A yellow rose for Michelle
A rose for Michelle
I know Iâm wrong but give me one last chance
I'll never fail...

An undertaker's car has stopped beside a flower store
A bunch of roses for a girl that died the night before
Her crying parents said that she adored some yellow plants
There is a lot of stuff like that... Let's buy it all at once!

A yellow rose for Michelle
A rose for Michelle
We disagreed but now it has no sense
A yellow rose for Michelle
A rose for Michelle
I know Iâm wrong but give me one last chance
I'll never fail...

A yellow rose for Michelle
A rose for Michelle
We disagreed but now it has no sense
A yellow rose for Michelle
A rose for Michelle
I know Iâm wrong but give me one last chance

A yellow rose for Michelle
A rose for Michelle
We disagreed but now it has no sense
A yellow rose for Michelle
A rose for Michelle
I know Iâm wrong but give me one last chance
I'll never fail...
I'll never fail...
I'll never fail...
I'll never fail!
