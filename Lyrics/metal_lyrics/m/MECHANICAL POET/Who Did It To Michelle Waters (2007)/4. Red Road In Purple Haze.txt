This pair is fascinating
Theyâre looking really cool
So nobby, so enchanting
Theyâre best students in the school

They want to be the therapists
They always get an âAâ
The leaders of the rating lists
The heroes of Prom Day

Watch your back
Watch your way
You canât always be the best
Watch your back
Watch your way
There will be a day youâll fail the test

Six hundred five horsepower
Red label turned the head
One hundred miles an hour
All traffic lights are red

Carry, carry, carry, carry, carry on
âChill out, Chelle, thereâs nothing wrongâ¦â
Stand on the gas, donât let it go
ââ¦Oh, NO!â

Watch your back
Watch your way
You canât always be the best
Watch your back
Watch your way
There will be a day youâll fail the test

Watch your back
Watch your way
You canât always be the best
Watch your back
Watch your way
There will be a day youâll fail the test

Come on, come on, come on!
Carry on!
