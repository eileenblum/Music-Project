A youthful fellow humbly came into a flower store
A present for a pretty girl is what he's looking for
He knows that she is wild about handsome yellow blooms
How many roses in the room... "That's good one", he presumes

A YELLOW ROSE FOR MICHELLE
A ROSE FOR MICHELLE
WE DISAGREED BUT NOW IT HAS NO SENSE
A YELLOW ROSE FOR MICHELLE
A ROSE FOR MICHELLE
I KNOW I'M WRONG BUT GIVE ME ONE LAST CHANCE
I'LL NEVER FAIL...

An undertaker's car has stopped beside a flower store
A bunch of roses for a girl that died the night before
Her crying parents said that she adored some yellow plants
There is a lot of stuff like that... "Let's buy it all at once!"
