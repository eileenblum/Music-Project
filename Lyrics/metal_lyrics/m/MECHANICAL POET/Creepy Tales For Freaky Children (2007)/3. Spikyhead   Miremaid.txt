The rain is falling on and on
Seems like the town sleeps
A lone girl with mossy locks
Is walking down the streets

She has no friends -
They hate her hair and labrets in her lip
She's used to be an outcast
And doesn't need their fellowship
But suddenly she caught his look
So close and so deep...

SPIKYHEAD AND MIREMAID
WILD AND INSANE
ONE BAD NIGHT AN UGLY PRINCE
MET HIS LOVELY LADY IN THE RAIN

A black tattoo along the neck
The hair is colored red
A lot of piercing on his face
Brought him the name of "Spikyhead"

A quaint guy, a dusky soul
He's always glum and mute
He smokes two packs of Kents a day
And seems too sick and brute
But suddenly he caught her look
So close and so cute...
