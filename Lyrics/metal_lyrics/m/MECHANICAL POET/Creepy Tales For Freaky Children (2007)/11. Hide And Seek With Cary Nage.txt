A muted filthy snigger
A creak of closet door
Poor Willy shrinks away
He's frightened to the core

Bad smell suffused the room
When Cary came in sight
There's no remorse in silky voice:
"We're gonna play tonight..."

YOU HAVE TO MIND THE RULES
YOU'LL LIKE THIS GAME
THE HIDE AND SEEK WITH CARY NAGE
A MINUTE FOR A RUN
A LOT OF PLACE TO HIDE
THE WHOLE HOUSE IS THE STAGE
WILLY HIDES AND CARY SEEKS
ALL IS FAIR, NO DIRTY TRICKS!
WILLY WINS AND STOPS TO SHAKE
BUT IF YOU LOSE... YOU'D BETTER AWAKE

The game begins when Cary counts
And Willy leans against the wall
A creepy gnash of iron teeth
It's Cary prowling in the hall

Time is crawling, time is creeping
Lazy points are moving slow
Musty smell is getting near
"Willy, are you here?"

"Let's play hide and seek, my sweet
You're a hider, I am it
When I get to 5 o'clock
You should be as quiet as log
One o'clock - the door unlocked
Two and three - don't stay by me
Five o'clock - I'm lying rogue
So here I come to bite!!!"
