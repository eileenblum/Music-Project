I've never been this room before
I don't like this place at all
Some ugly shadows creeping...
On the wall of empty hall

I cannot make a move
I cannot even scream!
How does it happen to me now?
It cannot be! It's all...

...A DREAM
I CAN'T HELP TO BELIEVE
THE DREAM I FEAR TO STAY IN AND THE ONE I FEAR TO LEAVE
IT'S ALL A DREAM
TO SEE THE OWN TALE
I FEAR TO COME AND FEAR TO FAIL

The tide so free and proud
Soft watercolor clouds
I wanna take a breath and scream my heart out!
The noble coasts rise
Embracing wild streams
Eternal forest lies behind
It's fabulous! It's all...
