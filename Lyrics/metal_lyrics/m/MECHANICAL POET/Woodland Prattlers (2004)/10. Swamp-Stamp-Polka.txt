Damn me!
Real coin of sterling silver I found!
Nip me!
It was merely lying there on the ground!

Felt boots with a coat I'm going to buy
Furry mittens, a suit and a tie
Sackful of grits and a bottle of wine
Lots of things will be mine!

[Chorus:]
Get the hell out of me!
Hang you and let me be!
Give me this shiner back!
Or i will break your neck!

Bad egg!
Good-for-nothing! A stupid thundering ass!
Blackleg!
Bloody murder is now coming to pass!

Don't frighten me fellow! I'm sated enough
With your terrible nonsense and stuff!
I've found it first and this coin is mine
I won't muck in with swine

[Chorus]
