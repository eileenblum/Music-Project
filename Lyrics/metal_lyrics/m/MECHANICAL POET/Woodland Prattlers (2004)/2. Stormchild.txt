Lightnings!
The flaring claws
Tight strings
Of typhoon's bows

Whiz, rave, howl
The insatiable storm!
Shrill, laugh, growl
Like demoniac swarm!

A tower steeple
Vibrates in the rain
Some dancing people
Reflect in a pane

The wine drips
In highwaymen's lair
The chief keeps
The birth of his heir

[Chorus:]
Stormchild!
The daughter of thunder and hail
Entwined
Her crying with laughter of gale
Come to us and fly!
Break the glass and try!

Squall of a tearing gush
Winds in a violent rush
A moment of hush...
BOOM!!!
Ha-ha, what a deafening crash!

Bluster and fright
Tumble and bite
Piercing the shower
The bolt set a tower
Alight!

The sign of doom
(Acclaims her)
The deadly gloom
(Awaits her)

The brat of reckless man
Has answered mother's croon
New leader of the clan
Appears before the moon

[Chorus]
