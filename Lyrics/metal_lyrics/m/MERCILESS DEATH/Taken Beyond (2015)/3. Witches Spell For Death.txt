The eve, of the Devilâs witch spell-cast forth
Your incubus infinite nightmare, from which 
She canât awake if only her lord could save, 
For the nuns sake die! Demonic force destroys
Your tortured soul intense death! Feel the 
Minds reality losing all control an inquisition, 
Power bestowed keys to the ritual, now a 
Sacrificed owed the Lordâs holiest, shall be the
Beasts feast screaming in the blackness of the 
Night slowly falling further from the holy
Light witches spell, into the realm, she will fall
Where the tortured bodies adorn the sinful
Walls witches spell for death!
