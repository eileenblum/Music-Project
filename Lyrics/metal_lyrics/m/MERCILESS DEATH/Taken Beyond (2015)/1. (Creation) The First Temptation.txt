Writhing in the garden, in sin and lust
Waiting for humanity, their God they
Trust forbidden by command, of a 
Holy power damnation of the land, at
The unholy hour falling from the
Grace of God into a darkened hell
Where temptation is the pleasure of 
The flesh the place where evil dwells
Satanâs way, was not the way, Gods way,
was the only way! His desire of 
Arrogance, and of one way to exist
Burn forever or to be on his list
Come rot in the flames with me there
Is no escape when your eyes 
Cannot see!
