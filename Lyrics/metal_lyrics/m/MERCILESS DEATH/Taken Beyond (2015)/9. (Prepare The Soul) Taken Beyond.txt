The great tempter, our lord, and your 
Deceiver he will torture you, Son of God
The seer his unimaginable power will
Possess your soul as the demons scream, 
You lose control takenâ¦ beyondâ¦
Darkest form of evil from past the
Furthest gate dawn of existence, your 
Destiny lies beyond its fate grasping his
Power, and understanding your mistake
Faith in the lord God, is a foolish choice 
To make!
