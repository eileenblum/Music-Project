Claims of great salvation lived in lives
Of sin youâre the false of your religion
Your soul will rot in Hell I have no God
You should live like me my mortal blood
paid in flesh my soul shall be set free
Christians of Gomorrah indulge in sin 
And lust godly claims from mortals your
Immortality and not of your own misery 
But the sins that you have made have 
Already laid your grave false
Repentance of your soul you will rot in 
Sinful death thereâs nothing you can 
Pray that will stop the path you lay!
