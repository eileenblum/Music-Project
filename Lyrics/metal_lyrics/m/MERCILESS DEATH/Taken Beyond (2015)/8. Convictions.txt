A fanatical deceptive reality this life is truly
Killing me far- beyond the greatest perceptions
Lie my own worst fears and dreams beyond a 
Reality most cannot see
Is where my true destiny writhes in agony
Fear of their holy majesty false human life of
Fantasy their only true reason, for belief in a 
Christ, is a rotting pit they fear the complete
Betrayal of an older soul has affected all time
For me one fateful day yet to exist, I may take
All life from thee
I fucking swear it!
These are my convictionsâ¦
