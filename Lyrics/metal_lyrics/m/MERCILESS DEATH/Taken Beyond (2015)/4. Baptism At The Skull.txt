Rotting flesh falls from the cross
Blasphemy by the evil priest sinners take
Communion at the altar of death upon the
Holy Lord they now feast with each piece of
Flesh they further desecration Christ is
Falling to hell the lords that haunt the
Gates of damnation take him to where they 
Dwell baptism at the skull come and join the 
Sinnersâ¦ in hell bathing in his blood, his
Disciples watch in fear the crucifixion ends
In sin the existence of their Lord is now
Ruled by Hell they feel Christâs death within!
