Screaming out for mercy
The blade in hand is raised
The savage beast is called
Victim submits to his ways

Funeral for the stolen souls
Demons rip and tear the flesh
In the coffin terror awaits
He overlooks the dead

Savage killer no remorse
Slaughtered rotting corpse
No escape from the grave
Where the dead are no longer that way
Phantasm

Beware the evil in the night
The horrors of hell arrive
Demonic force of evil hell
Tortured souls are kept alive

Trapped in the coffin
Trying to escape
He'll soon be free
You'll suffer his fate

Savage killer no remorse
Slaughtered rotting corpse
No escape from the grave
Where the dead are no longer that way
Phantasm
