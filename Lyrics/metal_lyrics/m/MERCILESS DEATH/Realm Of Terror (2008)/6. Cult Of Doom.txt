Warriors of pain, messengers of doom
An army armored in steel
His vision set on butchering the clan
No time or chance to escape
Without mercy regret or remorse
The order is given to kill

Power of pain
The piercing of flesh
Limbs severed by hatred
Ferocious beasts released for the game
Awaiting the jaws of death

Emotions forgotten, his soul ignored
He commands the troops at hand
His journey to wander
Destroying the land
The quest for the riddle of steel

Power, force, tyrant, venom master
Monarch, evil, demon, serpent king

The means to focus, eclipse your mind
To bind your own will
The pleasure of pain and ritual of sacrifice
Strengthens his hold on man
Reality is false, the  power of god
The ability to morph at command
Tyrant of evil released from hell
To conquer the power of steel

Moans of death cries for mercy
Weapons bathed in blood
Villagers slaughtered, homes destroyed
Torched and burned to ash
Scouts retrieve remaining survivors
The children to be enslaved

Mother and son flee for their lives
The smell of death in the air
Cornered and scared, blade in hand
The unmasking of Thulsa Doom

Glaring eyes, the face of treachery
Inflicting the final blow
Beheading a woman, alone at last
Behold the power of Satan

Power, force, tyrant, venom master
Monarch, evil, demon, serpent king

The means to focus, eclipse your mind
To bind your own will
The pleasure of pain and ritual of sacrifice
Strengthens his hold on man
