Eternal unending
Dying in evil lust
Suffer into your existence

The holy cross must fall
Before the power is lost for resistance
A given, a standard
Set by decree
To smash the holy cross

Congregation of the blackest hell
A place where the trinity is no loss

Proclamation of a desecration
The chapel is crushed with sin
The power of his unholy force
Haunts the helpless souls within
His legions they outnumber the holy
The mark of hell on their soul
The flames that burn into their minds
Are now eternal with the seventh seal

His is the place called hell
None will escape

Morbid and sinful
Souls of hell
Your evil master awaits
His presence is felt by the timely death
Of the lords saints who died at the gates
Their blood now runs free
To drink from the chalice
And seal your tormented fate

Unholy suffering, now and eternal
Their lord's salvation was too late

Fall into hell, grasp your insanity
The demon bell will chime
Vengeance of evil cast out on the holy
Recognize his number as nine
Practitioners of the faith will suffer in hell

For words they do recall
Left with the fear of knowing
That the end was not Satan's fall

His is the place called hell
None will escape

Morbid and sinful
Souls of hell
Your evil master awaits
His presence is felt by the timely death
Of the lords saints who died at the gates
Their blood now runs free
To drink from the chalice
And seal your tormented fate

Unholy suffering, now and eternal
Their lord's salvation was too late
