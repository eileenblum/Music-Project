Evil darkness takes a hold of your body
Feel the tongues taste your breasts
Offered up by the conjuror for sodomy

Legs spread apart as they slip in
Chains around your neck break skin
Wrists held down as they dominate
Sons of Belial don't hesitate

Raped and tortured
In the pentagram
By the beast with
The head of a ram

Screaming in pain before the northern gates
Desecration and defilement
Of your mind and soul
Belial now beckons you to heed his call
As he takes a daughter of Christ below

Raped and tortured
In the pentagram
By the beast with
The head of a ram
