Incantations have been spoken
As the sermon for the dead
Bestow on them a sacrifice
And await our lord's arrival

The earth shall be darkened
By the force of Satan's might
Rotting hands tear the flesh
Extract your very soul

Screams of those being tortured
Will echo through the night
Demons from the pits of hell
Display no signs of mercy
Upon the world they consume
Mutilation they decree
Their progression cannot be halted
There is no hope in closing
The gate

Calling the evil, demons of sin
Our master sits and waits
Corpses that rise
Slaughter the living
Deprive you of your life
From the ground his castle rises
Pandemonium is here

It's here to stay
