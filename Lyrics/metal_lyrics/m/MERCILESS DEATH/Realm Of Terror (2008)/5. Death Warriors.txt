Time has come
Legions are marching forth
Hear them sound the battle cry
Chaos everywhere

Blood will spill
From all those who oppose
Infernal war rages on
You can't escape this hell

Endless pain
Fists are held up high
Leather warriors
Claim another victim in the pit

The distant thunder
You're thrown into the circle
Rage and violence take control
You can't escape this fire

Death
Death warriors
Death
Death warriors

Time has come
