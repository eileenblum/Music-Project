Pounding from the woods
The evil that draws ever closer
Chanting which is heard
From the tongue of the devil's messenger
Every night they sit and dance
Around the devil's flame
Welcoming the insane shouts
And the children's screams

In the city of Rheley
Dreaded Chthulu lays dreaming
Awaiting the alignment of the stars
That are ever gleaming
His minions anticipate
The dawning of his arrival
Bringing with him a new age
Of sin and their survival

Summoning the evil
Summoning of the ancient ones
Summoning the evil
Summoning of the ancient ones

Book of the dead
States the rituals to enslave men's souls
Powers of the mad Arab
Derive from the netherworlds
Chanting the passages
To cast forth the evil spell
Demons from another realm
Is what the legends tell
Yog-tothoth
Both the silver key and the gate
His knowledge will consume
Your mind and seal your fate

Summoning the evil
Summoning of the ancient ones
Summoning the evil
Summoning of the ancient ones
