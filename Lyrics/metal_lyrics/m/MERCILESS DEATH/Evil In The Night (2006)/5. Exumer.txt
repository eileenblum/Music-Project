Murderer, torturer
Call him what they will
Exumer will return again
To make another kill

Tortured corpses left
In a watery grave
Never to rise from the sea
Merciless killings and raping and pain
Torturing them 'till their final plea

Once they die for the last time
Their lives will be taken away
They will not remain the next day

[Chorus:]
Crush kill destroy
He'll smash and thrash the dead
Attitude of aggression
A violent slice to the neck
Crush kill destroy
He'll smash and thrash the dead
Attitude of aggression
Blood runs from your head

The hour of the dead is upon us
As their screams echo from the crypt
His menacing eyes causes fear in their face
They will die in this slaughter

Tortured skull, dying skull
They all suffer tonight
Left bloody and dying
On an altar of sacrifice

Evil in the night
Victims try to fight
Theres nowhere to run
Killing all 'til he's done

[Chorus]
