Hot air tears your skin to shreds
Hell on earth has arrived
The scrolls of time foretold this tragedy
Man made weapons seal our fate
Cannibalistic deeds of the dead
Driven by the need for human flesh
Nuclear terror, genocide, warfare
Spread across the planet

Annihilate... the population
Desecrate... god's creation
Rid the world... of disease
Go to hell... Satan awaits
