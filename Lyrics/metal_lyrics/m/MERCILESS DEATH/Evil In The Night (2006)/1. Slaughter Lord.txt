Devils servant under necromancers spell
Kill the victim before the chime of the bell
Venom-like steel, soon to slice flesh
The blade of death and destruction

Beheaded bodies lie in the path
Spelling misfortune from an unfinished task
A haunting from the deepest unknown
Life's last rights killed in cold moonlight

Under... the executioner's command

Severing the head from the spine
Maggots will feast on the corpse in time
Evil priests condemn the soul
Life in hell, into the fiery hole

Masses chant an evil spell
Raising souls from which they fell
Sadistic force of unholy rule
More souls into deadly hell

Under... the executioners command
