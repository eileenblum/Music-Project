Crucified upon the cross
Your sins condemn your soul
To them it's a brutal loss
As Lucifer takes control

You'll burn in hell for eternity
Your soul-trapped in obscurity
Evil grips on your hand
As your ashes fall on scorched land

Burn in hell

[Chorus:]
See the horrors of our hell
As it traps you in its spell
You win not survive
Evil possesses your mind
As you burn upon the cross
To hell you're no fucking loss

Witness painstaking misery
Another life expendable
Demons rape the whore that burnt
Satan laughs and takes another turn

Torture, rape, and misery
This is all your eyes can see
Death will never truly end
Pain is your only friend

Burn

[Chorus]

Dismemberment
All around
Your skull cracks
Gut wrenching sound
Peering into your soul
Satan laughs- takes control
You vomit in disgust
Watch the souls turn to dust

As your body starts to die
The pain will subside
Satan will desecrate your soul
Bound up to the abyss you'll go

Crucified upon the cross
Your sins condemn your soul
To them it's a brutal loss
As Lucifer takes control

Burn in hell

[Chorus]
