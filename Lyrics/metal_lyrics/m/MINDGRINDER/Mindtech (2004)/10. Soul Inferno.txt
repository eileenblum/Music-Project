I shepherd the hordes of evil
I, I am the blackening sky

As the light, turns to darkness
You know, you're about to die!

I shepherd the hordes of evil
I, I am the blackening sky

As the light, turns to darkness
You know, you're about to die!

I see your soul in a blaze of flames
A blaze of infernal flames
From the burning depths of hell!

I shepherd the hordes of evil
I feed my hate

Can you feel the heat now
As I open the gate
Hear the screaming souls
It's your destiny!

I see your soul in a blaze of flames
A blaze of infernal flames
From the burning depths of hell!

Burn forever, infernal soul!
Burn forever, soul inferno!
