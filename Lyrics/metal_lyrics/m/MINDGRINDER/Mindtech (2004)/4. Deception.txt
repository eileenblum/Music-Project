Deception of body and mind
Sacrifice!
Insignificant to the result

Deception
Let this be your aftermath
Let this be my will
The story has been told
The story will be still

You were cracked open
By my will or not!
Yet victimized you were not

Hear me now, obey!

No reason for you to complain
Over this
After all you did quite well?!

Deception
Let this be your aftermath
Let this be my will
The story has been told
The story will be still

This is the final touchdown
You may believe it or not
This is my will; forced to fulfill
