I can see the fear in your eyes
I can see the insecurity in your actions
I can see the lie in your ways
Nature will do it's harvesting soon

Retribution, coming from inside you
There is nothing there to stop it now!
No way out; you're doomed to realize the
Price to pay for insufficiency!

You can feel the lie in your spine
You can feel what you've left behind
You can feel your own deception
Natures call upon thy flesh!

Retribution, coming from inside you
There is nothing there to stop it now!
No way out; you're doomed to realize the
Price to pay for insufficiency!
For insufficiency!

Repulsive evolution = Heavy retribution
Repulsive evolution = Heavy retribution

We have denied our true existence
We have denied our true being
We have denied our true will
Nature shall take its toll soon

Retribution, coming from inside you
There is nothing there to stop it now!
No way out; you're doomed to realize the
Price to pay for insufficiency!
For insufficiency!

False expectations, left with total betrayal
Lost the nonexistent, your mind is torn apart
What is reality, who will embrace your words
Total denial, anger sets its roots

Start the fire, burn the infected flesh
Cross the borders, crush the memories of pain
Carve the new way, kill the mind in vain
Cynical decay, gather the mind to power

To power

Self destruction!
For regeneration
Self destruction!
For a new way

Deny your self your pain, seek the final chapter
Drown your feelings to live, deny yourself your pain!

Terminate the lies in your mind
Bring forth your angers wrath
Kill your inner self, build your own world once again
Mute your cry for justice, plant the seeds of anger
Self destruction for a prospering future
