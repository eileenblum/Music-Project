How easy they get to prey
How easy they get away
Their instincts tell them ok
They are beasts and will obey

Tragic their contributions
So sad the standards of their illusions
Tactic choice to avoid the blame
They do not even understand their shame

So you think you'll never answer for your actions
Then tell me what makes you so special!

You are just another failure on this Earth
You bring us all down and you make our existence
An error
An error
An error!
