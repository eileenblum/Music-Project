United we stand
No way to break this alliance
Their divination crushed
Justifying our ways
Violating laws divine
Left out of their utopia
Then again do we care?

Surviving gadzooks!

This is their visions fuckin' funeral
We are now in control!
This is the beginning of our reign
We see them fall as we stand strong
Our will will become
Their moment of truth!

Standing there above us facing their fate
Nothing can stop it now!
We were right all along you know
A funeral of divinity

Goddamn damnation; total devastation
Sickening an vicious to the bone
Your fierce creation; fuckin' revelation
Withering away you are alone!!

Surviving gadzooks!

In their self righteous minds
We have suffered contempt!
Their sickening ways have been their defense
In this moment of truth they are to realize
This is not humanity's fall
Only the fall of contempt!

Goddamn damnation; total devastation
Sickening an vicious to the bone
Your fierce creation; fuckin' revelation
Withering away you are alone!!
