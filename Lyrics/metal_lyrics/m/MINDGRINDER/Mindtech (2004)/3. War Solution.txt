Blood; shed my blood and tears, now raise my
Heart from the soil
For I've seen the last disobedience, to enter the
Face of the earth
Set me on fire and your own skin shall fry
To obtain discipline all betrayers must die

Action!
I will use the necessary force, willing to go down
I will be dead when my hammer hit the ground

Souls; everywhere I saw those cheating transparent souls
Willing to sacrifice nothing, carving their fate in the stone

Action!
I will use the necessary force, willing to go down
I will be dead when my hammer hit the ground

I saw cocoons crack wide open and some were filled with fire!
Most were empty, fuckin' polluters!
I feel my disgust arise

Disgust arise

Poisoned by forgiveness they were
Begging for what they called strength
To commit the same crime again and again

Commit the same crime again!
