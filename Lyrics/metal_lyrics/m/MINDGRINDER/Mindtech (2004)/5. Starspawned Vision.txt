The night came soon
And then my ruin
Wraiths sought my occult spirit
To unseal and further tell
Of the mystery inside
The dawn came never, yet still my death

For wraiths caught my spirit
Concealed and hidden well
By the misery in me

Under spectral skies I walk
A purple beyond purple
The star-spawned vision fade
Four gates to one
Marble echoes shatter the still
What appears on the throne?
The emptiness bleeds my soul
A vortex in my veins
I ebb and flow, and then I drown

The night came soon
And then my ruin
Wraiths sought my occult spirit
To unseal and further tell
Of the mystery inside
The dawn came never, yet still my death

For wraiths caught my spirit
Concealed and hidden well
By the misery in me
