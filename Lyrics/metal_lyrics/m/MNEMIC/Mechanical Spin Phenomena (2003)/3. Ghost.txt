I made you and your hate to socialize in a matter that suits me fine.
So while I breathe in you punched my teeth in.
I tried to explain it but you just, you just don't see.

I, I see right through you.

So you do things, mainly bad things. Is it to satisfy your own neurotic needs.
I got this feeling I'm just dreaming but just make sure I'm awake when you punish me.

Come follow me to that place where we both see what happened to you. I need 
to see if it's all true. Confide in me.
I was blind but now...

I see right through all that you do, but though I see you I know you're not 
here with me and still I try to explain to you.
How your presence is affecting my state of mind.

[CHOR.]

Oh suck me in, inside myself
I want to, taste myself
It drags me down, your dismal past
And all you want, is to make that last

[CHOR.]

Don't want this, its true what they say
Ignorance is bliss, I'll find another way
In my mind, it's all good now
I don't do things, that's abnormal
They'll take me and put me away.
Listen to me when I tell you I'm not insane

I, I see right through you
