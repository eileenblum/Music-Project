Spiritual sickness spreads in me
Plan out the future until you know what there will be
Until you know what there will be

(When the dust)
When the dust settles
You've become free

The fire inside feels like it's about to burst
Everything seems to much, I don't feel at home
I feel so goddamn empty, everey day is eating a piece away
Until there is no more left of me

Until there is no more left of me
Elongated sporadic bursts
Until there is no more left of me
Leaving my body cold

Calculating a new apocalypse
Thread the result to create your world
No one hears the voice of sanity in this Maelstrom
(in this Maelstrom)

(When the dust)
When the dust settles
You've become free

My dreams are all what I will ever have
Plan out the future until you know what there will be
Until you know what there will be

(When the dust)
When the dust settles
You've become

(When the dust)
When the dust settles
You've become free

Free
