I drift and fall in space

I twist like a vermin in deformed shifters
Eyes turn to black
Fear is your god
I'm just a shadow lost in space
Oh. I'm fading in motion
Into the system
We are the sons of the system
We rise and fall
We'll make the corrupted bleed for our existence
Nothing to fear, only what you can hear

WE ARE THE SONS OF THE SYSTEM
WE RISE AND FALL

The wind of enslavement is blowing
The pulse of extinction arising
These are the sounds of sorrow
These are the cries of
The sons of tomorrow
Fear is god into the system
We are the sons of the system
We rise and fall
Will we rise
Will we fall
