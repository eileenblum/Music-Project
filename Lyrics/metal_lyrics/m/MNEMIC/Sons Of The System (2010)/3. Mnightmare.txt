Give it to me
Shout it to me
You just pathetic piece of truth
Will never be the same
Who will be the one to blame
Will I ever be the same
You will be the one to blame
You will be the one to blame
Through years of sorrow
The humans that we are
Are crawling down below
We are slaves to ourselves
Slaves to ourselves
Will we ever be the same
Will we ever be the same
We're sick
Sick of fighting everyday
Sick of lying everyday
Sick of all
Blinded by storms around you
You need an earthquake to wake up
Before the light is gone
Before the life is gone

Leave aside the colossal hypocrisy
The general hypocrisy
Rent yourself an opinion
Rent yourself an opinion
We're sick
Sick of fighting everyday
Sick of dying anyway

We're sick of all
You will be the one to blame
You will be the one to blame
Back in the old days
Programmed to live your life superior
But now your life is gone
But now the light is gone
We're still sick
Sick of fighting everyday
Sick of lying everyday
Sick of dying anyway
We're sick
Sick of fighting everyday
Sick of lying everyday
Sick of dying anyway
Sick of all
