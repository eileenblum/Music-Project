It's been a while we've
Lost the human poetry
The future no longer shines

The CANCER is growing
We're both
A piece of death
A piece of life
But
Can we cancel the erasing
Replacing
We're faking
Falling off the chair again

I came here to warn you
This future no longer shines
We are hypocrisy
We are wasteful
We are fantasy
But can we cancel the erasing
Replacing
We're faking
Falling off the chair again
Falling off the chair again

We're both
A piece of death
A piece of life
We're both
Morality
Insanity
Replacing
Falling off the chair again
Falling off the chair again
Falling off the chair again
