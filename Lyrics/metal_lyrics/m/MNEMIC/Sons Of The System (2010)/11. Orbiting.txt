No anger.
No pity.
My god, 
No fear!

Orbiting my thoughts around this world
I get to the point where I have to abandon all hope

So far where no one hears me now
No one hears me now

I only see the blood falling down
I get the feeling this will never happen
Barbed wire, wrapped around my face
Wrapped around my face

Orbiting in dark matter
Even death could be better

No one hears me now
See the blood falling down

I get to the point where I have to abandon it all
No one hears me anymore
Keep your head looking towards the sky
Towards the sky
Towards the sky

See the blood falling down, coming down
Man has gone where no one else has gone before
Man has gone where no one else has been before

I only see the blood falling down
I get the feeling this will never happen
Barbed wire, wrapped around my face
Wrapped around my face

No one hears me now
See the blood falling down
Down

Orbiting in dark matter
Even death could be better

Could be better...
