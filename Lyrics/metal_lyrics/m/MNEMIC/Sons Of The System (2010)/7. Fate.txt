You think you teach me
How to intensify myself
You'd better watch me
Throwing all the pressure away
You should have taught me
How to hypnotize my faith
You'd better watch me
Throwing all the pressure away

Day after day
It's just the same old song
I'm fading away

Will I get old
Will I get old
I will get old

You should have taught me
To wipe your own dirt to blind me
You should have watched me
Smashing your face up along my way
You shouldn't have told me
How to liquify my fate
You should have watched me

Will I get old
Will I get old

But through your eyes again
Some of us will stare

You think you teach me
You think you know me
You think you watch me
You think you know me

Will I get old
Will I get old

But through your eyes again
Some of us will stare
Through your eyes again

Some of us will stare...
