Take a walk
Take the last step
Towards the end
On the backbone of night
These Might be the last steps we set
As we climb to the stars
As we climb to the stars
Towards the end
A depressive earth with a depressive shape
They will tear holes into the ground
Then we will watch the world burn down
The world burn down
It seems today has come for my
Please GOD
Come save me
Take a walk
Take a step forward and don't look back
As the world burns in silence
No one's there to challenge as we climb to the stars
As we climb to the stars
It seeems today has come for me
Please GOD
Come save me
Take a walk
Take a step forward and don't look back
As the world burns in silence no one's there to challenge
As we climb towards the stars
Take a walk
Take the last step
Towards the end
On the backbone of the night
These might be the last steps we set
As we climb to the stars
As we climb to the end
It seems today has come for me
Please GOD
Come save me
