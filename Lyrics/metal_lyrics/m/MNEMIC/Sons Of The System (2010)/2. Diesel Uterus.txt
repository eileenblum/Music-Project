Adrenaline rising, twisting and crawling
Implanted inside, this chemical imbalance turns us to lifeless puppets
March in hordes, assembled as components for the new world
Screenlines dancing in our eyes
Our lives, dying in our arms
Senses bypassed by this corruption, we're all born in a diesel uterus
This chemical imbalance is telling me there is no end
A digital venom strangling the world
Screenlines dancing in our eyes
Our lives, dying in our arms
Screenlines dancing in our eyes
Our lives, dying in our arms
My dreams my believes dictated
Read your revelation from this scorched earth
Pray for your new god
Salvation is only a word
Screenlines dancing in our eyes
Our lives dying in our arms
Screenlines dancing in our eyes
Our lives dying in our arms
