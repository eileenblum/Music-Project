More than just a need
It fills you up with dark secrets
More than just a dream
Plunging yourself in a fake world

In a fake world
With fake words

More than just a fear
Filling you up with angry tears
More than just a need
Dying again and living again everyday

On the edge we stand
On the edge we stand
Alone once again
All my feelings
Are fading away

This soul domination
Is taking you away
Physical domination
But still you beg for more
But still you beg for
More than just a fear
Filling you up with angry tears
More than just a need
Dying again and living again everyday

On the edge we stand
On the edge we stand
Alone once again
All my feelings
Are fading away

More than just a need
More than just a dream
More than just a fear
More than just all

On the edge we stand
On the edge we stand

On the edge we stand
On the edge we stand
Alone once again
All my feelings
Are fading away

Are just fading away
