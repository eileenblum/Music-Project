I don't need to be like you - cuz this place belongs to me
I'm far beyond the walls you see
My mind's ablaze and numb somehow
Sunrise as my mind it sets on finding ways to block that river
It flows with the blood that is life, I got my mind made up,
I shiver
Electroshock these thoughts right through my brain
An obsession I can't kill
I don't want to kill my mind, it breathes, it feeds, I know it's
Doing well
The sacrifice will come soon enough. There's no evil
Underneath here
I don't need to be anything like you - cuz this place belongs to me
I'm far beyond the walls you see
My mind's ablaze and numb somehow
Unlike things that I control I don't want to kill my feelings
I know you want me to get in line and submit
To your intentions
I don't need to be anything like you - cuz this place belongs to me
I'm far beyond the walls you see
My mind's ablaze and numb somehow.
