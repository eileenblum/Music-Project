Flash my face no intro needed
My self-awareness has not been mistreated
Ten times the fire on a blackened sky
I won't break my in a selfish try just to
Create my ideal picture
Sex is free and my check's nine figures
The gold on my teeth draw the attention
Away from my suit, pure velvet body suspension

You know who I am

Jack's the name, style in a frame
My ego is fit and my account the same
Shelby GT, black eyes behind shades
I get out of bed as the daylight fades on me

I will knock you out - By sheer appearance
Blinded by grace - You know me
Sharpened moves - To clear interference
You know my face - Yeah you know me

You know
I feel your eyes on me; I know you're watching me
Who I am
I know it's hard to say, want to be me in every way

There's nothing wrong with the things I do
I only do them because you want me to
Ignorant, the things I do despise
What you don't understand, I'm beyond life and you

I will knock you out - by sheer appearance
Blinded by grace - you know me
Sharpened moves - to clear interference
You know my face - yeah you know me.
