Save me from my mind
I never wanted to go down like this
Why don't you save me
Show me my options that requires decisions
In an infinite line of reactions and visions
My good, my bad, my excellent choice
So innocent, my angry voice
The view of life all clean from noise
My eyes Lie
And when we're in the locomotive
I don't know what to do
Cuz I still know that I can't change
The lies that turn into truth
A part of you, a part of me
I don't know what to do
To realize the depth of life, it's just that...
A flaming desire for an innocent lust
Can change a lifetime in a second of trust
Can change the future, it'll turn out the light
We'll never know if this was right
My eyes lie
Save me from my mind
I never wanted to go down like this
Why don't you save me
From what's inside of me, what's inside of me?
It'll drive you mad if you start to think that:
The ones you turned would maybe never have met
The love of their life in a life that they hate
The drunkdriver that decided their fate
The dad of their child who's not so great
The emergency call to late
Eyes that meet and then look away
Gives birth to the thoughts of this inner decay
So action is taken after dreams that are breaking
Are turning their back to a mind that was faking
The things we do today will make tomorrow turn a different way
Completely blank, nothing to say
My eyes lie
Save me from my mind
I never wanted to go down like this
Why don't you save me
From what's inside of me.
