I have not slept for many days
Yet I have dreamt of the unseen
Now I have found this place in myself
I have dreamt of no control
And then I will see what the hate it can take
I will stand up to see what I really can be
I'll cry if I need to but I'll proceed to
A state of hate and to be a superior me
I have dreamt of this for so long
I feel my inner self will grow strong
And so I will break down, I'm blind to your ideas,
I don't want to be me, I can't stand the pain
And then I will see what the hate it can take
I will stand up to see what I really can be
I have dreamt of this for so long
I feel my inner self grow strong
If I can only be what they want
I'm me, exploding into history
I dream of leaving this
Kill this and never come back,
Never fuckin' return
I dream of me - Kill this, my dream
I have not slept for many days
Yet I have dreamt of no control
And then I will see what the hate it can take
I will stand up to see what I really can be
I'll cry if I need to but I'll proceed to
A state of hate ad to be a vision of me
I have dreamt of this for so long
I feel my inner self will grow strong
If i can only be what they want
I'm me, exploding into history.
