Penetrate my will to speak, this feeling just won't go away
Straight line through my soul and feel inability to stop this today
Hardline the drug affection, at least I know how to hurt it to perfection
The silver drop gets under my skin, my skin

I wake up - Now I'm alone again
I've been here - I didn't like it then
I bleed cuz - this is what I am
My last shot - now make me twice the man
This is what I am

And I know my time will come, my time to cross the nation
With screams of insane heresy, I label minds in frustration

Come on and lead me into the light
Twenty reasons to guide me
I need a reason to stand up and fight
Need to believe what I see
The stars are shining on me tonight
I need my wishes to come true
But through the cure I need is in sight
I'll never make it through

Reason is only a matter of opinion
Control is only an illusion to spit on
Bring my coffee, a truth to lean on
My silence is bought and my beliefs are all gone

Innocent as a new born child, no need to point your fingers
I never did the things you say, I never hurt no one in anyway so...

Come on and lead me into the light
Twenty reasons to guide me
I need a reason to stand up and fight
Need to believe what I see
The stars are shining on me tonight
I need my wishes to come true
But through the cure I need is in sight
I'll never make it through

And I know that they don't want me
And I see what it's beyond me.
