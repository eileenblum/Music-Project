Into the fire again (I'll light it up)
Deadly with venom and sin (your time is up)
I'll poison your mind (you'll poison yourself)
With things you can't find (no, you can't find)
I can't see frustration within me and
You're on your knees again (and so are you)
Want to escape my hand (I'll take you down)
I rule your every move (no, I rule you)
You're tempted by groove (and you by sound)
I really need this, I'm...
Pushing the sticks right into myself
I got no way to control this
I need the pain more than anything
I need to feel I'm alive
You're bleeding cuz of me (you're bleeding yourself)
You'll pay the devils fee (but the devil is me)
The veins in my arm (and the veins in mine)
Are on overload (they will explode)
I will explode, I'm...

[Chorus]

So many times I've taken the wrong road and still
I control you
The essence of revenge is not in you
It's in me and I don't need it
I swear if I go down I'll take you with me
There's a blow right to your face, what a violent entry
Can you feel me in your head
I know what you need, you need my pain
And everything you lose I seem to gain
I'll take it all
I will explode, I hurt you cuz I really need this, I'm...

[Chorus]
