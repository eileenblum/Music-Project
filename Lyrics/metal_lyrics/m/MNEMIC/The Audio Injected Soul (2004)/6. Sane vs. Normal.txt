Hello Mr. Richway, welcome to the sunset hotel. Thank you, I'll
fuckin' rape and kill
A girl to quote myself. Needles to say that this is a habit. "I take
it cuz I can't have it"!.
The bloody moves to grooves that are the dance of death. Skin to barbed wire
In a final breath. I made the mistakes I couldn't afford to make.
Hell, they even
Knocked on my door because they found a girl dead in the lake.
They won't catch me again - I've grown beyond my time and now...
I moved beyond recognition. I clearly lost count, an escalation of schism.
Still not sure why I do this. An overwhelming urge to reach a state of bliss?
I got it all pinned down and...
The hammer hit the nail - but I can't let them live - It's all too late for me
It's all too late for me
I hear them begging me
But I can't let them live
I can't let them live
Spill the blood and hide the bodies.
Dead girls don't tell of my done deeds. Hell, they'll do it for money.
I'll do them for free. I'm Mr. Richway, "Don't give a fuck what the bitch say"!
I told you I got it all pinned down and now...
The hammer hit the nail - But I can't let them live - It's all too late for me
It's all too late for me
I hear the begging me
But i can't let them live
I can't let them live.
