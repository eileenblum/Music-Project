Hammered through hands and feet
Rusted nails of deceit
Devoured by your disease

Watch the animal bleed
Just watch us bleeding

By the mouth covered with blisters
From my goddamn saint

20,000 lies underneath your soul
Is where it all ends
50,000 lies underneath your soul
In this dark desert where it all ends

Black rotten tongue smearing
Like a slithering snake
No way to plead the fifth
No way to plead the fifth

A journey to the center of my wound

20,000 lies underneath your soul
Is where it all ends
50,000 lies underneath your soul
In this dark desert where it all ends
Where it all ends
Where it all ends
Where it all ends
Where it all ends
