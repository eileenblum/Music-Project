When you feel so lost
And there's nothing to hold on
Lost in a golden trap
Just another ritual absurd

A single life time
Is all we need
A single life time
Is not enough

It's just a fucked up world
Into another fucked up world

See you at the end of it
This world as we know it

Your soul
Washes up on these shores
Your soul
(You) suffocate on these shores

Like the time glass you can't turn
Like the weight of the universe

Like the time glass you can't turn
Like the weight of the universe
Attached to a led cross
At the end of the road
In silence

A single life time
Is not enough

Your soul
Washes up on these shores
Your soul
(You) suffocate on these shores
Your soul
Washes up on these shores
Your soul
Washes up on these shores

A single lifetime is not enough
Not enough

Floating among planets in complete vacuum
Carrying ghost of past times
I will bury them
