I am not myself any fucking more

Smooth caresses on my ribs
Freezing and boiling
Thrown out of my schedule
Despite we tried to get it magnified

We'll never
Surrender

Reverberating the sense of life
From a butterfly to a bitter end

Into a whole new down
Like the world was never meant to be
It's just a senseless pattern
Into a whole new down
In this pattern we drown

Inside it's just a war

Will it ever end
The sacrifice of inner fuck

From a butterfly to a bitter end

It feels like I am gone
It feels like I am not the same anymore
It feels like I am gone
It feels like I am gone

Into this pattern we drown

Into a whole new down
Like the world was never meant to be
It's just a senseless pattern
Into a whole new down
In this pattern we drown
