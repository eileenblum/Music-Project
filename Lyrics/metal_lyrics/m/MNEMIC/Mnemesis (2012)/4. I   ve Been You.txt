This sight is no longer yours
Blinded you have been
Slowly crawling in my veins
A vicious disaster implanted in me

I've been you
Since day one
A compromise till the end of time
I've been you
Since day one
A compromise till the end of time

Shattering the glass that used to set me
From darkness to reality

I've been you
Since day one
A compromise till the end of time
I've been you
Since day one
A compromise till the end of time
This is humanity, a fake morality

My head is ocean
My head is mountain

It's an overwhelming sight
It's an overwhelming fake pride

It's so overwhelming
Overwhelming sight

I've been blind
I've been sick
I've been blinded
I've been stupid
