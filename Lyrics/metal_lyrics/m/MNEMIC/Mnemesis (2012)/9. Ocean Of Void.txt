Empty of sand and stones
We're tuned to the key of insanity
Steps taken with broken feet
Nebulize or enlighten the blind

Will I have to say it again
This real fake lie is true
It's such a war within our souls

These faces are all dead for me
Cause it's all fucked up

Can't feel it slowly fading
Can you feel it
You've got to feel it
And every time I close my eyes
Just an ocean of void I see

Just an ocean of void I see

Will I have to say it again
This real fake lie is true
It's such a war within our souls
Our souls

The water is providence
We forget it's providence
The fire is providence

Can't feel it slowly fading
Can you feel it
You've got to feel
And every time I close my eyes
Just an ocean of void I see

I see
Oh yeah

Imperious thirst of a past once desired

Still embracing it till the end of the earth
Still embracing it till the end of the earth
We're losing ourselves

Can't feel it slowly fading
Can you feel it
You've got to feel it
And every time I close my eyes
Just an ocean of void I see
I see
I see
That I see
