I see it
I breathe it
Can't you see
This is the Mnemesis

A third eye opening
Coming from one direction
Breathing neon, yeah
Hidden layers of reality unfold
Indulgent of pleasures and frustration

I see it
I breathe it
Can't you see
This is the Mnemesis
This is the Mnemesis

The wind that blasts from the sun
The rays that never show
Encapsulated in a sphere of skin
Of skin

I see it
I breathe it
Can't you see
This is the Mnemesis
This is the Mnemesis

An invisible boundary to be seen
Absorption of senses and time
Letters fade to black as the Mnemesis arrives
The Mnemesis arrives

I see it
I breathe it
Can't you see
This is the Mnemesis

Truth erased from the book of life
Pages ripped and torn apart
Slithering arms of venom
Stretch and unfold
Through the heart

I feel the texture through your fingertips
Taste the letters, yeah
A self deprecation unfolded

We burn the air and breathe

I see it
I breathe it
Can't you see
This is the Mnemesis

I see it
I breathe it
Can't you see
This is the Mnemesis
