Dark spatter across the ocean
Violent craving a revelation
Who would have thought you would get this far
So far &amp; completely lost

So far
With nothing to hold on

This battle, which I fight all alone
Can't let go
It's not there anymore

When everyone tells me to come home
I say hey
I'm just gone riding the storm

Please hear me now
Oh would you please hear my words
Hear this
Please hear me now
Oh would you please hear my words
I need that beacon
I need this storm

Your words spoken
I've already said
I've surfed these circles before
Never have I been so close
To losing myself in this storm
Twisting out of control

Will I ever let go?
I am just a junkie on the storm

Please hear me now
Oh would you please hear my words
Hear this
Please hear me now
Oh would you please hear my words
I need that beacon
I need this
That beacon in the storm
I need that beacon
I need this storm
