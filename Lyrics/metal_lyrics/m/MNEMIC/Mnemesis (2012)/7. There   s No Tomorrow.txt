Like there's no tomorrow
Like there's no turning back

We give it away
Yeah we give it away

Despite we know it all
Despite we know it all
Despite we know it all
We let it go

Like we always need a purpose
We always need a little distance

I won't give it away
I won't give it away

Perpetually catching up with who we are
Just a state of mind
Will you give it away
Will you give it away
Like there's no tomorrow

Despite we know it all
Despite we know it all
Despite we know it all
We let it go
