Chaos
The beating of my heart
The silence unbroken by this vast darkness
That is me the explorer
The soul in me burning bright
That is me the voyager
Spoken words, by me, The Passenger
I have traveled to the infinite
That is me the blind visitor
Can anyone hear me?
Awake yourself
Do you know what you're for?
Is anyone out there?
