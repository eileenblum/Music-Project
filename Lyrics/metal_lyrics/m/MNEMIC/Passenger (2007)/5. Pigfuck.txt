Wrap your clod blooded
Arms around my back.
Embrace this body,
Like I'm the one
Your words crawl beneath my skin
Layer by layer piercing me within
Scraping my walls,
Truthfully exploding within my heart.
Your mouth covered in filth
Of a thousand eyes
That kept watching you dissipate
The liquid from their minds
Pigfuck
Memories burning in my mind
I don't want to remember
Look into your soul
And you will know.
Within this blackened heart
The worms make you the one.
Strip them, shave and suck,
I am no longer able to interact
Unable to interact
Memories deleted from
My memory storage.
Memories burning in my mind
I don't want to remember
To remember
Pigfuck
