It was getting closer
Scraping my thoughts
Never meant to fall that down
Scraping into myself
Immeasurable state of mind
Wasn't meant to be a part of me but still
You always touch me
You always find me
Where the hell could I hide from you
Raping my memories
Raping what I am doing with devotion
Raping my damn memories
Raping what I am with such a devotion
Don't play your dirty tricks on me
I'll find the key of that cage you placed me in
Don't play tricks your tricks now
I never meant to be this way
I could not run away
I won't let you dig inside myself any longer
Surrounded in every corners
Dragging me down in paranoia you left me
Emotional nothingness remains there
Then nothing more I can feel stuck here with my self
I never meant to be this way
I could not run away
Dragging me down
Can anything happen then in this suffering you left me
I'm stuck here
Don't come around anymore
I got the key to make you go away
But I got the key to hold you inside of me
Hold you inside of me
Can anything happen then in this suffering you left me
I'm stuck here
Don't come around anymore
I got the key to make you go away
But I got the key to hold you inside of me
You always touch me
You always find me
I never meant to fall that down
I never meant to be this way
I could not run away
It was getting closer
I never meant to be this way
