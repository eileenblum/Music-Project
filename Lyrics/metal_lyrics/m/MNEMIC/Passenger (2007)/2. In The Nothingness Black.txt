A harmonious whole
Everything is a repetitive pattern
Blocks of time to fit the puzzle
Leading to question without answer
I - a harmonious half
Awaiting death through the hourglass
Burning color off the soul
No character, no recognition factor
The hourglass keeps turning but still
Without no sand running
Rustborn not in reason nor in prose
But in doubt of the damn mirror ghost
Awaken back in truth
In the nothingness black ocean
Awaken back in truth
In the nothingness black ocean
Walk upon this earth, we all are worms
Quenching hearts, within these empty bodies,
We might find something, if we look close,
I want to tear my skin,
I want to tear your skin.
Spread your wings like the lies
Awaken back in truth
In the nothingness black ocean
Awaken back in truth
In the nothingness black ocean
Black ocean
I want to tear my skin,
I want to tear your skin.
Spread your wings like the lies
I am the spirit of truth
The chief messenger
I remain outside the
Heavenly curtain
As of now, no one is calling me
Devil and this is no act of god.
Chaos
Back in truth
Awaken back in truth
In the nothingness black ocean
Awaken back in truth
In the nothingness black ocean
Black ocean
