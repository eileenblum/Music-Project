Introducing myself
Introducing myself
With that mask that suits you fine
Shadows before numerous shapes
I'm so bored
I'm so sick
Praises sound deeply useless
With no retreat I claim who I am
What I am
Tired and bored
I'm so bored
Grab my heart before I'm gone
(Grab my heart before I'm gone)
Before I'm gone
Stretchers keep my world alive
What's left
Just try to feed my past
Before I'm gone
Stretchers keep my thoughts alive
What's left
Just try to feed my past, try to feed my past
Before I'm gone
Stretchers keep my world alive
What's left, just try to feed my past
Before I'm gone
Stretchers keep my thoughts alive
What's left
Just try to feed my
Just try to feed my past
My past, I'm tired and bored
I'm tired and bored
Grab my heart before I'm gone
Before I'm gone away
Grab my heart before I'm gone
Before I'm gone away
I'm wasting my oneness
Feeling half alive
A permanent brainstorm
My body is losing its fucking form
Before I'm gone
Stretchers keep my world alive
What's left, just try to feed my past
Before I'm gone
Stretchers keep my thoughts alive, what's left
