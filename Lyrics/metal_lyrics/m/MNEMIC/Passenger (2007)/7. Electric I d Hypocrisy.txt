Where's the liberation we've all dreamt of
It has abandoned the world and left us alone
Falling into oblivion
Never quite reaching bottom
No point of collision
Only cold striving the perception
We're without eyes
We're without ears
Lets all gather there
In this hypocrisy
Our lives
Come on, let's waste it away
Our lives,
Come on, let's waste it away
Each man, the image of each other
Back into a physical reality exploding
Into multiple identities
We're without eyes
We're without ears
Let's all gather there
In this hypocrisy
Our lives
Come on, let's waste it away
Our lives,
Come on, let's waste it away
A mass stench from this bile
Traveling like a dry ocean
Without eyes, without ears
Let's all gather here
In this electric-eyed hypocrisy
For everyone orbiting
Tonight straight to the head
Death is where the heart is
Born without a face
Like a sense of motion with potential
Of causing darkness
We're without eyes
We're without ears
Let's all gather here
In this hypocrisy
In this electric eyed hypocrisy
