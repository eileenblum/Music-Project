Watch your back now
I used to trust you
You used to trust me
Such a oneness we patiently phased
I used to follow you
You used to follow me
You used to stare at me with overreaction
With overreaction
We have nothing in common
But the psyko orgasm, yeah
We have nothing in common, no
But the social orgasm, yeah
So, don't want to live this again
It's too much for me
Too much for me
Too much for me
Fuck your lying truth
Fuck your lying compromise
You're not the only one that fails
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
You were all for me
I was all for you
How could this be possible true?
You were all for me
I was all for you
How could this be possibly fucking true?
So, don't want to live this again
It's too much for me
Too much for me
Too much for me
Display of weakness
In such a goddamn mess
Don't turn your back on me
Don't put the fault on me
Display of weakness
In such a goddamn mess
Don't play your tricks on me
Don't turn your back on me
You're not the only one that fails
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
