I won't let this go from me 
We cherish this love forever This promise ill hold from 
young  to were old death do we all part our family  this
IS it! Turn the page now new chapter of this life and 
what we've become Moving forward getting stronger
There's love in our lives now Love love  Save me I am the
one  help me  I needed you Change me  This is my cry you 
saved me  You have changed my whole world 
Saved me from all this hurt You are my malak
