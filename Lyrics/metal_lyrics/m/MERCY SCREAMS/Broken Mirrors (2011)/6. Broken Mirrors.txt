SO TIRED OF THIS LIFE I LIVE 
CONSEQUENCES OF MY CHOICES RUN AROUND IN CIRCLES 
AGAIN AND AGAIN RUN AWAY  FIND  MYSELF IN THE SAME PLACE 
KEEP ON AROUND  SEPERATE FROM ALL DESTRACTIONS FOLLOW 
MY HEART AND BURN BURN THE BRIDGE AND WALK AWAY WALK 
AWAY JUST WALK AWAY TO FIND YOURSELF HOLD STRONG  
NEVER GIVE UP NEVER BACKDOWN NEVER LOOKING NOW IN 
THE MIRROR I SEE WHO I REALLY AM THE CHILD I ONCE WAS 
THE MAN IVE BECOME LIVING WITH A MEANIG HERE FOR 
SOMETHING MORE LIVE FOR SOMETHING OR DIE FOR 
NOTHING FIND YOUR WAY STEADFAST BRIDGE THE 
BRIDGES WALK AWAY I WONT TURN BACK NOW THIS IS SO 
MUCH GREATER ONCE WAS BROKEN MIRRORS NOW I SEE MY 
REFLECTION WONT TURN BACK NOW I WONT  TURN BACK
