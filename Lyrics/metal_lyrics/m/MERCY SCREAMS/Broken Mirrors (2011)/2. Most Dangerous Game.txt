everything that ive touched 
is left destroyed this pain and anger left ignored im 
screaming for answers but only silence the torment this 
agony ive endured  we are animals  we are  the prey we are the 
hunters  we are the straywe are the stray  caught in the 
snare  left  for dead i sit there looking to  the sky 
remembering  what it was that led me to where i am  my 
demise  were eye to eye the hunter to his prey such a  
familiar face  i am the one i am the monster i am the one 
i am the monster i am the one
