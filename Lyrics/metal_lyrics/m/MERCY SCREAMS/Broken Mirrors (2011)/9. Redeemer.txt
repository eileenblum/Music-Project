NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD GO THIS FAR BUT WE 
ARE STANDING HERE HAND IN HAND WE FOLLOW HIS WORD AND 
HIS FOOTSTEPS I WILL NOT LET YOU FALL IN THE MIDST OF IT ALL
WE SHALL STAND STRONG AND CARRY ON OUR CHOICES ARE MADE 
NO LONGER SLAVES THIS IS OUR FREEDOM from pain of this
world from this shame we are cleansed we are redeemed
we are given the blood of our father we will not stand
down.
