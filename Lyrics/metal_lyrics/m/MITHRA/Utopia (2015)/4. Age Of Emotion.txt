Trying resisting the urge
The thrilling in your soul
Still you are human after all

Of the failures led by this confusion
Essential ones always the most painful

Quench the fire 
Move on to your promised land 
Where rivers flow with desire 
Set fire to sea
Ignoring the quantity
For you are no longer in captivity

My heart has averted its feels
Avoiding facing its guilt and its fears
But cuffs must be broke down
For those ones to set themselves free

Then you wake up, with sudden clarity
You regret your fondness
Missed the rational, lived with suspicion
Believed your heart, despite your mind

Quench the fire
Move on to your promise land
And pass this age of emotion..

Quench the fire, and move on

My heart has averted its feels
Avoiding facing its guilt and its fears
But cuffs must be broke down
For those ones to set themselves free

Never again, will I be caged this way
After this final time
I shall be free
