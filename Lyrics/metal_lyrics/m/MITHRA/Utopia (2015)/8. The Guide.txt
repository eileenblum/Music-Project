Greatest

Greatest changes are done
Without realizing
Smallest thing in life, are the most beautiful
Mistakes make us human
Standing firm despite of them
Makes us heroes

Heroes

Look to see
Touch to feel
Hear to understand
We may lose 
Even if we made
No mistakes 
No mistakes 

 Act with nobility and wisdom
Realize what youâre given 
And settle with it!
Remember to keep breathing

Keep breathing 
So tiring the life is 
We must savour and treasure
Every little happiness

Look to see
Touch to feel
Hear to understand
We may lose
Even if we made
No mistakes

In our mind, we are perfect
Can do anything, but life's a different story
To win take a step
Without forgetting
And ever regret.

My trails, my path

And I'll be your guide
Show you the way
Follow me
I'll be your guide
