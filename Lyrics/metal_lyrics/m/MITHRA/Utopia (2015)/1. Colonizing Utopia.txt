We remember

We remember the rise of the sun
The wavering lights 

The crash of waves onto the sand
While on a cold nights breeze 
Fly of the ravens in grace 
We remember before the storm

Far from the lies, glamour all the regions

Finally sky
The sky is our, glamour all religions
Assembly

The only way to reclaim, humanity
To outlast calamity, to create our own paths
To live and believe

Weâve suffered and altered 
No heaven altogether
This cleave, demise
Lead to greater divides
Start our new lives
Whatâs scattered now all gathered 
Our hopes and dreams
All in Utopia

Far from the lies, glamour all the regions
Finally sky
The sky is our, glamour all religions
Itâs the down
This is the down, start of unison
To reach to reach
To reach the peak of civilization

Now hear the feeling of our ancestors, crying
Now hear the use of creation, the light of a new down

Reach high
Beyond your dreams
To the skies
Further on
And never give up
Beyond the orb
See the sphere
Let it lift you
Watch it fall
Until the sun
Our hopes and dreams
Utopia
