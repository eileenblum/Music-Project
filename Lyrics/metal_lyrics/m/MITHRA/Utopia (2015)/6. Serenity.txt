Buffeted by harsh winds, pelted by stinging rain
Still he will not, utter a single word

Could be said, that in death,
He, has become, a thing of love

Buffeted by harsh winds, Pelted by stinging rain

He, does not hate, does not kill, does not steal
Already he, does not hate, does not kill, does not steal
For Serenity

Left where he is, he will selflessly
Provide sustenance, for eternity
Still he will not utter a single word against
For eternity

For serenity, Unavoidable

Far greater than any living being 
Could hope to be

Death is, that which
Completes man, completes man.

Far greater than, any living being
Could be said, that in death,
He, has become, a thing of love

Buffeted by harsh winds, Pelted by stinging rain

He, does not hate, does not kill, does not steal
Already he, does not hate, does not kill, does not steal
For Serenity
