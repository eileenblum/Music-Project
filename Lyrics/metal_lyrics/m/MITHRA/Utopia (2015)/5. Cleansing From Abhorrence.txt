Here I am, again
Running in circles
But this time, to get rid of all the foulness
All these struggles 
And abhorrences 
The cause is, nothing else
Nothing else, than the empty graves

Selfishness
From all above and below 
Loneliness
The path where Iâve stepped in
Feel of disgust inside me killing me 
I need to trace, I need to see the flames
Of eternal light

As the cycle continues
Me, the crawler
Hide and try, to spot their heels
As we feed the time
It goes on, It goes on
And onâ¦

Selfishness
From all above and below 
Loneliness
The path where Iâve stepped in
Feel of disgust inside me killing me 
I need to trace, I need to see the flames
Of eternal light

It canât be done
It will never be
Even when giving my last breath
It will only stay
As my perfection

Resurrection
Salvation
Hope

The world I keep in
The path Iâve chosen
I embrace it

The pain I hide in
The breath that I hold in
I release it

I embrace it
I release it

Feel of disgust inside me killing me 
I need to trace
I need to see the flames
