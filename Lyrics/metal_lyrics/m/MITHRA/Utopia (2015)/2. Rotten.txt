This world is rotten
Rotten

And now, as the darkness has passed
We are all that remains the people
And now as the plague has passed away
All thatâs left is sickness
We are the people
We are rotten

In justice for all
And justice for none

All that waiting and hoping in vain
That leaves us in pain 
All that feeding and giving for naught
Much left to say about
And the pieces are stuck on me
Looking me
We must stand, for one, last, night
We must stand, as one

Destiny, given to me
Initiate, and start a new
After time, waiting for me
Blossom and come through
Revive this paradise

Come fight it, come face it, so shatter it
All are seeking, to leash it, reveal it
On a last stand 
On a last, stand

Nothing will return 
All these ruins
Shall be burnt 
Rancour is a part of this damnation
And no one can withstand
Betrayal is a part of self-destruction
And all pieces are rotten
No one can withstand
All pieces are rotten
