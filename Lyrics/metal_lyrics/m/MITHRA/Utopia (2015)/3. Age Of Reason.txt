We hear the voice of the rationale
Listen to it blindly
Jailed our feelings
Long lost and forgotten
Reveal the notions
And throw them to the bottom
Make way, for minds

They are the voices in your heart
They are the speeches of your soul 

Of your soul
For you are no longer in apathy

Time to release, the scraps of what remains, 
Of my, inner self 
Of my inner self
Who, listens to, who compromises with
With no one

Listen to it 
Listen to your heart

And thereâs no room for fears 
Listen to your soul!  
And thereâs no need for worries
Age of reason is upon us
