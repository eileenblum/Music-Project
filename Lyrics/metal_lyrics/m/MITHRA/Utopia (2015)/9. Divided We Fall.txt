And the rule still stands within
Divinity
As the time elapses still, world regrows
For you to see
Embark upon this journey 
And join eternal demise

They feel, they swear the sacred
They fear, they swear the sacred

One faith
To carve ourselves into
One Life
To sacrifice to for holiness
Their reign is at an end
Their powers are all just
Mirages
Only saviour lives in theirs greedinesses
Weeping souls, searching for comfort
Constant race, leaving you, warn out
Divided we fall
As a bundle of roads
We Fall
