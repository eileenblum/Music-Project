Gave up hope let go off the light
On each day scouting from the sky
Enough seen enough mind for the moon
Enough deem to fall of from the sky

Gave up hope let go off the light
Cast off the world in the dark
Vacancy trails of empty sky
Nothing but the peace left to die
Peace is left to die

Oh the look out of the night
Never give never tell whatâs inside
Stand still when all is said and done 
To search for all thatâs left behind

Seek us, Reach us
Watching and, Follow us
Majestic, Fragile
Descended, Gone
Lunar Tears

Live and laugh now while still you can
Manage love with every single cell
Corruption lies right at the door
Last chance to bring back the moon

Live and laugh now while still you can
Those days will never come again
Corruption lies right at the door
Deception feels like poison thorn

Oh the lookout of the night
Never give never tell whatâs inside
Stand still when all is said and done 
To search for all thatâs left behind

Seek us, Reach us
Watching and, Follow us
Majestic, Fragile
Descended, Gone
Lunar Tears

Can our sins again be forgiven?
Hours pass as long as hours last
Can hope win against the ruthless past?
Can the lost be always found again?

My voice my life
My soul and my eyes
An oath I swore
A hope to hold on for

My voice my life
My soul and my eyes
An oath I swore
I'll fill the sky

Seek us, Reach us
Watching and, Follow us
Majestic, Fragile
Descended, Gone
Lunar Tears
