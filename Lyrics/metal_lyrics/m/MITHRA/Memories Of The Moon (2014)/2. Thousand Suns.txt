The fear is mourn 
But always canât control
Unreal these tears
Behind of all emotions
Take sin from ocean
All souls are reach inception
It stills and reads
The final dead generation

Ride to your endless war
And follow the hopeless dreams
Grounded again, and surrender lifes
Bury inside of the feat

All my weaknesses
Regretful lifes
All against and fall of us
Fear is your demise
Wanted, unrivalled the star
Which canât true, it is enough
Without remorse and forgive us
Power of thousand suns

It's so cold 
And so dark
Against the wall 
Against the dark

Against the wall 
Against the dark
