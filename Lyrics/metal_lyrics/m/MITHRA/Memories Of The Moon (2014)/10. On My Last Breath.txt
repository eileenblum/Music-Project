Keep Alive

Now, we've gone, too long we lost, our hopes
Leaving those
Dead in souls
Canât find a match, in the coldness
Separated
Torn asunder
Look for me 
Look for me inside

My goals, my friends, my reasons
My whole life was 
Sacrificed
In trail, of your shadow 
Leaving myself behind
So stay with me know
Donât give up on me know

Now, you seek me 
Now you know
What it feels like
But, when the world's falling apart 
Donât find me 
Donât look for me
Keep alive

Laying down, on the face of Hell
Canât see you, canât see the sky
Cold on the skin
Blood on the ground
Know it know 
On this day I die

My only wish was to be there with you
On My Last Breath
And be dead 
Alone
I always had your love
I curse the day you were taken

And now, the world is done for
You will live and
Remember Me
When the world's falling apart 
Donât find me 
Donât look for me
Keep alive
