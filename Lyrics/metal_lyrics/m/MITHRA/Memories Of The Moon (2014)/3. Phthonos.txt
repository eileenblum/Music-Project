Lie to be seen
Conceive the harmony 
Feel the pressure
Of your enemy

Forsake me from your sins
Drop me down from your wings

It's a crime, to love, to care
A judgement, of firmament
Quotations, of daily routine
Aspirations, awake

Some plague that shatters me apart
Of my whale self
Put me to pieces
Let the shards
Be the end of this curse
Be the wound, of their heart

Phthonos
Oh grant me 
Phthonos

Grant me a life
Hold me a sign

Give colour to my green eyes
