Stand against the law
It's about the beast in all
Recessional of bawl
Liberty's in the dragon's claw

Drown in fears
Waste of tears
Deportation
Full of primal hate

Gleam of hope
Dream for globe
Restriction
Threatful days

Constancy and faith
It was point of deadly debate
Donât believe the fate
Itâs about how the world is create

Stand against the law
It's about the beast in all
Recessional of bowl
Liberty is in the dragon's claw
