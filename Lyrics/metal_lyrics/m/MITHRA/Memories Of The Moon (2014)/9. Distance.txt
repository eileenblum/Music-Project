Look, to find
Keep, to send away
Go, and follow
And sleep, to waste

Read my safe, my soul, my mind
Live in disguise, fallen to lies
Give up all the dreams, for her
And find your way, through the night

Forgotten words, keep ringing in my head
Million times, again
Long lost eyes, missed in the pit
Staringly deep, in the soul
Marching, away from myself
From my hopes, my dreams and more
This is end, the end my love
Never to be again

Read my safe, my soul, my mind
Live in disguise, fallen to lies
Give up all the dreams, for her
And find your way, through the night

The moon, the sky, the wind
Laughing at me
Judging me
For once 
For once
I'll sleep
