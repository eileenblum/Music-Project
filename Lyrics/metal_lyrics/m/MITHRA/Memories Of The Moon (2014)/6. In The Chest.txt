Emotions made it glitter
Hate makes it round
Love makes it all shattered
Revenge helps it rise
Rise

An egg in the chest, of all human beings
Canât be control 
It rise according to its own purpose
It canât be denied 

Container of the heart
Pandora's box
As the cover slips through my finger
Darkness flies
Flies

An egg in the chest, of all human beings
Canât be control 
It rise according to its own purpose
It canât be denied 
Somewhere deep inside my body 
There is a mind 
As the crow makes it way out side
My mind cries 
So it cries
