The weakness will conquer the world
My pain will kill them all
Cursed God won't help us
Because we all are unborn

Born in fire
Burn on pyre
Walk in the Hell
Without a fear
You can't hear
Deads are alive

Die in fire
Burn on pyre
End of the pain
Without a fear
You can't hear
Deads are alive

Immortals are dead 
Today is rise of the hate
Your life locked in the cage
Hope can't change the fate

Sanctified life is only a dream
Close your mind and feel my scream

Born in fire
Burn on pyre
Walk in the Hell
Without a fear
You can't hear
Deads are alive

Die in fire
Burn on pyre
End of the pain
Without a fear
You can't hear
Deads are alive

Immortals are dead 
Today is rise of the hate
Your life locked in the cage
Hope can't change the fate

All deads are counted
And they will coalesce
They want to quite
Shut up and hide in the grave

Sins are ash which drown you in the hell
Your hate is fire that destroy all the fate

Shut up and hide in the grave
Cursed God hates us all

Die

The weakness will conquer the world
My pain will kill them all 
Cursed God won't help us 
Because we all are unborn
