Turn away to ruins 
Of broken minds
And memories
Light shined from the sky
And will soon to be

Ghost of all decisions
Of your life 
And suffering
Our soul cry

At fate, given all the roads
All the options all the chores
A slice, of the killer cold
Raining down 
Chilling all the shores

No ships will sail away
No memories will stay
Given all the roads given all the chores
Listen, hear the voice of our souls

Too cold
Uneasy chord
Freeze my conscious
Becoming all my loss
Echoes of my loss

Our life, have been too long 
Didnât find the safe 
Didnât find the rope
Our fate, is sealed away
Behind the silence 
Behind the hate

No ships will sail away
No memories will stay
Given all the roads given all the chores
Listen, hear the voice of our souls

Too cold
Uneasy chord
Freeze my conscious
Echoes of my loss
