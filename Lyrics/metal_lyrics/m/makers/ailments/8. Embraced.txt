You make me better than I ever wanted to be
In this moment I'll take my time
so put my love my trust in your heart cuz you're mine
I promise you thar this is who i wanted to be
This isn't me wasting my time
I swear to you that we will always be fine

And all I know is tonight
I'm not alone in this fight
I'll give all i have to you now
And all I know is tonight
My love for you is just right
I'll give you all I have
All I have...

Sleeping next to you brings a smile to my face
I feel the sheets moving slowly
My heart is suddenly warmer by your embrace

And all I know it tonight
I'm not alone in this fight
I'll give all I have to you now
And all I know is tonight
My love for you is just right
I'll give you all I have
All I have...

You've given me all that I've wanted
All that I've wanted

And all I know is tonight
I'm not alone in this fight
I'll give all I have to you now

We'll live our life and we love

When we die I'll always be the one
To hold you hand to cry you'll be the one
That I will always love.
