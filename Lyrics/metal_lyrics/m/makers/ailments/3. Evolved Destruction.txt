Distance yourself

My patience, My patience.. my time is wasting
Me and my greed will never stop till the end.
These strings will never break
In time ill wilt away
Its time to take on the impossible
I will rise above you

Oh my, what do I do?
Give me the tools to follow through
This world's in need of love to keep
This greed and hate beyond its FEET.
Our only world

Our only world
Filled with a people
That can not stop their need for more
A greed so strong, destroys the people
Our very earth that we walk on
How can we live life like this?
Is there any hope
So i'll pray... for all the children
Who will suffer the years to come
I never never could imagine it like this
It never had to be me putting up my fists

My fist
So i'll put the pen to the paper
Show the world that the time is now
Reclaim what belongs to the people
Lets not destroy what is left in this life

It's time to save ourselves
It's time to save everyone else
Everyone else

Let us change
For all mankind

Our only world
Filled with a people
That can not stop their need for more
A greed so strong, destroys the people
Our very earth that we walk on
So I'll pray... for all the children
Who will suffer the years to come
I never never could imagine it like this
It never had to be me putting up my fists.
