Bang! Bang!

My minds like a loaded gun
The things in my head
Are pushing me to do the stupidest things I swear
You're nothing more to me
Than my fist in your face
And I will watch you hit the floor
Damn
I have busted your lip and now I'm wanting and needing more
Damn
My heart has been racing
My knife has been tasting the flesh on your bones
Its just repeated, Repeated and now I feel the need to run home
But where is home for me?

You are a killer
You are a monster

Did you take a look in his eyes
When you took his sons from his side
Did you take a look in his eyes
When his wife went blind from your knife
Take a look in his eyes.
