It's the end of the world

Are you ready for what we've created
The waters are at our door step
The carnage is happening
Our flesh will be ripped from our bones

Sleeping with one eye open
We were warned but we never would listen
My lips crack from thirst
This is the way we are to live
And everybody will cry
Everybody will cry for their God to take their lives
This is the way of mankind
But the suffering will not stop
This is the punishment for those who don't believe

We are under!

We are under a higher power
Why are you taking all our lives
To me this doesn't seem to be alright
But this is the end of the line
I'm ready to die
I'm ready to fly

Breathe, Just breathe
This isn't the end now
Breathe, Just breathe
Were all in the breakdown of what is happening
It's happening

I can't breathe
The lions are coming

They've ripped me apart
And this is all i'll ever know
With the eyes on the back of my head
There will be no peace
To comfort me on the darkest night
I watch the sun set for the last time

I believe the makers will return someday
But until that day comes
It's the end of the world
I am ready to die
I am ready to fly.
