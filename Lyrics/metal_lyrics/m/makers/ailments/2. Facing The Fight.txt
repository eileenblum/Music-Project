Face the fight and I will always be there
Always waking but never knowing the way
Break these cuffs that bind these hands together
There's got to be a way out of this place
I thought I knew the way
But I always fell flat on my face
This needs to end or begin
A new days in store for me
Face the fight
Life's a battle that can always be won
Live not die
When the world turns its back on you
You stand up
Stand up for whats right
Its time

I always thought you were gone
Never knowing never knowing
You were here
Even as time went on
Never knowing never knowing
You were here
You were always here

Then came the most beautiful thing
Most beautiful thing
It changed my life
It's for the best
It's for the best
This is a new life this is a new time
I will never go back to that place
I'll die the few that change my life
You have shown me the love and the light
The light

I always thought you were gone
Never knowing never knowing
You were here
Even as time went on
Never knowing never knowing
You were here
You were always here.
