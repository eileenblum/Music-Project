My youth I give for pain
The best years I give for nothing
For the price of orders
To realize their stupid ideals

My youth I give for pain 
The best years I give for nothing 
For the price of orders 
To realize their stupid ideals 
To show l am nothing to bleed 
To the sound of the shutting

I go out with no many 
I die of problems the cruel time 
Clanches the fits to strike 
Below the belt so I can die 
Telepathy of pain.....
