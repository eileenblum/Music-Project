For the price of life
I am phantom but l am
I make minds in your brain
I live to come and go away
With gesture again
You can remove me some bit
Consence and brain you cant remove
You can't just go away and you must win
You'll hear myself cry
Seen little being which I seem be
I only want to live
Loser.....
