Look in my soul and read
Invisible thoughts
Dream and fears
End don't tell me you see no thing
There i am all bleeding
With the problems of the human world
I am invisible because
Different I am
Different again
I'm victim again
I'm different again

Into a distant darkness 
You go without me 
Wait a moment and 
Cure my scars 
I will give you a bloody reflection for luck 
When you see the power in my eyes 
My body will be 
Tarn by vultures again 
End my soul will be 
Last again
Look l am a different one 
I am anger
