Heavy cross for hypocrytes - the way
From wounds in your hands
Blood won't flow out
Apparent sorrows
There won't be the end
From their eyes tear won't flow

Palm will reach into book of justice
Almighty law which rewards
and rebukes
Thorny crown given by false supporters
Will hurt your temple

Die who first betrayed
Poisoning food everyday
The blade which hewed this cross
Will appear to cut off your head...

Die who first betrayed
Poisoning food everyday
The blade which hewed this cross
Will appear to cut off your head...

Whipped all the lairs who live their roles
Let myth dies being weaved
so delicately
They will give a pain to all similar ones
New wounds will be opened from
the old scars

Palm will reach into book of justice
Almighty law which rewards
and rebukes
Thorny crown given by false supporters
Will hurt your temple
