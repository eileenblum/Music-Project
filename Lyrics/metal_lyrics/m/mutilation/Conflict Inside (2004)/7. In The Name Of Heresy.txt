Preachers from the dark star
Their minds have become
inside enslaved
Preaching nonsense about
ascension
Keep poisoning now my mind
Show where to turn
Warped into their bloody nation
Determined I trample on
everything
Onece resolutely done
See the shadow - dead intentions
Keep piosoning now my mind
Show where to turn
Key to illumination

Where to turn
What will strenghten
Where to turn
What will strenghten

Not to fall - conception
No dark powers humanity's
worst nightmare

Where to turn
What will strenghten
Where to turn
What will strenghten

...a past judgement
now reeking of lowlessness
sick hangmen puts the rope
on a wood...

Blood in their hands
Blood in their hands
Blood in...

Not to fall - conception
No dark powers humanity's
worst nightmare
