There's no place for me...
Ther's no place for me
Not this time, not this place
I's not my wars roaring with echoes
Yet with grief I will walk away
Walk away...

The conflict of feelings
and icy conscience
When the heart is slowly freezing
It's not my world this sinking boat
Though I drew myself to this
Bought prayer is not my altar
And the sin confessed
when my mind is in the dark
Now they will play with
derissive gesture
Three sixes now throw at dice

Killing poison...
...String viens...
Mixture of...
...hatred,fear...
Not my fault...
...The second's gonna...
Bite the dust...
...When this duel's over

The conflict of feelings
When the heart
is slowly freezing
It's not my world
this sinking boat...

There's no place for me...
Ther's no place for me
Not this time, not this place
I's not my wars roaring with echoes
Yet with grief I will walk away
Walk away...
