I remember nothing
Don't remember day
Don't remember night
Burn to the rest

Mind's so distant
Created for itself
Without help - strangle
Thoughts in my head
Burnt memories
Dreams no more
Just here, just now
Became a stone

Revolt in myself
In the oblivion
So strange
Than yesterday
And before...

Remember nothing
But yesterday is still in me
Uncertainty leads to future
It's too much for me
Remember nothing
Don't remember day
Don't remember night
Burn to the rest

Revolt in myself
In the oblivion

I remember nothing
Don't remember day
Don't remember night
Burn to the rest

Mind's so distant
Created for itself

Without help - strangle
Thoughts in my head

Revolt in myself
In the oblivion
So strange
Than yesterday
And before...

Remember nothing
But yesterday is still in me
Uncertainty leads to future
It's too much for me
Remember nothing
Don't remember day
Don't remember night
Burn to the rest
