What is your number and...
What's the path...???

Hats off Your heads
Butn down disease
Let dogs devour
Debris of Your
New faith will down
Your mind's break down
You are the crowd
Instead of path

High time to...
Demean Yourself...
Honour showed...
To cowards...

New values
Are being served
Worm like You can do
anything

Degenerated...
Burn down your
decaloque...

Crucifix instead of god
Chemicals decay
Row of shaved heads
imprinted
With burnt codes...
Infections in head

Degenerated...
Burn down your
decaloque...

Crucifix instead of god
Chemicals decay
Row of shaved heads
imprinted
With burnt codes...
Infections in head

I will... I will die...
