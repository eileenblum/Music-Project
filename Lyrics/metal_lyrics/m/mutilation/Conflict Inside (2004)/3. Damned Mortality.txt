No way out and no way to hide
Feel the desert dry inside
Lonely day pass another one
To slow night to pass

Where is my god damned mortality

Look - with glassy eyes
Words has dried up - in my mouth
I won't never - untagle
Thick ropes twisted
- from misunderstood

Where is my god damned mortality

Struggle my dream and reality
Where is my god damned mortality
Thoughts, guess work and words
All of them, so discord

Where is my god damned mortality

Glassy eyes but tears flow out
I'll always say my line first
After I'll cut the past
Hot thoughts I'll cool down

Tomorrow, there's no hope
Yesterday stole the rope
Illusions lied repeatedly
Our time becomes the truth

Where is my god damned mortality

Tomorrow, there's no hope
Yesterday stole the rope
Illusions lied repeatedly
Our time becomes the truth
