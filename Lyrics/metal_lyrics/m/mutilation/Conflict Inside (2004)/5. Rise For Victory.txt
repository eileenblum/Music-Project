Rise for victory
Rise for victory
Rise for victory
Rise for victory

Until they rise for victory
To sit with all saint's crew
Posthumously worshiped
Throne filled with...
Filled with hypoctisy
Here comes the lord

Golden coins which
grows up
Unfaithful braveness
Lack of power
Which gives away...
Instead of rising it
Unscrupulous...
Golden recipe for miracle
Which devours... Itself

Rise for victory
Rise for victory
Rise for victory
Rise for victory

Conspiracy made in secret
Impure days makes
another frustration
Like a deep pitcher
with evil inside
How much should
I drink to drain
The soul's infection
Secret...

Rise for victory
Rise for victory
Rise for victory

The sin won't be
The only punishment
Burning sinsiter...
Mountains of fire
Authoritatian law
Will be the first
What is the reason
To torch the pyre...

Rise for victory
