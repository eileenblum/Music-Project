Your world is a lie
Your words are soulles
Changing the facts
For thousand times
Torn apart inside
There are two faces
Two different mirror images
Eternal struggle of your mind

Honour lost in lies
Pretender worn out by the truth
See the path unfolding
Befor him
Wants to...
Run backward...
First stone...
Of falsehood he hurls

From exact extream to another
Two souls live within one existence
Whatever is said he will repeat
The harmony liberates
In remembrance of enemies
There's nothing in fear you killed
It's always easier to live
Than turn out to be coward

Defeat's not an option
One lie feeds another
Still two faces
And each one is bleeding...
