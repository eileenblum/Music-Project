For suspense - rest
Immortality for vanishing
For hearts - love and blood
And laugh in faces of fools

Adversity rules the world
We can't make sword from intentions
So for the place - boody war
For immortality - forgotten grave

World is heading to nothingness
How hard is rowing against the stream
So for hearts - sharpest thorn
For lazy fools - sincrete homage

For beloved gods - yelp of faithful souls
When demon in eyes - indifference
In begining of the world - his fall
For dreams about it - sleeplesness
