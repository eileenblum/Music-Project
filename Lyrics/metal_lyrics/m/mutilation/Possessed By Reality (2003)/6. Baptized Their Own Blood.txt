Baptized their own blood
Ungreatful human race is looking with envy
Degenerated in destitution and prosperity
Doomsday still in front of god

Waiting for biblical flood
You will drown today
Disbelief from belief - it appears
Exaggerated meditations - foolishness

Infernal fire which should arrive
Don't you stand in flames??? Now???
From existence to nothingness
- it creates themselves
Conscience injure but it's secret

Searching for antichrist
Splutter heals infected wound
War machines are coming
In the name of the cross
Forced to feel happiness
