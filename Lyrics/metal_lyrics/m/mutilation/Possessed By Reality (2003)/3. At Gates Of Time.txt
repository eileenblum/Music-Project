Mad wind brought sadness
When world shrank
Heartbeating - deep inside
And death came faster than I thought

Tired of day and night
Painful voice in my throat
How lonel man can be
With open wound in soul

To late to run out of the light
In brain doubted meaning of life
Too weak will be support
Too hard this land will be
The hand will be too short
To catch what's escaping from

So I'm saying: arise and got
I know, words will now follow
The questions without answers
One half human

Heaven for people
When waves rumble and sky tears apart
Second part of you is lying down there
What is your name,
Don't you ask me again
