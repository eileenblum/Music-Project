Look in my soul and read
Invisible thoughts
Dreams and fears
And don't tell me you see nothing
There I am all bleeding
With the problems of the human world
I am invisible because
I am different one
Different I am
Different again
I am victim again
I am different again

Into a distant darkness
You go without me
Wait a moment and cure my scars
I will give you a bloody reflection for luck
When you see the power in my eyes
My body will be
Turn by vultures again
And my soul will be last again
Look I'm a different one
I'm anger
