Expectation turn into the light
Expectation is my pain

And everything was clear
I would feel

During one night drank my fear
Fear which surrounds everything
Your thoughts and my fear
around us...

Do you feel this fear?
Where are you now
Don't you know who you are
Possessed by your own light
Yes, I feel, I feel what I could be
If I could forget about this fear

Possessed by reality
One fear - yes it's me, you know
You feel it every night
You feel it every day

And one pain
It's not the weakness
This is the reality - nothingness
And the only one pain
It's not the weakness
Space and fear
Your forbidden hands feel
