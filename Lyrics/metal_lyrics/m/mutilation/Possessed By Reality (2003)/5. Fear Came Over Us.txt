Our fear came over us
Impotence open fingers
Prisonres of their bodies
Clad into their flustrations

Spittings onto holiness
Demon will sorround us
Magie in their hallucinations
Heated in their fight

Wax pouring to ears
Bad strenghts will disturb sight
Soulesness of bodies feeding
Burned in their sun

Tired gods
Called unnecessairly
Individual without identity
Crowd pushed into incertainty

Dancing in madness
Time to sell mind to desires
Let our bodies will burn
to smoke reached the sky
