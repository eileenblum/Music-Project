Body for sale
Body without secrets
It felt down in precipice
Already sold for couple bucks

Love for sale
Like consumer goods
Every lascivious day
Puts newprice on it

Love from fairy tale
Temporary, shaky, unfair
Colored pills will spill
Washed down with cheap wine

Body for sale
With spat soul
No time for feelings
Between love deals

Don't rend your garments over
They are already rent
You've destroy you world
For not worthy moments
