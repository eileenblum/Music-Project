Alone you stand - the final parody
Destined to silence  - a memorial to mortality

Carved in stone - a tribute to the dead
For nameless victims - whose litany is undread

Never forgoten - wars memory lingers on
A dark reminder - to mankinds oblivion

This solemn image - constructed with resolution
A monument - to wars terminal conclusion

Cenotaph!!!
