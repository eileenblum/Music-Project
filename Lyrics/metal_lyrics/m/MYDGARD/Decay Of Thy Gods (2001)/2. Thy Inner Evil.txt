When you look yourself in a mirror
You can only see my rage in your eyes
You can only see fury and hate
Conquering thy soul and mind
As the night falling over the day
I fall over you as a hammer
Smashing thoughts and dreams
And controlling you as a puppet

I, the beast that never sleeps
The evil who rapes the whore
And creates the bastard Christ
Knows that the time to reign has come

I am the black blood of thy soul
And I will reborn the prince of Christians
To make him pay, to make him suffer
To occupy forever the throne
Of the true soul conquerors

I am the Satanism maker
The lord of the darkest side
The eternal nightmare on thy dreams
The sword that cuts you in two

And then prepare you all for the true suffering
Because the king of bastards is prepared
Prepared to show you all the power
And the rage of the eternal damnation
