Lost in the nature's heart
In a immense solitude
I feel how all respect has turn to covet
In a wrapping tranquility
I feel how all reverence has turn to scorn
All the wisdom of our ancestors
Covered with blood
Rotting his entrails 
Shattering her fragile equilibrium

Our arrogance will bring the dark days
Where the sky will turn black
And mountains red
Where the tempest will turn day to night
And the waves will bath the highest mountains
Where the ground break before our steps
And its fury will tumble down the clay Gods

Dark days will come
Where death will be spread through all the earth
Where death will take us back to nature's wisdom
