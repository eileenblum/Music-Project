I will forsake the earth covered with blood
Blood of the innocent spilled
By thy sick reason and thy unholy greed
Forsake the earth engulfed in the ice

I will forsake the earth full of crosses
Crosses where faith is praised
Crosses where martyrs lay crucified
Uselessly waiting arrival of paradise

I will follow the left hand path
The path that will show me the black light
The path where hypocrisy dies in my hands
The path where lies will be buried
Lies, to hide thy decay
Lies, to justify thy faith

I will follow the path that purifies my soul
That make that my dark desires become reality
And thy false doctrine remain burned
And thy false wisdom remain dethroned
