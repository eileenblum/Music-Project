Burning nails through my veins
Deadly flowers under my feet
Putrefied water cover my immortal body
While the pestilence of life starts to beat
The flames of hell burn my eyes
Blinding the way to the deadly sign
Making me prisoner of my own rage
Delaying the arrive to the finish line

Six demons calling
Six swords fighting
Six wolves crying
Mydgard is coming

The boat arrives at the lost land
Where children cry and mothers die
The land of dreams and satanic rites
Where trees don't hear God's lies

A whisper of doom rides the unholy night
Where darkness bathes the iced earth
Here the tears of trees find the death bed
To lay and forget, to sleep and hate
