I try to play with the fire in your entire heart
And all that I have is a lake of red lurid, so
My angry became empty in devastation
A thousand eyes can't make me see
All this reptiles covering my body

A cloud of flies don't brought me power
You stay in your black room (I hate)
Blind of me and unlit path (Your smile)
A sand fortress I build (I'm doomed)
Belial has betrayed me (I'm lost)

Dead animals and men's
Formed a pool of sickness
My reveries, my masks can't deceive
There was you, standing and untouchable
Even when I took your hope and the sun.

A cloud of flies don't brought me power
You stay in your black room (I hate)
Blind of me and unlit path (Your smile)
A sand fortress I build (I'm doomed)
Belial has betrayed me (I'm lost)

A cloud of flies don't brought me power
You stay in your black room (I hate)
Blind of me and unlit path (Your smile)
A sand fortress I build (I'm doomed)
Belial has betrayed me (I'm lost)
