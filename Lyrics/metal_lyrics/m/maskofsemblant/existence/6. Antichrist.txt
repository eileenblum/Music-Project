My curse is cast (My curse is cast)
Over the island of the man (Over the island of the man)
He lives his miserable life
Like nothing is more important

Heads up and smiling
Under a fake veil of liberty
Agrees to be deceived and controlled
To live his miserable life

I left some sweet words
They don't need influences anymore
I left some sweet words
No need to influences anymore (Anymore)

The will has already been vanquished
It's nothing more than an empty shell
The will has already been vanquished
It's only an empty shell

Your chance is over
Now just accept the unavoidable
Keep walking in circles
With a smile at your semblant

My curse is cast... (My curse is cast) My curse is cast
Under a fake veil of liberty
You will not be spared
Now just accept (ha ha) the unavoidable
Live your miserable life
Your miserable life
Your miserable life
