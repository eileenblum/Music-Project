Embrace your madness

Peace has never been so desired
Wars will come, they said
For hunters and prayers
A peace will come

Search in your mind

Ask for you dreams
Relieve your scars
Pray for your sanity, for your sanity

What I'll bring to your world
Seems like a handful peace
But when you wake up in the night
Your famine will be from soul

After a long way, I'll ask you
And if you are not prepared
You'll scream for pleasure

What I'll bring to your world
Seems like a handful peace
But when you wake up in the night
Your famine will be from soul
