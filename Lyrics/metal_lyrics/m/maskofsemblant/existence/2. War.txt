Is not wonderful?
That mess turning you blind
You hear the screams (Screams, screams)
Everyone is fighting
It's already at your veins
You can feel it, you can feel it
Don't lie to me, don't lie
I know you like it
To be above the corpses
Motherfucker

The wish to kill (Kill)
Your new best friend: death
That's your new life (Life)
Don't wanna die

The wish to kill (The wish to kill)
Your new best friend (Your new best friend)
That's your new life (That's your new life)
Don't wanna die

You heard the screams and
You're standing on your own
There is no God here to help you out
The blood stained and kill your hearts and souls
The urge to kill, 'cause this is war

You feel invincible
While you take their lives
And maybe you are (You are, you are)
Everyday you are fighting
And all the deeds are in vain
But don't regret it (No, don't regret it)
Today is your last day
But don't let it pass
So kill them all and
Welcome to the war!

You heard the screams and
You're standing on your own
There is no God here to help you out

The wish to kill (The wish to kill)
Your new best friend (Your new best friend)
That's your new life (That's your new life)
Don't wanna die

You heard the screams and
You're standing on your own
There is no God here to help you out
The blood stained and kill your hearts and souls
The urge to kill, 'cause this is war
