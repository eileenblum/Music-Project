In a shallow grave
I'd look to the stars
They are red as blood
That pulse in your heart
Gone and never returned

Ah, set me free
Ah, set me free

Deep in the scars
Profound in the flesh
A cut of a scythe

Ah, set me free

(Dark one rises and the pain will return,
The serpent comes alive to take all your hope
Time of end was come and the scythe will sing
The smell of burning flesh, and undead's scream)

I'm lost inside my mind and all I see is blood
Death awaits for me (Death awaits for me)
Everywhere I'd look (Everywhere I'd look)
So don't try to criticize, the way those things are
Death awaits for me, everywhere I'd look
I'm lost inside my mind and all I see is blood
Death awaits for me, everywhere I'd look

I'm engulfed in sorrow (Away with you bright)
I'd salved the weak (Death)
I'd pray for the dark ones (Suffering)
A false god belief

Ah, a false god belief
(Set me free)

I'm lost inside my mind and all I see is blood
Death awaits for me (Death awaits for me)
Everywhere I'd look (Everywhere I'd look)
So don't try to criticize, the way those things are
Death awaits for me, everywhere I'd look
I'm lost inside my mind and all I see is blood
