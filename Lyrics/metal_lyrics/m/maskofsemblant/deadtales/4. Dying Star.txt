I've never grasped the full impact
Those endless, dead days had on me
And now that all is said and done
One question still remains
Have I always
Been my worst enemy, my nemesis?

Close encounters of the dark kind
I thrust into the night
Combining praxis and entropy
The realms of suicide

All pain is washed away
By crack of dawn
My own sublime dismay
I must move on

Thundering war cries
Are heard across the heavens
Under a thousand, dying â stars
Farewell â Godspeed â Daylight
