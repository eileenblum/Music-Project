Not so long ago
These fields were bathed in youthful blood
Victims of a vicious crime

Beneath the green grass where you stand
Lies a rotten, red domain
Nourishing every tree and vine

A red domain
The earth has fed on their remains
Graveless children of the night

And when the rain
Falls upon this land
No one can ignore their cries

Ghostly voices creeping despair

When drops of blood
Begin to pour
From the tainted roof
We feel a chilling aura
On our knees we madly beg
For our lost souls to be spared
But the children have made up their minds

"Bleeding stars in the crimson sky
With cloud of stinking corpses laid to rest
All love's lost, hope is but a stillborn dream
The devil himself now cowers in face of our rage."
