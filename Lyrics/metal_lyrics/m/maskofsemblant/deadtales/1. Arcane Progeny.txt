Woven in her deepest memories
The eerie sight of burning effigies
Long gone

Sleeping through days and
Hurting through nights
She turns to the darkest corners of the mind
Dead inside

A long time before you finally realize
Taken away from the haven of a dream
Now two worlds collide
United as one, a mind-spirit synergy

Trembling hands - suddenly regain their strength
A body in communion with high progenies of the arcane

"The air is cold
And brutally still
The enlightenment of old
Bending to her will"

In front of the young woman
Cards move swiftly, shadows dance
She sees a bird of augury
And is woken from her trance
