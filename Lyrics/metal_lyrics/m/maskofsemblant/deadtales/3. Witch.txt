Running across the darkened woods of despair
I heard the caw of a crow
Its wings that once flapped so wildly
Hit the snow

The atmosphere was suddenly still
I saw a shadow standing on the hill.
In its laughter I could sense a thirst to kill

My senses started to fail
When she finally released the veil
The witch making me unable to inhale

Walking hand-in-hand with demise
She's showing my doom in her eyes
Alas! I'm surrounded by a cloud of flies

Serenely as a breeze,
The words she utters are these:
"Now you suffer, soon you'll be at ease".

Death has woken you to a new form of life
In a human mind

Now I cast down my own final sacrifice
In these blood-stained woods
No one but me survives
May you love, cry, and die in your future life

But you'll never fly
