Go, Damnation
Mark the land with an emblem of despair
Every empty well shall be a reminder
Of their impending doom
Now cleave the lamb.

Harvesting violence,
Mankind's paved a narrow road toward this gallows end.

Now I can see
As flame devours land
Crimson like the twilight
The downfall of man

Unholy war
Hear them roar
Hell is surely empty,
All the devils are here

We'll break the chain
Hence nothing but ruins shall remain
Welcome, Darkness
You are now their only guest, forever more

We'll break the seal
Lo, here comes cruel herald mounting his white steed
Behold!
