Racing along, I can't believe what I am witnessing
(I can't see it)(Don't believe it)
Now he's in full fight I see him surging into you
(Wait in silent)(with defence)

He's the spawn of all men's evil
How he envies those he sends to sleep
He's the spawn of all men's evil
He's carried burdens of guilt in the dead zone for you

Another victim bites the dust out hero hits the scene
(Evil hunter)(law enforcer)
Wiping away the fifth he cleanses every city street
(Vindicator)(terminator)

He's the spawn of all men's evil
How he envies those he sends to sleep
He's the spawn of all men's evil
He's carried burdens of guilt in the dead zone, he's coming

Dead zone - he's waiting for you
Dead zone - he's calling for you

He's the spawn of all men's evil
How who envies those he sends to sleep
He's the spawn of all men's evil
He is the sleepman with talons of steel he stalks all he's victim
at night in the dead zone for you
