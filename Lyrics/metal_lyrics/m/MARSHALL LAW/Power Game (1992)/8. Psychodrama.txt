Lying there just standing st the shadows on the wall
Johnny hears them fighting once again
His mothers, father screaming at each other all the time
Tears roll down his cheeks he understands

This young child will suffer in a cold and empty world
Cause no one takes the time to care enough to break his fall

He'll grown-up mean and fighting for attention that he craves
This restless-child who no one understand

Psychodrama, Psychodrama

Time goes by he's come to view the world with angry eyes
On his own he learn to stand his ground
Alcohol and drug abuse (now the boy's street wise)
He's fathers guiding hand cannot be found

This young man will suffer in a cold and empty world
Cause no one takes the time to care enough to break his fall
He's grown-up mean and fighting for attention that he craves
This broken man who no one understand

Psychodrama, Psychodrama

Anger and frustration tick away just like a bomb
Though out his teenage years he over loads
Emotion filling up with rage direction null and void
He rebels once more another wound is scores
