Cries hollow cries another nation dies
I feel the pain inside for the lonely and disposed
Their calling, their seeing their future turns to dust
Out leaders deceive us, you gotta have faith but who can you trust

Lies bitter lies, won't feed a hungry child
Their empty eyes cry out with suffering and denies
Their calling their seeing their future turns to dust
Their dying believers, gotta have faith but who can you trust

There's no justice
There's no justice
There's no justice
No justice at all
So who do you trust
