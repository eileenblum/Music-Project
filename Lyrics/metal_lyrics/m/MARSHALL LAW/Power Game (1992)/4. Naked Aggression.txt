Some say that love is war
Have I just struck a cord
Now there's a new problem to encounter
Peer pressures from out friends
It will lead to a bitter end
With defences down and broken

Saving face it's your innocence you lose
You've put your life on the line
Now your tortured and confused
The crying over you've lost the fight, so light the fuse

Unleash the dogs of war
Peel naked aggression
Calm before the storm
Peel naked aggression

You bare your body and soul
Left for dead out in the cold
That's the high price of desire
Were living in disturbing time
All around us are the warming signs
Are you to scared to trust your own mind
