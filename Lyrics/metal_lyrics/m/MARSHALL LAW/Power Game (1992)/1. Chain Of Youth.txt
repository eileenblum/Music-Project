Hey you, can't seem to find a way to get through
Wake up, your wasting time so get it into your head
Shake up, Get out, get into all those crazy things you've been dreaming about
Time out, so what's the point in all this lazing around

Your only cheating yourself, there's no one else you can blame
There's only only one way to get out

Fire up, get on your feet and walk outta here
Though up kick back, you need an attitude before you get burnt out

Where's all your craving for life, Seen you hanging down town
There's only one way to get out

Chain of youth - we'll break it
Pain of youth - don't take it

Wasted, can't find on answers from a needle boy
Too late, you lose, your numbers up on the wheel of life

Your only cheating yourself, so get out

Chain of youth - we'll break it
Pain of youth - don't take it
Chain of youth - we'll break it, it's just a fools game
Pain of youth - don't take it, it's just a fools game
