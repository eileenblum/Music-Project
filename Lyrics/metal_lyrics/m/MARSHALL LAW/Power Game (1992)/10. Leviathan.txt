Lord of torture, gods of sin
Offer ecstasy to fools who enter in
They rule the chambers of agony
Unholy masters who will never set you free

Another world is waiting
No time for hesitating
They'll tear your soul (apart)

Rise Leviathan
Rise Leviathan

In love with evil, in need of pain
What use are you to me my fantasies remain
Correct solution will summon forth
Hell creation then reveals its darkest force

All other hope forsaken
Now the vow is taken
They'll tear your soul (apart)

Rise Leviathan
Rise Leviathan

They have such sights
What's your pleasure

Rise Leviathan
