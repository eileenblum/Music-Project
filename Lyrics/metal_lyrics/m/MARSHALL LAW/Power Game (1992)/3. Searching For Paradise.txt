There are question in your mind
But the answers you can't find
New victims of hypocrisy
In this the heaven that you've found
There is laughter all around
Will there ever be a dying day

Who sees you light the candle
Who here's your prayers (is anyone out there)

No guiding light on end in sight
- Searching for paradise
Blind lead the blind, no truth to find
- Searching for paradise

Life's a circus your the clown
standing back while others drown
It's s sign of insecurity
Take a look inside your head
Quoting bullshit that you've read
It's a part of the insanity

Are you the one who'll save us
Give us sign(is anyone out there)
