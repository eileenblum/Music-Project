Talking the fight to the people who lead us
forcing the hand of political lies
Innocent victim seek solutions
In friendship they came to advise

They said our mission was to go and keep the peace
United Nations turn their back on our release

Delegates chosen to bring forward freedom
Pulling together torn family ties
Halting the mindless persecution
It leads to their own demise

This holy land is just a dark cloud of deceit
Religion manufactured suit their own beliefs

Freedom just a card to play in the Power Game

Who decides which move to make in the Power Game
