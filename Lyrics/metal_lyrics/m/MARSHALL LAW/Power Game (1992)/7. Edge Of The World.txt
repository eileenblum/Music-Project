A Master race driven on by greed
Their aim society on which they can feed
Amongst a blood lust causing hunger and pain
Ruled by regime with their rules inhumane

We must be strong enough to go all the way
Defend our rights whatever
We'll end this fascists rule
To take control of the fear their hiding

Standing on the edge of the world were calling
Can't ignore the plight the worlds pain
Standing on the edge of the world were calling
Can't ignore the plight the worlds pain

We'll make a stand take away their greed
A fight for all is what we need
To rid the world of their power mad games
Our nation cries vengeance will have its day
