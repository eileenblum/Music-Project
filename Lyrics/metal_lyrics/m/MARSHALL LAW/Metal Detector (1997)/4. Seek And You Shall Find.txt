You fail to see religiously and criticise security
Let them fall one and all

Seek and you shall find
apeace within the mind

Forever into destiny
The spark of life shines on in me
To see the light that shines on us all

Perchance on dreams in tragedy
To stop the fear that grows in me
Against them all, not one, but all

The sands of time fade out from me
Those sad eyes stare perpetually (back at me)
I can not change, watch me fall
