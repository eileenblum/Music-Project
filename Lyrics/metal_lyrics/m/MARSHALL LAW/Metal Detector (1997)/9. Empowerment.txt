It's time

I pray at the alter
I'm searching for answers
I Seek fulfilment.
I look to the cross there
Can you help me, now I ask you,
Can you rid me of the cross i bear

Moments feel like time has stood still in my contemplation
Reality crawls out from under, the store to plunder
Dark unearthly secrets from the past remain,
remain to haunt me, They aim to haunt me

In silence, I want,
It's silence I seek there,
In silence I find (there)

Growth in mind and body, I rest in time and space
I search for answers, I crave for knowledge
Holding on that's what we do here
Frozen are all the things that have gone wring
I seek forgiveness, I seek salvation

Empowerment
Empowerment
Empowerment (there)
Empowerment
