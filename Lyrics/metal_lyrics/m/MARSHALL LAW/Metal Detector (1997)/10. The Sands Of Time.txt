Centuries collide
Walls of light divide
Travelling through the astral plane
The vortex opens wide
Judgement day is here
You stare at me with fear
Sentence passed before the crime
Your end is drawing near

You'll never know
The reason why
No one will die for you

Sands of time

Judge and jury stand
Before you gun in hand
Evidenvr in future times convicted on demand
Violation is you to win
You shall be stopped before your reign of terror
Can begin

No execution star
No time for you to pray
Tomorrow's acts of violence will be paid for yesterday
The roles are now reversed
The tables have been turned
It's time to face your evil works and reap the face
You've earned
