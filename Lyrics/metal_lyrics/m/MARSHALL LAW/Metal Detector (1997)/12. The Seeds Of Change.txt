Cold are the times ahead
To me it's clear
There are many warning signs
As the hour draws near

Take a look at your inner self
Its what our future needs
To purify and cleanse our thoughts
Is that what invokes fear?

Emotions cast in stone
Another Jaded heart
Superstition's left its scars
Tears me apart

With all this bitterness and pain inside
How are you ever gonna realise
And if you ever do decide

The seeds of change (changing by myself)
I've seen the change
The seeds of change
I've - seen - the - change

With all this bitterness and pain inside
How are you ever gonna realise
And if you ever do decide
To grow and to sow
