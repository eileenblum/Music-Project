My mind is energy
A wealth of thoughts unique
You put me down you'll see
I'll Make life a misery

No I'm addicted to the pain
Peace all the effort's in vain

Confused and violent
It's you my main intent
Stand my ground you'll see
Cause you're no friend to me

This addiction your affliction
My Admission I'm addicted to pain

Hate comes early it's time to set mine free
Can't retrieve the target
Of abuse from me

Your death won't bother me
It could be ecstasy
Crushed your humility
Is your worst enemy
