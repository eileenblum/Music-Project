[Japanese bonus track]

Can you see the future
Tell me now, what is it like
You say you have the power
Humanity is on the line

[prechorus:]
When the shadows are longer
When the darkness falls
Then we'll rise like a phoenix
How can we survive?

[chorus:]
Storming to power
(With their fists and steel they'll tear us down)
Strike every hour
(This time it's for real, don't make a sound)

There's no voice of reason
Our nation is a firing line
Now our fears are growing
They can start this genocide

[prechorus - chorus]

Storming to power
Strike every hour
