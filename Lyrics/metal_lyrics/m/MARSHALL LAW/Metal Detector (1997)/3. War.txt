From the screen there's a chilling sound
I see your face as you hit the ground
Disturbing scenes that harrow me
I'm asking you to justify
Your policy of genocide
Would it change if the same were done to you
We must define diving lines, defy, until they stop
This stop this

Voyeuristic tendency
The media thrives on misery
In the end we are the ones who must decide
Totautarian Authority
Manipulation conquers apathy
weaterntoxification's you disease

War
Fight this war
War
Fight this war

Speaking the truthvis a dangerous game
Survey the scene from a higher plane
Subversive forces in control
A man of prace takes a hit blood to be shed
Don't fight the politics of death
