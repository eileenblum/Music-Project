From another world
Bringing fear, He has come
Is it the end for everyone
Now it's done

Feel the head, are you frightened?
Feel the pain, as it grows
Now the fight has started
Against the meganoid

Against the meganoid
meganoid
Against the meganoid
meganoid

Man has lost control
Now he's sold his soul, it's done
This is the end for everyone, now he's come
