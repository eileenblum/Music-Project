Descending the armies grow
Never relenting as they go
Legions gathered waiting for the cry
Dogs of war will intensify

All I see is the enemy
All I fear is the end for me

Invarsion to occupy
Say your prayers now testify
Fate has deemed this victory
Though destiny reveals defeat

The swarm

Defeated in the Leipzig war
Crushed were those within the swarm
thousands slaughtered human waste
endling the line of fate
