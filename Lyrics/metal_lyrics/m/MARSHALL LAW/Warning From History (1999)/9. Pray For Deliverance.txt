Stories untold let them unfold
Under the glory of the stars
Through heavens gate unlocked by fate
Forever concealed in the stars who you are
No existence (who you are)
No return (who you are)
No knowledge
Left to burn
Sinister minds controlling time
Seeking the answers to this life
Waiting for God becoming a God
Forever concealed in the stars who you are
No existence (who you are)
No return (who you are)
No knowledge
Left to burn
What can't you see what you want to see
Under the glory of the stars
History foretells no answers found
Forever concealed in the stars
No existence (who you are)
No return (who you are)
No knowledge
Left to burn
Now you'll pray for deliverance
You deny my existence
Now you'll pray for deliverance
You deny my existence
Now you'll pray for deliverance
You deny my existence
Now you'll pray for deliverance
You deny my existence
