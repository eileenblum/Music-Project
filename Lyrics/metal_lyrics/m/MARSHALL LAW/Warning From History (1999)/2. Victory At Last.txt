Dark clouds gather on the horizon
An empire is falling under siege
Blood lust disgust witness this slaughter
This fortress is crumbling in defeat
A lnf of destruction
Falls in the rage
Divisive leaders
Will they win in the end

Victory at last
Victory at last

Thousands battle for freedom
Oppressed systematically
Destruct resist deny all order
How the mighty have fallen in defeat

No resurrection
No signs remain
Fanatical leaders
Will win the end

Victory at last
Victory at last
