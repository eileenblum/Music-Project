I hear the waring there's nowhere to run
The sky is falling, falling where's the sun
This seismic slaughter destruction from the blast
I've seen the terror the terror from the past
I hear you calling there's mayhem all around I see you falling
Falling to the ground
Unseen assassins fire from the skies
I see the terror the terror in your eyes
Locked and loaded sights encoded
Empires falling new age dawning
Men kind of evil dictators will fall
Behind the mask the eagle shrouded from us all
Cold hearted killer stealing peoples minds
A meeting with our makers is the aim of mankind
I hear you calling there's mayhem all around I see you falling
Falling to the ground
Unseen assassins fire from the skies
I see the terror the terror in your eyes
Locked and loaded sights encoded
Empires falling new age dawning
