We are the victims of certain tragedy
Who has the knowledge the key
He's witnessed sights beyond all humanity
He Had the power to see
He sees the sign
The key to time
Only he can reveal
This noble seer
Predicted fear Apocalyptic nightmare
Harbinger of doom
It's the end for you
Harbinger of doom
It's the end for you
Harbinger of doom
Signalling the truth
Was this some kind of morbid fascination through the years
Confronting his own mortal fears
We seek the answers to these riddles still
We have to wait until
He sees the sign
The key to time
Only he can reveal
This noble seer
Predicted fear
Apocalyptic Nightmare
Harbinger of doom
It's the end for you
Harbinger of doom
Signalling the truth
What will be the consequences of this tragedy
Will an eclipse be the key
This Kingdom lives on borrowed time constantly
Only if we had the knowledge to see
He sees the sign
The key to time
Only he can reveal
This noble seer
Predicted fear
Apocalyptic nightmare
Harbinger of doom
It's the end for you
Harbinger of doom
Signalling the truth
