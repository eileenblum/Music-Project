Time stood still today
I know you're near
A hero of yesterday
I live in fear

Now all that has come to pass
Dreams all end in disaster
How will we ever see
What mystery uncovers
Remembered forever, dreams are for never
To know that you'll never run out of time
Why do you visit me?
It's you that I fear
I see yourself in me
Insanity's near
Of all the minds it's mine
Inside all I hear is laughter
How will I ever see
What history uncovers
Remembered forever, dreams are for never
To know that you'll never run out of time
Remembered forever
It all becomes clear
At night when you call to me
Insanity's fear
