How can I tell you
Why don't you hear
Now, it is your turn
You'll live in fear
I sign you name with blood on blood
I seal your fate you won't leave here
Footsteps of fear
You feel them crawling
The prey on your desire
I sign you name with blood on blood
I seal your fate
Hear the call for blood on blood
I seal your fate you won't leave here
Crime, blood on blood
Demise, blood on blood
Sin, blood on blood
suffer, blood on blood
We'll take your soul out
We'll drink your blood
Life's drained from you
A shell is no good here
I sign you name with blood on blood
I seal your fate
Hear the call for blood on blood
I seal your fate you won't leave here
Crime, blood on blood
Demise, blood on blood
Sin, blood on blood
suffer, blood on blood
