At night when I go to sleep
All around it's quiet here
I can't believe what I'm about to see
Can't take this pressure now
To many dreams how
What didn't I listen
Why didn't I care
Cause you were there to warn me
Now I believe again
Destiny send forth fate with dreams cast
Only time can dictate when we last
To become superior yet liked
Become almighty and treated as a God
Never be forgotten in this life
This is the truth
Screams of men in pain
Never again
Legends drawn by fate
To this land
This slaughter can be saves it's too late
To unlock the hidden meaning
And believe it to be true
Never to become immortal this is the truth
Screams of men in pain
Never again
Retreat never retreat never in your dreams
Retreat never retreat never in your dreams
Retreat never retreat never in your dreams
Retreat never retreat never in your dreams
Vision and oracles have cast
The truth has to be discovered
Fate before you the future and the past
The path the key to history
Conquer lands and then to reign
Never to be forgotten
Twenty Thousand miles of pain
The legend still remains
Screams of men in pain
Never again
Retreat never retreat never in your dreams
Retreat never retreat never in your dreams
Retreat never retreat never in your dreams
Retreat never retreat never in your dreams
