You deceives all out of greed
Nightmares you'll never see
The secret's out there for you
The prophecy is passed on
You must seek repentance
You're found guilty as charged
Crucified denier of life
Sacrificed denier of life
You schemed horrendously
Genocide cleansed ethnically
The sickness is out there waiting
The parchments written on
A promise that if you found it
You're found guilty as charged
Crucified denier of life
Sacrificed denier of life
Evil was fuelling your need
War crimes were your legacy
The secret's out there for you
You must seek repentance
You're found guilty as charged
Crucified denier of life
Sacrificed denier of life
