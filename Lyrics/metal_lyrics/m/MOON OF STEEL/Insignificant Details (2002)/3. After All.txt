Take my soul through my eyes
Here we stand in silver silence

Time flies
The autumn leaves fall in the sunlight
Like the days we've lost
Like the faces from your childhood
Not forgetting friends
But a veil covers my tired heart

Take my soul through my eyes
Here we stand in silver silence

Time flies
In the garden of my memories
And I will give my all
Even to those unworthy
I will open my doors of the past
And face my skeletons, forgive my enemies
Would you be able to do the same

Do not live in regret
Try to look on the bright side of life

The harsh truth hides the road
Dust to dust, but life goes on this way

It's hard to rise above,
Life your spirit to a brand new day

Time flies
Offering hope in a new way
Let's learn to cherish life
Tears of the past have not been wasted
And all the ups and downs
Have their place in the grand design
I'll take them as they come
