I will fly
I will soar the sky
I will blow through the leaves in the night

I will rise
I will touch the ground
I will feed this world
And be reborn

I will destroy
I will punish you
Erase the madness if you cause me harm

I am
Am the explanation
That for which you're searching
That which you can't measure
You haven't understood

Your ignorant presumption
Cause you to overlook just a few little
Insignificant details

It's time to release what's inside

I am
Am the explanation
That for which you're searching
That which you can't measure
You haven't understood

Don't be persuaded
And move yourself to see
Take notice of these
Insignificant details
