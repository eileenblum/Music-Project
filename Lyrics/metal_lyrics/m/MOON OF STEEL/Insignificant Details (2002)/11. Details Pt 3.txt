I hope you can hear me
And feel what I feel
I know it's hard to find your way

In this age where you win
Just if you cheat
And you're right to scream

These times in which 
We trade in people we love
For fixed stimuli

Life is not what you see every night on TV
And it's not what they have
Already prepared for you

Your life depends on that which 
You can seize
And your dreams are not
Insignificant details
