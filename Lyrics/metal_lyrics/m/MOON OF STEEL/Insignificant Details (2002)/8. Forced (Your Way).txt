Waiting in vain for things to come again
Listening to the desires
The sense they have to need

Here in my corner I succeed today
To look at myself, screaming "no way!"

If I could leave this road now
How would you stop me

Telling me you understand
But proving again your words have no meaning still

Here in my corner I look at myself, 
I am suffering, screaming "no way!"

If I could leave this road now
How would you stop me

When do my own thoughts come out and make me shine
Is this friendly, what I think
So when I feel are my feelings really mine
Or am I moulded into these

I've waited in vain for things to come no more
I don't ever want to carry an all-knowing grin

Here in my corner I refuse today
To become forced to live in your way

If I should leave this road now, don't try to stop me

When do my own thought come out and make me shine
Is this friendly, what I think
So when I feel are my feelings really mine
Or am I moulded into these
