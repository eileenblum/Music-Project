What I am
I would be if I could
I've a soul
Try to shout my own prayer

But I cry without a voice and tears
You can't choose what I'll be...
...I am

Who needs it, what is the use?
You win the prize paying with my life

What I am
I would be if I could
Studying me like a mouse, labyrinths
In which simple people get lost
I recall my own prayer

You cannot hear what I feel and what I am

Choose my fate like a colour TV
Choose for me how long my life will be
And destroy a created entity, 
It ends here, you forget the reason

You cannot hear what I feel and hear
Hear what I'm screaming,
It's already completed

I am - I want to leave this now
I am - not a shadow
I am - I want to feel the grace
I am - and what I want to be

What I have:
I feel the pain around me
And it's here
And the heart of the world
Beating pain
Laughing, crying its disgrace again
And we pray together

You cannot hear what I feel and hear
Hear what I'm screaming,
It's already completed

I am - I want to leave this now
I am - not a shadow
I am - I want to feel the grace
I am - and what I want to be
