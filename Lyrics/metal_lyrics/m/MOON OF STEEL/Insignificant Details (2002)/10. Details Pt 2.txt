Sitting talking about you
Amazing myself
Full of joy 
I smile, wondering
How did you end up with me
When I wasn't on the search

My old convictions though
Are old-fashioned pictures, you see
The truth is that
I have been away from myself
For such a long time

The tree roots staring at me
Through the cement

And you, moon, don't laugh at me now
You have always regulated and inspired me
You that know the essence of our true souls and minds
So which things can take you high

The tree roots staring at me
Through the cement

I can no longer ignore
The wall breaking down
The real sensations are being filtered
Like rays of the sun
I feel on my skin

How much pressure
How much untruth
How much loneliness
How much madness
Life is not possessions
And love is not pornography

Waiting for the moonlight shine

I've been waiting for a long time
I've been waiting for a sign to give me meaning to
I've been waiting
But the answer was within me
And it makes me fly so high

The world
Seen from here
Is harmony
Of which we are made
