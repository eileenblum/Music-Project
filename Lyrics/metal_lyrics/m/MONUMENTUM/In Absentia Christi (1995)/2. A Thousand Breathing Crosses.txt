En moi,battent de l'aile,Eternelles colombes,
Les blancs desirs du calme ou dorment les defunts.
[Paul Valery, from"Cimetiere" approx.1890]

[R.M.:guitar, bass, keys+M.C.:drums]

Tears of May...
how much I have cried for you, my love
but you stand-up,
while I fall on my knees...

Yesterday, I killed myself:
I couldn't just go on with this.
The tears of June at least
I won't cry anymore...

[Mia Martini]
