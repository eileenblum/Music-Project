I PROMISE
I Promise Sworn Enemy of the Virgin
Coming out of the Body of this Creature
to make her a SIGN on the Heart
of the length of a PIN
...and this sign WILL BLEED

And I promise that GRESIL and AMAND,
will do the Same
Their Hole in the Same Way

A Red Cross, and leaving on the HAND
the Holy name of MARY in Roman Characters
Engraved Deeply in the Flesh
and she became a completely Different WOMAN

And I promise that GRESIL and AMAND,
will do the Same
Their Hole in the Same Way

And she became a completely Different WOMAN
with a Face of UNCOMMON Beauty
and we went Together on a Pilgrimage

On her Grave, On her Grave, On her Grave
