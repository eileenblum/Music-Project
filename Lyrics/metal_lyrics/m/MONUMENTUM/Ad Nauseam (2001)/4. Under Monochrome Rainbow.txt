[Lyric: David Tonello]

SURROUNDED BY DIM LIGHTS I AM,
ALONE AND ISOLATED
AND NOBODY WOULD HELP

SOMEWHERE OVER THE RAINBOW,
THEY GRANTED A PLACE FOR ME.
BUT HERE, UNDER THE RAINBOW,
THEY STEP ON ME.

I WILL ALWAYS LIVE
DISTANT FROM YOUR BLIND ANGER
SCREAMING ETERNAL SILENCE
IN MY LITTLE WIDE SECRET GARDEN

I DECAY,
I DECAY,

AND YOU EVEN COMPLAIN ?
WITHOUT THE LEAST REGRET

A WALL SEPARATES YOUR ILLUSIONS
QUIETING YOUR STUPID LAUGHS

PROTECTED BY DESTINY AND WIND
SWEET ENEMIES OF MINE
FORGET ABOUT ME

I WILL ALWAYS LIVE
DISTANT FROM YOUR BLIND ANGER
SCREAMING ETERNAL SILENCE
IN MY LITTLE WIDE SECRET GARDEN

I DECAY,
I DECAY,
AND YOU EVEN COMPLAIN ?
