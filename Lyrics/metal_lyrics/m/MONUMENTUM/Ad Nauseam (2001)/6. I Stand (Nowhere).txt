[Lyric by Cornelius Brastad]

SAFETY NOT ME
TRUST IS A MUST
MASTER OF INTRIGUES
OUR WAYS PART HERE

STONE APPLES
BLAST THE FOREST
OF ICE THAT KEEPS
ME AWAY FROM

THE TRUE, THE BEAUTIFUL
AND THE GOOD
SLAVE OF REMOTE CONTROL
I STAND NOWHERE
BUT NOT ANYWHERE

HAVE FAITH IN ME
FRIENDS, BELIEVE
IN WHAT YOU DO
NOT KNOW

I THREW MY STONE APPLE
INTO THE ICE
THE FOREST OF ICE
SEPARATES MY REALM

OF THE TRUE, THE BEAUTIFUL
AND THE GOOD
MASTER OF REMOTE CONTROL
CAPTIVE OF INTIMACY

HAVE FAITH IN ME
FRIENDS, BELIEVE
IN WHAT YOU DO
NOT KNOW
