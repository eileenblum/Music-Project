[Lyric: Elisa Carrera/Roberto Mammarella]

AN EYELESS SKY
WHISPERS THE RAIN
DROPS FALL AND FALL
IN A SEA OF MUD

DERISORY SMILES
FOR THOSE WHO WASTE TIME,
HOT CURRENCY FOR THOSE
WHO DIED INSIDE

OPEN YOUR EYES
NO SCAR REMAINED
IT WAS ONLY A NEW
PAIN TO PAY

FEED YOURSELF
WITH MY SACRIFICE
KILL YOURSELF WITH
YOUR MORALITIES

(BUT) THERE ARE NO ANSWERS
FOR THE ARE NO QUESTIONS
THE ABYSS IS OPEN
OVER THE DOOR

(BUT) THERE ARE NO ANSWERS
FOR THE ARE NO QUESTIONS
I AIM FOR THE MARBLE
I MISSED THE LAST CALL FOR LIFE

SHINE YOUR LIGHT
OVER TO ME
HELP ME AND SEE THE
WAY TO THE SUN

THIS IS A LIFE
CONCEALED WITH CRIMES
I'LL SLEEP AWAKE AND
DROWN INTO SHAME

I TRUSTED YOUR GUIDE
BUT YOU ARE ALIVE
(WHILE) I AM CRAWLING
IN UNCLEAN FLOOD

ORDINARY LIFESTYLE
HAS NOW PASSED-BY
COOL WATER BLESS
THE FINAL MEDICINE

(BUT) THERE ARE NO ANSWERS
FOR THE ARE NO QUESTIONS
THE ABYSS IS OPEN
OVER THE DOOR

(BUT) THERE ARE NO ANSWERS
FOR THE ARE NO QUESTIONS
I AIM FOR THE MARBLE
I MISSED THE LAST CALL FOR LIFE
