What if I asked you to describe color?
Would you laugh, talk in riddles and sighs?
And if I asked you to define the future?
Would you tell me of human demise?

And we'll say
That it was meant to be this way

Though you may be gone
May your impressions linger on,
Even though the clouds are still grey,
Sun shines through with colored rays

And we'll say
That it was meant to be this way
And we'll see
Life as it was meant to be

A world looks into your eyes, become the star that shines,
As the moon lifts your heart, live savor before you depart
Let this be a sign
On the ever forked path, to forget and jettison all wrath.
To remember and again to be free, as we were all meant to be.

Perhaps you can't add color
To a world of black and white
Can't see through the darkness
But you can still take flight

A world looks into your eyes, become the star that shines,
As the moon lifts your heart, live savor before you depart
Let this be a sign
On the ever forked path, to forget and jettison all wrath.
To remember and again to be free, as we were all meant to be.
