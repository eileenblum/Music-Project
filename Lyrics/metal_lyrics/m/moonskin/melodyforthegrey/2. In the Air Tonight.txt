[originally by Phil Collins]I can feel it coming in the air tonight, Hold on
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, Hold on
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, Hold on, Hold on

Well, if you told me you were drowning
I would not lend a hand
I've seen your face before my friend
But I don't know if you know Who I AM
Well I was there and I saw what you did
I saw it with my own two eyes
So you can wipe off that grin
I know where you've been
It's All Been A Pack OF LIES

Well I can feel it coming in the air tonight, Hold on
Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, Hold on
I can feel it coming in the air tonight
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, Hold on, Hold on

Well I remember
I remember don't worry
How could I ever forget
It's the first time, the last time, we ever met
But I know the reason why you keep your silence up,
No you don't fool me
The hurt doesn't show
And the pain still grows
No stranger to you and me

I can feel it coming in the air tonight, Hold on
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, Hold on
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, Hold on
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, Hold on
Can You Feel It Coming In The Air Tonight?
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, Hold on
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, Hold on, Hold on, Hold on
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my lifeâ¦â¦.HOLD ON
