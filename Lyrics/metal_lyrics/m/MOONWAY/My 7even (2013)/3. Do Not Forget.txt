Staring in the sky, looking for my love, CAN IT
Take away the pain walking through this rain?..
Trying not to die, I became rough, SCREAMING
Just do not forget how to call my name.
Waiting for so long, bleeding in my heart, TAKE IT
Faith of mine is gone, it is cold as ice.
Screaming at the dawn, taring it apart, HATE IT
Now it's time to mourn, dying in your lies!..

Days are passing by, I have become romanticized,
And now I can't deny that my world has died...
Cannot live in fear standing by my side, CRYING
Just do not forget how to call my name.
Now you realise, that you just cannot WAKE ME UP
I am too cold, I was made to go...
Then I realised, that you just will not SAVE ME,
Fire in your eyes lied...

Shadows never cry
Untill there's a light!..

Now the door is closed, no way out from here, RAINING,
Just do not forget, just do not forget...
You have turned your back and my hope is now, FADING,
Just do not forget.
Staring in the sky, looking for my love, CAN IT
Take away the pain walking through this rain?..
Trying not to die, I became rough, SCREAMING
Don't forget to leave flowers on my grave...
