Wait for me, don't you go...
It's too late to see hatred inside me
Time stops and road ends,
Don't you cry, baby.
When the time stops, I'll close my eyes,
Smile and maybe then I'll go.
Make a wish, take my hand,
You will see hell inside me.
Time stops and all is gone,
Future's blind, it's fading...
When the time stops, I'll not look back,
Cry and maybe...

I'll will take everything from you
And I will leave everyone alone...

The time has past me silent,
You never knew it was too late,
Even though stars kept shining,
The world still seemd like fake...
And monotonic life is sensless,
Untill you find yourself...
When the time stops, I'll wash my hands
And I'll leave you!..

I'll will take everything from you
And I will leave everyone alone...
