Is the wonder so close?
Can we grab it and hold?
I'm so tired of all,
Holding my sensless breath
But I still know that nobody cares

While the world goes by you're breathing hard
Scared with your own dismay,
And your scream will tear the night,
Fore no longer you can stay.

Falling down from this suffering
We don't control our fate,
While we rise we fall again
Into the River of Hatered.

Is the wonder so close?
Can we grab it and hold?
I'm so tired of all,
Holding my sensless breath
But I still know that nobody cares...
