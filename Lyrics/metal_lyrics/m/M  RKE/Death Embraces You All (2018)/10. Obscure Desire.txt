May thou lay me deep into the ground
Hatred grows like weeds within you like a plague
Torture, sorrow, fear and regret
Force me into pain and distress

Enchantress you haunt me with your bloody tears
I'm yearning for you my darkest mistress of night
Seeing your tearful eyes and wine red hair, so fair
Reminds me how much I crave you,
My claws will grab you and make your skin bleed

Forever you'll yearn for me your darkest mistress
Your claws will grab me and make my skin forever bleed for you

May thou lay me deep into the ground
Hatred grows like weeds within you like a plague
Torture, sorrow, fear and regret
Force me into pain and distress

Driven to delusion, by yearning for thee
the torrid temptation drives so forceful in me
Possessed by your bloody kiss so poisonous
Seduced by your velvet touch so cold and graceful

Possessed by my deep bloody kiss so poisonous
Forever seduced by my velvet touch so cold and graceful

May thou lay me deep into the ground
Hatred grows like weeds within you like a plague
Torture, sorrow, fear and regret
Force me into a cave of distress and torment
