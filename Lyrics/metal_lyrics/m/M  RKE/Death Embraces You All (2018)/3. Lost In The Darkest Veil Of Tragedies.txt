With neither breath nor essence
She stumbled through the gaping gates
A passion of immortal tears
He feeds on her fears

Into dark velvet shadows
Her pale body is dancing to her faith
As fragile as a rose in the rain
It felt like centuries of pain

Slumbering into perpetual distress
Will the torment ever calm and go to rest?

Cold wind creeping upon
Her fragile body covered in dark velvet
Cold wind creeping upon
Her fragile body covered in dark velvet

Lost in the darkest veil of tragedies
The dreadful hours is near, my dear
Death will erase the mournful memories
In this dark life I will shed my last tear

Longing for her caress
I gaze her body veiled by blood
I didn't want to live in distress
So I dragged her cadaver through the mud

Drifting through decaying wormwood
With autumn leaves circle to the ground
This appalling life you never understood
Without you now I will forever drown

Slumbering into perpetual distress
Will the torment ever calm and go to rest?
