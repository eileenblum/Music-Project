Torment lies like a veil upon you
It spreads disease within you
The love you felt is not true
The peace will never pull though

Your strength is not existing
It's no point in resisting
I'll follow you like a plague
You'll never escape

Fear me
The tomb is waiting for thee
So cave in and follow me
The dreadful lies within me
You'll never escape

Moonlight
Shining over the deceased
All the pain that they released
When their last, cold breath was taken
They knew they were forsaken

Corpses frozen to the grown
A mournful screaming cold sound
It was their dismal faith
They could never escape

Fear me
The tomb is waiting for thee
So cave in and follow me
The dreadful lies within me
You'll never escape

Lay down on you knees
And accept you destiny
Then your pain will release
