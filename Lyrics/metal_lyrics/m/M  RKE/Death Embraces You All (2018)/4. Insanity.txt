Burdens of grief and deception
Has taken my sanity
Nightmares repeating in my mind
Haunting me

Trapped in an era of despair
Where fear has taken my soul
This curse will never repeal,
I want to let go

They will come for you
I know this nightmare will come true
They will come for you
Tonight the darkness will break through

Slowly the darkness approaches
My will is fading away
This life has nothing more for me
I am decay

The moon is rising before me
In my eyes you see the fear
Clinging on a fading hope,
But the dark is near

They will come for you
I know this nightmare will come true
They will come for you
Tonight the darkness will come
For you

I need to end this to be free
I lost myself to insanity
They will come for me
I need to end this to be free

They will come for me
I lost myself to insanity
