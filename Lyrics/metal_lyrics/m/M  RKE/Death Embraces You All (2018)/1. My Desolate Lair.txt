Me har alle et mÃ¸rke inni oss,
Som aldri komme te Ã¥ bli avdekka

Ta meg med, Mektige kulde
Te mitt Ã¸de rike kor eg skal fortella min historie,
Om mitt troskap og min usÃ¸mmelighet

Deathly shadows
Conquering my life with wicked temptation
Of the moonlight whispers
That is chanting so softly of your sins
Tempting eyes lured me to your lair

Veiled by lust and viscous desires
Unhallowed by my tormented name
That is echoing through ancient dusty halls
Like a warning of autumn with never ending rain

Carry thee away like autumn leavesâ¦
To my desolate lair...

Surrounded by
Hollow whispers in the night
Poisoned wine fills my pulsing veins
Oh dearest enchantress of the night
Take me with thee like the autumn leaves

Veiled by lust and viscous desires
Unhallowed by my tormented name
That is echoing through ancient dusty halls
Like a warning of autumn with never ending rain

Follow the whispers of autumn leaves
