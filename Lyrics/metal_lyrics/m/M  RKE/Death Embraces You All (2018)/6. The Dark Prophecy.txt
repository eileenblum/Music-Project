In a velvet night
Where the moon shines bright
She comes through darkened veils
Her gown flowing slowly
Over weeds, so ghostly
With the loss in her life engraved

In the crystal frost
Mourning for her loss
That was buried so deep inside
I could not be saved
With my mind enslaved
Of her haunted moonlight gaze

Tragedy slowly
Creeping in to the night
Screams from unholy
Forlorn graves in moonlight
Haunted by darkest
Memories of the lost
Whispering like a ghost of a Helleborus

Tragedy has fallen once again
Will I live with this pain?
Hearing dreadful whispers in the night
Growing a hatred of light

Tragedy slowly
Creeping in to the night
Screams from unholy
Forlorn graves in moonlight
Haunted by darkest
Memories of the lost
Whispering like a ghost of a Helleborus

Like a rose in a fight with the rain
Surrender yourself to me
Drowning in to the pernicious pain
Surrender yourself to me
