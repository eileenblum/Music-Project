He insisted I follow him
Into the darkest night while
The fog lies like a soft veil
I approach death, it comesâ¦slowly
I approach darkness veiled by hollow whispers

Follow me
I am yearning for thee
Our bodies connected
Let our nocturnal souls unite
Her mystic eyes
Chilling

Like the dew on spiderwebs in dawn
Her skin, so pale
Stands in relief against the dark night
With the wind in her wine red hair
She commands in silence

I remember the night you pressed your lips against my pale neck,
I caved in without a struggle
I submit to thee my, dark lord
I submit, lost in your ghostly mystery

Follow me
I am yearning for thee
Our bodies connected
Let our nocturnal souls unite
Mystic eyes

Chilling
Like dew on spiderwebs in dawn
Her skin, so pale
Stands in relief against the dark night
With the wind in her wine red hair
She commands in silence

Forever bound
Together in the ground
Forever there will be a rose on our grave
