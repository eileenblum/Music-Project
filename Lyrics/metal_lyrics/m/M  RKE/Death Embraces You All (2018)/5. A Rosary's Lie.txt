Flames went high
In the sky
Purifying her soul from her sins
Evil eyes
From the crowd
Staring, shouting

Corrupt lies
In disguise
Forcing the word of god on mankind
Take this pledge
Save your soul
Or you will die

Screaming voices in the night
Is this your gods view on grace?
Glimpse of burning corpses in twilight

Burning people in gods name
For refusing his vile hymns
Drowning sons and daughters in cold blood

Is this dark
Ritual
The holy words of your hallowed god?
Thousands of
Dreadful years of execution

I will not
Bend to your
Manipulative, disgusting cross
Save your grace
I will not
Ever obey

Screaming voices in the night
Is this your gods view on grace?
Glimpse of burning corpses in twilight

Burning people in gods name
For refusing his vile hymns
Drowning sons and daughters in cold blood

I will not obey
I will rather die
I will not obey
Just let me die
