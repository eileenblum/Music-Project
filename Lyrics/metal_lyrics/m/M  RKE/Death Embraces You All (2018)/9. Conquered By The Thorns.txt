Hatred grows in me like sharp thorns
That stabs into frightened eyes
Water from mountains runs as cold as
A lost widows mournful tears

Dark desires occurs in the twisted mind of mankind
Forever will thorns be stronger than the pedals on the rose
They will fall, into mournful everlasting decay
Darkness comes and will be shut in their frozen graves

Dreadful dilutions will never leave me alone
Like a anathema craved by Apollyon in stone

Screaming in the cryptic darkest gale,
"Is this life only torment and pain?"
The paralyzing voices above
Whispered back, "Only torment and pain."

Dark desires occurs in the twisted mind of mankind
Forever will thorns be stronger than the pedals on the rose
They will fall, into mournful everlasting decay
Darkness comes and will be shut in their frozen graves

Dreadful dilutions will never leave me alone
Like a anathema craved by Apollyon in stone
