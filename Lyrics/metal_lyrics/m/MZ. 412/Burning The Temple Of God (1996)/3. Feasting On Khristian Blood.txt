Dethrone the krucified one!
Enki be proud!
We kurse our enemies with your wrath
Their blood we spill on the altar,
their ikons we krush
We will rise to face the new dawn
Feast on Khristian blood
Feast on Khristian blood
Summon the forces of evil
Spit in the face of God
Rise to face the new dawn
Satan will fight on our side
Holy war against the filthy Kristians
No more shall they disturb the work of Satan
Hordes from hell shall rain down
and spill their dirty blood
To kill is to live - Kill the holy man
Feast on Khristian blood
Feast on Khristian blood
