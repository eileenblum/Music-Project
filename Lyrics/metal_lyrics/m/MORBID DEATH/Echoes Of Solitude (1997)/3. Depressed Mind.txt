Always the doors in your mind
imaginary forms of life
showing the holy one
twisted versions of reality

Confused - I know that I am
disappointed with the man!
confused - I know that I am
disappointed with the man!

Will they put a mask?
I feel hate, I feel depressed
pushing into the deepest agony
I feel hate inside me
