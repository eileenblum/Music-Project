Coming from every part
called by their dictators
To defend with the heart
transforming us in predators

Then comes the time
that the slaughter begins
covered with dirt and blood
no time to confess our sins

Unequal rights
they start up the fight
obeying our leader
the anger grows bigger
in what kind of society do we live in?
in a society of greed..
..cruel hate..
..no faith

Unequal rights
their must be a logical explanation
of all this killing
this is our situation
of all this killing
