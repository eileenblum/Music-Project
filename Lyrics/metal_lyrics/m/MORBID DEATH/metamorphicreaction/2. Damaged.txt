Damages were done
I got to run
Shadows everywhere
So much pain, so much fun

Run, run for your life
DonÂ´t look back, don't cry
Awful thoughts only dominate you
Sweet whispers isolate me

You and I...

In this life of obscurity
Some minutes took part of us
How can I define simplicity
If I lack knowledge of purity?

Dangerously, I reach for the answers
I haunt my mind and yours
And mix love, hate, good and evil
In a broken dark jar
In a broken dark jar
In a broken dark jar
In a broken dark jar

Run, run for your life
DonÂ´t look back, don't cry
Awful thoughts only dominate you
Sweet whispers isolate me

Cocktail of power
Compassion and control
Atomic bomb of desire and impulsivity

Run, run for your life
DonÂ´t look back, don't cry
Awful thoughts only dominate you
Sweet whispers isolate me

And the light always tells me
Welcome back my son
Now run, run, run
Damage is done

Conquer the world and have fun...
