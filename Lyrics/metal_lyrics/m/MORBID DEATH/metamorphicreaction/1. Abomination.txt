You are abomination to all
A weak force of symbolization
A fragile dream without formation
You are abomination to us

I've seen your dark wings on my chest
Robbing my veins and feeling cold
I've seen your dark wings on my chest
Cutting my peace and my sanity

You are abomination to all
Psychopathic force of depression
Monster of suicide ideation
You are abomination to all

Listen to me abomination to all
You may be the boss of many without a soul
Bully of cowards and losers without a call

But I am the one who will cut your wings from my chest
I am the one who will eat your heart with no remorse
I am the one who will fake your death and burn the corpse

I am the one who will cut your wings from my chest
I am the one who will eat your heart with no remorse
I am the one who will fake your death and burn the corpse

I will kill you
Kill you...

I've seen your dark wings on my chest
Robbing my veins and feeling cold
I've seen your dark wings on my chest
You are abomination to all
You are abomination to us
