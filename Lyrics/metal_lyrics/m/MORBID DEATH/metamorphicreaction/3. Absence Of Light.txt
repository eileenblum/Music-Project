The beast and the lamb
That haunts my life
Unifies dark and light
Into different forces!

Same sword!
Same destiny!
Same Hell or Heaven!
Inside of you!
Inside of me!
Inside of you!
Inside of me!
Inside of you!

As you see, I'll go forward
With my miserable life
Passing by dark alleys
And savvy feelings of betrayal!

Todayâ¦ I'll mix the edges
Of misery, fear and hope!
I will create an unique strength
One that avoids the Absence of Light!

I will suffocate my fear and dark desire!
And the lamb will not disappear
When the beast surface and damage all!

I will conquer the light at the edge of me!
And you are welcome to stay

Todayâ¦ I'll mix the edges
Of misery, fear and hope!
I will create an unique strength
One that avoids the Absence of Light...Absence of Light!

The beast and the lamb
That haunts my life
Unifies dark and light
Into different forces!

Same sword!
Same destiny!
Same Hell or Heaven!
Inside of you!
Inside of me!
You are welcome
You are welcome
You are welcome
Absence of Light!
