I seek people with eyes
That may provide great peace!
I'm fed up with daily hateâ¦
That surrounds us everyday

A simple gesture, a simple touch
May turn evil into a petal
But, there is a long way
To achieve serenity
All say!

You and me
Are meant to be
One of a Kind

You and me
Are meant to be
One of a Kind

A simple gesture, a simple touch
May turn evil into a petal
But, there is a long way
To achieve serenity
All say!

Sad memories are vanishing
Colorful pains inside of me!
I hope that same will happen
To those who seek for peace like you...

...and me
are meant to be
one of a kind
