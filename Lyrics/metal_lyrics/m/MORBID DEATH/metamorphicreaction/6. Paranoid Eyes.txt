Fatherâ¦
I looked at your eyes for so many years.
Innocent avenues of pain and despair
Lost metaphors of sun and rain
Father...
I looked at your eyes and fear to see mine

I see the future in a broken crystal ball!
I hear me laughing out of control
Holding your suffocating paranoid brown eyes
And the moments that I am no more!

But then I say: âEverything will be fine!â
Today I claimed to be less than what I am
And found myself at the dark stage, in a crying game
Blaming the feelings that do not show

Paranoid Eyes
Paranoid Brown Eyes
Paranoid Eyes
Paranoid Brown Eyes
Paranoid Eyes

The Sky
The Ground
The Love
The Hate
The Dreams of no one
...of no one

I'm tired of watching these eyes
In the same mirror
Father, I looked at your eyes
And fear to see mine

Do not fear Death
I'll take you home

Paranoid Eyes

I see the future in a broken crystal ball!
My lips are purple
My veins have no place
Memories are fragile
I called the Lord...
I called the Lord...
I called the Lord...
I called the Lord...
