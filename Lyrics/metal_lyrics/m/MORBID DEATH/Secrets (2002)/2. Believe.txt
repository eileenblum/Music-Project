[music by Morbid Death]
[lyric by Rui Lima]

Kill the beast inside
Jump away and die
Eternity is alive
And it was just a kiss of the wind

What am I and how am I?
There`s to much sea to jump
My wings are weak
And I have a long fligth

Believe, Believe
Mother God
Believe, believe
Mother

There is nothing to drink
Or nothing to die
The walls are dark
There is no door
Windows of hell
Windows of poor!

Tell me Mother where to try
A glass of poison or a glass of wine
There is nowhere, where I am
Or solutions for what we are

Here and there is the same
Dead lions
Forests of rebellions
Phrases of war
One government... One world!

Mother, are you still there
Here everything feels the same
I keep trying to kill the beast
And gain courage to jump away
