[music by Morbid Death]
[lyric by Rui Lima]

I have been alone all my life
Streets full of people
Kisses of the wind
Hands of pity
Silences of the mind

Birds in my jail
Lions on the rum
Cages of ill
There is no sun
And I am alone
Streets full of people

What is my life

A wall of pain
A deck of blood
A fading sin
An uncertain mood
There is no one
There is none

An apple falling
No way of catching
And I am alone
Streets full of people

Where am I?
A place to stay or a place to die
There is no freedom
There is no room
A dark sky
A sin of mine
Streets full of nothing
I`m ready to go
I`m ready to die
I`m ready to go
And I am alone
