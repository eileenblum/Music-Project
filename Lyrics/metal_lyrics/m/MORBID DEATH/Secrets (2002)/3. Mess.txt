[music by Morbid Death]
[lyric by Ricardo Santos]

I get confused - organize your self!
I get confused - realize your dreams!
I get amused - try to understand me!

The meaning of life
Is what I`m looking for
Birth of an idea
I just want more 

I get confused - organize your self!
I get confused - realize your dreams!
I get amused - try to understand me!

Don`t know reality itself
Simply reality how it is
The power of knowing
Will be reduced to all objects of experience
The power of knowing
Will be reduced...
