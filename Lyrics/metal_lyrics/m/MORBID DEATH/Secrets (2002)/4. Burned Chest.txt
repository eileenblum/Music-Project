[music by Morbid Death]
[lyric by Ricardo Santos]

I feel my eyes hot
My head is burning
I feel my eyes hot
My blood continues running

Strange and unknown felling
Odd visions... images
Journeys into inner self

Where am I roaming?

I still feel that fire
Burning in my chest
My old and awful scars
In contrast with a bird in its nest

Time passes, as the wind blows my life book
Pages of guilt, anger and tragedy
Summer`s sand blow into my hot eyes
I really don`t know my state of reality
I really don`t know my state of reality

The strength of awful visions
Invading my conscious
The fire conquests
My supposed future promises
