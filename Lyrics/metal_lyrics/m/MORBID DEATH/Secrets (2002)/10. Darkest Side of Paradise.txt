[music by Morbid Death]
[lyric by VerÃ­ssimo Pereira]

Master - excuse me, but I`m weak
Master - excuse me for my sins
Master - your blood I will drink
Master - can`t you see I`m suffering

To take a human life
It requires a sacrifice
God sacrificed himself for us
And he died on a cross

Where is paradise?
Humanity is killing the future
Where is paradise?
We`ll be lucky if we survive

Master - excuse me, but I`m weak
Master - excuse me for my sins
Master - your blood I will drink
Master - can`t you see I`m suffering

This world is dying
No hope we`re offering
To the next generation
That to survive it`s a complication
In this world of temptations
