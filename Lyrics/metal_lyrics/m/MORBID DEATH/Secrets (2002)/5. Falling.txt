[music by Morbid Death]
[lyric by Ricardo Santos]

Keep your face down
Things are going to fall
Even your crown
Smashed against a wall

They way you are
They way you talk
You think you have
Everyone under your feet

I wish, I`ll never be like you
I try not being like you
I`ll ear your screams
I`ll see your dreams
Going opposite ways

I`ll see you crawl
I`ll assist you fall
I just want you down
You won`t wear no more crown!
