[music by Morbid Death]
[lyric by Ricardo Santos]

Walking on the wild side
With my eyes unfold
Very close to the edge
My legs shake constantly

The better thing that I`ll do
Is go straight ahead
Face with no fear
To all that could appear

I`ll choose the way
It`s my decision
I want to choose the best
So I can`t be an illusion

My life, my pain
I have to support it
My life, my gain
I have to deserve it

Keep on going
Trust in what you believe
Don`t let the others 
laugh in your face
I have to be strong and not weak

My life, my pain
I have to support it
My life, my gain
I have to deserve it
My life, its my life
