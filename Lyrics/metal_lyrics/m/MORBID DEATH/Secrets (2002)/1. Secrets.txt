[music by Morbid Death]
[lyric by Ricardo Santos]

Come close to me
Look into my eyes
And what can you see?

Take my hand
And come with me
I`ll show you things
That you never seen

Outstanding promises
Wrong talks
Corrosive philosophies
Just sustain your breath
And come with me

Secrets - I cannot hold them
Oh! Secrets - I can not hide them
I only want to say
And show what`s right or wrong
Oh! Secrets...

I can not accept total ignorance
Open your mind, you have to know it
Try to assimilate all knowledge
And I will always guide your way.
