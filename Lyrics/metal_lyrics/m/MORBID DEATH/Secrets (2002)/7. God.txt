[music by Morbid Death]
[lyric by Ricardo Santos]

God don`t let the sun blind our kids,
Hide them under trees of hope.

God don`t let the sea drown our children,
Keep them in the highest mountain of
Hope.

God don`t let the fire burn our babies,
Save them same hope.

Don`t let the devil be once more,
Mixed with the purity of a whore!

God! If you are still there, come to us.

The world is in pain!
The world is sin!

And we are tired of waiting,
Under the fig tree.
