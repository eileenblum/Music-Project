All you did was end me, yet you expect me to kiss your feet?
Maybe it's better to stay ostracized as you're left to die.
For I am everything; I am your brown eyes.
For I am not naive, consent me.
I'm the facade of your flawless epoch.
Existentially, I will transcend from whom I long to be.
I am the ubermensch, you are the nihilist.
We'll write a symphony.
Hand in hand, we'll take love down.
