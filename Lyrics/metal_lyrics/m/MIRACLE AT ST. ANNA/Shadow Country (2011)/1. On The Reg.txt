We come from all over different places, walking side by side
Carrying the weight of the world on our backs
We can't even stand on our own two feet
We're walking around in broken glasses
It never ends
On jagged paths we crawl, desperation calls our name
As these branches speak in tongues, my soul is finally fucking saved
I can't speak with eyes sewn shut
I keep falling as I try not to walk away
I am predestined to pave my own road, I refuse to burn
All I ever wanted was to walk straight lines
But you insisted I walk blindfolded
It never ends
