You get what you give. The golden rule, that's life. If you stab me in the back, I'll use that very same knife. Treat me like a man, a human being. You'll get the same in return. Try to set me afire, I'll make sure you live to see me burn. Gross Misconduct that's our golden rule. Gross Misconduct on you. Gross Misconduct every rule I break. Gross Misconduct my rules I'll make. Things in your future reflect from things in the past. You were there to kick me down. Now I'm gonna kick you in the ass. What goes around comes around. A vicious circle so it seems. You heard me sing sweet pain before. Now it's your turn to sing. Gross Misconduct that's our golden rule. Gross Misconduct on you. Gross Misconduct every rule I break. Gross Misconduct my rules I'll make. That's life to each his own. You play a game but we're all full grown. Breaks loose. Gross Misconduct that's our golden rule. Gross Misconduct on you. Gross Misconduct every rule I break. Gross Misconduct my rules I'll make. My rules I'll make.
