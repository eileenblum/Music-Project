Come as you are. What's the point of blending in. Don't look at me, Mr. Wanna Be. You can't even fill your own shoes. Come as you are. You'll be the one to rise above. Being fake is being dead. Change your face, then change your head. Me. You. You. Me. That's the way it's gotta be. Come as you are. Take my advive, leave that crowd behind. Nothing to lose, everything to gain. So listen before you turn away. Come as you are. Reclaim your identity. Before its lead astray. See it all for what it is. Me. You. You. Me. That's the way it's gotta be. Me. You. All. Come as you are! What's the point of blending in. Being fake is being dead. Nothing to lose, everything to gain. See it all for what it is. Me. You. You. Me. That's the way it's gotta be!
