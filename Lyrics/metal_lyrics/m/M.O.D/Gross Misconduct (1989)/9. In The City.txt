[originally by Fear]I love living in the city
I love living in the city

My house smells just like the zoo 
It's chock full of shit and puke 
Cockroaches on the walls 
Grass growing on my balls 
Oh but I'm so clean cut 
And I just want to fuck some slut 

I love living in the city 
I love living in the city, yes I do 

Spent my whole life in the city 
Where junk is king and the air smells shitty 
People puking everywhere 
Piles of blood, scabs and hair 
Bodies wasted and their beat 
People dying on the street 
But the suburban scumbags they don't care 
Just get fat and Dye their hair 

I love living in the city 
I love living in the city
