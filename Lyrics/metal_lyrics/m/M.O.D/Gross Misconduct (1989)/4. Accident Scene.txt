We're going out tonight, to watch some people die. We'll watch the parents cry at the accident scene. Cars will crash tonight. Bodies hurled in flight. We're laughing in delight at the accident scene. You know the end is near, so drink another beer. And anticipate their fear at the accident scene. Body organs burst, splattered on the earth. Flat now is your girth at the accident scene. Should have worn your seat belt. You choose your time to die. So now they take your body to the city morgue. Imbalming fluid floods your brain - no way. A car is just the same as a gun, use it wrong you'll kill someone. Learn from. We're laughing at the accident scene. (Repeat).
