Here comes Godzula to stomp on Tokyo. Awakened, nuclear test, he rises, sub-zero. His roar fills you with terror. The very earth he'll break. Man has screwed up once again and God has sealed our fate. GODZULA. GODZULA. Buildings crumble, the power lines are down. Call out the army, they're the hunters now. They try to melt him down with 60 million volts. their efforts are in  vein, God's will he must invoke. GODZULA. GODZULA.
