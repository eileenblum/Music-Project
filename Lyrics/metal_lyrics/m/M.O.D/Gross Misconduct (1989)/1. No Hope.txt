Down and out, no place to go. Nothing to give, not a thing to show. Why don't you get up off your lazy ass. Before you let your whole life pass. No one will believe in a thing you do. Why should they, you give 'em no reason to. All you ever did was kid around. Opened your mouth and talked real loud. No Hope - Earning your self respect. No Hope - Is there anything you don't regret? No Hope - Feeling sorry for yourself. No Hope - How many tomorrows do you think are left on the shelf. You think that life should be so grand. That someone else will put it in your hand. But nothing in life is for free. We take up space 'n pay a fee. Never forget the hardened fight. You better hang on with all your might. 'Cause if you beg, steal, lie or borrow. It's here today and gone tomorrow. No Hope - Earning your self respect. No Hope - Is there anything you don't regret? No Hope - Feeling sorry for yourself. No Hope - How many tomorrows do you think are left on the shelf. Trying to keep up with the rat race. Run around at a frantic pace. Have a goal, set in your sight. In the end you'll see the light. You'll see the light.
