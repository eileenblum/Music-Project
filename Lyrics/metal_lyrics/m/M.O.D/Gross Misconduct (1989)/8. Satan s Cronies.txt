Want to tell you about a guy I know. He's got two horns, red eyes that glow. Hallowed be the body without a soul. The weak of mind follow. Lucifer likes to party down. In the depths of hell is where he's bound. Singing a song with a hellish sound. Drinking blood from an open crown... singing: We are satan's cronies, the devil is our friend. It will be the devil that betrays us in the end. We are satan's cronies, the devil is our friend. It will be the devil that betrays us in the end. His mind is full of lies and treachery. Says he knows what you want to be. Slowly sucked in, no longer free. Molded by his hand a slave to be. Sure satan likes to party down. So do I, but not with him around. You'll see him, shit your pants and then leave town. He'll buy your soul then watch you drown... singing: We are satan's cronies, the devil is our friend. It will be the devil that betrays us in the end. We are satan's cronies, the devil is our friend. It will be the devil that betrays us in the end. So here's a little rap. Those of you who believe in the devil and think it's cool. Youz be steaming and burning like human stew. Welcome to Satan's barbecue. Want to tell you about a guy I know. He's got two horns, red eyes that glow. Hallowed be the body without a soul. The weak of mind follow. Lucifer likes to party down. In the depths of hell is where he's bound. Singing a song with a hellish sound. Drinking blood from an open crown... singing: We are satan's cronies, the devil is our friend. It will be the devil that betrays us in the end. We are satan's cronies, the devil is our friend. It will be the devil that betrays us in the end. We are satan's cronies, the devil is our friend. It will be the devil that betrays us in the end. We are satan's cronies, the devil is our friend. It will be the devil that betrays us in the end.
