Soggies suck

I was sitting up at night
I was feeling so uptight
I was just fucking around
There was something dragging me down

Thinking of a bite to eat
Thought this would be really neat
Cheerios are stale that's beat
But Captain Crunch is fun to eat

Captain Crunch, Captan Crunch
He's inviting you to munch
Captain Crunch, Captain Crunch
Munch a bunch a munch a munch

Fuck my brain

Scoffing down this yellow wheat
Is making me feel kind of beat
My head is spinning round and round
Now my teeth are turning brown

My face is starting to come apart
From this overdose of starch
I really wish mom wasn't here
I'll have another box of beer

Captain Crunch, Captain Crunch
He's inviting you to munch
Captain Crunch, Captain Crunch
Munch a bunch a munch a munch
