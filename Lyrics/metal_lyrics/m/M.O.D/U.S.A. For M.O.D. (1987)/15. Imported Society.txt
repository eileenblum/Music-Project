They came from the other side
In bunches at a time
Crowding up the neighborhood
To raise the rates of crime

Some of them got money
Most of them got shit
All they do is come here
To take from our pockets

Import, import, imported society
Import, import, imported society
Import, import, imported society
Import, import, imported society

Don't you fucking see
That you bother me
Genocide
You can't hide

So go home now
Don't come back
Take your goat
Get on your boat
I hate imports
I don't want to hear their shit
I hate imports
Cause I'm just so sick of it

I just want to
Live my life without you fucking assholes
And I want to
Never see your ass again

Import, import, imported society
Import, import, imported society
Import, import, imported society
Import, import, imported society

Hindus and Ethiopians
You know they're all the same
A huck a buck of Indians
They're all so fucking lame
