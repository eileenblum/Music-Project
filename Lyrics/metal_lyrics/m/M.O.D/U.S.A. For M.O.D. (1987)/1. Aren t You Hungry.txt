Sitting in my kitchen
Stuffed from having ate
What should I do now
With what's left on my plate

Maybe I should save it
But naw I got the cash
Think I'll take the easy way
And throw it in the trash

U.S.A. for Africa
What a fucking scam
Charity begins at home
What about our land
America has it's own problems
That's what should come first
So fuck those nigger's charity
And let them die of thirst

Aren't you hungry
Aren't you hungry

U.S.A. for U.S.A.
That's what I'd like to see
But sympathetic assholes
Send it all to their own countries
They want the food to grow
On what they call home land
But don't you know
You can't grow anything in sand

Aren't you hungry
Aren't you hungry
Aren't you hungry

I think of people starving
But do you think I care
Let them all die hungry
So I can breathe their air

Sitting in my kitchen
Stuffed form having ate
What should I do now
With what's left on my plate
