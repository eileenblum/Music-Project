[originally by The Faith]Blinded by an image that wasn't there. Tricked by a game that wasn't fair. Deceived by people who didn't care. It's just mass confusion. Frustration and disillusion. Crying out in despair. Reaching out for what's not there. Panic, panic scream and shout. Loose your mind there's no way out. All you've got is all you need. Time to think, time to bleed.

I thought I'd found the scene. Straightedge, know what I mean? But to you it was a game. You call me fucked but you don't know my name. You're x'ed, get out of my life. How can you agree with me. Did you think I didn't see you drink, you fuck behind my back. You're not my friend, I don't need your crap. If you defend you're no better.
