Aren't you sick of the way you're living
Let down in life without being forgiven
Struggle for a future
You try to survive
Put on this world to rot and die

Let me out

Let me out me out
Me out of this world
Tell me how I got here
Why don't you say a word

Let me out me out
Me out of this world
Tell me how I got here
Why don't you say a word
