Parents
They deprive
They diminsh our time

Mother-father
Wish I was dead
Could have been cum on their bed

Put me in this world
Gave me a little
The rich fucking bastards
Didn't care at all

Wish I were dead
I'm better off alone
I don't need their raggin'
Anymore

Turn that down
That noisy music
Go to bed
And leave me the fuck alone

That's all they say
And all they do
Get me out of this place
Can't take it anymore

Wish I were dead
I'm better off alone
I don't need their raggin'
Anymore
