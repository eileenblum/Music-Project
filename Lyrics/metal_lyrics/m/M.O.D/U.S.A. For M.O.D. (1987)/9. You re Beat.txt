Start up the car
You ain't going very far
Stick the rubber hose on the exhaust

Breathe that fresh air
It'll take away your cares
You're beat the game is over
And you've lost

Y.B........
You're beat
Before you start
You cry defeat

Sitting in the bathroom
With the razor at your wrist
You mom and dad don't like
The dudes you're hanging with
They say that you're a loser
A disgrace to human kind
If I were you I'd end it all
Before I lost my mind

Y.B......
You're beat
Before you start
You cry defeat
