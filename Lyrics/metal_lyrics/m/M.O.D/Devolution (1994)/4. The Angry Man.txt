Shunned upon by his fellow man. Lives in hell and eats out of a garbage can. An alleyway is where he calls home. He fights a war and his mind is the battle zone. Blood runs down the drain, from the street of pain, you will fear his name... The Angry Man. The just, must prevail. He laughs out loud, inside his head... sirens wail. As he stands looking over the edge, he prays to Him for justice... He wants death. Life sentence. You're guilty of a crime. An episode of hatred burns in his mind. He sends a message of pain and hope of war. Sends death a knockin' at your door. Blood runs down the drain, from the street of pain, you will fear his name... The Angry Man. Mesmerized, hypnotized, standing in the dark, paralyzed.
