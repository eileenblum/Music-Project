You want it, you got it, you gonna crash n' burn. Should've listened when your momma said: "Son you're gonna crash n' burn." Runnin' hard, playin' hard, livin' by the rules of the road. Runnin' hard, playin' hard, gonna crash, you're loosin' control. Gonna crash, gonna burn, lesson learned, saw the signs. But son you didn't turn. You want it, you got it, you gonna crash n' burn. Should've listened when your momma said: "Son you're gonna crash n' burn." Out at night, outta sight. Out of mind, born to ignite. Runnin' hard, you can't last. Burnin' in the night twice as fast. Gonna crash, gonna burn, lesson learned, saw the signs. But son you didn't turn. You want it, you got it, you gonna crash n' burn. Should've listened when your momma said: "Son you're gonna crash n' burn." YOU ARE GONNA CRASH N' BURN.
