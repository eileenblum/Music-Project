Gotta time bomb, tickin' in my head. And it's 'bout to erupt. Gotta urge, gotta terrible urge. And I'm foulin' stuff up. Goin' downtown, gonna get myself known. Gonna make alotta noise. You ain't gonna make it home. Got some dope, got my scope. Your ass is mine cause I can't cope. I'm goin' insane... I'm goin' insane. Now I'm startin' to shake. I laugh and leave death in my wake. So I'm starin' at a loaded gun. As I'm loading up another one. Someone's gotta pay. I'm scopin' out a busy street. Laughing from the city heat. Someone's gotta pay. Gotta move, gotta move, gotta move, gotta move, gotta gun and somethin' to prove. I explode, I lock n' load. Gotcha in my sights as I blow my load. Deaths' toll deaths' toll. Sounds true as I unload. Down n' out, the body count is on the rise as bullets come sprayin' out. I'm goin' insane... I'm goin' insane. Now I'm startin' to shake. I laugh and leave death in my wake. So I'm starin' at a loaded gun. As I'm loading up another one. Someone's gotta pay. I'm scopin' out a busy street. Laughing from the city heat. Someone's gotta pay. (I got that off).
