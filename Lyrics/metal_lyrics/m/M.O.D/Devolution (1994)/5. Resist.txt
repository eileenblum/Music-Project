Whip me bitch until my ass bleeds. Whip me till it makes me cream. Command me to obey your rules. Command me to play the fool. Squeeze my brain, and will with your vise. Subdue me in your soul of ice. Bend me, make me understand that clay is molded into the man. Try to mold me... I resist. Try to mold me... I clench my fist. Try to mold me... I'll break away. Don't care. Won't listen, to what you have to say. If you whip the whipping boy, he will resist. Whip the whipping boy and he will resist... Resist! Rub my face into the mud. Fill me with confusion and drugs. Scorn me cause I masturbate. Crucify me, I have no faith. Try to mold me... I resist. Try to mold me... I clench my fist. Try to mold me... I'll break away. Don't care. Won't listen, to what you have to say. If you whip the whipping boy, he will resist. Whip the whipping boy and he will resist... Resist! ...Won't ...Don't ...Can't. I will exist, I will resist. Been consumed by the fires of hate. Been reborn by the glory of faith. Been healed by the love that's inside. And freed from my pride. ...Won't ...Don't ...Can't. I will resist, I will resist, I will exist...
