You better hide, the beast of night seeks you out with rage and vengeance on his mind. The meek die, as genocide, empowers everyone, that sanity defies. "Greed, will, feed", devolution. "Greed, will, feed", devolution. Turn up the heat, face the beat, there's no justice, just unjust in the streets. They march fourth, they march hard, and rally cries of coming reich's, sounds the worlds ALARM. "Greed, will, feed", devolution. "Greed, will, feed", devolution. Defy - Deface - Destroy. Devolution. Defy - Deface - Destroy. Devolution. The end of all. There's no solution.
