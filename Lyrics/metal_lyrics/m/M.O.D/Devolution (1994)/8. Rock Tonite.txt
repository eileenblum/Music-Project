ROCK! You came here to see a show. We came here to rock n' roll. Hit the lights, we'll hit the stage. We'll make this place go freakin' insane. The crowd is loud and feeling strong. We're gonna party all nite long. We're gonna rock tonite... "ROCK". Turn the power up to ten. I've come to crush, not make friends. Feel the beat thumpin' hard, thundering bass, crushing guitars. Feel the sound, pound you down. It's loud, it's true, it's underground. Hear the sound, so loud and true. And know these sounds were meant for you. Raise your fist and heed the call, of music made for one and all. It's loud, it's true. A crucial sound that butchers you. The crowd is loud and feeling strong. We're gonna party all nite long. We're gonna rock tonite... "ROCK". "ROCK". "ROCK". "ROCK". "ROCK". "ROCK". "ROCK". "ROCK". "ROCK". "ROCK". "ROCK". "ROCK". "ROCK". "ROCK n' ROLL".
