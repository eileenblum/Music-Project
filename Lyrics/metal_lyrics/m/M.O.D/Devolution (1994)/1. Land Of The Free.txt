Sow the seeds of discontent. Reap the crop of the weak and spent. Bear the yoke of the disciplined man. Who's blood was shed for Disneyland. Red and White, Scars and Stripes. Fly our colors through the night. Standing Proud and Tall. Never will we fall. We were ment to be. The Power Monopoly. March to the beat of the flute and drum. Bound to succeed, never to succumb. Gonna fight every step of the way. My life for freedom, small price to pay. Red and White, Scars and Stripes. Fly our colors through the night. Standing Proud and Tall. Never will we fall. We were ment to be. The Power Monopoly. Sow the seeds of discontent. Reap the crop of the weak and spent. Bear the yoke of the disciplined man. Who's blood was shed for Disneyland. The agony, of thee I sing. Corporate death and liberty. In agony, I pledge to thee. A toxic land, land of the free.
