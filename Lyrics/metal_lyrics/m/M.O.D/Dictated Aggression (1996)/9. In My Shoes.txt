You'll know what I'm saying. When you walk in my shoes. You'll know what I'm saying. When you walk in my shoes. Equal rights, don't apply. Quata calls, aren't civil rights. Split the vote, split the state. Split the house, income rape. Doors are shut, need not apply. There's no one here to fight for my rights. Walk the straight line. Left then the right. I live the injusted. Of liberal insight. Motor vote, I say motorhead. I work a job, I don't lay in bed. Payed my dues, pay my way. I earned the right too have my say. I'm sick to death, of liberal views. The liberal fools are fucking you too. You'll know what I'm saying. When you walk in my shoes.
