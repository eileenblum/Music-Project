Rise and shine. Crossing boarders can be fun. Causing crime. No relief from what you've done. Refried beans, U.S. dreams. Pancho villa lives next door to me. Time to ride. In your chevy you look sharp. Rising crimes. Broken bottles in the park. Jesus Christ. Those velvet paintings sure look nice. Pay the price. Oranges, pesos or your life. Baseball, apple pie, chevys U.S. dream.
