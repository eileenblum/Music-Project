Turn the T.V. on, don't touch that dial. Watch the video's, on the latest styles. Smash or trash, just 95 cents a call. Get your fix, fix your head, right said Fred. Real worlds, comin' through just for you. Top ten, comin' through just for you. Our voice, comin' through just for you. Pledge your faith. The tunes are blastin'. The latest fashion. Watch the ratings soar. As morals come down crashing. We're the demigods. And we're here to stay.
On empty V..U.S.A.
The T.V.'s on and uncle Tom is watching, just for you. Made his fame from buttheads name. Thanks too the likes of you. Cobain is dead, but not for long. We got his ass unplugged, pardon the pun. Real worlds comin' through just for you. Top ten comin' through just for you. Our voice comin' through just for you.
Empty visions, Empty V.
