I greet the day with anger, bombs and verbal threats. I lift my head, in dread, of things not yet. Lets have a drink, then throw up in the fucking sink. Shot glass...shot glass. If you're in sight, there's gonna be a fight. Shot glass...shot glass. It's me and you and shots enough for two. I drink the drink, I drink, until I drink again. I see the day, my eyes are glazed and pinned.
