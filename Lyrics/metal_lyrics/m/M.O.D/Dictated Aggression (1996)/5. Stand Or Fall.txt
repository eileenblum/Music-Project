I read the writing on the shit house walls. The lines are drawn, we must stand or fall. We the people, polarized, can't even think to sympatize. If there's no justice, there's no peace. We must unite to get aside. The woe and grief, a final stride. Must confide. May never come to save our sorry hides. Go read the writings on the wall... Stand or fall. All this talk of race and war. Leaves speechless on the floor. The futures written in the past. Etched in the memories of cynicism's laugh.
