Enter, tanks, from blue skies above. Raining down terror on all that you loved. Majestic hills that roll, under tank treads. Are painted with puddles from the recently dead. Coalitions set up to reign new conditions, new thoughts to train. Mass solution, we must confide. Is mustard gas, with your ass on rye.
Armor divisions, impervious pain.
Religious collusion, new gods ordained.
Mighty contusion, scarring the land.
Dictated aggression, dictated man.
Napalm coktails, served up hot. Claymore showers, soothe your guts. The re-conditioned, show no alarm. We re-conditioned them with our smart bombs.
