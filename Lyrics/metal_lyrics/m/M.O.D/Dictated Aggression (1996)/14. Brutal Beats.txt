It's the T to the rip. Slick and finger licken good like chicken. Possessed like Linda Blair, in exorcist. Can't front on the dragon, that's ludicrous. Your styles suckin', like a lollipop. Knock, knock who's there. Yo a buck a shot. Da fuckin' black panther. Comin' right at cha. Poisonous... I spread like cancer. Crews fuckin' hate us, I'm mad fuckin' famous. 4 takin' no shit and puttin' boots up your anus. Ruthless...I'm leaving niggas toothless. I be da ill funk freaka blown out you speakers. Hard rhythms, complete. Brutal beats of concrete.
Ruthless. But don't let that trouble you. That's ruthless, spelled with an R and not A W. Mad like Alfred Newman. Bad, like Michael J's new chin. Kickin' science harder then spock. Picken out victims like Furman with a glock. Buck, buck, buck, shots be ringing out. Slam you ass like Hogan in title bout. Hard rhythms, complete. Brutal beats of concrete.
