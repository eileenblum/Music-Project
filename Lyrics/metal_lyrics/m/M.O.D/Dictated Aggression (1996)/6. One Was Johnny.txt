Little Johnny marched out to war. On another kind of human race. Killed a man from foreign land. With a shit eatin' grin on his face. That good ol'boy had a taste for war. And warnin' had it's taste. But he died like a schmuck. With his dick in his hand. And his balls... stuck to his face.
One was Johnny, Johnny once was more than a man with a government plan and dog tags round his neck. One was Johnny, Johnny once was the meanest mother you ever did see. He put your ass in check... one was Johnny.
Johnny came home in a body bag, with a purple heart on his vest. It don't matter that they shipped the wrong legs, head, arms and chest. They had a parade in Johnny's name. People came from miles around. They buried his ass on soleme grass. With the people singing this song.
Johnny's little boy marched out to war. On another kind of human race. Killed a man from a foreign land. With a shit eatin' grin on his face. Johnny's little boys' a psychopath. With vengence at his taste. So killed some schmuck with his fucking peace sign that pissed...right on his face.
