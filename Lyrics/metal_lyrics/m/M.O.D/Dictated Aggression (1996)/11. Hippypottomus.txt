Chubby chick you look hip. When you dress up in tie die. So now what will you do that Jerry's dead. Will you finally wash your hair and join the real world. Or wait for Bob Wier to tour instead. Everybody peace out and look at the cool clouds. Granola parades, make up your weekend. Taking acid, eating your tofu. Wearing sandles, keeps you down to earth. When in reality, it's gravity versus girth. Miss Hippypottomus it's 1996. You gotta work to live. You just can't enjoy the trip... Miss Hippypottomus. I really think that Jerry was ultra cool. But unlike you he's dead now who's the fucking fool.
