I choked on a piece of the American Dream. The taste of blood, apple pie. Scars and stripes, was enough to make me scream. I cried as a piece of the rock went south. It crossed the border at half past twelve. Thanks to that dick, in the white house.
Speak with your heart. With your heart you will pay. Think your own thoughts. Your rights are cast away. Fit in the mold, then you get to plant your seed. But...silence your sin. I wipe my tears as I gaze at the red, white and blue. I think of god and of family pride who were sacrificed, for shit like you. It burns, to watch your flag, go in flames. I see the fire burning up, from thunderbird. And people haze.
