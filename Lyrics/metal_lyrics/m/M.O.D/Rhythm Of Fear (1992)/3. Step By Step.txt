It's your first show. You're scared to go. You're ass from your elbow. You can't tell what you are seein'. Is chaos in the making. The clubs shakin'. The earth quakin'. Reality on the stage. We're not fakin'. It's your first show. You treat it like a joke. You're drinking heavy straight rum no coke. After three or four, you head toward the floor. Stupid move. You should've took the door. Step by step. We're on a mission. So shut up and listen. You thing we're bitchin'. You all haven't heard shit then.
