1992. I've aged well without you. You live upon my surface. What I provide is so crucial to you. You have no idea, what do you do is a Method of my Destruction. Now, show no fear until the storm hits. And I, the earth starts crushin'. I fear no mortal. I'm a bomb in outer space. Abused and used and defaced. My vengeance, a long term affect. Your choice, respect or wreck. I am the earth. A miracle. I am the earth.
