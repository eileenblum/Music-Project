Not wanted. But a wanted man. No invitations. Invade I plan. To interrupt. Disrupt and bother. Heckle and Jeckle. Bow to honor. My presence. The intruder. Take away the i-n-t. I get ruder. I irritate. Make you hate. Inspire violence. Throughout the state. Bow to me. Down on your knees. Bow to me. I am the intruder.
