Iâve always lived the American way, the way I want to live and itâs here to stay
Got me my dogs, RV and my bar b q if your gonna fuck with me your through

I'm a proud Republican a big white loud American
Got me some John Wayne flicks where he kills the bad guy and fucks his chick
I live the American dream although what I'm paying is fucking obscene
I have the freedom that I deserve. A freedom that I preserve
So what else about me can be said?
You fuck with me you get a  boot to the head.
You've been given the choice to make
Roll the fucking dice and Iâll seal your fate
Freedom ain't free cause you think it should be 
It cost a lot more than you want to pay
Sometimes you're lucky that you have a say.

The Red, Blood Shed- White for purity
True Blue stand true RED, WHITE and SCREWED.

I'm a proud Republican a big white loud American
Got me the stars and strips flying proud throughout the night
Where the hell is the American dream I see advertised on my TV 
4 payments of a buck o 5- that's not too much to keep freedom alive
Freedom ain't free cause you think it should be 
It cost a lot more than you want to pay
Sometimes you're lucky that you have a say.

Freedom - ain't free- .
It takes alot to want to be free
It' cost alot to want to be free
You fight alot to want to be free
It takes a fight to live to be free
