This is a story about small town local boy- 
a broken e- string and the greatest lie ever told. 
It cost him his soul. the bell tolls.
Standing at the crossroads, where all the sinners waits 
For redemption or fate.. 

Liars burn in hell. You should have never Lied, But you did!

Itâs about James Hetfield how he passed the torch and save the day
he in Landed in his helicopter and gave a Gibson guitar away.

Liars burn in hell. You should have never Lied, But you did!

Liar -Liar pantâs on fire. Stick a needle in your eye and hope you donât die.
I see the problem here, it wont just disappear, you need to face your fears
We all have our cross to bear- Something's arenât meant to share
LIAR!!!!
Liars burn in the fires of hell. [Devils laughs]
There is no redemption, for lyings a sin.
The Devil is waiting-to eat your soul
Ohhhh! Satan! Grandma!
Oh noHe he comes-The Devil to torture the liar
Breathing flames heâll drink your blood
No salvation from his pyre
ahhhh- your gonna fry
Ahhhh-- your gonna burn
ahhhhh- youâll never know
Cause liars never learn 
oh, it was all a bad safe at home, in your bed- snuggle up
Take a deep breath, sigh in relief
Your safe-PSYCH!!
[DEVIL LAUGHING]
Guess whose under your bed.
There is no salvation for lyings a sin
Oh no-- await your judgment.. The devil is waiting.
Pain and torment, Horror your judgment.

[laughter]
