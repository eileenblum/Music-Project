Kill/Fight 
all we do is Kill, Kill and fight 
I feel the world is closing in and there is no tomorrow
I see the world is full of sin, selfishness and sorrow, no tomorrow 

I got to get away, I got to get away
There is no use there is no truth. 
Iâm not PC- Democracy's become the mob and the mob is out for blood
Iâll choose my fate-My fate. Take a chance don't you hesitate
I got to get away, I got to get away
Why donât they just let it be..

Life unfolds in front of your eyes
Don't you let it pass, pass on by
Then one day it's gone in a blink of an eye 

I got to get away, I got to get away
There is no use try and fight when thereâs no truth. 
Iâm not PC- Democracy's become the mob.
Iâll choose my fate-My fate. Take a chance don't you hesitate
I got to get away - get away

Memories seem fond, do you remember really remember 
Whatâs going on, you seem to be a bit cloudy in the head
The shadows of your past, Have come back at last
Do you think youâll last, do you think youâll last 

Life unfolds in front of your eyes
Don't you let it pass, pass on by
Then one day it's gone in a blink of an eye
DEad and gone in a blink of an eye.

I feel the walls come closing in- I got to get away
No room to breathe my brain is pinned- I got to get away
Can't get relief or get from it all- I got to get away
Can't get away can't take into more- I got to get away
Get away, Get away- I got to get away
