Here comes le cucarachas. Across the Rio Grande
Shaking their maracas invading my homeland
No sign of integration its simple infiltration
To disrespect the legalized - break into our Nation.

There is a taco bell-Next to the Alamo
It just goes to show you-America needs more men like John Wayne
To drive them south of the boarder again 
We must have National pride, Americans rise! 

Here comes le cucarachas. To pick all the tomatoes
En (bente) in le casa La raza el invado!
My neighborhood el stinko, my country down the drinko
The ACLU sold us out Death to those fuckin Pinkos!
There is a taco bell-Next to the Alamo
It just goes to show you-America needs more men like John Wayne
To drive them south of the boarder again 
We must have National pride, Americans rise! 

Jose Can you see. By the Dawns early light
The Gallant did gleam as they rose up to fight
We dug in our heels ramparts reinforced
We'll stand once again against invading hordes
The rockets red glare showed us the way
We once were a nation of fighting brigades 
Bombs bursting with truth gave proof to our plight
This Flag we defend, our country- our lives!
