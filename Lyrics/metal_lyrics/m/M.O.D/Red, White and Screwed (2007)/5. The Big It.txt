What you get, is what you see if what you want is to be me I have no fear
inside you see of you or your hypocrisy!!!!!!!

I think it's kinda odd that people point at me
What the fuck do they see? 
They act like I am Hitler born again 
Taking every word that I say literally
some people need to lighten up
I ain't going nowhere!
They say I am the devil incarnate
Who am I to disagree
They look to sanctify me
They think my free speech is nothing but free hate
Iâll make this point once again.
My sword is mightier then your pen!

Step to the plate,` take your best shot
I know your best shots not good enough
I donât give a shit - I seen The big IT!!
the Big it! 
Go!
Iâve been living in overdrive these past years
planning over many beers the war to be fought for years
Itâs good to be back- shed your fuckin tears 
Fuck all you PC pricks- your spineless and PC is proof of it.
Time has come to hit shit balls fucking out
let the beer mad anger flow this ain't no fucking emo show 
Stomp that new metal jacket to the floor 
show that kid the door -letâs get drunk and stomp some more.
Step to the plate,` take your best shot
I know your best shots not good enough
I donât give a shit - I seen The big IT!!
the Big it! 

You can kiss my ass until tomorrow comes 
You can praise me until you think that my friendships won
I donât give a shit about what you think or say
I donât give a fuck because
You are nothing lower than a worm
Squirm for me bitch
Hereâs alittle scoop I got some news for you 
Your momma calls me the big daddy
Watch you gonna do, I ate your chicken soup
Your momma knows how to treat me right.
