[Bonus Track]Iâd never knew love until the knight that I met you
Goddess/Devil 
I never knew love could hurt like an open wound 
Goddess/Devil
I swore Iâd be yours until the end of the world
Goddess/Devil
I swore to god it was real love heâd watch it unfurl
Goddess /Devil
now I see our love was a disease that was not meant to exist at all.
Our true love had it all
Goddess/Devil, sheâs my goddess heâs my devil.

I smell the love coming off of you - I start to melt from your perfume
Were gonna take a trip to just me and you a share a love for two 
I remember the look, look in your eyes, 
my honey pie - Right then and There it was okay to die, to die - I wanted to die. 
We were in a world that was only filled with a love that we both shared
Only heaven and god witnessed our love and sin - but we didnât care

thatâs the story of the jilted lovers. They loved each other and no other.
They died for love....
