Testify to the living truth he will be reborn
Witness those who just seek proof, they stand there unsure
Millions beg forgiveness when their petty deeds are done

Turned away to repent - 
the sacred heart and sacrament 
stand witness the Faith
Praise, Dance around with snakes
Social decay, deconstruction, torture, mayhem my malfunction
Fascist states of misdirection, Perfect plans but no perfection
Turned away to repent - 
the sacred heart and sacrament 
stand witness the Faith
Praise, Dance around with snakes
Suicide your soul to sleep, the reaper in the blackness creeps

Dance around with snakes

I - will never walk alone again
I know not fear
