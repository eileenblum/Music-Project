The constitutions not a death pact 
Weâve evolved more than it thatâs a fact 
People waive their guns and thatâs their right to do
Most people, just complain because itâs safe to do.
Which one are you? 

I look around the world whatâs goin on?
There never seems to be an end to too all the bullshit
What the fuck is this? 
Whatâs with Muslims cutting off peoples heads.
Whatâs with Jews droppin bombs instead of breaking bread.
Now, Iâm truly pissed!
Suicide bombers headed down town- destination paradise 
Only body parts will be found. Hey look thereâs a head That muthafucker is absolutely dead
 Packin their camels ass full of dynamite- You have to wonder why?
I never seen a camel fly..hey thatâs a neat trick. 
but itâs still pretty sick- itâs really sick! You guys are real dicks!

We donât strap bombs on our kids. Thatâs not how we live. 
Whatâs so great about killing for GOD
Suicide bomb population overload
Itâs a sad fact- that most people suck
when killing for GOD- everyone's fucked

Sometimes life is so overbearing that even the simple act of sharing
makes it so impractical that itâs impossible, not even probable- 
simply unimaginable really unobtainable.
Sensory system on overload- whatâs with all the codes
Red alert everyone stay home.

Whose life is it anyway- one life we have to live-, I want to live it my own way
No matter what they say, Just take it day by day. No matter what they say.
This is your life, This is your time, don't step out of line. 
We are watching -Ten thousand cameras in your town
We hear you- Even when weâre not around
Just sit back, enjoy 
Itâs a beautiful day- Everythingâs is not ok!
..
life is beautiful simple wonderful, life is beautiful...
