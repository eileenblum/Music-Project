Your revolutions come and gone 
you took a chance and rolled the dice against the will of social change 
still think- that Che - will live on
Heâs on your shirt not in your heart your revolutions alaâ carteâ

Speaking truth to power, speaking truth to power.

take a chance and roll the dice 
against the corporate whores who live in Babylon
They 'I'll bring the pain you better think again 
think again, the sword is much more practical then a pen.

Speaking truth to power, speaking truth to power.
Thereâs got to be a better . A better way.
Thereâs got to be a better- A better way. 
Your revolutions come and gone
had your chance all you did was drink coffee and blog
safe inside the safety net 
100 million lonely souls wishing that they had my balls

Speaking truth to power, speaking truth to power. 

you want to make a stand, prove that your the better man
you exist to make the point that you exist and thatâs your point.
suffering phantom pains- of phantom wars you never fought
Youâll never know the price of loss..

The time has come for all to speak, 
speak out loud - speak as one
Today's the day that we all say 
âWe want freedom, we fucking paidâ... 

Your revolutions come and gone 
you took a chance and rolled the dice against the will of social change 
Heâs on your shirt not in your heart that you just bought at your Wal-Martâ
