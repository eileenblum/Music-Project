I was watching TV. and I heard it on the News
Big brother is watching and listening to you.
He's tapping all the phones and reading my e-mail 
I know he's got in for me I'm gonna go to jail
The writings on the wall @Infowars.com
I threw out all my porno mags and even smashed my bong.
Yeah I love my country the way it used to be
Before the government came and fucked it up for me.
I'm not a fuckin commie- I even like John Wayne
Saw Yankee doodle dandy-been singing in the rain

Bullshit fucking politics and all the shit that's said
Has walking around all day I'm seeing fuckin red
Never want to go outside even to be seen
Pressure from this fucking life is starting to kill me
Fuckin liberals, communist, Neo Fascist politics
Jaded in your evil ways, fuckin die.
Bullshit fucking politicians all the shit they do
Do you think they give a shit about poor ol me and you
All we are a fucking cattle herded into pens
Slaughtered for our taxes then left for dead
Fuckin liberals, communist, Neo Fascist politics
Your jaded in your evil ways, fuck-in die, go away.
I was watching TV. and I heard it on the News
Our freedoms are eroding and it's giving me the blues
Their protecting us from us-they say it's very simple
But the constitution states â We are the peopleâ
What the hell just happened to our âbill of rightsâ
The government signed them away in the middle of the night
I have to hang my head in dismay and disbelief
George Bush let me down and Clintons a thief
They' got a master plan get control of me.
They want to micro-chip my brain- to set my mind at ease

So much for the land of the free
So much for be all you can be
So much for freedom of speech
They want to keep all of us on the government leash
This is not what my father fought for
He fought the Nazis in the second world war
What do you mean? America has concentration camp?
In Philadelphia, brother we don't stand a chance
So much for the land of the free
So much for be all you can be
So much for freedom of speech
They want to keep all of us on the government leash

You canât exchange security for freedom
Censorship is not freedom- Tyranny is not the American way
but itâs our lives
Itâs now our lives
