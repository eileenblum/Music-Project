Son you be proud-fight the good fight
defend those who fear, God-Country, liberty for your life. 

Iâm the spawn of an old school man 
who liberated people from the Nazi's hands.
he taught me his values and his beliefs 
He reminded me that life ain't cheap.
he said: 
son you be proud-fight the good fight
defend those who fear, God-Country, liberty for your life.
I would rather die, then betray my beliefs
I donât deny, that I would rather die - on my feet
I recognize, my inner faith against- against my foes
Iâd rather die, not exist then wear someone else's clothes.
