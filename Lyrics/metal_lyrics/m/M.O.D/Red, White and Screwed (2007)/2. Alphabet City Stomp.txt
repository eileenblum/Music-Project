I remember the hardcore days when I was hanging at CbGbâs bouncing the stage.
I remember the Psycho's shows and times were great-Times were great!
I remember seeing Murphyâs law when Jimmy G looked at me and passed me the bong, bong bong. I remember the good oleâ days and they were the good olâe days-

New York-East Coast-
L.A. West Coast-
Fucking Texas! hardcore and proud. 

Hardcore- you think that youâll last hereâs a elbow to the head and a boot to the ass 
It's gonna come down to me vs. you watch you gonna do.
Skakin- to the bad brains I'm a 300 pound loco macho insane
got a pound of balls for every ounce that I weigh, you best get out of my way. 
I remember the A7 club, the alphabet city streets where we hung
Still that time was the best time I ever had. N.Y Skins Heads! 
I remember Bloom de Blue, Johnny Nordquist and Big Charlie too
Raybeez and Frechy the skin your truly missed 
I raise a toast to our friends.
