Another species dead and gone-the master species presses on, 
All is lost, All is lost what will be the final cost
Where is god to intervene? Donât you hear your children scream? 
All alone, all alone- we are fucking all alone,
There is no one, nothing else -we are all alone
Genocide, genocide , plastic mold injected people on the rise
procreating ourselves into extinction.
All is lost, all is lost I don't even fucking care
All should learn, All should burn 
this disease man...
I wouldn't save from the pinchers of hell
Prevent another holocaust or stop the comet that fell 
We are gonna get everything that we deserve, we are nothing! 
Iâd light up Krakatoa just to choke out the sky
Take a bath in acid rain as a tsunami passed by
I crack a Guinness open and with a wink to my life
and Iâd say goodbye 
To a world that is pure shit
Full of selfish bastards and religious zealots
If I had the big red button I fucking push it.
You can bet on it.
There no salvation for petty selfish fools
Who prayed away a life to live by someone else's rules
If there really was a God then it be plain enough to see
That there would be no war, no pain, no misery and no me!
