[Ovee]

Running through the road with a dagger in her throat
She never had the chance of screaming
Now she's floating in the river
Raped and murdered in this city of senseless crime

Where corruption rules
Law is for the fools
They never care never dare to capture the slayer
You'll bleed to death and your rotten flesh will bring
The triumph of the villain

He will kill at his will
He's never gonna stop
That's the deal
Eying his prey
From the shadow of death
It's time to begin
The merciless killing

Another day begins
One more life is in pain
Beheaded body hanging upside down
Another life goes in vain
While you're sitting on the chair without a care
Living fine in this goddamned city of human sacrifice
