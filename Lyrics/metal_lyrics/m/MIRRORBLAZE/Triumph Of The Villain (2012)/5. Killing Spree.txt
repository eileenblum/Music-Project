[Ovee]

Here we are in the age of deception
Here we watch and learn the ways of destruction
Autocracy is the power to control everything
Forgery and deceit in the name of democracy

Dare not to speak
Dare not to see
You can't tell it's hypocrisy
People disappear into thin air
They're gone and lost,no one knows where

Here we go to see the core of corruption
We'll blend in and wait for the assassination
Stealth action
We'll go undercover
One by one
They will die, they must suffer

Don't let their words get into your head
Cause we're in a war against them
They won't get away from our rage
Out of their den into the open
They judge the people with a sinister smile
On them we'll unleash our killing spree

Decades have passed
Freedom is lost
So take the shot
And spill the blood

We are many but we attack as one
Silent killing is our only chance
From above we'll trigger the gun
And watch our enemies burn

Dare not to miss
Fear not to kill
There won't be any second chance
Pull the trigger
Kill the robber
Finish the monarchy once and for all
