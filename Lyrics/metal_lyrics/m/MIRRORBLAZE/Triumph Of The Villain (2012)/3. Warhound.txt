[Ovee]

Sleepless nights alone I pass in this trench of bloody war
My brothers shot dead before my eyes
One gun one bullet i must survive

Fire,fire
Fire at will
Fight,fight
Fight to kill

Pointless bloodshed across the world for the ever elusive peace
I found myself in the bullet storm
My troops are left to bleed

Fire,fire
Fire at will
Fight,fight
Fight to kill

Selfish pride
Never ending fight
Millions die
Beneath blood red sky
Nuclear strike
Humanity denied
Radiation remains
Death prevails

I march towards the battlefield
It's my fate and I can't escape
For I've killed countless innocents
I'm a warhound I must not regret

The path of retaliation fades into oblivion
My death will only spread the plague
The plague of war
