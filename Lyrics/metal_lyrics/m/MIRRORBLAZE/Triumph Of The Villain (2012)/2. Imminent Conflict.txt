[Ovee]

Its a brainwashed herd that we call our nation
They are kept under control
They say they know their religion
But uses it like a fatal weapon

Deceitful leaders of our land
Conspire, control and command
The gullible flock that
Fall for every trick in their bag

I declare war
Let's kill them all
Fight with your might only then you can survive
Don't fall in the trap
Prepare yourself for the attack

People are starving and they mock their sufferings
They feast on these lives
In peoples death they thrive

These parasites are getting strong
They are using you as the pawn
They are sucking blood out of your body
Leaving your shell to perish and rot
