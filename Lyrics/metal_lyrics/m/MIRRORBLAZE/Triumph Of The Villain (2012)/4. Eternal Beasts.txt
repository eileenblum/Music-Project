[Ovee]

We rise from the mist
Ageless spirits
We see through your eyes
Everlasting greed

Your fear is our strength
You defy us we avenge for the sake of our domain
Eternal beasts we remain

Behold
Honour the sons of hell
Rise
Join the unholy race

We rule the pit of fire
Omnipotent grace
We seek for the lost souls in oblivion of disarray

In war we live as the weapon of death
In death we torture as the bringer of pain
In tyranny we reign
We decide your fate
As the conspiracy of evil men
We destroy and desecrate

Nightmares of your life won't just go away
Your soul is ours to keep
We'll see you in hell
