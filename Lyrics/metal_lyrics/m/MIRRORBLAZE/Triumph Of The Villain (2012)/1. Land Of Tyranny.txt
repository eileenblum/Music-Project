[Ovee]

When the fire is burning bright from the mountain top
We march towards the light
Timeless existence we ignite

Bastardised blood spreading chaos asking for war to rise
We brace ourselves to attack
This tyrant land must fall
Never to retreat only death sets you free
Avenge your ancestors behead the enemy
Endure the agony of losing so many brave souls
For we are closer than we ever was and we will conquer
The tyrant, land of tyranny

We ride through the woods
Ascend the pile of stained bones
We soak our swords in hatred to abolish their morbid rules
Scorching sun over us, swamp of blood ahead
Unseen beast in disguise craving for our flesh
We desecrate everything that cross our sacred path
For we are closer than we ever was and we shall not fall
We must not fall
In this land of tyranny
