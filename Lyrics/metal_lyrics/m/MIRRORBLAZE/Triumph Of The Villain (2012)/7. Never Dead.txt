[Ovee]

Rusty brains of the faggots
Eaten by the maggots
Countless days of havoc
Deceived by the false hope

Never dead,you always lie
Never dead,will you ever die?

With power and money you'll rule
Slavery is the best thing you can do
Just die already and let us lead
This part of land is ours to keep

Your idiocracy must end
Vengeance dwells in my brain
You don't care whats going on
S.O.A.B.S.M.

You make plastic promises
So you'll get elected
Force feed your fucking thoughts
Ruin the society and bring forth chaos
