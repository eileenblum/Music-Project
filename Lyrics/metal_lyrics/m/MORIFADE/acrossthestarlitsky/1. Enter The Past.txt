[Music: J. Johansson / Lyrics: J. Johansson]

For years the Cheops laid to waste
A realm in the middle of east
In Egypts ancient world
The dynasty spread fear to men
A journey through the history
Where blood and pain unite
Stone by stone, life by life
Became sacrifice
For the whips and the chains
And the soul devourers jaws

Enter the past
In the ancient pyramids
And the temples built of stone
Where the Pharaoh king remains
After all and for all eternity

From dawn to dusk the Cheops ruled
His crown glanced with glory and pride
As others lost their lives
The circumstances reaped its men
A flight through the tempel of dead
Began in afterlife

Stone by stone...

Enter the past...

So the dynasty was ruined
The darkness fell and the spirits arose
To forever soar in ones mind,
In all ancient rhymes and here between the lines

Stone by stone...

Enter the past...
