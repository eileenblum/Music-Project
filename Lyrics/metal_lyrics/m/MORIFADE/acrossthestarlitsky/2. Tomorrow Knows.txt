[Music: J. Johansson / Lyrics: J. Johansson]

The future is calling
The past is behind
For aeons of damage, a world goes blind
Eech day's coming closer
The end of the world
So come, join our forces, A world's disturbed
It can't stop tomorrow
We won't stop today
We have to save the world from decay

As darkness falls
We fear the sun won't shine
Tomorrow knows
Sooner or later we'll face
The end of the world

The ocean's increasing
The ice melting by
A hailstorm, tornado disturb ones eye
The one who can stop this
Will be sanctified
As long as we're living, we fear the time

The doom of tomorrow
We fear day by day
A silent funeral without clay

As darkness falls...
