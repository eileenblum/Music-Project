[Music: J. Johansson / Lyrics: J. Johansson]

I did not really knew her
One day she bid farewell
Leaving us forever
A nightmare hard to tell
For thee, maybe we'll be
Together someday
Forever in Wonderland
No Alice by your side
I wish I could be with her
Forever...In a distant world

Her life dried out in cancer
She's dying from inside
A beauty in existence
Until her soul divide
Ooh Lord!!! Please, tell me why
The mourning tears I cry

Forever in Wonderland...

All she left was memories
And sorrow to mankind
Her life is still another
Too young to fall behind
The gate, a wayward fate
For a lovely girl like her

Forever in Wonderland... [Twice]
