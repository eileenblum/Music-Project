Sign of the night rules the world
The light were slowly drained away from me now
Baptised in blood to be there, into their life of sacred rites and fear

Plunge your soul in the circle, of their blinding faith

Veiled in their hate and despise
I can't believe that I betrayed myself
Standing alone in the shades
Something is calling on them deep in the night

Plunge your soul in the circle of their faith
We're taking the chalice, of their blinding faith

I will find my soul
I will find my way here, until the end, down towards the road
through the waste and the soil
I will find my way, blinded by the light
I will find my way through the wasteland, dying scenes that will keep me alive

I will find my soul
I will find my way here, until the end, down towards the road
through the waste and the soil
t will find my way, blinded by the light
I will find my way through the wasteland, dying scenes that will keep me alive
