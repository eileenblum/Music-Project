You strike at me just when I'm in shallow water
Try to snare my soul while it still bleeds
Ripping my wounds out and cut me clean again now
Retribution from a ghost within

I can not see the light in the rise from a fading morning
From the womb that feed me, arise so strong
You give me comfort when the fools around deceives me
Bring me to my knees and drown my heart

I sense it's growing all around me, the pain that gives me comfort here
It feels as it's the only thing that surrounds me, I'm building life out of lies

Solitude regains in strength, blind my clear visions out of life
Solitude regains its strength, cloud my mind with anguish and the fear

I feel a burning sense grows inside of my heart
Empty spaces filling up my life
The bitter end seems to getting closer to me
Bring me to my knees and drown my heart

I sense it's growing all around me, the pain that gives me comfort here
It feels as it's the only thing that surrounds me, I'm building life out of lies

Solitude regains in strength, blind my clear visions out of life
Solitude regains its strength, cloud my mind with anguish and the fear
