"What did you have in mind?"
I know, I know that I failed
"Are you ready to sacrifice it all to know?"
I take; I take my own life just to know
"Don't you have no belief,"

Selling our lives, for the best price and greed
Slaves of our time, consumed by need
Feed on their mind, and breed on deceives
Try not to need, but failed

Out of the redemption,
Entrust my heart when you said it's true
The call awakens from me.
Calling out from the dirt now!
The call awakens from me
The bringer of life

Living their lives in search for success
Walk with your fire, feel your will
Let it's enrol your path through your life
Waking on soil where blood has been spilled

Out of the redemption
Entrust my heart when you said it's true
The call awakens from me
Calling out from the dirt now!
The call awakens from me
The bringer of life

When you said it's true
The call awakens from me
Calling out from the dirt now!
The call awakens from me
The bringer of life
