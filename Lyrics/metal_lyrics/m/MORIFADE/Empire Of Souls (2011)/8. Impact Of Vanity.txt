I feel the light it came and took my darkened heart
I'll never know my righteous path but I must believe, and have some faith in me
Straying alone now is this empty hollow space
Keeping my trail on to the way of a fallen time
Glory on me

Try, to believe here in me
Why, would I feed on a lie that will only deceive?

I will live here again and I cleanse me from pain
Never feed on your ego again
I will long for my life, as the one I once had
Never straying alone in this land, never again

All of my silence redirects my words to lies
The fear will drain my strength and force my thoughts to stand, in shade of yours
I trust your words and lies, wrapped in velvet shine
Finding myself walking the line of a wasted time
Left here alone

Try, to believe here in me
Why, would I feed on a lie that will only deceive?

I will live here again and I cleanse me from pain
Never feed on your ego again
I will long for my life, as the one I once had
Never straying alone in this land
