Falling so deep into my ashes, of my own ruthless and guilty confession
Building the guilt from my heart
No longer I see the real fire, never I witness some true desires
Bleeding from my wounded thoughts.
Show me some strong and true conviction, what is the meaning to live in darkness?
World seems to complex for me
Live a charade of made up fiction, creating a mindless being inside me
All to be part of their plan

Say, why we all must be failed
Tell, what's on the other side
I'm longing to see
Say, why we all must be failed
Tell, what's on the other side
I'm longing to see

Look at us as we crawling in fear, steeling my dream and
Bond my mind with your misleading campaign
Bathing in blood that we just drained out, Laugher from failed
Ones that still suffer drawn all the joy out of here

Say, why we all must be failed
Tell, what's on the other side
I'm longing to see
Say, why we all must be failed
Tell, what's on the other side
I'm longing to see
