Transmitting my thoughts, through your mist of belief
When I'm trying to speak, my words they never reach
I kept it to my dreams, to secure myself from the failed way of disbelief
It all reflects in my eyes, can't see the past event, when you spoke about deceiving lies

You see in my eyes
The depths of the bitter void
Deep in my eyes

Rising of the sun, enlightens my heart
Where the emptiness reigned in a life lived in vain
Tears of a fallen time, still falling on my cheek
From a life of mistrusted belief
Pure as a child in deeds, with absence of sin
Somehow it all came to bruise my soul

Walking through the fields, where I harvested my lies
The ashes of my deeds flourish around my feet
Misery loves my company
Trying to see inside what I have left behind, what makes my world spinning around

You see in my eyes
The depths of the bitter void
Deep in my eyes
