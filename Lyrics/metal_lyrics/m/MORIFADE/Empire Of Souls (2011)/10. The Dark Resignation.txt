Away from the light, I hear a silent calling
Leaving my state from this earth
Winds are taking me into a silent formation
I know my plans; try to snare

Night came, feel the temptation now
We know

I will hear the nightfall cry, now feeling the fear grows
Embrace me now, when crimson tears fall

I can feel them here, I have dreamed of this inside me
They're haunting me, with painful screams

Night came, feel the temptation now
We know

I will hear the nightfall cry, now feeling the fear grows
Embrace me now, when crimson tears fall
Embrace me now, when crimson tears fall
