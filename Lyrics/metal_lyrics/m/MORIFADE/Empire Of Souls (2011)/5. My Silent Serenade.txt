Rise from the ashes to haunting my passion of guilt
Hiding in the shadows of sorrow, my inner hate
Sense the guilt stare at me, from a distant time
Darkness eclipses my once so, bright sight
Spawned in a world where my feelings turned cold
Lead by their fate and dismay

Feel my Spirit flies free, from reign of chaos inside of me
Feel the essence of lies, it hiding in shades of my time

Like the venom that runs, inside my veins
Assassin is dressed in a fatal disguise
Charades made of hate and deceiving my mind
Keeping my mind, till the end.

Feel my Spirit flies free, from reign of chaos inside of me
Feel the essence of lies, it hiding in shades of my time

Feel my Spirit flies free, from reign of chaos inside of me
Feel the essence of lies, it hiding in shades of my time
Feel my Spirit flies free, from reign of chaos inside of me
Feel the essence of lies, It hiding in shades of my time
