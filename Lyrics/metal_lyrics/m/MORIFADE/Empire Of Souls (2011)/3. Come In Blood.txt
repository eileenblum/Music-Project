All the light strained out of me and dark is my deepest will now
Ruled by the power, conjured deep inside of me
It will lead me through my whole life with my own disagree
No sight of light in this faith that I have

Doomed to veil my soul into the depth of terror and your silence
Signs of hate controlling my life, hear the vicious calling

My spirit; crying to remember
No warning, I am facing my deadly fate
My spirit, it will cry forever
Wait and see; maybe my soul will remain, my soul will remain

Come to me with your glory and strength, with power paid with my blood
Swear my last vow, feel It deep inside my soul
See the sign of my depression, I took It with my own will
Time for conviction draws near for me now

Doomed to veil my soul into the depth
Of terror and your silence
Signs of hate controlling my life,
hear the vicious calling

My spirit; crying to remember
No warning, I am facing my deadly fate
My spirit, it will cry forever
Wait and see; maybe my soul will remain, my soul will remain

My silence wrecked my soul; it has woken my own fear
Trapped in my own despair, can't find a way that leads from here
Spawned out of chaos
Spawned out of shadows

I feel deep inside the rites are calling on me
Trapped in my own despair can't find a way that leads from here
Spawned out of chaos
Spawned out of shadows

My spirit; crying to remember
No warning, I am facing my deadly fate
My spirit, it will cry forever
Wait and see; maybe my soul will remain
