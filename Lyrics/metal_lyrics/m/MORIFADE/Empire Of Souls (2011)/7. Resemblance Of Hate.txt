Chanting my song through the air, as long as my voice will bear

The screaming from my mind and my turmoil lives in my darkest dreams
My voice will tell it to me that later in life I'll see
As years are passing me by I see the light taking dawn in my soul
Trying to light up my mind into the depths of me

Feelings are taking over my present life on earth,
Darkness is clouding my mind, and fear is taking on me

I will never speak my words again
I will put my trust in you
For as long as I can hear, your words

Clean my soul from the pain, run away
Run away from me
Come here, you'll be ever free

I'm screaming out all of my hate and so all of my despair
Feelings are growing so cold into my shade of fate
The fear of standing alone, embraced the way that I chose in my life
Chanting my songs through the air, as long as my mind
Can hear your words tell me

Feelings are taking over my present life on earth, darkness is
Clouding my mind, and fear is taking on me

I will never speak my words again
I will put my trust in you
I will never speak my words again
I will put my trust in you
For as long as I can hear, your words
