[Music: J. Johansson / Lyrics: J. Johansson]

I dreamed about a free world
I dreamed that I was god
I ruled the kingdom Tellus
Without no reign in blood

If dreams were true I'm free
To deny the reality
Where steel and madness reigns
[1][2] In a way too hard to change
[3] Now it's time to make a change 

Lost in a world
Tell me, why am I here?
Lost in a world
Left with anguish and fear
In a world of steel 

I saw a million faces
I saw them there before
The violence was taking over
And masters came with war 

If dreams were true I'm free... 

Lost in a world...

Lost in a world...
