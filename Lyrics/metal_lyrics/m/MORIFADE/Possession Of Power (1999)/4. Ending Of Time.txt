[Music: J. Johansson / Lyrics: J. Johansson]

The world keeps turning faster each day
The evolution proceeds in it's pace

At the edge of sanity
Awaits insanity 

The years of damage lies under the sun
A selfish mankind with minds lost in time 

In the atmospheria
Awaits hysteria 

In the ancient times
A wise man told his prophecy
He had seen it all
The perish in fire - The end of it all 

The ending of time
A prophets prediction
Foretold soon will rise
And prove us the truth
When the world is falling down
The ending of time 

It's time to change and understand why
Our Mother Nature's got tears in her eyes 

We're the ones who holds the key
The key of destiny 

In the ancient times: 

The ending of time:
