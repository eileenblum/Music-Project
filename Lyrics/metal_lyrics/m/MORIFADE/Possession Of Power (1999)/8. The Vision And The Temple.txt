[Music: J. Johansson / Lyrics: J. Strandh]

A traveller against storm and rain
A journey trailed by fire and pain
Doomed to follow the inner flame
Drags a child through grime and shame

The burning heat from my deepest core
Allows my struggle to reach the shore
Into the fire - I sense the gold
Beyond the moon and the earth so cold 

Obey the call
From the star of fate
Proceed or fall
Lightnings from the damion of my heart 

Lead me and regain my inner force
The vision...Once foretold
Take me to the temple damion
The vision...Guides my course 

A traveller against storm and rain
A journey trailed by fire and pain
Doomed to follow the inner flame
Drags a child through grime and shame 

Fallen the star
Black as it passes through my heart 

Lines through my life
Drawn by the edge of the star
