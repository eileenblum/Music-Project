[Music: J. Johansson / Lyrics: J. Johansson]

Once a king to be
A king for all eternity
Deep within my dreams
Where I can make-believe

Within my dreams I'm reaching thrones
As king with inner force
To strike a dome 

I am my own - My own majesty
King of all kings
In my land of dreams
I am my own - My own majesty
One with the crown
In a land unseen
Where I am dynasty 

I am the righteous one
The choosen one of mighty sons
King within my dreams
Until awakening comes 

Within my dreams... 

I am my own...
