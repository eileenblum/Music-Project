[Music: J. Johansson / Lyrics: J. Johansson]

If I was an enchanter
I would fix my eyes on you
To watch thy secrets
In disguise and out of view

All I'd seen before my eyes
Is a vision filled with lies
A trust is dying hard

When I'm told excuses
There's no meaning to believe
In a common liar
I don't need no point of view

All I'd seen...

How would it be
To be slave beneath a spell?
Being bewitched and seduced
To the empty nothingness
How would it be
To feel fear against a spell?
An act of obedience begins
When thy passion burns in hell

How would it be...
