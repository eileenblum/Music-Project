[Music &amp; Lyrics: J. Johansson]

We'll take on the world
The final embrace
We've got the power
The magic and faith
Still we go - Still we know
There's no force greater 
[PRE CHORUS 1]
Forever...endeavour
There's no stand away
We'll gather one day
Forever...endeavour
Break these walls of never

There's no way to stop
We'll never give up
Our future's written
Our faith will remain
Heed the call - We won't fall
We'll rise together

[PRE CHORUS 2]
Forever...endeavour
Rise along the way
United we'll stay
Forever...endeavour
Last eternally

[CHORUS]
Higher and higher we'll rise
We'll raise our power
Strong as a legion we ride
To keep our faith alive
Decade to decade
We'll raise our power
Higher and higher we'll rise
As long as we're alive

[PRE CHORUS 2 - CHORUS]
