[Music &amp; Lyrics: H. Weimedal]

For many years now I have been told
That I will pay for all my sins
But I don't know what, what I have done
Can someone tell me what I've done wrong 
Trapped in a dungeon, chained to the bones
The walls are closing, surrounding me
My heart is hollow, filled with despair
Ooh hear my pleading, please hear my prayer

[PRE CHORUS]
The voices in my mind
Please take this pain away

[CHORUS]
In times of darkness
I am scared to close my eyes
I'm scared to falling into sleep
My mind is tumbled
By the memories of my past
Can someone help me, save my soul?

I feel he's close now I feel him breathe
Can sense the fear Can sense the pain
This is my doomsday This is my end
My life is over, was it all in vain?

[PRE CHORUS - CHORUS]
