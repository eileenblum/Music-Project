[Music: J. Johansson]
[Lyrics: H. Weimedal]

I'm haunted by shadows inside
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
The lunacy strikes from behind
Planting its roots inside your mind 
[PRE CHORUS]
I feel so strange
I feel so lame in my soul
From time to time it's hard to tame
Doing things I can't control

[CHORUS]
I am lost to insanity
When will I break free?

I'm running away from my life
Knowing the lunacy's thrown the dice
I'm loosing the knowledge of me
Why can't you see that I...

[PRE CHORUS - CHORUS]

Save me from insanity
Save me from myself
Breakable as it may seem
But trust me I have seen
The depths of hell

[CHORUS]

When will I break free?

Help me to escape!!!
