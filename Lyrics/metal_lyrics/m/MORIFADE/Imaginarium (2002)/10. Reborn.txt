[Music &amp; Lyrics: J. Johansson]

The hope is lost in the glass of time
To say a prayer's in vain
After all nothing will remain
The sins we've made still widen the wounds
A dying legacy
In the breed of new technology 
[PRE CHORUS]
Take us to a place where we can save our souls
From the ashes of the earth into nevermore
Our souls will remain

[CHORUS]
Fly...we'll reach the sky
Reborn here after
Die...to remain in afterlife
Fly...from here and now
Reborn here after
Die...for a greater paradise

We've lived our lives, now we're left to die
The Armageddon's vague
Will arise with a fiery plague
The end of days lies before us now
We'll reach infinity
Then we'll breed a new mythology

[PRE CHORUS - CHORUS]
