[Music: J. Johansson / Lyrics: J. Johansson]

There is a war, to know for sure
Religion's what they're fighting for
It's hard to see news on T.V.
Screaming bodies all around 

Dark reflections is spread in my mind
Sometimes it's easier to be blind 

I have some dreams and violent scenes
From the visions that I've seen
I can't control myself asleep
At night they fight inside my head 

Now it's time to live and forget
The drearied dreams I have in my back 

Leaving the dreams far behind
Forget the past and erase my mind
So leave it all behind
Leaving the dreams far behind
Before I am confined to this mind
So leave it all behind 

I have to cease to think about the scenes
Please set me free,
To be excused from all of the dreams 

There is a war... 

Dark reflections... 

Leaving the dreams far behind...
