[Music: J. Johansson / Lyrics: M. Savenhed]

Lying in my bed one night
Holding someone tight
When morning hour came, waking up alone
Was it an imagination
Or was it for real
Don't really care, `cause she's my dream 

Fire and ice
Just an illusion and a dream
Fire and ice
Just a dream that doesn't really exist 

Her body's like a flame
Her eyes was cold as ice
So wonderful but not able to touch
I want her to be with me
What a crazy dream
What's wrong with believing and have a fate? 

Fire and ice
Just an illusion and a dream
Fire and ice
We will never meet again 

Yes, she's just a dream
I know she's not for real
No, she's too real
Too real to be just a fantasy 

Fire and ice
Just an illusion and a dream
Fire and ice
We will never meet again
Fire and ice
She burns like fire
Fire and ice
Can't fight my desire
Fire and ice [2 times]
