[Music: J. Johansson / Lyrics: J. Johansson]

Arouse thy crew
In sense of frustration
Our dragonships are near
Run up the sails
To avoid destruction
Thy time has come, We're here!

Face to face, thy destiny
We've lit all the torches
And shortly you will be...

Baptized in fire
Baptized in fire
With a violent rage

We hail thy ships
To strike with fire
Soon the bodies comes to burn
We'll never cease
Before you're gone into
The sea without return

Face to face, thy destiny
The battle is over
And you're the one to be...

Baptized in fire...
