Fire through the landscape
No muscle power anymore
Automatic weapons
They took over control

They enter our countries
In this everlasting war
Survival's for the fittest
And the weak will fall

It takes us by surprise
Never cross its way
I hear it from a hundred miles away
They try to kill us all
With their digital machines
We know to death we must obey

It's marching over you and me
Made for destructive purposes
Automatic artillery

Look before you leap
Don't let all bodies creep
Why did they have
To take us by surprise
Dirty evil practices
Rips us out of our sleep
Let them know with this
We won't suffice

We got no way to go
It comes from everywhere
Lethal weapons mean to harm us all
Our anguish leads to cold sweat
We are waiting for the end
What on earth will cause
These engines' fall
