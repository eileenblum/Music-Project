She is the lady
The star of the scene
The world claims to know her
And so it seems
He is the man, the top of the bill
We know how they live until night
Better still

Forced by addiction
She tightens and strips
Tension meets torment
Down comes the whip
Excitement exploding
Their thoughts fade to black
In fact it's disgusting
But there's no way back

She's above torturing his dick
Is it for love or is it just the kick
His threshold shifts
On another kind of leather
Brain desire for pain instead of pleasure

She makes him shout
He's tight up to the bed
The screams get louder
When blood meets sweat
Compare with the first time
When she felt so strange
The lashes are credit
To her bestial change
Isn't it so that we're all the same
They are not wrong
The mind is to blame
We mix up excitement
Incitement and fear
Before we all realize
The next step is near

She's above torturing his dick
Is it for love or is it just the kick
His threshold shifts
On another kind of leather
Brain desire for pain instead of pleasure

His threshold shifts
On another kind of leather
Brain desire for pain instead of pleasure
His threshold shifts
On another kind of leather
Brain desire for pain instead of pleasure

She's above torturing his dick
Is it for love or is it just the kick
His threshold shifts
On another kind of leather
Brain desire for pain instead of pleasure
