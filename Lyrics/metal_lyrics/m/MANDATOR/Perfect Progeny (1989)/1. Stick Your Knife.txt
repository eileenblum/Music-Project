We inherit with our birth
A struggle for existence
Poverty, reality do or die
Until now you have ruled
But one day you'll listen
You squeezed us
Now no longer we can supply

The roots of your kind of men
Lies in the past
No big deal all is real
Depression is their fashion
Lack of cash you never had
Your life went too fast
The day will come
We will reveal our state of regression

You stick your knife
Our blood is your life

I want to see your body torn
Teach your beloved to mourn
Your wrong makes us strong
We were taught to survive
Any spark can light the fire
That will change the score
Then you'll pray outliving the day
When hatred comes alive

You stick your knife
Our gore is your life

You think that we are parasites
And we're a dangerous sort
Neglecting us, rejecting us
Condemnation
But have you realized
It's you we do support
Isn't it time for you to see
We are the nation

Wipe out the past
And start again from zero
With us you will conclude
That money was your hero
Wipe out the past
And start again from zero
With us you will conclude
That money was your hero

Poverty, reality
Poverty, reality, do or die
