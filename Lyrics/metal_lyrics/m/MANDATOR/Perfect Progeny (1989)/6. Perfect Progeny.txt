Create my clone from cell to bone
Improve my feeble brain
Superhumanize my thoughts
Exclude my skin from pain
We're making progress on the quest
Hereditary codes are made
We link in ways we think are best
Notice the shade

Make your wish
We serve your dish
The common human being's
To become a revelation
Let our descendants
Be reflections of our own
With perfect senses of accommodation
But have we considered
Our creations new relations
Watch out, beware
Let us think about
Environmental situations
Look out, take care

Change my deoxyribonucleic acid
Manipulate 'till perfect progeny

We can't make a better future
Perfection's not what we will face
We might create deterrent killers
We threaten our own race

Change my deoxyribonucleic acid
Manipulate 'till perfect progeny
