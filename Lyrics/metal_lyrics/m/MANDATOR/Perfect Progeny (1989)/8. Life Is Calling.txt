Let me fall, let me feel
Only anti gravity
Is the force able to
Stop me from the fact I'm falling
The crowd awaits my final dive
Come and gathered 'round to see
My lifeless flesh, my bones and blood
And hear my choking scream

Besides the fact, you leaving me
There's another thing you see
To endless stairs it's leading me
Outraging curiosity
What will it be, to fall down
From Empire State tonight
Undo myself, from my life
Sense terror, fear and fright

You are not the reason for
Or inducement to my deed
I guess what counts for me
Is the fall that is what I need

All my life I was curious
What attracts the falling cat
Dropping down from heights
Knowing there is no way back

Let me drop down

If I were just that cat
I'd have endless times to feel
Risk my life, until death
Why isn't this for real
