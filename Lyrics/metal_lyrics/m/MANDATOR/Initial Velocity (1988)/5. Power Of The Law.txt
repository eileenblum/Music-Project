Crime and destruction where you lock
Lives of innocents is what they took
Messengers of death, they warn you of hell
If you fight back they lock you in a cell

Darkness is falling after sunrise
Black clouds of smoke fill the air
The old world it finally dies
You better watch out, beware

[CHORUS]

Power of the law
No justice in times of war
Power of the law
Fire power in this evil time
Peace is weakness to destroy
People earn money with murder and crime
This power can't be avoid
We were sent to saw starvation
They gave us weapons made to kill
They gave no further information
Death hides behind every hill

[SOLO 1]

[repeat CHORUS]

[SOLO 2]

[repeat CHORUS]
