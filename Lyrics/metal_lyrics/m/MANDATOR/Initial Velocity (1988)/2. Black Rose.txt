It was dark and I was waiting
Some wolves were howling and it was full moon
Suddenly a total silence
I knew it had to happen soon

I was lonely out there
waiting for my messenger
He was about to bring me the Black Rose
I knew he would be coming soon
'cause thunderclouds were passing by
and flashing lights were blinding my eyes

There he stood in front of me
The men for whom I had been waiting long
In his left hand the Black Rose
The most powerful flower

Ancient words of evil times
spoken by the messenger
made this sacred flower shine bright
I could feel it's magic touch
It gave me strength, but far too much
and then I felt it couldn't be right

[CHORUS]
The Black Rose, the Black Rose, the Black Rose
is coming out to get you
The Black Rose, the Black Rose, the Black Rose
is coming out to get you

[SOLO 1]

[repeat CHORUS]

The messenger, he spoke out his curse
The demons power, i felt it strong
The Black Rose was credit to all this
in the hands of a devils son
A terrible disaster had just begun
The Black Roses revenge was cruel
A new age began with this flower
This rose was a destructive tool
The sun was covered by clouds
The moon now forever shines
An evil century made it's entry
We'd better dig our graves, to die
