ADVANCED
In a long gone century
the Huns rode across the land
Their terror was notorious
all over the world

Attila was their king
a fabulous destructor, my friend
When he went to war
things turned in to dirt

They only saw his shadow
they felt he was in their neighbourhood
Attila, creator of
blood, tears and pain

His wrath harmed them all
their heads had to roll
Blood and sweat fell down
like rain

BATTLE
Homicide            Pangs of death in their eyes
Agony            For well-considered death
Death-sweat      For the undertakers men
Final rest            Prepare for your last breath
