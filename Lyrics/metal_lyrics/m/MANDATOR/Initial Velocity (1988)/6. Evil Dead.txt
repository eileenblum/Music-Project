FEAR
The eyes, they can not fear me
The voice just passes me by
As far as I can see
The only thing I fear is the sigh

The sigh of endless weariness
It fills the room with air
A smell of rotten lungs
and badly groomed long hair

ENTRANCE
Together they form a vortex
turning loose the brains in my head
The sigh predicts the changing hour
the hour of the Evil Dead
I wish I'd never opened up the door
the door of fear
It's too late to flee now
The ripping claws are near

FORCE
I try to hold my breath
but then the smell reaches my lungs
I feel disgusting fluid
Acid touches my tongue
I faint and fall to the ground
prepare myself for dying
The pressure on my body
forces me to act of lying

SOLD
Why did you disturb us from our sleep
I didn't mean to wake you this way
Try to understand we lain here to creep
I know but I am born to obey
Why didn't you let our bodies sleep
Curious as I am I will stay
Why can't you let us lie in the deep
I tried but I am sent here to pay
Why did you disturb us from our sleep
I never meant to wake you today

RECONSIDERATION
Long ago I felt the urge of returning
Curiosity inside my heart was burning
I don't think my nerves can stand this again
The Evil Dead now it's a warning
No I don't think my body can stand this again
The Evil Dead surely it's a warning

And the legend stays........
