The terrible anguish, the ultimate fear
It's all here to drive you insane
You sit in the chair and wait 'till they're there
to push it, the button of pain

Feeling the tension in every way
Electrical sparks through you head
On one side the sadist deciding the moment
You think of your life and then change it,
your face into dead
Faces of death

THE ROPE
The horrible terror, the dreadful fright
It's leading you through the night
You stand on the trap-door and wait 'till they pull
the handle, death on your side

Feeling the tension in every way
The rope, it is squeezing your neck
On one side the sadist deciding the moment
You think of your life and then change it,
your face into dead

THE CAUSE
Your mind was ruled by beasts who forced you
to end up the life of your friends
Your wife was true before she divorced you
You'll never make love again

THE CHASE
One after one women got raped
They wanted the raper in jail
All of a sudden people got killed
The murderer, he left no trail
Dogs were involved to get this case solved
and end up this madhouse of death
Someone got caught, a link we thought
Feelings of hate in our heads
Go

THE CHOICE
You were a fool, a useless tool
You were a user of dope

We finally found you, cops did surround you
Killing would be too fair
Now you can choose, you always will loose
It's the rope or else the chair

[SOLO]

You think of your life and then change it,
your face into dead
Faces of death
Phases of death
