DEPARTURE
You've said it
right into my face
You've stated it
all too clear
Consider the consequences
as you're leaving me

You think that you can handle this world
and imagine you're everybody's girl
But have in mind my psycho-past
I was your first one and will be your last

DECISION
You've said it
without any shame
You used me
day by day
Use your common sense now
and decide to stay

You think that you can change my world
Don't reject my warning girl
Think of what I did in the past
I was your first one and will be your last

CONSIDERATION
Regret it
before I decide
Believe me
I never lie
Whatever you do, my honey
Don't let it get to a fight

I want you to be happy when I please
Be grateful, while you're still in one piece
Answer to my straight demands
I was your first one and will be your last

REVENGE
I'll tear your heart out, eat your liver
Dissect you piece by piece
I'll cut your flesh to TV-snacks
and serve it with the cheese

I'll tear your lungs out, one by one
and fill them with your guts
But first I'll make you suck your feet
and chew them with your cunt

[SOLO]
