It's hard to be with you, it twists me up inside
I didn't want it, but I couldn't get away
I really get, what I really don't want
I pull myself together, what the fuck do you expect

Bind me grinds me keeps me down
So hard to deal with the ones who aren't real
So hard to deal with the ones who can't feel
Day by day you blow my mind away

It's hard to be with you, it twists me up inside...

Binds me grinds me keeps me down...

Who the hell you calling crazy, what the hell is going on
It's the same old conversation, is it all the same to you?
You can call me what you will, you just talking shit
You are a living horror trip, I suffer a private death

I think I've lost a lot
But I haven't lost my self respect at all
Self respect!!!

I think I've lost a lot
But I haven't lost my self respect at all
Self respect!!!
