Stay for now, stay for the day
Stay to think and start again
Ignite your will and let it all out
Ignite the rules, it's never too late

How many times have you wanted to be straight
How many times?
How many times have you wanted to stay clean
How many times?

Do it for free, scratch it all down
Go to act and kick 'em again
Is it the fear of the lie or the shame in the truth
Better to die on your feet, as to live on ya knees

How many times have you wanted to be straight
How many times?
How many times have you wanted to stay clean
How many times?

You know how this world beats you down
And I tell you no one really cares
You know how this world beats you down
Let me hear you say - I ain't mad at all!

...the daily grind!!!
