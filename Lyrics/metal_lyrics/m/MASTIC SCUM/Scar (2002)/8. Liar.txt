Hey, hey baby
What have you done last night?
You know, you are my sweet little tender lady
But why you are always looking for the guy next door?
...I'm horny

I'm a liar - feel my desire - I'm a liar - my heart's on fire

So drop to your knees and tell me what you think
The dick slides up and in &amp; out your face
What a brand new beat! My baby how does it taste?

Boogie woogie you set my hard cock on fire
Girl I love you - you know I am a liar
I whip out my piece and spurt sperm on your face

So let me suck your cold naked skin
I bit in your clitoris
It doesn't matter if it tastes bitter
A dirty job, but the liar keeps the cunt on fire

I practice what I preach - I practice what I preach

So drop to your knees...
