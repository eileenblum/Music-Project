Don't you see what you have done
You don't care how many die
You haven't learn anything with sense
Hey enemy tell me what you want to be
You drag yourself down, too sick to get up
You don't care Mr. Self Destruct
Tell me how it works - this way will never end

Do you hear? - Do you see? - Do you feel? - Do you kill?

All the statements you have made
All the shit that you create
Human error can't escape
Reality is fate in dread you wait
See what's going on and recognize
Take a look down deep inside
Than you hate that - hate that
Than you hate that - hate that

Do you hear? - Do you see? - Do you feel? - Do you kill?
Do you hear? - Do you see? - Do you feel? - So what the fuck?!

All the statements you have made
All the shit that you create
Human error can't escape
Reality is fate in dread you wait
See what's going on and recognize
Take a look down deep inside
Than you hate that - hate that
Than you hate that - hate that

Do you hear? - Do you see? - Do you feel? - Do you kill?
