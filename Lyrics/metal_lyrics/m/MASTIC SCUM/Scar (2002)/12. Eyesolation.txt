The macabre, the macabre perplex
It perforate the time, an incessant game

Anthrax - ant...ant...ant - anthrax - ant...ant

The corpus, the corpus is ill
Spreading of diseases, cause of human hate

Anthrax - ant...ant...ant - anthrax - ant...ant

The search for the poison has started
No way forward and no way back
Confusion is growing - out of control
No time to waste - no time to waste

Mental enslavement - totally disorder
Bringing death closer than before
Sickness is growing - the tax pay the war
No one is safe - no one is safe

Anthrax - ant..ant...ant - anthrax - ant...ant
