Through my soul
Like to stay for my own
Desire so deranged
Like to lose control
I'm the first not the last one
I've taken it all, cant' take it anymore
Who will live forever
When madness is coming your way

Through my soul...
Die - now - why?
Die - now - why?

I feel a panic like my spirit has died
Confusion brings mentally deranged
When I'm free - I'm never free - it sucks the daily misery
Everything thought I have - it's just fucking me
Free thinking in a fucked up world
The pain inside is taking over - is taking over again

it's not enough!!!
To die is not enough!!!
