The rule of mankind, it's just a big game
If you don't follow the order, you will only be banished
A human race, with profit thoughts and no dreams
There are no helping hands for - those who left this way
The rule of mankind, it's just a big game
Eye for an eye, no one else is looking or cares
A human race, with profit thoughts and no dreams
Free yourself from the illusion, the new day is here

Face to face - face to face - you and me
Face to face - face to face - or let it fuckin' be

Perfect extension, it runs on and on
It looks like nothing, so much as a cancer
Profit and greed - a course of regression in a perfect shape
The modern vision of living, the new stage of human waste
A human race with profit thoughts and no dreams
Free yourself from the illusion, the new day is here

Face to face - face to face - you and me
Face to face - face to face - or let it fuckin' be

A world of rape and honest
Corruption and abuse
A life with drugs and rock 'n roll
Perfect living in a perfect world
I don't know how to act
So think about this fuckin' fact

Hello work, hello pain - nice to feel you back again
Hello silence, hello pain - nice to feel you back again

A world of rape and honest...

Face to face - face to face - you and me
Face to face - face to face - or let it fuckin' be

The rule of mankind, it's just a big game
If you don't follow the order, you will only be banished
Wounding the ego, willing to face the pain
Free yourself from the illusion, the new breed is here
One single kill, the blind will lead the walk
Free yourself from the illusion, the new breed is here
