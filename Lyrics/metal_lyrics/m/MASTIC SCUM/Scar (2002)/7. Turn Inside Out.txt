A reason is a right to hate
I belong to only me
Its hard to stay between the lines
I'm still building on a dream
I held the hand of the Devil
I'm still burning in time
Cry without weeping - scream without speaking
Cold as stone and hot as Hell

Burn - inside - burn

Turn inside out
I burn inside
Turn inside out
Outside

I broke all bounds and chains
I was running to stand still
I still run away from myself
The day has come and gone
There's nothing else left to win
There's nothing else left to lose
The lines are short - the bottle runs dry
I spoke with the tongue of the Devil

Burn - inside - burn

Turn inside out
I burn inside
Turn inside out
Outside

I hate everyone equally
I reject this fuckin' run
Cast down and fade away
But life still goes on
In a world that feeds on shit
In a world that feeds on cash
Time runs quick - need to control
Every single - every endless day
