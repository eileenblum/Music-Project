Riot minds, confused beings
Paranoid thoughts, a concealed chaos
Distorted words, surround my head
Muddle-headed-fellow, just shit on and on

Regression!!!
...time marches on
Regression!!!
...time has come to reap

Regression!!!
...time marches on
Regression!!!
...time has come to reap

The time has come to act
The clock is ticking on and on
I don't need your helping hand
I can make my own stand
To perform on my intentions
The rebirth of my deliverances
Living in the real world
Living in progression

Progression!!!
...time marches on
Progression!!!
...time has come to reap
