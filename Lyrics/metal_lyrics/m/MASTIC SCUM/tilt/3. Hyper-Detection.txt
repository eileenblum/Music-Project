Everywhere the suffer, global depression around
Innerself it's frozen, no one cares
There's vision downfall, can see it clear
There's violence jumping, no one cares

Everywhere the same, human attacks nature
Slowly lunacy, no one cares
There's healthy life, and it also is real
There's the ignorance, no one cares

Pain is moving, feelings broken
Conflict turning, suffer till end
Hyper detection

The world is gone, global confusion
No freedom to choice, hyper detection

Sometimes, will it end?
Sometimes, will it fade?

The death starts to dance, the grind-nightmare is back
Memories-explosions, the language of the mad

The world is gone...
