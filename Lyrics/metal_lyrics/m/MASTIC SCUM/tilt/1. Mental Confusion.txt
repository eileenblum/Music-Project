I walk through my misery
A prisoner of myself
Feeling deadly the scorn of the crowd
I won't follow the rules of society
I just feel agony

I can't understand what's going on
To suffer alone in disgrace
Is that all what happens with me?
I'm the only witness of my torment

Out of mind - my mindsnare
Out of mind - my mindsnare

Depression linger, life is a lie

I don't want to see, the trust falling down
I don't want to hear, the lies are told around
I don't want to feel, the pain and the abuse
I don't want to say, that I'm confused?!

Open your eyes - mental confusion
Lost all trust - mental confusion
There's no help - mental confusion

I can't understand...
