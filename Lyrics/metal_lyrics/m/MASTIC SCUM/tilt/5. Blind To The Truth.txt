My world so down, depression drips I feel
Sink in blind dreams, strange vision no truth
Innerself destruct, I have lost my way
Innerself desolate, I have lost my spirit

Disaster alone with myself
Disaster it gets down with myself

Don't lose your steps, open your mind
Don't lose your steps, open your mind

But there's no light, just burning souls
There's no shine, body - self - attack
My personal fall, how the suffer on Earth
Headache from a pill, my power will go quick

This dream is so real, life fades away
Blind to the truth
Taste a terror snack, slave to the power of death
Blind to the truth...
