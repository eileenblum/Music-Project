Brain slam, brain slam, brain slam,...

The sickness of the father, runs on through the son
His excessive drug consume, only causes him to spit
The truth is: He's happier, when he is in pain

Brain slam, brain slam, brain slam,...

His girlfriend left him for that shit-guy next door
He's sick of it all, and scum flies through his brain
The own frustration, don't let him out
His fucked senses, slowly stripped away

Well, one thing is certainly true
He doesn't know what to do
How can he tell a good act from a bad
He get sucked all night long

Suicide illusions torment his thoughts
His own frustration, don't let him out
His poor existence fades slow away
