The machine is dead, fuck that human being
Out of organism
No circulation in these sticky veins

Out of natural living, out of Hell on Earth
Out of natural living, out of medical terror

Scum, new life is starting, finished with real world
Just scream and scuff
Is it an illusion, or is it a real fact
Ha! It's confusion!

So disgust!

That's the way to ignore life
Where's the way to cut that part
Some new experiences, getting on with me
In my own Hell I will see...

Out of natural living...
