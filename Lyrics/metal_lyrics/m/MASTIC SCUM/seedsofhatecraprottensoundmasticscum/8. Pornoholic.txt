[performed by Mastic Scum]So come on Kate my lovely wife
The time is right - the spotlight is on
My heartbeat is bumping like a 909
Kate, take off my shirt - what's on my back? Dirt
I am the bloody bastard - fantasma
I take a drink of your fuckin' orgasm
But I ain't a vamp, I ain't a killer
I'm just your private stripping thriller

Drill me - thrill me - kiss me - kill me

So what's up Kate? You're ready for a funky fuck
Deep and hard - gimme a pussy-fart
Oh yeah - this is me in top of you
So now I can recall "who is who"
You need to love me but you kick me out
Amazing the sensation we're always get about
i want it bad and I want it awesome now
Oh can you see, my baby, this is sexy hc - wow!

Sleepless dreams in a bed of faith
Talk a little bit about your revelation
My dick is shaking like a 909
But you just love me for my sex addiction
Your love is very sadistic
I know you dominate our kind of relation
But you ain't a vamp, you ain't a killer
You're just my private stripping thriller

Drill me - thrill me - kiss me - kill me
