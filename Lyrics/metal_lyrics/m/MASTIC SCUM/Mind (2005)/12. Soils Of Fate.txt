Conflicts and terror, violence and rape, obey the command
Life full of hatred, violence is instinct, content through ignorance
Try to grow, fuck your pride, so weak in your mind
Made of plastic wrap, to see right through, to check ya wasted time

Soils of fate? Or just your fuckin' pride?
Soils of fate? No strain for you to hide

Isolation concept, no church and cross, to confuse the mind
Breeding product, mathematic matters - numbers
Fanatic nations, create a new war, a war in name of God
Thousand diseases, humans die, a colony of maggots

Souls of fate? Or just your fuckin' pride
Soils of fate - no strain for you to hide

As love dies, the pain just grows, and the sickness runs
Weak-headed souls, you the product, do you even care
Another moment, change their mind, hide behind fake
Hearts are black, filled with hate, lost soils of fate?

Soils of fate? Or just your live
Soils of fate? No strain to hide
Soils of fate - or just your fuckin' pride
