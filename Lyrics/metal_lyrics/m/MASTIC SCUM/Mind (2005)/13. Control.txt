Too much things around
Too much things impossible to criticize
Trying to erase the past
Erase the past and move ahead
To escape from the daily grind
Everyday another compromise
To get beyond control? To retain control?
...and to defy

Control
Control
Control
Control

Clear my thoughts from strain
Searching for the right source
Like going further down the drain
Sometimes I'm going out of mind
Maybe it's not worth?
Not worth the anger that I spent?
Anger and trouble, to hate and to curse
...and to defy

Control
Control
Control
Control

Hate to course, beyond control
Fear my thoughts, to defy control
Hate to course! Beyond control!
Hate to course, beyond control
Fear my thoughts, to defy control
Hate to course! Beyond control!
Hate to course, beyond control
Fear my thoughts, to defy control

I'm gonna ride on my addiction tide
Doing time on my toasted mind
The more I will do, the less I will get
33 years of lies and confusion
Time is the perfect illusion
To hold on to, cause we're through
...and to defy
Control...
