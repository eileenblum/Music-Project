Dark souls, shining people
Tremendously insane
Humans dead and diseased
Innocents died in vain
Lost in flesh and lost in blood
Destruction is what they pay

...in vain

Internal application
Blood and sacrifice
Feelings should be shared
Are just held inside
Senseless violence all around
No order and no devise
No way for compromise!

...in vain

Tossed away like shit
Believe in for a price
Moralities thrown away
The race lives for a lie
...in vain
