Cries of hate - for vengeance?
Control the sense - obey?
No escape - from madness?
Mute and gain - away?

Strain your strength, feed your mind
Suppress your fear, unrestrained

Lies of shit - impression?
Curse to your - embrace?
In dread we wait - immortal?
Destroy the wall - of hate?

Strain your strength, feed your mind
Suppress your fear, unrestrained
...don't judge me
Before your-fuckin-self

rise above, of suppression
Face the fact, new way
Tear apart, of salvation
New born unrestrained!!

Strain your strength, feed your mind
Suppress your fear, unrestrained

Unbound from existence
From enslavement to demolition
Recycled from tradition
You gonna take control
