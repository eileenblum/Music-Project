The truth we choose
Armageddon from inside
Greed of mankind
No toleration for a lie
To serve purpose
No regret of inner pride

No life?
No temptation?
No lines?
No intentions?

Confuse the truth
Remaining mute and gain
The final raid
Becoming closer every day
Bleeding heart
A shape of a new born pain

No life?...

The choice control, I don't wanna die
Prejudice with no belief
Gain one's end, I don't wanna be
I spit myself a final kiss

No life?...

The choice control
Defining birth of tension
To gain one's end
To Hell with good intentions
To Hell with good intentions
To Hell with good intentions
To Hell with good intentions
I spit myself a final kiss
