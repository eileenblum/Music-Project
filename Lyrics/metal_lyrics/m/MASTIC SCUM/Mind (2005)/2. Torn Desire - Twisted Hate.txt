Welcome to a world of pain
Desire to kill the urge
To face a wall of hatred and scorn
The insane society
Beautiful is fucking ugly
And loneliness is fucked up pure
I hate to love, I love to hate
To hate the twisted truth

Always try to find your way
Torn desire - twisted hate

Dark reflections, degeneration
Enslaved now to the grind
Insane from all the crap around
Way too much to hide
To answer the purposes
Rushed into my mind
I hate to love, I love to hate
To hate the turn desire

...another relation
...another mind
...too many answers
...too many lies

Always try to find your way
Torn desire - twisted hate
Always try to find your way
Torn desire - twisted hate

Count the scars in your heart
There is nothing left to waste
No way out and no reason to wait
Torn desire - twisted hate

...another relation
...anther mind
...too many answers
...too many lies
...to find your line
...to find your way
...torn desire
Twisted with hate!
