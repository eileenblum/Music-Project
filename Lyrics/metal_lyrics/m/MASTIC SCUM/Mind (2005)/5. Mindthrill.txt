Movement of the levers, progression of the drain
Another bright sunrise gone
Another limb broke from the chain
Eyes afraid of life, and eyes afraid of death
The grueling circle of daily grind
Controls your mind and breath

Time fades away
So keep your mind controlled
Your life fades away?
Mindthrill - mindthrill

Present moments fading, pleasure and pain pass by
Can you feel this?
Transaction of the course, another day of compromise
Can you feel this?
Hearts are bleeding dark, souls are burning fast
Can you feel this?
The works of art painted black, no passion to be left

Time fades away...

Eyes afraid of life, and eyes afraid of death
Clock keeps running, world keeps turning
Control your mind and breath

Control the future - control the past
Impact your mind - all hope dies last
