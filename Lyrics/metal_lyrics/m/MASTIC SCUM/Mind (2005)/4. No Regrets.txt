Everything feels wrong inside
Like nothing else before
And baby don't waste my time
It's time to let it all go
What the hell am I doin' here
Break my heart then I can start
It's time to smack my bitch up and you belong to me

No regrets!!
No regrets!!

Burn me out leave the other side
You're killing me again
So now we're none and time grows older I've grown colder
I lost again once again - I don't know where to start
I don't have the will to fight, but here it comes again

No regrets!!
No regrets!!

Broken, grieved, crestfallen - shaken to the core
Shocked, despair, hopeless - I feel no remorse

I feel no harm and sorry, I keep my faith alive
I let all regrets left behind, I learn from your demise...

No regrets!!
No regrets!!
No regrets!!
No regrets!!
