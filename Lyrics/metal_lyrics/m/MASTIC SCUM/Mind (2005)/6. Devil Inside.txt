Sounds of silence, God's kill insight
My mere existence, resume the simple killing fight
Crawling fast and breaking out
Yeah won't come and hurt me, I can taste your fear

Feel the power
And see the signs
Fight for dissension, hate narrow minds
Fight the effect and observe the line
Destroy the cause - the Devil inside ...inside!!

Sounds of sickness, against the vile
Covering the truth again, all the memories are drained
Causing pain is so divine, confusion comes so easily
Yeah won't to come to kill me, without fear and no regrets

Feel the power...

Follow up, the straight-lined sight
Destroy the cause - the Devil inside!!

Sounds of murder, it tastes so light
Look on your face, frustration leads to demise
Shallow persons hollow you, all the memories like a misery
Yeah won't you come to punch me, I can taste your fear

Feel the power...
