The scope of progression
Further down the drain
Divine human error
Spreading out in vain
Trust your soul, trust your style
Trust your fucking live
Trust your thoughts, trust your views
Trust your fucking mind

...trust your mind ... trust your mind

Take all the pressures
Taste the poison of hate
The valley of darkness
The curse of darkness
The curse of your fate
Trust your soul, trust your style
Trust your fucking live
Trust your thoughts, trust your views
Trust your fucking mind

...trust your mind! ... trust your mind!

If wrong gets right
And if 6 was 9
Destroy all cares
Because my minds mine
If black gets white
And if Hell divine
Destroy all bloody cares
Because my minds mine

...crawling minds insane
...bleeding clever brain
...cheating by the game
...breeding makes the same
...further down the drain
...in vain

If wrong gets right...

My minds mine
My minds mine
My minds mine
My minds mine
