A violent fit of temper
To vent someone's anger
To hold a grudge against
Envy of everything?

Don't believe what you believe
Slaves to the world we built
A reason for existence
If you can afford the price

Crawl

The human race lives for a lie
The end justify the means
Believe in something for a price
To escape the daily pain

All the trendy is a clichÃ©
Don't get the things that we convey
Not listening what's behind it all, envy of everything
Don't want to hear the message, the opposite is the truth
They are all breaking ground
Bringing the revolution next round

Don't believe what you believe
Slaves to the world we built
Reason for existence
If you can afford the price

Crawl

The human race lives for a lie the end justifies the means
Believe in something for a price, to escape the daily pain
All the trendy is a clichÃ©, don't get the things that we convey
Not listening what's behind it all, but words hurt the most
