Exchange the wrath
To mechanized hate
Controlled mind
Executing fate
All life within pain
In obsolete truth
Controlled, mankind
A rising within?

I rise ... The new industry ... I rise
The vortex within

Constructed hate
Of nonhuman face
Mindkilling sight
Devastating race
All world without pain
In uprising truth
Controlled, system
A falling within?
... Shut down!

Mankind! Downfall! No more regrets!
Mankind ... Is falling
Downfall ... And drowning
Structure ... Degrading
Killing ... And no more ... Regrets!

... I rise
The vortex within

Contront, facing, corrupt, system!
Contront, reaching, beyond, control!
Contront, facing, corrupt, system!
Contront, reaching, beyond, control!

I rise till you fall
I rise till you fall
