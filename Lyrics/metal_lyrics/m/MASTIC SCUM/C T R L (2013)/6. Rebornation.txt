Reborn from a system, along the line
A sacrifice of life, the breath of time
Numbers decrease, against the grain
Reborn again, the daily grind!

A rebornation - of terrorside
A rebornation - of chaoside

Future breed, the new machine, regained
False humanity, the masterplan
The final sign, the final lie!

Resign of life - resign of life

Self-contained, against the grain, resigned
Rise above humanity, the final lie!

Resign of life - resign of life

Disappear in my mind - Disappear in my mind
Disappear in my mind - Disappear in my mind

I'm going insane, visions crawling away
I'm feeling no pain, breathing, to abstain
I'm going insane, being a part of a game
I'm feeling no pain, future, what will remain?

Reborn from the ashes, cut the line
A sacrifice for death, the scare of time
Numbers decrease, against the grain
Reborn denied, the daily grind!

A rebornation - of terrorside
A rebornation - of chaoside

...Born from chaos!
