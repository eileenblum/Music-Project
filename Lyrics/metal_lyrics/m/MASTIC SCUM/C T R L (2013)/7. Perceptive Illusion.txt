A world full of scum, out of control, time reverse
Feeling below, the way we flow, lost in weakness
Deaf to hear, weak to feel, blind to see
The missing link, the way to think, life in sickness

Take it up, bring it down
All the hope dies last at all

Confrontations - disillusion
Confrontations
Perceptive Illusion

A world full of hate, out of control, time reverse
Feeling below, the way we flow, lost in weakness
Deaf to hear, weak to feel, blind to see
The binding link, the way to think, life in sickness

Take it up, bring it down
All the hope dies last at all

Dehumanized bodies - all I see
Dehumanized senses - all I feel

We cannot stop the human race, to stop for whose sake?
We cannot stop this human plague, the irony of fate!
