Erased future, exchanging your faith
Losing all vision, eliminating your trace

Thoughts eraced, end of line
Lose control, a deadly sign
Realized, paralyzed
Dehumanized, process!

Destroyed all visions, dehumanizing your wrath
Losing all future, executing your breath

Thoughts eraced, end of line
Lose control, a deadly sign
Realized, paralyzed
Dehumanized, process!

Future of man, machine erased
Future of man, disgrace
Future of man, machine erased
Future of man...
Disembodiment

Changing - visions - inhuman - process!
Changing - visions - dehumanized - fate!

Changing - visions - inhuman - process!

Future of man, machine erased
Future of man, disgrace
Future of man, machine erased
Future of man...
Disembodiment
