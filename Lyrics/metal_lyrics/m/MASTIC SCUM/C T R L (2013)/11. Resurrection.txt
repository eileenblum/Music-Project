Condemning falling nations
A way with no return
Conquest, war, famine and death
The nemesis on earth

End of revelation
Return to level zero
Re-programmed in a circle
Reflecting mirror

Injustice dying world
Fall of civilization
Result of the humanity
A rising resurrection!

Enclosed in the conviction
Death will be deliverance
Aspects of tribulation
Rising from the dead

World downfall, suffocation
Absence of humanity
Suffering our minds
Conclusions of identity!

Resurrection
Resurrection

Revive all your faith
Revive void within
Revive once again

Resurrection
Resurrection
