Brainwashed and blind, society to serve
Fall into their trap, they want you to believe
Sorrow, suffer, pain, you got what you deserve?

Creation - invading your life
Negation - a worldwide suicide

Mankind enslaved, defiance and defeat
War in the name of God, a machine takes the lead
Prisoners to this system, a war of wealth and greed

Creation - invading your life
Negation - a worldwide suicide

Warheads crushing earth
Worldpeace dream is gone
The sky you see it fall
Disease like new born

Endless falling nations
Deadmen preaching pride
Survival day by day
A world to face the end

Humans leading power
Force war to the weak
The terror in their mind
Leads system to the wrath

Fortress control, one-way to misery
Giving their last breath, die blinded by their greed
Terror, death, war, a world with no belief

Creation - invading your life
Negation - a worldwide suicide
