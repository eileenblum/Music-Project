... Brute force controls your mind!
Streamline leads to madness, everything fades away
Inhuman mind program, pounding nerves decay
They control your life, they control your mind!

Increased by tension, affected by their lies
We're following the leader, we're following to die!

Brute Force Mothode
Breaking down human codes
Brute Force Methode
Breaking down those human minds

The machines rise ... got left behind
The truth will die ... cause they control your mind!

Enclosed in a white room, feeling insane
Programmed mindcrash, parameters overgained
Slow death to prevail, off the line
Controlled by lies, controlled by million lies!

Entrapped in madness, feeling insane
Re-programmed mindcrash, parameters overgained
Mindcrash to prevail, off the line
One million lies, one million lies to die! ... to die!!
