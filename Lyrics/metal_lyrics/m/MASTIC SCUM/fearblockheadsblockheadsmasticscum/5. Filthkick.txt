[performed by Mastic Scum]Can't you see this fuckin' bastards
Distrust and abuse of human scum
I can't stand this needless fuckers
Fuck that way - that fucking shit

I don't need your fucking shit
Get off - you are so fucking sick!

I don't need your bullshit stories
Fuckin' lies and shit as well
Don't make a fuss - you bloody fool
Take your shit and go to Hell
