You try another line, to help you get away
Take what you can, to damage the fuckin' day
You know it really well
You can't win a self-destruct game
You don't know who you are
Are you addicted to cocaine?

You think your way rough, you think you're out of luck
You think "I wanna get high"
You wanna get high as the sky
That's why you take what you can
To damage the fuckin' day, to damage the fuckin' day!

Overdose....!  Overdose....!

Living dead man, do what you can
You can't kill yourself, you are already dead

You try another line, to help you get away
Take what you can, to damage the fuckin' day
You know it really well
You can't win a self-destruct game
You don't know who you are
Are you addicted to cocaine?

You think your way is tough you can't get enough.
You think "I wanna get high"
I wanna get high as the sky
Next time you'll take more
And they'll find you dead, on the bloody floor.
