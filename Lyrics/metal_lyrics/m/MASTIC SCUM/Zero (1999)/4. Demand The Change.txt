The machine cranks out, turns off the ignition,
it can't hold the line
Daily terror, cause "lady spirit",
asking for change
One step back and two to go,
to control the mind
I wanna drop out, demand the change,
to live my life.

Demand the change, demand the change for live.

The machine cranks out, ...

Demand the change, demand the change or die.

The time have passed, the intelect runs back,
rewind the past.
Face the truth - control the mind.
Demand the change

The change to control?
The change to consume?
the change to dependence?

Demand the change...
