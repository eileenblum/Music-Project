No remorse - no remorse

The way we go, ignoring who
Ignoring who, we're giving cash to
The work we do, destruction who
Destructing who, we're giving respect to

Have we lost our intelect, to greed's control
Is this corrupt system, grinding our souls?
Have we lost our independent, to government's control
Is this confuse system, killing our souls?

Yes we have the power - to break away
Or should we stay - in a kind of slavery
In a kind of slavery - in a kind of slavery
In a kind of slavery!!!
