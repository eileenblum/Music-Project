A vision of death - a vision of life
In my vicious dreams.
And a thing - I don't know
Is it reality or fantasy?

I cannot explain this fucked-up mind
It's just a big thrill.
And I wonder how -
And I think so what!

So what?!

What in the world?!

Return to the real, the reality in me.
No one can't be, ready for life.
The quality in life, is alive in me!
I think for a minute, so what!

So what, so what, so what.
