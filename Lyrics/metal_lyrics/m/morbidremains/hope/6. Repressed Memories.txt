You opened my eyes to a better world without hate or bitterness
You show me what happiness really is but like a fool I let you go.
I see you, with the life I wish I had all I can do is close my eyes
You bring me to where I have never been a whole new world where only joy remains

You survive I suffer you can bring me to my knees
You are the only one that has the spark to ignite the flame
Your eyes bring out my lies in a whole new world not mine
Seek forth through skies to find the reasons why
Why must you be so blind cannot you see that you are mine
Through the lies my mind subsides and then you will realise
