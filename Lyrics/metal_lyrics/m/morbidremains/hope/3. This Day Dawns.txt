As the sun sets on darkness on the darkest day
It reveals to me all the shadows of mercy
All I ever needed was a like to overpower
All I ever received was nothing was nothing

This day it dawns and that is when the rain it falls again
As the day dawns all the sorrow seems to disappear
This is the start of a new life
