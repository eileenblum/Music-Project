Wake up
As you constrict him by all of these chains
As you hide behind this curtain of shame
Pray to the skies that your mission stays covert
Remain hidden to the ones that you love
This is an act of fucking cowardice

Through dead cold eyes I see everything
Through dead cold eyes I see through you

Your shame shall not drag me down with you
Your perverted views on life will, will conquer
I will tear apart your sick life, your life
I will see you burn down in life, in life

I will do everything to make sure that you are stopped
Defile all that you have made, to just see that you fall
I will rip apart the shroud that covers your sick life
Reveal to everyone the real monster that is you
I will show to everyone your fucked up mind
