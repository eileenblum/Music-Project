I hope you suffocate I cannot take this anymore now I need to end it
You took this knife and put it in my fucking back and watched me suffocate
I'll slam this to the ground because I have nothing to loose and I have nothing to prove
Break, tear this from the sky set this love ablaze this, it's time we settled this
Once and forever now, You can't stop me now this is my last goodbye

Your faith in hate paints the picture my faith in you erodes and I see now, suffocation that brings us to our end
Your deed you can't undo just turn around and ask yourself now she is six feet underground
And you know you can't turn back and you know there is no escape from this
What do you do? what should I do?

And what of this betrayal of unwritten law and of this "Only one"
I'll take our stars and push them through your fucking eyes can you see me now?
If love, was this note, I'd burn it if love, was this song, I'd kill it
If love, was this note, I'd burn it if love, was this song, I'd kill it
All, I want, is to, feel wanted to run, my fingers, through your hair
To touch, your lips, one more time to hold, your hand, again.
