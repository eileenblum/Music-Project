Liar you fucking liar don't turn your back on me
Fire the fucking fire in your eyes wont hold me back again
Destruction destruction of a final chance to try and turn this around
You step on everything I ever do to try and make yourself feel right
As I think of what could be done to you these are the hopes of a dying man
I will not take this shit again, again
As I think of what could be done to you these are the hopes of a dying man

These thoughts overwhelm me these thoughts overtake me
Everytime I portray you I envision a bitch
These thoughts will not break me these thoughts will not shake me
It's easy just to forget but I just can't. Dark, The sky it imitates the night
All I fear is fucking agony and all I see is fucking pain
All I fear is fucking agony and all I see is fucking pain
I will not take this shit again, again
