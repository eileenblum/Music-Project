Are we mere space dust drifting in time to nowhere and destruction?
Corruption seeps to the purest light and that is existence
Above it all burns the stars buried in the stomach of our land
Just one more drifting chip of consciousness stumbling against 
static waves is it the machine keeping us down?
Plugged in expecting to peak
Above it all burns the stars 
galaxies buried in the stomach of our land
Nothing but dirt and old bones held together by dust
To crack the land and the old backbone clears the mind of stone
A cold smear of last nightâs smoke the drowsing lot
Reeled in on its silver thread red dust a smell like maturing rust
Emptying days and the driving mantle gloom
Last nightâs smoke the drowsing lot
Just plugged in expecting to peak buried by dirt and old bones
Mammalian spreads mute into an extended nervous system
A dense mass of consciousness the blood of our air
There are tunes when we are nowhere
Falling apart it seems falling apart at the seams
