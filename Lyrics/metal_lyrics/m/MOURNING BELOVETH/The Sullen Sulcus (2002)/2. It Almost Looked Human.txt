With raiment bedecked by the grey, cloudfilled sky and the larks song pouring
on the dying day the chain upon my limbs, groping the fleshless wounds,
devoured the yearning bowels of compassion from foetal darkness.

Sleep derived from falling to escape breathless depths
where the dreamless pursuit is shattered, fused by contrivance
from stained womb, drowning in the air so thick with deceit
that the vapours of passion drop to your feet.

"From this angle it almost looked human
But the hole in the ocean just swallowed me up"

Down here you may hear a sharpened scream
forming featureless, enfettered states
that have me tearing the walls of danger
down here all is dark and dazzling

Slain by bliss and grief I kissed the raindrop on your taut, wooden cheek to reveal an empty cry that passed
in the swaying of the breeze.
