A moonlit balcony reveals a majestic beauty "when grief wrapped its cold arms around my body the embers still
flickered in the autumn of our love2 the sight of your beauty breaks the hold of sorrow on me Wandering with
passion in our hearts smelling the melodious scent of orchards bloom on a mountaintop gazing at the evening sky
in the midst of life twisting we bleed mesmerising fires breath eternal life (for which we've sought) Autumnal
fire on the horizon fatal embrace crying in somnolent harmony leaves falling caressing our bodies empty the
world we once knew our fires of passion and bliss now doused by rains of morrow
