Writhing the waves of heaven the glistening moon on my brow carried to lands of desire from deadly and
blackest slumber From savage seas and dangerous lands I wander with no hand to show these deepest dreams from
darkest nights the blackened sun torments me holding me killing me The morning dew at my feet have now left me
all alone alone and cold Through golden meadows afar a haunting vision has now appeared The blossoms that grow
around her enshroud my world with joyous tears O how serene this vision is to me the warming sun reveals a
vessel to lift me above the sea free and beyond beyond
