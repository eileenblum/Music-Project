Faceless, numberless days, grey isolation
Time featureless crushing hope
Intense corrpted Bliss moments
Nothing, the Machine
Everything grinds us down
Escape until we seep, Nothing, the blackened soil

Flying in elegant circles, drift through time and space
Crumble under the wight of sheer intense bliss
Where everything is nothing and nothing - everything
It is a meaningless dearm from which we need to escape?
Tear at the psyche
To bring us down
Where everything is
nothing
And nothing everthing

Delve through the ether, drown in emptiness
I need nothing, I want it all
I need nothing I want the world to crawl
Somewhere in its depths
Lies what we have been looking for
I need nothing I want it all
I need nothing I want the world to crawl

Flying in elegant circles, drifting through time
Crumble under the weight of sheer intense bliss
Where everything is nothing and nothing - everything
It's a meaningless dream
From which we need to escape?
Tear at the psyche to bring us down
The machine rolls through town
