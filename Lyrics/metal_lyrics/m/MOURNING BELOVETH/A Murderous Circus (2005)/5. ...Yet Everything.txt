Fall

Somewhere between the chaos and sulphurous light
Into that strange arena where attraction and repulsion meet
Where love and hate divides, only to meet at a point

Aeons spent dragging the mortal trash through a slow existence, its worn me
down
I've emptied my veins into the earth for the last time as the weight of death
Creeps through the silence - nothing perpared me for this

The space where my misery breahes has worn me down
I've emptied my veins into the earth for the last time

I've drank from the depths of the world
And poured my cup on the heavens
The dull playground
Between the chaos and explosive stillness
Where light and dark serve a purpose
To which humanity must bend

The trouble is I though we'd live forever
The truth is we were dead before we were born
If I wake again it will be in hell
If I see you again it will be in hell

Desire and suffering, the source of our delusions
They are only the extreme points to which we bend
Where the need for excess brings balance
No more torture, no more pain

It's pouring through my veins
No more torture, no more pain
