Emerge like a nocturnal organism fresh from its pupa
Salivating, mutinous, a swarm attractant for the damned

Connected to nothing
Waiting for the next peak
Sensory excitation
Muscles twitch
Excessive compulsion
Nerves Cauterised
Treacherous -insomnia
Drained exhausted
The soft underbelly
Exposed destroyed
Liminal time
Tortures Crown

(This is where) the definite made infinite
Without physical beginning or end
Cathartic sublimation dilated longing
Everything seems blurred at the edges
The nothing gushing past in relentless torrents
Destroying the source the anti structure we must vacate

Pain with the poison pain the first horizon
Disease nothing but the poison beyond all of them
Such an elemental force we must bend to
With the tempest of longing until we can take no more

Weep not for it .....it is all the better lost
