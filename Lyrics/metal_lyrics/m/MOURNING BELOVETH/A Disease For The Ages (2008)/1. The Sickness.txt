Til' the needle
finds the vein
The drug hits
Eyes grow dim

Deconstruction, purified
Sublimation intensifies
Habit hardens veins
Softens the bleakness

Softens the bleakness a marker for disease
A hole where we leak out of existence
A long lingering in my throat
As all life's blood drains away

The body suspended in the dark
Bitter gall hiding like organs
In a jar blackened and grinning
Twisting and contorted tipped with poison

The malodorous mix of bottom feeders
Crawl from the primordial soup stunted and deformed
Flesh eaten to the bone eaten from the inside
Bones crushed crushed to dust
Nothing escapes but poison
The body radiates violence a parasite of thought

Deconstruction, purified
Sublimation intensifies
Habit hardened veins
Softens the bleakness

Deconstruction intensified
Softens the bleakness
All life's blood drains away
All life's blood drains away

Habit hardened veins
All life's blood drains away
All life's blood drains away
Deconstruction sublime
