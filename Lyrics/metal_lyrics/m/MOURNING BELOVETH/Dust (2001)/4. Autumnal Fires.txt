A moonlit balcony reveals a majestic beauty "when grief wrapped its cold arms around my body the embers still
flickered in the autumn of our love" the sight of your beauty breaks the hold of sorrow on me

Wandering with passion in our hearts smelling the melodious scent of orchards bloom in the midst of life twisting we bleed on a mountaintop, gazing at
the evening sky mesmerizing fires breath, eternal life adorning
tragedies, the wind carries fatal embrace in harmony Autumnal
fire on the horizon for which we've sought

Leaves fall caressing our body empty the world we once knew our fires of passion and bliss doused by rains of
morrow
