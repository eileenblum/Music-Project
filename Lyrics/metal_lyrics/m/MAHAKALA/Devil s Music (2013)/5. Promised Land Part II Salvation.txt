Follow me into
the promised land
See through me
now raise your head
and take my hand
As I set your soul on fire
Don't you play your
evil games with me
Just plead with fear

Hearts filled with anger
Scars made with pain
Stand by me, my enemy
Salvation will set me free

But it never comes for me
It never comes

Follow me into this world
that I've created for you
Grasp with fear
Denial's the final deal

My sweet enemy
Salvation will set me free
From my entity

Hearts filled with anger
Scars made with pain
Open up, grab my arm
Seduce me, my enemy

My sweet enemy, salvation
Please set me free from my entity

You are a demon in disguise
Think wisely, abandon
Pledge faith and surrender

Salvation will set me free
from my entity
