Sun sets in Neverland, the red sky falls apart
The time has come to bring down our messiah
Hatred has filled his heart
now that he knows too much
This newborn king is the heaven's pariah

We're hypnotized, but yet alive
The wrath of God falls upon us like fire
We've had enough, it's time for war
Rebellious troopers will bring down the liar

Gathering the masses of divine
They'll march up the sky

We've had enough
Now it's your kingdom's time to fall apart

We stare at you with our hands armed
And lust for your blood

We kill the guards, tear down the walls
Then hunt you down to the top of the tower
We've had enough of your commands
Heavenly blades strike you
down with great power

Servants of the dead with sword in hand
Haunted by lust for blood

We stare at you with our hands armed
And lust for your blood

We're staring straight the face of God
An unholy whisper haunts us
Trapped in our cell in Neverland
With lust for your blood

Now we create a brand new faith
We create a new religion
We slayed the God and took its place
With lust for your blood

Lust For Your Blood!
