Evil man, step inside
Make yourself at home
Out the window there's a lady
feeding of the storm

Cripple man, grab a chair
Take a seat now by the fireplace
Let me suffer in disgrace

Oh, let me suffer in disgrace

Compliments, promises
Do you think I'll fall for all these?
You messenger of hell!

Evil liar
Your denial seems to me
like it just starts to make sense
Don't let me die in ignorance

A sky that's raining fire
A sea that's turning black
An intimate desire
That turns in flesh and blood
