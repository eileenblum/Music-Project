"I climbed up that mountain
To have a look at my land
Apostiles and prophets
I was betrayed by them all

This time I lose control
This time you cannot save me

Evil and unholy
visions of death and demise
Appear before my eyes
Each time I cannot break free

Modern saints and sinners
You're running out of faith
Reach out for helping hand
Near the end of mankind
Under velvet crimson skies
You're under my command

Why you're so ignorant?"

Crucified for nothing
His forehead torn up by thorns

He prays as heavens fall
"Dear father please forgive them...

Modern saints and sinners
You're running out of faith
Reach out for helping hand
Near the end of mankind
Under velvet crimson skies
You're under my command

Now you're under my command
Why you're so ignorant?"
