In the garden of delight
Tree of life is burning down
Fall of man is on the sight
I'm rising with
the serpent's crown

The sky is ours
Pale birds are
guiding us back home
In Neverland
We're never growing old

In Neverland

Lotus eaters, lost in time
Paralyzed, yet undefined
Summoned by an evil rhyme
Great temptation for mankind

The sky is falling
Black birds are
taking us back home
In Neverland
I'm wandering alone

In Neverland
Murder in Neverland

Lovers passionate and young
Setting fire to Neverland

In Neverland
Murder In Neverland
