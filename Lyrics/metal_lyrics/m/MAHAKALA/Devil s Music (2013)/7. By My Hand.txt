Unpleasant and lame
His living
Unsafe and half dead
But forgiven
This road you've chosen son
is forbidden

His head aches
By fragile thoughts

Full moon now shines above them
Dead man please smile again
This night is coming to an end
Oh, die by my hand

Ashamed and brave
His image
Dishonored, enslaved
Real menace
This road you've chosen son
is forbidden

Full moon now shines above them
Dead man please smile again
This night is coming to an end
Oh, die by my hand

She was your god
And you should worship her
Her face now haunts you everyday
Her eyes, so green
When she speaks, look away

Hell's hound now breaking free
Lover, woman, friend
A sun so bright is blinding him
Grey town swallows him

Oh, Die By My Hand!
