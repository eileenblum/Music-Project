I gain reputation
I'll stand on a throne
King of a land
that stands alone

Preachers
Keep running towards me
This is me
King of a land
that fights for freedom

You can't bring me down
Alright now!
Your time has come

This war is never ending
A kingdom fast descending
Imprisoned and divided
The king is dead
Long live the king

Landmine
Buried into the ground
Blood spilled all around
Rebellion strikes me
down like thunder

All my words are promises
But I lie!
I came to take away
your freedom

You can't bring me down
(Alright now!)
You can't kill me

This war is never ending
A kingdom fast descending
Imprisoned and divided
The king is dead long live the king
