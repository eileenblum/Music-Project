Sweet mother nature, my unseen god
Come down and meet me in "Neverland"
I was seduced by a creature,
It was the so called "Evil Man"
I'm under his command

"Modern Saints" why don't you
leave me alone?
Now that "The King Is Dead"
you're on your own

Rise like hell and break free
You're my one deadly sin
My devilish prayer
Beg for mercy, I will
Why you're still staying still?
Stop taking my soul away from me

Give me blue notes for the devil
Sing me blue notes for the "Devil's Song"

This is the devil's song
For I'm the devil
And you're the devil's son

I stand alone with
"Lust For Your Blood"
Why don't you come
And "Die By My Hand"?

Rise like hell and break free
You're my one deadly sin
My devilish prayer
Beg for mercy, I will
Why you're still staying still?
You're taking my soul away from me

Give me blue notes for the devil
I sold my soul for rock 'n' roll!

This is the devil's song
For I'm the devil
And you're the devil's son
