Satan, come take my soul away
Wisdom, please give me
Wealth and fame are so useless
to a sinner like me

Show me the way
Again and again

Satan, sweet demon go away
Knowledge, you gave me
Happiness is so useless
to a fool like me

Show me the way
Again and again

Heaven's breaker
Shallow hater
Take my soul away
Chaos bringer
Who is left to pay?

Made a deal with the demon himself
Signed a pact with the devil

Now there's nothing but pure madness
broken vows and grief
Pull my soul into this labyrinth
Oh yeah!

Made a deal with the demon himself
(The swallower of souls)
Signed a pact with the devil
