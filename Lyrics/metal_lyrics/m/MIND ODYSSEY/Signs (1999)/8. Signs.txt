Peace on the shore
Just a man coming to the end
Waves on ice
Barely half the size
Of the flood he had seen

Then nature came
Out of a winterâs lethargy
Paradise when right through his eyes
It was just memory

Take my life tomorrow
Will you please allow me delay?
Need a day I belong anyway
To the night

Heâd used to be
Faster than any other man
Whereâd it gone because the final sum
Couldnât run to a name

His broken frame
Straightened when
He called up the man
Of the past thatâs not made to last
He would disdain to believe

Frozen and tired and weak was his body
He did not seem to worry
Only one thing can
Be of avail and
This is the hope to stay
