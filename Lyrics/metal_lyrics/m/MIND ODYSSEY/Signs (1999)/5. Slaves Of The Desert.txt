Skin burnt to leather
Endless the pain
Struggling against the heat
A people to die for
A building Campaign
Treated like lifeless meat

Brought here to follow
The orders of friends
Driving the lot insane
Shuffling in circles
Degraded to vehicles
A caravan of pain

And their sorrow will last still tomorrow
And they long for a poisonous arrow

A thousand tons of stones a day
Dragged along the Nile
Meant to cheer a sinister priest 
And Stuck into a pile

Perfect programmes
Inventive brains
High proficiency
You celebrate a clan
But you forget those men
Who left their marks on me

A song from the desert
Revealing its secret to me
Easily,I hear the creed

The kings of the desert
Concealing their glamour from me
Because they feel,what I need
