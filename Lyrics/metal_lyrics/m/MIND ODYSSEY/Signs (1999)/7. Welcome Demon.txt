On top of a high mountain
I ran here sheltering myself
Hot dryness pure silence
Before the storm

Broken trees all around me
Burning leaves
The work of a baleful demon
Hounding me

The wind of prey is following me
It wonât subside, no place to hide

Another high mountain
Feel a tremor to its centre
Eruption and silence again
After the storm

Token rings of cruelty
Around my head
The end of the earth was tried out
On the smallest scale

Welcome demon I will fight my way
Till Iâll be fearsome
Much more reckless a deadly necklace
Welcome demon never gonna yield
Till Iâll be fearsome
Youâll be on my mind till your final sigh

Some of us die without a sigh
Only full of idle pride
I should regret it better forget it
Coming watching winning

If we keep on killing treasures
Weâll kill as well our future pleasures
Demons keep the reins on men
Ariel was one or âem 

I boarded the kingâs ship
Now in the waist, the deck
In every cabin I flamâd amazement
Sometimes Iâd divide
And burn in many places
On the top-mast, the yards and bowsprit
Would I flame 
[Shakespeare]
