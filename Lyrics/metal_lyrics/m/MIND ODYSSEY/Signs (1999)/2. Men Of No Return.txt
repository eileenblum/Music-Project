Quiet observers
Face to face
Monumental miracles
Fascinating symbols instigate a dream
Find myself in antiquated scenes

I wonât believe in you
Telling me what is true
I can tell fake from the real
Split identity
Who used to take the steering wheel?
I wonât forget the things I feel
We know hearts are bleeding
Gifts from missing
Heroes

Men of no return
Locked up the world behind those
Secrets in the sand
Forgot to tell us where to find
The key to understand
We canât see anything behind
Arrangements lying in our way
We just have to save âem from decay

Precise arrival times
Are spinning round my mind
Prodigies of outer space
Fascinated people waking from a deal
A different kind has snatched the wheel
