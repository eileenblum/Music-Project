Laid so low
It felt so strange
I had to stop to rearrange
A light so bright
Inside my brain
I fought with might and main

A fever is killing me
Creeping and burning
Spreading all night and day
Insatiable yearning

Hey you will never see 
Me running away
Cause I have to be
In the picture
Hear just what I say
I donât have an idea
Whatâs going on?
From where did you come?
Whatâs your mission?

Though they lurked
Still out of range
I made a bow before the strange
When they introduced themselves
I recognized
My own brain-cells

Fear in the neighbourhood
Of hope and commitment
Dreams had a bigger size
Than Iâd ever witnessed
