Watch me when Iâm in my place
A happy smile across my face
No matter whatâs at stake
Thereâs nothing I canât take

Crises and a bitter story
Iâm great for staging sorry
And when I leave the screen
Itâs coming out of me

Look at me Iâm not a liar
Let me answer your desire
Want to waste your money
For the scandals coming
These wonât touch me any more
I know the way it can be cured
The medicineâs for free
I take it from TV

Might I know?
Why your tears fall
Thanks to you
Thank you for being helpful

Come to where you havenât been
Where virtue takes the part of sin
Your problems only count
As long as weâre around
