You canât judge
On you own
Whatâs right and whatâs wrong
Undeterred by the world

Donât you overlook?
The signs of the past
That have not died as of yet itâs on

You to defy to the spirit of the time
Timeâs past its prime need
To jump across the line

Bite a piece off the 
Days of yore it tastes like
Wine discovered after
Years of time common and

You canât judge
On you own
Whatâs right and whatâs wrong
Undeterred by the world

The signs on the page
From our golden age
I feel youâre the

One to defy to the spirit of the time
Timeâs past its prime need
To jump across the line

I close my eyes for a while
Associate ideas
When something new is born
The older will be torn
Dump insolence

We came from a long line of nobility
I want to stay for a rerun
