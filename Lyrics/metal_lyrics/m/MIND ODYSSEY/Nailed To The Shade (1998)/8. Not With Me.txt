Digging my way through the world
I am digging for inspiration
Follow my mind walking a mental lane
I was seen even doomed to be natural
Which is solely one notion of mine?
Missing a vision
Wanting in dreams
Opinionated manners
I donât care for crowds
Seeking a road to the world
I am digging for inspiration
Follow my mind walking a mental lane
I canât bear egotistical demeanour
I donât need those nonentities around
Shamming a vision
Persistently 
Opinionated manners
I donât care for crowds
No surrender
Trying people will not harass me
No pretender
Will ever ravage my placidity
Whatâs the matter Iâm apposed to being just a doll?
Stuffed into a bookshelf filled with everything but soul
No surrender
Bowing down is not a game with me not with me
