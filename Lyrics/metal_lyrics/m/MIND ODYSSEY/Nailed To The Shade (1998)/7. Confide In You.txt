Be my delight and disregard my
Loneliness inside letâs keep on trying
Stronger our alliance is on a trial
I still confide in you
So short of time we live in the speed of light
We cannot comprehend itâs far too fast youâre
Run down wanna be your shelter
Tear away from uncertainty
Will you ever learn weâre in a snare?
When the sun sets weâre alone without a light
How can you say I donât care donât you realize
We depend on the same rules of life
Always adored the features of your face
I hope you feel alike youâd lose your hold if
I laid my remembrance of
Lonely eyes empowers me to stay
Now and again
I was nigh to give in
Lend me your hand with a smile
Besides barricades canât hold on my raids
Hold on for a moment
And brush away my sins
To comfort urgent pains itâs alright
