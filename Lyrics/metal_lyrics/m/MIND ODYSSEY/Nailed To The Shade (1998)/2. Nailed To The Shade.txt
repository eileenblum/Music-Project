I pour another mourning
Over the drunkard I am
Sought to reach for you
Competing with this silence
Tried to defy your fatality
Youâd been lurking
So close to me
I wonât surrender
Never surrender no
My ruined system
Is getting weak
Have lost all traces
Iâm waiting for a spell
That will set me free
I am bad and drowned
Our dreams collide
Canât bring me down
Oh how I wish 
To escape from the devil
Greedy for a kill
Growing impatience
Caught my ego
He reduced my soul
Iâm weary in my mind
Creating his design
Fought me egoâ¦
