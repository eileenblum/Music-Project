Sceneries giving me an answer
On the verge of being blown asunder
How many lies
Said in the guise of Jesus
The sinners see their
Mendacities in heaven
Nothing more frightening me
No prayers no sights of sadness
Tell me one appeasing ground
For their existence
I donât like them to ignore our dignity
Let âem play again the mastermind-messiah
Gonna be bedevilled to decay
No religion people devastate their sovereignty
Superstition will steer us into error
No religion can avail against dilemmas
We donât wanna lose control
High time we quit it 
Donât give adman about that shit
Check it out you 
Fossils go away retreat
