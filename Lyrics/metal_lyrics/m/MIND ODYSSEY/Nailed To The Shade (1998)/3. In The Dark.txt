Youâre telling me the danger is gone
Is it really true
You laugh at my anxious life
I fear what I chose
You say thereâs no reason to break
Into a sweat down here
All ways are allowed dark
I am the ideal trusty tool no will
Was in quest of quiet not the thrill
Nothing more canât stand no more shocks
Nothing more canât dwell on grounds of shadows
â¦ of shadows
Praying for you
Waiting for you sign
Pointing at the sun
Praying for you and
A sunbeam for us
Freeing our souls
