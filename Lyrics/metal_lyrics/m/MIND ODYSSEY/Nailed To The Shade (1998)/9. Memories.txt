Deep down heading for a destination
Down where my knowledge grows
Deep down on a pavement of visions
I can see all being left for good
Stand in cruel lights
Bad dreams I go blind
I flee from the lights of this city
Leaving rotten odds behind
Even if theyâre handsome or pretty
When you rely on âem youâre betrayed
Memories are melodies
Feeding you mind the sense of
A sound instead of clues they have
Come on and feel it
Dirty tricks played on me unrebelled since
I donât try to steal away
I only wait for amendment be attentive
Queens of fresh musicians
Playing along my way of life
Itâs Sunday the worst day
An enemy an awful torture
A dream is slaying me like a sword
Itâs me whoâs forced to live soulâs melody
Within Iâm a violent composer
I pay no heed to moral signs
I donât need to be cut to oblivion
Canât hold on Iâm out of time
