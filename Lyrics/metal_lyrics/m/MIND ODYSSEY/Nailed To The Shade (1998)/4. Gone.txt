A great affair is due to come
My headâs assembling
Pieces of past years
See a fragment thatâs been gone
Others are staying
Day after day a coloured century
Full of ambitions and mighty mistakes
Doubt and faith cannot be untied
Fortune is turning terms
Turns the perspective of sight
A dangerous enterprise guiding you
To oncoming lights
E=mcÂ² since 1905
Motor-driven airplanes coming alive
Tchaikovsky Leonard Bernstein
Celebrities around the world
London Paris did not worry
Cause they forget Berlin
It kept a hold on Europe
And won initially
Blood replaced by liquid iron
Agents of calamity
This century
A reflection of uncertainty
Time goes on no interruption
People come and go
On the screen an everlasting show
Championships in Munich, Oslo, Helsinki, L.A.
Submarines united spacelabs
Formula 1 and 3
Business and corruption
Feed a pile of men
Seeking for technology
And immortality
Trapped in communication
Sheep and apes are cloned
Hong Kong given back to China
Limits coming down
