Houston weâve got problems
Do you feel our mood?
Covered miles a distance
Approaching the moon
A loud noise
No choice
To end our mission
Without a break
A challenge wisely calculated
Going to extremes
Madly lunatic
Wonât make history
Fade into space solely
One way is leading back to you
Chasing an aim gonna pay for the news
We go through hell finally
Have a sensation of the devil
Clad in disguise face to toes
A deafening explosion
Stuck in mystery
Systems in confusion
Weâre losing energy
The vital powers suffocated 
Heating oxygen
The volunteers out of
A million people
Facing fate again
Floating so lonely
Sheer action and pace
Sort of routine
Now weâre counting our days
