I used to live in my dreams
That time is over
Heard a voice and heard a scream
I couldnÂ´t take no more
Now I sit here
Steel chains on my hands
Oh IÂ´m missing you
I donÂ´t understand

DonÂ´t touch me 
DonÂ´t stare at me
You should leave me alone
DonÂ´t touch me
DonÂ´t bug me
My life is not your own

Look in this empty room 
I have to stay here
CanÂ´t walk away
DonÂ´t know how long IÂ´ll be there
With all the crazy freaks I live
Just keep them far away from me
They only torture my life
Slowly becoming a zombie
I only want to survive

ItÂ´s a life of choices
Reaching out a hand
Got to use our voices
Got to make a stand
Lokking for an answer
Living for another day
Nothing ainÂ´t infinity
You can find the way
