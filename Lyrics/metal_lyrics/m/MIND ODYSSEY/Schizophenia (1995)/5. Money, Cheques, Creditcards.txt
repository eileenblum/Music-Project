In the streets of golden honey
You can get all that you want
If you donÂ´t have the money
That wonÂ´t last for long
The plastic in the answer
Take all that you need
Another day in this paradise
Pleasure guaranteed
YouÂ´ve forgotten Â´bout discretion
And youÂ´re about to lose your home
And now you bleed for liberty
In the preasuredome
There is a mas whoÂ´s coming
ThereÂ´s no other way
HeÂ´ll tell you that your time is up
And now youÂ´ve got to pay

Now youÂ´re broke youÂ´re a runner
On the run from profigunners
Now youÂ´re broke youÂ´re a runner
To get away is all that you want
Now youÂ´re broke
YouÂ´re broke
And you canÂ´t lose that gunner
Now youÂ´re broke youÂ´re a runner
Like a rabbit in a dangerous hunt
