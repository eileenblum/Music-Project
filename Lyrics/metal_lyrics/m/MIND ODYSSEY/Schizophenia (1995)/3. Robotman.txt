Feel like IÂ´m dead
I get out of bed
I drive off  to work
And things keep getting worse

I canÂ´t fantasize
All I hear are lies
I know what to do 
ItÂ´s what they tell me to
I canÂ´t find no system
In my mind
I canÂ´t find the answers
IÂ´ve got feelings like a

Robotman yeah a robotman
Remote controlled
A deadly friend
Robotman yeah a robotman
YouÂ´ve killed my suol
I canÂ´t pretend

Robotman Robotman itÂ´s all the same each day
Robotman Robotman thereÂ´s no other way

There is nothing new
What I alwais do
Locked up in a cage
And I canÂ´t ever change
