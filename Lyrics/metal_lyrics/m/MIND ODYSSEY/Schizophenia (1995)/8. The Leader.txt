It was the dream of the human race
Everybody wants to be God
But no one is laughing
Cause they know that God is me
I canÂ´t believe that some still donÂ´t see
They do not understand
I need no helping hand
I talk to my T.V.

Ruling the world
From my living room
Reach out to me
IÂ´m all ya need
IÂ´ll set ya free

I am your leader
The leader of the streets
I am your leader
You will follow me
I am your leader
Now you better pray
I am your leader
YouÂ´ll do what I say

Temptation frustration everywhere
EverybodyÂ´s running out of time
There is no happiness
ThereÂ´s just loneliness
One day theyÂ´ll come for you and youÂ´ll resist
Just like it happined once to me
And then the men in white
Come in to make it right
Still donÂ´t know why IÂ´m here
Like in a dream
That was made for me

Voices come in through the walls
Voices that tell what I should be 
The curtain falls
Hmanity calls
