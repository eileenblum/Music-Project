I look around and wonder
Where I am
I hear a sound from yonder
Can not understand
Just emptiness surrounds me 
Echoes fade
Into the distance

A silent roar of madness in my head
Has left my heart in darkness
Might  as well be dead
For nothing seems to matter
Anyway
There are not reasons

Caught in a capsule in a moment in time
Hallucinations flow just tricks of the mind
But still a part of me keeps fighting inside
CanÂ´t let go no,no,no

If I could only fill my emptiness inside
If I could only find the past I left behind
I know thereÂ´s so much more
I could be living for
Rights through the secret door

Now suddenly a rumour
Fills the air
ItÂ´s growing like a tumor
Spreading everywhere
I feel the cold vibrations
IÂ´m in a state of no resistance

Caught in a capsule...

If I could only fill...

I walk a spiralcase and reach ourt for the skies
I see salvation smiles reflected in my eyes
And now itÂ´s plain to see this isnÂ´t really me
Where is my reality
