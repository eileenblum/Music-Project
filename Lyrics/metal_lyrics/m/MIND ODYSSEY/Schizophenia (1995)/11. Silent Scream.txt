ItÂ´s the same every day
A circle where I stay
I am in my minds own way
ItÂ´s a long way to home
To heal insanity
No I donÂ´t know my life is
Secrets I canÂ´t find
All my dreams are closed forever
Leaving me so blind
No I donÂ´t know my life is
Games that I canÂ´t win
Searching for a way to go back
Nowhere to begin

Missing warmth in my life
Only trying to survive
The fear within me never dice
There is no breaking out
All my friends are leaving
Hear the warning now from me
