Sounds of steel and metal voices
Pounding straight into my nerves
Giant walls computers running
Finding no way to break out
They want me terminated now
TheyÂ´re sacrificing me,sacrificing me
Now I must live in here all time controlled
I bow down to the law

Computer madness
Creating sadness
Tell me what weÂ´ve done
Communications
From machinations
Tell me what weÂ´ve won

Metal Gods around the empire
Shout commands to rule the world
People die machine creators
Father robot boys and girls
They want me terminated now
TheyÂ´re sacrificing me,sacrificing me
Now I must live in here all time controlled
I bow down to the law

Computer madness
Creating sadness
Tell me what weÂ´ve done
Communications
From machinations
Tell me what weÂ´ve won

A cold solution
For revolution
In isolation
Come revelations
