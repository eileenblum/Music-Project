Asphalt runner front door gunner
Coming after you
Wanna share this feeling in my mind
WeÂ´ve got facts and weÂ´ve got proof
That we got things right
Follow us and things will be just fine

There ainÂ´t no second choise
You try to understand
TheyÂ´ll tell your their solution
Then theyÂ´ll shake your hand

Empty promises of truth
Freeing you from sin
Still searching for a master in your mind
One for all and all for one
We are living on the edge
We start a chain reaction down the line

LetÂ´s forget the guruÂ´s voice
We have always got a choise
No one else can understand like you
Like do you
See the world and realize
This is not true paradise
Go your own way

DonÂ´t think ever twice
Voodoo canÂ´t save me now,save me now
Voodoo canÂ´t save me now
Leave me alone just let go
WeÂ´re living in a dirty town

ThereÂ´s violence in the streets
EverybodyÂ´s looking for a chance for breaking out
Face to face to win this fight
Hunts me all right long
Gonna show you what this thing is all about
