Subway station "District A"
YouÂ´re waiting for the train
Unberable noise screaming out
Invasion of your brain
A wounded man lies in filth
I canÂ´t lake no more 
Close to a nervious breakdown
Last night front page news
A woman got raped
But there was no escape
Everytime the same old story
I canÂ´t hear no more
Close to a nervious breakdown

So close your eye it will go away
Let everything be okay
ThereÂ´s no reason to get dirty hands
You can understand
Demonstration protest march
Another point of view
But on the right the cops are there
And they nothing new
Breaking limbs and spilling blood
I canÂ´t see no more
Close to nervious breakdown

So close your eyes...

Big city itÂ´s like hell
Everything got outta control
University of greed and hate
Where everybody wants to enroll
Close your eyes donÂ´t be scared
It will go away
Close your eyes you are not to blame

So close your eyes...
