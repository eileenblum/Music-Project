I am lying alone with my secrets
Spinning around in my head
Something has somehow escaped me
Something thet should have been said
We shouldnÂ´t have lived for the moment
Should have let the barriers fall
We are always on the run
We all try to reach the sun
When something left the ocean
To go on hand
An animal began to think
And became man
It was yesterday,yesterday,yesterday

The wheels started rolling
And we built our cars
Rocketships computers
We flew to the stars
It was yesterday,yesterday,yesterday

We want the power 
And we want the best
Fighting and winning
We wonÂ´t be the last

Mutant birds are flying
In clouds of smog
Burning rivers full of trash
And toxic fog
Decayed atmosphere the end is near
The end is hear
Cyborgs marching in the streets
Stealling our illusions

Coverment fall to the ground
Ruined be confusion
It was ment to be ment to be reality
