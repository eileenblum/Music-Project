Straight out of hell
The other side
Life there in the darkness left behind
All that they told me 
Were lies that brought me down
Craziness and pain was all I found

Waiting for a new beginning
Someday in time
D-day is now
Waiting for another chance
Someday weÂ´ll go

A new mission here
Pick up the loose ends
Bring my life into a new direction
Got to just do it do it now
Just do it now
IÂ´ll take the chance
IÂ´m breaking out

Waiting for a new beginning
The time is right
And this time is now
Waiting for another chance
We are ready now

WeÂ´re gonna make a stand
IÂ´ve seen the winds of change 
WeÂ´ve got ot rearrange
Tear down all these machines
IÂ´ll show you what I mean
