Everybody makes their sacrifices
Everybody needs a place to go
Watchâem meet and hearâem throw their races
Your fear has gone and turned into a flow
Deep in the night, deep in the night
The light is low
Wheels turn round and greet the lord
Evil engines, strumming down the city
We donât care about a safety zone
Ride the devil we have never parted
Just beware the strong arm of the law
Deep in the night, deep in the night
The light is low
Wheels turn round and greet the lord
Riding and ruling
or suicide?
Chasing and fooling
the devilâs bride
Riding and ruling
or suicide?
Chasing and fooling
We can get it right
Deep in the night, deep in the night
The light is low
Wheels turn round and greet the lord
Riding and ruling
or suicide?
Chasing and fooling
the devilâs bride
Riding and ruling
or suicide?
Chasing and fooling
Marry her alright
