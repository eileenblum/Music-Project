Youâve been searching
youâve seen different lives on your way
so exciting a price you just
donât wanna pay
bits were beautiful
bits werenât worth the time
still youâre hanging on
to changing
go on fighting
youâve seen different times on your way
you got past their laughter
returning to a simple rule
of the game
though itâs animal
and they call it a crime
youâre still hanging on
to changing
why not pass by all true lies
sucking the marrow
out of our lives
no one ever left this scene
staying the same he`d always been
itâs time to change it, itâs time to change it
why not pass by all true lies
sucking the marrow
out of our lives
no one ever left this scene
staying the same he`d always been
kicks me right outta my mind
I leave my sences behind
I hate losing control
burning from head to toe
