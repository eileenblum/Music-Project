Follow me my love, I flew away,
leaving your true heart alone.
I can see in your eyes when I dream,
taste the tears you shed at home.
One moment changed it all.
Your white swan is under magic spell.
This ravens life is mine
To become
One â Raven and swan
They both are one
Raven and swan are one
Sorcerer in black, this wicked man
took my life under control.
Now Iâm winged in black, fly in the night,
wait for you to free my soul.
Iâm waiting in the dark.
If youâd only find a way, love set me free.
This raven is a swan
To become
One â Raven and swan
They both are one
Raven and swan are one
