I canât hide and Iâm concerned
for itâs sure to track me down, yeah
I should never ever turnâ¦
but it sends me rolling
I know my brain says never mind
Can I stand the pain?
I go round and round and round and
like a can of tin
only kicked into the gutter
How it likes the spin!
and I drown, and I drown, and I drown, and I drown
running blood, down the forehead
listen to me
cold blood, down the forehead
Our Saviour in Heaven wonât
take me to the other side
and make me sound
I am losing the higher ground
and Iâve wasted all my life
every shot wants loading
I feel the emptiness inside
Can a loser win?
went around and round and round and
wound up paralyzed
but a few powerful strides
freed me from my ties
was so lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely
running blood, down the forehead
listen to me
cold blood, down the forehead
Our Saviour in Heaven wonât
take me to the other side
and make me sound
I am losing the higher ground
and Iâve wasted all my life
running blood, down the forehead
listen to me
cold blood, down the forehead
Our Saviour in Heaven wonât
