Stabbing me, enemy daggers are haunting me
Suffering, Iâll do it my way

Stabbing me, enemy daggers are haunting me
Suffering, Iâll do it my way
Money game, hall of fame, stupid celebrities
Surging pain, Iâll do it my way

From liberty to statue blues
A bunch of legless kangaroos
Forgetting you is like loving a lover
Everyday I dream about it
Doing away with the likes of you bothers
shout it out loud

How can I find a way out?
Left or right, front or backwards?
Let us gather a crowd
I know you by your sound
tell me why was I frustrated
Let us gather a crowd

Failing me, enemy daggers canât get at me
Jealousy? I do it my way
Hall of fame, end of game, Saturday, I am free
You can see I do it my way

Forgetting you is like loving a lover
Everyday I dream about it
Doing away with the likes of you bothers
shout it out loud

How can I find a way out?
Left or right, front or backwards?
Let us gather a crowd
I know you by your sound
tell me why was I frustrated
Let us gather a crowd

How can I find a way out?
Left or right, front or backwards?
Let us gather a crowdâ¦
Find me out
Left or right, front or backwards?
Let us gather a crowd
I know you by your sound
tell me why was I frustrated
Let us gather a crowd
