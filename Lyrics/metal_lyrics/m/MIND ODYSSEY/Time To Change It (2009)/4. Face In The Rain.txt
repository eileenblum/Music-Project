I donât know why youâre cold as ice
I donât know what it is
the dream that started in paradise
has wound up in abyss
Iâm a runaway
Iâm a runaway
Ooh, on and onâ¦
I donât know why you close your eyes
I donât know what it is
Blood runs cold, my body cries
I never felt like this
Iâm a runaway
Iâm a runaway
Ooh, on and on
I know I canât trust in heaven
I know that God went insane
You know I canât trust in heaven
I recall your face in the rain
You said Iâd be cool if I trusted you blind
the more I suffered and missed
but I was lonely when I made up my mind
discovered I wasnât kissed
Iâm a runaway
Iâm a runaway
Ooh, on and on
I know I canât trust in heaven
I know that God went insane
You know I canât trust in heaven
I recall your face in the rain
