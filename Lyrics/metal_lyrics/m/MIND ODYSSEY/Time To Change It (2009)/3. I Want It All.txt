Headstrong by nature, I
ever was and stay
Thereâll be no doubt to wreck my soul
Welcome to see me while
Iâm running my own play
No matter if Iâm loved or hated there
So wary of your embraces and terror
Iâm only looking for a way to obey my own self
I want it all, I want it now, I want it here
I want it free of charge and toll
I want it more, I want a life, I want it like I need a love
that drives me insane
Became the major of nights
waking everywhere
roaming the urban desert zone
right under city lights
breeder of affairs
a new kind of myself was showing
So wary of your embraces and terror
Iâm only looking for a way to obey my own self
I want it all, I want it now, I want it here
I want it free of charge and toll
I want it more, I want a life, I want it like I need a love
that drives me insane
out of my mind and great
So wary of your embraces and terror
Iâm only looking for a way to obey my own self
I want it all, I want it now, I want it here
I want it free of charge and toll
I want it more, I want a life, I want it like I need a love
that drives me insane
