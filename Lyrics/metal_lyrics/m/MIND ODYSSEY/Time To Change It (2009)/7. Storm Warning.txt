Storm warning, men running,
rain drumming, gallon-like
About to anihinlate my life
drowning the time we had in sight
A muddy beggar, staggering ahead
another push, he topples over twice
face all dead and red
Electric power, humming in the air
everything and everyone in flight
suddenly weâre in despair
While the world keeps turning
itâs no longer alive
Mother nature burning
while weâre trying to survive
While the world keeps turning
pointed on a knife
Hope weâre not the first of generations
doomed to pass and die
Global warming, sky roaring,
land sliding, blaze alight
broadcast all around the clock
We know everything and canât make it right?
We lost the feeling, blind like in the night
A devastation of enormous size
We donât realize
The human power, meant to save and care
vanishing and helpless on the ground
Suddenly weâre in despair
While the world keeps turning
pointed on a knife
Hope weâre not the first of generations
doomed to pass and die
