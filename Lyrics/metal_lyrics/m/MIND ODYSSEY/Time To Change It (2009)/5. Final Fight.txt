Can you feel it
Can you feel it inside
Can you hear it
Can you hear it at night
Come and feel it
get a hold of me tight
lay your hand on me
make me feel alright
Good and evil
shock and wonder
start to run, try to get away
take a ride in the line of fire
Common, common, common
We are a little bit crazy
We are the keepers of lost insanity
Tonightâs the night to be crazy
Common, common,
This be our final fight
Come and feel it,
come and savour the day
Lifeâs your one and
only stage to play
Come and feel it
Get a hold of me tight
Call up whatâs creeping
in the dark behind
God and devil
shock and wonder
start to run, try to get away
take a ride in the line of fire
Common, common, common
We are a little bit crazy
We are the keepers of lost insanity
Tonightâs the night to be crazy
Common, common,
This be our final fight
