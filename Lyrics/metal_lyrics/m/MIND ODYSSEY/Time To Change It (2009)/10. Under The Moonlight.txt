Under the moonlight
you feel sad at night
youâve been in tie
now youâre so alone
Under the moonlight
grows a better life
no matter why
You feel so strong
When the coldest dream is over
When the sunâs outdoing evil powers
And when your time has come and
discovered luckâs failed you so long
Under the moonlight
things are magnified
so close tonight
almost foreign emotions
Under the moonlight
You are by my side
withstand the tide
conquer the sea
When the coldest dream is over
When the sunâs outdoing evil powers
And when your time has come and
discovered luckâs failed you so long
Keep the fire inside
Back to reality
No need to hide
Ball of fire
Let the flame burn inside
Feeding and saving me
Iâve learned to survive
