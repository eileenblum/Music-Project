I woke up in the middle of a dream
Saw the roll of the dice
Skies of blue fields of endless green
Clouds of fire and ice

[chorus]
We walk on earth and reach out for the stars
Big red letters all the way from Mars
We dream in colour but we live in black and white

[refrain]
See that nature is burning
Feel the ocean is here
We try to keep it all turning
But I can see the fear

I woke up in a world of confusion
Time is right for a change
These dreams were filled up with illusions
They've all become so strange

[chorus]
[refrain]
