You're sittin' and watchin'
And thinkin' out your head
There's one thing you be sure today
The time is running through your hands
Always just the same
And you crying aout your heart
So many years of wasted time

How do you feel now mama's fallen angel
In the city you don't know
Where you can sleep tonight
Down down dirty in the deep of this town
You're hangin' out on the streets and you remember

When you are young and wild
They said you have to be cool
And when the nights came down
You felt like a fool

You are a stranger in the desert
A looser in the night
So you dance alone
And when you've lost your direction
In the big city lights
Then you dance alone

Make your stand and deliver
Straight ahead and live your life
Don't be a fool no more

You are a restless child
Got no place to go
You livin' in a jungle out of time
What have you seen now
Thought you were so strong
This is not like before
