Living for the night
There's a power that excites
So Possessed by you
Hiding from the day
You were showing me the way
There was something new

[chorus]
Then you cried out to the moon
Don't you come back to my room

[refrain]
Just go away
You are the fire
I am so afraid
Can't you tell me why

Dark reality
An somehow you call on me
Are you fantasized
Got no other choices
'Cause I know the voices
Can't be exorcised

[chorus]
[refrain]

I once had a dream
And I thought that I would scream
And then there you were
I know it's a lie
I see it in your eyes
How can I be sure
