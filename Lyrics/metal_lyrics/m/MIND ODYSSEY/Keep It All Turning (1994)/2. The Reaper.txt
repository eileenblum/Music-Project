Lying here so loneley in grim reality
Somethings come to haunt me I hear the prophecy
I want to run away but I got nowhere to turn
Everywhere I look I can see the fires burn

[chorus]
So gripped by fear
Always so near
Fortune or fame
It's still the same

[refrain]
Night falls here comes the reaper
He's come to take a life
Like dolls, he gonna keep ya
He's there to take another soul

All I can remember it started as a dream
Suddenly so clear that I woke up with a scream
I feel waves of panic spread across the land
Searching just for me like the icy hand

[chorus]
[refrain]

Looking in the past I see that I was blind
Living for each day there is nothing left behind
Thoughts of desperation running through my head
Because in the morning I know that I'll be dead
