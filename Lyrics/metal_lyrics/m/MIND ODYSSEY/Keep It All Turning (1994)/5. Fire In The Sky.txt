Two hundred people at the airport
Are waiting for the flight to New York
Nobody want a suicide
The most of them heading home

FBI and the airline office
had a call from the devil's sons
But they see no reason
To stop the starting plane

[chorus]
So they start 'cause it's good weather
A normal flight the same as ever
Nobody knows that there is death on board
No technology can stop him now

Fire in the sky no chance to breaking out now
Fire in the sky there's no security

The killers are blinded from their religion
They wanna start a revolution
But they're fighting in a war
They will never win

And they kill with modern weapons
Helpless mothers and their children
Cold fanatic terrorists
Are the angles of the beast

[chorus]

Fire in the sky no chance to breaking out now
Fire in the sky there's no security
