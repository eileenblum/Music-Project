When you're alone
You go out on the streets
Hearing the wind you remember
You're facing the sky
Where the fire begins
And now you can't fight anymore
You waited too long
It will never come back
Lost in the hand of a stranger
It conquers the sea
It embraces the land
As cold as the eyes of a whore

I feel the beast is coming
The sky is glowing red
And now we are becoming
A world of walking dead

I've opened my eyes
And seen my tomorrow
I can feel that
The end is near
Slowly we fall
To replenish the earth
But we all know that it's too late
Each day we live
We just take we don't give
Destroying the way to survive
We couldn't know
All the things we do now
Blinded by nature's constructions
Knowing that we
Have but only one chance
A wait 'til the saviour arrives
