Whisper of angels sing in the darkness
Assuming control
The eyes of a stranger looking upon us
Into our souls
Waves of destruction pouding the woodwork
Into our bones
Steering our will and taking us farther
From our homes

And we'll sail away from the sun
And into the land of tomorrow
Searching the paths of the night
The stars will show us where to go

When you find the answer to the never ending story
You will know the power of odyssey
Take a trip in fantasy and sail across the ocean
Feel the spirits of our destiny
I feel the time is right please come along with me
We'll see the ancient dreams and know the way
Of odyssey

Visions and voices, forgotten stories
That need to be told
Ghosts of lost sailors bringing us forward
Into the cold

Frightening powers try to destroy us
But we carry on
Know that darkness is never forever
We wait for the dawn

I search for answers now each and every day
I need to find the truth but I can't find a way

Cross the oceans with odyssey
There's a power flowing on the endless sea
'Round the world with the odyssey
Now I need you tell me that you'll come with me

We'll get through it if we make our attack
We can do it and we'll never look back
