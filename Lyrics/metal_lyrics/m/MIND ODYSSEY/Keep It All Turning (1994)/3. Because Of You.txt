Lead the way down to my city
And show me all the things you would improve
Take them away so that we can rebuild them
I'll build a place just for me and you

You know what I am and
You know what I'd like from you

Well the nights keep getting colder
When will the fire ever reach our souls?

Riding on the lightning
'Til we reach the sea
So cool that it's frightning
When you're with me

Because of you I've found a reason
The only one I've ever known
Because of you I've got a feeling
And I don't wanna see it go, no

Now the world keeps growing older
Can you and I face it all alone

Sailing through the darkness
Seeking for the light
Don't know what my life is
Make it all right
