Cold sensations flowing on and on
My recollections almost gone
The voices that reach me leave me so confused
They come and tell me I've been used

[refrain]
Take me to the place
Where I lost my mind
I can't remember
Take me to the place
And I will try to find

Why ain't my memory telling me
what I could have done
Until it does I am on the run
And the forces of evil's lost empire
Open fire

[refrain]

Wake up screaming still I don't know why
I hear its number before I die
This final command full of hatred and desire
Open fire

[refrain]
