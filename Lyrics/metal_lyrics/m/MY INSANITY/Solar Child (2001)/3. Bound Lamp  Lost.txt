I sit on a wooden chair 
A place with cold grey walls 
The sun gives off a faint beam 
Which will be destroyed by dust 
Nothing happens, nothing 
Eyes are swollen 

You'll be bound and lost in these walls 
I don't know 
What has robbed your control 
Once more 
Rescue from the freedom 
I don't know 
You rot in your own excretions 
No one helps you 

The colour of things begins to change 
I will go sick 
No one's screaming, laughing, crying 
The skin is wrinkled 
Eyes are wide opened 
Forget all thoughts of hope 

Caught in this nowhere 
Bones will get rigid 
Motionless you lay down 
On this cold grey stone
