Do you like to follow us? 
The invitation leads to a coloured kingdom 
Do you want to talk with us? 
You have to take off your rags 

We're the unknown cuddletoys 
And live in space 
We abduct you in our empire 
You have to call us 
The kings of plush! 

We are the kings of plush 

Diamonds and pearls show us the way 
We are the friends who look nice everyday 
We transform to wizards, magicians 
Who radiate pleasurable sensations 

Is the transition accomplished 
Is the inhibition given up 
Virgins are addicted to us 
We enchant their intimacy 
Virgins are addicted to us 
Is the inhibition given up 
The transition is complete
