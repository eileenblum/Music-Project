Fog is passing through these dunes 
Little seagull trembles on the breakwater 
Behind us trees are barren 
I admire Mother Nature in her beauty 
Only the sea is living 
But very shallow - it's the dead season 

Come into my arms tonight 
I will keep you warm 
My little princess 
My baby I'll hold you tight 

Is nothing there to let us know 
In which time we are? 
Nothing that's turning around us 
A gentle breeze blows a melody 
On the withered grass which paralyzes 
A sight only for the pair on the beach 
Nevertheless - it's the dead season 

My promise - you will never lose me 
I will never leave you 
And slowly your inner sun goes down 
I can't shed your light upon
