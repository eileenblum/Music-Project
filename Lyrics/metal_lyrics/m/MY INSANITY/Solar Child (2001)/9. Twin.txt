Open the gate to a new level 
Zero point starts 2008 
My friend is me he has my genius 
What is to come for us 
We have the same girl 

Scientists duplicate me 
3, 4 or 100 times 
Fear or pleasure 

No feeling for risk, no overview 
No time, no return 
The history comes through our future 
Comes through my genetic code 

She loves me and everybody gives her my seed 
Is there a sense? 
Now it makes me sick 

We have the same girl-and she'll never know
