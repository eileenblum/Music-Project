First assembly will be a reunion 
New breeds produce old poverty 
Time finds new dimensions 
Forthcoming the beginning of the next existence 
Come fortress come 

Are we prepared for uncertainty? 
We are the mind of this machinery 
The future - the start of new mortality 

The center of energy 
A solar child will assert supremacy 
It comes from the galaxy of friendliness 
Where the sun shines 

Where flowers are in bloom 
Where birds chirp on the trees 
Where dolphins glide through the ocean 
But here there'll be no sun!
