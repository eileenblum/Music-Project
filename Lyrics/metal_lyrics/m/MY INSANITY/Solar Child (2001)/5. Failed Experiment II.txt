I could run away and hide 
I could writhe with pain 
And I'll sense you're still on my side 
And I know I could never love you 

I am the eclipse which covers up your sun 
I have authority over you which overwhelms 
I am your supervisor 

No second without your torture 
It makes me dead keen on 

Full of malicious energy 
Pleading and prayer won't help 
Instructed to devastate a soul 
For a prolonged period 

It depressed me a necessary evil 
Obsessed by the lack of clarity 
Am I the source of error? 
That's my own fault 
I waste someone's time
