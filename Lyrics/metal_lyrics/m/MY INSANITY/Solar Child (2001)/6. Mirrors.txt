Standing before a mirror 
And I put a gun to my head 
Day by day a step further into nothingness 
But now the cask is overflown 

It seems to be that there's a voice 
Speaking to me from within the glass 
I hear words that try to save me 
And tell me something about the good things in life 
Maybe I should think-over my situation? 

Suddenly I realize that mirrors cannot speak 
And I see that the light at the end of the tunnel 
Is just another train 

A growing fear is filling my inner void 
Is there another sense in life for me? 
What else can I expect for myself? 

I think I'm at the point of no return 
Now I will disappear 
This is the end 
It?s better to lose all control
