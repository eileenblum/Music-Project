I am a tender something 
Caught in a golden cage 
The wonder of new age 
Created in a moving dream - just a concept 
Years passed by - countless equations 
'Til the theory about me was created 
I broke their minds 
Even though I did not exist 
They were possessed by the dream 

No one comes close to me 
Sometimes I taste the salt from my skin 
Life goes through my mind 
I want to be damned 

I was predictably influenced 
By diabolic genius 
No one thought about possible aftereffects 
And now? 

A failed experiment 
Well, here I'm held 
Fenced in but intelligent 
None of them provides me with affection 

None of them provides me with affection 
They are afraid of me - the monster of a new age 
Sometimes I wish I was stillborn 
Sometimes I dream I was simply different
