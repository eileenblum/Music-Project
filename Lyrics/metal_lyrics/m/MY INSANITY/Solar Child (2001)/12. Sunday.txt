In the galaxy of friendliness 
The birds are still chirping 
I take a look at the beach 
Where the supervisor feeds the little seagull 

Only I can watch the whole scenery 

The solar child touches the princess 
For a moment her sun is shining bright again 
It's good to see that only through my vibes 
The equilibrium of things is intact 

The cuddletoys have some drinks with the twin 
In the pub where the tender-something works 
There's a mirror - big as a monument 
On the wall with the dolphin-wallpaper 

Only I can watch the whole scenery 
A perfect unity - all together 
I stand for recovery and harmony 
But soon a new time will come
