Hello next century - next millennium hello 
Should we be afraid 
Should you be scared of mankind 

A skin protects us but it will be a sieve 
The pores will expand fantastic gates 
We have the chance to survive or to die 
A gateway predicts new ways 

Spread out your arms - enjoy it 
Spread out your minds - be afraid 

You will sense the pressure 
You will taste our filth 
You will drop out of society 
You will suffocate on the new light 

Maybe we should hope 
We can pray - but to whom? 
Icons are useless 
Datafiles will help 
In the true sense of words 
We can exclude the mentally-ill 
Millennium means start all over again 

Spread out your arms - enjoy it 
Spread out your minds - be afraid 
And raise a monument of future
