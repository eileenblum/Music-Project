Are you excited? Why? 
You'll be the hero 
Say goodbye to your vicinity 

Look what a starlit night 
Take a seat - forward line of vision 
10 seconds - maximum adrenaline 
Look what a starlit night 

No drugs can expend the mind so strong 
Emotional outburst after a while 
Hormones gone crazy 
Massive it drills through my own galaxy 

On the verge of tears 
No mind expansion 
The first cry of fear 
It's too late for recall 

Soon it's time to start 
Say goodbye to your wife 
Say goodbye to your vicinity
