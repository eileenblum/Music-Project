I?m getting in - instinct gives me the power 
You can feel me - I am here 
I take possession of your sentiments 
An invisible veil 

The haze is organic - it's a real threat 
Possessed by ecstatic - shrouded in mysteries 

Look at her you are wild with enthusiasm 
Movement's getting uncontrolled 
It?s fun to torment with my sensual kind 
I make you blind 

If you want - call me virus 
If you can - come to terms with me 
Anytime you'll see I'm your friend 
Call me virus - if you still want 
Call me! 
Amorousness if you will see
