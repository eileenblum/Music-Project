After all a perfect pulse
Leaded in temptation again
Concentrated unstable casual
I'm strong... simply deluxe

Forgotten all the stress
Forgotten to lose conscientiousness
Lights in new dimensions
No speed control

I don't care...
How corrode is my inner side
How infirm is my mind
Leaded in temptation

Is's like a reflex
An act committed in the heat of passion
When I touch you
You beg me on my knees
You're not addicted to me
No I'm addicetd to you!

No matter how is my condition
No matter how it hurts my soul
No speed control

I don't care...
How corrode is my inner side
How infirm is my mind
Leaded in temptation

My love to you is more than the fear
I don't think about my physical decline
