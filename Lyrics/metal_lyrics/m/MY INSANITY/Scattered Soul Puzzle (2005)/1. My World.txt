I lay down naked on my world
Eyes are swollen, bones numb with the cold
My sun which gave me strength doesn't shine
I am tired of sleepiness which is not enough to sleep
An I cannot put them in order
So when I come closer, there is just a grey
Immortal remain dried up, without a face
A ghost who isn't it wants to touch me
Sieze me

Somebody tries to suffocate the good in me
I can't identify what it is
Forget the past seconds... past lifes
Where are all these scars come from
Disfiguring the beauty of my skin
Do I have the devil on tounge
Do I have the devil in my eyes
I have the devil in me

So when I come closer there is just a grey
Immortal remain dried up, without a face
A ghost who isn't it wants to touch me
Sieze me

One Trip, two pills, three lines, four
I can't stop takin' it and seaching for more
Put the needle in my head
Put the needle in my veines
I'm addicted... who cares?!
I'll ignore all the signs...

I try to write down my name in the dust
But I cant remember
See a featureless face, nameless, godless...

So when I come closer there is just a grey
Immortal remain dried up, without a face
A ghost who isn't it wants to touch me
Sieze me

Blood glued to my fingernails
I want to kiss the dusty picture in the mirror
When I come closer there is just a grey
