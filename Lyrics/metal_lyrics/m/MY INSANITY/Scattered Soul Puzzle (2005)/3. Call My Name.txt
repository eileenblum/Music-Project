Call my name
Where are you?
Call me
I fly into a rage
Call my fist in your face

I try to hide but your sensors find me faster... no matter where I am
Day by day a step closer to the end...

Get what you deserve
The pain! The blows! The mockery!
Three times I will spit on you girl!

I hate to love you
I love to hate you

Can't see your face anymore
Can't smell your perfume anymore
You should realize there is something wrong
It's like a madhouse
Unlock my door
I will waiting behind with my gun
Actual I'm sorry!
Just want to leave you
Before I'll kill you

Please forget your innocent playboy
I'm the new born hating machine... Yeah...

Get what you deserve
The pain! The blows! The mockery!
Three times I will spit on you girl!
