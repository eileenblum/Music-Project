There are running men through the streets
With broken souls
They escape from theirself
There are walking women down the streets
With broken dreams
They are on the run
There are running children through the streets
With broken necks
Escape from theirself
Birds of pray try to fly in the bloodred sky

This is the end my only friend
You don't have to understand
Just put a pretty smile
And try to fly... in the bloodred sky

There are walking robots down the streets
With broken steps
Escape from theirself
There are running animals on the streets
With broken ribs
They are on the run
There I am walking down the street
Lost identity
Escape from myself
The world behind me and see the bloodred sky
And I fly... I fly... good bye
