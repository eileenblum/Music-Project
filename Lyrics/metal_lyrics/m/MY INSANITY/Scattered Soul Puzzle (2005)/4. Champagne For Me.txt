I wouldn't sleep anywhere I couldn't speak anymore
It crushes me to death, it suffocates me
Seduce me to a new life
Bursting lips contribute my blood I just detrimental those who will love it
Rescue is out of sight
Champagne for me, salt for the rest Lick it from my filthy stinky hands
Look ahead, this is your civilisation
Should we be pleased on it, could we hate it
We wanna got the way into insanity
Without faithhealers we resell our blood an sweat I make war
You play his holiness I cannot find my peace
My soul made rich
Seduce me to a new life
Bursting lips contribute my blood I just detrimental those who will love it
Rescue is out of sight
Champagne for me, salt for the rest
Lick it from my filthy stinky hands
Look ahead...
Try to find another way I will show you that it doesn't work
Not in this generation, not in the distant future
Who cares? Nobody cares!
Transform to top it all
Lose all my favorites, lose all my visions, lose all my friends...
