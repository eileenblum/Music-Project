Slowly I start to hate this unpleasent sentiments in me
Was it all for nothing?
Was it all for me?
In faces the first, the second shock
Total zero ending
Nevertheless it was my part
To keep it alive
To keep myself alive
To keep justice alive
To keep the whole chaos alive

It seems that it was my mistake
But why now I... am I the monster?
The calm around my person is a sinner used subject
This neverending questions for the why

I have to start to assemble my scattered soul puzzle
Don't wanna moan about it
Feeling of uneasiness
How could I've be so maleformated?
To keep it alive
To keep myself alive
To keep justice alive
To keep the whole chaos alive...

Is it hate about the thirst for knowledge?
Is it hate about the goddamned species?
Is it hate of my own what give rise to mourning?

Why?
Now?
I?
Am?
The monster?
In your eyes...
