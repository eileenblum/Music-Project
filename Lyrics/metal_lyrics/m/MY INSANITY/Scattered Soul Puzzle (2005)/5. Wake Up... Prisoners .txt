So why don't you come around for a while
So why don't you stay for a while...
Hello prisoners, hello, life is too short to be true
Your faces are sticky with dried tears I don't wanna know why
Time of loneliness is over... now!
You've spent so much time in the limitation of humanity
Even enemies get friends in here
Follow the tempting sounds
Follow the leaders of the rearranged paradise
So why don't you come around for a while
So why don't you stay for a while
Where do we go?
Who will catch us if we fall?
This is the full stagnation of all our hopes
The time has come
An we hear those voices again...
Life is too true to be good
Unreal realities give us the strength to end it all up
Positive data will be out somehow
Mother earth is erased
So follow the tempting sounds
Follow the leaders of the rearranged paradise...
