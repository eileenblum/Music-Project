Here i am
Back in the dark again
A scratched mind-i'm kept in suspense
Want to run away
Come look at me. .. i'm crying
Life is so unfair to me
Every time the idiot
Without friends i die
When my time has come
No one cares
No god justifies
How its going on
How to find the sun
My inner sun

And i dream about
Touching the moon with my hand
Sometimes something is not real
Kissing a cell of my mind
Sometimes i retire my inner side
