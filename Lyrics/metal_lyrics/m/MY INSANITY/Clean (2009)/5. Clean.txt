Addicted to the systems, shock
Without you are dead
Talking to robots
Dancing with machines

Phantoms are mistaken
Mystery solution death
Craving for more limits

A trigger tor the end

Sometimes i dream...
To build my own paradise
I will build my own
And when i open up my eyes
This dream is erased
And i am old when i die

Heaven becomes clouded
Batteries are low
Vertical horizon
Acid runs out of the cells

Bathe your souls in this neon blood
It is contaminated life
Balanced on mortal remains

And i see

Everywhere just bacteria
Everywhere i see
But not here
Cause i'm clean
