The last war orphan has fallen
The last eyes are closed
Our sunlight barricades behind bloody dust
The blood on mother earth is drained away
It is cold
A silent daylight is shining

Frustrated about our blindness
Paralyzes our will
Who can gives us the power
To see beauty in this thrill
When we will see no more sorrow
When we will cry no more blood?

You and me
We have lost........remembrance
For what we mourn
No one will help us out
We see a flicker of hope in their eyes
Who sing the song of one minute silence

Nobody helps to stand upright
A final rescue is out of sight

Dreaming of freedom is eternal
No ending no light no more life

And we re standing here
Left alone

Our fathers have fallen
So we sing this song
