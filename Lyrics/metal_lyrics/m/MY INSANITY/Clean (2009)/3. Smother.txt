Running through the dark fluorescent streets
But my feet are standing still
See the ground and the grass is black
See dead eyes reflecting in cold caffeine
An empty look in a flood of information

I try to smile
But it pricks like needles on lips
Try to sleep
But what i see let rave my heart
Trembling hands
Burning sweat in my wide opened eyes
Its so cold
The day has no more time

Give me something to survive
Help

If anybody seize me
Smother in dirt
It shines like gold
Be drowned in the tears of a god

Brother please don't shot me down

Left alone, straying around talk at cross puposes
Torment with faked synthetic joy
Someone of a lot- nevertheless isolated
Down on the bottom nevertheless up high

I'm the embittered friend
Perceived by nobody else
Do you remember me
A mental disorder
In conflict with myself
Lost in thoughts
See the scars
Where is my life

Take my life in your trembling hands
Its up to you. my friend
If you shot me down
