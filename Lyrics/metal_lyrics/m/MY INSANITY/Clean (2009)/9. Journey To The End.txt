Give away your boring life
Take my hand

Follow me on the flight downwards
To an eruption

Let the things drift by incredible lust
Feel our souls crashing
Break out again and again

Let our bodies feel which we can not see
Bursting the borders
Of our imagination

Forget to breathe forget to live
Hypnotized by each other
We glide

We are like paralyzed butterflies
On a journey to the end of the line
Little children-caught in a body of lust
Like in a trance we live

Here in the deep we don t miss the sunlight
Wind like snakes in depth
Behind the horizon
A mind expanding coma
Like in a trance we live

Dive through a pool filled with warm blood
Let things drift by incredible lust
