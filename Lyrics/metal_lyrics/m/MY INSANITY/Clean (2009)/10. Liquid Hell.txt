Everything that i've done
Comes back to me
All that i gave (i don't know)
I'll get back
Now
Its nothing

It seems that no-one helps me out
I give a smile and no response
My cry for help sound like a crying infant

Is it too late?
To pay and to be?
Is it too late
To be set tree?

It gets me down
It pulls me into this liquid golden hell

One hundred thousand lingers point at my ridiculous self
One hundred thousand faces deride
Now they laughing

Sinking in my ego paradise
Human touches growing in me
I'm wondering because it hurts

Is it to late?
To pay and to be?
Is it to late
To be set free?

Try to touch the last sun i see there
When i disappear now
Nobody will remind on my ridiculous self
