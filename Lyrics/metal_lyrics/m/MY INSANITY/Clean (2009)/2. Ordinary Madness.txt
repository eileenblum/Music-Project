If my memories serve me right
We are misleaded
No way to hide
Did we waste the truth
The ordinary madness will destroy
Goldplatet chainsaw blades
We can not see a face
The truth is out of sight
We watch the sun for going blind
And we will breath the air
And we ii breath to care
The lies are in our minds
We dance with the dead to see the light now

And i want to the other side
To have the birds around me
Searching tor a peace in quiet
And i walk to the other side

Searching for a peace in quiet
Fly in neverending circles
I want to see myself
In the security of lies
Blindness against reality
The dead decorates our showcase of lust
A faked smile as a killers facade
We cannot see the bottom of an hell

We'll breath the air
We'll breath to care
We'll drink clear water
We'll drink our blood
