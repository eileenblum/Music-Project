I'm on the way back to my downfall
Race along through a purple shining forest
Where you cast a spell on me

Dancing arms of the trees try to delay me
But i'm like in trance
Hunting for the glitter place
Come closer.....closer
To see...

Surrounded by your negativity
And when i run away you force me to my knees
You ignore all i have begged tor
Want to sever from your insanity

Why don t you let me go back in isolation
I wish i would be free again in my life
Why don t you let me defend
In loneliness again
I wish you don t rape my mind

Fascinated i stare at your skin
And try to subdue myself
But i can t
Catch your black tears
Clear my mind with it

Surrounded by your negativity
And when i run away you force me to my knees
You ignore all i have begged tor
Want to sever from your insanity

In a trance
Focused the curse
Indecent
You try to touch
I want to sever this
Insane you force me back to my knees again

Black trap of temptation
In a feminine form
Nailed on the cross
Close to death
I thought i want
To rescue this
Beautiful live
Out of this nightmare
Follow me
In a zone of twilight....
