Neverending times, I wait for a cleansing rain
The sun is burning on my head - in myself
Endless days, I'm dreaming of a calming water
I'll be drowned in the blessed aquavine

Flight on a summer day
A taste of eternity
The smell of fortune cleans my mind

A dream was born in a night
No tears without hope
A dream of an endless life
Empty feelings they're digging in my mind

From the tower I feel the deep
Alone on the top, now I see
I'll be down to my fear
No way to return, and I fly...
