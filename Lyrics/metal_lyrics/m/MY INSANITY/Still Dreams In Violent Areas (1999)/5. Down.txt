Gray days of past
Could colors decide about life ?
Gray heavens forecast the ruin
The race to survive takes not a look at us

One step and it's over
Dread is the zone which separates us
The waves getting higher
In one moment my life will go to the end
Over is the time of hate and regret
Nothing is like in the past
Hear and believe
Warm colors
You can see
Without fear of darkness

Crying fall, I'm down
I live my life without you
Feeling alone until the end

A big ocean will take our souls
This is the sea of the unknown
We had learned to avoid this water
But it led us into temptation
