It's a hole in my head - anywhere
A gate to another world
In my mind, I do the things
They make me dreaming and alive
Just in the frame of time
Here in my own old sign
Feel the real, that you can understand

Close my eyes the dark is back
I see the world so clean and light
The universe it's liken a worm
A worm in my mind

Close my eyes
See deep in myself
I fall in a hole - an endless fall
Deep down in the ground of my dreams
My fear ending in own reality
