I look around me
The walls are gray
A mirror shows my wounded skin
The glass is smashing though the air
Thousand shards cutting my face
The pain in my head is destroying the good of my life

In the castle of the insane
Feel delicious domain
Returning never to the blame
Enjoy the tolerance of shame
The castle of the insane

A place without souls
A place you can listen to fearful screams

Inside the walls nothing is real
Nothing can stop the insanity
We're alone with our pain
Rescue us out the walls of the insane

In their minds a burning fire
The black crows flying around the tower
Glowing stones falling down
And they enter into eternal life
