It's one o'clock in the night
Doors make tremendous noise

This is the night of the night
Come in our world of neverending might
Follow odor of fire
Come in our world of neverending might
You wake up - sweat on the forehead
And think here was a real voice
Strong wind blows through the cracks
Of those old walls

Supernatural force will get you in a new life
Animals are like - human - are like animals
You'll try to escape from other creatures
Devour or be devoured
This is our only one law

You should know
This is the end
Nobody survives this ruin
Here are all occupants of this house
And they want to get you too
