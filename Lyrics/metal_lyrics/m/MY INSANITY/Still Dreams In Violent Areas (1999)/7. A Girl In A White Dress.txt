A girl in a white dress
The light moonshine, on her virgin body
Only one hundred steps
And I can see her eyes

My heart beats faster and faster
But all of a sudden she turns back

Why I live in this world
The wishes don't come true
I was so sick
That's why they hate me

The dreams of this girl
They will kill me
Minds turn around an adventure
An experience that I had in this night

One day my dreams come true
But it was short lived
She was not alone
A man of better looks
Took her hand
And I took my life as I leaped from the bridge
