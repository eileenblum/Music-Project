Look at me - can't see behind the wall
See my mask - tells tales of its own
Frames of love - feelings of emptiness
Let you dream - will save yourself

Pleasant is your smile
Pleasantly sleeps your soul
Pleasant is your love
Pleasantly sleeps your hate

Laugh to oneself, burn the smile on your face
Will remind you and show you all the blame
You're so sick in your hope to another way
Always do the things again - you're in pain

You're still by me - don't look for a better chance
Sunk in luck - motions like an absent minded dance

Autumn was time for the unholy
Slowly they'll rot
Things were pretty lively
Before it stands a new cross
