Your words in my skull
Just hypocrisy
Only a living forgery
In your eyes I see the real picture
Shows me the mortal creature

The darkness in my mind
Is just a kind of light
The lightning in my eyes
Tells the story about that

Your broken mask
Where you will hide
Can make it out
Who you are
I'll find your real face so aged
No morbid faith
Will come to heal

I grow blind
The prison of your mind
My dead eyes
See the delivering light
Now listen to me
That what I can see
You are strong in your words
What you preach is only dirt
