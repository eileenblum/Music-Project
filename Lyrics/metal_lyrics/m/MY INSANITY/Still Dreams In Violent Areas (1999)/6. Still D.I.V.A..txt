Is there a time you can better dream ?
Is there a time you can see the moon ?
Is there a time you can live your lust ?
Is there a time you can feel the angel dust ?
Have you felt the majestic silence
When you close your eyes at night
There is infinity 'n vastness
Nobody knows where good and evil exists

In the night begins the propagation
We would die without the night
This is the way of human destination
Without the moon and all the mysteries
Of the universe
