Do I want to die?
I have questioned my life's worth
A thousand times
Still nothing but a joyless smile
An inner feeling of defeat
Tears me up inside
Spat out

It's true what they say
Never judge a book by its cover
You don't know me one bit
As much as you think
My pain boils beneath the surface
Leaving you to think that
Everything's alright

I'm on the verge of collapse
My mind is ground zero
It's the place where your future's your past
Pronounced dead at the scene
I'm living out a nightmare
Not embracing the dream

On the verge of collapse
Chewed up spat out

I am so good at being somebody else
You don't know
I keep it hidden
Every day it takes its fucking toll
I'm sick of fighting this alone
What have I done to deserve this
I don't know

I can't begin to tell you how this feels
To see the world through my eyes
It's like a noose around my neck

You don't know
I keep it hidden
Every day it takes its fuckin' toll
I'm sick of fighting this alone
What have I done to deserve this
I don't know
Infatuated with how I'll meet my end
Resurrecting demons that won't stay dead
Tear it all down
