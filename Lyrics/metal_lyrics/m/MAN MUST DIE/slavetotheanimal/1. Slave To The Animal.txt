Stand your ground
Accept the challenge
Join the ranks of the proud
Determination, the animal instinct
Primal survival wins

My need to fight
Comes from deep inside
A fire rages
Can't extinguish the flames
Destroy the enemy
The name of the game

Victory is mine
And I'll show you what I've known all this time
I'll snatch your crown right in front of you
Disconnect your head from your spine
There's never been a more worthy king

Time has taken its toll and
Your will is weak but
Mine is like stone

You can try but there is no way you'll defeat me
You better go home

There's only one rule I live by
Kill thy enemy
Kill thy enemy

Carving my name in the books of history
To question my reign is an act of blasphemy
Conquer all waterfall
Carving my name in the books of history
To question my reign is an act of blasphemy
Conquer all

Mind is set to kill and there's no escape for me
It's the thrill
Systematic release of rage
Feeding off the fear that you feel

I'll trample on your feeble dreams
Forced up off the throne
Now it's time to face your demons alone
Every time that you speak my name
You'll remember to lower your tone

No one can match my will to win
My will to win
My will to win

Carving my name in the books of history
To question my reign is an act of blasphemy
Conquer all waterfall
Carving my name in the books of history
To question my reign is an act of blasphemy
Conquer all waterfall

[2x]
You could never know
Just what it takes to be beaten
And still come back for more
It's in my veins
It's my code of survival

Slave to the animal

You could never know
Just what it takes to be beaten
And still come back for more
It's in my veins
It's my code
It is my code

Carving my name in the books of history
To question my reign is an act of blasphemy
Conquer all waterfall
Carving my name in the books of history
To question my reign is an act of blasphemy
Conquer all waterfall

Slave to the animal [4x]
