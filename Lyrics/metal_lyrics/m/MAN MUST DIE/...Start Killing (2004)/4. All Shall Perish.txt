Crooked fuckin slime
Bleed the motherfuckers dry
Misleading false intentions
So weak in mind you need to follow
The cause of all our global tensions
Nothing left but to count the death toll
Money their reason to lie
Eliminate

I question your faith holy man
Inhalation the ruin of this nation
Blinded by fear
Your quest in life so meaningless
Brainwashed to survive
This design to confine
The greatest tale ever told
Our way of life they can't control
Made to suffer
Concealed behind a mask of false faith

You live by it, die by it
Deny the very things that  make you who
you are Distorted, diluted
What you once were now just a memory
Contradiction
Your beliefs based on a means to control
So open your eyes
Ignorance is bliss
Christianity is proof

We all shall perish
Concealed behind a mask of false faith
We all shall perish
Devoted to this sick fuckin life
Corrupter of truth
Denier of life
Destroyer of the senses
Your tradition forged from fear

Conceived to keep on fuckin us down
We all shall perish
Concealed behind a mask of false faith
We all shall perish
Devoted to this sick fuckin life

The sign of the cross is a lie
I burn it in front of you
Blinded by eternal light
Condemned to this punishment
In ruins your empire shall burn
Under my own command

Your words filled with lies
I despise the very ground that you
tread I never will cur come to your ways
I'm no disciple

Abomination
The blood of millions spilled invain
And your god's to blame
To stupid to realise your book is the
reason that people die. I want your 
blood on me
