A misconception
A fatal flaw inside this machine
To see the world dying now
Is my only dream

I've tried so hard
To be like everybody else
But my hate implodes
Right back in on myself

I can't even try
I don't know why
I want to take your fuckin life

My dark reflection 
Your fear injection
You cannot run from your fate
Another target to eliminate
An object of fascination
You're a vicitm of mind dissection

I've realised
That I despise
The taunting gleam in my eyes
Faint figure in black
I fear the face that gazes right back

I am pure death
Inside this flesh
Heart made of stone
My true force is unknown
Unleash this pain
From you I drain
The last drop of blood inside of you

Shrouded in a cloak made of your flesh
Despair a feeling you shall ingest in time
My carnivorous lust will arise
Now look upon my vacant eyes

I've realised
That I despise
The taunting gleam in my eyes
Faint figure in black
I fear the face that gazes right back

Faint figure in black

Images of pain that you cannot describe
It's you I have chosen
For my gallery of inhuman sights
Your cries for help won't make you die faster
As I desecrate your fuckin flesh
I am your master

Death my only hope of salvation
