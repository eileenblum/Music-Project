Strangulation my chosen way of killing you slowInside a maniac and there's no way of turning backThe time, the reason for the crimeBetraying my own trustI never could control my urgesDescend on themI'll come just like a plagueA dark prophet of miseryDenied any love as a childTo kill everythingIs what keeps me alive It keeps me alive Sickest fuck the world has ever knownNo one can touch me I reclaim my throne If you look in these eyesYou'll see death in disguiseAn image of blasphemyPure blood destroyer of lifeI'll tear your soul apartMy dripping works of art Come visit my mindIn the depths you only will findMurder and hatred boiling insideMurder Shaping death in my own design Moulding death into desireLost touch of all realityYears of abuse to fuel the fireI have no control Start Killing!!! The time has come for meTo let the pain flow freeTrapped beneath my insanityYou can not run away from fateNow this is the endOf your pitiful existence No remorse a valid lesson once learnedThat's all I need to set me free from hell Now this is the end Strangulation my chosen way of killing you slowInside a maniac and there's no way of turning backThe time, the reason for the crimeBetraying my own trustI never could control my urges A lesson once learnedIs never forgotten
