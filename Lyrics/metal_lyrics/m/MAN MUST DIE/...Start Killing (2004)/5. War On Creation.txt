I see in my dreams
The end prophecy
Our world will die
And we helped kill it
Now nothing remains within
Nothing left but fear inside
Empty are my dreams

Redemption is over now
All life leaves my body
Never to realise
Redemption is over now
Abstract misery

I see the day when everything 
Will crumbles away
I fear the day when everything fades out

I've seen things so ugly
If only you could see
The anguish born inside me
Our morbid destiny
You can't escape the terror
That lies in store for you
No one can help you now
Pure death equality

I see the day when everything 
Will crumbles away
I fear the day when judgement will
Reign down
Our last chance and we fucked it
We must face death now head on
Replaced now with nothing
Just a relic of mass destruction
Tormented by the visions
These twisted premonitions
I see every time that I sleep

Creation is here
Damnation is here
Ablation is here
