Here
Stand helpless, alone in this world
Panic stricken as I hear the key in the door
His world a place of failure and rage
My world of mental and physical pain
I've tried to understand through time
Why these images of my death
Consume my mind
I can't face up
Can't block it out
I must move on now
And destroy this worthless life
Smothered, silenced
My visions of death now engraved
I have been blessed with the suicide gene
On your knees again
Just another pointless waste
Of everybodies time
OBEY!
Suicide
Nobody gave a fuck to see the signs
Suicide
Nobody gives a fuck until you die
You'll grace the side of my grave
With a look on your face
Like you never expected this
I still bare the scars on my face
Where you used your fist
How could you do this to me?
I was your only son
This pain will plague you forever a constant reminder
Of what you are
A piece of shit
That beat his kid
I hope you die a thousand times
Smothered, silenced
My visions of death now engraved
I have been blessed with the suicide gene
(On your knees again)
This pain will plague you forever
And it won't end
Suicide
Nobody gave a fuck to see the signs
Suicide
Nobody thought to question why
Suicide
