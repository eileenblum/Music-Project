Two bit looser
Fucked up from the get go
Playing god to a herd of useless assholes
Devastation the only true conclusion
Keeps us further away from the solution
The solution is your death
I am the cure
Be gone heathen
The scorcher of the skies
Casting shadows
The weak are left to die
Streets are stained with blood
In a shallow unmarked grave
You lie forgotten
This choice you never made
I don't know why I bother
I don't know why I give a fuck
Eliminate the human race
Past the point of no return
Only pain remains
I don't know why I bother
I don't know why I give a fuck
What difference can it make?
A vision of our fate
Eliminate the human race
No excuse for ignorance
I can't pretend to even care
I refuse your influence
A vacant space you left bare
Body piles
Death in the streets
A child cries
With nothing to eat
First born son sent off to war
A folded flag isn't worth dying for
Past the point of no return
Only pain remains
We are all slaves [x4]
