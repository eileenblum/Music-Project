It's etched upon every single face
You tried to bring us down
But you fucking failed
How does it feel to have it
Rubbed in your face?
For years we took your shit
I hope you choke on this
Backstabbing motherfuckers
Your scene is a joke
Too all the doubters
Stand up, take a bow
You try to hide the envy in your eyes
I know it's burning you alive inside
I know you're busy planning for the backlash
One you crossed that line you can't turn back
Now you've burnt your bridges
You know this is for you
And your minions
Elitist - You want to see us fail
Elitist - You know you never will
Elitist - You never made the grade
Elitist - Stay away
You try to hide the envy in your eyes
I know it's burning you alive inside
I know you're busy planning for the backlash
One you crossed that line you can't turn back
You'll spend your life living in my shadow
Take a good hard look at what you've become
You wish this was you
But you'll never make the fucking grade
