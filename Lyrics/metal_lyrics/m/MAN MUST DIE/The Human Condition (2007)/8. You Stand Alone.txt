I take the pain away
I falsify the reasons you are alive
I am you soul betrayed
The path of least resistance
Was yours to take
You led yourself into the grave
Now face the evidence
You led yourself into the grave
This war has just begun
I'll take the pain away
You demonstrate lack of discipline
Only the strong survive
Your end is fucking now
Fuck your system
Take it all away
Beg now forgiveness
Keep on crawling
You can't help yourself
Bring forth the fucking pain inside
You stand alone in the aftermath of my redemption
Now the truth unfolds
You will never escape the suffering
A choice to make
Make it now
Put yourself right
Stay clear from the influence
Be strong in your mind
I have always been
The voice inside your mind
I will always be there You will rob your mother
Tap the vein
Watch your life slip away
Fuck your system
Take it all away
Be now forgiveness
Keep on crawling
