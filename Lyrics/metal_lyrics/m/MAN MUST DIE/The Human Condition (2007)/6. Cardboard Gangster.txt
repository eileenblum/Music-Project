Take a look at his life
A failure reprised
Blackened rings surround his eyes
Hardman, hard lines
A walking monolith of lies
You have nothing
You are nothing
Just leave me be
Swollen right hand
Lets fucking go
Fighting the battle
We go toe to toe
Your whole life
Flashes right before your eyes
Now it's time for you to swallow your pride
You can't take away
What isn't yours to take
Can't take away what is mine
You have nothing
You are nothing
Just leave me be
Bleeding baiting the trap
Now you're wanted
A reputation
A cardboard gangster
Always running
This is my last chance to change
Into the wasteland you call life
The battle was fought and lost this time
The body weakens as the mind begins to die
In the absence of our fathers [x2]
You can't take away
What isn't yours to take
Can't take away what is mine
This is my confessional
This is my last chance to change
This is my confessional
This is my last chance to change
