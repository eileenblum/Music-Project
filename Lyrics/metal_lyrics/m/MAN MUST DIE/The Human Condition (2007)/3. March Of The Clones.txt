Fuck those posers
It's here today and gone tomorrow
Just another fucking phase
Regurgitate and swallow
Your scene bled dry
Over saturated
With a clone design
Take what's mine make it yours
To make a profit you fucking whores
I'm sick of it, fuck your trend
I cannot wait for this to end
In the end you're just another soulless fake
This is the end of the line
How much longer can they
Milk this shit for?
This is a war
Fuck those posers
Your scene bled dry
Over saturated
With the clone design
Take what's mine make it yours
To make a profit you fucking whores
I'm sick of it, fuck your trend
I cannot wait for this to end
In the end you're just another soulless fake
It disgusts me everytime
That i see your face
It blinds my eyes
Destroy - the march of the clones
Our separation we have to enforce
We will enforce
Destroy the march of the clones
Eradication with no remorse
With no remorse
