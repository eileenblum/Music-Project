This life owes you nothing
Stop sitting with your hand out
No responsibility
You claim poverty every fucking day
Fear, all I see is fucking fear
In your your eyes
Take a step outside your door into the real world
I can't trust you
With anything
Every day
Spent living in a fucking bubble
Ignore the strains
The undisputed facts of life
Awake for days
In trance-like states
Paranoid
Disconnected
From reality
The burdens of life
Claustrophobia, the walls are closing in on me
Looking at your face
Makes me want to take a hammer to your fucking knees
Fear, all i see is fucking fear
In your eyes
Take a step outside your door into the real world
Like a gunshot tot he face
The harsh reality washes over you
No one to wipe your ass
And tell you that it's all OK
NO! It's not OK
I'm sick of your shit
And I'm not the only one
Top of the hate list
Your time has come
Get up
Stand on your feet
I will not carry you
Get up
Stand on your feet
About fucking time you taught yourself to
Every day
Spent living in a fucking bubble
Ignore the strains
The undisputed facts of life
NO! it's not OK
Awake for days
In trance-like states
Paranoid
Disconnected
From reality
The burdens of life
