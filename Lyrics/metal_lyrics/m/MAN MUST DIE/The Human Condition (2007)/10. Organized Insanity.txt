I am your destroyer
Crucify the wretched fucking swine
I am the hate installer
Turn and face the face of the enemy
Have we gone blind?
Now slaves to the grind
Breeding mass genocide
Nowwhere to hide
Our system is flawed
Corrupting our purest thoughts
Leading astray
A life style born of pain
I am your destroyer
Crucify the wretched fucking swine
I am the hate installer
Turn and face the face
Of destroyer
Fear beyond fear the siren bursts my ears
War, but whose war?
I don't care anymore
It's a vicious game of life and death [x2]
Of life and death
Hunting, killing
Nowhere to hide
It's your time
Freedom
A fucking joke
Freedom
False words they spoke
Freedom
There's no such feeling
Organized insanity
Sending children to mass graves
Where we going to be when the shit falls through?
Stupid motherfucker we can see right through you
Always thinking you're a step above
I could kill you and I wouldn't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck
It's a vicious game of life and death [x2]
Of life and death
Watch as I take life away
This is the end for you, me and everybody else
