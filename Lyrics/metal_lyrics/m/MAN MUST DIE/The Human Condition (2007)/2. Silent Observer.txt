Pointless, bullshit
No concept of pride
Conversations a total waste of time
I hate you, I despise you
You make me sick
To my fucking guts
I hate you, I despise you
You make me sick
Starve them all
Watch profits soar
Dollar signs
Big corporate minds
Play deadly games with our lives
We are not free from their sedative
Live the lie
Never could, never would
Hope denied
Choose your own path
Pointless, bullshit
No concept of pride
Conversations a total waste of time
Shut up, stop talking
Shut your mouth you stupid cunt
You think they give a fuck about you?
Better think again
This war is for them
The end is almost here
I will stand strong
I have something that you
Will never possess
Freedom
I will watch as they lower you into the dirt
Breathing
Lies
You'll never
Stand up and fight
For the ones you betrayed
