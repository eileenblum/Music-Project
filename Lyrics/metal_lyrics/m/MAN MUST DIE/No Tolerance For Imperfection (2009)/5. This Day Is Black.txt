Are you listening?
Every day's like the end of the world.
Relived through tired eyes.
Remember this day is black.
Put an end to the suffering, a never ending crusade.
I feel challenged by nothing.
Watch karma devour its prey.
This time I'll do it my own way.
And plain fuck all those who oppose me.
I am the arsonist and architect a contradiction.
A revelation.
Self loathing is one thing that I know all too well.
I see the pig inside us all and it makes me fuckin sick.
I've opened my eyes now it's time for you to do the same.
I'm only human, after all, how much can one man take?
I refuse forgiveness from the big man.
Sing hail hail the king is here.
Take a look inside.
Life and death entwined.
Emotional exile.
All hope abandoned.
Shut up, stand down.
You're no god.
Stand and we'll fight it.
We won't be divided.
speak your mind right now or shut your mouth.
When everything is said and done, I can rejoice in the fact that I'm not the only one crawling back.
I will never come crawling back.
I am alive!
