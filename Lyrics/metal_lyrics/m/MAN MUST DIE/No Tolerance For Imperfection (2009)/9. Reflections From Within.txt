I look inside for the answers to my sins.
The termination of self respect and pride, denied I've got no place to hide.
You projected your failures and fears onto me.
Nothing's the same, you taught me how to hate.
And for that I will never forgive you.
And for that I will never believe you.
You will never know what you have put me through.
This is death without mourning.
Today's the day that I turn and face the truth.
I can't stand the thought of becoming you.
The pain remains, my mirror image changed.
You projected your failures and fears onto me.
Nothing's the same, you taught me how to hate.
And for that I will never forgive you.
And for that I will never believe you.
My will is something you cannot break.
My need to defy.
Reflections from within.
You will never know what you have put me through.
This is death without mourning.
You left me for dead.
Tell me I am wrong.
All the things you have said will no longer hurt me or fuck my mind anymore than you have already.
Give me a sign.
This is where it ends.
You will never know what you have put me through.
Time has come for me to fuckin kill you!
