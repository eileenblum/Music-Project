Self-awareness rules your life.
Incisions made under the knife.
Disregard your self-respect.
Man made monster. Disconnect your brain, just let it go.
Learning from a TV screen is all you know.
Obsessed with how you want to look.
And how you are perceived.
You'd trade it all, mind body and soul for fame.
Alter your body, even change your name.
It's not who you are it's who you blow.
Your self-respect pissed away in one go.
You think they give a fuck?
You think they even care?
There's plenty more where you came from.
Please take a chair.
The path to hell's paved with your intentions.
A plastic rack and fake hair extensions.
Dreams come undone!
Left in constant agony through surgery.
Demonstrating lack of integrity.
A cocaine nosebleed and a head full of bad memories.
Never ending downward spiral.
The lights are on but nobody's at home.
Starve yourself, there's nothing left but skin and bone.
So ugly on the inside you can't bear to look at yourself.
Down and out.
Blood splattered angel.
Dreams are left unfound.
I want to tell you something.
Your kind's a fucking disgrace.
In their world there is NO TOLERANCE FOR IMPERFECTION.
