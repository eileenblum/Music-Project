A beautiful and terrible divinity
Runs through the sky
Runs through the earth
Vomiting flames

Smoking like a volcano
Falls on the hills
Devours the plains
He's over the abyss

Hidden in the deep caves
He choses his followers
Shows the truth
Extinguishes the sin

On revenger power of the human
Get to you consecrated
Our songs
And our offerings
