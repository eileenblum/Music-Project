You get my daring songs
I call on you,oh Satan
Come back with your psalms
Oh love master

In the substance that never stops
King of phenomenom
King of form
Lives only Satan

At the tremolos lighten
Of his eternal lock
Is the empire
That attracts the ones that turn away

In the presence of yours
Tremble the powerful symbols
Fall down the mitres and crowns
From the cloister comes
Threatening your rebelion
