Act like simple human animal
Leave your appetites
Hate your enemies from the bottom of your heart
And, if hit you, destroy him

Why?

Blessed are the strong
Damned the weak
Blessed are the powerful
Damned the impotents

Blessed are the haughties
Damned the humbles
Blessed are the winners
Damned the losers

Blessed are the hards at heart
Damned the poor of spirit
Blessed is the material world
Damned the spiritual world

What we preach is just
What men already do
Whether we call it Satanism or not
Our religion don't beg for followers
