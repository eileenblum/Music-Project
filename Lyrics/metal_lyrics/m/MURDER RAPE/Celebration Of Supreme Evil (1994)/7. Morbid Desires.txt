I fell life escape from my hands
I can't control my senses
I'm slave from a power I don't know
But for it I feel a morbid pleasure

Looking through the mirror
I see the decomposed face
Of one who just began to live
But,fell the bitter taste of death
Lost between strange face
I know someone looks for me
Controlling me by a morbid desire
That brings me into the mirror

Morbid desires
Make part of my vision
I see myself as a strange
In a world that isn't mine

I feel the power that controls me
I feel it crow inside
I feel it with my morbid desires
That brings me to the end
