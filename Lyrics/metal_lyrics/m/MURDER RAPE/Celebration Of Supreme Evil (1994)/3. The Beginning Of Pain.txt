Time is come
And when the deads
Be eating up their deads
The end will be near

Cos not even
Burring their deads
The deads will be

Starvation will corrode the bowels
Of the survivors
And their sickness will be evident
But won't healed

Pain and desperation
Will run through the trails
And the mother
Will kill her son

And it will be only
The beginning of pain
