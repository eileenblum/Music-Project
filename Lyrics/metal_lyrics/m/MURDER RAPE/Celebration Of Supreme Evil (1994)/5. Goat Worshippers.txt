You the wisest
And the most sublime of Angels
Prince of exile
With whom Jehovah was unfair

You,who give the creatures
Vaghe fantasies
The cult of reason
And love for agonies

Lord of exileds
Inspiration of inventor
Confessor of criminals
And conspirators

Praise at you
Oh, Satan
Oh, Major
Oh, Rebellion

It's you we worship
Not the tyranny of Jehovah
Guide us to your light
Mark us with your black sign
