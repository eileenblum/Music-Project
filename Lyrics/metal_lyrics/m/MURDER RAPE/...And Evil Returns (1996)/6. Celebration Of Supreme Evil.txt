"Oh Might Light and burning flame
Let it unveil thee glory
Unveil the mysteries of your creation
In the name of Satan
Whose sustenance will prevail"
From the cloister comes threatening the rebellion
Come forth great spawn of the abyss
And make thy presence manifest from deep and
The abyss shall come a sign
And vision shall become as reality
I call upon the messengers
Come forth in the name of Abbadon
Join us in our fraternity
And destroy the race of weaks
Oh, Great Brothers of the night
Join us in our power
In behalf of the ones who own the power
The True Worshippers of the Horned God
We celebrate the Eternal Evil
We are strong and we are beside the strongs
We celebrate Thy Supremacy We sing the
Most deep canticles
We exalt and honour Thy Presence
