When dark night comes
When silence invades the soul of the warrior
Only one voice echoes
Sounds the message deep from the abyss
We are the messengers of doom
Hidden by the full moon
We bring a mission
To rescue the respect for our ancestrals
We Great All the Elements
Dimmed by the long wait today we are free again
Our hate is free against the ones
Who betrayed us
We are at war again
For the Honour
For the Glory
For the Eternal Power
Honour Blood
Proud
Desire is the way that brings us to revenge
All the power is reached
Respect is again a gift for the strong ones
Ours mission is getting clonclued
