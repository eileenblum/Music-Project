March strong
Forwar Black Warriors
Get off the shadows, leave the chaos
Walk among us
Black Metal
Sentries of the Damned Empire
Let sound the melancholy melody
Forwar... War
Black Metal - Hymn for Warriors
Black Metal - The most true feelings
The flag is raised
Listen Warriors;
Our blood is noble
Nothing can stop us
Neither their laws
Nor their galse gods
Cos there is no salvation in chaos
Just spread our war
We are warriors of the Evil Horde
Nothing is so real and so strong
As the feeling we have
Our reign doesn't get intimidated before weaks
We are Damned taken as barbarians
We are just the brave survivors
From the empire of weaks...
