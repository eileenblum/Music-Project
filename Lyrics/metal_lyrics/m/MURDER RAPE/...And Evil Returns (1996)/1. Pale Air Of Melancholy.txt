In the most deep and absolute darkness
In the depths of the true abyss
That hides the most perverse desire
Under the pale air of melancholy
Shines the essence of pain
Pain and hate
Are the only presents for humanity
Pain and hate are their only memories
Pain, being live and felt
The most primary of feelings
Being consumed by the desire of surmounting
Hate, my eternal way by my side
We are eternal fellows
Pain and hate
Are the only presents for humanity
Pain and hate are their only memories
This is my dominion
Guided by the flame of anguish
I search for consolation deep in the abyss
Where the eternal laws are ruled by the only Lord
Pain and hate are the essence of Evil
Revenge and hate are the reasons that keep me living
