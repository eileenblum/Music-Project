United by the force
Of the co salled dark fraternity
Under the sign of glory
We'll triumph again
Guided by hate
Fed with the truth
Calling again the ancient man
Where the choice is made and the
Strong one, acclaimed
Under the vast shadow
Walks the chosen one
Where the night is just
The beginning of this glory
At the limits of dawn
Where no human being has dreamed to reach
Proud there he is
Strong, just mediating
To triumph in his plan
The law is present
The equilibrium is kept
The elements make their presence
All purity is maintained
Nothing changes the law of the strong one
