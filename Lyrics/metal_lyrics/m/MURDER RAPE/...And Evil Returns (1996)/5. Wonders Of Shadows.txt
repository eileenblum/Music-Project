In the shadows of night
In the woods Under the full moon
The only noise that fills the emptiness
Is the melancholy howl of wolves
Deep in the woods
Where I can find all my creatures
Come forth nocturnal creatures
Let the silence speak for you
Find out consolation deep in the woods
Where pain gives place to melancholy
In the night
In the woods
In the shadows
Of full moon
The howl of wolves
Is a comfort for my ears
Only in the shadows of night
I meet my creatures
Where we make the law
For a New Kingdom
In the night
In the woods
In the shadows
Of full moon
