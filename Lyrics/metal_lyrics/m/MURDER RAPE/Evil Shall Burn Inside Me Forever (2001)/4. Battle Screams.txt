For the sign of the hammer
... In memory of the ancient God
I invoke your power
God of War

Master of brutality
We march against time
Waiting for the war cry
Where the drums make the laws
Announcing one more battle

Screams of Pain!!!
Panic and devastation
Chaos and disorder
Now take possession of this weak empire

Ruled by the macabre symphony
We march between rotten corpses
Where the smell of death made its reign and its dwelling

War!! Extermination!!

The soldiers of the New Order
March under the laws of the Ancient Empire
We are the incarnation of the Empire of One Thousand Years
