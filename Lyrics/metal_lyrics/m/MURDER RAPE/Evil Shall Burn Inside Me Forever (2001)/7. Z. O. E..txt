Depression and pain
Reflections of memories massacred by time
Desperation and hate...
Forgotten memories, but forever alive
(you are and you know who I am)

Depression and pain
Hidden inside us
Sorrow, melancholy...

Death, chaos and pain
Ruins of the temple of salvation
Shadows of paradise

Only pain feeds me
Consoled by the flagellum
The flagellum of solitude
Consoled by your memory
