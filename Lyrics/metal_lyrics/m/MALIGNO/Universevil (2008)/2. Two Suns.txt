Holy mountains dancing clouds
Black avenger labyrinths
In the horizon I see the sun
On th horizon truth has gone

Seeds of blindness waking call
Mortal soil thats rotting down
In the mist that thrills your shadow falls  
Emptiness of drowning Dreams 

I have no real pain 
Illusions that kill your mind

Born from gods the devils own
Memories are lost and drown
I take my power from the sun 
Victims of the shadow's hole

I have no real pain 
Illusions that kill your mind

Tow suns will never blind
These eye will never cry
The light burns the odd 
The storm that cleans the mud
