Different voices that come 
Form inside
Sweating brain 'cause you don't know
The answer
looking back I saw your life so disgraceful
Eating misery from that oldest legion 

If you don't seek you don't deserve the light
Luck is the minimum thing to achieve
Living and waiting sitting and worthless
Waiting for your luck
Wait is to fall 

Well I think is not important to tell you 
That your fears are your threatening hell
Smell your sweat now is time to reveal you 
where you going to stay forever
Looking back I saw your life's so disgraceful
Eating misery from that oldest legion 

If you don't seek you don't deserve the light
Luck is the minimum thing to achieve
Living and waiting sitting and worthless
Waiting for your luck
Wait is to fall 

See me crying for cheating your dreams 
Se me laughing at you and your sins 
You're not going to heaven
