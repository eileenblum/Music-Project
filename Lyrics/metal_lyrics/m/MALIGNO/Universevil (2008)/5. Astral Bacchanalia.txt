Upper dimensions where the spirits drone
ancestral knowledge that no man has known
A masterful secret the terror withholds
Astral bacchanalia the flames of the sun

When theres no end, no beginning
Lunatic exposure the universe dwell 
Demential majesty planets collide
Empty solutions the oceans in black

Show me the answer
Bring me the answer
Drunken abraxas
The call of the sun

Birds on fire eternal pyre
Traveling elsewhere  spreading the word
Breaking the sorrow next blasting hollow
The last attraction elixirs of good

Wild and the mystics the goddess conspiracy
Cursed by the amazing empires of dust
Empty solutions the oceans in black
Cult of the winter the darkest demise

Show me the answer
Bring me the answer
Drunken abraxas
The call of the sun
