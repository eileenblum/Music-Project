Long awaited bath of blood
Can't resist anymore
Fight for what for, scattered skies
Trust no one, evil eyes

I try to see beyond the storm of lies
Evolution consciousness, a state of mind

Great golden demons 
Kings of confusion
Fear is their weapon
Fall living in fear
Stand up again

High silent lake
My sacred brew
Turn into light 
Finding the truth
