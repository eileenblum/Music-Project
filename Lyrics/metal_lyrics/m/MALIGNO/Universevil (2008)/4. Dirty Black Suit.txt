Let go
Don't come here and try 
Back off
Talking shit in front of
All your deceit masters
I won't
Be the one who carries
That  weight son because
I learned how to spit 
The face of bullshit bastards

So you think you're the king
On your dirty black suit
Trying hard you approach 
To become understood
In your circles of power you think
You control
But you don't

So now
Felling down no more... son
Much to be ashamed for
You know
You don't act like you walk
Richest man in the graveyard
My friend
You can scream shame on you now but can't buy me now
So poor felling rich on your coat of of that dirty black suit

So you think you're the king
On your dirty black suit
Trying hard you approach 
To become understood
In your circles of power you think
You control
But you don't

You kill just for your own ambition

Destroy to win is your decision

Your heart is turned so miserable
