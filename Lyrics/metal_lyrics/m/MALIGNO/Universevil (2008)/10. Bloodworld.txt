Wandering about this
A bloodworld before my eyes

Listen to my inner feelings
Don't need to be a prophet
To know whats going to happen

It takes a little time to be
Just need to pick some button on ourselves
To feel the hanger a faster heartbeat
The fear inside
Every worry every thought
Every feeling materialized

It's one on the inside or the outside
Or is just the people fear
It's one on the inside or the outside
Or is just the people fear
It's one on the inside or the outside
Or is just my own fear

Bloodworld

Listen to my inner feelings
Don't need to be a prophet
To know whats going to happen
