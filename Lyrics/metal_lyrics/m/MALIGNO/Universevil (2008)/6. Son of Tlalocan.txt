Crawling dreams into my internal void
You give life and death to the crimson curse

Oh lord I offer my soul
My powers are yours 
In the pain you'll find the cure of the lost
To find the light 
To feel the flow

To fell the flow

Controlling the underworlds
Enchanted gardens
Dancing in the sea of eternal darkness
Fly away my dead sons, no memory no blood

Oh lord I offer my soul
My powers are yours 
In the pain you'll find the cure of the lost
To find the light 
To feel the flow

It seems you're lost and now
You're saying I'm sorry
There's a leading path
You can't fin the way
Al your thoughts are not enough
To take you out there
The leading path will never find you the way

Realize, realize, realize you are
Turning to stone
