Sailing on the sea of deception
The immortal light of wisdom
Awareness of the spirit has born
By leading the ship of the undrown

Consciousness of the impossible 
Strong the fury
The more the soil returns the water
Blood beholds the flesh
No redemption no tomorrow
The day has gone away with dust

Black and white has turned to gray 
Carry on, carry on 
Black and white has turned to gray 
Carry on, carry on

Don't let the world become obsession
Nobody else will know the answer
Await your turn to spit your words
To make the truth stand at all
And if you want to take the time
The premonition of a reckoning soldier
You have to look reality is more than
The eyes are allowed to se
