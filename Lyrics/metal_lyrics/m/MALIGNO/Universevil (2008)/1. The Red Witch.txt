Frozen in time the prophecy remains
Defying the light its terror will unveil
Deep down inside the valley of the dead
The red witch lurks for revenge

A hundred thousand bastards blood
Has been spilled this battle for the end 

Burning inside the end an age
The witch's curse into eternal flames
With serpents riding trough endless pain
The legacy the witch has left

A hundred thousand bastards blood
Has been spilled this battle for the end
