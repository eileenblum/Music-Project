Donât believe anyone anything
emotions, a symptom of total insanity
devotion, of everything that you can not feel
confusion, the devil is whispering behind your ears
deception, your future is blinded with walls of dreams

lies, lies your soul its full of lies

temptation, of all of your sins your flesh is so weak
religion, that build you castles of cryptic morality
damnation, you dirty soul has been stolen by me! 
going nowhere, traveling in spiral of the deepest sea
