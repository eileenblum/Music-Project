I,ll show you the way
you havent listened at all
that devildrive
donât leave me alone

donât cry no more for what youÂ´ve done
what i have won what i have lost
iÂ´m by myself, but not alone
this universe is not my home

all bastards glory
all the enemys within
every broken promise
every broken dreams
