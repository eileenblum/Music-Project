as the dying messiah
as the stardust vision came to me
cross down
with the desperate minds
pissing me of , blowing away
soulborn
without care about life 
with no reason to die
soldblood
what you did to yourself
just a matter of time
till you pay your crime

trying to breathe
but you lost your own
i beat myself with no control
your stupid face â¦ iâm not blind.

donât try to forget
your life isnât hell
your god donât regret
