The neverborn has arrive
they saw it riding in the sky
so wonderful spitting fire
looking for something they never found

with a shout full of blood
bury the never in ice
bury the never in ice

his anger without fear
pieces of a non understood crime 
deathbell of an invisible land
time has come for you to die

talk about the never
far beyond the time
time has come for you to die
far beyond the time
