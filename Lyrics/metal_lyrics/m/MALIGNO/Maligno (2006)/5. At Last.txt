you run, you cry, you donât belong
the earth its all about to explode
this is the end of human race

you grow you live you donât belong
your heart its full of emptiness

sinner, looser, corrupted, betrayed
flesh, blood, weak, broke 
cynic, sadist, sodomized, realize.
lucÃ­fugo, satanaca, putanesca, oh ladrona!
