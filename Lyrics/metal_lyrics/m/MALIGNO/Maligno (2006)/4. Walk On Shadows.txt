haunted by the ghost
of a broken dream
crawling through an endless
line of memories
guided by the darkness
of the lost soul
suddenly realized
that thereâs no one

this emptiness
is getting me
this can be real
all that its left
got to get out
this can be real

under the grand sadness
of the growls of lust
black horizons all around 
erasing of past thoughts
a howling wind that knows 
that i journey alone
all the rest is sorrow 
in silence i will mourn

sudden fire burns
whatâs holding me
consuming all the fear
that used to be
looking through the shards
of a broken glass
walk on shadows
for all my life
