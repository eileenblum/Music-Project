This is all what your looking for
its this fear what you can explain
donât try to escape 
i know you are there
i came from heaven i live in hell

you want the reason this is your mission
go to the surface

you have the power its your decision
go to the surface

eternal pain 
that made you insane
you lost the game

donât run to fast donât be to late
go to the surface
you cross the line that never ends
go to the surface

loosing your mind and youâre praying for your soul
into the cavern of thy unholy ghost
desperate screaming falling black hole
into the madness i cant take control
