increasing the fury
touched by the demon
so tired to fight
corrupted obliviion

dismembered fate
destroy all illusions
are burning my brain
because of confusion

your silent lies for your life
your silent life for your lies
the truth is just before your eyes
betrayed by fear buried alive

your silent lies
before your eyes
betrayed by fear 
buried alive

this way of survive
its wrong without future
shaking and hidding 
carrying the cross
where is my sheppard
where is my lordâ¦
