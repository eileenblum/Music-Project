No fear of rapture as taught by the pastors.
Perception demolished,
Perform the extraction of eyes.
Translucent energy that shrouds the physical alibi.
The masturbation of interpretation has ruptured our bodies
And condemned us to this worldly guise.

Psychoactive Chemicals disrupt the flow,
A culmination of the standards causing life to grow.
Become forgotten, forget what man bestows.
This revelation has led the mind to its plateau.

Realize there is no truth;
Only design, dismembered.

No fear of rapture as taught by the pastors.
Perception demolished,
Perform the extraction of eyes.
Normality relinquishes its grip on the psyche,
Immortally preserving blasphemy.
And as these thoughts are cast astray,
What they once birthed is laced with decay.
Flesh shall betray what we were truly birthed for.

Spiritual forthcomings are a formality.
We've been condemned,
Cast down to a land of disease.
These are but laws set forth to govern the weak.

They banish unique thought to prevent impending affirmation.

Banished from the sky,
Cast back down to this earthly plane.
Cast down from the sky,
For there we could see.
Banished from the sky,
Imprisoned in this realm of distain,
So we'll rip down the sky
And we'll tear it atwain.

Through sedation they force-fed man "sanity".
There is reason for insecurities.
Birthed of flesh they contained the true cost of omnipotence,
Forging the impurities.

Forced enigmatic perception
Births consciousness once concealed.
How sadistic, the strength of the mind,
Once you have shattered its shell.
What truly is sanity but an option of man?
I shall forsake what flesh sought to achieve,
And cast this world forth into hell.
Cisterna.

Psychoactive Chemicals disrupt the flow,
A culmination of the standards causing life to grow.
Become forgotten, forget what man bestows.
This revelation has led the mind to its plateau.

Realize, there is no truth;
Only design, dismembered.
