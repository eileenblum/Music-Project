You've made your choices
thought only for yourself
you've ignored all the facts
and continued dying
one day at a time
never looking ahead
to how this effects
the ones you love
now you left nothing behind
but empty hearts
and what could have been memories
never amounting to anything
but dying selfishly
now you're nothing
you never changed
despite the signs
ignore all you thought was right
we all suffered in the end
never putting up a fight
you have made your choices
giving up on your life
