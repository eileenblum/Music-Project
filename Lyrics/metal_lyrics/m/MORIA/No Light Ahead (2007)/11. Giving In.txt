It's so much easier to give in
giving in on everything you hold true
you've given up
on what was once so close to your heart
this is still close to me
this is still what I believe in
abandon all hope as you go against everything you once were
I use to see the passion in your eyes
holding onto everything, saying it will last

I've grown to despise everything you've become
watching you grow into this
from what I once knew you as
this is still CLOSE TO ME
this is still IN MY HEART
convictions are meant to last
holding on to this is so much harder
it's so much easier to give in
give in on everything you hold true
I've grown to despise everything you've become
watching you grow into this
from what I once knew you as
I will stick to my convictions despite the lack of yours
