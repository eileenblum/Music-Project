You'd think we've progressed far enough
not to need this
once used to explain the unexplainable
now we are just convinced and enslaved
not to think beyond these pages
you'd think we've progressed far enough
not to need this
we've not progressed
once used to explain the unexplainable
now we are just convinced and enslaved
now we have little hope
unless we close the book
fed and told this
is the way we must think
I can't help but ask why I believe in what I do
have you ever questioned all of this
heaven looks so grim
when the path is paved by hate and ignorance
ignorant thoughts against
what is not natural to you
and accept others for who they are
weren't you meant to accept others with open arms
we are met with closed minds
this has been my choice
believing in what I think is right

and what I research is true
this has been my choice
you cant save me
I'm going to hell
so I'm taking you with me
I've kept my mind clear
so I'll pay the price if I have to
I'm going to hell
I'm taking you with me
