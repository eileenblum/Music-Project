You failed me
you failed yourself
you walked the line
starting out so pure
this is who I thought you were
this is what you were always to me
clean and precious was your life
swept away to the broken path
you say that we all change
that this was a phase
but this is me forever
you say that we all change
but I only CHANGE FOR THE BETTER
I watched you waste away
every night, every breath
as the carbon fills your lungs
as I smell it on your breath
it reminds me of why I am
you have changed for the worse
walking the broken line
going back on your word
you failed me
you failed yourself
You failed me
you failed yourself

you walked the line
starting out so pure
this is who I thought you were
this is what you were always to me
clean and precious was your life
swept away to the broken path
you say that we all change
that this was a phase
but this is me forever
you say that we all change
but I only CHANGE FOR THE BETTER!!
I watched you waste away
every night, every breath
as the carbon fills your lungs
as I smell it on your breath
it reminds me of why I am
you have changed for the worse
walking the broken line
going back on your word
you failed me
you failed yourself
