Six bullets through their brains
face down in their misery
they told him to kill
the ghost along his side
full of rage and
possessed to kill
kill them all
moving here in the promise
of a new beginning
this quickly swept away
by the horrors of the past
catch them
kill them
these murders would haunt him
driven to insanity
the growing hate
eyes blood shot red
this eerie coldness
and voices in his head
this is truly hell
horror!
you must escape this
residing in his basement
the voices still in his head
driving him to insanity

this is his breaking point
chasing his family with an axe
they must escape the horror
of this house
28 days of hell
