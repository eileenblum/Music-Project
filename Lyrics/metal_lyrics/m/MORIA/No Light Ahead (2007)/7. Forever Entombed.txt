This charred corpse speaks no more
as the smoke escapes from between
her soon to be rotting teeth
the smell of burnt flesh
is only apparent now
she only screamed a little
while the gasoline
was poured all over her perfect
pale figure
dropping to her knees in flames
all of his pain is gone
as her last shallow breath escapes
now a black charred corpse remains
she speaks no more lies
her charred corpse
speaks no more
he dismembers her corpse
discard the evidence
her body forever entombed
in a concrete casket
sinking to the depths
lost forever
no respected burial
and only desolation under water
forever entombed
