As we assemble on the eve of our fate
we call upon the power of mighty Odin
guide us to victory
we fight for glory
unity under one banner
now our destiny awaits us
the battle cry has sounded
our might is to be tested
the clash of swords fills the air
The bloodshed has begun!
the battle rages on as
I cut open my enemies
our enemies begin to fall
to their knees
severed limbs
broken bones
nothing stands in our way
it's time to slay the king
this is ours
victory IS OURS
we bask in the glory of our battle
to the victor goes the spoils
