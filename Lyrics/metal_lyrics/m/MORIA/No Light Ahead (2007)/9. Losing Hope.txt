This weight on my shoulders
of the fate of human kind
is far too much to bare
I'm losing hope far too fast
for what we could be
hating what we've become
striving to be on the top
this has been engraved in our brains
but does not reflect our nature
but I'm still losing hope
far too fast
I've watched others around me fall
lacking in self respect
lacking in the compassion
this will lead us to our demise
striving for the top
at the expense for others
pushing aside all the morals
and thoughts for others
this will come back to you
this will lead to our demise
this will haunt us for an eternity
