I try to escape all of this
put you behind me forever
but you are summoned to die
screaming drop dead
DROP DEAD
dreaming only of your death
I only see in red
the weapon in my hand
this will determine your fate
the blade slides so easily
to your heart
I only dream of your death
releasing the pressure
of this burden
a sense of relaxation
from your silence
no last words
just the escape
of your breath
no expression
only blood
from your mouth
no last words only death
