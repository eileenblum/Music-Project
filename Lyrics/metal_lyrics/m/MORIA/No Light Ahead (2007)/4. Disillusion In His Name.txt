Religion at the heart of persecution
they have divided more than united
hate fed by faiths
blood spilt because of the one
we've gone this far
with no progress
humanity is doomed
we must breakaway
from these narrow views
that divide us away from each other
so much devastation caused by holy wars
fighting for selfish ways
let us tear down these walls
of separation
built up by the faith of human kind
we will never progress
with these ideals
they set the boundaries
it's time to break them
and set our minds free
dissolution in his name
with no progress humanity is doomed
we all are doomed
