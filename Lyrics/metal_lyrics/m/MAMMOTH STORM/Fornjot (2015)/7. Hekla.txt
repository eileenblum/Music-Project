Melancholy cries
Piercing wines
From the bottomless
Dark abyss

Echoing sound
Of fearful howling
Gnashing teeth
Weeping voices
From deep within

Fearsome screams
Of tormented souls
From the fires of hell below

Earthly mother
Open your mouth!

Unleash your fires where
There worms dieth not!

Angels fall from heaven
Into the fiery pits
Brimstone fires
Swallow the sinners

Furnace of hell
Burning souls
Open the seventh
Gate to hell

Mountain of Hekla
Reaching towards
Smiling heavens
Raged with storms

Frenzy Mother
Scorch the earth
Cleanse the delusions
Close the gate!
