Raging blizzards
Razors falling
From the sky
Dark polar
Winter storms

The sun will rise
No more

Crawling walls
Of pellucid death

Dark-lit sky
Massive winds

Mammoth Storm

Into the mouth
Of permafrost
Slow death
Trapped in a coffin
Of ice

Buried, trapped
Beneath

Rising mountains
Of white death

Under siege
Permafrost seeks its prey
