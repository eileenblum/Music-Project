Hopeless fear
In virgin eyes
Gazing at the sky

Pure shining skin
In moonlight sheen
Soft and unstained
By man

Shivers fondles
The naked skin
Cold are the hands of death
Cold tears down
Pale white chins
Like an ever flowing stream

Dancing fires
Blinds the eyes
As the gods
Will claim their life

Chanting voices
Ecstatic screams
Prayers to the gods above

Circle of trance
Horns of Jura
(Dancing cloaks)
Frenzy cries
From a life soon lost
As the blade rises high
Shell play tribute
To the gods

The fire's rising
Enlights the sky
Masked jackals
Frenzy cries

Dancing shadows
Sweeping by
Bring forth the
Blade of sacrifice

Eager eyes awaits
Illumination
The blade will rise
Flesh for the gods

Eager eyes awaits
Illumination
The blade will rise
Flesh for the gods
