The herd is marching
Towards unknown lands
Through the desolate tundra
Through a wasted land

The herd is marching
The strong before the weak
Beneath the raging skies
A rebirth to reach

Seen through the eyes of the raven
Circling vultures prey

The herd keeps marching
Through raging winds
The weak keeps falling
Vultures prey

The herd keeps marching
Through Mammoth Storms
Raging blizzards
All shall fall

Seen through the eyes of the raven
Circling vultures prey
