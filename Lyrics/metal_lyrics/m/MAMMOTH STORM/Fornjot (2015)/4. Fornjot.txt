A sea of ice
A wind of fire

A void between
Where life expire

No sand, no ocean
No waves to travel

No earth, no grass
No sky to reach

The ice rose high
In the freezing cold

The flames burned bright
As in visions told

A mist emerge
And life were born

A scream unheard
From where giants mourn

Come forth again
With dreadful rage
And knowledge lost
Of the giants age

Bring us the strength
From the void within
Of aeons old
Of the burning
Of the burning cold
