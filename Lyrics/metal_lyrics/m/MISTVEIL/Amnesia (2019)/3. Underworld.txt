Holy putrid smoke
Entombs your heart
Casting mind apart
From heart and dreams

Of storms to come
And eyes that gaze
Upon the moon
I'm not afraid

And I reborn
To haunt you again
I will conform to no law

And your restrains
Are set by me
Do not forget
I am
Your king

Your blasphemy
Your tragedy
I won't portray
Upon me
The holiest of hounds

Your unity your leader
Falls to his grave
Forging my history
Taking back
What is mine
