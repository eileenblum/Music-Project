The dice are thrown
For fate to be known
Alone have you grown

Appears sin
And fills the seven seas
With the tears
That we keep
Inside

Piercing through the veil
I see you
Your heart
Won't let go

Forsaken storms
Divide us
And turn us to grief
Masquerade
Of the silent
Evil souls

The dice have shown
And I still refuse
To believe
To this merciless world
Of destiny reversed
In this pit of hell
I won't burn

Thrown into this life
I follow
Your hand
Slipping away

Through the darkest times I rise
And enslave the puppets of grief
I will find you
Liar

Leave my body
Leave my throne
Hear the martyrs
Weep at god
Close your ears
They have won
You're enslaved
In your grief
