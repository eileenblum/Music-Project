Into your eyes
A flaming puzzle of destiny
Breaking all ties
With laws and facts
You thought were true

Into your heart
A pale grey
A light mixed with dark
A dark mixed with light
Breeding doom

Your light unfolds
And swallows the dark
Your spirit roams free

Your virtue sails
With force unknown
In the human realm

Your power grows
'Cause god allows
For you to live

Again

Into your dreams
A grey world
Portraying in your mind
Your withered wasted dreams

Into our souls
A bond deep
Stretching out of time
Forever trapped in grief
