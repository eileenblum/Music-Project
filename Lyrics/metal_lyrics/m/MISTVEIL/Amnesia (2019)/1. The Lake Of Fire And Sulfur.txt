Fumes
Fuel
Concrete
Your plague

Tombs
Spell
Secret
Futile thoughts

Tossed in the blaze
Silenced forever

No!

Sailing upriver
I hear your call
Touched by your shadow
I am reborn

Empires of silver
Fade before my eyes
Cannons surround you
And fire at will

Sentinel of the damned
Hurt me more
Sentinel I am
Strong from within

I burn and curse my soil
Swear to be free
I burn away this world
I know
It's forged
A lie..

But you are not a lie
You I cannot burn
I can't sit by
And watch you kill
Your self
