Boundless walls create
A prison made of life
A life unblessed unwilled
The torment of flesh and bone

A lesson learned
In forged blue skies
Did you forget
Your crimes

And you will know
There's nothing real
Except the pain
You feel

Do not be afraid
To fly to the sun
Your wings
Are made of steel
Ascend and wake up

The silver
Dagger in hand
The wrists
Spitting blood
The dagger
Slices
The throat
Why
Does it always
Come to this
