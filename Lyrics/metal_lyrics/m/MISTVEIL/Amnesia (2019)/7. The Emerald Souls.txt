Cold
Scarred
Lost
Cursed and thrown

My light force
My glory
Is hovering
Above your mortal world

And flocks of crows
Surround your vain belief
'Cause the mystery
Has found its way
Inside your mind

Hiding in shadows
I see you
From the corner
Of your nook
You almost feel me
And my curse in you
Blooms

At nights I stop and think
Of her words that defined me
The world is a lie
Dance with the shadow
And yours it shall become

Who is there
That calls my name
Who are you
To hold my pain
Is your tongue
Chanting
Still
