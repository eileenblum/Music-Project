After such years
I buried my pain
Within you
(your gift is so true)

A constant guilt lurking
A voice inside
Pleas to me
(such are her ways)

Upon my side
The raven flies
Unleashed uncontrolled
(violent truth)

A portrait deep
I cannot paint
Your tragedy
Your bitter goodbye

Guiding the old raven's eyes
Carry my flesh in this world
(after suffering long)

In all I see
A glimpse of hope
And still its light
Carries me on

I triumph through
A pain so true
Forgive
Be forgiven

(violent truth)

Familiar songs
Rejection paint
Your words I will keep
Your bitter goodbye
