Liars praise
Secret thoughts
Reaching wide
Thorns of this world

Evil's hand
Closes in
Liar's pain
It brings

Thrown in this earth
Chase your own shadow
Run into walls
Fall to your knees

My lies
My thorns
My pain
Mine alone

My wounds
My fall
My rise
Unframed
Victorious

Thoughts turn asunder
Spirit pierce the veil
Mind absent
Thrown in despair

At last I win
And hands that care
I gain and love
But still betrayal
Boils my blood
