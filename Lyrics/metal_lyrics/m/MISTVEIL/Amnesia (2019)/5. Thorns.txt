I raise my throne
On heads of men
The truest cause

I fall in thorns
Of lasting pain
To pray to her

To heal my scars
And change my thoughts
To feel alive once more

I pray for strength
To carry on
And fill the flesh with bone

Born from claws of lust
Forged in clouds of mist

Intact unbroken I will reborn
Reverse the broken
Shattered glass
For you my crown
I will deny
And burn it along
With servants of blood

And on my throne
I do reborn
To feed on loneliness

To forge my way
From which I came
I must resist

In virtue whole
But half in will
My mind awake from pain

And so I pay
For what I've done
But so will you
