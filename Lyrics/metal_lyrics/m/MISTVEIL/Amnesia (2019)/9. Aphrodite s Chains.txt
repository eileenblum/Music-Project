My existence is here
Remembering
Of the courage
I once had

After million years
That I was strong
Did you believe
That I was weak now

You hold my hand
In ardent love
I run away
Your ego grows
By forcing me
In needing you

You tie my life
You tie my hands
You turn me
Into the slave
I always was
And always will be

My tears
My sacred tears
I will not
Shed for you
