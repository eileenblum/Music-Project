[Lyric:Jens Kidman, Fredrik Thordendal]

Here we are to stay
We all can see the purblind day
Assail the cause
Defray the ogre, the insubordinates

Restrained to live
Bring me home
Confronting mutants
We are all bound to fall

Mortality
we see today, defrauds our dreams
Approachable to die
Sliced by their lies, secured morbidity

Restrained to live
Bring me home
Confronting mutants
We are bound to fall

How many of the judges place a bet on me?
What's there to be?
MORIBUND IRREVERENCE
What's there for us in this deranged society?
Inanity
CADAVEROUS MASTICATION

SATURDAY
They have saturday
SATURDAY
Now it's saturday
SATURDAY
They have saturday
SATURDAY
Now it's saturday

YOU ARE INSANE
How can you let there be such cruelty
YOU ARE INSANE
Now it's time for you to see

Here we are to stay
We all can see the purblind day
Assail the cause
Defray the ogre, the insubordinates

Restrained to live
Bring me home
Confronting mutants
We are bound to fall

We are bound to fall
