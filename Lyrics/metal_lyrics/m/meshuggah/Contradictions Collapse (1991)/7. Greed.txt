Vitalize your benevolent thoughts today
Encrust the encumbrance that encroach your brain
A devastated world we'll see in tomorrow's society
crushed by our own alternatives we've got ourselves to blame

Tons of death's spreading out violent solitude
WE OBLITERATE OURSELVES
Procrastinated measures decrease our chance to save
'cause you've always got something else in mind

The reignes rain of pollution melts our opportunities
conjectural in their comfortable lives
Stupidity's separated by a wall of glass
We have to stop this immediately this fucking mess

Tons of death's spreading out violent solitude
WE OBLITERATE OURSELVES
Procrastinated measures decreases our chance to save
'cause you've always got something else in mind why?

NOW IT'S TIME TO SAVE US

NATURES DEMISE
We can't control our accessies spreading
pollution we fumble till the end
THE END

The water is filled with toxic waste
and the air is filled with shit to breathe
Soon a dismembered world we'll see
WE ARE IN DEEP SHIT

We have to change this world
START TO COMMUNICATE
We can't go on like this no
NO

...and all this because of greed

Now it's time to perceive our inauspicious oversight
We're leaning on death against compensation
Are we so afraid to lose our welfaresociety
that we have to sacrifice ourselves, the earth

Tons of death's spreading out violent solitude
WE OBLITERATE OURSELVES
Procrastinated measrues decreases our chance to save
'cause you've always got something else in mind why?
