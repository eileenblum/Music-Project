[Music:Tomas Haake, Jens Kidman, Fredrik Thordendal; Lyric:Tomas Haake]

Your words such unessential lies
Refract my barred up eyes
You all tell me I'm confined
in my "shell of hallucinations"
So try and make me realise
Break my secure enclosure
Just try and I know you'll make me laugh
To hell with your damn comprehension

You belabour me for past and present mishaps
as if I had the might of alteration
You've had your trips into my brain, I know you begrudge
Now let me leave for my amenity

So you see, you whitecoated freak
I don't need your allegations
Instead join me to sanity's end
with my sweet needle of salvation

Increasing needs
OF MY ONLY FRIEND
The one I trust
He runs in my veins
HIDES ME AWAY
Under his soothing crust

MADNESS REIGNS
You're no longer in charge of my alluring illusions
that takes me wherever I want, my
MALNUTRIATED MALICE
rises strong and makes me the ruler of
EARTH, WIND AND FIRE
as reality fades, I'm a king on clouds
The selfpity no longer runs in my veins I'm a
MALEVOLENT REVELATION please let me stay,
GIVE ME MORE

LEFT OUT, Dragged down into emptyness
Drowning in floods of misunderstanding
WHY do you all look aside,
You're ripping my dignity AWAY
Inside identity is leaking out
REALIZATION is catching up on me
My needs bashes false immortality
into my affected being...chaos

Cravings of delight
slowly eats my soul
Trapped within myself
Defraying my own lies
Bewalling my demise
Deep penury...internally

I feel marred by errors, can't you see
my desires are calling for me
The sovereign of abnegations,

swings his feelers for a new relation
Come, mesmerize my oppressive mind
Tear apart these vehement cravings
Give me something to live for, bring me back
from my purgatory of obsessions

Increasing needs
OF MY ONLY FRIEND
The one I trust
He runs in my veins
HIDES ME AWAY
Under his soothing crust
