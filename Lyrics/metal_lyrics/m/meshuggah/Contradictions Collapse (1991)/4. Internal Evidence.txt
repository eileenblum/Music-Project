[Music:Fredrik Thordendal, Jens Kidman; Lyric:Jens Kidman]

This could've been a good day
to enjoy how life can be
But instead I wake up in myself
look down ashamed to understand
what we ignore insanity
We wait for the problems
to solve themselves

What the fuck happens here...
NOTHING
Slovenry...
DAMN SAVAGERY
REACT
We're slowly drowning in our own mistakes...
DEEPER
Drowning...
BREATHING UNDERWATER-DEATH
HELP...
I wish I felt much better
Feels like I'm dying inside
By murdering this world
we'll all commit...SUICIDE
Search my mind for reasons
to this uncured depression
This void of emptyness prevails

What the fuck happens here
NOTHING
Slovenry...
DAMN SAVAGERY
REACT
We're slowly drowning in our own mistakes...
DEEPER
Drowning...
BREATHING UNDERWATER-DEATH
HELP...

WILL SOMEONE HELP ME
You know it yourself, nobody gives a damn
WHY
Because our dreams are left behind
WAKE

Numbed PAIN, I'm NULL, feeling ILL...Internally
Truth GONE, lies HERE, Crushed LIFE...Don't interfere
I'm TRAPPED, Wiped OUT, I'm DEAD...Eternally
Mind CLOSED, Torn SOUL, Life ENDS...I'm dying here...

What am I doing here on this earth. Why am I still awake, has
someone heard. What brought me here to this false humanity,
Why am I bound to this deranged deformity?

I'M DYING HERE
