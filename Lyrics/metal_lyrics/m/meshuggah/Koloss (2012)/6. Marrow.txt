[Music: Haake, Hagstrom, Thordendal]
[Lyrics: Haake]

Lasciviously they move
Two powers bound for unity
Like magnets, they align, under immunity
The product of their congress, their libidinous deed
Insatiable mouth of conflict and greed

Beware the soon to be born bringer of pain

One evil by another inseminated
Pure hatred conceived
The pairing of blood and power
A spawn of harm produced
Death and profit begotten, fused

A ghost-producing offspring. Immorality's embodiment
Spite and disgust incarnate. A progeny insane

Tar-black ejaculate
The seminal bile of conspiracy
- The blood of those who died
Their innocence, their marrow

The pursuit of ruin. Murderous ambition
Bloodshed, the careless taking of lives
A conduct symbolic of its condition

Behold the newborn monstrosity
Descendant of avarice
Indifferent war machine in all its violent glory
A callous iron god born to reign

Tar-black ejaculate
The seminal bile of conspiracy
- The blood of those who died
Their innocence, their marrow
