[Music:Jens Kidman; Lyric:Jens Kidman]

I ALONE I FILL MY HEAD WITH EVERYTHING I HAVE SEE INTO MY EMPTY
FACE SCARRED I KNOW I'LL NEVER BE YOU'RE ALL THE POWER IN MY
FUCKED UP FEELINGS WORN OUT BY FRAYED OLD VISIONS I KNOW I AM
YOU TOO SO I WEAR YOUR MISSION MARK MY EVERY STEP AND I CHOKE
MY LONELY BREATH SO I CAN BEAR MY SEED SLAY WELL I DO KNOW MY
HAND OBEY I LOOK INTO MYSELF CRAWLING RAGGED IN MY BRAIN I'M NO
ENEMY TO ME I AM THE HATE YOU MADE OF FLESH AND BLOOD I AM THE
MAN YOU ATE NOW LEFT TO SOUR EMBARK MY SOLITUDE FILL UP WITH
PAIN BELOVED ENEMY YOU NEVER BETRAY I KNOW YOU STILL I PAY SIMPLE
WAY GO INSANE I DON'T BEG NEVER I CHOOSE WILL I EVER I'M STILL YOU
CHAOS IS THE WAY YOU DRAIN ME INTO BE YOU LAST TRACES OF THE ME
CONVERTED BY YOUR REIN MERGE INTO AN INDIGESTIBLE PESTILENT TRIP
SEASONS OF INFINITY INHABITANT OF PAIN INCORPOREAL SENSE CAN'T
RESIST WHAT I NEED SPIRITS TO RELEASE MY POWER RECKON I'M BEYOND
RECUPERATION SWALLOW EVERY HOUR HERE I STAND IN THE MIDDLE OF
MY ENTITY REVILE MY HEAD YOU'RE ALL I HAVE AND I ASK YOUR FEELINGS
RITUAL RITUAL HAND IN HAND BACK TO BACK YEARNING TO TO OBEY SEE I
GO INSANE ME YOUR ONLY FRIEND I NEVER RUN AWAY HATE YOU'RE ALL I
EVER HAVE YOU KNOW I AM SEEING YOUR REALM AT MY BED OUR LOVE
NEVER ENDING YOU RUN MY HEAD SEE I WAS MADE FOR YOU ROLL MY
MIND AWAY EMBEDDED IN HATE YOU'RE ALL I HAVE YOU'RE ALL I HAVE
