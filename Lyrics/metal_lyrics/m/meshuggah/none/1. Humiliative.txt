[Music:Fredrik Thordendal, Jens Kidman; Lyric:Tomas Haake]

I'M THE CONCRETE LEPER SICKNESS REPULSION EMBODIED BUT HEAR THE
SERMON ESCAPING MY VERMIN MOUTH YOU MIGHT EVEN STAY WITH ME
IN THE DIRT I'M SOAKED IN PUTRID SEWAGE RISEN FROM EMPTY WORDS
TO YOU A LEGION OF NAUSEA I'M YOUR SINS I'M YOUR CROWN OF THORNS
I'VE SEEN THE BLOOD OF GENERATIONS THE RAVENOUS MOUTH CALLED
SYSTEM WE'RE ALL SHAPED BY VULGAR HANDS THE GRIP OF HATE AND
LIES THE SUSTENANCE TO OUR BELLICOSE WAYS AN IGNORANCE ALMOST
JUSTIFIED AS THE GAP OF HUMANITY FRACTION GROWS THE SKULL OF
LIFE LOBOTOMIZED HEAR ME I'M IGNOMINY THERE'S NO RENAISSANCE IN
BLEEDING NO I'VE FLOWN A MILLION MINDS BLACK IN DESPAIR THE
LIQUIDS OF UNCERTAINTY SPIT INTO THEIR EYES OUR FLESH EMBEDDED IN
COUNTERS OF INIQUITY IT SEEMS LIKE WE ARE ALL JUST MERCHANDISE
NOT CIVILIZED NO WORDS WE ADAPT IN OUR SILENCE PARALYZED TO
CHANGES ERASING THE LAST DENIAL LINES ATTITUDES CRUCIFIED STILL
WE'RE GOING ON CRAWLING TOWARD SUBMISSIVE SUICIDE
