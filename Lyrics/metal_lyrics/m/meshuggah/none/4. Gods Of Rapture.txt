[Music:Fredrik Thordendal; Lyric:Tomas Haake]

I FEEL TORN APART A VILE MISFIT FALLEN 
DEEP INTO AFFLICTION OF MY HOLLOW MIND 
THE SENSE OF SUFFOCATION GROWS INSIDE MY LUNGS
WHEN I WAKE INTO TRUTH I'M BACK AMONG THE BLIND 

THE TRUTH OF LIES DISENCHANTING MY EYES 
HOW CAN I SURVIVE I CAN'T STAND BEING 
ALIVE...ALIVE...
GODS OF RAPTURE ENSHROUDING MY EYES I TRY TO HIDE 
THEN SLOWLY I DIE 

MY PAST LAUGH AT ME FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF NEGATION
UNTYING THE LASTING FEW CORDS OF COMMON SENSE 
SUBMERGED INTO THE FLOW THE RAPIDS OF ADDICTION 
TOO WEAK TO PUSH IT BACK A WORM WITHOUT DEFENCE 

MY FLESH FADING UNDRESSING THE BONES BEHOLD ME NAKED 
CADAVER EXPOSED THIS MY ABUSE I CAN'T TAKE IT NO MORE 
THE FRAGILE TRUTH SNEERING AT ME WITH TEETH PRESSED
LIKE THRUSTING NAILS INTO MY HEAD ALL MY LIFE I REGRET
