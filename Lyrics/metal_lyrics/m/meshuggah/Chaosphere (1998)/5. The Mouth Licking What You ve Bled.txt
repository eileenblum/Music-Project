[Music:Fredrik Thordendal; Lyric:Tomas Haake]

I'M THE SHALLOW, THE SUPERFICIAL. I'M THE COMMON MAN. FAITHLESS, NARROW MINDED, INDIFFERENT, IMPASSIVE.
A SYCOPHANTIC LEECH. TANTAMOUNT TO DISINTEGRITY. I'M THE VULTURE FEEDING ON MALIGNANCY.

I'M THE SIN, THE LECHEROUS SNEERING AT PROSTRATION. I WALLOW IN DISEASE. I REJOICE AT DEGRADATION.
I YAWN AT MISERY. SPIT AT OTHERS HAPPINESS. AN ADVOCATE OF MANIPULATION. I EMBRACE THE SICKENING.

I'M THE LOST. I'M AVERAGE. I'M COMMON. I'M INFECTION. I'M HUMAN. I'M COMMON
A WORM THRIVING IN SEAS OF DISGUST. I'M COMMON. THE MOUTH LICKING WHAT YOU'VE BLED. I'M COMMON

I'M THE PAMPERED DEGENERATE. I INDULGE MY INCLINATIONS
THE ONLY WORDS TO MY ATTENTION ARE THOSE THAT I MY SELF CREATE
DISORDER. CHAOS.

I DEBAR ALL ORDER, REPUDIATE ALL PURITY. INFATUATED BY CONTENTMENT.
I LAUGH AT LIES. COME BEHOLD THE SICKNESS IN MY COMMON HUMAN EYES.

I'M THE GREED. THE CYNIC. I'M THE INDIFFERENT GAZE.
MENDACITY, BETRAYAL; THIS IS NOT A PHASE
EBULLIENT WITH HUMAN FILTH, HERE I AM. HERE I STAY.
FLOURISHING IN OUR DISGRACE. BLESSED BE THE HUMAN WAY.
