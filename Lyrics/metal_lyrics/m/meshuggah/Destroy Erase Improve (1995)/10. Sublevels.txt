Back again within myself
Asleep but aware i'm lost again
Every time i close my eyes
I enter the dream to which i'm strained
A sudden change into a state
Where life is dust
And everything flow
Circling above swirling seas
Of eyes upraised toward the unknown

Vapour masques in the leaden air
Unleashed by death in a grubby dawn
Vacant faces reflecting sorrow
Hidden inside senses disowned
A maze of glass shattered by thoughts
Of a faltered soul freed in bliss
Clouds disperse revealing shades
Tempting my soul i can't resist

A vision of morbidity
Of ragged silent shadows
Dressed in black disease
They're closing up on me
Peering lifeless weary eyes
They drag me down into
Another world inside of me

Paralyzed by the view
Hypnotized let me wake

Mesmerized by the flames as i return
Into myself a slow conversion a silent
Change i wake into the brightened day
