An even strobe a pulse of flashing
Hatelights of synthetic souls mass-produced
Hammered into shape a sign of times dreams
Turn into systems a new way a new breed
Implanted in our minds

Here I am in the hand of a sterile hate
The new control I can not wake
I'm not a sleep

New intelligence arise in emptied bodies
Turgid flesh tested through eternal spastic fits
Do not know codes mother machine
Genocide now scorn a dying race

Evolution in reverse now it's time for me
Changing what am I to be
Contorted an eternity defeated

Programmed to appease you we're symbols of
Perfection humanoids ruined by your laws
Destroy erase improve lesson first
Submission we're docile servant dogs
Our leashes are your limbs
Computed deep within

Remoted minds controlled our thoughts no
More doubts the new way is here disgorged
Another thousands fakes that obey to a
Circuit skin to vacuum

Mechanical thoughts I now conceive
No longer me always to see inanity
Millions to be units like me eternally
Human patterns copied dissected distorted
Completed to fit the machine
The nerve fibres give in to cords
To the unknown

See me be me same contents same machine
The currency of ours no more flesh and bone
We are to be unaware of what we have been before

Evolution in reverse now it's time for me
Changing what am i to be contorted
An eternity defeated by a new machine.
