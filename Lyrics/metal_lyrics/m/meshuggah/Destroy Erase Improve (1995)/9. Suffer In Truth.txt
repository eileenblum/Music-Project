Tortured soul ripping skin into ashes
Blind by pain deaf by lies
Smell of freedom violently cuts
Forgiveness
Power to a being never dies
Suffer in truth's narrow passage saw
Weak solutions stabbed to now know
The smile of obliterations face

Penetrating through the void of life
A dance with the dead
Buried in oblivion stolen from the mind
Constant starving never fed

Contamined life is fading
Laughing in my face
Suffer in deception
Manipulated not to feel
Slain beleifs abandoned dreams
A life of misery

Suffer in truth

The wounds of a soul in pain
A mirror of life
Dreams all in vain
Life will always be sealed

I see ... unseen
I feel ... unseen

Suffer in truth
