In the midst of night, I come to you
In your sweet lovely dreams, there is nothing you may do
I have the key to your mind, take my hand and step through time
Here inside my world your is forever mine

Shadows devours you like an abyss of claws, tearing at your soul
Shadows of horror, faces of scorn, a hall of madness, demonic faces in stone

The faces are coming, your run but cannot move
A sudden shill, your soul is frozen in stone

Lower, deeper, darker
You're coming with me

They try to wake you up, you've been sleeping far to long
Your heart and pulls are beating well but still you don't respond

"Oh please God, give me back my child" your father screams in vain
For there is something he don't know, his child is where I reign!

Shadows devours you like an abyss of claws, tearing at your soul
Shadows of horror, faces of scorn a hall of madness, demonic faces in stone
Demons eats your soul by the music of your screams
I'll make sure you'll be comfortable here, in the deeps and forever sleep and dream my sweet dreams
