In a distant world from here my roots belong, 
one night I arrived, that's when the terror begun.
The terror of madness, the cradle of death, 
your skull a piece of reward for the quest

I'm the manhunter

Trophies on my wall, makes a good sight
but more I shall have it's the climax of season hunt
I have the skill to move without a sound, 
I have to force to crush you to the ground

I am the manhunter

Here I come, on the path of extinction
Here I come, on the edge of reflexion
I'm the on of fire, I'm the on of hate
I hunt you not for necessarity but to satisfy my rage
Mutilate, decollate, exterminate
This feeble race

I am a ghoul, far beyond human, I am your doom, you imbecile moron
I have the seal to infinity, I'll grant you one, if you'll grant me some experiancy

I'm the manhunter

... and I'll be back, ready to attack
