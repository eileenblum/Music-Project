There's a storm coming...his storm

The air is thick of fog
A calm but ominous atmosphere over the city
A silent but distinct thunder awakes your fear
You wonder what it is but deep inside you
know what's coming nearer

Now black formations fills the sky
Stand up in your execution line
Invincible demons ready to take the fight
The Grim Reaper's here tonight

Legions of demons ready to strike
Powers of hell, grant me the sight
Master of fire, the ancient sire
Let the riders attack tonight

Heaven's on fire, it's shining so nice
Kingdom of summer, turned into ice

Our storm is coming and when it arrives it
will shake the universe

I see a battle, the time for revenge has come
The power is unleashed, it's the night of the ancient ones
Chtulu - warrior lord - almighty god

Humans are screaming in pain but nothing 
can stop us this night of mayhem

Chaos is now complete, eternal death's 
your destiny

The air is thick of fog, a calm but ominous atmosphere over the city
We have come to end your crippled kind, stand up in your line

Legions of demons ready to strike
Powers of hell, grant me the sight
Master of nuclear fire, the ancient sire
Let thy riders attack tonight
