Darkness - We're flying through the 
cosmic night
The dragon has devoured the sun
Earth exists no longer
Hatred and pain is gone
We are the survivors
immortality's granted us
In the end they could not conceal the 
truth of our lives
Now it has descended the eternal night

A new world, dark, without the false light,
free from the hypocrisy of mankind, and
of Christ

Flashback through my mind
Helpless feeble christian souls
Condemned into nothing
Demons, howling mighty warcries
I lifted my hammer and forced souls to die

The four demon warriors
all so fearful and black
Came riding up on pounding horses,
they led the attack
Bringing justice in their rightful quest
judging the world with Famine, War,
Plague and Death.

Mighty lightnings strike for me
I ride the whirlwinds, in heart i keep
The true spirit of my ancients land
The night will never end
God is now crushed and gone, like the
bastard son Jesus Christ

I see the world, the world of night
It's hard to describe it's beauty and it's might
Infernal - I feel the force grip my soul
I survived the doom
