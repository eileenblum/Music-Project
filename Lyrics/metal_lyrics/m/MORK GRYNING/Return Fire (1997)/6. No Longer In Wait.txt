Storms of magic rolling forth
A power so strong, an inhuman force
Apocalyptic signs puts the terror on your mind
Now you must decide
Join us or die!

Crushing the gates of Oreus, we come back to life
We defeated death, nothing stands our might
The fire of our hatred couldn't die with our flesh
To the last you denied us but you can't deny the cold hands at your neck!

We are of a race from beyond the stars
Through timeless space we've come for thee
We are the spiteful ghouls of eternity
Our eyes will cut like knifes
You will die by our very sight

...now listen to our song...

We come from beyond, we bring the new dawn
Now join us and be strong or die by our ineffable wrath
We hold the crimson might
You cannot see us and stay alive
We'll take the world to it's chest and bring eternal darkness

The thunder shakes you, you are frozen by the roar
The roar from the mountain
The heart of war comin', louder...louder -
BURN!

Die and die a thousand times more
Is this world worth dying for?
Does it's inhabitants deserve your respect?
Wouldn't you rather just give 'em all eternal fucking death??

One day you'll understand bu it will be too late...no longer in wait
