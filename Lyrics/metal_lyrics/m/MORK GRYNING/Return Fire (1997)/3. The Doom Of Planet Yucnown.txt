A LONG TIME AGO, IN A GALAXY FAR, FAR
AWAY, THERE WAS A PLANET CALLED
YOUCNOWN, ON THIS PLANET LIVED TWO
RACES WHO IN ALL TIME HAD BEEN IN
WAR AGAINST EACH OTHERS, BOTH RACES
HAD DEVELOPED THEIR TECHNOLOGY IN
ABOUT THE SAME TEMPO AND WITH THE
HELP OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS, ALMOST
THE WHOLE POPULATION HAD BEEN
EXTERMINATED.
WE'RE ENTERING WHEN OUR TWO
HEROES MINAS AND HALRON ARE ABOUT
TO EXPLORE THE ENEMY CAMP...

Silently through the gloomy woods we walk
Cautionally, everything we are prepared for
Now we are close, I hear the voices of two foes
Eliminating them, not a single sound from their throats
Now we see the camp, it's huge
Ten stormtanks down by a lake
We're trying to get a closer look to infiltrate

"Halt! Who's there? We have been
discovered by a guarding troop.
Halron quickly fires his gun, first foe's
dead but we have to run

Fleeing from the enemy they are breathing
at our backs
But we shook them off, they couldn't 
follow our track

This battle I was born for to kill without
remorse
My enemies I will slaughter
We are galactic warriors

Back in our camp, we're planning the
warfare, we must attack before dawn
They might have spotted our place and are
taking position for war
The tanks are motivating, warheads
accelerating
Under the starlit sky, troops are invading

War - breaking bodies with our
caterpillars

Stormtanks crushing through the night
Fatal, blazing fire, erasing with enormous
power
Nothing can save your precious life

As the morning wind sweeps the ground,
fires are still burning
From a hill we look down at our dying,
whimpering foes
The mills of death are turning...
