Out of the crypts we burst, to destroy
your world, so false and weak
Warriors under command of the raging
flame...

We are the masters of hell
In your mind we will rape you, torment
you, until there's nothing left but a torn
shell

Humans like ants crushed crunshingly
under my feet
Their cries do me nothing, they feebly
scream
My hatred's supreme!

Your resistance will fall (dawn is no more)
Damnation from hell, incantation and spell
(god has failed)
Your face llike a million others I unidentify
with blood, I'm the omen of evil, drown in
my red flood

Humans like ants crushed sweetly under my feet
Their cries do me nothing, they feebly scream
Screams of pain amusing to me, your
suffering brings me lust
Hear me I am the son of hell
I'll turn you into fucking dust
We shall oppress your puny world
Soon will death come for thee
We are to raise hell on earth
Fear our hordes of blasphemy

From below we are rising
We are the ancient tyrants

Out of the crypts we burst, collecting your feeble souls
The demons will eat you, destroy humans is the goal
Humans like ants I crush sweetly under my feet
Their cries do me nothing,
My hatred's supreme

Give me your soul!!
