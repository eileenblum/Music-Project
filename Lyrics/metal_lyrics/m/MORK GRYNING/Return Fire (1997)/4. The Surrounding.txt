Desolation of mankind, from the horizon
you can hear them ride
Towards the damned village
Mighty warriors waiting for the sign of war
The bloodred moon above us guides us forth
Raise the swords of hatred, execute with darkest power
Screams and cries will be all you hear

Permeate bodies with our swords
Resurrect evil souls, drain human bodies of blood

I am the strongest one, my powers are
granted by the darkest sources
I am the ancient to doom your life, I will 
rule in infinity

Hail mighty warriors!
Devastate life one by one

A battlefield with dead bodies are all that remains
Fifteen days of rain and our victory's eternal

Resurrection of evil, an army from the tomb
Pain and grief shall be, eternal darkness come

Surrounded by the darkest troops and you'll die
