Once again I call upon them, please be my guests a while
See, I've dressed in purest scarlet, won't you see me a while?
I don't want you any harm, please come play with me
I know you know what I am, please help me see

Like immortal shadows of the past they're watching me
In my sleep and in my wake I know you're there guarding me
And I know that you'll always be there to comfort me
And I know you know that I'm pure when judging me

What is this, my room is sick, the walls and doors and floors
Are swimming, and worms in my bone, sucking, eating my marrow...

There they stand again, my friends
I knew they'd come to help me, in this moment of pain beyond the plains
There faces...such art
Crawlers from the stars, but no, don't look at me like that, no... NO!!!!!
