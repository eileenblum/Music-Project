Devastating in the forthcoming age of war
Marauding all holy ground only moor remains
Thou god shall be shaded in neglect
My credence for almighty powers

I shall establish my triumphal vengeance
Your god shall be dethroned, my detest is overwhelming
Detach the strong from the weak
My superiority clutch you painfully

Terror, eruption, escalating
Your fickle troops shall fall
Thou will yield for the darkside
Under scarlet heaven of hell

Behold my retaliation, my rules in posterity
Oohh...this beauty and the might of the moon
Intoxicated of it's rapture
I'm the one assorted to lead this insurrection

As you are choking in ponds of blood
I'm waking up from this mighty dream
Regarding the fall of the night
But still my unholy desires remain
It remains...
