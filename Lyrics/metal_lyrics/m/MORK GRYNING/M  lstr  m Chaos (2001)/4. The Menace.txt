As terror comes down on the earth it strikes down with a vengeance so strong
It can kill all that stands
The ashes of that which once was is all gone and the bringer of darkness is
brought forth in the sky
A black aura of golden evil is taking the shape of a globe just like ages
ago
Travelling in a dimension away it will create the end for this retarded race

Apparition, this is the grimly arrival

The pain of the humans exposed by this power is as fire ripping as it is
Destroying the world in a blink of an eye
With a force stronger than the light of the sun

Resurrected, it is the grimly arrival
Apparition, pain is the source of life
Now, the golden one has come
Supremacy, no legion can stand

Plague has tortured the world, fire has purified the souls
The master of fire came from the sky, the introducer of chaos have showed
itself
Death is the truth of it's prophecy, this new era is nothing but infernal

Ripping death, plague, evil, carnage, fear, suffer, pain, darkness,
destruction, pure fire, terror, resurrection!

Resurrected...
