Come forth...
My furious anger and incessant hate
Erupting...
Invective towards you weakling
Arising in dark vapour, I'm becoming one with night
To dissolve your enfeebled kingdom

I'm invincible with the tempered steel, reduction you will feel
Infernal rapture fills me, sucked into the realm of hatred
When you weep those tears of blood
My veins are cold as ice, delectable desires

Behold evil desires of laceration
The resistance is forever vain, feel my unchallenged power

I scorn with mischief:

Life shall vanish disinclined to arise
Darkness saviour scald upon your soul
The shadow of the serpent sweeps over the ground
Your slattern divides the trembling darkness within
The darkness within...

Human...you can't resist your overlord
Deformed beyond the red coloured fluid, forever we shall... ledge
