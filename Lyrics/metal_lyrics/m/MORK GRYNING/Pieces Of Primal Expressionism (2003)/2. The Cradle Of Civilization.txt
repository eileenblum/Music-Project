[music: Goth, lyrics: Goth]

The world is in for war
And everyone believes they're fighting for the good cause
As the world gather up its armies
The mighty clash awaits, waiting for a good cause
Welcome to the show 

Crossroads, which path to choose?
Either way we might loose
We cannot trust our knowledge, what we know of right and wrong
Redemption against damnation, what's our choice, the day has come 

Scorching, the cradle of civilization
Scorching, the cradle of civilization

All that I see, endless human stupidity!
