[music: Goth, lyrics: Goth]

Since my first glimpse of the sun my hands have been stained in blood
The foulest deeds I have done, rejoiced in torture and mayhem 

But since my first glimpse of the sun I've been broken torn and done
Trauma upon trauma, no mercy given no mercy shown 

I have done terrible things, but also great ones
I have been the tool of evil yet goodness I have always known
Often have I believed that goodness is what I've served
The end justifies the means as hearts turn to stone 

Now I'm lying here like a shivering snake, all my body and mind is torn
By experiences and deeds, unable to think cleary... 

Now, do you know my name?
Do you know what's your roll in the play?
What can you know, where can you run, my name is 
Mankind!
