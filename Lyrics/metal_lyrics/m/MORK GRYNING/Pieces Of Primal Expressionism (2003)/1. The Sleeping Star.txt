[music: Goth, lyrics: Goth]

We're trapped within ourselves, in a prison of the mind
Clutching on to our ego, unable to break out
We fear every difference, things that feel strange
Used to our safe narrow world, we decline every change 

We're trapped within ourselves, in a prison of the mind
Our values we've enclosed in stone, our ego we've defined 

Let the speed vaporize yourself, forget your ego and past memories
Sow the seed to a higher consciousness and lead the way to final release 

Free the soul... Leave the old...
Focus, and revive the Sleeping Star! 

We're trapped within ourselves, in a prison of the mind
Loosing creativity and the will to break out
Illusions seizes me, my mind's my only enemy
And we're feeding energies of negativity
Each man a god, each man a star, we've lost the key to serenity 

Doubt, no more I shall doubt
No time to hesitate, it's to take all the way, I shall explore what I've found
And walk the way of the expressionist!
