[music: Goth, music: Goth]

Fear breeds hate (hatred leads to violence)
Violence to be avenged (vengeance leads to war)
War brings death, (death is all that's left) and the circle of terror's sealed 

The wheel is spinning on
And the spinners don't know where the thread is going
A world to bleed and burn, to make it our urn... 

And the children cried and begged for help
The children cried and no one bothered
But the children grew, and when they grew up
They raped and killed their own mother 

The wheel is grinding the earth (Replacing soil with blood)
Who dares to challenge the curse?
