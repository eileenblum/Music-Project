It's time, we who have been eons rising at last...
the sleepers are asleep no more...
the dead resting peacefully no more...
War, plague, famine and death -
The four horsemen of the apocalypse are roaming the sky as it was foretold in the book...
The seven seals have been broken and the beast is loose again...
Armageddon has come to pass...finally...
