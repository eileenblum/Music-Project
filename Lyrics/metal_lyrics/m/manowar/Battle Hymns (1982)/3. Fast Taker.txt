[R. Friedman / J. DeMaio]

Mama's having problems,
Always comes to me
Your daddy's been a drinker since nineteen forty-three
They tell you I'm a loser
'Cause I like bein' free
The truth is in the mirror
It's what they never see
I said yeah
A long time ago
They tried to tell me, son
Keep our daughter home
I said no no, no no

Now, I don't mind them saying
That you should be praying
For me, a fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play for keeps,
Aaaah

Fast Taker,
Bed Breaker,
Love Maker
Take it away

You're only sixteen
A woman, not a girl
Old enough for a trip around the world

Pick you up on Friday
When your daddy goes to sleep
Bring you back on Sunday
When he's watching "Billy Graham" on T.V.
Oh yeah, he won't see me

Now do it right with the music
Then you'll learn how to use it
All night, a fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play for keeps,
Aaaah

Fast Taker,
Bed Breaker,
Love Maker
Take it away
