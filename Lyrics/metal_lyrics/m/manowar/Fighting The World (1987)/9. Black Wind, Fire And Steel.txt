Full moon's light is calling me
My kingdom lies within
The mystic soul and lion's heart
Brought by the talisman.
The ecstasy of battle takes me
Where the falcons fly.
Immortal youth was granted me
I will never die.

Born of Black Wind, Fire and Steel
Born of Black Wind, Fire and Steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Black Wind, Fire and Steel.

Pounded by the hammers
Of the giants of the world.
I can see in darkness,
I'm the overlord
Single combat I await
My shadow brings them fear.
The spikes upon my chariot
Will grind them when they're near.

Born of Black Wind, Fire and Steel
Born of Black Wind, Fire and Steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Black Wind, Fire and Steel.

I am an outcast
On the path of no return.
Punisher and swordsman
I was born to burn.
Black Wind always follows
Where my black horse rides.
Fire's in my soul
Steel is on my side.

Born of Black Wind, Fire and Steel
Born of Black Wind, Fire and Steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Black Wind, Fire and Steel.

I am an outcast
On the path of no return.
Punisher and swordsman
I was born to burn.
Black Wind always follows
Where my black horse rides.
Fire's in my soul
Steel is on my side.

Born of Black Wind, Fire and Steel
Born of Black Wind, Fire and Steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Black Wind, Fire and Steel.
