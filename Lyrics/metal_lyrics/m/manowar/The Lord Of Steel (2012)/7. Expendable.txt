I get professional pay
To make people go away
They got nothing to say
Iâm expendable thatâs my claim to fame
Iâm expendable donât have to know my name
Take a look into my dark side
Oh thatâs a window to my soul
Your watching on the outside
Yea thatâs all you people know
So bring a knife or a gun
And iâll show you what their for
Both of them are fun
When the ravenâs at your door
Iâm expendable thatâs my claim to fame
Iâm expendable donât have to know my name
Cause i will survive
With no one left around me
Cause your all gonna die
Together we ride
With vengeance inside
For our brother who died
We got blood on our minds
No we may not return
But many will burn
With a story to tell
How we took them to hell
Iâm expendable thatâs my claim to fame
Iâm expendable donât have to know my name
