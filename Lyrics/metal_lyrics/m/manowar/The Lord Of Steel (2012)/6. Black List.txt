See the writings on the wall
If you can read
Thereâs a black list
Got one name and itâs me
Yea i got no invitation
But i wonât leave
Gonna keep on fighting
For everything thatâs me
Itâs my life
Iâm living free
Ainât nobody nowhere
Got no chains on me
See the writings on the wall
If you can read
Thereâs a black list
Got one name and itâs me
Yea i got no invitation
But i wonât leave
Gonna keep on fighting
For everything thatâs me
If you donât like me - tough, you better leave
Keep on fighting for the things i believe
See the writings on the wall
If you can read
Thereâs a black list
Got one name and itâs me
Yea i got no invitation
But i wonât leave
Gonna keep on fighting
For everything thatâs me
Gonna fight for all the things
That make me breathe
And if you donât like it - tough
You better leave
