Hear a rollin thunder
When we come across the land
Feel the ground a shaking
Start to understand
Sons of thunder
More than just a band
Kings of metal
Loudest in the land
Never gonna change our style
Gonna play tonight for quite a while
In heavy metal we believe
If you donât like it time to leave
Manowarriors raise your hands
We fight for metal
Manowarriors raise your hands
Our fight is real
We do just what we feel
Sons of steel
We come from different countries
With metal and with might
We drink a lot of beers
And play our metal loud at night
Fly the flag of metal
Brothers all the same
Born to live for metal
It ainât no game
Never gonna change our style
Gonna play tonight for quite a while
In heavy metal we believe
If you donât like it time to leave
Manowarriors raise your hands
We fight for metal
Manowarriors raise your hands
Our fight is real
We do just what we feel
Sons of steel
Sons of thunder
More than just a band
Kings of metal
Loudest in the land
Never gonna change our style
Gonna play tonight for quite a while
In heavy metal we believe
If you donât like it time to leave
Manowarriors raise your hands
We fight for metal
Manowarriors raise your hands
Our fight is real
