Thunder touched my soul
I heard a call all should know
Itâs my time iâm alive
Some will come some will go
But most will never know
That greatness lives inside
Like the night turns into day
Doesnât matter what they say
My will is strong as a mountainâs high
I feel so tall i can touch the sky
Speak your mind, put me down
Say your prayers when iâm around
I live the life iâm not passing by
Shorn of hopes and dreams
I donât buy their foolish schemes
I just walk on by
I was born with a heroâs soul
If you got one then you know
Reach my hand where the eagles fly
I feel so tall i can touch the sky
