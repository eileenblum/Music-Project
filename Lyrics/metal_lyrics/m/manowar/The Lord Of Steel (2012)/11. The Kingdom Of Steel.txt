INTO THY HANDS I COMMEND MY SOUL -
AND THY SERVICE ATTEND
JUSTICE AND TRUTH LIVE IN THE WORLD
IN THOSE WE DEFEND
NOW IS THE HOUR UPON US
EACH ONE OF US WILL DECIDE
TAKE UP THE SWORD
AND LIVE AND BY YOUR HEART
INTO GLORY WE RIDE

I AM READY IN MIND AND HEART
I HEARITHE VOICES OF THE BRAVE
AND SOON THEY'LL CALL ME
I WILL DEPART
I'LL JOIN IN THE BATTLEÂ 
FIRST IN THE FRAY

INTO THE KINGDOM THAT WAITS IN THE SKY
FIRE OF SPIRIT
SWORD BY MY SIDE
IT'S A GOOD DAY TO LIVE
A GOOD DAY TO DIE
INTO THE KINGDOM OF STEEL. I SHALL RIDE

GUIDE MY PRAYERS THAT RIDE THE WIND
WHERE THE GREAT EAGLES FLY
A WARRIOR'S LIFE
TO LIVE FOR THE FIGHT
THEN BE CALLED TO THE SKY

I AM READY IN MIND AND HEART
I HEAR THE V0ICES OF THE BRAVE
AND SOON THEY'LL CALL ME
I WILL DEPART
I'LL JOINT IN THE BATTLE
FIRST IN THE FRAY

INTO THE KINGDOM THAT WAITS IN THE SKY
FIRE OF SPIRIT
SWORD BY MY SIDE
ITâS A GOOD DAY TO LIVE AND
A GOOD DAY TO DIE
INTO THE KINGDOM OF STEEL, I SHALL RIDE
