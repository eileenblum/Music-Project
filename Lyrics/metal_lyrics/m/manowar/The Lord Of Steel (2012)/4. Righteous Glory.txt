She is watching
From on high
She knows who lives or dies
She will take me to the sky
Should darkness be my fate
Then let me fall among brave
In battle i shall die
In righteous glory i abide
In righteous glory sheâll come to me tonight
She will carry me across the other side
My brothers wait
Odin knows my name
In the hall of the slain
She takes me through the clouds
To another place and time
Holds me in her arms
Immortal and divine
On hooves of thunder
Her white horse parts the sky
Take me to valhalla
Valkyrie mine
