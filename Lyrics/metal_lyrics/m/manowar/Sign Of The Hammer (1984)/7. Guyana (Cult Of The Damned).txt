Thank you for the kool aid reverend jim
We're glad to leave behind their world of sin
Our lifeless bodies fall on holy ground
Rotting flesh a sacrificial mound

Were you our God or a man in a play who took our applause and forced us to stay
Now all together we lived as we dead on your command by your side

Guyana â in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand
Guyana â in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand

In the cult of the damned we all worked the land, too afraid to look up
We all feared his hand
Hurry my children
There isn't much time
But we'll meet again on the other side
Be good to the children and old people
First hand them a drink
They're dying of thirst

Guyana â in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand
Guyana â in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand
Guyana â in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand
Guyana â in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand

Bigfoot, bigfoot thrown in a well
Pulled under water
Screaming like hell
He told us life was just a hotel
Time to check out when he rang the bell

Guyana â in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand
Guyana â in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand
Mother, mother.
