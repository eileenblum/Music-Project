[Translated by Erman Bora Atabay, dedicated to Aydin Atabay]

Beni kÃ¼Ã§Ã¼kken
Elimden tuttun
Baba, bil isterim
Åimdi anladÄ±m

SuÃ§tan hakkÄ± bÃ¶ldÃ¼n
Ãrnek oldun
VerdiÄin baÄÄ±Å
Hepten Ã¼stÃ¼n

Beni hiÃ§ kÄ±rmadÄ±n
GÃ¼Ã§lendirdin
YanlÄ±ÅÄ±m da olsa
Hatam olsa

Hem sevinir, hem
SavaÅÄ±rdÄ±k
Sen yine bilirdin
DoÄru olan sen

Benimlesin
SÃ¶zlerimde
GeÃ§en zaman
GÃ¼nÃ¼n her vaktinde
Var olmam
Senin sayende

Bizlere yaÅadÄ±n
Simdiye dek
O saÄlam ellerin
TopraÄÄ± iÅletir
O saÄlam ellerin
AlmayÄ±p verir
Senin sayende
HayatÄ± bildim

Benimlesin
SÃ¶zlerimde
GeÃ§en zaman
GÃ¼nÃ¼n her vaktinde
Var olmam
Senin sayende

Baba, ben ve sen
Biliriz ki
Bana dedigin her sÃ¶z doÄru
