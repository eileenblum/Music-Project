Now The Time Has Come When All Is Said And Done
We're Back Together On The Road It's Time To Fly
No More Time To Wait You Know It Feels So Great
Wearin Leather On A Horse Of Steel I Ride
I Ain't Waitin To Get Old I'm Runnin Hot I'm Never Cold
Kiss My Ass If You Don't Like Me I Don't Care
I Got My Wheels Got My Friends We're On The Road Again
We're All Crazy Gonna Ride Until We Die

Time To Burn You Losers Better Learn
No One Controls Our Goddamn Life
We'll Do Just What We Feel Riding Horses Made Of Steel
We're Here To Burn Up The Night

Losers Try To Put Us Down It's Just Another Day
I Got No Money Or Big House Just Got Life
I Don't Like To Save It's More Fun To Spend
If You Like Metal You're My Friend
And That Bike Out In The Yard Well That's My Wife
Don't Try To Understand Me My Family Never Will
Had To Punch My Teacher Out Now He's Chilled
I Might Stay In School Or Die In Prision
Either Way It's My Decision One More Beer And Heavy Metal
And I'm Just Fine

Time To Burn You Losers Better Learn
No One Controls Our Goddamn Life
We'll Do Just What We Feel Riding Horses Made Of Steel
We're Here To Burn Up The Night

We Are The Undefeated We're Not Living In The Past
We're Here Tonight To Kick Some Goddamn Ass
Feel The Power Of The Wheel Lets Drink To Riding Steel
Livin Hard And Ridin Fast

Time To Burn You Losers Better Learn
No One Controls Our Goddamn Life
We'll Do Just What We Feel Riding Horses Made Of Steel
We're Here To Burn Up The Night
