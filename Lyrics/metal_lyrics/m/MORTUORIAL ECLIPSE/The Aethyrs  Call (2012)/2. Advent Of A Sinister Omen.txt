Names are pronounced by
the ashes of  centuries 
Demonized figures that my eyes gaze 
Gelid appearances rising from dust.

Perpetuating  the funeral hour of their doom.

Between choirs of libidinous souls 
I evoke the overwhelming plague
To reclaim the orphaned land

Flood with virgin blood
The consecrated Shrine. 
The arcane symbols bleed
To Invoke the darkest essence.

The circle breaks, 
Tears of wax consecrate the symbols.
The fire glitters before me
Enlighten the sacrifice scene.  

Reveled stigma of his martyr 
Marked by the emptiness of his faith.
Engrave the sign on blessed flesh.
Our resurgent deity ravens the offering.

Those now Awake from their lethargy
Stare my ancestral Rite
Through their crow eyes
Their misery turns to mortal flesh.
