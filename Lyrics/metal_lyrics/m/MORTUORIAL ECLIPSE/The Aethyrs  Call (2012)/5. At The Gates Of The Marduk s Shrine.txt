Mystic genesis where the light drowns.
The ritual incarnates before their damned eyes.

Tears of black candles
spilled the beans over the signs.
the blink of those who denies darkness
disappear on the fog.

The stars enlighten the ancestral conjure.
Once again the Enuma Elish shall be spelled

At the gates of the MardukÂ´s temple
Towards the grace of the MardukÂ´s shrine

Before the eyes of the contemplating BEL.
Blood purifies the nocturnal procession.

Seven days at the edges of Babylon.
Akitu, witness of the purification.
Sacrifice grace the fourth day twilight.
Souls crying for absolution.

Disfigure the creeping designs
to evoke the magnificence of the ancients.
Open veins fill the bronze chalice
With the nectar that seals the end of chaos

Resurrection and revenge.
Tiamat lies before his bloody feet.
Flesh for creation, Triumphant the heir of Anu.
Enraptured the tables of destiny.

At the gates of the MardukÂ´s temple
Towards the grace of the MardukÂ´s shrine

A new processionâs heading
towards the great shrine of Esagila.
Ready to drink the purified blood.
Ready to follow the steps of Nabuchadnezzar.

Disfigure the creeping designs
to evoke the magnificence of the ancients.
Open veins fill the bronze chalice
With the burning crimson nectar of chaos.
