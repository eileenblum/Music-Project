SUPREME LORDS THAT PRECEDE THEM ALL
YOU`VE BROUGHT
THE DIVINE POWERFUL FORCES
FROM THE DARKNESS OF THESE CURSED LANDS
WE EVOKE
YOUR SACRED NAMES

MY BLOOD IS COLD
AS THE WINDS ON THE VALLEY OF THE DEATH
I AM PART OF THE MYSTERY
THAT HIDES THE NIGHT

I `M LEAD BY DEEPER SENSATIONS
THAN PAIN AND HATRED
I WALK OVER THE BLACKENED
FLAMES OF THE BARREN ETERNITY.

NOW BLIND BY THE VEILS OF MADNESS
THAT BURN DOWN THEIR FATE!!
I WALK OVER BLACKENED
FLAMES TO RELEASE MY INNER ABYSS

KUSUH
LEAD US BEYOND THE GATE OF CONSCIENCE
UNVEIL THE NIGHTLY TREASURES
AND BURIED RITES OF THE ANCIENT ONES

NOW MORTALS WITNESS THE ARRIVE OF
THE STELLAR RACE PROGENY.
THE LAW OF THE UNDENIABLE NATURE
TEARS THEIR WHITE RAPTURE OF BLESSED SOULS.

BLOODY LIE ENCRYPTS THE WAR
SINCE EONS AGO
NOW THE CRY UNLEASHES THE STORM
THEY WILL REBORN
THEY SHALL BURN ALL
