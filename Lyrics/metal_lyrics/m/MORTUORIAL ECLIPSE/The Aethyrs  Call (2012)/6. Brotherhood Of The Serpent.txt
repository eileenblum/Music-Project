I found her each time
I lose myself beyond
the crimson desert sands
where Nahash reincarnates.

Through labyrinths of hidden truth
The mirage becames an undeniable fact.

Before their corss you cry.

They live their perfect lie.
Dying out for no course.
When the path gets clear enough
To guide them towards the final day.

While rivers of blood are the fate
of those whom dare to open thee eyes.
The veins of the barren desert
witness the rupture.

Constellations of stolen worlds
raze the weak kingdom of flesh
sculpting with lies the will of their messiah.

Generation of enslaved minds
running reckless under an empty sky
many fought and died for nothing
while my eyes delight with their innocence.

A naked-bodies Procession
Heading for their mortal fate.
No time to wait the cursed prophecy
When everybody stares the spectral dawn.

An old remembrance on the bloody ground
The sacrilegious scorn feeds the white crows
With the bleak ambush of death.
Penitents souls are devoured by the Immortal hug of a fake God.
