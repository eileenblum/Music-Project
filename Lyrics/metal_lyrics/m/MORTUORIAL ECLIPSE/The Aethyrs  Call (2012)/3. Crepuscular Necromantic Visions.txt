Once the moon wrote my name
Upon a forgotten grave,
While Necromantic visions
hug my deathly existence.

A door opens towards a new fate
For thy fallen reign.
From the edge of this time

The one who takes
Their impure flesh
And slave their damned souls.
Receives my last offerings
Under the realm of murk.

From this side of the mirror
everything stands cold and dark.
Antiques conjures are pronounced
The foreshadowed moonless night.

I hear their voices praying for death.
Between the fissures of temptation
There's a gate towards the other side of the nightmare.

Manifest of evil presences
Disturb thy subconscious.
The awaken turns unreal
As the mystery of this fate.

The ancient serpent
Knows all my truths.
The ancient serpent
Waits for the last sacrifice.

At dusk rebirths the eternal flame,
-To evoke the ancestral Bel.
My fate eclipses once again
- when nobody claims the end .
