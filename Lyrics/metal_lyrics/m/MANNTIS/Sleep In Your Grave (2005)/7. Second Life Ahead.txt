(Imbedded in fear, I stand and face the oppressor
Death drawn by my side, the taste of revenge invades me
The eyes of uncertainty, the slow drawn breath of those about to die
I will not keep death nor let it remove me
I will stay strong and focused on vengeance
The blade that is life shall detonate the rivers of blood
Severed enemies cries of killing horror
I will be redeemed
I will strive through
I will kill those who seek to kill me)

This time
I won't
Take my
Life for granted
I'll find myself asking
Why god must hate me
Why I feel
Like I should not have
Survived - This
And what is yet to come:

Why - Does god forsake me?
At - Look down on me
Night - Make me fear
Nightmares still
Inside my head

You never wanted me to stay
You almost took it all away
It's not my - Time yet
I still have one more chance to prove
This time I won't let you down
It's not my, my time yet

Why - Does god forsake me?
At - Look down on me
Night - Make me fear
Nightmares still
Inside my head

Nightmare still inside my head
You never wanted me to stay
You almost took it all away
I can't live, I can't die
It's not my fucking time
