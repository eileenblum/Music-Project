Fallen before me
The bringers of despair
Forgiveness will be forgotten
The time has past to care
Bow down and beg redemption
Severed is my control
Swing the axe cry for justice
Watch the heads begin to roll

Bow down and beg
Time to pay
Axe redemption

This time no one lives
No one will breathe again
Sacrifice what you have stolen
Time to pay
No time for your forgiveness
This time you fucked yourself
Once again bow down and beg
Time to pay

Time to pay
Bow down
This time
Swing the axe
Sacrifice
Heads roll
Your lost soul
