Even for a weathered soul
Inhale from the deepest hole
The scars have been healed
The bleeding stopped
Through the numbness
I feel the pain
A rope to hold me back
Or to hang my head

Never again
Taking life
The day is finally here
Live and let die

Find love from pain
That's all it will be
Fear drowning my heart
Please help me breathe

Never again
Taking life
The day is finally here
Live and let die
