May the darkest days overcome?
And all the bad thoughts that remain
With the past, too much blood
And all this pain won't hold me back
For this time we have
Stand and hold on our own ground
And embark the journey
That lies before us

My life
This is who I am
Resist
Until it's all gone
Our life
This is who we are
Resist
And now it's all gone
