Approaching the time for what it once
And accepting tomorrow's ruin
Never thought it would come to this
This life is one big blur that has taken
Me too far and has still not been found
From what's inside my head

And I'll watch you take it away
But don't make the same mistake

Take away from me
These lies that make me feel
This pain so deep inside
Approaching
