Life
Is filled with all these lies
And I'll take
What you give to me
And I'll take
What this once was
And you'll take
It one more time

I've broke down in side this
Do what they say - What
And I've broke down in side this
Do what I say - Why

And I'll find - My self

Don't take me for granted
I've broke down inside
