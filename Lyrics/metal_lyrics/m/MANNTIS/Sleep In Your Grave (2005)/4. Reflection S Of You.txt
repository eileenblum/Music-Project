Denied from myself
And everything reflects
On all my thoughts of you
So help me now
And how I've been
Because nothing hurts
As much as what you did to me
I walked away
From all this now
And everyday it seems
My life has just begun
One more time
And now I am and all this happiness
Was just reborn

Broken, from myself
Broken, help me now

Denied from myself
So help me now
From this some how
One more time

Nothing
Hurts me
My thoughts
This time
Has just
Begun
