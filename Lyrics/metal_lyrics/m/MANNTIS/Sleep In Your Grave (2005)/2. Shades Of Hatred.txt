You never told me twice
And I can't trust anything
Let's not have the past remain
For it's happened too many times
And all this - Is mine
So take back - My time

I hate the sight of you
And you need to disappear
This time it's not my fault
Let's try and make that clear

My bloods as thick as yours
And my hands around your neck
I thought I warned you once
And now what we had is dead

My blood - My hands
Around your neck

This Time I've turned the page
And I swear I wont look back
Inside your emptiness
I finally found my way
