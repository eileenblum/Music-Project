Stronger than ever
And full of sin
Depression and sorrow

Look deep inside
What is it you see?
A new breed of life

Where it began
A life long commitment
The struggle of few
My time that involves
Nothing past due

No one to thank, this time
No one to thank this time

Stand strong, stand proud
Nothing left for me to take down
Only anger, only will
Motivation left to be killed

Look deep inside
What do you see?
A new breed of life
