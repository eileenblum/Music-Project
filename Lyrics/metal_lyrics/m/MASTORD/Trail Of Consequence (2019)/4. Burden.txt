[Composer: K. SyvelÃ¤ and M. Pihlaja. Lyrics: K. SyvelÃ¤]

Everyday
You hear him weeping
In the pool of blood
That he's bleeding
Still today
You see his eyes
When you shut your own
This burden wear you down
This time
Free fall
Gap opens wide
Deep down inside
This time
The answers lies
Between the wounds of her soul
Live another day
To learn your own history
An open page
A landscape still undrawn today
Self-medicated
Psychotic depression
Fear for collateral damage
It's your fate
To crawl this path alone
When everything else is gone
This time
Free fall
Gap opens wide
Deep down inside
This time
The answers lies
Between the wounds of her soul
Stay another day
To learn your own history
An open page
A landscape still undrawn
Stay another day
To learn your history
It's an open page
Draw a road map from your mystery
