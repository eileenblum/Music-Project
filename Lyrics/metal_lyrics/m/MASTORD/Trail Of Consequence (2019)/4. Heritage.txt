[Composer: K. SyvelÃ¤ and M. Pihlaja. Lyrics: K. SyvelÃ¤]

Many years have past
She's finally found her stand
She's finally found her salvation
With the love and embrace
From the ones that wouldn't turn away
With the scars in her hands
Signs from the past
From the years of broken home
Thought she always knew
Who she were
Just couldn't get through
Still some days those memories
Like a scene from the past beyond
Reminds us we're still
Still healing
And we have to carry on
Shes turned the darkness into grey
And learned how to say a pray
And still today
Cry for forgiveness
The price she have to pay
Everyday
From grey to white
Like a brightest day
The story of her life
Her obsession to seek
Where else she might have been
Remain
Still some days all those memories
Like a scene from the past beyond
Reminds us we're still
Still healing
And we have to carry on
What will be my legacy
After I am gone
Who will decide for me
Where do I belong
Will it be my heritage
Traumatic tragedy
Will it define me and
What I leave behind
To kill a man
In cold blood
Whispers behind her back
"What kind is she"?
She was never alone
Fixated in pleasing him
Any way she can
How can they say that
They don't know
What happened when
Day's turn into black
Behind the closed doors
And many times before
She's made amends
To the ones she loved
She even tried to kill her self
He saved her life
And crush again
And again
What will be my legacy
Where do I belong
Will it be my heritage
Will it define me
You can choose to stay and take it all
Praise the lord and flow in free fall
You can make your own destiny and fate
Choose wise 'cause that will tell
Who we are
