[Composer: K. SyvelÃ¤ and M. Pihlaja. Lyrics: K. SyvelÃ¤]

He's gone forever now
I have to carry on but I don't know how
How can I forgive my self for what I have done
I lost my self and now he's gone
Aching
Broken
Undertaking
Lost my self to the ocean of hate
Still I can hear your breath
When you're no longer here
The pain won't disappear
Figures of your face
Appears
Imagine and fear
No longer here
Believe in god somebody said
Say a prayer and you'll be saved
I can't see how that'll make me brave
And I don't know why
But I did weep on your grave
Should I have just taken it
When your fury made me
Shiver in pain and agony
Or should I have just listen
When they say
It's the fate you've been given
Or should I've just forgiven him
Still I can hear your breath
When you're no longer here
The pain won't disappear
Figures of your face
Appears
Imagine and fear
No longer here
