[Part I Repentance]

She can't remember the last time
When she felt so safe and free
Now she's living her days just by
Lost without emotions
Isolated inside those concrete walls
That once was a home, but no more
Afraid for just another day
Wonder when the things went this way
She woke up early to that Sunday afternoon
Drifting in daydreams while waking
A breathtaking sight of a better life to live
She's already dreaming
And staring
Her passing dreams, silence screams
It's too late for repentance
All getting clear, fear disappear
Ready to cross the frontier
Take the time
To search out your mind
Try to find
Is there something that needs to be
Found
This way
You can not stay
It's time to move on
To where you have always belong

[Part II Faith]

This is not the end of us
I said to calm you down
It's all going to be perfect now
You've seen I've been in therapy
Got the drugs for anxiety
All coming together now
I saw your smile
When you hide
Your true intentions from me
Have a faith and trust in me,
I have been trying hard to see
Since I have fallen from my path
I've opened up my fist for good,
Building patience like I should
Believe me now
That this is not the end
I've seen it in your eyes
Your deceitful lies
There's no way I'll ever let you go!
Take the time
To search your mind
Try to find
Is there something buried under
The state of mind
You've been afraid for so long
It's time to face
