[Composer: K. SyvelÃ¤ and M. Pihlaja. Lyrics: K. SyvelÃ¤]

[Part I Under My Skin]

You, now you've gone for good
I don't know how you could
Cut my heart wide open
I, I just can't get a hold on
My emotions cold as a stone
Hate grows fast enough to flow over me
Paralyzed
In the maze of hate
Growing still
I need you here
I see all illusions dying
My kingdom came
I'm losing it all
I can still feel it
Your sweat in my skin
A bitter drop
Won't fall of
Tell me your plan, God
How is this going to end
Am I going to fall over again
Do you hear it breaking
And crushing my bones
Can you feel it under my skin
I still taste your wet on my lips
I need you as my own
Paralyzed
In the maze of hate
It's over now
I need you here
I see all illusions dying
My kingdom fell
I've lost it all
She's turned her back and moved on with her life
Won't waste a thought of what's behind
One child and a dog, and now she is a wife
All the things she ever wanted from life
And she's dreaming
Her dreams she's living
She's right there
Where we once were
She's found her way
Didn't go astray
Pieces fallen to place
With a life to embrace
She has decided that she won't take a step
And if one day he'll get in her way
She'll face the evil inside his head
She sure won't end up swept away!
Then that day came
Their paths crossed
A nightmare she thought
Was forever lost
Threatening and shout
Echoes from the past
She raised her hands
Not for pray
But for war
Conflict and violence
Her finger squeeze triggered
Trail of consequences far-reaching
She can't quite understand
Why she's there
Not with her man
Two bullets through his chest
And now he's dead

[Part II Oblivious Mind]

Hands tied
Sheets spotless white
Fading in and out
Like the pass of the day
Windows behind
The iron bars
Staring far away
The emptiness in her eyes
She's slowly gaining the strength
To wake up from that haunting
Feeling that's deep inside her soul
Can someone tell her how
She ended up in here
Where did her past disappear
Question that needs to be asked
What happened in her past
A history still unknown
How can we help her to recall
Hypnosis won't help em all
She's fallen out
From this surrounding world
She's lost her words
Chasing time
Hard to reach
Slowly slip away
Brings her down to her knees
Oblivious mind
Dying within
Life passing by
No laughs
No cries
Nothing
Psychotherapy
Estimating personality
Medical treatments
Have she lost her self?
Do you know who you are
And how did you get this far
Scenes from the memories
His fury on her before the end
Chasing time
Hard to reach
Slowly slip away
Brings her down to her knees
Oblivious mind
Dying within
Life passing by
No laughs
No cries
Nothing
