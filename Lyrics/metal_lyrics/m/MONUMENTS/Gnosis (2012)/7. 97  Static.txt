Don't fall behind I don't wanna lose you
we can repair our eyes in heaven.

It's a white night and without sight
I force my way through the crowds of sacrifice
and I started feeling at peace with you
all this destruction and decay makes me feel sick
face the facts we can't wake up. We indulge ourselves like pigs
So I'll eat away the state and force every man to break
and take a good look at itself and everything
in the name of humanity in the name of liberty in the name of no god

[Chorus:]
The pressure is mountain high
excuses are always the same
we're living beyond our time
still it won't make us change

I wanna drown myself in drink so I'm senselessly drunk. Pollution crowds around me and I wanna get fucked up.
But before they spend another billion on making it all worse I'm gonna set sail on a mission that we can save ourselves
Can we save our selves? Can we save ourselves
I'll trigger a reaction
In Flames
It's beautifully insane

[Chorus:]
The pressure is Mountain high
excuses are always the same
we're living beyond our time
still it won't make us change
everything's breaking down
excuses are always the same
we're living beyond our time
still it won't make us change

We've broken everything
