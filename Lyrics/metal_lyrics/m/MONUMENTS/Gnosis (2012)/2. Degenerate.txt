Lives dismantled
Piece by piece
shout!
Before our eyes
Powers disguise the truth
while we decline

We are useful idiots
and every time we think it's gonna change they're fuckin with us

Disaster makes them grip
Much harder round our necks
Discontent is all around

Having lost all physical and mental qualities I'm not considered to be normal or desirable I will degenerate back to a mindless fuck like a decaying human parasite Life's suicide

[Chorus:]
Why have all of our rights been violent in their deaths ?
Why are we are so benign and motionless on request ?
Oh when did they cease to protect individual rights forever we need They're breaking us up from inside

They start by erasing our memories to claim riches like spinal sinews tearing. Old cultures replaced.
Invent new history we forget what really was, in the struggle of man against power man will fall every time

[Chorus:]
Why have all of our rights been violent in their deaths ?
Why are we are so benign and motionless on request ?
Oh when did they cease to protect individual rights forever we need
They're breaking us up from inside

This is the day, this is the day we all die.
This is the day, this is the day we all.
This is the day this is the day we all die
This is the day we leave this sick world behind

Why can't I take a piece of your life, a piece of your life
