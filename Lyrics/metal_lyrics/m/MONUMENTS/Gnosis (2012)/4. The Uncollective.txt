I thought you'd be afraid
I knew you'd lose it all
Just like the ones before you did
Another one
You made it easier to hate you, hate you
You have glorified all fear
To manifest a cause
Betrayal from the ones that you know
All corrupt
No one is listening
Until you stop
You stop
Acting like gods

I can't see outside the night
I won't be inside this fight
What are you here for?
Why must you test me now?
Why are you fearful?
Should we all go back home?
And count down the hours
'Til it all comes to end
While desperate powers
Are fighting to keep their grip

Stop acting like you don't care
Stop preaching lies as the truth
What's the fucking point?
Of living lifeless like this [2x]
Step out from the known
Present me
With a new way of thinking
And a new way of living

What are you here for?
Why must you test me now?
Why are you fearful?
Should we all go back home?
Count down the hours
'Til it all goes to end
While desperate powers
Are fighting to keep their grip

This is the end
My body is lifeless and unforgiving
