System - Disorder - Infection
Disease supports our lives
donât respect us
we wont respect nothing
mankindâs only enemy comes from within
We are witnessing a plague
Nations in crisis
I feel maladjustedÂ  from these timesÂ 
so Iâm taking back whatâs mine

Misled from nature
tainted by pictures and shaded by fear
break through the blind obstructions built on lies.
Enslaved by the cycle tainted by pictures and shaded by fear
surpass the souls we lost

Its all money - interest - value
weâre enslaved behind this wall. Think!Â Â 
cut the cord and you will see who are righteous
are you not tired ofÂ  letting the elite reignÂ 
we should all feel ashamedÂ Â 

Something has got to give
everyone has to knowÂ Â 
this aint no way to live
this system has got to go
I cant breathe in the air has got so thick
patterns keep repeating nothing can stop themÂ 
and I die inside every time I hear them lie

Misled from nature
tainted by pictures and shaded by fear
break through the blind obstructions built on lies.
Enslaved by the cycle tainted by pictures and shaded by fear
surpass the souls we lost
