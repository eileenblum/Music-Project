I prevent the bullshit lies
Never thinking for a second death could be the fall of me
it's a long way down for us
and now they sing

on a quair drinking a part of human wreckage all alone
we see it Ritual mind control
well I'm not basking in the crimson illuminating filth of the earth

I feel like we will never feel
destruction is the one that I obey
dysfunctional is nothing new
believe me when I told there's no comforting answer
I feel like we should never feel
confusion is a part of every day
I'm tired of being so afraid
they're poisoning the goo of our despair

oh we should stop lying to ourselves
we are the virus and there's no guaranty
war far survival were living in denial crash it all
there should we fail and cop with reality

antisocial behavior is the new crown
where fighting back is the start of a cursed war
Is the start of a war

oh we should stop lying to ourselves
we are the virus and there's no guaranty
war for survival this place false thinking political
living in denial crash it all with dignity outrage
the time will break us all
gotta do quick there's a new law
belies basking in the crimson illuminating filth of the earth

I feel like we will never feel
destruction is the one that I obey
dysfunctional is nothing new
believe me when I told there's no comforting answers
I feel like we should never feel
confusion is a part of every day
I'm tired of being so afraid
they're poisoning the goo with our despair
