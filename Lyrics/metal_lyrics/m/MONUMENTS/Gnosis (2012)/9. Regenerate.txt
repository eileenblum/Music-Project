Free from our bondsâ¨no longer alone never born we'll never dieâ¨
no need for crowns we wear the stars now an infinite fractal of light every grain contains them all
Once bound by choice there is no wrong and there is no right
The answers always clear the spaces in between we're choosing now to change we see the need to leave.
And we openly know were we belong
Justice will prevail as the regimes fall 
Nothings ever been this clear, no one needs to feel alone and change is set to seed but we need to take this new form.
Love is truly here we just need to let it breathe 
We have glimpsed a new aporia in the moon light of our gnosis but no sick world can grow,
its black and white evolve - dreams are like disease no wars just regenerate 
Why can't we grow just like some new flesh?
Cheating lords unlike this new death.
Why can't we grow under this new flesh there's no regrets for what we save
