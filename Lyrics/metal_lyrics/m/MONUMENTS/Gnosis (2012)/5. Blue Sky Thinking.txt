Infinite power,
surely hides in their faces,
what you didn't know,
we're ready to take them,
it's the time to act,
we will remain free,
We're ready for war,
'Cause we will not stop

I watch this world go running through our hands
we are paying a price for all the things we do not need
and the violence streams and I don't know
if we're living in another 1000 years of greed

Can we face these lies
'Cause I hate to think what more we will do wrong
we were born to rise
(Upgrade this world don't destroy it)
and our manifesto surely has to change

No, I won't be torn apart
By their bullshit thinking
No, I won't be torn apart

Strike my eyes,
I can't quite believe it
we are cold inside
for this blood is on our hands
crawl, there won't be a man controlled
I'm not paranoid so go fuck yourself
we'll start to change this scene

Here we are inside
a world of pain that isn't kind
Here we are inside
a world of pain
it won't go away, no

Will never go

And this world is turned into a nightmare,
The seizures in this hole won't go away
and it's hard for me to carry on
our everything fades to grey

Can we face these lies
'Cause I hate to think what more we will do wrong
we were born to rise
(Upgrade this world don't destroy it)
and our manifesto surely has to change

No, I won't be torn apart
By their bullshit thinking
no, I won't be torn apart
by their worldless actions
