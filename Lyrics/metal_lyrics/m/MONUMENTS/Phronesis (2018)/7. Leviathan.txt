We know it's all shit
This type of conversation
Leads us to the drinking fount
How many else have drowned
Now place your bets

You can put the world on me
With no regard
I'll take your heart
And throw it to the grave
Time can't change the world
Can't change the mood you're in
'Cause there's something
Evil guiding you

So let it go
We can't assume control
The only thing to hate
Is the hate you show
So let it go
We can't assume control
The only thing to love about this
No one knows

I, I can feel the way you move
I, I can feel the way you choose

But it's not your fault
You've got a bad case
And nothing can be saved
You're changing everything
Here and back, there's no room to breathe
I can't make you move
I can't make you choose you
There's something
Evil guiding you

Let it go
We can't assume control
The only thing to hate
Is the hate you show
So let it go
We can't assume control
The only thing to love about this
No one knows

I, I can feel the way you move
I, I can feel the way you choose
I, I can feel the way you move
I, I can feel the way that you choose

Every time you choose to
I can lose an age
Unpredictable
The sound it makes
Is something ominous
Tingles while
Crawling up my spine!
And explodes!
How can we live like this?

I can taste the cloud
As you shoot
Me down!...

Why can't this all just be over?

I, I can feel the way you move
I, I can feel the way you choose
I, I can feel the way you move
I, I can feel the way you choose
