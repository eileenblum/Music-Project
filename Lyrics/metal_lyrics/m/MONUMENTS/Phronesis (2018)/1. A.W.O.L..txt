Can anybody see me?
Does anybody here even wanna know?
Can anybody feel me?
The price paid for never letting go

No, I don't have the patience
Everyday just becomes a new hell
Open wounds become the basis
When words are knives

Can anybody see me?
Does anybody here even wanna know?
Can anybody feel me?
The price paid for letting go

Sure to make a fallen angel stand and find a way out
(Someone help me get out)
This life will make us, time will take us
Still we'll fight our own doubt
(Fight our own doubt)
Well aware there's no escape from the truth
No time to take a foreign way
Just someone help me get out
(Someone help me get out)

I am your rage unbound
The fuck you think man?
Don't you make a fucking sound!
On a life boat you'll find death
A haunted vessel just like the one inside that died alone
I hope you die alone

Can anybody see me?
Does anybody here even wanna know?
Can anybody feel me?
The price paid for letting go

I found a way to fight the silence
A real life collapse that doesn't show
Can anybody save me?
The price paid for letting go

Sure to make a fallen angel stand and find a way out
(Someone help me get out)
This life will make us, time will take us
Still we'll fight our own doubt
(Fight our own doubt)
Well aware there's no escape from the truth
No time to take a foreign way
Just someone help me get out
(Someone help me get out)

Everyday we bask in the sun
With no one to see you shine
Everyday that draws a brand new gun
Drop the hammer and blow me away now

(Everyday that draws a brand new gun
Drop the hammer down and blow me away)
Blow me away
Drop the hammer down
Blow me away
