I wouldn't feel this way
If you would come back down for me
I wouldn't know this pain
If you would send it all away
Right now!

With every breath that you take
That you lose
That you would pay for
Something should start to
Move out!
Get out!

I wouldn't feel this way
If you would come back down for me
I wouldn't know this pain
If you would send it all away
Right now

Big words
Big ideas come around
Big words
Big ideas come around
Right now big words
Big ideas come around
You're nothing special
I've heard it all
Big words
Big ideas come around
You're all something special

With every breath that you take
That you lose
That you would pay for
Something should start to move out
Well, if life is just a chance
Come on and take the hand

I wouldn't feel this way
If you would come back down for me
I wouldn't know this pain
If you would send it all away

Move out!
Get out!

We'll run and you'll never stop us
You'll rot and we'll never stop
