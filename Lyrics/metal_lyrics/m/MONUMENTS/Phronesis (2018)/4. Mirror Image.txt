The stories that we live
Begin to take their toll
Another day, another debt to pay
Even though there's a stage, there's a stage
That's just made for you

Nothing really matters!

What is the truth?
Where is the promised land?
If I make a mistake
Then you can chase me down
With such irreverence
Wide awake we try to make the stars align
But they promise only dreams

Every day's a catastrophe
When you wake up green
And you're going nowhere
I can't define this space
What is this face the moment's gone

Every day's a catastrophe
When you wake up green
And you're going nowhere
I can't defend, I can't evolve
We're going all the way down

All around
There's a world that would like to know
They got a right to know
I push you back with my fist
Just to let it hit the ground
I see you
I feel you
I need you back

Do you remember when the world was just a fact
Don't make no mistake while it sends you back
Every day you find a way to keep it all on track
Don't get no relief while the mirror bends your image

If it was there
Now it's dead to me
The whole thing starts to crack
A fucking tragedy
No more that I can say
I need you back...

Hey there is no way
I would want to go alone again
I wouldn't take you there...

And you knew
'Cause it's true
I wouldn't take you there again

And if I could turn back time
I wouldn't hesitate
To take it all back

Do you remember when the world was just a fact
Don't make no mistake while it sends you back
Every day you find a way to keep it all on track
Don't get no relief while the mirror bends your image
Do you remember when the world was just a fact
Don't make no mistake while it sends you back
Every day you find a way to keep it all on track
Don't get no relief while the mirror bends your image

While the mirror bends your image
While the mirror bends your image
