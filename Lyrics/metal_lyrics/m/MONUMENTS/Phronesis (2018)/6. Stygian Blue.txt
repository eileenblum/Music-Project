Hey, never gonna let me be
Fuck around with me constantly
Honestly
Leave me the fuck alone

Now let's talk about it
And take your place across the room
Something now that you can't assume
From the tomb shadows claw on the air
Through somewhat of a cold decision
And something that we call division
I'll never feel the same way anymore
It's fucking killing me

Deep down there, deep down where
The silence reigns and I can't trust myself
It's just not fair the whole way down
I keep begging to disappear

Hey, never gonna let me be
What the hell do you want from me?
Honestly
Leave me the fuck alone
And hey, what the hell did you let me be?
Fuck around with me constantly
Honestly
Leave me the fuck alone

Some day unknown
We can leave this all behind
Some day far along
We can step into the light
Ask yourself why now go this way
I never wanted to lose control
But you lied to me, battered me
Fucker, just give me back what you stole

What's done is done
There's nothing left but the ashes
You burned it down, burned it down
The way out, I can't make it

Hey, never gonna let me be
What the hell do you want from me?
Honestly
Leave me the fuck alone
And hey, what the hell did you let me be?
Fuck around with me constantly
Honestly
Leave me the fuck alone

Take me back and then we'll live again
Take me back and then forget again
Take me back and then we'll live again
Take me back and then forget about it
