I took this chance
I took the road unknown
To make this shakedown
Alone in the sea
I couldn't let you
I wouldn't bet you this moment
No time, never looking back
No time to second guess these eyes

You can take your life
All you have is rage inside
No one suffers
If you end this pain

(those shining lights)
Shining lights are spirals
Meant to save your life
I'm holding onto something
Take a look
(shining lights)
Consequences of these actions
Come to light
Over and over
And over and over
(those shining lights)
Shining lights are spirals
Meant to save your life
I'm holding onto something
Take a look
(shining lights)
Consequences of these actions
Come to light
Over and over
And over and over
Going nowhere

Make it stop
I can't breathe
Make it stop
I can't breathe
Make it stop, make it stop
I can't stay, now is the time
The heart-ache falls silent
Wait, I changed my mind
It's too late to back up
No way out
They can't pretend that I didn't crawl
Now way out
They can't pretend, no they can't pretend

(those shining lights)
Shining lights are spirals
Meant to save your life
I'm holding onto something
Take a look
(shining lights)
Consequences of these actions
Come to light
Over and over
And over and over

(those shining lights)
Shining lights are spirals
Meant to save your life
I'm holding onto something
Take a look
(shining lights)
Consequences of these actions
Come to light
Over and over
And over and over
