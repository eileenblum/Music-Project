The truth is there
We can't deny the feeling
To know the end is to know yourself

To know the end is to know yourself
The truth is there
Know yourself
The truth is there

So if you've known all this time
Why would you go through all the trouble
To live an honest lie
Time can stand, I know you can't
Just wake from all this, wake from all this
Wake from the design

Nine on the fuse
With every time you choose
Every time you lose
Why, I'm confused
If you would let me go again
I would know
Just how far it goes
The nights I remember
Were dark and loud
Filled with violence (filled with violence)

You can tell by the look in their eyes
There's nothing left
Nothing left
I can tell by the look in your eyes
There's nothing left
Nothing

So stop and stare
They come without a feeling
What's looking back
Isn't who you know
It's like a dream
That's always there
You want the truth
The whole damn thing
Feels fucking hollow

The eyes of the vacant will speak to you
We stop and stare calling out to nowhere

You can tell by the look in their eyes
There's nothing left
Nothing left
I can tell by the look in your eyes
There's nothing left
Nothing

You can tell by the look in their eyes
There's nothing left
Nothing left
I can tell by the look in your eyes
There's nothing left
Nothing

The truth is there
We can't deny the feeling of our death
To know the end is to know yourself
