Life is just a stage
To know what's true, to be again
Light is just a wave
To bend who we are, who we are

He's now who's got the fire inside
A better life to make, I'll leave it to you
'Cause you could change it all, you could change it all

You watch the world
I'll take for granted every mile
You watch the world
I'll take the heed of every mistake I've made
And find my way

Life is just a game
You know the time is just a pain
Your life
The lives that we live we take out
What you say is not meant for me
You could ignite the world
But you love to bleed

He's now who's got the fire inside
A better life to make, I'll leave it to you
'Cause you could change it all, you could change it all

You watch the world
I'll take for granted every mile
You watch the world
I'll take the heed of every mistake I've made
And find my way

You watch the world
I'll take for granted every mile
You watch the world
I'll take the heed of every mistake I've made
And leave my name
