Now that we both are laid
The time elapsed the foolish conscious
Building for me all the famine
We will leave
We are the sands of this land
Come and set him free
This power lapses every minute we bleed
Away the sacred prophesy
Looking down
The time is spent
Beyond our days
You rang, would you believe?
Would you believe in me
You make ready, youâre safe âTill you trust me, yeah
Should you believe
You make ready, youâre safe
To live as that which is planned
Closest to the heart
At first
At last
The war we may get into
Into the sand
Of our past
From the first encounter
Remainder
Youâve already made
This place that we once
Speak to find ourselves
A place defined of our roles
Of our rule
You make me the same
The same deity
Youâll be crusades of kings
Youâll shape the greater part of me
We never take or leave a lie
Open the way
The chosen man turned up to fight
Soaring, would you believe this time?
Turn all your hate into greed
Another life to compete
We are the greater mystique
We are one
Turn all your hate into greed
Another life to compete
We are the greater mystique
Destined to die
Now walk with me
Would you believe in me
You make ready, youâre safe âTill you trust me, yeah
Should you believe
You make ready, youâre safe
To live as that which is planned
Would you believe in me
You make ready, youâre safe
To trust this lie
Should you believe
You make ready, youâre safe
To live as that which is planned
You think youâre better than me
You think youâre better than she
You think youâre greater than
I do
