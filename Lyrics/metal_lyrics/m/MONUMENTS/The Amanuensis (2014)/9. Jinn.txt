A devil sent me your gift as it was taking up
Your face from the deck
Coalescing into wisps from the void
Where you'll spread your words in time
All the heads in the middle of the circle
Take an unfamiliar fate
A drop cuts the eye of sleep
Wanting to know my name
I am nothing but the way down
I could not ever rest my sorrows
All these secrets will unravel
To become greater than the factions
That he murdered and so stole
Oh!

Now there is a point
Insight disguised within myself
Fighting to resist the hand I'm played
If you have to speak this way
If you have to speak this way
If you have to speak this way you forfeit your right

To leave this place
(A vicious cycle holding on)
To leave this place
(And you regain the cycle whole)
We leave this place
(Cause we know, we know)
We leave this place
We know where we're going all the better

Now make us the same!
Taking over
Taken over
Make us the same
Taken over
Fake out in the end
For nothing must end

But the way down
I could not ever rest my sorrows
All these secrets will unravel
To become greater than the factions
That he murdered and so stole

(The silence speaks)
All these secrets come undone
Taking me over, over!
(The silence speaks)
