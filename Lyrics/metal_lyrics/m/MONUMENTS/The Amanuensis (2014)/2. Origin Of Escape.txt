Remain obsolete
Itâs better they think that the fire has taken us all
We run

No moment to wait or take your time
And theyâre hoping that it stays this way
My escape through the night
We distinct rebel
Taking to flight

[Chorus:]
Remain unforeseen
Weâre awaken the fire devised from the ash of my cells
Remain obsolete
Itâs better they think that the fire has taken us all
Make way run

Onward
Like they took the first corrupted keepers
Witnessing the truth seeking two

Roses
This retribution will fall
Pieces of denial
The time will come to pay

Roses
My intention suffers
The living in time
Will thrive

[Chorus:]
Remain unforeseen
Weâre awaken the fire devised from the ash of my cells
Remain obsolete
Itâs better they think that the fire has taken us all
Make way run
