We all live in a world where thoughts are overtaken by chaos.
Realize I can't live with this, I'm living life in the sick.

Designed benign, how could you ever know there is a better way?
There is a better way!

No more (no more)
Being run around (become the light)
If I (if I)
The world bends around me, become the tide
Through standing this harm, become the tide

The world surrounds me.
I'm alone, but I make the most of borrowed time.
Forever eternal, the terms of old.
Whispering in secret, theyâre questioning it

Who am I
To fight his lighting line of creation?
Who will fight
Foretold ages sent of mystic voices?

Think with your memory
Think for your family
Everything's written for one
Redefine
We'll change everything, I know that we can do this

Hold on a love-line
As all burns
The world bends around me become the tide.

The devil's deep inside [3x]

I see it as undone
Do what it ever takes
(Taking over)
Let it all go
(Taking over)
Let it all go
You wanna make it, it's already gone awry.

It's a ring of fire
Through standing this harm, it's already...gone
They'll step on your will,
they'll stand on your faith,
they'll wither you down to nothing and then some.

It's better to hold deep and stand alone
Having spent this quest without questioning it.

Who am I
To fight his lighting line of creation?
Who will fight
Foretold ages sent of mystic voices?

Think with your memory
Think for your family
Everything's written for one
Redefine
We'll change everything and all that we survive
