Falling shadow of
Beneath us, wander without a lead
Burning descent
We are framed to think
"It would be nice to lay in Paris or Venice, I'm blind"
Lost in the fire and feeling no doors
Lost on my descent

We know we'll
We're so delicious to me
I loathe this time

Save this confirmation until the revelry
Ooh let it all go
Life
We're all lost in the desert of pain
Safer than the seas now
How can we live between the pulse?
When must self flee think
Or is this all

We know we'll
We're so delicious to me
I loathe this time
Now we know we'll
We're so delicious to me
I loathe this time

Who would deny that I can see him next to me?
Such a creation that achieves
A violent formality
Holding that I remember me
Taking back our mystery
Let it be, let it be
Judging instead by the man inside
Jews can make its way to life
Stupid and blind
Who could deny?
Who would deny you're one of me?
One of me
Make it go
I am inside all of my chaos
Who would deny?
Who would deny that I can feel our fate?
Or so many
Nothing's forsaken, no matter, there is hope

Be the change
Or learn to be returned to the endless
Who am I to feel this way?
Be the change
Or learn to be returned to the endless
Who am I to feel this way?
