And there is death in the air everywhere (all around me)
Through the night I won't make it anymore (no)

But I forget that I couldn't make all the same bad mistakes
Like the ways of the ancients, everything has to change
I would do anything to remove and erase
Just denial face to face
Who wouldnât take my place?

Hey, are you the Garden of Sankhara?
Hey, are you the sound of time?
You know the mess that awaited me
Or did I see you there?
A better soul that you made of me?
Yeah, theyâre dancing on your fucking death

I'm moving to a place
that I can reshape
these god damned vines
(I know on your own you will fall)
I'm moving to a place
that I can't escape,
I hope they let me stay alive
(I know on your own you will fall)

But I forget that I couldnât make all the same bad mistakes
Like the ways of the ancients everything has to change
I would do anything to remove and escape
Just denial face to face
Who would you dare to bring back to me?

Who's in the mirror that Iâm near to see in between
The misty state of this waking dream
And standing at the fall
Reflection lead the way
Reflection lead the way

Hey, are you the Garden of Sankhara?
Hey, are you the sound of time?
Destiny, a hollow ghast that a patient sees,
Or are you really there?
Hey, are you the sound of life?

You know the mess that awaited me
Or did I see you there?
A better soul that you made of me?
Theyâre dancing on your fucking death
