Ways have changed,
guiders of the open wind you make me understand,
again and again you make the same mistakes,
I can't ask to make that change,
their bodies official,
the guardians of the stream.

[Chorus]
Now, we're sailing across the world,
provided a place to stay,
Whatever the cost that makes us different,
dare to look away.
For better or worse I'm sure,
we'll ride along this wave,
Whatever the cost that takes us distant,
Dare to walk that way

The great,
ocean,
takes,
laughter,
with,
hollowing,
how could we live inside of a ship that's been slowly abandoned,
Taken by the cold?

We're drifting away,
We're drifting away,
We're sailing away,
We're sailing away.

[Chorus]
Now, we're sailing across the world,
provided a place to stay,
Whatever the cost that makes us different,
dare to look away.
For better or worse I'm sure,
we'll ride along this wave,
Whatever the cost that takes us distant,
Dare to walk that way
