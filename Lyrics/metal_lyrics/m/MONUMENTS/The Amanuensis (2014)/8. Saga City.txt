Sitting on answers
That time makes its crown
And divides ourselves into questions
Do you remember that life at the bottom of the well
in the city, where all is one with all?
Reminding us both that we chose to make this place our vessel of deliverance

We're falling deep, bound to each other
Somewhere calling out until the end of time.
Break out the silence, hold it close until it throws me

So far away, the living memory, the blood of yesterday
The part of me that wouldn't die or let the story lose its way
I don't know where you stand
But I will bring this plan into a higher place
So soullessly, I dedicated my love for Saga City

But then they came down and corrupted his sights
Brothers with throats cut [by] knives and they scream
And takes down with [?] violence, wisdom, moving like thieves in the night
Thrive!
I wouldn't kneel before you I wouldn't call you king
With that, I'll take my leave and set the stage for your death!
I'll set the stage for your death and escape with the tomb

We're falling deep, bound to each other
Somewhere calling out until the end of time
Break down the silence that shakes these walls with greater feeling

So far away, the living memory, the blood of yesterday
The part of me that wouldn't die or let the story lose its way
I don't know where you stand
But I will bring this plan into a higher place
So soullessly, I dedicated my love for Saga City

We'll break
You love this bowl of sin and treachery
Focus down on this
Who the fuck do you really think you are? (Yeah!)
Who the fuck do you really think you are, Father?
