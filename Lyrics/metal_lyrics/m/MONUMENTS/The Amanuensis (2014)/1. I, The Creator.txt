I, The Creator
in spite of making this
all I breathe
I'm sitting soulless
in moments unforeseen

but I
long to feel the breeze
bound by this disease
scars to take the place
of open channels
with no stream
I've got the answer
do I dare to heed?

believe
all things in effect
will surely grow
for now
solace is the mission
given to the organized
pick a fucking side
with us or against us
we're moving
forward
for now

this is the end
of promises made
that were never meant
to hurt
(let it go, let it go)
forget what I said
I just want to
watch you burn
for promises made
that were never meant
to hurt you
(go, let it go, let it go)
forget what I said
I just wanna
watch you burn

and if my time just came
back to me
I wouldn't change a thing
ablaze, this apparition burns

your power is your own
value the human spirit
condemn yourself
or choose to live

no more
we will form as one
ready to fight you
with no surrender
we are ready to

believe
all things in effect
will surely grow
for now
solace is the mission
given to the organized
pick your fucking side
with us or against us
we're moving
forward
for now

this is the end
of promises made
that were never meant
to hurt
(let it go, let it go)
forget what i said
i just want to
watch you burn
for promises made
that were never meant
to hurt you
(go, let it go, let it go)
forget what i said
I just wanna
watch you burn

no more
we will form as one
ready to fight you
with no surrender
we are ready to
rise
