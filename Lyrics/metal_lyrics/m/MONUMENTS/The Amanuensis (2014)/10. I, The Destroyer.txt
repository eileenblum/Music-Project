And I will rid the earth!

Oh, pestilence aside
And shape the world as I seize it
So insignificant, all that you control

Bow to me, guaranteed
Defined in silence
I am the consequence of hate
And this has gone through flesh, with the blood of victims

There's a light at the end
You better go right now
For the sake of apologies that were not accepted

Offer your fee of your death and sign
My own identity will escape!
This is the end

Oh this world
Bound within the same cycle
A fading memory that must be destroyed

I redefine this life of fain [?]
Fain torture exquisite[?]
Everything alive
Bathed in bloods of purity

Imagine me, the gods above no doubt will see this
Never take such confidence in the things that will burn your flesh [?]
In a blind obsession?

There's a light at the end
You better go right now
For the sake of apologies that were not accepted

Offer your fee of your death and sign
My own identity will escape

There's a light at the end
You better go right now
For the sake of apologies that were not accepted

Offer your fee of your death and sign
My own identity awaits

Oh, I am the destroyer
Father of evil
I'm the god of chaos

This place within the realm
Never felt so perfect beneath the slavery
All the time we spent just allowed if all things were peace
Over the edge of this place we leave before us

I'm at the edge of this place before us
Try going down

There's a light at the end
You better go right now
For the sake of apologies that were not accepted

Offer your fee of your death and sign
My old identity will escape

There's a light at the end
You better go right now
For the sake of apologies that were not accepted

Offer your fee of your death and sign
My own identity awaits!

This is the end! [7x]
