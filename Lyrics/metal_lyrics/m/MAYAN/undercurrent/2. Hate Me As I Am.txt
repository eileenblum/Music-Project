All that I've believed
Search your verity
You'll see we have been deceived

Burn the sucking liars and the honey licking mad men
Hurt your feelings now, you will heal
Burn the sucking liars and the honey licking mad men
Hurt your pride now
Keep your fire alive

Burn fast
Fight, bleed
Be free at last

As I will reign, fueled by pain
Ask nor demand, 'cause you are insignificant
I'll bring you down with disdain
Yes you can, hate me as I am

All that you've conceived
Your identity
Is just an illusion, a dream

Burn the sucking liars and the honey licking mad men
Hurt your feelings now, you will heal
Burn the sucking liars and the honey licking mad men
Hurt your pride now
Keep your fire alive

Burn fast
Fight, bleed
Be free at last

Be someone that you wish to be
Do not hide, don't give in to fear
Be the one
What you want to be
You'll receive
Be free

As I will reign, fueled by pain
Ask nor demand, 'cause you are insignificant
I'll bring you down with disdain
Yes you can, hate me as I am

Stand up and tear down lie infested walls
Channel your anger, strike them 'til they fall

As I will reign, fueled by pain
Ask nor demand, 'cause you are insignificant
I'll bring you down with disdain
Yes you can, hate me as I am

Hate me
Hate me
