Scum of the earth
Crawling in fear
Swarming in gloom

Under the sign
Leading the blind
Into decline

Never alone, all victims unite
Victims unite

Follow the hordes
Twisting the words
Twisting the truth

Feeding on lies
Feeding on fear
Left magnetized

We are born to face the storm
Within time most
Fall into oblivion

While silence cries

Culture collapse
Follow like rats
Without a doubt
Into the abyss
Into decay

Veils of deceit
Warming the weak
With deafening lies

Betraying regime
Taking control over narrow weak minds

We are born to face the storm
Within time most
Fall into oblivion

As silence cries
Buried deep in solitude we die

Wake up, fools!
Could you not see?
The hypocrisy
Manipulation by fear
When blind men lead the blind sheep
They'll fall

No more lies
Can you not see?
The hypocrisy
Falsification of truth
Break the chains
Set yourself free

Wake up, fools
Could you not see?
The hypocrisy
Manipulation by fear
When blind men lead the blind sheep
They'll fall

No more lies
Can you not see?
The hypocrisy
Falsification of truth
Breaking the chains
We will be free

Don't fear the strength of a force that you can't see
Mind the deception they all create
Coping with sorrows we've placed on others
Burn the lies and empathize

We are born to face the storm
Within time most fall into oblivion
As silence cries
Buried deep in solitude we die

The age of deceit overcome
Reject your gut
Without evidence overrun

With fear and ignorance

Your vision will clear
Your vision's clear

Persevere!
Severe!

Persevere!

The mourning is near

We are born to face the storm
Within time most
Fall into oblivion

While silence cries
Buried deep in solitude we die

Refuse
Foreclose
Stand up and deflect their gaze
Unity will be the key
Resisting the confined
Eradicate the colony

Run
Hide
Run away

We are born to
Fall into oblivion
We are born to
Face the storm
Fall into oblivion

Run away if you can't stand
The aftermath of decadence
Dig your own pitfall

Or heed your final call
