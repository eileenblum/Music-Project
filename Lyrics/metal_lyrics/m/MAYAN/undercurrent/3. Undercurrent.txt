Before you had realized
You wouldn't ever see your end
The truth shining down a light
It was a sign that made you reach within

Seek and find me
Daring to lose your control
Takes much courage
There ain't light at the darkest night of the soul

Rise from the dark night of the soul
You will not ever fall again
Embrace all that's come before
It's been a lesson now your hearts will mend

Seek and find me
The world you have embraced
Has no meaning

Let it be and you will be free
Try to seek and find me
Daring to lose your control
Takes much courage
Doubt your mind and ignore your pride
Let it be and you will be free
As there ain't light at the darkest night

Know
Show
Grow

Fall
Fall in order to rise again
Fear
Don't be afraid to resume
Die
Die, as you will be born again
Be
Be what you are after all

Face
What your ego has shaped
Burn your chapters of bitterness
Show no mercy for all the madness
On your road to perdition

Fight what tries to bring you down
Deal with all your enemies

Follow your heart, search for the only way out

Die before death takes it all

You won't fall

Seek and find me
The world you have embraced
Has no meaning
Let it be and you will be free
Try to seek and find me
Daring to lose your control

Takes much courage
Doubt your mind and ignore your pride
Let it be and you will be free
As there ain't light at the darkest night

Know
Show
Grow

Know
Try to seek
Show
Lose control
Grow
Let it be
