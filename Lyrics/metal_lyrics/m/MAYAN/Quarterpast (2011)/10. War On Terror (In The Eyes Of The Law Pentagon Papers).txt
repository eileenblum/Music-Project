Drop the grey curtain and reveal
Your truly sharp intentions
Drop the weapons and appeal
To all your moral senses

Common sense
Indifference
Negligence

Innocence
Obedience
Impotence

Stop the sick falsehoods and reveal
Your goals and true intentions

Stop denial donât conceal
The devious inventions

Flaws of silent killers
No remorse for them

Those about to die
Will thank you from the afterlife

Youâre a licensed killer
But you will expire
Once your day has come
To bring your dirty deeds to light

Donât thwart our goals
Donât underrate us
Weâre in control
Of you all

When you kill civilians
Never show remorse

We have our excuse
We walk away without a bruise

You are allowed to commit
Very big mistakes
As long as theyâve been made
To benefit our greater good

Common sense
Indifference
Negligence

Innocence
Obedience
Impotence
