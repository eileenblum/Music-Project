[Bonus Track]Five times we will
Worship today

Wandering still
Facing the way

Five times I will worship you today
Towards the darkest stone

From crescent moon
To the gift from above
North is not the right direction

The great threat that we face is yet to come
Face your enemies

For echoed thoughts, they will not break this wall
Strong we stand against the faction

Forsee
Through the eyes of enemies

On the tenth day once upon a heated spell
Hands raised to the sky
When the dawn fell, over hungering souls
The zakat will save the desperate

Foresee
The outrage
Fore-reach
Guns showing the way
To the path that betrays

Under the starry moonlit sky
The only wish remaining died

Between our hope and disbelief
Is this the sinnerâs last retreat?

This is our destiny
Endure the pain, forgive enemies

Iâll rebuild the rubble from the ground
Return the foul spite

The Muezzin words are burning in me
Stern, redeeming retribution

As if hope avoided history
I just closed my eyes
As if life did accelerate
The moment that I died

Five times we will
Worship today

Wandering, still facing the way

Between our hope and disbelief
Is this the sinnerâs last retreat?

This is our destiny
Endure the pain, forgive enemies

If we revoke our sense of peace
Is this the sinners last defeat?

This is our destiny
Endure the pain and cure the disease

As if hope avoided history
Dreams that cannot be
Our salvation seeming so out of reach

Give features to these shadows filling up our memories
Give brightness to the fields again
Nature as a borderless promise
Feel it in your veins, breathe life!
Not the hate which makes you bleed to death

Five times we will
Worship today

Wandering still
Facing the way

During the night
I feel more at ease to be
Myself
So I prefer the day
To end and paralyze
The sun
So we can live
Without any constraints

How can the hardened hands that carry be so strong
How can a heart endure the stream of lying flowing on

Between our hope and disbelief
Is this the sinnerâs last retreat?

This is our destiny
Endure the pain, forgive enemies

If we revoke our sense of peace
Is this the sinners last defeat?

This has priority
Endure the pain in unity
