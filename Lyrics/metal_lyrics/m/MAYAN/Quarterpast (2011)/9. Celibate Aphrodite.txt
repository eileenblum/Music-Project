Don't you bite the hand that deeds
The one that cares for you
And gratifies its needs
Don't you cry about a touch
And trust
Unless it gratifies the lust

Celiabate Aphrodite
Blind faith betrayed

Don't you fight against your needs
We're men of flesh and blood who justify their deeds
Don't you cry about a touch
And bust
All that remains of our trust

Celibate Aphrodite
Blind faith betrayed

Life begins
Where time has stopped
I'm hiding myself
In places
You will not find
You'll never find

Don't you hide for life is grand
We want the best for you
We guide you to the promised land
Don't you cry about your sins
It's lust
The reason why you tried to tempt us

Celibate Aphrodite
Blind faith betrayed

Life begins
Where time has stopped
I'm hiding myself
In places
You will not find
You'll never find
Life begins
When you'll be gone
I long for the day
The traces
Will never fade
You'll surely pay

The sinner asks for forgiveness
But only with a gun to his head

Veri mostri che agiscono da santi
Solo per aver cio' che gli manca
Ma alla fine costoro non avranno
Che totale vuoto dentro
l'anima

My time has come
I served the Father
With all my strength
The work is done
I'm feeling empty
But satisfied

The wall collapsed
They couldn't hold it longer
The fear is written on their faces
Life goes on but justice found its way

We are just human
With the faults and mistakes
What about silky soft seduction
We can't resist our fates
But minds your own business
Your pagan soul will burn at the gates

My time has come
I've served the Father
With all my force
What I've become
I have accepted
Without remorse

The sinner asks for forgiveness
But what would you do?
