Fear is the false adviser
As the tension rises, the senses blur
Break into a cold sweat
And fall into an utter randomness

I can't decide
Determination without
Power of persuasive thoughts

Avoid the assassin
Which kills your thoughts
Creates delusions
Accept your weakness
It happens to be
The key to be free

I can't decide
Determination without
Power of persuasive thoughts

Wake me
For I have been
Derailed

Strangle me
Save me from atrophy
All that I want to feel
Is the ultimate peace
Flowing through me

Caught in a web
Failing to pull myself out

When the dawn entangles all that's hidden in the dark
I know that my incentives to go on cease to be of my own choosing

I can be hard to take responsibility
For your own deeds within your life
But it's the only way in frail fantasies
Forgive yourself and ease your mind

Forlorn
Betrayed
Forlorn
Betrayed by the ego, by obsession
A symphony of aggression

Tracing your false desires
The internal traitor ignites the fire
Unleash the burden
Release yourself from cheap satisfactions

The lies you've been telling yourself over and over again
Created a state of indifference
And make you slowly lose hold of your identity

Can't get my satisfaction
From the ordinary
Can't find my peace of mind
In high class sanctuaries

I strike left and right
The language that I master
Force me
To suffer
The price to pay

I bash and beat you down
My way to get things done
The final word is mine
So hold your nasty tongue

Wake me
For I have been
Derailed

Fallen into a deep hole
Caught in a web
Failing to pull myself out
It's a good horse that never stumbles
But they have made to much of him
