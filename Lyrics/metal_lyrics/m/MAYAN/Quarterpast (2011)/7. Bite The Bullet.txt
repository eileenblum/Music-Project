I am inflexible
There is no way
To break my discipline and strength

My endless loyalty
For my fatherland
Fills me with dignity
That no one understands

When do we get some explanations?
About what happened there at last
This deprivation
By the pride of our nation
This is the reason to conceal

Serving the Nation
Iâd give my life for
With no regrets

Rule out the predators
At every cost
I feel no pity for all the renegades who died

The pride of the soul
Forever guilty

The legion of the fall
Into disgrace

Families have been torn apart and mourn
The silence of defeat
A thorn in the flesh
One deep scratch
But the lies live on

When do we get some explanations?
About what happened there at last
This deprivation
By the pride of our nation
This is the reason to
Turn around the point of view

Pride of the Nation
We are forsaken

When do we get some explanations?
About what happened there at last
This deprivation
By the pride of our nation
This is the reason to
Turn around the point of view

We are forsaken
By each and every one of you
Donât forget what youâve failed to do

Watch out!
We are forsaken
Beware!
By every one of you
Hold on!
Donât forget that you have failed in every way

The pride of the soul
Forever guilty

The legion of the fall
Into disgrace

Families have been torn apart and mourn
The silence of defeat
A thorn in the flesh
One deep scratch
But the lies live on

When do we get some explanations?
About what happened there at last
This deprivation
By the pride of our Nation

Deprivation
No confrontation
This is the reason to march on

Stand ground
Beat down
And conceal
