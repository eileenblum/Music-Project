(Course of life)

We keep on searching
We donât know what to do

The hunt is on

Weâre lost in choices
And are unable to
Find the true essence of life

Itâs the lack of empathy
We do not care
An escape in solitude

(Course of life)

Weâre discontented
With things we have to do

We want our share

We canât dispose of
And are unable to
Drive out this fatal disease

The absence of emotions
And no time for charity
Created icy oceans
Filled with selfishness
And hypocrisy

We are indulgent
If we can benefit as well

Care for the canine
But hack and chop the pig to hell

The absence of emotions
And no time for charity
Created icy oceans
Filled with selfishness
And hypocrisy

All thatâs left is cold, dead bodies
Without a soul
Just raised to be slaughtered

Looking upon these cold, dead bodies
Gone are their souls
Just wasted for slaughter

Keep fighting for the rights of animals
Stay focused âtill you find your way

Beyond the veil Iâve seen
The end of destiny

The absence of emotions
And no time for charity
Created icy oceans
Filled with selfishness
And hypocrisy

Beyond the veil Iâve seen
The end of destiny
The cycle takes us in
We end were we begin

The absence of feeling
And unwillingness to see
Prevents us from healing
Old wounds
No recovery
