Fraud is the way to supremacy
Be brave where others do not dare
Weâre only asking for your loyalty
In a kind and friendly way

Corruption is the mainstay of society
To keep us ruling in the world
Weâre only asking for your loyalty
But will not ask it twice

Weâre above the law
And weâre set to make the call

And the lies we sent
Lead to the end
To justify the means

Weâre above it all
And weâre bent to make you crawl

For the fear we spread
Will justify the scene

All that I have already
Is not enough for me
When I canât get the honey
I wipe out the bees

All that I did already
Is not enough to be
The only dominator
Make way for me

Lies are needed for the unity
The masses crave their fairy tales
Weâre only asking for your loyalty
And by force if need shall be

Weâre above the law
And weâre set to make the call

And the lies we sent
Lead to the end
To justify the means

Weâre above it all
And weâre bent to make you crawl

For the fear we spread
Will justify the scene

I am the abused inventor
of corruption and deceit
I am the undaunted swindler
I am your government

All that I have already
Is not enough for me
When I canât get the honey
I wipe out the bees

All that I did already
Is not enough to be
The only dominator
Follow the ruler
Or get away from me

Purjury, the legal way
to justify when gaining ground
A terrorist who can be found
As change for black gold

Purjury is no offense
for dignitaries and presidents
Open up, dig it out
Open up the files

All that I have already
Is not enough for me
When I canât get the honey
I wipe out the bees

All that I did already
Is not enough to be
The only dominator
Make way for me

All that I have already
Itâs not enough for me
I just want all the honey

All that I did already
Itâs not enough to be
Seen
