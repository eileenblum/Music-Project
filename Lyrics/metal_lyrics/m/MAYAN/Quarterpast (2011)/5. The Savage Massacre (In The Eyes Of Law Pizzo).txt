Courage, the overture to bring about a change
The first will be remembered as a hero
From the grave
They will gain status that could open the cage
Before our rights are emptied to zero

You decide
Pay the low or highest price
Sacrifice

Who hold the rights
(To) bind and dissuade us
Cities in lights
Shield their sadists

Cowardice, progression to oppression and decay
It ceased to be the answer for all
Soon you will see
In the long run loyalty will never be repaid
Comformity is spelling out your doom

Who hold the rights
(To) bind and dissuade us
Cities in lights
Shield their sadists

Sta bruciando qua
Una manaccia
nessuno ti aiutera`
Sta bruciando qua
Una manaccia
Il fumo nella citta`

You decide
Pay the low or highest price
Sacrifice
Savage Bastards
Good for nothing
