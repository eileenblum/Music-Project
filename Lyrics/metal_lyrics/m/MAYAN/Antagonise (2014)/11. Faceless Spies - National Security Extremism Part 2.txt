It if as if no one cares
It if as if no one cares
Faceless spies
Messing around with our rights
It if as if no one cares

It if as if no one cares
Faceless spies
Licensed to do whatever they want

Playing the terrorist card
Holes in the wall
Run for a fall
Living a lie to survive
To dominate
And eliminate
Resist, an eye for an eye

Will we find a way out of this swamp you're stuck?
Or don't we feel the need?
Decide
We can say we have nothing to hide
Pay the price
Feel free to screen us

It if as if no one cares
It if as if no one cares
Faceless spies
Licensed to look through our eyes
It if as if no one cares

Playing the terrorist card
Holes in the wall
Run for a fall
Living a lie to survive
To dominate
And eliminate
Resist, an eye for an eye

Will we find a way out of this swamp you're stuck?
Or don't we feel the need?
Decide
We can say we have nothing to hide
Pay the price
Feel free to screen us

The biggest enemy of freedom is not the outer world
It's your own inertia, your indifference

In the eye of the law
We've got the power
But elites keep deciding for us
Exercise
This world of ice
Together we'll fight deceit

Out in the dark you cannot hide
In the back of beyond they'll be coming after you
In the dungeons of the soul there is room for this beast
That devours all that, reveals the truth
You've been fined to survive
You've been banned for life
Just disappear but remember that we're always near

Out in the dark you cannot hide
Don't yield to mendacious authority
We're being led like lambs to the slaughter of identity
We will persevere until justice prevails
