When the night falls
The streets are full of rage
Weâre out for mayhem
Youâd better stay away

Bloodline forfeit
Anonymous threat
Bloodline deceit
Bloodline forfeit

We canât turn back time
Weâll have to face our acts
You canât fool around with trust
Forevermore

You wonât pass

When the nights falls
The streets are our domain
You canât hide yourself
Youâd better stay away

Our spirits will separate
Our blood will never blend
As the time goes by you will be forgotten
You wonât pass

Perdonar es debiladed
El precio de la traiciÃ³n es la muerte
