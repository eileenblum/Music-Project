Thousand of people
Right now
Are waiting to be executed
Thousand of people will die

Some of these people
In fact
Are totally innocent
But most of those people will die anyway

Quel che credi non fai tu
Se non paghi soffrirai

Thousand of people
Deny
But canât afford a proper defense
And most of those people have no chance

Some of these people
In fact
Get executed anyway
Even when there is no evidence

Feel the heat
The smell of burning flesh
The convicted screaming for grace
Itâs an entertaining spectacle

Quel che credi non fai tu
Lâinnocenza un prezzo ha
La condanna arriverÃ 
Compra la tua veritÃ
