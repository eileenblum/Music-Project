Great winds blow
Over steepest hills
Be prepared for this storm

It wonât fail
And it never will
You canât stop how itâs been formed

When an illusive obsession turns into hate
Youâve lost your mind, get yourself
Back on track

Burn your witches
Take back control
Meet your wishes
Donât drown yourself in
Hate that fuels your mind

Great winds blow
Over arid plains
Be prepared for this storm

It wonât fail
And it never will
Let it happen, let it go

Burn your witches
Take back control
Meet your wishes
Donât lose yourself
And gain the world

Great winds blow
Over deepest seas
Be prepared for this storm

It wonât fail
And it never will
You canât stop how itâs been formed

Burn your witches
Take back control
Meet your wishes
Donât lose yourself in hate
Burn your witches

Burn your witches
Take back control
Meet your wishes
Donât drown yourself in hate
Take back control
Burn your witches now
