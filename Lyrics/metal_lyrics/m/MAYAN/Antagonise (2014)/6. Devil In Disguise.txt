You did not swallow my lies
Insensitive to commands
You havenât listened at all
And disobeyed every call

Right on
Face it
You canât deny me
Right on
Face me
I am the devil in disguise

You did not swallow my lies
Just wait and see what remains of you
You will be better off dead
Time for the notable to judge

Destroy
Exterminate the root of all misery
Erase
Exterminate the source of all this poison

Destroy
Exterminate untruthful measures
Erase
The ugly dissonant

Right on
Face it
You canât deny me
Right on
Face me
I am youâre image
