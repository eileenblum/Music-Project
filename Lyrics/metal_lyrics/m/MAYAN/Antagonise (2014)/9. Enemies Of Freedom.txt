âthe only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun â 
is a good guy with a gun.â

Stand up and fight for values
Donât touch our self-defense
As our acquired rights are incontestable

Rise against those bastards
Who want to take control
Over all our ancient acquirements

You who are a threat of freedom
We canât accept more deaths, all caused by maniacs
Itâs a fundamental right of defend ourselves
But not at any cost in the world

You who will constrain our freedom
Thereâs a line to be crossed
Our safety will just decline through your acts
We wonât bleed for your quest to score

No!

When basic rights
Are at stake
Tension will rise
So many emotions
Clash

Donât strive for recognition
Demand what we deserve
As our noble duties are explicit

Declaw the cats and let coyotes attack
Is that what you aim for
Is that what you wanna get?

You, the fatal thrust to freedom
We canât ignore the mess all caused by lunatics
Itâs a sentimental charge without reason at all
We wonât bleed no more, fight another war

When basic rights
Are at stake
Tension will rise
So many emotions
Clash

âwhy is the idea of a gun GOOD when itâs used to protect the president of our country, or our police â but BAD when itâs used to protect our children in our schools?â

Di sangue sporche giÃ 
Le mani vostre sono
Fermate questo scempio
Del male ci farÃ 

Itâs not about the danger, it is about control
Itâs not about your safety
Youâre trapped in a preconceived pitfall

Itâs not about the weapons, it is about control
Itâs not about your safety
Youâre trapped within a mad and foolish rat race

When basic rights
Are at stake
Tension will rise
So many emotions
Clash and bash
