Achieve

Iâve defeated myself
Eternally
Iâll return into my pain
Silently and weak
All that Iâve missed
To hide myself in the dark
It must be hate without recognition
Embrace my pain

Reach out for me
I come for slaughter
Reset my mind
Till the end of time
Sway up for real
Try my pain
We canât go on here
I am undone

Iâve created myself
Nocturnally
I will make you share my pain
Silently and weak
All that I need
Is to step right out of the dark
It must be lies laced with devastation
Keeping me away

All I need is some recognition

The wolf is dead
Bring me his head
Colored in red
The wolf is dead
Bring me his head

Reach out for me
I come for slaughter
Reset my mind
Till the end of time
Sway up for real
I canât ignore this
We canât go on
I am undone
