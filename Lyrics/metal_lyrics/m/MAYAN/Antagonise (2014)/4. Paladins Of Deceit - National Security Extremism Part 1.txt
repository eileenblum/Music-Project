Run away, donât run away
Take your responsibility
Let your spirit flow, let your bias go
Let the storm take your veils away

Feed
Infallibility

Close your eyes, donât close your eyes
See through these fairly obvious lies
Let your spirit flow, let your bias go
Let the storm clear your gloomy sky

Run away, donât run away
If you dare to listen
Let your spirit flow, let your bias go
Let the storm take your veils away

Try to keep an open mind
Thereâs always something that liars canât hide

Freedom and privacy
Give them up
Itâs the end that justifies the means
Your silent secrecy
Give it up
For our own security

Close your eyes, donât close your eyes
See through these nasty lies
Let your spirit flow, let your bias go
Let the storm clear your sky

Run away, donât run away
If you dare to listen
Let your spirit flow, let your bias go
Take your veils away

Only an open mind can see reality
Only if you seek the truth, youâll get the truth
Only an open mind can see reality
Just those who want to be fooled, will be fooled

Freedom is just an illusion
Those who reign want to stay where they are
Freedom is just a Utopia
The masses have to be kept under control
