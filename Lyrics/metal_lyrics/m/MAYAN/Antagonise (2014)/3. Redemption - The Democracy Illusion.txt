An arms race
Another war
It goes on forevermore
They keep on fighting for supremacy
Donât find yourself a way to justify
Or remain a witness from the sidelines

Donât hesitate

We have to
Find a way to
Stop all this madness
Will we ever reach our goal?
Or give up and try no more
Get off your knees
And try at least

You cannot ransom your redemption
Youâve failed to pay

You donât want to face reality
Stuck in your old mentality

Let it be
Open your mind
There is much more to see

An arms race
Another war
Lost lives forevermore
To guarantee some future benefits

They tried to buy out their redemption
Youâve failed to pay

You donât want to be responsible
Always afraid to sink and lose control
Plagued by irrationality

Detect defects
And let the mob accept its fate
Secure effects
Convince the credulous

Control the fact
And make the mob believe in me
Avoid the traps
Set by our enemies
