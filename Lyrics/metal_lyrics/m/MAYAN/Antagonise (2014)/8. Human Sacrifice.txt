Deal with the one
Philosophy
Youâll have no choice
Dispose
Deal with the one
Supremacy
You will obey your superior

You have no choice than to follow the masses
You have no choice than to stick to your classes
You have no choice âcause you will not be like me

Human Sacrifice
Damned to give up your mind
One-eyed compromise
Born to be free
Not to be sacrified

Deal with the one
Authenticity
You will behave enslave
Deal with the one
Divinity
You wonât disparage
The godly marriage

Un peon mÃ¡s de los hambrientos de poder
No hay opciÃ³n seguir la orden o morir

Fight fire with fire
Defense of human shields
A war fuels atrocity
Shields of childrenâs hands
Nadir of human sacrifice

Gente nascosta
Timore dubbio
La nostra chiesa sicura
Non potranno bruciare
No!

I am just in time
To reach the top of lust
Forgetting what life needs to be
Focused on the magic crown
Which leads me to the dark profound
Canât sit still
Any time
Until the world is mine

Siamo noi che decidiamo
PerchÃ¨ noi siamo potenti autoritÃ 

You have a choice
Make up your mind
