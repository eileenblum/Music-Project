I convict you, liar
A life of madness on the wings of desire
One day we're forced to face each other
There's no escape, we've got to step into fire
Facing our lies

Change
Fate

Count all the scars formed by
Hate

Mind all your victims, don't be
Late
Change

Reap all you've sown up to date
Placate her, nature, with your life

Liar
A life of blindness for the things we admire
One day we're force to face another view
That won't match with our convenient vision
Turn on the light

Sensing all the flaws caused by your mind
You cannot be, without me
See, sensing biased fear of remorse all of this
Runs out of time
You cannot see, without me
Turn away from lasting agony

Wake your heart
Follow what you feel inside

Sensing all the caused by a thought
You cannot be, without me
See, sensing biased fear of remorse all of this
Runs out of time
You cannot see, without me
Save me from this dark insanity

Free yourself take fate into your hands
Travel with an open heart
Be the one to pass through solid matter
Use all your strength

See the universe in me
We are living in a dream

Free yourself, wake up your sleeping heart
Realize what you've become
Be the one who changes for the better

Be the one to see through all these lies
Use your mind as it's designed
Value all you are that truly matters
You are divine!

Timeless and grand
Timeless we stand

Magnificent
Never kneel down again
Kneel down again
Never again

Surgere
Sero te
Surgere
Teipsum salvum sero
Sero te

Lies passing in front our eyes
Burn all your links with the past
Standing always by your side
The guide inside

Wake your heart now
Follow the guide inside

Sensing all the flaws caused by your mind
You cannot be, without me
See, sensing the blased fear of remorse all of this
Runs out of time
You cannot see, without me
Sedate our madness, humanity

The die has been cast
We must make amends
Glimpse into unknown
See it before you die

This is the end
This is not the end of time
Wake up dead

Cure the insanity
