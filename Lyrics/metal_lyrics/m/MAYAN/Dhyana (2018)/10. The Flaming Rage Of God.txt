Fear the flaming rage of God
Hell awaits
Fear the anathema
Know your way out
Seek, to redeem your sins
Fear the judgment of mankind

I'm the bullet and the aim
The burning flame

Vengeance is mine
I will repay
I'm the pleasure and the pain
The balanced way

The source you can't betray

Liar, liar
Teach me all the lessons which I need to blame them all
Cheater, deceiver
Find me all the angels as I need to make them fall
Fear the final judgment, hunt the witches burn them all
Learn
Make you forget

Hell awaits
Fear the anathema
Know your way out
Seek, to redeem your sins

I am the failure and success
The final test
It is up to
Your willingness

I am freedom and constraint
Your choice to make

The wisdom that can't fail

Liar, liar
Teach me all the lessons which I need to blame them all
Cheater, deceiver
Find me all the angels as I need to make them fall
Fear the final judgment, hunt the witches burn them all
Learn
Make you forget

Satan left his prison
Threw his veil over mankind
He gathered sheep for battle
As the saints don't dare to fight

Lead us astray
False messiah

We'll gather now, all our angels
Our light will shine
And shield the truth from all your lies
We'll strengthen now, all our spirits
To fight your lies
And you will have to suffer

Dominance and power over others
See the weakness disguised as strength
Die

Liar, liar
Teach me all the lessons which I need to blame them all
Cheater, deceiver
Find me all the angels as I need to make them fall
Liar, liar
Show me what is mercy as I am without remorse
Cheater, deceiver
Find me all the angels as their light darkens my force
Fear the final judgment, hunt the witches burn them all
Learn
Let them all burn
Make them forget!

Heaven is a lie
