Here I am
The one dominator
Master of your mind
Father of illusion
I'm the flame who breaths your air

Here at the end of time, I'm without hope
You will never have to walk alone
Memories will fade away with time
These dark obsessive thoughts, they bring us down
The times we have shared
Spent as if we cared

Wonder how and wonder why
We can't stop the suffering
Once and for all
Fight, resist
Show no fear
In the moment of creation we are free
Doubt your eyes
Realize
I am always by your side

Here I am

In the light of day the truth will shine
To illuminate our cluttered minds
Like the star we'll rise
Forever as one
And leaves our past behind

Here I am
The one dominator
Ruler of your mind
Father of illusion
I'm the expert on demand

Here I am
The false perceiver
Possessor of your life
Mother of intrusion
I'm the step that you can't stand

Here at the brink of life, the pain rolls on
The demons in my head collide
Under the waves of cries
My grief begins to thrive forevermore

Living life too fast
Disguises emptiness

Paint like we have done before
Add some bright new colors
Find the way to free our minds
We can stop the suffering
Once and for all

Fight, resist
Show no fear
In the moment of creation we are free
Find the threat
All you hear
Emanates from your own head

Break the ties
Unbind your mind

Here I am

In the light of day the truth will shine
To illuminate our cluttered minds
Like the star we'll rise
Forever as one
And leaves our past behind

Libera te stesso
Non aver paura no
Cerca la tua via
Non sbaglierai

Look deep inside and try to imagine
Open your mind
Dive into our most profound discovery
Look deep inside and try to get closer
To your true self
How do you receive the nature of infinity

Right here I am
Here I am
Right here we are
Here I am
See, here I am
here I am
See, here we are all one

Look deep inside and try to imagine
Open your mind
Dive into our most profound discovery
Look deep inside and try to get closer
To your true self
How do you receive the nature of infinity

In the light of day the truth will shine
To illuminate our cluttered minds
Like the star we'll rise
Forever as one
And leaves our past behind

In the light of day the truth will shine
To illuminate our cluttered minds
Like the star we'll rise
Forever as one
And leaves our past behind
In the light of day
The road that shines
They're losing their life
See and leave our past behind

Wake up
Remove
The ties
Rise
Wake up
Open
The cage
Fly
In the moment of creation we are free
In the moment of creation we are one with all
In the moment of creation we can see
In the moment of creation we are on with everything

So, here I am
