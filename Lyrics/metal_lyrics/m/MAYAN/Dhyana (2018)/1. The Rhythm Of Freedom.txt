Ride, as we are born to be wild
Push your boundaries
Fight, as if were ready to conquer all the obstacles

Ride, put all your troubles aside
Drop your worries
Guide, light up the speed road that lies ahead
Sealed in sweat

I have the power
To let you rise

Ride, as we are born to be wild
Push your limits
Fight, as if weâre ready to conquer all the obstacles

Ride, move on, believe in yourself
Drop your shackles
Smile, move on with passion and disregard
Wicked guides

I have the power to let you shine
Do not betray me
Iâll let you fall

My prison of treason, prevail or die
Feed the force within, donât give up
The fight begins

Canalize your force
Keep your mind free of strain
Mesmerize, energize
Trust yourself and banish fear
Find your way to persevere

I have the power to make you shine
But if I want to Iâll drop you all

My prison of treason, prevail or die
Feed the force within, donât give up
The fight begins

The rhythm of freedom
Prevail or die
Dodging makes no sense
Donât fall prey to diffidence

Live your life intense and pure, realize your dreams
Do not wait to opportunity, create your destiny

Live as free as you can be to guard your legacy
Use your strength to reach your goals in life
Youâre one of a kind

My prison of treason, prevail or die
Feed the force within, donât give up
The fight begins

The rhythm of freedom
Prevail or die
Dodging makes no sense
Donât fall prey to diffidence

Ride, as we are born to be wild
Push your boundaries
Fight, as we are ready to turn away misery
