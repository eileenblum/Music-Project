Purification

Bound in detention
Of this dimension
Thoughts will keep me down
Waiting for judgment
Another torment
Save me from this hell

Reach out and catch me as I'm falling from grace
Dealt with all possible
Ways to survive

Save me. I've lost my mind
I'm mesmerized

As time went by
I've turned against myself
Set me free

The light of the world is dying

Don't let it all just rain on you
Fight
Allow yourself to face these lies

Open the small door to your heart
Fight for life
Try to reach your true self

Burdened with pressure
Fighting depression
Thoughts drive me insane

Waiting for judgment
Another torment
Save me from my sins

Save me, I've lost my mind
Without hope
I'm mesmerized

As time went by
I've turned against myself
Set me free
my worlds is dying
As time went by

I turned against myself
Set me free
The weight of the world is killing me
My world is killing me

Pull your guns, defeat the opposition
Turn the key, unlock this mind control
I own all the recipes for disaster
Blend them after all

Don't let your fear
Decide your fate
Transcend illusions now
Freedom is not for everyone

I'm the one, obey the only master
Follow me, I'm fully in control
You're the one
On the run
Realize I'm faster after all

Pull your guns, defeat the opposition
If you do not wish to see
Just make sure to shuffle all the cards
You'll never be
I own all the recipes for disaster
Burn them afterwards

Be the only master of your mind
Be the master
Realize you're one of a kind

Stay who you are
Conquer it all
Freedom!

As time went by
I learned to arm myself
Set me free
The light of the world is dying

As time went by
I've turned against myself
Set me free
The force of my heart will guide me
My heart will guide me
Your world can't harm me
Once and for all
