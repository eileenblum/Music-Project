Blinded by society's constrictions
We grope through the halls and the hollows
Soldiers, marching without conviction
Disarmed, we obey and we follow

Don't believe all you see
Find the truth that hides within you

Twist the chain around your master
Start a massive scale disaster

Tear down the norm
Reclaim the power
To find your purest form
To break the spell
And lead a life without restrains

Deprived of our most basic instincts
We'll act as the system requires
Forced to sacrifice all we believe in
For an illusion of freedom and comfort

Don't believe all you see
Find the truth that hides within you

Tear down the norm
Reclaim the power
To find your purest form
To break the spell
And lead a life without restrains

Leash
All the new spirits
Teach them lies
Speech
Inserts a weakness
It divides us all

It divides us all
Heal yourself, ignore the masses+

Watch the world through childlike glasses
Tears down the norm
Reclaim the power
To find your purest form
To break the spell
And find your one true self

Ignore the waves
And find yourself
In the arms of nature
