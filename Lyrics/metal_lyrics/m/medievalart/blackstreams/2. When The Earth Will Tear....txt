This world will cry 
When the Earth will tear and die 
Black clouds obscure the sun 
Mortals weep as all is gone 
...They'll cry! 

This world will cry 
When the Earth will tear and die 
Howling and gnashing of teeth 
They will mourn, they will grieve, 
They will weep 

Generations have burned in a day 
The survivors know, 
They won't remain 
As the tears of contrition flow 
Nothing changes 
The Fate of the world
