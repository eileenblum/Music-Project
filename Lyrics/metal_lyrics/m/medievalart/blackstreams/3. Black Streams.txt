I walk in the endless darkness 
The dusk fills the air 
Shall eternal pain be my share? 

We walk in the endless darkness 
The dusk fills the air 
Shall eternal pain be our share? 

Agony of the centuries 
Flowing down the black streams 
Thou shalt see with thy empty eyes 
As we drown in the streams
