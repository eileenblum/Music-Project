When the end of time is near 
Their silent words you hear 
Faith fills the void in life 
False hope in your heart 

Can't wait forever 
Have I believed in vain 
We're facing this together, 
The happiness and pain 
Delight turns to sorrow 
Without a reason why 
And how about tomorrow 
Will the new sun rise? 

Now the tears fall again 
Anguished thoughts prevail 
My heart and my soul 
Remain forever cold
