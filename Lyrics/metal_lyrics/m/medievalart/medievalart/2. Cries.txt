[1] Agony and suffering, the contents of this life 
What is left of my believes? The answers I can't find 
No release from the heavens, to the moaning from below 
All I had is taken away, despair begins to show 

All my cries remain unheard 

[2] Every time I try to scream, no one seem to hear 
Reality's a strange dream, it's turning into fear 
Nothing more inside of me - but this draining sorrow 
Is there a reason to believe in a new tomorrow? 

All my cries remain unheard
