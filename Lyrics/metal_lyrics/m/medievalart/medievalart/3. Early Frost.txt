I am born and I've grown in the wind 
In the frost, in the draught 
When we arrived to these barren plains 
We felt early cold 

[1] Autumn... the leaves fall down again, to this gloomy earth 
I beg You, cool rain... Clean my thoughts 

[2] Inside of my mind I'm full of pain, like this air 
Misty thoughts, I tell you that: Go away... Far from here 

I am born and I've grown in the wind 
In the frost, in the draught 
When we arrived to these barren plains 
We felt early cold 

[3] Autumn goes on and on again, I weep 
I beg You, cool rain... Clean my thoughts
