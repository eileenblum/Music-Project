[1] You've been constructing your lives on the stars 
The stars that gleam above us, idols of mankind 
The stars rule your lives, the stars rule your mind 
Your own lives go down the drain 

And I tell you...Stare! The stars fall down 

[2] The stars are not gods, the stars are not immortal 
When the stars die, take care you won't fall with them 
Build your own lives, before it's too late 
There could be so much in your lives 

And I tell you...Stare! The stars fall down 

3.They've been constructing their lives on the stars 
The stars that gleam above us, idols of mankind 
The stars ruled their lives, the stars ruled their mind 
Their own lives went down the drain 

I tell you...Stare! The stars fall down
