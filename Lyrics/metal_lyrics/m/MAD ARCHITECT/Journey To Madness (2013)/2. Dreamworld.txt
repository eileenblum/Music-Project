[Music &amp; Lyrics: M Daun]

[Verse 1:]
Believing we are the crown of creation,
WeÂ´re driven by unattainable goals.
A never ending desire for sensation,
in return weÂ´re selling our souls.

[Pre-chorus:]
At once so foolish, all so wicked and insane.
Draining our lifeblood till nothing remain.
As if a Being, God or Fiend, could reign?
(Mark my words), this is the beginning of the end.

[Chorus 1:]
Living in a dreamworld,
Where nothing is for real.
Life is just illusion,
When youÂ´re living in your dream.

[Verse 2:]
The ultimate institution of greed,
With an insatiable hunger for power.
We calmly ask them to please proceed,
Allowing us to be devoured.

[Pre-chorus:]
ArenÂ´t they all the same, just want to fill your head.
With promises you will be rewarded when youÂ´re dead!
As if a Being, God or Fiend, could reign?
(WeÂ´re closing in), to the beginning of the end.

[Chorus 2:]
Living in a dreamworld,
Where nothing is for real.
Life is just illusion,
When youÂ´re living in a dream.

[Solo]

[Verse 3:]
Believing we are the crown of creation,
WeÂ´re driven by unattainable goals.
A never ending desire for sensation,
In return we are selling our souls.

[Pre-chorus:]
At once so foolish, all so wicked and insane.
Draining our lifeblood till nothing remain.
As if a Being, God or Fiend, could reign?
(Finally, now), this is the beginning of the end.

[Chorus 3:]
Living in a dreamworld,
Where nothing is for real.
Life is just illusion,
When youÂ´re living in a dream.

Living in a dreamworld,
Where nothing is for real.
Life is just illusion,
When youÂ´re living in a dream.
