[CD Bonus Track][Music &amp; Lyrics: M Daun]

[Verse 1:]
Far from the borders of sanity,
Mountains of madness,
Even the blind can see.

Another world, another universe,
No sign of blessing,
No sign of curse.

[Chorus 1:]
Get ready to go â NOW
Get ready to fly â HIGH

Old patterns fade away,
Structures fall.

Are you ready to go â NOW
Are you ready to fly â HIGH

In an altered state,
You speed through time and space.

[Post-chorus 2:]
Never too late for an open mind,
A chilling glow running through your spine.
Magic dimension, a parallell membrane,
Ruled by no one, demon or saint.

[Whispers 1:]
Far from the borders of sanity,
Mountains of madness,
Even the blind can see.

Another world, another universe,
No sign of blessing,
No sign of curse.

[Verse 2:]
Never too late for an open mind,
A chilling glow running through your spine.

Magic dimension, a parallell membrane,
Ruled by no one, demon or saint.

[Chorus 2:]
Get ready to go â NOW
Get ready to fly â HIGH

Old patterns fade away,
Structures fall.

Are you ready to go â NOW
Are you ready to fly â HIGH

An altered state,
A different frame of mind.

[Post-chorus 2:]
Far from the borders of sanity,
Mountains of madness,
Even the blind can see.
Another world, another universe,
No sign of blessing,
No sign of curse.

[Whispers 2:]
Never too late for an open mind,
A chilling glow running through your spine.

Magic dimension, a parallell membrane,
Ruled by no one, demon or saint.
