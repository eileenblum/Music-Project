[Music &amp; Lyrics: M Daun]

[Verse 1:]
Never saw it coming,
Waking you up from the deepest sleep,
A brutal nightmare,
Fast becoming reality.

Feeding (from your brain),
Thriving (from your pain).

[Verse 2:]
Brought back to life,
Mind unwilling to accept.
Cursed are the nations,
The gates have now been opened wide.

Marauding (for their own gain),
Slaughtering (blood will rain).

[Chorus 1:]
Strange Machine â created by mad inventors,
Main purpose to be grinding you down.

Strange Machine â created by mad inventors,
Main purpose to be grinding you down.

[Verse 3:]
Chain of events,
Throwing all your hopes into,
Eternal darkness,
Too late now for switching down...

The machine (thatÂ´s grinding you down),
ItÂ´s wheels (goes round and round).

[Chorus 2:]
Strange Machine â created by mad inventors,
Main purpose to be grinding you down.
Strange Machine â efficient butchery of willing victims,
Spinning wheels lubricated by their blood.

Ripping and tearing the flesh from your bone.
(Like) voracious carnivores â feasting on their prey.
Crushing the bones, sucking out the marrow,
Not satisfied until thereÂ´s nothing left to bleed.

[Solo]

[Verse 4:]
Never saw it coming,
Waking you up from the deepest sleep,
Without a conscience,
Systematically exploiting.

Feeding (from your brain),
Thriving (from your pain).

[Chorus 3:]
Strange Machine â created by mad inventors,
Main purpose to be grinding you down.
Strange Machine â efficient butchery of willing victims,
Spinning wheels lubricated by their blood.

Ripping and tearing the flesh from your bone.
(Voracious carnivores â feasting on their prey.)
Crushing the bones, sucking out the marrow.

Ripping and tearing the flesh from your bone.
(Voracious carnivores â feasting on their blood.)
Crushing the bones, sucking out the marrow.
