[Music: DaunÂ  Lyrics: Shaw]

Spiral tower - neatly twined
Architect - unique in kind
Objects of a twisted mind
What's been lost and what's been found, mental state of..
Built of dreams on sacred ground, mass destruction
Â 
Brick by brick and Stone by stone
Left a tomb that's marked "unknown"
What's been lost and what's been found, mental state of...
Â 
Mad, it's the Mad Architect
His purpose is genuine but not so pure
Mad, the Mad Architect
His actions are justified by a higher goal, goal, goal

Futuristic in design,
Seldom seen such evil mind
Of this master so divine
In the name of liberty, reads slavery
Grandeur for the world to see
But not for you and me!
Â 
Ha! See he laughs at your suffering - as he pisses on your graves
What's been lost and what's been found, mental state of...
Â 
Mad, it's the Mad Architect
His purpose is genuine but not so pure
Mad, the Mad Architect
His actions are justified by a goal so much higher, higher, higher
Than life itself!

Severed assumption, written in blood
Fearing that something wicked will now happen.
Severed by numbers, seven to one
Live in temptation with no fear or weapon
Civil construction - will happen

Past and present - light and shade
This damn tower of man made
That's a fact on both accounts
Built with blood on sacred ground
Side by side by side by side,
Side by side by side by side...
