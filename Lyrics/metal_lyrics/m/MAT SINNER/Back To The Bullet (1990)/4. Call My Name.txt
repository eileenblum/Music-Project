[Sinner, Naumann]

It feels so cold inside to wake up without you
The third morning, we go separate ways
I go to places where we used to go
I pay the price of loving you

I've lost enough sleep over you now
I don't care anymore
I don't care

But if you call my name
You know I'll be there
If you call my name
I'll be there
If you're standing in the shadow
Or standing in the rain
I'll be there, call my name

I'm sitting here alone now
The empty glass and me
I remember the times, we shared together
Screamin' out the rage about
The love we threw away
But your chance will never come again

Soon all the tears will be dried from my face
I'm not gonna crawl again
A broken heart don't mend
