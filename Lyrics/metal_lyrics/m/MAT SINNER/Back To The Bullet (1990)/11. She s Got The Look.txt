[Sinner / Sinner, Geiger]
[bonus track]

I'm out with the boys on the tough side of town
The street's on fire and my feet don't touch the ground

Here comes trouble, a high heeled sight
The party command on this Saturday night

Sometimes it's so easy
On a night like this
I'm runnin' out of control

She's got the look - and I can get her
She's got the look
She's got the look - and I can get her
She's got the look - she's hot

She takes me where the wild ones go
But she doesn't give in, she's playing on

Passion takes it over, I'm down on my knees
She can lock me up and throw away the key

Like a fuel to fire
Yes I need her bad
She makes me change all my plans
