[Sinner]

I see your face, smiling from a picture
I remember you, so many tears have fallen down

How long did I try to forget you
I throw away my pride, but the fire's still there

We hide our love and we'll find a way
But I don't need another heartbreak

Tear down the wall [2]
Tear down the wall and answer me
Tear down the wall [2]
Between us

Enough is enough, you took it too far
And I'd really sold my soul for you

How long 'til you wake up your mind
I can't wait any longer

If you're strong enough
Just call my name
But I don't need another heartbreak

Are you strong enough
Then call my name
But I don't need another heartbreak
