[Sinner / Sinner, Geiger]

Little snow white hang tough
You can dream a little longer
When you walk the high-wire
Hold on much stronger

What's a nice girl like you
Doin' in this wild world
Playing for keeps, you're going

Overdose, overdose - you set the wheel in motion
Overdose, overdose - now watch it turn around
Overdose, overdose - reason lies dying
Overdose, overdose

You might wind up alone
Do you think you're in control
But the wounds keep on spreading
Until they reach your soul

I can hear the door slam
Sounding like thunder
Of a sacrificial rite, you're going

Overdose, overdose - you set the wheel in motion
Overdose, overdose - now watch it turn around
Overdose, overdose - reason lies dying
Overdose, overdose - I hear you crying in the wires
Crying in the wires

Your life lies naked in the hands of fate
Your memories add up to nothing
