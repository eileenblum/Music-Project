[Sinner, Beyrodt / Sinner]

Here I'm standing alone at midnight
They told me again that tough guys don't cry
Face to face with a devil called love

You see me waiting in the shadows
And one step to you seems to be one million miles
And you're so far away

I'm walking on ice, no safety in sight

Let us play the secret game
Let us leave the chosen ways
Walk on water face to face
This is more than meets the eye
We can make it if we try
Stay together

Uh, I can't sleep at night
I can't think it over again
There's no easy way out

You better throw off these chains
That keep holding you back
