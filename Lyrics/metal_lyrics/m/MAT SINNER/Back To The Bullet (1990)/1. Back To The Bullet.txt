[Sinner, Beyrodt / Sinner, Geiger]

You better listen closely now
I'm a man with a mission and I'm back in town
If it's all a waste of time
I'm only wastin' mine

Here I come a head full of dreams
A need so strong to swim upstream
No boundaries
Could ever hold me here

I'm under fire - I'm gettin' ready

Let's get
Back to the bullet - follow the fighting choice
Back to the bullet - takin' another shot

A one way ticket to the hall of fame
So there's gonna be some changes made
I feel the rhythm of a thousand pounding drums

Little by little, I'll even the score
I'm not gonna play second best anymore
Got a bad attitude
And I'm playin' rude

Too many rules spoilt my plans
