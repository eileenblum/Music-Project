[Sinner / Sinner, Geiger]

Easy come and easy go
You see me walkin' on ice
I couldn't take any more advice
It's time to step into the light

I got my outlook of life
There's no turning back
The fire's still alright

Down undercover - will music ever rescue me
Down undercover - when my blood runs to the beat
Down undercover - when the thrill has got me again
Down undercover - rescue me

Hard as rock like dynamite
And I'm about to explode (I'm burning up)
I'm out to win this long lost fight
It's got me screaming for more

I forget all the trouble
It's like the call of the wild
And the passion still burns
