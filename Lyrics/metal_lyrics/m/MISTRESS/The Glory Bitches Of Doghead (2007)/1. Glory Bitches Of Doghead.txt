Can you hear them howling?
Crying havoc, let slip the leash
By spears of longinus bled
The glory bitches of doghead

Havoc

Unleash the hounds, bloody hungry eyes burn in the black
The stench of sick as God lies befouled on wretched sack

Oh sickle God, oh beasts berserk
This is Christ's work

All the buzzing flies, midst the twisted nails
The bone and skin
Round the serpent pit the rats are screaming
Slick with sin

Oh sickle God, oh beasts berserk
This is Christ's work

Can you hear them howling?
Of the church of filth and the beheaded cross
Such holy curse on hell's bile fed
The glory bitches of doghead

Unleash the hounds, baying madness from the carrion floor
Go bitches forth, avenge the murdered, sainted whore

Oh sickle God, oh beasts berserk
This is Christ's work

Can you hear them howling?
Beaten, kicked, maimed, drugged
Your wretched king from hell cunt born
Now seraph choir howl judgement's dawn

Oh sickle God, oh beasts berserk
This is Christ's work

Can you hear them howling?
Of luckless bastards and child saints
Glory lies in the spilling of blood
Kill for your king, die for your God
