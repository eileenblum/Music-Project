Give strong drink to the one who is perishing
And wine to those in bitter distress

Let them drink and forget their poverty
And remember their misery ever more

Such big dreams, you could almost feel them dying
The look on your face said the sky was crashing down

Drown it

Your day will never come
All that is left is the tears of an old man
