Disaster
No free time for suicide
What'd you see when you closed your eyes?
Too many dirty secrets

What shit stained carrot are you hiding
In your desperately mute past?
A filthy little bundle and a trip to a bridge
Did the child sink or swim?

What'd you want, a love song?
This is for those who've lost their will
Tears on your cheeks and shit on your lips
Come on, come on, come on go through with it!

So kill yourself
But don't think that it has meaning
Just kill yourself
Get it over and done

So many disorders, so little time
A shopping list for the self obsessed
But to get results, it takes guts

So kill yourself
But don't act like it has meaning
Just kill yourself
Get it over and done

Why wait anymore?
The world's all gone wrong
Fucking show us your guts

So kill yourself
But don't act like it has meaning
Just kill yourself
Get it over and done

It's just so damn easy
Think of all the attention your corpse will get
People will only notice you once you're gone

Just lay your head down

[Note: This is a song about an idea, it's not an actual request for anyone to kill themselves. If you're genuinely likely to commit suicide, don't act on song lyrics written by depressed weirdos. Go and get help.]
