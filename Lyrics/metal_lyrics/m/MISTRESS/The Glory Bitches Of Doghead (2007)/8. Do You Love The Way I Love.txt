It's here
You've been asking for it for long enough
I made this picture for you
It's made up of photographs I took
You're so pretty, just look at your eyes
I was sent to watch over
Look at these pictures
These are the ones I took
While you were sleeping

The times I've seen you smile across the room
We always knew they were really for us
We just couldn't admit it in front of everyone
I understand
But now we can stop pretending

I know it must come as a big relief
You knew it was me who sent you those presents
It was difficult the way I am and all
But I hope you liked them
Some of them were so very hard to catch
Stop fucking crying!

The times I've seen you smile across the room
We always knew they were really for us
We just couldn't admit it in front of everyone
I understand
But now we can stop pretending
