Manipulating cynically
Stay the fucking fuck away from me
So proud, wearing that badge of honour
Mindless, brainless, soulless fucking cancer

Petty vanity
Accomplish nothing
Become less human
Oh so damn efficient

Grotesque and childish
Not even human
Answer the question
Do you know who you are?

You're why we drink so much
You're why we couldn't care less
Sink lower than everyone else
To rise above

A rootless tree but still ascent
Cannot break nor ever bend
Contempt for the fellow man
Stay the goddamn fuck away from me

Petty vanity
Accomplish nothing
Become less human
Oh so damn efficient

Grotesque and childish
Not even human
Answer the question
Do you know who you are?

You're why we drink so much
You're why we couldn't care less
Sink lower than everyone else
To rise above
