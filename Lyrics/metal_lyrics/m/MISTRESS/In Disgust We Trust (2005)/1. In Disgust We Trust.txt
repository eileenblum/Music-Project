Rutting like a fucking beast
Leave the rest fucked over and deceased
So immersive, the darkness skin and sweat
Cause everyone deserves just what they get

Can see it light up like candles in their eyes
Believe fucking me it's no surprise
Well gee, ain't everything so fucking swell
Shut your mouth, don't you dare tell

Sometimes it is the only way
To say the things you know you shouldn't say
When words have crumbled into dust
Fuck them all, in disgust we trust

It's like throwing pearls before the swine
But then those pears ain't exactly diving
Screaming noise in my head and I can see you naked
Now let's hear you squeal like a stuck pig

Sometimes it is the only way
To say the things you know you shouldn't say
When words have crumbled into dust
Fuck them all, in disgust we trust
In disgust we trust

Close your eyes and sink into the disease
It never helps however much we plead
The answer is pulsing in your blood
Fuck them all, in disgust we trust
In disgust we trust
