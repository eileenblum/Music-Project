Static
A brain full of static and screaming chaos
A life standing still in the rain
Still praying for the payoff

You're right, you're so fucking right
But still you just don't quite fit
You're good, you're so fucking good
We really hope you enjoy it
When you're left to eat shit

Live by the law
Die by the law
Fuck the law
D'you even know what her name was?

Play by the rules
Bend the rules
Fuck the rules
Don't understand what they stand for

Always the surrogate, never the prize
There was never a reason but always a rhyme
Voices always speaking but nothing ever being said
Listen out for bed springs creaking
Nails in the coffin of hope so fleeting
Just a matter of time till you're out
Out of control and out of your fucking head

Live by the law
Die by the law
Fuck the law
D'you even know what her name was?

Play by the rules
Bend the rules
Fuck the rules
Don't understand what they stand for

Wasn't it all
A great big waste
Weren't we all
So young and in so much haste
I know you were
Just taking to time to be yourself
But living in fool's heaven
You've sent another fool to hell

Live by the law
Die by the law
Fuck the law
D'you even know what her name was?

Play by the rules
Bend the rules
Fuck the rules
Don't understand what they stand for
