So here we are, this old familiar stench
This place is terrible and it's time to cause offense

Concatenated, the same series of events
With dripping jaws, the war of feigned love's injusticed
With shattered nerves, please break
I make me so fucking sick
So let's do it all again

And watch as she sucks dick

Come dance with me
But keep me at arm's length

Such strain's repetitive
But no more unite and conquer
So many bonds untied
I'm stepping out alone

To fight the same old war but it's different from the last
Red hands and a leaden sky, but I can't forget the past
So bring it on you fucking dicks come kick us in the teeth
We're already broken, what more could you achieve?

Make sure you keep me at arm's fucking length
