Incapable, player in a cast of millions
Fuck it up, guts burning yet again
Live on adrenaline and fear of defeat
Fear the cunt who takes the prize

Sweet nausea, knowingly expectant
Fucking laugh you fucking joke

Disjointed and obscure

Don't spill the beans, just fucking watch

Just imagine the shining wall
Can't take it, just want to be sick
Take another drink and smile
In front of the face
And pray for 38

Lay yourself down, son, and watch the gathering crows
