Caffeine, burned skin, vinegar, bastard benzos
Malicious, wastrel politics, scabs for eyes
Usury, dislocation, self abuse with pride

Mutual disrespect, hate thy neighbour as thyself
A floorboard investment, fraudulent use of credentials

I've always wondered how you'd look
In your wedding dress
All light, crowned with stars, all the best things are fragile
Guess I'll never know

Anger mismanagement, a course of medication
So what if you're borderline, be the best meat you can

Think this was a one way trip
