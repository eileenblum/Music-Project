An animal distraction
Murdered children have more choice
While you're skull fucking the eunuch
A world from hated sex divorced

And have no memory

Suck the cock of forced attrition
Swallow Satan's burning chyme

And have no memory

So with burning, piss teared eye's
Open wide, inhale the flames
Just drink away the regrets

Have no memory
A-fucking-gain

Withered lunatic
In Jack Daniels' halo
Confused and violent
Abuse once and throw away

And so now, you're coming fucking back again
Just drain all you need and walk away
I won't remember anyway
