Don't fucking say it, you piss soaked maggot
Maintain your distance, don't speak
Don't explain, don't engage, don't justify
Just drink and forget

Don't try to share, don't want to hear it
Take a step back you cunt
Just drink your acid, keep your mouth shut
Stare at the mirror and cry

Don't tell me you're sorry, there's no fucking point
Nobody cares what you've done

Eulogise pain - we don't want to know
Nobody cares you're alone

So cry your heart out, conceited shit
Bite the pillow and think of your home
Choke your tears back, you snivelling prick
Need someone to understand
Well you're on your fucking own
