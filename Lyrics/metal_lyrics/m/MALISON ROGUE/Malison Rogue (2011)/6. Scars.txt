The cut makes the demons go
Out of my mind at least for a while
One thing I can say for sure
Is that they will come back to
Mess with my head

Have reached a point to make a change
Cannot live like this no longer
Have to break this downward spiral
Need someone more than ever

The voices inside
Return again
I cannot hide from myself anymore

When will I feel again
Scars of body and mind
Time has caught up with me
Anxiety grows within my weakness

Feel alone in this world
Those I trust just turn away
Caught inside a downward spiral
Need you now more than ever

The voices inside
Return again

I cannot hide from myself anymore
Get out of my head
And please stay away
I cannot hide from myself anymore

When will I feel again
Scars of body and mind
Time has caught up with me
Anxiety grows within my weakness

Take a look at my arms
They are scarred and forever marked
Take a look in my eyes
There is pain you've never felt

The cut makes the demons go
But they will come back to
Mess with my head
I know that the blade is no salvation
I fall back again and again

When will I feel again
Scars of body and mind
Time has caught up with me
Anxiety grows within my weakness
