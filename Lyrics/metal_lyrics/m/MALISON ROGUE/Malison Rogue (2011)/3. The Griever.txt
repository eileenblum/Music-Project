Your sleep has just begun
And now you are free from the pain
That bothered you for so long

How I've feared for this day to finally come
Just want to turn back time and see you once again

All that you have left behind is grief and inscriptions on a stone
When l'rn alone I see your face it's haunting me

Can't imagine what you went through
The disease spread in your veins
Made you weaker day by day

Time heals nothing, it doesn't change a thing
Still the tears in my eyes and the ache in my heart remain

All that you have left behind is grief and inscriptions on a stone
When I'm alone I see your face it's haunting me

Life isn't fair, life is just cruel, it tore us apart

Just to think of you feeds my grief
Tell me why did this happen, why did it end this way?

All that you have left behind is grief and inscriptions on a stone
When l'm alone I see your face it's haunting me
You visit me at night, I see you in my dreams
I ask myself why did this happen to you

Life isn't fair, life is just cruel, it tore us apart
