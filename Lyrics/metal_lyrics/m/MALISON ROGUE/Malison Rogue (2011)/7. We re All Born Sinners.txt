You claim that you are pure
That you are a messenger
A voice of God
Talk about deadly sins
But who are you to judge me
When you're not true to your Lord

You liar

Your obnoxious mind
Has polluted our world
For far too long

I may never reach your heaven
Never find your way
We are all born as sinners
I may never reach your heaven
Never find your way
Practice what you preach
Live by your own word

You gave in to your lust
A sick urge, a perverse crime
An act of hate
Talk about deadly sins
But who are you to judge me
When you're not true to your Lord

Your obnoxius mind
Has polluted our world
For far too long

I may never reach your heaven
Never find your way
We are all born as sinners
I may never reach your heaven
Never find your way
Practice what you preach
Live by your own word
