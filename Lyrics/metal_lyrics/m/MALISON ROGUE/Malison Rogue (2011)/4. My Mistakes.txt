For the times I've let you down
For all the promises I've broken
For the times I've made you cry
Need a change in rny behaviour
To be a better man for you

Forgive me for my mistakes I tell you
I will learn from my mistakes
And you should know I want this to last
Through good times and through bad

Though it cuts me like a knife
I can see our bridges burning

Forgive me for my mistakes I tell you
I will learn from my mistakes
And you should know I want this to last
Through good times and through bad

When I close my eyes, you're there
You're the dream I always dream
You're the air that I breathe, it's true

For the times I've made you cry
Need a change in rny behaviour
To be a better man for you

Forgive me for my mistakes I tell you
I will learn from my mistakes
And you should know I want this to last
Through good times and through bad

Won't let you down again
