I see through your lies
See behind the mask that you wear
I refuse to be
A puppet on your strings

Mark my words revenge is sweet
This time you have crossed the line

Not able to see the pain you cause
Not able to feel empathy or remorse
Eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth
My vengeance will strike down upon you

Manipulate the crowd
You won't fool me again
I have had enough
Of your empty promises

Spread your lies round like plague
This time you have crossed the line

Not able, to see the pain you cause
Not able to feel empathy or remorse
Eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth
My vengeance will strike down upon you
