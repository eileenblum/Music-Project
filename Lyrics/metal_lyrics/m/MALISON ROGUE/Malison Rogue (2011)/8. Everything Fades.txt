Wake up lonely
As last night and many nights before
Since you've been gone

I remember the time
I first laid my eyes on you
Feels like ages ago
But it was true love at first sight

We realized
It could not last forever

Everything fades
Day turns to night
And colours turn black
Nothing at all
Seems to be
The way it was

Why did our love
Fade like a candle's flame
So quickly burned out

Not myself anymore
I fall deeper down each day
A decision was made
But I regret it more and more

We realized
It could not last forever

Everything fades
Day turns to night
And colours turn black
Nothing at all
Seems to be
The way it was

In the absence of your love
I wake up every night
Cold sweat is running down my back
You left a memory in my heart
In the absence of your touch
Staring at our empty bed
Better move on with our lives
Your words are screaming in my head
