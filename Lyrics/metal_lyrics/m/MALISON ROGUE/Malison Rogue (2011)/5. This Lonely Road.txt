With every breath
Every heartbeat I yearn
For something more
To break free from this apathy
Waiting for a sign

Somewhere along this lonely road
I lost track of myself
These past ten years where did they go?
This town is drowning me

There's so much I want to say
Things I want to tell you
But I watch from afar

Waiting for a sign
Longing for someone to be in my arms
Am I forever alone?

This time I've made up my mind
It's time for a change...

Is this what I've been dreaming of?
This person I've become
Will I achieve something in life
This town drags me down

There's so much I want to say
Things I want to tell you
But I watch from afar

Waiting for a sign
Longing for someone to be in my arms
Am I forever alone?
