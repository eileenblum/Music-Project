Once again you're standing there
A shadow of my past
Long time gone
But what do you crave from me?

You sense my fear
I know that you can read me
Like an open book
A chapter ends in pain

You're the uninvited guest
In my life right now

A friend or foe
What's your intention
With me this time
A friend or foe

Why are you back? As always
You will leave me with an open wound
A bleeding heart, a shattered soul

You're the serpent in disguise
An angel dressed in black
You're the uninvited guest
In my life right now

A friend or foe, what is your intention
With me this time, this game we play
A deadly hide and seek
Friend or foe...
