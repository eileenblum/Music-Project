From the dust of the past
To the ashes of this day
Lackluster existence
Persistent, but restrained

It's humbling to realize
That slowly each day we're
Ground to the dust of the past
Erased

Hatred in the Eyes of the Fallen
Victims of their insane rules, left disconnected
Barren, empty soul in the Eyes of the Fallen
Bitter for a life unlived, the Eyes of the Fallen

Remorse for something undone
Serves only a fool
Confusing contentment and passion
Confines the room to improve

When there is nothing left to attain
Is there a reason to be?
A reason to dwell in the past
Erased

Hatred in their eyes
Victims of their insane lives
