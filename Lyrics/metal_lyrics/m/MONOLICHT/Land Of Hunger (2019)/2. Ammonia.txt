Perverted version in the favor of the sage
Capital punishment for those who advocate
The preservation of their archaic rites
The sage worse than the lie that he buys

Insane
Tidal destruction of the mind
We're blind

Ammonia
Wash away all life

Persecution the cleansing of the blessed
Zero tolerance which they'll incredibly learn
The road to power is paved sheer death
Hypocrisy, casualties and none of regret

Deranged
Tidal destruction of the mind
We're blind

Ammonia
Wash away all life
If we'd see beyond illusions of dominion
We would know
In the furnace of psychosis we burn
And burn
