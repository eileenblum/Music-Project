Into years of torture
When they plucked out our eyes
Crawled through the ages
Killed us hundreds of times

Why can't I rest in this haze?
It's too uneasy and strange

In those times of torture
When they fed us their lies
Devastated our stronghold
Impaled our daughters and wives

Still can't rest in this haze
It's too uneasy and strange

Hunt us down this is a war
Hunt us down, kill us all
Nail our children on the walls
Make sure we're extinct

If there just one soul to flare
Hidden in the woods somewhere
You have to get him then and there
Or once more we rise

Hunt me down before I'm gone
Make sure my blood is left unborn
Spill my blood upon the wall
Make sure I'm extinct

If my soul is left to flare
I'll bring my people back in there
My people will be everywhere
You'll see me rise
