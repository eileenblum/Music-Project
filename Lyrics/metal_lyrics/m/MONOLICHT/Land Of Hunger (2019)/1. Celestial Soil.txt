The land of hunger...

Heath of leaves - dark minded soldiers
At the ruins of the keep their thoughts of enormity
Are foiled by the dust - time stands still
As the crows obscure groves of pine

Frozen empire
Celestial soil
Where the waters run deep
Where the nameless toil

The land of hunger
Where the weary roam
Frozen empire
Celestial soil

Spreading their seed throughout the paths of grass
In the carnival of darkness, the eclipsing attack
Inherently enslaved to roam the forests of evil
Punished to obedience - brutalized

The terminal embrace of frost
Strips the trees of their flesh

Frozen empire
Celestial soil
Where the waters run deep
Where the nameless toil

The land of hunger
Where the weary roam
Frozen empire
Celestial soil

Is it a trap or is it a frozen heaven?
Occult wasteland - wasted youth
