Ancient journey through space and time
Worthless flounder, disgusting and vile
Utter disturbance on life's eternal premise
Mutated beyond natural law

Smearing feces all over the world
Broken pieces, lifeâs leases, diseases
Crawling bastards like sperm in a whore
Abandoned by natural order

Human disgrace
Seeking reverence
Never to be found

Kneel before the obelisk of gold
Seek lost wisdom of scholars so old
The power of Satan compels you

Heed the call of the ravens song
Your time till death will not be long
The power of Satan compels you

Evolutionary mystery ways
Taught the human the planetary states
Arrested development of the skies
Brought god into human minds

The cleansing sword is an inverted cross
Mutilation of nature's laws
Religious prominence breeds sin after sin
As we forget the Sathanas within

Human in vein
Seeking reverence
Undeserved

Kneel before the obelisk of gold
Seek lost wisdom of scholars so old
The power of Satan compels you

Heed the call of the ravens song
Your time till death will not be long
The power of Satan compels you
Destruction of the obelisk of gold
Forgotten wisdom of scholars so old
The power of Christ corrodes you

No more voice in the ravens song
Filthy humans, we do not belong
The power of human is undue
