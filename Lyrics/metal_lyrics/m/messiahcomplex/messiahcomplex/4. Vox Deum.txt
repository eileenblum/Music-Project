Reach out
We are cold, we are the darkness
Unite as one and go forth
They beat us to the ground, but like the dust, we will rise

And in all the confusion
You slip back into patterns,
And I play the strings once more

No one to break your fall, hanging by the threads of life, it is time

There is no light, no mercy, just a void, and the chaos within
Forsake the voice of reason and you will find the hard way out

Vox Deum

Reach out
We are cold, we are the darkness
Unite as one and go forth
They beat us to the ground, but like the dust, we will rise

The day has come, begin the march
Today death gets the short end of the stick

Pretentious smiles wiped clean like a slate
Itâs time you were brought to your fucking knees
