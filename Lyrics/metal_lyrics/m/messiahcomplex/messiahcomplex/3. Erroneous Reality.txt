The moving pictures beneath her eyelids send her heart racing
The scent of fear is here, nightmares meet reality

She traded in her books for a short red dress, such a shame
She lies awake in the dark of night, no one to hear her scream
Little did she know the girl in the reflection wanting nothing more than to bring her pain
Though she tries with all her might her thoughts will not give up this fight

Left with nothing but her own shame and tears of regret
She will never, never know, so clueless, gullible

Hollow, wasted, worthless, fucking hopeless
Hollow, wasted, worthless, fucking hopeless

Sheâs left with nothing but her own shame and tears of regret
She will never know, so clueless, gullible

She sleepwalks through this erroneous reality
Stepping on all the wrong fingers, her time is up

These darkened days will haunt her forever, all she wanted was to be someone

A tear runs down her blackened cheek
Reality hits like a fucking truck

She wakens beneath the city lights, colder than ever, sheâs given another chance

Sheâs left with nothing but her own shame and tears of regret
She will never know, so clueless, gullible
Sheâs left with nothing but her own shame and tears of regret
She will never know, so clueless, gullible
