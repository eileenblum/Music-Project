The cattle drop, as he walks the fields with strides of despair
The saints perdition, go forth fitness the epiphany of the fallen race

Masquerading Judas walks among them, masked in obscurity
All hope is gone
All hope is gone
All hope is gone

So sit back and watch the cities burn to the fucking ground

Rise up listen to their cries, the cries of the weak
The dead adorned by searing skies, a night never to be forgotten

Forget my face

Fuck
Iâm gonna eat you like the plague
Like the fucking plague

Contradictory lives, the pieces fall in place
Written in blood the prolonged gehenna

Waiting in fear, the reaper kisses the pitied fool goodnight for the last time

We are legion for we are many
We are legion for we are many

Now
Right now
Right now
