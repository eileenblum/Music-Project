Blood and tears this is the start of the end
Contorted and broken we pick ourselves up
There is no turning back the hands
Donât look back now

We take another look at ourselves,
The monster under our bed now lives within
Lips that would kiss form prayers of a broken man
Now speak

You have much to lose,
You dream of death and the darkness that slowly feeds on you
You cling to life like it has meaning, the truth is yet to be revealed
Look around you, deceit and betrayal is all that awaits you
There is only one solution. You must give in

The ignorant will suffer
They bite the hand that feeds,
Oh ignorance is bliss
So close to the edge
Not wasting anytime
Lined up in single file to get knocked down
Blind, the road never ends, lift your heads, see
They sing a symphony of sin, there is another out

Carving your way through the darkness and whispers,
Shape without form, questions without answers
Take to the stage
Rise above it all
This is a dead land,
Rescued by a hollow hand

I dare not meet their eyes in this world or the next
Asking forgiveness rather than permission we take this world one day at a time
Now step up or step the fuck out
This is a reckoning
We are the living dead,
We are dead
