On and on the sun is dreaming waves to disguise
Endless night behind is waiting
The hand to close your eyes
Hear the hammer fall and the flame speak
The path is found the scale is set and the gods are dead
Stretching out your mind across space and time
You struggle to remember what has passed away
That which does not kill us makes us stronger
One must still have chaos in oneself
Release the fallen star
