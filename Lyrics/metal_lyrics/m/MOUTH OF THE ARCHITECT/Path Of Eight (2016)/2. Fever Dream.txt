A life of lies, a life of hate, a life of love
Regrets  life of made
Your life fades away
When we ride the white
Will chase you down 
The wall of unreality you 
To save no one from the 
A everywhere you go in your own home
You can feel yourself break through the 
Spiraling collapsing down
Therap suicide blood too 
Human minds better hell than your devils could devise
