Your hands are not your hands
Your mind is not your mind
Faster and faster you fall
Your voice is only light
Your heart is born of fire
Your soul is torn apart
Giants carry us into orbit with the sun
We sing for your return
The scale is weighed
Devour your fears the path is set
Your hands are not your hands
