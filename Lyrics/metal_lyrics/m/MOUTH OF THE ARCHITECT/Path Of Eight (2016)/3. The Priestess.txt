You stand before the great red horizon
With a spinning dark mess ever at your black
Of there is nothing left to fear
The past is behind you now your path will soon be clear
Three moons align with the sun
And the mountains fall
A of death beckons you will you heed its call
I present you this choice the hourglass is set
One hand bathed in blood the other wrapped in fire
