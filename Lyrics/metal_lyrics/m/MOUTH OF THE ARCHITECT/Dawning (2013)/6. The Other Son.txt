As brothers we fought, held down against our will.
As fathers we fought, but learned nothing more.
As loversâ¦ we lost our faith.
I tore down this wall around my heart,
We played with fire.
We risked it all.
But luck and love have gone to the other son.
Let it all fall down upon the other son.
Our bones we left in the soil.
As brother we lostâ¦
As fathers we lostâ¦
As lovers we lostâ¦ all hope.
