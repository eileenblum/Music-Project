Don't waste your breath...
We know how this will end. 
You can feel it moving against the wind.
Waiting for it to come crashing down on me.
Then we will lose ourselves in this.
Feeling the flesh back from our wounds.
Drowning in our own skin.
All that was buried within.
No hope for salvation.
What are you to me?
My fists are broken and bruised,
Trying to remove the poison from inside of me. 
Bury my body deep into the ground,
Bury my strength with the love I leave behind.
You are not ready for what's coming.
Your voices are silent beneath the static.
