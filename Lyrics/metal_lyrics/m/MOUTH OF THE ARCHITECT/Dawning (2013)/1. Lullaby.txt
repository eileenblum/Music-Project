Our story will readâ¦
The great darkness prevailed.
For we are doomed to taking love by force.
It tastes like stale sweat,
shatter hopes, and broken bones.
Time has done us in.
Enough is enoughâ¦
I canât recall those tears we cried,
As we read that lullabye.
We will read this lullabye.
And sleep that long goodnight.
