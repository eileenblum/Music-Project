It swarms around me like wildfire.
It waits beyond meaning.
This hoard of hate and teeth.
You canât see the hand that hold you.
Silent and still.
Youâll never find a way to escape yourself.
It swarms around me like wildfire.
Letting go of everything.
Our skin will fall away but the spark will remain.
A slave to it
And the world moves on.
Never to receiveâ¦ Never to return
A slave to it all.
And the world moves on.
