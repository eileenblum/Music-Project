I should have turned to you and said
"It's alright, darling someday you'll forget me"
And your eyes would have welled up with tears
I would have as well
So these days, a wandering mind holds sway
And hope is enough
Sing with me
Sing with me
Will you cry out for me in your sleep
Wasting what precious little time *we have had*
Like a dead man trying to find life
Against a bright moon, dark sky and city lights
Like dead man trying to find life
Against a bright moon, dark sky and city lights
The colour of her eyes
The taste of her flesh
I feel again
Quietly leave me
Quietly leave me
Again Again
