Days left of fall, the dimming light falls
Our fighting soldiers home to rest.
And shadows watching out,
To wage a raging war.
A victory for all I see.
Ashes crowd the air, as silence scars the air.
A history of dreams collide.

You can see it on their faces,
Smell it on their lips,
A generation of ghosts,
Lost and weak.
Fade away.
What little of love left within me,
Has been bled dry... and buried.

Ashes crowd the air, as silence scars the air.
A history of dreams collide.
A fallen friend then speaks,
A wasted round of dreams,
A history of dreams collide.

I will sing with the end of all things.
