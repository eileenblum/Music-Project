Your hands lay like stones
If you try to lift them
You drop them on your face
This is the moment things change
The moment things would never be the same
So you... you crawl and... upward
If you were here now, I'd cut you open
Because I don't want to feel anymore
I want it all to burn?
This guilt is all-seeing
Killing anyone
To the star?
We all ...
Until the end
