Wait until the violence beneath comes forth.
Will anyone still blindly grasp for love?
Pointing fingers towards the fire.
Will anyone still blindly grasp for life?
What has begun will never be destroyed.
We will fall from light and thought.
Burn.
The wind is thick with fear.
Will anyone... gasp for breath?
When it begins it will bleed through me,
Raising the flag of our return to ash.
Your rage has exposed your weakness.
Now is the time to be aware.
We will all burn.
Swelling to something foreign, something dark.
The sun lights the way to our demise.
I open my arms to it.
I open my eyes.
