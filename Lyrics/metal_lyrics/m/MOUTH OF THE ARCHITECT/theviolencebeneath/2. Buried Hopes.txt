Buried hopes one day will rise,
Remind our hearts of what could've been.
The sun will rise again.
The sun goes down as days do pass,
I won't forget.
A new day will come.
You will be broken.
And victims, they may die along the path.
A necessary cost.
And the losses we all must face,
Make us stronger in the end.
I will slip the blade deep into your back.
Like you did to me a thousand times before.
You will fall.
We will struggle as I have before,
Still attempting to love you like a brother.
When the vile stench of your blood fades away,
This will be my day.
