When will the pieces align to restore our sight?
Memories can't fill this void.
Forever winding on.
When will the pieces align to restore our sight?
Breath life and revive.
All efforts will burn as an offering.
Wicked eyes fall shut as hope is shattered.
Weary limbs grow numb when vision is shadowed.
We've come to carry the forgotten
Back into the light.
