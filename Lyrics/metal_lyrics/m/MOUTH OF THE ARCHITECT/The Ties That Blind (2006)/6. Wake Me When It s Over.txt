This truth has buried its fire
Deep into your kiss
Burning clean everything
Burning clean everything
My honor holds the ashes
As the light exposes
The regret in my eyes
The regret in my eyes

The sky embraces the flames
A phoenix reborn
Let it hold your heart
I will never leave your side
Let it hold your heart
I will never leave your side
Your side
