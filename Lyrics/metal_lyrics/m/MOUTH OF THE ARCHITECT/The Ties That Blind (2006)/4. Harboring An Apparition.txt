What was once held so close
Has decayed
All hope turned to dust

What was once held so close
Has decayed
All hope turned to dust

What was once held so close
Has decayed
What was once held so close
Has decayed

With tired eyes
We've wept in defeat
Each step forward was lost
Then you were gone
We did nothing
We did nothing
We did nothing
We did nothing
We did nothing
To deserve this
