It swelled to the surface
And broke the skin
A growing storm
Uncontrollable
You let it die
In your arms
Our tears couldn't carry you
Our tears couldn't carry you

We watched you fall
Into the fire alone
We watched you fall
Into the fire alone
Alone

Our hearts broke without you
Our hearts would have followed you
Our hearts broke without you
Our hearts would have followed you
Our hearts broke without you
Our hearts would have followed you
Our hearts
