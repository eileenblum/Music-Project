Drifting further
Fading away
Sinking deeper
Drifting further
Fading away

Rise and fall
Collapse and crawl
To carry the weight
To carry the weight of
Everything
Rise and fall
Collapse and crawl
To carry the weight
To carry the weight of
Everything

Our heads hang low
So low
No one wished to settle here
Our heads hang low
So low
No one wished to settle here
Our heads hang low
So low
No one wished to settle here
Settle here
