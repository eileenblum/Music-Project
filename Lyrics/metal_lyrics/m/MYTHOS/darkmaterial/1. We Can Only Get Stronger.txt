Respect the heritage of your flesh &amp; blood
Experiment the limits... of your soul
while your roots are torn from the ground
Look deep into the eyes of your fate

"I am stronger than You,
I'll always be stronger!"

Think misfortune is inevitable
A thorn in your flesh over the course of our short lives
A dark cloud is following me called
Sadness clouding the sky and casting its shadows into the light of my day
Existence, what a mysterious deal!

We can only get stronger!!!
Let your dim light fade...
I can only get stronger!!!
...if you feel like fading...

The faces in despair in my dream of anxiety
crying for returning back to reality
It all feels so right leaving them all behind
A misfortune for them that's
