Shut up Sit back And listen!
Put six six six together and
you will get eighteen
With a bit of magic and substance D
I've taken your mind
I growl in Victory!

This kind of magic I hold
takes away lives and time
In the sleep in the night
I'm spreading lies and cry:

"It's gonna be my game you're all playing
I've given you something to die for..."

People who come to belief never
really come back to their senses
You've limited yourselves to an dead end and that's so true...
You're falling so I give you a push...
'cos I'm burning,
I'm burning with desire...

You're just a penguin in the crowd
afraid of the ugliness hiding behind
those painted empty shells...
Taken in a dream

Making belief, looking so
