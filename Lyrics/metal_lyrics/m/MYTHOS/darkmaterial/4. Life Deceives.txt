Who dies tonight?
Who tries suicide this night,
and will survive?
If dying is the way to leave
Queen Easy, you must go...
The strength of will to kill decides...
...It is only the mortal that dies!
Life deceives and love leaves...
We've become like a sickness
that was long neglected...

I am your enemy My friend
The emptiness that is left
Why don't you do what you dream?

Be powerful, beautiful and without regret...
One/Two/Three/Four
"S" dies tonight...
What else could've you done than this...
with the shitty cards you're dealt...
Be powerful, beautiful and dead...
