Hell,
Reality always bites,
it is not man's best friend!
Never living up to the memories...
The road to HELL surely is paved with afterwisdom!
Now, all that I do, come to...
HURTS!!!
My inside serves me well!
Within the True Myself I always am,
hidden in this silence I know...
You are something whose "lights"
I'm turning off...
(permanently!)
When you're going to your grave
you go there with your mouth
still open to the question:
"What did I do?"
That's how you're going to be buried,
you're mouth open wide...
These are the kind of thoughts
that only go one way straight to the heart
...and they're full of Poison...
The Poison of HATE!
Reality feeds me poison only to become so mad
I could spit nails...!
I meet challenges... Alone...
and tread lightly on my path to Hell!
My inside, The one side of truth...
My skin leaves so much to hide,
My black heart pumping hate
"What did you do?"
You'll Learn, you'll find out
