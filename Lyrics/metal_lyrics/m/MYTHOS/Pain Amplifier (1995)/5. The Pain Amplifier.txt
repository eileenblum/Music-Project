[Hautaniemi]

I don`t know where I`m going but I`m already waiting to get there. I`m lost in You in a half-life state, dead- but still conscious. You can`t make me disappear. I`m inside You. And I really hope that You last!

[Chorus:]
Pain is written all over your face. I`M THE PAIN AMPLIFIER! You are mine Forever and ever...

You can`t make me disappear (from your life.) I`m inside of You and You`d better beware of My Fire or it`ll burn you, too... I hope that You last, since... Dying ain`t much of a livin` !
