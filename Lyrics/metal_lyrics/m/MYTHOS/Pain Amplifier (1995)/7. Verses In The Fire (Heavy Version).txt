[Hautaniemi]

Hidden legends, secret they may be. Not meant for all of us to know. Those who studied and believed - used the magic. Pay now responsability for all the horrors unlesahed. The ones only to roam in the Land Of No Return...

[Chorus:]
Burn the book, Verses in fire. Spare no time. Struggle and survive. It`s more than just.. The whole book of verses.

Temptating it is... Smoky characters, taking shapes. Voices in utterly hideous tones. Pages crakle and burn. Letters vanish in flames... 

[Chorus]

Creatures in black dimensions, the bringers of dark. Better to forget legends, Verses perish in flames... LET IT BURN !
