[Hautaniemi]

Watching against the setting Sun, our tears fall like the Rain through the night. Pity me in my melancholy. Cool breeze keeps its promise. Hear the long, Sad Song. Buried in my thoughts, listening to the wind blow...

[Chorus:]
 UNREAL MOON, which is the Real one? LIKE A DREAM, like and illusion.. The One you`d least wanted to see. My Anxious face turned to the Moon.

[Repeat 1st verse]

[Chorus]
