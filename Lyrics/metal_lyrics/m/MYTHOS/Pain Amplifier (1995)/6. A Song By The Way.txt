[Hautaniemi]

A man with a battle within his sould rides in a carriage pulled by two horses, that both pull to opposite directions. The other is incontrollable. They are the Spirit and the Soul...

[Chorus:]
The driver struggling forever in reins. Embodiment of sense. Right to a soul hard to reach. Possible, if just a man can persuade the Lion in Himself to help, to keep the Dragon in control. The spiral`s continous twists and turns have a mystic meaning attached to the Fate of Soul. Keep the Lion and the Dragon...

[Chorus]

[Repeat 3rd verse]
