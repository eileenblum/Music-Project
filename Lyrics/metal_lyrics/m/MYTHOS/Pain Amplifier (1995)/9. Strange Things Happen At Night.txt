[Hautaniemi]

As I was lighting the Fire in the Study, I suddenly felt the weight of watching eyes. I lifted my head and caught the sight of two eyes out of the flames at Me. A low voice was what I heard:

From the Outer, Inner, Astral and Ethereal plains, The Hordes are gathering. No sanctuary is Eternal!

And as the magic fade away the shadows started to grow on me

So hear now all the Deadeyed souls, Who have spent their lives and just grown Old... Hear the Cries of the Deadeyed souls, Who have spent their lives... Now they are turning...
