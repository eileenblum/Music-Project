Hatred and rage spiral through my being as I try to contain my malevolence
Things have changed. Evil controls this, evil controls this. The philosophy behind. Go through it in the whole. Do not prove. Warn me. Self damnation of my mind. I will not exist to you in any form. The time has come to be more than what we have chosen to be and now, I rise to reach a pinnacle I have not seen achieved. The torment come to people that want. We have took in. To become my own source of life, expansion, creation. The choice has been made. You cannot come, creation sustaining. the more that I took. We shall not rest,we never see the light, ripped to peace, apart. We shall not be a pawn, or carry the flag, it is not a task for our kind. We shall not be at peace, while any breathe. No more composed. In the voice of absolving the normal form. You can return to your lives, with the symptoms of my design. You shall succeed
