Within the Digress of Human purpose, enmity enshrined in vibrations of hate, contorted throught the, the conscious mind, the psychotic visions come fulfilled.
Fuck you and your trap you fucking 
Forcing all the suffering in the abyss of the maya, forcing all the suffering in the abyss of the maya
Why, why, why?
I am this realm you are trespassing in my eyes, you shall suffer endlessly, now suffer endlessly.
Forgotten, now shall you watch this be, shall you earn your memory?
(Fall) Ensnared in your own trap, I laugh at your struggle.
Now how to express this frantic brilliance, I forsee futures past the end of all that begins. Your corruption is mine, and our sanctity within now your pain is. A story once told made fact into flesh, the mythos not hollow in merit. You the disease in life, plague of this realm, kin of aziz.
In your WAR.
No longer remorse nor sympathy, instinct action and pain, the sub- level of compromise
No longer remorse nor sympathy, instinct action and pain, the sub- level of compromise
Cries for help go unheard, suffering. I wish to distort. Your reality. Piercing your weaknesses, Kill. The torture. Left for dead. Die. Die. Die.
