Reconstruct, reformed, revealed 

The True nature 
The substance of 
mans inherant 
lust for the meaningless 

I 
I have found 
I 
I have found 

That I was programmed and shown a way of life, servitude. 
Deemed worthy only by my level of 

acquisitions, that at life's end hold no meaning, empty embracing only void, only upheld by knowing that there is more to this 

I 
I have found 
I 
I have found 

Intensified 
deprogramming 
Self realizing 
Allowing collapse 

I define my own path, realize, meaning, 
conquer, challenges, 
goals set to reach the plateau of my being 

Substance that I found, which i once never believed 
I now stand proud and redefined 
Staying open to realize my next journey 

I 
I have found 
I 
I have found
