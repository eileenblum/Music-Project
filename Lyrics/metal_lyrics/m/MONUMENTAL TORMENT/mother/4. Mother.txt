Closing my eyes, slowing my breathe to get to the stillness. 

The peaceful silence, the golden peace, that the conscious life distracts us, further from the origin. 

Rest, as close as we can come to the comfort, sanctity of the womb. 
Born, slowly absorbing 
adjusting to the new realm. 
Light, shapes, Colors, form. 
The chaos of ego, mind, life develop, 
becoming purpose. Selfishness and service, 

the accepted, taught path of survival. 

Have we gained sight or was it lost? Was anything before? How deep can I go into the being that I am? Have I lost the ability, Throughout life chasing fleeting materialism? 

Take charge, forge the new path 

Take back the peace we had
