Coming closer, to the edge, pushed to the brink 

The moment passes, collapse preceeded by, anticipation, nervous succumbing to eventuality 

Uncentered 

I know it is time to become what life requires, I know I cannot deny this forced transition 

Undeniable, unrelenting 

The reality, the weight to bare 
No choice, no time to spare 

Desperation, confusion, intimidation 

Drowning 
Writhing 
Prisoner of my uncontrolled mind 
Suffocating, searching for escape 

Falling further, deeper into, the abyss 

Suddenly I can breathe 
Light ascends, the dawn approaches 

Gasping, grounded, finding my center, knowing I can never return 
I hold my head high and ascend 

Sacrificing life, sacrifice the life that we once lived, Sacrificing life, going beyond to find more 
Sacrificing life, sacrifice the life that we once lived, enduring progression, evolving without choice. 

Gasping, grounded, finding my center, knowing I can never return 
I hold my head high and ascend 

Sacrificing life, sacrifice the life that we once lived, Sacrificing life, going beyond to find more 
Sacrificing life, sacrifice the life that we once lived, enduring progression, evolving without choice.
