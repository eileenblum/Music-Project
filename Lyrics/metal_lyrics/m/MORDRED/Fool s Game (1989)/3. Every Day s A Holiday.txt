I like to sleep all day
Go to work? Ha, no way
I see you work so hard
To pay your credit card

I see you bust your ass
To buy a new bus pass
So you can go to work
Like every other jerk

Every day's a holiday - Do you know what I mean?
Every day's a holiday
Don't you wish you were just like me?

I see you pay your dues
This is the life you choose
But nothing's guaranteed
Life's just a game to me

I see you bust your ass
So I think I'd rather pass
You buy the things you need
's all stuff I get for free

Every day's a holiday - Why work up a sweat?
Every day's a holiday
Don't you wish you were just like me?

[Repeat Chorus]

Every day's a holiday
