Recklessly they waged their wars
Open wounds behind closed doors
Shed your fears the morbid cheers
Apocalypse draws ever near
Laugh with sinners cry with saints
The life we lead has no restraints
No holds barred our bodies scarred
These creeps were made for marching hard

Reckless abandon living for today
The streets our schools defiance rules
Until the judgement day
Reckless abandon technicolor grey
One way to live one life to give
No morals to betray

Trapped by fear and locked away
To never see the light of day
Paranoid and self-destroyed
The mind's eye scans the endless void
Let the death bell toll
The clock may stop the hand may fall
Untold lies of paradise
A wasted day a wasted life

Reckless abandon living for today
The streets our schools defiance rules
Until the judgement day
Reckless abandon technicolor grey
One way to live one life to give
No morals to betray

[Solos]

Take the time to redefine
Read the truth between the lines
Feed the frame of discontent
Time on earth is nearly spent
These four walls are closing in
The war that you can never win
Nothing ventured nothing gained
This hell on earth will never change

[Repeat Chorus]
