Just like a flame memory starts to burn
Out of the past, voices re-emerge
They bring to mind days when you were young
Bid life farewell when all is said and done

[Chorus]
Shatter - Mirror cracks, you see the light
Shudder - As death stares you in the eyes
Cry out - As your life comes to an end
Darkness - A loaded gun your only friend

The blade of time cuts away the years
Songs of lament are ringing in your ears
In from outside (?? - MG) images of death
Bid life farewell and catch your final breath

[Repeat Chorus]

[Solos]

[Repeat Chorus]

SHATTER
