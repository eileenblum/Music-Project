There's a method to madness
It measures in by the light
There's an evil among us
And it's blinding our sight

Propaganda, deception
Their subliminal lies
Infiltrate the airwaves
The light in your eyes

[Chorus]
Spellbound by the light
You don't have the right
To ever ask why
They're ruling your mind

Mass mental disorder
A generation ago
They're lost in confusion
Let you question the people
Who are plotting these schemes
When they silence your questions
When they shatter your dreams

[Repeat Chorus]

Heed they
D-Day never mentioned
Victims - programmed with precision
Punished - by the television

[Solos]

[Repeat Chorus Twice]
