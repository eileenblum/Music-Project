Can you see the substance of who you really are?
Dig deep into your psyche, do you find the scar?
Unlock subliminal secrets, touch me with your past
Then try to understand the way that you've been cast

[Chorus]
I have tried many times
To reveal my inner State of Mind
(Must be blind)
[Repeat]

Your mind reveals itself, although it's hard to do
Don't fear the fury and passion that burns inside of you
Stare deep into my eyes, your body becomes relaxed
Strip layers from subconscious, discover past life facts

[Repeat Chorus]

[Solos]

Can you see the substance of who you really are?
Dig deep into your psyche, do you find the scar?
I know it's just a theory with elements of doubt
Don't take it all too serious, that's not what we're about

[Repeat Chorus]
