Brought-to shores across the sea
He dreamt it was his fate
Fought-to set an order pure
Facist world of hate
Pray - for outcasts sent to die
They have no hearts to fight
Pay - the dues you owe yourself
To free them on this night

A gasious rain falls down to stop the ones
Who speak the truth but lack the voice of guns
And they die

Try-to stop the man in charge
He fills our mind in fear
Cry-for those who've already died
Their killers won't shed a tear
Night-has fallen premature
Darkness shades the land
Fight-for one last chance to live
And crush the killer's hand

[Chorus]

[Repeat Chorus]
