See now how I am
Care for no-one
Don't give a damn

Dive in
To my mind
Search for some emotion you can't find

Feel numb
No pain
I'm lost

Won't you take my hand?
Remember what you said
What we planned

Can't you
Forget my name?
Some things change, you'll stay the same

Feel numb
No pain
I'm lost
And I've changed

[Solos]

Dive into my mind
Search for some emotion you can't find

Feel numb
No pain
I'm lost
Feel numb
No pain
I'm lost

And I've changed...
