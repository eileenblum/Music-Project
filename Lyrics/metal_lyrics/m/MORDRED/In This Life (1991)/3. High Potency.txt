Today's another hopeless day
Downtown surrounds
Cohesive thoughts cannot be made
The light, it fades

I raise my head up to the sky
Don't care, can't fly
The army forces altered me
You pass me by

Not hard to see
My system used me
High potency

Interrogated from the government seat
Manipulation
Mind exploited until complete
Hallucination

LSD into my system
CIA experimentation
The real world has slipped away
Illusions never fade

Not hard to see
My system used me
High potency

Not hard to see
My system used me
High potency
