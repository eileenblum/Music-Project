Never happy never pleased
maybe not what you forsee
These cats don't know what's up
Passively observing it all
Put you up on a pedestal
Try to make you larger than life
But how can you be down
With your head high in the sky

Stand my ground
Won't back down

Keep my integrity
Never compromise
Say what I believe
Won't be pacified

Stand my ground
Won't back down

Yes we've been around
Sound surrounding is sick
Staying underground
Not on an ego trip

No we won't pay to play
It puts no food on the table
Except the old promoter
It buys him a billiard table
All these people sucking blood
It's a wonder we don't run dry
But music's in our blood
It's not like they don't try

Stand my ground
Won't back down

Keep my integrity
Never compromise
Say what I believe
Won't be pacified

Stand my ground
Won't back down

Yes we've been around
Sound surrounding is sick
Staying underground
Not on an ego trip

Woman here no money there
But she said she's help me out
I better get some cash some day
Of that I have my doubts
Make me sick make me cry
If you con't compromise
But we have our beliefs
And our pride so realize
