Now that I'm feeling downtown
Like never before
Now that I'm folding my fingers
Ready for war
The painted face of disaster
I search for more

I light another cigarette
Swallow the poison glossy eyed
Dressed in fire with empty words
It came as no surprise

The people conversating
Beyond all will to listen
The people will stand in lines
With great high walls between them

Coal black hair china white doll skull
With amber slit eyes
Bittersweet with a razor tongue
See through polished lies
The dim light is bathing you blood red
Adrenalin shock

I light another cigarette
Swallow the poison glossy eyed
Dressed in fire with empty words
It came as no surprise

The people conversating
Beyond all will to listen
The people will stand in lines
With great high walls between them

Looking through star dust illusions with faraway eyes
Pretending they know and understand
See through the disguise

I light another cigarette
Swallow the poison glossy eyed
Dressed in fire with empty words
It came as no surprise

The people conversating
Beyond all will to listen
The people will stand in lines
With great high walls between them
