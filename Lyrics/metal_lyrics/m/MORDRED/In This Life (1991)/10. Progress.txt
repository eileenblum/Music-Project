Into the grey sky
Blackness is blown
From this great machine breathing smoke

Hammering pistons
Churning of gears
Furnace of coals remain stoked

Roar of a turbine
Scream of a jet
Man's dream to learn how to fly

Mimicking nature
Study the wind
Travel on air through the sky

Progress comes from the will to learn
Conquest stems from the greed of man
Can't fuse science with hatred
Can't fuse

Advance not with destruction
Proceed defying corruption
Gain ground keep moving forward
Gain ground

Towering structures
Steel and stone
Built on the land that we kill

Burning our forest
Draining our lakes
Forward progression our will

Splitting the atom
Power to threat
Evil we hold in our hands

Frighten our neighbours
Pointing our guns
Until they reach our demands

Progress comes from the will to learn
Conquest stems from the greed of man
Can't fuse science with nature
Can't fuse

Advance not with destruction
Proceed defying corruption
Gain ground keep moving forward
Gain ground
