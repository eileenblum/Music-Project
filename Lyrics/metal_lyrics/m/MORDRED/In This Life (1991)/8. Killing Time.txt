Two stars collide in space
I see it clear
Star dust upon my face
Why should I care

A far off hidden place
I visit there
It makes me feel safe
Stops the despair

Help me find
My way out
Can't believe
You've no doubt

Just killing time
On nothing we depend
Shattered hopes - for the moment
We amend

You know you look the same
As my old friend
I can't recall your name
Or where you've been

You cannot take the blame
For thoughts you send
And you can't play the game
Around the blend

Help me find
My way out
Can't believe
You've no doubt

Just killing time
Until we meet again
Guaranteed - disappointment
In the end
