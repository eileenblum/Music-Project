They're making you believe
That what they sell is what you need
Your decadence starts your decay

Bullshit lies is what you've seen
Censorship on the screen
This is your window to the world

You work - you spend
This trend will never end
Why don't you open up your eyes?

The truth - they hide
No doubt the news has lied
Why don't you open up your mind?

This ain't what life's about
Dislocate
That ain't the real thing
It's a fake
I don't beliefe a word
Deviate
Have it your own way

Consuming all we can
Wealth and stature make a man
Unto this screen you are a slave

Images of what is in
Controls your mind until the end
This is your window to the world

You work - you spend
No time to make amends
Into a wonderland you're hurled

The truth - they hide
Of wars when lands collide
Is this your window to the world?

This ain't what life's about
Dislocate
That ain't the real thing
It's a fake
I don't beliefe a word
Deviate
Have it your own way
