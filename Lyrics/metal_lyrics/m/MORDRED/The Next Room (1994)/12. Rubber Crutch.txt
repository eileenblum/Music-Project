Turn around, not looking at me kindly
View me as a party to be shamed
Pour me out, fill the moat so dear to your mama
Pray aloud for a lamb to lead astray

Lies and warnings
Greying men, wringing hands
Lies and warnings
All the heads are in the sand

Gravity - tore the door so slowly
In position - for a speedy escape
Stare - I've stared for an hour or more
How much longer will it take?

Lies and warnings
Greying men, wringing hands
Lies and warnings
All the heads are in the sand

Is there a reason that compels you to avow?
You've got to squander your days
I know you're worried for my eternal soul
But mama, I don't want to stay

[Solo]

Lies and warnings
Idiots, Uncle Sam
Lies and warnings
Let them show you to the promised land

Is there a reason not to turn the corner 'round
Must we piss away the day?
I know you're worried for my eternal soul
But mama I just want to play

Is this the way that you will murder your mind
The lie on which you depend?
There's lots of people that you can't stand...
Ride up to the end
Ride up to the end

Ride up to the end
