"Dream while you can" I was saying
As the hurricane approached us from the east
Sleep in your eyes was all the medicine you needed
And your fever decreased

You're a little high
Just a little scared and a little cold
Loosen up those legs at the open sky
Let it all unfold

I wouldn't hold you down
I guess it's not my way
But you refuse to cry
And then you fall behind

"Sleep while you can" I was saying
As the hurricane approached us from the west
Dream if you can
Of all the worlds that open up to you
When you are at rest

You're a little high
Just a little scared and a little cold
Loosen up... at the open sky
Let it all unfold

I wouldn't hold you down
I guess it's not my way
First you refuse to cry
And then you fall behind

[Solo]

I'd never hold you down
You know it's not my way
First you refused to cry
And then you fall behind
