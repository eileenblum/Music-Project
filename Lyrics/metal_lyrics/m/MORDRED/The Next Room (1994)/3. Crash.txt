It's just a gift to the earth not to breed
She took his silence to mean he agreed
They rode a wave of nostalgia
That crashed like a flue

Punching neglect it'd do this to him
She grew aware of their stitching of limbs
And she taught them to move
Traded her own life anew

Yeah, can't touch her now
You've been squeezed out
Your set's crashing down
Alone in your mess on the stage

He drove a car that had wood on the side
See it first and it'd knock you as fine
But his intentions were crystalline right from the start

Fighting the way back, a pressure so real
She learned a method, a strategy how to conceal how she felt
When nothing was left in her heart

Yeah, can't hurt her now
Don't you know that you've been tuned out
The set's crashing down
You're alone in a mess on the stage

[Breakdown with scratching]

[Solo]

..... power from deep in a dream
Float to the surface and let out your scream
Show the mistake, can't turn away

"Call me a victim", he said to his bed
He never guessed that her ignorance wasn't sincere
It was fear

You can't know her now
Don't you know that you've been left out
The curtain is down
Alone in the dark on the stage

Never flow our way
Never go away
Never go away
Never go your way
