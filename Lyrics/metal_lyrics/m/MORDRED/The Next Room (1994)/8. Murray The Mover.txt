Hey you've got some and...
Mama, you've got some, I'm begging baby please
No, don't you drop me, just telling you what I know
Girl you know you've got some
So come on mama let's go

....'s finally brought you out
I'm looking you up, looking you up, girl you're found
Tell me, tell me are you down
We're taking a ride, taking a ride

Damn, got both hands tied up with fascination
Have another goddamn drink to help my concentration
Yes I'm working you into a fever pitch
Baby you've just got to admit
I'm one slick son of a bitch

I'm Murray the mover
Your worry soother
Dig my maneuvers

Now I'm talking you're listening to what I say
Girl I gotta wonder why you seem to be getting up and walking away
Soon you'll miss me, I'm willing to be kind
Yeah... you'll see the sign

... has finally brought you home
I'm looking you up, looking you up, girl you're found
Tell me, tell me are you down
We're taking a ride, taking a ride

I'm Murray the mover
Your worry soother
Dig my maneuver

[Guitar Solo]

Hey... now I got your attention baby
Layin' off or richochetin', there's got to be a better way
Are you little just asleep
Still water's running deeper
Still water's running deeper
Still water's running deeper
Still water's running deeper
[A few more times.....!]

I'm Murray the mover
Your worry soother, yeah you know
I'm just a groover
Dig my maneuver, you know you've got to

[Fade out]
