Under the overpass tossing lit matches around
You burned my favourite shirt, ended up on the ground
You ended up on the ground

That was when
All the days
Went to one
In a haze

And we never had to try.....

Down by the ocean we watch as the sun hits the waves
Dark in the twilight, I don't see you slipping away
Dark in the twilight, I don't see you slipping away

That was then
And we knew
Wouldn't end
Believed it too

When you said
We were kin
Made me proud
That was then...

And we never had to try
Never saw the gap until we could fit inside

[Solo]

So we never had to try
Never saw the gap until we could fit inside

Last time I saw you you looked like a dog in the rain
Greetings were murmured and then we just walked on again
Then we just walked on again

So it goes
As we age
Chapter's end
Flip the page
No surprise
Not much pain
I'll survive
If I don't see you again
