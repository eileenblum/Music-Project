You've got me lying on the ceiling
My world's turned upside down
I'm unaccustomed to this feeling
Better let me loose right now

Get away from the back of my brain and the front of my heart
Get away and the pit of my pain is an alien part
Any day with a diligent turn of convenient lies
You'll go, I'll stay, it'll be better that way

I'm hanging limp like a weasel
Which hunts the fine sight of your flesh
You'll have to walk around
With my body hanging down
Or tumble down the stairs
Meet me at the bottom

Get away from the back of the brain and the front of my heart
Get away and the pit of my pain is an alien part
Any day with a diligent turn of convenient lies
You'll go, I'll stay, it'll be better that way

[Breakdown]

A big attack is better for me, you'll turn it around
Feel like a fish washed out of the sea, it's tough to breathe
You'll throw me back and if you wish I'll disappear
You'll feel much better in time, time for me to go

My fingers cold on the window
I see you walking out, pressed to the pane

Get away from the back of my brain and the front of my heart
Get away and the pit of my pain is an alien part
Every day with a diligent turn of convenient lies
You'll go, I'll stay, it'll be better that way
