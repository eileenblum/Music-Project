See the full moon rising
Under purple skies
Breath is coming closer
As the evil cries
No holy bible
Reduce my aims
Condemned to violence
The kiss of death remains

My eyes can't see
My hands can't feel
You!

Dream evil
It's inside
Dream evil
Black night

Darkness all around me
Voices in my head
Scarring my brain
Cold sweat on the surface
When the shape of faces still remain
