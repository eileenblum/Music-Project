Into the darkened horizon
Passing the gates where the eagles cry
Thunder and lightning below
Black clouds ahead in the sky

Gripped by a force field
I'm condemned to hell
This place is hard to explode
Lead to salvation on altars of steel
Turning my gain overload

A light in the black
We're burning the sky
Fire and lightning
I am sworn
A light in the black
Riding the night
On wheels of fire
Into the dawn
A light in the black

Into the wild mountain thunder
Passing the trail under blood red skies
Cruising the desert below
Hot burning sand in my eyes
