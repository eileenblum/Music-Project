Where the sound of thunder kills the silence
The conquest of evil forces eternal skies
Sworn to ride side by side
Capture, rape and slain
The guardians of Hades will open their gates
To endless pain
Under the flag of hope and glory
Riding the wind to battle within

Where the kiss of judas split the sky
Unholy forces, rulers of darkness and light
Born to steal, rape and kill
Fight in god's forsake
On the horizon so red in the dark
In blood you kneel

Blood of the kings for you heart I'm breathing
Flying on the wings of no return
Blood of the kings for your heart I'm breathing
Flying on the wings of no return

Blood of the kings

Smoke lies on the battlefield
Storm begins to rise
Nights of pain and misery
Fear caught in his eyes
There he stands where bodies lie
Crippled on the ground
Fame is what he's looking for
And hell is what he's found
