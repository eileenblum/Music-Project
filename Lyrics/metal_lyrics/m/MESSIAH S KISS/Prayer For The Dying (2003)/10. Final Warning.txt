Just another sleepless night
And the shadow's dancing scary on your ceiling
Are you afraid of this?
Another lightning strikes
Split the blackness powerful while you're still dreming

It's way past sundown
On the verge of night
A blinding light reveals
And you're the witness of a vicious light

Can't you read the signs of the final warning
A light breeze rises up to a mighty storm
Raise your glance and see the sky is burning
Dreadful silhouettes crawling to the door

Don't try to run away
Cause what I feel right now
Is real and not just fantasy
Don't you believe in this?
Don't try to hide away
You feel paralyzed and shocked
By these extremities
