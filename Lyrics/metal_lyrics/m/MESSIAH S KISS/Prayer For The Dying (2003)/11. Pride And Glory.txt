The atmosphere burns
The enforcement arise
The light shining bright
And the new game is near
Emotions so black
When they move in to fight
The onslaught is raging
With powerful might

Accelerate the skid cuts the ice
Can you feel it, the revenge in your eyes

Hard speed attacks
Tough body checks
Your adversary's hunting
You yearn to strike back
Destination forward
While the game is still tie
You got to score now
Cause time's running by

Pride and glory still believe
That you bring back your name to the board
In bright neon lights
Pride and glory burns to win
The bullet hits hard like a missile crushes in
Crushes in
