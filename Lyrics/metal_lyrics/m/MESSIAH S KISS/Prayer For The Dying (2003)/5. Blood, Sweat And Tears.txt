We came into this hell arena
The audience screaming loud
We're the real new gladiators
Standing here so proud

My eyes fixed the enemy
Standing on the other side
Blood runs hot in my veins
Ready to fight, yeah

Blood, sweat and tears
Blood, sweat and tears
Blood, sweat, tears

The show is over, we have won
Standing on the top
We played the bame, no compromise
Standing like a rock
Like a rock
