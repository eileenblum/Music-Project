Riding alone all night down the highlands
Feeling so cold when the rain starts to fall
I need a look from your eyes
Like a star shining bright
And I can't stand holding on anymore
When the night comes down
When the night comes down

Up here in space
Voices are calling inside
Running through the darkness
Close to the edge like a thief in the night
Like a nightmare's coming
All your secret moves
Tearing all those chain away from my hearts

The silver starlight
Moving away out of sight
On the road to nowhere
Driving my heel in the hard pouring rain

I've been captured like a slave who's torn apart
But I can't stand holding on anymore
