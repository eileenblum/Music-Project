I'm caught in self destruction
I spend my life in hell
No gladness, no crying
Don't see the light of day

Darkness illuminates you
Black night slowly arise

Reign of fire, tears and sin
There's no shelter from the night
Trails of pain and agony
No place left to hide
Reign of fire

There is no rhyme no reason
My fear builds up inside
Deep sorrow, no way out
There's no relief in sight

Nightmares of darkness and you
Looks like my fate has come true
The siren keeps howling my name
Leading me straight to the flame
