See the light on the horizon
Colors turning into black
You can't cry, you can't hide
You can't dream on

There is no more tomorrow
Where the elder read the signs
Out of dark it came without a warning

When the seventh angel cracked the seal
The human race will die
It's the prophecy, our destiny
The fear

From the eternal void
Out of space and time
Rising in the darkness
Rising from the sky
Thunderball, thunderball, thunderball

Global killers on collision course
Do we have to pay for sins?
Feel the storm is coming nearer
Armageddon!
