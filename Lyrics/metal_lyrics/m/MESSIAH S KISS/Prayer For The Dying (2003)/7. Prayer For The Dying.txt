See the lights of history
Still burning in the black
Rising on the cemetery of fear
Malice and invisible
The nightmare's still alive
Sacrifice the hands of destiny

Pushed in the crossfire
Pretending to win
I'm losing control
Mountains of madness
A wall made of sin
The power holds on
A prayer for the dying

See the writings on the wall
The letters printed in blood
Tangled in the web of force control
Innocent persecutees
Into the hands of fate
Begging for relief they turned to stone
