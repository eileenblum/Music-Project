You show no respect in my growing of age
No longer a kid in a pink painted cage
Why don't you stop with your wise smart speech
Won't listen no more to all the rubbish you teach

Tameless and stronger than ever before
My fuel is injected
Walking the straight line gonna take what I see
This is the difference between you and me
Don't expect I join your way
Time to accept me here and today

Set my puppets on fire I stop to play
Threw my life guide to the wall
And keep the faith to what I say
I'll be successful in all that I do
Someday believe me
My dreams will come true

Don't expect I join your way
Time to accept me here and today
Don't expect I join your way
Time to accept me here and today

Sharp as steel sting the night
Feel the power grow inside
Pride you feel deep within
Flesh and blood
Mortal sin
