Wherever you are
You will live on in my memory
Whoever you are
Your immortality haunts me

Perspiration on his brow
Can you see the early warning
Nothing now can stop the man
That believes it is his calling

Crowds of people stand around
But no one seems to notice
Come the time to detonate
All the world will focus

So where is your god right now
While you're dying in the street
And do the dead have a choice
Which maker will they meet

Bow down, people bow down
To your immortal memory
Your faith is just a bloodstain on the ground
Of your immortal memory
You justify your reasons to die
For your immortal memory
But the blood spilt in your name will never dry
On your immortal memory

Martyrs fuel the pious prayers
That claim to save his nation
But the moral code is lock and load
And self gratification

Those he dies for die beside him
His will became their grief
Survivors run like refugees
From this war of blind belief

So what of your people now
As they lie dead in the street
Too late to realize
That there weas no one to meet

Bow down, people bow down
To your immortal memory
Your faith is just a bloodstain on the ground
Of your immortal memory
You justify your reasons to die
For your immortal memory
But the blood spilt in your name will never dry
On your immortal memory

Bow down, people bow down
To your immortal memory
Bow down, people bow down
Of your immortal memory
Bow down, people bow down
For your immortal memory
Now you pray to the god, you never found
Your immortal memory

Wherever you are
You will live on in my memory
