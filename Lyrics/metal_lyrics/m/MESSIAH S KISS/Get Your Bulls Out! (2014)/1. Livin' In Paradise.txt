It's like livin' in...
It's like livin' in...
It's like livin' in...
It's like livin' in...
Livin' in paradise

Show me a sign
Grant a wish
Take a long walk home underneath the rainbow
And when the mountains breathe
The dust and the sky all turn red

I can't make my mind up
I can't imagine what life would be
Why should we have to worry
I can see right through paradise

You slammed my head inside the drawer
Then stole my money, left me beggin' for more
You kicked my ass right out the door
We should be livin' in
We should be livin' in paradise
(I can see my paradise
Hear the chilling cries
I can feel the burning fires
Through my veins and bloodshot eyes)

Oh it's a beautiful day
It's written on your face, oh we can live forever
Someday we'll all be gone
But life still goes on, I'd rather die together

I can't make my mind up
I can't imagine what life would be
Why should we have to worry
I can see right through paradise

You slammed my head inside the drawer
Then stole my money, left me beggin' for more
You kicked my ass right out the door
We should be livin' in
We should be livin' in paradise
(I can see my paradise
Hear the chilling cries
I can feel the burning fires
Through my veins and bloodshot eyes)

Why should we have to worry
I can see right through paradise

Show me a sign
Grant a wish
Take a long walk home underneath the rainbow
And when the mountains breathe
The dust and the sky all turn red

I can't make my mind up
I can't imagine what life would be
Why should we have to worry
I can see right through paradise

You slammed my head inside the drawer
Then stole my money, left me beggin' for more
You kicked my ass right out the door
We should be livin' in
We should be livin' in paradise
(I can see my paradise
Hear the chilling cries
I can feel the burning fires
Through my veins and bloodshot eyes)
