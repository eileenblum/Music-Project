I'm walking the streets in the pouring rain
A sadden silence and the lights are low
I wanna scream, but I can't  cry out
This is the final show, oh the final show

Time's slipping by where the memories fade
Blown away by the winds of change
All the hopes and dreams decay to dust
Stains on my walk of fame, stains on my way

Can you see the sun go down
Can you see the world turn round tell me where
The heroes are gone
The capitol of dreams
Drowned in sinful streams
All along the sunset boulevard

In the city of angels
Left out in the cold
In the city of angels
Left out in the cold

The sting of abandon still burns in my heart
Feeling lonely in the dark
Look up into the sky, but there's no stars
A sidewalk preacher holds his final prayer

Can you see the sun go down
Can you see the world turn round tell me where
The heroes are gone
The capitol of dreams
Drowned in sinful streams
All along the sunset boulevard

In the city of angels
Left out in the cold
City of angels
The city of angels

I want you baby
In the city of angels
Left out in the cold
In the city of angels
Left out in the cold
Left out in the cold

Drowned in my sweet sorrows
Drowned in my sweet dreams
The city of angels
