Razor sharp out of the distance
He's coming closer with the speed of light
Seeker of all danger
A messenger of hell to stir the night

Reach out for the future world at the speed of light
Striking through the age of mystery
Carry on your lionheart behind the heavens gates
Break the chains of all the misery
Steelrider

Turn the key for ignition
Heavy power engines come alive
Heading out to the blue skies
Gear up for the hellride of your life

Reach out for the future world at the speed of light
Striking through the age of mystery
Carry on your lionheart behind the heavens gates
Break the chains of all the misery
Steelrider, steelrider

Hungry for the revolution
They know the hands of time how will they pay
Fear the faces of redemption
They paste it to the wall to fade away

Reach out for the future world at the speed of light
Striking through the age of mystery
Carry on your lionheart behind the heavens gates
Break the chains of all the misery
Steelrider, steelrider, steelrider
Steelrider
