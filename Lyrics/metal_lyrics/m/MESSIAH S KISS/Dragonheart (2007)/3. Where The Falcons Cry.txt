At the end of time
When souls cry out for eternal life
You're lost without a trace
Led to salvation

When the mirror torn to pieces
You're lost in dark
Chapters of your life revealed
On wings of faith and eternity
To the place where the evil dies

Where the falcons cry, cry
Where the falcons cry
On wings of wonder
Where the rainbow touches the sky, sky, sky
Where the falcons cry

Under bloodred skies
Where the moonlight's your eternal guide
Darkness closing in
On the streets of your life, your life

When the mirror torn to pieces
You're lost in dark
Chapters of your life revealed
On wings of faith and eternity
To the place where the evil dies

Where the falcons cry, cry
Where the falcons cry
On wings of wonder
Where the rainbow touches the sky, sky, sky
Where the falcons cry, yeah
Oh where the falcons cry

Where the falcons cry, cry
Where the falcons cry
On wings of wonder
Where the rainbow touches the sky, sky, sky
Where the falcons cry
On wings of wonder
Where the rainbow touches the sky, sky, sky
Where the falcons cry, yeah
Oh where the falcons cry
