Coming out of nowhere lands
Raging from the skies
Roaring like a thunderball
Fire spitting eyes
Rushed in fields of energy
Blazing speed of light
Riding from the skies above
Crushed in deepest night

Blaze in hell with tons of steel
Silver cycles roll the wheel

The stench of rubber cut the air
The grounds begin to shake
A glint of fire approaches in the dark
Dragonheart

Shooting loud and furious
Blazing hell on wheels
Salvation from the upper skies
Soared in silver steel
Gods of thunder raise in hell
Bloodstained to the core
An iron slicing claw of steel
A mighty thunder roar

Blaze in hell with tons of steel
Silver cycles roll the wheel

The stench of rubber cut the air
The grounds begin to shake
A glint of fire approaches in the dark
Dragonheart

Dragonheart, Dragonheart
