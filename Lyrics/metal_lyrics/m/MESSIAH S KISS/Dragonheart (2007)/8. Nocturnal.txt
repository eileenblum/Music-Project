The concrete still glows ashes burn in my eyes
Unyielding I follow the trace
Smoke veils the alley the black candle rise
When darkness is taking the place

Beware of the light in merge with the shade
The nightfall addicted abandoned the stroke of my fate
Nocturnal

Rush the predator into the dawn
Detesting the glare of the sun
Adoring the blackness, obey to the bane
Stop 'til the mission is done yeah

Beware of the darkness in merge with the shade
Nightfall addicted abandoned to the stroke of my fate
Nocturnal

Nocturnal, nocturnal

Beware of the light in merge with the shade
Nightfall addicted abandoned to the stroke of my fate

Beware of the light in merge with the shade
The nightfall addicted abandoned the stroke of my fate
Nocturnal, nocturnal
