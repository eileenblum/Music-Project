You came in the night, a light in the dark
Shining so bright as the morning sun
The pride in your eyes burning like fire
In the moonlighted skies

Wipe away your tears, tear off the clouds
The horizons will bring new tomorrow
Tears of destiny cryin' endlessly
The clouds disappear in the sky

On wings we ride, black tears we have cried
When the clouds disappear in the sky
Like an eagle you're ready to fly
On the ivory gates
Oh the ivory gates

You came in the night, a light in the dark
Shining so bright as the morning sun
The pride in your eyes burning like fire
In the moonlighted skies

Wipe away your tears, tear off the clouds
The horizons will bring new tomorrow
Tears of destiny cryin' endlessly
The clouds disappear in the sky

On wings we ride, black tears we have cried
When the clouds disappear in the sky
Like an eagle you're ready to fly
On the ivory gates
The ivory gates, oh yeah

When the day turns to night, the secrets revealed
Cries of your soul in the pouring rain
Are torn into pieces, fade into black
Since you are gone in the shade

Wipe away your tears, tear off the clouds
The horizons will bring new tomorrow
Tears of destiny cryin' endlessly
The clouds disappear in the sky

On wings we ride, black tears we have cried
When the clouds disappear in the sky
Like an eagle we're ready to fly
On the ivory gates

Fallen tears merged with blood
Mercyless asperity by the hands of god
Careless whisper, dreams fulfilled
Darkness calls, your life, your blood is spilled

Close to the edge
When your life's across the line
A sacred ride alone
To where the stars won't shine

The times we shared
So far and now so cold
The chapters written now
So deep inside my soul

On wings we ride, black tears
we have cried
When the clouds disappear in the sky
Like an eagle you're ready to fly
On the ivory gates
The ivory gates

Oh, on wings we ride, black tears
we have cried
When the clouds disappear in the sky
Like an eagle we're ready to fly
On the ivory gates
The ivory gates
