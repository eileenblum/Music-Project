I am the one to blaze in the sky
Fearless l shattered the dawn
Caught in the crossfire, faceless, unknown
Awaited salvation to call

The seal has been broken when destiny calls
God of salvation arise
Bury my soul on altars of pain
Show me the way to eternal skies

Wide fire's kissin' the sun
Pounding the world for all eternity
Black clouds cover the sky escorting your ride
To the land of the ancient cries

I am the son of pleasure and pain
Rulers of darkness and light
Magic and wisdom, thunder and rain
Welcome this magical night

The seal has been broken when destiny calls
God of salvation arise
Bury my soul on altars of pain
Show me the way to eternal skies

Wide fire's kissin' the sun
Pounding the world for all eternity
Black clouds cover the sky escorting your ride
To the land of the ancient cries

Wide fire's kissin' the sun
Pounding the world for all eternity
Black clouds cover the sky escorting your ride
To the land of the ancient cries

Wide fire's kissin' the sun
Pounding the world for all eternity
Black clouds cover the sky escorting your ride
To the land of the ancient cries

To the land of the ancient
To the land of the ancient cries
