Uugh

Can you hear me breathing
My body's aching hard
Standing in the fireline
Would you tear my soul apart, oh

No one deals with losers
Standing in the rain
On an iron curse of victory
To the saviors of the game

Can you feel it pounding
Or you make a stand
Spread the message all around
Like a virus overland

As a creeping monster
Raves along in rage
From the metal core of hell arise
To the center of the stage

We're fast, we're loud, we're furious
On the way to the promised land
Heads held high and never fall
United we stand
Raise your hands up towards the sky
See the guiding light
Possessed by evil thunders of the night

Can you feel your heart beat
Pumpin' more and more
Your blood begins to boil
Like it never did before

It's a trip to nowhere
Banners wave unfurled
By the iron claws of destiny
To the metal rules the world

We're fast, we're loud, we're furious
On the way to the promised land
Heads held high and never fall
United we stand
Raise your hands up towards the sky
See the guiding light
Possessed by evil thunders of the night

We're fast, we're loud, we're furious
On the way to the promised land
Heads held high and never fall
United we stand
Raise your hands up towards the sky
See the guiding light
Possessed by evil thunders of the night

Uugh, uugh
