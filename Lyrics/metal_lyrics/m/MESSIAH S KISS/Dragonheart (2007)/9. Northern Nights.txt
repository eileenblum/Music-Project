Centuries ago in the land of crimson skies
In a shadowworld of ice and snow
Majestically and mighty the fleet lies to engage
Dying for their reign of crimson skies

Lying in the calm before the storm
Cold winds rule the night
On wings of destiny we ride the open seas

Cold northern nights
Cold northern nights
Set the sail from distant shores across the sea

Armed the longboats lying in the silence of the dawn
To the mighty wind they set their sails
The spirits of the brave will lead us through the storm
Like a guiding light in the morning haze

Lying in the calm before the storm
Cold winds rule the night
On wings of destiny we ride the open sea

Cold northern nights
Cold northern nights
Set the sail from distant shores across the sea

Lying in the calm before the storm
Cold winds rule the night
On wings of destiny we ride the open sea

Cold northern nights
Cold northern nights
Set the sail from distant shores across the sea, yeah

Cold northern nights
Cold northern nights
Set the sail from distant shores across the sea, yeah
