I'm much too fast for your tired world
I need some rapid action
In the dead of night
Oh it feels so right

Trapped inside your boring hell
I'll cut the leash of security
Oh it feels so free

Made of steel
Power's all you feel
Got it all
I'm gonna wake the dead
Out to kill
Gonna break my will
I got you in my crossfires

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon open fire
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon it takes me higher
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon open fire
Time after time you'll be mine

My heart beats like a giant drum
When I blaze a trail
Don't call for sanity
I'm full of energy

You might say I'm a maniac
When I bang on your door
Don't ask for charity
For my gun and me

Made of steel
Power's all you feel
Got it all
I'm gonna wake the dead
Out to kill
Gonna break your will
I got you in my crossfires

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon open fire
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon it takes me higher
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon open fire
Time after time you'll be mine

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon open fire
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon it takes me higher
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon open fire
Time after time you'll be mine

Aim the target, alright
