Beyond the horizons
They're coming with honor and pride
Crossing the land on fiery desert sand
The strong and the brave by my side

From eternal skies where they came
The troopers appear in the darkness
The fires of vengeance enlighten the sky

Burning gates of Babylon
The writing appeared on the palace's wall

They came in the darkness
To conquer the center of might
Royal troopers led by the wind
Gonna raid your guardians tonight

From eternal skies where they came
The troopers appear in the darkness
The fires of vengeance enlighten the sky

Burning gates Of Babylon
The writing appeared on the palace's wall

From eternal skies where they came
The troopers appear in the darkness
The fires of vengeance enlighten the sky

Burning gates of Babylon
The writing appealed on the palace's wall

Burning gates of Babylon
The writing appealed on the palace's wall

The burning gates, oh, the burning gates
Oh, I got now my reason to conquer you, oh
