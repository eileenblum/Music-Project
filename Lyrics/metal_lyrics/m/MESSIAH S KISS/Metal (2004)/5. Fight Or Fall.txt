A creak in the silence
They open the door
Dead bodies all over the floor

A groan caused by torture
Kicked into the cell
Been kissed by the hot breath of hell

Just like the night before
You watch me wreck the place
Under the tears of rage

Fight or fall
Take hold on the will to survive
Fight or fall
Abasement cuts deep like a knife
Fight or fall

My heart turned to stone
But you won't break my will
Torment with the license to kill

The cry of my fellows
Still ring in my ear
You brought us repression and fear

Just like the night before
You watch me wreck the place
Under the tears of rage

Fight or fall
Take hold on the will to survive
Fight or fall
Abasement cuts deep like a knife
Fight or fall
