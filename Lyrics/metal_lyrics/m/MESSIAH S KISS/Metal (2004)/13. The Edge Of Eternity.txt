he rain came down in a fury night
And darkness filled the sky
The clouds turned into a distant roar
When the mighty thunder arise

In a burst of fire which shaking the earth
Rocks been ground to dust
Mortal fires endlessly
'til the last of the living is lost

Born to die for your hopes and dreams
Ride on the fates own blade
With the blood on your hands
Bodies lie where anywhere

Ride the wind, follow the sun
Led by the stars 'til the battle is won
Where the eyes learn to see
On the sedge of eternity

Across the fields, onward they go
Thunder above and fires below
Where the ancient gods kneel is the end
On the edge of eternity

Beyond the stars they're waiting
Mercenaries of hell
Eyes are open wide as he cast final spell
Go down

The gods of hades callin'
The prophecy's fulfilled
Now entering the reign of doom
Where lives and blood are spilled
Go down

The mortal hands of destiny
Are reaching for the skies
In death defying energy
For vengeance as he cries

On the edge of eternity, hold on
On the edge of eternity, hold on
On the edge of eternity, hold on
On the edge of eternity

Horizon's open wide now
You hear the eagle's cry
The scream for shelter fades away
Amidst the darkened sky

Born to die for your hopes and dreams
Ride on the fates own blade
With the blood on your hands
Bodies lie where anywhere
