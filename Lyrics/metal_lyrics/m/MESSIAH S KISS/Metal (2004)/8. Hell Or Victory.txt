I was the king of the land and the sea
The keeper of justice and humanity
Ease your sorrow, take away your sins

On next virgin eve when the full moon appears
A shape of the bad sent us blackness and fears
Red rains falling, shivers on your skin

Running on for shelter
You back's against the wall
Better stay awake tonight
To resist the nightmare's call

When the seed of the unholy grain
Rises high from the blood in the rain
Send my troops at night for the final fight
Hell or victory

Invaders encircled the kingdom at night
The mistress of the darkness has taken the light
Scream for murder lashes in the still

The empire's burning in loss of the reign
While death and destruction keeps feeding the flame
Tangled in the web of hate and kill

Running on for shelter
You back's against the wall
Better stay awake tonight
To resist the nightmare's call

When the seed of the unholy grain
Rises high from the blood in the rain
Send my troops at night for the final fight
Hell or victory
