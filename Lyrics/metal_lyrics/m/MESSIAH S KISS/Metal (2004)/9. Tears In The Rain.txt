Honesty
Is the key to harmony
Hold my soul
Faithfully

Ride with me
The winds of change
Touch my heart
To keep the strength in me

Hear the voice
Calling deep inside your dream
That true believe
Will tear your pain apart

Hear the angel
Whisper in the wind
That your scars will heal
If you hold on to your love

Close your eyes
And drift away
On the wings if destiny
Take my hand
And trust your heart
I'm the one who sees
Your tears in the rain

A virgin look
So innocent and clear
My silent embrace
Will take away your fear

The light of joy
And the stars in the skies
Reflect in your glance
Like a treasure in your eyes

See the light upon the mountain
While the sun shines in the sea
When the hope returns in glory
This life belongs to you an me
