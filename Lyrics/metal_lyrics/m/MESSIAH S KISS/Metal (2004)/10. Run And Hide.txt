Like a desert caught in ice
The mind was chained and trapped in lies
Fought it back, and killed the beast inside

Run away from a dead-end dream
Been pulled down by a roaring stream
But we're back for the attack, we got the target in sight

Wild and fury
Avengers on crusade
Penetrate the time and space
We're the envoy renegades

Oh oh oh oh
Rapid lightning
A storm patrol on fire
We'll get ya at the speed of light
Better run and hide

Sirens howling, smoke arise
When the crush the present line
We're on the way to change the course of time

Right into a century
Where the pins of misery
Rust away from the blood of the unholy crime

Wild and fury
Avengers on crusade
Penetrate the time and space
We're the envoy renegades

Oh oh oh oh
Rapid lightning
A storm patrol on fire
We'll get ya at the speed of light

Oh oh oh oh
Rapid lightning
A storm patrol on fire
We'll get ya at the speed of light
Better run and hide
