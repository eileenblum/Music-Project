We are the breed made of anger and ache
Victims of wars and denial
Addicted to pleasure
Attracted to pain
Traced in the dead of night

The echo of vengeance has shattered the dawn
The seed of salvation arise
Unholy guardians profane the graves
Betrayed and mortified

At random you kill and condemn
You've taken my brother, and my only friend
You tried to bury my heart maybe a little to late

Unchain the untaimed
Now you've got to face walls of hatred and scorn
Uncaging rebellion is born in the eye of the storm

Void of obedience, united we stand
On wings of freedom we ride
Pariahs and slave
The strong and the braves
It's time to do or die

At random you kill and condemn
You've taken my brother, and my only friend
You tried to bury my heart maybe a little to late

Unchain the untaimed
Now you've got to face walls of hatred and scorn
Uncaging rebellion is born in the eye of the storm
