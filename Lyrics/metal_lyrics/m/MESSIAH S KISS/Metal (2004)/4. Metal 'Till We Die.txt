We are the underground
Hellraised and metalbound
We don't deny the early roots

And all true metalheads
Don't care about directive trends
We rock and all hells breaking loose

Leather rebels ride in wind and rain
No one dares to stop us now
Metal still remains

Burn the stages
Crack the sky
Raging thunderball
Metal 'til we die
Rolling thunder
Inflame the sky
Raging wall of fire
Metal, metal 'til we die

Sonic cops of noise control
Say it ain't original
We keep our style, don't give a damn

Headbangers of the world
Raise your hands and spread the word
We ain't dead, we're back on the road again

Leather rebels turn the iron wheel
We all came together now
To forge the steel

Burn the stages
Crack the sky
Raging thunderball
Metal 'til we die
Rolling thunder
Inflame the sky
Raging wall of fire
Metal, metal 'til we die
