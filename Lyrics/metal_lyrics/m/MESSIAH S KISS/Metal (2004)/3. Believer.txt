Striving for a new sensation
As you switch the sides
And blast away your dreams

Lost my faith in brotherhood
Decide to run away
Got no dignity
They call and you obey

You get lost between the lines
When the mirror unveil the lies
Take a look at the cracks of fate
And tell me what you see

Unsaint believer
All hail deceiver

Blinded by a delusion
You keep running on
Into the human dirt

Longing for the praise of hell
Serve the snake of fraud
Raise her flag
And feed the evil to the crowd

You get lost between the lines
When the mirror unveil the lies
Take a look at the cracks of fate
And tell me what you see

Unsaint believer
All hail deceiver
