It's another silent day
The sun is streaming through the grey
I feel alive and well
And I'm back where I belong

My soul and heart were crucified
Raging battles I survived
Now alliance of new peace
Comes up strong

The journey leads straight into light
When the dawn hits the horizon
Walk on through majestic gates
For another hundred days

Angels of eternity
And the sentinels of creed
Even the way to safe a new world
On the fields we had to bleed
Angels of eternity

Slain your last men in the fights
Freedom rises in delight
Soldiers of salvation died for liberty

The smell of death has fade away
God of fortune, truth and fate
The ray of light and life is here to stay

The journey leads straight into light
When the dawn hits the horizon
Walk on through majestic gates
For another hundred days

Angels of eternity
And the sentinels of creed
Even the way to safe a new world
On the fields we had to bleed
Angels of eternity

The smell of death has fade away
God of fortune, truth and fate
The ray of light and life is here to stay
