Growing from the fields of fire
Crawling in the mud of lies
Faceless and forlorn they'll stab the eye

See the grain of pain and sorrow
Rising in their feeble minds
Closer to the edge they'll burn the sky

It's coming home
It's coming home

Darkness won't illuminate
If you close your eyes
Step outside the shadow
And getting' your gun, getting' your gun, getting your
Drown in holy waters
Make sure you don't taste your blood
'til the evil turns the night
To a nightmare you can't hide

Seed of anger rise
Your hopes and fears
United by the sea of holy waters

Suffering, pain and purgatory
Hell awaits with mighty hands
Grab inside the wound that cannot heal

Where the mankind stays indifferent
Stained with blood of those who cared
Blinded by their fate they make us kneel

It's coming home
It's coming home
It's coming home
It's coming home
