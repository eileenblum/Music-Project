Creeping like a tiger on the raid
Rushing in a firestorm, ablazed accelerate
Blinding furies puzzling mystery
Riding on a thunderbolts electric energy

Do you turn on the action
When your hearts beating loud
It's a magic attraction
When the lights going down

Hard as a rock
In the name of glory
Under the sign of victory
Hard as a rock
In the name of glory
Ride on the road to exxtasy

Eyes of fire fixed upon the track
Blasting like a hurricane's
Amazing hell attack
Lightning strikers flashing on the wheels
Thunder-crashing animals
In monsterwrap of steel

Do you turn on the action
When your hearts beating loud
It's a magic attraction
When the lights going down

Hard as a rock
In the name of glory
Under the sign of victory
Hard as a rock
In the name of glory
Ride on the road to exxtasy
