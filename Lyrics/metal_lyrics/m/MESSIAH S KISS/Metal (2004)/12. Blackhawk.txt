In the silence of the dawn
Hear the distant call across the field
In the land of the free

Cries for freedom
From the open sky
Where the eagles cry
'til the white man came
And wars spilled out blood and lives

We're born in the sun
We'll die in the wind
Crossing the path where the eagles cry
To the elder who's fighting alone

Blackhawk scream at night
Blackhawk scream at night

Chained and bonded
On the trail of tears
Carry endless fears
'til the night of shame
Where hordes killed our sons and wives

We're born in the sun
We'll die in the wind
Crossing the path where the eagles cry
To the elder who's fighting alone

Blackhawk scream at night
Blackhawk scream at night

Let the stars guide your way through life
Eternity, immortality
In the Eden you'll get your place on earth
Here, where all life dies
