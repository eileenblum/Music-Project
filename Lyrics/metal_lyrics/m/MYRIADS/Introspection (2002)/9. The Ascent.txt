[Music: Alexander Twiss, Mona Undheim Skottene, J.P. and Rudi Junger,  Lyrics: Mona Undheim Skottene and Alexander Twiss]

I am rising over the raindrops,
on the roof of glimmering rivers
Dancing softly to burn all the sorrows,
on the clouds where starlight always shines

I am rising over the raindrops,
on the roof of glimmering rivers
Dancing softly to burn all the sorrows,
on the clouds where sun always shines
