[Music: Myriads, Lyrics: Alexander Twiss and Mona Undheim Skottene]

Frames of truth,
I can see the falseness lying in thee,
fills me with confusion and distrust
Innocence,
I can see the wildness figured in thee,
reject the pose of injured chastity
Quietness,
I can feel the energies emission,
precluding a stagnation of time

Justify the truth which keeps my feet on the ground
I am hidden in a veil of distrust and speculation
With my own eyes I see through falseness and betrayal,
with my own eyes

[Chorus]

There are no extremities around you
Everything is influenced by an opposite
There are no purities and perfectibilities
There are no words of admonition

You are imposing your thoughts on others,
excluding their help and ideas without reflection
You will be confined,
your reality is overthrown 
Purity within my innocent presence
I strive to live in virtuousness and reject indolence and delusion
Without wildness I live in perfect harmony,
without wildness

[Chorus]

Who are you to impose your thoughts and conceptions on others?
You exist in false dreams and lies without veracity
Predilection for yourself and your derelict ideas
Deepened in your depraved world within your mind

Do you really trust yourself, omniscient,
pure and unaffected, following your own axioms?

One can imagine the pure ideas of all states,
but they do not really exist uninfluenced

In silence the falling snow fortifies my feelings
In solitude I am comfortable without energies around me
Drifting into a timeless world without limitations,
a timeless world

[Chorus]

I am on the dark side of the earth in perpetual night
I am all alone with my shadow following my eyes
I am longing for the sun touching my callous coldness
Lost connection with ground, feeling a stagnation of time

Like the mirror of water reflecting his shadow in his eyes,
painted on the waves when they rise
Looks for a place for landing, there is no place to settle down
Fly into the clouds higher above

I am on the dark side of the earth in perpetual night
I am all alone with my shadow following my eyes
I am longing for the sun touching my callous coldness
Lost connection with ground, feeling a stagnation of time

Flying higher in my wildness,
far away from this place
My thoughts are flickering in a maze
Of wisdom and insanity

Flying higher in his wildness,
far away from this place
His thoughts are flickering in a maze
of wisdom and insanity
