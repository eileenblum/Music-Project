[Music and Lyrics: Alexander Twiss and Mona Undheim Skottene]

As I look inside my self,
I long to find a way
I close my eyes;
still images are streaming
To disclose the core of my self,
I long to find a way
I close my mind
but still the thoughts are floating

Inside of me
I listen to a silent sound
behind my memories
I am striving to see inside of me
To solve my bewilderment
and let it flow like energy
Revealing my personality

The path to my thoughts and my soul
This maze is leading me
Inside of me
I am yearning to perceive myself

I am embraced
with my own intelligence
That obstructs me
From finding the sanctum
