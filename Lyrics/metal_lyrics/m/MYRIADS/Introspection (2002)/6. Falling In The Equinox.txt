[Music and Lyrics: Alexander Twiss and Mona Undheim Skottene]

Lunar baby
Glooming shadows
cover you softly where you rest
on the mossy ground

Bathing in dew you dwell
Do not fear, the sparrows
will guard your nest

Until October storms arise
In autumnal equinox,
maple leaves are falling
and caress your body

In the deepest forest you lie,
pale and alone
Leaves conceal your skin,
even your bright eyes are hidden

Sparrows cannot see you now
You do not manage on your own,
and soon the frost will
penetrate your tender body

Snow is falling in winter
Flakes of crystal snow
land on your sweet brow
A star has fallen
