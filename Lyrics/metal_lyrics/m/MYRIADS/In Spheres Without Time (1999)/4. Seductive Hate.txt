In aeons of time we travel afar
Through shields of misery, undying journey

[Chorus:]
I will rise above you
From o'er, I see you in the valleys
being wasted, weak and miserable
My spirit forever high
I always will be the invincible
My hate is stronger than yours
Hate rising like wings from a raven
being darkest in the night; I am shimmering,
But still I need you
But you will always be near me

The cosmic storms are everlasting
Explosive chemistry between you and me

[Chorus]

The strongest feelings of man makes us slaves of each other
We seek, we find, we love, we HATE

Cold bloody people, seem to be
Face firmly stuck, cannot be torn free
Sorrows too dark for the day to see
Bound by seduction - immortal greed

The pale-faced moon looking coldly at the earth,
her gaze reflected from a superior force
To dreamers of the night she brings magical signs,
she reveals the truth: the fear of mine
Rays from above cover my anger,
like dark shadows from my own betrayal
My deepest wounds of hidden pain,
shreds my thoughts and rapes my brain

In our grandiose flight, thoughts collide and die
We collapse in hate, our dishearted pride

I will rise up to you
I am coming to meet you in the valleys
when you are wasted, weak and miserable
But my spirit is too weak to fight
I always will be the invincible
My hate is bleached by yours
Hate dawning like wings from a raven
being darkest in the night, I am shimmering
I truly need you
And you will always be near me
