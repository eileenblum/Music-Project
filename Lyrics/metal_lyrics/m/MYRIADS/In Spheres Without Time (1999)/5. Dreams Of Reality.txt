My impressions, my memories,
like a spirit's biology
Feeling the silent breeze through the branches,
caressing my dreams peacefully in harmony
Sensitive signs entangle my mind

[Chorus:]
An alien activity
Myriads of atoms converging to cells
creating my memories,
this cosmos of chaos in me

My inner slumber, streams of reflections,
veils of impressions, misty diffusion
Transparent visions, the center of me

[Chorus:]
The alien activity
Myriads of atoms converging to cells
creating my memories,
this cosmos of chaos in me

The freezing winds in your mind
stir up your sense of time
Like the dark quakes from below
ruin your self-control

Whisperings from me
shimmering, I am like an asp-tree
shaking in the wind
which carry my leaves

Your reality is shaped by your dreams
What is confusing me? I am losing control
Awakened surreality affects your fantasy
I am awake with my fantasies
Entwine in unity, strengthening your belief
Far away from nature's true activities
All-embracing chemistry
I have dreams of reality

River of visions hidden by my body,
opens this flowing, unlimited dimension of mine
Reality of memories

[Chorus:]
This alien activity
Myriads of atoms converging to cells
creating my memories,
this cosmos of chaos in me

This unknown activity of yours
Consists of atoms converging to cells
They create your memories
They build a chaos of cosmos in you
