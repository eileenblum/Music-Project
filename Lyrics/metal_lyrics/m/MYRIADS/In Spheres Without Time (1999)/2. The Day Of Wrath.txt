Like shadows we fall into the great beyond
Lost in the veil of time, souls to become
darkness in light
Floating in a whirl of tears, dark wounds of evil betrayal
Dolo malo

[Chorus:]
Sinking rapidly into eternity
Callous hostility
Driven to insanity

We see the stars beyond, rising amongst the heavens
Utterings from thunderous voices sounding like a symphony
Entwined with roaring screams from the realms of hades
De profundis

[Chorus]

To be like the angels,
we are crying higher in despair, falling down from heavens,
hades raging voices do remind of the darkest evil fire

Flames from the eternal depths mounting high above us
reaching up infinitely high, boundaries devoured
Smoke of sulphur in the sky darkening the gospel
Dies irae

Under the dark skies in the flames
On the darkest day lit up by fire
Gathering of warriors, not the mortal kind
Prepared to fight in the great battle

Hail and fire mixed with blood overwhelm
the shattered earth
Agonizing screams of man longing for the
everlasting death
There is no more time for dying, mortal souls
condemned forever
In acternum

[Chorus]

Deepest in the great beyond, hidden by the dust of ashes
Hunting in the gloomiest dawn, to be kissed
by tongues of fire

Feel the brutal kiss of death as they all collide in anger
Hosts of spirits fight against hierarchies of fallen angels
Come with me and you will see
We are all doomed, without sympathy
Listen to the endless screams coming from unfearful minds
In this emptiness they fly, judged to perdition forever
Our lost fate, we are truly forlorn
as we fall into eternity
