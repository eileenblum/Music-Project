Rays of light streaming in over me,
(Shadows covering me)
coldness is gripping me and my soul,
(far beyond where no one can be)
tears apart images of life
(That way - far away)
Will I travel beyond the astral light?
(dead pulses in loneliness)
(Silent sleeping)

[Chorus:]
From the inner sanctum of our souls
Silence tears apart what is to come
Frozen images set in stone
Deceit of the realm which we know
Halls of sorrow, pity and grief
Mourning alone and beyond belief
Cold grasps tightens around our necks
Death rises, fulfills our lust for peace

Through the mist striving to
(My restless mind)
keep the mind clear from scars,
(rumbling like fallen stones)
overwhelmed by nature's true reality,
(From wild to paralysed,)
lays waste my own integrity; disillusioned
(I am touching my buried emotions)
(coldly and mistily)

[Chorus]

Sinking into darkness,
(I am in an air of mystery)
hidden illusions of death and what is hereafter..
(Aims of death fulfill entirely)
Our consciousness melts into ourselves

Colossal wind and rain fortifies
(Rays of frozen light)
my own senses, visualize what is within,
(fossilize my curious mind,)
striving to know the incomprehensible
(Evince what is within)
Moulding a true belief
(Dead pulses in loneliness)
(unveiling the secrets)

[Chorus]

Fulfills our lust for peace
