Your God prays himself in paradise.
He needs someone to care.
We're northern warriors, think twice
Before you'll try to dare.

Churches burn... Run away,
If you want to survive.
Feed your fear... Short delay
You will not save your life.

Valhalla calls, our fathers wait.
We are not scared to die.
We'll come and break another gate
Where enter is denied.

Axe and mace! Shield and sword
We've come to take your brave .
Choose with sense your last word.
Watch things that you can't save.

We've come from northern distant lands
We've come to die with fight.
Our destiny is in our hands
We are the northern pride!

Shake of fear! Dread of blood!
That is your only way.
You are slave of your fake god
That filled you with the blame.
