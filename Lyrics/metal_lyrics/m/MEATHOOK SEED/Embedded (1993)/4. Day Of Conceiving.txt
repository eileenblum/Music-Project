Eroticism churns the seed,
An attempt to satisfy our lustrous mentality,
With intent to bear life,
magnetism in it's purest form.
I crave the arousing scent,
A tickling sensation controls my brain,
My attempt to share with you,
what is rightfully ours.

Day of Concieving
Day of Concieving
Day of Concieving.
I, I, I....
Day of Concieving
Day of Concieving
Day of Concieving
Day of Concieving.
An animalistic sensuality,
That backbone in the gift of life,
well disguised by all humanity,
a tetanus seed released
Day of Concieving
Day of Concieving
Day of Concieving
Day of Concieving.
I, I, I....
Day of Concieving
Day of Concieving
Day of Concieving
Day of Concieving.
Life, life, life....
