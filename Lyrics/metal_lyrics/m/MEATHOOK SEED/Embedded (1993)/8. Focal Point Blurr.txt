Sunken eyes,
visually submerged,
my disillusion well defined.
perception unclear,
I still gaze,
Things are not what they seem.
Dream, blind, deaf, dumb,
Dream, blind, deaf, dumb,
Dream, blind, deaf, dumb,
Dream, blind, deaf, dumb,
Deception ordered,
obvious unveiled,
strip the mask,
face the front,
Integrity is gone it it's entirety.
Things are not what they seem.
Things are not what they seem.
Things are not what they seem.
Things are not what they seem.
A one dimensional conceptual blur
A reflection of my personality?
still water runs deep - still water runs deep.
Dream, blind, deaf, dumb,
Dream, blind, deaf, dumb,
Dream, blind, deaf, dumb,
Dream, blind, deaf, dumb,
I feel the need to clarify
what is threatening my perspectives
Final whim of confidence,
undo the damage I subjected.
Things are what they seem.
Things are what they seem.
Things are what they seem.
Things are what they seem.
Obstacles in sight,
Things that I neglect,
things that I detest,
stumble into darkness,
my world crumbles,
everything falls into place.
Everything falls into place.
