You radiate cold shafts of broken glass,
Through my last bit of affection,
my sentimental values crushed,
I tried so hard,
but you tighten the noose,
there is no truth.
there is no truth.
there is no truth.
there is no truth.
I left myself at your disposal and what did you do?
what did you fucking do?
you slit the throat of the thing I once adored,
the thing I now despise.
look what you fucking did!
look what you fucking did!
look what you fucking did!
look what you fucking did!
Forgiven....
You called a truce,
I took no notice,
I can only feel that trouble lies ahead.
There is no truth,
There is no truth,
There is no truth,
There is no truth,
a vague uncertainty
Resist the temptation,
Revenge my main concern
Forgiven but not forgotten,
look what you fucking did!
look what you fucking did!
look what you fucking did!
look what you fucking did!
Forgiven....
