Starring at the white ceiling.
Being thrown back into the end of days.
The gentle men will take revenge!

Trying to cut the scum off this world.
The sober blade- lunatic's fate.
This will to cleanse can't be ignored!

Waste away with poisoned veins.
Senses fade and the hate awakes!
Love kills in persistence!

Barely remembering these winter days.
But the nights I left without a trace.
"Catch me when you can!"

THIS SHINING BLADE - NO MORE - IMPURITY!
THIS IS MY FATE - THIS IS - MY DESTINY!
FROM HELL!
WITHOUT A FACE!

Deep wounds cut in delusion.
Warm blood over cold hands.
"My Heart is colder still!"

Disappointment and disillusion.
Mutilation as the one relief.
And cries remain unheard!

Am I victim or the cruel offender?
Do you feel remorse or just contempt?
Does anybody understand?

I looked them in the frightened eyes.
I felt the death of their final breath.
Mary Jane! Take me away!

THIS SHINING BLADE - NO MORE - IMPURITY!
THIS IS MY FATE - THIS IS - MY DESTINY!
FROM HELL!
WITHOUT A FACE!

Fear I'm spreading with my instruments.
Ripped apart and left wide open...

THIS SHINING BLADE - NO MORE - IMPURITY!
THIS IS MY FATE - THIS IS - MY DESTINY!
FROM HELL!
WITHOUT A FACE!

THIS SHINING BLADE - NO MORE - IMPURITY!
THIS IS MY FATE - THIS IS - MY DESTINY!
