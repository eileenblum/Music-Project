Just Take a look at the blade in your hand.
It's all been said before, slit and free your soul:

SUFFOCATING IN AGONY- OVERWHELMED BY EXISTENCE.
NOTHING MORE TO GAIN- AT THE GATES OF DEMISE.

Face all your fears as pain strikes you down.
In the mist of your demise, searching for the truth...

As you bleed- your life ends!
As you suffer- no more hope!
As you ache- for a lifetime!
In this world- with no way out!

Lead this razor to your wrist, forget your doubts.
Just close your eyes and fail again...

SUFFOCATING IN AGONY- OVERWHELMED BY EXISTENCE.
NOTHING MORE TO GAIN- AT THE GATES OF DEMISE.

BROKEN! SHATTERED! SCARRED! 

Lead this razor to your wrist, forget your doubts
Just close your eyes and fail again...
BROKEN! SHATTERED! SCARRED!
