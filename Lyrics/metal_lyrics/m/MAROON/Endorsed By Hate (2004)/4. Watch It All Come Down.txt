I wanna watch it all come down.
Fade away, burn inside.
All your dreams turn to dust.
I wanna watch it all come down.

BURNING - THIS LIFE IS OVER.
CUTTING - THIS LIFE AWAY.
NOTHING WILL REMAIN.
WE ARE DEAD!

I don't have the will to go on.
I want to die, tonight inside.
World of misery, buried alive.
I wanna watch it all come down.

DRINKING - YOUR OWN BLOOD.
WAITING - FOR THE DAY.
BURIED BY YOUR LIES.
WE ARE SICK!

I wanna watch it all come down.
No will to go on.
This is our vengeance.
Green blood!

Die like the innocent victims.
Die! Buried alive!
