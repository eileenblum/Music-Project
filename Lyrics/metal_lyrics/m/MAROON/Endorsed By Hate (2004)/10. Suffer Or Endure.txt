Close your eyes and feel the touch of death.
The touch you need tonight.
I'm dreaming day by day.
And your blood runs...

Windows break, forget your fear tonight.
The fear you feel the most.
I'm dreaming day by day
And your blood runs... red!

No remorse, compassion is left behind.
Behind my hateful eyes.
I saw you day by day.
And I felt love...

In your room, feel my knife so cold.
The knife is made for you.
Now I see you night by night.
And you love me... too!

AND YOU LOVE ME TOO!

Close your eyes and feel the touch of death.
The touch you need tonight.
I'm dreaming day by day.
And your blood runs...

Windows break, forget your fear tonight.
The fear you feel the most.
I'm dreaming day by day
And your blood runs...

This dying world.
My darkest dreams.
This night burns.
Your soul is raped.
Your soul is raped.
Raped by evil.
Your soul is raped.
I am gone!

No remorse, compassion is left behind.
Behind my hateful eyes.
I saw you day by day.
And I felt love...

In your room, feel my knife so cold.
The knife is made for you.
Now I see you night by night.
And you love me... too!
