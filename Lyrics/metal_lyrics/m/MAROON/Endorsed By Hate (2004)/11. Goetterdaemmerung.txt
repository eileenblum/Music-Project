Turn off the city lights.
Paint the streets black.
This is the last day.
Of this civilization.

No more cries.
Of billion innocent victims.
No more devastation.
End it, end it now!

BURN SLOW!
DIE ALONE!
END IT, END IT NOW!
THIS IS THE END OF THIS WORLD!

Say goodbye to your wife.
And your fucking child.
This is the last day.
Of your wasted life!

No more bloody money,
For this legal murder.
Yes this is pain!
Yes this is pain!

BURN SLOW!
DIE ALONE!
BURN SLOW!
THIS IS THE END!
