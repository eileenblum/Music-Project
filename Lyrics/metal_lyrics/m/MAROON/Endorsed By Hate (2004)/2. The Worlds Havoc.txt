A black dust is falling down to earth.
Unknown diseases resist any cure.

THE END!
THE WORLD STOPS TURNING!

Pestilence the black medieval death.
Skinned alive by acid rain falling from the sky.

The final hours.
The sun burns with no regret.
The worlds havoc.
The black sky's falling down.

THE WORLD BURNS!
THIS IS THE END OF ALL THE THINGS!

Prophets speaking of judgment day.
The streets are filled with deformed human beings.
Earthquakes take away countless lives.
The great panic has come to take the rest.

The final hours.
The sun burns with no regret.
The worlds havoc.
The black sky is falling down.

THE END!
THE WORLD STOPS TURNING!
THE WORLD BURNS!
THIS IS THE END OF ALL THE THINGS!

THE END OF ALL THE THINGS!
