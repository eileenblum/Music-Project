Turned me into someone else.
Made me act against my own desire.
I won't forget the things I've seen.
Million cries made my ears bleed.

My soul was torn apart.
On the day that I was born.
Your actions fuel my anger.
I armed myself with hate.

ENDORSED BY HATE!

Blood drips - from your tongue!
Your ideals - my hate!
Blood drips from your tongue.
Your ideals my hate.
Just think of what you've done.
You've stolen my peacefulness away.

By your hands - they die!
Loved ones - forever lost!
By your hands they die.
Loved ones forever lost.
What have they done to you?
Hunger marks their final hour.

IT'S FUCKING HATE!

FEEL MY RAGE - ENDORSED BY HATE!
