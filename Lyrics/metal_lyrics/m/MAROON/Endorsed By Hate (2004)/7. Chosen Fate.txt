The walls are closing in.
There seems to be no exit.
Everything is falling apart.
But there's something deep inside.
That keeps you hanging on.

Lean on something!
More than ever I'm fucking proud. 
Of the things that make me strong.
Something to believe in.
Fuck the things they say!

I AM MY OWN FATE!

IN MY HEART!
IN MY SOUL!
CAN'T TAKE!
THIS AWAY!

This power from within.
Take away your fucking rules.
Define your own fucking destiny.

No matter what they say.
Can't take this away from me.
Can't take my soul away.

CAN'T TAKE THIS AWAY!
