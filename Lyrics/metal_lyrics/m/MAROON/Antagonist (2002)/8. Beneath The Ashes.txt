Beneath the ashes, I search for evidence.
I search for substance to prove existence.
Destroyed by the hands of man.
Something is lost forever... has died forever!

Our hands- are covered with blood.
Our behaviour- is driven by greed.
We will soon- fade to an memory.
Of a culture- ceased by ignorance.

SOMETHING'S LOST FOREVER!

Beneath the ashes, I search for evidence.
I search for substance to prove existence!

Mortality removed by technology.
Humanity killed by mankind.

Beneath the ashes, I lost the hope to find some prove.
Of a civilised culture cause something... has died forever!

SOMETHING'S LOST FOREVER!
