You think this isn't right.
You think you don't deserve this.
But you keep working on.
The beginning of the end.

What do you think?
How much pain can she take?
Before she's fighting back.
And takes all you love away.

YOU HURT, YOU KILL, AND NOW YOUR TIME RUNS OUT!
YOU RAPIST, YOU MURDERER, YOU FUCKING LIAR!
HER PAIN, HER CRIES, ALL THIS IS YOUR DEMISE!
YOU RAPIST, YOU MURDERER, YOU FUCKING LIAR!

EARTH STRIKES BACK!

You think this isn't right.
You think you don't deserve this.
But you keep working on.
The beginning of the end.

What do you think?
How much pain can she take?
Before she's fighting back.
And takes all you love away.

Do you really think you can rape our mother without punishment?
What goes around comes back around, no one is save in the end.

Your cries remain unheard.
there's no one left to listen.
They have been taken away.

The smell of human flesh.
It deafens all your senses.
This must be fucking hell.

YOU HURT, YOU KILL, AND NOW YOUR TIME RUNS OUT!
YOU RAPIST, YOU MURDERER, YOU FUCKING LIAR!

EARTH STRIKES BACK!
