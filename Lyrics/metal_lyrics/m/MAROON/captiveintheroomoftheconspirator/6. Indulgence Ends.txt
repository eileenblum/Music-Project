I can feel the pain of the innocent caught up in mass- enslavement.
Their cries of desperation Through their life of absolute darkness.
Victims of a species running into self destruction.
Because of ignorance, greed and lack of education.

The blood inside my veins is getting colder everyday.
Anger is building up inside!
I don't want to slip away into senseless hate.
But something must be done!

MY PATIENCE IS RUNNING OUT!

THIS IS A WAR!
