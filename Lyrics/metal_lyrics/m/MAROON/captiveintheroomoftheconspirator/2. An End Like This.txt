The seven symbols of the apocalypse.
Show the way on the bloody burning sky.
The last days of civilisation.
And the four riders coming down to earth and DESTROY:

Watch the murdered rise from the dead- dead.
And the punishment for the guilty is sure.

The melodies of the seven trumpets.
An infernal sound of suffering.
Rage and power of the enslaved.
United in the hordes of hate and revenge:

Demons of the final judgement burn landscapes to ashes.
Fragments of dead bodies laying in my hands.
And the blood flows from my face.
And the blood flows from my face
