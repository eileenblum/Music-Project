They climb around, do a somersault.
Jump over the bed, twenty fold on the table.
Now against the wall, bob up and down.
Make knee bends, drop into the sky.

STRIKE AND FORGET!

They jam their fingers in the window.
Crying, singing, curse, laughing, screaming, spit around.
Pull faces, sad, easily, frightened, cheerful, painful.
They live in a morbid dreamworld of...

CHAOS AND PAIN!

There are many vasomotoric symptoms.
Very complicated and that...
Day after day, year after year.
No end in sight and no return!
