You can't turn me into one of your lies.
You can't make me your slave.

Blind acceptance in this material world.
For money reasons you would burn your soul.
Values get lost in this age of competitive greed.
This killing machine, you keep it running well.

You are the toy, force fed with seeming joy.
Resignation as a result of reprisal.
Once offered resistance.
Now forced to relent.

I WON'T SUPPORT THIS DEGRADING CULTURE!
