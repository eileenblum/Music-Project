This is the next bloody axe in your face
This is the fight for the voiceless minority

NO LAST WARNING - NO WARNING SHOT
SMELL THE SCENT OF YOUR OWN BLOOD

[solo]

YES, IT'S YOUR FLESH IN YOUR MOUTH
YES, IT'S YOUR FLESH IN YOUR MOUTH

Welcome to your own slaughterhouse
It's time for work, you under your bloody axe
It's time for my revenge, can you feel the pain?

NO LAST WARNING - NO WARNING SHOT
SMELL THE SCENT OF YOUR OWN BLOOD
NOW I USE YOUR TECHNOLOGY
TO SHOW YOU HOW THEY DIE A BILLION TIMES EVERYDAY

Letâs âburn it downâ
And âdestroy the machinesâ
Hear the thousand screams
Hear the thousand screams

âHANDS OFF THE ANIMALS

And a âfirestormâ will come

[solo]

This is the next bloody axe in your face
This is the fight for the voiceless minority
Itâs time for my revenge, can you feel the pain?

NO LAST WARNING - NO WARNING SHOT
SMELL THE SCENT OF YOUR OWN BLOOD
YES, IT'S YOUR FLESH IN YOUR MOUTH
YES, IT'S YOUR FLESH IN YOUR MOUTH
