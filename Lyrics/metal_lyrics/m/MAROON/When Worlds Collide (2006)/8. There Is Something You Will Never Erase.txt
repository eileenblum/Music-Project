This fire still burns
A fire inside keeps me moving
It never dies
A feeling of hope from deep inside
A world gone mad
All hearts stoned to death
Wonât look away
Compassion shows intelligence
Killing and suffering
Humanity â the superior race
You refuse to hear
So I take their voice and make it sound
Heartless slaughter
Bloodbath of animals everyday
Innocent die
The guilty live on without remorse

THERE IS SOMETHING â¦ THIS IS EVERYTHING â¦
THERE IS SOMETHING â¦ YOU CANâT KILL!
THERE IS SOMETHING â¦ THIS IS EVERYTHING â¦
THERE IS SOMETHING â¦ YOU CANâT KILL! â¦
THERE IS SOMETHING â¦ THIS ONE THING â¦
YOU WILL â¦ NEVER ERASE!
THERE IS SOMETHING â¦ THIS IS EVERYTHING â¦
THERE IS SOMETHING â¦ YOU CANâT KILL!
THERE IS SOMETHING â¦ THIS ONE THING â¦
YOU WILL â¦ NEVER ERASE!

Human dirt
Vegetates at the expense of animals
Do you realise
The hell these creatures are going through
Use your voice and make it sound
Start to believe in yourself
Use your voice and make it â¦ sound!

THERE IS SOMETHING â¦ THIS IS EVERYTHING â¦
THERE IS SOMETHING â¦ YOU CANâT KILL!
THERE IS SOMETHING â¦ THIS ONE THING â¦
YOU WILL â¦ NEVER ERASE!
THERE IS SOMETHING â¦ THIS IS EVERYTHING â¦
THERE IS SOMETHING â¦ YOU CANâT KILL!
THERE IS SOMETHING â¦ THIS ONE THING â¦
YOU WILL â¦ NEVER ERASE!
