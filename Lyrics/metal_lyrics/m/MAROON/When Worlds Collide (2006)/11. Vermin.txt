Iâve died so many times â so many years ago
Can you feel my pain?
My body in pieces â my soul is dying
Nothing is forgiven, nothing
Iâm just a number â a virus
Nameless without any control
Iâm back in this life
Feels o bad again
Stop me, please make me stop it
The pain goes on
Again and again
I donât know what to do, please help
Donât follow me, Iâm dead anyway
Donât say goodbye, I was never here
Donât follow me, Iâm dead anyway
Donât say goodbye, I was never here
Iâm just a blank page
In the book of life
Iâm a liar, a liar, yes, Iâm you
Hatred all the time
A pervertâs fuck up
Please kill me Iâm stronger than before
Retarded, cold, end it all
Never needed here
Wasted time and wasted life
No hand in love
