In times
When worlds collide
My nails are in
Sopcietyâs flesh
And if I lose, welcome annihilation
In times
When worlds collide
I will be
The thorn in your side
I know it will be
Will be the hard way
As I stand
In the heart of the monster
If I lose, welcome annihilation

IN TIMES WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE
I WILL BE THE THORN IN YOUR SIDE
I CAN NEVER FIT AND I NEVER WILL
THIS IS ALL I HAVE â YOU WILL NEVER SEE
I CAN NEVER FIT AND I NEVER WILL
THIS IS ALL I HAVE â YOU WILL NEVER SEE

In times
When worlds collide
Hope is rare
Under a dying sun
I can never fit
And I never will
See me dance
At the funeral of your ideals
If I lose, welcome annihilation

AND IF I LOSE, WELCOME ANNIHILATION
AND IF I LOSE, WELCOME ANNIHILATION
