âSome find their death by sword and bullet, and some by fluids down the gullet.â
[Thomas Rowlandson 1816]

Open your eyes in an ice cold room
Wake up lifeless your body has been consumed
Body and soul have been separated
You pray to your god but demons is all that youâve created
All alone in your darkest hour
Laid out on your deathbed all life has been devoured
All you think of is one last day
Drugs wonât help you now to the heaves you pray
All your life has been wasted away
Your imploring wonât help you because itâs too late
Fuck your God, you are your own master
Only youâre to be blamed for a life long disaster

LIQUID CRAWLS DOWN YOUR THROAT
NOW YOU FEEL ALIVE!
SMOKE GNAWS ON YOUR LUNGS
NOW YOU FEEL ALIVE!

All alone in your darkest hour
Laid out on your deathbed all life has been devoured
All you think of is one last day
Drugs wonât help you now to the heavens you pray
Still youâre not afraid you still see hope
Drown your panic in fluids and kill your fear with dope
This useless heart barely beats in a chest
After a life of ignorance cancer is winning at last

LIKE SWORD AND BULLET â LIQUID STRIKES YOU DOWN
ACID AND POISON â FINALLY MADE YOU DROWN

Open your eyes in an ice cold room
Wake up lifeless now!
