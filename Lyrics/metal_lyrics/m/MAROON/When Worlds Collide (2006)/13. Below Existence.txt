The sirens spread their deadly sounds again
Time to face the artificial lights again
Those lights that shine down below
And have to bring life into this dreadful tomb
I sleep where rats use to die
I go on as death walks on by

BURIED ALIVE
OPEN THIS TOMB
BURIED ALIVE
CANâT STAND THIS GLOOM

The new day sends his signs again
Itâs time to face the real world again
Thereâs not much left of the things I knew
The world lies wasted after all Iâve been through
I dream beside bodies in decay
I go down below existence every single day
I walk where bullets fly
Never stop when I hear wounded cry
I stel to kill hunger and pain
All lies in ruins â get through â this is my only gain
My only gain
The sirens spread their deadly sounds again
Time to face the artificial lights again
Those lights that shine down below
And have to bring life into this dreadful tomb
I sleep where rats use to die
I go on as death walks on by

BURIED ALIVE
OPEN THIS TOMB
BURIED ALIVE
CANâT STAND THIS GLOOM
