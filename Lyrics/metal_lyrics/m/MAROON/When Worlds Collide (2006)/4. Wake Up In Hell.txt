Born â but never raised
Youâre not a human youâre just a product
Fearful eyes â see nothing but death
Mutated ears hear nothing but cries
No beautiful home â safe and warm
Live in a cage full of dirt and pain
Hateful faces â so very unknown
Speaking in tongues you canât understand

WAKE UP IN HELL
HELL
WAKE UP IN HELL
HELL
WAKE UP IN HELL
HELL
WAKE UP IN HELL
WAKE UP! Slaughter! â Hacked to pieces

See those of your kind getting mutilated
This must be hell â this canât be real
This fucking fear paralyses my thoughts
There is no space â you can not move
Youâre meat stock now, reversed tragedy
This isnât hell â itâs fucking real
Hell would be relief, no remorse in abattoirs
âOh where am I? Whatâs that Iâm going through?
Where is my family? Will I see the light again?
This canât be real. I am human not an animal
You canât tread me like this! Is there no compassion?â

[solo]

âSave me from my destiny. I canât stand this anymore!
I am human not an animal!
I am human
Human!

WAKE UP IN HELL
HELL
WAKE UP IN HELL
HELL
WAKE UP IN HELL
HELL
WAKE UP IN HELL
WAKE UP!
