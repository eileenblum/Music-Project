Forced into my own observations
Alone, bruised, with thoughts of revelation
Four walls becoming my new hemisphere
Encircled, caught, by visions yet unclear

No one will ever see
What I see
No one will ever reach
What I reach

Golden stars magnetized by contemplation
Refined, stable, in the age of my evasion
Follow me for I am driven by powers surreal
My sins are long forgiven

No one will ever see
What I see
No one will ever reach
What I reach

[Solo]

They've hunted me for fear of verity
Psychopath is how they call me

No one will ever see
What I see
No one will ever reach
What I reach
No one will ever know
What I know
No one will ever feel
What I feel

A NEW ORDER! [4x]
