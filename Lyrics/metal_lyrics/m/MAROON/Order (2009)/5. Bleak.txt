She sang as she dealt the blow and fell
And the telephone rang
As she wrote some words on a piece of paper
And jumped into the dark
To free himself

Don't save me!
Please set me free!
Release me!
From misery!

[Solo]

Hold your breath and close your eyes
They will never let you sleep at night

She slept as her soul left and no one realized
She was dead
He cried as he looked into her eyes and died
As she sang him
A lullaby

Don't save me!
Please set me free!
Don't save me!
Don't save me!
Release me!
From misery!
