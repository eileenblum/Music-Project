They are waiting at the end of the street
With all my mistakes, with all my lies

Call them into the fire and I can rise
To my throne of overassessment

BUT I PROMISE SOMETHING IS IN MY HEART!
BUT I PROMISE SOMETHING IS IN MY HEART!

Just another attempt to cover this broken life
The only person I fear is me
So I'm the one who can chance anything
This world is mine!
This world is mine!

Don't talk to me, it's my life and I'm the only king
Don't talk about me if your life is so meaningless

And your heart, without any power
All this is another attempt to cover a broken man

BUT I PROMISE SOMETHING IS IN MY HEART!
BUT I PROMISE SOMETHING IS IN MY HEART!
IN MY HEART! HEART!
