Embalm your fucking existence today
Allscruple ready to fade
Yes we will dance on the mountain of skulls
We will sing the songs in the forest so deep

The Ghost, an epilogue errect
Too close to touch, touching from a distance

My bed is build on stones tonight
Tomorrow, soil of grief, recalling today

Oh sweet darkness, sacred light
Salvation! Salvation!
Please harvest the will! [3x]

Oh sweet darkness, sacred light
Salvation! Salvation!

[Solo]

See me under an open field tonight
My blood leads me to find the left hand path
Why salvation for this bitter life?
All the holiness, just one more fix of hate

HAIL! HAIL! HAIL!

Oh sweet darkness, sacred light
Salvation! Salvation!
Please harvest the will! [4x]
