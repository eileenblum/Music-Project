Step by step and the motion is low
Step by step into your grave

The sky ahead is so unnatural
Stained with colours that should not be here
The aeronauts drop the bombs
There are more of them
What's this revenge for?

What's is this revenge for?
The black sky is so unreal

Nobody will stand by your grave
Because nobody is left
Nobody will stand by your grave
Extermination!

Fire in the mainstreet, burning flesh
And the aeronauts will clear the earth
Nobody will stand by your side
Because nobody is left, is left here

[Solo]

What's is this revenge for?
The black sky is so unreal
What's is this revenge for?
The black sky is so unreal

Wounds may heal but scars remain
Enemies are friends are dead and gone
You search for truth it's all the same
Serve quiet what we dictate

Nobody will stand by your grave
Because nobody is left
Nobody will stand by your grave
Extermination!

Step by step and the motion is low
Step by step into your grave
