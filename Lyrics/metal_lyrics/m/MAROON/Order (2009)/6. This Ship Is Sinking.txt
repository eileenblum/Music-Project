I take you down. As this ship is sinking
The waves are crashing over our heads
I won't let u go, this is my promise
I take you down. I take you down

I believe everything you say. I will always go your way
Just lead me, I will follow. I know there's no tomorrow
I am your slave. I'm the one who feeds you. These flames will purify
With you I can not die

Take these words, take my thoughts
All is yours, you're God!

I obey every word you say
Please guide me through my day
Just lead me, I will follow
I know there's no tomorrow

Take these words, take my thoughts
All is yours, you're God! All is yours, you're God!

Down! As the ship is sinking
These waves are crashing over our heads
I take you down. I take you down

You took the pain from me. You taught me how to be
Trust me I take us out. No one knows what it's all about
I am your slave, I'm the one who feeds you
These flames will purify
Your order never dies

Take these words, take my thoughts
All is yours, you're God!

[Solo]

I take you down. As this ship is sinking
The waves are crashing over our heads. This is my promise
I take you down. I take you down
I take you down. I take you down
