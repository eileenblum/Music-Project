Look trough these eyes, feel the urge I feel
We can't be wrong, this is much too real
Too many ears are deaf to dreadfull screams

We all belong, These words are here forever
We stand up strong and fight this fight together
Their eyes can't see what we believe is real
It almost hurts, what they don't even see

RESIST!
rise against
REVOLT!
Stay brutal

[Solo]

We all belong, These words are here forever
We stand up strong and fight this fight together
Their eyes can't see what we believe is real
It almost hurts, what they don't even see

The ones with heart won't look away at last
The ones with heart, we will MAKE THE DIFFERENCE!

RESIST!
rise against
REVOLT!
Stay brutal
