I lost control, I can not change
Between what's wrong and right
I don't feel any compassion
I don't feel at all

In my head there is no difference!
In my chest there beats nothing
In my chest, In my chest, In my chest
There beats nothing!

I always sleep without remorse
As violence is immortal, this violence is my power!
I don't select
You could be next

Leave you scared as I move on
Leave you broken as I go on
Leave you scared as I move on

I will not stop, you can not judge me
They make me love, your screams for justice
Your laws will never do me harm

Leave you scared as I move on. Leave you broken as I go on [3x]
