Endless insanity
Recreation of symmetry
Like two stars we make a whole
Discipline and fantasy
Strength and unity
Of mind body and soul

TO REACH A HIGHER GOAL
TO CREATE THE PERFECT SOUL
REACH THE SUN
WE WANT THE SUN

Towards the burning sky
Arms open wide
With honour and pride
With honour and pride
The search for ourselves
In an ocean of others
We have to reach the sun
Anarchy of individuality
Chaos and sympathy
We have to catch the sun

TO REACH A HIGHER GOAL
TO CREATE THE PERFECT SOUL
REACH THE SUN
WE WANT THE SUN

Towards the burning sky
Arms open wide
With honour and pride
Reach the sun
We want the sun

TO REACH A HIGHER GOAL
TO CREATE THE PERFECT SOUL
REACH THE SUN
WE WANT THE SUN
WE WANT THE SUN!
