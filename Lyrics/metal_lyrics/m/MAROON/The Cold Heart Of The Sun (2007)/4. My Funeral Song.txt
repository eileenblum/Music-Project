I promise evil is on my side
When I walk the path of sorrow
Why do you stand here
Face down
Alone sad almost cold as ice
Killed and smashed by all your lies
I sold my memories my last name
No one here knows that Iâm still here the dead one
Why should I stay here so alone
No one knows me anymore was already dead before

WHY SHOULD I STAY
TO LOOSE THIS WORLD

I lost everything
Nameless in my house
This is my funeral march
Where is my life
Where is the time
My years are taken away
This life is poison
I donât care what you say
The sound of the deaf
Here is my vision
The souls are perished
I promise evil is on my side
When I walk the patch of sorrow
Why do you stand here
Alone sad almost cold as ice
Killed and smashed by all your lies

THIS IS MY FUNERAL SONG
