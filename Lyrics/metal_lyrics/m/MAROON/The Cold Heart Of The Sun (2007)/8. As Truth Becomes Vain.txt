Indoctrination of millions
Sick brains breed sick ideas
No illusions about the truth
Sick minds are open to lies
A whole mass is watching
While pain pours like rain
Upon the innocent
Upon the helpless

YOU DO BELIEVE
AS TRUTH BECOMES VAIN
YOU START TO LISTEN
AS WORDS LOSE MEANING

You sit and watch it happen
Your comfort is their death
Watch them fade with no tears left to cry
Gas fills their lungs slowly they die
A whole mass is watching
While pain pours like rain
Upon the innocent
Upon the helpless

A NEW KIND OF TERROR
YOU DONâT BELIEVE
WATCH THEM DIE
TRUTH HAS NO MEANING
YOU WONT SEE
HEAR THEM CRY

How can you sleep
How can you consume
You feed this system
You are their doom
A whole mass is watching
While pain pours like rain
Upon the innocent
Upon the helpless

YOU DO BELIEVE
AS TRUTH BECOMES VAIN
YOU START TO LISTEN
AS WORDS LOSE MEANING
