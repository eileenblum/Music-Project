The spirit of the valley never dies
The gate of the subtle profound female
Is the root of heaven and earth
Use it and you will never wear it out
There is something yet complete
Soundless and formless
I donât know the name I donât know
And it seems to be always existing
You will speak these silent words with me
As the thundered skies collapse
Will we echo through a cosmic sea
And the mighty will is set
No meaning no secrets in the wind
Here is the feeling der Mutter Kind

THE COLD HEART OF THE SUN
THIS WORLD LIFE ISN'T DONE
WE LEFT HEAVEN AND EARTH
THE COLD HEART OF THE SUN

Power rises from beyond the sea
The sun erupts in million blisters
Wild spirits roaming free
As the mighty forest starts to whisper
There is something yet complete
Soundless and formless
I donât know the name I donât know
And it seems to be always existing
