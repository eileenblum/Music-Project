Understand
Your freedom is caged
You denied your own identity
Not just peace
Its so much more
That you start to deconstruct

HOW YOU ACT
HOW YOU TALK
WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN
WHOM YOU BETRAY

Ignore
The constant pain
Start to bite the hand that feeds
Fear the most them who protect
As waving flags are burning down

HOW YOU ACT
HOW YOU TALK
WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN
WHOM YOU BETRAY

Do you think
You can fight
Stupidity with ignorance
Forget
Kill the dream
Before the final nail is set
Drop the bomb â make it happen
Save us all save the world
