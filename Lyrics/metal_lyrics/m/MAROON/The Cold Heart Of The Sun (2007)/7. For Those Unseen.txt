Death is calling motherless child
Dark wooden treasure full of delight
Morning greets you miserable child
But sunlight forgot you there is only the night
Morning greets you miserable child
And every hope thatâs cracking
Explodes in your eyes
For every hidden pleasure
A failure is in sight

FOR YOU AND ME
FOR THOSE UNSEEN
FOR THOSE UNSEEN
FOR YOU AND ME
FOR YOU AND ME
FOR THOSE UNSEEN
FOR THOSE UNSEEN
FOR YOU AND ME

This soul is drowning ill bleed this time
Bloodless veins slashed with pride
Colours salute you in black and white
We will not be glad there is dark in every light
Colours salute you in black and white

FOR ME AND YOU
FOR THOSE UNTRUE
FOR THOSE UNTRUE
FOR ME AND YOU
FOR THOSE UNTRUE
FOR THOSE UNTRUE
