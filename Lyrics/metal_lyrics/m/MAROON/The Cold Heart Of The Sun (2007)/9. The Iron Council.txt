The last snow of this winter covers your bloody face
The last moment of the eternal war
No more happiness no more sun
Nothing
This is our iron council
The last antagonist
Standing strong against the new world
Against the empty faces no more missionaries
When the iron council is marching on
Against your world against your one god

YOUR ONE GOD

THIS IS WHAT WE ARE
THIS WHAT WE LOVE
THIS IS ALL WE HAVE
THIS IS WHAT WE ARE
THIS IS WHAT WE LOVE
THIS IS ALL WE HAVE

The wind brings the stench of decay
Bitterness power and loyalty
The three kings â¦ of the iron council

THIS IS WHAT WE ARE
THIS IS WHAT WE LOVE
THIS IS ALL WE HAVE
THIS IS WHAT WE ARE
THIS IS WHAT WE LOVE
THIS IS ALL WE HAVE
