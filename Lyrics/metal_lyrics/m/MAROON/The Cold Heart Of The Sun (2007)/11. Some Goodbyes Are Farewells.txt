Touch this hand
This face is yours
It will never be here again
Please remember these times
Bite the pain
As dead eyes stare
Cold blood stays
A freezing moon the blackest dawn

AS YOU TURNED AWAY
I SAW YOU
AS YOU TURNED AWAY
WITH NOTHING TO SAY

All those years
Cold like razors
It will never be here again
Please remember these times
Memories are immortal

AS YOU TURNED AWAY
I SAW YOU
AS YOU TURNED AWAY
WITH NOTHING TO SAY
AS YOU TURNED AWAY
I SAW YOU
AS YOU TURNED AWAY
WITH NOTHING TO SAY
TO SAY
AS YOU TURNED AWAY
WITH NOTHING TO SAY
AS YOU TURNED AWAY
WITH NOTHING TO SAY
TO SAY
WITH NOTHING
WITH NOTHING TO SAY
TO SAY
