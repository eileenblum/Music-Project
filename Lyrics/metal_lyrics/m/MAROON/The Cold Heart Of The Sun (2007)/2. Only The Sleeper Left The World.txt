Only the sleeper left the world
Only the sleeper has the wings to go
Escape this world of sorrow
Madness and slaughter
Please give me the same wings

TO LET THIS WORLD BEHIND ME
TO LET THIS WORLD
TO LET THIS WORLD BEHIND ME

To die in the arms of conclusiveness
We all hate each other
Animals die without a reason
Please help me

TO LET THIS WORLD BEHIND ME
TO LET THIS WORLD
TO LET THIS WORLD BEHIND ME â TO LET THIS WORLD

My dreams are lost
I will never come back
Why should I stay here
And all she said was
Only the sleeper left the world
Let me forget the world of today and bring me back here
My dreams are lost
I will never come back
Why should I stay here
Please bring me back
Only the sleeper left the world
Only the sleeper has the wings to go
Escape this world of sorrow
Madness and slaughter
Please give me the same wings
