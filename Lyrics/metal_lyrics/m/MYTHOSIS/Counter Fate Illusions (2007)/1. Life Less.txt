This is my way of life
It's like a non stop contradiction
In a faded past lies this conception
A synthetic void Scaved into my mind
A murderous feeling

Imagine a falling star holding all the wishes of a child
Burns to nothing in front of you
A noveled fiction (A written Addiction)
A lust for passion

The bacterial infection (To this Reality)
Has choked the scent of my skeletal profile
(The facts of my nature)

EAT MY BRAIN TO GET A PIECE OF MIND

[chorus:]
This is not the life I asked for
These are not the things I stand for
This is not the life I asked for
This is not the person I am

Did I mention my sickness
Its all in my head
Mark my words
Cause I have none left
Preserve my memories in Phormaldahyde

EAT MY BRAIN TO GET A PIECE OF MIND

[chorus:]
This is not the life I asked for
These are not the things I stand for
This is not the life I asked for
This is not the person I am
