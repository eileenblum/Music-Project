So much pressure
So much waste of time
This is a story that we've all tried
I'm just thinking I dunno how to deal with my own
MORTAL SINS
I'm still living through this emptiness
Dream of my will
I cannot change this
Restricts misconstues
This pride bearing wall

Its always raining over my consciousness
Its always raining over my regrets

[chorus:]
I am the soldier of emptiness (of Emptiness)
Its just a stalling of time (before)
Its too late
(I don't believe in compromise)
Cause everything is fake
Everything is a fucking lie

I know for all this time that people guided me
But I don't know where I am
I've created my own picture of demise
To erect the opposition of our each hope
I remember now I am everything
The Alpha, The Omega, The God who created God
To be assured to the end
But then I'll die constrained

[chorus:]
I am the soldier of emptiness (of Emptiness)
Its just a stalling of time (before)
Its too late
(I don't believe in compromise)
Cause everything is fake
Everything is a fucking lie
