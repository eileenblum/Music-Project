I'm now
riding down on these holy words
I'm kinda scared just by thinking
how much hate it takes to eliminate a man
how much hate it takes to eliminate you
Just tell me wheres the fucking god damn love
Close to you
close to the above
kill me then, I'll be grateful

That redemption from this quiet dream
showed me the now and the when
my life will take form
for the second time
now it's time
to believe in this
now it's time
to believe in me

Lets all burn across
Non-existent chaos
I'll sell you my pride
to forever lose my sensitive side
forgetting about feelings
choking on my own breathing
look up to the sky
Stare into the stars
look closer
my soul is missing

now it's time
to believe in this
now it's time
to believe in me

[chorus:]
At least I'll try for me I'll die
can't blame it on my inner coward
who tries to find my loss of power
My mind hates me thats why I love it that much
darkness to breathe, darkness to feed
my emptiness, pain and suffering

[bridge:]
INSANITY
believes in me
This drop of blood on my hands
DEFINES MY LIFE

Paint me upon the canvas of hypocracy
So I can stare back into my eyes like you all do
So please let me find my way back
out of the blurred portrait of ignorance
