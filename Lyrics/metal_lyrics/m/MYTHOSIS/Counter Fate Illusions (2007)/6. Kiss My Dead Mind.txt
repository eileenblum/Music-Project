At this rate I'll be dead before you die
And I'll be gone before you cry
Don't try to love me anymore
Cause I've bled all I'm sorry for

I can't remember your name
Cause its turned black my old smile that I've kept locked inside
And I can't remember this place
So obscure it's killing me

I'll be the one
to help you feel it
To Feel the fire burn
You'll be the one
To help me heal it
Heal all the spineless liars

Kiss my dead mind

Still wanna save me
You'll have to take on
You heard you want to save me
You'll have to kill yourself

It'll eventually grow on me for
I tried
But I won't be the last one sacrificed
I won't

[chorus:]
Tonight I'll die upon your lies
But I wont feel it
Taking back my insanity
It's time to close your eyes

You won't break me
But I wont be the last one saved twice again
I wont
A voice so pure
It's like a sixth sense
Telling all your superficial intents

Kiss my dead mind

I'll end up running I'm so scared
To break into my head
Into into my mind

But I wont be the last one enslaved....instead

Tonight I'll die upon your lies
But I wont feel it
Taking back my insanity
It's time to close your eyes
Give me a reason a reason to breathe
You've killed me as always
and now we will meet
It's time to close your eyes
Your eyes.....
your eyes.....
your eyes.....
