Surprise Surprise
Here comes the overrated past
The acquisition of my morals

I can't look at my reflection anymore
I can't look at you
Cause your so beautiful
Anyways we're all part of our sins
Cause everything everytime
Every little piece is fucking related

Oh Fuck I wanna sin so bad
I wanna touch your insanity
I wanna stare at my dirty past straight in the eye
And relive all the mistakes
Like the same loss of control
My sane just slipped
Take me away from this
Take me away from me

[chorus:]
Drawing the earth in the palm of your hand
Consuming the part of the infinite end
Set off the alert of this oncoming storm
We'll be covered in dirt
We'll wake up and eat worms

I'll never repent........
I hate to love my hate
Fight me Spite me
Or let me die
I'm stuck inside this mind-built prison
Made out of morals
Made out of regrets

[chorus:]
Drawing the earth in the palm of your hand
Consuming the part of the infinite end
Set off the alert of this oncoming storm
We'll be covered in dirt
We'll wake up and eat worms

The pure is so beautiful
The oncome edge in sadness
What direction should I take
What choices should I make
