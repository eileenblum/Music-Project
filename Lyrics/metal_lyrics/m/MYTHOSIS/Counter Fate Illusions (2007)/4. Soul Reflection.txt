My conscience is far
far beyond your strength
An imitation of a perplexed existence
Your words they cannot save me
hypnotized by a fear so dark

Look deep into my eyes and see my real side
No wonder an image so pure and yet so fake
together at the same time

Contortion in no sense
exhumed by corruption
I hold the key
I am the key to my existence

[chorus:]
My Burning Desires
Are frozen inside of my time
I'm striving for someone
that is lost
Smothered in ashes
I'm holding confined to this stride
I'm trying for something
that does not exist

Free from my innocence
exert from my subconscience
A test tube morality
conjured from my impurities

A person (So perfect)
On the outside (So real)
But so fake  (and so pure)
unpure on the inside
this illusion of life inside my mind
is a burning contrast of the person I fucking hide

I want to see I want to believe
but I can't seem to break free from me
I want to stay I want to be alone
starring deep into my Soul Reflection

[chorus:]
My Burning Desires
Are frozen inside of my time
I'm striving for someone
that is lost
Smothered in ashes
I'm holding confined to this stride
I'm trying for something
that does not exist
