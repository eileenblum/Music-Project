Believe in something
Or bleed out of Nothing
Anyways
My dreams will be against
The same pain as always
But I can't take it or deal with this anymore
And when theres sorrow on my mind I push it
To the extreme
And now theres something wrong with my vision
I cannot see
and inside my mind
There's a constant fight
(a constant fight)
(against the end)
and against my own reasons

[chorus:]
Only in darkness I can be
I'm blurring my own mind
Cause I don't allow my eyes to see
For eternity I will be blind

I feel this constant pain once again
And once again I'm finding myself
Fighting myself using self inflictions
Its the only way to find
Answers to my questions

[bridge:]
Help me, Blame me
Make me, Break me
Heal me, Hate me
Love me, Spite me
Kill me

Help me by killing my thoughts

[chorus]
Only in darkness I can be
I'm blurring my own mind
Cause I don't allow my eyes to see
For eternity I will be blind
