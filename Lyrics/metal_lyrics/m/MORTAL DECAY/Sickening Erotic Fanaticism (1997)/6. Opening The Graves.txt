Opening the graves of local women. Robbing the corpses of the blessed earth. Collecting buried bodies of the recently deceased. 
Grim harvest of the dead unearthing their beauty. Necromantic worship of the dead. Salacious obsessions. Portions of their 
corpses blanket me. Staring into their vacant eyes, expressionless. Naked, pallid torsos lie scattered. Weeks have passed, their 
bodies hanging dead. Dead, human ornaments embellishing me. Cuddling with limbless pulps, dismembering putrescent trophies. 
Photographs of the deceased in assorted positions. Decorated with female body parts, pubic hair for souvenirs. Numerous peices 
preserved, memorabilia of the dead. Mummified lumps of appendages, the smoldering stink nauseating. My basement now a 
charnel house. A gathering of human artifacts of bodies I've exhumed.
