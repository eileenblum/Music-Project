The butchered remains of twelve cadavers, hacksawed human puzzles, savagely beaten. Creating beauty through their mutilation. 
Not leaving one fantasy unfulfilled... Solace in lifeless flesh, obsessive rages of brutality, pulverizing abducted victims. Ravaged 
faces gaze exhausted, content with being dead, they all died hideously. Postmortem appearances, humiliated, horrified. Addicted 
to my most bizarre passion, insatiable. The grisly aftermath of my crimes... Weeks of unmerciful punishment, unbearable relics, 
grim decor scattered. Cleansed in acid baths for disposal, liquefied. Decomposed with nitric acid. Complete bodies jellied within 
hours reduced to sludge. Oceans of hemoglobin, feces and human garbage. Clogging the acid vat, dissolving the human skin. 
Destroying the evidence. Dissolving the human skin. Destroying the evidence. Decomposed with nitric acid. Dying, hideously, 
anonymously. Decomposed with nitric acid. Missing victims never to be recovered. Strands of flesh dangled from the dead. Bones 
clearly visible, the ghastly sight horrible. Melting the human body, identification impossible, beyond any forensic knowledge.
