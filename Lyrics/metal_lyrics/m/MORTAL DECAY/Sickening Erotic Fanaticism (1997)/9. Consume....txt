Bodies dismembered artfully. Twisted heaps of human debris slaughtered with joyous intent, geniously butchered. Splattered, 
famished corpses in the process of decay. A sanguinary lust to jugulate, decapitate... or debone, gutt, disembowel, I feast on 
carnal remains. Bodies horrificly masticated lie rotting in my polyandrium. Gouged carcasses gourmandized. Bodies blended, 
reduced to mush. Pureed innards liquefy transposed to a human goulash. Corpses skinned, diced, then cooked. Human meat my 
delicacy. I long for you, I long for your decay. Unearthly devourment, a human recipe so edible. Esculent decadence resulting in 
eupepsia. Excruciate, hear the whimpers of the suffering. Succulent corpses lying in their own intestines. Inhuman, cannibalistic 
pulchritude. Consume the rancid gore.
