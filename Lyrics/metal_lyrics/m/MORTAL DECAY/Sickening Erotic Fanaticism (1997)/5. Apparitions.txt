Lurid visions dancing in the twilight, visions dancing exquisite. Ghostly images distorting, ghostly images of Christ. Controlling my 
every thought. To receive blessedness in heaven I must mutilate the human race... Apparitions of Christ. Recurring faint 
semblances. Pallid and enchanting, horrid illusions provoking. Unexplained visions haunting. Corpses like mannequins lie lifeless 
before me, bleeding. Continuously they speak to me. Uncontrolling murdering, twisting reality. Disembodied spectres heinously 
cackling. Their dying voices echoing, shrieks of unbearable suffering. The flesh of eternity, the blood of eternity.
