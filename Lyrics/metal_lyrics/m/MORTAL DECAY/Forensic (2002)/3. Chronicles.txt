In my years of seclusion, the escalation of a minds insanity. Become 
prisoner to my imaginings. A psychopath that society created. Horribly 
abused as a child, violent impulses intensified, intoxicated through the 
multitude of my crimes. All demented and perverted, grotesque diaries 
document in explicit detail the chronicles of my life. I will forever live 
in infamy...
I remember my first, she was 9 years of age. Shining with innocence, I kept 
her teeth to remind me of her smile, no sexual acts, just the insane thrill 
of killing, not to say I haven't had those urges before. Tens of child 
molestations and sex slaying. Scattered morgue  photos used for 
masturbation, video footage of sex and torture with victims of my lust, soon 
found dead from hideous forms of execution, dead remains dumped on the 
outskirts of the city.
Many found headless with traces of arsenic in their stomach. I created this, 
immortal in the annals of 20th century murder. I will always be remembered, 
the dead will soon be forgotten...
