Deep within secluded laboratories, minds driven insane. Sights resemble that 
of macabre slaughterhouses, subjected to sickening experimentations. Testing 
their thresholds of pain, deprived of muscle growth, caged, surgically 
deafened, infested, shackled and vivisected, crippled from infection, 
suffering depression physically exhausted. All for pointless research. Blood 
discharging from blinded eyes. Improper autopsies on half dead specimens, 
waiting to soon become corpses. Still trembling from electro shock. Chocked 
by the noxious fumes in inhalation chambers, viciously burned alive, 
inhaling jet fuel vapors. Blast injuries, ruptured eardrums bleeding 
expulsion of gastric contents through their mouths dehydrated, deceased, 
deformed, eradicated born of filth. Raised in misery. Blood, feces, urine 
and vomit, the odors fill the air the terrified shrieks of agony, the 
gagging, the retching. Science gone insane...
