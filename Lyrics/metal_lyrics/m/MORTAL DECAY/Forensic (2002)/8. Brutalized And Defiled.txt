Describe to me in your screams the pain that intensifies. I'll be the blood 
that leaks and the fear that fills your eyes. My insanity becomes your 
violent reality. Recreating the brilliant acts of those before me. Studied 
their morbidity to mutilate your entire anatomy, journey into a world of 
inhumanities as history repeats itself you're the object of my fixation. You 
are my Black Dahlia... everybody has the capability of murdering somebody. At 
first I was sickened and horrified the exhilaration, the petrified feeling 
of taking one's life. Bludgeoning, her screams were deafening. Bleeding 
uncontrollably, bleeding all over me, desperately struggling in her moribund 
state, and her crippling agony. Mother of three praying for me not to kill 
her but I would not hear her. Brutalized and defiled... her body restrained 
and glistening. Taste her perspiration, bitter sweet. Her incredible 
strength when she came close to death. Her faith in god and miracles came to 
an end. She bit. Drawing blood, fighting for her life, but I could not be 
stopped it took 15 minutes before she died, brutalized and defiled... defiled...
