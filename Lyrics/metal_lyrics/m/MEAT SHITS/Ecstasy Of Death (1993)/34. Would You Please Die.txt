You made my life a living hell
It began with the ring of a bell
Tortured me with your ego bullshit
My only escape was through bong-hits

But that was then and this is now
Revenge for your actions I now seek
Your life will soon catch up with you
In the form of my rage...

I find you leading the life I expect
Brutally murder you with no remorse
Chop up your corpse to feed my dogs
Now I must kill another from my past...
