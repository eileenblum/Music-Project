Losing control of my inhibitions
There is something I must say...
Caught you fucking another man
For your crimes you will pay

Knocking you unconscious
vengeance will be vicious
Tie you up like a fucking dog
Anally penetrate with my throb

Screaming but you are not heard
Cannot accept what is to occur
Thinking your death excites this night
Through your head I plunge my knife
