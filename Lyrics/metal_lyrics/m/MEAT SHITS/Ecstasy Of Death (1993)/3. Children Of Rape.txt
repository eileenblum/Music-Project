A woman is raped
Just sixteen years old
Pregnancy, a curse
Another soul is sold

There is no escape
For the children of rape

A rape happens every second
Somewhere in the world
Babies born from hatred
A new epidemic will unfold

Born into ridicule in a world so cruel
Taunted from birth
By everyone on earth

Grow up like the creator
Commit the crime of conception
For the children of rape
There is no escape
