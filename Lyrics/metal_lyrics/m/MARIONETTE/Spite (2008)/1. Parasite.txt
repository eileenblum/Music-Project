From every frightened failure,
You learned to fear the brave.
And for your every weakness,
You learned to find someone to blame.
You make me scream. You make me sick.
How you oppress by your submission,
And how your justice is defined,
As forcing me to be your equal.
We will not derail
For your mistakes you want us all to fail.
You want to turn our pride to shame
But I refuse not to do my best.
I won't shut up. I won't sit still.
For what you feed on you are the parasite.
For your crimes against will and freedom,
I dub you parasite.
I see it in your eyes
The eyes of a beggar

To feel guilty for my strife
I hear you rationalizing with blunt thoughts and words
Hear you try disguise jealousy as pure morality
and you fail to see how you abuse and twist what empathy's supposed to be
Curse you bastard!

You make me scream. You make me sick.
The way you want to be a victim,
and how you hate the ones who dare 
for what their actions say ' bout you

For what you feed on, you are the parasite
For your crimes against will and freedom,
I dub you parasite.
And I promise you will never have what's mine
You will never have what's mine

Parasite

(We will not, derail)

For what you feed on you are the parasite
For your crimes against will and freedom
I dub you parasite
And I promise you will never have what's mine
You will never have what's mine
