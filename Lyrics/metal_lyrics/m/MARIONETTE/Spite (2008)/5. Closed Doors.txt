When you're alone all that time pulls you inside,
Deeper into what has shaped you.
Into the joy of cursed teenager night,
Into the first kiss, the first blood.

But all that time has gone away.
This is hour zero.
All those moments went away,
To where moments go.

Never fool yourself,
Making the past present.
Keep those doors closed and locked.
Keep those doors closed and locked.

So many lives that have collided with yours. 
So many seconds of splendor.
And you loose yourself into what's been, 
Into haunted rooms.

Keep those doors closed and locked.
Keep those doors closed and locked.

There is nothing but the now.
Don't resurrect the forgotten,
Or the dead will start dragging you,
Down into your skull.
