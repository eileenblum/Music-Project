In vain ensnared. 
In life in veins.
In days and nights,
In strife.
Against the tide we're locked inside our minds.

For all I know,
Death is the only promise we'll ever keep
But there is a way.
She makes me bleed and go insane.
There are glimpses of release.

In her truth there is a place to hide,
And there is time to be still.
So let's pretend, we’ll always have tomorrow.
In this embrace, we forget.

These veins ensnared in hers,
This skin to quench our thirst.
And though I know nothing will ever last,
We've found a way to burn, to be here.

Under a sky made of their ignorance,
There is a way to find.
To be here – now.

And all I know,
Death is the only promise we'll ever keep.
But there is a way.
She whispers lies across my lips,
There are glimpses of release.

In her truth there is a place to hide,
And there is time to be still.
So let's pretend, we’ll always have tomorrow.
In this embrace, we forget.
