There is a numbness that's weighing down on us.
A wretched gray construction made of our wealth and loss.
And to be empty seems like the drug of choice,
Against the choices that they offer us.

We fail ourselves, crawl and won't stand up
They tell us, "this is growing up."

There is a judgment that they pass down on us
When we become what they are not.
Their only weapon is pointed at our hearts,
To brand us and to shut us out.
And it will hurt and it will scar,
And they will make you the loneliest soul in the world.
But you'll shine in the fire, my witch on the pyre.
Burn into something new.

And it will hurt and it will scar,
And they will make you the loneliest soul in the world,
But you'll shine in the fire, my witch on the pyre.
Burn into something new.

This is the end of the world.
And I know it's the beginning.
This is the end of the world,
And I know it's the beginning of you.

And it will hurt and it will scar,
And they will make you the loneliest soul in the world.
And you've been hurt and you've been scarred.
They tried to make you the loneliest soul in the world,
But you shone in the fire, my witch on the pyre,
Turned yourself into you.
