Then one day she took our days.
Made them crippled with decay.
"Write a song for me" she said, "lest you will forget."
"Go. Sever the ties" she said
"Break every chain you've made so you can find release"
So your heart makes the world turn black.
So with it's death, our love makes the world turn back.

Until you find someone that never turns away,
This will be your release.
Until I turn away.
And you won't find someone that never turns away.
So I will be your release,
Until I turn away from you.

Time is smeared across her eyes.
And her gaze brings time to life.
Pictures of that hand in mine, hand in mine.
"Pain is only words" she said,
"Pain is the chain you've made, so you won't find release".
So you choke on desires lies.
So with it's death, you will choke on desires lies.

Until you find someone that never turns away,
This will be your release.
Until I turn away.
And you won't find someone that never turns away.
So I will be your release,
Until I turn away from you.

Every curse in every language for you, my love.

I feel I'm ready to fall.

I'll carve my name into your bones and sew you shut.

I won't stay here, I'm not blind.

Until you find someone that never turns away,
This will be your release.
Until I turn away.
And you won't find someone that never turns away.
So I will be your release,
Until I turn away from you.
