Your eyes are love and war,
Ablaze with spite and proud to fall.
Like mine, so make it count.
The time has come, this night is ours.

These hearts – alive.
They make us gods.

So rise up, arms outstretched and showing teeth and sweat. 
Shout.
Scream as we combust.

Take me into your hearts.
Swallow me in the fire.
Where I will kiss your scars.
Swallow me in the fire, right now. 

A spark to bring you in. 
Ignite cold broken limbs,
And burn with horror's joy. 
I see you shine.
Let's make it count. 

These hearts – alive.
They make us gods.

So rise up, over all the torment and the strain of
Life the way it seems before you found this 
Flame of joy, and hate, and hunger as one,
Burn me with your love.
All we have is now
All we have is now

Take me into your hearts.
Swallow me in the fire.
Where I will kiss your scars.
Swallow me in the fire.
(Take me into your heart!)
Swallow me in the fire.
Where I will kiss your scars.
Swallow me in the fire.
