The bastards tell you that this world won't have a place for you,
But the decaying and your word 
Just make them scared of what you'll do.

They try to blind you with shallowness and screens.
They try to tell you who you are and tell you what you believe

Learn how to serve, how to slave, how to kneel.
From their mouths you see the gray pour out,
Forming shackles for your heart and for your thoughts

Learn how to serve, how to slave, how to kneel or
Be the cure to their sickness,
Be the new to purge the old.
Be the flame in the darkness,
Be the rising legion.

They make it seem like it's your nature to submit.
To be another cog in the machine that reproduces all their shit.
But the storm inside you will tear their skin apart,
And expose the dead flesh underneath
So you can see just what they are.

Learn how to serve, how to slave, how to kneel.

But we will never be like them.
Another thought that powers the machinery.
We are thousands (triggers army)
We are legion.

Never to serve or to slave or to kneel

Be the cure to their sickness,
Be the new to purge the old.
Be the flame in the darkness,
Be the rising legion.
Be the cure to their sickness,
Be the new to purge the old.
Be the flame in the darkness,
Be the rising legion.
