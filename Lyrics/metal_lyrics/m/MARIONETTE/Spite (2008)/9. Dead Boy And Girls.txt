Through the gray,
Through the black and white,
Something is hunting you down.
Something red, made of teeth and claws,
Made out of hearts.

Little boy, made of meat and snow.
Melt and become what you are.
Little boy, feel this growing storm made just for you.

All these homes,
Windows like dead eyes.
Empty lawns like empty graves.

Dead boys and girls, rise.
Dead boys and girls, rise. 
Shine.

Little girl, made of hair and pearls. 
Wake up and make yourself heard.
Little girl, feel the shifting world.
Make it spin, make it burn.

All these homes,
Windows like dead eyes.
Empty lawns like empty graves.
All these homes where you learn to die,
'Cause they forgot how to live.

Dead boys and girls, rise.
Dead boys and girls, rise. 
Shine.

Claw through the soil.
Claw yourself out of this inherited tomb.

Dead boys and girls, rise.
Dead boys and girls, rise. 
Shine.
