Darkness to cover up,
This accident of flesh and skin.
Darkness, black as her torn hair against his fist.
And the fibers underneath her fingernails,
Will tell us tales of the malconstructed legacies
That shaped this tragedy.

From the darkness of early days,
Comes blueprints and designs.
For the darkness within each man
to harden and to hide, 
And to purge all signs of weakness,
To make men out of the boys.
To remove the perceived difference,
Between girls and our toys.

So break away.
They want you to be like them,
One of them.

Darkness to cloud your mind,
And make you forget
To react as you are told.
You won't obey like them.

You won't obey like them.

And the enemies inside you,
Posing as your nature.
Trying to become you.

So break away.
They want you to be like them,
One of them.
So break away.
They want you to be like them,
One of them.
