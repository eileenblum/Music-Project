Starving pulse
hungering
starving flesh
and I smell her skin
like funeral flowers as terror lets me in
and the flies
sing for us
and the worms
hear our vows

Two fates are sealed
fingertips caress and decay
while shadows of promises hide the coming day
and the flies
sing for us
and the worms
hear our vows

and I know she's the end
but I can't help myself

spiraling into her
her tongue feels like a blade
spiraling forever
we will destroy ourselves
we're becoming our end

starving pulse
trembling skin
whispering
promises of sin
I close her eyes
grab her throat
to give her the ring
and the flies
sing for us
and the worms
hear our vows

in this dead garden
we shall grow
while our cold eyes reflect what we know;
that tomorrow is a lie
that the face of love
kills with a smile

spiraling into her
her tongue feels like a blade
spiraling forever
we will destroy ourselves
we're becoming our end
