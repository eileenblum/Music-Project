They never knew us.
They just wanted us to bear their shame.
To see us kneeling,
But in spite, I whisper your name.
And I know, they can't make you crawl,
'Cause you're unbreakable.

We're hand in hand, against this world.
Your hand in mine.
In spite. 
In love.
And tonight we will turn our backs against them.
We will walk away.

Burn these dying streets,
With the stains on our sheets.

We're hand in hand, against this world.
Your hand in mine.
In spite. 
In love.
And tonight we will turn our backs against them.
We will walk away.
