and in the gutter lies moldy hearts 
among the rats and dirty shards they rot 

make me burn, purify, make me burn, purify 
cut the skin and shatter me 
make me slip, purify, make me slip, purify 
until no one waits for me 

her blood thunders inside my skull 
she is the flood 
and she laughs at all that remains 
while I'm drowning in my shame

make me burn, purify, make me burn, purify 
cut the skin and shatter me 
make me slip, purify, make me slip, purify 
until no one waits for me 

out of the past 
comes the storms 
like a whip, like a leash, like a map of scars and skin 
from below, from beneath screams a thousand memories 

her blood thunders inside my skull
she is the flood 
and she laughs at all that remains
while I'm drowning in my shame 

ashes of days and the ghost of an embrace 
I can hear her dancing now, on top of my grave 
ashes of nights and the words of innocence 
they sound so much brighter now, spoken by the dead
