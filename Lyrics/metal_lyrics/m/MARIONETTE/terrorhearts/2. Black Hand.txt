order, order, uniformed 
their law, their word, their control 
dance and laugh, pacified 
dance and laugh, monitored by their 
order, order, citizen 
make me, make me, leaderman 
we're the cracks in the wall, 
we are spite, we are the burning schools 

raise your voice 
scream until the leaders burn 
justice from a hand turned black 
rasie your voice 
change will come to those who search 
justice from a hand turned black 

break this, break them, make them pay
we can shape this, make a change 
retribution for unpunished crimes 
payback for our poisoned minds 
we're the cracks in the wall, 
we are spite, we are the burning schools

raise your voice 
scream until the leaders burn 
justice from a hand turned black 
rasie your voice 
change will come to those who search 
justice from a hand turned black
