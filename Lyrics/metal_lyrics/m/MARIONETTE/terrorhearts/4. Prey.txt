lift me 
over the soil 
into the clouds of blood 
where we are timeless
hidden from life
burning with death 
naked against the sky 

I've been praying countless nights 
for something to be true 
for flesh to outshine the tired sun 
and make these nerves explode 

and her lips rip me away 
to where the lights kill the gods
and I am drenched in her skin 
and swept away 

for her wings bring the storm 
red is the sky under her feathers 
for her wings bring the storm 
we are the fall and the horizon burns 

far over the earth 
poisoned with lust 
far over the earth 
screaming in her arms 

soaring 
far from this world 
reason devours itself 
in our hunger 
hidden from life 
burning with death 
naked against the sky 

for her wings bring the storm 
red is the sky under her feathers
for her wings bring the storm 
we are the fall and the horizon burns 

far over the earth 
poisoned with lust 
far over the earth 
prey in her claws
