starving pulse
hungering 
starving flesh 
and I smell her skin 
like funeral flowers 
as terror lets me in 
and the flies sing for us 
and the worms hear our vows 

two fates are sealed 
fingertips caress and decay 
while shadows of promises 
hide the coming day 
and the flies sing for us
and the worms hear our vows 

and I know she's the end 
but I can't help myself 

spiraling into her 
her tounge feels like a blade 
spiraling forever 
we will destroy ourselves 

starving pulse 
trembling skin 
whispering promises of sin 
I close her eyes 
grab her throat 
to give her the ring 
and the flies sing for us 
and the worms hear our vows 

in this dead garden we shall grow 
while our cold eyes reflect what we know; 
that tomorrow is a lie 
that the face of love kills with a smile
