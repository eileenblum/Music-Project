Youâre all swine
You hippie scum / You fascist pig
You inbred brat
You white trash bitch / I hate you
Hate what you make me become
I hate you for making me hate
For turning me into you
For not being better than this
Not better than you
How I loathe your ignorant gluttonous smile
As you suck on the puss-dripping tits of the world
Fat and white
And your crimes will feed the masters
And your words will please them all
For you apathy is virtue
For you freedom is when you conform
You never stood up when they pushed him
Mocked her / kicked him / raped her / hurt him
Told her it was her own fault and made her lie
You never questioned when they filled our heads with
Docu-drama-tv-contest-idol-this-is-girl-and-this-is-boy
