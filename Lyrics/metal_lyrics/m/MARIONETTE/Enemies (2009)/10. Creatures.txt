Someday theyâll get you / someday youâll see like their eyes do
Someday their ignorance and expectations will change you
Someday might be today / your final day as yourself / someday
Someday youâll realize that every fire faded and every secret went away
And all the creatures died / just like the woods that were alive
And all the colors and the magic starved to death with age
Today you take it back / today you burn their sickness / today
Tear them down / tear them down / this is your final war
Burn their lies / the truth is in your heart
They want to see you blend into their crowds and silence
They want to see your soul decay
Tear them down / tear them down / this is your final war
Burn their lies / the truth is in your heart
Change this world / change yourself / it is the only way
Purge yourself of their fear and burn away their hate
