Empty and alone / every bridge is burning and I know
Every book is closed / all is said and done / so what have I become?
Crippled and decaying / Iâm the lowest of the low / so what have I become?
Wrecked by my anger / worse than you all / and I turned into ashes
Every nerve went numb / every fire faded out
Now I know nothingâs true / everything is gone
I can never beat you and I know that I have become you after all
I cursed you and I screamed
Words of red and black / death unto us all
Death âcause we deserve it / for our hidden crimes
For the broken girls / for the quiet boys that keep me pushing till theyâre monsters
And cannot fight years of man-made rules shaping us to swine
Each one an accomplice / every bloodstained hand trained to wield the knives
Squealing in the dark as we are butchering each other
Giggling at our screens / meaningless and fat / rolling in the dirt
Thinking that weâre different / that we play a part
But there is no truth / we are never different / and there is no truth
