Like tides we twist and we turn / through nerves
Dead moments and chemical burns
and bitterness breeds in the hearts of the brave
our visions of clarity fool us to hate
blood on the streets
we wonât pity mankind
all this is in vain / all this is illusion
But we donât give a fuck tonight
We are the flesh / we are the truth
Truth we make / so know the night always comes
For us to be what we really are
As fire devours the face of time
So we shall ravage this land of swine
Blood on the streets
We donât pity mankind
And tonight we ride
All this is in vain / all this is illusion
But we donât give a fuck tonight
We are the flesh / we are the truth
Truth we make / know this is in vain
See through this illusion
So we can forge new truth from sin
From what they told you was forbidden
