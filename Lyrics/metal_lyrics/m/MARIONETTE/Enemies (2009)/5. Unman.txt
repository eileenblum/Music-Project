I will become your new reason to hide / I am vengeance
Iâm pride / I am justice at last / you slip between the cracks
Ignore your crimes / they wonât blame the nice white guy
They wonât trust the slutty girls and itâs too late for her
Bet she deserved it / what did she expect?
The way of the world
I will become your new reason to hide / I am vengeance
Iâm pride / I am justice at last
Of course she wants it when sheâs dressed like that
Drinking what you buy / raised to laugh at jokes you tell her
Raised to smile
Bet she deserved it / what did she expect?
The way of the world
â¦ and cut your skin like you cut hers
Weâll cut your skin like you cut hers
