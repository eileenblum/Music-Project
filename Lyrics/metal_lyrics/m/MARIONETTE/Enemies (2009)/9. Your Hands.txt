Goddamn you all / I told you to leave it alone / theyâll mock you
Theyâll cut you until you become like them / like me
Alone, because I hated them so
I hated, but I just couldn't beat them
I know I tried and tried but thereâll always be more
And hate hollows you out till you canât feel anymore
Maybe youâre right / maybe weâre stronger now
Thereâs only one way to find out
Your hands reach out for mine
Your hands demand I rise / against the world
It sounds so beautiful when spoken by you
Deep within me there is something that stirs
You make me burn / make me remember those words
Your hands / warm around mine / they guide me to the light
And now I know weâll lead the way
Weâll make a truth / weâll make them pay
Dead boys and girls / I knew youâd rise
Your hands / beating my heart / to reignite the spark
Our hands / they wielded knives / now they will give us life
