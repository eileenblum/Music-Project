We fall from what we knew / from what we were
From what they made us / from the herd
They move like smoke to choke
Us with their words
To judge us for our worth
This time theyâll never see us crawl
They know how one gets back into the fold
Silent agreements all untold
They know the rules
That no one speaks out loud
The rules we broke by being strong
Never again
Weâll never be like them
Weâll never wield their knives again
For we have learned from every scar
Of weaknesses in their hollow hearts
Of how the masses cut the few
And carve their hatred into you
Never again
Weâll never be like them
Weâll never wield their knives again
This time theyâll never see us crawl
So rise up
This is our way / the truth we made
