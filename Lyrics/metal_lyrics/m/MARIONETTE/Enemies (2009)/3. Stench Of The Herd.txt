I canât breathe the air that you poison / I get sick from watching you crawl
You donât try to rise from sewage / You wonât even learn to walk
Here in the dark / trapped between flesh / drowning in the herd
Enemy / enemy / so you play the part that they gave you / know your place
And you never ask âem those questions to their face
The radio serves you music; why should you look for more?
The tv serves you truth and there is always someone else in charge
Youâve got your porn and beer and friends and nothing changes anyway
Just keep those minorities weird and far away
Here in the dark / trapped between flesh / drowning in the herd
Enemy / enemy / so you play the part that they gave you / know your place
And you learn to separate us from them
Safe in normality upon your couch you judge the rest
And you sure heard those goth kids love to cut themselves
And those damn feminists should shut up and get over it
And those damn darkies should enjoy this place or move right back
They grew you fat for a reason / and Iâll make sure slaughter is the season
Over the grunting of the herd I hear the butcherâs feet
The storm is coming / I wonât listen when you weep
