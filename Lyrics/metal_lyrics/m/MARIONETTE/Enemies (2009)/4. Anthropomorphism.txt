My faceless enemy / itâs anonymity / I must break you
I must be free / my faceless enemy / canât let you get to me
I am myself / I am my will / and I canât dress like you
I canât fit in like you / my faceless enemy
And itâs conformity / Iâm lying trampled underneath
My faceless enemy / why wonât you let me be?
I must remember that Iâm me / fuck you / crawling on all fours
And you want me down there with you
Being less than me / less that what I know / fuck you
Cornered by the herd / cornered by the herd
I canât escape from you / and I canât hide from you
And I canât beat you all / I canât defeat you all
Cornered by the herd / losing my pearls again
Cornered by the herd / as I become like them
Fuck you / crawling on all fours / and you drag me
Down there with you / being less than me / less than
What I know / fuck you / I am too tired now / my
Strength is running out / and I canât hold âem off
I guess it ainât too bad, but then again I canât
Remember who I am / fuck me / crawling on all fours
Guess that I am down here with you / being less than me
Less than what I know / fuck me
