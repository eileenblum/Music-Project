I shaped my fingertips to claws and wonât caress no more
I shaped my tongue into a blade I canât speak no more
I shaped each word into a bullet and I fired them all
I am the gun / I am the knife / I am the fist
I am the flame that burns / absolute / pure
And there is nothing left now / for Iâve consumed it all
Faced my hate / faced myself / I canât win against hate
The flame that burns / absolute / pure
Faced myself / all alone against this nuclear bomb
I am a frail shell
Inside me only fire and it burns / white / pure
Oh glorious hate / I am you / I am hell
I am pure / what I was is all gone
Burnt away by the bomb
