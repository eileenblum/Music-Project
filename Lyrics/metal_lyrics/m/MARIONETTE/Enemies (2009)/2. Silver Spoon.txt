To you weâre worth what we can spend on filth
Know you are the worm that wears mankindâs skin
Scarring us with brands and magazines
Breeding us to be your whores / be your things
Know we will slit your throats with your own credit cards
Because money is still power / because power still corrupts
And corruption showed you how the human dignity is sold
And your crime is that you trade it
That your world is like the old
Weâre all raped
Every day weâre raped by the silver spoon
Every time we envy the things you've got
Every time you treat girls as pets and pets as boys
Every time we realize we want to be like you
Now we must slit their throats with their own credit cards
If you think that weâre all equal now, then take a closer look
âcause the wealthy rule as always
Just more subtle and disguised
As gods of the new religion / built from our own greed and lies
