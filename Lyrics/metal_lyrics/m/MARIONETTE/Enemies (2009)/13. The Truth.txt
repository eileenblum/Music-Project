We breathe light / once again but always like the first time
Burning in our glory / we breathe light
We breathe light / once again we soar above the swine
Strife took us here / weâll never look behind
Itâs our time fallen ones / itâs our time morning stars
To rise brighter than the sun
We counted the knives in our backs
And we took a vow / weâre in this together
We go for the throat
We counted our enemies but already knew weâre always outnumbered
Never outgunned / we breathe light
In the dawn we thirst for their demise
Pride rips through us and calls us to the fight
We breathe light
Purified weâre everything they despise
They whisper our names with fear tonight
Itâs our time fallen ones / itâs our time morning stars
To rise / reach above the herd
For this night makes us shine
Brighter than the sun
We counted the knives in our backs and we took a vow
Weâre in this together
We go for the throat
We counted our enemies but already knew weâre always outnumbered
Never outgunned
