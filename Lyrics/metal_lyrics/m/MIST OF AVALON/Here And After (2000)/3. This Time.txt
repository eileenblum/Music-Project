Red light falls on me
It's the same as always
I'm not the one I used to be
Don't give me kisses I have enough of pain
I wish I had you all over again

Your eyes hide something from me
What can it be
Your lips red as the light that fell on me
Hours of pretending its not the end again
Like once before they say I'm the one to blame
But not this time

The smell of cheap love disappears as the walks by
Never again can I feel the same
I wish I had you all over again

Your eyes black as the night
Your lips red as the light that fell on me
Hours of pretending its not the end again
Like once before they say I'm the one to blame
But not this time
