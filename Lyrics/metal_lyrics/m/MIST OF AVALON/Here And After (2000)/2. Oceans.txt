I'm falling on and on
Life remains it's always the same
Wondering in wonder world
Sounds of passion whispered in sin
I'm looking into darkness
That's my life, my beautiful life

I say, I say I say oh save me from my life
I'll give you heaven I'll be yours forever
I say, I say, I say with my whole heart
I'll give you heaven I say it again

I'm colder for each day
No one can see it, nobody knows
I'm losing my final grip
To reality to my mentality
I'm trying I stagger on but what's the use
There is no light left
