When all the words have lost their sense
When all dreams must end
It's time, time to join hands
Take it's hand and follow it down
Down to dark death land
You're in love
You just married the bride in black

Entering a world of broken promises and fulfilled lies
Listening, believing a madmans speech
You're in love
You just married the bride in black
Listening, believing a madmans speech
