It is meant to be like this
Or is my life just another mistake
I am afraid of everything I am
Shadows are passing my by
And I can hear him again

And I can't forget you and I can't ever forget you
And I can't let you down
For the things you have done for me

The voices in my mind are back
And I am all empty inside
I have no feelings left at all
I am afraid I have no one, no friends
But they said just try to remain calm and don't let it get to you
But I want some answers now

And I can't forget you and I can't ever forget you
And I can't let you down
For the things you have done for me
