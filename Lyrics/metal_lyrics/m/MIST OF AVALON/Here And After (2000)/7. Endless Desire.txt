Another evening spent on your memories
In a chest I keep my memories of you
And every day for 30 years I've been here
Smelling you, kissing you, the stillness that surrounds me
Gives me a passion
A passion

I had before these endless calls
This endless desire, these endless calls
This love nest has it all
This endless desire, this endless calls

A cold wind is breezing and my shaken hands stop
An illusion of sorrow and death comes to me in a shape of you
Give me more, give me more and it vanishes
Let me come with you, let me come in you a last time

A last time of pleasure, these endless calls
This endless desire, these endless calls
This love nest has it all
This endless desire, these endless calls
