The war is over so they say
But it's coming closer every day
I'm seeking the secrets of life
I'm begging you don't start to cry

I curse you for being alive
You who takes the easiest way out
The illing, the torture, the lies
I'm begging you don't start to cry

I see it too
The devil in you
He's coming and he's wise
Tell me more lies
Now I understand
The lines in my hand
All I can say it's over tonight
