All the tears that I cried all the pain I did hide from you
God knows that I would do if I didn't let you go
But still you visit me in my thoughts and dreams at night
You hurt me so much I buried you

All the tears that I cried
All the pain that I hide
Gods knows what I would do
If I didn't let you go
All the tears that I cried
All the pain that I hide

Only God has my confession
Pale, cold and beautiful you're lying on the floor
After you turned a knife inside me
I turned one inside of you, I had to let you go
To bury you, I just couldn't stand

All the tears that I cried
All the pain that I hide
Gods knows what I would do
If I didn't let you go
All the tears that I cried
All the pain that I hide

Pale, cold and beautiful
My angel, my angel
Pale, cold and beautiful,
My angel, my angel
