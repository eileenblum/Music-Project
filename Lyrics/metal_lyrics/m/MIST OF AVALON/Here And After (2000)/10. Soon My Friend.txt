I see the lights of stars in the sky
I'm crying out my agony
What's to come when the damage is done
Mr Death it's your turn

I see them scream of misery
I'm tasting blood of my enemy
I see fear in another old man
Heaven's turning soon it's over

I see life's going down my friend
We're standing on the edge
Cold days turns to colder nights
They wont our dying days to come

I see the light of stars in the sky
I'm crying out my agony
Once again, we're victims friend
Lets end it now or its too late

I see them scream of misery
I'm tasting blood of my enemy
I see fear in another old man
Heaven's turning soon it's over
