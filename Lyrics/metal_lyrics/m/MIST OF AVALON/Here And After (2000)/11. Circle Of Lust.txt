So it goes round and around
I call it the circle of lust
That makes me do the things I do
When I see a beautiful being I say I have to end them

I'm dying for the night I have no hope
I can't see the right light
I'm awake the next day
Seeing the turn turn into a bright light
I'm ending all of this, it is the only way

Lust is thicker than blood
The fire inside of my is burning tonight
That's why I have no controll
That's why I have to end it
I can say now it is time to die

I'm dying for the night I have no hope
I can't see the right light
I'm awake the next day
Seeing the turn turn into a bright light
I'm ending all of this, it is the only way
