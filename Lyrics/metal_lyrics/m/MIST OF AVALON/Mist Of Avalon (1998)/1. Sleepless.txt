I don't longer remember the days in black sleepless nights
So I'm seeking for the heights of the holy mountain of fools
Where the lords and the stupid rules
No people ever been there
In the land of stone I felt memories alone
An empty space of my mind I guess the memories
Are hard to find
Cause nobody has ever been there or seen it

My mind is empty I don't longer remember
The foolish nights the days in the mountain of fools
Were the lords and the stupid rules I have forgotten like an open sore

The dreaded days are over the night is new and black
The days are the same like the nights
The sun can slip through it's light
My soul has found a rest in what you would call fear
But that is just a mask I wear
Cause nobody has ever heard or seen
The mountain of fools where the lords and the stupid rules
I have forgotten
I felt alone

My mind is empty I don't longer remember
The foolish nights the days in the mountain of fools
Were the lords and the stupid rules I have forgotten like an open sore
But that is just

I said now I felt alone, but this is just eternally
No people have ever been or ever seen the land of stone and I felt
My memories alone

My mind is empty I don't longer remember
The foolish nights the days in the mountain of fools
Were the lords and the stupid rules
I have forgotten like an open sore
But that is just because of our war
