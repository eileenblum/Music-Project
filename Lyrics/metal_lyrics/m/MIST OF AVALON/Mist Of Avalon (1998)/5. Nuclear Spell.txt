The last time and now it's broken
The last time and the world is dead
Every body has lost their lives or hears
And they were right 'cause hell on earth is true

Haven't got a single clue who did this
Was it a spell that made this hell or was it now
Everything is dead the world is broken again
And it was the nuclear spell that made this hell

Man and women died for nothing lived for nothing
But why die when life is so beautiful
The nuclear spell made this world to a living hell
But who made the nuclear spell

Haven't got a single clue who did this
Was it a spell that made this hell or was it now
Everything is dead the world is broken again
And it was the nuclear spell that made this hell
