Eternally lost in feelings
Seeking for happiness
But forever trapped in pain
And dreams blown away with the wind
I feel nude, and I feel naked and skinned forever embraced by illusionary pleasure
You say no

Run away

Trapped in a dream of lonely spirits
Running away from a feeling of pain
Entering a world of souls and mists
Don't be afraid you have me by your side
Trapped in a silhouette of life
Fall asleep do not wake up
Just dream on forever

Just run away

Seeking joy by illusions
We hate love
Inside we all are empty
But still be remain lost in feelings

Just try to run away
