The heart of the rising sun has seen the end
And the end can no longer be seen
The light of stars glow
The sky no longer seems to flow
The rain will never come down
Nothing will never, ever, be the same again

No longer see the vision of illusions
It has come
No longer feel alone cause my heart has turned into stone
It has no eyes but still it can see
Will I heart it come ever again
Ever again
No one knows the truth
Cause it comes in black and cold
And when I'll see the black light shine
Will I dare to cross the line
Or will my heart just freeze
As every night before
Will I find the strength to rise
Rise beyond the black light

It will come again
We will come again
Black light will shine again
No longer fear the truth
Cause it's a part of me and you
