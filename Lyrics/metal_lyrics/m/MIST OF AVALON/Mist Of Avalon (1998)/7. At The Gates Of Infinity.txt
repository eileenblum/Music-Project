At the gates of infinity
A forever dreaming state of mind
But now it's too late cause this is our final fate
Beyond the existence of life and death in a dreamy nirvana
On the way to eternity, in the corridors of life
Forever filled with black light

Where am I?

At the gates of infinity
Don't scream, don't yell
At the gates of the holy sky
Don't scream, don't yell
Cause soon you will come to the gates of hell

Where am I, can anyone hear me
The last thing I did was to close my eyes
But now it's too late
I see just a gate and I wonder what it is
Is there and end or is there just infinity
