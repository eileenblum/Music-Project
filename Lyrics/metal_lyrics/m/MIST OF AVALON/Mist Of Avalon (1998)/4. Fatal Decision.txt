We're walking
Upon a fatal path
We're walking upon the eternal sun
God has come to serve me
And were not sorry to lose
Our endless soul it is disarmed
And your blood is black and harmed
Black and harmed

My soul is slaughtered in the house of death
Its voice is singing in heaven's hall so we've lost
We've lost it all

Soulless man forced to destruction we're not sorry to lose
It's just what we chose
As they all fall asleep I arise and look down into
The eternal suffering depth

We're lost but we're not dead. God's awful voice is hunting us
It's ringing in my head you won't be released from this fuss
