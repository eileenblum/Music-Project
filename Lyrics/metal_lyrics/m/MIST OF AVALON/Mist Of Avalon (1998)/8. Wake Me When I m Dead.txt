I saw myself lying on a floor
In a room with nothing
But still there was something unknown
He saw us apart didn't know what to do
He didn't know what to think he tried
But he failed

A feeling impossible to describe a feeling
No one has shared
Maybe I was too close maybe I wasn't there
A phantom appeared from nowhere
It dragged me down into the mist
Now follow me and 'll give you
I'll give you eternal life, it said
