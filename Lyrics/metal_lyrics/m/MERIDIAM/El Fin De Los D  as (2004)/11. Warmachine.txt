[Bonus Track]

In the land of fantasy.
Where the dragons fly.
The warriors fight for the victory.
For the glory without fear to die.
Born a wild child in the snow.
Warrior of the ice.
Son of the thunder and the storm Lord of the free blue sky.
Blood of wolves.
Run truth his veins.
The game should begin today.
He was fed by the beast.
Where the sun never rises.
Is face hardened by the ice.
It's a face of a war machine.
Born a wild child in the snow.
Warrior of the ice.
Son of the thunder and the storm Lord of the free blue sky.
Blood of wolves.
Run truth his veins.
The game should begin today.
This is my kingdom.
This is my land.
This is my crystal sword.
I'm the king of the winter storm.
This is my kingdom.
This is my land.
This is my crystal sword.
I'm the king of the winter storm.
This is my kingdom.
This is my land.
This is my crystal sword.
I'm the king of the winter, king of the winter, king of the winter storm.
