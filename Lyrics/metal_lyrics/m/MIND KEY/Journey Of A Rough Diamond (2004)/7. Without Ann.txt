[Piano : Mark]

I wander my direction
I need more time
To search for myself
Only you in my life 
I shared paradise with thee

[Chorus:]
I wish you were here
I wish you were here...
...Tonight, I take a look at my soul more and more
I wanna run!

I wander my direction
I need more time
To search for myself
Only you in my life 
In you I reflect myself

[Chorus:]
I wish you were here
Only Adia in your eyes 
I wish you were here
Only Adia in your mind 
I wish you were here
Only Adia in your heart
I wish you were here
Only Adia in your...
I wish you were here!
