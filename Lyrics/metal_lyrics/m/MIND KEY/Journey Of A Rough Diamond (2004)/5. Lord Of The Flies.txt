"Kill the Beast! Cut his Throat!
Spill his Blood! Do him in....!" 
(William Golding "Lord of the Flies")

Out of a world, of pain and lies
We go into a future
Where they stopped the time

There is... There is something which frightens me
There is... But I want to feel a new blood flowin' into me.

The Circle's formed, soldiers of new religion
But there's a never seen king
Menacing my dreamer's legion

There is... Something which terrorizes me
There is... But now I feel... that the Fire is a way to be free!

[Chorus:]
I'm Lord of the Flies, keeper of the evil and desires
Don't try to escape me, I'll never let you go.
Now open your eyes, there's another shadow on your side
You have always called it Beast, but Power is its name!

We're done! We have to leave this island, quickly.
VI-O-LENCE is between us!

There is... There's a thing which is killing me
There is... But I know that's my longing of ruling 'em all

[Chorus:]
I'm Lord of the Flies, keeper of the evil and desires
Don't try to escape to me, I'll never let you go.
Now open your eyes, there's another shadow on your side
You have always called it Beast, but Power is its name!

Now open your eyes, there's another shadow on your side
You have always called it Beast, but Power is its name!

[Chorus:]
I'm Lord of the Flies, keeper of the evil and desires
Don't try to escape me, I'll never let you go.
Now open your eyes, there's another shadow on your side
You have always called it Beast, but Power is its name!
