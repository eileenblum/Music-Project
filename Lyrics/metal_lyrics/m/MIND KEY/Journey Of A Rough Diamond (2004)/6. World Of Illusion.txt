Don't tell me that you'll always be there!
Don't say "My love", I feel your cold lies
My freedom screams...
Get out of my life!
This is the time to let me breathe!

Your real world, made of cold (and) calculate effusions,
Is crawling down before I sin first
And now I say...
How many thoughts, many delights
Wasted for you....

I craved for a beat of your eyes
Praying for a nice sweet smile
It's not the same 
I can't fight
Living, bearing
Trough the nasty appeals yeah!

[Chorus:]
I don't wanna justify myself
I wanna let you down!
I don't wanna justify yourself 
I wanna live!

[Electric Piano : MarK]

Through the streets of sorrow
Many faces around
In a World of Illusion
Try to understand
And now I say
"How much distance is between us now!"

[Chorus:]
I don't wanna justify myself
I wanna let you down!
I don't wanna justify yourself 
I wanna live!

Now I feel a strange kind of serenity
You are miles away
Now I want to play my game
Let my future be
Radiant and shine
I live my life again...my life again!

[Synth Solos : Dario/MarK/Dario/MarK/Dario/Mark]
