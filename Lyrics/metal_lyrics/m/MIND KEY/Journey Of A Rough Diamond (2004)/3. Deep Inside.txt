There's a land
In the ocean of my empty day
Light, between the shadows of despair
But you... stay here
Don't leave me alone with my soul
Tell me somehow
Tell me the truth
Show me the way I feel

Light... I need you deep inside
Like a mountain high
Now I'm screaming for freedom
Why... My dreams are miles away
Through night and day
I don't wanna cry no more

The scars are deep inside...
Tell me somehow
Tell me the truth
Show me the way I feel

[Chorus]
I could cry, tears in time
When I look behind
Can you take me higher?
You're the way, in this empty day
You'll be my yesterday
If you feel what I'm saying
You will be the one...

You will be the one
The scars are deep inside...
Tell me some how
Tell me the truth
Show me the way I feel...inside
I wanna feel inside

[Chorus]
I could cry, tears in time
When I look behind
Can you take me higher?
You're the way, in this empty day
You'll be my yesterday
If you feel what I'm saying
You will be the one...
