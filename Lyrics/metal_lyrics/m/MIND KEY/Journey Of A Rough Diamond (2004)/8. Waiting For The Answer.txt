[PART I : SOUL VOYAGER (Instrumental)]

[PART II : THE ZERO DIMENSION]

Are you ready to fly in the blue skies of your dreams?
You'll be in a voices ocean, 
Who will be the chosen one?
"Seize the day, now! 
Don't waste your time.
Every breath you take, could be the last. 
Live it again!"

In a world of misty lies, you are fighting to survive.
They have promised you the future...
...and you hoped in vain.
"Close your eyes now,
Til the end of time.
(You) Could be killed by the grey morning light!"

The time has come to make your choice
The dreams come true, but only if you say: " NEVER DIE!"
Before it's too late I have to clear my path.
And just my own eyes... will light!

[Chorus:]
In my hands there is no meaning to save
In my eyes there is a reason to live!

Your time has come, don't let it end
Your dreams come true, but only if you say...
"I'm my MIND KEY"

[Chorus:]
In my hands there is no meaning to save
In my eyes there is a reason to live!
