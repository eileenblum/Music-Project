I lost everything I had inside
Look at me now
Tears of sorrow
This love remains the same
As a mirror without image
As a broken heart

All I ever want is
Catch my own breath
Don't wanna be a man who cries
Stop now!
Memories, suffering, look at me now
Is this the man you knew?
Certainties break down

[Chorus:]
This love remains the same 
As a mirror without image 
These words it cannot change
As a mirror without a name... Break!

Somebody wants to be a fighter
Somebody can cry
I just wanna find myself

[Chorus:]
This love remains the same 
As a mirror without image 
These words it cannot change
As a mirror, where you burn again...

...It's you, it's you
Your love can leave me blind, it's so sweet
When it takes me high but I feel guilty now... yeah

[Chorus:]
This love remains the same
As a mirror without image 
These words it cannot change
As a story without a name
But this love divides the same
If you don't wanna leave me alone
This love remains the same
Look at me now it's time to rise up!
