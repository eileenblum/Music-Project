[Piano Intro: Mark]

I close my eyes and I see my past
How many tears I cried for you
Mind's illusion, real love
I want only an answer!

You are my sweet and only reason to breathe 
But it's time to write another page...

Time can clean up my heart forever
My love is lost in a fight with no name
Tenderness, loneliness, secretly in your eyes
But I remember my desperate surrender 

You are my sweet and only reason to breathe 
But it's time to write another page...

[Chorus:]
There is no reason to live in this way
There is no answer for broken hearts

You are miles and miles away now
I live the only way I feel mine

You are my sweet and only reason to breathe 
But it's time to write another page...

[Chorus:]
There is no reason to live in this way
There is no answer for broken hearts
There is no reason to memory calling
There is no answer for you and I
Maybe we'll just meet again somewhere, someday
But you will fall in love with me 
So I'll make you my Queen
