empty words flow from me
the truth hides between the lies
lies no one wrote down
gone with the words are the lies

so silent have these words become
fighting to get out, to scream out
of me
so empty have these words become
drained of all meaning

nothing left to say
words are gone now
nothing left to say
truth will die with me

no one will hear this again
no one will know what I had to say
gone with my breath it all is, (gone
from here)
no more words to say (no lies, no 
truths, nothing)

nothing left to say
