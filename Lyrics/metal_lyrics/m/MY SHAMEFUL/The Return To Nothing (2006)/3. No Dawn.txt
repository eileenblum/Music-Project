the end is here
the earth burns now
from within
stars are falling now
sea is boiling blood
the end is here

and all we've done fore nothing
hope died long time ago
I see your children burning
all turned to ash in this fiery storm

the world is burning now
the time of men will end
there is nothing to be done
just sit down and wait for darkness

at the end world turned to black
and the few, scared, burnt and broken
walk among the fields of ash
there will be no new dawn
the mankind has fallen down
the end is here!
