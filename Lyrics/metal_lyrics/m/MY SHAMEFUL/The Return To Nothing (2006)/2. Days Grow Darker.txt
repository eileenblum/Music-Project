cold is the morning light these days
the days do grow darker each day
it feels like the sun itself is dying
will it still turn to good...
...in the end?

the world is sinking
into the night
the light is fading
the night has come
the world is sinking
into ever night
the light is dying
swallowed by dark

sink deeper still
into this darkest of all nights
oblivion is calling out for me
and I close these eyes to dream

...to dream of eternity

I'm not afraid!
I'm not afraid...

I'm not afraid of tomorrow
I'm not afraid, no more
I'm not afraid to sleep now
I'm not afraid, no more

I held my head high
all was finally understood
tomorrow will never come
I will sleep away this time
