seeing myself standing here, naked and broken
again
I feel shamed, but cannot stop myself
like a beaten dog I came back for more
do I need the pain this much to feel alive

words became useless,
no need to speak no more.
stale remarks of my own state
turned to haunt my waking.

so long have I fallen
fallen from disgrace
could I say that it
has been better than this
that it used to be better
than it ever will be
or have I always thread
through this same

I don't fear tomorrow
it can't be any worse than today
and all the days before
when I hit the bottom...
...again

how did I lose myself amidst all this pain
all the hate kept fueling me on
all the memories of pain and betray
and I will come for more again
