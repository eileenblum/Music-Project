days go by
nothing changes, nothing moves
this same grey light
fade in, fade out from here
dust settles on me

the light has gone from here
but the dust still remains

years go by
nothing changes, nothing moves
I have been here
for far too long
dust settles

ashes fall on me
this day has gone
like so many before
in a dusty haze

there is no life here

slow decay
all crumbles down
I have been here 
for nothing else remains

fade in, fade out from here
dust settles on me
on me, on my hands
ashes fall down on me
