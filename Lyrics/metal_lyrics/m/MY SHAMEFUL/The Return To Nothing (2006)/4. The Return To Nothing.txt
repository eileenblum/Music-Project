dig deeper
deeper than ever before
dig deeper
into the nightblack soil

a cool weight laid down upon me
an eternal sleep awaits now
feel the weight grind me down
to become part of the earth
a slow process is starting
all the voices I still do hear
let me be here now
let me sleep...let me sleep

dig deeper
bury myself deep in the earth
dig deeper
beneath where the earth still calls
...for me

no light in here
no sun hurts my eyes
no noise in here
all is silent, all is calm
