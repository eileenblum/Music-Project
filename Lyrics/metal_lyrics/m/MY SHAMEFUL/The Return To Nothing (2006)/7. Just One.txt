listen to the song of a thousand hurting
to the lullabies of a million screaming
but the pain it keeps on burning on and
on
till the silence of the night leaves us
dreaming

but after all
it is just one man dying
where the pain shines like the sun
on the bed of thorns
all has become but pain
but still you whisper lies...

...of peace coming
lies!!!
...of peace coming
lies!!!

the sir has become
fire that I swallow down
no water to put it out
but all in all
can it get any worse than this
but still you whisper your lies...
