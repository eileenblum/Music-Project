Stars falling
My sky darkened
No more, no light
Sun failing
All frozen
No more, no life

This is my end
All gone, all dead
Into my forever night
I walk with my head held high

This end is mine is mine
And mine alone
This crown of shame
I wear with pride
My hour of atonement
Is right now
Nothing forgiven
Nothing forgiven

And the lie goes on
Mine alone is the dark
No more, no light
One day it all ends
And I give away
My crown of shame

There it is
All broken down
The night has fallen
And hidden my soul

This end is mine
And mine alone
This is my crown of shame
I wear with pride
My hour of atonement
It is right now
Nothing forgiven
Nothing forgiven
