Elevated at my sickness
Raised to a pedestal of pain
Glorified in misery
It is me. Not the world at fault

Forced entry into my soul
And they found nothing at all

Enshrined my faults
Bowed down for weakness
Sanctified in hate
Of wrath ever present

Desolation
Misery
Abhorrence

Isolation
Cold
Inferior

Nothing left at all!

The void has become me!
