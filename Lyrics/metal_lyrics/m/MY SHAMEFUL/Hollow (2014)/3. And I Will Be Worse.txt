Momentarily melt away
The world blurs out
This is not the place and it is not the time
The same old sense is creeping in
It hides right behind my eyes
A black mist forms around the edges
And I sink. Again

Destabilized. Word crumbles
At the edges all blurs away
And all at once. It comes back
Every moment. Every time

My shame, my lust
My guilt. My hate

Hidden, and secret
Eyes uncovered again
Nightmares pass over me
They never saw me here
And, as time unfolds around me
I grow in strength
And I will be back
And I will be worse

In my de-glorified return
I bow down in shame
I swore to never return
And all the time I knew

I can never heal
