Uncovered, revealed to the world
All of my faults, shown plain
No one to hide behind now
No greater purpose sanctifies my existence

It was never my purpose
It was never the plan
The hurt, the anguish,
But it was all of my doing

Whoa has become me, again,
In sickness, never and health
I am still here,
Never did they come for me
Never, and never will
