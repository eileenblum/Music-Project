So in vain, all of my attempts to better myself
This broken soul, it will never truly heal
All this darkness, it cannot be washed away
So I am broken, all my hopes laid waste

So deep am I, in my own hell
I created this, for myself
To sink in deeper, so deep I am

At the end, what will all this count for
Just a series of failures, in a life gone wrong
Will you say, what good have I done
In all these years I wasted in the dark

Waste not your pity on me
The emptiness inside you will see
There is nothing here to be saved
All your tears for me are for waste

All that I've done, still lingers on me
All of my broken promises
I find now ahead of me...

I'll never come back!
