I know who I am
That I have not yet lost
I treasure myself
It is all I have left
Unspoken truth now screams
Far beyond myself
I travel to seek my soul

Broken, but still
Breath runs, though so shallow
This blood that runs through my veins
So foreign, rejected from me
I've lost all I had left
I lost my name
Forever gone from me, my sanity

I found nothing sacred
All beauty has withered
But ashes remain now here
In the dark where I cry for help
Broken are all promises
Life has no more truth
No god will save me now
This all has lost the meaning to me

Lost but I have found
Soil that will keep me down
Rest but for eternity
Close my eyes and let me dream
