These empty rooms I keep inside me
Here I hide from the world, afraid to live

My life, I let go
Let someone else enjoy the sunlight
I dare not, to expose myself

Only dust moves here
Where I hide from my life
A life I never wanted
So let me be, leave me be

Leave me be, I want no one
To comfort me, leave me be

Sunlight, it has no place here
In these empty rooms inside me

Take away your hand
Waste no pity on me
This is what I wanted
Now leave me here, in my solitude

I want nothing
