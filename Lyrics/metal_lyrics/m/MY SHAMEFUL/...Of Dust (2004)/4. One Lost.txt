Final twilight
Twilight of the gods
Darkness falls on us
It shines this last days light
Waters turn to ash
Rivers flood with the earth

A sudden flash
Of hidden knowledge
One lost forever
Taken from us
Hope has been banished
Sold for shining dust
Secrets been buried
Inside the dreamers mind

Has it ever been said so
That the earth will swallow us all
Smother with ashen embrace
Fill our lungs with herself

So, it has come to this
Night falls, for ever it falls
Cloaked in this darkness
In mother's embrace
Smothered in here
In the last darkness
And she shines on us
The dead light
