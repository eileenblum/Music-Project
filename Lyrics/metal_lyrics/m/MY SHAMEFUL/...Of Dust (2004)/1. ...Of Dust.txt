Everything has become so meaningless to me

Grayness fills my days
Emptiness, all I have left

So very futile, it all is
The fight is gone from me

Darkness ate away me
Absorbed into itself

So pointless, is all our struggle
Why Wouldn't I just lay down and give up

Just to lie down, and wait
For the pain to end

With emptiness I fill my days
I'm waiting, for so long I'll wait
What is there left to be saved now
What is worth being saved?

Night comes down on me
Cover myself in the dark
Feel no more pain
Night comes down on me

What will I leave behind
Dust and emptiness
Who will keep my wake
Who will keep my memory
Who will keep my wake
