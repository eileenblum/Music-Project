A lifetime prison, this body is
All this time, without hope I've gone through
A disappointment to myself, And to all around me
Waste of good life... Abomination

Still, after all these days
I try to go on like everyone else
Just for one more day
I've grown so tired of all this

All these lies eat away my soul
All this time I've lied to myself

This show I have to keep
To keep myself sane
All this time I've lied to myself
