Slowly smothered, cloaked by darkness
Drowned forever, under ice and water
So heavy, my feet arenow
Burdened by my own sins

Held to this place for too long
By coward hands betrayed, by myself

Pulled down, down under
Darkness beckons, it pleads for my return
Waves cover me, the sea fills me
Slowly, but for certain, I am free

Thrown back from this place
Traveled afar to find my exit
Slowly but surely, I close on my fate
Slowly but surely, waters will close on me

Slowly, but so surely, I am going home
