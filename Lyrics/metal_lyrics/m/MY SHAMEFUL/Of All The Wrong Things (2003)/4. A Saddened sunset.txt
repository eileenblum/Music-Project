Just another saddened day break, again
Where ever I lay my weary look
I see memories, memories of pain
in remembrance of this hell, I wake again

Do you see all of this, all this pain
Written on the wall, all of my agony I felt so long
A saddened sunset will not hide these
memories, on the grave of my dignity

I feel not like a human no more
But a ghost I am, a shadow of past
I do not remember what it was like
to rejoice to feel the sun
for too long I have been here
Trapped inside this betrayer body
how would I like to end this
But my hand will not rise, to do the final deed

"from daybreak to sundown
I feel the same pain throbbing
Inside this wrethced body
the body that once I commanded"

"But now, all I ask for, is the end to come quickly"
