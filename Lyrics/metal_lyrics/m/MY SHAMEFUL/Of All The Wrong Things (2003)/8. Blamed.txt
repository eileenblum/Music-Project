A break of the day
shines upon me again
here in my hide
where I will not be found 
I hide from the world
from the accusing eyes
Silent forever
I lay still hoping for a better day...

And when all has been lost
I know, I will be forgiven

Turn your eyes away
do not lay that gaze upon me
for this mere shell of mine
would surely break before thee
would you like to see
how rotten I have become
A mere shell resembles me
beneath, there is nothing left

And when all has been lost
I know, I will be forgiven

slowly in turn of time
we dance, our last waltz
a battle, so graceful
not for dominion
we fight for survival 
and for dying
we wait for the end
and we fear to begin

Silent, as always
they stand before me
your servants
my feared enemy
your accusal
it crushes me
and here it ends
finally

I lay dead at your feet 
I want no pity
just close my eyes when I am gone
so I may forever sleep
