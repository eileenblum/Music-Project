What was will never be the same
when all is burnt away
in this, the fire of my soul
can you see, where I lost it all

Can you help me
to gather all the pieces
that once were my life

Trampled into the dusty ground
Waiting to be saved from the fire
Broken and small, they with fear
of morning that might not come

Ans as the sad sun goes dowm
All that's left I'll gather
and make a great fire
to light this dark night

I have forsaken
All that is mine
I will no longer be there
I will not see your eyes -your tears
And the horror which is graven within

Help me 
To end this pain
Help me 
To end this pain

Help me
to be the man I always posed
Help me
To stand on my own
Help me 
to walk this path to home
