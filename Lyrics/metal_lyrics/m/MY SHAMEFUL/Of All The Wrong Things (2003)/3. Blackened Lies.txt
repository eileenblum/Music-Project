Will you come to me
for the one last time?
Would you hold me
this deformed body
Will you wipe away my tears
so shameful...

Help me! Save me!
From myself, once again
Hold me! Save me!
From this dark night
Hold me! Save me!
Till I can walk again
Hold me! Save me!
Till I can cast you away

Can you hear as I whisper
These promises?
Words of love and hope
dripping of poison
Can you see how
my tears turn black
Hold me as I betray you!

Help me! Save me!
once again, from myself
Hold me! Save me!
From this ever night
Hold me! Save me!
Till I can walk again
Hold me! Save me!
Till I can cast you away

And all that I ever said to you
All those sweet lies you ate from my hands
they will come back to me
and I will fall down once again

Take me down from here
-show me what sorrow means
Take me down from here
-show me what pain pain love can bring

Show me how broken my soul is
show me all my wounds
Make me a whole man again
Let me feel what pain really MEANS!!!

Take me down from here
-show me how you can hurt me
Take me down from here
-let me feel it all once again and again
