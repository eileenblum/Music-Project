All the time I wasted 
hasting from one to another
never seeing, what was laid before me
now time has slipped away from my hands
And here I stand, at the end of time
and see, there is nothing I would not regret in
my shameful, shameful life
for a moment I do despair for there is no going back
I cannot mend the deed I did not do
I can't undo all the harm I've caused

Save these words of mine
and see the horror I face each day
like sand, time slips away from me
and there is no gate to close, nothing will stop it

Hold on to me
I don't want it to end like this
Hold my hand for a while
Keep me warm, till night passes by

I feel it all begin to chance
My body betray me, it turns to earth
Oh, how I would like to rest
But I... I fear the darkness...
