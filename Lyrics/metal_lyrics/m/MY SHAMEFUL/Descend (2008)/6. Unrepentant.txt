Silence falls on this house of suffering
Shadows past, now where to stay
Did you know I'm afraid
The darkness has fallen

There's nothing out there
There's nothing out there

I will stand on my own
Hold my head up high 'til I'm gone
You will never see kneel down
In this rain I will walk 'til the end comes

See how the rain now falls
Upon this house of pain
The rain falls now heavy
I saw the sun go down
Down...
Down...

There's nothing out there
There's nothing out there

Nothing...

There's nothing out there

See the dark shine through me
I am here now
Never to leave
This house of pain
Took me in from the rain
