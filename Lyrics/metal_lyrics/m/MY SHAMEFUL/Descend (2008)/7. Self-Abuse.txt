Sick of this yearning for rain
There must be something more than this
What is wrong with me, what is wrong in me
Why seek to be hurt... to be hurt

All illusion of life and beyond
Believe what you will
Nothing waits for (you and for) me

Make the pain my light
To guide me through this
Make the pain my light
To guide me through this
Life and beyond

Make the pain my light
To guide me through this
Life and beyond

Through self-abuse
Self-Sacrifice
Purify me through pain
Purify me through pain
Slow on my way
To the gardens of nothing
Purify me through pain
Purify me through pain

[?]

Make the pain my light
To guide me through this
Life and beyond
