No longer do I know who is me
Lost the idea of myself
Somewhere along the road
All that's been, all that's passed, all that's lost
Broken into pieces inside of me

Into emptiness I call
To hear what nothing sounds like
Into emptiness I call
To touch forever
Into emptiness I call
Just to feel the dark look back at me
Into emptiness I call
This is where I lost myself

Lost myself forever
Piecing all together I try
I try to find me again

Had to lose all I had
To come to this
To understand this is nothing
Nothing...
Nothing means anything to me
Let it all go, let it all go now
Kill the emptiness in me

Kill the emptiness in me
To bring this to an end
Kill the emptiness in me
