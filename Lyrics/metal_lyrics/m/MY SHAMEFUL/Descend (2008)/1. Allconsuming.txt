Still growing from me
The tree of the dead
I kneel before you
Under these leaves
I lay me down
Crush me now
Take me from this day
Under these leaves

Slow gnawing
Consume me
Still growing
From inside (of) me
The day is coming
Slow but sure
I lay me down here
And wait forevermore

Forevermore
Forevermore

Time all I have
It comes for me
This thing still growing
Inside (of) me

My own flesh
My own flesh
Eat me away

Take me from this day
Crush me now
Take me from this day
Burn away with me

I cleanse myself
I cleanse myself
With fire and fury

I cleanse myself
I cleanse myself
I cleanse myself
I cleanse myself
I cleanse myself
I cleanse myself
I cleanse myself

With fire...
