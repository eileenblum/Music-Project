(Disrespect to us
Disrespect to you and to me)

Can you see what you've done
What's become of us
Can you see me coming for you
Feel me behind you, now?

And I will have my revenge
To see you get what was coming (for you)
And I will (have) see you crawling... (crawling now)
Before all this is through... (all this is through)

I call the furies onto you
And you will pay for what you've done

And I will have my revenge
To see you get what was coming (for you)
And I will (have) see you crawling... (crawling)
Before all this is through... (all this is through)

I am the god of vengeance
I am the god of vengeance
I am the god of vengeance
I am the god of fury

I am the god...
