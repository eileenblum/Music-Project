You do not deserve me
Punishment too cruel to be
This is all I have to give
I bring the hate to be
There is so much more to this
All the things hidden from me
Sick to root a tree will fall
Take it down for better dawn

So cold, so distant
Never there, all the hate
Piles up, flows over
From me

I confess all my sin(s)

I know it's all my fault
It's all my fault
All the pain, (all) the hate
I brought here
I know it's all my fault
It's all my fault
Too late too take it all back again
(again)

[?]

I wept not for you
Nor for any of us
I wept from the power of hate
I confess it's still in me
Drain me from all the blood
Let the acid flow again
Can you feel me closing in
Welcome me and my hate
