Been hiding here so long
I fear they know me
They know where to come
To come for me
I wait right here
I wait...

Now, the gates open
See the darkness rip right through me
Before my eye I come apart
Torn apart by my own ghosts inside
Ghosts inside...

Yesterday is here again

Now, the gates open
Past flows out of me
Like a river of filth and blood
I try to keep myself from drowning

There's nothing left but these hands of mine

Haunt me forever
The ghost of myself
There's nowhere to run now
I've nothing to hold me here

Now they are back
They are here
Now, the ghosts of myself
Now, they are here
Now, the ghosts of myself
Fear has become me
I, afraid of my own hands
