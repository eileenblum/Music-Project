Praise the light

Like in ancient times
All around a realm of dark
Shadows come to life
Creeping, lurking, black as crows

As light fades!

We have put our trust
Into the shining light from above
We have had our faith
In deities looking down on us

We feed our fears
With nightmares born below
We found our terror
In scary beings that we never saw

Dark age has come
Light will stay away for years
Darkness covers the sun
Child and man will hide in fear

We have put our trust
Into the shining light from above
We have had our faith
In deities looking down on us

Hordes emerge from the ground
Pitch black beasts with burning eyes
Filling the air with sounds
Of cattle, men and children dying

Doomsday has arrived
Satisfying their desires
Evil is taking our lives
Drowning us in death and fire

As light fades!
