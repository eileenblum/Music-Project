We settled down
On the soil we scorched
Built our homes
On ashes and bones

Still we hear their calls
A faint whisper
From remnants of war

No single man
Rested for days
Conquerors and victors
Have become afraid

Still we hear their calls
A pained moaning
Out of the dark

[Chorus]
From the shadows
Every time we close our eyes
Dreadful horrors
Haunt a man for their desires
Turned against their men
Reaching for the blade to murder
Comrades, one by one
Die in silence, die by our hand

Men and children die
Slain by friend and kin
Covering the ground with blood
Revenge from those we killed
Weâre cursed!
The dead brought us what we deserve

I am alone
The one whoâs left
Shivering in fear
Not daring to rest

Still I hear them call
A silent song
Soothing and calm

I want to sleep
To close my eyes
Escape from this nightmare
Where everyone died

Still I hear them call
A joyous laughter
Full of vengeance and scorn

From the shadows
Now itâs time to close my eyes
Dreadful horrors
Haunting me for their desires
Turned against myself
Cutting through the throat with my knife
Dusk becoming grey
Life and light slowly fade away
