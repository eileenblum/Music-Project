From the ocean
Towards mountains
Through dark forests
Forgotten long ago

To the crimson sun
Hiding in clouds
Through rain and thunder
Until the night falls

Where no beast
Or single human stayed
Death and ruins
Are all that remains

Blood and gore
Once covered these plains
A bone shingled serpent
Is winding ahead

We will follow this path to its very end
No turning back, no giving up in mind
Our destiny lies far ahead
It is waiting for us beyond this

[Chorus:]
Ancient path!
A trail created times ago
For us to wander forth

Through the valley
Stained from battles
Over the mountains
Covered in ashes

Whether we will die
Or be reborn
To our destiny
We will roam

[Chorus]
