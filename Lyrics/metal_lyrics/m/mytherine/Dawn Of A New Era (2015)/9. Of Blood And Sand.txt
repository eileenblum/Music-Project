This is our journeyâs end

We came to find our promised land
We fled from the ruins
Of our origin

Searching, hunting for a life
Without walls and chains
That hold us down in misery

[Chorus:]
Smoke crawls like a serpent through the sky
Charred remains of dead men pile up high

With a flaming heart and freedom in mind
We bared our teeth against mankind
Against the world we stand and fight together
Is this better than before?
We have become proud and strong
Our foes weâve overcome
All that we gained all that remains is
A sea of blood and sand

Of blood and sand

Is this what we sought?

The enemies that we have slain
Have lived and fought so brave
To protect their kin

Blackened grounds we left behind
To bed their corpses
On a field of ashes and destruction

[Chorus]

Look back to our promised land
The freedom we have scorched
Burned down to wastelands of
Blood and sand

This is our journeyâs end
