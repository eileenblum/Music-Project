Searching
For worthy foes to defeat
Our blades are sharp and we are strong
More victories are what we need

Yearning
For the thrill of the fight
Intoxicated by success
We crave for blood and taking lives

We won our battles one by one
Never falter but stay strong
A trail of death we leave behind
With only rage in mind

We bring them pain, we bring despair
Their screams shall fill the air
We want to bathe in blood and tears
They shall run and die in fear

Hunting
These spears hunger for flesh
Chase them far and ride them down
Beat them in a deadly clash

Crushing
Break their will to resist
Take down every single town
Let all of them cease to exist

Force your way
Set their homes ablaze
Like the setting sun
We are conquering horizons

Slay them down
Don't spare anyone
Take everything that they can give
And set this place on fire

Torching
Let the flames kiss the sky
Only ashes should remain
In burning ruins they shall die

Embers glowing
In the darkness of night
Debris and corpses scorched
To coal, now alike

With the rising sun
We continue to seek
For more prey to hunt
And destroy the weak

Force your way
Set their homes ablaze
Like the setting sun
We are conquering horizons
