All land is far away
In front of us only the sea
Thereâs nothing but the waves

A liquid mirror
Of the endless skies above
A mighty road as wide as the horizon in front of us

Our ships
Are rolling back and forth
Slowly, creaking
Cradled by the sea

The sun is turning red
An ominous silence fills the air
Thereâs no wind, no single wave

A weak low rumble
Far from the crimson skies ahead
Like a hungry beast approaching its prey

Dark clouds
Fill the sky
As rain falls like spears
And brings the storm!

This storm will take us all
Women, children, ship and crew

This storm will kill us all
This must be hell we're going through

Forty-eight died by the storm
Crushed by lightning, wind and rain
Another six drowned in the waves
Sinking down with silent screams

Another day begins
Calm and peaceful is the sea
Nothing but the waves again

Our comrades died
We will never forget their sacrifice
Given for a future that is waiting ahead

Strong winds
Clear blue skies
We believe soon there will be
Land in sight!
