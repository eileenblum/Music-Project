The path is clear
The last man fell
We are standing tall	

Blood-stained are
Armour and blade
Victory is ours

Stand up and behold
The beauty of this sight
This battle is over now
We shall celebrate tonight

Eat and drink and dance and sing
Taste the sweet fruit of victory

Bring us the wine we brought
In barrels from the ancient lords
And fill these horns

Bring us the beer we brewed
In that time we gladly left behind
And wet these throats

They were waiting for us
Preparing for war
Now itâs long time after dusk
And they are gone
Forever they will be gone

This is what legends are made of my friends
In bardsâ stories our glorious deeds will remain

The men that fell
On our ways
Don't forget their names

Tell their stories
Let them live on
In your memories

Be proud and behold
The beauty of this sight
This feast is ours now
We will celebrate this day all night

To remember

Drink to the blood we shed
Drink to the friends that fell
Drink to the men we've slain
Drink to our victory

And remember
