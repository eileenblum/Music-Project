Out of the forests
Coming down from mountains tall
Over traces of the past
Through ancient graveyards vast

That land, straight ahead
Still dipped in shades of blue and red
Is crowned with silhouettes
Of a thousand armoured men

Stained are the heavens
Blood-red from the rising sun
Our shadows reaching long and far
To where the menace stands

We wonât hide, we wonât run
We stand together, proud and strong
The ghostly silence bursts like glass
As they come

Axe, sword and hammer
Crush armour, bone and flesh
Donât hesitate to strike
Take the enemyâs life

Strike and slice and shatter
Force your way through man and shield
Charge and break their will
Clear the way and kill

Hear my call
Make them fall
Rush into battle
Slay them one by one

[Chorus:]
My hands are drenched with the rain of this carnage
The trembling stopped with the third man I have slain
No rest for us, here they come again
Call to arms!

Bring them down!!
