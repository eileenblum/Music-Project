Set sails! Goodbye to old domains
Sea hails! The ocean is our road

[Chorus:]
Time has come
To leave the past behind
Known shores are fading
As we sail across the seas

Journey
Journey into the unknown

Towards the sun
Guided by the stars
The winds in favour
On our ride over the waves

Journey
Journey into the unknown

The land we know is far
There is no turning back
We set off for a precious dream
The land we seek is right ahead

In unknown waters now
No shore is all around
The night is gone but soâs the sun
Letâs hope we are on course.

It seems that we are lostâ¦
No!

Ho, hey oh! Ho, hey oh!

Ho, hey oh! Where are the stars
Ho, hey oh! That guide us to that land?
Ho, hey oh! Where is the sun?
Ho, hey oh! O, let this journey end!

Set sails! Discover new domains
Sea hails! The unknown is our goal

[Chorus]

The clouds are far behind
Destination still to find
With wind and hope in our sails
The journeyâs going on

No matter whatâs the cost
To reach horizonâs end
A new era will begin
In our promised land

[Chorus]

â¦ to an unknown land
