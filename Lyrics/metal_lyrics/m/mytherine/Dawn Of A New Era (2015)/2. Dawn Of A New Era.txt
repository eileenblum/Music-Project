The desire for conquest is gone
Our view rests below the horizon
Nothing draws us into the distance anymore
We stay here where we are

The arms are too weak for the steel
Our eyes are blind, the heart cannot feel
The fire, the urge to be brave
The will to be proud and free

[Chorus:]
It is time for a new era!
Greet the dawn of a new era!

Kingdoms rotten, old
Fields filled with gold
Bending the knee
To a long dead crown

In wind and water born
To live in earth and stone
No fire, just embers
Cowering in the dark

[Chorus]

We built these walls to protect
Now they simply keep us in here, trapped
There is no enemy behind these stones
No need to hide for you

So stand up and raise your head
Wake up from your slumber, use your hands
Take these chains you have forged yourself
Tear them down and set yourself free

Break down the walls
Hear the distance call
The world
Was waiting too

The night now will end
Look up and comprehend
Shout it out!
Let others see like you do

[Chorus]

The desire for conquest reborn
Our eyes are on the horizon
Something draws us into the distance far
We wonât stay here anymore

The arms now reach for the steel
We have opened our eyes and the heart to feel
The fire, the urge to be brave
The will to be proud and free
