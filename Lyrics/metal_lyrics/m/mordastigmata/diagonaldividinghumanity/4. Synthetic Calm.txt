"The Silence is my PERFECT PartnerI Feel IT, in my daily ActionsI Remove all the Past ILLUSIONSthat GRIP away from my mouth" Frameworks of the pastHang in the Dead space-timeI'm observing the world by rickety tile of waters... I follow the mist... Frameworks of the pastHang in the Dead space-time of Synthetic Calm...
