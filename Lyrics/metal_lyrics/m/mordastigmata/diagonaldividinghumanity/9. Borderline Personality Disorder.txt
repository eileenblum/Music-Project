Down there...Into the astral worldEsoteric halls with grey hungry eyes...Demons one step behind...  The moon(s) - so suggestive...Thoughts - so obedient...Night - so silent... How sweet is slow suffering in solitude...Silence is a deaf yell...Scream is a dead pure silence... "Facilis Descensus Averno" Metalic taste AbsinthUnleash the Spirit...Hedera Helixxx into unknown... "It's possible - to taste the rest no more from this incomprehensible duality,which lacerates me, which sense I don't understand and which relates to all in me:thoughts, emotions and senses ???
