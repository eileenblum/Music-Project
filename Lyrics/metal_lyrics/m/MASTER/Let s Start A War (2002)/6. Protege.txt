This state of unrest
An outbreak of social decay
With arms they're enforcing
He's learning he's the protege

Stand up and fight there is no escape
Stand up and fight before it's too late

Reluctance and sorrow
The senseless misttrust that we feel
Harmonious valor
The victor survivies if he kills

Stand up and fight there is no escape
Stand up and fight before it's too late

With blockades of hatred
The violence will soon escalate
With winning comes suffering
Is this just justice or fate

Stand up and fight there is no escape
Stand up and fight before it's too late
