A contradiction in moral equality
Dating back to the dawn of time
Those pro American rituals
Rules and regulations are pushed aside

Why do you believe
Lies are what you see

All for one and one for all
The presidential race was a joke
Their brothers lined their pockets
With cold hard cash
Why'd they bother to cast one vote

Why do you believe
Lies are what you see

Through colored glases most Europeans see
The rich and prosperous land of the free
For years I walked the Chicago streets
Strengthening my reasons to leave

Why do you believe
Lies are what you see

Lies are what you need
