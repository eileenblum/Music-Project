The face it appears it's the same
The blood it still flows through their veins
It's written they all were disgraced
The down fall of the master race

Strength honor disturbed
Incompetence conquered the third
Strength honor disturbed
Reluctance always was first

The speeches of freedom encourage
For brothers a million men marched
A threat to cleanse all of the evil
When questioned it all fell apart

Strength honor disturbed
Incompetence conquered the third
Strength honor disturbed
Reluctance always was first
Trapped by themselves no escape
It's the american way
In communes with strong barricades
With war games they practice each day

Strength honor disturbed
Incompetence conquered the third
Strength honor disturbed
Reluctance always was first

You've all been chosen to suffer
So burn on a cross
