Your face of encouragment
Has slipped away

Let's start a war
Power is the key to strength
Let's start a war
In this world the strong survive

Just protect the chosen few
You can all fend for yourselves
Often casualties will exclude
All the mighty that come from wealth

Let's start a war
Power is the key to strength
