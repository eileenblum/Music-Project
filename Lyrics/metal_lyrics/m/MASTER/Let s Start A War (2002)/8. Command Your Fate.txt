I have spoken all these years
I'm not joking you should face your fear

Free expression live today
Don't be frightened command your fate

We should fight intrusion
All the freedoms lost
Cancel any sanctions
Silence must be fought

Free expression live today
Don't be frightened command your fate

The fatalist is preaching
No one changes fate
So why go on living
It's a stalemate

American corruption
Violates human rights
Everyday a murder
At a certain time

I have spoken all these years
I'm not joking you should face your fear

Free expression live today
Don't be frightened command your fate
