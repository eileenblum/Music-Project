Look around you'll see me
I'm waiting just to kill
In the corner inside of your mind
I can wait dear I've got time

And the stockings were in a row
except the one I stole
The perfect place dear is on the wall
that' a where I'll mout you
Your head and all

The perfect seasoning I'll cook oyur flesh
Tasty morsals there' a nothing left
The perfect freedom comes in two
People vanish and I make stew

And the stockings were in a row
except the one I stole
The perfect place dear is on the wall
that' a where I'll mout you
Your head and all

that' a where I'll mout you
Your head and all

Lifes like a virus 
A spreading diseases
Controlling madness
Is my speciality
