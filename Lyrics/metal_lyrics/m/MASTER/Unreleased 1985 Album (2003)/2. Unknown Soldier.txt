Unknown soldier
We know not his name
Fought for this country
Death was his game

Promises of freedom
He tried to obtain
Shot down in glory
Lifeless remains

Powerful brutality
Caused by pain and deceit

Fought for all you're freedom
So you could be saved
In this great country
The land of the brave

Killed by the thousands
Nameless headstones
They're still remembered
In broken homes
