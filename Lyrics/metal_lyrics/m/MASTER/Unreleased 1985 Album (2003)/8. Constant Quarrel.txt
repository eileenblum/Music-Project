Life's uncertainty
The age of constant quarrel
Undying loyalty
Will this foot the bill

Relapse
Fall back
Repress
Collapse

Spent prophets reassure
A sense of false belief
Often to endure
A possible reprieve

Walk away
Never return
Walk away
Never learn

Promises of grandeur
I seen it in their eyes
The telephone stopped ringing
The moneys been disguised

Walk away
Never return
Walk away
Never learn

Life's uncertainty
The age of constant quarrel

Undying loyalty
Will this foot the bill

Relapse
Fall back
Repress
Collapse

Walk away
Never return
Walk away
Never learn
