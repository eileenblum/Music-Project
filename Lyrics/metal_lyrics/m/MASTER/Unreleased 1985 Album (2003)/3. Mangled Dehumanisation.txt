Mangled Dehumanization
Of corpses unknown
Excruciating tortures
Torn, flesh, broken bones
Again &amp; again til daybreak
Scarcely makes a sound
Possess supernatural powers
Caused death

In the ded vast middle of the night
Shadowy reminders
There's no one in sight
Slain infants still dead
In their mother's womb

Torments, witches, bitches
Beasts
All the same
Internal, external, nocturnal
No one will remain

Cause fuckin' death
