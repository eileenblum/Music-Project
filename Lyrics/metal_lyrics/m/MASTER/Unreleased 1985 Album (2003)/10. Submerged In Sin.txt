Implement, irreligion yellowbrick roads
Atheist, nonbelievers do they suppose
Fantasies concrete pillars demonic play
Warranty souls forgotten, could we expire

The rime is thin
Submerged in sin
Will they transpire
The lake of fire

Diligent perseverance, earthly unrest
Cautiously many footsteps, could be the last
Age ascends quick upon us, who will descend
Questions of life external, who'll reprimand

The rime is thin
Submerged in sin

Will they transpire
The lake of fire

Implement, irreligion yellowbrick roads
Atheist, nonbelievers do they suppose
Fantasies concrete pillars demonic play
Warranty souls forgotten, could we expire

The rime is thin
Submerged in sin
Will they transpire
The lake of fire
