I pledge allegiance to the flag
On the United States of America
And to the republic for which is stands
One nation under God invisible
With liberty and Justice for all

I pledge of alligiance to the shit
That runs the U.S.A.
And to this public which I can't stand
Government
Inexcusable with poverty and justice
For all the short haired wimps
