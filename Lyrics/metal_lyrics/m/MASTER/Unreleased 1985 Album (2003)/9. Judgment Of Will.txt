Worth more dead
Worth more dead than alive
It's often said
The judgement of will will decide
Plot to kill
A feeling that we've been deprived

Those insurance policies
Forcing murder violently
We've assumed the monthly plan
We're accustomed to demand

Money spent
The bills of the trust must be paid
Sickness bent
The worth of the man not his fate

Those insurance policies
Forcing murder violently
We've assumed the monthly plan
We're accustomed to demand

Worth more dead
Worth more dead than alive
It's often said
The judgement of will will decide

Worth more dead
