In silence I traveled each day, searching for the perfect face
But sometimes I was kept at bay, my impulses led me I would kill today.
I preferred them dead not awake their faces were easy to take
Sometimes my mind was at ease, and sometimes I wondered if it were diseased

Stalk and impale to kill
Re-dress, display and unveil

I casually stalked from behind, looking for the perfect time
So often was ready to strike but something just told me to withhold the knife
The disease of lust I confess with rage just completely obsessed
As blood pressure began to rise, I had to be careful and protect the eyes

Stalk and impale to kill
Re-dress, display and unveil

I crept among the shadows of fear, I smiled when a victim drew near
While others simply cringed in disgust, the stimulation pumped in my blood
Another life was taken by force, my justice was disbursed in due course
For years I followed with this discord causing so much suffering and pain

Stalk and impale to kill
Re-dress, display and unveil
Just kill
