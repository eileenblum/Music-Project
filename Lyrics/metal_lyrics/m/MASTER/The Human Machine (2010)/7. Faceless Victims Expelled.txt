Fighting for the cause
Freedom is nearly lost
Faceless victims expelled
Hopeless system of hell

Beyond reproach the leader smiles
Smoldering bodies growing piles
In their defense as lies are told
Countless atrocities still unfold
Suffering indulgence subdued
Existing intelligence improved

Faceless victims expelled
Hopeless system of hell

Beyond reproach the leader smiles
Smoldering bodies growing piles
In their defense as lies are told
Countless atrocities still unfold

Faceless victims expelled
Hopeless system of hell
