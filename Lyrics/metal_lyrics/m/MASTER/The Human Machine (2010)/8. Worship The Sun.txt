The threat from the nation has finally been called
Running is futile but they're all involved
Hiding is worthless, the plans are too late
Time has no purpose, they'll soon meet their fate

They had been told to worship the sun, the final war has just begun
The faceless will never survive, this ongoing hell
The nameless will never be tried, completely absolved
When freedom is rendered, a stiff price is paid
It's best to surrender the choice has been made

They had been told to worship the sun, the final war has just begun
