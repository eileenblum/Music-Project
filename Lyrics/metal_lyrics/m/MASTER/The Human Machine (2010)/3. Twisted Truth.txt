I have seen their faces etched in stone,
The church was sanctified built with their bones
A philosophy of such excess exceeds,
The discrepancies can cloud reality

Just twisted truth it's really such hypocrisy
There is no proof in thinking realistically

A belief in religious scripture blinds them all,
As societies all crumble and soon fall
Where is this god of strength with all his might,
When nations all prepare for the first strike

The weapon of choice, will soon be destroyed or be deployed
