Just look outside your window and you'll see, nothing real is really as it seems
The institutions still have their advice, it's really all been just a pack of lies

Don't you know that time is running out
There's no doubt that time is running out

The philosophy of megalomaniacs the futures here and there's no turning back
A faith in science as cells the divide, the new machine creating human spies
It's time to start a revolution, before the freedom's taken all away
It's not unjust, it's really just as fighting, with rules like these we'll die another day

Don't you know that time is running out
There's no doubt that time is running out
Can't you see your time is running out - There's no time to think what its about

Suppress free thinking, that's the order, they'll lead the lamb right to the slaughter
As freedom faulters thoughts decline, just empty thoughts and empty minds

Just look outside your window and you'll see, nothing real is really as it seems
