No one can escape total control,
Nothing can replace the future's foretold
Trapped in a lions den, without a chance
It's time to take a stance remove it all

They'll subjugate, invade, with no remorse
An alliance has been forged, an illusive way
Refresh your mind let thoughts unfold
Expend your might, assume control

I'm tired of all these games, the lack of space
It's time to rearrange and make a change we must resume opportunity
Tired of all these games, the lack of space
It's time to rearrange and make a change we must resume opportunity

The world is filled with rage, with violence enforced
The viper will invade it, we follow due course

I'm tired of all these games, the lack of space
It's time to rearrange and make a change we must resume opportunity
Tired of all these games, the lack of space
It's time to rearrange and make a change we must resume opportunity
