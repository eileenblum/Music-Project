The fire burns inside the man-made hell,
It scorches victims often where they dwell
As blood flows through the streets no one can tell,
The power mongers dictate through a smell

With victims sacrificed, the leader's pacified
With victims sacrificed, the leader's pacified
No need to wonder why
The obvious has shown true color

In silence so much pain is felt, the aftermath can leave such great results
As victims cry out all their names in vain, the past will soon repeat itself again

With victims sacrificed, the leader's pacified
With victims sacrificed, the leader's pacified
No need to wonder why
The obvious has shown true color

It's time to break away, to put fear in it's place
To conquer all divides and save so many lives
The suffering of mankind is self induced,
The fight for whom and what their so confused
No self control but often so enthused,
As chaos broadens violence will ensue

With victims sacrificed, the leader's pacified
With victims sacrificed, the leader's pacified
No need to wonder why
The obvious has shown true color

The establishment has planned to garner all
Control to kill them where stand
The steps are all in place so you should be forewarned
It's time to devise a plan
To escape now
