If you walk the straight line
Or down a beaten path
You'll realize your fine
And just expect a laugh
No can one guide you
Or tell you what to do
Lock deep inside you
And you will find a clue

Just be yourself
And don't explain
And make the change that
Suits your own reflections

Temptation exists
Along the way
The road to conclusion
Can also be changed
No can one guide you
Or tell you what to do
Lock deep inside you
And you'll find a clue
