We're taught to mistrust
Just to live in disgust
There is no us, there is only
We and i, not we

When all is said and done
And when everyone's gone

No one will weep for the terrorist
And his rotten seed

An epiphany of hate
Can you feel its embrace

Why make a stand
When it's already planned
Should we lay down and die
For their every command
We've lost all control
Should we dive in the hole
Created by sadists
Let's return to the factory

An earth filled with racists and victims of pride
So much condemnation, so many have died
Worshiping a bible they preach of this Christ

Forgetting the pain as they suffer each day
Enduring such torment and living in vein
They congregate equally and just twist the knife

It's time to escape
from the government's grasp
Give all the leaders a kick in the ass
Give all the leaders a kick in the ass
