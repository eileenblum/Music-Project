The gates of hell have opened
The lines form just as we speak
A prelude to misgivings
The prequel to decisions

The abyss has finally ruptured
No turning back the clock now

If your faith still inspires you
You can take the pledge just leap
The victims of the chosen
Just systematic relief

As Satan smiles
And Jesus weeps
The fiction soon becomes reality
Among the minds of the weak
