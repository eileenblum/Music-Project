The threat of violence will rise as we step into the streets each day
My father didnât treat me right the excuse is so fucking lame

Remove the rights to bear, just take my right arm
Control us if you dare, just take my right arm

With all the weapons soon removed the violence will reach its peak
Where will one turn also when they start their game of hide and seekï»¿
