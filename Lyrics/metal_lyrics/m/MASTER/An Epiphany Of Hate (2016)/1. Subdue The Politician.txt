The time's arrived to educate the people
As violence expends it's final thrust
A world that just responds to the pure evil
The weaklings all just cower in defeat

There's a need to just subdue the politician
To return the power to it's rightful place
Existence shouldn't be a total failure
The resistance must remove the new elite

Deception's like the new bubonic plague
Accepting as the world's becoming it's slave
A fallacy affecting humans pride
They're pulling the wool right over your eyes

Fight on, skip the failure stop the fool
Rise up, thrash the traitor crush them all
