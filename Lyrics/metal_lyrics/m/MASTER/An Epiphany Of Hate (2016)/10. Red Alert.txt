The corporate decisions are based on religion, it's time for a recall
To obtain the objective we must be selective or the empire will fall
Social injustice revolving all around us we're all in denial
The senseless deception makes no connections we're about to fail

Relentless tales so misconcerned
The world is trapped inside it's own illusion
Defenseless so often so subdued
It's time to justify our own conclusions

Millions of machines on red alert
Will the people get what they deserve
The pawns of the impending symphony
The weapons of destruction will be freed
