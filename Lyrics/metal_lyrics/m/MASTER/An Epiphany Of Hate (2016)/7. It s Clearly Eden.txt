Step outside, It's clearly Eden
Bodies fill the motorway
Once I said faith was in season
Clearly things will never change
When inside the labyrinth contracts
No escape the virus spreads
Thoughts of all independence
Soon you'll wish you were dead

Life, is controlled by the hands
That all feed us
Death will unfold by the ones
You'd already expect to deceive
