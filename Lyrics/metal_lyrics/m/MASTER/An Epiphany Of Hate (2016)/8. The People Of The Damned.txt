The streets are on fire
There's a sardonic grin
A total desire, to join in
Let's destroy all the cities
And grope in the dark
Should one feel pity
When it starts!

A downward spiral
Has certainly began
All in denial this is fun
Let's envelop
All the buildings
And set them ablaze
The concrete jungle
Washed away

Obsessions with death
And mass suicides
With no regrets
Some buried alive

Could this really be
The end of man
The plight for all the
People of the damned
Extinction of this nasty
And ugly race
It's time to awake
And rewrite your fate
