When thoughts have died, you'll see the signs
Only programs will remain
The industrial wasteland just spread out endlessly
Has science made a lasting change?

All caught up in our selfish thoughts
Was it worth the price we paid
Seemingly wanted or simply just plotted
The ending of the twisting the game

No more aggravation, no more exploitation
Senses all will be controlled

Escape from the treachery avoid the abyss
So many people could simply care less
Let's all indulge in the final solution
Remove the chains while under dress
