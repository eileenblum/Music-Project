Age creeps upon us as time slips away,
will they or won't they the choice of today
Concrete conventions among the elite
the money the focus the newest belief

Oh, the industry
Oh, the industry

Conspiring against the original piece,
cheap imitations that often succeed

Mismanaged funds at the artist's expense,
selling your soul to just one company

Oh, the industry
Oh, the industry

Constant reminders of promises made,
record executives sit in the shade
Telephone rituals day after day,
just on vacation it's stressful in may

Oh, the industry
Oh, the industry
Kills
