Walk away from helplessness,
a sick collection of your souls
I'll drain the power from your veins,
a weak and mindless sickening game
You live your life in mother's home,
I've got the tickets to the show

But you'll never walk away,
afraid of shadows and the haze

The opportune break in the wings,
the sacrifice of simple things
The stage of chaos at your gasp,
but you won't listen, accept the task
I will take you too the light,
I will show how to fight
The blood of many paved the way,
but soon we're replaced lack of faith

To qualify to live among the strong
Inhibitions have to be forgone
Don't fall among collection of the souls
Don't live the life and let them take control
