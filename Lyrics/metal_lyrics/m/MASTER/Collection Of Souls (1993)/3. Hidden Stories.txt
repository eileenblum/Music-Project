Savior, please take me, savior, i will lead,
I love pain I've been lost I will change, pay the cost
Loser please hate me, loser just let me be,
I have goals will achieve, I've control, won't deceive

As I walk along the shores of raging oceans,
billions of dollars are spent on war machines,
Hidden stories of guided missiles, surface in the media.
The search for the perfect leader
crumbles in ones hands. The demon system
reaches all demands. The epidemic of poverty
and disease reaches an all time high.
