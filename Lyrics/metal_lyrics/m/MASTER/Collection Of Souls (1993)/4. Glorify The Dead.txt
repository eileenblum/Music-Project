You have seen the truth you've read the lies
It's been put in print what we despise
Lives all been destroyed negative press
Suicide induced under duress

Mediocre stabs at reason,
circus antics just completed
portraits of private liaisons,
secrets of the confrontation

Exploded in the press the twisted truth
Spotlight on your sins there's no excuse
Glorifies the dead the child abuse
The diligent reporters on the loose

Mediocre stabs at reason,
circus antics just completed
portraits of private liaisons,
secrets of the confrontation
