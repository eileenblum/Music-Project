The sickness he feels on the road, he misses his
family and home, the suburb of weakness he
fears, he'll be there all of his years

Nothing to live for, nothing to die for,
nothing to fight for, gifted with the silver,
Weak procrastinator!

Nothing to live for, nothing to die for,
nothing to fight for, gifted with the silver,
gifted with the silver spoon

The weakness he fights in the cold,
they think he's a local hero
Nothing to live for, nothing to die for
Blinded by those who don't know,
will he pick the way to go?
