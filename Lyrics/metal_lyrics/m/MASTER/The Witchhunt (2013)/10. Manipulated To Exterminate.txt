Once upon a time, there was a world with no inhibitions, no rules, no regulations
The world was naked to authoritarian rule, there was no predgidous, there was no will to kill

As violence escalates, It's time they said we do or die
As rhetoric continues, with the blinking of an eye

Excursions of evil, electrified to coincide with the pain
Eluding all people, suttle change goes unnoticed, when unnamed

The philosophy of those in charge
Free thinking was erased
Manipulated to exterminate
The weaker race

Fight the system, you can win freedom
Fight the system, you can find yourself
