The march has begun and the countdown it soon will arrive
As hospitals fill with the patients all waiting to die
The governments poisons administered daily on time
When will the people, completely just open their eyes

Deception breeds violence it's often the fuel for the hate
They suffer in silence reactions not seen on their face
The governments poisons administered daily on time
When will the people, completely just open their eyes

The final protocol will be, will be the death of us all
The final protocol will be, will be the death of us all

When will the actions speak louder than words
When will the actions speak louder than words

Scars of the past return
No one will ever learn
It's time for change the truth be told
It's time for change remove control
