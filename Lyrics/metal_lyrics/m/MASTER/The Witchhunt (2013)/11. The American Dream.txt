It's the American dream, really a horror story
Things appear not as they seem, delusions of grandeure remain
Aggression is always on the rise
And hatred will never go away
Watch as they suffer and they die
And they fight for their lives
People always dying in the streets
The gangs are in control
All the hoods they compete
Vying for space they can control
