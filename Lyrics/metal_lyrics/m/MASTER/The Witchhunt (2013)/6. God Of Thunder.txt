The lack of the attention to detail
Development was on a larger scale
An agent to remove the worst disease
The explosion brought the people to their knees

Where now, Where's the God of thunder and oppression
Bow down to the leader and prepare for suppression

The victims almost never are prepared
An ideology of all beware
Insatiable the lust, the power, the greed
Enthusiasm can't replace the need

Where now, Where's the God of thunder and oppression
Bow down to the leader and prepare for suppression

Let's all form a line and stand up straight
remember to salute me a smile upon your face
I'll be your mother, father, I'll command your fate
There's nothing to discover, we'll be the master race
