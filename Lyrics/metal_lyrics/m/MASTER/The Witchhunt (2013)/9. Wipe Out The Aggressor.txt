The root of all evil will always survive
The weak minded people, they always will die
Their slaughter is senseless, the deathly domain
To live is to suffer, to die is to change

Wipe out the aggressor and be free
Wipe out the aggressor and you'll see

The blood of the ancient, the sick sacrifice
Just blinded by tremors, they met their demise
If knowledge is power and might comes with strenght
In the final hour, no one was saved
