Deceptions in disguise, each day we live in fear
It's time to realize, the end is drawing near
In life we're born to suffer, in death we pay to die
We're taught to love each other, and drink the blood of Christ

A world that's filled with rascists
Religions on their side
A war of simple politics
Another suicide

In modern times still fascists
They cannot get along
The power of an addict
The death of everyone
