So involved in the plight of the uncommon man
Is it you who decides if he lives or he shant
What do you say is it time to expand the new way
Search your mind and you'll find the illusions the same.
The parable it's sounds exciting, the toilets full
It's all quite frightening
The parable is so enlightening just pay the toll
And be struck by lightning
Deception rest assured
Reflection is just absurd
