As the G8 soon discuss their plans of hate
Soon there will be nowher to escape
As freedom lingers next to the abyss
Your private thoughts no longer will exist

The time has come to stand and face your fear
And wipe away remove the whispers from your ears

The power of these people can't exist
It's time to veto evil with clenched fists
Refusal to believe the need for change
Is freedom simply flowing with the drain

The time has come to stand and face your fear
And wipe away remove the whispers from your ears

Unadultarated sacrilege, Filthy hands co-exist
Unadultarated sacrilege, Simply sick

Remove the power
Remove the power, it's the hour to devour all the tyrants simply push them into the abyss
