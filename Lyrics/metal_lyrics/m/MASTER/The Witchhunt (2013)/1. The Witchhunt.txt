They tried to construe their list of rules and lies
The people revolted there was no surprise
The witch hunt determined Ales was a spy
They cut his balls and hung him out to die

Silence, contained, violence, restrained

It's time to overthrow the USA
Remove the people from the war and pain
Still searching for that free society
Where all can live their life in liberty

Silence, contained, violence, restrained

Let's fight today with strenght and pride
Let's fight today for those who died
Let's fight today with strenght and pride
Let's fight today and push aside
