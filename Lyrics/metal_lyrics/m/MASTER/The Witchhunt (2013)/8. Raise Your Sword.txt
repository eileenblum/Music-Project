When push comes to shove, will you be prepared
To put on the gloves or run away scared from the demons of all
With the move to aggression, you cannot escape
The violence obssession we are all pitted against the established regime

Load your gun and hide your knife
Raise your sword get ready to strike

Men have been trained from an early age
To get up and face, face all your demons or wind up in cages
Along with the weak, the lonely oppressed, 
There is no time, there is no time to look back because really the future is yours
