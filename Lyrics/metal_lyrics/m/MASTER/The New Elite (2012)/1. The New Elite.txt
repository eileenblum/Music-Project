From the hellenistic face
comes the smile that betrays
a scripture filled with suffering
and educated lies

For years I've told the people as enslavement reared it's ugly head
for years I watched them struggle to embrace their daily bread
forget the church, forget the steeple, free thinking is nearly dead, nearly dead
the neglected future of this fallen race, the victims of the chosen will be saved

The sorrow and the suffering of the weak, tomorrow will belong to the new elite
For years I've told the people as enslavement reared it's ugly head
for years I watched them struggle to embrace their daily bread

forget the church, forget the steeple, free thinking is nearly dead, nearly dead
