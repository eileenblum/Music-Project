Remove the master and slave,
no longer someone to obey.
Recruitment can lower the cost,
fatalities no longer thoughts.

Light up the sky, quickly reload,
watch as they die for the rights of the oil.
I say light up the sky smile as you're told 
sit back and watch with your remote control.

Commanders are just put in place,
the soldiers are easily blamed.
The governments feed the machine 
as taxpayers simply complain.

Light up the sky, quickly reload,
watch as they die for the rights of the oil.
I say light up the sky smile as you're told 
sit back and watch with your remote control.
