The force of addiction can leave a man scorned,
Soon drunk with power.
They'll then fuel his storm,
The thoughts of an infant will soon fascinate,
As time passes on, and he molds a new race,
The demons of life left them lonely and scarred,
They reached for success, and altered their fate,
They'd given up their lives, on that infamous day.
Man beleved he was truly sincere,
The epitome of saviors are born every year,
The modern day Jesus had deceived them all,
Their lord and their master were simply so small

[Chorus]
Alice doesn't live any more,
David thought he'd even up his rage,
They followed Jesus to an early grave.
