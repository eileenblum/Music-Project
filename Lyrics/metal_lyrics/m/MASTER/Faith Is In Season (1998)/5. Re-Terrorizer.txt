Inside the building strategically placed
The plan is set forth to wipe out or erase
The victims unknowinly enter the door
The limbs are all mangled strewn out on the floor
The law is two sided the victims have rights
The rights of the victims are often ignored
The prisioners life is spent behind closed doors

[Chorus]
Terrorizer his face is weel know
Terrorizer the world is his throne
Many lives lost and who carries the cost
As the freindly skies suffer their fate
The outbreak of silence condoning the violence
The meak will all suffer their fate

[Chorus]

Re-Terrorizer his face is well known
Re-terrorizer the world is his thrown.
