Run run away, try to scape from the dark chequered past
Live for today, tomorrow is changing, and nothing will last
Lord of this world, where are you now?
Quick draw the line, the question of future is always the same
Symphonies of hate, the disease of faith is a question of time
Who will replace, the vision of he who will soon sacrifice

[Chorus]
Lord of this world, where are you now, a simple illusion,
A really good show,
It's the magician, or is this religion
Thr face with no name, the clear jar of flies
