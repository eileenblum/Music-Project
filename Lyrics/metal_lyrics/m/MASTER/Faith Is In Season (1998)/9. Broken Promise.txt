Thousands have died and they show no remorse,
Chose to become victims without recourse,
Madmen and fools are the children of God,
Emotionless creatures an evil facade,
Broken promise Broken promise,
Look in their eyes they die see they're only fools,
Lies and disguises that fly in the face of truth,
Who'll reprimand as their hands twist the face of man,
Who, ll pay the price with their lives when it's in demand,

Repeat Last Verse
