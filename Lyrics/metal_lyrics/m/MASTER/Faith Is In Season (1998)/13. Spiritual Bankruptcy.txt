There's a killer loose and a price on yor life,
There's a liar who tells you what's wrong or right,
The asylm's full and it's locked from outside,
Soul in bankruptcy just for the ride

[Chorus]
Follow the trail,
It's everywhere you want to be,
Work every day like a slave,
So you can afford to be free
