Expect the unexpected,
When gambling wuth your life,
The points are all connected,
I've seen it in his eyes,

[Chorus]
Is it worth your freedom,
To steal the daily fix,
It's difficult in this life,
To stand up to exist
Addicted to the pistol,
It's crippling your mind,
Someone blew the whistle,
And now your doing time

[Repeat Chorus]
