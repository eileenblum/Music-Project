I have seen the light, and I have changed my ways
I have learned to live, to fight for every day
I've found inside, the will to face my fear

[Chorus]
Do you want to die, I have the antidote
Do you want to die, has your life been so remote?
Contemplate the way, attempt the suicide,
We'll suply the means, the means to end your life
Is paradise in hell, has heaven been on earth?
Only time will tell, what your life's been worth

[Repeat Chorus]

Has your life been one big joke?
