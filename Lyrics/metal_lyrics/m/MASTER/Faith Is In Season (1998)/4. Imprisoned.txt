So many are imprisoned,
Copnfined inside themselves
Drawn the conclusions,
In their private bell
Hiding from the challenge,
The power to live free
Lacking any virtues,
Ability to feed
The lessons in denial,
Among the field of dreams
Illustrate survival,
And life among the weak
The world is everchanging,
Don't fall into the void
Step in the arena,
And let them hear your voice
Hiding from the shadows,
A weakness that's sincere
Your living in denial,
The stress of constant fear.
