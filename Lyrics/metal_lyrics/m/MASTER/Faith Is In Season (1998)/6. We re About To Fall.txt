Anger is mixing with terror,
Police always lining the streets,
Searching for endless adventures,
Stalking the land of the free,

[Chorus]
We're about to fall,
There's nothing left today,
We're about fall,
No-one will fuckin be saved,
There's talk about facing the nation,
It's chilling when it's face to face,
An idol that's been just a puppet.
Where violence is just common place.

[Repeat Chorus]
