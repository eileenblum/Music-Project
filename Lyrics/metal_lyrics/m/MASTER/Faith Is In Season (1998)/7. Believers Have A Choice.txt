Bloodles battles are raging,
In the arena of minds,
Crimes of deceit perpetrating,
Forcefeeding poisonous lies,
Misinformation is a virus,
Infecting the following herd,
The age of control is upon us,
Caged with ideas,
And chaimed by words,

[Chorus]
This has been a test,
Do not adjust your set,
Believers have a choice,
To follow or be lead,
It can't be a lie or a misprint,
Ive seen it here in black and white, In television we're trusting,
The power to teach wrong and right,
You need not share your opinion,
One will be given too you,
Sit down and shut up,
And wait for instructions,
You will be told what to do

[Chorus]

Please disregard all the vermin,
Those who speak not the good word,
Media lords will determinate,
All that is fit to be heard,
Now we return to our program,
Allready in progress you see,
Listen and lay close,
Sit down and shut up,
And be glad that your free
