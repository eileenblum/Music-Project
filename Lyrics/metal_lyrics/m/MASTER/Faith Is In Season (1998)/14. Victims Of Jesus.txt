Victims of Jesus, they stand by his side
Predicting the future, absorbing his lies
Bent on redemption, exploiting their faith
Claim a connection, the great christian race
Hail to the preacher, the richest one
Send your donations, support his sons
His promise to save you, just stand in line
Will he decieve you, or make time
Stand in his honor, their faith is their claim
Look over yonder, there is nothing to gain
