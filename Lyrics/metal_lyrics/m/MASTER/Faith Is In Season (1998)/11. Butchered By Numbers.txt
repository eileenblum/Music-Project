Families are ruined, blood has been spilled
Did Timothy do it, it was his free will
Butchered by numbers, his silent stoned face
Some were survivors, to his dismay
Militias preparing for governments rage,
He learned from the teacher,
He's setting the stage

[Chorus]
Stop pointing the finger, just look in the mirror
The end of your freedom,
It's drwing near
Supporting suppression, infringes your rights
Extort the confession, get ready to fight

[Repeat Chorus]
