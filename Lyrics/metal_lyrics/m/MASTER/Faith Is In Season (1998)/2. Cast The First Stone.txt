Out of the kingdom of darknes,
And into the kingdom of Christ,
Pray the great prayer of the scriptures,
Assure that you will be saved,

[Chorus]
The rapture is coming,
Pray for your friends
Will his arms open, will you be denied
The fires appoaching from ether,
The revelation soon fulfilled, An infant born to lead the people,
Working freely in our world

[Chorus]

Let he who is without sin then
The cast the stone,
He will lead the people triumphantly
To the new home, Will he set the captives free and
Those enslaved in sin,
He will save the Christians from The enemies til the end.
