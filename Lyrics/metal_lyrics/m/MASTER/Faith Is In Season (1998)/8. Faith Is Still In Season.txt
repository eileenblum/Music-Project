Pray to god almighty,
Ask him for a chance,
Will you find the reason,
Will you soon advance,
Ask the fallen angel,
You can make a choice Will you find the answer,
Ask your inner voice,

[Chorus]
Faith is still in season,
The world is terrified,
In these times of crisis,
The faith is still alive,
Is seeing is believing,
Then I have yet to see, the world has been decieving,
Have you heard the noise,

[Repeat Chorus]
