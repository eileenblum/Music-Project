The safety in numbers supplied.
Strife for an order, denied forced repression.
Tortures no longer apply,
Brainwashed to stand up, die a celebrated,
Life's the same,
Time's in vain.

Sectarian violence invites
The allied forces unite, The War on Terror.
Justice in risking their lives,
Brainwashed to stand up, die a celebrated,

Life's been changed,
Time's sustained.

Step aside! It's time for new blood.
Step aside! The mind is gone.
Step aside! It's time for new blood.
Step aside! It won't be long...
