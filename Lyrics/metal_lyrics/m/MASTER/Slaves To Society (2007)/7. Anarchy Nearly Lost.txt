Revolting for the cause, we're forced to fight.
Anarchy nearly lost, it's time we made a change.
Society's food for thought, as hundreds die,
Never living life, just simply wasted time.
The governmental haste, engraved in blood,
Machines have all replaced, the work that's done today.
Progress our downfall, the forced demise,
Humiliating all, technology's suicide.

Resist the new design. Dismiss a need for change.
Enlist a youthful mind. Existence is at stake.
Resist the new design. Revoke existing power.
Resist the need for change. Provoke the final hour.
