The eve of destruction, the presidential plague.
A simple conviction, the darkest age.
The candle is burning, the eternal flame.
Soon we'll extinguish,  what's left of the game.

Walking through shadows, they're blinded by fear.
Preparing for battles, the fight so sincere.
Such civilizations, criminally insane.
The final excursion, the end is in flames.

Strengthen the army of the north.
Take them and kill them with force.
