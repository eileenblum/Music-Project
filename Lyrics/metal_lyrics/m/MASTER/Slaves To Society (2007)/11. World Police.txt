The strategic uncertainty, unjustly ruled by world police.
A strange abnormality, surrounded by fools majority.

The time has come to strike them down,
 a world that's ruled with smiling clowns.
Let's face the truth, unleash the fire,
the end is near, what will transpire?
Assumption of blind loyalty, the exposure to violent disease.
Impressive the propriety, the destruction of society.
At ground zero a new building will be built,
and all the heroes
will come to terms, and absolve their guilt.
The time has passed,
but the nightmares still continue. Man must instill fear and terror
in the minds of his enemies. The shadow of hate is upon us.
It's followed us since the beginning of time.
