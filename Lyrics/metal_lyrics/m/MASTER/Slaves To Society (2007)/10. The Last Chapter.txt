The last chapters were written, will he return?
Many minds have been lost worshipping what they've learned.
In a web like a spider, sometimes fighting harder,
The poisons of life self induced social murder...

We're taught to trust in justice, a twist of fate that guides us.
In perils we've seen suffrage, the new age gods disgust us.

Bow down and pray to the Master of germs.
Such infections are waiting for you to discern.
The doctors creating the plague of return,
because man created gods, so that you would convert.
