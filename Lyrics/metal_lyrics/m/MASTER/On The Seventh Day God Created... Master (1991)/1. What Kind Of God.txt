What kind of god is senseless and weak
A product of mans own disease
Tormenting with lust, hatred and envy
A product of weakness that is worshipped daily

Funeral full of enemies
Watch the family gather stones
Funeral full of enemies
Victimised I'm left alone

What kind of god would just overlook this
What kind of god is just simply so sick
What kind of god could we put our thrust in
What kind of god is so ruthless and vain

Funeral full of enemies
The finger points to only one

Funeral full of enemies
They shift the blame to only one

What kind of god would just overlook this
What kind of god is just simply so sick
What kind of god could we put our thrust in
What kind of god is so ruthless and vain

Funeral full of enemies
Watch the family gather stones
Funeral full of enemies
Victimised I'm left alone

What kind of god would just overlook this
What kind of god is just simply so sick
What kind of god could we put our thrust in
What kind of god is so ruthless and vain
