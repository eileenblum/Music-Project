Pushed aside and left behind
Used again a second time
Built my trust and slipped away
Just to call another day

Used, Abuse, Misused, You loose
Erased, Misplaced, Disgraced, You've changed

A pedestal of godliness
Pulled the rug under my feet

Used, Abuse, Misused, You loose
Erased, Misplaced, Disgraced, You've changed
