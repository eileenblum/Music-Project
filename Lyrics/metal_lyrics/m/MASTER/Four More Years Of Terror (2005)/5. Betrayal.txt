He walked away, ever since there was a final trial
Nothing was said, nothing was revealed behind the smile
No proof of the crime, while the victims suffered in denial
A sign of the times, would the killer soon reveal his style

Trapped, Trapped, There is no escape
Trapped, Trapped, In this life of pain
The science of fools, Dr.Keller crafted his own vision
So often subdued, No-one contradicted his decisions
With limited space, experimenting with imprisoned humans
Simply maintained, Freedoms found in ways, so just excuse him

Betrayal, Betrayal
Watch as victims pacify and slowly die
