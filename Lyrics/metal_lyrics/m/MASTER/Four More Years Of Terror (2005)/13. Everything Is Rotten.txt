There has been a gross injustice
The guilty headed to a distant shore
Soon the media discussed this
Black Thursday would open up a door
Self absorbed no pain no sorrow
The rhythm of destruction played its beat
Was suicide the only motive
While body parts were gathered in the streets

Lies, Everything is rotten
Lies, Do you think I have forgotten
Lies, It's the day of reckoning
Lies, Everything has been so deafening
