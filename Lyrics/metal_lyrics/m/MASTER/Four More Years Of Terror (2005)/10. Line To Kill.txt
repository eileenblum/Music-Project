As I looked into the eyes of God
I thought I saw, saw it all
The prophecy soon fulfilled
Forming the line,line to kill

Crucify Christ, Turn day into night

Counting the days to forgive
Thinking of ways, ways to live
I stepped into the abyss
And I saw you, I insist

Crucify Christ, Turn day into night
Take Bush's advice
