No one is safe from the terrorist's fate
Was England dreaming during the GB
One day a winner a loser the next
After the summit what can we expect

Why don't they,Can't they see, Does one feel pain

Political progress can end in defeat
Commitment's are broken with different beliefs
Leaders make promises they cannot keep
Pockets are filled with their lies and deciet

A mirrored image of the past mistakes
Can our leaders all expect the blame
In silence the majority invades
Distorted values never are explained
Skepticism leads us all astray
After such attacks will there be change
For years such silent fits have been ignored
2005 the year of our dear Lord

Life sustains wealth
All remain in hell
