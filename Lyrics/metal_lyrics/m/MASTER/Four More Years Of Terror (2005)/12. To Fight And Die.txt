They fight for the right to engage
In war all the world is a stage
As cities are tested we wait
For Blair to complete his tirade
The casualties soon will out way
The triumph supposedly made
With George just assume we'll invade
With Donald there's nothing at stake

Creating enemies is what the US can do best
In silence contemplating profits, where they should strike next
Designing strategems to hide the truth from all the rest
The old man leading young men to embrace their violent death

Get up to march, to fight and die

Lock and load your rifle Soldier, Are we really in denial
Lock and load your rifle Soldier, No-one can expect a trial
