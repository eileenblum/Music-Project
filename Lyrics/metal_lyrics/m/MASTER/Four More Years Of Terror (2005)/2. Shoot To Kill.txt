Step on the toes of the righteous
The dignified pigs we deplore
In previous years they'd incite us
But once bitten not anymore
Intent on distorting their words
Indulging in such complication
Often unseen and unheard

Elections are fixed animations
Deceptions are filled with rewards
The sick suicidal encroachment
The timing we cannot afford

We're face with an authorization
The license to just shoot and kill
The innocent are presumed guilty
Officially mistakes are nil

Endangered, The species of deception
Angered, The victims of oppression
Endangered, The thoughts are all misguided
Angered, A world that's all one sided
