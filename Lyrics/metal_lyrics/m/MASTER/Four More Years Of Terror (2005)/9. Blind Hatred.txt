Americans have often been disliked
The end of terror is nowhere in sight
Supporting the Al Quaida no one knows
100 comb the streets as they explode

Hatred, Blind Hatred
Four more years of terror

A war based on deception is this right?
Insurgents line up to engage and fight
As blood flows Urban warfare shows its might
The citizens of Irak have no rights
