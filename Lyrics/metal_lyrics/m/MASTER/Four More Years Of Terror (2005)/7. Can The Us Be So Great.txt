Is the land free if it's ruled by the state
Different's not good as they cannot relate
The arm of the law within reach will invade
Will cell research a superior race

Fuck the USA today, An evil land that's filled with hat
Can the US be so great, When thousand's die in every state

The rich all get richer and never protest
When laws are created that do not exist
Then all-for-one becomes just-one-for-all
Four year and counting prepare for the fall
