Watch as his mind slips away
Will he survive one more day
A testimony of uncompromising will
Certainly a large void to fill

Look out, Look out
The puppet is pulling its strings
Look out, Look out
As fate has it, he'll probably win

Emotional sickness prevails
Sometimes a secret that ails
A faith in a superior one
It's ended, before it's begun
