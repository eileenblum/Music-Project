Breaking away from the mistakes we've made
Can we escape from all we've become
After the combat can we ever go back
Will freedom ever be the same
Or will Big Brother look over my shoulder
And dictate the way we should live
Soon they'll discover but will they uncover
The sins of the ones to forgive

The Beast Within
Can God explain how this began
The Beast Within
Such power from such mortal men
The Beast Within
The pride the force the negligence
The Beast Within
Shall we let the prayer's commence

Just look around at the walls that surround
Can we escape from all we've become
Or will a camera replace the stammerer
as he prepares to spill blood
