Father please forgive me for I think I have sinned
I've set fire to the falsifiers wearing the skin
Of a righteous holy shepherd
Who's just as blind and helpless as the flock of whores and lepers
He persuades into keeping his pocket full

(Father forgive me for I think I have sinned)

Give me all your money and tell me your sins
Dip you in my water you'll fit right in
So lift up your hands now all creatures below
Bow your heads and sing
Praise the Father the Son in the definitive host

It's contagious man I swear there must be something in the water
I feel like I'm the only one left and I'm a martyr
If you're thinking then it's treason if you question it's a felony
The words are from God but the Devil has got the melody

(Father forgive me for I think I have sinned)

Give me all your money and tell me your sins
Dip you in my water you'll fit right in
So lift up your hands now all creatures below
Bow your heads and sing
Praise the Father the Son in the definitive host

Break

Give me all your money and tell me your sins
Dip you in my water you'll fit right in

Give me all your money and tell me your sins
Dip you in my water you'll fit right in
So lift up your hands now all creatures below
Bow your heads and sing
Praise the Father the Son in the definitive
Praise the Father the Son in the definitive host
