Like a child watching puppets at a matinee
They don't see the hand controlling every move they make
Having too much fun to see
The man that's pulling all the strings
Hiding just beyond the curtain
Just beyond the curtain

You've got freedom you've got rights but know you're still a slave
You don't see the hand controlling every move you make
Step in line and you'll receive the worry free lobotomy
Waiting just behind the curtain

Happy and free as they all dance on a string
Let's turn the music up louder blocking out everything
While you help create
The all American hate
I'm not a puppet on a string
I'm not a candidate for this lobotomy

It's so much easier to laugh and look the other way
The power that be broadcast the image everything's okay
Nobody sees that there's a war
Happening right outside your door
They hide it just beyond the curtain
Beyond the curtain

Happy and free as they all dance on a string
Let's turn the music up louder blocking out everything
While you help create
The all American hate
I'm not a puppet on a string
I'm not a candidate for this lobotomy

No strings pulling me
Yeah

Like a child watching puppets at a matinee
They don't see the hand controlling every move they make
Having too much fun to see
The man that's pulling all the strings
Hiding just beyond the curtain
Just beyond the curtain

Happy and free as they all dance on a string
Let's turn the music up louder blocking out everything
While you help create
The all American hate
I'm not a puppet on a string
I'm not a candidate for this lobotomy
For this lobotomy
