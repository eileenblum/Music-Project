I'm the paper cut you've acquired as you're turning the page of your bible
I'm the venom of the snake when it bites through the heel as you stomp on it head
I'm the point at the end of the needle I'm the dirty dirty rotten and evil
I'm the heavy all but bearable weight of your conscience that rips you to shreds
I'm the reason you're scared to walk alone in the dark
I'm the struggle for breath that almost stops your heart
I'm the thoughts of regret that you have for all the shit you've done
Before you put your mouth around the gun

We don't need your prayers
There's no hope but we don't care
We've heard you say it a million times
Yeah we'll burn in hell
You can save your breath now 'cause we don't care

I'm the reflection in the mirror that you've grown to hate
I'm the bottle of jack that makes you question your faith
I'm the money you've made off of preying on the people in pain
While you preach the holy word in his name

We don't need your prayers
There's no hope but we don't care
We've heard you say it a million times
Yeah we'll burn in hell
You can save your breath now 'cause

We don't need your prayers
There's no hope but we don't care
We've heard you say it a million times
Yeah we'll burn in hell
You can save your breath now 'cause we don't care

I'm a rusty nail I'm a splinter
I'm a curse I'm the middle finger
I'm the trembling hand that grips the razor
Just before you touch it down to your skin

I'm the evil
Divisive and real
(I don't need your prayers)
I'm the evil
Divisive and real
(I don't need your prayers)
I'm the evil
Divisive and real
(I don't need your prayers)
I'm the evil
Divisive and real
(I don't need your prayers)
I'm the evil
Divisive and real
(I don't need your prayers)
I'm the evil
Divisive and real
(I don't need your prayers)
I'm the evil
Divisive and real
(I don't need your prayers)
I'm the evil
Divisive and real
We don't need your prayers

We don't need your prayers
There's no hope but we don't care
We've heard you say it a million times
Yeah we'll burn in hell
You can save your breath now 'cause

We don't need your prayers
There's no hope but we don't care
We've heard you say it a million times
Yeah we'll burn in hell
Save your breath 'cause we don't care
