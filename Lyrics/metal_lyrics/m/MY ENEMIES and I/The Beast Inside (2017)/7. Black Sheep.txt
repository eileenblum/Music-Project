My life is collapsing right before my very eyes
I am sick but I'm healthy I am dead but still alive
I don't want to talk about it or the end that it brings
I don't want to feel better no I don't want to feel a thing

This is Black Sheep Boy signing out
I've given up on this world there's nothing left for me now
Am I coming in clearly do you copy me now
This is Black Sheep over and out

In my skin I feel restless just remind myself to breathe
I am brave but I'm useless I am lost but I believe
Close my eyes for a moment well aware I'm still in drive
This is not what I've chosen this is not my kind of life

This is Black Sheep Boy signing out
I've given up on this world there's nothing left for me now
Am I coming in clearly do you copy me now
This is Black Sheep over and out

It's the same bullshit on a different day
It's all bullshit everything you say
Spiraling down down down
Spiraling down down
Spiraling down

My life is collapsing right before my very eyes

This is Black Sheep Boy signing out
I've given up on this world there's nothing left for me now
Am I coming in clearly do you copy me now
This is Black Sheep over and out

This is Black Sheep Boy signing out
I've given up on this world there's nothing left for me now
Am I coming in clearly do you copy me now
This is Black Sheep over and out
