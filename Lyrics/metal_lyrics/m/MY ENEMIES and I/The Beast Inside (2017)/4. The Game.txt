Convict me of sin
Please tell me again
How my life is just a test of my faith
Take me to a place where everyone's on display
Righteousness is all in how well you fake
I'm wasting my time with the pleasures of life
The body I inhabit's not even mine
If I don't plant all of my seeds in outdated beliefs
I'm gonna burn burn for eternity
Burn

I'm human
I'm broken
I've met a lot of shitty people who say
That you can take away my pain
From what I've seen
They're all in way more pain than me
I'm only a human
I'm broken
Tell me what I am supposed to believe
I'm only a human
I'm broken
Just show yourself and end this game

Be careful what you say
'Cause it might just seal your fate
Heed these words hold your tongue or you'll fry
You were created from filth
We are dirt with free will
But your decisions always come with a price
You're wasting your time with the pleasures of life
Eternal fate is all in what you decide
If you don't plant all your seeds in outdated beliefs
You're gonna burn burn for eternity
Burn

I'm human
I'm broken
I've met a lot of shitty people who say
That you can take away my pain
From what I've seen
They're all in way more pain than me
I'm only a human
I'm broken
Tell me what I am supposed to believe
I'm only a human
I'm broken
Just show yourself and end this game

We are human
We are dust
We are dust and to dust we shall return
We are human
We are dust
We are dust and to dust we shall return
We are human
We are dust
We are dust and to dust we shall return
We are human
We are dust
We are dust and to dust we shall return

I'm human
I'm broken
I've met a lot of shitty people who say
That you can take away my pain
From what I've seen
They're all in way more pain than me
I'm only a human
I'm broken
Tell me what I am supposed to believe
I'm only a human
I'm broken
Just show yourself and end this game

I'm only a human
I'm broken
I'm only a human
I'm broken
I'm only a human
I'm broken
I'm only a human
I'm broken
