I've got this headache never ending
I'm taken over by the cold dark nothing
Sharp piercing images a strange familiarity
Parodies clouding up your memory
Give in to me

The constant chatter filling my thoughts with hate
All reassuring me it's just too late
Nothing but black and gray never any other shade
Disarray nothing left to contemplate
No escape

Nothing can satisfy
The appetite of the beast inside
Nothing's going to save your life
You can't run this time

I used to have a name but I can't even remember the first letter
Visions defiantly always mouth it to me silently
Parodies clouding up your memory
Give in to me

Waves of static nerves fear and panic
As quickly as they came they vanish
Nothing but black and gray every single fucking day
Disarray nothing left to contemplate
No escape

Nothing can satisfy
The appetite of the beast inside
Nothing's going to save your life
You can't run this time

Nothing can satisfy
The appetite of the beast inside
Nothing's going to save your life
You can't run this time

I've got this headache never ending
I'm taken over by the cold dark nothing
Sharp piercing images a strange familiarity
I don't want to live this way chained up inside this cage
This heart's turned to stone
Rip my flesh from my bones
Let me fade away

Nothing can satisfy
The appetite of the beast inside
Nothing's going to save your life
You can't run this time

Nothing can satisfy
The appetite of the beast inside
Nothing's going to save your life
You can't run this time
