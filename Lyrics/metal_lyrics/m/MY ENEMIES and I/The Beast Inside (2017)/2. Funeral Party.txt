Dearly beloved
We gather here broken-hearted
To have a moment of silence for the recently departed
It was a long and slow ever so ugly and painful death
Of a washed up scene with hardly anything left

Fuck what you've heard of me
(They love to talk about it)
Fuck off and D I E
(Now let me hear you shout it)
Fuck this goddamn scene
(Now go and cry about it)
Eat shit and D I E
(Two faced bitch you had it coming)

Chisel away at me criticize me incessantly
Break the shell dissect every piece
Analyze and dispose of me
Put me out like that cigarette you stomped on the floor
Watch me rise from the ashes 'cause I've been here before

Fuck what you've heard of me
(They love to talk about it)
Fuck off and D I E
(Now let me hear you shout it)
Fuck this goddamn scene
(Now go and cry about it)
Eat shit and D I E
(Two faced bitch you had it coming)

Bring that shit
Yeah

Dearly beloved
We gather here broken-hearted
To have a moment of silence for the recently departed

Fuck what you've heard of me
(They love to talk about it)
Fuck off and D I E
(Now let me hear you shout it)
Fuck this goddamn scene
(Now go and cry about it)
Eat shit and D I E
(Two faced bitch you had it coming)

Fuck what you've heard of me
(They love to talk about it)
Fuck off and D I E
(Now let me hear you shout it)
Fuck this goddamn scene
(Now go and cry about it)
Eat shit and D I E
(Two faced bitch you had it coming)
