Throw the dirt on top of me
I'm nothing more than the shadow of a memory
Fuck am I saying
I'm an irrelevant waste of space
Waste of life dragging you down with me
This whole damn time

Give me a knife
To cut these stitches out
I'm 'a let it bleed
'Til I'm rid of the sadistic dreams
I helped you get through
But where the fuck were you
When I was left broken
Bashing my heart with a hammer?

Save your goodbyes
I'm not worth it
You're so perfect
I don't deserve this
I'm worthless
Burn me alive
I deserve it
I'm not worth it
You're so perfect
Perfect

I'm just a goddamn parasite
Feeding on every little hateful word you lie
Fuck are you saying
With you it's all in black and white
Gray is all I got
It's all or nothing
You never change

Give me a knife
To cut these stitches out
I'm 'a let it bleed
'Til I'm rid of the sadistic dreams
I helped you get through
But where the fuck were you
When I was left broken
Bashing my skull with a hammer?

Save your goodbyes
I'm not worth it
You're so perfect
I don't deserve this
I'm worthless
Burn me alive
I deserve it
I'm not worth it
You're so perfect
Perfect

Throw the dirt on top of me
Bury me
I'm nothing more than the shadow of a memory
So don't push me
Don't push me

Give me a knife
To cut these stitches out
Give me a knife
To cut these stitches out
Give me a knife
To cut these stitches out
Give me a knife
To cut these stitches out

Save your goodbyes
I'm not worth it
You're so perfect
I don't deserve this
I'm worthless
Burn me alive
I deserve it
I'm not worth it
You're so perfect
Perfect

Save your goodbyes
Save your goodbyes
Save your goodbyes
I'm not worth it
Worthless
Burn me alive
Burn me alive
Burn me alive
You're so perfect
Perfect
