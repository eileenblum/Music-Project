So exhausting seeking approval never happy or satisfied by me
I'm fucked up tired of trying to be perfect and waiting to receive your blessing

What do you want now
(What do you want)
(What do you want)
Is this good enough now
(What do you want)
(What do you want)
I'll never let you down
(What do you want)
(What do you want)
What do you want now
(What do you want)
Is this good enough now
(What do you want)

I am no one just a puppet I'm your doormat your servant I'm your instrument
You can play me if you want to or tuck me away when you prefer me silent

What do you want now
(What do you want)
(What do you want)
Is this good enough now
(What do you want)
(What do you want)
I'll never let you down
(What do you want)
(What do you want)
What do you want now
(What do you want)
Is this good enough now
(What do you want)

Pat me on the back and say
I've been the perfect boy today
I swear I'll always find a way to make you proud

Nothing's ever good enough for you
I hate the things that you're making me do
Nothing's ever good enough for you
I hate the person I'm turning into
Nothing's ever good enough for you
I hate the person I'm turning into
I hate myself for ever trusting you
I hate myself for ever loving you

Is this heavy enough now
(What do you want)
I don't give a fuck now
(What do you want)
Am I edgy enough now
(What do you want)
I don't give a fuck now
(What do you want)
Am I pretty enough now
(What do you want)
(What do you want)
What do you want now
(What do you want)
I don't give a fuck now
(What do you want)
