Why would you want to escape
Already made the accommodations for you to stay
The ropes are tight but if you give it a couple of days
You'll see that it's better this way
I'll keep you safe locked away from the bad dreams

Said that you'd rather be dead
Been more than merciful I'm keeping you healthy and fed
Keep you alive I know that it can be hard at the start
Your eyes will adjust to the dark
Steady 'til death stops the beating of your heart

Cast aside your memories
'Cause soon I know you'll learn to love me
You're mine no way you'll desert me
'Cause soon I know you'll learn to love me

Seems you've been trying to leave
Maybe it's time I take a hammer to both of your knees
Now you can choose a life of pain and sedation or be complacent whatever you please
I'll keep you safe locked away from the bad dreams

Look at the mess that you made
I see the color of your skin is beginning to fade
Your lips are cold and turning blue but I'm happy to say
I'm loving the way that they taste
Oddly enough you're more beautiful this way

Cast aside your memories
'Cause soon I know you'll learn to love me
You're mine no way you'll desert me
'Cause soon I know you'll learn to love me

Cast aside your memories
'Cause soon I know you'll learn to love me
You're mine no way you'll desert me
'Cause soon I know you'll learn to love me

Why did you want to escape
Already made the accommodations for you to stay
The ropes were tight but if you gave it a couple of days
You'd see it was better that way
I kept you safe locked away from the bad dreams

Said you would rather be dead
Was more than merciful by keeping you healthy and fed
Kept you alive I knew that it would be hard at the start
Your eyes would adjust to the dark
Steady 'til death stopped the beating of your heart
