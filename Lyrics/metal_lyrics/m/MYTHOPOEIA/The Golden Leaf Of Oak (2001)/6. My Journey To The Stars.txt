This is my journey to the stars

On a hill I stand
In the gate to the sky,
To the golden Sun, to the silver Moon.
On angelic wings with time I fly.
On a hill I stand,
this is my journey to the stars.

Among the stars I fly.

Constellation of the deads is red.
I dream in the space of cosmic nymphs.

On a hill I stand,
This is my mystic journey to the stars.
