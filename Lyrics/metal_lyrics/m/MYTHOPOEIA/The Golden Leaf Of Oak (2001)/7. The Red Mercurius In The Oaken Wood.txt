Look at the roots of the old hollow oak as they are changing into dung

The light reviving sounds in the body
Heaven's shape of Orion, his flaming
Conceit walksin the golden rays of Sun
Cheerful are beings from the cross
Flaming sigh the body miracle
A Great dipper takes up its wings
Open spells escapes there
Circling stones melt in vibrations

Look at the roots of the old hollow oak as they are changing into dung
Look at green leaves that are changing into golden ones when both 
snakes bit into tails

Raise your head and you'll see the child is flying with golden wings
