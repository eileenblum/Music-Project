Traces of camel hoofs
Turban, bent sword and sand
Glory, honour and wisdom
Commercial way leads to west

Traces of horse hoofs
Helmet, straight sword and cross
Glory, honour and victory
War way leads to east

Crossed swords, templar forts
Blood on sand, broken standarts
Erratic knights are confused in hearts
On wings of vultures (their) suffering is circling

Bloody harness and pain of wounds
Joyful feeling from shout of seagulls
Fire in hearts on dromonds of freedom
Hearty arm of Old continent

White field and red cross
Silver moon is dancing in fire
Pain of wounds is changing into wisdom
In arm of Old continent
