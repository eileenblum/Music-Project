Volant attire in the tops of breeding places
Raven's bill in the hollow of roots
Feathers of young ones lost in thorn
Look hears entrails of body

Rotten carcass in hungry pool
Damp ground entices males
Seeds are dancing from the top of stem
Breath of sun is sucked up by nostrils

Ron poloh tahu ruky hatasdu
Chamlat sobci v dune reky
V poli vardan znaky neleti
Pachorud zarazi, naluba nori
