King's entering into a temple of vibrations
Fire of passion puts together bodies
Ancient power will lights up heart
One word is a spring of the fusion

King's entring into a temple of flowers
He's looking on circling feelings in bodies
Serpent's wings are rising up
Grooved sculpture invocates mixing

King's entering into a temple of light
Burning peaks will come into flowers in waves
Golden rain is taking to the height
Sheding arrows are flooding spaces

King's walking out from a temple knowledge
Words veiled into the truth
Stream of silence is whirling into changes
Shores of trance dance into joy
