I am not and I will be not pure and even so I am calling You 
Laviah, how mighty is your song 
Give a sound to my thoughts 
Laviah, how mighty is your song 
How saints go, how black ones go, You understand to the black sacrament 
Laviah, how mighty is your song 
You are almighty in music and poetry 
and so I have not to praise God 
I hate him and You will be to hate in that moment with me

Laviah...Laviah...Laviah...

So mighty is my calling to You 
Laviah... 
I always will be to invoke your name 
and music is my...
