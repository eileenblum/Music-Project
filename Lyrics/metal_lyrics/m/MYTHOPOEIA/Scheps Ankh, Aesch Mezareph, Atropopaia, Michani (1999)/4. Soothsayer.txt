My saviour, keeper of my wishes 
the burning candle drips blood 
in every part of body is thorn of destiny

Lifeless is easy life in circle 
Tell, what do you see behind the shadow of mirror 
maybe, what is my power of stones 

Tell, my carnage, my enemy, my mayhem

Ways of past are crying under the weight of wings 
magic ball is full of water with colour of steel

Staff with traits of my face with - a grining smile 
Disclosing of mask can - ritual 
Digger with hood is coming pagan fear - over dish of vine 
Smell of virility, smell of feminity - womb is put together - You Soothsayer
