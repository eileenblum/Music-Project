Oom posmon oom - en oe uru ni 
- neuech omun chom 
- haach nomeech om 
- hee noeum vrch hee

Driping blue wash off the suffer 
lovely are shields of basess love 
finger roars by flares up of thought word 
distant luck from desire of floating pains

Oom posmon oom 
Oom posmon oom

Flower of pleasure of huming bodies of freedom 
shores of infammable landscapepicture of pointworld 
key of angel wings of lightly blue 
secret pregnancy by cosmic breath

Touching of eternal driping silence
