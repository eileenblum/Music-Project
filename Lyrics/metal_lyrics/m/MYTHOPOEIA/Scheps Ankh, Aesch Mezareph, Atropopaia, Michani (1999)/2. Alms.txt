Ice in your eyes, flame in my heart...alms of our loneliness! Forgotten! 
If you have, have a soul...mistaken soul 
You donit cover a grief...hateful grief 
Above my invisible dream...most beautiful dream

A curtain turns up...over the heads of sillers 
unselfish respect...and opera begins

A conductor raises the baton...psalm of fate was completed 
prudent delusion...from veil of experience

Elicting sensual strike...penetrating sound 
false note...settlement with death 
death!

If you donit recognize mind...outspoken mind 
You donit see the truth...mendacious truth

Above my solitary scream...blind scream 
The black clouds, darkness of heart, lighning from clean sky 
Desperate alms, mirrors of the past, part from symbolic trust 
The eternal fame, suffering of innocence, voluntary departure from life

The moment of succes...on the edge of my loyalty 
infinite applause...flowers fall on platform

The last bow...neverending symphony of silence 
if you feel the touch...unrealy touch

You donit know emptiness...immortal emptiness 
over my merciless inhumanity...dauntless inhumanity

My hate...My trust...My spirit of the God 
My pain...My grief...My lies of your horror 
My dream...My soul...My shadow on the wall 
My anger...My pleasure...My lock on your treasure
