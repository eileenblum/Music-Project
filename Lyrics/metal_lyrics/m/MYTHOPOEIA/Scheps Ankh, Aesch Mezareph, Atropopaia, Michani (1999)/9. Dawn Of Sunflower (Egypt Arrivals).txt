Pekelna vasen neprojde zrcadlem

Ohen, Ohen, Ohen

Mysteries of hiding-places, brisk sacramnet 
Deep knowledge, presence of myths

Vapours of redolent cloudlets from vessel are divesting 
Swallowing stream is dissolwing the flow 
Plundering stop is sifting the corn of life 
Knowledge disclaimed sight of cosmic rainbow 
Without waterside is solitude of fruit of sight 
Lost thoughts of open emptinesses 
For love are cutted off the eye-lids of Gods 
Fruits of elements feel their beat 
Pebbels of colours repose on bottom of streams 
Watching gate is dawning to men 
Tender mystery, to give birth and die into rose

Cross of world eat sacrifices of the strokes 
Runner will wound his soles on notions 
Cramps of inbornations fly away through the spiral and back 
Flowers are symbol of the following

Tajemno skrytych mist posvatnosti,
Hluboka moudrost zvecnelych mytu,
Pro lasku jsou uriznuta vicka Bohum
a kvety jsou symbolem pristiho.
Nezne tajemstvi dava zrozeni a smrt v ruzi,
Pekelna vasen neprojde zrcadlem...
