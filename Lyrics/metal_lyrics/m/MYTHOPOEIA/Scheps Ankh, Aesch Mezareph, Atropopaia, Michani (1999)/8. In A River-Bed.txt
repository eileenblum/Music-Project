Oldman and oldwoman, Moon and Sun 
Rainbow arms of falling stars and leaves 
Ancient dust is washed off from Queen 
Sunset over shadow of my eyes 
Dark indiansummer with many hue of black 
It's twilight

It's twilight

Dish of the defeating, how forunate chance, 
Depositing and muddy, far river-bed

Of sighing details - eternaly transfering 
Belt of grain of reproachness is cutted 
Dirty poverty of celtic existence 
Frontiers of poison are signport of zodiac

Slack by wandering on mountainridge 
For precious coral...

Stitch of warrior is commited by wet shrub 
Noble is swamp of difficulties and shame

Puls is impossible ant to limp by spear 
Eighteenth tabu is matter and nature 
Oldman and oldwoman, Moon and Sun 
Rainbow arms of falling stars and leaves

Sunset over shadow of my eyes 
Dark indiansummer...itis twilight 
Serr siabhar ritu 
Oen dunam mathir 
Ord siabhar tromi
