Face of born is flaying down to depths 
Spiral feeds fire of sun 
Gods float by oceans of worlds 
Nakedness of staining is palting the heavenly

Hard touches by words of rebellion 
Circles are hold into cosmic vibrations 
Brown past scatters the flames 
Bosom of earth receives combined passions

Myths are circling in a curve of light 
White flowers were beat by animalness of doms 
Fruits of spirit of grace drifts 
Lightly filler, space of flame EO
