Abysses of traditions are deceiving today 
The divine wheelwork is dawning freedom

Ornate bodies by burning fire 
Wild changes of circling phantoms 
Colour lights are longing for a man 
Spoilness is founding, is loosing emblem

Demons in the cosmic law of the changes

Reojicing of lights is fear from darkness 
Mane of flight is blooming in the hope 
Hammer is swilling under the brow of quite 
Touches are presing fury of elements
