We greed for really everything
Want more but it wonât change a thing
Still we are just so unfulfilled
And for that shit we raped and killed

In this content? our world goes mad

Controlled by fear and hatred
Forced to consume
This path of utter madness
Will lead us into doom

Divorced from reality
Buy shit that we donât really need
Blind led into our misery
Unsatisfiable greed

Upon their graves no one shall cry
This scum deserves to die
