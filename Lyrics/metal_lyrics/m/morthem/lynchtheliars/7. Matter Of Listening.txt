Bla Bla, is what they say
Bla Bla from any side anyway
They talk but they will never hear
As long they talk with blocked ears

Nothing
Will change
When we fear

What we
All donât
Wanna hear

Wake up
All you
Who are deaf

Donât you
Hear us
Hear us scream

Itâs just a matter of listening

Donât turn your back on me
Listen what I have to say
Donât even dare to walk away
Got any balls, be tough and stay
