Born and raised
Praised and kissed
Or beaten down and ruled by fist

It doesnât matter after all
Another step to our downfall

In your mind, grows some kind
Of constant ban, to kill a man

What is meant, wont dissent
So began, to kill a man

Cruelty is in your mind
Brings fuckinâ vengeance to mankind
Deliverance wonât be found
At least to death we all are bound

Close the book on humanity
Bath your soul in misery
Men, women and children
Kill as many as you can

No more mercy, no remorse
This is our natureâs course
Pull the trigger, finish it
A bullet with your name on it
