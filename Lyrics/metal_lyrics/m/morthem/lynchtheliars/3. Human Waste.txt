Deformed...is your body
cause your bones are broken
Heated metal burned through skin

Fleshwoundsâ¦full of maggots
Your heart is standing still
Slowly rotting after youâve beenâ¦

Thrown away
Like human waste
Itâs not your fault
Just fucking fate

Born as a victim, you never had a chance
All your decisions, just pointed to this end

putrefy, destiny, agony, heresy
Misery, prophecy, scream for me, die for me

Tortured and strangled
And wounded to death
You rot in your own filthy puke

At least you are lost
And never got missed
No one will care about you
