Damn, whatâs going on?
All moral gone
Canât you see it
There is something wrong

What weâre here for
I donât know it
Whereâre we going
I donât know it
What is all sense
I donât know it
Soulless machine
I donât decline it

So we suffer
For peace and our future
We all are
Bearing torture

Life, is so obscure
But so damn real
Death, it seems we challenge it
With a smile on our faces

But we are losing control, and we keep on going
Like a sellout of our souls

Hey, sellout of souls
2 for 1, special pack, now with double ignorance

Hey, sellout of souls
Half the price! Everything out! Morality? Donât think about!

Puppets we are, out of control
Living our lives without care
And when we lose, something worth
We shout that life isnât fair

Day after day, night after night
Weâre threatened by our inner greed
No way is too long, no mountain to high
Not even too cruel our deeds
