Sometimes
You feel a change inside of you
Sometimes it feels that youâre not longer yourself

Maybe
It is just irresistible
But it seems to be more than you see

All by yourself but not alone
You fear the moment losing control

Through eyes
Which donât belong to you
You see the world behind broken glass

From deep down inside your soul
hate and wrath arise

flee
All by yourself but not alone
flee
You fear the moment losing control
flee
It is in you, itâs inside you!
flee
You fear the moment itâs coming through

Make it stop
