Like puppets we are
In this world
Pulled on strings and worth just shit

Kept ignorant, stupid and blind
All they care for is profit

Our lives forced to obey and we donât even care
All the time we didnât live but live is whatâs so rare

Lynch the liars

Revolt and tear it all apart
All authority will burn in hell

Strip, rape, hang them!

Fuck them, we donât even give a shit on
All the lies that theyâre telling
They only think about their own wealth

Forcing others into deepest poorness
With words, which are almost senseless
Winding their tongues in lies
