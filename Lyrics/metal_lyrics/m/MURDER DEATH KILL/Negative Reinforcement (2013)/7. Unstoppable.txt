You can try to fucking stop us
We will never stop until our hearts stop
Your attempts are fucking useless
It's now your army against ours

You started this war
Let's see how strong you are
You thought we would crumble under pressure
Our hearts beat with hate for your world

Now with our numbers you're under pressure
Don't back down now, we have just begun
Don't act like a bitch
Don't back down now, we have just begun

You've tried to shut us down for far too long
It ends tonight
There's nothing you can do
You've tried to shut us down for far too long
It ends tonight
There's nothing you can do

No apologies
You started this fucking war
Don't back down now, we've just begun

You opened your mouth
Now settle the score
Man up to the shit you started
No more talking
It's time to start a war
Man up to the shit you started
We will never back down
We can never be stopped

We can never be stopped
Our friends don't let friends fight alone
We can never be stopped
Our friends don't let friends fight alone
