The line has been crossed in the form of a blade across your throat. Blood for blood, bucket by bucket - we'll paint this place fucking red. Everyone's a fucking victim. There's no way out from this place. Where do you go when death forgets you. You have no place to call home. Experience desertion and solidarity. For every action there's a consequence. You thought it was bad before. There's no more progress. Redemption ceases to exist. Disease has covered the weak. The guilty walk the fuck alone. No matter how hard you try - you cannot wash this blood from your hands.
