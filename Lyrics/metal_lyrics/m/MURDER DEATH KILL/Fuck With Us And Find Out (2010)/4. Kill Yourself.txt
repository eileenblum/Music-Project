Run your mouth - you're no better than me. Keep on talking - you're gonna fucking bleed. The pain you feel you brought upon yourself. You're useless go - fucking kill yourself. Your lungs begin to swell until they fucking burst. Your flesh starts to melt away from your fucking bones. Your existence is like a hammer to my head. Your mouth's been shut for eternity . Unbroken - you can't stop us. We're killing everything. Fuck with us and find out - we're wolves amongst the fucking sheep. The bodies being to stack up until they block out the sun. No one can fucking save you. Welcome to the life of death. They ignite on fire. Screams of pain fill the air. Massacre has new meaning - no one will be left behind. You're gone - we have buried you. You're gone - go fucking kill yourself.
