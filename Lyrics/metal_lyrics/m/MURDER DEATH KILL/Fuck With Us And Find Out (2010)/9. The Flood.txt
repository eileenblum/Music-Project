It engulfs everything in its path. Nothing or no one is fucking safe. We watch as the bodies float by. Existence is failing. The blame is all on you. Watch as the mountains drown and the clouds black out the sun. The end has begun. Forget the fallen - the buried and washed away. Catastrophe describes it all - complete annihilation. They try to stay afloat as they're picked off one by one. You've never seen violence quite like this. You've never known pain until now. Unbelievable carnage spreads across creation. Sink or swim motherfucker I've made my choice. Unstoppable like a storm is how my heart beats. That's the difference between me and you. I can't be stopped and you're dead in the water.
