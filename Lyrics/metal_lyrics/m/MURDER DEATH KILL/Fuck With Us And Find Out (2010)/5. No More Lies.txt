My eyes are wide open watching you move in silence. A life taken for granite - a waste of air we fucking breathe. Vengeance is running through my veins. You can't take what's been earned. There's no remorse for bottom feeders. Everyday you got to watch your back. The killer's on the hunt. You prepare for the worst as I unleash war on your head. They analyze the crime scene at the base of your skull. They find signs of forced entry. A coward has lost his fucking mind. No more tongue - no more lies.
