You survive on the back of my creation. You're gonna be exposed for what you truly are. This is my world. This is my game. You're clueless to every fucking thing. You can never be like me. You're just an obstacle in my way. I found direction and it's right through you. I am unstoppable - you're dead where you stand. I am gonna make you a memory - that we can't wait to forget. I'll leave you bloody and broken. You're better off dead to me. I have peace of mind - your life is taken. I live life day by day. Fuck the past it's all about now. Fuck you it's all about me. I look out for number 1.
