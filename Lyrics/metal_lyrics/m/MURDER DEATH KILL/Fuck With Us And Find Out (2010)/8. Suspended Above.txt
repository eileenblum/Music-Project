Suspended high above atop the highest spot I've found. I've waited so long to get you here. I've waited so long to show you fear. Existence is only a fucking word you're forced to live by. Existence is only a fucking word - we'll take it away. Your life begins to flash in front of your eyes as you fall to the floor. Your blood paints the streets below. The witnesses are left in disbelief. Everyone's perfect world shattered in the blink of an eye. What on earth would do these senseless killings with no regard. There's no face to blame - they blindly point fingers. Your face to face with the thing you've tried to put away for so long. I am right fucking here.
