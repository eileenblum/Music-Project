I am the end of everything you used to know. I am destruction - to me you're nothing. Your world has become ground fucking zero. Every line of defense has fucking failed you. You are the one to blame for the choices you have fucking made I know you won't forget again not to fucking cross me. I can hear your heartbeat I can sense your fear. No matter where you hide I will fucking find you. I will make you endure true fucking pain. The silence is deafening once you've stopped screaming.
