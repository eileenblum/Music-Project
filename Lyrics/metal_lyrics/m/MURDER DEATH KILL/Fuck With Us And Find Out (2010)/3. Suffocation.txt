The sight of you disgusts me. You walk blindly through the life that's handed to you. There's no turning back now - it's only forward from here. Hope for you has faded away. Death is staring you in the face. I'll acuate you with suffocation. Feel the cold steel of a knife tearing through your throat. Try hard to take your last breath before your lungs fill with blood for what you've done. Your brains cover every inch of my walls. This is a nightmare you won't wake up from. You'll cry no more tears. You'll fear no more pain once you've bled out you'll burn for what you've done.
