Take a look around you. These walls you hide behind. You try to find escape. Come to terms that this is your fucking fate. Tears of blood stream down your face. Your breath grows shallow. The things you thought kept you safe will eat you alive. Death is on the horizon - taking back unclear souls. There's no more sanctuary - your remains turn to dust. A clear cut path in my vision. Step by step - I am closer to glory. No one can hold me back from unwalked chapters in my story. Time heals all wounds or so they say. You hope it's true - the reality is no amount of time can save you.
