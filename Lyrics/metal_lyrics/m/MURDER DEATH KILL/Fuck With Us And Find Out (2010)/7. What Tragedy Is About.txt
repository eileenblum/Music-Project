Blood and pain is all I know - it's what surrounds me. My life's like a monster constantly pushing me. I won't give up until nothing's left standing. Now you will understand what tragedy is about. Unbridled agony and the stench of death fills the air. The march of the dead has begun - they await the beast. Witness this armageddon - eradication in mass form. The pollution boils away. Your world is falling apart. The rules no longer apply for the ones left behind. They all pray for an ending as the taste of blood fills their mouths.
