I am open minded to my surroundings everything is changing around us. Don't trust anyone anymore - your own blood will cut your throat. This place is run by corruption. Blood dropping blood just to come up hard. This is a fucked up place we live in where the predator becomes the prey. Your walls are stained with red. Yellow tape marks another homicide. Another body found - chalk marks the sidewalk. I live by an eye for an eye. I make a promise - I keep my word. Just when you think you got away - you'll find your head disconnected.
