[Lyrics: L. Harrison; music: Monstrosity]

A burning grave of undying pain
habitual process of conquering doom
This path of tortures is travelled slow
Victims of chronic afflictions are ruined

Living and dying is one in the same
Their flesh is now battered beaten and torn

Bloodlust
Descent through [misprinted as "trough" in CD liner notes] flames
A storm of sin
exploding through the earth
Feel the burns
Caress [misprinted as "carress" in CD liner notes] the body
skin is smoldering
transcending death

Crave the blood
exalted one
Entity
of the Imperial fire

Shadows entwine domination aligns
Scorn is now cast by a hell-fire blast
Behold the sins discharging mass hate
The dead are controlled their bodies are raped

Condemned by thoughts that have surrounded me
Betrayal against my soul is now complete
Altered reason cascades disbelief
My existence [misspelled as "existance" in CD liner notes] succumbs to a rage
of spite

Crave the blood
exalted one
Entity
of the Imperial fire

Shadows entwine domination aligns
Scorn is now cast by a hell-fire blast
Behold the sins discharging mass hate
The dead are controlled their bodies are raped

Crave the blood
exalted one
Entity
of the Imperial fire

Shadows entwine domination aligns
Scorn is now cast by a hell-fire blast
Behold the sins discharging mass hate
The dead are controlled their bodies are raped

A burning grave of undying pain
habitual process of conquering doom
This path of tortures is travelled slow
Victims of chronic afflictions are ruined

Living and dying is one in the same
Their flesh is now battered beaten and torn
