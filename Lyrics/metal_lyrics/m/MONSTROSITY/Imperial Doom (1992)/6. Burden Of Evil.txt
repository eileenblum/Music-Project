[Lyrics: L. Harrison; music: Harrison / Van Erp]

The light does not shine for me
illumination of my darkest fear
burning cries [misspelled as "crys" in CD liner notes] from beyond the shadows
screaming whispers only I can hear

Hatred burns with flames of disgust
your grinding death becomes so clear
a smoke-screen of confining greed
clouded vision fogs your memory

These fallen victims
now disdained
swarming evil cries
they beck you on
Your faith soon dies
it's ripped in two
desecration infiltrates [misprinted as "infultrates" in CD liner notes]
and has now broken through [misprinted as "though" in CD liner notes]

The winds of sorrow
bleed through the air
infested with pollutants
it's far too late to care
The sky is now filled with chemicals
Full with toxic particles

The light does not shine for me
illumination of my darkest fear
burning cries [misspelled as "crys" in CD liner notes] from beyond the shadows
screaming whispers only I can hear

These fallen victims
now disdained
swarming evil cries
they beck you on
Your faith soon dies
it's ripped in two
desecration infiltrates [misprinted as "infultrates" in CD liner notes]
and has now broken through [misprinted as "though" in CD liner notes]

The light does not shine for me
illumination of my darkest fear
burning cries [misspelled as "crys" in CD liner notes] from beyond the shadows
screaming whispers only I can hear

These fallen victims
now disdained
swarming evil cries
they beck you on
Your faith soon dies
it's ripped in two
desecration infiltrates [misprinted as "infultrates" in CD liner notes]
and has now broken through [misprinted as "though" in CD liner notes]

The winds of sorrow
bleed through the air
infested with pollutants
it's far too late to care
The sky is now filled with chemicals
Full with toxic particles
