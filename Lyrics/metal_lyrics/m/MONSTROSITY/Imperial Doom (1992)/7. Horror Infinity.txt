[Lyrics: L. Harrison; music: Monstrosity]

Bloodspray, Slaughter
a prophecy of traumatic despair
Echoes of promise
now parasite infested
they feast upon your flesh
Eternal horror

Abysmal sights
of the final seize
oppressing [misspelled as "opressing" in CD liner notes] lives
lurid memories
Days are lost
and filled with hate
encased in ruin
guilt ridden fools

Our destiny in fallen ruin
fear subsides, we travel through
Faded skies [misspelled as "skys" in CD liner notes] now bequeath [misspelled
as "bequeth" in CD liner notes]
this timeless torture violates

[Chorus:]
"Horror infinity
Shrouded destiny
Pain is all we see
Life it cannot be"

The winter's [misspelled as "winters" in CD liner notes] storm
takes us all
a blast of fire
makes it's call
dark depression
sweeps the streets
burning all
the task complete

witness [misprinted as "wittness" in CD liner notes] anguish, revolutions pass
the invocation of revelations cast
Spawn of horror, endless well
our burning coffins shipped straight to hell

[Repeat chorus]

Through deepest valleys of distorted thought
Clutching for reason we've harnessed our fall

Abysmal sights
of the final seize
oppressing [misspelled as "opressing" in CD liner notes] lives
lurid memories
Days are lost
and filled with hate
encased in ruin
guilt ridden fools

Our destiny in fallen ruin
fear subsides, we travel through
Faded skies [misspelled as "skys" in CD liner notes] now bequeath [misspelled
as "bequeth" in CD liner notes]
this timeless torture violates

[Repeat chorus]
