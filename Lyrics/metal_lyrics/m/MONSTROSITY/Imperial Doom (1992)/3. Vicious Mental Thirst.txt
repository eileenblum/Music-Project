[Lyrics: L. Harrison; music: Monstrosity]

Dismal. Fears that I have known
haunt me. Words cannot express
my torture. I mourn reality
Conceal, the scars of yesterday

Defamed, pain seeping from my wounds
Shatter, the boundaries of the mind
Apocalypse, I bring the fall of time
Crippled, by shadows in my mind

Destroy Me !

Nightmares, encircled by delusion
Spinning, a subconscious web of sadness
Obsessed, with altercations of the mind
Disturbed, my sense [senses?] are malign

Dark prayers swelter in my brain
A boiling hate devours my sanity
I shall never be the same

Dismal. Fears that I have known
haunt me. Words cannot express
my torture. I mourn reality
Conceal, the scars of yesterday

Destroy Me !
