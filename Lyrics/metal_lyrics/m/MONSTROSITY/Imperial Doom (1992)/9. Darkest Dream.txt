[Lyrics: L. Harrison; music - Monstrosity]

A civilization has now become
The seeds are sewn to end mankind
Desecration persists against the bringer of hope
To shower evil in these innocent minds

Relentless time
Awake through pain
Timeless shame
Deformities [misspelled as "Deformitys" in CD liner notes] of sanity soon
twist into a
ghostly visage
Volatile anger burns inside
I relinquish all my thoughts
Visionary hatred
Cast upon the darkness of my archaic dreams

Live heated coals
That sear strips of flesh
Thay tear against confinements of humanity
To build upon depression
Fumigation of the world you know

As your life disappears [misprinted as "dissapears" in CD liner notes]
Evils find the gateway through your soul

Forever encaged, through passages of the mind
Enslaved by tunnels of tragedy
Illusions invoke mass tranquillity [misspelled as "tranquility" in CD liner
notes]
Pain incarcerates your mind

Relentless time
Awake through pain
Timeless shame
Deformities [misspelled as "Deformitys" in CD liner notes] of sanity soon
twist into a
ghostly visage
Volatile anger burns inside
I relinquish all my thoughts
Visionary hatred
Cast upon the darkness of my archaic dreams

Dying, in this dreaded world
Transition of your life is inevitable
Awaiting, your spirit now roams
But I know your wait is not alone
