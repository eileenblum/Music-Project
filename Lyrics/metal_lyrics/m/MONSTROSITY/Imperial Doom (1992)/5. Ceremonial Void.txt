[Lyrics: L. Harrison; music: Monstrosity]

Deranged thoughts, a twisted mind
I've imagined a vision of burning Christ
Arranged, pre-ordained
Wisdom of the insane

Infliction inherent, Life deemed estranged
Reality transparent, normalcy in vain
Memory converted, A ministry ingrained
Tribulation for your sins, your mind is now enslaved

Hateful lies
known as promises
brainwashed minds
scarred as evidence
incoherent, to realities [misspelled as "realitys" in CD liner notes] denied
Frenzied thinking, delusions soon confied
Fallacy enraged, by the ways of law
This dominance controls with time !

Calculated doom
of your impurities [misspelled as "impuritys" in CD liner notes]
Saturation
of this sickness
A Vicious Mental Thirst !

Craving such insanity
You yearn to quell this hunger

Hateful lies
known as promises
brainwashed minds
scarred as evidence
Disciples, yet their minds cannot decide
Inbred [misprinted as "Imbredded" in CD liner notes] by a faith that soon
divides
Addiction, your [=you're] engulfed, by the ways of God
His dominance controls your mind !
A Vicious Mental Thirst !

Craving such insanity
You yearn to quell this hunger
