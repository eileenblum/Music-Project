[Lyrics: L. Harrison; music: Monstrosity]

A dark envision [duh, it's a verb, not a noun!] surrounds the mind
grasping for the souls of dead
the undead come trudging up
engulfing evil in your head

A sacrilegious [misspelled as "sacreligious" in CD liner notes] action burns
inside
this chant of death now seeps
through your eyes
A blackened charr ["char" is a verb, not a noun; "charr" is a kind of fish]
enraptures blood

Awaking cries
of unconscious souls
petrified to arise
Sifting ashes
of the funeral of life
to compel the final
cremation of the skies [misselled as "skys" in CD liner notes]

The fire burns through every corpse

Resurrected shell of death
revitalized core of dust
altered for the last of days
and propelled to liquidate

An unearthly sense dwells within my head
drifting through the walls of time
the oracle of insanity
must destroy this wasted ball of mass

Awaking cries
of unconscious souls
petrified to arise
Sifting ashes
of the funeral of life
to compel the final
cremation of the skies [misselled as "skys" in CD liner notes]
