[Lyrics: L. Harrison; music: Harrison / Van Erp]

A hybrid form [misprinted as "torm" in CD liner notes] of assembly
in hidden circles of transgression
A vision looms far ahead
emanating [misprinted as "eminating" in CD liner notes] beyond our spectrum

A burning infusion
restores the one
who's looking past
the doors that lie agape

Encompassed only by knowledge
thought our lives cannot withstand
For those unknowing it lies futile
our human proficiency remains untapped

Thoughts now diminish [misprinted as "dimish" in CD liner notes]
traces of recision [misprinted as "recission" in CD liner notes]
The garden of evil
has you chained against your will
No need for penance [misprinted as "pennance" in CD liner notes]
your actions are unsighted
in a world of inertia
you've proved yourself deficient
Definitive inquisition
Definitive inquisition

A burning infusion
restores the one
who's looking past
the doors that lie agape
A blizzard of aversion
awaits the one
who's blinded by the mind
of which it rapes

A hybrid form [misprinted as "torm" in CD liner notes] of assembly
in hidden circles of transgression
A vision looms far ahead
emanating [misprinted as "eminating" in CD liner notes] beyond our spectrum

A prophecy instilled within
a fervor [misprinted as "forver" in CD liner notes] to congeal this essence
This totality
injects your soul
to propel your death
with endless control

Thoughts now diminish [misprinted as "dimish" in CD liner notes]
traces of recision [misprinted as "recission" in CD liner notes]
The garden of evil
has you chained against your will
No need for penance [misspelled as "pennance" in CD liner notes]
your actions are unsighted
in a world of inertia
you've proved yourself deficient
Definitive inquisition
Definitive inquisition
