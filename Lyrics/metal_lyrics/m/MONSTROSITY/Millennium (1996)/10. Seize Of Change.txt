Torture in the minds of millions
Is breeding the plains of the earth
Trapped in the life of depravity
Creating your own scourge
Morals cast since your day of birth
Trained to forever follow these ways
A call to those from a different path
Exceed all bounds that surround you now

Realms of madness can never end
Deviant cycle of dreadful cries
Wounds way too deep to mend
Taking passage through the trials of fire
This machine engulfs your inferior life
Bringing forth the throes of death
Awaken in darkness to a million screams
They'll fucking rip your mind to shreds

Evaporation of these chains
To free us from your religious gains

The seize of change
All of life
Is blasting through the ages of our earthly genocide!

Times illusion
To break the trends of logic
Inherent traits
Can't force the end of change
This boiling knowledge falls into the never
Faceless human we must remains

Realms of madness can never end
Deviant cycle of dreadful cries
Wounds way too deep to mend
Taking passage through the trials of fire
This machine engulfs your inferior life
Bringing forth the throes of death
Awaken in darkness to a million screams
They'll fucking rip your mind to shreds

Evaporation of these chains
To free us from your religious gains

The seize of change
All of life
Is blasting through the ages of our earthly genocide!
