Searching through this violent haze
Contracted by illusions
This mesmerizing dream
To find fragments of resolution

The eyes of eternity
Focus on the myriad forms
As the minds of the conscious crumble
To the weakness their truth must conform

Fragments... of resolution
Fragments... of resolution

Breathing in this misery
Destroying absolution
Victim of a hidden past
Resounding with execution

Motionless are the serpent's eyes
Dripping with your conclusion
Hanging on by a thread of life
Ties are cut with resolution's... knife
