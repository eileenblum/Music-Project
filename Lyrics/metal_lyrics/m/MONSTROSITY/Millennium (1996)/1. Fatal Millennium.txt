Destroyers of the world before
Underneath a deeper realm
Parallels in their shallow common ground
Brings the destruction of their will

The racing minds of the sickened
Holding fast to a world so vast
Empty beings so convinced
In the end is when their time begins
Rivaled like none before
Unchallenged in the face of hate
Adorned with the tides of atrophy

Formed from the injected fallacy
Faced with concepts of reality
Beginning with the experiment
Betrayal will come at the first sight of blood

In the trenches of corruption

Efforts to ignite the plan
Undermining will has now unfoiled
Deviation of their conflict demands
Rising constant turmoil

Rivaled like none before
Unchallenged in the face of hate
Adorned with the tides of atrophy
The fatal millennium--
Exists!--
Within their molecular minds
A worldless philosophy--
Transgress!--
Against societies rise
And the ills of technology--
Resist!--
Their formidable ties
And the rise of our obscurity--
Erase!--
Their subliminal crimes
Begin the tides of atrophy

Forced fed apocalypse
Conspiracy denies truth
Deceptive vows cannot be stopped
Their lies feed the youth
Caustic fashions become the trend
To embellish the foolish engaged deep within
Unidirectional patterns soon blend

Media blitz Propels their gain
Brain wash tactics
For a propaganda storm
Destroyers of the world take hold
Undermining will now takes control

FATAL! MILLENNIUM!!!!...
