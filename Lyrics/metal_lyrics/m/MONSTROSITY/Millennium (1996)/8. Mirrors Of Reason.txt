Magnetic energies
Gravitating towards the fatal plunge
Reflections of your dying world
Penetrating core of existence

Your mind is dying
The race is blinding you can't decide
Drawing from your power
Electrifying current surging your fears uncoiling

The mirrors of reason

But your fears keep you guessing
Fading fast in the rushing flow that leaves you in the past
Reasons deter your strength
And your hopes have been strangled leaving questions of reality

Questions of this reality!

Magnetic energies
Gravitating towards the fatal plunge
Reflections of your dying world
Penetrating core of existence
