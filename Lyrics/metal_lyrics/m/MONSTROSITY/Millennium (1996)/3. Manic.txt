Earthly planet revolving moon and sun
Eclipse of light will evoke it's death
The years of display forthcoming decay
The age of fire now crawling quick
Soon to disintegrate with the ashes of our destiny
A swirling mass now ethereal
Shadows of our past have frozen
Time remaining is drifting by

You listen to hear the chimes of revelation
Calling out to greet the spawn of doom
Your journey continues in a downward spiral
Clinging to walls of a boundless room
Grasp for understanding of your pathetic life
Pain encircles your soul like vultures in the sky
You cannot claim reason for your mind is numb
Life will be a fragment...of your memory

MANIC!
Searching for the answers of your destiny
Frantic paces towards the end of history
Solutions to be revealed at the end of life
Yet the questions in your mind make you
MANIC!
Searching for the answers of your destiny
Frantic paces towards the end of history
Solutions to be revealed at the end of...LIFE!

Constantly questing for the blueprints of our design
To your fallacy of long ago I cannot resign
Exploration for the schemes missing puzzle piece
This labyrinth called life makes you manic in the mind

You listen to hear the chimes of revelation
Calling out to greet the spawn of doom
Your journey continues in a downward spiral
Clinging to walls of a boundless room
Grasp for understanding of your pathetic life
Pain encircles your soul like vultures in the sky
You cannot claim reason for your mind is numb
Life will be a fragment...of your memory

MANIC!
Searching for the answers of your destiny
Frantic paces towards the end of history
Solutions to be revealed at the end of life
Yet the questions in your mind make you
MANIC!
