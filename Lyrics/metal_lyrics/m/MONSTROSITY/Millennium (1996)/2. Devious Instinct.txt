The perfect prey
Deliverance of your end
The rebellion commands
Your doom has now been sealed

Devious Instinct
The killing of all future
Resistance failing
Vindictive torture
The storm churns violent
no one stands in the eye!

Resuscitate
Led to the edge of your life
To be struck down
Inflicted punishing blows
Infiltrate
Altering cells defusing your mind
The regime of hate
This vengeance cannot be denied

Calculated crimes
There's no defense
This temptation will destroy your life
Retaliation can't commence

The dream which you have has been fading into none
The war that you face has been waged by a fallen world

DEVIOUS INSTINCT!
The slaughter has now begun
Resistance failing
Vindictive torture
The storm churns violent
no one stands in the eye!

Calculated crimes
There's no defense
This temptation will destroy your life
Retaliation can't commence

The dream which you have has been fading into none
The war that you face has been waged by a fallen world

Devious Instinct
The killing of all future
Resistance failing
Vindictive torture
The storm churns violent
no one stands in the eye!
