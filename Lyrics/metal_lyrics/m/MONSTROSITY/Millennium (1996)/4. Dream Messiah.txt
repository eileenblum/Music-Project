Confirmation to attack
Persistent to the vibe that kills your power
Deeper than life are...You!

Confined to a matrix of corruption
Entwined in this political surgery
Some will make it look so easy
By embracing their addictions to a vice they crave

In depth thrives
By mortal lives
Blinding plagues
Creating kingless slaves

Pushing their bodies to their final day

Impulsive drives
Created lies
This mortal cave
Imprisoned grave
THE DREAM MESSIAH!

Engulfing need to retract
Distanced from all hope and losing power
Deeper than life are...YOU!

Confined to a matrix of corruption
Entwined in this political surgery
Some will make it look so easy
By embracing their addictions to a vice they crave

You seem to think
In this world you link
But your lies have brought you down
And to the world that waits
I direct a new found hate
King for a day
But it reaps your faith
The dreams that remains
Have ripped away
Chains!

Dreams defy
Logic of sanity
Suicide
Revel in agony
Pushing their bodies to their final day

In depth thrives
By mortal lives
Blinding plagues
Creating kingless slaves

THE DREAM MESSIAH!

Confined to a matrix of corruption
Entwined in this political surgery
Some will make it look so easy
By embracing their addictions to a vice they crave
