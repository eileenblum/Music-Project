Born of the earth and universe
Evolving limitless potential
Shedding the skin of the life once lived
Open your mind as it was the day you were born

Your religion is a waste of time!

Striving harder, ever harder
To please individual gods
They follow blindly, lives are wasted
Slaves and masters of ourselves

Life is the first step
In the stairs that lead to the infinite
Death unlocks the doors
To the path towards the meaning of existence
Soar through the subconscious mind
Unlock the mysteries of the soul
Drown in the essential knowledge
That we're all gods on our own

Born of the earth and universe
Evolving limitless potential
Shedding the skin of the life once lived
Open your mind as it was the day you were born

Your religion is a waste of time!
Slaves and masters
