Desperation keeps the quest alive
storm winds soon whip as the calmness dies
Breath filled with the grit of sand
Torrents of fury rape the land
From the phantom fear I step out
I rip from your soul all that's been
And all you know
Dreams of your promised land
Burning as the wind descends
From the phantom fear I step out
I rip from your soul all that's been
And all you know

Torrents of fury!

Falling down you reach for me
I'll no longer relax
Raining down the furies within the grasp of life
You will never come back!

We flow with nightfall
Approaching the dismayant flash
The walls of life are broken
And are never ever coming back
The night filled with aural distortion
The sky is turning vicious black
Your memories of life are fading
They sink into the depths of all eternity

Venting fury now released
Against your will I will command
The blade of vengeance tearing
Your lifeline is in my hand

Torrents of Fury!!!

Desperation keeps the quest alive
storm winds soon whip as the calmness dies
Breath filled with the grit of sand
Torrents of fury rape the land
From the phantom fear I step out
I rip from your soul all that's been
And all you know
Dreams of your promised land
Burning as the wind descends
From the phantom fear I step out

We flow with nightfall
Approaching the dismayant flash
The walls of life are broken
And are never ever coming back
Your memories of life are fading
They sink into the depths of all eternity
