Engulfed by my aggression
All souls consumed like this.

Looking upon your body,
Upon your flesh empty of life and cold.
A female virgin body
Lifeless so pale the skin.
Dead stare with eyes wide open
Unto your flesh I give myself.

Power, complete control
Engulfed by my aggression.
All souls consumed like this.

Burning is my desire
To see this lifeless body bare before me.
The tears of sheer terror
I taste the pain, my pleasure.
Upon my skin her virgin blood
Forced submission,
My dark intention is my power,
Complete control.
Engulfed by my aggression,
All souls consumed like this....
