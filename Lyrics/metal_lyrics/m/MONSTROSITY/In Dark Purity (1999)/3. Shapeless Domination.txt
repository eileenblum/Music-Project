Rising from the depths of creation
Timeless with rage and wrath infernal.
A God with no form to man
Lies dormant observing generations of existence,
Dormant awaiting the time.
To rise upon the wind of fire
Devours all flesh and bone
In Supreme Shapeless Domination.

In this landscape of burning life
Those who suffer the wrath
Dissolve and become one
With the body of the beast infernal.
Destruction
In burning ashes
Blacken the sky with your fury.
A burning rage illuminates
And erupts to darken the light of the sun.
Burning flesh permeates
And death screaming on searing winds,
Infernal prophecy realized
In this prelude to incineration.

Deep below the ground it lives
Now it awakes to feed on the flesh of a nation.
Caressed by the touch of fire
And exists to awake
It awakens to destroy itself.

Forced to yield to its power
Its form adapting to that of its prey,
Its hunger never ends.
In destruction in itself creation
Cleansing the face of the earth.
With the wrath of the earth itself
Al life burned alive,
Regeneration through incineration.

Deep below the ground it lives
Now it awakes to feed on the flesh of a nation.
Caressed by the touch of fire
And exists to awake;
It awakens to destroy itself.
