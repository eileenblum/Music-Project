Within the bounds of this world
A legion of hate, observing it's prey.
Preaching it's word,
Offering strength to those that relate,
Engulfed in the black.
The rage in their souls wait to attack
Killing the child.
The son of God shall burn.

Crucifiers
At one with the dark
Defying the words of the world.
At one with their rage
Their numbers increase.
Awaiting the lights judgement day,
Exposing those who are opposed to the blade.
The blood of the lamb spilled anointing the face.
Screaming their words demanding moral decay
Taken by force in darkness they find their way.

Wage the war on life
Suffocation of those who inhabit the light
And crucify the worshippers.
So they may die the same as their God
Their screams in vain ring in my ears.
Caressing my soul with their fears;
Devourment consuming the blood.
Their bodies are left for their God.

Incinerate the enemy's flesh,
Melted away by the burning force of the rage
Which we possess.
Growing inside the hatred, disgust and detest
To be released on those who oppose
Resist or try to defeat.
The quest were on
The strength of our numbers.
Completely devouring all
Defying the light.
Burning inside
No escaping the dark
Destiny calls.
Exposing those who are opposed to the blade,
The blood of the lamb spilled anointing the face.
Screaming their words demanding moral decay,
Taken by force in darkness they find their way.
