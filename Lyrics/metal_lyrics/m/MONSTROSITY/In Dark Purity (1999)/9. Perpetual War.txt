Stare in the face of this humanity;
Frantic beings searching for their immortality.
Hear the rage of the ending call
And fight for life in the war on death.
Perpetual War

Fight
Replenish mortal form
Replaced with an artificial one.
An illusion of continuance
Life sustained only to be consumed.

Strive to see the end of a mortal plague,
Only to be defeated again.
Discover cures, alter destiny
Incubation of doom.
Much more aggressively
Burns in the fear of their passing on.
Descent to darken oblivion
To withstand the course of time,
Is to deny the very fact that we die.

Regression into the hands of disease we resist
Fools imploring their Gods for regrets.
Pray to idols for their sanity
Yet ultimately reach submission.
Into the hands of death we detest
So surgery is performed.
Open flesh for alteration
To preserve our being.
Pawns in perpetual war we engage.

Stare in the face of this humanity
Frantic beings searching for their immortality.
Hear the rage of the ending call
And fight for life in the perpetual war.
The passion for the flesh
And the burning desire we have to exist.
Observe the weakness of our entity
And in the quest for matter
Become a casualty.

Fight
Replenish mortal form
Replaced with an artificial one.
An illusion of continuance
Life sustained only to be consumed.
