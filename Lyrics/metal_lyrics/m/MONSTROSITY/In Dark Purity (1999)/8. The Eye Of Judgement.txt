Shroud my face in this veil of scorn
At one with Darkness I am reborn.

Eye of judgement
Staring at you;
Turn your face and hide.
I impose my wrath upon you
Imploring me, you'll die.

Burning in the flames
Cast upon your life.
Feel the darkest energy
Infect your soul.

Screaming rage of negativity
Dwells beyond my eyes
Inside I control.

Inflict my horror
To the heart of weaker useless souls I despise.
No longer
Will I allow my enemies to contimue life.

Descent into the grave
Is the punishment.
I impose on you
Your flesh consumed.
Swirling mass of omnipresent
Hate and solitude
Beckons you
Eye of judgement.

Covered in the blood of my enemies
And pure virgin innocence.
My soul can rest
I've imposed my judgement
On the feeble beings
And their souls are raped
In my God-like state.
