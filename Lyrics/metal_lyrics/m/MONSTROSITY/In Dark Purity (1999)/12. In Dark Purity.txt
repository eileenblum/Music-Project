Born in the dawn of a new era
Existing in the vast confines of infinity.
Reaching out toward the light
Reaching out to burn alive.
Breath down in the sea of desperation
Engulfed in the burning wrath
Of the beast inside,
Devoid of life.

In the flesh it lies
The soul a portrait of rage
Which dwels beyond the eyes.
Its hunger devours from inside
Wrenching your soul until it cannot be
In dark purity.
In the flesh it lies
In dark purity.

Alone inside
The screaming silence will not die;
It beckons me
To the things the silence screams.
