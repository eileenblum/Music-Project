Open your mind; see beyond your realm
Into the eyes where such horrors dwell.
Singing the hymns of this tragedy
Are the voices of the suffering.

The end of our time drawing near
As displayed in the face of the tortured ones.
Entombed in their graves
Voices still screaming for salvation.
That will never come
As thousands more die,
The screams remain
For the ears of the living.
Reminding them all of their death
Hear their cries
Hymns of tragedy.

Rising from within the flames
As the skin of the face slowly melts away
The flesh becomes ash
Screaming is ceased by the touch of death
But those who have seen.
Screams of the burning child
Within their mind.
The cries still ring,
Suffering, waiting for death.
Hear their cries
Hymns of tragedy.
