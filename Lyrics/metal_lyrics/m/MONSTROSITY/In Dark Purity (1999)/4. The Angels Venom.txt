Stagnant in this existence,
I quest to free my mind.
No longer captive
This freedom my desire.
My quest never ending
With flames I light my path.
Yet death impending,
Shadows me on my way.

So the quest consumes me
As poison in my blood.
Pulling my body downward
Soon sleeping death shall come.
And how the light it tempts me,
I hear the trumpets call.
Tasting the lips of angels,
My soul is ripped apart.

Lost, awake, yet dreaming.
Asleep, yet conscious still,
My soul extracted.
I stumble through the dark.
I have no vision,
Yet I see everything.
The essence coursing
Ascension killing me.

Burn, the angels venom raging through my veins.
Violent hallucination venom draining me.
The trumpets ringing the light begins to fade
Into a new existence I am thrown again.

Burning in distress and my body reeling,
Traumatic visions form
My mind erases
Memories I'll never know.

Listen to the screams of the souls in mourning
Dissolving entity.
Shown the ways of horror
Writhing ecstasy.

Burn the angels venom raging through my veins.
Violent hallucination, venom draining me.
The trumpets ringing the light begins to fade,
Into a new existence I am thrown again.

Hear the voices of the dying crying out to me.
I hear the message clearly, voice of infinity
Their words caress me and tell me of my end.
Into the door of passage will I know flesh again?

So the quest consumes me as poison in my blood,
Pulling my body downward, sleeping death will come.
Now the light it tempts me, I hear the trumpets call;
Tasting the lips of angels my soul is ripped apart.
