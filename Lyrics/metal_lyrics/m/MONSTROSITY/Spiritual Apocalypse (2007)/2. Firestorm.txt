Trapped within illusion
Drawn into the black
This bleakness now encases your mind
Raped by the horrors of apocalyptic destiny
Embracing your end

Cower down to your destiny

Face reality stare the bull in the eyes
This is your end
Lost in the cracks of all humanity
Now your death is at hand

Cover down to your destiny

Feed the fires with your blindness
Torn from within this violent rage

Born in the violent stage of struggle
Forged from steel and redesigned
The storm of fire comes and takes your soul away
Destroys your feeble mind

Rising flames of sadness
In the heart of the toxic wasteland
In sewers of dreams forever lost
There is nothing left of hope

Cast into dejection
Erasing all that's past
No longer held from within
Escaping the fall so many times before
As the anger builds

Cover down to your destiny

Feed the fires with your blindness
Torn from within this violent rage
