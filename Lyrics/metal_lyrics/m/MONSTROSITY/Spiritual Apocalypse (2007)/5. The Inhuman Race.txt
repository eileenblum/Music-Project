Everyday they die
The fight is coming from within
The sadness of their human plight
Leaves them in a war
Without end... without end!

Sanctity, fighting battles for your savior
Apathy – the streets are paved in blood
Sickening curse of violence
Executions in the street
Cut their throats and end their lives
The cycle is complete

The inhuman race
The inhuman race

Tragically – the divide is growing deeper
Gradually – the pressure starts the build
Dominate the masses
Let them think they have control
Vested interest in their death
No one has to know

The inhuman race
The inhuman race

Everyday they die
The fight is coming from within
The sadness of their human plight
Leaves them in a war
Without end... without end!

War without end
War without end

Sanctity, fighting battles for your savior
Apathy – the streets are paved in blood
Sickening curse of violence
Executions in the street
Cut their throats and end their lives
The cycle is complete

The inhuman race
The inhuman race
