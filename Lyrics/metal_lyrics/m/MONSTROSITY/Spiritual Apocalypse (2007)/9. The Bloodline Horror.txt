Lies... the keeper unto me
The only path I've chosen yet I have now converged
Writhe... in tortured ecstasy
No escape from this grasp

I've waited unconscious for thousands of years
Lurking in the shadows of your darkest tears

Dawn... the bloodline horror defines you
The dying bleed and now I feel
Selfishness takes my right to life
A call from the source of infamy

Cries... from way beyond the deep
Lost in the caverns of eternity I am now exposed
Born from darkest seeds of hate
With contempt I destroy

I've waited unconscious for thousands of years
Lurking in the shadows of your darkest tears

Dawn... the bloodline horror defines you
The dying bleed and now I feel
Selfishness takes my right to life
A call from the source of infamy

Lies... that feed the fire
Aligned... with darkness in you
Fight... this hate prophets you
Desire... you search forever

Lies... the keeper unto me
The only path I've chosen yet I have now converged
Writhe... in tortured Ecstasy
No escape from this grasp

I've waited unconscious for thousands of years
Lurking in the shadows of your darkest tears

Dawn... the bloodline horror defines you
The dying bleed and now I feel
Selfishness takes my right to life
A call from the source of infamy
