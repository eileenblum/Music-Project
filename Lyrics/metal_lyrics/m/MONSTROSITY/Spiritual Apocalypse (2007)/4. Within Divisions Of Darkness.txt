Born in the light
From the code of life
Nurtured with spite
Inculcate the dark insurgency

Aligned, emboldened to stand in the shadow of this grand design
From within the darkness comes the power that beholds your destiny

Command and fail

Strong ravaged with the blindness of impurity
Their gods forced execution of their dignity
Apathy their salvation truly stands for nothing
unconscious
incomplete forever to be enslaved

Raised in the womb of hate
Bred with contempt and scorn
Entrapped in echoes of time as the evil cascades
Lost with no chance for hope life forever fades away
Obsessed, the souls won't let go of these faded memories

Aligned, emboldened to stand in the shadow of this grand design
From within the darkness comes the power that beholds your destiny

Command and fail

Within divisions
Of darkness
Within divisions
Inculcate the dark insurgency
