Kneeling down at my altar
The blood stains the walls
No need for conjecture
I pray for the world to fall

Pieces of my existence
In tiny stripes of flesh
Exposed emotions nerves bare
Rising mercury
What will become of this now
Where will this anger dwell
There will be no rapture
Only a blacker hell

Remnants of divination

Rain down – amongst the feeble herd
Scorched earth – is what you all deserve

Skies pouring downward
awashing the uncleansed masses
Bathing in a toxic cesspool
Bio-chem has scattered

Rain down – amongst the feeble herd
Scorched earth – is what you all deserve

Smoke plumes fill the cities
Dust clouds block the sun
My dreams are filled with horrors
Of a world undone

Kneeling down at my altar
The blood stains the walls
No need for conjecture
I pray for the world to fall

Remnants of divination
