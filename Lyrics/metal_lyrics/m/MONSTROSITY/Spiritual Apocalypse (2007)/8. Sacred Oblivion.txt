Fight this destruction of your sanctity
Shatter the dreams of disillusion
Destroyed with the breath of your destiny
Embracing tragedy that soon will come

Those who have no will are disregarded
The deception of mankind you've now been shown
Become the master of life or fall prey
Fall to your knees and worship at my throne

Fools have shown
Time and again they follow the worn path
Alone at last in my sacred oblivion

Kneel down at the altar of depravity
This poignant shrine of sorrow
Dedicate now to this corrosive train of thought
Engulf the energy all around you

Those who have no will are disregarded
The deception of mankind you've now been shown
Become the master of life or fall prey
Fall to your knees and worship at my throne

Fools have shown
Time and again they follow the worn path
Alone at last in my sacred oblivion
