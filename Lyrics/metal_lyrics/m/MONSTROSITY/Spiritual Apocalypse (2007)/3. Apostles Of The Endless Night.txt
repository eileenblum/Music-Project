Worshipers of your chosen gods
You're never seen their face and yet you know
I summon you to the other side
To a place where your darkest dreams will grow
Rules that bind you
Relinquishing the power of your control
Will you cave to their dichotomy
Is nothing truly sacred absent life?

Apostles of the night

Apostles of the...
Cold harsh world that awaits you
Never to behold
Drowned in the ocean of life
I present to you: your end

Apostles – of the endless – night
Apostles – of the endless – night

Cold and waiting
Lost and fading

Pawns of the afterworld
Allegiance to your current decline
Drawn into the line of fire
Imprisoned by the limits of your mind

Look into the glowing embers
There you find your destiny calls
There's no hope for your absolution
There's only the hope that it fails

Lost inside this dark reflection
Painfully aware of it's truth
Burning at the stake of salvation
Calling you to follow this through

Apostles – of the endless – night
Apostles – of the endless – night

Worshipers of your chosen gods
You're never seen their face and yet you know
I summon you to the other side
To a place where your darkest dreams will grow
Rules that bind you
Relinquishing the power of your control
Will you cave to their dichotomy
Is nothing truly sacred absent life?

Apostles of the night
Apostles of the night
