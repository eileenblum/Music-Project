The beast within
Adorned with devastation
Revel in pain
Dissecting all emotions

Vicious burns
Blackened dark circles
Mortified within this trance
The lines have been blurred
My wrath is my focus
As part of me dies within you

Race towards doom
Brace yourself
As this cold truth
Comes to life

Vicious burns
Blackened dark circles
Mortified within this trance
The lines have been blurred
My wrath is my focus
As part of me dies within you

Writhe in the den of snakes
You cannot fight back
Lie in the bed you've made
Your destruction intact

Storming rage
Boring deep within
This mental cage
Let the rage begin

Vicious burns
Blackened dark circles
Mortified within this trance
The lines have been blurred
My wrath is my focus
As part of me dies within you
