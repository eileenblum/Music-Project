As the wrath of gods
Suppress the mighty they seek
The illusions in their mind
Imprison the worn and the weak

Cold and confused
You'll never see
The light in the dark is weak!

Fuel – the fires of hatred
Face – the time has come

A plague in the heart of the enemy
It resides, consumes their pulse and destroys their lives

Forged from insanity
Feed from the energy

As the wrath of time
Suppress the mighty they seek
The illusions in their mind
Imprison the worn and the weak

Triumph in black
Triumph in black

Triumph in black
Only living to attain your death
Course of track
The only hope for you is suicide

Triumph in black
Triumph in black
Triumph in black
