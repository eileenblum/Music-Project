Gazing back now at the living 
from behind these eternal flames
as judgment day has passed 
with darkness I bind my affinity

Their kingdom bleeds 
their kingdom falls

[#1] Suffering in vain, disintegrated 
destined to serve, powerless 
engulfed by the infernal consuming pain 
armageddon draws near

Sift through the ashes of your deranged crusade
you weave hypocrisy into faith
destiny of flames the choice I've made
ashen skies have come to life
culminating storm of centuries
plumes of smoke have filled the light
the doom of all life

Structure that guided the way 
cast upon irrelevance 
a crown of thorns that now decays 
lustful vows of decadence

as the world in its insanity 
powerless to resist the end 
an outlet for the killing force 
draws upon the end of time

Their kingdom bleeds 
their kingdom falls

[REPEAT 1]
