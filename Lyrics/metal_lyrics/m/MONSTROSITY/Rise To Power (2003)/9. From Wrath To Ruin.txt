With open eyes
No longer tortured by sermons of lies
Watching it die 
Faith crumbles as the angels they bleed

[#1] Losing grip on reality
Behind the shield of crumbling faith 
Now the mighty have fallen 
Left alone to suffer their fate

Religion is lost in spiraling descension 
Ending at last the reign of the divine
[REPEAT 1]

The world opens its eyes
No longer paralyzed by sermons of lies
Broken chains of deceit
Faith of absurdity faces defeat
This wrath becomes your ruin

From Wrath To Ruin.....
