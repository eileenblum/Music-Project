Behold the seize of power 
Dark faction now prepared to strike 
All opposition bleeds and cowers 
Legion of darkness shall dictate its will 
and rise to power

Denounce all gods and moral structures 
crushing to dust the bones of those who question 
The power of our convictions 
The world has never seen such horrors

Eviscerate all false believers 
Incinerate our social leaders 
Kill and rape those who seek the light 
on virgin blood we thrive

Remove the tongues of those who speak out
Tear out the eyes nothing else is seen 
Cut the throats and let them bleed 
on human life we feed 
Rise To Power
Rise To Power
