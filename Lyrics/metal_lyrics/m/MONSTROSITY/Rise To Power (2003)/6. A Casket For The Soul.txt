Repulsive actions burning impressions on the soul
Cascading wave of failure relinquish all control
The grasp of terror crushing a fleeting sense of hope
and then the same hand closes a casket for the soul

This affliction will finalize your sanity
To descension encompassing your very being 
Suffocation within the tomb behind 
the eyes of a being aspiring to its demise 
Termination forsaken for the suffering 
which embraces every fiber of your living being 
and disposing the withered remnants of a man 
in a tomb constructed for a tortured mind.

Drained of all sense and reason 
Your very soul devolves 
into a state of grotesque 
Human deficiency
