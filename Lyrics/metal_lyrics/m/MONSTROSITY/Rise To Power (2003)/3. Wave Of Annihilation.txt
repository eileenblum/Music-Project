Years have passed
still the one remains
sole survivor
of a world in flames
world of flames

Last of an endangered breed 
lone survivor of this tragedy 
solitude inherits humanity 
doomed forever to obscurity 
echoing memories of those deceased 
tear at the remnants of sanity 
within the mind of the last to be

Through rivers of ash that layer the ground 
search for life never found 
cannot be, yet one survives 
contemplate this worlds demise 
dead haunt the living until it dies

Towering wave 
consuming flames 
A shattered world 
in the wake of this storm

[REPEAT 1]
