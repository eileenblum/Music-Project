All things past and void of life
And all things yet to die and face the light
Must come before, kneel and be driven down
Before the lords of emptiness
Abysmal Gods abound.

Horror, anguish, fear and torture
Souls devoured at postmortem 
Empty beings, power unrivaled 
Dissolve existence, effortless control

Screams of suffering
Have no effect, wrath unbridled
Fury unrestrained, entity of darkness
Feeds on pain Cries ring empty
All mortality, purified through pain
Merciless control, Abysmal Gods now possess your soul.

Horror, anguish, suffer, fear and torture
There is no salvation
Souls devoured at postmortem
Empty beings, control this power unrivaled
To resist is useless
They dissolve the existence of all things.
