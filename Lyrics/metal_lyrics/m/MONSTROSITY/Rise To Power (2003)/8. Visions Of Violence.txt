[#1] Ageless hands of a wicked race 
Malicious fury of hell forged hate 
Clawing with rage out from below
Uprising realms of sickness grows

Mocking our doomed existence

Surrender to visions of a hopeless future 
Prophecies foretell the end of time 
Alliance of poisoning hate deployed 
Implications of a dream that died 
Visions Of Violence

From the wastelands of a mind gone mad

Foreboding dreams of a world to come

Chaotic visions now known to be 
haunting images of destiny 
Ageless hands of a wicked race 
Malicious fury of hell forged hate

Lives trained to fear 
Fevered visions forming inside 
in darkness swarming on mankind 
Burning embers fill the sky 
Transforming those left alive 
Earth below now bleeds 
consuming fire glows beneath 
engulfed atmospheric cage 
a final act has now been staged

Surrender to visions of a hopeless future 
prophecies foretell the end of time 
Alliance of poisoning hate deployed 
implications of a dream that died

Haunting images now known to be 
Chaotic visions fill destiny 
Nightmare becomes reality 
Twisted forms of chemistry

[REPEAT 1]

From the wastelands of a mind gone mad

Foreboding dreams of a world to come 
These visions become violence
