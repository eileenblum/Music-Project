Victims of a dying world 
Succumb beneath a wrath of terror 
Oblivious to the awaiting doom 
A never ending rain of lire consumes

Blind they sleepwalk the path of lies 
Offer prayers to an empty sky 
Wasted effort only made in vain 
Weak are tortured in endless pain

[#1] When darkness falls 
Blind illusions deceive us 
Hoping for a non existent savior 
While we alone are strung enough

Victims of a dying faith
I have now grown to hate 
and forever turn my back
to the lights weak embrace

Darkness once confined within 
demon absolved no longer bound 
dark forces controlling the mind 
spill forth onto realms of light
[REPEAT 1]

Victims of a dying world 
Succumb beneath a wrath of terror 
Oblivious to the awaiting doom 
A never ending rain of fire burns....

Blind they sleepwalk the path of lies 
Offer prayers to an empty sky 
Wasted effort only made in vain 
Weak are tortured in endless pain
