Can you comprehend the strength of the enemy you have made
overpowering cravings for vengeance driving me insane
false assumptions of superiority has brought you to your knees
as you beg for mercy you will not receive
failures realization rips the smile right from your face
folding in submission you are erased
It shackles my soul this obsession
drawing strength from opposition
it boils the blood this aggression

[#1] Trapped in this web
you should have left alone
your feeble struggle
strengthens the ensnaring grasp

Can you withstand the unleashing of rage coming your way 
wrath like none confronted before this boundless hate 
imminent is this destruction blindly await annihilation 
impossible to evade
these victims of fate
could have turned and walked away
choice no longer yours to make 
waging war until none remain 
it shackles my soul this obsession 
drawing strength from opposition 
it boils the blood this aggression

[REPEAT 1]

They fall like flies
crushed under onslaught of aggression
corrosive mind
lashing at your resolve in waves
manifest hate
endangered morality in regression
no end in sight
volatile force chemical reaction
