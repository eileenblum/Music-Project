They dwell beyond dimensions 
outside the sphere of a living realm 
escaping the binds of the universe
watching beyond the unknown

Immortal inhabitants of eternity 
mortal minds cannot behold 
intricate patterns of insanity 
which we will never know

Your will becomes submission to creeping dark aggression 
listen in terror the lights darkest contradiction 
besieged from all sides by this force that resides 
ruling the shadows beyond fields of sight 
subject to this madness resistance rendered useless 
as you stand alone at the mercy of the merciless

[#1] Perceiving ourselves as endless
we choke on the sands of time 
and as we fade into nothingness 
their memory of our being also dies

Beyond mortal comprehension 
outside our perception 
creeping aggression 
dark contradiction

Immortal inhabitants of eternity 
mortal minds cannot behold 
intricate patterns of insanity 
which we will never know

They dwell beyond dimensions 
outside the sphere of a living realm 
escaping binds of the universe 
watching beyond the unknown
