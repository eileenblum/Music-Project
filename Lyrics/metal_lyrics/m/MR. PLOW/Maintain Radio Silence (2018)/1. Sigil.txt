Retrace steps across the ages
The only way we know
Misplace our understanding as surely as we go

Just walk away
Now turn and stay
Now walk away again

I try to read the signs
Decipher what they mean
A sigil etched in time
Until I burn it clean

I try to read the signs
Decipher what they mean
A sigil etched in time
Until I burn it clean

Track the signal cross the eras
Past infinite divides
Time tendrils stretch behind us
A protean reprise

Just walk away
Now turn and stay
Now walk away again

I try to read the signs
Decipher what they mean
A sigil etched in time
Until I burn it clean

I try to read the signs
Decipher what they mean
A sigil etched in time
Until I burn it clean

I try to read the signs
Decipher what they mean
A sigil etched in time
Until I burn it clean

I try to read the signs
Decipher what they mean
A sigil etched in time
Until I burn it clean
