Rumpled jeans and t-shirt
Lightning bolt across his chest
Unassuming in the extreme
Dismissed as but a jest

Incomplete but building
Like fear in dragon's eyes
Mortal weakness gone now
Fleeting as a gloaming sky

He's more than he shows
He's more than you will ever know
Ever know

He is the Pendragon
He'll see the darkness come undone
A glowing bat he swings
He brings a reckoning

Slay the bloody, bent one
Who feeds on the innocent
Fly into the gaping maw
The wretched belly rent

Evil forces gather
To lure, lull and bind
Wielder and the weapon one
Will consecrate his mind

He's more than he shows
He's more than you will ever know
Ever know

He is the Pendragon
He'll see the darkness come undone
A glowing bat he swings
He brings a reckoning

Servants to the struggle
A rift that will never mend
Privy to its secrets
Bonded always to its ends

Silence phantom hounds and vanquish all the guilty ghosts
Deeper in the devil's den
Blackened Oroboros

The cycle thus continues
And the conflict stokes the flame
Red corrupts the green
And then viridescent again

He's more than he shows
He's more than you will ever know
Ever know

He is the Pendragon
He'll see the darkness come undone
A glowing bat he swings
He brings a reckoning (reckoning)

He is the Pendragon (He is the Pendragon)
He'll see the darkness come undone (He'll see the darkness come undone)
A glowing bat he swings (A glowing bat he swings)
He brings a reckoning

He brings a reckoning
