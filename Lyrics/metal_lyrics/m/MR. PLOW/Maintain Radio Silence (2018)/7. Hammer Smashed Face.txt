I've been full o' love at times
But then push comes to shove, and I let the droogs and bollocks bring me
down
They meddle in my blackest hour
Vulgarly display their power
Bring my brash thoughts crashing to the ground

The closest I'll get to a state of grace is a hammer-smashed face

Knuckle under, lift the smog
Throw the others to the dogs
Singing my brash praises far and wide

Milk the venom from the vein
Distilled, sucked down again
Liquid legend always will abide

The closest I'll get to a state of grace is a hammer-smashed face

My fellow man's an asshole
Begging me to follow wherever he goes
No thanks, gonna sit right here
Sinking my dark thoughts in some darker beer
Oh yeah

The closest I'll get to a state of grace is a hammer-smashed face

My fellow man's an asshole
Begging me to follow wherever he goes
No thanks, gonna sit right here
Sinking my dark thoughts in some darker beer

My fellow man's an asshole
Begging me to follow wherever he goes
No thanks, gonna sit right here
Sinking my dark thoughts in some darker beer
Oh yeah

With a hammer-smashed face
With a hammer-smashed face
(Oh)
With a hammer-smashed face
