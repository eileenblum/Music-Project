Excuse me sir, but could you perhaps spare the time
To shed your body and to reconstruct my mind
From all these memory shards, so pale and smoldering
I know they're mine, but still they mean nothing to me

Hey, this is just another day
And this too shall fade away
We are phantoms in the shade
And we too shall waste and wane

A ghostly image stalking the periphery
I turn to look but then there's nothing more to see
Of all these memory shards, so pale and smoldering
I know they're mine, but still they mean nothing to me

Hey, this is just another day
And this too shall fade away
We are phantoms in the shade
And we too shall waste and wane

Hey, this is just another day
And this too shall fade away
We are phantoms in the shade
And we too shall waste and wane
