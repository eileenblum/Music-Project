You are the one to keep us clean
You formed The Great Concavity
Just us or them
No in between
Ensure that red is all we see

Come on Johnny Gentle save us
Come on Johnny Gentle save us
Now

Croon that lullaby so soothing
Croon that lullaby and show us
How
To lock the door and shut the whole world out

You strummed the empire's secret strings
You proved to rule is but to sing
The end game isn't hard to see
Just let the ends dictate the means

Come on Johnny Gentle save us
Come on Johnny Gentle save us
Now

Croon that lullaby so soothing
Croon that lullaby and show us
How
To lock the door and shut the whole world out
