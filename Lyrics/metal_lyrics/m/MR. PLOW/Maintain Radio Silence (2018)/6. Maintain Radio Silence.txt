He was not quite suitable to be a gentleman
He was not quite who you'd think of as a friend
But he's just who you would call to pay for violence
And now we can't call him off
We're in radio silence

No anger
Just cold within
His mission
The living end

No anger
Just cold within
His mission
The living

He was not quite suitable to be a gentleman
He was not quite who you'd think of as a friend
But he's just who you would call to pay for violence
And now we can't call him off
We're in radio silence

No anger
Just cold within
His mission
The living end

No anger
Just cold within
His mission
The living

He was not quite suitable to be a gentleman
He was not quite who you'd think of as a friend
But he's just who you would call to pay for violence
And now we can't call him off
We're in radio silence
