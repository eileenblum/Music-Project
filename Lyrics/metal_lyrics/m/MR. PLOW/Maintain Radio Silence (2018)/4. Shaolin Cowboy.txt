Silent chainsaw meditation
Stillness in shotgun salvation

Demon horde, undead tsunami
Now a silent plain of headless zombies

Dealing death to what's already dead
Calms the tempest in his head

From the center of the Earth to the center of the void
Come what may, come the Shaolin Cowboy

(Die and die and die again)

From the center of the Earth to the center of the void
(Die and die and die again)
Come what may, come the Shaolin Cowboy
(Die and die and die again)

On a divine wind rides a cosmic envoy
(Die and die and die again)
Come what may, come the Shaolin Cowboy

If you gotta die, then make sure you die last
There is no future
And no past

Contemplate a drop in the sea
Perfection, singularity

Channel all the words his master said
Into deserts bathed in red

From the center of the Earth to the center of the void
Come what may, come the Shaolin Cowboy
(Die and die and die again)

From the center of the Earth to the center of the void
(Die and die and die again)
Come what may, come the Shaolin Cowboy
(Die and die and die again)

On a divine wind rides a cosmic envoy
(Die and die and die again)
Come what may, come the Shaolin Cowboy
