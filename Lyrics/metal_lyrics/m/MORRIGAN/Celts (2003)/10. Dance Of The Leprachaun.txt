The rainbow high a rag goblin dancing at midnight
Dance and sing songs of gold desire and sound his voice at dawn
Dreaming light glowing fire in haze shall burning
Flying elves summon the rain falling await he rain seasons in gold

Black ravens call take sorrow of thousand wishes
Dance around fires at midnight enchanted straw away to gold
As cold rain send gates in magic colours
Treasures hidden of the sad and despairings lay behind golden walls

Cry Don't cry I hear the call

Tales become true they told of a little beared devil
Damned to the greed fall in anger and cursing the mystery ask you
Nights come through in a fog a hoarsing whisper shadows
Fall in red soak the mountains and he's dancing for you too

Rain fall the devils call forever shines the
rainbows blind talles die shadows fly scattered in the air

The rainbow high a rag goblin dancing at midnight
Dance and sing songs of gold desire and sound his voice at dawn
Dreaming light glowing fire in haze shall burning
Flying elves summon the rain falling await he rain seasons in gold

Black ravens call take sorrow of thousand wishes
Dance around fires at midnight enchanted straw away to gold
As cold rain send gates in magic colours
Treasures hidden of the sad and despairings lay behind golden walls

Rain fall the devils call forever shines the
Rainbows blind in halls of greedy sanity he cry for ever more
Tales die shadows fly scattered in the air
