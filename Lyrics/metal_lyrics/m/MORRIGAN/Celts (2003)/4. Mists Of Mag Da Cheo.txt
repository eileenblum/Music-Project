On blood red shores I saw faces in the sand
I walk the waters edge touch bleeding hands
The other wind blow bring voices and chants
Raising fanfares where fairies dance

Fire death destruction and war

The one great home appear out of the dark
Flesh and bones and without your blood
Ir crashing the swords far a way thundering hoofes and
The song of the crow
Walk over the green hills seas where life flow

Fire death destruction war

Black deep waters and clouds draw black death winds
Summon the crip of tide
Angelic wings turning black saw devils and souls of ice
Blood runs black to the bottom of the ocean of sins and lies
For hide solitude and song when angels cry
