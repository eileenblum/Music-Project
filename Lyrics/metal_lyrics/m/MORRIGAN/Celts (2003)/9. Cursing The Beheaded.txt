Staring faces ravens corrode eyes sweet warm flesh to die
Scattered bones dark blood in ice told a long forgotten cries
Goddess in black take the fallen back guardians of death and war
Domincering mankind out of the south they stepped bringer of arrogance and laq

Golden armours wooden fortresses a conquering emperor raise
Strike on savage race uprising of a darksome place
Look in dead grow stiffing eyes
Fighting the naked growling war cry thundering shields resound
Cursing the beheaded scalps on heat trample pugnacity in ground

Rotten dead heads impaled in the sun smell of death omnipresent fall
Solite powers wind carry voices out of the horizon the barbarian calls
Staring faces ravens corrode eyes sweet warm flesh to die
Scattered bones dark blood in ice told a long forgotten cries
