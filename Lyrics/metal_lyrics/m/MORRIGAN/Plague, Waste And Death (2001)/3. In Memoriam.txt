Now on trial, and Satan smile
And now you will burn
Armageddon
A soul rambled sad through the shadows of night
Beyond the green hills a voice is singing bright
On the verge of tears and the heaven weep I fall... in memoriam
A burning passion pace till death
A desire to live on give the final rest
Bye my darling, and rest in peace
You fall... in memoriam
A star's flaring bright, appear a foreign night
In trust, you're gone
Armageddon
A soul rambled sad through the shadows of night
Beyond the green hills a voice is singing bright
On the verge of tears and the heaven weep I fall... in memoriam
A burning passion pace till death
A desire to live on give the final rest
Bye my darling, and rest in peace
You fall... in memoriam
And you pass through the gates of Mag Mel
Your dark revenge create an angel of hell
Along an arcade of ice as shadows fall
Let you bid ap - Welcome to our great hall
A soul rambled sad through the shadows of night
Beyond the green hills a voice is singing bright
On the verge of tears and the heaven weep I fall... in memoriam
A burning passion pace till death
A desire to live on give the final rest
Bye my darling, and rest in peace
You fall... in memoriam
