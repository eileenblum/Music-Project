The night raise the shadows and the black bring his live to fall
The sky appear scattered by the axe and raven call, powered by the sword
The sky salvage my fellow, the earth guard my heard
My blood soak the ground, veracity and courage side by side, carry on my heard
The sun send his first rays to gather the cold mourning-rope, reflect in the blade
And take delight, blood in my sword
Colder as ice, carry the glory and call it your own, so call
Tortured eyes, and tarry between the world from time to time, in wooden hall
A candlelight in the world alone
The starry sky the confidant home, out of them you fall
Cry your sweet tears out of the heavy clouds
And travel sublime on the dark mountain side, out of them you call
Through the mountain hell, a crow on my side
Shadows became longer, the Morrigan my bride, and the fairy's call... Fall!
A ear-deafening echo followed, the haughty call
Doubt arise your voice, show humanity in front of the golden walls
Colder as ice, carry the glory and call it your own, so call
Tortured eyes, and tarry between the world from time to time, in wooden hall
A candlelight in the world alone
The starry sky the confidant home, out of them you fall
Cry your sweet tears out of the heavy clouds
And travel sublime on the dark mountain side, out of them you call
