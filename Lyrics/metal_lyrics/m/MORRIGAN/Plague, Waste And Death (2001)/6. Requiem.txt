The ravens follow a path of sorrow and tell
The thought will always be mine
The hell is hollow, the heaven left also
A sky under stars don't shine
And tears fall in a chalice of wine
The wind call a guardian of time
Through golden halls where the stars on the ceiling shine
And along carved death call in my mind
Another morrow let the skyline red glow
And one tell of glory and decline
A hidden shadow, god my fellow
And the ocean disclose the sacrifice of time
And i've seen now an angel who's calling my name
A whore in the moonlight, a sun secret flame
And we danced now together, drink honey and wine
And open the gates to other new time
Another morrow let the skyline red glow
And one tell of glory and decline
A hidden shadow, god my fellow
And the ocean disclose the sacrifice of time
And i've seen now an angel who's calling my name
A whore in the moonlight, a sun secret flame
And we danced now together, drink honey and wine
And open the gates to other new time
A king stands tall, far away a raven's call
A tarry in a world of ice and the void drill into my eyes
Walk along the screen shore where the waves deliver his war
Oh walk in hell and love the devil in thy eyes
