An enchanted wife, who never died
A tortured fear, in heart I hear
And the devils cry, that such beauty die
A sacrifice, the hell demise

This bitch will burn at night

Her bloodred lips, I search to kiss
The flames grow high, oh darling smile
A flesh-vanish sound, urine steep the ground
In the inspired light, the devil's bride

This bitch will burn at night

I've seen you burn, to the death return
Of god beloved, and sentence by witchcraft
The call of the wild, weep about his child
Her hair flaming red, and now she's dead!

This bitch will burn at night
