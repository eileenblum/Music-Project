The death shall rise in the name of the one who closed my eyes
And see through their heads where carry thousand lies
Where the breath of god in fire you baptised
Angel hordes with death powered burn interior to fight
Against the sun the bloodred fire my soul will carry on
As the wind put clouds higher, and howl what you are done
Build churches of the cross, play "god" and put them high
And men with cowls go on a pilgrimage along the black mountain side
Preaching devils and messengers of god, this was the destiny i'd saw
Incure the displeasure of gentlerace and age where the cross bring the law
A lodge in hell, the black evil spell and the servants will open the door
Straight war...
Churches prevail in this foreign dark hell, make the nightsky dark than before
Straight war...
The death shall rise in the name of the one who closed my eyes
And see through their heads where carry thousand lies
Where the breath of god in fire you baptised
Angel hordes with death powered burn interior to fight
See the suns ablaze in the sky where gods be on the point to die
Hear on the hills our children cry, by deliver on funeral-pile
Loaded with death powered by the demons who deathwind rides
Angel hordes thunder over the sky, proclaim the hell stands open wide
Preaching devils as prisoner of god this was the legacy i'd saw
Incure the displeasure of gentlerace and age where the cross bring the law
A lodge in hell, the black evil spell and the servants will open the door
Straight war...
Churches prevail in this foreign dark hell, make the nightsky dark than before
Straight war...
