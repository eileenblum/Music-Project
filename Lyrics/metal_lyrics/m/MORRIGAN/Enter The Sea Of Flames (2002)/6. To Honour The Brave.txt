Forces of lightning strike, storms prevail
Light out of heaven fall, gods would I call
Proud and glory, flesh and blood
Fly up high sad crow, fly through dense clouds

Flying hordes, blazing swords
Up high sentence fall, high I'd call
Hornes far blare, an ravens stare
In fire take care, cries everywhere

Falcons and sirens cry, announce a higher shere
In his arms me fold, death stay long since here
Hills in cool haze, graves in blood
Baptized in fire and snow, gods of an suppress crowd

I bhfag thuas cas ar De'Danann

Voices of thunder, storms prevail
Light out of heaven fall, gods would I call
Proud and glory, flesh and blood
Fly up high sad crow, fly through dense clouds
