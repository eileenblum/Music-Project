Along the heavy deserted shores the twilight unfolds full pride
Black deep waters submit the grip of tide
Carry dragonships in front of thee in a deepred shady light
Comes from foreign shores a sea spread open and wide

Ships of fog with burning sails, a fleet of an requiem raise
Hear the elegy of sea-gulls, hear like ravens cry
Carry mens of virtue, kings and heroes in honour
Proud and might, inflame a fire, sing a farewell and take their soul up high

Up high stars fall, far the ravens call
Shout for ships dressed with fire to heavens wide halls
Fay behind crows eyes, woman of snow and ice
Under the roofs of Valhalla were warriors stand tall

Ships of fog with burning sails, a fleet of an requiem raise
Hear the elegy of sea-gulls, hear like ravens cry
Carry mens of virtue, kings and heroes in honour
Proud and might, inflame a fire, sing a farewell and take their soul up high
