A landscape of shadows, a valley of past
Engraved in fire and snow
Trying the death to a eternal last breath revive and enchanted my soul
Here we are at home
In seasons of mist, angels with hair white as snow
In front of gates mounted with gold
Behind it mighty pillars under a heaven of stone
I remember what an old crone has told
Welcome home

In fire I give back my flesh and my sword
Extinguish sad shadows, time of remorse
I walk in time the eternal green fields
Dusk hills and a bloodred sky above
Here we are at home

The whisper of trees tells of power and fame
The wind tells of battles and blood
A life in pass beyond the green hills
baptized in milk and blood

In comfort of shadows, behind walls of flesh
A desert of sorrow and pain
A grave of despair, denial of the absolute death
A false endeavour to god!?

Through oceans of fire over rivers of blood
Over mountains through forests of pass
A blood-dripping horizon before my eyes
Reveal a waste of death

The whisper of trees tells of power and fame
The wind tells of battles and blood
A nameless "god" beyond the green hills
A battlefield of despair and wrath
Welcome home
