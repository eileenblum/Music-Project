Warriors slain, beg for a place in the sky
A ravens raid, guide your eyes up high
Carry of fire, creatures, strange-force
Carry of time, for you were an old man
Carry me wide

A sweat-stenching race, demand immortality when they die
My eyes disgrace, through arrogance and lies
Greedy desires, pleasures, strength, vannt
Suppliant cries, yearning for an old land
Oh, carry me wide

Father, I don't accept my destiny, you fall
Don't deride me, the hell is yours and mine
Oh, it's not thy death or my belief would I call
Then request me, my pass will be darker than thine
Fall in grace, I was thirteen when I died
A blooming maze of egoism, hate and lies
Carry of fire, creatures, strange-force
Carry of time, listen to an old man
Carry me wide

A mental waste, a simple essence of Christ
Godfearing haze, destroyers in bloodred skies
Greedy desires, pleasures, strength, vannt
Suppliant cries, yearning for an old hand
Oh, carry me wide
