In proud hearts a winter returns,
The oath of the burning skies,
Convents burn where towers grow,
A bastard will be enter.

Through the flames I see him,
In pure souls he entry,
The elder will call them,
Another death I will return.

In proud hearts a winter returns,
Between the ranges death winds blow,
Forbidden gods and take pride,
The new death will be enter.

Demons and shadows of the universe,
Deny of all what exist,
Pilgrim and pray to him,
Pray the everlasting war...
