Thundering storms, skies in flames, shores in the grip of tide,
Beyond the hills like roaring hell, whispers of the men who died.

Call of the elders over the mountains blowing,
Return in thousand names from this mountain-side.

Many blazing fires, souls in black in their shadows hide,
Raging demons behind elevated hills we hear the devil's cries.

Call of the elders over the mountains blowing,
Call to be enter to this mountain-side.

At dawn the last time she cry.

Call of the elders over the mountains blowing,
Call to be enter to this mountain-side.

At dawn the first time we die.

Call of the elders over the mountains blowing,
Call to be enter to this mountain-side.

In hell we sill enter the crow is calling,
Call to be enter to this mountain-side.

She had told at Samhain we die, and hold my sword up high,
Hear the ravens cry, see the eagles fly, don't be afraid,
And now close your eyes...
