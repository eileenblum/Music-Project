Thundering shields the front in fear,
In the ranges glorious songs I hear,
The first feats scattered with pride,
With raising swords at dawn we ride.

Live and fight, come praise the bitch

The devil's creatures in armours of gold,
Rotten heads in hands then hold,
Gods of fire, the whisper of despair,
The crow await, the life is here.

Live and fight, come praise the bitch

Cries, Dreams, War

Between the sword of the enemies the raven cries,
Behind the hills the savious chat will rise,
Nobody close his eyes with fear,
As pounding hoofs, in front we hear.

Thundering shields the front in fear,
In the ranges glorious songs I hear,
The first feats scattered with pride,
With raising swords at dawn we ride.

Live and fight, come praise the bitch
