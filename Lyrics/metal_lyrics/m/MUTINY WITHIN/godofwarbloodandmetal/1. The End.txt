Is this all in my headAm I holding on too tightIt's all I can doSo helpless. Hear as I'm screaming these wordsI can't convey what's  no heardLive in a lieForget all this timeHow can you tell me that it's alright. How can this just be the endHave we been blindHollow insideI'm falling apart but there's no way to save me. Hear as I'm screaming these wordsI can't convey what's not heardLive in a lieForget all this time. How can this just be the endHave we been blindHollow insideI'm falling apart but there's no way to save me. Why can't you seen in my eyesThat I'm aliveForget the pastAs the memories fade away. Don't save meDon't save me How can this just be the endHave we been blindHollow insideI'm falling apart but there's no way to save me. Why can't  you see in my eyesThat I'm aliveForget the pastAs the memories fade away. Don't save me (fade away)Don't save me (fade away)
