These dead walls confine me
As vacant as my mind
I see the end upon me there's no savior
So heal me this pain can't last forever
I feel my wings are burning

Maybe I'm not forsaken
The silence speaks the words unspoken
Behind the tears there is salvation
Behind the hurt a new beginning

Lift my head up high
I try to catch my breath
Stay awake to stop from going under
So heal me before I'm lost forever
Oh I ask forgiveness

Maybe I'm not forsaken
The silence speaks the words unspoken
Behind the tears there is salvation
Behind the hurt a new beginning
