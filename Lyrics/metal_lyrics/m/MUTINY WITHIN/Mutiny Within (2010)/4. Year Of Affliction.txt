Display the image cloud the concealed
Betray your idolized conception
Egocentric, enshrouded in a lie
Cut the connection to my heart

Dejected, Chimera
Envision virtue
Rejection, consumes me

Take what was mine
My afflictions are all that I have
Time takes me away
From this year of affliction

Break down the artificial effigy
No respect, no integrity
Lift me up to drop the bombshell
This infection can't deny me

Rejection consumes me

Take what was mine
My afflictions are all that I have
Time takes me away
From this year of affliction
Take what was mine
My afflictions are all that I have
Time takes me away
From this year of affliction

Watch you fall from my arms
Tear me down it's so cold
So cold
So cold

Take what was mine
My afflictions are all that I have
Time takes me away
From this year of affliction
Take what was mine
My afflictions are all that I have
Time takes me away
From this year of affliction
