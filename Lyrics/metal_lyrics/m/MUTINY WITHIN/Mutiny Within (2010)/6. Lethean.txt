Far beyond the point of turning
Enslaved in freedom
Can't see invisible chains
But still we feel them

Get in line, walk to your end
We're driving our demise
Shape your fate with every step you take

Adrift in the river, the river of strife
Forget to remember what's dead inside

Like lambs to slaughter we're lead astray
Just pawns in a game called life
So overburdened

Adrift in the river, the river of strife
Forget to remember what's dead inside
Dead inside

Just decay
Can't betray the system
Seize today
Find a way to forget

I close my eye's the memory's gone

Adrift in the river, the river of strife
(We've lost our way)
Forget to remember what's dead inside,
(We drink from Lethean)
