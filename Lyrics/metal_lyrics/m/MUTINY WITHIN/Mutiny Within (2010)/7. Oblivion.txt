Ascend the defection of this life
Can't live forever with the lies so callous
Separate all the bonds that would blind us
Disconnecting from the heartache

Take apart our disguise

Do we transcend this life
Everything that reminds me of all that I've known
Take apart the disguise
And see through your lies

Neglected we survive
Abandoned, ruined, cast aside
So worthless

Do we transcend this life
Everything that reminds me of all that I've known
Take apart the disguise
And see through your lies
We're trapped in silence
Take apart the disguise
And see through your lies

We are oblivion
Fade to grey
Betray you
Fall away
Fall away
Descending

Do we transcend this life
Everything that reminds me of all that I've known
Take apart the disguise
And see through your lies
We're trapped in silence
Take apart the disguise
And see through your lies
