On the verge of slipping away

Descending existence
We let go, we are our weakness
Fixation damnation
Don't bruise my conscience

Is this the fate you've made (fate you've made)
The hour comes

Time does not wait
We're stand alone in the darkness
The hourglass turns
Nothing's changed

On the verge of slipping away

Surrender forever
All alone in the great divide
Remember this moment
Don't bruise my conscience

Time does not wait
We're stand alone in the darkness
The hourglass turns
Nothing's changed

Days turn to years
Now we're facing our fears
The hour's upon us
We walk to our fate in the darkness

Time does not wait
We're stand alone in the darkness
The hourglass turns
Nothing's changedTime does not wait
We're stand alone in the darkness
The hourglass turns
Nothing's changed
