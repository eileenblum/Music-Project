Play the game
Pass the blame
Hollow truth ends in shame
Live alone to die with wisdom
Live to hate
Instigate
All that I ever had
Is the path to our conviction

Let me survive
I suffer alone
Without a prayer
Feed me on lies
Starve me of life
Just break me

Suffocate
Segregate
Do we cry in vain
Are we lost in conviction
Die away fall astray
Can't smother my pain
You never think to question why

This is the path to our conviction

Live to hate
Instigate
All that I ever had
Is the path to our conviction

Let me survive
I suffer alone
Without a prayer
Feed me on lies
Starve me of life
Just break me

Suffocate
Segregate
Do we cry in vain
Are we lost in conviction
Die away fall astray
Can't smother my pain
You never think to question why

Without a thought
We forget hope
Help me remember why (remember)
We are still so far from this life (so far away)
Is this a dream
Why does it feel so real (no longer)
All so unreal

Suffocate
Segregate
Do we cry in vain
Are we lost in conviction
Die away fall astray
Can't smother my pain
You never think to question why
