I'm falling away
Feels like I'm drifting away from what I was
This feeling sinks like stones
Find I'm giving in
Lose my grip as it pulls me under

Believe the day is not lost
We still have our broken dreams
Give me a hope to hold onto
A light in the dark

Lift me up
I am falling forever
Adrift in an endless night
We burn, now as the daylight scars my eyes

I'm shattered yet whole
In the wake of despair
You pulled the trigger and ran
I bleed the pain you made
The blood red affection
As you pour your heart out

Give me a hope to hold onto
A light in the dark

Lift me up
I am falling forever
Adrift in an endless night
We burn now as the daylight scars my eyes

These dreams always fall aside (fall aside)
These dreams all but left behind

Fall aside
Fall aside

Lift me up
I am falling forever
Adrift in an endless night
We burn now as the daylight scars my eyes
Lift me up
I am falling forever
Adrift in an endless night
We burn now as the daylight scars my eyes
