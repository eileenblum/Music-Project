Try to control my senses
Inside the picture is lifeless
An instance in my head
The image so blissful

Reminds me of all that I've had
(And all that I've lost)
The image will fade

But I can't let go of the memory
It's all in my head
And I can't hold on to what's gone
Time breaks me down

Try to forget what's haunting me
Destroy what's reminding
Leave behind what's inside me

The Image will fade
But I can't let go of the memory
It's all in my head
And I can't hold on to what's gone
Time breaks me down

I can't hold on (I can't hold on)
It haunts me

But I can't let go of the memory
It's all in my head
And i can't hold on to what's gone
Time breaks me
I can't let go of the memory
It's all in my head
And I can't hold on to what's gone
Time breaks me down
