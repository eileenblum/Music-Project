I'm calling your name,
So what's left of this broken dream?
Tattered and torn,
Do we cry
Do we find that we're breaking (just breaking),
We're helpless (just helpless)
Can't stand this, Is this all that's left?

Sorrow breaks me down, it's crushing me tonight
But I feel alive, somewhere inside

Tattered and torn, do we cry
Do we find that we're breaking (just breaking),
We're helpless (just helpless)
Find me something I could be,
Find me something I should be

Sorrow breaks me down, it's crushing me tonight
But I feel alive, somewhere inside
Sorrow breaks me down, it's crushing me tonight
But I feel alive, somewhere inside

What can I say,
With the weight of the world upon me?
What can I say,
With the weight of the world upon me?

Sorrow breaks me down, it's crushing me tonight
But I feel alive, somewhere inside
Sorrow breaks me down, it's crushing me tonight
But I feel alive, somewhere inside
