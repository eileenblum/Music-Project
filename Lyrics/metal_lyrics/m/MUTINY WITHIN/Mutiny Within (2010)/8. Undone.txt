Turn away as the daylight fades to grey
It's crashing around you
No regrets but the bitter taste of failure
As the innocence fades away (fades away)

I'm hollow

I feel the night taking away what's mine, forgive me
I am undone, tell me you know I'm sorry
You're all that I have

Another day, another chance to be forsaken
You're gone with the sunrise
Torn apart and I can't forget this memory
It's burning inside my head
Seeks to breaks me

I feel the night taking away what's mine, forgive me
I am undone, tell me you know I'm sorry
You're all that I have

No one can save me (cannot save myself)
I cannot see the light

I feel the night taking away what's mine, forgive me
I am undone, tell me you know I'm sorry
I feel the night taking away what's mine, forgive me
I am undone, tell me you know I'm sorry
