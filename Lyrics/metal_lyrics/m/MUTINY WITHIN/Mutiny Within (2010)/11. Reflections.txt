Try as you might I won't give in now
As you wear me down
Looking for something you've lost inside yourself

See your reflection now you can't deny
Looking through your mind
The truth is a lie you've buried inside

These perceptions
Misconceptions
They're in your head
They're in your head

Your world's collapsing but still you deny
What you've found inside
The ignorant bliss you're hiding behind

These perceptions
Misconceptions
They're in your head
They're in you
Just reflections
Misconceptions
They're in your head
They're in your head

So breathe new life
My heart gets left behind
Once more

Heart gets left behind
My heart gets left behind once more

In your eyes
These perceptions
Misconceptions
They're in your head
They're in you
Just reflections
Misconceptions
They're in your head
They're in your head
