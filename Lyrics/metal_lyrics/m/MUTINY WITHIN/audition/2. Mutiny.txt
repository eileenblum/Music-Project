Risen the day, replenish the wayAll life is never endingI'll say it today, I hope you rememberThe lighting leads to thunder My life is realityYours is nothing beneath meTry to fight, attempt to lieMy friend, right now, YOU MUST DIE Coming through, the night calls and now you fall into aspinning image, a realist must forgetThe night is almost overRepeat the same mistake, learn it all, losing fate I'm finding hell quite pleasingI want to stay, don't take me away... From the place I call homeI'd rather die than be aloneWonder lets me breatheI'm part of you, you're part of me, it's a Mutiny
