In the heat of the flamesI leave my mark on their namesA cryptic scripture to taunt my victims forth I will not stopI will kill againI will rise to the top Coming from the dragon's denEntity will be my slaveComing forth, we'll rise again Time and time to extracateLuck of the legion, extracting the treasonI bet, we will be better off, my godBetter than it BEFORE We're all in lustTrust turns to dustThe past leads nowhereWe all must breathe again You take the blameYou're still the sameI will rise to the top Time and time to extracateLuck of the legion, extracting the treasonI bet, we will be better off, my godBetter than it BEFORE THE DAYBLOOD WILL SHED ON THEEBLIND TO SIGHTI WILL WALK FREE
