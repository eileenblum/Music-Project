The sound of silence screams again
Rising me once more
Creeping dark eclipses sunlight
Reminding me of your contour...

Smell of demons lingure
Possessing my mind
Can't escape these autumns past
Gaging from the inside
Your mind will lay in hell

A blackened night excites my desire
A fire to burn you alive
Cast out to brightening
Cast out to frighten your soul

Covering land and all that has been
No hope for mankind to survive
Your world reduced to nothing at ALL

Nightshade
Eclipsing your mind
Nightshade
Eclipsing your mind
