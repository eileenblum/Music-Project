It never was the same,
It never seemed so simple,
Never seemed so wrong,
Never seemed to care,

What if all I said,
What if all I've done,
Is everything that's left,
You're everything I've got,

How could I ever want,
To slip away,
Pretend it never was,
It's always the same,
How could you ever want,
To walk away,
Pretend that I could carry on,
Never again.

I never was insane,
I never thought to question,
Never took your blame,
You never seemed to notice,

What if all I said,
What if all i've done,
Is everything that's left,
You're everything I've got,

What if all I saw,
What if all I had,
Was everything you took,
And now I've nothing left.

How could I ever want,
To slip away,
Pretend it never was,
It's always the same,
How could you ever want,
To walk away,
Pretend that I could carry on,
Never again.

So I make my last stand,
I fight for my heart to survive,
No last words,
No goodbye,
Never a chance to remember.

(Could I ever want?)
(Could I ever have?)

How could I ever want,
To slip away,
Pretend it never was,
It's always the same,
How could you ever want,
To walk away,
Pretend that I could carry on,
Never again.

(How could I ever want)
Never again (to slip away),
(pretend it never was)
Never again (it's always the same),
(how could you ever want)
Never again (to walk away),
(pretend that I could carry on)
Never again.
