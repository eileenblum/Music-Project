Turn out the lights,Â 
Turn out the lights,Â 

How could I have known,Â 
Still left in the wake of life,Â 
A void in my heart grows,Â 
Just can't take no more,Â 
And I can't see all that I leave behind,Â 
Can't cry these tears no more,Â 

So sorry,Â 
I'm just coming the end,Â 
Forgive me,Â 
Let me be,Â 
Just let me go,Â 

Turn out the lights,Â 
I close my eyes and say goodnight,Â 
Turn out the lights,Â 
Remember me,Â 
Goodbye, I'm sorry,Â 

Bid this life farewell,Â 
Sever all the hurt and set me free,Â 
Gone not forgotten,Â 
Just can't take no more,Â 
And I can't see all that I leave behind,Â 
Can't cry these tears no more,Â 

So sorry,Â 
I'm just coming the end,Â 
Forgive me,Â 
Let me be,Â 
Just let me go,Â 

Turn out the lights,Â 
I close my eyes and say goodnight,Â 
Turn out the lights,Â 
Remember me,Â 
Goodbye, I'm sorry,Â 

Grieve no more my friend,Â 
I can't go on,Â 
Bid farewell to this world,Â 
Take my hand,Â 
All I ask is forgive me as I,Â 
Turn out the lights,Â 

Turn out the lights,Â 
I close my eyes and say goodnight,Â 
Turn out the lights,Â 
Remember me,Â 
Goodbye, I'm sorry
