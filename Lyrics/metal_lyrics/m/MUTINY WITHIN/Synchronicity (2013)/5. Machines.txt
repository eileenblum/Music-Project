Just machines clothed in fleshÂ 
Surrounded by the flaws of our own creationÂ 
Walk the line between life and deathÂ 
Surrounded by our minds delusionÂ 
No more,Â 
The time is now,Â 

Disconnected from this life,Â 
You've failed me,Â 
And from the ashes of my smile,Â 
The hate burns,Â 

Can't rebel, only serve to demiseÂ 
To tread this world which we one day becomeÂ 
We feed the world with the life that we've lostÂ 
Consumed by what we reveredÂ 

No saviour is coming for you,Â 
Just the black in your empty your soul,Â 
Live to die, die to give life,Â 
As my dreams tour to dust and bones.Â 

Disconnected from this life,Â 
You've failed me,Â 
And from the ashes of my smile,Â 
The hate burns,Â 

Disconnected from this life,Â 
And from the ashes of my smile,Â 
The hate burns,Â 

Disconnected from this life,Â 
And from the ashes of my smile,Â 
The hate burns,
