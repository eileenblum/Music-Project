I wallow in shame,Â 
At things I've done,Â 
Delusion, Denial,Â 
Can you bear not to breathe,Â 
The poison words,Â 
Pour out from my conscience,Â 

So sick of waiting for a sign to light my way,Â 
So sick of failing,Â 

I never said these words to you,Â 
I can't just surrender,Â 
I can't fade away,Â 
Don't let me fall,Â 

So leave it all behind,Â 
As the hurt just fades away,Â 
Never understand,Â 
Just a memory,Â 

The heartache begins,Â 
A voice in my head,Â 
Calls out for my torment,Â 
The wings that I earned,Â 
Blackened with fire,Â 
Burn my salvation,Â 

So sick of waiting for a sign to light my way,Â 
So sick of failing,Â 

I never said these words to you,Â 
I can't just surrender,Â 
I can't fade away,Â 
Don't let me fall,Â 

So leave it all behind,Â 
As the hurt just fades away,Â 
Never understand,Â 
Just a memory,Â 
So leave it all behind,Â 
As the hurt just fades away,Â 
Never understand,Â 
Just a memory,Â 

Oh what becomes,Â 
Just a voice in my head,Â 

All I am,Â 
Never understand the reasons why,Â 
Oh my endless devotion,Â 

So leave it all behind,Â 
As the hurt just fades away,Â 
Never understand,Â 
Just a memory,Â 
So leave it all behind,Â 
As the hurt just fades away,Â 
Never understand,Â 
Just a memory,
