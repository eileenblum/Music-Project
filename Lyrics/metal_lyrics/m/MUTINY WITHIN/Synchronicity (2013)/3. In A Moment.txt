Look in my eyes,Â 
There's no words you can say,Â 
The emptiness hurts,Â 
A moment in time,Â 
So etched in my mind,Â 
Can't wait for what's gone,Â 

What's left of this life,Â 
My days seem so numbered,Â 
I hang in a moment,Â 
The memories replay as I'm frozen in time,Â 
When you said goodbye,Â 

I'm holding on with everything heart beat,Â 
Lost as the moment takes me away,Â 

I'm turning the page,Â 
I walk to the light,Â 
I stand for a moment,Â 
Save the tears,Â 
This is the last time,Â 
I said goodbye,Â 

I'm holding on with everything heart beat,Â 
Lost as the moment takes me away,Â 
I try to go on,Â 
With every last breath that I take,Â 
Lost as the moment takes me away,Â 

Failing to save what's left,Â 
Regrets don't change what's lost,Â 

I'm holding on with everything heart beat,Â 
Lost as the moment takes me away,Â 
I try to go on,Â 
With every last breath that I take,Â 
Lost as the moment takes me away
