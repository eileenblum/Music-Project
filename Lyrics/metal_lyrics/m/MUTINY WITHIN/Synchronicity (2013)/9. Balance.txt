There's a point that we won't cross,Â 
A limitation of what's right,Â 
So draw a line into the sand,Â 
Take your side, make your standÂ 
It's all on youÂ 

Can't take this away from you,Â 
Never a doubt in mind,Â 
It's all on you,Â 

Raise up my headÂ 
Rain starts to fallÂ 
Drops of my conscienceÂ 
Soak through my soulÂ 
Burning aliveÂ 
Just give me this life,Â 
And wake me up again,Â 

No remorse,Â 
No repent,Â 
Not a second guessing why,Â 
Fuel the fires that will burn us all,Â 

Burn me alive,Â 
You're so far away from me,Â 
Never a time,Â 
Never a second goes by,Â 

Raise up my headÂ 
Rain starts to fallÂ 
Drops of my conscienceÂ 
Soak through my soulÂ 
Burning aliveÂ 
Just give me this life,Â 
And wake me up again,Â 
Raise up my headÂ 
Rain starts to fallÂ 
Drops of my conscienceÂ 
Soak through my soulÂ 
And wake me up again,Â 

[Speech:]
Unity is what will bring this to an end. Not looking the other way because it doesn't affect us in the moment. It will affect us eventually. And look at your children and grandchildren in the face I say to those people, and tell them what you were doing.Â 
Enough of being enslaved by these people. Enough of being enslaved by our manipulated ignorance. Enough of being enslaved by the fear of being who we are.Â 

Raise up my headÂ 
Rain starts to fallÂ 
Drops of my conscienceÂ 
Soak through my soulÂ 
Burning aliveÂ 
Just give me this life,Â 
And wake me up again,Â 
Raise up my headÂ 
Rain starts to fallÂ 
Drops of my conscienceÂ 
Soak through my soulÂ 
And wake me up again
