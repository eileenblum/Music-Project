I walk the shadows of my dreams,Â 
I sign my fate with blood,Â 
These wings so old,Â 
My eyes so cold,Â 
No longer can I feel,Â 

Asleep no more,Â 
Break my oppression,Â 
Release,Â 
Wake up,Â 

When all we have falls to pieces,Â 
And the world that we know is no more,Â 
Will you still say I am with you,Â 
In this world that's so cold,Â 

Visions of life,Â 
But this is the end,Â 
Find oppression in freedom,Â 
Agenda aligns,Â 
Consigned to demise,Â 
Ruination eternal,Â 

When all we have falls to pieces,Â 
And the world that we know is no more,Â 
Will you still say I am with you,Â 
In this world that's so cold,
