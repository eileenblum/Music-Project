No more sorrow,Â 
Now I pay the price,Â 

Will this world turn around for me,Â 
Or have I take my final turn,Â 
No more salvation,Â 
An ending never in stone,Â 

I know I can't touch you,Â 
You're still in my head,Â 
And it's hard just to let you go,Â 
I know you're not with me,Â 
You're part of my soul,Â 
And I can't deny you,Â 

Give me the strength to walk away from this,Â 
I am fighting,Â 
But getting nowhere,Â 
Hollow nothing,Â 
Can't forget this,Â 
Just a soul in a sea of woe,Â 

I know I can't touch you,Â 
You're still in my head,Â 
And it's hard just to let you go,Â 
I know you're not with me,Â 
You're part of my soul,Â 
And I can't deny you,Â 

Sorrow,Â 
Consumes my soul,Â 
Once more,Â 
Once moreÂ 

I can't justify this life,Â 
I have no reason to start again,Â 
Can't forget what I've become,Â 

I know I can't touch you,Â 
You're still in my head,Â 
And it's hard just to let you go,Â 
I know you're not with me,Â 
You're part of my soul,Â 
And I can't deny you
