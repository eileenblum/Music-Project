Wake up,Â 
Take away all my aching,Â 
I won't live to see this end,Â 
Turn away,Â 
From the hopeless depending,Â 
Oh I turn to you again,Â 

You're in my veins,Â 
And I can't live without out,Â 
Breath until you're hear again,Â 
I'm dying in my arms,Â 

Never thought it would be over,Â 
Never thought the day would end,Â 
But such is life,Â 
And here is the ending,Â 
I'll embrace the pain again,Â 

So disconnected,Â 
Can't break free,Â 
Numb and rejected,Â 
I can't breatheÂ 

You're in my veins,Â 
And I can't live without out,Â 
Breath until you're hear again,Â 
I'm dying in my arms,Â 

I can't wake from this sleep,Â 
But I still hear you,Â 
There's no absolution?Â 
You can't save me,Â 

I can't wake from this sleep,Â 
But I still hear you whisperÂ 
Is this absolution?Â 
I'm so lost in you,Â 

You're in my veins,Â 
And I can't live without out,Â 
Breath until you're hear again,Â 
I'm dying in my arms,Â 

I've lost my way,Â 
I can't breathe without out,Â 
Feel until you're hear again,Â 
So lifeless in your arms
