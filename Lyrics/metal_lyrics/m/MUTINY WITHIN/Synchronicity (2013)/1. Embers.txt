Shatter dreams made of gold,
Priceless nothings,
I've got nothing left,
Oh save me,

What as the world burns tonight,
Never to ignite again,
These flames so old,
Oh can you still hear me?

Cry out in vain? (cry out in vain)
'cos the story's the same (can't say goodbye)
If the embers keep burning,
We'll keep it alive,
There's still time to save this life,

Just a light in my head,
Never to burn like a flame,
Just a dream that died,
Oh can you still hear me?

Cry out in vain? (cry out in vain)
'cos the story's the same (can't say goodbye)
If the embers keep burning,
We'll keep it alive,
There's still time to save this life,

We are burning,
We are burning inside,
We burn 'til the fires go cold inside,

Cry out in vain? (cry out in vain)
'cos the story's the same (can't say goodbye)
If the embers keep burning,
We'll keep it alive,
There's still time to save this life,
If the world keeps on turning,
We'll keep it alive,
There's still time to save this life
