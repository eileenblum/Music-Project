I won't remember you,Â 
When the day is dead and gone,Â 
Won't be a thought,Â 
Won't be a memory,Â 
I fall into sleep,Â 

Time slips away,Â 
And all the things we are,Â 
Only memories,Â 
Just dust and bones,Â 
Time slips away,Â 

Oh the day is dead, so gone,Â 
Won't be a thought,Â 
Won't be a memory,Â 
I fall into sleep,Â 

We can't survive,Â 
As our words turn to stone,Â 
And our memories fade away,Â 
How could time ever mend,Â 
The dreams of a broken life,Â 
So I wait 'til the end,Â 

Time slips away,Â 
And all the things we are,Â 
Only memories,Â 
Just dust and bones,Â 
Time slips away,Â 
Time slips away
