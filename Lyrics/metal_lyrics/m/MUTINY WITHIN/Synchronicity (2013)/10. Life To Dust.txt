We are the last,Â 
The ones who survive,Â 
Through the years of our unmaking,Â 
But I can't go you without you,Â 

Something breaks all of our will to be,Â 
We stumble but this time we fall,Â 
Just let me breathe,Â 

This time it's coming,Â 
Can't run,Â 
This will befall,Â 
Our consequence,Â 

We sever the ties,Â 
Break our oppression,Â 
And realise what's gone,Â 

It breaks like glass,Â 
Shatters, so long,Â 
As the tides, they turn against me,Â 
But I can't hold on,Â 

This time it's coming,Â 
Can't run,Â 
This will befall,Â 
Our consequence,Â 

We sever the ties,Â 
Break our oppression,Â 
And come alive,Â 
Watch our love die,Â 
In a world of obsession,Â 
From life,Â 
To dust,Â 

Will of fate,Â 
I lay you down,Â 
And bury in tears,Â 
I hide,Â 
Can't stay here forever,Â 
I'm holding on yesterday,Â 
Yeah, yeah,Â 
I'm holding on to yesterday,Â 

We sever the ties,Â 
Break our oppression,Â 
And come alive,Â 
Watch our love die,Â 
In a world of obsession,Â 
From life,Â 
To dust
