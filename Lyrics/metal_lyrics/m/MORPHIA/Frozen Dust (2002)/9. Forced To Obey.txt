As I was laying
In the silence of the night
I heard voices speak to me 
Looking around
For one who called my name
No human was there around me

Dark voices in my head
Commanding me...
Dark voices in my head
Forcing me to do...
Giving me thoughts
I never had before
I feel such anguish 

I must, I've got to do what I don't want 
Get ahead of what will happen 

I can't stand for what I do anymore
Forced to obey the dark voices I hear
Forced by the fear of what will come
The control is taken of me

I can't lose the dark voices in my head
Maybe I'm better of dead
I can't find rest in my head anymore
Help me and take them away 

Voices in my head
