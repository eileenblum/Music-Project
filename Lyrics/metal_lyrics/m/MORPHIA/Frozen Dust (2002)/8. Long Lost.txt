I float away over a sea 
Surrounded by darkest mist 
Dark colours all around
And nothing left to see

But still I try to find my way 
Where should I go 'cause I don't know
I point my eyes towards the sun 
And hope it guides me to my goal 

The darkest grey is high above
Will tear apart and drift away
The deepest blue soon will appear
And the light will start to shine
Where darkness was now light will be 
And then I see what's around me
But still I try to find my way 
Where should I go 'cause I don't know

My journey now goes on and on 
And while it lasts 
I see all those places
Some I like and some I don't
Some are frightening 
And some are the most beautiful 

But still I try to find my way 
Where should I go 'cause I don't know
I point my eyes towards the sun 
And hope it guides me to my goal 
My destiny, what is that
Who am I, What should I do 
What's my goal, my destiny 

I'm 
Long
Lost
