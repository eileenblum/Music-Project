I wipe the void from my eyes 
The darkness passed away 
Where ever I look I see...
You
The light of another day 

I let your warmth embrace me 
It forms an auriol of light
In which evil cannot trace me 
Returning to the dead of night

You the one
My live has just begun 
In my dreams 
I was told you'd come
The sun 

But sometimes darkness turns back 
An eclipse that blocks my sight 
It makes my past surround me 
It puts me back into the night

I'm held back 
I am trying to
Free myself
I yearn for you

You... The light
You... The loved one
You... The circle
You... The Sun
