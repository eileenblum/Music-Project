In mystic mist
These moorlands mourn 
Leaving colours
Still unborn 

The mountain road
By clouds concealed 
Forever winding 
Through fogbound fields

I, just I
And I alone
Am lost in heather
And stacks of stone

Graft and drizzle
Gloom and grey 
Wicklow calls
I drift away 

On the hills of the Irish lands
You will not see the sun 
The ancient celtic legends
Will entangle anyone 
And in the end when you descend
You'll be another man 
You'll need a pint of Guinness 
To regain yourself again 

Sun for clouds 
Blue for grey 
Wicklow has let me
Go again 

Life and laughter 
Down below
In a town called
Glendalough
