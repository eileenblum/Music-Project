These empty promises
Begin to hold me down
These aching momories
Turn back from time

Beyond my dreams 
The past is closing in 
Again I hear it's voice 
Whispering

I am not what you see
See me I'm dying again 
Again I'm too weak for this
This empty life

Help me now
I'm choking 
Against my will
Drowning
Forced to smile and to live

Darkness fills my life 
Again I slowly die 
Life is to much for me now
Again 
I wish I were not here
Facing al my fears
Take my pain 
And heal me now
Again
