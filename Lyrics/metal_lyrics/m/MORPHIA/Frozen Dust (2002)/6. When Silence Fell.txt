When silence fell
Over the earth
The war has ended
But what's it worth 

When silence fell
Over the day 
The living colours
Were torn away 

When silence fell 
Over the night
The difference compared to day 
Was nor the light

When silence fell
Over mankind
Forgotten is
What's left behind

What is silence like
When there's no one left to hear it
Armageddon's bound to happen 
Yet no one's prepared  to fear it
No one has made the difference 
No one has made the change
Now smoke is rising
From our smouldering remains

When silence fell
On life itself 
Even God is 
put on a shelf

When silence falls 
On you tonight 
Then you think of how
To make this right
