I'm walking through the forest 
Of my life 

When I enter the forest 
The forest of my life
There's not even a light
To lighten my path 

And as the years of
Growing pains pass by 
I expexperience hope
Like a beautiful sonorous lake 

The lake is surrounded 
By mighty trees
Sunlight pours through 
The leaves of the branched trees 

I persist the walking
Through the forest
As around me 
Storm clouds gather

But I try to forget 
The storm haunting me
By looking towards the
Deep blue sky 

I'm still walking through the forest 
My whole life will be in there
What do you experience 
In the forest of your life
