Here I go again
My closest friend
Has walked the path of heaven
Just when you think your life is endless
You'll be reminded of
How nothing last forever
See me falling down
I need someone.
To put my heart together
A million pieces scattered

I long to see your face
I'm gonna hide you in a place
Where even death can't make us part
I'll keep you locked into my heart
Until we meet again
And I'll live again
When we have joined forever
Eventually together

Your light had died
Your eyes, so cold and empty
You have gone, where are you
How I yearn to
Be there where you are
No matter how far
Someone tell me what it takes to see you
I would leave it all behind to see you
I would leave this world behind you

And every night I float away
Into a tranquil sleep
In every dream I am foretold
Of the day we'll meet

I mourn of you
I yearn for you

Here I go again
My closest friend
Has walked the path of heaven
Now I know why life's not endless
It's a reminder of
The meaning of forever
