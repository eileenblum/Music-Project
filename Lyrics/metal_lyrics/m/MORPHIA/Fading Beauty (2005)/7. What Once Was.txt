The smothering darkness drifted away
The sky has cleared for me now
I see now what my purpose is
I'm no longer floating away
When she came into my life
Everything just fell into place
My pain and grief were washed away
And the light started to shine

What I have always looked for
Has now come to my path

When she came into my life
Everything just fell into lace
My pain and grief were washed away
And the light started to shine

Screaming hard and bursting through
My beating heart has been ripped out
All my colors torn away
Only left the deepest black
I went back the way it was
Surrounded by the darkest mist
I once still had the will to live

What has passes now
Flashes before my eyes
It is all coming black
Like cloud into my mind
It is getting clear
What has come to pass
She came into my life
I found my peace
And felt at ease

The she suddenly died
Taken by what consumed her
It drove her insane
Lost her senses, lost her smile
Lost her long blond hair

take by what consumed her
It drove her insane
When she just could bear no more
It took her away

Screaming heard and bursting through
My beating hear has been ripped out
All my colors torn away
Only left the deepest black

It went back the way it was
Surrounded by the darkest mist
I once still had the will to live
But that has come to an end
