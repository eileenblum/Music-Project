Here I am
Wondering where you are
Those same thoughts
Come to me again
Please release me
From this pain
There must be a way
To ease this hurt again
Let me know
Let me find
The way to go
Let me see
Let me hear
The way to you again

Once all I had - now gone
Once all I loved - now gone
Once all I saw - now gone
Once all I've let go

I look in your eyes and know
This sparkling flame becomes a fire
A fire that embraces us both
Nothing more or less between us
Nothing more to feel

Drawing tears
I wipe from my face
Is it true I'll never feel
your warm embrace?
Those same thought
Come to me again

There must be a way
To ease this hurt again
Let me know
Let me find
The way to go
Let me see
Let me hear
The way to you again

Nothing more to see than this
This felling I'll keep forever
Forever in my soul, mind and heart
Hard to feel nothing than this
To feel nothing more than this

Nothing more to see
