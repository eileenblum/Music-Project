Endless dreams flowing silently
Like wins against my face
Like a lost youth that comes back to me
It speaks to me

Ascending visions of my agony
They force me to confess
That time is now
And they are echoes of my memories

Leaving colors of my blackened sight
In tears behind
Must find the way, just leave the pain
Struggling trough an other day

Take a rum to the water
Wash away all my deepest pains
Forget the past and the present
And take me to another day

The sleepless night I left behind
Facing just another day
Drawing tears, I weep inside
Trying to find my way
I will do anything
To change the things I did wrong
Now take me to another day

Endless dreams flowing silently
Like wind against my face
Like a lost youth that comes back to me
It speaks to me
It waits for me
It follows me everywhere
Everywhere I go

Take a run to the water
(release me)
Wash away all my deepest pains
(no longer imprisoned)
Forget the past and the present
(take me to another day)
And take me to another day

And as I stare into this dark cold water
I see my own reflected pain
Will it take long, for the sun
To shine upon and warm me?
Will death come silently?
Oh, this cold remembrance
I say goodbye now
Oh, how I long to sleep forever
I'm gone
