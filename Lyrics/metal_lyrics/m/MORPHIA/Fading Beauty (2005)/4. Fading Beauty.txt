When the dark and cold winterdays
Are drawing near
And the snow is falling down
When the northern winds are howling
In remembrance of you

I still see your shining face again
Your amazing beauty
Always turned this wretch into a man

We assumed it would never end
But time was not our friend
I cry out in the blackened sky
As I watch your beauty die

As I watch you suffer
As I watch you scream
As I watch you falling down
Fading

And I shed a tear
For your long lost soul
For your fading beauty
Never to return

In solitude, I cry alone
In my mortality

I dance the final way
To my unknown destination
A gothic dance with you
In my unreality

What you are is what you are
And what I am means nothing
What you want is what you get
But what you'll get is nothing
Nothing will ever please you now
A simple wish, your beauty
Return sometimes, somehow

I'll take my dreams, my memories
My long-gone hope you'll return
When the winter leaves this love behind
It's time to say goodbye

When the long winterdays
Are drawing near
When the black soil
Turns to white
When sounds of joy and fear
Are silenced by the snow

As I watch you suffer
As I watch you scream
As I watch you falling down
Fading

And I shed a tear
For your long lost soul
For your fading beauty
Never to return?

When love captures me
In its bitter sweet sense
When reality hides away
In its own secret shadow
When the beauty fades to nothing
When the magic in your eyes
Fades away
I say goodbye
As I watch you beauty die

Knowing you loved me
