Once, when the dark veil
Had covered the lands
And it seemed to have frozen time
I stood there in wonder of
What the light had left behind
I wandered through there vast
and untouched lands
Unaware of being trapped
In a dreamlike state of mind

The unspoiled - endless
Beauty - as old as time
It takes - caught me
My breath - unawares
It freezes - my blood
My memory - my body
Puny - mortal
That I am - not worthy

It's like - soundless
Scaring peace - screaming
Subconscious - deafening
Silence - striking
Restrictive - oppressive
Release - of feeling
Overwhelming - unrestrained
Eternity

In the black of the night
It has taken hold of me
When all was lost and far away
I saw into eternity
What I never recognized
Got me to my knees
Can it be the guidance of
Serenity

Unbridled - erupting
Power - adrenaline
It flows - perceptible
Through me - my veins
I can't - ever
Imagine - life
To be without - this feeling of
Serenity

In the black of the night
It has taken hold of me
When all was lost and far away
I sae into eternity
What I never felt before
Is now clear to me
It is the guidance of
Serenity!
