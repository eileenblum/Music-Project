How can a pebble get a pearl to its side
How can a duck court a swan
How can the night have the day to avoid it
How can water join with fire

Days will pass leaving me to drown
In the endless depths of my heart
Can this stubborn man ever let go
Of what he knows he won't have

How can a desert have a rose to bloom
How can a fish walk the lands
How can a dove get to reach the sun
Without burning its wings

Months will pass leaving me to freeze
In the raging cold of my heart
Can this bitten man ever let go
Of what he knows he won't have

Years will pass leaving me to burn
In the passionate fires of my heart
Certain this man will never let go
Of what he knows he won't have

I reach out for the stars above my head
Not noticing the flowers all around me.
