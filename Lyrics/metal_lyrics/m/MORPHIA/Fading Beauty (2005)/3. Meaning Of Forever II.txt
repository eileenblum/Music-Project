The shallow waters
Reflect the pale blue moon
The trees they whisper
On the wind

An autumn breeze
Runs a shiver down my spine
I'm freezing but I
Don't feel like leaving right now

This shore upon the lakeside
Where we first met
Where we kissed
In the light of the moon

An autumn breeze
Runs a shiver down my spine
I'm freezing but I
Don't feel like leaving right now

Here it seems I'm getting closer to you
In the wind I hear your name

And I wish you would be into my life forever
That would really ease this pain

A bank of clouds
Covers the pale blue moon
The surface wrinkles
On the wind

An autumn breeze
Runs a Cold in to my heart
I'm frozen but I
Don't feel like leaving right now

This shore upon the lakeside
Where we last met
Where we danced
In the light of the moon

An autumn breeze
Runs a Cold in to my heart
I'm frozen but I
Don't feel like leaving right now

Here it seems I'm drifting farther from you
As it slowly starts to rain

I wish you would be out of my life forever
That would really ease this pain
And as with rain my tears start falling
I set off for home again
