Come, to my garden
In the mist of broken dreams
And feel...
And feel my burning desire!!
Come
Come with me
Come, with me my love
The shore with its white sand
Your beauty, under my hands
Screaming to the stars above our heads
They're twinkling in her eyes
While She gets wet
Drowning, in sweat and fire
And feel our burning desire

And the moon reflects the sunlight
Over the cold black sea
Like my mind
And there's a warm breeze
Over the wrinkling surface
And over me
And it reminds me of the beautiful night
That we have ha
I'm sad. am I dead or in love
Instead
I cry!!

I scream your name
with loving passion
I scream your name
I cry a tear
Cause you're so dear
I cry a tear

And while time fades away
I still want you
You're still there
deep within my cold black mind
Come...
Come to me!
Come to me my love!!
