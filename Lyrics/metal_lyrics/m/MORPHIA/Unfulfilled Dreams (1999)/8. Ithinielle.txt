Have you ever looked at the stars?
Watched them twinkle?
Brighter than the brightest star
Her eyes were always laughing
Never dying, sparkling, caring
Blue they were, like the vault of heaven

Have you ever looked at the moon?
It's pale beauty?
More beautiful was her skin
Smooth and soft, brighter as the moon
But whiter, warmer, younger
Alluring when caressed by sun

Have you ever seen a pitchblack night?
A moonless night over Illion?
Darker even was her hair, yet brighter
Long, like an arctic night
reflecting the sun like the northern lights
Blinding, while attracting your eyes

Have you ever tried to speak of something
That could not be matched to words
Thousands of words could not describe
One gaze, one glare at her
Ithinielle, queen of thy people
Supreme of thy stars

Ithinielle, queen of thy people
Supreme of thy stars
