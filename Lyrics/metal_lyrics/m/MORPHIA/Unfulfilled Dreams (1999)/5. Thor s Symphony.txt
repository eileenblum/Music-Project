Imagine the wind freshening from
the calm
before the oncoming storm. The trees bow deep
before Thor's presence, while the birds seek
safety in flight.
It rumbles in the distance as the first
raindrops cautiously descend
upon the woodsland soil
The village, with all its shuttered windows
casts a spectral image, reflecting the fear for
Thor
Will he be kindly disposed
this time...?
