Death is all I see
Depressed is how I feel
I feel sad
Is it all in my mind?

Death is all I see
Depressed is how I feel
It's like I find
My spirit separated from my mind

Death, depression, sickness
That's what I feel
Nobody, only emptiness
That's how I feel

But I know, somehow, somewhere
You are near
Someday, sometime I know
You will hear

My cry for life is here
Don't let death interfere
You know I want to live
Please will you forgive me
