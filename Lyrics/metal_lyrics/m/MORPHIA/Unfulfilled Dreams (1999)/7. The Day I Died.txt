As her eyes opened
By touch of the evening light
I just stood there mesmerized
Embraced by twilight

In the falling dusk nature subsides
Into the silence of the night
Her stunning beauty blinds my eyes
She cries

Was it a dream?
Was it reality?
Was it all inside of me?
Who is she?
And who am I?

She ran away into the night
She looked terrified
I never will forget her sight
And still I die, for her
...for her!
