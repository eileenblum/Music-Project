Look at me
My spirit mourns
Here I am

I am dying, an endless death
Endless visions, haunting me
Come and take me by your hands
I reach my hands to you now

Here I am
In despair
Endless tears
I'm crying
Help me to
Believe you
Through my tears
I want to see you

I'm crying
I want to see you
Here I am
I reach my hands to you now

Lord, please, don't let this man
die in his own sorrow
Don't let me pay for the sins
that I've done
I didn't understand your will
So I did mine
And how I reach my hands to you
In despair
Just one question remains
Can you help me??
For here I am
