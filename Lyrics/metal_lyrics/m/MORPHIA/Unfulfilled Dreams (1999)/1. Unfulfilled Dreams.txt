"The need to know beyond
is planted within ourselves"
I whisper in your ear

Unspoken dreams fill
your eyes with gazing shadows
And in this ominous silence
you scream:

Death is frightening me!!

But you must die
but you must die

you must die
for certain
The ending
Unfulfilled dreams

You live in fear
of what will become
of you

your anguish
is unbearable
just a thin fragile hope

There's was a question
so here's the answer!!

For you will die!!

Do you want to stay here or die?
That's only the question left
That is the essence
Do you want to die?

No!!
I don't wanna die!
Nobody wants to die

One las embrace
One last Goodbye
To your dreams
