Left here for dead, hanging on by a thread
No looking back anymore
Out of my mind, didn't know what I'd find
All the signs that I tried to ignore

Betrayed, turned I was stabbed in the back
Betrayed, without warning they sprung and attacked
Repay, I'm not letting anything slide
I won't be a fool anymore

Back in the game, nothing's ever the same
Lessons were learned one more time
No more letting me down, I've been two times around
Opened my eyes to remind me

Betrayed, turned I was stabbed in the back
Betrayed, without warning they sprung and attacked
Repay, I'm not letting anything slide
I won't be a fool anymore
Fool anymore

Left here for dead, hanging on by a thread
No looking back anymore
Out of my mind, didn't know what I'd find
All of the signs that I tried to ignore

Betrayed, turned I was stabbed in the back
Betrayed, without warning they sprung and attacked
Repay, I'm not letting anything slide
I won't be a fool anymore
Betrayed, turned I was stabbed in the back
Betrayed, without warning they sprung and attacked
Repay, I'm not letting anything slide
I won't be a fool anymore
No playing the fool anymore
