Playing with the devil, it's just another day
Living for some trouble, that's my way
I'm afraid of nothing, oh I'm living free
Cheap little thrills, it's the one thing that I need

I'm only feeding on your needs, eat you alive
Inside you're twisted just like me

Dirty double dealings, a nightmare come alive
I'm the poison running through your veins
Look at your reflections, am I your evil twin
Breaking all the rules, now let the games begin

I'm only feeding on your needs, eat you alive
Inside you're twisted just like me

Fuelling your desire, I'm your darkest fear
On our way to Hell
Survival of the fittest, all penalties severe
On our way to Hell

Craving what I'm giving, all the sins we're living
Am I truly evil, take my hand, one day you'll find the way

Fuelling your desire, I'm your darkest fear
On our way to Hell
Survival of the fittest, all penalties severe
On our way to Hell
Fuelling your desire, I'm your darkest fear
On our way to Hell
Survival of the fittest, all penalties severe
On our way to Hell
