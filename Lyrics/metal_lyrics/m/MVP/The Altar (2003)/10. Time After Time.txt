Little child, you're all alone
With no one to hold
All the hope you've held deep inside
Has left you out on the cold

I'll take your tears
And I'll wash all your fears away
I see the light shining down
As the fear and the pain fade away

Time after time after time

Little child, there's nowhere to turn
Is there somewhere to hide
Close your eyes and try to forget
The world has pushed you aside

I'll take your tears
And I'll wash all your fears away
I see the light shining down
As the fear and the pain fade away

Time after time after time
Time after time after time

Time after time after time after time after time after time after time
Time after time after time after time after time after time after time
Time after time after time after time after time after time after time
Time after time after time after time after time after time after time
