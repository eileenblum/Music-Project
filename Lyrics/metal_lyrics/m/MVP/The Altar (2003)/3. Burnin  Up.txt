Oh, it's burnin' inside me
This feeling starting to grow
Well, it seems like forever
Embers of love, they still glow

One by one, it falls into place
Reaching for the dreams that we chase

Burn, burn, burn
Feeling like there's no escape for me
Waiting for the page to turn
Living by the powers to be

As I look in the mirror
A stranger stares back at me
No rhyme and no reason
I can't believe what I see

One by one, it falls into place
Reaching for the love we embrace

Burn, burn, burn
Feeling like there's no escape for me
Waiting for the page to turn
Living by the powers to be

I'm gonna burn, burn, burn
I'm gonna get it out some way
Waiting for the page to turn
I'm gonna get it right someday

Burn, burn, burn
Feeling like there's no escape for me
Waiting for the page to turn
Living by the powers to be

I'm gonna burn, burn, burn
I'm gonna get it out some way
Waiting for the page to turn
I'm gonna get it right someday

Burn, burn, burn
Feeling like there's no escape for me
Waiting for the page to turn
Living by the powers to be

Burn, burn, burn
I'm gonna get it out some way
Waiting for the page to turn
I'm gonna get it right someday
