Opening the doorway of affliction
Opening the gates of Hell
Here I stand, the evil addiction
No return, no parallel

This energy, it's pulling me
Into the dark, over and over again

Proceed, on our way
The possession has started
The altar of evil, it lives
Believe and obey
The altar of evil
Condemning and never forgives

Summoning, disciples of deception
Carry out the one command
Conjuring, the deadliest devotion
We are one, come take my hand

This energy, it's pulling me
Into the dark, over and over again

Proceed, on our way
The possession has started
The altar of evil, it lives
Believe and obey
The altar of evil
Condemning and never forgives

This energy, it's pulling me
Into the dark, over and over again

Proceed, on our way
The possession has started
The altar of evil, it lives
Believe and obey
The altar of evil
Condemning and never forgives
Proceed, on our way
The possession has started
The altar of evil, it lives
Believe and obey
The altar of evil
Condemning and never forgives
