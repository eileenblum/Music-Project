In the darkest nights
I can hear the voices warning me
Fire through the skies
Ignite the flames of Hell, our destiny

Fighting this endless war
Searching to find the door to free our souls
Giving us back all the hope we once held

Forgiving no one's sins
Cries from Hell, in terror, calling me
Lurking in the wind
Shadows of our deadliest enemy

Fighting to end this war
Praying to find one door to free our souls
Giving us all back the hope we once held

Unlock the mystery
Again the night is haunting me
What's left to believe in
One hope is all that's driving me on
Leading me on ,it shows me the way
To not be afraid anymore

Fighting to end this war
Praying to find one door to free our souls
Giving us all back the hope we once held

Unlock the mystery
Again the night is haunting me
What's left to believe in
One hope is all that's driving me on
Leading me on ,it shows me the way
To not be afraid anymore
