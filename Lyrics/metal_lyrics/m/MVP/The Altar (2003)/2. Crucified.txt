Look in my eyes
What do you see lurking inside
No way to disguise
Your fear of me
My hunger for pain satisfied

The torment, it eats you alive
There's no hope in Hell - crucified

Pretending to feel
What's in my heart isn't for real
I see no other way
Believe me
I've no mercy and you are my prey

The torment, it eats you alive
There's no hope in Hell - crucified

The torment, it eats you alive
There's no hope in Hell - crucified
The torment, it eats you alive
There's no hope in Hell - crucified
