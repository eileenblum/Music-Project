Give me a sign, what we're about to undertake
Defending all beliefs
Crossing the line, every limit that we break
The vengeance is released

Moving in, now we move in for the kill
No mercy in our hearts
Ready and counting
The tension mounting in me

Awakening the beast
That lives inside of me
Awakening the beast
Nothing but evil in me

Craving the fear, feel the danger everywhere
Emotion fades away

Sadistic thoughts, devouring minds
Compassion left behind
Ready and counting
The tension mounting in me

Awakening the beast
That lives inside of me
Awakening the beast
Nothing but evil

Awakening the beast
That lives inside of me
Awakening the beast
Nothing but evil in me
Awakening the beast
That lives inside of me
Awakening the beast
And there's nothing but evil, nothing but evil in me
