Another day has come and gone
Nothing is the same
Every night a turning of the page

Watching as the sky rolls by into a new demise
What's going on, it's tearing up our lives

I can't go on thinking everything is alright
If we give in to fear, we're losing sight
Stand up and fight

Waiting for the sun to rise into a new tomorrow
The hope of something better on the way

Haunting memories on my mind
I'm never giving in
Every page that's turned
Are lessons that we've learned

I can't go on thinking everything will be alright
If we give in to fear, we're losing sight
Stand up and fight

I can't go on thinking everything will be alright
If we give in to fear, we're losing sight
I can't go on thinking everything will be alright
If we give in to fear, we're losing sight
Stand up and fight
