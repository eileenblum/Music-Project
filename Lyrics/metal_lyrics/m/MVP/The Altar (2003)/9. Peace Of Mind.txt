Well, I'm running from the law, but I got no place to go
It always seems to be that way for me
I've been dealt a dirty hand, no I'll never understand
I just roll the dice and watch in disbelief

I don't know if I'll ever learn
Only trouble in my way
Danger lurking around every turn
And it's growing every day

I can't say what it is that I've been looking for
Maybe just a little peace of mind
As I fade away from the life that's been enslaving me
Give me just a little peace of mind

Now there's nothing I won't do
Take my word, I'll follow through
Of every little detail I'm aware
Eat 'em up and spit 'em out, to no one I am devout
Good or bad, I don't really care

I don't think that I'll ever learn
Only trouble in my way
Danger lurking around every turn
And it's growing every day

I can't say what it is that I've been looking for
Maybe just a little peace of mind
As I fade away from the life that's been enslaving me
Give me just a little peace of mind

I don't know if I'll ever learn
Only trouble in my way
Danger lurking around every turn
And it's growing every day

I can't say what it is that I've been looking for
Maybe just a little peace of mind
As I fade away from the life that's been enslaving me
Give me just a little peace of mind
I can't say what it is that I've been looking for
Maybe just a little peace of mind
As I fade away from the life that's been enslaving me
Give me just a little peace of min
