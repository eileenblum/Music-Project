I've waited for so many years
There's nothing left except a tear
In silence I've bided, my time will come
As the hammer is falling it blackens the sun

Waging a war on humanity
As I look to the wind, counting the sins in spite of me

Laying down the law
No hope for tomorrow
Don't you see I'm laying down the law
There's no other way

I've tried to hide my face of shame
From out of the darkness, it's started
I must reclaim my will
The voices are calling, they're screaming my name
Put an end to this madness, erasing the pain

Waging a war on humanity
As I look to the wind, the ending begins, begins with me

Laying down the law
No hope for tomorrow
Don't you see I'm laying down the law
There's no other way

Laying down the law
You've ignored all the warnings
Don't you see I'm laying down the law
It must be this way

Laying down the law
No hope for tomorrow
Don't you see I'm laying down the law
There's no other way

Laying down the law
You've ignored all the warnings
Don't you see I'm laying down the law
It must be this way

Laying down the law
No hope for tomorrow
Don't you see I'm laying down the law
There's no other way

Laying down the law
You've ignored all the warnings
Don't you see I'm laying down the law
It must be this way
