Heaven and hell - I remember the old days
Where we started, we walked, where we trusted and talked 

End of all wars - dawn of our green land
Ask yourself... the price? Was it right to survive? 

I take your hand, we'll praise the land of future life
I hear your voice, I made my choice for future life
