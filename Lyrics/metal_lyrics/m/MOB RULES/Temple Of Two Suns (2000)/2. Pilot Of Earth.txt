In the back of his head
You discover his visions of home
In the dark of his mind 
You can see that his dreamscape has grown 

So better take care of his fate
Don't let him go and welcome his show
You better believe in his thinking of hope and search
And call him.. The pilot of earth! 

Hunger grows stronger 
And harvest is down on the ground
Your heart freezes over 
The pilot lets nobody down 

It's better you follow his voice...
"Don't let me go and welcome my show!"
Declare that his outlooks on mankind will come to birth
Just praise him... The pilot of earth! 

You better take care of his fate
Don't let him go and welcome his show
So better believe in his thinking of hope and search 

It's better to trust in his voice:
"Don't let me go and welcome my show!"
Be sure that his visions of mankind 
Are more than the judgement of earth
Just praise him... The pilot of earth and air
