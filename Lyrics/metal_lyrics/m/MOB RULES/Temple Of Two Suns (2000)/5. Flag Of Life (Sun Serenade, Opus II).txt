Running and laughing and dancing around
Enjoying the birds and the fruit on the ground
They're lighting the fire and drinking good wine for their faith 

The nightmare of darkness was yesterday burnt
They opened new chapters and started to learn 
How people can live under pressure and trust in religion 

We took these golden ways
Researched from older days
We held the flag of life 
A brand that all survived 

Wherever the journey will take us at all
We're watching the sky, we'll wait for the call
The pilot of mankind will show us an alley of hope 

We're stronger than ever with future in mind
The power of inside will help human kind
The fire of life is much hotter than fighting the devil 

We ran this holy race
We found a light in space
We held the flag of life
A brand that all survived 

We took these golden ways
Researched from older days
We held the flag of life
A brand that all survived
