Underneath the surface
Beyond the human skin
There's a certain feel of hunger
A scream from deep within 

I never reached the higher grounds
I always failed the time
Just tried to get the inner strength of mine 

Hold on and try to fly
Hold on like wings in the sky
Hold on we tried to fly
So hold on 

All the dreams are over
In the black hole of the sun
The seed of our madness
Took my soul and made me run 

The moment when a child is born
The miracle of life
Is stronger than the shadows of the night 

Hold on and try to fly
Hold on like wings in the sky
Hold on we tried to fly
So hold on
