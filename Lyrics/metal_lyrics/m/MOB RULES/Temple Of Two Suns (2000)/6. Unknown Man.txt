The land of our valley was dried out and dead
So watch out wherever you are 

We give rise to children we feed our brood
So watch out wherever you are 

Whatever you do... 
Leave your life for me - for an unknown land
Give your heart to me - to an unknown man 

Here is your future the land of the free
So scream out whatever you see 

Whatever you feel...
Leave your life for me - for an unknown land
Give your love to me - to an unknown man 

Can you remember what you're looking for
Was it the answer of love?
Can you tell me where you're coming from 
Protect your naked life 

Leave your life for me - for an unknown land
Give your love to me - to an unknown man 

Leave your life for me - I'm your helping hand
Give your love to me - to an unknown man
