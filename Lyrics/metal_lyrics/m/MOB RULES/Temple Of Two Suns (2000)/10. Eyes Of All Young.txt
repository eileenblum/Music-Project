On and on I tried to change the wrong
And find out the way that will bring 'em to good education 

More and more I had to aim and score
To figure it out that my life was an error of ages 

Behind their non-human face
They suffer like any race 

In the eyes of all young
In the heart of the devil's son
We'll find out the one
The way of the devil's son - on the run 

Man will learn and man will return
And reach to the place of a higher civilisation 

On and on you have to change the wrong
And figure it out that their life was an error of ages 

Behind the non-human mask
They will have a concrete task 

In the eyes of all young
In the heart of the devil's son
We'll find out the one
The way of the devil's son - on the run 

Behind their non-human face
They suffer like any race 

In the eyes of all young
In the heart of the devil's son
We'll find out the one
The way of the devil's son - on the run
