I see a new day's dawning
And I hear the keeper's call
I take it as a warning 
And awake them all 

Listen to the church bells 
See the clouds are getting dark
There's lightning up in heaven
When hell will rule your destiny 

Between all the lines
We learn from the stars 

The signs came from outer space
And lit up the sky
It's more than a dream escape
The ground's burning high 

Will I see the wizard
As he rumbles in the air?
Can I feel his heartbeat
As the storm comes near 

His face is full of hatred
And the eyes are burning red 
His voice is shouting anger
Against all sins in history 

Between all the lines
We learn from the stars 

The signs came from outer space
And lit up the sky
It's more than a dream escape
The ground's burning high 

When black rain is falling
And heaven is calling
To judge our faults 

The signs came from outer space
And lit up the sky
It's more than a dream escape
The ground's burning high
