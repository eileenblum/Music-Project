The lessons that they've learned from history
Should help all men to glorify the hallowed name 

Whenever they may reach eternity
They have to realize the rate that they will have to pay 

Find the path for us to go
We're looking for an answer
We're searching for the sense 

When the Lord comes down to earth
Oh evolution's falling - falling 
When the sacred force strikes back
Oh evolution's falling - falling down 

Take care of what you saved from older days
So try to share what grows beside the fertile ways 

Hunger should no longer tease their fate
They have to realize the age of free and glory days 

Find the path for us to go
We're looking for an answer
We're searching for the sense 

When the Lord comes down to earth
Oh evolution's falling - falling 
When the sacred force strikes back
Oh evolution's falling - falling down 

Find the path for us to go
We're looking for an answer
We're searching for the sense 
We're looking for a way to go 

When the Lord comes down to earth
Oh evolution's falling - falling 
When the sacred force strikes back
Oh evolution's falling - falling down
