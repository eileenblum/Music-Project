How many years have gone since we went down?
How many tears you lost on dried out ground? 
You see the sun and watch the rivers flow
Can you remember the fall? 

How many times we tried to change the world?
How many stars we saw in sacred terms? 
So now let's keep an eye upon the unknown land 
And try to follow your call 

There ain't no shadows on eternal land
No poisoned rain is falling down on man 
Watch out... we found the place we have been searching for 
In the valley of a strange land 

At the walls of mighty cries we rush the silence
On a celebration day
In the everlasting glow of frozen fires
We locked the door and burned the cage 

My book of shadows told from final crimes
Under your spell I could not realize 
That I found out that everything was said and done
In the valley of a strange land 

At the walls of mighty cries we rush the silence 
On a celebration day
In the everlasting glow of frozen fires
We locked the door and burned the cage
