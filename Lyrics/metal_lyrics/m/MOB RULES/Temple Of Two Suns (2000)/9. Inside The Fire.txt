Make your decision
Tear out my soul or let me go
You've got my children
You took my life don't want me to go 

What is the reason for that?
Why do you want to end my life
Sit down and listen why 
I wanna save my life 

There's just a thin line
A little path that leads us to life 
As you and your brothers do
I fear the night 

Look to the outside
And start to cry out loud 

Inside the fire
Where the ashes are burning red
Your life's for hire
On the edge of good and bad 

Can you imagine
That we all are brothers in mind
Just give me a reason 
To lead my life 

Look to the inside
And start to shout it out 

Inside the fire
Where the ashes are burning red
Your life's for hire
On the edge of good and bad 

End of daylight
Answers of the outer signs
Start at the morning dew
Green fields - yellow sun
Ashes where the days don't come
Blue moon dark rain to fall 

Inside the fire
Where the ashes are burning red
Your life's for hire
On the edge of good and bad
