The dogs are on the huntThey're searching for the guilty menThe mob is on the runGo fighting for your rights  They hide and seek and change directionSame story as the night beforeThe gallows see a mass attractionA judgment in the devil's court  Don't say you're innocentWe call you a liarYou soiled the promised landThe time to die  There is no second chanceA trial by fireFeel the almighty handLight up the sky  His troops are on the huntTo punish all the unbelieverThe world is under gunsProtect your civil rights!  They try to kill and rape the poor menNobody got a reason whyThe holy smell of witches burningA judgment in the devil's court  Don't say you're innocentWe call you a liarYou soiled the promised landThe time to die  There is no second chanceA trial by fireFeel the almighty handLight up the sky
