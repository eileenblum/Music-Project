I cannot leave it all behindI have to find the reason whyBut no one's there to give an answer  Same old story in a different placeAnother mass without a faceCall them axis of the evil  WarchildYou missed the sunYou failed to run along the last mileHow can we ease your pain?WarchildThe air you breatheThe help you need was on the wrong sideThere ain't no sheltered way  What they've done in '68Has returned in different waysThe alliance of the willing  Did we lose ourselves in time?Did we learn from past day crimes?Is this really what were looking for?  WarchildYou missed the sunYou failed to run along the last mileHow can we ease your pain?WarchildThe air you breatheThe help you need was on the wrong sideThere ain't no sheltered way  This is the place to clean the poisoned groundWe need some time to leave the past  Can you leave it all behind?Do you learn from past day crimes?Is there time to give an answer?  What they've done in '68Has returned in different waysThe alliance of the willing  WarchildYou missed the sunYou failed to run along the last mileHow can we ease your pain?WarchildThe air you breatheThe help you need was on the wrong sideThere ain't no sheltered way
