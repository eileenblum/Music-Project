My head explodes if I don't try to walk on sacred fireMy dreams have told me where the ways to go and find the signs in my mind  I do everything that I knowLight the flame to an uncertain glowI miss everyone in the sunFor a bigger one  My eyes can see a growing industry around the planetMy ears have heard what they will do to earth before I dieWhat a lie  I tried everything that I couldTrust the future as long as I shouldI missed everyone in the sunFor a bigger one  Waiting for the sunWaiting for the sunWaiting for the sunI'm waiting for the sun  I do everything that I knowLight the flame to an uncertain glowAs it burns on the bigger one  Waiting for the sunWaiting for the sunWaiting for the sunI'm waiting for the sun
