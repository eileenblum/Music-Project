[Chapter I - Prologue]

[Instrumental]

[Chapter II - Desperate Son]

I wonder why it's still undone
I wonder why my life went wrong, so wrong
They said I always missed the light
They should not let me out of sight
But in the end nobody cares 

Around the world i was the man
Around a world of silence
I praised the law, did what I can 

Too many questions, too many lies
Too many fakes, too many cries
They said I chose that way to go
They said I'd never failed my role
And in the end somebody cares 

Around the world i was the man
Around a world of silence
I praised the law, did what I can 

Welcome my desperate son
Are you still on the run?
Welcome my lonely one
Did you the reach the sun? 

On judgment day i'll see the shining star
The world so grey, my mind so dreadfully dark
Reached the street and chose my place
Took my arms and played my game
The aim so near, the world so cold â€“ where did I go? 

Welcome my desperate son
Are you still on the run?
Welcome my lonely one
Did you the reach the sun?

[Chapter V - A Dead Man's Face]

On judgment day it all has changes
A hall of bullets flying
Your sweat is cold and caused by pain 

The celebrations reached the peak
You feel your head is aching
The smell of blood is on the street
Pretend your will's been breaking 

Surrender is your fate that comes
Surrender and no way to run 

When bullets hit the sacrosanct
An evil curse is heaven-sent
A curtain on the dead man's face
Is hiding what they put to graves 

Depression thrills the sacred land
When war and pain was heaven-sent
A curtain on the dead man's face
Is hiding what they put to graves 

And if your bullets fail their aim
You'll find another seeker
A different reason affects the same
Your intentions were much weaker 

Surrender is your fate that comes
Surrender and no way to run 

When bullets hit the sacrosanct
An evil curse is heaven-sent
A curtain on the dead man's face
Is hiding what they put to graves 

Depression thrills the sacred land
When war and pain was heaven-sent
A curtain on the dead man's face
Is hiding what they put to graves

[Chapter VI - Did You Reach The Sun?]

I wonder why it's till undone
I wonder why my life went wrong
Around the world I was the man
Around a world of silence
I praised the law, did what I can 

On judgment day I saw a shining star
The world so grey, my mind so dreasfully dark
I put my finger on a prayer's page
Woke up and slightly lost my inner rage
Left the street and chose my way
Took no arms and played no game
The sky so near the world so light
Where was my fright?
