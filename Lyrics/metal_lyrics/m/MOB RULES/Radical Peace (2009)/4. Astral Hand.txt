Running on a book of secret pagesNever thought to be a foolish child againHeading for the little pride of agesHide and fight and cries out words of pain  Don't you know what he was looking for?I wonder why they praise the rules of war  I am a finger of the astral handYour prayers let my harvest growI got your spirit astral manTo reign the land of ice and snow  Brothers coming homeRiding horsesSisters sweep along and fight the tales of whoreHold a little whileGet some silverTake me by the hand with rust and gold  Don't you know what he was searching for?I wonder why they praise the rules of war  I am a finger of the astral handYour prayers let my harvest growI got your spirit astral manTo reign the land of ice and snow  Don't you know what he was looking for?I wonder why they praise the rules of war  I am a finger of the astral handYour prayers let my harvest growI got your spirit astral manTo reign the land of ice and snow
