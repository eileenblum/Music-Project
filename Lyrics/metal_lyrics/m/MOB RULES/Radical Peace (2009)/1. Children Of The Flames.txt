Once more I'll be tryingTo explane the whole sceneryOnce more I'll be dyingBy the rules of my destiny  Treated like rats in the gutterAnd caught in a camp full of hateThe justice of life did not matterThe medical growth was our fate  See the fear in our facesHear the pain in our cries  I am a saint I amI ain't no sin againI am a saint I amIn the name of scienceChildren of the flames  We're born under signs of a wrong starAnd forced on a trail straight to hellWe're punished by laws of injusticeIt's more than a lifetime could tell  Smell the filth in our cagesWe are the victims of a lie  The called us the children of fireWe're killed by the angel of deathThe devil in black was a liarAnd the chambers of gas my last breath  See the fear in our facesHear the pain in our cries  I am a saint I amI ain't no sin againI am a saint I amIn the name of scienceChildren of the flames  Once more I've been tryingTo explane the whole sceneryOnce more I was dyingBy the rules of my destiny
