Remember the shadow race
Injustice and crime look over
Consider the mortal pace
That the evil brings

For money and heavens call
They're running through times and ages
Velocity came to law and leads to

Spped of life - the rush of time
Is part of the demon
Speed of life - the rush of time
The speed of life is devil's exercise

They're running the wicked race
They're playing with raging fire
No time for to rest and stay
That's what the master says

Hold on in a world of shame
Stay true to law and order
There's nothing that I can you blame
For the

Speed of life - the rush of time
Is part of the demon
Speed of life - the rush of time
The speed of life is devil's exercise

Escape from the rising sun
A light from the far horizon
Your choice is to hit and run to

Speed of life - the rush of time
Is part of the demon
Speed of life - the rush of time
Cause everything's part of the

Speed of life...
