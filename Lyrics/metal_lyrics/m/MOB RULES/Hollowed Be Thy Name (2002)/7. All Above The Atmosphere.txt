[feat. Roland Grapow]

Time - 
Do you imagine our time
Do you find out what's always
Here in sight always there in light

Space -
Do you determine holes in space
The little black ones that you
Never see but always will be
Always will be in light

All above the atmosphere
Is reaching the sun
Take the flight without no fear
Get pleasure from light

Signs -
Can you discover holy signs
A little red one which is
Always here always in your mind

Place -
We all are searching for our place
The little quiet one
Where we rest our soul
Find our home
Leave our clothes to stay

All above the atmosphere
Is reaching the sun
Take the flight without no fear
Get pleasure from light

All above the atmosphere
Is reaching the sun
Take the flight without no fear
Get pleasure from light
