Lord of the lamp will you offer your hand
Will you promise to light me the way?
I followed the stars
And I searched for the right pass to go

Child of the sun
Can you now understand
What the prophets might tell you one day?
The trail to the light is becoming the guide
Of your daydreams, your life scenes

We are believers and we'll run the game
To bring out the sun
And the moon and the stars on their way

Lord of Madness turns out pain
Who's to blame?
He goes nowhere out there
Lord of Madness cries out bitter tears
But nobody hears

Keeper of earth
Have you already heard
That your sadness is part of your days
Old King of the hill
Is there somebody still in your dark cave
Cold grave

We are believers and we'll run the game
To bring out the sun
And the moon and the stars on their way

Lord of Madness turns out pain
Who's to blame?
He goes nowhere out there
Lord of Madness cries out bitter tears
But nobody hears
