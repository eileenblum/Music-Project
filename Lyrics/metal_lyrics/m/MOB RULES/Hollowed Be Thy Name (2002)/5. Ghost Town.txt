Out of my head things are going mad
So we cannot return into life
Out of my mind all eyes are still blind
And the only impression is pale

We cannot realise the aim
Just did identify that

There's no one in ghost town
Nobody switched the light on
A black hole in ghost town
Just dark and cold rooms for to pray

Inside your bed the rats are still there
And the poison corroded the frame
Inside your mouth your tongue starts to shout
And it swallows the uncertain name

We do not realise the aim
No one did recognise that

There's no one in ghost town
Nobody switched the light on
A black hole in ghost town
Just dark and cold rooms for to pray

We cannot realise the aim
Just did identify that

There's no one in ghost town
Nobody switched the light on
A black hole in ghost town
Just dark and cold rooms for to pray
A black hole in ghost town
Just dark and cold rooms for to stay
