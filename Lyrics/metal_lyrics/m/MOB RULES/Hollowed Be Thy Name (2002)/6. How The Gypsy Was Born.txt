[feat. Peavy Wagner]And God saw that this work was nearly done
A blue mighty planet circled round the sun

And God saw that this work was nearly done
A blue mighty planet circled round the sun

And God saw that everything was nice
But there had to be a creature
who looked like me and you
So he realised

So he took some earth and put it in a form
But the oven wasn't hot enough
so the white man was born

You can live in the cold zone of the world
'Cause you are used to it, since your birth

I have to build another creature who looks like me and you
But one who's not so pale
He has to get a hotter blow

So he took some earth and put it in a form
But the oven was too hot now
so the black man was born

You can live in the hot zone of the world
'Cause you are used to it, since your birth

I have to build another creature who looks like me and you
But one who's not so dark
He has to get a special blow

So he took some earth and put it in a form
And the oven was right now
So the gipsy was born!

Go to the top of the mountain and look
Do you see this land around?
Go where you like to be
'Cause you and the gipsy will be free...
