So here I am asked myself once again...
Who gives the air that I am breathing?

Never took the easiest way
Never chose the easiest day
Couldn't find a cause to blame

Always got the cash to pay
Always found the games to play
Sometimes had a beast to tame

Why don't you hear my voice?
Did you accept my choice?
Your hope of life dried out
When I realised my aim...

Hollowed be thy name

Had enough of confidence
Held the name of innocence
I ruled the land of pain

My law was insecure
My punishment for sure
Who played the masters game?

I could not hear your voice?
Never accept your choice
Your chance of life dried out
When I justify my aim...

Hollowed be thy name

Cold were the days
Lost in your memory
Cold was reality

Cold were the days
After our souls had to realise two games

Hollowed be thy name
