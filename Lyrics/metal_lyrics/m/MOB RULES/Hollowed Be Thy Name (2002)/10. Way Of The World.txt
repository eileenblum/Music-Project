[feat. Roland Grapow]

You got the key to unknown land
And tried to keep your helping hand
We found the complete way to go
Your spirit patched up broken wings
Your patience healed our wounded skins
You took your time to rescue life

Left things go right and black turns to white
We lived as we borrowed the time
Fire and ice and water was turned into wine

As a child born in green land turns the earth back to life
Has to find out the way of the world

People come and people go sun goes down behind black smoke
Must have been a place to stay
Your memory shows all they earned
Some lessons that they had to learn
Knowledge of the unknown man

Wrong things were right and black turned to white
We lived as we borrowed the time
Fire and ice and water was turned into wine

As a child born...

On judgement day we reach eternity, it ever lasts to my memories
Take my hand and trust your eyes, give your heart forget the lies

As a child born...

The miracle of life has come the answers of the past were done
I realised the pain of Savage Land
I saw that just the best survived saw them save their naked life
No one forgot Insurgeria

Wrong things were right and black turned to white
We lived as we borrowed the time
Fire and ice and water was turned into wine
