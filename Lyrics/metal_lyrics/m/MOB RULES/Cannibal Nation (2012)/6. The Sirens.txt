Red leaves are falling
Cold passion all around
A voice is calling
Another perfect sound?

If youÂ´re on the edge of life
Wish to hear the goddess rhyme from sympathy going to mystery

The sirens will never be heaven sent again
Somebody is in sirens hand
DonÂ´t trust them their justice is built on sand
Cause sirens always lie

The earth starts shaking
And the world is breaking down
The sirenÂ´s calling
Your feet still touch the ground

If you wish the test of time
Wanna trust the goddess rhyme from sympathy going to mystery

The sirens are never from heaven sent
Cause somebody is still in the sirens hand
DonÂ´t trust them their justice is built on sand
Cause sirens always lie

[Chorus]
