Channel I has love and passion
Channel II sells sex and crime
Soaps and games and fools in heaven
Wash your brain and steal your time

Make a call and win some money
Shake your legs and squeeze your voice
Have a jack or milk with honey
You have the choice

All in all the time is right to cry and turn all the lies
All in all on a day to break the rules
The tele box fool

Channel III they praise the reckless
Channel IV they freeze in hell
Tunes or words so dumb and senseless
Dreams today have souls to sell

Give a call and take new credits
HereÂ´s your drink â wanna by some shirt?
The more you want the less youÂ´ll get it
It`s all mud and dirt

[Chorus]
