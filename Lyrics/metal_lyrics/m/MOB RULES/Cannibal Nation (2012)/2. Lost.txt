So strong â so wrong
So dark and cold inside

You cried but I will try
The day when all seems lost and gone

ItÂ´s a world of sad temptation
A world of burning emptiness

My head â is so dead
I feel like someone washed my brain
The day we should have met
the change we never had
the day I felt that youÂ´ve been gone
ItÂ´s a world of sad temptation
And a world thatÂ´s cold inside

Lost in silence â found my words on the run
Cause I am lost in silence
put my life into the hands of fate

so strong â so wrong
so dark and cold inside

the words we never read, the truth we never said
the day when all is lost and gone

itÂ´s a world of sad temptation
and a world thatÂ´s cold inside

[Chorus]
