I saw the revolution coming
I watched the people on the street
Remember all the days of fighting
Until the institution bleeds

CanÂ´t stand the hopeless way to freedom
The sense of life they let us know
Another try for better seasons
Remaining lies to let us go

Please welcome the show!

Behind the wall of a cannibal nation
Inside a head where the passion remains
Dream your dream of a civilization
Without fear of pain

Where did they hide the law of justice?
Why did they scream: stand by your guns?
Could you find out where all the dust is?
Hope and pride of a seventh son

Please welcome the show!

Behind the wall of a cannibal nation
Inside a head where the passions remains
Dream your dream of a civilization
The cannibal nation has gone
Freedom is coming along
The cannibal nation has gone

Behind the wall of a cannibal nation
Inside a head where the passions remains
Dream your dream of a civilization
Where all our souls are meant to be free
