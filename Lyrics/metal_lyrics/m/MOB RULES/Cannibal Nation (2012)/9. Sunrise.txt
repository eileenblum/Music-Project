Falling â no life on earth
Feel the breeze of change and the twist of birth

Fading â see me drifting all around
Like the morning dew has kissed the ground

See a world that turned to grey
And keep the book of silence
Leave the past and burn the page
To cool the open flame

Save me â when my desperation comes
And all hope and glory start a game of hit and run

Watch out â there is a shadow on the wall
When the sun goes down you can hear the final call

See my world has turned to grey
And read my book of silence
Leave the past and burn the page
To cool the open flame

CanÂ´t you see the truth behind
The race I never started
The more IÂ´ll get the more IÂ´ll shine
I`m hot like open flames

Sunrise things come clear
ItÂ´s the light that shines for a soul in the haze
Sunrise expose the secrets
Like a burning flame that heaven has made
