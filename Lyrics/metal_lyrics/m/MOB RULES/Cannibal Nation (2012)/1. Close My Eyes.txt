I walked the path for a million times
And got my water from the well
Into the magic of the morning sun
My sleeping fire starts to burn

Should I glow for a better day?
Just twists and turns in the dark?
Or should I go on another way?
To feel the blood in my veins

I close my eyes again â cause I changed my life
To realize no need for a bitter end

When all my troubles seem so far away
And all my pain has come to sense
A searching soul inside a faithless world
A fool to cry rules the land

Should I scream in a poisoned haze?
With fear and hate in the dark
Or did I stumble into another day?
To scratch the blood in my hands

I close my eyes again â cause I changed my life
i close my eyes again â cause I changed my life
To realize no need for a bitter end
