My life has been lost in shadows
My thoughts have gone up in smoke
The days that weÂ´ve spent out on meadows
Increased all my fear and hopes

CanÂ´t have for fame and glory
Just keep what I rarely get
Before I will tell my whole story
I bless all the friends I have had
Fight for the things that youÂ´ll never forget in your life

Walking on ice and fire
And creeping on poisoned grounds
Still longing for same desires
Feel that IÂ´m still around
In touch to what I really was

Dreams were going so wrong now
I feel my breathing has slowed down
Running in circles and losing my path
Running around with a mask

Remember my poor desperation
The time I was down in dirt
I saw that a godless creation
Can do things that really hurt

Fight for the things that youÂ´ll never forget in your life

[Chorus]

Run before they can come
ItÂ´s better to hide and leave
all your dreams behind
Cause man is cruel, is a beast
is fighting the truth
Commits the most vicious crimes
Life is so hard when you find out
The beast in the average men

So run before theyÂ´ve begun before
They can rape and turn out the beast in you
And go on the top of a hill find out
That you see your fate is your life in truth

Fight for the things that youÂ´ll never forget in your life

[Chorus]
