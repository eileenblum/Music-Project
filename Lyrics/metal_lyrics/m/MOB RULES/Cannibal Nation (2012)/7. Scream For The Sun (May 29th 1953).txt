Ed spoke to god on top of the world
Fighting with mountain extremes
CouldnÂ´t reach the peak until the very last day
Struggling different scenes

Ed touched the sun in the mid of a day
Feeling the grace of god
ItÂ´s mother nature that has shown him the way
A path to wash the sins away

Snow romance at a place that man never saw
Snow and cold on the way to go
Ice and frost cut the light

LetÂ´s speak to god on top oft he world
Fighting with mountain extremes
Should reach the summit on the very last day
Struggling different scenes

Ed took the chance for the final assault
A sherpa with him side by side
He passed the point of a turning around
Just longing for the goal

Snow romance at a place that man never saw
Snow and cold on the way to go
Ice and frost cut the light

Snow romance at a place that man never saw after dark
Snow and cold on the way to go
Ice and frost cut the light

Scream for the sun
Scream for the sun
Scream for the sun
Scream for the sun
