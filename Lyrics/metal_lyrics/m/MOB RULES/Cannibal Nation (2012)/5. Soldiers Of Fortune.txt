Because of the open fire
See when the tin soldier is falling
Giving up ideas of your peace desire
Feels like youÂ´re losing control

It needs a cry when they force you to kill a child
And tell you instructions to murder
It needs no try to feel when you shoot to strangers
The fear when the army is calling

Take my advice and run for your life

Run before the war has begun
Before the freedom is gone
And trust your way as soldiers of fortune
Come and shelter me from the flames
From places poison remains
Before they call you soldiers of war

In the heat of a furious warfare battle
The freeze as a soldier of passion
There is no need to regret if your mindÂ´s mistrusting
Run and fight for your freedom

Take my advice and run for you life

[Chorus]

See the thin soldiers lose their fortune
And blood that drops into ashes
In the heat of a furious warfare battle
If feels like youÂ´re losing control

Take my advice run for your life

[Chorus]
