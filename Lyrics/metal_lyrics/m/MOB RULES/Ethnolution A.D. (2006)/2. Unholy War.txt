The road's getting longer
Abandon is down on the ground
Your force should be stronger
The fighting is still going on

You'd better believe what they say
You'd better watch out when they're starting to play
The more you must search for their name
The less you find the law of

Unholy war
Believe what they say
Unholy war

The wind's getting colder
The culture has just fallen down
Beware of the older
Their plan is to leave us unknown

You'd better find out what they play
You'd better be deaf when they're calling your name
The less they're returning to the game
The more you see the raw of

You'd better believe what they say
You'd better be deaf when they're calling your name
The less they are changing the game
The more you miss the law of

Unholy war
Believe what they say
Unholy war

You better believe what they say
