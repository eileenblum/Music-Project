Take whatever you see
Whatever you like and what you need
Life has opened the doors
Has shown you the way you're meant to go

Fate has given the space
Has driven the day for all your hopes
So live the life that you chose
The dreams that will grow inside your soul

Lost for a day and a lifetime
You reached out
For the wrong world
Leaving your way
For the wild side
Remember the days behind

Save yourself as a child beware
Of the wild that's in your heart
Take care what life is about
You're screaming and shouting out so loud

Lost for a day and a lifetime
You reached out
For the wrong world
Leaving your way
For the wild side
Remember the days behind
