I left my inside tried to give all I can
I see my spirit hanging low
I joined the outside my own fate in my hands
The beast in me is much too slow

When I first met you I just tried not to lie
You give your love to the wrong man
The things I told you were more than I cry
To let you understand my world

Ain't the one that you see
So unreal in me
Ain't the one to believe
I long for space to feel free

What I can tell you is less than you want
Can't say that everything's all right
We'll reach the sky, will return down to earth
Can't let you come into my world

Ain't the one that you see
So unreal in me
Ain't the one to believe
I long for space to feel free

I'm not the one that you are looking for
I can't fulfil the things you're longing for

Ain't the one that you see
So unreal in me
Ain't the one to believe
I long for space to feel free
