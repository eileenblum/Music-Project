I left my body the other day
And reached my inner feel
Dreams and hopes for a better way
In space where faith is real

I find the answers behind the moon
Light years from my birth
I'm sure my love will follow soon
Will leave her place on earth

I jumped off the wall
And stared at the sun

It's time
For a new horizon
My spirit is spread in the air
The place where
My dreams are rising
Is worth to be handled with care

Lost in space we see the light
And let out spirit free
Warm the days and cold the night
It's good to stay with me

I jumped off the wall
And stared at the sun
I'm leaving the hall
And started...

Because of
A new horizon
Your spirit is spread in the air
The place where
Your dreams are rising
Is worth to be handled with care
