Remember when the troops has come
They called them jerks and made them run
And tell them: home and faith are lies

The world in peace the heights at war
They name the judge a lying whore
And lost their right and will to survive

One trip was booked
By the immigrant hell

They call it the last forever

One trip was sold
As a ticket to fight

They praise the lord but kill his child
The speak of death has born the wild
Just see them fail the game of life

One trip was booked
By the immigrant hell

They call it the last forever

One trip was sold
As a ticket to fight

One trip was booked
By the immigrant hell

They call it the last forever

One trip was sold
As a ticket to fight
