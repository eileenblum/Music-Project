When the moon is on the rise
And rivers cross the tide
When black is on the run
Then judgement comes

When smoke is going down
And the earth is tumbling round
See your king is on his knees
He's your enemy

When the devil comes to pray
And hangmen what to stay
Watch the fire's burning high
It's time to die

There's no return
No way to stop them kill and let them burn?

And when the nails have come to rust
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust

When jury comes to town
And our saviour lost his crown
Like beggars in the night
He will lose his life

And when the nails have come to rust
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust

After all is said and done
And you feel lost and numb
With the king is on his knees
What a glory peace

When the devil comes to pray
And the hangmen wants to stay
Watch the fire's burning high
It's time to die

White men have judged about their life
White men have failed the signs
Of hope and peaceful times

White robes have written history
White robes refuse to see
