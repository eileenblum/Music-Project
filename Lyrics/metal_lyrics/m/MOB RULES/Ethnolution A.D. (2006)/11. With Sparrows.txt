Could it be part of human history
That the air you breathe's also meant to let you sail?

Take out your shoes have the courage to let go
And the wings you're on set you free

The mystery of life lets you go and find your way
With the birds at the sky and the clouds that let you dream

If there's no heaven you can fly right now to the moon

When night will turn to day
And the trees give shadows
It's changing black to grey
Try to sail with sparrows

When night will turn to day
And the trees give shadows
You're turning black to grey
Have a sail qith sparrows

Could it be that the clouds will let you sleep?
Spread your arms and try just to reach the upper space

Birds at the sky and the clouds that let you dream
Let the wings you're on lift you up and set you free
