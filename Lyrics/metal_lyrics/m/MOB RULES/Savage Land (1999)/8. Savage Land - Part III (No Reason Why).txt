I see ruins burning everywhere
Creeping soldiers but they don't care
Oh the war drags on 

Bombs and fighters and armoured tanks
Desert soldiers with bloody hands
Oh the fighting drags on 

Can you see the injustice of war
Can you see the bad side of law
Oh lord can you show me the truth 

After the fire - who really has won?
Millions of victims, generations are gone
Have died in fights - at night 

Way in way out - burn liberty down
Way in way out - burn liberty down
Way in way out - don't take liberty down 

When the countries fight over oil
When politicians earn money through war
All fights end before the year has passed 

But when nobody sees the dollar notes rain
They talk and wait and let the fighting remain
Again, again, again and again 

Way in way out - burn liberty down
Way in way out - burn liberty down
Way in way out - don't take liberty down 

Victims of the bloodshed
Fire in the sky
Holy war... the answer
I see no reason why
Pictures of the wounded
Screaming in my head
No more - no war - see no reason why
