Wipe your tears away
Keep your eyes on nature
Here and now - today
Heaven's path will take you 

Don't trust in spoken words
Discover your own sense
They try to put you down
And things become undone 

Blaze of first warning
Trust just yourself
Blaze of first warning
You once had some friends who did you wrong 

Don't take a ride to hell
And trust the signs of fire
They show the way one day
But sell your god for hire 

Don't trust in spoken words
Don't believe their promises
They try to put you down
When things come into sight 

Blaze of first warning
Trust just yourself
Blaze of first warning
You once had some friends who sold their lives
