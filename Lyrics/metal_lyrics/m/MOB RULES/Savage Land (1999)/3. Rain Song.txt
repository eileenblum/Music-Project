Strange desire burning in my head
Taste of future, keep it secret till you're dead
Endless sorrow, tell the tales of time
Think of the future don't regret the unknown sign 

That's over when the cold wind blows
Right there where the almighty power grows 

When the war is over now
Then they all stand up
And rain comes down
Holy smoke and water falls
And signs of future life 

Same old story - same old fate
Script of mankind is the script of war and hate
After darkness when the sun returns
Think of the future, don't regret and try to learn 

That's over when the cold wind blows
Right there where the almighty power grows 

When the war is over now
Then they all stand up
And rain comes down
Holy smoke and water falls
And signs of future life
