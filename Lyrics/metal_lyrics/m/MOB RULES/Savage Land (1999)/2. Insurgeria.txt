After mankind threw itself into filth and ashes
And all life on earth went down
Mighty storms and rain and thunderbolt that crashes
Washed away all sins around 

Just the good survived
Saved their naked life from darkness
No one bad survived
Swept away - Insurgeria 

When the caravan resumed their trip to green land
They expected the fight to go on
They had to pass a lot of life's examinations
Before they reached the land of the free 

Just the best survived
Saved their naked life from darkness
No one weak survived
To forget Insurgeria 

All the people, men and women, forty children
Stood together side by side
They came to learn the rules of hope and independence
And taught each child how to survive 

Did not all survive
Saved just most of life from darkness
The last born survived
And forgot Insurgeria
