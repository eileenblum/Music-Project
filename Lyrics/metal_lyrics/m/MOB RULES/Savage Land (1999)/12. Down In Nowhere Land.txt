Searching for a foreign land
Way down where the golden days survived
Solution for a world of pain
Where freedom and glory days shine bright 

Lean back and trust your own mind
Lean back and close your eyes
Reach out for the souls of mankind 
Lean back and search for life 

Remember what the wise man told you
Follow the light of the guiding star
Imagine that your faith will rise 
And freedom will conquer border lines 

Lean back and trust your own mind
Lean back and close your eyes
Reach out for the souls of mankind 
Lean back and search for life
In Nowhere Land 

Praying from a golden chair
Stand up for the march to Nowhere Land
Remember what the wise man told you
And follow the light of the guiding star 

Lean back and trust your own mind
Lean back and close your eyes
Reach out for the souls of mankind 
Lean back and search for life
