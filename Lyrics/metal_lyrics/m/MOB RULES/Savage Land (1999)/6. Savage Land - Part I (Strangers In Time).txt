World on the edge - down on the line
The state of nature is dire 
It all came down in 2069
They fight the fight - to survive 

We are the humans
We are the humans 

Sun goes down and gives way to night
Of dust, of hunger and crime
Snakers here, the good and peaceful there
Oil has ruined all life 

We are the humans
We are the humans 

What I have seen
I could not believe
We'll live like strangers in time 

The dreamer's dream
The fight to survive
The sight of strange future life
