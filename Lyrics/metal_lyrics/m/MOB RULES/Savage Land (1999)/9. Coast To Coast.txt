Remember when the days were gone
The moon went down the heat was on
And all the gods came down to savage land 

They taught their children... have no fear
They spread their wings and disappeared
Now you can see them rule in space 

Those were the days when faith was right in time
Those were the years when people stood so close to god 

And when the gods created men
They took grey earth from desert land
And used the dust from dried out salt lakes 

They hoped to realize their aim
Of men and wife and beasts to tame
But found a beast in everything they made 

Those were the days when faith was right in time
Those were the years when people stood so close to god 

Coast to coast
Where water flows into neptune's sacred ground
Coast to coast
Remember that the ocean's fate will count 

And when the lord's attempt took twice
The gipsy's skin was in their mind
A beauty queen - a free born child of life 

He sent the queen to nomad's land
For her to live on holy sand
And realized that all was fine 

Those were the days when faith was right in time
Those were the years when people stood so close to god 

Coast to coast
Where water flows into neptune's sacred ground
Coast to coast
Remember that the ocean's fate will count
