Welcome to see my ability
I promised to follow the light
Remember the way to infinity
Hear my voice and cry 

And make your choice
We're reaching the promised land
And make your choice 
The trip under shining stars 

Secret signs
On borderlines
Signs of danger left behind 

Where ever the journey will take us all
Be sure that our nature will reign
Beware of the danger beside the path
Hear my guiding voice 

And make your choice
Arrive in the unknown land
And make your choice
The home under shining stars 

Secret signs
On borderlines
Signs of danger left behind 

Have no fear - abyss was near 
Light was here - the signs from darkness
