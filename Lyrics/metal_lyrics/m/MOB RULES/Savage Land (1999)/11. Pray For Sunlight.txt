End of darkness, follow rivers down beside through war and pain
Refreshing water, where the people clean their souls from poisoned rain
Can see the light through darkness
Can hear the wind, the voice, the human race and all 

Got a sign from outer space
From afar, out of silence 

Pray for sunlight
Rainy clouds above
Pray for sunlight 
That heaven gives enough 

Found green meadows, took some flowers growing in the sacred sand
Smelled the freedom, breathed the air from eastern liberated land
Survived the land of sorrow
And saw the door that opened up the way to go 

Were there signs from outer space?
On their journey out of silence 

The path that mankind took away from nowhere
Was cold and long and hard to reach the sky
The people took their faith and followed sunlight
And found their home of independent life 

They built their house on green land
They earned their harvest year by year
And taught each little child
You should rather fight than leave your own homeground
