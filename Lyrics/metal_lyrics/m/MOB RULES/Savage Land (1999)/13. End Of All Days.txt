Welcome to green fields of glory
Where people don't suffer from pain.
Slaves under blood and tormented by cruel tyranny 

The march into permanent freedom
Successful but hard for mankind
The future is bright and the tunnels first light means solution 

Until the end of all days
Trust in the human race
No one but us can reculture the rust
The end of old dreams is the start of new hope and new life 

Heaven and hell in one plane
The future beyond astral skies
No one can tell them to leave their new homeground again 

Welcome to green fields of glory 
Remember the lies of the past
Slaves under blood and tormented in insurgeria 

Until the end of all days
Trust in the whole human race
No one but us can reculture the rust
The end of old dreams is the start of new hope and new trust 

Did you ever think what the future of your life holds in store
Do you have a heart for the people side by side under oppression 

Until the end of all days
Believe in the whole human race
No one but us can reculture the rust
The end of old dreams is the start of new hope and new trust
