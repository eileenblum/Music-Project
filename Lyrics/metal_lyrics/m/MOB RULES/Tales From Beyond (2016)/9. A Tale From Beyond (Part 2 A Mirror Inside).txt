There's a mirror in us all, holds your inside
Are you scared of what you see? Stand your reflection?

[Refrain]
I never felt so alone, my distracted mind
Whenever I dream, I fly, fly away from all this pain
I never felt so alone, home is out of sight
Whenever I dream, I fly, don't fear my mirror's truth

There lies a chance in all of us, there is reason
Once life challenges your trust, will you give up?

[Refrain]
