Whenever I walk a dark road, anger still walks by my side
Something is pushing me forward, reigning from inside of me
For the lust, to be free

Sometimes I feel like I'm dying, hatred is my only friend
In constant fear I am living, at last I am going insane
Scared to death! The end?

[Bridge]
In my mind the visions come alive to threaten me again
Leading me to finish all the cruel things they showed me

[Refrain]
Slave to the fire, servant of the smoke
For every sin you think of, one will be reborn
Your dark desire will be torn apart
By the dust of vengeance with an evil heart

My dreams and visions of madness, by weakness imprisoned inside
Dressed in the coat of morality, enchained by my inner fright
Never lived, never free

[Bridge]

[Refrain]

[Bridge]
Creatures in my mind, they come alive to threaten me again
Devils made of smoke will always be a part of me

[Refrain]
