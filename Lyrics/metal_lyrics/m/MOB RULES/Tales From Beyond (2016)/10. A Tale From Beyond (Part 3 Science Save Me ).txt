Now it is time, to leave all concerns behind
This will be my first step, of a million more yet to come
All I need is my mind, recall all I've ever learned,
Knowledge will be my guide, the worst is yet to come
Science will save my soul!

[Refrain]
Following my dreams I reached my outer space
I'm yearning to be home again
Searching for the key to leave it all behind
Save me from this planet!

Communicate, tell the world that I'm still alive
Will you receive my call, a million miles away?
Return just for me, care about a single soul
Lost in a foreign world, there are millions of souls alive
Science will save me!

[Refrain]

[Ending]
Day after day, I will find my way
To return where I came from

Day, after day, will you guide my way
To return where I belong
