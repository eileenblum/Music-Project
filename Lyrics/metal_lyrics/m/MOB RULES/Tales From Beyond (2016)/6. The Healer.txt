Find myself in times of twists and turns
Lost my place of inside rest
I light a flame which did not really burn
Feed my soul with emptiness

[Bridge]
I'm watching the things go wrong
I'm losing my faith
Mistrusting the signs around

[Refrain]
Healer â (has) the right to perceive
I'm in need of a healer cause my pain will go on

Can you tell me how to ease my pain?
Will I find a home to stay?
I fear the sun and search for cooling rain
Should I cry or should I pray

[Bridge]
I'm watching the signs are wrong
And losing my faith
Mistrusting my friends around

[Refrain]
