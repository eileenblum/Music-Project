Thunder rolls â the piper plays for the son
He plays for his fate, for peace and a golden age
Remember when the king was young, a sword and a gun
To fight for the glory days
Man will die â and man should be out of sight, cause none overrun
the law of his gun

Oh oh oh oh oh

[Refrain]
For Holy Grail and a sole celebration: My kingdom come!
The burning flame of a new generation, fire of the sun
Your sweat and tears are the pure medications: My kingdom comes!
A burning flame that is cool inside

The sky will fall â the earth has been turned to grey
On judgment day when all will be gone
The king was here, his sword was the end of fear
A stone in his hand â and peace for my land

Oh oh oh oh oh

[Refrain]
