[Intro]
Standing alone when the darkness fills my home
And the rains washed all hope from my soul again

They run in the heat of the sun, coming out of the blue
I see them walking and longing for a story of truth
The army of fire, a searching desire
They'd better should follow golden rules

[Bridge]
There's a mirror on the wall reflecting every light
There are writings on the floor, the shadows from behind?

[Refrain]

When the ocean burns, a fire flows, an era is coming to an end
When the wind's will grows, the earth is blown, the scars will heal
but never mend
When the signs appear

They fall in the dust of the heat, redemption they need
Can't take the suffer from leaving all memories behind
The unwritten law and idols have fallen
They better should use the helping hands

[Bridge]
See the mirror on the wall reflecting secret signs
See the writings on the floor, a shadow from behind?

[Refrain]

[Ending]
There's a mirror on the wall reflecting every light
There are writings on the floor, the shadows from behind?

See the writings on the wall a shadow from behind?
See the mirror on the floor, like a cross in a morning light
