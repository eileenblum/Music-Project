Stranded, on the read soil of a cold world
(I'm) cast away on Planet Mars
Sealed my fate in endless vastness
Will there be a way back home?
Way back home...

Think twice? Do you want to be the pioneer
or the explorer of a new world
That won't give you any shelter
If a heavy storm breaks loose

[Refrain]
Maybe you, feel the truth, are you safe at last?
Surely I understand, there wasn't any way
Through the eye of the storm, as I disappeared
Am I dead or alive, get out of this hell

Stretchered, on the cold soil of a dead world,
Hit and stabbed and blown away,
Set out into the great nothing
Left for dead and left alone

[Refrain]

[Interlude]
It's my fate to stay alive!

[Refrain]
