Is it right to ally with your rival?
IS your freedom worth the price to pay?
As the Red Hand died, it all led to war
Viking blood in my veins drives me further,
Scottish pride leads the way to be free
Will the Kingdom of Isles be my destiny?

[Bridge]
The drums are calling after dawn, fires burning shine so bright

[Refrain]
Sail, sail away, longboat hoard on the sea
For the Lord of the Isles, Scots and Norse will be free
Fight for our dream, the Black Hand's stranglehold we'll defeat

Somerled, son of Gillebride they call me
Thane of Argyle, the land of my youth
Now my destiny leads me towards the sea
Fight them at night of the Epiphany
Cut them down on the Isle Of Man
A new kingdom of freedom is what shall remain

[Bridge]

[Refrain]
