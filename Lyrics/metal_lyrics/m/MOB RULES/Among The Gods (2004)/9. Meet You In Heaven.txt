Good to hear that your spirit is free, that
your soul has forgotten the pain
Please take my advice not to care for my fate,
not to worry about all the rain

I hear you singing, your voice is my Eden
I see your face

I'll meet you in Heaven one day
And I promise the memories will stay
Meet you in heaven again
With my body, my soul and some plans

The circle of life has mysterious fields from the
birth till the end of your day
You live and you grow and you feel like a fool
and you throw all suggestions away

I hear you singing, your voice is my Eden
I see your face

I'll meet you in Heaven one day
And I promise the memories will stay
Meet you in heaven again
With my body, my soul and some plans

My journey through life had success, had a
sense 'cause my music will always survive
The songs that I wrote have been heard all the
time, were a twist, and a turn and a ride

I hear you singing, your voice is my Eden
I see your face

I'll meet you in Heaven one day
And I promise the memories will stay
Meet you in heaven again
With my body, my soul and some plans
