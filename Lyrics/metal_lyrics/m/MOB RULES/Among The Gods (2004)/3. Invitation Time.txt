When all the things in life are going wrong
You may find some help at the corner
There you meet a girl with cat-green eyes
And a body of a soap milk wonder

Get it in your ears
She opens up your mind
Get it in your head
Invitation time

From here to there
Your life's a golden rhyme
Keeps you warm and near
At her invitation time

And when your time is coming to an end
There's a gift behind the curtain
She leaves the room without a single word
But she knows that your spirit is certain

Get it in your ears
She opens up your mind
Get it in your head
Invitation time

From here to there
Your life's a golden rhyme
Keeps you warm and near
At her invitation time

Life feels so fine with a good and joyful ride

Get it in your ears
She opens up your mind
Get it in your head
Invitation time

From here to there
Your life's a golden rhyme
Keeps you warm and near
At her invitation time
