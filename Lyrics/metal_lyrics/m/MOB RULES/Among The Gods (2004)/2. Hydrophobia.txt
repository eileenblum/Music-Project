A name so famous in town
Reputation's much bigger than life
Nothing can bring your force down
And no reason for something to hide?

I see you suffer all the time
Fear and your weakness. Mr. Lie

Hydrophobia
Gynophobia
Deep inside you are weak and lost

Hydrophobia
Neophobia
In your soul you are sweet and soft

A hero, a star and a king
With ambitions to conquer the world
A fighter, your weapon - a sting
Afraid of women, just brave with the girls

But I see you crying all the time
No hope and no glory, that's Mr. Lie

Hydrophobia
Gynophobia
Deep inside you are weak and lost

Hydrophobia
Neophobia
In your soul you are sweet and soft

No hope and no glory, Mr. Lie

Hydrophobia
Gynophobia
Deep inside you are weak and lost

Hydrophobia
Neophobia
In your soul you are sweet and soft
