I lost my fear when she left the train
A final step into strange surroundings
My journey ends on the edge of pain
I see they all are here

I've spent too long on the inside out
My heart was cold and my soul was bleeding
I tried to creep back to normal life
And wished they all were here

It's been so long since she blew my clouds
Can't speak her name see the world is bleeding
An empty smile has betrayed her mouth
A hope they all were there

You make me wonder virgin
You make me see
And I haven't lost my way

Arabia - joined the eastern sunrise
Arabia - lost memories in your head
Arabia - kind of new horizon
Arabia - time was standing still

The grass was green and the sun was bright
The rain fell slow and the wind was calmer
Woke up one day found myself aside
Afraid they all have gone

You make me wonder
You make me see
And I haven't lost my way

Arabia - joined the eastern sunrise
Arabia - lost memories in your head
Arabia - kind of new horizon
Arabia - time was standing still
