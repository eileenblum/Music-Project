Wisdom comes and childhood goes
Time goes by, intentions grow

I left my home. I changed the earth with water
miles from hometown, left son and daughter

I sailed seven seas
I gave my life to the ocean
Searched for seven keys
On my way to you

I sailed the seven seas
I gave my life to the ocean
Searched for seven keys
On my journey back to you

No horizon, big black holes
stormy wind, the sea is cold

I left my past, I choose the truth of water
Lost my memories, no son no daughter

I sailed seven seas
I gave my life to the ocean
Searched for seven keys
On my way to you

I sailed the seven seas
I gave my life to the ocean
Searched for seven keys
On my journey back to you

I left my home, I changed the earth with water
miles from hometown, left son and daughter

I sailed seven seas
I gave my life to the ocean
Searched for seven keys
On my way to you

I sailed the seven seas
I gave my life to the ocean
Searched for seven keys
On my journey back to you
