Out of darkness see the horizon burns
Out of nowhere the evolution turns
And after all this the future looks pale

Inside your head hear the alarm bells ring
Outside your land you watch the godless thing
And after all this the daylight looks pale
And after all this your word has failed

Black rain has fallen on Earth
See the reason why we're fooling ourselves
Black rain as a symbol of hurts
Without solution for

Down on your skin there are some harmful signs
Burn like fire and let the x-rays shine
And after all this you see the sun is grey
After all this prevention failed

Black rain has fallen on Earth
See the reason why we're fooling ourselves
Black rain as a symbol of hurts
Without solution for this

And after all this the daylight looks pale
And after all this your word has failed

Black rain has fallen on Earth
See the reason why we're fooling ourselves
Black rain as a symbol of hurts
Without solutions

Black rain has fallen on Earth
See the reason why we're fooling ourselves
Black rain as a symbol of hurts
Without solution for
