Some glorious days have gone since we were true to ourselves
Some glorious ways were run without a truthful path
I don't complain about it - there ain't no way aside
Just count the days, ignore all when they call: "Give for paradise!"

It ain't so easy since we were born, got keys for
life so ride on and hear me, the prayer,
A legend of thoughts
They say "be good, don't change the world, be
bona fide be clever". you never could walk alone
on a journey back home

I you lost or failed your prayer, come to recognize
Waste no time to swear on prayer - got to give
for a step into paradise

Faith down - good for nothing
Faith down - the place in hell is hot
Faith down - take a warning
Faith down - your place among the gods

The pope so far the priest so near a fool like you
will never caress their ambitious ear
their weapon - your fear
they raped my soul they put me down, took all I
had I'm sad I', still the faithful one my father son

If you lost or failed your prayer come to recognize
Waste no time to swear on prayer - got to give
for a step into paradise

Faith down - good for nothing
Faith down - the place in hell is hot
Faith down - take a warning
Faith down - your place among the gods

some glorious days have gone since we were tru to ourselves
Some glorious ways were run without a truthful path
If you lost or failed your prayer come to recognize
Waste no time to swear on prayer - got to give
for a step into paradise
