Thunder, storm and lights were raging up in heaven
They're bringing water as the judgement of God
When he created earth he changed it on day seven
Made a rescue plan for all whose lives will never be in vain

Land of water, world of rain
Clouds above us 'cause they wash away our sins

Ship of fools
Save the true man from the sea
Ship of fools
Was their home for all who carry on believing

Those who walked on water reached the saving island
But those who can't became a victim of the sea
Feel the magic of the Holy and his right hand
You will realize the ones who fell in vain

Land of water, world of rain
Clouds above us 'cause they wash away our sins

Ship of fools
Save the true man from the sea
Ship of fools
Was their home for all who carry on believing

Land of water has washed away our sins

Ship of fools
Save the true man from the sea
Ship of fools
Was their home for all who carry on believing
