Follow the dark path, waiting to pass to the other side
Struggle the holy and weak, make your life a sin
Life's so depressive, this world has to pay
Kill for the devil, spread plague and evil
Consume your life from both sides, join the sect
Never have any child, this race has to die
Slash your mortal shell, listen to this voice
Satan is waiting, hear him calling

May the war bells chime again
Feel the power to give death
No one of them is innocent
Smell the stench of their fear
Sequestred in the dark
Humiliation and torture
Destroy the human rights
Desecrate the creation of god
And when you lose the taste
When supplies don't your eyes anymore
End your misery life
Suicide for Satan

Destroy your life for Satan
