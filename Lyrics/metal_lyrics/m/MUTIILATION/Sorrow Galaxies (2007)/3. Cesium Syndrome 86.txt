Cold strange ice rock known from those without name
The pit for the sins of mankind, we had to pay
The spiral who sucked the errant souls, we had to pay

Stone cold entity
Over eternities of solitude
Revealing the nest of all plagues
Rust corrode the golden kingdom
Over eras of damnation
War among humans
Generations condamned to decay
Anonymous actors of the rotting process
Low life winter for centuries
Apocalyptic rains of fire and lead
X-termination through nuclear massive waves
Yoke of the boiling atoms cauldron

Test tubes with living abominations
Cancer creeps over forthcoming natality
No god or science will never release from radioactivity,
drilling the earth to poison the antipods
Boiling underneath the ground, opened a pit of hollow fire
Humans have splitted the atom of god
Cesium syndrom 86 of satan
A taste of lead and rust must bite your lips
Naevus as a tatooed face of evil
Mutant apparitions contorting fingers and faces
Bizarre monster births over years after the tragedy
Degenerated freaks as caricatures of god's creation
Hail a crucified siamese hermaphrodit as a new idol

Through the devastated landscapes
The deserted city of doom
Concrete as witness of the devil's eye
Phantom of the past radiation penetrating every layers of the ground, activation of mother earth raping process; death creeps among the living ones

War for survival or another poisoned ration
Armed sick zombies feasting on their brother's flesh
Remains of the human creation
