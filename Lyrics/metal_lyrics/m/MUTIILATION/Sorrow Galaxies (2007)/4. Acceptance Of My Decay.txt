The distortion of laws and times send morals to black holes
Riding on a razor's edge beetween live and death
The cold blade of consciousness deeply bite within my flesh
Asperger microcosm with confined flesh walls
May the tornado of lost sould wrap my putrid shell
And blow me to another place and another dirt
Flashes to flashes...dirt to dirt...drink the wine of denial
The dust of time let place to bitter senility
The powder to my face, this poison to my veins
Nothing remains but sick remorse
Rotting alone in disgrace with disgust as only friend
Wandering in a cold void, the nomad of my soul
An age of confusion
The nomad of my soul...
The universe of my mind absorbs human notions
The distortion of laws and times send morals to black holes
Tomorrow will be worse, everlasting borderline, the black venom feeds my cold pump
Poisoning my essence as the wine of plague, my karma is blackening within my veins

Melancholic child who never found the light
Eyes full of tears
Yesterday seems it will last forever
Hope is dead
Nothing is all around
Abstraction of my feelings
Cure is a lost illusion
Healing will never come

The cosmos inside my brain distorts laws of time and space,, some rememberances violently come back to the surface
Blur nebulaes of the past explode from an ethylic mist, to give birth to a marvellous tumor, a star has died
But as soon you're coming nearer you can see the acid truth that burns your eyes as a mysticism is no more
Hate me for what i am, love me for what i'll never be
I'm yours you know as long as you belong to me
Drinking my words, feeling it fine as your cunt brain opens for me, the spems that stain your face is mine
And you ask for another song motherfucker, forget anything you learnt, another world is coming, oh i know it's not with me
Have a bitter time
Voices to my head call me down
Evil in my flesh guide me through the night
In a universe of mist, what could be my thoughts
Alcohol as a fuel that keeps my corpse warm enough for those to see, art has become my own decay in a world where they vainly build
On what'd already ruins for me
I know who I am...
Neurotic galaxies, chemical nebulaes, the cosmos is just my brain, my soul is the center of my autist universe
Big bang in my soul , tornadoes in my head, I wished it was the last just as it began
Misery as a vocation, ethilic gates opens for me, yelling my agony to the night, hell as a promised deal
Nests of flies peeling my eyes, alcohol blurs my vision, colder everything is now, he's coming to take me
