I hate the way they move and exist but they're surrounding me.
I cried for days because of you, I wish you all die soon. No mercy for humans.
You all tried to push me to the coffin, I touched the worst is death.
Now I'm here to make you suffer, to lead you to my own grave. No mercy for humans.
But in a hidden place where men fear to cross the river, far in the forest,
Candles burn on a stone crypt. All around the fire, painted black and grimly,
They curse the world they let behind them, without regret.
They are a few but so different and so dark...
Far common life of man, keep the ancient flame.
Metal nights of sadism and lust, may the dark flame burn again! No mercy for humans.
Returning to primitive rites, may the human race die.
To let place to our black kingdom, for ever, for ever. No mercy for humans.
Save me, I'm drowned by this world, I want to end now it's too long.
I wanna die and I fucking cry, see what you have done of me.
And fewer again of them leaved to touch the eternal flame.
Those who choose the night, those who choose their way. No mercy for humans.
Breathing the silence of the woods, forget the lost world.
Another force, darker than ever possesses your life and soul. No mercy for humans.
And the ones who didn't feel the force to leave stayed in bitterness.
Among the humans and became like them, no way back, no way back, no way back.
No mercy for humans.
