Far beyond any times...Once was a garden in edenIgnorance can't be keptBy the One made to rule Through ancient times of hidden dimensionsI rised immortal as a plagueMy kingdom opens as the gates of HellRiding the blizzard, wolves bark Controlling a barbaric real of unknownWhere bats fly in the candles' lightFrozen mountains reaching the skyHiding the castle of doom Sorrow spreads, the populations cryPawns don't need to feelWeakness is to be drivenHumans need a guide Learning mystical sphere of knowledge,becoming self a god A dark supremacy fromancient forgotten forcesBut only one is born to rule his ego,Those of a dead god, to be the One...Diabolical intelligence, conspiracy and warBy hate and fear I lead their soulsAs the Serpent, I am their knowledgeMy power is far scealedin their empty thoughts... As the world falls in ruins, chaos is mineMy throne darkening the landsoppress the massesWar rules the earth I am the highest emperorBlack forces dominationA world of endless duskInto the mist of Darkness Death rises and laughs...Tragedy...Hell...
