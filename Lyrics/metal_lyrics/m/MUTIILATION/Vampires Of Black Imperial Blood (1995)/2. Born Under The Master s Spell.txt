Born under the master's spell

In the past plague years, a village enchanted by fear
Tales of the crucified hadn't yet reached the ancient beliefs
Frozen by a malevolent magnetism, under the master's spell
Everyone dread the black hill knowing from where Evil comes

Born under the master's spell

A gate's opened to Hell
On each fullmoon night a virgin disappears
As an evil sentence terrifying the masses
Under the yoke
Mystified by centuries, enslaved mortals living in fear
Under the yoke

Through the mist of times, on the hill a black fortress rises
As an eye, the eye of Satan
Dark and cold, infinitely malevolent
Sad and so old, the eye of Satan
