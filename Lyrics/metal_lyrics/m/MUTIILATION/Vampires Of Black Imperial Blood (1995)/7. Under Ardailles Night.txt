Our magnificent union is the one of sadnessDrowned in the massacremistInto the black night of EvilThrough infernal fog The Gestalt is our circleThe dark fraternity is ourVampires' night beginsUnder the yoke of SatanInto the woods and mountainsWhere sorcery rules... ...Where my dreams have rung the bell of despairOur kingdom seems never comeI lay under the starry nightOf the sky of ArdaillesForever far from humansI'll stay frozen on the grey stonesFar... Sorrow...
