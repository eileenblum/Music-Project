We are the ones of no hope
We are the ones without God
No more reason to play as you lose every day

No way to erase the past as now is already the future
Another dose will kill that before dawn that's for sure
Another tomb will be closed on my dead remorse
Another bitter anesthesia will drown my emotions
Oh Satan... would you give me the force to end
Oh Satan... to end with life now

An useless way follows my steps
Where's the reason to move when everything collapse

We are the ones of no hope
We are the ones without God
No more reason to play as you lose every day

I don't search any way out to escape this boring downfall
The old world is dying with me, I'm the end of a time

Each lie that tears my soul is what you call a light of hope
Each time God shows his face I'll kill myself with dope
Everything left behind me's gone through waves of bitterness
Another day is ending drowning myself in the pit
Oh Satan... would you give me the force to end
Oh Satan... to end with life now

The grey world falls in ruins without emotion
A civilization extinction I don't feel anything
Vultures haunt the concrete and the iron turned to rust
The age of ashes comes forth
The old world's era has been and will never be again
Any life dies as the fields burn
None will remember what we have been
The time of chaos is on

The grey world falls in ruins without emotion
A civilization extinction I don't feel anything
Vultures haunt the concrete and the iron turned to rust
The age of ashes comes forth
The old world's era has been and will never be again
Any life dies as the fields burn
None will remember what we have been
The time of chaos is on
