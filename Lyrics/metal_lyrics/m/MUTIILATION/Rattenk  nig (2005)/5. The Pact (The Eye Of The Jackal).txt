This is my soul... Satan
This is my blood... Satan
This is my mind... Satan
This is my corpse... Satan

I'll recrucify the Nazareth slut
For your coming
I'll erase the existence of Christ
In your name
I'll sacrifice my life to follow your cause
I also changed my name to deny God

This is my soul... Satan
This is my blood... Satan
This is my mind... Satan
This is my corpse... Satan

I'll speak your serpent tongue
My poetry will carry your words

Promise me fortune... Satan
Promise me glory... Satan
Promise me youth eternal... Satan
Promise me power over all... Satan

My art is yours... my voice shall spit your hate
I'll be the proselyte of a damned generation

Give me life eternal with power above humans
Give me the strength to rape the virgin whore
Give me the knife to cut the throat of the lamb
Give me the three black horns to nail the bastard Jew

Carry the flame of evil through my rotten semen
To establish a new world devoted to your cause
I'll see through the eye of the jackal
Until any light dies... for thou art the future
