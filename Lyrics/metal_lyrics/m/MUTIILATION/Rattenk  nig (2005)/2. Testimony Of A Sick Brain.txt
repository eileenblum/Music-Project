None of their so called joy can't light my apathy
Morbid desires of torture flash in my brain
Wherever I go thoughts of violence prevail
His voice arouse me to create art with flesh
Loneliness support the static depression
When a thousand dreadful sins stick to my mind

I'm becoming stronger drinking your vital wine
Never enough blood to satisfy my sinner's soul
I show no interest to the common living world
My lustful ecstasy comes from the dead's kingdom
Years pass as sanity downfalls
Short moments of lucidity rare but unbearable

I live in a world where silence doesn't exist
The black dog asked me to hush them all
This is my testimony for the mad man to hear
Please someone get those children killed

At every door of hope that close in front of your face
You ask yourself if what kills you is a real sickness
This hostile force to hate the world and God's creation
Too late to change or evolve, no need to try anymore
Impossible and useless to wait for a cure
Feelings of scorn and reject will corrode the future

Impossible shapes take structure in my mind
I see strange shadows surrounding me at night
Sick and gruesome architecture of my brain's cells
Distortion of time, values and reason
Knowing it will end by a violent way
I keep on decaying

I live in a world where silence doesn't exist
The black dog asked me to hush them all
This is my testimony for the blind man to read
People in the future will study and admire my work
