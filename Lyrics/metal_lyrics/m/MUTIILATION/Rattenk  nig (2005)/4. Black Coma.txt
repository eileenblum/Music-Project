Existence as a constant disease...
Anything forthcoming is stained with the absorption of a new torment
The time is running and I don't want to find any escape

Black coma

Fed up with rotted joys melted with daily pain...
Fuck my life and fuck myself
Each night is one more step to the end...
And I know the end is coming soon

Black coma
Black coma
Black coma
Black coma

My shotgun has the shape of a glass
Which slowly sucks my essence out
Drink and swell 'till the world doesn't exist...
Worse is the future and forever will be...

Black coma
