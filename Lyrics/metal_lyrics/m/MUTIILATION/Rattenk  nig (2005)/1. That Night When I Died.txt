I'm the grim apocalypse coming from far cosmic dimensions
I perform through your feeble world and the ways of destruction
My appearance is the so called one of humans but I obey to my master's
I've been sent here as a sentence, a mission against God

Eternity is the price I have to pay...
Downfall of the time day after day

Hardly remembering the time of life but sure was under the sign 666
I thought I was about to know the secrets of Hell and death mysteries
When dead I found a dimension where time and space didn't exist
After eternity of suffering I'm back for my millennium of glory

I crossed eras that you will never know...
That night when I died, I lost my soul

Oh, thousand tortures cold forged me in hate
Oh, until I came back from the dead

So morbidly obsessed to erase any life from the galaxy
Destroying any relief and blow my soul
To never be reborn again in their godly world to leave this place to where it belong

Life should reveal many secrets too hidden to the living world
Death has well opened its gates and showed me the dead light of truth
I opened my arms to Satan as the light faded at my funeral
At least I've been what I wanted fuck off the rest of the world

That night when I died all became black...
There's no relief for the immortal

Oh, thousand tortures cold forged me in hate
Oh, until I came back from the dead

I'm the grim apocalypse coming from far cosmic dimensions
I perform through your feeble world and the ways of destruction
My appearance is the so called one of humans but I obey to my master's
I've been sent here as a sentence, a mission against God

Eternity is the price I have to pay...
Downfall of the time day after day

Hardly remembering the time of life but sure was under the sign 666
I thought I was about to know the secrets of Hell and death mysteries
When dead I found a dimension where time and space didn't exist
After eternity of suffering I'm back for my millennium of glory

I crossed eras that you will never know...
That night when I died, I lost my soul
