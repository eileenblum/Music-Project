At the time of my human death
Icy fingers grip my corpse
Black shadows surround my shell
Descending the smoky spiral to Hell
Vertigo and visions of lust
Ecstasy beyond pleasure and pain
Agonizing lives capture my sight
A realm of flesh

The promise of thousands delights
Voluptuous torture yells
Infinite sensations for eternity
God is dead hail Satan

Far from God
In Hell I sink
Far from God

God is dead hail Satan
Infinite sensations for eternity
Voluptuous torture yells
The promise of thousands delights

A realm of flesh
Agonizing lives capture my sight
Ecstasy beyond pleasure and pain
Vertigo and visions of lust
Descending the smoky spiral to Hell
Black shadows surround my shell
Icy fingers grip my corpse
At the time of my human death
