I got a letter from you today
Should I listen to what it has to say

You said you would bring me back one day
But you never did, you never did

Forgotten is your face, forgotten is this place
A town of silence replaced with violence
Oh God you were so sick, this fog has grown so thick
I cannot find my way, will you be here today

There was a hole here but now it's gone
This war zone where my inner demons won

This dark descent is your Inferno
I will never let you let me go
