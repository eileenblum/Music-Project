I've seen it all before, this disappointment
I yearn for something more than your judgment

Linger here in the space between
Are these shackles in my head
On my heart this Hell has fed
Linger here with the obscene
I had to see it all
From the depths I did crawl

I've played the waiting game
And now you want me to see
Your demands as an apology

Linger here with us for a while
You claim that you are pure
I've seen your kind before
Linger here and become defiled
My soul's been torn apart
Time to find a new start
