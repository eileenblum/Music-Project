Rumination is the cure
To the pain of our plight
This fire we will endure
We'll rise into the night

Our denial of servitude
Is survival - Vicissitude

The rebel speaks
Awakened from denial
We will make a stand
They'll know our guile

A fallen angel's grin
Embodiment of bedlam
Carry the flag of sin
We are Pandemonium
