We've found the moment when the hunter becomes prey
We'll become lower than the lowest of men
I would murder the world for her
I need those unafraid to look beneath

Life without death is my mountain and river

There is a pantheon of Devils and their pawns
They hunt for their prize whispering their own lies
This is their demimonde - a cold world without God
No pain and no more light, embrace eternal night

We have our parts to play
And mine is being human
I've lived with a secret that rivals the Devil's own
All seek the Scorpion Mother of the Damned

Men are not Gods they are Hell on Earth
