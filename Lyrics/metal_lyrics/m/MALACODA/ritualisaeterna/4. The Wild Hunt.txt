Awake yet asleep in a violent state
Gently they weep for nothingness' fate
Their dead men's hearts still hold a beat
Idols torn apart, decayed underneath

And when the ice reaches the sky
Is when I'll arrive
A sign of impending doom
I've come to take you to the place
Where innocence dies
A place where death prevails

We have come to take all the young

It's said they were kings and legends long dead
Riding beasts of war, permeating dread
They whisper at the door to the end of time
Their breath like knives as they recite this rhyme
