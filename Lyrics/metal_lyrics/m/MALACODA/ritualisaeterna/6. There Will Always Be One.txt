Look upon my works
And despair
There's nothing for you here
If you dare
This darkness is my own
Mine to keep
Though it has grown tall
There's more to go

There will always be one
Who won't heed the wise
There will always be one
Birthing our demise
The seed has sown
And drenched in your blood
Let it all become known
Things are as they should

These rules are not mine
They're etched in stone
Who do you think you are
To demand my soul
The shadows or the day
Are one and the same
You cannot have the warmth
Without the flame
