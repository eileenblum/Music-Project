I do not know where the road will lead
I cannot find the solace you've given me
If you would be so kind as to show the way
I will follow close, I won't fall astray

How could you grow so cold?
The wounds show
Lobotomy of the heart
My eyes are frozen shut
I'll never know
Lobotomy of the heart

The door's been left wide open, am I free to go?
In this insane asylum, the broken roam
Bring death to the fire, long live the crow
