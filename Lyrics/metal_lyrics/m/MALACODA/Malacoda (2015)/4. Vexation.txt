Our time is short
A year in a day
What is our worth?
Who is to say?

I tried to be more than this
I rose above this shit
But when my wings were clipped
Vexation settled in

Eat, loathe and mate
The way to survive
Ingrained in us
All of our lives

Swarming, flying
Crawling, spying
Never knowing where they're going
Live for a day
Then replaced
There's just too much noise, they just multiply
