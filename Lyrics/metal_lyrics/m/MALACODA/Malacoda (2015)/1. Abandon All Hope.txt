I don't know where to go with my life
There's far too much fear and strife
I remember my darker past
Through the woods of error at last

Abandon all hope and embrace your fears
Swallow your pride and freeze your tears

Infernal pride has dragged me down
Betrayed by life, blur my sight
Violent thoughts displayed with sound
I regain power tonight

Midway on our life's path we fall
Pushed by desire we may crawl
Into Hell I go before death
As I descend I hold my last breath

Abandon all hope all entering here
Sing your sorrows and take in your fear
