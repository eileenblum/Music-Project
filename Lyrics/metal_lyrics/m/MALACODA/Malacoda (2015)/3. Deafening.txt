In the blink of an eye
It's still hard to see
One minute here another gone
I'm still asking why

I can't hear you anymore my friend
I have the fear that I'm going deaf

I cannot hear you
I've never seen you
Ashes to ashes
My world- it crashes

Gasp for air and sigh
My voice has failed
The importance of silence known
It's consequences dulled

My ears are bleeding and ringing loud
Tinnitus caused by your falling down
