Why can't I see?
I can't believe
This cult won't save
Blood won't grant hope

Cutting deeper into your soul
Timeless Reaper will take his toll
Bleeding out, dying slow
The other side you shall know

I wait on you
My words won't sate
Your blood won't please
Your God of Grief

Charon's light brightly glows
Through the river: unearthly woes
Reborn again without a voice
Flesh is not sin- this was your choice

This was your voice, there is no choice
This was your choice, there is no voice
This was your voice, there is no choice
This was your choice, there is no voice
