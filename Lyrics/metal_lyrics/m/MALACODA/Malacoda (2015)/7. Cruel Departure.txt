Do not welcome me back home
Your outstretched arms: an iron maiden
I'd be better off alone

We aren't the same
So we'll split up farther
Who is to blame
For our cruel departure?

I do not fear your fists
But your words still burn
What do we make of this
Of ourselves what was learned?

Go away, go away
Away from here
Go away, go away
Away from here
