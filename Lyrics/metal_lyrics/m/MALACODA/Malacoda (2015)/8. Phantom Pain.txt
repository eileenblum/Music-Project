I can't see the wound, but I feel the burn
What's the cure for when the mind feels spurned?
In the light I know it is not real
Yet in the dark I cannot feel

I can't tell what's real or fake
Phantom pain will only take
Phantom pain will only take

Always haunting me, preventing sleep
Damn this ghost of the mind is tormenting me
When my body fails I fall down deep
Specter of my thoughts just won't let me be

I can't find the cause of this affliction
There's no cure for restless thought addiction
In the dark I see the cure to my plight
Yet I'm not strong enough to face my fright
