I had a plan
Nothing you could understand
Not given a chance
Why am I damned?

Never seen, never heard
The smallest action: the loudest word
I will die, yet I'll remain
You'll only know my other name

I'm just a man
This is not who I am
Time for a break
I have no power

You will never fade from me
You're more than just a pipe dream
