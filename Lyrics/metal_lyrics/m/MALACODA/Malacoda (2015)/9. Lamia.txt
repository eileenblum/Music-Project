Insincerity
Is what you are
Embodiment of lies
A serpent whore

No more lies my dear, nothing left to fear
Gorgon you are not, your power will rot

Fork tongued lies, tortured eyes
Feel it grow, learn to know
Accept fate, love to hate
Anathema, Lamia

Keep going down this path and
See what will be
Is there anything left of
Your humanity
Revert to older ways
Return to your hole
Sleep for a hundred years and
Never grow old

Stories fade
Into myth
Lies will change
Look what's become of this
