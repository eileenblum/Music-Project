Emerged from blackness I am, but for a reason
Challenged the lions but now it's gone
One of the few and not the inferior
I never want it to end - before I ever reach the day

All I know - all engines go
Burn bridges from my past - I'm from the west of Hell
I realize - there's no disguise
The king that is myself - I'm comin' from the west of Hell

I'm takin' you for a ride, to my universe
From blackest cities to ashen ground
We're heading for disaster - shakin' hands with damnation
To the limit, to the very overload

All I know - all engines go
Burn bridges from my past - I'm from the west of Hell
I realize - there's no disguise
The king that is myself - I'm comin' from the west of Hell

What I know - on the run and on the go
It's unknown - comin' for the kill - and I'm there!

All I know - all engines go
Burn bridges from my past - I'm from the west of Hell
I realize - there's no disguise
The king that is myself - I'm comin' from the west of Hell
From the west of Hell yeah...
