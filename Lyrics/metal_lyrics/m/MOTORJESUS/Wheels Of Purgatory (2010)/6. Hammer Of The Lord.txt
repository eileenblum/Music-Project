Justice is unforgiving - word of god - his gun
He will punish sin and greed - seven sins have done
In the streets there's riot, in the streets there's war
You will face the consequence - demolition when he comes
Sacrament to the holy - in his sign - he stands alone

Hammer of the Lord - and there is only one
Hammer of the Lord - of the father and the son

He's standing, against it, the eyes of Lucifer
Demonic behavior accepted never more
When there's armageddon, he still stands as one
Fearing his conviction, he's got the damage done - it's done!
Sacrament to the holy - in his signs, he stands alone

Hammer of the Lord - And there is only one
Hammer of the Lord - Of the father and the son

Not the only - I'm the holy one - I felt, only sacred - only one
Everybody knows - salvation comes for everyone
Everybody knows - apocalypse or Heaven denied

Hammer of the Lord - and there is only one - the only one
Hammer of the Lord - of the father and the son
Hammer of the Lord - Unbroken holy one - the holy one
Hammer of the Lord - of the father and the son
