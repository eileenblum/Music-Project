I'm the man, I'm the man - the shapeless, fearless dragon brother
A legend, iron hand - a fist of fury - a strike to the others
Master and machine - determined and clean
Aim for wisdom and choose your weapon
Be the water my friend and it flows till the end of your days
He was the man of knowledge - father the son
Balance the good deeds and the damage is done

War - He's a man of war - Unlike anyone before
The fist of the dragon - and it's calling for - war

I'm the man - Iron man - Burning words and fighting spirit
Tiger style, freedom ringer - to kill one man with his
Left finger - Mind soul and fire
Raging fist dragon eye - We will never forget
He was the true believer - Follow the sun
He hits you harder than a hammer had done

War - He's a man of war - Unlike anyone before
The fist of the dragon - and it's calling for - war

Bow down, the legend - the fist of interception
Now become the master -  no one can beat you faster

War - He's a man of war - Unlike anyone before
The fist of the dragon - and it's calling for - war
