Bound to this fire, I walk alone - holy to dirty water
We stopped at nothing - what's left of home?
When all the walls are broken
I'm preparing for war - No master of the game
Deceived and betrayed
I've foreseen what you do - predictable move
The day I may lose - damnation

I believe - this is neverending
No release - fuel the warmachine in me

Four walls of vengeance - returning home
Trying to find the order
When shapes of nothing - building my home
Will lead us to disorder
Life misleads us to death
I cast it all away
And another day - salvation

I believe - this is neverending
No release - fuel the warmachine in me

The slave become the master - there's nothing heading - after me
The slave becomes the master - but what is comin' after this?

I believe - this is neverending
No release - fuel the warmachine in me
Can't believe - this is neverending
Finally - break the warmachine - that's me
