Take me back, let's go back in time - from 91 - 99
Where all was fun, when we drank too much
Back to the front in electric shock
That's insane, hallowed thy name
Crown myself king, feel the monstrosity rising again
Good violent fun, swore to the one
This was more than religion
Feel the monstrosity rising again - rising again

Fire - burn from below - because we are not immortal
Fire - burn from below - this time it is not long gone - it's on

I'm still a sixteen year old little guy
With hair and booze and horns in the sky
Black and blue was our uniform
We sought rebellion but those days have gone
It's the same - rising again
Clearly I see - this love and blackened and sanctuary
Leather and spike, drunk on my bike
This was our domination
Second to none, it comes rising again - rising again

Fire - burn from below - because we are not immortal
Fire - burn from below - this time it is not long gone
Fire - 99 it's on - not immortal 
Fire - 99 it's on - not long gone

I believe there's a new revolution - gathering for once
For all - this time it's a new revolution - now!

Fire - burn from below - because we are not immortal
Fire - 99 it's on - not long gone

Everybody knows there's a new revolution
I know I'll be back till then
Everybody knows it's a new revolution there
