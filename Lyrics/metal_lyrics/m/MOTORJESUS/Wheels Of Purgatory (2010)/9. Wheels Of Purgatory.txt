I've burn the holy gasoline - I rode the death
I've came - I've seen
I'm buried 10 feet underground
But a solution never found
I am the rising, the rocking, the chief of machines
I'm the never bound, I'm the man
So undecided, deny it, alive and unseen
when everything had lost the destination
So, it's burning me no more - the only reason
It's burning me - anymore

Blackmail, steal and lie - told a thousand times
For a new found glory - wheels of purgatory

Cast out of Hell and back again - bring demolition in the end
I spend the blood, the energy - black holes are opened up for me
The lord of lying, of nothing - of fortune and fame
Fear the unknown and ahead of it all - forever blinded, enlightened
And this is my game - here's what you wanted
But prepare for the fall
So, I'm buried here no more - for no more reason
I'm buried down - anymore

Blackmail, steal and lie - told a thousand times
For a new found glory - wheels of purgatory
Black, fuel, stay alive - told 10,000 lies
Wheels of purgatory - sacrifice is killing me no more

I'm facing my destiny - I'm ready, I'm prepared
For the sorrow - for the sorrow - I'm hollow

Blackmail, steal and lie - told a thousand times
For a new found glory - wheels of purgatory
Black, fuel, stay alive - told 10,000 lies
Wheels of purgatory - sacrifice is killing me no more
...this cold life is killing me no more
