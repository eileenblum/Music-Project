Of Heaven and hellfire - feel the reincarnation
Of a new god that is my own - I know
Welcome the saints back from the past
Nothing more and nothing less
But we're trying to believe in nothing new
Our time is now - the only light - that we have seen
I know he brings - the only light

Thy kingdom will come - thy will shall be done
Swear to the unseen - the church of booze and kerosene

He's near - It's the hour - no need for blasphemy - yeah
You meet the maker of the rock
Exchange the demons of your past
Testament of heaviness - Heaven and Hell out of control - we get it on
His reign is now - the guiding light
That we should see - I know he brings - the only light

Thy kingdom will come - thy will shall be done
Swear to the unseen - the church of booze and kerosene
We all shall become - the saints of the steel
Higher than I am - the church of booze and kerosene

It is breakin' loose - to the other side
"So, demon my name - rising gain - fear the unholy one"

Thy kingdom will come - thy will shall be done
Swear to the unseen - the church of booze and kerosene
We all shall become - the saints of the steel
Higher than I am - the church of booze and kerosene
