Full steam, take down - hellfire revelation
Breakout before - here comes the resurrection
Welcome to my doom - accelerate, forward, I'm rolling on
Left all behind - terminating the old life
Something's waiting deep down in the heart of me and I can't wait to set it free

Get it on I'm the king of the road - unspoiled - unbound - unbroken
I'm the tank with the kerosene load - and I will leave you behind

I know the Lord is an 8 foot killing machine
Have faith in steel - control the situation I need
And what stands in our way - full throttle we're blowing that damn thing up
I rush, I dash - I never be the last one
There's still something unleashed in the heart of me and I can't wait to set it free

Get it on I'm the king of the road - unspoiled - unbound - unbroken
I'm the tank with the kerosene load - and I will leave you behind

Now cause the damage, take the open road
Of demolition and of selling souls
Break up and try to stop the thinkin'
There is one way toward this Hell I'm in
Live in filth and die in sin - this road is goin' on and on

Get it on I'm the king of the road - unspoiled - unbound - unbroken
I'm the tank with the kerosene load - and I will leave you behind
Get it on I'm the king of the road - unspoiled - unbound - unbroken
Get it on I'm the king of the road - unspoiled - unbound - unbroken...
Get it on, get on - on a dead end road
Get it on, get on - on a dead end road
