This is the turning point - the Devil knows my name
The day that I corrode
Back from the early grave - and this is not the same
To rise or to explode
I fear not what I become - I fear not - come over

Electric rise - riding on - this is the hour
Electric rise - into the unknown
I ride with the king of the dead

Backstabber, who betrayed me - try to eliminate me
The secrets you have told are known
Who sees it clearer now - 66 burning rounds
The casket and the cold
I fear not what I become - I fear not - come over

Electric rise - riding on - this is the hour
Electric rise - into the unknown
I ride with the king of the dead

In these electric eyes - I'm feeling no more tears
This is my destiny - loud and forever

Electric rise - riding on - this is the hour
Electric rise - into the unknown
I ride with the king of the dead
