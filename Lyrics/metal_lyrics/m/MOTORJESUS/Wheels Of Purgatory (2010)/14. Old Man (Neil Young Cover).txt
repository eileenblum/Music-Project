Old man - look at my life - I'm a lot like you were
Old man - look at my life - I'm a lot like you were
Old man - look at my life - twenty four and there's so much more
Live alone in a paradise that makes me think of two
Love lost - such a cost - give me things that don't get lost
Like a coin that won't get tossed - rolling home to you

Old man - take a look at my life - I'm a lot like you
I need someone to love me the whole day through
Ah, one look in my eyes and you can't tell that's true

Lullabies - look in your eyes - run around the same old town
Doesn't mean that much to me - to mean that much to you
I've been first and last - look at how the time goes past
But I'm all alone at last - rolling home to you

Old man - take a look at my life - I'm a lot like you
I need someone to love me the whole day through
Ah, one look in my eyes and you can tell that's true

Old man - look at my life - I'm a lot like you were
Old man - look at my life - I'm a lot like you were
