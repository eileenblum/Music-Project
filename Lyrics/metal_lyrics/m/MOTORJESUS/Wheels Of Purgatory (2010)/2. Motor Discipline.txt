This is the night of testimonial
The 10 commandments of the v12 engine
We praise the party ceremonial - we start the fire
And the steel starts bending - now
Gentlemen, start your engines...
Ready - set (Break out now) 3, 2, 1 - Go!

Feed my motor - Powerloader - Can't be sober - Motor discipline
Fuel on fire - Burning tires - I'm ignited - Motor discipline

I can feel the heat that's on my back tonight
I ride the monster and the brakes are broken
Put the pedal down to make it right
I'm escaping Hades when the gates wide open
Opponents prepare for round two
Ready - set (Break out now!) 3, 2, 1 - Go!

Feed my motor - Powerloader - Can't be sober - Motor discipline
Fuel on fire - Burning tires - I'm ignited - Motor discipline

Breakout - heat - full throttle now
Running on - bring the evil to rise
Shortcuts - in rush - high octane
Second to none - let the temperature rise

I think I'm running faster - believe there's no one after
I think I'm gonna make it - motor discipline
One with the burning tires - the asphalt is on fire
Tonight you're gonna face the - motor discipline
