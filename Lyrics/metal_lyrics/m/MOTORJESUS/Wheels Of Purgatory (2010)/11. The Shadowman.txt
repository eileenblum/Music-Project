Demon! Sit there and wait for the trial - there is no denial
It's always too late for me - the black suit is my resistance
The animal instinct - apart from reality
There's a Devil in disguise - soul is changing, through my eyes
Condemnation - now decides - one who seeks sanctuary

Rise up - back down - I am the shadowman
The day - become - ways of the shadowman

Destroy the rules, regulations
The reincarnation - the gallows awaiting me...
There's a Devil in disguise
Soul is changing, through my eyes
Condemnation - now decides - one who seeks sanctuary

Rise up - back down - I am the shadowman
The day - become - ways of the shadowman

Fire turned me - to be shadowman
Fighting my way, turning away - feeling this is not over

Rise up - back down - I am the shadowman
The day - become - ways of the shadowman

Rise up - back down - I,m the shadowman
The day - become - ways of the shadowman
