Unbeliever - the walls stare at me
Bring the power back to where it should be
I found a solution - my time was always hard against me
So I found a solution
Facing it with a smile - so out of emptiness

No you can't count down to zero - you can't erase or rewind
But you will always remember - it stays forever there

The foundation - shatter before me
Determination - Came back to what I believe
My heavy load is - my end is drawing near before my old eyes
I take and had given - under the forgiving path of time
So out of emptiness

No you can't count down to zero - you can't erase or rewind
But you will always remember - it stays forever there

The signs are always there

No you can't count down to zero
Down to zero - you can't erase or rewind - erase or rewind
But you will always remember - remember
It stays forever there - forever
