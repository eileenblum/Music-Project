a new messiah, in a line of fire
welcome to the city of the now infected yeah
another maker, knows the undertaker
causing double damage for the banished come on

the revolution, final retribution
on the third day im reborn, to renew it all
the holy water, erase the new disorder
in darkness there is light along the way

if you need him - search inside - to survive

there is more - resurrection goin on
now you stand up again
to make your way back alive

judas betrayer, say your final prayer
i will rise and i will become the one
a new religion, against the opposition
i hide in sanctuary now i need it no more

city of sinners, none can ever save us
4 riders come, they appeared - to erase it all
all non-believers, and all of my demons
you shall be spared no more

if you need him, search inside
to survive, if you believe in him deceide
to survive

there is more...
arise again - calling from the dead again
now you stand up again
to make your way back alive

this is the new messiah...

there is more...
arise again - this is resurrection man
understand this fight
to make your way back alive
