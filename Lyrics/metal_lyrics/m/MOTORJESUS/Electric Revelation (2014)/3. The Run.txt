A black soul, black dynamite
Raise the dead, when the time is right
I went on down the road I'm on to see the dawn again

I feed the mouth with gasoline
I'm a part of a wrecking machine
We have come for the power to unleash the dawn of men

Concrete, grey, we belong
Separating right from wrong
After all said and done
There's an army of one...

It goes on and on
Leave it all alone
On the run trying to catch me when I'm gone
It is rolling on
It goes on and on
And all the barricades are shattered when I'm done

When we were kings, all that we feel
On our throne
No more beggars could steal
Feel it,
The race for the crown is going on again

I seal the seven sacraments
A new religion for the cold and the damned
Full steam ahead to get that prophecy fulfilled

Raise your dead from the sleep
There's a sacrament to keep
After all dead and gone
There's an army of one...

It goes on and on
Leave it all alone
On the run trying to catch me when I'm gone
It is rolling on
It goes on and on
And all the barricades are shattered when I'm done

A full resurrection through purgatory
Another halo of hypocrisy
Renew the walls of the grave once again
And here we go again

It goes on and on
Leave it all alone
On the run trying to catch me when I'm gone
It is rolling on
It goes on and on
And all the barricades are shattered when I'm done

I'm the sinner!
