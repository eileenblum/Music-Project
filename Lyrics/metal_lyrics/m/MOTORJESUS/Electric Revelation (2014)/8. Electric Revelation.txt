the electricity is rising, for my destiny
time's running out 10 take the lead
the spark ignited, you will see
the man that brings us his salvation, or the final call
new retribution on the rise
and we will have to face it all

strike, black skies above, feel the storm has come
feel the tension, the rise of denial

for we have built, the new machine
the warhead will burn the sun, electric revelation
believe in me, the lightning comes
for we can not overcome, electric revelation

at least we testify, we face the unavoidable
relentless burn the bridges down
when final benediction comes
he'll cast the storm, that brings new life, out for a better day
electric souls remain unbroken, in this apocalypse reign

he will strike em down, evil be undone
we'll becoming, the saints of hellfire

for we have built, the new machine ...

march on, strike down, as long as the predator comes
destroy, rebuild, send out to be part of the kill
7 heads, reign to cease, has been called
it's the march of the beast, the end is nigh - final trial
7 angels will appear from the sky

for we have built, the new machine ...

electric revelation, electric revelation
electric revelation, the saints of hellfire

7 heads, reign to cease, has been called
it's the march of the beast, the end is nigh - final trial
7 angels will appear from the sky
