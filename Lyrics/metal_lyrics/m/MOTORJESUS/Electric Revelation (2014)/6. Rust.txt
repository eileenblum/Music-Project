but i'm still running in the night, and i refuse to see it
off the track narrow and blind, and i can sense and feel it

another demon from the right, can't find the right direction
engines broken, but i see, one road and one solution

one smaller step, one giant leap, moving onward to the evidence
to proof it's not too late, to regain more of the confidence

what for is this life? more than just to steal away
to throw it all away

i'm awaiting, fight that disease
eternal highways, where the rust is inside me

when wheels are off, how can you run
to find the aim, the overdrive
black and the grey, dark and the light
my navigation denies me

trust in this machine
more than ever, it's the same
to come back once again

i'm awaiting ...

my engine, final release, eternal highways
where he's watching over me

tum around, turn over now - turn around, turn over now
in reverse, turn over now, turn around, turn over now

i'm awaiting ...

my engine, final release
eternal highways, where the rust is inside me
rust is inside me ...
