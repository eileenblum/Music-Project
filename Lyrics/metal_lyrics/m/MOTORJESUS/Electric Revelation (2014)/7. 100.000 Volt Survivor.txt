i'm the silent watchman, electric soul survivor
stronger than the lightning was
struck down i'm unforgiving

the curse, the one, i've seen the wreckage is done
the man, the edge, my justice forged with a sledge
i watch the world is coming down again

i am not, i'm the only one
don't hold it against me, i am not!
i am the only one!

break me - i will survive again
take me - i will arise
the 100,000 volt survivor

one bullet left for me, shot down but i'm still standing
you're cross that i must bear
but your cannot get your fuckin nails in

the shadow, the fear, it's always near, i watch it all
come down again

i am the only one! don't hold it against me!
i am not! i am the only one!

break me - i will survive again...

break me - i will survive again...

survivor, i will survive again
i'm the survivor
100,000 volt
