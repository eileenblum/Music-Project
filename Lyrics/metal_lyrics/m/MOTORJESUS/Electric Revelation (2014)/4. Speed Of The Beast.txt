now dissapear, recall my own
but for a glimpse the feeling gone, the mind is black
i'm a wreck, where's the sense in goin' on like this?

a part of me that never sleeps, and like a ritual, i'm never free
appear to loose, i refuse, to spend my life to follow forever

ever on it goes, this run is everlasting... running down below

i refuse - dare to lose, less is more
it appears out of the open fire, i renew - face the truth
i'm unleashed, accelerate with the speed of the beast

on a pursuit, that none has won
but it's the chase that's goin' on and on, the fuel is fear
challenge me, on the road to get reborn again

across the plains, the devil resigns, well at this nitro is a part of me 
you beg for war? i'm the law!
i'll crush you back to size,
you motherfucker

ever on it goes, this run is everlasting... running down below

i refuse - dare to lose...

i refuse - dare to lose...

the crown of thorns, the cross i bear
the sins inside of me, the saints and sinners
gather for the one that rises from the sea

the beast of seven horns and seven heads came over me
now that i'm unleashed,
accelerate with the speed of the beast
