In the seventh hour 
And creeping darkness in disguise
Beware of bullets, my gun will raise
The demons in my eyes

Turn the seventh eye and kill that bitch
Â´cause my handgun speaks a deadly language

Explode invader,
Hit the shattered flesh of fire
To cut the seven pieces from your bone
Right through the wire

You see the world is goinÂ´ to hell
You bleed for me, IÂ´ve got your heart
Burning the world and goinÂ´ to hell
Alright

Turn the seventh eye and kill that bitch
Â´cause my handgun speaks a deadly language

You see the world is goinÂ´ to hell
You bleed for me, IÂ´ve got your heart
Burning the world and goinÂ´ to hell

Turn the seventh eye and kill that bitch
Â´cause my handgun speaks a deadly language
