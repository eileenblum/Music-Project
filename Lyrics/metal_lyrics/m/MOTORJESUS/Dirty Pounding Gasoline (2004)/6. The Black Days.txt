A useless narrow space
A life left in disgrace
Another world is coming down
IÂ´s put to an end

Restore, annihilate
Forgotten and betrayed
No sounds are beckoning here

Corrupted and betrayed
Walked through the soil I ate
Those empty words mean everything
And IÂ´m swallowing hostility

While I was taken away
I canÂ´t give anything
Nothing more to say

I never gazed at the black below
Breathing fire, swim against the flow
Here to cleanse the soul

Inside captivity
Fear built facility
Corrupted point of origin
The source of all, thatÂ´s where IÂ´m in

Hiding inside second skin
Disguised from anyone
Avoid anything

I never gazed at the black below
Breathing fire, swim against the flow
All mistakes IÂ´ve done

I am hiding the depths today
Watching black fires burn away
In my own black hole

I never gazed at the black below
Breathing fire, swim against the flow
Here to cleanse the soul

I have left my identity
Inside here IÂ´m the enemy
