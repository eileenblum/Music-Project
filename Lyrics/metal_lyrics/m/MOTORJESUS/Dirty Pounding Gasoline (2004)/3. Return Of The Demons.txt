So you felt that shadows had returned
Keep breathing on the ground
Counting hours, but never be prepared
When the dead is walking round

Out of the light
DragginÂ´ you down
Where itÂ´s all bleeding
Bleeding for yourself

This is the return of the demons
It is the return, and all evil lives again
This is the return of the demons
Let your kingdom burn, all evil

Bringers of evil, separated from live
Still feel the burninÂ´ eye
Ressurrected, the demonÂ´s alive
Dark ones, fallen from the sky

Out of the Night
You hear them coming
Where itÂ´s all bleeding
Bleeding for yourself

This is the return of the demons
It is the return, and all evil lives again
This is the return of the demons
Let your kingdom burn, all evil

Felt the reaction with determination
Inside an existance of conspiracy

Bleeding for yourself

This is the return of the demons
It is the return, and all evil lives again
This is the return of the demons
Let your kingdom burn, all evil
