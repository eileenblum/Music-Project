Fastened belts, it will happen tonight
Prepare yourself for a hellride
Devils speakinÂ´, talkinÂ´ in tongues of angels
Smell some gasoline burn away
SoulÂ´s sold today

Hey devilman, are you still alive
Burn motors, hit the six-gear-drive
Chrome is shining on the edge of our lives
So burn the fuel from the inside
I will ignite

Ignited 
NitroÂ´s in my soul
Till I explode

Hit the ground on a desertland road 
Weed is feeding my nerves till the overload
A last breath, let the engines ignite
Prepare yourself for a hellride
Avoid the light

Ignited 
NitroÂ´s in my soul
Till I explode

Hey devilman, are you still alive
Burn motors, hit the six-gear-drive
Chrome is shining on the edge of our lives
So burn the fuel from the inside
I will ignite

Ignited 
NitroÂ´s in my soul
Till I explode

So, will I waste the day
IÂ´m the only fuel that burns away
