Night is reflecting all that iÂ´ve done
Here i am breathing far from the sun
Values, foundations, look what becomes
Long awaited second finally comes

It still feels like IÂ´m burning low
It still feels that IÂ´m burning slow

In disillusion, I refuse to see
The final hours come over me

It still feels like IÂ´m burning low
It still feels that IÂ´m burning slow

Forever broken down again
Feel free from all this pain

A broken mirror, destructionÂ´s at hand
The taste of a fear comes to an end
Extinction of humans, extinction of time
Shadows had lifted, perception is mine

Still feel IÂ´m burning low
It still feels like IÂ´m burning slow

Forever broken down again
In suffering and Pain

I never wanted
I never wanted to say
It takes a million miles to walk away

Still feel IÂ´m broken down again
Feel free from all this pain
Forever broken down again

Down again
