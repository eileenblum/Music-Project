Drifting on a frequency
At supersonic speed
Will we ride the rainbow
To the mars, where IÂ´m trying to breathe

Orbit in my hands, novasoul descends
To ride along the asteroids
Supersonic speed

All alone, heading for a space
In anti-gravity

Nebular streams and milky ways
Have become one with my veins
Till IÂ´m growing to godsize 
The sinner and his saints

Reverse polarity, turned to dust
To be your fuckinÂ´ spaceman
At your supersonic speed

All alone, heading for a space
In anti-gravity, the world belongs to me
All alone, heading for a space
In anti-gravity

Drifting on a frequency
At supersonic speed

All alone, heading for a space
In anti-gravity, the world belongs to me
All alone, heading for a space
In anti-gravity
In anti-gravity ...
