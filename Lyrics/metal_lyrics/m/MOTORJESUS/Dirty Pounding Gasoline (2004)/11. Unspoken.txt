Give fuel to my motor
Feed the engine with your fire
You will talk to no one
Ignite, explode and take me higher

In this shapeless form of nothing
Try to break me if IÂ´m wrong
Have to keep the doors wide open
In this room I donÂ´t belong

Now IÂ´ve got my number
I am locked inside my mind
Tell me what tomorrow knows
All the fragments that I find

If to die is to wake up again
Bleed for every word you say
Left these words unspoken
Oh, would you please just go away

You are the inside, I am the soul
You bleed for no one
Hell, and for nothing else
You are the inside, I am the soul
IÂ´m bound to no one
Hell, and to nothing else

In this shapeless form of nothing
Try to break me if IÂ´m wrong
Have you keep the doors wide open
In this room I donÂ´t belong

You are the inside, I am the soul
You bleed for no one
Hell, and for nothing else
You are the inside, I am the soul
IÂ´m bound to no one
Hell, and to nothing else
