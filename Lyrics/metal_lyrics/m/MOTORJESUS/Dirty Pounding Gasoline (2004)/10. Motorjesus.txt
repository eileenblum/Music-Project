What I said on television
That IÂ´m the one, whoÂ´s near divine
Got to pray, Â´cause god is my motor
And IÂ´m the one, whoÂ´s next in line

Would you like to be forgiven
For all the sins that you have done
Say your prayers on sunday morning
And absolution will be won

Will you see the dawning
Do you celebrate the end

HeÂ´s come to save our souls
HeÂ´s come to please us
Full throttle wheels of purgatory
Motorjesus
HeÂ´ll make us feel the fire
HeÂ´ll always tease us
The savior called 
Motorjesus

You can trust me, Â´cause IÂ´m a believer
The only savior for your soul
I will free you from this possession
Give sacrifice or lose control

Will you see the dawning
Do you celebrate the end

HeÂ´s come to save our souls
HeÂ´s come to please us
Full throttle wheels of purgatory
Motorjesus
HeÂ´ll make us feel the fire
HeÂ´ll always tease us
The savior called 
Motorjesus

You gotta give it all, absolution

Will you save my soul anymore
Motorjesus
