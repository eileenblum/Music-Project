Will you ever find the arise
All the superiors are trying to be
In this demise weÂ´ve been killing each other
No understanding words are left for me

IÂ´ve come to bring you bullets
Come to bring you the war
And no excuse is left for those who fear
Well, if you need this pressure
Go and kill anyone
The new superiorÂ´s about to be here

IÂ´ve come to bring you a bullet
ItÂ´s what youÂ´re asking for
IÂ´ve come to bring you a bullet
ItÂ´s what youÂ´re looking for

A new war, a new war
Is it just the end
Or is it what youÂ´re asking for
A new war, a new war
Is it just the end
Or is it what youÂ´re looking for

One day waking up and you see
That everybodyÂ´s lost their human creed
Now only blood, rage and hate will reign
ThereÂ´s no forgiveness
Â´cause you planted this seed

So go and burn down something
In this absence of light
All this irrational it seems to be real
Another body lies down
In a stream of blood
ThereÂ´s no forgiveness
We are breaking the seal

A new war, a new war
Is it just the end
Or is it what youÂ´re asking for
A new war, a new war
Buried in the grave
This is the way youÂ´re looking for
