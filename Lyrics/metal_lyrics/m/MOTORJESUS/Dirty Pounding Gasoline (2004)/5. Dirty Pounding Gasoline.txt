Bad gravitationÂ´s coming
WeÂ´re here to bring you nothing
And the bad news
Is the engineÂ´s running still

Infernal radiation,
Mindless extermination
No resistance
To the damage and the kill

This is the way, thatÂ´s why weÂ´re here
There is no time to disappear

The more I hate
The more IÂ´ve seen
ItÂ´s dirty pounding gasoline

Electric termination
small-minded generation
Spreading
All the evil inside me

It is the way, reality
Increasing immortality

The more I hate
The more IÂ´ve seen
ItÂ´s dirty pounding gasoline

Bad gravitationÂ´s coming
WeÂ´re here to bring you nothing

This is the way, thatÂ´s why weÂ´re here
There is no time to disappear

The more I hate
The more IÂ´ve seen
ItÂ´s dirty pounding gasoline

The more I hate
ItÂ´s in between
Dirty pounding gasoline
