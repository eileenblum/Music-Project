Drowning, raging
Electric devil lift my head up high
Sleepwalk, given a powertool
Let another shot of golddust fly

In mind, drifting
Spoke backwards as sent back in time
Spaces, staring blind
While infinityÂ´s getting mine

So, crashing sun is coming

Black light falling
Someone sells, someone sells it all away
Black light falling
Someone sells, someone sells

Fell on black days
Invite me with a scorpionÂ´s smile
Crashing from inside
Feel the dust that left me blind

Push me, hold on
Am I just a freak to everyone
Save me, holding on
Turn my face right to the sun

So, crashing sun is coming

Black light falling
Someone sells, someone sells it all away
Black light falling
Someone sells, someone sells 
my heart, my mind and in my soul

TheyÂ´re falling down
But weÂ´re still holding on
