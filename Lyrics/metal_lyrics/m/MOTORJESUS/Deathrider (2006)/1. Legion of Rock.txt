IÂ´m feeling sorry for your weakness - Stay in your own demise
Keep on lookinâ what this lifeÂ´s for - But electric unionÂ´s on the rise 

Stay in battle or be paralyzed - Or always try to be
Brotherhood of company - Forces of evil, watching me

So you never know - Rulers of the dead

This burning fire - Out of the sky
Where all the fallenÂ´ve gone before
Itâs in your head - Kings of the dead
A legion of rock, forevermore

SatanÂ´s reflection in the mirror - Crushing concrete walls
You can stay in apathy - Or you can burn it all 

So you never know - Rulers of the dead

This burning fire - Out of the sky
Where all the fallenÂ´ve gone before
Itâs in your head - Kings of the dead
A legion of rock, forevermore

This alliance, forevermore
Ainât this life worth dying for?
Stand in line, all for one
A viral smile, the race is on

So you never know - Rulers of the dead

This burning fire - Out of the sky
Where all the fallenÂ´ve gone before
Itâs in your head - Kings of the dead
A legion of rock, forevermore
