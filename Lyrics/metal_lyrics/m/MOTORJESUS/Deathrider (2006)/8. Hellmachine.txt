Black skies in cities of God - You never feel the pain
Can you feel youÂ´re trapped inside the machine

Free yourself with a bullet - When iÂ´m tryinÂ´ to scream
Is it all that you wanted - Stuck inside the in between

The walls of deceiving - The faith in believing

ItÂ´s all you want - CanÂ´t hear you scream
Inside this hellmachine - Is all you said dead in between
Inside this Hellmachine

I blessed the demons - Of the other side
Staring, receiving the pain - Try to find new power
Resurrection unwinds - All you never wanted
It is all inside my mind

Forgiveness you drown in -Backstabber becoming

ItÂ´s all you want - CanÂ´t hear you scream
Inside this hellmachine - Is all you said dead in between
Inside this Hellmachine

In here I am without protection And shadows everywhere
In here I stand burning and breathing - An unleashed reign of fear

ItÂ´s all you want CanÂ´t hear you scream
Inside this hellmachineIs all you said dead in between
Inside this Hellmachine

Inside this Hellmachine

Hellmachine
