Force the breakdown, death and change
Entering sledgehammer rage
Ravaged skies and concrete sight
Another demon at midnight

Ashes raining on that day 
Shout it out, donÂ´t walk that way
The ride of the dead man
Forever be alone

The ride 
Deathrider 

We cannot die, we only see
A lesson in demonology 
Burning fuse, caught up inside
A killing stream of dead light 

Always ashes on that day 
Realized, the reaperÂ´s me 
The ride of the dead man 
Forever be alone 

The ride 
Deathrider 

Today I will follow
Today I wonÂ´t bleed again 
Today, no tomorrow 
Today, the last day 

The ride of the dead man 
Forever be alone 
The ride of the dead man
Forever turn to stone 

The ride
Deathrider
