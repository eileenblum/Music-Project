In the sign of a full moon
Turning from human to lycanthrope
Unholy, changing
The curse of the wolf had become my doom

The evil inside of me
Takes over control of the human form
At midnight IÂ´m hiding
Every full circle to be reborn

Inside youÂ´ve always known
YouÂ´re standing alone
Inside youÂ´ve always known
It goes on and on

The howling, the howling
This is the night of the infected

Blood of the wolf 
Paralyzing, hunting in darkness from down below
Salvation, silver bullets
Rushed through the heart of the dying slow

Inside youÂ´ve always known
YouÂ´re standing alone
Inside youÂ´ve always known
It goes on and on

The howling, the howling
This is the night of the infected

Red eyes, watching
You fear, everlasting

The howling, the howling
This is the night of the infected
The howling, the howling
This is the crying of the wolf

The howling goes on
