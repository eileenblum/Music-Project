I should serve with a bullet
Conspiracy in my mind
No words, no forgiveness
Apart from your wounds, whereÂ´s the truth behind?

Ride along the planets
And rise from the sleep
Every thought is electric
No soul to reap

In quicksand IÂ´m falling
To disintegration, illumination

The distortion sleep
I am in too deep
ItÂ´s all in my mind
The distortion sleep
No more to keep

But I know

Inside the walls come closer
It is coming down
Realized in silence
ItÂ´s heavier to hold this crown

In quicksand IÂ´m falling
To disintegration, illumination

The distortion sleep
I am in too deep
ItÂ´s all in my mind
The distortion sleep
No more to keep

Enforceable, predictable 
To save yourself
To rise or fall
