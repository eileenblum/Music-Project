Dark is the day, that day they took my soul
A shadow, emotion, dig another hole
10 feet under dust, my crown lies here, isolation
Evershining through the loss I felt and frustration
A distant spark amidst the fires, but itÂ´s all long gone
While you stand and stare, 
I turned away, you have become 

A light in the sky
Asunder

The edge of our lives, cold shine through my eyes
The edge of the crown, the king I was
Now all is unbound, 10 feet under ground
To ashes it falls, just for the cause

It is unveiled between light and dark
All is sold away, the damned and torn apart
But we try to find a way inside this apathy
Seek for new beginnings, reignite it, now shall be
On this distant path I walk away apart from you
Release me finally, IÂ´m getting through

A light in my eyes
Asunder

The edge of our lives, cold shine through my eyes
The edge of the crown, the king I was
Now all is unbound, 10 feet under ground
To ashes it falls, just for the cause

Just for the cost
10 feet under ground ...
