Cold is the grave, still alive where you lay
Ressurected from out of the cold
You got to see on this cemetery
YouÂ´ve been held by the shadow of old

Alive no more
Bleeding no more

In your eyes, no disguise
DonÂ´t fear no evil
Here inside, killing light
DonÂ´t fear no evil

Heaven is lie, but you try to unwind
Every thought, it is gone in the end
Haunting the night, seek for blood
To remind and the greed in control is at hand 

Alive no more
Bleeding no more

In your eyes, no disguise
DonÂ´t fear no evil
Here inside, killing light
DonÂ´t fear no evil

All youÂ´ve never known
All youÂ´ve ever felt
Evershining dead walks still 
All forever damned
All is broken down
Driven by the lifeless will

In your eyes, no disguise
DonÂ´t fear no evil
Here inside, killing light
DonÂ´t fear no evil
