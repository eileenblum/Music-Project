IÂ´m seeing you today
DonÂ´t know where I was going
I just want you to see it all my way

It throws me off the tracks
And I still grin and bear it
Now all my memories are left for me

So I will fall
IÂ´m sleeping
This pain is everlasting
This sleep is never-ending

I realize 
All in your eyes
I am awaking 
All those I see 
Affecting me
The undertaken

All words are spoken now
IÂ´m bound within this game
IÂ´m dying down inside
Every single day

So I will fall
IÂ´m sleeping
This pain is everlasting
This sleep is never-ending

I realize 
All in your eyes
I am awaking 
All those I see 
Affecting me
The undertaken
