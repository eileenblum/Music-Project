Destination, eyes of Lucifer
Seven circles of hell no more

A new creation of GodÂ´s termination
Your blood is freezing, the speed of night

Riding, riding ... the speed of night

Into damnation
Black fuel domination
I am creation
Black fuel domination

Purgatory, darkness is unbound
Waiting under the hallowed ground

Thereâs no escaping, devil awaiting
Descend to the void, screaming inside

Riding, riding ... the speed at night

Into damnation
Black fuel domination
I am creation

Black fuel domination
The fire in the sky
The ways of the savior 
So youÂ´re gonna die

Riding, riding ... 

Into damnation
Black fuel domination
I am creation
Black fuel domination

Dominate
