It keeps running out of hand
Beneath the crimson skies
Die alone with your back on the ground
Bleed in worldÂ´s demise 

Running onward to termination
When itâs killing me 
Running onward into despair
So keep on dying on your knees

So run in the fire
Everything is everything
I am the destroyer
Everything, apart from me, is everything

Purgatory awaiting, 600 degrees
Hellfire hollowness
Itâs a fuckinÂ´ disease

Running onward to termination
When itâs killing me
Waiting, slowly, to rot away
So keep on dying on your knees

So run in the fire ...

So youâre waiting to crush your soul in two
Get down ...!

So keep on dying on your knees

So run in the fire
Everything is everything
I am the destroyer
Everything, apart from me, is everything
IÂ´m the destroyer ...
... is anything ...
