IÂ´m the king of radiation, iron, hard as steel
IÂ´m the man of brick and stone thatÂ´s caught inside the wheel
Seeing nothing new inside my kingdom borderlined
In this world IÂ´m beholding this war inside my mind

Determination
IÂ´m the unholy one

Now I understand
Pieces in my hand
Everything I am, IÂ´m the invisible man
Shed the skin today
Give it all away
I am, IÂ´m the Invisible man

No return from what your heading for 
And peace is not in sight
But it doesnÂ´t harm me anymore 
This shine, destructive light
Hammer pounding nail, my freedom, Every single word
Finally the solutionÂ´s here By digginÂ´ in the dirt

Determination
IÂ´m the unholy one

Now I understand
Pieces in my hand
Everything I am, IÂ´m the invisible man
Shed the skin today
Give it all away
I am, IÂ´m the Invisible man

IÂ´m the Invisible man
