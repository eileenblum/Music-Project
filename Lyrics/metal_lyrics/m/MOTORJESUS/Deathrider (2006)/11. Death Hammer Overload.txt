Eliminate 
Black thunderbolt
When all the shitpiles
Turn to gold

So violate
Red Lucifer
Beholding trouble
Starting the war

I know - Death Hammer Overload
Violate - Death Hammer Overload

Give it to me

Every time you have come
YouÂ´re absorbing my power
Dislocated I am 
And collapsing inside

Damage the nerves
Distort in vain

I know - Death Hammer Overload
Violate - Death Hammer Overload

No flame or hellride, given me
No six gear drive could bring me clarity
