I Saw You There
Crying in the Night
Don't Ask Me Why
I Told You Long Ago
The World's Done You Wrong Again
So What's New
Where Do You Stand
What Are You Gonna Do

Will There Ever Be Any Harmony
It Doesn't Really Seem That Safe to Me

Caught Up in the Middle of a Breakdown
Can't You See There's a Price for Freedom
Caught Right in the Middle of a Breakdown
Find Another Way

You Spent a Long Time Getting Used
Taking More than Your Share of Abuse
It's Hard to Run Away
Realize You Have to Play the Game

Will There Ever Be Any Harmony
It Doesn't Really Seem That Safe to Me
When the Problems Start
You've Got to Move On
Nothing Can Save You
From Taking the Fall
