Unusual as They Were
Those Times I'll Never Forget
And Through All
The Forgotten Words
I've Seen Things
I Live to Regret

And I Guess It's Just the Way
The Way Things Work Out
And the Solitary
Way I Feel Inside

I Want You to Know
I'm Far Away
But I Can't Disguise the Pain
So Hard to Know Just Where to Start
When Things Fall Apart

I See a Face
That Hides a Story
Of a Life That's Ever Fading
A Lost Emotion Carved in Time
A Stone
That Weathers Stormy Skies

And There's Something
In the Reasons
The Reasons I'm Alive
And I Need to Get Back Now
And I Guess It's Just the Way
The Way Things Work Out
And the Solitary Way I Feel Inside
