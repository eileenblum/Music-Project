Can't You See
I Try to Understand
It's Not the Way
It Used to Be
I've Come to Realize
It Was Just an Illusion
You've Taken Pleasure
In Watching This Demise

Don't Know Who Would Trust Me
'Cause I've Been Hurt
Too Many Times
And in My Hour of Need
Will You Be Around

I Don't Need Your Promises
Just Empty Words
Living in a Heart of Stone
I Don't Need Your Promises
For What It Worth
You Can Find Me
Headed Down the Road

Memories
Always with Me
A Prisoner of My Fears
If I Open My Heart
Can I Remain Here
A True Believer
The Words Seem So Sincere

Don't Know Who Can Trust Me
I've Been Hurt
Way Too Many Times
And in My Hour of Need
Will You Be Around
