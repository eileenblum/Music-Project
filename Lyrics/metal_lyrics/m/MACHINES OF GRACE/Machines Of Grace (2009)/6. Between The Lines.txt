You Know It's Easy
To Accept What Is Given
Reach Out Your Hands
Force Your Right to Live
Got to Walk
Right Through Inhibitions
Who Really Wants to Know
What's Going on

And We May Never Know
What That One Good Reason Is
And When the Truth Is Told
Will We Lose Our Innocence

Between the Lines
Everything You Can't Explain
Between the Lines
Everything You Could Never Face
Life Is Hard
It Ain't Gonna Change
Read Between the Lines

I Know
You Took Me Away
And I Felt the Pain
I Could Have Stayed
But I Left No Trace
It's No Wonder
The Days of the Torture
Are Soon to Be Over
