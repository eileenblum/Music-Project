I Can't Face the Morning
Another Night Takes Me into the Light
You Left Me Here
Alone with My Pain Again
Such a Cruel Device

Why Is This Love So Cold
Is It a Waste of Time
In the End There's Nobody There

I Just Don't Know Myself Anymore
The Pain Comes Down on Me
Let Me Bleed
Let Me Bleed
Don't Know Myself Anymore
No Way to Help Me See
Just Let Me Bleed

Nothing Lasts Forever
Those Fatal Words
I Thought Would Never Come Between Us
This Time You Play the Stranger
I'll Play the Fool
Save Your Anger
I've Got Nothing More to Lose

Why Is Our Love So Cold
It Tears My Heart Can't Take No More
Why Must I Stay Here Getting Old
Is It a Waste of Time
In the End There's Nobody There
