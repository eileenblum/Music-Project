Don't You Worry
It's Not Out in the Open Yet
You've Got Nothing to Hide
But the Truth
And We Don't Really
Need That Anyway
It's a Power Game

You Could Never Read My Mind
It Was Never Meant to Be
Looking to Find
What You Can't See

I Don't Want to Know the Future
Keep It to Yourself
Things Happen for a Reason
I Don't Want to Feel the Pressure
Tell Me Life Is Just a Game
And I'll Keep Playing On

Talk to Me
So You Can Tell Me
What I Wanna Hear
And Then It's Over
We Know the Song
Although the End's Near
Looking for the One Thing
Who's Gonna Take Some Chances

I Don't Want to Know the Future
Keep It to Yourself
Things Happen for a Reason
I Don't Want to Feel the Pressure
Tell Me Life Is Just a Game
And I'll Keep Playing On
