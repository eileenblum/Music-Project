You Can't Deny It
The Truth It Lies
It's Finally Coming Together
Now You Can Leave It All Behind

You're Walking Around
Wondering Why
You Let It Go
Will We Ever Know
You'r Still Alive
Have You Returned
From Your Dark World

But You're Psychotic
You're Psychotic

The World Is Changing
So Much for Reason
Seems You Are Starting Over
So Many Dreams
Still Undiscovered

Through Your Disguise
Taking a Step
Beyond the Grave
Could Your Soul Survive
Consider This Time
You Could Be the Same
As Anyone

But You're Psychotic
You're Psychotic
