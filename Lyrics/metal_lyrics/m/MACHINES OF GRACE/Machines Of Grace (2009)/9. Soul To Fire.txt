Somewhere Out of the Past
The Blade That Left
These Scars Inside Me
Forever Will Bleed
Slow Death
It Happened So Fast
Eternity Is Filled with Loneliness
From Light to Darkness

Pleasure and Pain
To the Grave
Please Forgive Me When I Say

You Take My Soul to Fire
Put It in the Hands of a Liar
You Take My Soul to Fire
Don't Try to Run
You Know Your Time Will Come

Come in on a Bed of Roses
Leaving with All Your Burning Secrets
Taking All You Can Get
You Brought the Sinner Out of the Saint
That's the Price You Paid
To Leave Your Mind
For the Unholy Kind

Pleasure and Pain
To the Grave
Please Forgive Me
Taking Me Down
In Your Name
I Feel No Shame
But I Feel the Pain
