Another Misty Morning
Sometimes I Don't Know If I'll Make It Through
Somehow I Wound Up Here
I Woke Up from Reality
Don't Know What to Do

I'm Hoping This Loneliness
Won't Chase Me Around Much Longer
I'm Going Away
Where I Can Be Much Stronger

I'm Hoping the World Will See
There's Somehting More
Out There for Me
Leaving Means Nothing Now
It Only Becomes What You Believe
In Those Better Days

The Feeling's Right This Morning
I Think That Something's Gonna Make
A Change Today
Been a Long Time
I'm Ready It's Time for a Better Way
Tired of Wasting Time Away

I'm Hoping the World Will See
There's Somthing More
Out There for Me
Leaving Means Nothing Now
It Only Becomes what You Believe
It's Never the Same
I'm Hoping for a Better Day
Looking for Better Days
