Another Day Has Passed Me By
Another Wind Has Carried Me Away
Now I Sit and Wonder
Will It Ever Be the Same Again

I've Spent a Lifetime
Searching Everywhere
For Some Peace of Mind
To Feel the Way That I Did
With You Again

This Time
Won't It Feel Like You Want It to
This Time
Won't It Feel Right

Another Day Approaching Night
Every Minute
I Feel You Closer
I Just Need to Hold You So Bad
Don't Know If I Can Control My Emotions

I've Spent a Lifetime
Searching Everywhere
For Some Peace of Mind
To Feel the Way That I Did
With You Again

This Time
Won't It Feel Like You Want It to
This Time
Won't It Feel Right
Won't It Feel Right This Time
We Got to Keep It Together
Every Day, Every Night
We Gotta Find a Way
