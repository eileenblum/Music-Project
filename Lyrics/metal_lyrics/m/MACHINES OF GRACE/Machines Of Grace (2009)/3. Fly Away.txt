Damage from the Years of Living
She Tried So Hard to Be Forgiven
Cuts So Deep They Couldn't Save Her
Laying Dreams Upon the Altar
But You Can't Remeber

All Her Little Babies
Got Lost Along the Way

Fly Away, on wings of an Angel
Fly Away, from All the Tears
Fly Away, from the Pain of Freedom's Sin

Passed Away
Escaped from Sadness
No One Cried
Dust to Blackness
Finally Free She Is Gone
Safe at last But Still Alone
Escaped from Her Darkest Shadows

All Her Little Babies
Got Lost Along the way
What's Left of Tomorrow
All the Things she Needed
Passed Before Her Eyes
Living Selfish Lies

Fly Away, on wings of an Angel
Fly Away, from All the Tears
Fly Away, from the Pain of Freedom's Sin
Fly Away, Fly Away Leave Today
Nothing Is Standing in your Way
