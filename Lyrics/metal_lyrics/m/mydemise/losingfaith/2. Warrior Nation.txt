Steadfast surrounding every side
There is nowhere left to hide
If I have to give my life
There is no better way to die

Their lines advancing infantry
A storm is rising deep in me
I cannot wait to spill their blood
There's no such thing as dignity
The demons they take hold of me
Blood thirst aggression enemy
I am the one you fear and scorn
I am hate in its purest form

They come like tidal waves
Bringing us to our graves
Defending all we are
See through our battle scars
This is our final stand
Blood strewn across the sand
As brothers we stand tall
Only to lose it all

I stand my ground
Hear the sound
I'm ready to die more than ever
There is so much left to see
But there's no need to pray
There is no peace with God
Only the war I've fought

There is no calm before the storm
All I have ever known is war
Look into my eyes I bear no remorse
The silence following their screams
Has never left me in my dreams
I watched their mother weep and left them to die

They come like tidal waves
Bringing us to our graves
Defending all we are
See through our battle scars
This is our final stand
Blood strewn across the sand
As brothers we stand tall
Only to lose them all

I will not die
We will rise
My brothers will stand by my side
So close but still so far
The cracks are where we crawl
And when their kingdoms fall
We'll paint their blood across the walls

Fuck them all

Arise arise arise armies of the dark
Destroy destroy destroy foundations built by man
Kill them kill them kill all those who disobey
Slaughter slaughter slaughter the ones who betray

Glory shall be mine

Forget what I've been told
The truth is here behold
It's time to do what's right
