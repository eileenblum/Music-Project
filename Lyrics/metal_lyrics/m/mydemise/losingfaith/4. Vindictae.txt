This is what I've become
This is what I live for
There is nothing better
This is what I will die for
You witness the changes
I notice the weakness
What was is now what is me
You'll never know what I am

Fall away from me into a sky
A sky turned to ash
Free my mind from all the ones
Who try to hold me down

Know this, I'll never come back
You took what was left inside
My life my heart my mind
And you stood and watched me die
I'll wait by the gates of hell
I'll burn your rotting flesh
The truth has surfaced now
Before me you will bow

Fall away from me into a sky
A sky turned to ash
Free my mind from all the ones
Who try to hold me down

I've come I'm the reaper
Cast down unleash my demons
Look now at what I've done
Unleash my hate upon you

Coward open your eyes
Shut the fuck up I'll make you suffer

Watch you suffer
In vain you suffer
In shame you suffer
Vindictae

Fall away from me into a sky
A sky turned to ash
Free my mind from all the ones
Who try to hold me down
