Come inside as my heartbeat slows
My mind resides here with my faith in tow
Question all I know as I die
All I've ever known is a lie

All are damned to hell
Locked inside a cell
Screamed his name as we fell
Holding on is all I have

There are no consequences
But everything you do comes with a price
Savoring the moments with you before we go
This weight is too much to bear
This happens every time
Those moments when I seem to close my eyes
Promise me you'll wait until the very end
I'll never open them again

This pain is all we know
The hate of this world will never go away
We always fail to see what we truly have

All are damned to hell
Locked inside a cell
Screamed his name as we fell
Believing was our first mistake

We will destroy this place
As long as we can't come to terms
But if our cause is fake then what do we have to live for
Nothing is sacred
Fill the space with our gods and idols
Missing what's truly the point
Hate and shame have shaped what we've all come to know
We can retrace our steps for what is right

Fall into void of sorrow
Can't recall my name
Can't decide where my faith lies
Into my eyes the knife will go
Bury lost values hear the screams watch the tears fall

This pain is all we know
The hate of this world will never go away
We always fail to see what we truly have

Blood-red sun we are so young and from our tongues come blistering words
We fall
We are the ones who're losing faith
We are so young
Come blistering words
We are the ones who're losing faith

Your world dies
My demise
Kiss the sky
My demise
Fuck

This pain is all we know
The hate of this world will never go away
We always fail to see what we truly have

Blood red sun we are so young and from our tongues come blistering words
We fall
We are the ones who're losing faith
We are so young
Come blistering words
We are the ones who're losing faith
