[feat. Caleb Myers]This is My Demise

The time has come to reinvest your putrid soul
Hatred blood and wretched filth will finally unfold
Taste my rage

Count your blessings hold them dear as you await your fate
Fucked up dreams I'm fucked inside embrace eternal hate
Suffer what's brought upon yourself

This is the last time I will ever see you through
Locked inside with candle lights I slam the door shut without remorse
There's nothing you could ever say and nothing you could do
My heart is black I turn my back
This world will never need you

You're suffocating me
All those nights I stayed away to finally make you see
Deep inside these scars across my chest

For the last time you'll be put to sleep
This is as much as I can take
Death to life is so fucking beautiful

Your heart was in my hands
I gave you all I had
But still you took more than you ever asked

Know our name

Call upon your savior
But I'm the one you'll bow before now

You've taken everything from me
Given nothing back
Now it's my turn to turn your world to black
An empty being is all that's fucking left

I will consume you
You cry in vein to the sky
The last thing you'll ever see are my bloodshot eyes
You've lost your final stand

Your heart was in my hands
I gave you all I had
But still you took more than you ever asked
