I see right through mankindâs hideous lies
Telling the world you're not afraid to die
You listen here bitch I'll only say this once
You better run from me your sins will consume you
You can't evade this hellish fate you've chosen
To rot your life away condemning the broken
To be someone you're not to get to the top
This is the end for you your time is up

What does tomorrow hold
Nothing's gonna change unless the people change their ways
Nothing's gonna change unless the people change their ways

I'd rather die than pretend what you pretend to be
Your chains of spite will bring you to your knees
You will suffer the consequences
And pay in hell for your past offenses
Can't you see that everything you've done will come back to haunt you in this life or the next one
Your pride blinds you, but you will watch as we rise from the ash and fight until we have won

In the eyes of my weakness

What does tomorrow hold
Nothing's gonna change unless the people change their ways
Nothing's gonna change unless the people change their ways

We will show this world who they're fucking with
They're fucking with
Who you're fucking with

What does tomorrow hold
Nothing's gonna change unless the people change their ways
Nothing's gonna change unless the people change their ways
