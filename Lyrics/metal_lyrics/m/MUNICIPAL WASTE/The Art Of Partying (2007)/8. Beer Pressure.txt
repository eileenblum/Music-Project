I stare at these drinks here before me
And everything else just seems lame
It feels like they're calling out to me
And I just can't hold my restraint

Feel the pressure!
There's just one cure

Pour us a round pass that shit down
Drinking these beers till we're nice and unwound

Drunk with my friends
It never ends
Looks like beer pressure has got us again

Race till it's gone
Finish the glass
We're getting drunk and we're doing it fast

We like to fall all over ourselves
We like to drink and we do it quite well

We have tried
We failed
Beer pressure's taking over
Death to being sober!

I stare at these drinks here before me
And everything else just seems lame
Feel the pressure!
There's just one cure

Beer Pressure!
You got it now
Beer pressure!
Now drink it down (yow!)
