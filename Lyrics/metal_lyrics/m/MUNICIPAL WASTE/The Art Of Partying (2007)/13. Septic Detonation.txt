Run for cover the commode is about to explode
There is nothing you can do covered in number 2
Everywhere you try to hide reeks of your backside

It won't stop till the town is covered in a shitty brown
The smell is making people faint because it is so fucking rank

Detonation!
The septic detonation

The cops can do nothing and everyone's running
There is panic and screaming the culprit is laughing

Because he knows he'll never get caught
Not safe from his sick and evil thoughts
A plan that will bring you misery
Made sure his shit is all you can see

So try to never cross his path
You might might end up reeking of ass
The charges all have been set to make a day you won't forget!

Detonation!
The septic detonation

Because he knows he'll never get caught
Not safe from his sick and evil thoughts
A plan that will bring you misery
Made sure his shit is all you can see

Detonation!
