No time to wait around today
Lets get fucked up its time to rage
A couple of parties up the street
Bare witness to a drunken fleet
I begin to stumble down the hall
I spot a keg and I want it all
I want it all

Let's have a round
Let's drink this keg till it's zero pounds
Does this beer taste kind of strange?
As things begin to quickly fade
I get the feeling something is wrong
Something is wrong

At first it seemed all normal some guys in a fight
But looking closer something is not right
The blood began to splatter the violence quickly spreads
Something fucked up was put in that keg!

Violence
Door to door
Disfigured and we declare war!
Panic
We're maniacs our legions grow with every attack!

Somehow were chemically altered
Some kind of reaction making us stronger
A plague with no mercy we spread
We'll never give up till everyone's slaughtered

Somehow were chemically altered
Some kind of reaction making us stronger
A plague with no mercy we spread
We'll never give up till everyone's slaughtered

Our fight to end humanity is spreading out into the streets
Setting fires, slicing cops
Our lust for blood will never stop
