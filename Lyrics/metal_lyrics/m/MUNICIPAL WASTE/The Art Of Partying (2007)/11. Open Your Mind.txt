Guess it's hard to comprehend thing with your tiny brain
I guess it will take longer for me to try to explain
I figured that my actions would probably explain myself
I should have spoken slower when I said rot in hell
So I'll explain the following as detailed as I can
My patience has been wearing thin so try to understand

I guess you thought I wanted peace
Well I didn't mean to mislead
My point just did not come across
Somehow the whole meaning was lost
What I meant to say just might hurt
But my intensions are far worse
The confusion of my strange advice
Can be solved in just one simple slice
Mistook me trying to enlighten
But now you're just trembling and frightened
I guess you just can't comprehend
So I'll just say it once again!

Open your mind
It's about time
Let's see your head split and throbbing with slime

Open your mind
Open your nose
Suck on a chainsaw till your head explodes

Open your mind
Bash through your crown
Never give up until blood's swirling around

Open your mind
Now is the time I told you I want you to open your mind!

Huge pipe of lead
Pushed right through your head
Use a knife or snowplow
Shove it in. Rip it out.
Feel it break through your scalp
Shove it in. Rip it out!

I guess you thought I wanted peace
Well I didn't mean to mislead
My point just did not come across
Somehow the whole meaning was lost
What I meant to say just might hurt
But my intensions are far worse
The confusion of my strange advice
Can be solved in just one simple slice
Mistook me trying to enlighten
But now you're just trembling and frightened
I guess I'll say it one more time
I told you I want you to open your mind
