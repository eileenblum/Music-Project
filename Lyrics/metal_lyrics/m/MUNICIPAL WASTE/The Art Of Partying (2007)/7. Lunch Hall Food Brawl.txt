Here at lunch hour at Municipal High
We'll see something over the edge
This school is about to see more things crash
Then when you first failed Drivers Ed

Everybody that's inside will be caught in the fight

First somebody screams
Then food begins to fly
Milk cartons raised forward toward the sky

The room quickly erupts
It cannot be controlled
The brawl suddenly begins to explode

Soldiers from all grades choose sides
Combat has begun. Who will survive?
Teachers run in fear fleeing the hall
No one can escape the food brawl

Refreshments become ammunition
The tables is your only cover
There's shit all on your favorite shirt
Now somebody's gonna suffer

First somebody screams
Then food begins to fly
Milk cartons raised forward toward the sky

Soldiers from all grades choose sides
Combat has begun. Who will survive?
Teachers run in fear fleeing the hall
No one can escape the food brawl

It rains condiments and the floor runs slick
With Wednesdays special lunch dish
The jocks are cornered and the principal is a goner
As the faculty looks on in horror

Those who oppose will fall
The lunch hall food brawl!
