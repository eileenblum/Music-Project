Our cannons have more strength than yours
Our weapons take more lives than yours
Our soldiers are obsessed with gore

Accepting of the hand were dealt
We kill until there's nothing left
And we just want you to melt

Strength pride obsessed
We kill until there's nothing left
And when they're dead your ass is next!

We spit our beer upon your corpse
Without the slightest of remorse
With radioactive force!

No resistance to our radioactive force
We march until everything is scorched

Tired of the things you've done
Time is up no place to run
Streets run red with you blood

Fueled by our toxic thirst
You haven't even seen the worst
Decimating every church

This town melts down
So does everything around
Victory's a mushroom cloud

And when it's done and nothings left
And your whole planet stinks of death
That's when we'll finally take a rest

The decimation of civilization is coming today
All is dead: punish the earth, march on the graves
Total destruction
Breathe in the air

Two worlds collide
All devastation through radiation
Everyone dies!

Our cannons have more strength than yours
Our weapons take more lives than yours
Our soldiers are obsessed with gore

We spit our beer upon your corpse
Without the slightest of remorse
With radioactive force!

No resistance to our radioactive force
We march until everything is scorched

The decimation of civilization is coming today
All is dead:punish the earth,march on the graves
Total destruction
Breathe in the air
