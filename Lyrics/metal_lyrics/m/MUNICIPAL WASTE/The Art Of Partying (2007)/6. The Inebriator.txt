Raging to a level of inebriated bliss
Pounding to the speed of the metal with our fists
Relentless is the force crushing through the earth's domain
Beer shoots down your throat while it's punishing your brain

Can you survive the ultimate chug?
Or will you choke then puke on the rug?
Or will you last this beer-bonging task?
Intoxicate!
For the final blast

Inebriate it's the way to go we never want to drink it slow!

Fucked up at top speed we got us a tool
Leaving you pissed in a puddle of drool

It's claimed many lives but not yours yet
One step in its path you're going to be next
Now drop to one knee, your mouth to the tube
Just tilt your head back and just wait for the spew!

Blast's through the chest
It pounds through your gut
It rips through your skin
You're getting tore up!

Your stomach flies open
It splat's to the floor
Another victim
The Inebriator!

Inebriate it's the way to go we never want to drink it slow!
Inebriate it's the way go!

Raging to a level of inebriated bliss
Pounding to the speed of the metal with our fists
Relentless is the force crushing through the earth's domain
Beer shoots down your throat while it's punishing your brain

You can't survive one thing is for sure
Another victim!
The Inebriator!
