My thoughts run wild until your family found
My focus is set on bringing you down
You know what you said we felt all of your lies
Now I'm fed up and now you must die

I won't stop because I don't care
And this hatred has brought me here to stay
I will wait to pounce and then I'll burn
Your whole world down so you will learn
To rid your head of stupid thoughts
That made you think that you got off
And sure enough just wait and see
The end of what's tormenting me will soon be here
You in my grasp and killing you is my only task

This vengeance!
My torment is ending today
Just one swift move of the blade
The only thing to set my mind free
It's only moments away

My time has come
Your time is up
No resistance is strong enough
Don't try to sell me promises that you can't keep
You'd be better off it you don't even speak
Your screams are all I want to hear
My will is strong
My vengeance fierce
The web that you spun led me down this twisted path
I'll stare at your corpse and do nothing but laugh

This vengeance!
My torment is ending today
Just one swift move of the blade
The only thing to set my mind free
It's only moments away
