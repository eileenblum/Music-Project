Now it's time we raise the stakes
And thrash this town we fuckin' hate
Your beer prices are way to high
Sell it cheap or fucking die!
Doormen don't charge us
Cause they're scared that we'll charge them
We'll leave 'em dead and twitching
I couldn't help but notice that the band I came to see
Was playing to the speed of Kenny G
A trail of victims in my wake
Crushing skulls till faces break
Another night with the Waste
Ungodly scene of guts and beer
Bloody faces stiff with fear
We only play the fast shit here!
THRASH!
Don't mind if I do
Storm of pain-troops of thrash
Four (chill) dudes that will whip your ass
Sites are set-now it's time
Thrash out of your mind!
Thrash don't mind if I do!
