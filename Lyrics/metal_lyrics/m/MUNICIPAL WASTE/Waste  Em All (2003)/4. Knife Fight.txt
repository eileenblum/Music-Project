Ome s;ashers fate to rule the streets
A game of death he must compete
A piercing blade to the throat
Will end the terror the knife invoked
An unknown soldier drew the line
A mark of death he soon would find
In a twist of fate he could prevail
A game of bloodshed
That one would fail
Falling to the pavement
Blade in hand
One survivor
ONE DEAD MAN
Ending all hope of compromise
The fight is over when one man dies
His blade struck fast with thrashing might
Sending death, his chance was slight
A splatter of red in the black of night
Blood on the street
The deadly knife fight!
