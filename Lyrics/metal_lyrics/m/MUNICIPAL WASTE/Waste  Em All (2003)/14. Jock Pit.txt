Sick of the normal dances that the people bring to shows
It's time to start the new shit that the kids don't even know
Dust off your white hate
Tuck in your polo shirt
It's time to start the new dance craze
That's really gonna hurt
Last one standing in the jock pit rules!
The most violent emo show that I've ever seen
Was when the Waste dressed like frat guys and destroyed everything!
Ripping our shirts off and thrashing around
Kicked out of places all over the town
Next time you're bored and
Theresa show it's time to fucking rock
Put on some real nice clothing and start thrashing like a jock
Busting heads chipped tooth smiles
No one cares we're going wild
Everybody's bleeding while the jock pits spinning round
Last one standing in the jock pit rules
