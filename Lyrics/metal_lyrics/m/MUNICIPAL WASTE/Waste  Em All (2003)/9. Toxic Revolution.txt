Rising from the streets
Screams of pain --- the sewers heat
Something's here to kill you
It's under your nose
The sounds of destruction
And here show it goes
Underneath the sewer
Lies an ever flowing stream
Of toxic revolution
To destroy everything!
Look and see the scorched earth
Look into the sky
The Waste is fucking coming
Better kiss your ass goodbye
Violent revolutions is circling around
Churches and police stations burnt to the ground
WASTE THE FLAG --- EAT THE DEADSTREETS
SLIME GREEN --- SEAS BLOOD RED
Toxic youth will rise and claim this world
Once and for all!
