I guess I'm a lightweight
It hasn't been this bad before
I'm positive I've handled worse I'm sure
I'm under the influence of a person place and thing
And figured out how much a mess I've been

I have a low tolerance
For everything you put me through
I have a low tolerance for you
I have a low tolerance
For everything you've said and done
And now all tolerance is gone

My face turns red
Everything spins
It's building up
It's coming back again
