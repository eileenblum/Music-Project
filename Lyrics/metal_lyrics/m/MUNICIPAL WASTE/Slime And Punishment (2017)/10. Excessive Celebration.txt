We may not watch sports but our team always wins
Accumulates points through a number of sins
Our over excitement may cause some to frown
Which doesn't distract us from burning things down
So please take discretion before tagging in
You may find yourself in a word full of shit

We're gonna finish this the way we want
Excessive celebration
Were gonna win whether you're pro or con
Excessive celebration
In spite of your disapproval of expression
Where the champs of god knows what
Excessive celebration

Well see to ourselves that we will find the door
But after we leave you may have to fix it
Things may look different than before
From an aftermath of excessive exit
