It happened again
My life attracts these difficulties
Forced frustrations

I'm wrapped up again
Pushed down into these
Dingy situations

It's just getting darker
Breath in the dust
Temperature rises

The walls moving closer
The filth gets thicker
The dinginess widens

It happened again
It keeps on happening repetitively
Conversations

No way back
No release from these
Dingy situations

It's just getting darker
Breath in the dust
Temperature rises

The walls move closer
The filth gets thicker
The dinginess widens

No way out, it's in my head
Instant thoughts are filled with dread
Its seems to be a lost
Cause a fight I always fought
Just when I think its passed it's not
