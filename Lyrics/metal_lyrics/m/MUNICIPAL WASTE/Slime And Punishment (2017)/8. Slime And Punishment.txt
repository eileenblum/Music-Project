You've been sentence and you don't even know
Received your judgement and you haven't a clue
With no idea of whats to come
Your whole world is going down
You'll get the sentence that we know you deserve

Slime and punishment
And that's all your going to get
Slime and punishment

No more leaving through the back door
Judgement day's arrived
No more excuses, no more here
Through with your lies

It isn't over until we say it's done
We'll make sure there's pain to come
You'll get the sentence we know you deserve
