This time you think you've won
Convincing everyone
You've got the master key
An answer to everything

This time you'll meet your end
Straight bourbon discipline
Maniacal laughter
The last thing you've heard

I got more patience than a hospital
But even now that waiting room's full
I held my tongue way longer
Than I thought I knew how
But now it's time we shut
This whole thing down

Grossly illogical
I guess anything is possible
And if I sit here a second
More longer I bet
These drinks will take over
And all will get wrecked

Patience's end
Bourbon discipline

It's like defusing a time bomb
Because I never really cared at all
And as these things start
To pile up the more time is spent
Imagining everything's
All came and went

No way to stop it all
Except a trip to the hospital
But the way things look
I can tell at a glance
You'll be the one
Leaving in the ambulance

Now that the time has passed
You've gone and met your match
Literally defaced
Handed your ass some place

Now you have met your end
Straight bourbon discipline
Maniacal laughter
The last thing you heard
