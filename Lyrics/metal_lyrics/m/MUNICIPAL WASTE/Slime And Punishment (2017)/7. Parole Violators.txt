The gavel hasn't fallen
I'm still free
On borrowed time
We'll wait and see

Let's not sit here and worry about the consequences
I think I'd rather cause more trouble and get ripped senseless

They let me get out to sort my affairs
Like it really matters
I'll never go back
Lets get out of here
Parole violators

And if they find me
Because I jumped parole
Back to the big house is where I'll go

So lets not waste time
And discuss where all the things went wrong
This just may be out last chance to destroy it all

Honestly do you think I really care?
My whole worlds been shattered
Nothing to gain
I'm getting out of here
Parole violators

They let me get out to sort my affairs
Like it really matters
I'll never go back
Lets get out of here
Parole violators
