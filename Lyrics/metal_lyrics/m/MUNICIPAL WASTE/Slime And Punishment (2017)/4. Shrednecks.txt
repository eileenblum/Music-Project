Pick up trucks
And fucked up vans
Messed up teeth
And ripped up pants

The last ones you call for a dinner date
But the first ones there to make your boring night great

We're a crew of shrednecks
We've come to do the job
Twist your head break backs
Were here to shred them all
We came here to shred necks
Like only we know how
Shred the necks of the crowd

We may not be
The most enlightened ones
But rest assured
We'll get the worst jobs done

Sick riff compositions and mass graves of beer
Leaves a harsh decimation of thousands of ears
Step aside
For you've been warned

We're a crew of shrednecks
We've come to do the job
Twist your head break backs
Were here to shred them all
We came here to shred necks
Like only we know how
Shred the necks of the crowd
