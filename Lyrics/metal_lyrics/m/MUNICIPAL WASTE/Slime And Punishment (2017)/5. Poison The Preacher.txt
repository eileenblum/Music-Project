Time for confession
But not from us
This time the vicar
Violated for lust
Led by temptation
For his acolytes
Molestation was
His dismal plight

He will pay
No sanctuary
Too late to pray

Poison the preacher
Taint all the wine
He's the mistreater
For all of mankind
Pollute the priest
Defile his shrine
Corruption runs the divine

Enter the chapel
Of the holy man
His parish will perish
By our own hand
Spilling the blood
In return for his sin
Victims of his acts
Will finally win

So give us this day
And he'll be dead
The heart of the minister
You'll be fed
Forgive us our debts
And meet our demands
Delivering evil
Is our only command

He will pay
No sanctuary
Too late to prey

Poison the preacher
Taint all the wine
He's the mistreater
For all of mankind
Pollute the priest
Defile his shrine
Corruption runs the divine

Poison the preacher
