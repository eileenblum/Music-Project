13. DEATH PROOF

It's white hot
White-hot terror
Full speed full on mad

It's a death trap
And you'll be released never
Or ripped from the jaws of death

Speed stalker
200 miles per hour
Steel and shattered glass

He's death proof
At least he thought this summer
Until he crossed these ladies path

This is the day
That proved to be a success
A stalkers delight
A terrible bloody mess
Twisted carnage
Appearing as an accident
Perfectly planned
Diabolical degenerate

Hop in the car
The wrong turn
Tears roll down
Rubber burns

Speed through the dark
No time left
This is the end
This is their death

Flashing headlights
Straight through their eyes
Drenched in the glass
Limbs to the sky

One last thought
Goes through her head
Rolls through her brain
And stick to the tread

This is the day
Now many months have passed

Different girls
Equally just as bad

He waits to attack
They're out getting their kicks

Something goes wrong
And now they're all are stalking him!

Jumps out the car
She pulls out the gun
The tables have turned
The chase is on

The chump's out the car
The creeps met his match
There's no chance of turning back
