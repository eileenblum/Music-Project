Think fast

Think fast
You'll least expect
Think fast
Its coming quick
Think fast
It's in your face before you even realize it

Think fast
Don't miss a step
Think fast
Seconds late
Think fast
You'll only recognize when it seals your fate

Slow and steady
Thought out already
Everything's under control

Swift and unkindly
Surprisingly blinding
You better act quickly or you're through

Gravity is winning
Just as your regretting
The second that you weren't alert

While your unwinding
Your instincts are finding
The quickest way to not get hurt
