[performed by Municipal Waste]October back in 02
It was a real strange time at home
No one knew which attack would be next
Afraid to walk alone

They were hiding in their houses
Glued to the TV
Watching unfold the insanity
Nothing quite like this, no way to react
Nothing you can do but watch your own back

Did you ever
Feel inside the crosshairs?
Did the thought make you walk fast?
Black magic or just dumb luck
How long could this thing last

We were hiding in our houses
Glued to the TV
Watching unfold the insanity
Nothing quite like this, no way to react
Nothing you can do but watch your own back

Wish you had the answers
Wish there wasn't doubt
You wonder if he's watching
And what's it all about
Death toll rising
How much would he slay?
Are they getting closer to catching him today?

Am I trapped in the sites?
