[performed by Municipal Waste]Pseudonecrophilia!

Lonely confused guilty, not sure what's going on
Failed to see the reasoning that what I'm doings wrong

Blinded by these urges that I've never felt before
A situation unthinkable just a few days ago

Hardened flesh, rotting eyes
All things I now require
Heatless skin, pulseless grin
Consuming my desire

Lifeless mass or piece of ass
A difference I can't see
To become drenched in mourning sex
Is all I want to be

Arousal, sickness, hatred
Questioning how I feel
Somewhat feeling delusional
Is whats happening real?

This battle with temptation
Is the reason I can't stop
Which is why I failed to get
Authorities involved

It gets harder every day

Constantly wanting
Won't stop for nothing

Mourning sex
It's all I want
Mourning sex
It's what I need
Mourning sex
It just gets worse

Can't control
No way to stop
Can't control
It's what I need
Can't control
It's like I'm cursed

No cure
Can't hide
No cure
It's what I need
No cure

Since I woke up and found your corpse
I never felt like this before
Sickness, arousal, and dread
Has happened from sex with the dead
Perversion and depravity
Too much to carry on

Pseudonecrophilia!
