Some may say I'm too distrustful
You might think I've lost my mind
The truth is I have the common sense to
Red between the lines

Through media exaggerations
Lies to sell more publications
Honesty's more complicated
Another pack of lies

Newscasters to evangelists
The same problems always exist
From computers to journalists
It's not so fair and balanced

You might think I overreact
But TV's got me paranoid
Real life turned to entertainment
To fill some desperate void

Weekly media sensations
All to keep the fools in tune
Just to make the next deadline
They'll sacrifice the truth

They will sacrifice the truth

Descensitize the world

Consume!

Forever be the skeptic
