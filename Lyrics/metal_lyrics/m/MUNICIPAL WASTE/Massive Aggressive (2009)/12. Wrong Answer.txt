You got the wrong answer!

It's getting to me
It shows on my face
A crowd stares in glee
All cameras in place

The question's been posed
My time's running down
I know if I'm wrong
They're taking me out

The seconds go by my anxiety
Is boiling so much
I can't even think
This is the worst time
I'm drawing a blank
Above a pirana tank!

The most watched show in all of the world
A ratings explosion in more than one term
All walks of life young and old
Are viewing tonight to see your death unfold
Seconds away from the pain
Not the type of place to win prizes and fame
The one way out is to play the game

You only get one chance at this
To answer right
Grand prize is...your life!

You got the wrong answer!

The crowd starts to cheer
They know what's next
They're tuning in to see carnage and flesh
The host shines a grin
He doesn't care
He knows that I'm going to die on the air
