Late at night it's pitch black
A light upon the muddy tracks
You know you want to run but there's no turning back
Your curiosity is going to get you attacked
Unaware this trail will lead you to the unknown
Until the bloody head is thrown!

He came back
Fear the undead
Beware the wrath of the severed head

Returned from hell
A restless soul
Now heads are going to roll

Lets back up to where this tale begun
And find out where the beast came from
A neglectful engineer made one fateful mistake
Which caused our subjects head to fully decapitate

[repeat chorus]

Committing tales of horror
No man should see
And now your stuck with no clue of where to flee

There's only one way out
And no one has ever passed
Now you're the one next that's going to feel the wrath

For one night you will loudly hear
A shrieking head fly through the air
Shocked one could their own skull as a weapon
Now you're the one next for this late night beheading

He came back
Fear the undead
Beware the wrath of the severed head
Your neck will snap
His teeth will shred
Beware the wrath of the severed head
Returned from hell
A restless soul
Now heads are going to roll
