We've all tried to sit and concentrate
It just boils you up with hate
Have you blown all your wishes just trying to resist it?
While all hope for forgiveness has been ripped up into pieces

[Chorus:]
Look back at all the lies they said
Pushing you closer to the red
Is all the daily intake
Pushing you far past the brink
The patience once held over
Has been quickly boiling over

You pushed us toward mass aggression
And there's no other way out
Can't deal with all the pressure
And we're gonna bring you down

Woke up today and saw the light
It's not something morally right
And now our only business is focused on all of this
No doctor's going to cure it
And being pissed is my therapist

[Chorus]

No longer want to live with this pressure in my head
And pretty soon things are going to change
Frustration slowly builds and it's crushing all my will
Finally had the strength to rearrange

[Chorus]
