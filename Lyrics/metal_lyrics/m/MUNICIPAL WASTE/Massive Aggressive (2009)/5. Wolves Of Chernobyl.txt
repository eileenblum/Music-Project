Sometime not long ago on a day like this
Manmade energy caused the worst accident
People died fast and some passed through time
Radiation sickness wounds those who survive

Now mother nature attempts to rebuild
Fights to bring back all the things man has killed
Wildlife must feed while the ground grows with warmth
And DNA structured begin to reform

A force is growing hungry
In the black of night
A thirst driven by madness
Quenched by human life

Where will you run when the pack's after you?
Do you think you can hide until the howling is through?
Victims can't escape no matter how hard they flee
The beasts are running wild and all they want is to feed

Beware the pack is coming for you!

Snow stained red
Howls fill the air
Nothing's going to stop it
It's a massacre

Wolves of Chernobyl

Their numbers grow larger
A glow lights their eyes
Continues to hunt those alone in the night
Believe it's a legend
Consider it a myth
Consider it luck the fact you still exist

Was the mother nature's choice to rebuild
A way to pay us back for all we have killed
They'll soon grow in number each person they slay
And sooner or later we'll become their prey

Beware the pack is coming for you!

Snow stained red, howls fill the air
Wolves of Chernobyl
Nothing's going to stop it
It's a massacre
Wolves of Chernobyl
Driven by madness
You Can't survive
Wolves of Chernobyl!
