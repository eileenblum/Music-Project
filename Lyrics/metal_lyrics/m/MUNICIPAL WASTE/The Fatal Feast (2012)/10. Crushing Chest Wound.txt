A flash then a fall to the ground. I can just hear the sound
I can see nothing except whatâs pouring out of my chest
I grit my teeth at the fact I might not be coming back
Look up to the sky and I hope this is some kind of joke

Moments seem like days. Should I pray?
Now itâs my judgment day?
Is this some kind of a test? Will I get out of this mess?

A new perspective on all things
I have a new outlook today
My mind is changing, visions hazy
An outlook this huge wound just gave me
I got a plan Iâll make a change
I have the feeling itâs a bit too late
But now thereâs no time left to save me
Something this huge wound just gave me

Itâs so fast how things change
Some things you wish you canât take to the grave
No last chance itâs too late
Your death awaits

I blew it off and didnât give it much thought
Something that was blocked out of my mind
And here I sit with just seconds left
To reflect on what Iâm going to leave behind

So where to now?
Six feet down [x2]

A new perspective on all things
I have a new outlook today
My mind is changing, visions hazy
An outlook this huge wound just gave me
I got a plan Iâll make a change
I have the feeling itâs a bit too late

Itâs so fast how things change
Some things you wish you canât take to the grave
No last chance itâs too late
Your death awaits
