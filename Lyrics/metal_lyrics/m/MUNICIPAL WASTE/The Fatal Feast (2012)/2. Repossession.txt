We take without a care
Just waiting to claim our share
No thought of what is fair or unfair

No chance to escape or time to negotiate
We'll come storming in and just take

It's called repossession
Stealing your life
All that you worked for
Violently taken
Without a warning
There's no way to ignore

It's called repossession
And we got the goods
And soon we'll have all yours
We'll take all your money
All your belongings
And all you can fend for

If you get ripped off by some low life you know
Just pay us and we'll do the rest
We'll take your shit back and make sure that he knows
He shouldn't have fucked with the best

We take without a care
Just waiting to claim our share
No thought of what is fair or unfair

No chance to escape or time to negotiate
We'll come storming in and just take

If you need some help with retrieving your goods
Or just want to get someone back
Just hire The Waste and we'll make sure that they
Regret they ever crossed your path

It's called repossession
Stealing your life
All that you worked for
Violently taken
Without a warning
There's no way to ignore

It's called repossession
And we got the goods
And soon we'll have all yours
We'll take all your money
All your belongings
And all you can fend for

We take without a care
Just waiting to claim our share
No thought of what is fair or unfair

No chance to escape or time to negotiate
We'll come storming in and just take
