Dear officers,
Donât tell a lie
You know it will just lead to more crimes
Youâre at a loss
In need of clues
We will punish whomever we choose

We torture companies by spreading
Fear to mothers of the nation
Plotting war against your faceless
Business with no emotion
We gain pride through cyanide and many toxins

Taunting the media whore
You fear a man with fox eyes
No one can see what lies next
Nobody knows who will die
We laugh at untimely death
Poison to so many places
Businessmen brought to their knees
The monster with 21 faces

Dear officer,
Donât tell a lie
You know it will just lead to more crimes
Youâre at a loss
In need of clues
We will punish whomever we choose
