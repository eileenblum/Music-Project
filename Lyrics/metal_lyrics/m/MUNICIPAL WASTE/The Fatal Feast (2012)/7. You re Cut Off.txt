Youâre cut off
Why canât I see?
Youâre cut off
One more round please?
Youâre cut off
All that I want
Youâre cut off
Just two more shots

Third freaking time this week
Someone tells me I canât drink
They donât seem to really get that I want a lot more

They donât really understand
That itâs all part of my big plan
I like to consume until Iâm carried out the door

Youâre cut off
Conspiracy!
Youâre cut off
Youâre all against me
Youâre cut off
Whatâs this all for
Youâre cut off
This means war!

It always seems to end this way
Whyâs this place in disarray?
Is it cool if I just lay my head at the bar?

I guess some folks just canât relate
Or understand that I feel great
Just exactly who the hell do you think you are?

Donât you give me that down face
Iâm just needing one more taste
I donât see a problem but itâs mostly a blur

Iâd really like to see you pour
Than being such a goddamn bore
I just have a lisp I swear my voice isnât slurred

Youâre cut off
Why canât I see?
Youâre cut off
One more round please?
Youâre cut off
All that I want
Youâre cut off
Just two more shots
