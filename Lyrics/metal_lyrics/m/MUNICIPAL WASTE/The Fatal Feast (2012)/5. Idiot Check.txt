I can't believe a word that's out of your mouth
No idea of what you're talking about
I'm feeling dumber in your presence
You pissed me off and now you're finished

It's not about leaving stuff at shows
I just want to smash you in the nose
No one cares about the things you say
That's why your ass is getting checked today

You're arrogant. You live without a clue
There's not a single person here that respects you
Scratch your numb skull. You'll never get it
You pissed us off and soon you'll regret it

It's not about leaving stuff at shows
I just want to smash you in the nose
No one cares about the things you say
That's why your ass is getting checked today

Get checked

Brute force. Retaliation
You're hoping that you never cross our path
You try to beg. Desperation
You're keeping your distance but it won't last

You can keep annoying people all you want
But pretty soon it will be coming to a screeching halt
Run around in circles chasing your own tail
Just an idiot destined to fail

I can't believe a word that's out of your mouth
No idea of what you're talking about
I'm feeling dumber in your presence
You pissed us off and now you're finished

It's not about leaving stuff at shows
I just want to smash you in the nose
No one cares about the things you say
That's why your ass is getting checked today
