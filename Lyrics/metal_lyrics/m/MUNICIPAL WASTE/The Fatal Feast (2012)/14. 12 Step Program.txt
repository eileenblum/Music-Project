You say my lifeâs spinning out of control
It seems never ending. Iâve heard it before
Itâs like a disc skipping
Pulling me towards the door

Theyâve all tried to help me so give it a rest
Sometimes my lifeâs better when itâs all a mess
Theyâve all tried to warn me. What should I do?
I just donât want more harassment from you

I canât help but notice this occurring fact
Of you just constantly jumping down my back

I know that you love me. You just want to help
But some things are better handling myself
Iâm aware you worry but please understand
If you keep on pushing who knows where Iâll land

And I know things wonât go good this time
Now I just need a little more time for me

Heard it so many times before
12 steps out the fucking door
Pushed too hard and now Iâm just bored
12 steps out the fucking door

You say my lifeâs spinning out of control
It seems never ending. Iâve heard it before
Itâs like a disc skipping
But youâre pulling me towards the door
