Confidently greeting
Me at my front door, but something seems freaky
I glance on with intrigue
Curiosity building in what they believe

They pass on their info
I play like Iâm hooked
I attend their sermons
I purchased their books
I play all their games I need to get inside
Because I know this church has got something to hide

Time passes quickly
Things growing stranger the more that they trust me
Stumbled onto something
But not really sure itâs what I want to see

This investigation once thought as my prank
Is uncovering some unspeakable things
I need to share this but who will believe
Theyâll come to kill me the second I leave

Theyâre not human, theyâre possessed
The more Iâm learning the sicker it gets
Those who seek their secrets are hunted for fun
Not blood into wine they turn wine into blood!

Jesus freaks
Come to your end
Jesus freaks
Pray for death

I think theyâre on to me
Their attitudes changing
And the doors are closing
Congregations circling
And the preacher now is just insanely smiling

Iâm pushed toward the back room
And through a trap door
Surrounded by corpses that litter the floor
Thereâs no way out and nowhere to run
No way Iâm leaving this room with my blood

Say Iâm nosey
It canât be so
Some things are better just being unknown
Iâll pay for this lesson when my veins are drained
A blood-sucking cult led by the deranged

Jesus freaks
Come to your end
Jesus freaks
Pray for death
