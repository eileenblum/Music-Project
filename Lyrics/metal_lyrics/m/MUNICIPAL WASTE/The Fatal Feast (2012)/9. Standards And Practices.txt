Itâs time to wake up
Youâve been force-fed
They only want whatâs in your wallet
You canât deny
It makes you sick
To them weâre just a demographic
Thereâs no escape before our eyes
Ruining lives

Itâs about time
We took control and stopped selling our soul
Corporate slime
Theyâll never care if we all live or die
Crooks â¦ con men
Scamming their way to world domination
Fooled again
And keeping us down is how they want to win

They know thereâs more of us than them
But itâs our existence they condemn
The rich stay rich. The poor stay poor
Our misery is what they ignore
How can this last it has to end
Speeding us toward full Armageddon
Rise from your knees
Kick down their doors
This time itâs war!

Itâs about time
We took control and stopped selling our soul
Corporate slime
Theyâll never care if we all live or die

Find your answers
Search for truth
Weâre not all just brain washed youth
Your decisions
Pull the plug
Time is up and weâve had enough

Itâs time to wake up
Youâve been force-fed
They only want whatâs in your wallet
You canât deny
It makes you sick
To them weâre just a demographic
Thereâs no escape before our eyes
Ruining lives
