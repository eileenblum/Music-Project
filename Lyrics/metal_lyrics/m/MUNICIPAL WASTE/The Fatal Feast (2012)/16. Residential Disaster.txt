Weâll storm through your town
Breaking the walls down
Crash and burn
The residents soon will learn
Our destructive ways
Will punish you bastards
We make our way
The residential disaster

Fear strikes the masses
No separate classes
Facing us results in whooping of asses
Join us or die and get left in our wake
The decision is ours and we choose your fate
You are forced to obey once you follow or tribe
Posers and traitors wonât make it out alive
Feel our destruction
Youâll feel our rage
Weâll strike without warning
And war we will wage

You canât survive!
Our forcefulness and our own will
Wonât take you alive!
Your punishment and our right to kill

The residents have fled
Across the lawns blood is shed
Crushing pain to those who remain
Revenge is ours. Payment for out battle scars
No one can now make us refrain

The last disaster
Until we decide to do it again
There will be no laughter
No chance for your people to win
It was your mistake
And with vengeance we were forced correct
Now itâs too late
And the dead are the only ones left

Fear strikes the masses
No separate classes
Facing us results in whooping of asses
Youâll feel our destruction
Youâll feel our own rage
Weâll strike without warning
And war we will wage

You canât survive!
Our forcefulness and our own will
Wonât take you alive!
Your punishment and our right to kill

Weâll storm through your town
Breaking the walls down
Crash and burn
The residents soon will learn
Our destructive ways
Will punish you bastards
We make our way
The residential disaster
