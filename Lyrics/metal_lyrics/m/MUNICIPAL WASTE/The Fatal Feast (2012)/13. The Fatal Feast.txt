Years away from what was home,
We've been traveling all alone
A space voyage to explore the unseen
We haven't found a single goddamn thing

Decades passing, rations low,
The crew's tensions are about to blow.
Let's take our leader and turn him into meat,
And introduce him to our fatal feast.

Our fatal feast.

Our minds escaped all rationality,
And all it wants to do is just feed.
It's not murder if we all played a part,
He had it coming from the very start.

Let's kill the captain and stuff our face.
He led us all to starve here. fatal feast

Desperate
This mission now has failed
No hope left
You're going to be our meal

One last breath
The skin begins to peel
Meet your death
A nightmare becoming real

Advanced knowledge, a primitive end.
Cannibalistic results here in.
Our space program never would have thought
That something this disgusting has gone on

Desperate
This mission now has failed
No hope left
You're going to be our meal

One last breath
The skin begins to peel
Meet your death
A nightmare becoming real

Years away from what was home,
We've been traveling all alone
A space voyage to explore the unseen
We haven't found a single goddamn thing

Decades passing, rations low,
The crew's tensions are about to blow.
Let's take our leader and turn him into meat,
And introduce him to our fatal feast.

Introduce him to our fatal feast.
