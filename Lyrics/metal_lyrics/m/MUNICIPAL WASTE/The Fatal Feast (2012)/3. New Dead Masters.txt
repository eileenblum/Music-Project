Hey doc I got this fever I can't shake
At first I thought it's something that I ate
It kind of seems like my eyes are seeing red
It's really hard for me to leave my bed
Skin is peeling and my hair is growing thin
Sensations like the walls are closing in
Could you prescribe something to help clear this up?
I'd really like for all this pain to stop

Hey doc it's me again and I'm still hurt
The medicine you gave my made it worse
Now my skins turned a darker shade of grey
The only thing I feel is hunger pains

It all started just the other night
From a strangers bite
Something just wasn't right
I know this pain will never stop
Till it gets what it wants
Consuming all my thoughts
All needs I've had have gone away
Except for just one thing
And that's consuming brains
And I'm going to run around here dead
And rip apart your head
Until I'm fully fed

And it's only going to spread faster
Bow down to your new dead masters [x2]

Till everything is dead

It all started just the other night
From a strangers bite
Something just wasn't right
I know this pain will never stop
Till it gets what it wants
Consuming all my thoughts
All needs I've had have gone away
Except for just one thing
And that's consuming brains
I'm going to run around here dead
And rip apart your head
Until I'm fully fed

And it's only going to spread faster
Bow down to your new dead masters

Till everything is dead
