I never cared about what youâve been taught
Or concerned with the things you bought
When you talk down it just makes no sense
Because Iâm not listening to begin with

Pent up aggression
Built through the years
You were pushed around in school
And faced with all your fears
Passive behavior
Replaced with a complex
To regulate and conquer
Whoever puts you to the test

You think youâre in charge
But itâs all in your head

If itâs your goal to have the upper hand
You should contemplate a better plan

Pent up aggression
Built through the years
You were pushed around in school
And faced with all your fears
Passive behavior
Replaced with a complex
To regulate and conquer
Whoever puts you to the test

Thereâs no one left to boss around
This power trip has just been shut down
Shut down!
