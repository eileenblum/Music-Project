He can't hear your screams for help
Doesn't care about your wealth
Only wants one thing
He'll follow you until you're cornered
Pretty soon you'll be a goner
He's taking you to his domain,
Abduction is his only goal
Snatching chosen peopleâs souls
Causing terror in his wake

A servant to a darker lord
Hunting you around the world
Writing for your last mistake

Unholy Abductor
Committing his deeds as instructed
Unholy Abductor
Soon is the time to be punished [x2]

He loves stalking prey
Hunger growing day by day
You must flee and never rest
Cause if you do so much as sleep
A second that you try to keep
He'll take you and he'll pass his test
Run and run and never stop
Do not rest until you drop
Your only chance to stay alive

Unholy Abductor
Committing his deeds as instructed
Unholy Abductor
Soon is the time to be punished [x2]

Waiting in the darkest region
For the killing season
Watch with whom you make you deals
Cause when you have to pay your debt
You will soon regret
When you find out heâs real
