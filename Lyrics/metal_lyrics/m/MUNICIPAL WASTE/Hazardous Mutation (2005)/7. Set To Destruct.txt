We are the speed metal punks
Pushed to the limit too much
We're the unstoppable force
Now it's the time to erupt!
We are the army of drunks
Our weapons are set to destruct
We've come to punish all foes
Now it's our time to erupt!

No longer underneath the streets
We'll infiltrate until you're weak
We'll strike upon what you hold dear
The Waste has come the end is near
Annihilating shit like you
Despising everything you do
Heed or everlasting blast
Kneel before the kings of thrash
The never ending thrash assault
Ramming metal down your throat
Developing a new regime
Of metal punks to reign supreme

We're angry all the time
It doesn't mean we lost our minds
We've channelled all our rage
To put em in an early grave
A terrorizing reign
Slicing through you brain
Those that don't condone
We'll the flesh right off your fucking bones
