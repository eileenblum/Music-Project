I'm sitting talking to myself
I look around there's no one else
My shirt is soaked with my own drool
I thought these drugs were going to rule

As my heart pumps and my head spins
I think its coming back again
Instead of finding piece of mind
I'm losing it in record time

It feels like I'm dreaming
I'm losing all feeling
How long will this last
Far beyond trashed
The seconds seem longer
The drugs become stronger
As I slip away from reality

Scared to death will it come soon?
I'm locked inside this bathroom
Claw my skin pull my hair out
Make's no noise when I try to shout

Searching for feeling drifting away
I'm trapped in a K-hole
And can't find my way!
Locked inside a padded room
And fed all my food with a spoon
My arms are strapped my brain is fries
I'm fucking trapped inside my mind!
They've tried their therapy
To help with my affliction
I'm sentenced to a life
With my accelerated vision
Nothing left to do
I can't find a way back
It spins and spins until it all turns black

My mind is a cell
Trapped in a K-hole
