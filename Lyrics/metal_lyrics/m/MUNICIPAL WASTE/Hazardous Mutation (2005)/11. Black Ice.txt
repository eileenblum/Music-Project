On the lonesome highway
The roadways are slick
The temperature's dropping
The fog is so thick
The chill in the air
Mixed with oil in the lane
It's nature's creation
To cause you great pain

BLACK ICE!
You're gonna wreck
BLACK ICE!
Don't lose control
BLACK ICE!
You'll break your neck

So on your next journey
Just heed my advice
That shit killed Cliff Burton
BEWARE OF BLACK ICE!
