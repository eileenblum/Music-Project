In his walls of madness
Deep inside his bran
The Deathripper's calling out
To end his pain
The punishment, the aftermath
The final blow, the last laugh
He's holding too little
Of the sanity he grasps
A grisly plot is made
Now locked up in a cage
"A lion pacing back and forth
Holding back his rage"
His clenched fist only shows
His hatred as it grows
How much more can a man hold bad
Until his head explodes

Sentenced to death
With no hope in sight
Murdering victims
Robs them of life
His sentence set in stone
He's gonna make 'em pay
His only chance for freedom will be your judgement day
