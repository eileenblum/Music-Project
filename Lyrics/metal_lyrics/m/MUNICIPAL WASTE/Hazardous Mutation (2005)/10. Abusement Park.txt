Step right up
For games and prizes
For real cool rides
And a fun safe time
So I did
Not knowing that the park
Hidden behind the tall fences and red curtains
Was a fate worse than death itself!

So I stepped right up
As fear took hold
My heart stopped and my blood ran cold!
Running for your life
Through a maze of pain
Welcome to the circus from a mind deranged
Come aboard the ride
That's designed for death
As Abusement takes your last breath

Run to find an exit
Weaving through the dark
The freak show has taken
Over this park!
