Another boring Saturday
Looks like everything is swell
Another fucking week of this
I want to blow it all to hell

Nothing exiting no news to report
This is my weekend
And I'm fucking bored
I've used all my patience
There's no more to give
If I can't fuck shit up
I don't want to live

The chicks are passed out
And so are the dudes
I'm sitting wide-awake
And there is nothing to do
I could steal a bike or hop on a board
But my friend left his car keys
Right next to the door
Nothing left to decide
It's time for me to take the ride
This time I'm going to cross the line
And do it going 95mph

Blood Drive we're gonna die!

Hop curbs sideswipe
Oops there went a tailpipe
Only went a block away
This cars luck just ran out today

Sliding through stop signs
Seeing double going blind
Followed by about 10 cops
I'll finally get to be on FOX
