Another Sunday I'm battered and spent
So many things happened that I might regret
A weekly occurrence, what's strange about that?
But it seems like to me there's a pain in my neck

Aches when I turn and when I look up
It feels like my necks been hit by a truck
Ears are still ringing
Brains far from sober
What can I do to stop this bangover?
I rocked too hard and now I'm suffering

I wish this pain could go away
Recalling things
From yesterday
My body spent
That band played fast
I got a case of drunken whiplash

Feels like I stage dove on my head
I think I polished off a keg
Your classic case of bangers neck
A sting I will never forget

Fist in the air
Whirlwind of hair
Thrash music ringing through your ears
These things all pass and here I lay
Not going out for shit today!

Aches when I turn and when I look up
It feels like my necks been hit by a truck
Ears are still ringing
Brains far from sober
What can I do to stop this bangover?
