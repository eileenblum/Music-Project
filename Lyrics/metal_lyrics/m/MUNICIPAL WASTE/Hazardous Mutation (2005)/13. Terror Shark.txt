You thought that you'd have so much fun
Out surfing with your bro's
But in the water awaits
A terror that nobody knows
Without a fear you rip around
Stoked on the killer waves
But to dine on your flesh
Is what this monster craves!

But it's too late it has made its mark
THE TERROR SHARK
You're dragged beneath
By its rows of teeth
THE TERROR SHARK

Panic on the beach
There's nothing the lifeguard can do
The crimson red of you blood
Stains the oceans blue
You never thought that you could be
So low on the food chain
You're left a floating piece of meat
In agonizing pain

The meal is done you body is gone
They only find an arm
A terrible reminder
That you're never safe from harm
Back into the depths
Its stomach is full from the deadly feast

Remorseless killer digests the deceased
THE TERROR SHARK
Humans are helpless to this mighty beast
THE TERROR SHARK
Claiming its prey helpless in the water
We're a human buffet

Nothings going to save you
Now that it's begun to slay
You're lucky if they find your torso
Floating in the waves

When the water's not shallow
You're bound to get swallowed
As the hunger for your flesh
Grows more by the hour
Was it a good idea to go for that swim?
Since they'll never find your body
In one piece again

Out of the water!
THE TERROR SHARK
