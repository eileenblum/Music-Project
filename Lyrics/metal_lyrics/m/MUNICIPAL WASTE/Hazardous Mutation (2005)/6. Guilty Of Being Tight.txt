Something these days
Has been bringing me down
The rumour mill's been spinning around
Fair-weather friends breeding severed ties
Fuels more fire to all of the lies
Tension building your head starts to swell
Thinking of ways to send them to hell
Stepped on so coldly it's just not right
They're all just jealous
Cause you're fucking tight!
Now sit back for a second
Just take a deep breath
From contemplating ways
To incite your early death
Instead of thinking about your problems
And all the things you lack
You gotta figure out a way to get those fuckers back!
Stop mulling through your problems
Don't drink the pain away
Don't use it for a crutch
To start acting really lame
You need to get up from your slump
And the things you think you lack
You gotta figure out a way to get those fuckers back!

Just because you're different
They can't comprehend
Betrayed by the ones
Disguised as your friends
Don't take their shit
Stand up for your fight
They all hate you
Cause you are fucking tight!
