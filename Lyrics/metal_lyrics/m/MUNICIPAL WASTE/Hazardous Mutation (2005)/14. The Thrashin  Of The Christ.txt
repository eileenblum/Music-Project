Come to save our souls you say
Or are we just prey?
Should we serve?
A lie absurd called the holy word
Jesus Christ you're out of luck
Let's thrash that fuck!

Can't they see what its come to be?
Preachers drowning in a sea of pity
But when we rise from the cloud of lies
We'll crush the church and take back our lives

Hide behind the cross telling lies of the absurd
How many alter boys are fucked
Before your time is served
How often do you hear of
Some pastor's sudden fall from grace
Crying on T.V. with smeared make up
Running down his face
More and more the evidence is piling up
That organized religion
Is just a den for the corrupt!
Your kingdom come will never cum
Your sense of faith slowly goes numb
Watching you rot from the insides
Patiently waiting your demise
