Sweat pours down my face
Laying in the strangest place
Body aches from constant pain
Blurred thoughts fill my brain

Legs too sore to even walk
Throats dry can't talk
A modern day Jekyll and Hyde
Throwing up hating life

Once again it's taken its hold over me!

Once thought as a delicious drink
Pounds me till I cannot think
I'm hammered in a single blink
Patrons look in disbelief
While I'm causing major grief
By punching people in the teeth

Kicking people on the balls
Trying to break every law
My friend said I jumped through a wall!
Rolling round in broken glass
Falling down kicking ass
Forgotten memories of the past

Don't blame me
I was just bored
Blame it on the drinks
That the bartender pored
14 shots some beers as a chaser
Then he followed it up with a Mind Eraser

Real fucked up's the only way to react
Then you run around the street
Like you're a maniac

It was my only choice
It's not my fault
Now I'll spend the next day
Trying to collect my thoughts
