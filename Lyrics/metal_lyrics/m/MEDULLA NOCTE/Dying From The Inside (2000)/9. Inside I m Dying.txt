These sores remain within me and as they congregate like leeches on my SKIN 
- I try to SHED
I scratch MYSELF til I bleed - I DESERVE IT!
Nausea creeps up on me in times when my head should be clear - the STENCH of 
sickness STAINS my face
It CAN'T be real - for GOD'S SAKE HELP ME!
Inside I'm dying
All this time, when I was sick, and you knew

This condition is the only one appropriate for me
I'm the only one that suffers at my own hands, I'm unconcious, unconcious - 
but...
Aaargh, now inside I'm dying
All this time, when I was sick, and you knew

Just looked upon with caution, I'm a freak that feigns for sympathy - It's 
JUST the pain is REAL
I see the WOUNDS fester - why can't you see?
Inside I'm dying
All this time, when I was sick, and you knew

This condition is the only one appropriate for me
I'm the only one that suffers at my own hands, I'm unconcious, unconcious - 
but...
Aaargh, now inside I'm dying
All this time, when I was sick, and you knew

Inside I'm dying, dying
All this time, when I was sick, you knew!

It's me who suffers
It's me who suffers

It's me that suffers...
