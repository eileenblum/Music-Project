Thoughtlessness, you're meaningful
But so irritating
Your inner soul of torment keeps you
From discovering your true self
While walking a tightrope
That none can follow
Saying that you made the effort
But failed abysmally
All your senses gagged and bound
But with you the blame lies elsewhere
Take a look at what you have done
It's all your fault [x8]

Struggling, making sense of a hopeless case
How can you look me in the face
And say that you were not to blame
How can I forgive you, when the betrayal continues
When will you learn that I never can trust you
When will you learn that you can never be my friend
What will it take for you to listen?
You've now destroyed me
Hurt my feelings, laughed out loud
But with you the blame lies elsewhere
Take a look at what you have done
It's all your fault [x8]

When I'm alone, I see your face
And I can understand how I can feel such rage
I will not forget

Your betrayal was the hardest thing to take
You put yourself first, regardless of the mess that you made
I can't forgive, can't even think about you
You will be sorry, you will be sorry
It's all your fault [repeat]
