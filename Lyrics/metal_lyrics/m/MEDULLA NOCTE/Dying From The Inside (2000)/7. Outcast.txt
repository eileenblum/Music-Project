Slowly drowning
Slowly crying
Frightened to a point
I'm changing tactics
Calmly sinking
Lungs contracting
But slowly breathing

Drown, drown, drown
All I've lost is a will to live
I don't fit in [x4]

Outcast
Finding peace now
Eyes are closed now
Suffocating
Demons leaving
Slowly breathing
Tears are bleeding
Isolated

Drown, drown, drown
All I've lost is a will to live
I don't fit in [x4]

Asphyxiating, suffocating [repeat]

Call my name as I float away, float away
Call my name as I float away

I've been outcast!

If living means suffering with conscience
Then death seems the only release
No more nights of insomnia
No more days of bitterness

I've never been accepted
I've never been part of this
Now always play the outcast
I never thought it would come to this [x5]

Call my name as I float away

Feel my lungs contract!
