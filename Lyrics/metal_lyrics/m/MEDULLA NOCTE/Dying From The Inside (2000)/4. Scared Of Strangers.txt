Desperation fills the air that I breath
And will power is now stolen
Sweat profusely, but cold to the touch
Needing help, but refuse to go outside

Don't speak to me
Don't even look my way
Don't speak to me

Discomfort in company
Yet misery alone
All my emotions, completely empty
Horror at the thought of closeness

Don't speak to me
Don't even look my way
Don't speak to me

Can't face you or your kind
Can't face the fact I'm sick
Stay reclusive, I have to
Imprisoned within this cage

Feeling eyes burn into my face
An early exit, got to get some space
A whole lifetime, scared of strangers [repeat]

I need help....
Can't stand to face people unknown
Four walls are a prison that I call home
And the thought of death
I just can't cope
