I feel like breaking you in two
Why do you always betray so often
The thought of you makes my skin crawl
I can't forgive you for what you've done
Nothing, nothing you've done will ever be forgotten, looking after yourself
And fuck the rest of us
Just lying paralysed - but always awake

Has the penny dropped
Has the penny dropped yet?

Crawl into your hiding space, make sure that I never see you
For you will die for what you've done
Your moral structure will crumble, ego deflated
Expression of rage, no final warning
Just deadly silence
I could be happy but I'm so full of hate

Has the penny dropped
Has the penny dropped yet?

Payback!

No-one can help you now [repeat]
I could snuff you like a candle, and still show no remorse

The silver spoon in your mouth has been from birth
The time has come to think for yourself
Is the feeling that good that you'd sell out your friends?
You will be uncovered you snivelling fuck
You will be uncovered
Just lying paralysed - but always awake

Has the penny dropped
Has the penny dropped yet?

Payback!
