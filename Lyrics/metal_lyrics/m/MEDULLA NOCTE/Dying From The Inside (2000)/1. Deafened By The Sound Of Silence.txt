No, not the ringing
Wide awake, suffering

Constant hissing-deafening
Constantly, constantly
Reverberate inside my skull [x4]

The sound is silent, yet exhaustive
It's violent, but absorbing
It's calming, but annoying
It's coming!

Deafened by the sound of silence
My fear has kept me in my place
All chains are now broken
And I'm ashamed to show my face
And now, I've never felt so out of place

No, not the ringing
Head in hands, whimpering

Hands are shaking, body aching
Aching sounds, reverberating
Reverberate inside my skull [x4]

The sound is silent, yet exhaustive
It's violent, but absorbing
It's calming, but annoying
It's coming!

Deafened by the sound of silence
I'm consumed within it's mist
And as the ringing grows louder
I feel the blade against my wrist
And slowly I'm hearing the volume....increase

You can call me paranoid
Call me a freak
But I've got to distrust everbody that I meet
Made enough apolgies
They're ones I retract
Cos every time I turn away, I get stabbed in the back

Have you gained anything with your selfishness
Except my distrust and utter conceit
Are you satisfied to strip me of all that I have
Like the dignity I had that was stripped [repeat]

The sound is silent, yet exhaustive
It's violent...but supportive

Reverberate inside my skull [repeat]
Shut up!
