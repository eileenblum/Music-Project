A broken state of mind
The damage can't not be repaired
You call yourself a friend [x3]
What scheme are you behind?
You're responsible again [x4]

Everything was great
Until you showed your face
Just a hollow shell remains
And a broken state of mind

Eyesight is turning to black
Blinded by your selfishness
Once again the victim [x3]
Once again the one to suffer
So disappointed in you [x4]

Everything was great
Until you showed your face
Just a hollow shell remains
And a broken state of mind [x4]

The room was filled with laughter and the laughter aimed at me
The room was filled with laughter and the laughter was aimed at me,
Not the shame, not the shame, and a broken state of mind

Conscience cracking under strain
Stressed beyond the point of repair
You call yourself a friend [x4]
I'm so disappointed in you [x12]
