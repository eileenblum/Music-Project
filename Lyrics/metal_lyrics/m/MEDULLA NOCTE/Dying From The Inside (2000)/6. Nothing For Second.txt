Can't accept rewards that I've received
This fear of losing leaves it's scars on me

I'm sorry I didn't fit in
I'm sorry that I've got a complex
I'm sorry but my life is a joke

I'm sorry I seem to have failed you
I'm sorry that my life is a mess
I'm sorry but I don't have the answers

I'm sorry but I did my best
I'm sorry I can't take the shame
I'm sorry but no-one can help me

Strive for success, success, success....

The path I tread is one I have to follow
There's nothing for second, there's nothing for second
Still make the same mistakes [x4]
Despondent, this empty shell takes it's last breath
I feel the pain but I still enjoy it

One day is in confidence
The next is in fear
I think I'll just stay at home
Because the next I might not see the end of

What I thought that I loved I find I despise
It's killing me slowly, infront of my eyes

Try to win the race, the race, the race....

[repeat chorus]

The future is not all it's cracked to be
I just apologise for fucking things up again [repeat]

Start, fight, defeat, again (oh no not again, not again)
Competitive to the last, still walk away with nothing, nothing....

Still make the same mistakes [x4]

I wasn't good enough [repeat]
And I apologize for fuck all
