Laughing at tragedy
The misery that captivates me
Sometimes I feel like I am losing my mind
Is it a sickness? cos I always get the same reaction from you every time

I never thought that death was so much fun [repeat]
The nervous reaction
The lack of affection
The wounds wide open
The urge for confrontation
I never meant to cause you pain, I just can't help it
I want to triumph the top of the game
Despite the circumstances, I can't help laughing [repeat]
Unaware of bitter glances
Hiding, never taking chances
Using my hands to cover up the fact I'm smiling
It just never sinks in cos I always get the same reaction from you
And you pull no punches

I never thought that death was so much fun [repeat]
The nervous reaction
The lack of affection
The wounds wide open
The urge for confrontation
I never meant to cause you pain, I just can't help it
Messed up your feelings once again
Trying so hard to make amends
Keep saying sorry again and again

I never thought that death could be so much fun

Can't stop the tremors

Laughing at tragedy
A downfall that amuses me
Cracking my ribs, knowing that it's you that suffers I am glad that you're 
dead
Because I always get the same reaction.....
