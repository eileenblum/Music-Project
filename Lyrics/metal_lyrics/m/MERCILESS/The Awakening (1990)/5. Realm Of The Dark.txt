Let the sun shine for you
For the last time in your life
Come to me, my friend
Into the realm of the night

I deny the cross
All faith is lost
I am insane
And now I'll pay

I couldn't stand the nightmares
My visions of paradise
There's no light beyond life
The pearly gates are full of lie

Still the night is young
Far away is the sun
I am on my way down
Into the underground

I scream out in fright
Now I'll pay for my sins
I try to fly
On my broken wings

Don't leave me alone
Please, hear my call
The end is near
Into the flames I fall
