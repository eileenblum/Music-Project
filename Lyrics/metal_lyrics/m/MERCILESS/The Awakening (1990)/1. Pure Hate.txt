I want to climb the mountain of dreams
but I'm just lying here on the ground
I can't move and I can't see
and can't here a fucking sound
come to me you said
there's something beyond reality
a journey into darkness
to fight against humanity

Mirror, what do you see
glory, fortune or insanity?
death, means just rebirth
to the fiery kingdom under the earth
I was never like them
I could never obey their insane lord
please let me enter
mark me with the holy sword

Pure hate

Going into nowhere
you're asking me to follow
I really don't know
where I'll be tomorrow
