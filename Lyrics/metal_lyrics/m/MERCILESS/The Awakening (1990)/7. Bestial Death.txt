The night has come
For your final doom
He's waiting for you
Obsessed by the moon

Now you start to run
Run for your life
Something's haunting you
You don't know why

Bestial....

Hungry for your blood
The full moon is shining
You know he'll find you
Lonely and scared you are crying

Now you will perish
Nothing will remain
He'll tear your flesh
You will die in pain

You will die in pain!

Now he's satisfied
For the end of your life
H now walks away
With your blood on his knife

Thousands of victims
They all shall die
When the full moon shines
Bestial death
