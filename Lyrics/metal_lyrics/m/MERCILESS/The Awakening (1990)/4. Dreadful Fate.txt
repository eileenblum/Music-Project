The war is here and what will remain
what will happen when insanity prevail
caught in a grasp of eternal pain
fear and tears you canï¿½t restrain

We all fight with a growing hate
kill to live is a dreadful fate

They don't care how you plead
your head under the sword of steel
They'll find you wherever they dwell
take your soul and send it to hell

Fuck, fuck, can't you see
who will survive, you or me

Dreadful fate...
