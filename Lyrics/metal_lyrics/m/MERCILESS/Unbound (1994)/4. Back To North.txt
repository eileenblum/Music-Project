Unleash the powers
Powers of destruction
Hatred within us
The darkest obsession
Gods of the sea
Gave us the mind
Gods of warm now let us win

A new day is born wake up sons
And daughters
United by the gods, we sail the
Violent waters
They gave us a sign
A man on a cross
Supposed to save us all, but
Their minds are forever lost

Take me home
Back to north

The old man whispers, no
Bitterness in his face
He is not afraid of death
He'll come to a better place
As the boat is burning
In this foreign land
No one can tell when I can
Take my mothers hand

We all wanna go home
Many months at sea
Only the strong survive
Feels like an eternity
Our pockets are full of gold

Home to the land of ice
Our eyes are filled with glory
The land we wish to end out lives

Take me home
Back to north

A new day is born, wake up sons
And daughters
United by the gods, we sail the
Violent waters
Gods of the dea
Gave us the wind
Gods of war, now let us win

The hammer smashing the sky
Lightning is his pride
The creator of thunder
He will never die
The wind is blowing for us
At least we're going home
This journey won't be
Forgotten
Shall be written on
A sacred stone

Take me home
Back to north
