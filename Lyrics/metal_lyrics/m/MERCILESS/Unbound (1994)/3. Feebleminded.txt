I can still hear those echoes
I hear them fly
Through the night
Remember the false ones
Let them die again tonight
We're all trapped under the sun with all the others
The brainless and the fools
And all their mothers and fathers

So tell me now,
What can you do about it?
When your life is a lie,
And your head is full of shit

There's a wall arround you
Can you see if there's anything behind?
The wall grows higher
And it will carry on until the day you die

So die...
Feebleminded

I can still hear those echoes
I hear them fly
Through the night
Remember the false ones
Let them die again tonight
We're all trapped under the sun with all the others
The brainless and the fools
And all their mothers and fathers

Promise after promise
They have your life in their hands
Playing with your mind
It's all the same in every land

Feebleminded

So tell me now,
What can you do about it?
When your life is a lie,
And your head is full of shit

So die...
Feebleminded
