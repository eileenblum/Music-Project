Must be time, another time
Sleeping eternally
Awake disturbing the peace
Can't sleep in misery

The people cannot see or talk
Where is the land I used to walk

When the flowers are black
And the water is read
The night is forever, all emotions are dead

The people cannot see or talk
Where is the land I used to walk

Questions...
Where is the answer when man is killing man
Screaming...
Neverending scream there's
Blood on gods hand

Misery...
Falling off the edge and you can't see the ground

Eternity...
It's a painfil flight and your
Soul cannot be found
I don't want those feeble
Creatures
To be a part of my life
A journey to self destructions
Die by their own knife

Questions...
Where is the answer when man is killing man
Screaming...
Neverending scream there's
Blood on gods hand

If there ever was a light, just let me sleep
Into the peaceful dark
Happiness I keep

The people cannot see or talk
Where is the land I used to walk

In the hands of nature, healing
My wounded flesh
Visions of endless suffering
Fall through blackness

Who is there to understand
Why is everything dying
I don't have the strength
I'm not even trying
