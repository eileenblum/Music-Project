This is no place for me
Outcast of society
No mourning from my side
Against them I will fly

Yes I will...

Flying through the forest
The colors blind my eyes
As one with the earth
I will never die

As one with the earth...

Second morning of ecstacy
Dreaming about now
And the past
Endless journey into
Dreamland
Forever I hope it will last

I feel unbound - In my diamond dream
I am unbound - In my diamond dream

Watching, lurking eternal dawn
Running hunting in this dream
I was born

Screaming, crying please take me high
Dreaming flying never to die

Second morning of ecstacy
Dreaming about now
And the past
Endless journey into
Dreamland
Forever I hope it will last

I feel unbound - In my diamond dream
I am unbound - In my diamond dream

We are unbound
Unbound...
