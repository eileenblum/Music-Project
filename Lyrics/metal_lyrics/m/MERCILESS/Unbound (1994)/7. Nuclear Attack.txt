You start to cry in pain
The war is driving you insane
Corpses smell decay
Jesus cannot hear you pray

Nuclear Attack

Winds of death are blowing free
The end has come for me
Come and join us, the souls of the damned
Come and take Charon's hand

You're digging your own grave
You're death's eternal slave

Death surrounds you
You cannot hide
Insanity and pain you will die

Spreading the plague
Acroos the sea
Throughout the world
You may not believe

You're digging your own grave
You're death's eternal slave

Running through fire and flame
It is entering your flesh
No use to hide
Awaiting your last breath

Winds of death are blowing free
The end has come for me
Come and join us, the souls of the damned
Come and take Charon's hand

You're digging your own grave
You're death's eternal slave

Death surrounds you
You cannot hide
Insanity and pain you will die

Nuclear Attack...
