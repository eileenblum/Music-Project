A world made of diamonds
Proud is the king
Faithful are his servants
The jewel choir sing
Down in the village
Where silence rule
The people whispers
About the fool
Streets of gold
Cloudless sky
Beloved silence
Shall never die

The king is satisfied
When you kneel in front of him
In the night
The people whispers kill the king
If someone hear you
Say something wrong
You know you will be singing on your last song

A world made of diamonds
Proud is the king
Faithful are his servants
The jewel choir sing
Streets of gold
Cloudless sky
Beloved silence

The king is satisfied
When you kneel in front of him
In the night
The people whispers kill the king
If someone hear you
Say something wrong
You know you will be singing on your last song

Do not let them know
Keep the hatred within
Do not open your mind
And don't live in sin
Don't think don't need
And don't you ever feel
Don't see don't talk
Do not follow your heart
