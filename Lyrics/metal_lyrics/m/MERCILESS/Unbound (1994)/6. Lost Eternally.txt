Welcome to my world
Everlasting Anguish
Com and watch me bleed, and
Then finally perish
I can see it now
It's all crystal clear
Everything is gone
Why should I even care

Deep depression
Anguish is burning me alive
Lost freedom
Deep inside I don't wanna die
Victimized
Chained in a cold cell
Reason unknown
This could be hell

Claustrophobia set me free
I cut the flesh
I am lost eternally

All the lies have been told
The pain I went through
Torment is here
It will come for you to
Fist strikes the wall
I can feel the anger burn
Got to let it out
I got nowhere to turn

Memories
Crimes of a past life
Nightmares
Alon in the night

Welcome to my world
Everlasting anguish
Come and watch me bleed
And then finally perish
I can see it now
It's all crystal clear
Everything is gone
Why should I even care

Claustrophobia set me free
I cut the flesh
I am lost eternally
