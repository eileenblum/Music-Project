If the sun would die
Would you still love the dark
Tell me your deepest thoughts
From the depth of you heart
Would you still obey
Behind prision walls
Proudly raise you sword
When darkness forever calls

Should I take you down
Drag you down where I dominate
Infernal rage
Let you feel the darkest hate

I dominate
With cold eyes of grey

Enchant me with your thoughts
Show me your evil ways
Invite me to your dreams
And the magic of evil grace
Stricken by fear
When I crush your dreams
Can you take it
When I laugh at your feeble screams

Should I take you down
Drag you down where I dominate
Infernal rage
Let you feel the darkest hate

Possessed by death
A morbid fantasy
Your world are friction
Can't get close to me

Pretended greatness
Absence of a real life
Come and burn with me
In darkened skies

If the sun would die
Would you still love the dark
Tell me your deepest thoughts
From the depth of you heart
Would you still obey
Behind prision walls
Proudly raise you sword
When darkness forever calls

I dominate
With cold eyes of grey
