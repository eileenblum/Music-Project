Bastard son, the chosen one
We've got no time to waste
The world is ours, immense powers
We're lost in the morning haze

Wicked desire, getting higher
We'll never sleep again
Rebirth, leave the earth
A kingdom without an end

No other, will bother
You shall be the one
Devil's eye, red sky
As we fly into the sun

Look at me, and you'll see
All the answers in my face
Touch me, and you will fell
Embodiment of grace

Time flies, no more lies
We shall always be the same
Sorrow dies, in your eyes
A life without pain

You must, turn to dust
I am not a liar
Dark divinity, fate's sealed
As we are cleansed by fire
