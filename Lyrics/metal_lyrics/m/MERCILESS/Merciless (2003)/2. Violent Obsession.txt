Nothing can touch me
As I walk through the wastelands
The path of suffering
Where everything is damned
I am the soul collector
Hunting human prey
I feed upon their cries
Death will come my way

Master of decay
Skulls and bones 
Violent obsession
I march alone

I can feel their pain
They'll never be free
Victims of a thousand wars
Their souls live in me
Stench of blood in the air
From north to south
Rotting bodies at my feet
Dust fills my hungry mouth

Master of decay
Skulls and bones 
Violent obsession
I march alone

Dirty wounds
Filthy flesh
Ride the warhead
I am son of death

Master of decay
Skulls and bones 
Violent obsession
I march alone
