Burning shore, stranded
A distant yell
Can't run, branded
In this private hell
Growing hatred, from within
Boiling blood
Damned inferno, glowing skin
Unnatural fog

I'm in hell
All by myself
Vicious curse
Fallen angels universe

In solitude, waiting
Total blackness
For years, screaming
Dark emptiness
Isolated, from life
Invisible cage
Nocturnal trap, endless night
Lethal inner rage

I'm in hell
All by myself
Vicious curse
Fallen angels universe

Burning shore, stranded
A distant yell
Can't run, branded
In this private hell
Growing hatred, from within
Boiling blood
Damned inferno, glowing skin
Unnatural fog

I'm in hell
All by myself
Vicious curse
Fallen angels universe
