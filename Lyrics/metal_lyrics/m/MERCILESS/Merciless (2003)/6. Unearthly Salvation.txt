My wine is like water for the gods
Raise the chalice with pride
You will see it all
An offer you can not deny

I hold the key
To ecstasy

I'm the sleepless dreamer
So come, revelation
Mystical, magical
Unearthly salvation

Another blind fanatic.
City wasteland must be cursed
Black masses in the attic
Blue eyed loser is driving a hearse

Let me carry you around in a body bag
Play dead for an hour or two
Then you will surley realize
It's the best thing i'll ever do for you

I hold the key
To ecstasy

I'm the sleepless dreamer
So come, revelation
Mystical, magical
Unearthly salvation
