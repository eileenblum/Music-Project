Set yourself free
From flesh and blood
Let your soul fly
Denial of their god
Come and take my hand
My touch is dicine
Rising from the sand
I'm gonna take you high

Taste the dragon tears
Tell me what you feel
Maybe you'll find the answer
Who you really wanna be

You gave me your health
I poisnoed your brain
An hour of pleasure
Became everlasting pain

Taste the dragon tears
Tell me what you feel
Maybe you'll find the answer
Who you really wanna be

I am your veins
I am your veins
In your blood
I shall remain

Holes in your body
Obsession takes control
Longing for more
Before i eat your soul

I give you hell
I know you'll come back
Begging for more
Until everything is black

Your eyes are filled
With confusion
Maybe you life
Is an illusion

Taste the dragon tears
Tell me what you feel
Maybe you'll find the answer
Who you really wanna be

I am your veins
I am your veins
In your blood
I shall remain
