Now i'm here again
Ready for the last ride
Sitting on a lonely cliff
Under a cloudless sky

The moon is the only light
I know they'll come for me
My quest for peace
This time is for real

I have no wishes
There's nothing left
My quest is over
Take me beyond death

This is the end
The painless end

Suddenly they appear
In silence they rode
Can't see their eyes
I don't care anymore

Just take me with you
Freedom is ahead
Lend me a white horse
With eyes so red

High above the ground
I ride through the sky
And before my eyes
My life is passing by

I have no wishes
There's nothing left
My quest is over
Take me beyond death

Through a tunnel of light x2
I leave my body behind x2
Point of no return x2
Finally, peace of mind x2

I have no wishes
There's nothing left
My quest is over
Take me beyond death
