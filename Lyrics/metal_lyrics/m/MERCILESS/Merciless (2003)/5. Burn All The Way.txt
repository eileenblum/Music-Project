Distortion in my head
Don't tell me how it feels
Screaming to hurt me
A wound that never heals
Even though it's killing me
Violent and rough
Can't escape myself
It's never fast enough

Far from passing out
Heart of stone is glowing
I'll run with the pack
Madness is growing
A fictional situation
And i'm overjoyed
Gotta seize this moment
Before it's destroyed

I refuse to fade
I'll burn all the way
Don't wanna be saved
The fire is my grave

I've gotta confess
I've lost all control
Beautiful aggression
Embrace me forever more
Beyond all boundaries
I'm filled with sin
I've fucking lost it
I fear nothing

Stab myself in the back
Shoot nails through my knees
Walk on broken glass
Can't make the anger freeze

I refuse to fade
I'll burn all the way
Don't wanna be saved
The fire is my grave
