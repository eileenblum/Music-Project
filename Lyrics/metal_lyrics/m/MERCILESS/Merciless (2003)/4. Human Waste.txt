Dead end
I'm the one in pain
Smell of lies
You're the one to blame

Would you believe it, if i told ya
Would you believe it, if i showed you

Pointless laughter
You are in despair
Feeding apathy
I don't fucking care
What you dread
I'm the hostile foe
Breeding sickness
Hate me to the core

Would you believe it, if i told ya
Would you believe it, if i showed you

Shine like hell
Damned i'll be forever
The one kept unseen
Feeling sick
Going down again
Wasted and obscene

Coming closer
Cold hand of fate
The scar on my forehead

Useless future
Sickend by our world
Stench of life
Disgusting is the world
A self-made hell
Unable to see
The truth itself
Drown in misery

Would you believe it, if i told ya
Would you believe it, if i showed you

Shine like hell
Damned i'll be forever
The one kept unseen
Feeling sick
Going down again
Wasted and obscene
