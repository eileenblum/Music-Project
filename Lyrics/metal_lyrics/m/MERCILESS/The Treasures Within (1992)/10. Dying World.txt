Bells of damnation ring for me
I can see the clouds of misery
The endless search for immortality
This dying world is all I can see

Curse of loneliness and pain
Inside my head the past appear
Remember the day's of happiness
All that is left is fear
The light is slowly fading away
No reason for me to stay
See the light again I must
Can't see nothing I walk through the dust
No fear of tomorrow
Because there is none
End of all life
Dark is the sun

The smell in the air is so strange
But there's nothing I can change
How long will I stand the pain
Will I die before I go insane

I wonder if there's anything beyond
Is there any hope for me at all
Now it's time for me to pass away
I can hear the bells of death call!

Bells of damnation ring for me
I can see the clouds of misery
The endless search for immortality
This dying world is all I can see
