See what the Gods have sent, an evil terminator
They slept for a thousand years, the ancient tormentor
Strange tunnel of light, a living mystery
Damned is the creator, blackened reality

Useless circle of sadness, a dream for the past
Sadistic mindless Gods, free at last
Die in the wars of madness, this will never ends
Only silence, Armageddon descends

Blood runs fast and free, the result of dark sorcery
Mother earth go back to sleep, grave of oppression so deep

Echoes for a world far beyond
No man ever walk this land
Silence is spread over an endless desert
The skull of a child is lying in the sand

See what the Gods have sent, an evil terminator
They slept for a thousand years, the ancient tormentor
Strange tunnel of light, a living mystery
Damned is the creator, blackened reality

Heavenly angels fell
Forever lost in hell
The world wasn't meant to be saved

Wrath of the Gods
Death to the Gods
Hungry vultures from the grave
