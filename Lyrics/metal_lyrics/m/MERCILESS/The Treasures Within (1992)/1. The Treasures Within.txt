Let them run and hide, the sun is falling
Coming out of nowhere, the dark is calling
Faster than eye can see, the aggression sets in
An outsider in the light, let the night begin
Crying tears of blood, ride the wings of hate
We'll always be the same, the night we dominate

Your wish is our death
In this world of oppression
You can't change our minds
Our drug is aggression
The clouds are passing by
And the night slowly dies
Still the fire is burning
Burning in my eyes

When the night has come to an end
And we see the light again
End of this night of horror
Living through hell and terror

Not for the first time I watch the sky
I still wonder why
I can't be someone else
My soul I will never sell

Your wish is our death
In this world of oppression
You can't change our minds
Our drug is aggression
The clouds are passing by
And the night slowly dies
Still the fire is burning
Burning in my eyes
