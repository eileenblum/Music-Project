Death is not very tragic
If you enter the world of magic
Separate body from soul
And you'll never grow old

Lord of fire make us clean
Light a fire for us to see

Primitive feelings from our hearts
Endless fear of the black arts

Something evil coming soon
The arrival of our doom
Do you believe or do you fear
Do you think the ending is near

I hope you don't have a master
That is the only way
But if you are among those fools
You're gonna die in hell anyway

You cannot accept my disbelief
Your mind is a awful mess
You think you will enter heaven
You're fooled into nothingness
In my world
There's no place for you
You're living in a dream
So don't tell me what to do
