I'm too tired of this life 
All I need is my big sleep 
You are so far away 
You love someone else 

Another day passed me by 
Another day filled with pain 
You are not here 
You're with someone else 

I love you to death 
You love someone else
So I just wanna die 

Create hate 
I hate myself for loving you

"We have touched for the last time
You are long gone, in love with someone else
I now fear nothing but life itself
And I have learned that living is just a slow way to die
I do not believe in life or in love anymore.
The joy I feel are the joys of emptiness
I hate myself for loving you
The fear I feel night after night has developed into a disease
No-one can see the emptiness in my eyes.
To escape life itself now seems the only solution
With relief i look foward of letting go of the pain
Finally... there is peace in my soul
To lie dead without a concern , without a tear,
You own my heart
And life without you is so imensly painful
Just to think of you, talk about you, dream of you makes tears stream down 
my face
I cannot imagine happiness without your beautiful smile, your angelic face, 
your wonderful body and your good heart:
You are everything , I am nothing
I want to die
But really...  I am already dead"

I will not live
