Love me like I love you
Show me your paradise 
Hold me when I hold you 
Desire for you 
Kiss my sweet lips 
Lead me to the sky 

Teach me about all your things 
Your flesh, your blood, your you 
Tell me my love is enough 
Stop running, I'll do
Caress your skin 
Like meadows in the wind 

Beautiful one
