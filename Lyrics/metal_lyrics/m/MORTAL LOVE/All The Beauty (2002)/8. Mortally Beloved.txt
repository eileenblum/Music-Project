Thank you for everything
Every moment you shared 
I appreciated your stay 
Every smile you gave away 

Thank you for leaving 
Now I clearly see the dark
Embraced by agony 
I fear nothing but life 

What's the reason to live if I cannot love 
I can't get over you
What's the reason to live at all

Mortal Love are:
Cat, Gabriah, Lev, Rain6 and Damous 

Additional musicians: 
Zet: Keys and programming, additional guitars and bass on "Hate to feel" 
Tord Rverland Kundsen plays cello on "Falling for you" 

Recorded in SpaceValley studio 2002 
Mastered at Lydmuren
