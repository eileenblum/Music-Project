As the signs grow stronger 
And our fate clearer 
Take no precautions 
Follow your leader 

As our love grows deeper 
And we fill each other
Still admire the darkness 
Let it become larger
As life drifts further

Our beauty is the core 
Always sighing after
Still I crave more 

As hope alone grows higher 
It struggles to be free 
All that we can be 

Fall...demise...all
We're...disguised...gone 

Weep together the rain to come 
Feel at heart, the pain is gone
