My heart is still broken 
Forever my soul is frozen 
Still watching the rain to fall 
Forever standing in the cold all alone 

I'll stay here to the end 
Another day to start 
Another day to break my heart 
With love, still no romance 
The fragile pieces of my soul
Belongs to you 

I hate to feel
I wish I couldn't feel at all 

Don't ask why I have to leave 
Don't know why I still breathe 
Don't understand why I'm still hiding 
All my thoughts for you, saving my
Love for you 
Once again I'm living inside myself
