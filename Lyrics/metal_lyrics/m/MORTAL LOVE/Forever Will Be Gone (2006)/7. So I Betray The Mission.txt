I forget to tell all the bones in your body the end is near
A kiss to bid your heart farewell,
there's nothing left of me to sell

I forgive the end for its suffocating hope and fear
Before I ever wave goodbye - cross my heart and hope to die

You commit to leave all your love behind without a tear
Tomorrow is a different day, another chance to fade away

A million times I'd die for you
but even death can be untrue
Despite the soul I tore apart,
despite the times I drowned my heart

Now I will force my way into the heart
So I betray the mission - fall apart.
