Heavenly memories, born from my desire
Dark is the path deprived
of all but blood-torn hearts

Hellish remembrance is the truth
that shuts my eyes
Blackened, my life, but still I live to breathe the lies

All the beauty I have lost forever will be gone

By your headstone on my knees,
I fail as you've died once again
Torn asunder, falling under
- God, I hate myself
Burning up, I'll always bleed,
this time there's only hell
for me

By your headstone on my knees,
I fail as you've died once again
Torn asunder, falling under
- God, I hate myself
Burn in hell, but live to tell
- there's no remorse for me
For me.
