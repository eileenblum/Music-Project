Did I ever listen to you?
Did I ever stop to think?
Could I ever kill you harder?
Could I bury you any deeper?

With every look I crushed you whole
With every smile I grained your bones
The darkness makes me stronger
And I can swallow it no more

Evil in all shapes
In my case it's cold and hollow
Darkness, it wakes nor sleeps
And this pain you're forced to swallow
