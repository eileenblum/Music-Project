Now close your eyes...

You're present in my sleep you hunt me when I'm awake.
My soul you seem to keep.
My heart will weep again and again and again...

These days? In my head? Make me feel you are the one...
These dreams in my head seem real...

[In my heart]
You're in my heart
You're in my soul
[In my soul]
Want you close
[In my heart]
You're in my heart

You're present in my sleep you hunt me when I'm awake.
My soul you seem to keep my heart will weep again and again and again...

These days? In my head? Make me feel you are the one...
These dreams in my head seem real...

You're in my heart
(In my heart)
You're in my soul
Want you close
(In my soul)
You're in my heart
(In my heart)
You're in my soul
