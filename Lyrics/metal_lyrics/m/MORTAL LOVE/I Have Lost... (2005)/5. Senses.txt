It's no surprise, I'm tainted now
I'm left here in chains
I've become what I despise
Decayed and senseless

The Bitterness in my heart, I take no heed
I can't feel the rain
I've become my own disguise
Deprived of senses

My life in flames, It's all to late
I sleep on thorns but cannot feel the pain

I hate-I hate everything
When I am not with you
