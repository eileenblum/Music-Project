Everything I tried to be
Let the poison into me
All the beauty my sins cost
Everything that I have lost

Everything I tried to do
Whispered me away from you
If you and I cannot be one
Then forever will be gone

Now that I have lost everything

My heart in silence weeps

You are present in my sleep
You haunt me when I'm awake
My thoughts you always seem to keep
Is it too late?
