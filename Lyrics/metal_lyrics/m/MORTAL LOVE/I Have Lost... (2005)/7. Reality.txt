What I wouldnât give for-a chance to feel
What I wouldnât give for-a chance to heal
What I wouldnât give for-a chance to cry
What I wouldnât give for-a chance to die

What I wouldnât give for-a chance to hate
What I wouldnât give for-it's all too late
What I wouldnât give for-a chance to need
What I wouldnât give for-a chance to bleed

All the beauty I feel-I know it's not real
All the beauty I see- will never belong to me

I tried to hide
But I fell apart
Why do I try
To desolate my heart
