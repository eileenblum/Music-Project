Everything dead, dead between us comes alive
And what I say will end up stinging in my own eyes

Under this dark, dark conscience I still strive
I've cried a pool of fear and into this I dive

Lift up your head if you're asleep
Lay down your head if you're awake

It fades away when you're away
But I'm anemic when I'm happy
I loose my way everyday
My memories of time are empty
It fades away when you're away
And now nothing can bleed the surface
