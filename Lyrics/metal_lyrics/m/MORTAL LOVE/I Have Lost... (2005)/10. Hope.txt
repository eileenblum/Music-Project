Just lay me down in shadows deep
But I don't fall asleep the voices say
I'll sleep a while before we meet
This is my last time anyway

Don't let me dream of things I fear
I know now, hope was never true
To lessen pain I keep it near
The only thing I ever learned from you

Everything I do or say
Whispers myself away
Fade from this world
I turn my face
And hope to burn
From this world
