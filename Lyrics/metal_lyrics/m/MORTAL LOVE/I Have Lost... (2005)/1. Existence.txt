It's over it's finished, I am dead inside
I'm not gonna feel anymore
I am dead, please bury me, I am dead

Our relation-creation of dark passion
I am forever sbudued and tranquilized

Your desertion-converting from my eyes
My feelings caught in your jar like fireflies

This sensation-frustrations of simplified minds
My dreams they die as they lie on the naked floor

This dimension-ascension to sullen despair
Your eyes they lie as we cry to the tired sky
