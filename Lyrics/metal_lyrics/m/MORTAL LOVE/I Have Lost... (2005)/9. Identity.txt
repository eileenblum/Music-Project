Endless strife-turns me into a stranger
See your eyes-yes I think you've been here

Revelation-maybe I'm longing to be
Solitude-this is my oblivion

Your fragrance to me- seduction

My eyes-see me for what I am not
My tears-make me feel nothing at all
My heart-has unfolded before me
My life- now I am not longer me
