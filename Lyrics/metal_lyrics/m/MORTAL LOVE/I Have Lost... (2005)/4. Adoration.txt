Pretend you're in my heart
Pretend we'll never part
Everything beautiful dies

With you inside of me
With you I'll never be
Anything else than you

I know my love is gone
I know I don't belong
Everything beautiful dies

Just to feel the taste of love
Intertwine with your inner thoughts
Feel your loving touch
I know you're too far gone

And when I lay me down to sleep
The stars above me bright and far away... like you
