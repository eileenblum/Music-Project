Your shadow on the wall, I'm searching for answers
I think you turn me around
My cold, cold love feeds my intention
In my heart there's a hellish creation

My broken heart leaves my mind in pieces
Temptation brings the storm to my life
This is my theatre of tragedy
I share with you my pain

Your shadow on the wall, I'm searching for answers
No time to turn it around
I hope this pain, will cure my disease
I think this pain, will put me at ease

I know I'm self-destructive, I keep letting myself down
But my life in chaos always kills it in the end
This is the sin
For I have been loved
This is the sin
This is my sin
It's my betrayal
