For how long can I keep you spinning
In this downward spiral?
I know it's much too late but still
Still I keep using you

And how far will I let you slip
In this bottomless pit?
I cannot rest my thoughts on you

So I'll leave you this way
Forever and anon torn
I've lost my passion and my soul
Still rain pours from the darkened sky

Leave me in this darkness
Dreams of me only poison your sleep
Leave me now I am heartless
Dreams of me only make your heart weep
