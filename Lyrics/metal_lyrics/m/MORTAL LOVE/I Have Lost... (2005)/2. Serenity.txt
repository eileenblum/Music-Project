I had to get my mind off you
I had to stop pretending 'cause we're through
I'll go somewhere you can't reach me
Somewhere you cannot hurt me

I had to see through your lying
The way you treated me is why I'm dying
I'll never think of you again
For you and me this is truly the end

You'll never break my heart again
I won't let you
