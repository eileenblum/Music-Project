Flames are crawling up on my face
I'm running after my shade
Out of sunlight and into darkness

Into my crypt of fear
Into my crypt of fear

Out of sunlight
Into darkness

I'm chased by my own fear
The unholy master is watching me
Is it him the Devil, that are torturing me
Close my coffin and let me be/see

Into my crypt of fear

Out of darkness
Into the twilight

I feel like a demon in the night
Flames are crawling like pets on me
the shades aren't here to see
with my master the Devil my friend
my soul will slave for eternity.
