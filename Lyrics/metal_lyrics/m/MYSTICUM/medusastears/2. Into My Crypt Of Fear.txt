Flames are crawling upon my face 
I'm running after my shade 
Out of sunlight and into darkness 
Into my crypt of fear 

Into my crypt of fear 
Out of sunlight 
Into Darkness 
I'm chased by my own fear 

The unholy master is watching me 
Is it Him the devil that is torturing me 
Close my coffin and let me see 

Into my crypt of fear 
Out of darkness 
And into the twilight 
I feel like a demon in the night 

Flames are crawling like pets on me 
The shades aren't here to see 
With my master the devil my friend 
My soul will slave for eternity 

[Mysticum 1992]
