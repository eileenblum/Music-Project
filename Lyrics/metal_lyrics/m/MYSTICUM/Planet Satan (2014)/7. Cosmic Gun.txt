Waiting for you our giving star.
Stronger than billions of suns. 
Unleash your power from far away.
And fire your cosmic gun.

At the speed of light, your jet of death.
Will make the earth a charcoaled sphere.
The end of time will then be here.
The extinction of life and death.

When you decide to finally burst.
You will quench our infernal thirst.
To converge us back to stellar dust.
Pure and free from human disgust.
