The commodore of it and all.
Leading the armadas from Hell.
Racing through space and time.
On to the gates to fight...

Pearls are shattered by the fist.
Soon the heavens will cease to exist.
Completing the task of trinity Ìs fall.
Cause we will win the war, and we will kill them all.

Listen to our ecstasy. 
Embrace it and it will.
Be the seed of clarity. 
Which, germinates from within.

Behold the power of Satan. 
It unlights and fills your soul. 
Clears your spiritual ignorance. 
This power belongs to us all.
