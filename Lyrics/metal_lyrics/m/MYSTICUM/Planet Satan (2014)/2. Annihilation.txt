Wake up in darkness and fear what's coming.
Screaming sirens of chaos howling. 
Frantic people everywhere, kneeling and crying.
Crawling in despair, humans dying. 

Inter-dimensionalâs marching on..
Black magic program is now upon,
The worthless human population.
The only solution, annihilation.

The noise from earthlings have finally stopped.
The sound of bones and skulls that pop.
From under the iron belts that rolls.
And over human piles the angels fall.
The noise from earthlings have finally stopped.
And over human piles stands angel false.

Inter-dimensionalâs marching on..
Black magic program is now upon,
The worthless human population.
The only solution, annihilation.

Wings flapping, demons clapping.
For the father they're attacking.
With hellish force and eternal might.
Angel of light, Lucifer shines bright!

Wake up in darkness and fear what is coming.
Screaming sirens of chaos howling.
Frantic people everywhere, kneeling and crying.
Dying humans everywhere.
