Infernal titan, colossal strength.
It of all and all of It.
King in the sea of entropy.
Realizer of Lucifer's prophecy.

Beyond its limit of no return.
Countless worlds have passed.
Creation, crushed and consumed.
With all their life and gods.

Feasting on the Universe.
Devourer of life and light.
Expanding, absolute dark.
Ending the final end.

In this all of emptiness.
Time will no longer be.
The cosmic certain property.
Of past, now and eternity.
