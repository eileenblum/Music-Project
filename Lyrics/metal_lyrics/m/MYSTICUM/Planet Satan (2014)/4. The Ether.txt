The name is Satan, It's the fire...
We desire, we're the flame.
Together as one here we come.
Bringing pure Armageddon.

Kneel before us, the murderers of God.
Slaying angelics and their christian dogs.
A perfect part of evilution.
The ultimate final cosmic conclusion.

Paved in the blood of God and the Son.
Is its victorious triumphic path.
Celebrating to the beat and the sound.
Of the cult of Mysticum.
