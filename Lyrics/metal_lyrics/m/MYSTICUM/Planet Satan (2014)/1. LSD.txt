Picture yourself in a boat on a river.
Sailing down the streams of inferno.
Into this lake of eternal flames - from below the arising abyss.
What's that glittering in the sky?
Waves of crystalined spectrum light.
Flaming hordes from hell I sight.
Or is this all in my mind?
The triplet-number flashes the sky.
The gate of inferno open and wide.
My burning eyes sees my demon
And then I become ...
Lucifer in the skies with demons
Lucifer undisguised
Storming troops of Satan is crushing.
Nirvana and ruptures its foundations.
Heavenly landscapes through clouds are falling.
Blasted to pieces by the sunshine explosion.
Lucifer, triumphator of angels is calling.
Victorious trumpets while heaven is falling.
Laughter and pleasure of evil is sprawling.
The demon inside of me is finally calming
