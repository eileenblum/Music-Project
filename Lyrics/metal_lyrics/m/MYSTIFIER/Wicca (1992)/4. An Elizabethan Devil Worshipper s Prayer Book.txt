my black book of demon's doctrine
writing in latin on fine paper and bound in leather
my diabolic parchment with some cabalistic symbols,
magic circles and sortileges
my precious book which I use to do my exhortations and
a variety of black magick rites
to satisfy my excitations and carnal pleasures
immoral book of conspiracy with satan

two candles of human fat illuminate my altar
the great omnipotent goat sits on the pentagram
in my left hand a magick sword of black handle
and on the table a golden chalice with blood

my satanic ritual is beginning

in my prophane ceremony of submission to the evil
I perform it dressed as the devil
my disciples devote themselves to terror, joy and sensuality
I prepare the hosts of communion with flour, excrements,
pus and blood of menstruation
they use it as artificial anus and vagina
they copulate it ferociously
shouting that they're sodomizing jesus and deflorating the virgin

I recite the words of spell
from my black book of a lost time
a sacrifice to the omnipotent
my satanic ritual has just begun

crumbing the consecrated host
and blaspheming yhvh
mandrake root, juice of aconite and unholy water are my artifacts
profanation and bestiality

by the face of the unholy majesty and
by the beasts in front of the throne
I conjure them
oh princes and demons of darkness

lucifer, bacchus, sucubus,
astarte, incubus and belphegor
I summon you!!!

I know that you are here!!!
