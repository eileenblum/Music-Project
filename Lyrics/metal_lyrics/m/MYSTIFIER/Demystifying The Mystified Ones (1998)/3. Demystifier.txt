a mind without religion
the superiority in flesh
without limitations or obstructions
the way for immortality
horror of the mysteries of the world
nor all questions have answers
believing without proof
the mankind's suffering

demystifying
is god a mistake of man?
mystifying
is man a mistake of god?
impiety
listen to me

I am the guardian of your sins
rebel against the church
the slaver

believing in everything that is imposed for you
the truth is invisible in your eyes
believing in everything that you don't see, play or hear
the abdication puts back your life and the penitence calls the death

years of abdication and penitence
where's your reward?
now it is so clear in my eyes
live.
