cross your fingers, hold breath
the omen is approaching
knock on wood, shut up your mouth
a misfortune will happen
don't walking under a ladder, close your eyes
the bad luck follows you
avoid a black cat, take a shelter
you are in danger!

wizards foresee my dark future
witches predict my misfortune
priests ask me to pray
I pledged my life!

damned mongers of the destiny
they amuse with my innocence
how can I disbelieve of them?
if they have my destiny in their hands

crossed my fingers, held my breath
I lost my faith
knocked on wood, shut up my mouth
I lost my honor
didn't walking under a ladder, closed my eyes
I lost my dignity
avoided a black cat, took shelter
I lost all my hope

wizards foresee my dark future
witches predict my misfortune
priests ask me to pray
I pledged my life!

damned mongers of the destiny
they amuse with my innocence
how can I disbelieve of them?
if they have my destiny in their hands

false superstitions torment my mind
I don't need those lies to live my life
