waiting for centuries for the coming of the godsend.
to restore the temple and the faith in the land.
no turning his face and no forgiving the enemies.
people don't care, but the new messiah's appearance is imminent

is he evil or good?
the scriptures don't lie
he will rule the world
this world of illusions

as david's chariots, he destroys our enemies
by peace he also shall destroy many countries
jerusalem is again the center of the world
now the people of god can rule the world

is he evil or good?
the scriptures don't lie
he will rule the world
this world of illusions

now those who dwell upon earth shall worship the ruler
if your name is in the book of life, erase it!
join the temple of domination

free of the persecution
we conquer the promised land

(among us, he lives)

feast in the enemies' blood
their blood is our wine

(among us, he lives)

a new era begins
the long-waited messiah prophases

although your acts reflect as evil you are.
I can give you the good you don't deserve
