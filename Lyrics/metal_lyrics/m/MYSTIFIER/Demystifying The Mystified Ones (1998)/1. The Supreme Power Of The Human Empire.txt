cursed to prowl in this world
prisoners of the world
creeping like worms in the desert
blind by the wills
the ambition restrains the human condition
we have had more downs than ups in life

tormented by all afflictings that hurts our minds
we face the sun and do our last...

who did create this world of ignorance?
who did create this world of suffering?
who did create this world of hate?
who did create this world of alienation?

enthroned in the human misery

pain
it runs in our veins
pain
it feeds our flesh
pain
who doesn't rejoice in pain?
pain
praise our destruction
