when thou startest to shine in the east
early in the morning
my eyes sparkle like diamonds with great anxiety to see thee
then thou risest wonderfully
my eyes flow that holy human water. the nectar of the gods
in thy reverence
please, don't think that my tears are snares to catch thee
i do would like to imprision thee in a bottle
to have the pleasure of contemplate thee every morning
to live my last days under thy care
the mindless ones try to profane thee
they are caught in the web of ignorance
whose the net of threads they will never be able to get rid of
for the joy of few thou hastn't degenerated
becoming our vice, our food, our water,
our blood, our hope, ourselves
turn thy face to earth, cast us a merciful look,
enlighten these poor children lost in this vale of misery
thy worshippers chant in adoration
thou art immortal
imagine if the women were like thee
thou art immortal
perhaps the earth could be a good place to live
thou art immortal
who created thee was with the dirty hands
thou art immortal
of blood, milk, sugar and oil
thou art immortal
thou art red meaning blood and life
thou art immortal
thou art white meaning pureness
thou art immortal
thou art sweet meaning goodness
thou art immortal
thou art black meaning the occult
i neither wanna put thee to sleep with my song
nor catch thee in the bottle
i love thee and want thee free
freedom is the essence of our eternal love
we know the secret of immortality
please, never leave me alone in this dark and sorrowful world
o great magickal agent of my dreams
who inspirest me and enlightenest me
rise up, express thy internal and external attributes
be red, white, sweet and black
i wouldn't hesitate in choose thee the most beautiful
among the goddesses
remove thy veil - the clouds. show us thy face and grace
