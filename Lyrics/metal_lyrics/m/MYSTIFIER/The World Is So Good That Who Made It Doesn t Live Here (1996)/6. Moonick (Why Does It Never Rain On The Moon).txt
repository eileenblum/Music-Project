alone in this room without light
i don't know, if it is day or night
they've drugged me day after day
my friends are the phantoms of my nightmares
but i will try to solve this problem
someone shall hear my pitiful cries
wrapped in this endless silence
if you are hearing my plea
please, bring me the key
open that door - take me out from this place
save me - if you may not do it, i'll commit suicide
i think that's the only way to escape from this
none from heaven has heard me
i've turned my back to them
if someone anywhere help me
i will pawn him my considerable love know-how
this is my only wealth which i can barter for my freedom
illusion - this is one of the many drugs i've used
imagination - it is the way to survive in this
horrible and empty place
am i dreaming or becoming crazy ?
a source of light is growing
from the corner of the ceiling
that is coming to me
i'm trembling with fear
the apparition scares me
does that bring me something
to rescue me from this desolated isle ?
if it is a dream, i hope don't awake
i'll face the unknown
to return to the world
to recover my sanity
to see again my parents
to meet again my friends
be as the destiny likes
"i'm the moon.
the key which will open that door for you
my messenger azaradel will teach you a moonick spell
now, close your eyes, sleep and dream
reveal him your occult desire"
"at midnight. when the moon be full
face her and whispper the following words:
"as thou influencest the tide and men's mind,
open the doors of the destiny for me
as thy face shinest in the dark
my desires shall realize"
matter and spirit are incompatible
i don't know if it'll accomplish
but, who knows ?"
every door is opening
the spell became true
he is free to fly high
higher than his dreams
bright as a star
the loneliness torn me into pieces
but thou hast helped me
now i am here to fulfil my promise
now, you close your eyes. why ?
because i'm going to make rain on the moon
