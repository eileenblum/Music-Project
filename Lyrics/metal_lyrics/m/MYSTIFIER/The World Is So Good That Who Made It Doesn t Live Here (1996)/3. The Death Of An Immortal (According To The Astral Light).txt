there are two ways according to the laws of the universe
one starts when the another ends
one is limited and the another is unlimited
you just know the second passing through the first
now between the sword and the cross
we shall meet it with courage
sed lex. dura lex
a friend of mine
he died with a thousand of dreams in mind
to climb the stairs to heaven with honour to meet his imaginary god
a man who made never for himself and other people
is he worthy of a so wonderful end ?
the law of the return - the law of the laws
it has always warned us about our insanity
now listen to the sentence for our omission
hey! have a look as your corpse is so dirty
hey! have a look as your spirit is so weight
black was your past, is your present and wiil be your future
the earth rejects you
the heaven has closed its gates
prowl, carcass and spirit, through the darkness
and reflect about your sins
why must i pay for my faults now ?
i'm still alive. first, you should doom them
i'll be the last one
i don't wanna be an example for them
i don't wanna die on the cross
it's a fruit from that same old tree
contaminated and full of worms
the cure ? let's not talk about it
the fear of the unknown dismays them
sometimes the result comes late
but the consequences are worst
disincarnated still acting as a spiritless
which sentence is worst than this ?
the death of an immortal
