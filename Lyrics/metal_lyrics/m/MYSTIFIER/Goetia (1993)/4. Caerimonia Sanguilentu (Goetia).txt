trois-echelles, charles ix's magician, was accused of witchery by inquisitors
he confessed to the king that he given himself over to a demon
who enable him to perform prodigies
he asked to the king: "am I forgaven?"
the king forgave him for his misdeeds

but if he had a relapse
the king promised his cure on the gallows
he did a relapse and was hanged in due course
he swore to the king avenge by the uncontrollable power of black magick
a malign disease will abate king charles ix

the years were going and now the king is on his dying bed praying against death
on the twenty eighth day of may fifteen seventy four
near the dying hour, the king consults necromancers about his disease
he said:"remedy or magic either will be able to cure me!!"

the necromancers examined charles ix and were troubled with him
they think the king was bewitched by a malign work (goetia)
only the bloody ceremony can reveal the cause of disease
but there's hardly chance to king can recover

the necromancers perform a ceremony at midnight in the presence of the king
a young jew is brought all dressed of body linen prepared to communion
on an altar in which the image of satan treads on a crucifix
a necromancer consecrates two black and white hosts

the white host is given to the jew
after he is thrown at stairs from the altar and is decaptated by necromancer
now his head is placed upon the black host on the paten
the demon is invoked to answer through jew's head

the necromancer asks to charles ix to put a question mentally to the head
a moment of panic and expectation
the dead lips agitate and say:"vim patior"
finally the answer is given also mentally to the king who falls to back
and shouts:"remove this head from here now!!!"

on the following day at dying hour, the king repeats those words said
by him in the ceremony
in the hands of death, he sweats blood and dies
trois-+chelles' prediction was accomplished
