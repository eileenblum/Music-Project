while the night falls a gloomy mist covers the earth
the wild child will come to light
the holy symbols tremble and the glitter of joy is sad
the lord's son of evil soon will be among us

antichristus will come. the bells begin to ring solemnly
antichristus will come. the satanists wait for their deity

at midnight was born the prodigal son of evil
the satanists show to the wild child his new realm
he rejoices and promises the elixir of imortality to us
yhvh and jesus christ prepare to battle against antichristus

antichristus arrived. he chalenges his apponents to fight
antichristus arrived. yhvh and jesus christ hesitate face the invitation

yhvh commands his kerubs
jesus christ commands his angels
antichristus commands his demons
kerubs and angels attack and murder some demons from antichristus' battalion
he becomes furious and calls for the mighty gods of evil

lucifer sends unseen demons fulminate the angels
pazuzu blows and throws dust in the eyes of the kerubs
behemoth uses his brutal force against the kerubs
astaroth murders the last live kerubs
beelzebub sends a bunch of flies to molest the angels
asmodeus tramples the angels with his chariot of fire
moloch devours the remains of the angels and the kerubs
belial announces the victory of the realm of antichristus

look as the rust corrodes the golden palace of heaven
the rays become frozen in the hands of yhvh
jesus christ prowls alone in the vale of tears
antichristus salutes the mighty gods of evil

antichristus won. the bells ring solemnly
antichristus won. the evil deity says loudly:
"my triumph over yhvh was an example to others"
