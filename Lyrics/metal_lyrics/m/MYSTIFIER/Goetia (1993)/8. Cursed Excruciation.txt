i've suffered in the name of god
his words serve me as consolation
for a life of martyrdom and pain
i've lived like a slave of my god

o satanas save my soul
free me from this nightmare
i'll obey your laws
I won't underestimate your wisdom

now i'm going to break the ten commandements made on stone
and despise the seven words of christ
o satanas, now I want only serve thee
thou art my new lord who will instruct me

o satanas save my soul
free me from this nightmare
i'll obey your laws
I won't underestimate your wisdom
