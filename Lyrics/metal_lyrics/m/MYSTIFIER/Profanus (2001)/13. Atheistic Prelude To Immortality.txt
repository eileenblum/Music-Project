Why does religion need the darkness to shine?.
Does fear feed the Devil or the human mind?.
There's no god above us or below us.
Deny Jesus Christ and wake out its followers.

Some mysteries is beyond men's comprehension.
Enigmatic questions dwell in our imagination.
Knowledge has sunk beneath the sands of stupidity.
How can anyone promise the immortality?.

Do you believe that a god created this world?.
Do you believe that suffering means salvation?.
Do you believe that humankind is inferior?.
Do you believe that we are a perfect creation?.

The key of world's creation is beyond humankind's alienation.
Those religious buildings obstruct the sight.
The key of world's creation is beyond humankind's alienation.
Those religious buildings obstruct the light.

Do you believe that we were born from the dust?.
Do you believe that a god could die on the cross?.
Do you believe that Satan's home is below us?.
Do you believe that Nazarene's hang was a bitter loss?.

The key of world's creation is beyond humankind's alienation.
Those religious buildings obstruct the sight.
The key of world's creation is beyond humankind's alienation.
Those religious buildings obstruct the light.

Living according to own vision.
Believe in the word of reason.
No mental or spiritual oppression.
No slavemaster will obstruct our progression.
