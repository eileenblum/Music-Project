Believed being this world.
The most wonderful of the worlds.
The will and its illusions.
Culminate in illusions of disillusions.
If suffering doesn't take part of one's life.
He lives out of the edges of the mind.

Feel the pain cuts to the heart.
Living in this land is so hard.

Who did create this world of illusion?.
Who did create this world of suffering?.
Who did create this world of pain?.
Who did create this world of alienation?.

Enthroned in the supreme power of suffering.

Pain.
Will be all suffering in vain?.
Pain.
The flesh is so weak.
Pain.
Who doesn't rejoice in pain?.
Pain.
The spirit is willing.

Believed being the immortality the joy of the gods.
Reflection on impending death changed that thought.
The will is blind; it wishes what the eyes can't see.
Turning the will into suffering.
Death is the final plea.

Living the last days of the world's demise.
Nobody found the earthly paradise.

Who did create this world of illusion?.
Who did create this world of suffering?.
Who did create this world of pain?.
Who did create this world of alienation?.

Enthroned in the supreme power of suffering.
