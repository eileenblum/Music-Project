Waiting for centuries the coming of the godsend.
To restore the temple and the faith in the land.
No turning his face, no forgiving the enemies.
People don't care, but the messiah's appearance is imminent.

Is he evil or good?.
Are the scriptures lies?.
Will he rule this world?.
Our world of illusion.

As David's chariots, he destroys our enemies.
By peace, he also shall destroy many countries.
Jerusalem is again the center of the world.
Now the avenger of god can rule the world.

Is he evil or good?.
Are the scriptures lies?.
Will he rule this world?.
Our world of illusion.

Now those who dwell upon Earth shall worship the ruler.
If your name is in the book of life, erase it.
Join the temple of domination.

Free of the persecution.
We conquer the Promised Land.

Among us, he lives.

Feast in the enemies' blood.
Their blood is our wine.

Among us, he lives.

A new era begins.
The long awaited messiah prophesies.

Although your acts reflect as evil you are.
I can give you the good you don't deserve.
