From hallucinations, thou hath been born.
Bright like a falling star.
Born from men's rib or from men's dream.
Come out second universe's being.

You don't have my consent to taste my feast.
I will resist.
Born from men's dreams.
As a serpent twisting in delight.
Be enchanted with my tricks.
You won't resist.
Born from men's dreams.

Man's dream daughter seduces me and refuses me.
I am just one more character in thy game.
I don't know if I am living a nightmare or just a dream.
Come ahead untamable being.

O Mother Witch.
Every night on pagan rites.
Thou hath been a delight for my eyes.

O Mother Lust who gave birth to my desires.
Thou hath put my semen burning as fire.

If tears are her favorite weapon.
In tears I abdicate my wisdom.
