When I close my eyes.
A voice resounds in my mind.
Kill. Kill. Thou shalt kill.
You were born to kill.
This is the time to face my fate.
Knives, guns and mace.
My arsenal is ready to kill.
Cross my way and you will feel.

Die.
Fall onto your knees.
Beg for mercy.
Dare to face the Beast.
Fall onto your knees.
Beg for mercy.
Dare to face the beast.

An angel told me details of my affair.
I am the spark to begin the warfare.
I was born in lust and sin.
Just follow my human instinct.
Blood is the wealth to buy my freedom.
Now I shall get my weapons.
The hate that was hidden in my soul.
It comes to reality out of control.

Then the beast rose from his throne.
Enthroned in a mountain of bones.
Slaughtering the ones who were born.
From the same womb.

Desolated plains.
Life no longer exists.
Savagery and pain.
Drowned in a lake of tears.
