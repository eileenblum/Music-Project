The pale figure of the holy bastard.
Bleeds on the cross.
It is the root of all evil.
Feel its stink on the cross.
A false martyr paying for our sins.
I can't make any apology for the crucified.
Immortal enemy of the christians' dream.

What does the cross mean?.
It is just a pipedream.
I doubt miracles and words of salvation.
A wolf in sheep's skin.
Don't judge me for my sins.
It isn't worthy of my consternation.

Je$$us.
Don't molest my brain.
Je$$us.
Resurrect to die.
Je$$us.
Suffer in my name.
Je$$us.
It was blamed to die.

Priests.
I've found hundreds of lies.
Reading the book of the liars.
Believers.
Suffering and martyrdom are words.
I scratch out from my mind.
