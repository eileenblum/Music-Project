In feeling comfortable with corpses and admiring, their conventional lifestyle, because it isn't mine.
And now they'll feel, and now you'll feel.
I hope to never feel your cold and lifeless grip upon me.
For this I've prayed. I'm left unanswered.
With light leaking out towards, wraps around the night and finally, I will witness your dismantling.
I will. And so we plea with horror.
This will be. So we leave in horror. This will be.
As I, as I remember please do let this blood poor slowly down.
And in the format of slaughter. Dressed in their finest and ready for war, he who believes they should suffer.
What have you done to become something I'm not? And I'll never be.
This horror is for real, and in the final phased infection, slowly will bring you to your knees.
Horror. And you'll feed off this.
Through all I'm alone. I'm alone. Now die alone. Through all.
I'm alone. I'm alone.
