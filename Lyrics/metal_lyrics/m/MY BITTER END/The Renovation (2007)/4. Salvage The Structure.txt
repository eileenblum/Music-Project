Salvage what's left, start from the ground up. Make room again. To start from the ground up.
I can't build a dream over and over. It's horribly bold.
Salvaging structures in hope returning. In turn we must change everything. Eyes of fire.
Sending word over the surface. Eyes of liars. Tearing their wings at the surface. I can see what went
on when they fold. It's a spawned liberation, swarming like low effort blows.
So it's too late too cold. Stop the storm. And suffer yields. Season went down.
It's a dead end life list. We will prevail, and start from the ground up. We will prevail, and start from the ground up.
Find someway. We built the way out. Spawning time, the dawn of life.
Love reset too. So we draw this out. I doubt i see. A city crumbling.
Tear apart and within time, rebuild life, gather life. So we can.
