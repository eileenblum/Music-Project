Now the water is rising, up to meet us above the ground, and the setting of tides still life.
Life was a fury you falsely denied it's talking back, and now the water is raising, and now the water is rising.
My time, to see sleep coming.
Try out, the sleep that we rely on.
They let their sons just fucking drown, let them fucking drown.
Now I will stay afloat, and I will abandon the ones I've claimed to love.
Sleep. And I will abandon the ones I love.
Ease time by.
It's deep besides, the sea is storming through with ease, and the service of this day will read.
As we float lifeless.
Drift through this place, everyone looks the same but we float.
As we float. As we float. Lifeless sleep.
This water crashes towards the ground where we all and this water is blamed, a shame, the errors of love.
Black water decays away what we once called our own, leaving the wreck something retched and old.
Loved what we owned.
Leave it to god to leave us or throw us aside.
Miserable. As we float, as we still float, we'll still float...
No love lost, seize upon the dead now I will lay in rubble.
Pain. No pain.
