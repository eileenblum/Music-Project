Now.
In giving hell for this, I have learned to depend.
Consciously browse, let the diversity ground.
Socially ground, leaving a cautiously effortless hole.
Something to stop it.
But something to go with.
It torments me slow; you've watched the apathy grow.
This ends now.
We've been here since the best came.
We died to grow.
Gave myself in error to the little spark but weather and I've been blessed.
As a toll.
Smile now, somehow I will see you out, remedy.
Remedy.
The turn of our balance, it's so delicately. Flawlessly.
I'll take all you flawlessly and finally we stand flawlessly, flawlessly we.
Tear us apart; tear us right where we came into.
So we're bound to reflect what I've sent final.
Bow down bowing down, bow down.
So pick a cell.
Never be a evicted.
Seek all.
