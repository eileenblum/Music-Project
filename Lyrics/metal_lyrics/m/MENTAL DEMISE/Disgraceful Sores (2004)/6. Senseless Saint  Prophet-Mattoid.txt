Anomal error of inflamed brain,
Give birth to sick-mental brilliant delirium...
It oppressed the masses... Minds are admires...
The birth of new, merciless idol,
Demand the new victims of the senseless saint...
Thousand eyes are looking greedily to psycho-hypnosis
Of oral diarrhea's flushed fanatic -
Let all will choke with "holy blood"!
The pages of mankind, strewing with bones,
Damp cellars, packed with the dead,
behind the doors with the cross.
"Saint" is smile - fell the soot of human meat,
An millions of corpses formed fertile stratum of soil on the planet...
Earth, spit out the whole of pus&amp; ashes of millenniums to the surface!
Let the miasmas of matter to suffocate the crowd
Of fanatical bastards, whose drink warm blood... warm blood...
For the name of "Saint"; whose shed blood &amp; pull out guts
To another "Saint"; let the piles of bones to bury under dust...
An carcasses of the "Saint" in his all weak multitude...
...In the fucking holy madness new gods will rebirth...
Senseless saint... Prophet-mattoid...
