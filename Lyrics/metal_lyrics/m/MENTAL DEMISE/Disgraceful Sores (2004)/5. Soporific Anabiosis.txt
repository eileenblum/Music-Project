Alien steel cuts through the vein, poison in tubes...
Euphoria!
Deadly bliss, pseudoextasy,
Death with ruse is cheat you, - small fuckin' man!
It gave you sweet mind's demise,
And so cruel tortures of the flesh...
Slowly rotting alive, with the dirty twisted mirrors of eyes.
Poor shitty refuse, you make yourself an organic lumber by your own hands!
Life returned to you again, but you must be fucking dead!
Dead in gloomy delirium of soporific anabiosis!
Stained blood teems with shit, turbid saliva of thoughts
Running, as from oligophrenic mouth...
There is no way for you back!
Warmy blood mixed with malefic liquid.
Gore contagioned - brain defeated,
Dose by dose - foot by foot down...
It's a real plot of soporific dream -
Tragedy of comatose being!
