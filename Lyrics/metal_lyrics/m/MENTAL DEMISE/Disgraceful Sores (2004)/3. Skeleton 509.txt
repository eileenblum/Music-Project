Skeleton 509 raises empty eyes to dark sky,
Urges of weary body make the flesh moving hardly...
Among the grey confused pile of skeletons, covered by skin,
Corpses are visible, they mixed with the living creatures...
A narrow barrack fill with stench of defecations looks like a crypt...
Skeleton 509 comes up to nearest carcass
And starts to tear by sharky teeth in the bleeding gums
Tight cold and stinkest dead meat,
A spark of life doesn't want to die out!
Gore of deceased coagulates in thrombosis,
Stench of death, chorus of the groans -
Skeleton 509 wanna live...
Bulldozers drill ditches packed with corpses
And mill exhausted bodies.
Dim sun is hidden into the smoke of crematorium...
A bulk of human ashes is discharged from the scorching stoves,
Human ashes generously feed death's seeds!
Skeleton 509 - the same as they are all:
He will die under mass of cadavers,
His emaciated corpse will be thrown into trench, into the nowhere...
The heaps of human wastes will be smashed by the tracks!
Piles of the mash will be burning cooly... but now skeleton is tearing
And chewing the rotten meat; many years of struggle
For effort to survive have made him zombiefying skeleton.
He will be devoured, maybe too...
Dreadful phenomenon of human mind - slow, mockering fucking murder!
Eternal war transformed people to it slaves,
Skeletons-victims-are walking in the endless rank...
