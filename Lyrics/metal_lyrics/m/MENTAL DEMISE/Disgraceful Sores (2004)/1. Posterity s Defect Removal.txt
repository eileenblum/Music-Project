All that shit, which we are pump in ourselves
Not pass with impunity -
Fair nature in all powerful rage
Cruelly revenge us:
And we are propagate monsters &amp; imperfect ones
Against our fucking will.
Infants - imbecils, idiots, cripples -
Are shameful spit to human face!
What will be with them, when their
Careless parents die?
Defective posterity is left to live -
It is reputed to be humanity...
People are call it an pity, but you must peer attentively
At this empty absurd eyes- they don't ask about mercy...
They can't see &amp; can't understand that crying mockery
At their being.
Their life is worst the death - they are unfit
Genetic trash, involuntary parasites.
On the body of society; disgraceful sores of the mankind.
Bleeding wounds of your levity, -
The human race is filled with wastes...
It's bad to see the black sheep,
Kill them at birth! Relieve suffering.
Of the half-people, erase birth defects.
Clean up planet from invalid tenants...
Conduct the necessary manipulations,
On the farmyard of human existence.
A cruelty of conditions provokes extreme reactions!
A thought about the uselessness and inability of pieces of meat,
Which never bring a due payment to those,
Who copulates for they shall live!
Defective posterity is left to live -
It is reputed to be humanity...
Slay it!
