Welcome to disaster of totsk 54 -
It's an implacable bloody reality!
Being artificially created, the town that has never existed,
Became an insane crescendo of mass destruction progress!
Unlucky crowd with broken from birth mentality,
Servilly followed the unhuman orders of fanatical degenerates...
They were in the ignorance, couldn't suspected about cruel plans
Of totalitarism... monstrous blast, roar of disturbing
Hydrogenous monster.
Civilization strides to the self-extermination,
Threatening unknown, smoky "mushroom" - what's that?
It is blood! It is gushing out from the torn ear drums,
Vessels in brain burst, red deadly mist in the eyes...
Incandescent fiery whirlwind tears off meat from the bones.
Carbonized bits of people writhing on the cracked black ground.
Nobody will understand, what was happened...
You are worthless martyrs!
Your contemptible lives were sacrificed in the name of annihilation
Next similar victims of nuclear tribulation!
Moloch of cold war callously grinds your innocent souls,
Terrifying stage is completed!
