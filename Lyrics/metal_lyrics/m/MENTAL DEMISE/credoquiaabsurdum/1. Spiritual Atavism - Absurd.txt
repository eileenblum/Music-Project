Impartial look on past centuries
Is compel to unpleasantly surprised...
The small heap of greedy men
Rise on throne of theirs dark ignorance
Monster-symbol bloody fantasies &amp; low bents...
Disaster, calamities were collapsed on mankind...
Epileptically exalts you're fall down in reality...
Aspires to illusive Absolute, nails yourself to the cross
Corporal sufferings; streams of blood are fed an bloody events...
...Inquisition of the conscience &amp; body...
Personification of the madness in practice of the century-extermination...
The most of low passions - vengeance,
A spite in the weakness, venomous hypocrites...
Imperious passive bastards are lies...
They hide their hands behind the back,
Their hands by elbow in blood...
...Desolation... Spiritual vacuum... Dominates... Dominates...
In the human consciousness; regress &amp; decadence...
Atmosphere of suffering- indispensable atavism...
It lives in you from birth to gravestone:
"Obey, you, piece of dirt! Sinful slave, peccatum originale on you!"
Dogma of mistake, absurd of existence, self - parasitism!
We will rest in the dust; we'll never see enlightenment...
Irony: every person is biologic thrash
Natural link in circulation of bacteriums,
In circulation of the matter in the Cosmos...
Atavism... Absurd...
