In essence, helpless human race
Is destroying by pitiless nature...
Storming elements, rage &amp; might of the Hiding, Imposing &amp; Cruel.
Primitive two-legged were trembled watching
The death of similar ones...
Invisible living creatures are brings the deceases.
Agonizing enigma of death... so, that's enough - we are too weak!
The vain effort - the human mask is totally cover by its illusion
All, that we fear...
Dreadful... the faceless powers are inaccessible, personified
Are realizing...
Delirium of pristine notions among the sinister phenomenons,
Mental processing of your reckless fear &amp; panic...
Successful psevdohallucination-creation of "omnipotent god"
Neutralize the nature's dread, arsenal of twisted notions,
Borned by need to compensate for the damned human worthless...
...Human worthless...
Vicious, lazy, greedy human minds are satisfied.
Dogma, coming from the darkness of ignorance, - is effective:
Credo quia absurdum... unfit product of mental activity is spreading
Infection for millenniums...
Eroding abstraction, which calling "a god", is unobvious, -
(The one sober reasoning is enough!)
Disgusting sight - enormous masses of human muck,
Hysterical muttering the fucking prayers of "holy escape"...
Credo quia absurdum: violent invasion of obtrusive limits
Of the spirit's progress bring likeness -
Collective neurosis...
In essence, helpless human race is destroying
By pitiless nature...
Blessing hallucinating confusing of thoughts,
State of religious ecstasy...
Will go to the pieces with fatal steady of process of the growth.
Of self-cognition on way to Logos...
