[Music &amp; Lyrics: Scott Brierley]

Blinded by the dark
Imprisoned by the night
Internal fire gone cold
Hope cast from my soul

Pale lies the mist
Clouding my eyes
Bereft of sleep's embrace
No heed to my silent cries

[Chorus]
Staggering through a black haze
The rain, a curtain of cold grey
A fell day, no hope for the 'morrow
Drowning 'neath my veil of sorrow

Despair haunting my waking hours
In silence so cold
Mourning all I've ever known
Left to hunger, alone

Shadows beyond my sight
Respite beyond my reach
Gasping for air to breathe
Drowning in my own grief

I wander these woods
Their grace, my solace
Shade under falling leaves
Naught but a hollow peace

The morning light wavers
Faintly through the trees
My burden never free
As darkness surrounds me

[Chorus]
Staggering through a black haze
The rain, a curtain of cold grey
A fell day, no hope for the 'morrow
Drowning 'neath my veil of sorrow
