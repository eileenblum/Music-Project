[Music &amp; lyrics: Scott Brierley]

The snow falls silently 'cross the coomb
The wind's howl echoing through the crags
Alone I watch the season's throes
Here at world's end where no life roams

North of sun's light
Under a winter's moon
In pale white night
A blissful solitude

Far away from fear, love, hate
Memories too faint to feel pain
Alone, I, whisper to the cold
Here, at one with soil and stone

[Chorus]
These dead mountains I call home
To these bleak woods I speak my woes
Above barren lands, under godless skies
Here I remain until I die

For days immemorial
Reflecting on uncounted years
Hearing the cries of friend and foe
Watching the death of the world below

Shadows taunt my name
Oathbreaker, exile, forsaken

Shade no longer my shelter
Voices pull me from my slumber

I once looked upon the plains
I once spoke the names of the world
I once walked without fear
I once knew love

Wandering far from here
Away from this cursed gloom
Returning to distant memories
Flames that burn anew

Along frozen lakeshores
Across seas of ice
Daylight welcomes me home
South of winter's bite

[Chorus]
These dead mountains I call home
To these bleak woods I speak my woes
Above barren lands, under godless skies
Here I return when I die
