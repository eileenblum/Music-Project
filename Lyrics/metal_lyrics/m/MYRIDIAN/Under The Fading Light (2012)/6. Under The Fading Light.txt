[Music &amp; lyrics: Scott Brierley]

The veil of night creeps closer
Smothering the distant hills
Fear now will roam the darkness
In this forsaken land

No more will the day hold back the night
Hope no longer restraining the blight
No more will the sun caress thy skin
Only the pale moon remains, both boon and bane

Shards of twilight pierce the gloom
Woodlands void of all that moves

[Chorus]
Silence falls upon the empty vales
Black whispers drift across the winds
No shelter from the end of life
Despair to all under the fading light

Those who traverse these haunted woods
Tell tales of towns, left bleak and cold
Of slaughtered folk, of deserted homes
Of beasts that lust for blood and bone

The shadow descends upon shallow graves
Awakening ghouls of a forgotten age

Howls tear through the silent forests
Padded footsteps echo through the mist
No safety left in the haunts of man
These fiends rule this darkened realm

[Chorus]
Silence falls upon the empty vales
Black whispers drift across the winds
No shelter from the end of life
Despair to all under the fading light

Flee or fight, all will be consumed
No morning will rise, this night be thy doom
