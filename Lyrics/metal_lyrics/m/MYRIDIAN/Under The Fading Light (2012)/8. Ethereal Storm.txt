[Music: Felix Lane &amp; Scott Brierley, lyrics: Felix Lane]

What have we done?
Why are we forsaken?
The prophet speaks
Of the God's deception
On a chilly night
Seeking answers in the fire
The look on his face
Pale with fear

He speaks of a storm
Of a terrifying light
He speaks of death
Of a final epic fight
He whispers of fires
Like none we've ever seen
The end of time
All will die

So I set off on a journey
To the lands we once knew
There I will find the truth
With a full-score of warriors with me
We awaited the sun

[Chorus]
And on the edge of the earth I see the Ethereal Storm
A sky filled with endless wings to herald our doom
A march upon our existence with genocide as their goal
I set alight a flame, may it guide us through the dark

And at that very moment
I curse the Gods
A sign of our faith
Of our will to live

I raise my sword to the sky
To pledge an oath
To protect all life
Though it will mean my death

And onwards we rode
Into the eye of the storm
Our heads held high
And we shall know no fear

Come fight me Angdroth
And Visier and Visior
O Gods of the Earth
Come meet my blade

I have seen the image of the end
A face bathed in blood and a scorched world to behold
Spears have been rattled and swords unsheathed
I do not stand alone as I challenge our gods

[Chorus]
And on the edge of the earth I see the ethereal storm
A sky filled with endless wings to herald our doom
A march upon our existence with genocide as their goal
I set alight a flame, may it guide us through the dark

See the world burn
See the world on fire
Humanity is crushed
All that which once was great
Is now nought but ashes and earth
We fought
And we lost
Curse the Gods

See the world burn
See the world on fire
