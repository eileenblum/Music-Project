[Music &amp; lyrics: Felix Lane]

And there she lies, broken on the grass
Awaiting the moments til her life is gone
Her father weeps by her side
Torn by anguish
He holds her hand tightly
As she slowly slips away

A starless sky above
Once the reflection of her life
Never to see the lights again
Now that she has died

A starless sky above
Once the reflection of her life
Never to see the lights again
Now that she has died

Cursed to live in darkness
We've lost what once was our guide
Will we ever know peace again
Now that she has died

One by one they fade
Each extinguished by the dripping of her blood
Only the moon will remain
Alone in a starless sky

How could they do this
How could they end the lights of the night
Why would they do this
Condemning us to live under a blackened sky

Give me back my daughter
Give us back the stars
Grant me my revenge
Now that she has died
