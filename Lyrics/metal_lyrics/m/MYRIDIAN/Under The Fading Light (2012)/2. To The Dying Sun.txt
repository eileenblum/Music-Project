[Music &amp; Lyrics: Scott Brierley]

My body lies
Still 'neath the weeping boughs
No wounds mark my flesh
No sickness sought my death

Years left me cold and hollow
A life of loss and sorrow

No will left to walk on
I give my life to the dying sun

[Chorus]
No golden halls to welcome me home
Black silence is now all I know

Seasons long past deprived me, of all I loved
My torn homeland, left behind so long ago
My king and queen, long lost to the sea
My wife and child, slain before me

Alone in this winter, I stood the last
The last of my kin
None now left, now I am gone
None now live to remember our fall

Memories fading
Darkness encroaching
My skin cold, my eyes closed
My grief laid to rest

[Chorus]
No golden halls to welcome me home
Black silence is now all I know
