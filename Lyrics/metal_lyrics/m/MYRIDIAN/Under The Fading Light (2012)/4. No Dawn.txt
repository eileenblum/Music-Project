[Music: Scott Brierley, lyrics: Felix Lane]

We are the fallen
We are the victorious dead
The first in line
At the gates of death
Slain in battle
Our lives lost not in vain
Here we shall see no dawn

Now at the end
All shall come to light
The atrocities committed
By the ones we were sworn to
The heinous acts we performed
In their names without knowledge
And now we must pay
No rebirth, no dawn

With regret, with remorse
We are turned away from the halls
Destined to be cast in flame
The burning depths await
With a cry and a shout
I turn to my brethren
No, we will not go
We will atone for our crimes

[Chorus]
We were the fallen
We were the victorious dead
Slain in the line of duty
A duty only now fully known
Only now in death do we see
The evil we were sworn to
And we shall return at dawn

And we have returned
With vengeance
In place of loyalty
We march on their palace
One hundred across
And one hundred back
We issue a challenge
Come forth and test our vengeance
