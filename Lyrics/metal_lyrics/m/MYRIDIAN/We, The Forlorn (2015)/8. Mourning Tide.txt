An ice-cold wind 
Chills to the bone 
A mistswept veil 
Clouds the shore 

Horizons yield to pale light 
Morning's embrace, a bitter respite 
Before the mounds of dead, we mourn 
Thousands slain for glory forevermore 

Three days have passed 
Since we first gave battle 
A hopeless task 
Yet we proved our mettle 

Afoot on foreign shores 
(Without a hope, without a home) 
Helms cleaved and shields torn 
(Spears cracked and axes worn) 
We few survived to see a new day 
(And at this day's end, we will fade away) 
Into the tales of mortal men 
(For none yearn to see the sun rise again) 

We came, not alone 
A king, a queen and an army 
Victory, we tasted with our blades 
Their blood, our blood, now one with the waves 

Malice's touch 
An icy grasp 
A cruel fate 
Not to die 

Bruised and bleeding 
Exhausted and freezing 
A cruel fate 
Not to die 

Tides, come forth and wash me clean 
Of grief and loss and misery 
Sweep the blood into the sea 
And carry this burden so far from me 

Free me of the memory 
Of this blood red scene 
So many dead as far as can see 
All in the name of a land once free 

The dead lie shattered 
And soon too the dying 
We few who still cling to life 
Stumble forth into the tides 

Our strength has left our bodies 
As life seeps from our wounds 
I welcome the cold darkness 
The warm embrace of ice
