No whispering from the trees
No waves rise from the sea

Daylight's life
Fades into night
A realm falls silent
Without one last cry

A decayed moon now takes seat
Upon a dying world's throne

High above
The sundered skyline
The cold fire burns
Her time is nigh

Under this nightfall
Her embrace envelops us all
As a plague she descends
Upon our souls
She freezes the embers of life
With but one breath
She is our end
Our silent death

Brothers take up arms
Just to fall dead at her feet
Heroes flee at her approach
Leaving the helpless to die in their sleep

Where the light fails she comes
Her footsteps tainted with icy blight
Without a sound she engulfs all
Her wrath unstoppable

None can halt her advance
None can stop her from freezing all life
We all die forsaken
By gods new and old

We fall, one by one
Calling out for the rising sun
Our voices break the night
And as we fade, we see the light
