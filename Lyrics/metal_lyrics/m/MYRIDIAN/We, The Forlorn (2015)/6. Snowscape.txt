We stand surrounded by ice
And veiled by eternal night
White flakes of snow fall softly
The aurora above casts its light

Nothingness lies
Behind our eyes
Our fires dimmed low
By winter's throes

Falling to our knees
Before grief's pale majesty
Upon a cold, white throne
Shrouded by falling snow

This winter expanse
A frozen wasteland
Is all we see
These cold, tranquil winds embracing
A comforting breath
Calling us to sleep

Hunger and despair
Gnawing at our bones
No shelter within sight
Only an endless sea of ice

My strength frail
Whispering your name
Cast from your grasp
As you fade away

Falling to our knees
Before grief's pale majesty
Upon a cold, white throne
Shrouded by falling snow

Drowning in falling snow
