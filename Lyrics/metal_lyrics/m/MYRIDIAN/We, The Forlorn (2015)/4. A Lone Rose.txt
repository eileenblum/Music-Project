My queen, hear me 
Heed my longing cry 
Your rule is failing 
Our love weeps tonight 

We stand close 
Bound in silence 
Cold tears flow 
Your heart a lone rose 

My queen, hold me 
My sweet ray of light 
Come follow me 
To where the stars hear your plight 

In sorrow 
In solace 
Together we stand 
Against this shadow of dread 

I've yearned for 
These frozen moments 
In your arms I unfold 

Stay with me this night 
Let me share your pain 
May our oaths rebind 
As I guide you to the flame 

Darkness cast from our souls 
White fire burns through our bones 
This world we leave as one 
Rise now above the flames 
Far from mortal hate 
Far from eternal nightfall 

Hold me close 
Savour my touch 

The veil falls away 
Your beauty remains 
Distant fires dim their light 
Yet your beauty remains 

This fiend is not you 
Rending flesh from bone 
One misspoken word 
And our world burns 

My queen, hold on 
Don't fade away 
My setting sun 

Please 
Stay with me 
Please 
Don't fade away
