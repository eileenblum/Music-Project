Once in ages long past 
We worshipped a promised land 
Now in greed and sin 
We guide it to ruin 

A world slowly falling into night 
Its beauty tainted with a deathly blight 
Its skin broken, beaten and worn 
Ripped apart and plundered by malice and scorn 

Trees sundered from soil and stone 
Usurped by spires where no leaves grow 

Hunters slain and prey consumed 
Starved and choking under clouds of fume 
Withering branches torn from the sky 
A landscape cast aside and left to die 

Behold the death of great Gaia 
A bittersweet end to the goddess of life 
Her gasps for breath nearing their last 
Leaving behind a world laid desolate 

Blackened fields sprawl before our blinded eyes 
Atrocities condemned by her silent cries 

The winds carry her howl 
Her pain a piercing sound 
The horror and rapture we've sown 
Awakening a wrath unknown 

As rain begins to pour 
None know their peril befalls 
Her tears of anguish, they flow 
Drowning all beneath their own toil 

Mother! 
Wipe the plague off this earth 
Maker! 
Cleanse the land of our kind 
Mother! 
Restore the fallen to life 
Maker! 
Forgive our sins as we die
