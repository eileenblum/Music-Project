[feat. Nick Magur]Deep within 
These crumbling walls 
A frail, battered soul 
Clings to what once was whole 

Bereft of the fires of life 
What's left lies buried 'neath ice 
A spirit old, a spirit worn 
Reduced to a whisper, begging for no more 

A flickering flame 
Falters beneath pain 
A once proud name 
Cowers behind shame 

Crumpled lungs give barely a breath 
This life more akin to death 
Silent echoes of sorrow 
Fill empty caverns with resounding woe 

Years gone 
Years to go 
And these weary bones 
Are so tired 

Struggling 
To keep fighting 
And these hollow limbs 
Are weakening 

Endless 
Yearning 
And these age old wounds 
Are still bleeding 

Eternity 
Beckoning 
And this agony 
Without ending
