Breath sparse, limbs aching 
Thirst parched, sight failing 
Gasping for thin air 
Our gaze, a dead stare 

One year of exile 
One fell deed, one vile tale 
Our lives lost, our hope gone 
Without choice, we walk on 

Cast from our home 
Forevermore 
Cursed to wander alone 
We, The Forlorn 

Once I thought I'd lie here forever 
At rest in a life of peace 
My love, my land, and all that I had 
Torn away and left with grief 

Memories tainted 
Of names and faces 
Our kith and kin of old 
Their twisted scowls 
Of loathing and scorn 
Never once thought of right or wrong 

Here, in this land of stone 
Where time appears to slow 
A wasteland of dread and despair 
The ground as dead as the air 

Now, with home left behind 
No hope lingers in our eyes 
Our fears numb as our minds 
Our tears long since dried 

We lie undone 
Cursed by the sun 
Resigned to our fate 
Swallowed by fear and hate 

As dark falls, and light sets 
Our journey, a failed test 
We are scorned, we are lost 
We are broken, we are... 

Cast from our home 
Forevermore 
Cursed to wander alone 
We, The Forlorn 

Out of grasp of all that I've known 
My heart falls silent as stone 
With one last aching sigh 
I bid thee one final goodbye
