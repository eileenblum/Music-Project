A ghost in uniform
Is pounding at my door
They've staged an intervention
To even out the scores
There's cause for celebration
But I can laugh no more
They're damaged to the core
I'm hanging on

Tonight we'll find out
what's under the hood
Self-inflicted wounds
Never mind whatever
we've gone through
It's a miracle
Two emeralds shining through

There's tension in the room
And static in the air
His Highness fired the groom
A Victorian love affair
Threw in the towel for good
Then had to make amends
But now the fun begins
So let it out

You know the clouds
will smother the Sun
A tough-love momentum
A monument for the Fallen
for the Saints
It's a miracle
Two emeralds shine again

Tonight we'll find out
what's under the hood
Our self-inflicted wounds
Realize the hell
that we've gone through
It's a miracle
Two emeralds shining through
It's a miracle
Those emerald eyes of yours
