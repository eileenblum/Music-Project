Sapphire vessel gaining speed
Frozen dead-air atmosphere
Light-years above our bathysphere
Withered mountains, raging fear

Dashing through alien grounds
Expanding shadows, buzzing drones
White doll flicker on the screen
Three-headed captain steering wheel
Figure intact Apex III
New constellations now revealed

Sapphire vessel gaining speed
Frozen dead-air atmosphere
Light-years above our bathysphere
Withered mountains, raging fear

Dashing through alien grounds
Expanding shadows, buzzing drones
Cracking mirror, spider eyes
Spreading wings the crimson flies
Lightning awaking the inner light
Our vessel gliding in burning skies

Sirens calling, homesick deaf
Making peace with former selves
Lightning awaking the inner light
Our vessel gliding in burning skies
