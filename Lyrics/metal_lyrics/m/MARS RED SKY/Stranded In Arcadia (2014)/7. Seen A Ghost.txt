Attack my brain, release my mind
Enhance the screaming of a bleeding heart
For everyone to hear, wherever they are

From the deepest ocean to the highest skies
They're out of reach, I don't know why
Parallel lines that crossed my mind

They're dancing to the sound of a dying swan
The devil's circus at the gates of dawn
Celebration time the leader's gone

Bend your little heart like a new born
Under the weight of this crown of thorns
You're now in charge of the endless drone

Tick tack we're running out of time
Not enough room in Noah's ark
Swimming in the flood I won't take part

Running all around like a mad horse
You're terrified like you've seen a ghost
A vivid flash of light in a cloud of smoke

Open your eyes like a new born
Hail to the king, go sit on your throne
They'll follow you down whenever you fall

Attack my brain, release my mind
Enhance the screaming of a bleeding heart
For everyone to hear, whoever they are
