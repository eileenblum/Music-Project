Oh won't you take my place
Set sail and join the race
You will sometimes pay to run
The pain is worth the fun

Oh way to go, son
Aim for the sun

You'll document your fall
With flowers and alcohol
But the ones they push around
Don't know where they belong

They'll promise the sun, boy
Always the sun

Down here on the strand
I'll be crawling in the sand
A mannequin on the run
You promised the sun, Lord
Always the sun

Tomorrow you will fly
Take off to the sky
And the ones they hired to shoot
Will tamper with your parachute

Oh way to go, son
Aim for the sun

Here we go again
You'll be drowning in the rain
Trade your brain cells for a crown
And walk in the sun, boy
Aim for the sun

They'll promise the sun, boy
Always the sun
Oh way to go, son
Aim for the sun

Here we go again
You'll be drowning in the rain
Down here on the strand
I'll be crawling in the sand
A mannequin on the run
You promised the sun, Lord
Always the sun
You promised the sun, Lord
Always the sun
