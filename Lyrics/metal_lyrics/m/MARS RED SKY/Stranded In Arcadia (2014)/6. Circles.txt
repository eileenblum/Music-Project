Face it there's no one around
We can't make a sound, let's cancel
Sheep laugh at the wolves at the door
Roaming the floor in circles

I'm done playing a part
Faking a start, a miracle
We're gone staring a fight
Call it a night and cancel

Lost plane confusing clouds with the foam
Ghost train finally taking me home

Fake it, we're getting along
Running around in circles
Name it, you're calling the shot
I'll stick to my spot, all vertical

We're told everything's under control
But I"m cold, finally here on a roll

Face it, there's no one around
We can't make a sound, let's cancel
No more slamming the door
Dying to score and night calls

We're told everything's under control
But I'm cold, finally here on a roll
Lost plane confusing clouds with the foam
Ghost train finally taking me home
