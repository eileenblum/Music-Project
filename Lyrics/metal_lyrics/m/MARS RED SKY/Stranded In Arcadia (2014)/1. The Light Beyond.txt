I bought a lie, a compromise
There I was paralyzed, paralyzed
Here with your bitter smile and fireflies
Now I can see a light, see a light
Beyond

Summer dies, I realize
We're just a bunch of flies that socialize
Here with your forced smile and tired eyes
Still I can see a light, I see a light
Beyond

I bought a lie, a compromise
There I was terrified, terrified
Here with your angel smile and whiter lies
Now I see a light, I see a light
Here with your angel smile and whiter lies
You and I see a light, we see a light
Beyond
