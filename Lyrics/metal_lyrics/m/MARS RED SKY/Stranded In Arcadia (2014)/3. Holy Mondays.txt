She took me where dragons die
Oh bring me there and we would fly
Drive me where dragons die
Oh bring me back there and we would ride

We'll turn into fire every sound
We'll heat the sand around the lough
We'll paint in red the lost revenge
We'll blaze in sound all desires

We are a twin pace, we've got a fast car
You, Holy Mondays mirror in your eyes
We are a twin pace, we've got a fast car
You, Holy Mondays mirror

She took me where dragons die
Oh bring me there and we would fly
Drive me where dragons die
Oh bring me back there and we would ride

You'll turn into fire every sound
You'll heal the sand around the lough
You'll paint in red the last revenge
You'll blaze in sound all desires
