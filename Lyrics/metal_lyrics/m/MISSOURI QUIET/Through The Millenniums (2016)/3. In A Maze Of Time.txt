This dark gates slammed behind your back, you know it's your mistake.
Mistake that will bring the beginning of destruction and death of civilisation.
Your mind feels coming danger, but you cannot see its source.
And now it's time for an adventure that will change your life.
Walking through the endless darkness you are slowly going mad.
You hear lost of awful voices in your fucking head.
You hear crunch of maggots that are crushed under your legs
Legs are bringing you to nowhere to the world of endless death
Rustles of sandstorms, voices of executed souls are making stronger step by step
Hundreds of flashing gates have opened in front of you
You've seen every era that your ancestry lived in
You've seen how Caesar was betrayed, how Christ was crucified
Dirty blood of greedy kings spilled on you
You won't be able to escape from this prison
Demons of time won't take pity on your useless rotten soul
Running away in unknown direction, getting out of blinding rays
It is a vicious circle where darkness is changing with blinding light
Ears are bleeding, flashes stay in my eyes
My fear is so awful, my life is a complete.
Save my soul
What's going on? I am drowning in sand
One-two-three-four
Run away
Five-six-seven-eight
Please don't stop
One-two-three-four
Don't turn back
Five-six-seven-eight
Try again
