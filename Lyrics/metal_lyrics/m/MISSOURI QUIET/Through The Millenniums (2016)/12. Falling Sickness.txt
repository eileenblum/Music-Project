Do you ever feel this sickness in your head?
Like thousands vermins penetrate inside
Suffering
Blood becoming sewerage
No one cares
That your disease shows up your desperation
Filthy freaks.
There's no escape just endless pain
We will never win in this fucking game
Taste extermination of your spirit
Just give up and wait for your final breath
Paltry failure
That is how your fears slowly shred your fucking heads.
Accept this chaos until it's inside you
My mouth's full of blood.
My mind is a poison it doesn't help me to find the answer
Believe in disgust and open your mind for salvation.
For our salvation I must overcome my fears
But we're pathetic. We're just scums which are full of worthless tears. Overcome my fears
We're just slaves.
I am the poison coursing through your veins
I will devour you until nothing remains
Your suffering gives me strength as I feed on your flesh
I am death.
Your eyes begin to bleed
The infection is growing with speed
You collapse and you beg for mercy
But I have none to give.
I feel your anger, I see this hatred in your eyes.
I won't relent until every human dies.
I'm scared. My praises are no longer heard
Your god has forsaken you.
Hear my voice, people - we all must die
God didn't forgive our sins!
I didn't want such ending, but it all was our fault
It's doomsday time, it's payback time.
Human era comes to inescapable end
We all must die and we cannot change anything.
Your rotten bodies are corresced by flames
No one will utter your forgotten names
You will forever be erased from this desolate earth
Goodbye.
