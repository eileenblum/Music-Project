This is the place
Where you have never been
Cold like a stone
Stone of the Bran
This is the place
So alien for you

Nightmares are the moment you can feel
You devote your wishes and your dreams

Nightmares are real more than you ever can feel
Devote your wishes and dreams
To the night of a romance
Darkness inside you will bring to the line
Of blood which pass trough the time
The funeral romance

Beauty of darkness and their blacked lives
Make you want to despise the time
Find the one who will share with you
This midnight waltz

I`m too far from my fucking mind

Blood which passed trough the time
I`m too far from my fucking mind, so far from my fucking mind
So far from my mind

Beauty of darkness and their blacked lives
Make me want to despise the time
Follow the perfect and lifeless eyes
Represent to you this midnight waltz
