Waking up from the veil of being unconscious
You feel like you're dead, you feel pain,
You feel cold
Realize that you lay on the snow

So you try to return
Seems your body is frozen like iceberg
When you try to get up and walk
You can see that you're beaten almost full

Lifting eyes up to the sky you see far away
You see castle
Mighty castle in line of trees

Now your aim is to reach its big towers
Raising up from the hill
They look like flag
Like a flag for wounded man

But when you finally reach it
You find it empty
He is abandoned like you
Forsaken in the desert of snow

Nobody will find you here at all [4x]

You're losing your mind forever

Lifting eyes up to the sky you see far away
Far away on the top of the mountain
Lifting eyes up to the sky you see far away
Far away on the top of the mountain

Now your aim is to reach its big towers
Raising up from the hill

You're fucked!
