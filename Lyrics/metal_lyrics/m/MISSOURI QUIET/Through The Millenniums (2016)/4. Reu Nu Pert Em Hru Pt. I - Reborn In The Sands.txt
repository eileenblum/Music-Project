You were sent by the gods to this earth
You were the only hope for the great Egypt
In your heart is a fire in your veins pours sand
In your veins pours sand

And you were sacrificed a thousand souls
But you've forgotten that you're a slave
You're just a puppet of the god
You were a pawn - you are doomed to death

Temptation, satisfaction,
Very soon there will came your impending end
In your judgement day will be a verdict
At this hour you will die like thousands of innocent souls

Temptation, satisfaction
Now your grave will be sand
You're blaming yourself
Empty illusions of freedom which you donât forget

You were sent by the minions of Ra
Save this tortured souls
Eradicate this pain
Once and forever you will be one of us

These endless sands show you another way
Power and authority blinded you
You became a slave
Your veins filled with sand

You despise your life and try to kill yourself
But you're immortal
Sand will be your fucking grave [2x]
Many thousands of years you have been in a tombs

Many thousands of years you're despising everything
It's time to take revenge
Rise up how reborn in the sands
You were sent by the demons of Seth

Take away this souls
Propagate this pain
Once and forever you will be one of us
This endless sand show you another way

Power and authority have blinded you
You became a slave
Your veins filled with sand
You despised your life and try to kill yourself
But you're immortal
Reborn in the sands
