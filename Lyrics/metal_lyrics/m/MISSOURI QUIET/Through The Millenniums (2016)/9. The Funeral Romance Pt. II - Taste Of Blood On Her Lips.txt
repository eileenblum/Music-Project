A strange feeling, that alarms me so much
I've presented this midnight waltz to you
I'm forgetting all, when I look into your eyes
I want to feel taste of your lips and your love so strong
I know what you want and I feel your desire
Our bodies are burning in a fire of lust
I will be gentle with you as no one could
Let's get out of their curious eyes
Walking through dark passage I go after the sound of your steps
In your room of depravity, your quiet nook
Our bodies will devote to a passionate love that we both are waiting for
I want to see you naked body in your mirror ceiling
Why do you forbid me to contemplate, tell me your secret?
But I've felt taste of blood on your lips
When I looked up, I didn't see your image
My heart is overflowing with fear
I've opened your secret, I know who you are
I am ready to die
I am your source of life
So what are you waiting for?
Dawn will come very soon
Passion that is changed by nightmare have still your thirst
