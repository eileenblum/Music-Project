Harrowing screams goes out from dining hall
Like a wild animal is ripping someone's flesh
My fears have proved - hundreds of leeches've started their manhunt
And I am the one who see full moon last time
Swell ball before the bloody feast
A feast, where we are honourable guests, dying one by one

You was my queen, you've conquered my heart
You've been conquered my heart

My hands shake at the thought of your demise my fingers wander your body searching
My hands shake at the thought of your demise my fingers wander your body violating you
I will fulfill my need for flesh I must consume that's which beats life from your chest
Your eyes staring empty into mine

Swell ball before the bloody feast
A feast, where we are honourable guests, dying one by one
You was my queen
Light burns you, and it's painful for me to look on your suffering face
I will remember you forever, and love to you will always live in my heart
Sweet dream have turned to a nightmare, but I'll always remember your eyes
