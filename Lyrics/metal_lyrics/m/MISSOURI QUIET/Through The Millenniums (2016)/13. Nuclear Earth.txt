On the grave of humanity
Will be written seven billion names
And I am the only survivor
Without any chance to restart existence

World could not give me anything worse
Then leave me alone on the corpses of people
Now I am the only survivor
Whole planet is like my personal sandbox
Now I am god

On the grave of humanity
Will be written seven billion names

Living in this world will be like a torment for me
Will it be the end or I should continue to live
No one will ever hear my agonizing dying scream
I will breath again and feel how corpses smell is clear
I am used to die alone
You cannot see my fall
Iâll prey just one last time
Just god sees how I die
