New danger have reached our land of sands
The army of Seth stands waiting for a new blood
Under the command of insurrected tyrant
The bloody war of light and darkness will start
Gods of Nile, give us your force
Bless this lands for a war
It's time to pay for the sins of our ancestry
Sun goes down below the horizon, time for punishment is coming
The legion of dead is coming
Corpses that are overflowing with hatred are waiting for our blood
The story of forgotten ancestry goes that
I have to win the enemy and save Manefer
Let the battle begin
Help us to win, Ra
Wash out blood from our blades
Mass of dead bodies and exposed bones
But the main battle is still in future
A cutthroat fight with reborn in the sands

Your demons are fallen
And you will go after them
Look around - you've taken thousand of lives
Turned great Manepher into ruins
You will be responsible for everything and then disappear in history
Gods have heard my prays
Your time is passed

Evil was defeated but the curse remains
No one will ever see my tears
I am a hero of a harried town
There is only sorrow in my poisoned mind
I hear weeping screams of ruined souls
It's a glorious win with a tragical end

I will build a new Manepher
That I'll have to abandon with all my memories [8x]
