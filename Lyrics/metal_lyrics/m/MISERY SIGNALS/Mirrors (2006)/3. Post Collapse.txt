Forever reaching
Our hopes and aspirations ground to dust
I've fallen with my spirits
Of withered hand and hope
This hole will dig itself with minutes passing
Reincarnate deliverance that was once possessed
I've seen this in my dreams, in this day; Reality
But I'm wrapped around a time so far removed
This weight bestowed on me today uplifting

Now together, we are one

At peace in our disbelief
The ties that bind are now threadbare
It doesn't have to end to begin again
It doesn't have to end to begin again
I've seen this in my dreams, in this day; reality
But I'm wrapped around a time so far removed
This weight bestowed on me today it's uplifting
Now I fear no falter, there is no doubt
We climb out from the wreck to live again

Now together, we are one

At peace in our disbelief
The ties that bind are now threadbare
Take hold these words of fallen heroes
Whose lives pave the way to our redemption
Lest we forget
