My eyes eclipse as these stars constrict
And swallow me whole
Dislocate with your pretentious hands
Reciprocate through seeds of change
Deviate with feet of innocence, perceived through premonition
Times have changed
But still these words, your words remain

My eyes eclipse
Now I'm reduced to holding onto every regret
And the night sky has taken hold of me
Through clouds so black
A silhouette projects catastrophe
Your sky will fall

Fugitive night, the dawn will break
As true paths are rarely unveiled by means of shadows cast
This is the only way for me to reach behind this facade

Dissonance, unstable frequencies
Reiterate through sleight of hand
Corrosion, conviction slips away
Perceived through premonition
Times have changed
But still these words, your words remain

With the night sky, you've lost your hold on me
Your hands so black
A silhouette projects catastrophe
Your sky will fall

Take the tragedy you've earned
Asphyxiate - Suffocate
