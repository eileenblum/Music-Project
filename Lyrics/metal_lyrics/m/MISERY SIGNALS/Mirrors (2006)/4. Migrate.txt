The worst is over
We went the fast way out
You can see the marks left on my clothes
From where she came undone
You want me to hurt like you, to shadow the pain
Away with my sympathy
And the comforts I abused
Away with dishonesty
And my manufactured truth
I don't care, I just don't

And winter came to hide the sun behind the gray
And erase her
What's done is done
My warmth has gone
Carried by the birds of fall
I don't care, I just don't
It doesn't feel like anything
And winter came to hide the sun behind the gray
And devastate her
What's done is done is done
