You brought this on yourself
The lack of a barrel forced into your mouths
Proves your actions won't be without retribution
Break down
Bloodshed, a sign of weakness
Just know you'll get what you deserve

Who do you think that you are?
Barring your teeth like the smile of the one with a blade in his sleeve
The thorns that line your back are all it took to slit the arms that took you in
Just who do you think that you are?
Suicide king dying to be seen
An image to build, cover you up
The damage is done
Just let them fight fight fight
So they never have to face themselves

40 days, it will all be over
You'll vanish with the flood
Bloodshed, a sign of weakness
Just know you'll get what you deserve

Who do you think that you are?
Barring your teeth like the smile of the one with a blade in his sleeve
The thorns that line your back are all it took to slit the arms that took you in
Just who do you think that you are?
Suicide king dying to be seen
An image to build, cover you up
The damage is done
Just let them fight fight fight
So they never have to face themselves

Before you're too far gone
What will it take to drop your arms and learn
It's not too late
Burdened with the weight of your disguise, you'll sink like a stone
And collapse from neglect with the rest of your unknowns
Face yourself
Coward you can't face yourself
Coward you can't face yourself

You know it never fit, so come on
What will it take, to drop your arms and learn
It's not too late for giving up and letting go, growing up
Before you are you're too far gone
