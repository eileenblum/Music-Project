Lose control
You find yourself pulling out eyes from the room
Attention, your addiction
It's destroying everything, this steadfast fixation
Still my satisfaction is found in your submissive hands

Beautiful, the life you drove through me
Through this wall of glass
Piercing rays fueled the radiance in your eyes
Pulling me closer, defying all reason
Until a night so disconnecting stole it away
And now these screams do nothing but fasten you to this prison I designed
Lose control, find yourself, lose control
To be destroyed is a choice you'll have to make

Violent, the life you drove through me
Through this wall of glass
Piercing rays fueled the radiance in your eyes
Pulling me closer, defying all reason

Let it out, Shed this skin, Break away
Denial is catching up, illusion is caving in
Exactly what did you expect?
The harm is hiding
Knowing only your simplicity, knowing nothing
Upon the great divide
You see it your own way
No wisdom across the shallow glass
A captive god
You look over a deadened face
Features sink like a skull
So familiar yet so far away

I see now
I see now there is a choice to make
We could be any one, I see now
We turn over, we redefine this reflection
This is a need that we learn like a new limb
There is a choice to make
We will lie in our graves

A hall of mirrors opens into a room full of me
I could be anyone, we could be anyone
There is a choice to make, I see now
We turn over, we redefine this reflection
There is a choice to make
We will lie in our own graves
