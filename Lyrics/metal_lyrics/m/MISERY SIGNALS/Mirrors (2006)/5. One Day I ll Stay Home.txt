I surrender whole to one
Night by night, day by day
The blur of cities twisting us to severance
Your static voice over a thousand satellite hours
In Chrysalis my darling
Until our time
I'll flood my eyes in light
The road underfoot is certain to become the road behind
One day I'll stay home

Confide in me, this is my promise
This is and has to be
Never fraction or ephemeral
The gift of self, given completely
The way I will be given to you

From everything I've chosen to stray
But never with contempt
For every mile a moment missed
My absence not in vain
This choice is passion, this path is tension
I feel the pressure clenching me
This is now and not forever
Until our time
My ears will ring
The road underfoot is certain to become the road behind
One day I'll stay home
Night by night, day by day

Confide in me, this is my promise
This is and has to be
Never fraction or ephemeral
The gift of self, given completely
The way I will be given to you
Until our time my ears will ring
Until our time I'll flood my eyes
