Breaking dawn will bring revenge
We should know by now
We're so sick
It was building up and no one was watching
We're running out of darkened corners to sweep the waste into
In our distracted focus no one had a chance
When we lined up at the edge
We were open wide
Like fools, waiting for a sign

It was a free fall
An act of desperation, our backs against the wall
It was a free fall
It was an act of desperation, down we go
As we all went blind, like an answer to the call of our outstretched hands
The hell be beckon crept inside
The vultures circling overhead
Starving to pick the skeletons we leave
On the eve of the end
As the world around us burns, the ashes shall rain
Somehow we still beg
Give us a sign

Dawn brings revenge

Patience won't mend the broken
Promise of something greater
The cables wrapped around out throat
Tonight pitch red cast over
Senses adrift, I lay me down
Plague wraps its arms around me
Down we go

It was a free fall
An act of desperation, our backs against the wall
It was a free fall
It was an act of desperation, down we go
When we lined up at the edge
We were open wide
Like fools, waiting for a sign
