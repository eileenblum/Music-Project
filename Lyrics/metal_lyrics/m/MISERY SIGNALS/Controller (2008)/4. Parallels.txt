No footprints before me
Will I be the one that finds a way?
Our fate unfolding
Is there something more then the roles we play?
How deep the roots dig
And they sink into my skin
I see myself in the cracks of your foundation
And these walls will crumble by our hands
We don't talk much anymore
And we're not letting down our guard

We are not alone
Everyone is lost
Waiting on a second wind
Just believe we are not alone

Speak to me.
What can be said while we're still being honest?
Only then will these marks start to heal
And cleanse us of these demons
But there's so much to say, and there's so little time
Take my hand and walk with me
Lead me to salvation
And in return I'll offer you my pledge to start all over
But there's so much to say, and we're so far behind

No footprints before me
Will I be the one that finds a way?
Feel how deep the roots dig
And they sink into my skin
I see myself in the cracks of your foundation
And these walls will crumble by our hands
We don't talk much anymore, but motherfucker we hit hard

No, we are not alone
Everyone is lost
Waiting on a second wind
We are not alone
