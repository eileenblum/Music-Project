Panic sets in
The room just spins
Here it comes again...

Slipping through my fingers out of my reach
Nothing is picture perfect
Buried under the rocks of a landscape
Nothing here is picture perfect
Slipping through your fingers
It's out of your hands

Bleed
Holding on gets harder and harder
Giving up gets harder and harder
(Release)
The tension corrupts direction
I've lost control

Slipping through my fingers, it's out of my grasp
Nothing is ever be perfect
Crippled by the weight of the downfall
Nothing here is real

Keep control

A lifetime of open wounds
Completely incomplete

Bleed
Holding on gets harder and harder
Giving up gets harder and harder
(Release)
The tension corrupts direction
I've lost control

Just keep on tighter and tighter, and keep control
Just hold on tighter and tighter, just hold me still
