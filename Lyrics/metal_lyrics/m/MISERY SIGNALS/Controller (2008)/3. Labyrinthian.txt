Drag my face through the dirt again
I know I'm where I belong
For you're a constant reminder
Of all the rights that I've wronged

Give me the strength to move this mountain
To block this line of sight
This was more than I could ask for
Tear down the sky
Black out the sky
Sever these ties

As you further your tragedy
To prove to me you're alive
Sooner or later we'll have to choose
From this, a new set of lies

Give me the strength to flood this valley
To wash my hands of you

This was more than I could ask for
Tear down the sky
Black out the sky
Sever these ties

So here I stand
This battered path laid out before me
And no one said this would be easy
But it's something I must do for myself
It's going to be a long hard road

Know I will let go
This time it feels so right to forget

This was more than I could ask for
Tear down the sky
Black out the sky
Sever these ties

So here I stand
This battered path laid out before me
And no one said this would be easy
But it's something I must do for myself
It's going to be a long hard road
Which I will walk alone
