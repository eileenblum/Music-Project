Press rewind
Play it back in this dark room
It's been so long
I don't remember who we used to be

Go slow
Is it safe to come out again?
In skin like stone
Now I can't believe anyone anymore
I wasted it on you

They were sinking or swimming
I was floating away

On our own
We see the world now for what its worth
Undo what's done
Before this heart destroys its host

They were sinking or swimming
I was floating away

Reach into her guts
Take back what's tangled up
I wasted it on you
Reach into her guts

We're just rehearsing who we think we are
