Our fears ring true
We're on a march towards the end
Cover my eyes
But I still hear the deafening drums of war
Onward every twisted spoke

Let's make history
Let's make history stop
When there's nothing left
We'll be fed our father's dreams

And I find every time I face this skyline
I picture it in ruins
It's not going to stop

Our fears ring true
We are numbered with the dead
When I finally come apart
Every piece will melt holes into the streets
Onward every twisted spoke

Let's make history
Let's make history stop
When there's nothing left
We'll be fed our father's dreams

We can't let it happen like this
Burn it down
Burn it to the fucking ground
It's not going to stop
