The spell is broken
Masked in rituals to capture the sun
Bloodletting
Monuments of guilt
If I had one wish, I'd stop all the clocks
Within me, the spell is broken

We all are still alive
We radiate

Breathe now
It's in the wind that we give and we take
They never really have us if we just keep breathing

I have seen them
Within me the spell is broken

Home
At last...
Homecoming at last
Now feel what is unseen
Within me, the spell is broken
