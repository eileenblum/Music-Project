Will I wake from this dream tonight
Will I be able to follow tomorrow
Is there a chance this will be alright
Will I be able to follow tomorrow
I don't think I can
I'd never thought you'd leave
I must never forgot the day you went away
I always thought you'd stay with me
But you lied you left use alone
I love you and I miss you
and I would die for you tonight
I'll trace your hands in mine so that you always stay
Sometimes I forget you're gone
Sometimes I pretend you're still here
These times when I'm alone
I must never forget the day you went away
I always thought you would stay with me
But then you left us now I'm alone
There you left us so far from home
I will never forget you
