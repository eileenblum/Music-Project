Few will reach this height
Your gift has given you the chance
Priveleged to an image
The power to impact
Your footprints mark the parth
Will you use this to create change
How can you support all the words you spoke
How can you promote the actions you provoke
You must build a model from the heart
Prove your honor
Questions are at hand
Can you do this
Will you prove your worth
Or will this all be for nothing
Will this all be wasted time
Can you live with what you leave behind
You've been given this one opportunity
Don't let it pass you by
For this is your chance for something
You must make this last
