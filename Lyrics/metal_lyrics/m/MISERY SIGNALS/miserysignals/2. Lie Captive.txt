Woven captive in my words
Keep still, keep quiet
You are not the truth
I feel you like a fucking dagger
There has never been a worse time

It's just like me to burn alive
I would never let you know
But I've run pens dry for you
Words into pages
Pages into hours
So hold me still in my contempt
Alone in my own burden

Keep still, keep quiet
You are not my truth
There has never been a worse time

It's just like me to burn alive
I would never let you know
You are not truth
You are solitude

Every page of every wasted hour will be set to flame
Because I always knew you would lie
Every page, every wasted hour, set to flame
Because you lied
This time you lied to me
