I'd give my life for this to change
There's no excuse for what I've done
Now I must prove that I truly love
Afetr all we said, how Could I lie
Disappointed myself
Disappointed you, for what
Ask for forgiveness
I'm so disappointed in myself,
and so sorry for what I've done
all of that time I was so weak
blinded by lust I could not think
If you give me one more chance
I promise I will not fail you
I will stay never betray
I am sorry regretting what I have done
I need to fix this, make you see
You need to know, that was not me
