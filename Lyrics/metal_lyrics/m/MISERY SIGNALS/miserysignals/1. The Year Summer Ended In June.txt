This time it was our summer
It was something no one could take from us
Sometimes that night seems so close
Like I could hold it
You said alright we'll be fine
But how could we have known
Do you remember
Roll down the window, let in night air
I always thought we'd be together
You said that we'd never gone this way before
I must not let you die
Your memory survives
I hope that tonight things are fine
As I lay awake
The light cuts the southern sky
And that glass stings my lungs
These scars they will always remind me of you
And how you are always with me
You're with me, you're with me
You are with me, always with me
Nothing
Won't you stay and be with me tonight
Don't you know I tried to find those pictures with no light
I lost them as I lost you
Waiting to see and be with you again
Wishing the best for you my lost friends
To hear you laugh one last time
I hope you know I tried to find those pictures Jordo
Of us that night in Detroit with The Pressure Point
And I now feel the need to fly and hide inside
And I now feel the need to hide inside your loving arms
Man I swear I'd give the whole thing up for you
