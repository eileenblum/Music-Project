Never again will she see a sunrise awakening over a world unbroken
He brought the night with him beyond the gates while she safely slept
Never again

The way she turns her face from passing strangers is part of her now, echoing
The way she wakes up cold and calls her father's name is part of her now
Echoes of him

Never again will she hear the raindrops fall against the glass and not feel a chill
Transported back to the night it changed and the sound of the front door forced open
She awoke to the panic

Down the stairs she crept
A family he'd never met, broken in pieces
Every single step, every living breath

Underneath her nails, she will carry his pain
When the structure of your new life breaks through the door
It will already be sealed in the past

Every single step, every living breath
Underneath her nails, she will carry his pain
When the structure of her new life broke through the door

It was already sealed in the past
