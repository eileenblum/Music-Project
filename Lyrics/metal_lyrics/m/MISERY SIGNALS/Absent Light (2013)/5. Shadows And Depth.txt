We are the torchbearers
In a cold uncaring world, we seek warmth to feel alive
To feel anything at all

Calloused hands lifted toward empty skies
Drifting bodies on a desolate plane
And you, the righteous, listen

Know that those who walk closest to the light are often left blind
Casting shadows, casting stones
So far from where you began

How can you judge the quantity of love that it takes to make something real?
To bring warmth, we must set this world to flame
Watch as the cruel dictators of morality choke on ash and cinder

Together as one
A beacon in the expanse of Lightlessness
We are the torchbearers
