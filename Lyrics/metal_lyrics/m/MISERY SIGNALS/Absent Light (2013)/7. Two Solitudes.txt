There is no time, there will be no revival
When I took you in I was looking for a key
Another solitude to border mine

Holding out for truer lies, born to sharpen knives
The lives we sought to lead became the distances
And soon the years crept in between me and my dearest friends

There is no time, there will be no revival
On the day I broke I was looking for a cure
Laying my head between a lion's jaws

Surrendered to the end, born to sharpen knives
When you poison us does it feel like revenge?
Every scalp that my blade has taken

I laid them at your feet for your judgement
So swing my guilt against me
Does it feel like revenge?

My debts will not be settled, they die with me
My debts will not be paid, they die with me
The taste of blood still on our tongues, we don't stay satisfied for long

The suffering is said to make you strong
But the damages repaid were not enough
We don't stay satisfied for long
