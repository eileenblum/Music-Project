Let shine the dimmest light
I barely see you through the fog that will not lift
Show yourself the way I knew you
With no fear of being pulled by the undertow into gaping holes
You were someone I believed in

Few return the same men as they left

You led me through hell my constant north
You were someone I believed in

To keep you in the sky, untouchable
All that they promised you will drag you under
To keep you in the sky, untouchable
All that they promised you will drag you down under the sea

Stay what you are to me
I'm losing you
A lantern growing dark

To keep you in the sky, untouchable
All that they promised you will drag you under
True colors painted over
You were someone I believed in

As they lower the veil
The stars no longer guide us
Deserted by ghosts of virtue
Scraping the bottom
