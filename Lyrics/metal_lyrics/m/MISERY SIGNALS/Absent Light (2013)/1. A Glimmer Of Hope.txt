I'm not ready to say goodbye
But the closer we get, the more that it hurts
We've already come this far living on stolen moments

I just wanted to understand
Take me back to the places we used to hide
where the earth moved slowly and a glimmer of hope was enough

But the gaslights all burned out
you left me here to walk along a burial ground
I don't blame you
We all give up eventually
