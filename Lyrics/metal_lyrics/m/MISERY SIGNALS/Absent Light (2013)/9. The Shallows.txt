"Truth, like gold, is to be obtained not by it's growth, but by washing away from it all that is not gold"
[Leo Tolstoy]

Wash it all away, this replica, wash it all away
We reveal only truths that we have chosen
And tell only secrets of the surface

We offer up our skin, the measure of our worth
As we wade into the shallows
Wash it all away, this replica

The rising tied will wash it all away
Rais the border and the boundaries
We separate lesser evils each in their own compartments

The view from this lense by it's design divides us
Divides us, what of the truth
Only movement in the reaches of gravity can mean anything

Towers were built like castles from the sand, like statues of tyrants
The tide is coming in to wash them away
The towers were built like castles in the sand

The rising tide will wash them away
