In the trenches after war, outside the factories
Hidden in the architecture, mimicking the angles
Everything will rust

In the time it takes to lift my best laid plans from the riverbed
Everything will rust
Despite the fear that I feel, there is still enough to bury us

I've come here to worship and scrape my nails into the stone
Hoping to leave my mark, a message to my heir
Are you listening to the wisdom surrounding you?
