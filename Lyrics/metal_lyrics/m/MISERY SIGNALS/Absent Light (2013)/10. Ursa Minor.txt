Sleeping beneath the sleet, palms to the dirt
No lunar glare to mark our course
Among the apparitions of a potter's field

The nameless, the lost, haunting a hollow so far away
I never meant to end up here, betrayed by constellations
I never meant to end up here, with no bodies of light to guide us home

Collapse into earth and be pulled beyond your quarrel
No lantern, no compass, no map to be found
We set sail against the sorrow having mourned enough

Adrift the current, you are not alone
Even sinking into the darkness that waits below
Beneath the fathomless depths with an ocean upons

Adrift the current, you are not alone
Collapse into earth, be pulled beyond your quarrel
No lantern, no compass, no map to be found

We set sail against the sorrow
