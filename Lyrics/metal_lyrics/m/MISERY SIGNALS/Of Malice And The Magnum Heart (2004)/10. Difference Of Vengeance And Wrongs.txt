As this landing illuminates
Cold and pushed away
Where are we
Wrapping ourselves in one hundred years of poison
Awaiting winter old
Before you I am pending what could be
This will be the change
This will be the song to right the wrongs
And it's already done so
Forever it is written
It's been a long time
I feel it too
But I have pushed for so long to see this through
In the middle now
This song with melody that transcends measure and time
Written on pages of purity
I was always waiting for you and your struggle
I've seen the fall
I've been there before but I never fell
This will be the change
This will be the song to right the wrongs
And in the end what I want
Is a song
And it's already done so
Forever it is written
It's been a long time
I feel it too
But I have pushed for so long to see this
And in the end what I want
Is a song that means what it says
And I'll show up in your life
Singing the answers I wish I could find
Forever this will be the song
To right the wrongs
Forever it is written
This will be
