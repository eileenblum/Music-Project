I am peripheral movement
I am a figure without form
I am a person seem from a distance
Rebirth to a new life transcribed in wires
From a new life
Growing to hate decisive moments
The only thing within a breath of real
So now I fall to my knees and beg in earnest
To what powers may govern the sky
Just let me sleep one night without these dreams
These dreams that always haunt me
Nothing
Life gets longer the day I realize
I can't breathe deeply enough to fill me
With every disappointment
Nothing Happens
And the man I might have been
Nothing Ever Happens
And all the great things that I will never do
Growing to hate decisive lows
All I can do is watch it pass
I resonate at the pitch of discontent
I am peripheral movement
Life gets longer today I realize
I can't breathe deeply enough to fill me
With every disappointment
And break my heart the way it deserves
Nothing Happens
And the man I might have been
Nothing Ever Happens
And all the great things that I will never do
