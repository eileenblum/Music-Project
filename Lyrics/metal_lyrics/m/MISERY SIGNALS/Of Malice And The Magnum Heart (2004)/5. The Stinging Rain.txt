Gentle were the words that set her free
She became the stinging rain
She became the hurricane
A drumming in my sleep
Must I breathe your name always
The last of silence as it tears away at me
All tied in knots
Cause the simple moments they add up
Awaken
Smash it apart
Awake
Smash it apart to be free
Gentle were the words that set her free
She became the stinging rain
She became the hurricane
No love lost
Purge you Animos
That serpent coiled within my stomach
Temperance fell from her without weight
Gone with the storm
We are not meant to contain the sadness of the world
I whispered in her ear and drew her close
Of calm and quiet walls
I drew her close
Of triangles and bleeding wrists
I drew her close
The drumming in my sleep
Return and be free always
The last of silence tears away at me
Still tied in knots
Cause those simple moments they always add up
This will be the end of silence and the very last time
I can promise you that
Awaken and destroy these dreams
Smash it apart be free
Awaken and destroy these dreams
Awaken and be free
