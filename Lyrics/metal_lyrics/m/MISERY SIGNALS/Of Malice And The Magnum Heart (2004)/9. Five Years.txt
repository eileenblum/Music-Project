I've seen it in your eyes,
Looks like your sneaking and all your lies,
They did catch up to you this time
I swear I heard you say,
"Blood is forever"
"Love is forever"
I can fool myself all that I want
But I saw the room, I heard your voice, I saw your eyes
The truth will always get the best of you inside or out
It took me two years to find that I wasted five years of my life
Felt the truth within you, and I saw red
So I guess we are the long goodbye
What wasted time
I always hoped somehow it never happened to us,
But it is something that did
And something I can't forget
And after all of our times,
You fucking did what you did
This was days and weeks, days and weeks of deceit
It was days and weeks of deceit
You turned and walked away
You said you'd be back tomorrow
Well tomorrow has come and gone
You said you'd be back tomorrow
Well tomorrow has come and gone
Looks like you're choking on all those lies (Those lies)
They did catch up to you this time (This time)
I swear I heard you say, "blood is forever"
Well it seems forever meant nothing to you
It meant nothing but I swear I heard you say,
"Blood is forever"
