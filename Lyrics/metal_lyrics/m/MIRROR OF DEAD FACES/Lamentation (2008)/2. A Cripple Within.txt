In this hour I am here ready and willing to be skinned alive.
Why am I consumed with such a mind to where I cannot control my emotion?
Stress consumes my every thought and sleep will not come, such a distaste I
have.
Therefore, I have come to a point where I am standing dazed and I beg you
please carry this burden, this weight.
For what lesson must I gain from this anxiety?
I know that it has been said not to worry yet I cannot control this urge that
is based upon a lack of clarity.
How I wish to reach within myself and pull this cripple from my innards.
Cut this from me for the pain that I might endure in that instance would be far
less than a lifetime of torture.
Peace shall come and a calm I must find through the battle of the will and the
mind.
Therefore, I have come to a point where I am standing dazed and I beg you
please carry this burden, this weight.
For what lesson must I gain from this anxiety?
I know that it has been said not to worry.
Cut this from me for I can no longer stand still as I wish to tear at my limbs
as the stress torments.
I am now listening!
Will peace ever come?
