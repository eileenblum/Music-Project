Such a weight I have allowed myself to carry and with this I feel as though I
must endure, for this is a pain I have caused myself.
Set in my ways I can now see with clear eyes what I have done as the bodies are
left in my wake. I am inherently evil and covered in the utmost disease.
For this is my curse: to hurt those that I love and to harm which is pure.
What a regret I have!
Smell the stench of the rotting, for we are all dying.
Now raise your hands with me and scream to the heavens all that has been burden
to you.
There is power in this number so let us be free.
Canât you see the torment in my eyes?
I dare you to reach out and feel this pain.
As sorrow abounds, though I know I am forgiven I must live with this all of my
days.
Cries will be sent to you until you hear the screams of the children.
I beg of you, please listen to my words and know that this is an evil thing and
through these doors you shall never return.
Where there is no strength to be found you will find the way of the flesh as it
leads to my grave.
I can still taste you on my tongue and feel your touch, I can see your smile
and now I know that this not my own.
Lust has filled my heart and I have taken my fill in that which has ruined many
a young man.
As your words echo in my head and the memory is like a fire in my mind, sin
breathes destruction and death is its toll.
Smell the stench of the rotting, for we are all dying.
Now raise your hands with me and scream to the heavens all that has been burden
to you. There is power in this number so let us be free.
Canât you see the torment in my eyes?
I dare you to reach out and feel this pain.
As sorrow abounds, though I know I am forgiven, I must live with this all of my
days.
Cries will be sent to you until you hear the screams of my soul.
