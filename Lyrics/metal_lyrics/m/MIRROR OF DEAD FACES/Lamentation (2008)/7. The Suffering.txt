You might call this evil.
Though there is no life in us, joy will be found in this so-called filth.
Oâ yes, we want all that which is you.
We would take that which is not to be seen.
We would bring end to all hope, destroy your dreams and breathe suffering.
Lie down sweet one, your struggle is of no use.
Should we not take whatâs before us?
Breathe death and pain into your lungs, suffering shall be great and pleasure
for another.
This will destroy for we have no conviction.
Oâ yes, we want all that which is you.
Bite your lip and bury your head, never forget this moment.
Breathe death and pain into your lungs, suffering shall be great and pleasure
for another.
This will destroy for we have no conviction.
We shall bring an end.
We will destroy your dreams.
We will breathe suffering.
