What majesty and power I have heard, I have seen Your works and I am left
shaken.
There is might in Your name for You are The Great I Am, The Beginning And The
End.
The earth shakes under Your command and the heavens wait in order for only Your
instruction. Rise, rise, may my cry enter Your ear as sweet as honey.
I come humbly to Your throne Oâ Giver And Taker Of Life, Bringer Of Peace And
Lord Of War. Justice is Your rod and all that is wrong shall be set right under
Your command.
May the blood of the wicked run upon the edge of Your sword as You exalt those
called to righteousness.
For Your redeeming will I thank You.
