Why have I been cursed from birth with this flesh, this disease of sin?
I am filthy and I am broken!
How I wish for this to come to an end.
What is this price we have put into such self-worth, how foolish we have
become!
Bend a knee at the feet of filth as if there is gain, for we are the gods of
self as we look to worship our own.
Confused we cry out for you, for we are left here in the dark.
An anger has filled my heart, and a hate for this flesh as I am forced to
ramble through this decrepit maze.
As if a child not knowing left from right we wander in these halls.
When I say it is far too much for one to comprehend; if the world could crush a
man, the disgust I have for myself is this.
Why have I been cursed from birth with this flesh, this disease of sin?
I am filthy and I am broken!
How I wish for this to come to an end.
What is this price we have put into such self-worth, how foolish we have
become!
Bend a knee at the feet of filth as if there is gain, for we are the gods of
self as we look to worship our own.
Trust me, yet I must ask, how much longer will I wallow in my own disease?
Iâm here crying aloud so please hear me in my day of torment, my time of
hurting.
Please carry this burden for I can no longer pick up my head.
I beg for time to cease and for the light to come in.
I will scream with all that I am.
What a foolish man I am, what a foolish man I am.
As I beg for time to cease and for the light to come in I will scream with all
that I am.
What a foolish man I am!
