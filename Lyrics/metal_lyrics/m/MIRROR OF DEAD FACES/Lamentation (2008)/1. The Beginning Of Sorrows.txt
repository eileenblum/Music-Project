Now is the time to look not at the past; the things of late might swallow you
up.
Again, now is the time. I tell you the truth, this is an age we live in, an age
where evil abounds and demons walk the earth, a time where I have been blinded
by my own filth and pride.
As we all have heard from many a tongue, the day is near for this is a "sign of
the time.â
I feel so much pain, so much hurt.
Am I alone in this struggle of torment?
The enemy is alert and I have been sleeping, for now is the time and the day is
at hand.
I will rise strong and fight relentlessly.
Peace has been offered thus comfort awaits.
I tell you the truth, this is an age we live in, an age where evil abounds and
demons walk the earth, a time where I have been blinded by my own filth and
pride.
As we all have heard from many a tongue, the day is near for this is a "sign of
the time.â
I feel so much pain so much hurt.
Am I alone in this struggle of torment?
As nation rises against one another and kingdom against kingdom, let it be
known that this is the beginning of sorrows.
Mighty is His name for He is just in all His ways.
Those of us who are broken, rest can be found.
Look not to your own understanding, for through these eyes you will find
nothing to see.
For through these eyes you will find nothing to see!
