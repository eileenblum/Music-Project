Must, I tear out your eyes, your tongue?
You will listen now, for my voice will be heard and you shall note as we drink
of your blood.
I am a hypocrite, you a liar; can you not see the filth we have become?
Sick within my own skin I stand here before you, this dead weight of a rotting
flesh has been our disgust.
Betray this age.
Pain and suffering has been where joy has been found.
You feel as if your are so safe.
Now why do you think this is so?
We hate you, despise you!
There is no warning, not one, remove the blindfold from your eyes.
Horde of swine, this shall torment you!

We hate you, despise you!
There is no warning, not one.
With eyes wide open what do you see?
Horde of swine, this shall torment you!
