I think I have lost my mind
I need to find an out
Trippin in my head
All the time
At peace inside this holy place
I wish I could believe
Still I pray this God
Comes to me

Gave me reasons
Gave me ways
To face another day
A place where I could
Just hang out in

Took all that you gave
Cause I
Knew your little schemes
This won't bring me any
Closer to Him

Wanna change all this
Help me see not guess

Save me
Don't let me
Just fall
Help me walk back to You

I want all
You treasure
It's pleasure
All that it can do

Won't You change all this
Ready to confess

Save me
Don't let me
Just fall
Won't You tell me the truth

I've asked
Myself why
Guess it's faith
Giving purpose to You

Save me
Don't let me fall
Show me
The truth that's all
