The way you look at me
Is not the same
I tried so hard to tell you
I'm to blame
So hold on tight
I'll make things right
You'll see
Just Believe in me

Perfect in every way
Is what you are
And what I've done
Has all but left a scar

So just hold on
And please be strong
For me

I will take your heartache
I will take your tears
I will take your sadness
And all your pain
And all your fears

I will take your heartache
I will take your tears
I will take your sadness
And all your pain
And all your fears
All your fears

Why try and run
&gt;From who you are
I've watched you come undone
Cause when we run
We don't get far
This world can sometimes tear you
Til your torn

A fairytale this was when it began
More camouflage to hide
All the we can
But this is real
All that you see
In me
Trust me and Believe

You can't control not feeling like it was
While holding her
This memory of us
All that you see
I need you to
Believe

Let me take your heartache
Take away the tears
Let me stop this madness
And all your pain
And all your fears

I will take your heartache
I will take your tears
I will take your sadness
And all your pain
And all your fears
