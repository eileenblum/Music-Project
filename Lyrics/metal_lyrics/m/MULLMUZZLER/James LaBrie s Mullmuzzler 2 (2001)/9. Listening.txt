She can do anything
What does she see in me
I wouldn't change a thing
I no longer feel so empty
So I'm listening
No words that I can hear
But I'm seeing
For the first time things are clear

But I'd still like to know
What do I do for you
Wanna be a part of me
Take all you see
Anything of me

I've been in love
And I held on to it's bliss
Never realized
That this kind of love exists

So I'm listening
Your words are what I hear
You have shown me
It's so simple when your near

I've been in love
And I hold on to it's bliss
Now I realize
That this kind of love exists
I'm listening
For the first, for the first time
