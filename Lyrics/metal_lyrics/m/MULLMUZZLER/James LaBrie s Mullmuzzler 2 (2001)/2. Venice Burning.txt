Sometimes life can be so damn cold
When the verdicts in
The streets were alive
The night falling down around
On the prowl again
Catlike moves
The pain betrays the smile
Delicate and sad
A rage of tears subsides
Reality fades into the mask
Then the hunger takes control
Once the hunted in for the kill

No one came, no one saw
On the night that Venice Burned
Tortured souls, they set the sky alight
And don't ever say a word
Familiar hands fanned the flames
That would burn baptismal tears
Where to go it's all come down

Only silence
Venice Burned
Only silence
Venice Burned

In the shadows
In the face of trust
In a piercing blow
Spills the soul of an innocent heart

no one came, no one saw
On the night that Venice Burned

Embers glow and eyes soon fade
And the circle starts again
So set them up, knock them down
As the smoke begins to rise
Where to go, it's all come down

Only silence
Venice burned
Only silence
Venice burned

Darkened room
Late at night
I slip in nice and quiet
I feel the cold
Dark secrets here unfold
Where that cat digs it's claws
At the alter of scars
I taste the cold
The shrine of a twisted soul
Lost my will when I saw
Vengeance on the wall

No one came, no one saw
On the night that Venice Burned

Innocence reduced to filth
That can never wasy away
So stoke the flames
Bare the flesh
Let the branding leave it's mark
The spark of youth
Engulfed and smothered out

Only ashes
Venice Burned
Only ashes
Venice Burned

I must I've got to hold
I'm holding on

Watching Venice Burning
Watching Venice Burning
Watching Venice Burning
Watching Venice Burning
