The world has turned me upside down again
And put me back right where I started from
I could have sworn, that I was fastened in
But you've broken me, now look what I've become
When innocence was all that I embraced
How is it that I fell from your grace
And I'm still

Falling
Falling
I'm still falling
Falling
I'm still falling

So obvious, yet I can't define
A gentle kiss, has never felt so wrong
You say you are, but you were never mine
I know you're here,
But somehow your heart is gone

When the smoke had cleared
And I knew what was true
How is it that I still fell for you
And I'm still

Falling
Falling
Feel like I'm still falling
Falling

Falling
Falling
I'm still falling
Falling
Feel like I'm still falling
Falling
I'm still falling
Falling
Feel like I'm still falling
