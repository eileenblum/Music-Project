Familiar story on my tv screen
Different faces, but it's all the same old thing
I know all the lines to every single scene
And if I stare too long I might even see me
Remote control
Say it isn't so
Get me out of here

I don't want to know
How our story goes
Tell me how it ends
Cause I don't understand
Would you fill me in
Tell me how it ends

Hearing all the words you never said
I'm entertaining fiction in my head
You've caged the bird,
the one that's meant the fly
You're gonna leave him there
and watch him slowly die

I'm not the one
You want in your re-run
Get me out of here

I don't want to know
How our story goes
Tell me how it ends
Cause I don't understand
Would you fill me in
Tell me how it ends

Teardrops
In the doorway
So close to me
But so far away
Thought I knew you
Thought I knew me
Gotta let go
I'm sorry

Lord, be the eyes for me
Cause I can't see
beyond today

Poisoned by the words she wrote
I'm searching for that
Antidote to save me
To save me

I don't want to know
How our story goes
Tell me how it ends
Cause I don't understand
Would you fill me in
Tell me how it ends

I don't want to know
How our story goes
Tell me how it ends
Cause I don't understand
Would you fill me in
Tell me how it ends
