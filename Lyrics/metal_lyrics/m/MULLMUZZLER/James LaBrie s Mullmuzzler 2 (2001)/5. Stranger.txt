Intoxicate my life
Keep wanting more
Never away from me
Now I feel it's over
Still I can't let go
Feel the colds colder

I'm laying down
It washes over me
The only time I feel alive

The cravings never end
Please come again
Take what you want from me

Drifting there again
Here I lose my way
As it slowly invades me

I know I'll never feel the same way
No complicated moods today

I know I should leave you
But I can't resist you
If you touched them
Then they'd understand

If they gave you a try
Know the reasons why I
Love this Stranger
More than all of them

Now I'm with God again
Just you and me my friend
I know You'll never leave my side
My body simply slips away

They say I should leave you
But they've never met you
If you touched them
Then they'll understand

If they gave you a try
Know the reasons why I
Love a Stranger
More than I love them
