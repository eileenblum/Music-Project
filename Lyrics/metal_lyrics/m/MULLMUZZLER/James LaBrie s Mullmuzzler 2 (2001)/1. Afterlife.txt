In the aftermath of an afterthought we come to terms
In a moment no hostile termination
Just reflection on the facts (on the facts)
(as I see them)
All that I, all that I have tried to do is be honest
with myself (yeah)
Now my agenda is shifting focus
Running against the tide of time
In an ocean of complexity and confusion
In the afterimage I've created for myself
In my afterlife - I've come of age
A generation late - my essence and my rage
A state of being here - my spirit soars
After time - after more

Laughter in the left field
Hanging on the ledge of what is real
I think it's gonna be all right
And I know you hear me
'Cause we're not that far apart
Now that I can see beyond myself

Last trip on a strange, strange ride
Every head a big world inside
Hey, it's my turn
Jawbreaker - jawbone
When the truth is finally shown
Now that I can see beyond myself
Now the truth is stranger than fiction
In my revolution of resistance
(now that I, now that I can see)
In a manic manipulation only contradictions follow
No exoneration in my afterimage I've created....

In my afterlife - I've come of age
A generation late - my essence and my rage
A state of being here - my spirit soars
After time - after more

In my afterlife - a soul of years
Beyond the frame of man
The boundaries and the years
In my afterlife the language grows
Feast on purpose - afterglow
