[Allman, Sloyer, Cadden-James, LaBrie]

I feel my future
Tied to my past
Why don't we go and leave this world behind
Watch me as I wonder
Aimless through this mystery
Counting all the times
You've fallen to the cold
You were always there for me
Always said a prayer for me

I'm drifting in time
No reason I find
You always come to my soul
Somehow you believed
There'd always be a season for us to behold
I'm drifting in time
No reason no rhyme
You always come to my soul
I've learned to believe
So thank you for the slow burn you'be brought to my heart
And you are the one
Yes you are the one

I have been too distant
Sometimes just too far away
Let me go and leave it all behind
Sorry if I've hurt you
Sorry for the time we've lost
If you could just forgive me
I'd bow down before you
So that you could see I'm real
So that you could hear these words

I'm drifting in time
No reason I find
You always come to my soul
Somehow you believed
There'd always be a season for us to behold
I'm drifting in time
No reason no rhyme
You always come to my soul
I've learned to believe
So thank you for the slow burn you'be brought to my heart
And you are the one
Yes you are the one

I'm drifting in time
No reason I find
You always come to my soul
Somehow you believed
There'd always be a season for us to behold
I'm drifting in time
No reason no rhyme
You always come to my soul
I've learned to believe
So thank you for the slow burn you'be brought to my heart
And you are the one
Yes you are the one
