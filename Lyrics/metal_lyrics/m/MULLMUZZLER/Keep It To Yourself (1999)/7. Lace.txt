[Guillory, LaBrie]

Sit with me in the corner
Where the lights are low
Maybe you can make it right
Maybe you can make it right
With all the lights still covered
There's something too familiar
A little much to hang onto
A little much to hang onto

What I believed in no longer matters
Won't try and hold onto who I once was

Why should it matter
What I prefer
But society slams me
Thinks I'm less of a man

Now I know I'm wanting
To go back to you
And I don't quite understand
And I don't quite understand
Can't deny these feelings
That are coming through
Is this who I really am
Is this who I really am

I never imagined this that I'm feeling
I finally have something I believe in

It shouldn't matter
This is who I am
But society slams me
Calls me less of a man

I've finally something to believe in
I never imagined what I was feeling

It shouldn't matter
You don't feel the same
But so quick to judge and
You don't understand
