[Guillory, LaBrie]

Nostalgia plays through me
Along with the radio
A taste, a scene, a sound
A touch is not enough

If only I
Had known his fear
So torn and feeling frighened

15 years have passed
A sour taste still curls my tongue
In despair, he danced the air
A life became undone

If only I
Had recognized
A silenced cry of sweet lies

Ma, you know you can't hold me now
Ma, would you like to hold me now

I heard his voice
The trace of tears
Still live within that moment

I heard his voice
He lost his will
One's fate revealed that moment
I heard his voice
The moment ends
So much was said in silence

Ma, you know you can't hold me now
Ma, would you like to hold me now
And if I could I would
If what had happened then today
I hold you close
Not turn away
