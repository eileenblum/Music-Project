[Gardner, LaBrie]

First, the bad news...
Face the music
Mind over matter
In other words...
My imagination run amuck
Give and take with inspiration, information, innovation, impossible situation?
Worsening aggravation
Change, Every change, every step, every moment defined
As a man... as a man... as a man thinks

Shell game in a strait jacket
12 gauge
In a shotgun racket
Shinbone, shindig, shimmy for the Shinto
Got to do this all alone
Wait
Better slow it down and think about it

Embracing this moment
Enslave or free my soul
Just to play the game
With no guarantee
Is what I'll do for now
My life's a requiem playing
Out of key with no 'absolutes' at all
Who promised tomorrow?
Tomorrow may not even be here

How long am I blameless
'Undecided' in a frantic world?
My velocity screaming fast
From this truth I fear
Where did I hear:
'As a man thinks
So is he'?
But this man thinks
'Till his moment's gone'

Scapegoat to the end, dig it?
Whiz-bang
In a whirlwind minute
Voodoo - take a turn
Why not
Nuke my head - feel it burn?
Wind up where you were
If you think about it
Shell game in a strait jacket
12 gauge
In a shotgun racket
Shinbone, shindig, shimmy for the Shinto
Got to do this all alone
Wait
Better slow it down and think about it
Better slow it down
Take a moment right now
Let a man think
As a man thinks
What a man thinks...

(Hey there Budapest)
(What about... let's just give it a rest)

Scapegoat to the end, dig it?
Whiz-bang
In a whirlwind minute
Voodoo - take a turn
Why not
Nuke my head - feel it burn?
Wind up where you were
If you think about it
Shell game in a strait jacket
12 gauge
In a shotgun racket
Shinbone, shindig, shimmy for the Shinto
Got to do this all alone
Wait
Better slow it down and think about it
Better slow it down
Take a moment right now
Let a man think
As a man thinks
What a man thinks...

Bottom line?
Get it in
Get it off
Get it out
Get away
Get a buck
Get a clue
Now he just wants more

And he feels it
Now...
No more indecisions here
No more time to figure things out
No more lies
No mortal sin
He'll pay up square
But he won't get in
Too many opportunities
Too many reasons
Too many travesties
Now for the good news
It's gonna get...
Gonna get wild
When you wake up and realize
You've still got it all

(Hey there Budapest)
(How about next time we do our damn best?)
