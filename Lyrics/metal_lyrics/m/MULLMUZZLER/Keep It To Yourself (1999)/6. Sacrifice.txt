[Allman, Sloyer, Cadden-James, LaBrie]

I remember
A time when I was free when I could fly away
Sky's the limit
I sang my song it was my dream and still is today

Changes come
Changes go
Where they lead I just don't have a say
Don't have a say

Do you remember
The time I traveled sing my songs to all the world
You were stronger
But that's all gone and that's okay, you're still my girl

Seasons come
Seasons go
Where they lead I just don't ever know
Don't ever know

I know you need me here to see you through
I'm gonna make your eyes shine like brand new
I'd sacrifice all that I have and more
Forever until death do us part

All those pictures
Painted by your hand I still remember
How beautiful
Nothing's changed you're still the one I'm dreaming of

Just this morning
You awoke and took my hand I smiled inside
How long we have here
Left to us, we'll do our best and enjoy the ride

Good times come
Good times go
When they've gone how will we ever know
We ever know

I know you need me here to see you through
I'm gonna make your eyes shine like brand new
I'd sacrifice all that I have and more
Forever until death do us part
