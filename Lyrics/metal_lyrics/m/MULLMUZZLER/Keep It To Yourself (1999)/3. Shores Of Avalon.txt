[Allman, Sloyer, Cadden-James, LaBrie]

I never saw it coming
Somehow the heat of battle
Sure dulled my senses to the real world
Or was I dreaming?
She held my hand and knew me
She looked right through all I knew

Lie quiet, let the rain wash over me now

Inside the royal chambers
She's staring out her window
Tears well hidden by a crimson veil
This is the poison
Clutching a Turkish dagger
By the moonlight I feel it begin

I'm wounded, let the pain wash over me now

Loneliness again
Sits here alongside of me
Gotta make my way
To where the waters heal my wounds
I know this is where I'll stay
Too jaded by her deception
A trust I thought to believe
I just wanna rest
And live out the best of my days
When I reach Avalon

Walking to my window
I'm feeling weak and so betrayed by all I've lost
I'm left here
To comprehend this strange barrage of lies

By the dawn's early light
The war had raged through the night
I turned to her I thought I heard her crying
I could see by her face
Before she laid to me waste
That there was someone she's dying for
Someone else out there besides me

I'm fading, let the fear drain away from me now

My fear's been broken
As the healing waters poured over me
And I begin to feel
Feel its magic strengthen me
I know this is where I'll stay
Can't take anymore deception
I just want peace in my heart
This calm I am feeling
I've never known until
Until I reach Avalon

Lie quiet, let the pain wash away from me now

No beginning or end
All of the roles we pass on through
I looked inside and I saw
My soul's my guide, I need to walk with you
I know this is where I'll stay
The world I've left behind
Has no place in my heart
I can finally rest
And live out the rest of my days
I'll never leave Avalon
