Bleeding, my silence
Will yield no more
All the reason that are given
For the sake of power
Murder, this murder
Will bleed on me
All the devils of the past
And the present and future
Sucking your disease

My war is coming quickly
A war you will not survive
Measure of your worth
Isn't your riches
We'll taste the dirt with
A hole inside your soul

My war is coming quickly
With it you will surely die
All eyes will see now
Chronicles of the dead
All eyes will bleed now
Chronicles of theâ¦ dead

Masses, tolerate the noise I'm fed
Misinterpretation of a god
Has left you maggots
Destroy, destroy the heart of man
There will come a time you sheep
Will scream forgiveness
But it's too late then

My war is coming quickly
A war you will not survive
Measure of your worth
Isn't your riches
We'll taste the dirt with
A hole inside your soul

My war is coming quickly
With it you will surely die
All eyes will see now
Chronicles of the dead
All eyes will bleed now
Chronicles of

I see the fires in the distance
Inhale the ash of resistance
Burn it all and give no mercy
Won't stop 'cause I want you dead

You can see it in their eyes
You all will beg for mercy
You can see it all in their eyes
The last breath to die

But it's too late then
My war is coming quickly
A war you will not survive
Measure of your worth
Isn't your riches
We'll taste the dirt with
A hole inside your soul

My war is coming quickly
With it you will surely die

You can see it in their eyes
You all will beg for mercy
You can see it in their eyes
The last breath to die

How many times must
A good man die
Before we listen to
The shit he said
Just vagabonds in
No man's land until now

I see the fires in the distance
Inhale the ash of resistance
Burn it all and give no mercy
Won't stop 'cause I want you dead
You can see it in their eyes
You all will beg for mercy
You can see it in their eyes
The last breath to die
