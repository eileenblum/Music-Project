Born into a lie
Arrogance has made them blind
You give but they take away
Talk about control
Through debt they own us all
Mankind will never change

I can see it coming
I'd love to watch it burn you down

To ask is to need
To need is to bleed
They'll take it away
Your will to fight another day

Burn it to the ground
Den of thieves still safe and sound
What advice could I give but pray
Maybe it's our fate
Maybe we are just far too late
Mankind will never change

I can see it coming
I'd love to watch it burn you down

To ask is to need
To need is to bleed
They'll take it away
Your will to fight another day

So many secrets lay waste
To the walls
The prowess for a liberal lie
Your optimism for a time of peace
Shows ignorance

To a frantic mindless empire
So many dead in the sight
Of you all
The promise is a dying tomb
Seduce to pacify a psychotic race
And liberate a lie that feeds your
Every desire

Precipitate your induction to pain
The destitution of your
Soul laid to waste
Pornographic obscenity
Spreads rampant through the
Halls that hold your peace
So many dead in the sight
Of you all
The liberation of a people denied
The populous of a dying world
Overturn and overrun in the
Blink of an eye

To ask is to need
To need is to bleed
They'll take it away
World on fire

Time is not your friend
History is full of evil men
Usher all to the dying day
So full of hate
Bleeding through
All our mistakes
Kill each other 'cause we'll
Never change

I can see it coming
I'd love to watch it burn you down

To ask is to need
To need is to bleed
They'll take it away
Your will to fight another day
They rule with control
The mind won't let go
Beware of the liar
World on fire

World on fire

Words won't save
'Cause it's far too late
You won't hear anyway

Words won't save
'Cause it's far too late
You won't hear anyway
