I've walked an empty road
Many have walked before
Chosen to embrace all death
With a mouth that's full of war

All the things of the past
Become a constant test
The only way out of pain
Is to welcome it

I've walked a violent path, I wish I've never known
Screaming pain surrounded me and the king of misery left his throne
My vision becomes the very thing I need
The patriarch overcomes my shattered enemies

Your final war
Self-righteous and egotistical
Turn my back on you all
I just take it anymore

I see you drowning, fading, falling down

Turning point of our lives
Are held in contempt
Needle prick in your side when
You're reminded of it
Ignorance on display
The coming of the end
Take a bow to the crowd
And all your plastic friends
Your final war
I just couldn't take it anymore

I have bled for you all
In this life
Good things die

All the things of the past
Become a constant test
The only way out of pain
Is to welcome it

Your final war
Self-righteous and egotistical
Turn my back on you all
I just couldn't take it anymore
