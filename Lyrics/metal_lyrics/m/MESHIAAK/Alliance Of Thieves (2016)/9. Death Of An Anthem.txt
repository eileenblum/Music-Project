As darkness comes in the shadows
Watching all that we've done
It comes for me this coldness
Rising dead memories

Stare at the sun words dance
And burn the tips of our tongue
And now and then we breath it in
For our daughters and sons

The seas won't change until I make them
Stay away
I will not regress from this
Stay away
The memories I choose to forget
This is the death of an anthem

How many times must I lay here
And think of all that I've done every day
It made me hate who I'd become
Think of all that I've done

The seas won't change
Until I make them stay away
I will not regress from this
My life is worth more than this
Stay away
The memories I choose to forget
This is the death of an anthem

I will not regress from this
My life is worth more than this
The memories I choose to forget
This is the death of an anthem

Cannot escape
The damage
Has already been done
As time moves on
The feelings
Of emptiness carry on

I will not regress from this
My life is worth more than this
The memories I choose to forget
This is the death of an anthem
