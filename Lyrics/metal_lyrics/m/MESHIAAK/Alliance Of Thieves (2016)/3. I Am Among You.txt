I am among you

I live among the dead
A thousand faceless eyes see no one
Feels the way I feel
Or bleed the way I bleed

I am the worm inside you
Give you all you'll ever need
I am the voice inside you
Subconscious entity

I feel my hands are shaking
I am excited to meet you here

I am the worm inside you
Give you all you'll ever need
I am the voice inside you
Now I bring you to your knees

I am the thing inside of you screaming
Become the black inside
Slowly rapes your soul
You all will become my whores

I am the thing inside of you screaming
Become the black inside
Slowly rapes your soul
You all will become my whores

All the years of brokenness
And the years of worthlessness
All for nothing
No one saw the sacrifice
So give me all that you can give
Picking up the pieces left behind

I should not be
The one you come to find
The agonies of life
Are buried within my mind
I have lied
To you
I can't deny

Slowly rapes your soul
You all
Will become
My whores

I am the worm inside you
Give you all you'll ever need
I am the voice inside you
I am among you!
