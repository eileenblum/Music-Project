Another man felt the sting of life
Said he heard voices call from the other side
Bit down hard on what he hoped was courage and prayed
All his life he felt the other side could offer more than this mortal life
All bottled up he couldn't see
That there could be another way
So he faded away

Bound by faceless sorrow
Wreathed in flames
No one sees or hears their pain
The suffering
Wait and bleed in total disarray
Nothing pacifies the pain
The suffering

Another life's been taken today
Nobody heard her crying in pain
Lived her life all alone
In comfort of fear
Friends all say
They never saw the signs
Unanswered questions
Filling their minds
Now all that's left is
The haunted face of a memory
She faded away

Bound by faceless sorrow
Wreathed in flames
No one sees or hears their pain
The suffering
Wait and bleed in total disarray
Nothing pacifies the pain
The suffering

We fight together
And earn our scars
We're still alive and we vow
We're brothers in arms
Till the last breath taken
Your war is ours
We'll stand beside you and fight
We're brothers in arms

Taking on life
One step at a time
Is never really easy
When you're on your knees
Living with depression
And it's maniac disease
Some turn to drugs
And some to knife
Other take some broken glass
And cut at their life
To all the fallen soldiers
That have stood at the gate
To everyone that's sought to
Have their soul escape
We know how you feel alone
We too have felt alone
I know you feel alone
I too have felt alone

We know how you feel alone
We too have felt alone
I know you feel alone
I too have felt alone

We fight together
And earn our scars
We're still alive and we vow
We're brothers in arms
Till the last breath taken
Your war is ours
We'll stand beside you and fight
We're brothers in arms
