Pride yourself in the cracks of society
Hide yourself in the cracks of authority
We feel suffocated, beat down, manipulated
We all feel the bastards' claws
Lips sewn shut with wired jaws

No free speech, no such thing
Making your attack against
The superficial laws
Legs spreading wider for the psychopathic whore
Eyes wide shut for a policy of hate
Inject true lies and join in
Their debate

Intimidation has to die
The coalition has to die
Pride yourself in the cracks of society
Hide yourself in the cracks of authority

Tyrants, embraced in warfare
Paid off so it burns at both
Ends we're all part of
The greater scheme
Fixed election a buyers dream

No one vote and see who wins

Planning your attack
Against the parliamental whore
Legs spreading wider than
They ever have before
Ministry in pain becomes
The shelter we embrace
Deaf, dumb and lame
The pathetic human race
Intimidation has to die
The coalition has to die
Human race has to die
Justice is a fucking lie

We live endangered lives
We breed they multiply
They break into our lives
The war pigs of our time

We live endangered lives
We breed they multiply
They break into our lives
The war pigs of our time

Hide yourself in the cracks of authority
Intimidation has to die
The coalition has to die
Human race has to die
The oppression has to die

Pride yourself in the cracks of society
Hide yourself in the cracks of authority
Pride yourself in the cracks of society
Hide yourself in the cracks of authority
