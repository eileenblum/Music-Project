I've seen their bloodshed eyes
Abandonment
Has justice weak and blind
Outstretched and disfigured men
The catalyst
To leave us all behind

They live immortal
'Til the institution becomes obsolete
Burns us all

I've seen the wretched burnt alive
I've heard the screams of nations defiled

Feed off man's inadequacies
To stimulate their own sensibility
All outcast deviates
Come rise against
Have your mind set free
Terrified and maniacal, belligerent
Fanatics rape the land
Carved in stone for a thousand years of prophecy
That wavers on demand
They live immortal
'Til the institution becomes obsolete
Burns us all

Breathe in sulfur
'Til the institution we crush obsolete holocaust

I've seen the wretched burnt alive
I've heard the screams of nations defiled

Through the stained glass we can't see
The malevolent hierarchy
Nothing seems to pacify
The intent here
Do we live or die
All reason nullified
Lost children locked inside
Sociopaths now lead the way
All we've done here
Is build another lie

The difference is life and death

Through the stained glass we can't see
The malevolent hierarchy
Nothing seems to pacify
The intent here
Do we live or die
All reason nullified
Lost children locked inside
Sociopaths now lead the way
The intent here
Do we live or die
