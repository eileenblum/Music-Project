This way comes those things of old
They swirl around inside my head
I used to think I'd be better off dead
And the wounded heart
It was ripped apart

Then sitting down with my head in my hands
I had to go
I had to run again
I am now at the edge of the world
If I could seek
The new black call
I am now at the edge of the world
If I could seek

Now I am standing hear
Now that everything's left in the air
I never know if I'm satisfied
Always feeling that the time has come for death
And the faceless crowd
It becomes all so black in my head
I am now at the edge of the world
I had to go
I had to run again

I am now at the edge of the world
If I could seek
The new black call
I'm not alive
I am now at the edge of the world
If I could seek

I never saw the things you saw in me
I never had the answers to the dream
All the years I let just slip away
I won't forget until my dying day

I am now at the edge of the world
If I could seek
The new black call
I'm not alive
I am now at the edge of the world
If I could seek
The new black call
