Trapped in the dawn
and the air is bitter cold
the clouds don't feel the sun, behold.

Fear of God
and the angels sing no more
a dying will submit
with hope.

They learn the truth
unholy tears won't save their breed
forever damned, let the sinners flee.

Fallen from grace
the evil in your heart
had made you face the... unfold.

Infedels, enchanted from above
just send you straight to hell, foretold.

As the shadows pass the moon
Unholy tears won't save your breed
forever damned, say your prayers in plea
