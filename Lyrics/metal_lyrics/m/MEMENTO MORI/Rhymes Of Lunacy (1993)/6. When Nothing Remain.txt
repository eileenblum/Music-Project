Do you believe that all is lost,
when we close our eyes, to die?
The thoughts we thought, the words we spoke
tell me - is there a reason why?

When all is done
our moment in time is done
when all is done
when nothing remains.

Do you believe our souls survive
to live on lucky clouds above?
Or do you fear, when our time is up,
something evil awaits below?

And you better believe it...
I do believe that all is lost when we close our eyes and die
the songs we sang, the deeds we've done
don't say - there's no reason why.
