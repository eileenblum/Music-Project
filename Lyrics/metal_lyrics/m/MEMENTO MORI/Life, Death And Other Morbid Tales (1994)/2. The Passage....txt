Lost in labyrinths
Trapped on threshold to reality
An invisible twin
A shortcut to insanity

The loyal best friend that I dreamed up
Took advantage of my vastness of weak spots
I had no nobody and neither did he
So I let him share my body - weird idea
Dethroned it's master wore a cloth of confusion
This disembodied body thing has grown out of propotion
We've come too far to stop now, I got everything to gain
And some say insane is sane.
