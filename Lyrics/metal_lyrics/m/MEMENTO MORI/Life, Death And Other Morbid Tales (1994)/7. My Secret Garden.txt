There's a place in my heart
You will never see
A cold and lifeless garden
The graveyard of my soul

Black clouds kill the light
A twisted soul's delight

Eternal darkness
My secret garden

The seasons they might change
But cold winds blowing still
Nursing seeds of hatred
The only thing that spring

Black clouds kill the sun
The twisted soul has won

Eternal winter
My secret garden

A bible black deceivers
The Judas of our time
Blinded eyes can't see
The twisted soul in me

Eternal darkness
My secret garden
Eternal winter
My secret garden
Eternal darkness
My secret garden
Eternal winter
My secret garden
