I've sailed on crimson seas
I've wondered endless planes
I've seen beyond the stars
I'm there but still I'm here

Free your imagination
And all secrets within
Use your imagination
And you'll travel within

I've chased the rainbow's end
I've touched it's hidden gold
I've tasted the serpent's kiss
It's sour but still so sweet

Free your imagination
And all secrets within
Use your imagination
And you'll travel within

Open up your mind
To see what lies within
Close your eyes and fly
Our journey will begin

You fly above the clouds
You grace an angel's wing
You fly like Peter Pan
Like a bird but still a man

Free your imagination
And all secrets within
Use your imagination
And you'll travel within
Free your imagination
And all secrets within
Use your imagination
And you'll travel within
Free your imagination
And all secrets within
Use your imagination
And you'll travel within
Free your imagination
And all secrets within
Use your imagination
And you'll travel within
[repeat and fade]
