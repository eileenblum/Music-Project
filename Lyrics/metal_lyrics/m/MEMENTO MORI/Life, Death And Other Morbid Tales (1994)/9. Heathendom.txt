Damn of darkness' unbroken beams
Blinds their eyes and steals their dreams
Torch -lit figures against the black
Nuns berzek the way thay've planned the attack

Close your eyes so you can see
Heathendom, only sinners bleed, Heathemdom
Brace your selves, embrace your sense
Heathendom, be no infidels, Heathendom
Shield your ears so you can hear
Heathemdom, Armageddon't near, Heathendom
Heathendom

They are many but they are weak
We are few but we are strong
Heathendom

Dark deceivers by lightnings struck
Spineless creatures runs amock
Odin's punishment when betrayed
I can see in darkness, I'm not afraid

Close your eyes so you can see
Heathendom, only sinners bleed, Heathendom
Brace your selves, embrace your sense
Heathendom, be no infidels, Heathendom
Shield your ears so you can hear
Heathemdom, armageddon't near, Heathendom

My kinsemen were no sinners until
They began to follow someone elses will
Who are those who knows what is best for me
Evangels or angels, spreading their gospel
From Heaven sent by the king of kings
To save us from ourselves and mortal sins
God knows forgiveness, it's human to fail
In life, death and other morbid tales
Tales of wonders and walks upon water
Nothing but sorrow is what they've brought here
Weather with or against the new Messiah
Foes shall be cleansed in the lake of fire

Grant me strength to carry it's weight
A pagan's yoke of bondage
Inherited faith in unison with hate
Hear my heathen prayer

If magic mist shall vanish it must
Be over my dead body
Faithful breath, the breath that I breathe
Must go on from father to son, I'll bequeath
Bequeath, bequeath

Heathendom, Heathendom
Heathendom, Heathendom...
