Look in my eyes, tell me what you see
A glimpse of life's misery
Left in the dark like a little boy
No more mom and dad's pride and joy

Don't let me live in solitude
Don't let me die in solitude

Listen to me as I sing my song
Tell me what I have done wrong
Left in the sandpit, a broken toy
No more anyone's pride and joy

Don't let me live in solitude
Don't let me die in solitude

Wayward and cold, there's no place for me
No one to grant me, my plea
Left in despair, I'm a little boy
No more will I feel pride or joy

Don't let me live in solitude
Don't let me die in solitude
You let me live in solitude
You let me die in solitude
