Lost and lonely, fed on fears
Silent crying, 'cause no one hears
I'm abandoned, I lost my faith
A bitter taste of my tears

I am lost, forever lost
Can't you heal me?

I am burning, I can not hide
I am nothing, I lost my pride
Stumbling further on the path
Where my last hope slowly died

I am lost, forever lost
Can't you heal me?

I have struggled far too long
Now I'm weaker, I'm not so strong
Give me guidance, give me strength
Take my hand 'cause we belong

Am I lost, forever lost?
You can heal me
I have struggled too long
You can heal me
I am nothing but lost
You can heal me
I have struggled too long
You can heal me
I am nothing byt lost
You can heal me
