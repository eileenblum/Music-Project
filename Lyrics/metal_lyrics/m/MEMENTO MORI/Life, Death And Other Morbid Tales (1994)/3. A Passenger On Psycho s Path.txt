Is this for real?
What is this thing that I feel?
I'm so confused
Control I lose
I'm beeing abused

Save me from myself

Upon the psycho's path [4x]

Some say sane is insane
It may damage your brain
I say nothingness reign

Am I myself?
If not I'm me, who am I?
Behold, I change
Before your eyes
I'm changing shape

Save me from myself

Upon the psycho's path [4x]

Some say nothingness reign
It may damage your brain
I say sane is insane

Did you hear the voice that whispered?
As I elbowed through the crowd
That's my disembodied spirit
Even silence is too loud, loud, loud, loud
I realize I'm stuck on psycho's path
