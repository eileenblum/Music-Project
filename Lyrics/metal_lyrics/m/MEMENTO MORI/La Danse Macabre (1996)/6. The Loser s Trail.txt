Life's a painful stride
Shameful tears I'll hide
Step by step a limping gait
Mile after mile a faithless state

Stumbling on through thick and thin
Through the shadows and within
The longest race can not be won
The loser's trail I walk upon

I'm a wayward child
Pure but yet defiled
Day by day a friendless age
Yea rafter year an ageless race

Stumbling on through thick and thin
Through the shadows and within
The longest race can not be won
The loser's trail I walk upon

Stumbling on through thick and thin
Through the shadows and within
The longest race can not be won
The loser's trail I walk upon
Stumbling on through thick and thin
Through the shadows and within
The longest race can not be won
The loser's trail I walk upon
