Lost tales of pain and sorrow
Obscured by time
Unseen the tearshed follow
Rhyme after rhyme

Tales of misery
Words of misery
Lost for evermore
Lost in nevermore

Lost words by sad and hollowed
Voices decline
Untold but still enticing
Thoughts to entwine

Tales of misery
Words of misery
Lost for evermore
Lost forever

Somewhere in blackened eons
Memories will stray
Unheard in timeless silence
Shrouded they'll stay

Tales of misery
Words of misery
Lost for evermore
Lost in nevermore
Tales of misery
Words of misery
