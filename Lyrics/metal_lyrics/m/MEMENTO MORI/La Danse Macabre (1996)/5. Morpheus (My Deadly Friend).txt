Oh God, I wish the morning came
I still hear them
They're singing in the dark
Creation infernal, unholy overture

In the shadows of my attic
Morpheus, my deadly friend
I'm begging thee, please leave me be

Oh God, I wish the morning came
I still hear them
The twisted shapes I dread
Consealed yet so present

In timeless hours drowned in
Fear for the sandman
I'm awaiting in the dark
I'm giggling and laughing
Libretto of the damned

In the shadows of my attic
Morpheus, my deadly friend
I'm begging thee, please leave me be
Dark shadows

Oh God, I wish the morning came
I still hear them
&gt;From every angle burning eyes
Godless hatred
A gathering, grotesque

In the shadows of my attic
Morpheus, my deadly friend
I'm begging thee, please leave me be

Beyond my mind, a frightful kind
Giggling, squirming, twisting, turning
I'm begging thee, please leave me be

In the shadows [5x]
