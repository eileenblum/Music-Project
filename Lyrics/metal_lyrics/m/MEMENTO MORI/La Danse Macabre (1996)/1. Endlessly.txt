Light, light fades to grey
Time, time slips away
Time slips away

Endlessly
Graced by the veils of my mind
Endlessly
Endlessly
Graced by the veils of my mind
Endlessly

Life, life found a way
Dreams, they came to stay
They came to stay

Endlessly
Graced by the veils of my mind
Endlessly
Endlessly
Graced by the veils of my mind
Endlessly

Free, free from my pain
Flee, flee the mundane
Tear the mundane

Endlessly
Graced by the veils of my mind
Endlessly
Endlessly
Graced by the veils of my mind
Endlessly
Endlessly
Graced by the veils of my mind
Endlessly
Endlessly
Graced by the veils of my mind
Endlessly
