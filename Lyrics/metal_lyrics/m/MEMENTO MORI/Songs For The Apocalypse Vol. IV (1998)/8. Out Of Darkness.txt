[music: Argento, Wead, Marcolin, lyrics: Wead]

From my black tongue, words of scorn
Out of darkness, my ways were born

I can still fear their presence
The thoughts within my mind
Frail dreams of wayward essence
A deal that's yet unsigned
So mean, unclean and godless
The roots I'm scared to find
Their needs are often heartless
Like truth that's long declined

Strange and vain are the feelings
As my mind can flow free
These unpleasant revealings
Can they really be me?

From my black tongue, words of scorn
Out of darkness, my ways were born

My thoughts will pull me under
Life spinning round and round
Where will it stop, I wonder
No trace of solid ground
Like seconds into hours
My days are passing by
I'll climb an endless tower
As life's an endless lie

Strange and vain are the feelings
As my mind can flow free
These unpleasant revealings
Can they really be me?
