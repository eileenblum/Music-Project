[music and lyrics: Marcolin]

Living your life in such a rush
You have so much to do, time is not enough
Never a thought about that day
When you'll be dead and gone and passed away

Memento mori, remember death
Memento mori, your final breath
Life is not forever, never forget
Memento mori, eternal rest

You feel afraid to face the end
It's much easier to just pretend
That you will live forever more
But no one does and that's for sure

Working so hard to reach your dreams
Feeling invinsible or so it seems
You keep on bying things you need
No need for anything to rest in peace

Memento mori, remember death
Memento mori, your final breath
Life is not forever, never forget
Memento mori, eternal rest

The day you die it's all too late
No second chance to change your fate
Enjoy the time while you're alive
Or you will find life passed you by
