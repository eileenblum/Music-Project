[music: Argento, Marcolin, lyrics: Wead]

I bid my last wits a sad goodbye
Sundown is closing in
There are secrets the dreamland keep
More than meets the eye

Eyes deceiving false conceiving
Thoughts misleading fear's exceeding

It is the things you see
And the things you don't
It is the things you hear
And the things you won't

Dancing shadows upon my wall
Nightmares closing in
They have won if I fall asleep
Then I'm surely lost

The walls are bleeding, painful breathing
The night's impending, a fright unending

It is the things you see
And the things you don't
It is the things you hear
And the things you won't

The walls are bleeding, painful breathing
The night's impending, a fright unending

It is the things you see
And the things you don't
It is the things you hear
And the things you won't
The things you see
The things you see
The things you see
The things you see
