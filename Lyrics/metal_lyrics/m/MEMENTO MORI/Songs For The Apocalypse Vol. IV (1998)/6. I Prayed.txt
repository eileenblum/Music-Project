[music: Wead, Marcolin, lyrics: Marcolin]

My father was undergoing surgery
His heart had failed him so terribly
The operation was very dangerous
I felt so helpless I thought of God

I prayed my father would not die
I prayed that he would be just fine
I prayed to God to see him through
I prayed and I believed in You

When I was stuck by harsh reality
It opened up my eyes so I could see
While I was sitting there in the waiting room
There was only one thing I could do

I prayed my father would not die
I prayed that he would be just fine
I prayed to God to see him through
I prayed and I believed in You

Please God, forgive my sins
Please let my father live
Please God, hear my prayers

I prayed and he did not die
I prayed and now he is just fine
I prayed and God saw him through
I prayed and I believe in You
