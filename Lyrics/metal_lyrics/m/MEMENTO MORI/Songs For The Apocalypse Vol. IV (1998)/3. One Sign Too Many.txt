[music: Wead, Marcolin, lyrics: Wead]

Silent storm clouds
Slow they came, in God's name
Bold and blinded
We're the same, still no shame

Is this our fall from grace?
Is this our final trace?
Is this the end of time?
In this eleventh chime

One sign too many [2x]

The crown of nature
Pagan fools, pagan rules
A lost creation
Seals the womb, seals the tomb

Is this our fall from grace?
Is this our final trace?
Is this the end of time?
In this eleventh chime
Are we the last in line
To read the clearest sign
