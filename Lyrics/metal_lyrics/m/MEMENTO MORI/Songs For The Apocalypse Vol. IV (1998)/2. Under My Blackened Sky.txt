[music: Argento, Wead, lyrics: Wead]

Come rain, come shine, no lie of mine

Eternal dark is my shrine
The sun might shine outside but in my heart death hides
I'll take your hand, end your stride
I'll lead you through to the other side

Into a world so old
Into a world so cold
Under a blackened sky
This is a world foretold
I belong here

Under my blackened sky there is no sun in sight
Under my blackened sky you belong here

Come shine, come rain, true words of mine

Let's go my friend, please follow
When you're out of this world, you're way beyond sorrow
Your time in life has passed and gone
The race you led it is all but won

Into a world so old
Into a world so cold
Under a blackened sky
This is a world foretold
We belong here

Under my blackened sky grasp for the final breath
Under my blackened sky you become death

Under my blackened sky [5x]
