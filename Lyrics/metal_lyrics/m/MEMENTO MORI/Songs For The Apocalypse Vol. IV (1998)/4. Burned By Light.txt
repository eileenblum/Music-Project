[music and lyrics: Wead]

The fallen and graceless, the twisted and odd
Outcasts from heaven, abandoned by God

Wakeless in daylight, evoked by the night
When sneaking in shadows, they're well out of sight

Wayward angels
Burned by light, blessed by night
Nocturnal seed, unholy breed
Burned by light, blessed by night
Nocturnal seed, unholy breed

Creeping and crawling, the shapeless and vague
What's unseen by mankind still feared like the plague
Their spirits are strong and your flesh is so weak
Who dares to get close when their find is their keep

Wayward angels
Burned by light, blessed by night
Nocturnal seed, unholy breed
Burned by light, blessed by night
Nocturnal seed, unholy breed

Keep all of your lights lit when hundled in fear
The ancient and timeless, abstracted still near

If silence at twillight might lead you astray
When fooled by it's stillness you won't get away

Wayward angels
Burned by light, blessed by night
Nocturnal seed, unholy breed
Burned by light, blessed by night
Nocturnal seed, unholy breed
