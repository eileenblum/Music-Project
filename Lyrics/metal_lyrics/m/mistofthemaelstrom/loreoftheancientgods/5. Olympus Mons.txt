Maker of stone, rise...
Bringer of fire, rise, rise!

Wake from thy slumber
Raise thy peak
You will be a god again
Hail to thee!

Sleeping, waiting
An ancient power
Maker of stone, bringer of fire
Rise
Restore thy fallen summit
Reign once more
Spread thy fire, thy fury
Upon the surface of mars

Spread thy fire
Thy fury
On the surface
Of mars
