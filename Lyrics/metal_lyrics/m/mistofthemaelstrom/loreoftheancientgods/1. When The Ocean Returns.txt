I went to the valley
alone with my thoughts
cold wind from the mountains
caresses my face
Oh, where will I wander
when the ocean returns?
Oh, where will I wander
when the darkness surrounds?

Past sunset I stay here
and wait for the dawn
After dusk I remain here
to see the first light
I'll wait for all ages
I'll wait for all time
all will be forgotten
when the ocean returns

I'll wait for all time
I'll wait for all time

As the waters rise,
here I am standing
waiting for the end of all things

When the ocean returns
Here I will wait

I went to the valley
alone with my thoughts
cold wind from the mountains
caresses my face
Oh, where will I wander
when the ocean returns?
Oh, where will I wander
when the darkness surrounds?
