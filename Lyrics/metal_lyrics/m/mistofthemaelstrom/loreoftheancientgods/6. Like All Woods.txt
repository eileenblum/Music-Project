Autumn falls once again
Just as ten thousand times before
This wood is like all woods
This wood is mine

Arachnid, weave your silken web among the grasses
Beyond the forest in this immortal lea
Nothing dies here, no leaves fallen
This land is immortal
Nothing dies here, no leaves fall in
the immortal lea
