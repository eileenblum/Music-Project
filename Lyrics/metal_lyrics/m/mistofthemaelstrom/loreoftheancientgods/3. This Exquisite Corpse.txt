See you transform
before my ever-watching eye
Life to death
Profane to sacred
Mortal to immortal
No decay
No decay
Purify

Purity of form
for all time
Your new godlike mold
This exquisite corpse

(What choice do you have? To wither into nothingness, alone and forgotten, or to outlast the ages? To reach what lies beyond, you must pass through life.)
(One day you will hang beside the screaming dead, and on that day you will achieve perfection in parched skin and dry bone. You will achieve immortality)
(All the beauty of a man's life fades with his dying breath; the only undying beauty is death.)
