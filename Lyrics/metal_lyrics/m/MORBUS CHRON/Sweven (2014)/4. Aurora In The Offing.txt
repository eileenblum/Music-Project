He was struck in a flesh ridden hearth
And the cup was soon filled to the brim
with all the spoils of his provenance

Just moments before the burst
the cosmos was completely submersed
And the compression of the accumulation
needed no longer to work

So ready was the bubble to burst and evolve
A dawning of new life in the offing
