The sand is cast to tuck me in
and in the wake of sleep I wish to be shed of old skin

Surmounting the heavens I'd climb higher
to obtain the bliss that I desire
Hitting the nethermost of bottoms I'd dig lower
to reveal the plane I must discover

The sand is cast to tuck me in
and in the wake of sleep I'll ride on vigorous wings
