There's a hole in heaven's floor
It is visible from this summit
Beyond life's sealed abode
Lie the thriving fields I covet

How could anyone know true beauty,
when this sight is only mine?
And how could anyone go astern,
having seen creation's unrivaled prime?

I assemble my body
I focus my mind
To take the final step
and leave everything behind
