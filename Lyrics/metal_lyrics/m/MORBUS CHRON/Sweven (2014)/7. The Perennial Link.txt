Our steps grew silent as we came to a halt
Around us leaves joined in on an airy waltz
I was smitten and so I swayed along

In the midst of the act a tree rose tall
First one, then many, the leaves began to fall
And that which had shone hidden
now burned clearly above the crown

A Perennial Link
Dividing two spheres
Ablazing dew tears

Inside the raging tempest
I latched around a branch
Leaf piles were sent skyward
to carry out another dance
And through the storm eventually calmed
and downwards the dancers went
their mirth had once again fueled my dire ascent
