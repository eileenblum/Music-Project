Robbed of my senses, I trust this storm
to nurse me through birth and adolescence
with my controls set for the heart of the sun
So I can travel safely on foreign streams
and dare to cross the fragile bridges,
barely standing over abysmal ravines

In my hand I hold my mentor
Above us the stars align
They're taking me to where the sky yawns
and guiding our way, they shine
Alleviating a world that reaches
from present to time out of mind
