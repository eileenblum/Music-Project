Towards a dark sky
Soaring through gas formations
of orgasmic astral sensations

In a world so sublime
Where flesh seldom tread
We're sharing a starlit bed
Above the trenches of reality
Our soul intertwine
Being lost in time

Within this womb now flow the essence to a greater thought
And though I'll prosper soon, I need to shrink all mass into a dot
Even the smallest grain could block the rays of Ra to reach my skin
My atoms scream, they beg to realise what must begin

Spawning now is the splendour of a different kind
Witness how the blueprints for life are redefined
