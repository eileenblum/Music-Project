And from nothingness an explosion came to be
Illuminating it's path to shine light upon an infant sea
At the center of the void a hammer was set in motion
Each strike pushing creation towards it's culmination

From the initial spark are steps no man can follow
Through the far off dark it still stretches in the hollow
