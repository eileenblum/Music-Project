Eyes pop open with death in sight
Bodies in piles, for you to ignite
Smell of burning organs fills your lung
Taste of rotten flesh, rip out your tongue

Earth collapses and death is crowned
Obscurity surrounds, with hell rising to ground
Alone you act, cowardly or brave
You'll still dig your ugly grave

Lonely insanity, fills you with fright
Crawling in despair, reaching for light

A path of hope is found
As your dragged back under ground

In Obscuritas
In Obscuritas
