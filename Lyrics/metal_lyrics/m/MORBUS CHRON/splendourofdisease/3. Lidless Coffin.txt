Human brough in, dripping with pus
Doctors approach, much to discuss
Disfigure the body, amputate the head
State is confirmed as dead
Glue on the skull, for a pleasant wake
People moaning 'cus of autopsy mistake
"As I'm put down the mouldy earth I await my final rebirth"

Coffin begins to crack
Rising up from black
On impulse from beyond
To hunger I respond

Beware of the Lidless Coffin

Dead but walking, with a glued on head
Cannibal instinct, eat human with bread
Doctors and scientists try to pretend
That this is not humanities end

Braindead ugly freak
Inflicting mortal pain
Flesh it seeks
Craving your fuckin' brave

Beware of the Lidless Coffin
