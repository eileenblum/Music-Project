Grim chants of madness asail the Brooklyn sky
A case of batophobia, much to severe to defy
Death comes creeping
Death from beyond
Slaughtered husband, slaughtered wife
under investigation, this robbery of life
Moulding basement, strange brick wall
through the door, down you fall
into rifts unknown to mankind
Where the horror will rape your mind
Where the soul turns to dust and the rest of you decay
There's no turning back
Your brain is molested and death's closing in on you
Red Hook Horror!
Horror and cruelty still stuck in your brain
But no one believes you, they claim you're insane
The brick wall's intact but no doors in sight
Now you'll spend the rest of your life,
living in denial
