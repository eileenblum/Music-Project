Infected with a cold
Sore fuckin' throat, dripping nose
Hot as hell itself
Lying in bed
The sickness grows
Hallucinations
Coughing up acid, pus and blood
Angry stomach
When you shit it's a fuckin' flood

Out for a walk
Slow as a rock
Car moving near
Hit in the front, damages are severe

Heart stops pumping, you're assumed dead
In a black bag, your bed

Star of the funeral, your family gathers around
Crying, tears and sorrow as you're put underground
Suddenly your heart starts pumping, you're alive again
But sickness and symptoms remain...

Coughing in a..
Coughing in a..
Coughing in a..
Coughing in a Coffin...
