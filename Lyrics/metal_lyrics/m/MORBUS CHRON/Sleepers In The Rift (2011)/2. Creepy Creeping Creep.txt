The Creepy Creeping Creep
The cause of eternal sleep
Dressed in pus and human ears
The greatest horror in modern years
Leaving trails of rotten heads
Children hide within their beds
Tonight we declare a winner
And who'll be served for dinner

Mangled remains
Foul decay
The Creepy Creep Creeps
Children buffet
With fork and knife
It feeds off your wife
Infest and molest
Fuckin' Die!

Pet of Satan, Foe of God
Killing ways, very odd
The Creepy Creeping Creep, it creeps..
It cuts off a leg to use as bait
Stupid human, now on plate
Puke him up, mutilate

Creepy
Creeping
Creep
