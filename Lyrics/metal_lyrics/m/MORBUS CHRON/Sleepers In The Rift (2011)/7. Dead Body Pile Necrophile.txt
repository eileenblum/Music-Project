Twenty years of gathering
Hundred open graves
Friendship with the corpses
Pleasure slaves
Stack in a pile
Who'll be first?
Decaying virgin flesh
Fulfilling my thirst

Dead
Body Pile
Dead Body Pile Necrophile

Removing maggots from my stick
Legs will open, I will lick
Taste of pus and rotten death
Up and down 'til I'm out of breath

Dead body love
Fits like a glove
No more rejects
Moving on to the next

Dead
Body Pile
Dead Body Pile Necrophile
