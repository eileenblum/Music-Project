I embody the euphoric existence above the rift
You are the accepter of my gift

Take me to your dead
By my chanted tongue they'll be led
To place I'm from
To the big black hole
To the Interstellar space
Away from this imaginary place

Hymns to a Stiff
Astral Sleep
Buried Deep
Hymns to a Stiff

Arise..

Awoken body
emanating into molecular vacancy
