Sulfur is my anatomy
Mouldy is my appearance
Pulled between giants
Razed by the magma sea 

Alien my being be
Unspoken are my words
Inglorious my name shall linger
My form is incomplete

Fumes from the great Tvashtar grow an ardent silhouette, flowing to the sonority of the Jovian tongue
The place of the four hundred Volcanoes

In the shadow of another world, I illuminate
My innards are scarring like blades
I'm erased by my own mass
to suffer a billIOn years

Ignis luna
