Lying down on holy grounDs 
To break these earthly bounds
and divorce the entangling roots

Sleep.

A sequence of blissfull thoughts
In dreaMs I'm high to transcend the nefarious
and to pierce through the obfuscous 
I will reach the luminous 
and channel all that is numinous

So, elevaTed I leave
to navigate that which is beyond

Flow.

Mundus est non satis
