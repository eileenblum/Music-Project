Liberatur a radicibuS
I'm caught where shadows stream
An absence of presence
is tearing my anemic seams

Within your horizon confined
I'm on a path to my truest design
All I feeL is reVerence
Consume me... Fulfill me... SwAllow!

And Through dissolvment I was realised - A flawless amalgam
And through adoration I became perfect - As One with the hollow
