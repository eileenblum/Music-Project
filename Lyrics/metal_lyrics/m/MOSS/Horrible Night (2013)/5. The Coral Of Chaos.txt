In dreams I hear him calling out
From the restless slumber in these mindless towers
From a place within you can't explain
Visions I receive from outer plains

Cities made from stone not of this Earth
His throne submerged in this funeral birth
A madness no man can explain
Visions sent from outer plains

At the bottom of the ocean
He waits to be free
I feel his slimy fingers reach out for me
At the bottom of the ocean
Beneath it's very depths
His sleeping song is calling to my living death

In dreams I hear him calling out
From restless slumber in these mindless towers
A madness no man can explain
Visions I receive from outer plains

At the bottom of the ocean
He waits to be free
I feel his slimy fingers reach out for me
At the bottom of the ocean
Beneath it's very depths
His sleeping song is calling to my living death
