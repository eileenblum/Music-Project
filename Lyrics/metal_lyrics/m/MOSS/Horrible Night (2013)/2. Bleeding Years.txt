As I fade into the darkness
And I feel it's wings surround me
Realise my fate is tied to this inner weakness
That fills my veins with life

These bleeding years
These bleeding years

My mind pulls me into the chasm
And caught me within it's waiting claws
Revealing science in my mind that I once knew
The burning of my soul

These bleeding years
These bleeding years
