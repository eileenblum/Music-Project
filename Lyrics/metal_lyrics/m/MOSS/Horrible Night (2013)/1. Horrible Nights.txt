These nights seen darker than I've ever seen before
A blackened ship awaits 
To sail me onto lunar shores
The book of Eibon stares at me
Both it's eyes ablaze
These awful nights, horrible nights
They're driving me insane

Into the darkest caves and caverns deep I go
I look inside myself
My eyes they stare back to
The book of Eibon open wide
Calling out my name
These awful nights, horrible nights
I feel their fucking rain

I see through time, beyond
Worlds away
Bleeding eyes glimpse upon ultimate terror
