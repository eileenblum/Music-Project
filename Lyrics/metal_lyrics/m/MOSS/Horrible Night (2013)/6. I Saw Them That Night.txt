The snow is falling down
Upon this hallowed ground
Into the ancient circle
Where hooded cloaks surround
I tied you to a tree
In the centre of this place
Don't dare make a sound
We will leave no trace

With my ritual knife
I slice it down
No one hears your screams
The crimson now surrounds
Your body will survive
The punishment that's due
For you've committed crimes unnatural

The cup is passed around
We sup upon your blood
Us holy men
Enshrouded by our hoods
You look into my eyes
You know we are not fools
Welcome to the ritual
