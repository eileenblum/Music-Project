With the sound of a distant bell toll
She will call you down inside her hole
All her charms and things
Will hypnotise your eyes
You are hers forever
On this night

Explain to me why your mind is so evil?
I think perhaps you're possessed by the Devil
You've cast your spell of lies
There's nothing left to do
Within this cell you've made
I'm looking back at you

I'm looking back at you

A Wayfarer's Tale
More lost souls rise
From the depths of the sea
And surround me on the shore
"Gamble your soul for this chest of gold
Or dwell with us now or forever more"

Explain to me why your mind is so evil?
I think perhaps you're possessed by the Devil
You've cast your spell of lies
There's nothing left to do
Within this cell you've made
I'm looking back at you

I'm looking back at you

Evil woman tried to play your games on me
The web of deceit I cannot believe
Insanity forever plagues my mind
A disease from Satan's bride

Oh no!
