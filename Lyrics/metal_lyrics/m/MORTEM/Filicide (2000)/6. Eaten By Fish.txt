Last hopeless sigh
The lungs are filling with water
And child's head goes into depth
Just trembling circles
Run on the water
Cutting short screaming for help
Fish are mute witnesses
Swimming close by child
Mother brings up her child
He's four years old
And he loves his ma
Mother meets a young man
She wants get married him
But son wants nobody
Her love to this man
Is stronger then to her son
She's got two ways
This man or her child
Mother meets a young man
She wants get married him
But son wants nobody
The young man said to her:
"If you didn't have your baby
It would be possible"
They used to like to walk
To pond in forest
That day they went
Like usually they did
Nobody was near at hand
She pushed her son
To the bottom of the pond
"We're finally alone"
She'll say it to young man
