Reek of decay
Stands in the room what you see
You are out of breath from this smell
Mortuary. Bodies of children
That have died are swollen
With pus from the time
The unidentifyed kids, victims of crimes
Still-born infants, backward children
Killed out ugly are thrown about in the heap
Some corpses are in the complete stage
Of decay. Streams of the yellow pus
Flow from the burst skin
I must burn down all bodies of the kids
Cast them by turns into the cremator
Furnace full of fire absorbs their bodies
I watch through the stout glass
Their necrosed muscle tissue
Begins to carbonize
Ttansparent blisters
Filled with yellow liquid
Appear on the dead skin
Burns cover the children's bodies
Rotting tissue melts, drops into the fire
Opened bellies expose the guts
Reek of decay
Stands in the room what you see
You are out of breath from this smell
Every day I do my job in this morgue
The death became a common thing
I've got used to the smell of burned skin
Last remains are burning down
Rake out from cremator ashes and dust
All is over
