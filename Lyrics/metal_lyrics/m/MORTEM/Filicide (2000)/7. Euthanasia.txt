They live in the hospital
They haven't got their parents
They were refused
Evident signs of ugliness
Faces look the same
Weak signs of mind
They live at the hospital expense
People need the medicines
Treat for the illnesses
They use the weak-minded
Children like laboratory mice
Nobody won't know anything
Where does new medicine get from
Who was tasted by it
