Rotten stench as I look at the corpse
Ferment limbs expose the bones
Lies in the pit of rubbish and trash
Here he found his own death
Blackened gore in the screaming mouth
Maggots make in cadaver their houses
Open stomach full of rotting guts
Legs and arms tumefy from the pus
Decomposing, putrid corpse
Pungent stink, bloody limbs
Swollen flesh, mouldy guts
His open eyes look to the sky
Blackened heart under brocken ribs
Wormy flesh gives vile reek
I vomit on his mangled face
I vomit on his mangled rotten face
Ptomaine's oozing from his eyees
Maggots crawl through his skull
Rats are eating his eyeballs
I can't stand it any more
Decomposing cadaver
Rotten stench as I look at the corpse
Ferment limbs expose the bones
Lies in the pit of rubbish and trash
Here he found his own death
Decomposing, putrid corpse
Pungent stink, bloody limbs
Swollen flesh, mouldy guts
