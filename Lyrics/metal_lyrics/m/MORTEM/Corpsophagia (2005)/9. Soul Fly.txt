And the soul is flying up to the sky
For the death has taken a life
Across the universe the soul has that flight
The stars go by
Space compresses in time
Feel the end of flight
The soul has god's favour
That's why it comes to heaven
That soul will stay in heaven till the end of time
The happiness and the bliss for eternity
The soul of yours is blacked from the sins you've done
You'll get in hell where fire burns for eternity
You didn't think about the future
About the life after death
