Darkness stands before my eyes
Silence is in my ears
I can't see, I can't hear
What's up? What's going on?
Where am I? where's everybody?
Ami dead, can it be true?
Reach out my hands straight in black
Have a sensation of coffin's lid
I can't see, I can't hear
Possibly I'm buried alive
Try to cry but it's useless
I'm not dead, I'm still alive
It should be kidding
It can't be true
I'm alive I understand
Keep on crying, beat and kick
Why it's happening to me
Dig me up from the grave
I can't breathe, suffocate
