A few days after death
The body's swollen
Dark blue and green color of the skin
Your smell, your smell magnetize me
Touch you, touch you
I wanna feel your body
After I enjoyed of seeing your body
I take my knife and cut your flesh to pieces
Your smell, your smell magnetize me
Touch you, touch you
I wanna feel your body
Before I can eat it
Feeding of the rotting human meat I like it
Gushing yellow liquid from your cut stomach
Gashing your necrosed skin
Drinking the yellow pus
Sucking the rest of blood in your veins
Tearing your lives apart
It's oozing from my mouth
Feeling of hungry takes over me
Your stinking gutted corpse
Possessed my mind
Smack of dead body
It means all for me
Corpsophagia
