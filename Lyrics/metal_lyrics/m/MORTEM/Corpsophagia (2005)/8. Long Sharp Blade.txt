Be prepared to be my victim
Nothing stops you from the bleeding
Always keep my knife in shealth
It was made by my order
Long sharp blade
You will die; I'll be your killer
Hold in my hand tool of killing
Choosed by chance, nothing personal
I've got you in my sight
You can scream nobody hears
I don't care about you tears
I raise my knife above your head
Long sharp blade
