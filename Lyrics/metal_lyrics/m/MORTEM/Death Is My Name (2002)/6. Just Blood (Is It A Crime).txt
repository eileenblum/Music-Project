Sharp blade is cutting your throat
Blood is splashing aside
Crack of bones
Torn muscles
Heart stops pumping
Dissection of your chest
Carving up your body
That is my hobby
Studying of internal organs
Surgery
Illegally
Satisfaction of my desire
Just blood gives me full happiness
Cut through your veins
Inside your body
I like this all
Amputation and dissection
All of your don't understand me
Thinking that is kind of crime
Just blood stops me from condition
That I feel without this action
