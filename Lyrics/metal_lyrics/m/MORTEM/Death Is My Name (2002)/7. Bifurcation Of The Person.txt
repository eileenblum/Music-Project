Lately two men live inside of me
The former lives his common life
The latter appears sometimes
And pushes me to the crimes
When second is awoke
He makes me take a knife
And drives me in the street to hunt
I go, he's inside together in the dark
And kill, and kill, and kill, and kill
I don't want to listen to him
But he's strongly than me
He comes when he wishes
And he's away after killing
He kills with incredible cruelty
I wonder what he is after
Victim goes, we mug
Knife cuts your throat
Your scream from pain stops suddenly
I stab the knife again, again
