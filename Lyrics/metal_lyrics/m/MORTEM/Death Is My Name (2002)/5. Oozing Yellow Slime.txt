The rotting corpse is lying on the table
The morgue is filled of putrid reek
Time exerted its influence
Blackened meat falls off from the bones
Hollow eyeballs
Screaming skull
Some weeks ago it was a person
With his destiny, with his minds
Death caught him by its claws
And decided to show power of itself
Oozing yellow slime
Rotten guts
Death laughs at your body
With merciless smile
Viscid pus smells vile
Maggots eat your flesh
