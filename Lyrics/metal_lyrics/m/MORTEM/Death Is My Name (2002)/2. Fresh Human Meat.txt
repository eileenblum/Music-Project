My stomach begins to salivate
When I see appetizing tidbits
Poured with aromatic gravy
Sprinkled with green vegetables
Just one day back
It was a young girl
I have got her here
Then I cut her flesh in pieces
I hung her up and cut her throat
Then I waited while all blood drops down
I sliced her flesh in little pieces
Then I separated bones from meat
I threw out her stinky guts
I gave her bones to my hungry big dogs
Part of meat I laid aside
In order to prepare the roast meat
And the rest I laid in the frig
I love to cook fresh human's meat
