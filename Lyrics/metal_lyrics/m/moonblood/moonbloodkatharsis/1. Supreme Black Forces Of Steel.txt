Roaming through the aeons back 
Through thousands of years forgotten 
Steel hand ruled with cruelly hands 
Let back only bones to rot 

Forget in flames by a mortals hand 
The magic power revealed 
Mortals recognized the supreme black force 
Created war for oppression and to kill 

They fell the might of the new element 
Strong arm for the law 
New weapons were created by warriors brains 
For the enemies to gore 

A new strange lust conquered their minds 
Lust for might and lust to kill 
The spirit of war awoke the greed 
For the blood to spill 

Gods were created by weak-minded mortals 
As excuse to dray the atrocities 
Only a horde of blood-hurdling fighters 
Believed in the supreme black forces of steel 

Bloody axes and red coloured blades 
Because of blood lust they are guilty 
But they always refused their beliefs oppression 
Fighting on for their glory
