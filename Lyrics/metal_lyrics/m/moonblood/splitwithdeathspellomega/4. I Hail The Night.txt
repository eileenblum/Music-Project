I see the dark clouds
Which are ruling this night of doom
Roaming slowly through the dark

And I see the birds of night
Their cries are painful
Their wings are beautiful black and large

And I see the moon with its cold eyes
And I see the stars in their pride
And I send my hails out into the darkness
Send my hails to the night

And a lustful feeling satisfies my soul
Dark thoughts roaming through my mind
Thoughts of destruction, thoughts of perversion
Can never the answer find

The light is my enemy
In lustful ecstasy
I hail the other side
I hail the night

And my ways goes through the forest of lost souls
Through the forest of nocturnal hate
And I lost my soul in these diabolical areas
And the path is darkened by a shade

I never want to reach the Heaven
Never want to serve the side of light
My life was dedicated to the power of the moon
And my thoughts are filled with the unholy might

I've reached my goal, found my place
Here I wanna die
Among these trees should be my grave
Here I wanny lie
