Eyes of infernal beauty stare
Deep from ancient forests nocturnal
Behind the shadows of your fear they lurk
Dwelling under a spell eternal

Bony claws stretches it out of the mist
Begging for their salvation
Imprisoned to dwell under a forgotten spell
In the realm of evil's adoration

Necromancers united aeons ago
Their magic powers to enchant the place
This forest was possessed by the night's spell
For all times and for every race

And every mortal who stepped at this soil
Was catched by forces infernal
To end his life in eternity
In forgotten spells in forests nocturnal

I feel the looks from their hidden places
The crueltiest pain I felt ever
I know that the night's spell imprisoned me
And I will rest here forever
