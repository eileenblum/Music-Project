Through the night, through the darkness
Through the forests, through the fields
Through the mountains, through the rivers
Through the coldness of the northwind
Under the cold fullmoon

Fullmoon, cold and merciless
Take my soul

Through the airs on black wings
Through the stars I glide
Under the forests, the mountains
I pass all and glide away
Under the cold fullmoon

Fullmoon, cold and merciless
Take my soul

Pass palaces, pass castles
I glide on my black wings
Through the night, through the darkness
Through the coldness of the northwind
Under the cold fullmoon
