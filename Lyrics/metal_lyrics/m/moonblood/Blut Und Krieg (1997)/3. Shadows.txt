Darkness everywhere, silence everywhere
Trees stand like giants in front of me
A weak wind blows through my hair
Like a ghost wich is going through your body
The shrubs sing the song of fear
The grass sways it with the wind
Shadows

The huge trees with magnificent crowns
Don't let the moon shine down to me
Every step goes into uncertainty
Every look catchs it
Shadows

Hasty it flits through the night
Glowing eyes stare at me
The shrubs sing on the song of fear
My journey through the nightly woods goes on
Everything turns around me
Everywhere are shadows
The branches snap on going
Everywhere are glowing eyes
Everywhere are shadows
Are it the children of the night
They accompany me
Flits past in the trees 
As shadows
