When the day is an eternal night
And the fullmoonshine the only light
When firestorms attacks the earth
It's a sign for evil's rebirth
And when the sky turns it bloodred
And flames the houses of christ burn
Then the time has come
And our infernal master returns


Thanks to jussimikkonen for sending tracks #5, #9 lyrics.
