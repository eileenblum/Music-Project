The moon goes its way in the northern sky
Anxious it circles over the horizon
Frost-pregnant winds push it
In front of themselves
The night has thrown it's veil over the land
Birds are filling fast te dark sky
Their huge dark wings wide stretched
Gliding silently through the night
The snow falls slightly and peacefully
Evaporates when it's touching my skin
I see a light whizzing fast the sky
A shooting star
My black heart beats faster
Out of pleasure, out of fear
I don't know
The weapons died away
Flames beat high into the sky
Fog comes down
The field saturated with blood
With the blood of our enemies
Hail - To you, it was a good battle
Hail to our enemies
Bloodsmeared blades
Smashed armours everywhere
The death was riding with us
Side by side we have fought
The Power of darkness were with us
...And snow covered the lifeless bodies
