Knights full of fear, knights full of hate
Endless long it appear me
Dream tyrannile my sleep
Dreams about death
Dreams about power
For everybody it is open
The gate to the kingdom of forgotten dreams
Everybody can enter it
At night, when your body falls in sleep
Is it the best time
Slowly the things begin to turn around you
What once was is again to get over
What still comes... You can see it
Demos take possession of you
Inyour dreams
They try to take you on the other side
Dreams which are long forgotten
Live again in you
Scatter your thoughts, torment you
The demon of dreams torments you
The gate wide opened
He stretched out his claws
After new victims it grip
When they dream
He'll find them in their dreams
And don't let them again awake
And endless they'll sleep
Endless they dream
Imprisoned
In the kingdom of forgotten dreams
Imprisoned in the hell of eternity
