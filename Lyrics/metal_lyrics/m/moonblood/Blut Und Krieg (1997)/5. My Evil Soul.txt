Blackness Surrounds Me 
With The Eyes Of Dead It Stares At Me 
Its Dark Claws Reach For Me 
My Body Struggles Against 
But My Evil Soul Will Go With It 
But I Am Still Strong Enough 
To Hold It 
My Mind Is Strong 
A Northern Breeze Breathes At Me 
With Its Icy Wings 
It Want To Kidnap Me 
But My Body Fights Against It 
Only My Dark Soul Wants To Go With It 
On A Journey Through Shady Countries 
An All - Devouring Fire Surrounds Me 
Its Flames Want To Embrace Me 
But My Body Objects 
Only My Dark Soul Is Prepared 
To Unite With The Eternal Fire 
Demons Come And Flatter Me 
They Want To Take Me 
Into The Empire Of The Eternal Darkness 
With Sweet Words They Try To Persuade Me 
My Mind And My Body Don't Want To Permit 
But My Evil Soul Wants To Go With Them 
It Has Become Stronger Than Before 
Slowly It Escapes From My Body 
Slowly The Life Fades Away With It 
Fades Away From My Body 
It Goes On A Journey 
Through Shady Countries 
Into The Empire Of The Eternal Darkness
