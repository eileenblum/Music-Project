The fullmoon shines over the cemetery
The wind roams slightly through the trees
A smell of rottenness lies in the air
Knocked over crucifixes, ransacked graves
Besmeared with blood

In a bloody night of fullmoon
I was born
In sin I want to live
Under the freezing moon

Dead bodies under the fullmoon
On their chests... Carved pentagrams
The Antichrist was born
His destiny is the fight against jesus christ
And his fucking god

In a bloody night of fullmoon
I was born
In sin I want to live
Under the freezing moon
