A dark deep night
Walking by the hills and the plains
Under the goatmoon
Above the eternal glowing stars
Hearing the voices below
From a world beyond the consciousness
Feeling the strength of nature
The power of unearthly forces
Touching the caress of snow on my skin
Feel the freezing winds from North
Covering my bodiless soul
Searching for my pain
In my open wounds
Longing for a sign
The wolf is coming
Within my flesh and blood
Away... far away
Hear the weak helping screams of Christians
Suffering and praising for death
