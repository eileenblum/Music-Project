Bloodless moon tonight forsakes the dead's last rest
Scattered by frozen death winds
Are the bones of all who died without remembrance
Died alone their own special way
To pay their sins and god's betrayal
Heretic souls, forgotten and banished
Dwelling in eternal punishment
And rest in the dark on unblessed soil
Can never again hold the torches of life
And will never reach the eternity's fire
Which they are longing for so many aeons
Blind are god's eyes and falseness hides behind his face
Not able to forgive past sins, but praises himself as your lord
Wings unfold in the crimson dusk
During thunder defeats darkness silence
Storm is coming from the mountain side
Came to pray for the dead's last will
And louder than the loudest thunder their chants resound
That all blood freezes by their sad melodies
And mist rises up and all coffins burst
Creeping shades arise with the angel's lament
Panic is ruling, but it's too late to escape
As bony fingers grip for white silk and ripping their sweet bloody skin
Coming through the soil with the shadows, creeping evil
They arise from graves, legions of the dead
To wreck all what is of God
Holding high the weapons they were buried with
Swords and axes, armors of steel
Iron blades cut the angel's flesh
Screams of torment calling loud
But suffocate shortly after
And all voices grow silent
As blades cut through their throats
Blood and death, the dead's only war chant, conquers the grey mist
Under moonlight, white and cold they die
Suffocate on own holy blood
And merciless slayers stalking through the darkness
