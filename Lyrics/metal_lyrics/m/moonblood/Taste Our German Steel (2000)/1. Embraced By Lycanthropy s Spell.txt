What happens to me when the moon shines
Which morbid longing is tormenting me
That greed for blood, so fresh and still warm
That lust to creep through the nocturnal forest
Hunting to satisfy my mysterious greed
Ah... that pain
I can't stand it anymore
I must go out: in the night
Cold winds whip my naked skin
When I enter the freezing darkness
But the hunger forces me out
Out in the streets, I take in the scent
Bloodlust under frozen skies
My teeth want to rip the victim's flesh
And my tongue wants to taste the juice of life
Ah... what a great feeling!
The odor of death is for what I'm living for
My nocturnal howling under the grey moon
Forces of unnatural silence over the night
Embraced by lycanthropy's spell:
The eyes of my victim are still opened
Distorted because of the horror they saw in the end
There is no mercy in my wolf heart
Only that magic, which forces me out at night
