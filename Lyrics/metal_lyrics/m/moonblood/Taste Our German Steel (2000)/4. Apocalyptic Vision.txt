Enter the enchanted forest
During your journey every night
A freezing wind accompanies you
Let the veil of night spirits cover you
Let them protect you
You, who is creature between man and animal,
Procreated through the sperm of Astaroth
In a night which people call unholy
In a night of the demonic spirits
Day for day you saw that illusions
And it was horrifying, cause you couldn't explain it
Today such a night opens its arms to embrace you
And you know your destiny and the reason of your existence
Your birth was cursed by holy mouths
And your existence is blasphemy in the eyes of Jehovah
But the dark necromancers enjoy your occult magic flair
Your body and your mind were prepared for this night
Under the right constellation of the planets
You will await thy supreme overlord
So step on, nearer to the light of the flames inside the shadow
Five grandmasters of witchery will await you
Inside the magic pentagram you must wait
On every edge they stand and greedy eyes observe you
Blood runs from their arms to the middle
And flames blazing high by the touch
Your mouth is calling magically the words of his arrival
And during the planets building a line
And the flames burning the blood of witchery
Thy lord rises up under a bearing thunder sky
His eyes are red blazing flames
The hoofs step on the earthly soil
And his breath burns all
He's coming to you to perform the demonic wedding
Your father will be the father of your spawn
The necromancers died, cause all blood run away
During the planets building its occult constellation
The enemy has been procreated, called the antichrist
Astaroth left this universe, back to his abyss
And inside your body the archenemy will grow
There are only a few years under the reign of the light's race
When his eyes see the light, the Christ will fall...
