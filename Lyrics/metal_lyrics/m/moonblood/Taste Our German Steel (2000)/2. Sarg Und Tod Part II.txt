[Written by Carlos Arturo Zapata]

The fight, of night
War between death and lust
The right, of might
Possesses the skull's key-rules
The sign, is mine
Take the knife, hold it high
The lord, of death (invocate my name)
A torturous yell (blasphemate with deep hate)
Open your soul, your throat, your veins
Look how the blood is going away
And don't ask yourself a why
It must be the path to end all life
Then throw away the knife
Kill yourself with hateful fire
With abhorrence be o' mine
I am the end of all
My name is death, I won!
I killed the arts of dusk woerot
Profaner of eternal sadness
I rejected the existence of the moon
Ruler of the abysmal darkness
Conqueror, emperor of maggots
I suck the dead men's black blood
I am the end of all, the rotting
And when you die, you will be nothing
Dead forever, no arise
Impurity, no chaos
Unholy dark demise
