[Written by Carlos Arturo Zapata]

And the dark lord found a place
Ont he fields where none have returned
Where all the twisted gods lie...
There, where its obeisance feel in the oblivion
Like our tears of pain wrath stricken on this path
There, burning bleed my unholy war death
Screaming ancient incantations...

And when the obloquy defiles
Thy obnoxious souls
Its evil omen will be
Dungeon and sore
Perhaps very soon
The gloominess shall draggle itself death
Throughout those endless weepings
Into the shades
To wield the deepest scepter
Prone upon woerot...
Thy dark doom, black evil and death
For woerot only
Hail Death!
Ave Dusk Woerot!!

As I snear my dark blood
Upon the wirdsword
Throughout the gates
Into the immortality tortured moon
Thus the faithnized victims
Of the lair of suffering
Those who have imprisoned
Their infernal torment
By their own demise

They will must inflict this doomed shrine
Entangled in my sores
And when all my screams
Turn unheard to the death
Maybe your blasphemy falls slowly
On woerot's scepter
Buried inside the most dismal coffin
Where the existence crawls its throe
Under thorns, to lament this condemn
Warriors of pain and darkness
Hail Death
Ave Dusk Woerot!!!
