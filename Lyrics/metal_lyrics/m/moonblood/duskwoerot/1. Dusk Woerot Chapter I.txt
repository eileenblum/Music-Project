[Written by Carlos Arturo Zapata]

On the sacrilegious and tortuous
Dungeon of rustiness
From these forgotten fields
The withering and ailing essence
Called woerot
Bawls a shrink of pain
With a shudder of disgust

"Alas, I have crawled my hate suffering
Under the hellish shadows of thorny paths
Where my gloomy tears of blood
Fall being beckoned towards the abyss"

The dilapidation and mourning of woerot
Shall engender upon your souls
A black yell of torment
We must listen to him writhe
And bewail of sorrow rage

"My dismal chant to disavow the lightness
Is groaning a perpetual requiem
While my illumined falldown in this world
Turns infuriating and unverable
Without my ancient dwelling, my coffin"

And forever woerot cries:

"If my distress and ruthlessness
Are a real sore and eternal blasphemy done
Poem
Hail Death!
Ave Dusk Woerot!!!"
