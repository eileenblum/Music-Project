[Written by Carlos Arturo Zapata]

Torture the flesh with spines
Upon the rack
Then vehemently vanquish the existence
Under a dark coffin
And from the miasmatical impurity
The cursed-burnt offering
Shall suppurate a filthy stench of pain

Thou art woerot, what dwells within
Wrath forever, defaced and flaming
Ghastly foetus entangled on me
Doomed and evilers on the
Insanity's domain
Hail Death
Ave Dusk Woerot!!

Grovel into the entrails
Of the regrettable havor
Woerot the unholy woe has been prone
Under the coldest, dilapidated coffin
To celebrate the gloomiest funeral wooing
Ancient ceremony darkened
By the stink of exhumation
And beyond the epitaph an obsequies
Turn chant and rite
Below death and bereavement of flesh
Where the emaciated souls
Eternally dwell in dreariness
Because that woe shall always
Be mourning and shade
When thy falling comes:
Ave Dusk Woerot!

And when those devious paths
May ensanguine thy flagitious existence
Thou shall exhume the egregious funeral
As the ingrowing pain would be
Inflicted upon us
Where the inequity has crawled
It's almost ghoul
And where we suffer, perpetually
Ourselves scars...
Thus the mournful soul tears the furtive sob
When lightness lacerates its kibosh
And your rabies and your chaos want torture
The tragedian war poem
The shadow fields of bitterly unheard
Hail Death
Ave Dusk Woerot!
