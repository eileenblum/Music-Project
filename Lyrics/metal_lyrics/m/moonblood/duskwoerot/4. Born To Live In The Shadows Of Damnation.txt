A veil of everlasting darkness
Is ruling this unholy night
The moon stand in full clothes on the
Dark colored sky
And the stars are shining bright
Flames on horizon light up the blackness
Flames of the christ-crushing war
I see the tears in the eyes of the moon
I see the cold-eyed stars
I see the silhouettes of forgotten ages
Passing slowly beside me on
I see the pain of the innocent
Which was done by fanatic Jesus sons
I feel the power inside of me
Power from a higher side
I see the frozen blood on the soil
I feel the forgotten pride
And loneliness is my destiny
And to rule the dark colored sky
