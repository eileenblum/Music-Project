You come to me in darkness, you come to me at night
A vile bringer of self destructive thoughts and decline
You walk me down the hallways, always at my side
You've shattered all my sanity and cursed my life

You come to me in darkness, you come to me at night
You brought me to my knees an overthrew my life
I fell under your devilry, I fell before your eyes
I fell under this lunacy you all named life
