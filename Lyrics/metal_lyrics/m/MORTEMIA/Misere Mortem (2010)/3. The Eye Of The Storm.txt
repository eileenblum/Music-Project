In days and in nights
In darkness and light
I stand by your side
When summer declines
And winter arrives
I'll still stand my ground
I stand by your side
With my head held high
Through the flood and the fire
Never to descend
Never to give in
Tireless as the northern winds

The demons within
Strong in their will
But I'll never give in
The claw at my heart
They'll tear it apart
If I just falter once

I stand here with pride
Right by your side
Through the flood and the fire
Never to descend
Never to give in
Tireless as the northern winds

I stand before the fall
Here in the eye of the storm
In the eye of the storm

In the eye of the storm
I stand before the fall
In the eye of the storm
I can hear them call
In the eye of the storm
I can feel their claws
In the eye of the storm
I fall once and for all
