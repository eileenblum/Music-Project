My inner demons got me chained to the ground
I search in vain but there's no key to be found
Drag me down, keep me down to the ground you scornful demons
Drag me down, further down to the sound of the chains that wield my mind

My inner demons have slain my sanity
I'm trapped between the devil and the deep blue sea
Drag me down, keep me down to the ground you scornful demons
Drag me down, further down to the sound of the chains that wield my mind
