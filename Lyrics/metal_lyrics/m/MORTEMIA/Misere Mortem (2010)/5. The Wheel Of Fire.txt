The wheel of fire burns eternally
In my sanctum, my land of dreams
The flames grow higher with every dream
Way more horrid with every tear

The wheel of fire has marked my skin
Marked my soul, scarred me within
I falter on dream by dream
Suffer along tear by tear

Fire...
The wheel of fire burns on and on
Fire...
Marked and scarred forevermore
