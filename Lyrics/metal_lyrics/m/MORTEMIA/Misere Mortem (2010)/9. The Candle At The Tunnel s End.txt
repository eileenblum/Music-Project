The daylight has forsaken me
and darkness keeps on breaking me down
All these years of agony
eventually got to my mind
Feelings of despair prevail
my anguish and my fear drive me insane
Conquering my mind this time
Nail me to the ground and keep me down forever
Forever and ever

Anxiety breeds withing
as moral sin is choking my life
The candle at the tunnel's end
now seems to have burned all the way down
Conquering my mind this time
Nail me to the ground and keep my down forever
Forever and ever
