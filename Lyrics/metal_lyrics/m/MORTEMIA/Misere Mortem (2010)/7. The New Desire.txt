This condemnation ravages all the sanity in me
This flagellation you all brought upon me
You come with fire, with stakes and your torches burning
A new desire, a flaming prophecy

This convocation, a vile and dark conspiracy
An oppression of all which is free
A new desire, a destined path for you and for me
and all others who once were free

A waning desire, all hope led astray
Now darkness consumes the day
A sign and a token, a wisdom unspoken
gives fuel to the flames
