I see you stand in the rain of a darkened day
And denial won't ease your pain
I see you falter through doors you've passed through before
As your memories all fade away

I see you stand in a blaze of infernal pain
In denial and on the wane
I see you falter through endless corridors
An illusion and a world led astray

I know you heart has grown so dark,
Torn all apart by the malice of life's cruel ways
I know your soul has grown so cold,
So frail and old, far too weary to face the day

I see you fall, see you crawl,
See you face the wall that keeps the world away
I hear you cry, see you strive,
see you mourn your life in arms of an unborn day
