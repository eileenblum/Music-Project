Decease of common sense, I am a scapegoat for your guilt
To prove your innocence, you put the squeeze on at full tilt

Uncontrolled massacred minds - Negligent
Travesty, circus sublime - Decadent

Twisting and turning reality
Truth is a stranger in your fantasy

Loss of glory - No horizon, compact tragic grey
Mandatory - You are on a mental holiday

No justice to be found
I'm falling to the ground
Floods of corruption
Onslaught, oppresion

You're feeding me with misery, a pocket full of lies
You give me hell, and might as well, take away my life

Suffacation - Devastating vacuum paralyse
Obligation - To stare into a wall of endless lies

Your guile upon me pound
I'm crawling on the ground
Floods of corruption
Onslaught, oppresion

Uncontrolled massacred minds - Negligent
Travesty, circus sublime - Decadent

Nothing is right, something is wrong
Can't see the light, do I belong

Crucifixion - Driving nails into my withering flesh
In submission - Behold remorseless bigwig manifest

I hope you're feeling good
A reverse Robin Hood
Floods of corruption
Onslaught, oppression

No evasion - Freedom is expensive merchandise
Allegation - Indigent, born to be sacrificed
