Human beings - The cancer of the universe
With greed for power - Bringing us the final curse
A society - Built upon fear and lies
Suicidal - Creating our own demise

It's all too late
We've sealed our fate

In the morning without warning
Funeral bells will chime
Missiles flying, earth is dying
It's the end of time

Nuclear Wardance

Eternal death - Mass cremation of our race
Falling sun - The last one of the human days
No prayer - Can save us from this certainty
Armageddon - It's time to face reality

Black hand of doom, wipes out our lives
The earth a giant tomb, the last sacrifice

Mad regimes - Using all their biggest tools
No escape - When radiation terror rules
Insanity - Is boiling in their twisted minds
Brutality - Assassination of mankind

It's all too late
We've sealed our fate

In the morning without warning
Funeral bells will chime
Missiles flying, earth is dying
It's the end of time

Nuclear Wardance
