Army trained freak going berserk
Killer without cause, dead bodies on the street
Massive mental breakdown, there's no place to hide
Awakening of the sleeping dragon deep inside
Just another slayer, random victims fell
Now they are in heaven, we are still in hell
Killing evil hate...

Avengers on the prowl with automatic fire
Slaughter in cold blood, senseless multicide
Horrid wrath ignition exploding in your face
Uncontrolled aggression which leaves a bloody trace
Just another slayer, random victims fell
Now they are in heaven, we are still in hell
Killing evil hate...

Blood, hate, death
Life, love, lost
Nothing is sacred for the mad

No bounds for atrocities
No repentance, no regrets
No emotions in dead souls
No compassion, just contempt

Mesmerized by violence, distorted evil minds
Nobody is safe, fury strikes blind
Facing a machine gun, see the empty eyes
No, there is no reason, but now you're gonna die
Just another slayer, random victims fell
Now they are in heaven, we are still in hell
Killing evil hate...
