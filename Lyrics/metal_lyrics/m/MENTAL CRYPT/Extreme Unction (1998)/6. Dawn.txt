As autumn grasp my sense, reflection fills my mind
Faded in the past, forgotten memories grind

Hidden feeling died, never to be shown
Discovering the lies, consciousness have grown

Acceptance will defeat, resentfulness retreat
Buried wishes rise, uncover the disguise

Black turns into white
The pendulum of life
Heedless you lied, black tears I cried
The tide has turned, unscarred, unburned
Regained control, I'm set to roll
No time to mourn, a new day is born

Immunity to pain
Laughing in the rain
Say good-bye to moan
And face a glorious dawn

In consequence of this, betrayal with a kiss
Flamboyance have died, swallow the unpride

Black turns into white
The pendulum of life
Heedless you lied, black tears I cried
The tide has turned, unscarred, unburned
Regained control, I'm set to roll
No time to mourn, a new day is born

Immunity to pain
Laughing in the rain
Say goodbye to moan
And face a glorious dawn
