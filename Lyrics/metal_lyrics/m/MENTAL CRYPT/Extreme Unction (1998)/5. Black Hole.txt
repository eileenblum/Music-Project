Agony my only friend, rapes my twisted mind
I am under siege of nightmare, creeping from behind
In blind frustration, scream out the hate
Frantic convulsion, I'm chained by fate

What's the reason to be born
When your soul is ripped and torn

Feeling claustrophobic apathetic paranoid
Depressive pestilent existence living in a void
I have lost control, this is a black hole

Unyielding force of emptiness, mindless perished time
Suicidal fantasies, to me it ain't no crime
Manic obsession, caught in a trap
This is a dead end, a cul-de-sac

What's the reason to be born
When your soul is ripped and torn

My life is fading away
Born to decay
There's no reason to stay

Nothing matters to me now, no hope of a cure
Extinction of a wasted life, my vanity is pure
A weird repulsion against this lie
Ultimate solution, I want to die

What's the reason to be born
When your soul is ripped and torn

Feeling claustrophobic apathetic paranoid
Depressive pestilent existence living in a void
I have lost control, this is a black hole

Wipe out vanity
Poisoned sanity be gone
