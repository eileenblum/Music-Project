It's just a test in the deep, in an area where life is cheap
What's your problem, can't you see, so far away it can't kill me
Show no respect and ignore massive protests from the poor
Just pretend we never heard condemnations from the world

Stand my ground, ironbound
Feel the hate, radiate
Let's have another one, you know, forget the Little boy
At the atoll down below we blow another toy

It's time to oppress, blasting in progress

Look at me, a hero indiscreet
Can't you see, I am a bombfreak

Underground nuclear bombs
Death ray cursed catacombs

Don't interfere in things you don't know, we continue our power show
And if genetic freaks increase, it's just the price to secure peace
Politics is just a job, pay no attention to the mob
I shall overcome your will, and demonstrate my overkill

Stand my ground, ironbound
Feel the hate, radiate
Let's have another one, you know, forget the Little boy
At the atoll down below we blow another toy

Ignorance crush all sense
Lacerate, detonate
Let's have another one, you know, forget the Little boy
At the atoll down below we blow another toy

Deaf, dumb, blind, man behave
So we dig our own grave
Megalomaniac
