Battle cries, smoke arise
Change the color of the skies
Say good-bye, time to die
Never know the reason why
Cannons roar, total war
This is what we?re living for
Victims yell, burning hell
No one here will live to tell

Only hypocrites deny
Warzone madness justify
Violation of the human rights
Million die in endless fights
Warzone

Panic sheer, mortal fear
Got no time to shed a tear
Death is near, no more beer
All of us are dying here
Crawl in mud, see the blood
Can?t believe there is a god
Take the shit, this is it
Left to rot up in a pit

Only hypocrites deny
Warzone madness justify
Violation of the human rights
Million die in endless fights
Warzone

Listen to my warning
Have you all gone blind
Satan's hammer falling
Destruction of mankind

Warmonger won't hear your cries
Shooting missiles through the skies
There's no time to feel remorse
The world is flaming like a torch

Now we face evil ways
Suicide of the human race
It's to late, cannot wait
Play this fucking game of hate
Death arrive, can't survive
Wasn?t born to be alive
We are lost, pay the cost
End up in the holocaust

Only hypocrites deny
Warzone madness justify
Violation of the human rights
Million die in endless fights
Warzone
