Existence without life for me, I'm on a one way trip to madness
Suffering in misery, in a world of constant sadness
Perishing in agony, the breakdown of my senses
With chemical lobotomy, I ignore the consequences
Invincible reality, these pills will make my day
My eternal enemy, I'm sailing far away

I'm looking for some change in this life of pain
Miracles only appears in dreams insane
How can I live in the shadow of fear
Sick humanity drowning in a lake of tears

Psychosis, death wish tribulation
I dismiss suffering damnation
With chemical lobotomy
I kill this endless misery

One way ticket out of here, I'm sinking in the sea of sorrow
Into distant anywhere, in a world with no tomorrow
Captive in a ghoulish lair, the outbreak of disaster
Erase this shit, nobody cares, my weary soul burns faster
Invincible reality, this needle makes my day
My eternal enemy, I'm drifting far away

Lost the grip - World will stop turning
One way trip - Falling down, burning

Leave this fucking world so cold, I can't resist the voices calling
Six feet under in a hole, in a world forever falling
Eternity taking my soul, mechanical relayer
Fate lies in a crystal ball, a bullet, my betrayer
Invincible reality, this gun will make my day
My eternal enemy, it will blow me far away

Addicted to this fatal saviour
Agony will send me to my grave
No control of destiny
Consumed by drugs I meet the final day

Psychosis, death wish tribulation
I dismiss suffering damnation
With chemical lobotomy
I kill this endless misery
