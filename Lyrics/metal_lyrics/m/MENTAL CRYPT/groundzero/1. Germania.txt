As silence fuck your brain, the smoke slowly will fade
Where zombies had their way in the swastika parade
Your country lies in ruins, decaying bodies rot
Million after million, the death toll never stops

An almighty ruler, the chosen one
Creator of bloodshed, who has won
In advantage of surprise warfare, the wehrmacht on the rise
Blitzkrieg struck the unaware, the treaties were just lies

Systematic brainwash spreading the disease
Order through terror, as lunacy increase
You?ll never find a shelter, the blood hounds never rest
The stormtroopers of death are craving your arrest

An almighty ruler, the chosen one
Creator of bloodshed, who has won
The troops were marching to their doom, not knowing of the cold
But winter fell upon them soon and none were getting old

Mass hypnosis, blind they fall
Propaganda mind control
Lashed delirium multiplies
Worship lunacy and die

Grim totalitarian with intent to erase
Dissidents and unfits, cleansing of the race
No mercy in hate, death accelerates
The war drags ever on, journey to oblivion
Tanks are rolling, armies fall in blood

A mind besieged by hatred, equipped with marionettes
Accommodating henchmen, in factories of death
The final solution for the eternal Jew
Annihilating death cramps, a mad cadaver zoo

An almighty ruler, the chosen one
Creator of bloodshed, who has won
Lebensraum at any cost, the troops were sacrificed
No surrender, all is lost, exterminated Reich

Mass hypnosis, blind they fall
Propaganda mind control
Lashed delirium multiplies
Worship lunacy and die

Massgrave without tombstone, countless corpses rot
Skeletons are ghostly victims of the plot
Blindfolded humanity, mankind's insanity
In the cramps, no doubt, there's only one way out
Through the chimney, vanish in the air
