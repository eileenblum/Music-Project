[lyrics: Maja Konarska]

Maybe you will finally understand me
Maybe you just need some more time to think
You cannot see me Iâm hiding too deep
But somehow you feel me under your skin

You trust in me even more than I do
Now I am aware
My time is up, my destination
Is running away
I choke on every word I utter
I canât stand
All those mistakes I keep on making
Every day

Youâre like a pill that relieves my suffering
And I can swallow you every day
Again I desire to keep my eyes wide open
Each time your light penetrates my spirit
