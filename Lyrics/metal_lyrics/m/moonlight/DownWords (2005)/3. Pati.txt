[lyrics: Maja Konarska]

And just as you desired
Here I am again
Too long have I been waiting
For this day
Tell me how it happened
âCause I donât know
And Iâm so different from them
Donât you know?
You interrupt my thinking
And your own
I understand a lot more
Than I want to
I have to spit it out
All this rage
Although you see it happen
You run away

I want to trust in my patience
Canât hear the words
No matter how I try
Looking upon my past experience
I want to trust in my patience once again

All you need is
A single word
Say it only
Once for me
I want to trust in
My patience again
