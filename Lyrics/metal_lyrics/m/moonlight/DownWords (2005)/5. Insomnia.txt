[lyrics: Maja Konarska]

Like every night, your mind wonât let you rest.
You want it. He doesnât. And time keeps running out.
Like your blood aging with heartbeat.
So you keep asking me how to deal with it.

Donât fight with time cause itâs running.
And run with it.

Itâs night again, your mind wonât let you rest.
You want it. He doesnât. And time keeps running out.
Just like your blood, aging with each heartbeat.
So you keep asking me how to deal with it.
