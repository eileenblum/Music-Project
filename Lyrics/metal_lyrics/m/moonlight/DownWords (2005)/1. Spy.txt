[lyrics: Maja Konarska]

Your breath is getting short
You feel the impulse
To turn around
You donât want to vanish
Uncontrollable sadness dominates your mood
You want to see it all with your own eyes
You donât want to vanish

Youâre so afraid
Scraping your hands with soap
Another seizure
Youâre afraid
To disappear

A million hands are touching you
A million eyes are watching
A million noses smelling you
A million ears are listening to you

You feel that someoneâs following you
The air seems sticky and thick like glue
Youâre swinging around in anxiety
Fearing you might disappear
Youâre afraid that someone will touch you
You canât believe this nightmare is true
Youâre experiencing a seizure
Fearing you might disappear

This black day has come again
Everythingâs a mess
All is dead in your head
No one will see a thing
When you disappear
You are feeling down

Sometimes it disappears
And life seems less austere
No need to turn around
Your life seems less austere
Youâre not afraid
