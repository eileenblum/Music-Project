[lyrics: Maja Konarska]

Letâs take a shortcut through the woods today
It may be dangerous but please take me there
When something happens to us for the second time
It doesnât frighten as much as the prime

And when somebody dies
Let him pass away
Your sorrow is needless
Please understand
You cannot sleep today
Donât you forget
Itâs best to hide a leaf
In the woods

You started dreaming but now itâs time to forget
And in the woods youâll find a gift someone will get
Even the slightest sound will lead you to a clue
All those incredible things, I will get them from you
