[lyrics: Maja Konarska]

Your destination is too far
Not so easy to rise
Youâre too feeble to get up
Closing your eyelids so tight

Another day has come
Stealing the light from your eyes
Still to weak to rise
(Itâs) just as if the world
Was blackening within your self
Youâre too blind too see

With every step and every word
So many answers are emerging
If you cannot understand them
Let me deal with everything
With every step and every word
Many answers
Think about it once again
