[lyrics: Maja Konarska]

For the first time your senses deceive you
All is deranged inside of your head
You cannot tell the lies from the real world
Your disease makes you feel so bad

You only hope youâre living a crazy dream
The slightest move is just too much for you
Paralyzed you begin to feel cold
All you hear is this unfamiliar noise

You refuse to understand
This isnât life, isnât death
The struggle with yourself
Is no longer possible

For the first time your senses deceive you
All is deranged inside of your head
You cannot tell the lies from the real world
You only hope youâre living a crazy dream
