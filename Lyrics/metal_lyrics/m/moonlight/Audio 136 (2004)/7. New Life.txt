You taught me how to see
And not to be afraid
Now you're gone and all I feel
Is the deadly nightshade
I couldn't believe when I heard
"It could be you"
Now I'm grateful for my good thoughts
I can feel her breathe

I never knew how close you were to the line
When she looked you looked away

Now you know she went away
You cannot tell which way
You can feel her somewhere near
You can feel her breathe

Today you seem so fine
A smile upon your face
So much faith in fresh, new life
A smile upon your face
The awful thought are gone...
Gone forever from your head
Never forget not to be afraid

Now you know she went away
You cannot tell which way
You can feel her somewhere near
You can feel her breathe

I will always feel her breathe
