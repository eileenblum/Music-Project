I can see you today
Even if you try to hide
I can see you again
And I know
I know so much

It's so sweet to control
Alas the sweetness can take it's toll

It is so easy to escape
The pain is easy to forget
Only he will be strong who can
Give a part of himself and be himself

Will
You ever dare
To look inside me
Will you take your chance
Or will you only glance
And go away
So do you think you could?
