This isn't real
I freeze my eyes
It's somewhat colder
The dream subsides
I don't care
What you want to say
You'll never stop
Craving what's gone

Don't look back
Don't turn around again
Another day for you
And sorrow in my tissue

Don't know who you were
Nor who you will become
You want my part of you
To disappear
Let me see
Your solitude
I want to seize
Your wounded pride

I don't care
What you want to say
I want to seize
Your wounded pride
I want to see
Your solitude
You'll never stop
Craving what's gone
