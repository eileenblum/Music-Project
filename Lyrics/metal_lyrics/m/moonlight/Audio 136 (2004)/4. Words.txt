I truly want to heal
All the thoughts in your head
I truly want to cure
Your soul that's poisoned
When you thought you could change everything
All you changed was yourself
Please listen to the words I'm trying to say
Heed this words before they vanish into thin air
You won't change the things that they had done

You desired much more than you could ever get
And kept asking "how much longer do I have to wait"
You cannot escape from all the words you left behind
You will learn the sense of pain

All your tears kill the good thoughts left in me
No relief from misery
You had time to forget everything
Too many painful words are in you
