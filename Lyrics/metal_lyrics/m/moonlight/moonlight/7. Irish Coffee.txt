Give me your hand
I'll put in on my wet body
I'm going to test your speed
In drinking Irish coffee

Don't go away
You are my lover
Stay with me
Play with my body

Sink in disire
Your death is close
So give mi your hand
Stay, please stay
When you loose yourself
In my arms
You'll forget
About the morning
It will be your end
I won't tell you
Everything
Love me
Slink down in me

Love me
Now
Cimb my soul to heaven
I'm revolving in your mouth
Like a death butterfly
