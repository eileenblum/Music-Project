Desert
In me, in you

In all around
Strike into deep
Of your mind
Feel it, feel it now
'Cose tommorow
You'd touch this

Under the progress
Under the mind
Under the love
Under the human
Under the evil
Under the good

Blowed by th wind of progress
Carried by words think
Comming stroneger and stronger
You're grain pulled
By the desert's winds
