[lyrics: Maja Konarska]

So many enjoyments encountered In his life
Not many displeasures ever crossed his path
And then came a moment
When he had to shut the light
No passion for living
(just)trying to last

Try and hide his hands away
From others
Try and hide his eyes away
From your vision too
And no longer could he trust himself
(he) couldn't trust himself

He discovered what to ask about
Knew the answers so he didn't ask
"I can feel my patience running out
Need more patience to relieve my doubts"

Recovering in agony
(and)trying to forget
The audience was waiting for him to touch
The ground

And every day he kept trying not to remember
And so he killed all the time he could have wasted
He went on
Wanted to stop
