[lyrics: Adam Sypula / Maja Konarska]

Give it to yourself what you just don't have
A little sip or a little stealing
Give it to yourself what you just don't have
Make it more than a wishful thinking
Give it to yourself what you just don't have
What you need but what you reject
Take for you little slice of heaven
That is hanging from the ceiling

Oh yes
This is it
When you think
You've got it all
This thing suddenly comes
And buries your
Perfect life
Your home
In a blink
Changes into
A pile of stone
Standing
Lifeless in a corner
You're too week
To rebuild it

Give it to yourself what you just don't have
Not for ego not for dreaming
Give it to yourself what you just don't have
Make it more than a wishful thinking
Give it to yourself what you just don't have
What you need but what you reject
Take for you little slice of heaven
That is hanging from the ceiling

Oh yes
This is it
Happiness
Is overflowing
This man suddenly comes
Steals her
Away from you
All this
Perfect beauty
Changes into
A pile of mud
Sitting
Lifeless in a corner
You're too weak
To believe again
