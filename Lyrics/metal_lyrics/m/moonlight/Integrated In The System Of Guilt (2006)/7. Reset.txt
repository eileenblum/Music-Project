[lyrics: Maja Konarska]

Please erase my thoughts
Plan my mind from scratch again
Wreck my body too
Create a new one if you can

I can teach you if you want
How to exit quickly after locking me
Paint a pathway arrows and lines
Help me determine which way to go
All the thoughts running through my head
Have made me the person I am today
Now I need to find you again
'Cause you cannot do it

It's so quiet here
No oxygen back there
You want to reset
My thinking
Never asking
