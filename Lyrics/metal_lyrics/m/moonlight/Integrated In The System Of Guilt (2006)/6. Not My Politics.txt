[lyrics: Adam Sypula]

How can I believe it that
How can I deliver that to you
My small deceiver
My disaster and my killer
Shame on you

How can I deliver that to you
My hated leader
Tell me how can I
Deliver that to you

I don't need to know
I don't wish to see
This is not my show
Not my politics
You don't have to speak
I reject your words
Keep you sly deceits
Not my politics

There's a world in black
There's no sun to see
Shadow on your back
Stepping on your heels
Sugar's no more sweet
Smoke hangs in the air
Gotta get out of here
Not my politics
