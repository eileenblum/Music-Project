[lyrics: Maja Konarska]

I will take your self esteem
Come with me
You will lose your common sense
Come with me
I'm the only one you'll see
Come with me
And you'll like the way it is

Perhaps I shouldn't do it
Come with me
You cannot escape from me
Come with me
I'm the only one around
Come with me
And you like the way it is

I love you just a little
A bit but not too much
My eyes are squinting tightly
When you look at me like that

And even all the ashes
Won't control your urge
There is nowhere to run to
You know I won't let go
