[lyrics: Maja Konarska]

Thank you for silence
I'd be happier without it
People wouldn't recognize me
And I wouldn't have more time

Thank you for my egoism
If wasn't there
I'd be a better human
And I wouldn't have more time

Thank you for lies
If they weren't here
I would know the truth
And I wouldn't need more time

I'm throwing words around
They're sitting on the grass
Thinking what will happen

Thank you for misfortune
If it wasn't there
Life would be more entertaining
With no time for anything

Thank you for lies
If they weren't here
I would know the truth
And I wouldn't need more time

Thank you for oblivion
I couldn't live without it
I'd lose all my hopes and dreams
For better days
