[lyrics: Maja Konarska]

I didn't recognize her
When she came to me
Delicately rapped at my window
She was in my room looking for the moon
But it wasn't there

May I sit beside you?
I could hear her ask
She was slightly scared of the darkness
Sat down in the corner
Trying not to trouble me

And I like her
When she's near
I like her

She was listening to my silent mind
The two of just sat there for a while
Then she left without a word
When the sun woke up

I didn't recognize her
When she came to me
Delicately rapped at my window
Took a second thought about her ego
Didn't find him here today
