When someone becomes nothing to anyone
Wilts feelings have died
Anyone would know it
They set out stick and stones
They say they crossed my bones
I say I donât get mad I get even
before they do.

Spoils go to the victor
Iâm dead on time
Your time is going to come

One day Iâll dance on your graves
Even if youâre buried at sea
Till then till when I exact my revenge
Iâll tell them youâre dead to me

Weâre all just trying to hold on to anything
Youâd think theyâd know thatâs what weâre trying to do
These wounds are invisible

Underneath the dirt I still see the scars
But then when things got bad we spread our wings and fly away

Youâll take all your riches in the back of a hearse
Your time is going to come

One day Iâll dance on your graves
Even if youâre buried at sea
Till then till when I exact my revenge
Iâll tell them youâre dead to me

One day Iâll dance on your grave
Even if youâre buried at sea
Till then till when I exact my revenge

One day Iâll dance on your graves
Even if youâre buried at sea
Till then till when I exact my revenge
Iâll tell them youâre dead to me
