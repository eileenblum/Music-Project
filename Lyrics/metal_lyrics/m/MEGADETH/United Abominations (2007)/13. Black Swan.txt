[special edition track]

[composed by Dave Mustaine and Megadeth]

I thought at this hour, any pleasure, could never really be a sin in vain
One hundred and one shots of opportunity, I'd gladly take them all again and again, and again

My angel's left me, sorrows are my own
Now I'm here, with the Devil on my own
Just like a churchyard shadow, creeping after me
It's only there to terrify my mind, a black swan keeps haunting me

I promised on my soul, not to get carried away
It always starts out psychedelic, and then it turns to black
My head starts swaying, I forgot what it was that I was saying
I don't know where I am, and I'll never, never make it back

I sealed my fate, and I paid my debt
I fell from grace with deep regret

My angel's left me, sorrows are my own
And now I'm here, with the Devil on my own
Just like a churchyard shadow, creeping after me
It's only there to terrify my mind, a black swan keeps haunting me
Just like a churchyard shadow, there's nothing left to see
It's only there to terrify my mind, a black swan keeps haunting me

My angel's left me, sorrows are my own
Now I'm here, with the Devil on my own, on my own
Just like a churchyard shadow, creeping after me
It's only there to terrify my mind, a black swan keeps haunting me
Just like a churchyard shadow, there's nothing left to see
It's only there to terrify my mind, a black swan keeps haunting me

Just like a churchyard shadow, creeping after me
There's nothing left to see, There's nothing left of me
