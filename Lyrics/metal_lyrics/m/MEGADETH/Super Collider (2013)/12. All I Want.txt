[Bonus Track]In a filthy barroom
She was shooting pool with friends
I sent someone over and
I watched her shake her head she said
If I wanted to meet her
I had to come at least that far
I introduced myself to a look that would kill
She sneered I know who you are
Oh yeah thatÂ´s right climb on and hold tight
She is all I want in a girl
We took off on a rocket ride
It felt like it would never end
I started movinÂ´ in on over
And I watched her tilt her head she said
If IÂ´m gonna lay it on her

ItÂ´d better be more than just tonight
At that moment I knew after I kissed you
IÂ´ve known you all my life she said
Oh yeah thatÂ´s right climb on and hold tight
She is all I want in a girl
Oh yeah thatÂ´s right I like that sheÂ´s all spice
I am all she wants in my girl
All I want all I need all I want all that I need
All I want all I need all I want all that I need
All I want is a girl she is all that I want
All I want is a girl she is all that I want
All I want is a girl she is all that I want
All I want is a girl she is all that I want
All I want all I need all I want all that I need
All I want all I need she is all that I wantÅ
