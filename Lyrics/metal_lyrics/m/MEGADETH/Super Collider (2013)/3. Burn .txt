[Lyrics &amp; music: Mustaine]

I've got a sickening feeling
My life is standing still
It's clear that fate is closing in

But this is the life I choose
I've got so much time to kill
Born to lose, I'll die to win

Burn, baby burn
'Cause it feels so good

I'm getting on my own nerves
And I get no satisfaction
'Til I light it up and burn it down

One match lights my fire
And it starts a chain reaction
That burns my crooked past to the ground

Burn, baby burn
'Cause it feels so good
Burn, baby burn
Like I knew it would

Fire, I've got the fire
Fire, burning desire
My desire to burn

I hear the darkness call
The sirens are growing near
It's time I make my great escape

The flames are getting tall
Inside my rear view mirror
Just a spark is all it takes

Burn, baby burn
'Cause it feels so good
Burn, baby burn
Like I knew it would

Fire, I've got the fire
Fire, burning desire
I've got the fire
Burning desire
And it burns
Baby it burns
It burns
It burns hotter than hell

Sifting the damage done
I'm burning up all the proof
I won't be going down in flames

At large I'm on the run
They're tightening up the noose
It's too late; I need to get away

Burn, baby burn
'Cause it feels so good
Burn, baby burn
Like I knew it would
