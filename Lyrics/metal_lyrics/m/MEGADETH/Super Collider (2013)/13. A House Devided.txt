[Bonus Track]We all know about the hate youÂ´re breeding
And we pay for the machine youÂ´re feeding
You can never shut up you can never shut down
This house divided this house divided

We all know we all know this house divided
SomethingÂ´s wrong we all know

SomethingÂ´s wrong about the way youÂ´re thinking
The rats are jumping and your ship is sinking
You can never get on you can never get off
This house divided

We all hear about this case youÂ´re pleading
Your demands have gone beyond conceding
You can never get in you can never get out
This house divided

This is a sad day for violence
When speech results in silence
IÂ´m supposed to hate you
YouÂ´re supposed to hate me
We can never agree

Now weÂ´ve become so desperate
DonÂ´t you forget you you asked for it
IÂ´m supposed to hate you
YouÂ´re supposed to hate me
We never agree

We all know about the hate youÂ´re breeding
And we pay for the machine youÂ´re feeding

A house divided a house divided
A house divided a house divided
