[Lyrics &amp; Music: Mustaine]

[Verse 1:]
When you feel life is bringing you down
And you see that youâre all alone
When your friends â they have all run out
That is when you will know I'm the one

[Chorus:]
On the high road
(On the high road)
I will take you higher
(I will take you higher)
Till the world explodes
(Till the world explodes)
Just like a super collider
(like a super collider)

[Verse 2:]
This could be all the heaven you see
Life can be wicked, mean and cold
Could this be the end of your living hell
Come with me and Iâll free your soul

[Chorus:]
On the high road
(On the high road)
I will take you higher
(I will take you higher)
Till the world explodes
(Till the world explodes)
Just like a super collider
(like a super collider)

[Solo - Dave]

[Verse 3:]
Just one thing that I want you to know
You donât need to be on your own
No more feeling left out in the cold
Take my hand and Iâll take you home

[Chorus:]
On the high road
(On the high road)
I will take you higher
(I will take you higher)
Till the world explodes
(Till the world explodes)
Just like a super collider
(like a super collider)

On the high road
(On the high road)
I will take you higher
(I will take you higher)
Till the world explodes
(Till the world explodes)
Just like a super collider
(super collider yeah)

On the high road
I will take you higher
Till the world explodes
Just like a super collider
