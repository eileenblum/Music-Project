I will give you life
You'll serve only me
And my will to kill
You will kill for me

All that I desire
All that I command
You are here for me
I'm your master

My creation

I will make for you
A soul mate to love
Unlike your love for me
And you will take my name

She will be your bride
She will serve me too
And I will introduce you to
The Bride of Frankenstein
