[Music and lyrics: Dave Mustaine]

I know I should have seen the writings
That everything about you is fake
How could I be in such denial?
That all you wanna do is make me hate

You build me up
So you can cut me down
If you're tryna make me hate you
It's working

You may believe
This is gonna make me better
If you're tryna make me hate you
It's working

Each word you said my veins grew harder
I ignored the warnings in my face
My black heart is turning into stone
'Cause all you wanna do is make me hate

You are the only thing
You wanna talk about
If you're tryna make me hate you
It's working

You disagree 'til I don't mind
And you don't matter
If you're tryna make me hate you
It's working

You build me up
So you can cut me down
If you're tryna make me hate you
It's working

You may believe
This is gonna make me better
If you're tryna make me hate you
It's working

You are the only thing
You wanna talk about
If you're tryna make me hate you
It's working

You disagree 'til I don't mind
And you don't matter
If you're tryna make me hate you
It's working
