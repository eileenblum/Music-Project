[iTunes Bonus Track]People tell me you've been talking
I hear you've got a big mouth
Saying things you know aren't true
What the hell are you talking about?

So, now we have a conundrum
And the problem is clearly you
This is the part where it gets ugly
And the solution; getting rid of you

You'll never be safe in the shadows
I'll be waiting in the dark
With a shovel and a bag full of lime
I'll say the devil made me do it

I look who's talking and I see
A big nothing looking back at me
Mine is just to do or die, it's not to reason why
I can't let sleeping dogs that lie, lie

Don't you think I have friends besides you?
You called me out, you couldn't resist
I'll never stop until I find you
That's when you're gonna cease to exist

How stupid do you have to be?
To think the trail of evidence that you've left
Won't boomerang back in your face
To your moth-eaten brain by meth

Like the wolf that does not howl
Concealed and ready to attack
It's time to pay with your flesh
And you'll never stop me

I look who's talking and I see
A big nothing looking back at me
Mine is just to do or die, it's not to reason why
I can't let sleeping dogs that lie, lie

The dogs that bark the loudest are the dogs that have no teeth

I look who's talking and I see
A big nothing looking back at me
Mine is just to do or die, it's not to reason why
I can't let sleeping dogs that lie, lie

Look at you!
Look who's talking, a big nothing looking back at me
Would you look at you?
Look who's talking, a big nothing, that's all I see
Won't you look at you?
Look who's talking, a big nothing, it's what you mean to me
Oh, but you're never gonna be anything anyway
Now roll over and play dead
