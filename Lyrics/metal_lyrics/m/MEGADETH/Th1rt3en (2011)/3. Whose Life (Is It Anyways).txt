[Lyrics &amp; Music - Mustaine]

Oooh, you're just in time
To get inside my head
Oooh, the war of words
You're underneath my skin

You hate the way I wear my clothes
You hate my friends and where we go
I see you in the shadows...
You think you know what's best for me
You hate everything you see in me
Have you looked in a mirror?
HEY! Just whose life is this anyway?
You tell me how to live but who asked you anyway?
HEY! Just whose life is this anyway?
Costs so much more than the price
I ain't gonna pay!

You only point out fault
Anxiety attack!
You running your mouth
You stab me in my back!

[Chorus]

Running your mouth...
Running your mouth...
Stab me in the back...
Anxiety attack...

HEY! Just whose life is this anyway?
You tell me how to live but who asked you anyway?
HEY! Just whose life is this anyway?
Costs so much more than the price
I ain't gonna pay!

HEY! Just whose life is this anyway?
You tell me how to live but who asked you anyway?
HEY! Just whose life is this anyway?
Just whose life is this anyway?
Just whose life is this anyway?
