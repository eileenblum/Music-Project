[Lyrics &amp; Music - Mustaine, Johnny K]

Thirteen times I went to the well
To draw my thoughts, Iâll gather and tell
Like bricks that Iâve laid to build my life
Those that crumbled only caused me strife

Thoughts became words, cast into the sea
But they returned, always haunting me
Like a severed arm washed up on the shore
I just donât think I can give anymore

Because Iâve lived, how many times do I have to die?
Because Iâve lived, how many lives do I have to die?

Thirteen times and itâs been lucky for me
After everything, you still want me to bleed
Thirteen ways to see the devil in my eyes
Because I stood here thirteen times and Iâm still alive

At thirteen I started down this path
Fueled with anger, music was my wrath
Years of clawing at scars that never healed
Drowning my mind, the thoughts are too real

[Chorus]

I can't get out; I can't jump out
Too much to face; I can't erase

[Chorus]
