[Music &amp; Lyrics - Mustaine]

I thought a desire worth any pleasure
Could never really be a sin in vain
A hundred one shots of opportunity
I'd gladly take them all again, and again, and again

My angels left me with sorrows on my own
And now I'm here with the devil on my own
Just like a churchyard shadow creeping after me
It's only there to terrify my mind, a black swan keeps haunting me

I promised on my soul, not to get carried away
It always starts out psychedelic, and then it turns to black
My head starts swaying; I forgot what was it I was saying?
I don't know where I am, and I'll never, never make it back

I sealed my fate, and I paid my debt
I fell from grace with deep regret

My angels left me with sorrows on my own
And now I'm here with the devil on my own
Just like a churchyard shadow creeping after me
It's only there to terrify my mind, a black swan keeps haunting me
Just like a churchyard shadow, there's nothing left to see
It's only there to terrify my mind, a black swan keeps haunting me

My angels left me with sorrows on my own
And now I'm here with the devil on my own, on my own
Just like a churchyard shadow creeping after me
It's only there to terrify my mind, a black swan keeps haunting me
Just like a churchyard shadow, there's nothing left to see
It's only there to terrify my mind, a black swan keeps haunting me

Just like a churchyard shadow, creeping after me
There's nothing left to see, there's nothing left of me
