[Music - Mustaine, Friedman, Johnny K, Lyrics - Mustaine, Johnny K]

Line up all of you and turn in your eyes
You just won't need them anymore
When your mind is ours, to do with what we please
Everything you own and everything you need

Sacrifice your leaders, like it or not
Or else you're going down
With a ship, death on the rocks
Blind follow, blind lead
All our hopes and dreams washed out to sea

All your money's ours to bankroll corrupt wars
You can't see what you're fighting for
Trust your leaders as they send you out to die
The true face of evil can't be seen without eyes

Sacrifice your leaders, like it or not
Or else you're going down
With a ship, death on the rocks
Blind follow, blind lead
All our hopes and dreams washed out to sea

At the start of time, many centuries ago
Came the spawning of Christ and the Antichrist
And darkness fell upon our people
And the children, they were born faceless
Without eyes they could not see
Born unto themselves, they lived and they died
In the millennium of the blind

Blind follow, blind lead
All our hopes and dreams washed out to sea
