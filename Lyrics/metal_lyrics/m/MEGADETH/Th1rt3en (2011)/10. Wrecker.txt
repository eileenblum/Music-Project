[Lyrics &amp; Music - Mustaine]

It doesnât matter what car you drive, sheâll wreck it
It doesnât matter where you sleep at night, sheâll wreck it
It doesnât matter where you go to work
Doesnât matter where you go to church
Doesnât matter just how bad it hurts, sheâll wreck it

My bleached bones in the desert, it's all she's left of me

Poison ivy in your touch, being with you destroyed so much
Home wrecker
Deadly venom in your kiss, hell canât be worse than this
Home wrecker

It doesnât matter what you pretend, sheâll wreck it
It doesnât matter what you defend, sheâll wreck it
It doesnât matter how you live your life
Doesnât matter anymore to your wife
Doesnât matter even how you die, sheâll wreck that too

Like a vulture picking my bones clean, itâs all thatâs left of me

Poison ivy in your touch, being with you destroyed so much
Home wrecker
Deadly venom in your kiss, hell canât be worse than this
Home wrecker

It doesn't matter where you live
It doesn't matter what you drive
Home wrecker

Poison ivy in your touch, being with you destroyed so much
Home wrecker
Deadly venom in your kiss, hell canât be worse than this
Home wrecker
