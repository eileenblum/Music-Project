[Lyrics - Mustaine, Menza, Music - Mustaine, Friedman, Ellefson]

Where hath the apostles gone?
Joining hands with wicked ones
Revelation has come to pass,
New World Order will hold the mass
A book written by the man
Used to control and command
All rights will be denied,
Without the mark you shall die

[2x]
No confession, all is known (all is known!)
New World Order, you shall be shown (shall be shown!)

Monitoring all wages
New World Order comes in stages
Currency is obsolete
Feel the agony of defeat
A symbol of society today
A must have or you shall pay
As humans flesh leads the mind
Just a pawn, the last martyr dies

[2x]
No confession, all is known (all is known!)
New World Order, you shall be shown (shall be shown!)

Where hath the apostles gone?
Joining hands with wicked ones
Revelation has come to pass
New World Order, complete disorder
Will hold the mass
