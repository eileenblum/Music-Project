[Japanese Bonus Track]One thing
That I got for you
Is the one thing
That you never do

One thing makes you feel brand new
Is the one thing that you're coming to
Just the one thing
Gets you in the mood

You call my number in the middle of the night
To tell me nothing else can make you feel alright
But it rings and rings you hang it up
And call me back again

One thing
That I got for you
Is the one thing
That you never do

One thing
That you got to choose
Is the one thing you can never lose
Just the one thing is your attitude

You call my name in the middle of the night
When your makin' love and it feels alright
But it's him not me
Can't you see a shot of reality?

I know what you do
I know what you want to do
I know when the lights go out
I know what you are gonna to do

One thing
That I got for you
Is the one thing
That you never do

Just the one thing gets you in the mood
Just the one thing its your attitude
One thing is one thing
Just the one thing
Oh
