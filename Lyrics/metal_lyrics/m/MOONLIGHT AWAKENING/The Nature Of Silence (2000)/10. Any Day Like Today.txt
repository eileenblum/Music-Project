breathe inside denial into the ashes of our wasted time 
like an only child who's so convincing care never finds 
truth in these surroundings, 
the longest mass-conception of disgust 
faith in these corruptions, 
the furthest misdirection of our trust 
only when we feel it, ourselves, do we see what we could've seen 
only if we feel it, we rise above to all we could've been 

on any day like today, it might have mattered to me 
on any day like today, i would've cared to see 
it was only yesterday that it mattered to me 
it was only yesterday i would've cared to see
