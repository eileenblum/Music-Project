A simple night is all it takes 
A touch of care and I feel fine 
Disillusion is opening 
It so performs so heartening 
I know what knows and besides; 
lavish all we can't decide 
To take into an inner peace 
A thoughtless hope and I feel fine 
Severed and we're swallowing 
All that we are following 
I know what knows and besides, 
We were what the future holds
