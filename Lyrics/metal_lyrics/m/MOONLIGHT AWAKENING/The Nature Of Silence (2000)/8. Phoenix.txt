to practice flight in your grasp 
i feel withdrawn from your hands 
the only difference isn't clear 
i shout my name but you won't hear 

and it seems like tomorrow has been and gone 
there's just no inbetween 
sometimes i think the only way i'll survive is alone 
and i know that we're all gods 
but today i feel like nothing 
i wanna redefine what it's like to be on my own 

it's just how i feel sometimes 
cause it's so hard for me 
no, i don't want your sympathy 
it's just a part of my mind 
i doubt you wanna hear this 
though my feelings are so strong 
it's why i say i'm torn 
and why i can't conceive of bliss 

the phoenix tries to to hold on all it has 
it's dreaming for the walls to fall and break apart 
to fly away somehow yet always be at home 
the phoenix falls again and always ends alone
