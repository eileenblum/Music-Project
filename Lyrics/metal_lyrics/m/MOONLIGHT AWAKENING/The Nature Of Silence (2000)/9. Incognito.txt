hello am i speaking to someone who isn't real? 
it's fallen all apart and the truth must be revealed 
with all that's done you know you've hurt me too 
with all I do there's nothing here for you. 
you'd like me to think that i've become neurotic 
it's all the same to you when you are so psychotic 
well i dont know if there's much more that i can do 
when all I do's just not enough for you 

hello am i speaking to someone who cannot feel? 
you've broken the trust between us and still expect me to heal 
from all the words you threw right in my face 
from all the words you'll break me with today 
you'd like me to think that i am so inferior 
and still you want me to look beyond these fears 
well i don't know if there's much more for you 
than all i am and all i cannot do 

Say it again like you know that it's over my head 
Say it again, make me feel like you wanted me dead 

Say it again like you know that you're over 
say it again make me feel that I'm under 
just say it again don't you do it again, no 
Say it again and I'm running for cover 

hello am i speaking to someone who understands? 
it's fallen all apart and the blood is on your hands 
with all that's done you know it's over soon 
cause all i am is not enough for you 

and i'm running...
