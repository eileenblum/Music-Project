do you think the world has changed tonight? 
i think it's not too late 
so have we reached our fate? 
we don't care if it's beyond our sight 
i'm closing up the door 
and yearning all the more 

a blameless veil of supremacy 
a sheltered life, this indignity 
of passing time and hopeless dreams 
an isolated purity... 
this simple test of integrity 
all of this, this simplicity 
cause i've seen the world in honesty 
seen the fucked up tragedy 

do you think my life has changed tonight? 
i'm losing something more 
to lose what i adore 
i cannot help but think this isn't right, 
so i'm opening the door 
to feel forevermore 

she approaches me with sincerity 
a change of pace this audacity 
oh i'm praying for some secrecy 
i'm praying for this ecstacy 
the shameless veil of honesty 
all of this, this complexity 
yeah i offered her my sincerity 
offered her on bended knees 
my sacred vow of honesty 
i'm feeling all this complacency 
oh i never thought i'd ever see 
all of this was all concealed
