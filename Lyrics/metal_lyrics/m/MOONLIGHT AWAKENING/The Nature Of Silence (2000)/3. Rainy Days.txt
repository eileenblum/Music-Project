i'm looking out to the sun's reflective gaze 
i was once all alone on rainy days 
it was consuming the heart, the hope in me 
so i searched a cure to set me free 
the people spoke of disease that preys on all 
a theory that would suggest we've lost control 
and even with all my doubts i just assumed 
that i would find satisfaction, be consumed 
all my addictions are so, oh so lovely 
in my prediction of time it's fantasy 
i have swallowed the pills that make me sane 
i am happy with hope and bound in chains 

so they say it rains today 
it doesn't matter anyway i know 
i don't think i'll ever see 
the tragedy that i turned out to be
