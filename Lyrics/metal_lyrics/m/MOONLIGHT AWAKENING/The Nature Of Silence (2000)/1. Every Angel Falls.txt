i know it's so hard for you 
i fear there is nothing i can do 
proceeding this far with you 
i've spoken you nothing but the truth
we dream on these lonely nights 
and how on this planet we'll survive
to only escape from this 
i wanna escape into your eyes 

your breathing so silent now 
and all of your light is masked in shrouds
of hopelessness and defeat 
the absense of mystic gifts renown 
i know it's so difficult 
the mind and the soul can't come to terms 
with tranquil and open thoughts 
and all the despondency we've learned 

don't tell me you're nothing, don't tell me you're gone 
just tell me you're something, just tell me i'm wrong 
with millions of people and millions of stars 
you've opened my mind and broken my heart 

say it's true and i don't mind that all the angels fall tonight
say it's real, i won't despair, but there were days when i once cared
