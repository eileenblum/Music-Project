I'm torn between left and right 
cast beneath the beauty of this shimmering sight 
I know it's a priceless touch 
to fade into obscurity I can't get enough 
This feels like I've never felt 
and I fear of going over back inside myself 
Right now I want to fall in your arms 
forget all my concerns for you have opened my heart 

when I feel apart from you 
and you're such a part of me 
I know you can't believe 
that I feel apart from me 

I'm torn between left and right 
with memories between us in the candlelight 
I know that it would break me apart 
if you would walk away and we could only depart 
This feels like I've never felt 
and I couldn't go back over, back inside myself 
And now that I have seen this far 
I fear of letting go for you have opened my heart 

when I feel apart from you 
and you're such a part of me 
I thought I'd never say 
that I feel apart from me 
without you...
