i know you feel it's much too much for you 
the days are over and it's up to you 
and it seems so rare... 

i know it's more than what you thought before 
you had it once again and now you want it more 
and it seems so rare... 

i know you feel that there is nothing you can do
the day's beginning and it's up to you 
but i can't make you care... 

i know it's more than what you're thinking now 
the only limit is how much you allow 
and it seems so... so rare 

so let's go, I wanna walk on air 
they say it isn't possible but I just don't care 
let's move, let's get out of here 
leave this place behind us and just disappear 
let's fly, take it to the sky 
hold onto the other and we'll reach so high 
let's go and we will reach our dreams 
forget those around us who would intervene 

i don't know why you're paranoid 
i just know how we got this far... 

so let's go, let's dispel our fears 
they said it wasn't possible but i'm finally here 
let's move, wipe away those tears 
we'll leave this pain beside us and we'll disappear 
let's fly, take it to the sky 
hold onto the other and we'll reach so high 
let's go and we will reach our dreams 
this light is all around us and i finally see 
so let's go...
