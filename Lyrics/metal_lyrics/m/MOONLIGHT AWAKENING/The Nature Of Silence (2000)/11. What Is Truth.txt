so you say that she has died today 
i wish i could say i care in any way 
why is it so alarming to believe 
that even with death you won't infect me 

it's overwhelming don't you see to realise all she couldn't be 
but even when she had a chance it disappeared so cold and fast 
i know it's something hard for you when there is nothing you can do 
and you'd expect i'd feel the same, you'd expect i feel ashamed 

this is how i am, i don't care for you anymore 
this is what i've become, there is no way you'll understand 
there is no truth, there is nothing, 
there is no truth there are only lies 
there is no truth, this is everything, 
there is no truth there is only mine 

it's overwhelming don't you see to realise all you couldn't be 
you put your thoughts in what has passed to find a strength that cannot last 
i know it's something hard for you when there is nothing you can do 
and you'd expect i'd feel the same but i will never feel ashamed...
