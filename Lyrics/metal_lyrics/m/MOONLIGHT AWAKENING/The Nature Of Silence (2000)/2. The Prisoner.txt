you've thrown away the world, no longer can you see
you've left your soul somewhere that you can never be 
in this place you've gone you see no light inside 
in this place you've gone i'm hoping that you die 

and when the night is calling i won't hear your cries 
and when the dark is falling i won't hear your lies 

every word you've told and every tear you've spilled 
falls into emptiness for every chance you've killed 
you'd walk away right now if you could find a way 
for more attention drawn towards every game you play 

and when the night is calling i won't hear your cries 
just empty words beneath a foolish frail disguise
