I won't be wrong again, 
This time I know it all 
I won't be wrong again, 
This time will be my last. 

I won't decide again, 
Wherever I let it go 
Will I reprise again 
A shadow of my own. 

In this we say "I can relate" 
I dissipate into the shade. 

And it just keeps happening, will I ever be clean again? 
It just keeps on happening, will I ever know why? 

I'm always wrong again 
'only an oversight' 
I never leave it all 
and giving in despite... 

If I opened up my eyes 
Would I see through her disguise 
Will I ever really know 
if I don't try...? 

In this we say "I can relate" 
I dissipate into the shade. 

And it just keeps happening, will I ever be free again? 
It just keeps on happening, will I never know why? 

Now I see the way you look at me 
When you see the side you've never seen.
