What I see, what I feel 
Will I try, will I kneel? 
We're out there, and I fear 
Will I find anything again? 

Will I see what you see? 
Will I bleed what you bleed? 
We're out here, and I feel 
I will find everything the same 

Please, just hear me 
..."I try to" 
Just hear what I have to say 

So I can run to where you are 
So I can understand this time 
So I can run to where you are for one more time. 

So I can take into my heart 
All the world and all the stars 
So I can see for what it's worth for one more time. 

What I see, what I feel 
A picture that's not real 
A symptom of our hope 
And all emotions turned to stone. 

If I need what you need 
Then why can't we just be? 
We're out here, and I fear 
We'll never find our way again. 

You don't hear me 
..."I try to" 
Just hear what I have to say. 

and I will run to where you are 
So we can understand this time 
and I will run to where you are for one more time. 

So I can take into my heart 
All the world and all the stars 
So I can see for what it's worth for one last time...
