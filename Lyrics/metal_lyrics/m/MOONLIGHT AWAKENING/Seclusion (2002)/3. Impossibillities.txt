Whatever way you are, 
Whatever things you see 
All these things incomplete so far 

Whatever changes take 
Thru every life you fake 
This is the way you truly are 

Yet here with you, seasons have changed 
The light has gone out in the rain 
And soon the time will come again 
Where you cannot see how it ends 

Whatever way you are, 
Whatever things you dream, 
It seems that you're trying much too hard 

Whatever chance you take, 
another promise breaks, 
You cannot escape the way you are 

I know you don't want to believe 
That everyone's turning to leave 
You fall like a glass to the floor 
And cry as they walk out the door 
You seem to be feeling you're free 
Now everyone's turning to see 
You've given them all that they need 
But you've got no blood left to bleed 

When the sun comes out again, 
I see your shadow fade away... 

Here with you, seasons have changed 
The light has gone out in the rain 
And soon the time will come again 
Where you cannot see how it ends 

You seem to be running this way 
But no one can stop the pain 
You seem to want all this to go 
Until you are left alone
