So desperate to find another way to hold 
In all your weak pursuits, you lose all that you chose 

The doubts in my mind I never could find 
They're all I can see here 
If fate can't exist, then I can't resist 
The doorway to new fears 

I am so alive 
(suffice to say) 
I will sacrifice my hopes away 

Another time and place, much like it was before 
I've chosen to delay, I've chosen to ignore 

If everyone knew, then no one would try 
it's all complicated.. 
If nothing is found, will no one believe 
The path we're betraying? 

I am so alive, 
I will sacrifice my heart away 

So many ways to go, I wish I didn't know 
So many ways to go from here ... 
The pressure's closing in, 
and soon I must begin 
So many ways to go from here 

Is this how it feels, is this how it is 
To know what you're saying...? 
If nothing is found, will you turn around 
And wish that you waited? 

Was all this a lie, 
Have I sacrificed my life away? 
All I ever try, 
Can't help wonder why it's still the same
