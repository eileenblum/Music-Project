I don't wonder anymore 
Could I see you for what you are? 
Inconsequencial ways; 
whatever way you try to change 
You always stay the same 

I don't worry anymore 
And try to find what's lost; the way you were 
Impossible to say 
No matter how, I can't explain 
There's nothing left to save 

On and on we try to mend these broken dreams 
On and on we try and never let it be 

Still I wonder all the more 
Have I seen you for what you are? 
Upon the breaking day 
A synchronised unfelt decay 
Is there no other way? 

On and on we try to mend these broken dreams 
On and on we try and never let it be 

This is not how it is, 
This is only how it ends 
On and on again...
