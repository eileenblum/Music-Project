All the things that could have been; I retreat 
I severed all my ties, would I bring them back to this? 

Everyone just fades away 
and I'll never be afraid 

What can I say to you? 
will we fall down, will we pull through? 
Tell you how far I've come 
And of all I've done since you turned away 

Silent in all that's come to pass, I diverge 
To pretend it's all the same, to be that one again 
and as I have been replaced 
I could never find a way 

There's nothing I'd say to you 
that could change this, that would make this 
Something that cannot be 
For this memory is all that's left 

above and beyond 
Wishing that rain would fall again 
Playing the part you can't sustain 

If you wanted to see, if you wanted to feel 
If you wanted to try, if you wanted to heal 
You might open your mind, 
but you can't close your mouth anytime... 

I think you should know 
You'll end up alone 
I'm hearing you less every day 
Someone should take 
Your thoughts all away 
For all you would do to stay 

Sealing the fate which holds your name 
Can't comprehend, can't take the blame 

Now it all crashes down, so you're thinking aloud 
Of the world that's absurd and of all you deserve 
Let me leave you to this, 
and the truth you dismiss once again... 

I think that you know 
You'll end up alone 
And suffer through all that you face 
As chances dissolve 
And solace evolves 
In this you will find your place
