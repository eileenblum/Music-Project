So I live another day, so I find another way 
where I try to succeed in this life 
So I see another sign, so I live for another crime 
and so I walk all the way, all the while 

Unimpressed by what I've heard 
Can't relate to all the world 
and there are times when everything hurts 
What it takes, I'll never know 
Deliverance of what we hope 
In a dream, all the same, we deny it 

Step inside and find the way you never had a choice 
In a time where I lose my mind I fear the silent voice 
A desperate try with no end in sight, a fatal impossible dream 
Will I wonder why I've chosen to place 
a faith in the things I can't see? 

Step aside and trace the dreams that open up the sky 
In a time where we never find a meaning to our lives 
A desperate try we always defy, a fatal impossible dream 
Will I wonder why I've chosen to place 
a faith in the things I believe? 

Faith for a while, 
try for one day 
please, for a while, 
for all eternity 

So I live another day, so I find another way 
and so I try to believe it this time 
So I see another sign, so I live for another time 
where I don't chase the words of a liar 

So I give until it's worse 
I never care for what it's worth 
and there are times when everything hurts 
What it takes, I'll never know 
Deliverance of what we hope 
In a dream, all the same, in denial
