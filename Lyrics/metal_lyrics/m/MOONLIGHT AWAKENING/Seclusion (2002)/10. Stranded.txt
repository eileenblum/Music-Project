I've traveled so far 
To be in this place 
A beautiful day 
It's such a shame. 

In so many ways I was frozen, 
For just one moment more, I'd say 
In so many ways alone, always... 

However I try 
To see what it means 
No one would stay 
Stranded this way. 

In so many ways I was broken, 
For all the hopes I had inside 
Lay shattered among the past... 
In so many ways I was holding 
Onto a fragment of my life 
When everything made sense sometimes. 

Take this day and slow it down 
Feel the fear, all around. 

and Fly thru the night, 
Would you give every thing away 
For the moment? 
Take in the sight 
And just give everything away 
For a moment...
