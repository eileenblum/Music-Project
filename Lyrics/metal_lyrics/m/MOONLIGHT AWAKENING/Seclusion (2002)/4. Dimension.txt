Betrayed a moment more by progress that we make 
My vision's blurred by what the filters can't display 
Illusions of dimensions, illogical machines.. 
This punishment is all my senses speaking for me 

Like a dreamworld you can't wake up from 
I can feel it, driven by desperation 
Only you know what's hidden beneath it all; 
You destroy it, and can't see what went wrong 

Elusive inner sense, unknowing of existence, 
So hindered by the times we know and these advances 
We never could decide to make another choice 
In fear we watch the ones who profit all rejoice 

Like a dreamworld you can't wake up from... 

Somehow I live, somehow I try 
The time we lost I can't deny 
Somehow I learn, in this I lose 
And all I'd give if I could choose 

(what does it all mean ? 
it doesn't mean anything) 

Standing still once more, I try and disconnect 
Can't demonstrate the way it was, the way we knew it 
I watch it break away beneath the fading sun 
Accepting eyes desensitized yet I can't bear it
