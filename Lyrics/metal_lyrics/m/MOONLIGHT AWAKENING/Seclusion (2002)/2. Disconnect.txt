Separate us now, be the one you want to see 
Take it all apart, find the way you want to be 
Can you see the way I've tried, can you see the way I've died 
I see the things they fall apart, I cannot find a way to start 

In my head, it's full of lies.. 

Dissonance relayed, from the world in which we stray 
Visions in our head, prisoners of what remains 
Can you see the way I've lived, can you see the way I've gived 
I see the things they fall apart, I never find a way to start 

In my head, it's full of lies.. 
don't tell me, don't justify 

So I can feel you through this complication 
So I can pull through towards my destination
