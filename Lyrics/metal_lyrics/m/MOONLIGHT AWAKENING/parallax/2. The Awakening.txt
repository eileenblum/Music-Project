tell me what has happened to me
i'm a long way from home
and stuck inbetween
tell me all your wildest dreams
i've been gone for so long
don't know where i have been

tell me what's become of us all
i remember it so differently
but can't be too sure
tell me why we've built these walls
i've been gone for so long
i'll be gone when they fall

(it's time we break it down)
