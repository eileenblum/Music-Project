say you need me
like that would please me
say you'll hold me-
you'd rather own me
keep speaking promises
then break me down
i'd wish that silence
was the only sound

when it's all your way,
will i hear you say,
"you mean nothing to me"?

say your kind words, all your desires
speak of passion.. beyond attraction
cause i'm too stupid;
i haven't learned
you say these words...
till they're returned

so penetrate me
turn me around
yeah desecrate me
that's what it's all about.
assimilate me;
i don't care what you do
if you're not lucky
i may turn into you

cause when it's all your way,
you don't have to say,
"you mean nothing to me".

so i'm leaving
you're too deceiving
and if i miss you
i won't forgive you
it's ever hopeless-
no compromise.
i've seen thru all your masks.
i've seen thru all your lies.

when i go away,
i don't hear you say,
"you mean nothing to me".
when i go away,
can you hear me say,
"you mean nothing to me"?

(you will not be safe. 
you will not be saved.
you mean nothing to me.)
