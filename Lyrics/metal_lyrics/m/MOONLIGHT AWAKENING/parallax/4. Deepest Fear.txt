imagine a world
where nothing has changed
where it's all the same
but everyone is gone.
what would you do with it all?

here's where we're at
where we depend on each other
but hate each other
and anyone who says otherwise
is just lying...

i imagine myself
in a world without you
where we don't pretend so many things

but my deepest fear
is clinging onto what there is;
wanting things to perservere,
needing you to keep me here.
cause somehow, with all our differences
you need me to think like you...
and for every dream that tortures me,
i'll torture you.
