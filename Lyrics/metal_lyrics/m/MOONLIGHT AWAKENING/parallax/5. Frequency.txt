sometimes
it feels like i'm dying

sometimes
it seems like i've been lying

sometimes
it feels like i'm dreaming
cause sometimes is all i can feel.

if only i'd known the way i would be changing course
if only i'd known...

sometimes
i wish i could have changed it all
but sometimes is always just an afterthought

if only i'd known the way i would be changing course
if only i'd known... sometimes
if only i'd known the way it would be after all
but sometimes is always just an afterthought
