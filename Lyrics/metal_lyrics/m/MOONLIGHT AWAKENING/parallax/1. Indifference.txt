he lays face down on the ground
but nobody comes or cares
feels only disgusted stares

he lays down
for the world to walk on him
cause nobody wants to know
no one will listen

would it be different,
if it were you?
would you expect no more
if it was someone that you knew?

when i stop and can't go on-
if it's too hard to walk alone
if i can't make it on my own

would you notice;
would you care to see?
or would you turn your back instead
and hardly care if i was dead...

should it be different,
if it were you?
should you expect much more
if it was someone that you knew?

i know i'm not one to sympathise
i never said i would ever try
or that i'd never step aside
i know it seems wrong to prophetise
but can't you see these growing lies
create a shell in which you hide

it won't be different
when it is you
so don't expect much more
cause there is nothing i will do
oh is it murder,
to let this travesty go on?
can we be honest
and say we only care for our own?
we are indifferent.
