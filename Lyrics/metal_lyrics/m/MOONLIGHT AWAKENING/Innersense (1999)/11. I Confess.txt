[Vlastyn]

I confess I'm nothing you thought I'd be 
but you already knew 
It's only some days that I forget myself 
and but fewer that I care 

I'm nothing that I wanted to be 
I've said nothing that I wanted to say 
And it's only now that I confess 
I'll never find my own way 

You looked so solemn as I laughed at 
everything you said
You thought that I actually cared 
when I really wanted you dead 

I'm nothing that I wanted to be 
I've said nothing that I wanted to say 
And it's only now that I resent myself
cause I'll never find my own way 

And it's the way I'm always going to be 
because I've lost concern for myself 
And it's the way I'm always going to be 
because I've lost control of myself
