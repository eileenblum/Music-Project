[Emma Kiernan]

This world is full of 
truth covered lies 
are you a dream come true? 
or a nightmare in disguise? 

If I knew my life 
would be over in a night 
would I be saying something real? 
would I be brave enough to feel? 

A sun is never late for a rise 
and history fools, its never kind 
but will a craving child 
wake before they die? 

How come in order to live, 
something has to die? 
why does the threat of death 
make me feel alive? 

I'm leaving for a heaven 
that I have never seen, 
I hope its like they say
I hope its like my dreams.
