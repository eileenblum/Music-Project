[Vlastyn]

Words I've felt, things I've known 
All the while nothing has grown 
And you have touched, you have sworn 
To all the things now all forlorn 

Do I dare, will I try 
Will I break you from this lie? 
Like innocence upon a stage 
Run right out, left us enraged 

I wonder why his suicide 
Killed so many, made them lie 
For their right to persist 
In their speech of unfelt bliss 

Thing I've seen, things I've killed 
All the tears, the clear blood spilled 
I question you, question me 
But my own truth you do not need 

Will I die, will I die? 
Oh god please, please tell me why 
Tell me now, tell me now 
And all about the world somehow 

I'll take a breath in the stars 
And let you know just how far 
How I wish to know so soon 
How I wish this might be true
