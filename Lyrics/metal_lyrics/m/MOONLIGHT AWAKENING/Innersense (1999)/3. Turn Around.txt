[Vlastyn]

I don't think you understand, and I don't think you can
We're running around in circles and I'm forgetting all I am
This is not what I wanted to be, can't you see? 
It's just not who I am, what I want, what I'll ever be... 

And you just held me in your arms 
But did you hold me in your heart? 
Perhaps you felt you did that day 
But we delude ourselves this way.

I feel your hands cold like death, so end it now... 
We're running around in circles and I'm afraid there's nothing left 
"Is this your fate?", you say, freezing under the sun... 
Just like you, I fear, this nightmare I've become.

And you just held me in your arms 
But did you hold me in your heart? 
Perhaps you felt you did that day 
But we delude ourselves this way.

And as I quickly come undone 
There's just nowhere left to run 
And now I'm slowing drowning here 
In a rain of your fake tears.
