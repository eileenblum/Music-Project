[Vlastyn]

Is it too late to remember those innocent days? 
You harbour resentment, I know 
You remember only the things I've taken away 
I'm silenced by grief and crying below this haze... 

I've been so selfish, been such a fool, 
I always knew I'd never really get inside of you 

Is it too late to hope now everything's changed? 
We've traded places yet it's never the same 
They sought the illusion that I shed 
To become the one thing that they dread 

They're all discouraged catastrophes 
and I'll never grant them any of my sympathy 

If only we learned to forget... 
Instead we're taught to regret... 

It was always my thought if we learned to forget we'd be innocent again 
The way we must think, the way we must choose, the way we must always pretend
It was always my thought if we learned to forget we'd be innocent again
Because who can argue what's right or wrong when it all comes down to the 
end? 

If only we'd learned to forget...
We'd never know such regret...
