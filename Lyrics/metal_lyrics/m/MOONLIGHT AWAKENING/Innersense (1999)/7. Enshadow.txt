[Vlastyn]

Take to the ends of humanity wishing for reprieve
Take from me your atrocity, turn around and leave 
For the world is wrong I found out 
For the hope that's lost I wound up 

In shadows of spirit, cause my life is gone 
I don't need your healing, cause everything is wrong 

Pray and tell your cause, I'm fighting your frustration
You know it's your own loss, I hope for desolation 
For the world is wrong, I found out 
Now that I don't care I've wound up 

In shadows of spirit, cause my life is gone 
I don't need your healing, cause everything is wrong 

The border's crossed and I am done 
You must take everything, you've won 
I'm just another face like yours 
So take my soul and make me pure 
I'm mindless just like all the rest 
Forsaken everything, I'm blessed 
I must repent for it's your will 
I'm one of you now that I'm killed 

...... It lifts me from the edge, 
You've stolen me again, and made me 

Enshadowed by spirit, cause my life is wrong
I'm taken by your healing and everything is gone
