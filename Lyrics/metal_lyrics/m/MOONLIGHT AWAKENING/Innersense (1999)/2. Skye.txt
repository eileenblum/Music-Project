[Vlastyn]

I look to the clouds 
but I can't see all that there is 
do you know if I'm allowed 
to be granted a single wish 

I wanna take to the sky, I wanna see it in your eyes
I wanna do the impossible 
without wings i wanna fly 
I wanna live in your dreams, I dont care how it seems
forget the world we know 
for its in you that I believe 

I wanna be here till its over 

I look to the world 
and i'm afraid of all there is 
do you know what's happened here? 
an emptiness of broken bliss 

I wanna take to the sky, I wanna see it in your eyes
I wanna do the impossible 
without wings I wanna fly 
I wanna live in your dreams, I dont care how it seems
forget the world we know 
for its in you that I believe 

I wanna reach to the sky 
I wanna feel it in your eyes 
instead of going under in the world beneath our cries
I wanna live in this dream 
i dont care how it seems 
instead of going under in the world beneath our screams

I wanna die till its over
