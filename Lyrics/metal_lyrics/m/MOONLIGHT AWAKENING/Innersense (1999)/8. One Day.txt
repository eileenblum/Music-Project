[Vlastyn]

It is rare that I see truth within myself. 
My sprit is broken and torn apart 
I'm giving up hope, giving up all I've cared about 
I'm so discouraged, so down 
and I'm feeling so sick, 
Like I've used up all my chances. 

...I'd sleep but the cold awakens me. 
(The coldness that makes me feel alive) 

It's just that one day I hope to be something else 
Someone besides myself 
If only one day I could be someone else
For just one day 
I might not feel so alone.
