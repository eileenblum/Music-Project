"I kill myself 
I kill for god 
Waiting, leaving, 
I can't see your light 
I can't feel you..." 

You see we've come to the end 
And I can't pretend we'll return anymore 
Do you see now where we've gone 
Can you understand can you feel it strong? 
I don't know where the answer lies 
We live by fear and die in denial 
Is this the final chance you have? 
Will you take it now, will make it last? 

"Just rape my mind 
Make me believe it all 
I can't help your dead hands 
I am agonised by fear 
Punish me, scorn me 
Throw me into hell, I belong there 
and I won't die for you 
I can't die for you 
I'm already fucked, I'm already dead 
by the sins I've forsaken" 

You burned in the fire of their heart's content 
and followed everywhere they went 
You won't believe this is your fate 
Until the day you fall from grace 
(You'll fall from grace...) 

"Insert the cross 
into my bloody cunt 
I'm a slut for you 
and only for you 
Sodomized, victimised 
I can't be chastitised 
So fuck me, love me, 
do me all over again 
Yeah take me to heaven, 
Take it like you never have 
And make me pure again."
