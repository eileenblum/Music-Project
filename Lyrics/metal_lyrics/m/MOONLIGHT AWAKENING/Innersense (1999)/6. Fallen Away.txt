[Vlastyn]

Desolation can't explain 
Yearning for death you can't refrain 
So bow your head and turn away 
And face the night some other day 

Endless nights so dark and bright 
Shatter your long forgotten sight 
So stand beside or face your fears 
And turn to god and disappear 

A long frustration can't explain 
Necessities to love his name 
One hundred years to crucify 
One thousand years to satisfy 

As you die you'll long to live 
And plead with death to forgive 
Bring you back to where you're from 
Let your sentence be undone 

In weakness, frozen in your fears 
In heaven, dying all these years 
In sadness, drowning in your tears 
Forever, your cries no one shall hear 

Fall, awaiting in the fields afar
Away, deeper into the fields below
