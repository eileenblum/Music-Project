into a dark despair, i see you turn away 
are you alone at last, is that the only way? 
i came to see the sun, i came to see the sky 
i came to watch the world that makes you cry 

i'm looking out of the window, looking for your anger 
i'm looking out of the window, searching for your anger 

beware the hours that pass into a thousand days 
if you can't stand it here, why do you stay? 
you'll never see the sun, you'll never see the sky 
you'll never touch the world and come alive 

i'm looking out of the window, looking for your anger 
i'm looking out of the window, searching for your anger 
i'm looking out of the window, and time is running faster 
i'm looking out of the window, searching for the answer 
just like you.
