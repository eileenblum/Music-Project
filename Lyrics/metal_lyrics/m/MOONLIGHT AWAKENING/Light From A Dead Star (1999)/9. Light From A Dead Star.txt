I see you falling down tonight 
i see you coming near to hold 
oh did you feel it was surreal? 
i see dark strangers coming near 

you cannot be afraid, 
you cannot be afraid tonight... 

i see you turning down the lights 
illusions complicate your sight 
oh don't you see it's so unreal? 
i see yourself feeding your fear 

you cannot be afraid, 
you cannot be afraid tonight...
