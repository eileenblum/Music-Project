A time that's for myself, i know just what i've done 
and there's no reprieve so i'll always run 
awakened from the dark, i hold it in my heart 
the secrets that we keep, my aching soul must sleep 

i know just how you feel, the way i'm fucked up here 
but still i can't reveal the emptiness i fear 
i cannot find a way, i think i'm past that day 
where there's no return, when will i ever learn? 

i'm holding on... i'm holding on, 
to a hope less broken 

let's watch the days go on, forget all that we've known 
and as the sun goes down you'll laugh at all we've done 
just drink it all away, you'll forget every day 
and as your life goes by, you'll laugh until you cry. 

i'm holding on... i'm holding on, 
to a life less broken...
