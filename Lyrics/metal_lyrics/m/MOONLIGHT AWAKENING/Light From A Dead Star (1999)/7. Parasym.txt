whispered melodies and a sound of your voice 
traverse thru my mind and leave me with no choice 
now it's tomorrow, the days have turned to grey 
with it your absense that made you feel this way 

and no one knew what you felt would hurt us all... 
no one knew you, but they're all here to watch you fall 

angels in your words open my mind 
i'm overcome with sorrow, i'm overcome by time 
now it's tomorrow, the days have turned to grey 
with it a promise that made you turn away 

and no one knew you, what you felt would hurt us all. 
no one knew you, but they're all here to watch you fall, 
to watch you fail...
