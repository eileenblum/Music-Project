to see you again, to hold you in embrace 
to feel hope again, to hold it and embrace 
the memory of your eyes, the memory i've sought 
but i won't find it ever cause all that's left is lost 

you stood before me 
and i forgot to breathe 

now those days are gone, i'm hurting everyone 
but i can't take back all i've said and done 
so now i lay here restless, alone i am distraught 
i've chosen my own ways and all that's left is lost 

i wish this pain would leave, 
i wish i couldn't breathe
