would you say that it's like this forever? 
if it could only stop, ever... 
it's just the way things turn out, 
the way it always is 
and i can't forget this, never... 

we see it all in such different colours 
we see it now that it's changing shape 

the violet in our eyes, the violence in disguise 
the shades and the shadows that we all see as our own 
it's the violet that we all love to despise 

i am my own, am i alone? 
am i alone? 

i am my own, i am alone 
but everything is violet... 
there's nothing at all we can do to change this 
now that everything is violet. 
just forget about this, 
just forget about me 
we'll just suffer individually 
we'll pretend it's alright 
can you pretend it's alright? 
can you really survive this misery?
