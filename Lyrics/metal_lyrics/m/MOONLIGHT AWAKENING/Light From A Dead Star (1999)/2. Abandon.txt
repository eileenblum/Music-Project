Do you remember a time when we were young? 
a special time and a place under the sun 
and if we had it again would we make it last? 
cause special times in our lives burn away so fast 

Do you remember a time when we would laugh? 
under the stars and the moon, upon the grass 
and yeah we knew it would end but we had no care 
cause we abandoned our fears and we walked on air 

Have we lost those times? 
have we lost our minds? 
cause i wouldn't do it over again 
i think we've lost ourselves 
and everything that we believed 
and we don't care anymore 
just like the way it used to be 

Every word upon my lips is cold and burning me 
every word i say is burning all i see 
and i feel it. 
and i feel it all the same. 

Just like the time that i can't forget 
just like these days that i regret 
it's killing me all over again, all the time 
it's persuading my mind to forget 

Do you remember a time when we were young? 
do you remember those times when we had fun? 
do you remember at all what it meant to cry? 
i can't remember it now, 
because the memory has died...
