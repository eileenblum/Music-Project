Waiting for the day to close, wanting to reveal the unknown... 
You ask that I would listen to you, 
cause you think the answer lies within you. 

Fragments of what yesterday would bring, you ask that I forget the 
suffering... 
I didn't know it was so clear to you; 
You think that he controls all your moves 
"There's comfort in the world if you feel, 
It doesn't matter if it isn't real..." 

So I walk away from myself, walk into the way you want me to be 
I can't explain the sense of belonging I feel and it's oh so serene 
If I break the rules there's a price to pay, 
but you won't let them take me away 
You promise heaven, you promise all there is, 
you say we'll stand with god embraced in infinite bliss. 

I step alone into the fire, crucify my own desires, 
cause I'm nothing and you will make me see 
I will live by your own standards, cause I'm a fool 
if I abandon what you've programmed me to feel.

You rule the night, you rule the daylight, 
cause everyone who 'feels' shares the same mind 
You long for sorrow, you long for hate, 
just more victims for your cruel, wasted faith. 

...so don't open up your eyes, you might see it all like this. 
Don't you open up your mind, for you will see it like it is.
