A mindset so unreal 
The victory for your fears 
I'm so unwelcome here, 
A haven of mass-hysteria 
Is this broken? 
A wayward lie you live
Your life is broken 
You'd rather take than give 
And leave it open... 

The path you seize in all your wasted years 
Is so becoming darker now 
Your eyes grow wide with fear... 
The circumstance behind the chance you take 
To realise it never ends 
In ways you can't believe again.
.
You walked away from all you were 
In hopes of better days to come 
You walked away from all you were 
Now there's nowhere left to run. 

Your mindset so unreal, 
A victory for your peers 
I won't come closer, 
Now that I've realised 
Your life is broken. 
You continue to persist, 
"My life is broken." 
And now you've lost your chance 
To leave it open... 

You walked away from all you were 
In fear of bitter days to come 
You walked away from all you were 
In fear of better days to come.
