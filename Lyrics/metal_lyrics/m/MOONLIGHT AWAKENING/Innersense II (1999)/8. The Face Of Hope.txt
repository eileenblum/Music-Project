If you'd believe in me, i wouldn't fail to see 
the way we've swallowed time in this disturbing light 
face down in wicked sleep i'm hypnotized by dreams 
i look towards the sun, into a faint illusion 
from within the shadow burn, a face i cant discern 
it speaks to me of forthcoming, the dream abandoning 
assimilated to this world, so decadent and so absurd 
give to me your only hope, it's with this world i cannot cope 
you've only come to speak your mind, you speak to me of paradise 
if only i could see your face i'd open up and leave this place 
i want this sacred night, i want this paradise, 
i want a place to go, oh let me go back home...
