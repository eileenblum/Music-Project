Her back is turned against the crowd 
wondering if her thoughts are allowed 
she speaks in prayer and doesn't care 
that all her concerns drift like air 
i reach to her as she falls in shame 
for in all her faith she can't sustain 
so she looks at me with that hope in her eyes 
and wonders if god can hear her cries. 

Take me back to the time when I was younger 
Take me back to the time when I was stronger 
Take me back to a time when I could feel 
Take me back to the world I could believe in.

an old man steps out upon a ledge 
his sanity gone far beyond the edge 
he speaks of a heaven far away in the sky 
beyond what imagination could devise 
though he wanted to feel, he wasted every year 
chasing demons and angels and blinded by tears 
so he looks at me with that hope in his eyes 
and wonders if god can hear his lies. 

Take me back to the time when I was younger 
Take me back to the time when I was stronger 
Take me back to a time I could feel 
Take me back to the world I could believe in.
