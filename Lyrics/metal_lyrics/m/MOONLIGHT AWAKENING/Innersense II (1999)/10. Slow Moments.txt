The prisoners of untold guilt here, it is the state that i fear 
in the waves of simple distrust, it is the voice that i hear 
i can't surpass the dismal chances in a loveless romance 
so let it be and disguise laughter, yeah take your final stance. 

there's knowledge everywhere, never mind the stares 
look to me and be yourself naturally 
slow moments in the sands, we'll visit other lands 
take a chance and see yourself naturally 
oh can't you see we're hoping the doors will stay left open 
but i think with all this paranoia, minds will be frozen. 

charities are often frequent, they are the nails in your hand 
an empty voice, a hopeless martyr, into this hell we descend 
i sympathise with your condition, i know i spoke too soon 
but time is spent and i'm regretting the world you never knew.

there's knowledge everywhere, upon a cross of cold despair 
look to me and plead yourself naturally 
slow moments in the sands, we cannot take a stand 
take a chance and leave yourself naturally 
oh can't you see we're hoping the doors will stay left open 
but i know that time has passed and frozen. 

I know that I wanted you, I know that i needed you 
but now i must leave you here... 
i don't want to think of this, i don't want you think of you 
but i cannot help it now, my true thoughts are not allowed.
