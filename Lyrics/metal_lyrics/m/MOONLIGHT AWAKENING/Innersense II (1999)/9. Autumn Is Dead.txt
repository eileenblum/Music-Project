It's autumn everywhere, but no one seems to care 
and if you think about it, it might be fair 
they say the nightmare's real, they say i shouldn't feel 
cause all these things about you just as well could disappear. 

but here we are again, here we are alone 
and within this death there lays a hope 
here we are at last, here i am with you; 
i'm starting to think it's all too soon.

cause the way that i dont know you, and the way that i move slowly 
so the sky is turning darker, and my soul is drifting farther. 

i dont know what to do, i'm frightened by it too 
and all your words can't make it better 
i dont know what to say, i must say i'm afraid 
and all your words don't make it better. 

yet all the leaves that fall are dead, like the worries i once had 
and everytime i speak your name, i can't help feeling all this shame 
though all the things i said are true, i can't help drifting far from you 
i wish it could just stay the same, but so dies love when seasons change. 

i dont know what to say, dont know what to do 
cause everyone says i cant trust you 
i dont know what to feel, i know that it's unreal 
when all these things say i can't trust you. 

i dont know what to feel, i dont know what to fear 
i have no courage to speak of here 
and no one understands, no one really cares 
and i don't think it's ever fair.

and all the leaves that fall are dead, like the worries i once had 
and everytime i speak your name, i can't help feeling all this shame 
though all the things i said are true, i can't help drifting far from you
I wish it could just stay the same, but so dies love when seasons change.
