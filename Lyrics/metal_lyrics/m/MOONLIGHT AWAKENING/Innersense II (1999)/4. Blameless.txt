They stand and hope upon a thousand shores 
you'll change the way we see forevermore... 

persuade them all, you cannot let them be 
they must be sinners and they will never see 
it's your intent to take them to the stars 
i've only felt them die in my own heart 
but you're blameless, can't you see? 
yet you're blameless just like me... 

you think that cause i'm different, i must be wrong 
i must be brought to christ, i must belong... 
i want the chance to live my separate way 
but you will be relentless until the day you die 
and you're blameless, can't you see? 
yet you're blameless just like me...
