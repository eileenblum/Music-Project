Thereâs a house at the end of the road
Itâs been beaten down; itâs been empty for years,
But itâs still filled with thoughts of the people who have lived there
So just find another vice to occupy your precious little time
Youâll find a reason for everything, but I promise you Godâs not responsible

Whatâs it gonna be today? You know you canât make any of this last through tonight

The ghosts of those who left are here to stay
The happy ending is replaced by pain
Now youâre standing on the edge
Just waiting for Death to make his claim

Dip your feet into the water, and remember how it used to feel
If you could only get just one more taste, well then what?

This is all that you have left; this is all that youâll ever know
This is all that you have left, so why donât you just pull the plug
This is all that you have left; this is all that youâll ever know
This is all that you have left, so why donât you just pull the plug

The ghosts of those who left are here to stay
The happy ending is replaced by pain
Now youâre standing on the edge
Just waiting for Death to make his claim

Oh, what a tragedy; the lies have become reality
Youâve suspended your disbelief, and thereâs nothing left to see

Now the spotlight is on you, but the crowd has gone away
Rest your head in the dirt; Iâm sure it will keep you warm for tonight
