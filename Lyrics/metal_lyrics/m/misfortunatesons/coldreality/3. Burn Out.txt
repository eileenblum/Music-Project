And now it all comes out
Iâve faked a smile for far too long
Say youâve been living hard
But donât earn what you fucking own

Iâm losing touch
Iâm giving up now

You took your cup and you filled it with more than it could hold
Now itâs overflowed; itâs spilling onto every soul
But all your failures, theyâre always out of your control
Cursing everyone you know and asking them for more

Six years and counting (as it stands)
You canât catch a break
You broadcast your pain to the world
But it just donât change a thing

Donât know how we wound up here
I only hope itâs not too late
to see you dig your own grave

You said that no one understands
Gonna run away
Get as far as you fucking can
Then you fell to your knees,
Looked to the sky and said,

âDear God, where have you gone,
And everyone I never really knew?
Iâm losing touch
Iâm giving up on you.â

Our flame is burning out
Itâs fading fast, and I donât know if we will last
Iâm losing touch
Iâm giving up
