I canât keep all this in my head
Iâm dying trying to forget

Bury whatâs left of the truth that you
Carried all these years
It will never be like it was
So Iâm begging you just to stay here

The memory is all that I have left,
And Iâm just trying to be the better man

Itâs not the way that I want to see you,
But I am getting so used to that face
I swear it kills me every day

Oh, explain to me how this is not insanity

In the night, we lived under
A different light, and our hearts,
They would align and fall out again
As the sun came up, as the sun came up . . .

We have never been the same since then

Itâs not the way that I want to see you,
But I am getting so used to that face
I swear it kills me every day
I know Iâve fucked up. I know Iâve let down
Everyone who's put any faith in me
I just wish that I could see clearly

When we wake up in the morning,
We will find that we are different people
Than we were before
We cannot keep living this way

Bury me; we'll pretend to forget
Bury me; never speak of this

I canât keep all this in my head
Iâm dying trying to forget
