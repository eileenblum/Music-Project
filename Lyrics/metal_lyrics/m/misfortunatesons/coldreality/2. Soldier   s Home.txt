Nothingâs changed in all this time
The snow still falls like it always has
But everyone you know is moving on

You were only hero to few
The rest forgot as quickly as you left
And the ones that you love are already gone

The world has stolen everything you had
But you long to return

I . . . I am sorry
You gave up everything to keep us alive
