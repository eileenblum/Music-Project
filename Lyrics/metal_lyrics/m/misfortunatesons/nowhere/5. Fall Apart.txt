The words just wonât come out
Stifled and choked at every turn
Each morbid thought begets the next
Iâm certain they will drown
Before they ever reach the tip of my tongue
To breach the surface for air
So whatâs the point now?

I watched the life drain from your face
Color gone, black and white, the cold hard truth
Lost in a dream you were raised to believe
But Iâm just as lost as you

The more you talk, the less I have to say

Misery, retribution
Fall apart, just fall apart

There is nothing left here for us
But the emptiness inside our chests

The more you talk, the less I have to say
