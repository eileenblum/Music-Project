We sat and watched the tide
Reflecting what was left of the light
Reached out for something tangible
But it vanished from your sight

Burn, burn the ship, thereâs no comfort in it
Itâs only headed back to nowhere
All youâll find are the remnants of a shattered life
That youâd rather not remember

You gave yourself to them till you had nothing left
In return, they made promises as empty as the space in your chest
A chance to start over just to fuck it up again
