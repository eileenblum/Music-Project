Push it away, keep it out of your head
Thatâs what you told yourself over and over again
But the thought kept spreading
Like terminal cancer, you couldnât get over it

All you see
Is a perfect reflection of your imperfection
And a theme that keeps recurring (over again, over again)
Unavoidable failure thatâs endlessly pending your arrival

So you abandon what you know
Just turn away and go

Fear wonât leave you alone
