March on, march on
Just hold on to that liquid clock
Forget, Forget
Those things you said, it wonât be long
March on, march on
Just hold on to that liquid clock
Forget, Forget
Those things you said, it wonât be long

The sun falls to the sea
As it rises to each day
Same light, same dark, same in between
There is no other way

It was not your fault

March on, march on
Just hold on to that liquid clock
Forget, Forget
Those things you said, it wonât be long
March on, march on
Just hold on to that liquid clock
Forget, Forget

The darkness takes and takes away
You never understood
The good it carried with
All you saw was the death of another day

It was not your fault
