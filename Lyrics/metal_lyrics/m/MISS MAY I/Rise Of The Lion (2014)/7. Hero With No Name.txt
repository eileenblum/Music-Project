I'm on the front line
And I'm ready to go head to head
My life's signed away
Won't waste the script that I wrote in my own blood
There's a threat to my family
There's a threat to you and your own life

I'm not going anywhere until you're begging me
Begging me on your hands and knees

Can we survive through the changing times?
Can we survive with the world against us?
Show me a fight cause I'm ready to die
I hope you're ready for my annihilation

Can we survive through the changing times?
Can we survive with the world against us?
Show me a fight cause I'm ready to die
I hope you're ready for my annihilation

Can you smell the horror?
Taste the steel as you breathe it in
Feels like I have no home
That's the price you pay, a hero with no name

I'm on the front line
And I'm ready to go head to head
I'll pull the trigger
And I'll show you what I'm talking about

I'll pull the trigger
Show you what I'm talking about
A hero with no name

A hero with no name
I'm on the front line
And I'm ready to die

Can we survive through the changing times?
Can we survive with the world against us?
Show me a fight cause I'm ready to die
I hope you're ready for my annihilation

Can we survive through the changing times?
Can we survive with the world against us?
Show me a fight cause I'm ready to die
I hope you're ready for my annihilation

I'm ready to die
I'm ready to die
I'm ready to die
I'm ready to die

I'm ready to die
Hope you're ready for my annihilation
