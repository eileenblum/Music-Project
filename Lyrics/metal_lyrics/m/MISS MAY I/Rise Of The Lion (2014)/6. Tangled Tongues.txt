You have lives joined, on the terms, of stone. A separation of minds, now together in time. Facing your choices of long ago. They hunt you down like prey of their own. I want to know if love is real. If love is real I'm coming home. Can you hear me now? Can you hear me?
How can you hear me now? When the distance is deafening. This home is on the edge of collapse. Will the sound repeat?
Mother, Father, your son is a martyr. My Mother, My Father, I believed you had so much. Pulled apart behind slamming doors. I watch you leave, and become no more. Never thought I'd see the day. You turned your back and walked away. Facing your choices of long ago. They hunt you down like prey of their own. I want to know if love is real. If love is real I'm coming home. Can you hear me now? Can you hear me?
How can you hear me now? When the distance is deafening. This home is on the edge of collapse. Will the sound repeat?
Mother, Father, your son is a martyr. My Mother, My Father, I believed you had so much.
How can you hear me now? When the distance is deafening. This home is on the edge of collapse. will the sound repeat?
How can you hear me now? Our world is falling apart. My Mother, My Father, I believed you had so much.
