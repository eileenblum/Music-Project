All the saints, the sinners, and greats. Have always surrendered in their time of fate. I'll take my name and make history. Not being cowards they wanted for me. I'll retrace my steps. Find where I have fallen. Bury those trenches. Walking over with glory.
All the saints (all the saints), the sinners, and greats. Will be gone (gone). Gone one day.
I will not abide to the times. Refusing to look up to someone with power. My bones are comparable. But we are, covered in the storms. We live unbalanced. Covered in the shadows. Born to be fools. Adoring lost souls.
All the saints (all the saints), the sinners, and greats. Will be gone (gone). Gone one day.
