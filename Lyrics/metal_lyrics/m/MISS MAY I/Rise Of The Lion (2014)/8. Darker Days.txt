I have dreams that haunt me. Dreams that make reality seem like a plague. I can't block out my memory. My sorrow won't take back. Oh it won't take back these days. I could burn this world down. Sit back and watch it warm my tears. But all those ashes will always stick around. There is no way, to set a-blaze, all of my darker days. All of my darker days. All of my darker days. There is no way, to set ablaze, all of my darker days.
I will never leave it behind. When the nightmare is my past. This is my future. I am now walking on this glass.
I'm always walking on glass. Walking on this glass. Life could shatter underneath of me while I walk, on this glass so carefully. Falling to my death could only save me. From these nightmares, nightmares that made me. Nightmares that made me. Nightmares that made me. Falling to my death could only save me. From these nightmares, nightmares that made me. I will never leave it behind. When the nightmare is my past. This is my future. I am now walking on this glass.
I will never leave it behind. When the nightmare is my past. This is my future. I am now walking on this glass.
