I've spent too many days thinking of sorrow.
We've spent too many years planning for our tomorrow.

Where did it go?
The time spent with me.
When will I know?
Make this pain go away.

So what about me?
When you're gone.
How will I move on?
So what about me?
With this broken heart in so many pieces.

All that's gone now.
And I'm left with no road to take.
Just give me the way out.
Show me how to live this life again.

Where did it go?
The time spent with me.
When will I know?
Make this pain go away.

So what about me?
When you're gone.
How will I move on?
So what about me?
With this broken heart in so many pieces.
Where did it go?
The time spent with me.
When will I know?
Make this pain go away.
Where did it go (go)?
The time spent with me (with me).
When will I know (know)?
Make this pain go away.

So what about me?
When you're gone.
How will I move on?
So what about me?
With this broken heart in so many pieces.
So what about me?
When you're gone.
How will I move on?
So what about me?
With this broken heart in so many pieces.
Where did it go?
Broken heart, you've torn to pieces.
