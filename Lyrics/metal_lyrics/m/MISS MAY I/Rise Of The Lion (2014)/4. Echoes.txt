My world has come apart.
The bricks fall away (leaving only memories).
I walk with no hand.
No hand to hold so I'm losing (all control).
I know I know you're already gone.
You're never coming home.
I know I know you're already gone.
I face the nights (all alone).
We've spent our lives together for one another.
A single moment took it all away.
They said you had stopped breathing.
The man in black took you from me.
The birds they don't (sing anymore).
Would it even sound the same?
All I hear is (echoes), of what I remember from yesterday.
I know you're already gone.
You're never coming home.
I know you're already gone.
I face the nights all alone.
We've spent our lives together for one another.
A single moment took it all away.
They said you had stopped breathing.
The man in black took you from me.
We've spent our lives together for one another.
A single moment took it all away.
They said you had stopped breathing.
The man in black took you from me.
He took you from me.
