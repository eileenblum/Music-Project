Get me out. Yeah. I'm ready to get out of my head tonight. There's the door so come on come on come on. I want my past, my demons left behind. They're calling me back for all I am. My mind is aching, from all the raging. Voices telling me, stop, no one can hear you anymore.
In my head alone, free to dance with the demons. I'm losin' it, I'm losin' it. In my head alone, free to dance with the demons. I'm losin' it - I'm a lunatic.
I lost reality, lost control. Tangled up sanity is all I know. You have consumed me, planted your fucking plague. My body sick, of all this shit. Now all I am, a hollow man. Let me free. Get me out of my head tonight. Get me out. Yeah.
In my head alone, free to dance with the demons. I'm losin' it, I'm losin' it. In my head alone, free to dance with the demons. I'm losin' it - I'm a lunatic.
I'm a lunatic. Get me out. Get me out. Yeah.
