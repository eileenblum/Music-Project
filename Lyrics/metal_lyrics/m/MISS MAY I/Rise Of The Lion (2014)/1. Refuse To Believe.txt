Sometimes I wanna look in the mirror and know who I see
Sometimes I want to ask that ghost is this really me?

You try to rip this mask from this face you call your own
No one can see who you are
Rotting you down, rotting you down to your bones

It's not the time to feel alone
Shatter this mirror on your onw

[2x]
What if we refuse to believe?
We're nothing, we're nothing.
Sadness is a disease
We're searching for something

Sometimes I wanna look in the mirror and know who I see
Sometimes I want to ask that ghost is this really me?

My head has run dry, and my body feels flooded out
Well, there's no getting in if I can't find the key for myself

[2x]
What if we refuse to believe?
We're nothing, we're nothing.
Sadness is a disease
We're searching for something

It's not the time to feel alone
It's time to look in the mirror and know you're not a ghost
You're not a ghost

Sometimes I wanna look in the mirror and know who I see
Sometimes I want to ask that ghost is this really me?

[2x]
What if we refuse to believe?
We're nothing, we're nothing.
Sadness is a disease
We're searching for something

[3x]
I know who I am
