You want me. You want me. You want me and only me. Well alright. Well alright. Well alright let's go tonight. Let's go. Can't you see that you're starting a plague? I'll never get what you want from me. Take your sickness. I'll take my time. Keep burning bridges until the day that you die.
You wanted all of me. So I'll plan to take you there. Hold my hand here we go (tonight). I'm counting down the days. Feeling lost along the way. And I'm waiting on, waiting on my prayers.
One thing I always wanted was this life (was this life). Two hands blistered up, trying hard not to give a fuck. Three words I never heard from anyone (from anyone). Four years gone, still scrapping by just to get what I want. You want me and only me. Well alright, well alright. You want me and only me. Let's go tonight. Yeah. You want me and only me. Well alright, well alright. You want me and only me. Let's go tonight.
