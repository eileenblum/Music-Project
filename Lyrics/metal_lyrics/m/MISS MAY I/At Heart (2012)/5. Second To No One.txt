I haven't felt like I belonged in years.
She tried to comeback with all her sorry tears.
Can't believe that was my last chance for a new start.
There's no pity for the ones, for the ones that leave you in the dark.

Hey, hey, hey.
You are not alone (not alone).
Hey, hey, hey.
For we are not alone.

I've cried out for years.
I've cried out for years.
I've cried out for years.
I've cried out.

Oh what a world it is when everything's gone.
Motherless, fatherless.
I'd rather have a heart than feel this cold emptiness, like you, like you.

Oh what it is to have a heart in a world like this (world like this).

This is what it's like (what it's like),
being on my own (on my own).
Feeling like I've done no right (done no right),
No one can love you having no heart.

Where was the world when I cried out?
Where is the soul that you lost now?
When does it end?

Hey, hey, hey.
You are not alone (not alone).
Hey, hey, hey.
For we are not alone.

I've been the one in the crowd,
with no one here to stand by my side.
It's been like this for too damn long,
since the first day of my life.

Since the first day of my life,
since the first day of my life.

Where was the world when I cried out?

Hey, hey, hey.
Where was the world when I cried out?
