This is goodbye

I regret the time spent together
I can't digest all the life that I wasted
Holding on made me never want to hold another

You are just a part of my past
You are just a part of my past

This is an overdue goodbye
A farewell I must say
This is an overdue goodbye
This is end

This is a ballad of a broken man
This is goodbye
This is a ballad of a broken man
This is goodbye

This is goodbye

I spit these words down your throat
You will hear what I have to say
A mouthful I hope I hope you choke
You will hear what I have to say

There's nothing left in me (Left in me)
You sucked it out as you took me in
An empty worthless man
Is all you left in your way

You are just a part of my past
You are just a part of my past

This is an overdue goodbye
A farewell I must say
This is an overdue goodbye
This is end

This is a ballad of a broken man
This is goodbye
This is a ballad of a broken man
This is goodbye
This is a ballad of a broken man
This is a ballad of a broken man
This is goodbye
