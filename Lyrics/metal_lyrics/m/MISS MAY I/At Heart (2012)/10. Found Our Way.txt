We won't wait for the sun to set (We found our way)
On our dreams again (We found our way)
We won't wait for life to pass us by (We found our way)
It's time to live my friends

Here's no way to get back
A collision of direction
Got us here, it got us here

But where we are there is meaning
And what's life without a meaning

Ask yourself who you are?
(Who you are, who you are?)
Who is going to remember?

We won't wait for the sun to set (We found our way)
On our dreams again (We found our way)
We won't wait for life to pass us by (We found our way)
It's time to live my friends

Moments that will last forever
We had to lose ourselves to find our destiny
Home lost it's flame that we see
But this future, it burns so much brighter to me

We had to loose ourselves to find our way
We had to loose ourselves to find our way

We won't wait for the sun to set (We found our way)
On our dreams again (We found our way)
We won't wait for life to pass us by (We found our way)
It's time to live my friends
