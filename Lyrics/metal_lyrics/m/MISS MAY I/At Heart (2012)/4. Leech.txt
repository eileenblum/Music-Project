Parasite, remove your teeth from me.
Parasite, remove your teeth from me.

Always count on the ones that we're here from the beginning.
Not a waste that came from the gutters to grab onto what you are.

You're pathetic and not worth my time,
not even the breath I just took.
To tell everyone that you're dead to me.
Oh world you're dead to me.

You're so pitiful aren't you? You're dead to me.
You're so pitiful aren't you? You're dead to me.

When you think I need you most, I will stand on my own.
And when you think I need you most (need you most),
I will stand on my own.

How miserable it is to be you, you're so degrading.
How miserable it is to be you, you're so degrading.

You are known for taking (taking),
credit for what you never even done (even done).

You're such a parasite to me now.
I remember back when you used to be.
That's all gone now, just as gone as all my blood.
You pathetic worthless leech.

Parasite (parasite) remove your teeth from me.

You're so pitiful aren't you? You're dead to me.
You're so pitiful aren't you? You're dead to me.

Parasite (parasite) remove your teeth from me (from me).
Parasite, remove your teeth from me.
Parasite (parasite) remove your teeth from me (from me).

Parasite (parasite).
