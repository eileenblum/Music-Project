Hey Mister, where have you been?
I'll never get to live this life again.
I gave it all but you were never there,
I gave it all but did you ever really care?
I hope where you are is a home for you, 
because I never found mine while I was always looking for you.

Hey Mister, where have you been?
I'll never get to live this life again.

Hey, live it up!

Where are you this time?
You never showed, you'll never know,
How could you just let me go?
I'm all alone but you can't feel that,
Look at me now, now I've become,
become the man you'll never know.

This is the anthem for all you cowards.
This is the anthem for all you cowards.
Cowards!

Hey Mister, where have you been?
I'll never get to live this life again.
I just don't see it eye to eye anymore,
You were too much for me to ignore.
This search has been full of so many tears,
That flooded the future I saw discovering you.

Hey Mister, where have you been?
I'll never get to live this life again.

Hey, live it up!

Where are you this time?
You never showed, you'll never know,
How could you just let me go?
I'm all alone but you can't feel that,
Look at me now, now I've become,
become the man you'll never know.

This is what I got, 
I don't need you anymore.
This is what I got, 
I don't need you anymore.
This is what I got, 
I don't need you anymore.
This is what I got, 
I don't need you.
