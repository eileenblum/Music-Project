Fight, I will fight for this
I will fight for what I worked for
Carry, I can't carry your weight
Carry your weight anymore
Protect, I've protected the family
Now I will protect myself
Give, I have set you free
But what have you gave me

I can't see the point in living day by day (day by day)
Opportunities arranged for you to take (for you to take)
I can't see the point in living day by day (day by day)
Why must I carry you alone? You're killing me
(You're killing me)

Take, you have taken it all
Taken everything I am
Push, I've been pushed to the edge
I am never coming back
Break, the way you broke my trust
And now I will break free of you
Faith, there is no faith anymore
I have no faith in you

I can't see the point in living day by day (day by day)
Opportunities arranged for you to take (for you to take)
I can't see the point in living day by day (day by day)
Why must I carry you alone? You're killing me

I hope this makes you
I hope this makes you
I hope this makes you finally recognize

I hope this makes you finally recognize
I hope you see this through my shattered eyes (my shattered eyes)
I hope this makes you finally recognize
I hope you see this through my shattered eyes (my shattered eyes)

I can't see the point in living day by day (day by day)
Opportunities arranged for you to take (for you to take)
I can't see the point in living day by day (day by day)
Why must I carry you alone? You're killing me
(You're killing me)

You're killing me
