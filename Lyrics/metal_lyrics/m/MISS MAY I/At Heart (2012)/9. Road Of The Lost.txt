This road leads one way
Going everywhere but home
I hope I get off soon

Before I end up finding myself in hell
This road is going to find itself in hell

I'm gonna find myself
When will I find myself?

Am I still breathing
From mistakes I've made before?
'Cause if I know, I know, I know so well
Then why must crave more, more?

It seems I have lost my way
And misplaced my only morality
This battle is already lost
And I can't seem to justify the cost

I listened to everyone else but me
Now I will forever feel this pain
This is chaos I have chosen
And with chaos you can never find yourself
(Find yourself)

I don't feel like I'll find myself
I don't feel like I'll find myself
So next time I'll be sure to see you in hell

Am I still breathing
From mistakes I've made before?
'Cause if I know, I know, I know so well
Then why must crave more, more?

It seems I have lost my way
And misplaced my only mortality
This battle is already lost
And I can't seem to justify the cost
