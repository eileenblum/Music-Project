Oh
Opening wounds will never close again
Opening wounds will never close
Beaten and thrown to the ground
That's just another, just another day for me
Swimming in my own pool of red
That is what I always, what always seem to see

I won't lie on this ground much longer
I will stand higher than the ones who brought me down
This is winning the war
I couldn't care less, about your pathetic battle
I will stand on my own two feet
And wash away, the blood in my mouth
I will stand on my own two feet
And feel the way, I want to be

I'll always know, always know
Opening wounds will never close again
I'll always know, always know
Opening wounds will never close again
Opening wounds

Beaten and thrown to the ground
That's just the past, just the past for me
Swimming in my own pool of red
That is what I used to, what I used to see
Seeing life from the dirt is no way, no way to live
Seeing life from this place you put me in
Is no way, no way, no way to live

I will stand on my own two feet
And wash away, the blood in my mouth
I will stand on my own two feet
And feel the way, I want to be

I'll always know, always know
Opening wounds will never close again
I'll always know, always know
Opening wounds will never close again
Opening wounds will never close again

I'll always know, I'll always know
Opening wounds will never close again
I'll always know, I'll always know
Opening wounds will never close again
