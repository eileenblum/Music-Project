He turned to the other cheek
As he turned to leave
A harlot caught his eye
Over the queen he had
The queen by his side

Oh what a world it is
What a world

Oh what a siren can do to a man with open ears
A song sang in perfect pitch
All he needed was to hear what was in front of him
A song sang too many times

Faithful to my sins
Fracture of beliefs (of beliefs)
Tempted by the appeal (the appeal)
Of the danger I feel

Always remember
One night can break a man for eternity
One night can break a man for eternity

He turned to the other cheek
As he turned to leave
A harlot caught his eye

Her tears fell more for this than any other death
Broken betrayed and lied to like the rest
With a face red and worn, she looked into
The broken mirror, finding only a harlot

Faithful to my sins
Fracture of beliefs (of beliefs)
Tempted by the appeal (the appeal)
Of the danger I feel

He turned the other cheek
As he turned to leave
A harlot caught his eye
Over the queen he had
The queen by his side
