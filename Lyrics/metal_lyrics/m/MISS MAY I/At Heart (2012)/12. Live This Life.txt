This violence it makes me breathe deeper (Breathe deeper)
This confidence it makes me see more clearer
This is my life, a life of no regrets (No regrets)
It will have this sweet taste til the bitter end
Til the end

I realize I'm going to die the greatest death
For the inevitable fears only one and it's me
I will take this life beyond the horizon
I will take this life, take it to the grave
Take it to the grave

Oh I live this life (Live this life)
Live it til the end (Til the end)
Oh I live this life (Live this life)
Live it til the end (Til the end)

Take life to the grave

My heart beats faster than any has beat before
My blood boils hotter than the flame of the sun
Than the flame of the sun
It burns hotter than (it burns) the flame of the sun

I realize I'm going to die the greatest death
For the inevitable fears only one and it's me
I will take this life beyond the horizon
I will take this life, take it to the grave

Oh I live this life (Live this life)
Live it til the end (Til the end)
Oh I live this life (Live this life)
Live it til the end (Til the end)

Oh I live this life
Oh I will never die

Take life to the grave
Take life to the grave
Take life to the grave
Take life to the grave
