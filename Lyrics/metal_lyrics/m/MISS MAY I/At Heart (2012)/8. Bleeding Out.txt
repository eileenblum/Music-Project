Let it flow let it burn
Nothing's worth taking care of
If it's never going to scab over
You tore me down once before
But I won't be torn anymore

Mend all the parts (Mend all the parts)
Whether they need them there's always something wrong
With the world (With the world)
It all needs fixing and I'm the one left restoring

Let it flow, let it burn
All the time you spent to heal what is open
To get back what is rightfully yours
Oh let it flow, let it burn
(Let it burn)
Let it burn

Mend all the parts (Mend all the parts)
Whether they need them there's always something wrong
With the world (With the world)
It all needs fixing and I'm the one left restoring

These scars
These scars
These scars are never healing

Oh
These scars are worth bleeding out
'Cause these scars are never healing
These scars are worth bleeding out
'Cause these scars are never healing

Oh
Let it flow, let it burn

Mend all the parts (Mend all the parts)
Whether they need them there's always something wrong
With the world (With the world)
It all needs fixing and I'm the one left restoring
(Restoring)
It all needs fixing and I'm the one left restoring
(Restoring)
It all needs fixing and I'm the one left restoring
