We're running back and forth again over the center of this land*
When will this ever come to a stop?
How is this home our home?
We have abolished where we are.
We have forgotten where we're from.
Like a path that never ends we are lost.
I have finally found my way no matter when it will end.
This is all I've ever had.
Lets make them see.
We have already fallen.
Making who we are.
Finding our way.
We have to find our way.
Has made us blind.
I have finally found my way no matter when it will end.
This is all I've ever had.
Lets make them see.
All will become blind when they see what we have found in humanity.
Eye for an eye will mean nothing.
Now that we have seen it all the whole world would be blind.
This entire world will become invisible.
We have already fallen.
Making who we are.
Finding our way.
We have to find our way.
Has made us blind.
