[2011 re-issue track]No one knows
No one knows me
No one knows
No one knows me

Everything I've seen
And everything I've done

But into devastation
Known as I, the creator
This evolution
In dire of something greater

I am a soul in for death, in for death
I am a new will, never be forgotten

Carry on this way
Never faint, I can't abandon
Can't abandon this
I will provoke
All that stands in my way
Stand in my way

I will not believe in destiny (destiny, destiny)
I am a sum of the every choice I made (choice I made)

I will overcome this
And you won't overcome me
I will overcome this
And you won't overcome
Overcome me

Every turning point
Is a place that I follow
There is no place
No place in this world to call home

I am a soul in for death
I am a new will, never be forgot ten

This is my turning point
This is my turning point

I am a soul in for death
I will overcome

I will die for everything
Before I die for nothing

I will not believe in destiny (destiny, destiny)
I am a sum of the every choice I made (choice I made)

I will overcome this
And you won't overcome me
