How could you say you know who I am?
Do you even wonder why I'm here?
The thoughts play back in your head like a film that has been stick on repeat.
Imagine that this picture of me is painted for you.
A portrait is made to hold a moment and moments wish they could live.
Lets make this last become real life art.
Time won't catch us if we refuse to dry.
Changing as we settle into our canvas of eternity.
Hung on a wall that was built for you and I.
Here we are once again and we are the same.
You will see all of this and we will remain the same.
We are all artwork can't you see?
No one will see you like I do.
Why can't you believe?
No one will see you like I do.
We all are art if seen in my eyes.
Seen through the sky that magnifies beauty.
Open your eyes see that I see.
You will never go back to being blind and dull.
See what I see.
