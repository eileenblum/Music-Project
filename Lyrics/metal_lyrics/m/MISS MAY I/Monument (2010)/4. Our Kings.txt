Holding back from near consumption.
Starving to taste ourselves and the sensation of an existence.
A feast for only the ones who are kings.
The outcome of a revolution built to consume its own.
The outcome of a revolution built to consume itself.
This will contain what has already been said before.
The message enclosed will be the one we dread the most.
Coming generations will learn that our kinds were nothing but cannibals of their own race not strong enough to be men.
And then the young will rise they will tell them...
This will contain what has already been said before.
The message enclosed will be the one we dread the most.
And when the young will rise they will tell them all to go.
Go back to your Hell.
Holding back from near consumption.
Starving to taste ourselves and the sensation of an existence.
A feast for you the one they call a king.
