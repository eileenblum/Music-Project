Our reflections will always show.
We will grow.
We will be the world.
Gigantic proportions.
Magnitude beyond our expectations.
Just look at ourselves.
Developing at a pace never thought with surrendering past for present.
Time seems so important when you have the entire world waiting for you.
Call it achievements.
Call it what you want.
Behold ambition pulsing through our veins.
Our eyes will never shut.
The heart abandons sleep.
Ceasing to stop only builds us into.
Every step that we've taken made with you in mind.
A set of goals for ourselves we leave undefined.
The only destination that we know is to bring promise and meaning before hope is gone.
This force creates giants of nothing.
This force creates.
This force we all have everything that we will ever need.
In everyone this significants breathes.
To be exhaled for the world of feel.
A calling made by one and only one.
We are only here because of you.
Giants risen for you.
Refuse to be crippled by others around and becomes a colossus of your own.
OF this importance.
Inside we all are this size.
Our reflections will always show.
We will grow.
We will be the world.
Every step that we've taken made with you in mind.
A set of goals for ourselves we will leave undefined.
The only destination that we know is to bring promise and meaning before hope is gone.
We are the world.
