The sand surrounding my feet.
Drifting in the wind looking on the ocean as the waves roll by.
The same now as before over and over again
Meaning washed away with the hands of time.
Always the same [2x]
I miss the sight of the faces I know.
Their voices are the sounds that I cannot let go.
So far away that silence is all that I fear.
I hear them now the sound is so perfectly clear.
My thoughts everywhere but here distant from where I am.
The path I follow now I've already seen.
The same now as before over and over again.
Meaning washed away with the hands of time.
These will not become memories.
They will not be unfamiliar to me.
These will not become memories
Because they are everything to me.
Always the same.
I miss the sight of the faces I know.
Their voices are the sounds that I cannot let go.
So far away that silence is all that I fear.
I hear them now the sound is so perfectly clear.
