Is everything what you think it is?
How have we ever made it this far?
Oh why isn't this how its supposed to be?
Don't you feel like you'll never wake up?
Where am I?
Where is everyone in my life?
Isn't this supposed to be questioned?
Then why haven't you found the answers yet?
Where are the answers?
Is it not supposed to be like this?
Who had the nerve to you that?
Do you think they have seen you lately?
When will they find you?
Will you forgive them?
Died you ever think it would feel like this?
Should we wait for the rest of them?
Where am I?
Where is everyone in my life?
Isn't this supposed to be questioned?
Then why haven't you found the answers yet?
Where are the answers?
Can you find the answers?
Can you find me?
Did this help you?
Do you really know yourself?
May you listen again?
Is this really happening?
I think the answers in you?
