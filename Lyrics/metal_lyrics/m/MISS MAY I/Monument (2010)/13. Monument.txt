Carving into fresh stone as powder fills the air.
A brick taken from the earth to show mankind a meaning.
What has been missing for so many years.
Wait till all eyes are open.
This pedestal will change the world and will lead you to a new beginning.
This pedestal will change the world and will lead you in a new direction.
Pacifists try to settle without a war.
This is our war.
This is our answer.
This is our reply.
Our monument.
Our dreams will not die.
With every piece withered away knowledge will show beneath.
Blueish clouds arise through cracks billowing into the sky.Once seen by all kind it will bring absolute transition.
Gazed upon as this sits high above everyone.
This is our answer.
This is our reply.
Our monument.
Our dreams will not die.
Untouchable to all.
Behold our monument.
