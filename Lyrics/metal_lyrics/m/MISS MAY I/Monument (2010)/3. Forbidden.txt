[2011 re-issue track]Forbidden is a way I've never been taught
And I can never go back
Re-shapen from human struggle
Which you thought was futile (which you thought futile was)

I want everything outside of these walls
I want everything
I want everything

I have the bones of my dreams resting in my hands,
I lay them end to end (I lay them end to end)
I'll become a serpent and take my own path,
I will slither my way where I am forbidden

This door has been locked for way too long (way too long)
But still I'm hoping I will bring it down
I will bring it down (again and again)
I will rise on the other side changed by it

The secret has been building
While I was shut in
Shut in for way too, way too long

Temptation shown what it is to finally live
I have always wanted to live

I have the bones of my dreams resting in my hands,
I lay them end to end (I lay them end to end)
I'll become a serpent and take my own path,
I will slither my way where I am forbidden

This door has been locked for way too long (way too long)
But still I'm hoping I will bring it down
I will bring it down (again and again)
I will rise on the other side changed by it
