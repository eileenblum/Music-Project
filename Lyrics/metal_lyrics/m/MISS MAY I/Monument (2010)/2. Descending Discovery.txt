[2011 Re-issue Track]Go live by yourself.
You can't find which side to fall from.
A broken open scar.
No one can hear you.
No one can hear you when you celebrate.
Celebrate.

You will discover.
You will discover me.
I will show you.
I will show you.
No one needs to be.
No one needs to be.
You will discover me.

Is this what you wanted?
Is this where you wanted to find me?
Now I've finally opened your eyes.
Will you watch me fall from the open?
This is what it takes for you to see?
I can't believe.
I can't believe it came to this.

You will discover.
You will discover me.
I will show you.
I will show you.
No one needs to be.
No one needs to be.
You will discover.
You will discover me.

This is a [?]
[?]
Open your eyes.
Open your eyes.

You will discover me.
You will discover me.
You will discover me.
You will discover me.

I will remember.
I will remember what you made me see.
What you never saw.
You will never.
You will never forget seeing me fall like a giant [?]

You will discover.
You will discover me.
I will show you.
I will show you.
No one needs to be.
No one needs to be.
You will discover me.

Is this what you wanted?
Is this where you wanted to find me?
You will discover.
You will discover me.
I will show you.
I will show you.
No one needs to be.
No one needs to be.

Falling [?]
Come on.
I can't believe it came to this.
Come on.
