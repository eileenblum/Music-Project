Congratulations for making this world a stage
When the curtain falls our life will vanish in applause
Let this horrid scene be a one that last forever
Last forever
Triumph has it's many faces
There's only one that will decide
Triumph has it's many faces
There's only one that is divine
We can try and escape
This fate has us by the throat
I have never doubted death
Never doubted death
Look to the sky say your fucking prayers
Say your fucking prayers
Devour what you thought was right
A pathetic script written by our fathers
If only there was hope for our souls
We would be home again
And I've seen beyond these walls
Take me home
And I've seen beyond these walls
Take me home
I have opened my eyes (Beyond the dead)
And there's nothing left for me
I have opened my eyes (Beyond the dead)
And there's nothing left for me
So what if it's all a lie
Where will go from here
So what if it's all a lie
Where will go from here
Beyond the dead
Beyond the dead
