Follow paths paved with nothing
This ground is filled with the dead
The haste is brought with the force which it is made
Beyond all hope this is true

Shores expire over horizons
Shores expire over horizons

Waves bury our fathers and consume all that we have loved
Look into their eyes with the flawless feelings that you fake
Prepare for the tides of annihilation
Annihilation

Open your eyes, pen your eyes to what you
Have been breathing upon

Open your eyes shadows are all we have and they whisper lies (whisper)
Open your eyes shadows are all we have and they whisper lies (whisper lies)

Blood will be our only escape
These arms bring strength
Behold what we have
Blood will be our only escape
These arms will bring strength
