My sorrow
Here I am

Side by side with the pressure that stalks me
I walk through hell with this backbreaking heartache
Bleeding out all these close complications
Always the prey for your frustration

I suffocate, can barely breathe
I just can't walk away
I just can't walk away
A world of pain surrounding me
But I won't walk away
No I won't walk away

Buried deep no one can reach my sorrow, my sorrow
Baring all the blame no one can take my sorrow, my sorrow
My sorrow

Will I outlast the struggle of patience?
A ticking time bomb defusing with hatred
No recovery. No rejuvenation
I'm at a dead end but I can take it

I suffocate, can barely breathe
I just can't walk away
I just can't walk away
A world of pain surrounding me
But I won't walk away
No I won't walk away

Buried deep no one can reach my sorrow, my sorrow
Baring all the blame no one can take my sorrow, my sorrow
My sorrow

Buried deep no one can reach my sorrow, my sorrow
Baring all the blame no one can take my sorrow, my sorrow
My sorrow

My sorrow (my sorrow)
My sorrow, my sorrow, my sorrow
My sorrow, my sorrow, my sorrow
My sorrow
My sorrow, my sorrow, my sorrow
My sorrow, my sorrow, my sorrow
My sorrow, my sorrow, my sorrow
