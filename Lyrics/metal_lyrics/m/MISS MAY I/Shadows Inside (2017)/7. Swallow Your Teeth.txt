Every single night I wonder is this how it's supposed to be
You're stronger everyday when you take and take from me
(You're not a god, I'm not your slave)
You can try but I will not obey
(You're not a god, I'm not your slave)
Yeah you can try, but there's no controlling me
I've had enough. The shit you preach.
You talk too much. Swallow your teeth
Every single night I wonder is this how it's supposed to be
The rich are getting richer, the poor are made to break
Is there a choice? (Choice) Is there a way? (Way)
I won't be your prey
I won't be your prey
Is there a choice? Is there a way?
I'm making one today

I've had enough. The shit you preach.
You talk too much. Swallow your teeth.
With so much hate, you drown in shame, the angels cry but you won't change
You built your world on fear and pain, the snakes will surely sing your name.

Oh, depravity, we have all been following
Slight of every hand, tricked again you motherfucker
You motherfucker
We (we) won't (won't) be your prey

I've had enough. The shit you preach.
You talk too much. Swallow your teeth.
With so much hate, you drown in shame, the angels cry but you won't change
You built your world on fear and pain, now snakes will surely sing your name
now snakes will surely sing your name
The snakes will surely sing your name.
