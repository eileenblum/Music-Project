Say what you want, I've never sinned
Breathing in the world that you wish you could breathe
And I will wake, and I can say
There is another, a better part of me

Cut all you want, I'll never bleed
You'll never be my destruction
Crush every bone, they'll never break
You'll never be my destruction

I may be scared walking in fear
Feels like I'm calling out but nobody can hear
I've got a voice, a beating heart
I've got to live it and climb out of the dark

Cut all you want, I'll never bleed
You'll never be my destruction
Crush every bone, they'll never break
You'll never be my destruction

My destruction
My destruction, yeah
You'll never be my destruction

Cut all you want, I'll never bleed
You'll never be my destruction

Cut all you want, I'll never bleed
You'll never be my destruction
Crush every bone, they'll never break
You'll never be my destruction

Cut all you want, I'll never bleed
So fuck what they say
Crush every bone, they'll never break, yeah
Fuck what they say
