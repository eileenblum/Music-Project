I find it hard to see that I'm still here alive
A bitter taste of lessons you know I'll bite
Don't wanna go alone but no one's here tonight
Still I can't believe I'm on the other side

This won't be the end
Out of the dark, out of the dark
Death calls me her friend
She sings my name
This won't be the end
Out of the dark, out of the dark
Death calls me her friend

She follows close behind, we're standing hand-in-hand
Breathing down my spine, sure stings for all I am
Sleeping from her side I finally catch her eye
I look in my demise, it's all been in my mind

This won't be the end
Out of the dark, out of the dark
Death calls me her friend
She sings my name
This won't be the end
Out of the dark, out of the dark
Death calls me her friend
She sings my name
She sings my name

This won't be the end
Out of the dark, out of the dark
Death calls me her friend
She screams my name
This won't be the end
Out of the dark, out of the dark
Death calls me her friend
She screams my name
She screams my name
