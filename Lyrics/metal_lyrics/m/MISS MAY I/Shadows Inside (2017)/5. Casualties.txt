Lost our world is changing
Now torn apart
Lies no one's admitting
We are who we are

I will never reconnect
This will never be perfect
Like it was before
Like it was before

All I loved has spoiled
All I had decayed
When it all falls apart
Every moment's the same

In darkness we buried each other
Divided, refusing to break
The bombs fell but no one surrendered
In this war we're all casualties

Lost our world is changing
Now torn apart
Lies no one's admitting
We are who we are

All I loved has spoiled
All I had decayed
When it all falls apart
Every moment's the same

In darkness we buried each other
Dividing refusing to break
The bombs fell but no one surrendered
In this war we're all casualties

In darkness
We're all casualties
In darkness
We're all casualties

Lost our world is changing
Now torn apart
Lies no one's admitting
We are who we are
