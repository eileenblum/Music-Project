Taking back control
Are you taking me away?
I don't wanna go
But you never let me stay
Taking back control
Are you taking me away?
I don't wanna go
But you never let me stay

Fall asleep in worry
Drowning in my head
About the earth and wild
Slowly I forget
I wanna come back home
But I'm afraid that I stepped out alone
Should I be ashamed?
Maybe I'm to blame

Taking back control
Are you taking me away?
I don't wanna go
But you never let me stay (Never let me stay)
Taking back control
Are you taking me away? (Are you taking me?)
I don't wanna go
But you never let me stay (Never let me stay)

Barricades have crumbled
The effect with the dust
Safe and sound no longer
Nothing left to trust
I know I shut myself out
I know I'm in my way
Prisoner to my doubts
Can I be saved?

Taking back control
Are you taking me away? (Are you taking me?)
I don't wanna go
But you never let me stay (Never let me stay)
Taking back control
Are you taking me away? (Are you taking me?)
I don't wanna go
But you never let me stay (Never let me stay)

But I will, I will
But I will, I will

I know I shut myself out
I know I'm in my way
Prisoner to my doubts
Can I be saved?

Taking back control
You've been taking all control again

Taking back control
Are you taking me away? (Are you taking me?)
I don't wanna go
But you never let me stay (Never let me stay)
Taking back control
Are you taking me away? (Are you taking me?)
I don't wanna go
But you never let me stay (Never let me stay)
