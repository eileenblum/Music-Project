Knocked down
Undressed humanity drowning in resistance
Lights out
Signs of the enemy hiding in the distance

There's no time, nowhere to run
But someone's got to lose
It's your life, your chance to run
Or your chance to prove

Under fire I won't turn away
Through it all I will stand
I will carry on
I will carry on

Under fire
Under fire

Reckless
No more apologies
No more contradictions
Fury
Sealed with this sanity
Pulling through conviction

There's no time, nowhere to run
But someone's got to lose
It's my life, my time to stand
It's my time to prove to you

Under fire I won't turn away
Through it all I will stand
I will carry on
I will carry on

Under fire
I will fight for this
Under fire
Won't give in
Under fire
I will fight for this
Under fire
No I won't give in

Under fire I won't turn away
Through it all I will stand
I will carry on
I will fight for this
I will carry on
I will carry on
