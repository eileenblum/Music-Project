Did I erase my senses?
Did I erase who I've become?
I'm so ashamed and I hate it
It's obvious I've come undone
It's getting harder to fake it
I'm just a shell of what I know
I know you're scared and I hate it
Still you'd never let go

Over and over again she says

Don't crawl away
You're not alone, not alone
Don't crawl away from me
You swore you'd never
Let me go, let me go
So don't crawl away from me

I feel the same when I'm with you
I feel the same when I'm on the floor
I'm just a pattern repeating
A part of me closes every door
You bear the pain of holding on every single day
I may be down but I still hear you say

Don't crawl away
You're not alone, not alone
Don't crawl away from me
You swore you'd never
Let me go, let me go
So don't crawl away from me

I'm losing all touch in my mind and myself
Will I find another you to save me?
I'm losing all touch in my mind and myself
Will I find another you to save me now?

Yeah
You can't save me

All that's left then where I am
You are the rest of this broken man

Don't crawl away
You're not alone, not alone
Don't crawl away from me (There's so much left to say)
You swore you'd never
Let me go, let me go
So don't crawl away from me
Don't crawl away from me
