Iâm a two faced wreck, and youâre the only one to carry on this curse of myself
And manage to look me in the eyes
When I lie, when I tear out the heart I fought to take
Youâve bled out so many times in the crossfire of my mind
I try, then I lose control
Youâre all I have to bring me back to life when I let go of all I am
You set me free when my mind strangles me

You overpower the voices in my head
Youâre deafening my demons
I hear your whispers, thatâs all that I need

Raised as a broken piece of shit, lost in the world
You discovered me
You handled my insanity

Iâm not worthy of such beauty
Iâm not worthy of a love like this

Thereâs constantly a struggle in myself
Judgment will forever deceive me
How does someone exist like yourself?
How can anyone take on who I am?
A two faced curse of insanity, a psychotic romantic

Bring me back to life when I let go of all I am
You set me free when my mind strangles me
You overpower the voices in my head
Youâre deafening my demons
I hear your whispers, thatâs all I need

Iâm not worthy of such beauty
Iâm not worthy of a love like this
Iâm not worthy
Iâm not worthy
