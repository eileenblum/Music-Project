To who I was, to who I was,
Iâm not running from the past,
Iâm running from what I am afraid Iâll become.
A life born from nothing with no one here to guide me
Thrown to the wolves, drained from what I could be.

This will no longer be my demise,
Iâve left that life, now I feel alive.

I have to keep running and running from where I came from,
Yesterday keeps burning and burning me down to who I was.

I stand alone, I stand on my own
and filled with the passion to conquer and be
Buried by you and forgotten by them.
I escaped torn up, I escaped your love.
No more dishonor, no more failure.

I have to keep running and running from where I came from.
Yesterday keeps burning and burning me down to who I was.
To who I was...

To who I was, this will no longer be my demise.
Iâve left that life now I feel alive.

I have to keep running and running from where I came from,
Yesterday keeps burning and burning me down to who I was.
