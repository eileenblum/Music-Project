Who are you to think you can imitate foolishness
for the world when youâre handed the crown,
dishing out lies to an open crowd.
With every word you speak, they follow with altered conception,
pursuing you as a power of some sort
from within you have no direction.

Masses choke on the scripts you have been force feeding them.
When thereâs nothing left to lay them to rest, theyâre driven to the end.

The artificial backed by an army of apathy, basking in glory.
Stories theyâre forcing down the throats of those who believe,
with lies theyâre preaching.

You have no face in my eyes, no true light to show anyone
I hope they see what I see, just a dark and empty fake.
Dark and empty fake,
Dark and empty fake.

Constructing empires of lies that will crumble in time
Fate will come to bury you whole once you lose control.

The artificial backed by an army of apathy, basking in glory.
Stories theyâre forcing down the throats of those who believe,
with lies theyâre preaching.

When they find the key that will unlock your identity,
no one will follow or live in your shadow now.

I hope they see what I see, just a dark and empty fake
