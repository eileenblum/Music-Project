I always trust my heart and never hope to die
Trust my heart and never hope to die

Followed an empty road
Without any direction of where I should go
All I can say is that Iâve made it too far to wish for the end

Iâve come too far just to let this go
No plan in my head, my heart is all I know
One day at a time until I find my pace
My dreams will never die, they are all I see

No turning back, even when itâs the only direction
Thereâs a lionâs will inside of me beating harder, inspiring
When the flatline comes, I have to be the one who will carry
Myself though the trials of life, finding no surrender in sight

Thereâs no surrender in sight
No surrender in sight
No surrender

I will trust my heart and I will never hope to die

Iâve come too far just to let this go
No plan in my head, my heart is all I know
One day at a time until I find my pace
My dreams will never die, they are all I see

They are all I see
My dreams will never die
They are all I see
They are all I see
Thereâs no surrender in sight
There's no surrender
