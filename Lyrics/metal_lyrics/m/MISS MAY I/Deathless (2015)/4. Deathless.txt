I fucking gave everything, put myself in a place I shouldnât be
Took a chance trying to acquire something I cannot see
Stranded myself at a point I canât escape
Bring me back now to the surface so I can feel at ease

Exhausted from all my attempts
Of being more and always seen as less
Write me off this list of disasters, I am over being mortified
Let me reach the summit to look down at my wasted life
All I desire is a hint of serenity
After all the passion you have taken from me

You think you can take all that Iâve made?
Remember itâs another part of me
I will save another day to follow the dreams that will set me free

You never looked back at my sacrifice
You never felt everything I lost
I fucking gave everything, emptied out all of myself

Everything, threw away the heart I had
Everything, my failures filling up my lungs
Everything, Iâm drowning on my way down

Denial in giving up on all I had after losing your trust
I had faith when this started. You destroyed all of my hope
Through these trials I rise and Iâll take back what is mine
You think you can take all that Iâve made?

You think you can take all that Iâve made?
Remember itâs another part of me
I will save another day to follow the dreams that will set me free
To follow the dreams that will set me free
