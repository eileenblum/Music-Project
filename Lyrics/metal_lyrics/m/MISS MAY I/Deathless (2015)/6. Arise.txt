I will arise!
Rise! Rise! Rise!
I will arise!

Show me who you really are.
Show me that youâre not someone
who would cast out their young
and leave them behind
And Iâll try, Iâll try to be reasoning.
Iâll try to forget you abandoned me
On the shallow shores Iâm tied to the ocean floor
for the current to take me away.

You want to say youâre wrong and now itâs just too late.
You tried to leave me behind, stranded in the tide.
You want to say youâre wrong and now itâs just too late.
You canât call me your own I wonât be disowned.

I must arise, pulling myself through the tide.

I will arise!

You thought you left me there to die,
but I made it through the tide.
Rise! Rise! Rise!
Made it through the tide.
Rise! Rise! Rise!

Iâm not drowning, youâre just broken.
I can mend you and forgive this moment.

You want to say youâre wrong and now itâs just too late.
You tried to leave me behind, stranded in the tide.
You want to say youâre wrong and now itâs just too late.
You canât call me your own, you wanted me gone.

I will carry myself alone again,
from where you left me to sink or swim.
Thereâs no making this right.
Whatâs done is done.
You want to say youâre wrong.
How could you call me your son?
I saw the waves trying to pull me in.
I broke the tide.
I will arise!
Rise! Rise! Rise!
I will arise!
Rise! Rise! Rise!
I will arise!
