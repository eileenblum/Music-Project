Turn back the time!

Turn back the time
Let me try this again
Watch me crawl out of the hell Iâm in.

Iâm not the man that I thought Iâd be
My mind has not become my reality.

Side swiped in all directions by everything I try
The mangled wreck inside me is all thatâs left behind.

In another world, in another time,
I will take back what is mine.
Rewind all Iâve done, rewind my mistakes
away from everything Iâve come to be.

Through the suffering, I take another chance
Reliving everything Iâve done inside my head
Until I reclaim who I am.

Turn back the time
Let me try this again
Watch me crawl out of the hell Iâm in.

I can make it out, I can make it out.

Let me out of this hell Iâm in
Let me out of this hell Iâm in
Just let me out of this hell Iâm in
Just let me out of this hell Iâm in.

Iâm reliving everything Iâve done inside my head
Iâm reliving everything Iâve done inside my head
Iâm reliving everything Iâve done.

Through the suffering, I take another chance.
Reliving everything Iâve done inside my head
until I reclaim who I am.

Turn back the time!
Turn back the time!
Turn back the time!
Turn back the time!
Turn back the time!
Yeah!
