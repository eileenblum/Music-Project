This is a breath that I have to take
Feel my lungs ignite, letting you know who I really am
&amp; whatâs on my mind

Never did I think it would come to this
Building in my head, I'm sick &amp; tired of being pushed around
But right fucking now
I hate everything
I hate everyone

My thoughts are fading in
&amp; the weight is pushing me down
Deeper in my grave
But I cannot escape if I'm already underground
Beneath the agony

In a wake I try to breathe, drowning in my dreams
The more I take of your shit, the more I sink

Itâs all a ruthless puzzle, missing one last piece
Boiling up lividity as I finally break

Iâm sick of it all burying me
Take the weight &amp; let it out
Dying inside to find my life
I suffocate &amp; burn alive

I hate everything
I hate everyone
[2x]

My thoughts are fading in
&amp; the weight is pushing me down deeper in my grave
But I cannot escape if I'm already underground
Beneath the agony
I hate everything
