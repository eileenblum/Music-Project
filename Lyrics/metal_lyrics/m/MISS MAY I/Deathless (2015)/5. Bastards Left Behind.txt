Weâre your bastards left behind
Weâre your bastards left behind

Weâre your bastards left behind
Thrown away beneath the darkest sky
Weâre the fallen, born to rise
A part of you left alone to die

Dealt to you in a winning hand of fortune
Weâre cast out filth in your own distortion
A ghost to you, but alive to anyone
(All of this cannot be undone)
Donât tell me youâve done this right
You are nothing but a waste of life

Weâre your bastards left behind
Thrown away beneath the darkest sky
Weâre the fallen, born to rise
A part of you left alone to die

We are the dust on the dashboard
We are the guilt you refuse to speak
We are the faces that pass you by
We are all the ones you left behind
Forgotten
Forgotten

Take these days weâve lived
Burn them into your arms
Feel the past you missed
Let it haunt your scars
Remember where we came from, how it looked that day
Now that weâre in decent, make these memories start to fade

Weâre your bastards left behind
Thrown away beneath the darkest sky
Weâre the fallen, born to rise
A part of you left alone to die
