Hopelessly lost in our hell, we fight for our bottomless grave
Disgraced by you, we are left in these darker days.

Oh, we can never deliver what we set to pursue
Captive to our own fate entombed in ourselves.

Thereâs no more distance to reach
Horizons are dead in our dreams
Youâve blocked out the light, blinded our aspirations.

With empty promises, the trust I hold tight fades to memories
You always let me down
You said that you knew the way, always let me down
Always let me down.

We held onto what we knew, corrupted in all we believed.
You drew us into your own design, leaving us with nothing left
but nightmares alone in the dark, strangled to what was desired.

With empty promises, the trust I hold tight fades to memories.
You always let me down
You said that you knew the way, always let me down
Always let me down.

I followed the steps you have given me, leading me to nowhere with nothing
A player in your game of misfortune, a pawn to your throne
You always let me down.

With empty promises, the trust I hold tight fades to memories.
You always let me down
You said that you knew the way, always let me down
You always let me down.
