I wish I was alive
Born into something that's clearly unknown
Could this be what we have always wanted?
The pulse is overcoming our bodies
Try to take this now
My unbreakable heart
Futures are never meant to be planned
A life will never be a fate
Your eyes can only see so far
Just know this won't last forever
Can we make it through this time?
When everything hold us back
Can we make it through this time?
I'll the same when everything comes crashing down
These hands will never be cleansed
You can't take this back
You wish you were alive
