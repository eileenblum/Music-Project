Wanted
For my time spent
Searching for the world.
I receive all I ever dream for,
In return all is taken away
Remember everything before tonight.
I remember everything before tonight.
These illusions that life is so clear
Have been cleansed from my thoughts.
Floating branches are the only things
Truly connected to the ground
Take me back to how it used to be
I'll never close my eyes again
How could I ever forget a place like this?
Somewhere that I can call my own
My eyes will never see where I'm suppose to be.
Take me back to how it used to be
I'll never close my eyes again
How could I ever forget a place like this?
Somewhere that I can call my own.
This is satisfaction
In it's most
Beautiful state.
Beautiful state...
Surrounding me
Is everything
That is true,
Just let this be true,
Let this be...
I won't forget this place
I won't forget, this is my own
I won't forget, open my eyes
I won't forget.
I won't forget.
