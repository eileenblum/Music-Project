Through this
I've been forced to find myself again
A half-man, blinded and alone
Torn in two from the center line
Jagged wounds leave jagged scars over time
This is how I'm being left to die
I'm nothing again
I'm taking you with me next time
What have you done
What have we done
I'm never coming back
