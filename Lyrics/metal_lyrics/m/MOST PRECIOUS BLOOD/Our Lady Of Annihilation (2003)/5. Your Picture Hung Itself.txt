Put on flesh and run it through
The things you love, they will destroy you
When the seasons change, my scars burn
Another day of I'll never learn

Those words took you but seconds to say
Forever more and since that day
They will replay

I cease to resist your sweet lips
I cease to exist
Your arsenic kiss

The more time passes by
The more I realize you and I
Were just a lie

So many years believing
Belief turned to hope
Hope changed to doubt
That became bitterness
Which to this day
Turns me inside out

Those words took you but seconds to say
Forever more and since that day
They will replay

I cease to resist your sweet lips
I cease to exist
Your arsenic kiss

The more time passes by
The more I realize you and I
Were just a lie
