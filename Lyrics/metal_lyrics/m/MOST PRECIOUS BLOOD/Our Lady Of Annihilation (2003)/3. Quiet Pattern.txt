I need another
I need at least one more
Nothing stops it when it comes
These many thoughts reduced to one
There's something dangerous in mind
Nothing stops it when it comes
then I can't shake you off of me
clutching so tight that I bleed
You have something I need
I need I need I need I need
I need I need I need I need
I need to believe this one thing
Push inside, mine forever
