Put my body in the hole, in the ground
Underneath, there's no sound
Burn all that I've written
And every likeness of me
When it's done and I'm pulled
Down from the hanging tree

If this if your love, save your love

Hissing whispers on my eyes
Hide the truth, the look belies
By the neck guide me in
Whispers and a sawtooth grin
In whispers and secrecy
My enemies conspired
Fifty-thousand volts through
A thread of copper wire

If this is your love, save your love
