Sleepless nights on the hardwood floors
The sweet lullaby of slamming doors
We spend our time watching
Raindrops race up windshields
We spend our time waiting in line
Only to die

If only I could sit down
With you one more time

Tell me the story that never ends
Play me the record that never ends

If only I could sit down
With you one more time

I wouldn't wish this misery
On my worst enemy
Hangrene hearts unite tonight
