Let go
Test the limits of desire
Let go
Penetrate to play with fire
Faceless names in nameless places
Of hope we only find traces
Fuck your addiction
You're not the only one it's killing
Black ink failed
Dry well
Well dry
Will try
Will try not to fail
I know how this will end
Every scar has a story
No guts, no glory
