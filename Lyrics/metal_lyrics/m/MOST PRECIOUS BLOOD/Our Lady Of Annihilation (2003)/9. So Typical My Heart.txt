so typical my heart
and here i am again
in envy of your will to leave me behind
we watched the city fall - it couldn't save our love
the death of my trust, eclipsed by tragedy
no need to cut me open,
i died of a broken heart,
ashen grey and cold,
my mirror turned to stone
as your footsteps fade - await the final wave,
too caught up in my game i watched you walk away
tragedy won't distract your heart
