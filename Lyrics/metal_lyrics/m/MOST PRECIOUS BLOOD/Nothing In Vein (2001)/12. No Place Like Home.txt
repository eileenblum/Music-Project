Bound by inability and let suffer the absence. Words have failed me once 
again. Attempts at completion have again left me empty. Fate's design has 
forced me to live without. And when I close my eyes I envision one so 
undeserving of your presence, one who does not appreciate you as I, one who 
needs not struggle with your absence
