This a monument to failure (victims) of our own design I submit to your cold 
heart With arson as closure Sifting through the rubble The burning pile of 
ash Drawn into the flame Can't seem to turn away "Love and you will be 
loved", "Trust, you will be trusted" I can set a watch to your change of 
heart Sifting through the rubble The burning pile of ash Drawn into the 
flame Can't seem to turn away Ground these ashes into your palm these are 
your memories Carve these words into my arm these are my memories Ground 
these ashes into your palm - can't resist the siren song Carve these word 
into my arm - can't resist the siren song Sifting through the rubble The 
burning pile of ash Drawn into the flame Can't seem to turn away To 
breathe... To burn I swallowed the truth like razors Can't resist the Siren 
Song
