You always knew just how to bury your sins beneath my skin i am the fevered 
words you wished you'd never said i am the saddest song that haunts you in 
your sleep i am the thought that wakes you from your sweetest dreams Tonight 
I'll walk these halls Studying the cracks in the walls To die internally To 
die eternally The death of all that i dreamed shaken from your sweetest 
dream From deaths grasp i shall rise and will rise one last time when the 
tears top the laughter its time to go home and here i am the greatest lie 
you ever told i am the incision that leaves behind the deepest scar i am 
your heart when your head says walk away No one dies no dies alone i'll send 
this chill straight through your bones i am not anyone you know ghost from 
your past here to seize your soul
