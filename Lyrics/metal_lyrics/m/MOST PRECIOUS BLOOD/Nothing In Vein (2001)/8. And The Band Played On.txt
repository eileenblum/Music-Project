Anywhere but here Anytime but now Anyone but you I don't want to make 
assumptions but if I have to then I will You never really cared You were 
never really there What it once meant Still means a lot to me With or 
without you I still dare to breathe And after the fall Somehow above it all 
But I still dare to breathe The more things change The more I stay the same 
As the world unravels I remain ..And the band played on... I remain
