you've watched me die For the final time This bloodsoaked eulogy that at 
last is mine But ive thought this through as I waited for you To carry me 
home in your lifeless arms Wait for sleep to grant me This serenity I seek 
Solace can only be found In everlasting sleep How can I fear death? I'll 
never feel it I want to die before you I want to die for you But I'll never 
feel it Tonight the circle closes indefinitely Burn my cold heart in effigy, 
empty my pockes for the thieves Life has run me through, as I waited for you 
To carry me home in your lifeless arms Burn my heart in effigy
