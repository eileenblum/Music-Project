This sin in my heart will tear us apart Theres sin in my heart Love will 
tear us apart Happiness is solitude When theres no one left to depend on I 
walked a thousand miles through your lies And so will you, so will you? Kill 
me Tell me Everything falls apart Kill me Tell me Try and break this cold 
heart Kill me Tell me You thought it would never end Kill me Tell me When we 
meet again
