Forever waiting for you to let me down. Reaching for heaven, to fall to the 
ground. Heroes and Conspiracies. Just like a rose ripped from its root. 
You're so beautiful and waiting to die. Heroes and Conspiracies. Would you 
grant me one final kiss? Impaled on the sharpest thorn, these are my wrists. 
Here we are, Face to face. Without a clue of what to say. Alone at last no 
questions asked. Another secret to my game. Now that it's gone was it ever 
that at all?
