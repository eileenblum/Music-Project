And I, I search for something more Before it mattered who you knew And I, I 
search for something pure Before the knot became the noose Theres no 
disguise behind these eyes I'm still alive watching you die And as I slowly 
walk away I hear you say - I never change. And I , I always hoped for more 
Before this knot came loose And now I seek out something pure Before the 
knot became the noose In the rearview mirror before the knot became noose 
Horizon of burning bridges before the knot became noose The knot became the 
noose
