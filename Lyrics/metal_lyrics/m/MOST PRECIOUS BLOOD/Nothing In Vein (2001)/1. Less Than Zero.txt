This moment is all that I own Tonight I shut my eyes with you on my mind 
Attempts in vain to forget that you left me to die But I've grown tired of 
collecting myself from the ground At your mercy, lost and never found Burn 
my fingertips so no one knows my name The wait could crush my heart one last 
wish in vain Its colder than it looks outside Ive watched this world pass by 
my tired eyes Accept this as my farewell note To this world, to this city 
and to you This time I want it to kill Cannot bear it again This is all I 
own This unmailed letter, this dead embrace This fleeting moment all that I 
own So curse this instinct, this hollow hope This boundless desire that's 
left me here
