Rest easy foes for tonight my eyes will close I always held my tongue 
assuming tomorrow would always come But another day has passed, I still cant 
see the end What wrong turn, led me to his end? Woke up, quenching razors 
again These faces are not my friend Dodging trains in my sleep Days as long 
as years, beyond belief The authors of the prophecies are dead and gone The 
authors of your epitaph have just been born Your deathbed is not a wishing 
well
