The bloodiest will loathe the cleanest.
Like scavengers with desparate, wild eyes, the abused becomes the meanest.
Of all the starving, I am the leanest.
Remember me - remember me to no one.
Cut out - cut out my restless tongue.
The disastrous compulsions which lead me to this embrace like a plague, like a viper's kiss.
Cut out my tongue to stop the screaming.
Its human nature to keep on dreaming.
Magnifying just to see less.
Sewn together until seamless.
Every one of us will be this: drugged and fucked until dreamless.
Remember me - remember me to no one.
Cut out - cut out my restless tongue.
The disastrous compulsions which lead me to this embrace like a plague, like a viper's kiss.
Rest your ugly head and sleep now.
Sleep now.
Life will change.
Keep dreaming.
Life will change.
Keep dreaming.
