Thousands of years of illusory days of deceit.
Hollow eyes of simple minds flattening their feet.
Atrophied minds, easy survival.
No wants, no needs.
Their hands on their Bible.
Work for the worn, safe place for teh sane.
A place for lies unveiled, mistakes made plain.
I wait while the world wakes.
Find a home for my hands.
Desperation holding hands with tragedy.
Lost time colluding with lunacy.
Take the holy out of war and what's left to fight for?
