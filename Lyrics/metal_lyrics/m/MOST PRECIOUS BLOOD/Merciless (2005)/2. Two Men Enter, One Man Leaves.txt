This is a call to arms for every human who still has a shred of life left in them.
If they want what we have, let's see them try - come and take it - try to take it.
You won't take us.
We don't die.
For teh lives of those who think and feel,
for all who still try,
for those who touch nothing they cannot steal - hope is the last to die.
With promises and poison they try to fill us.
It will take more than everything they have to kill us.
Make the first shot the best you've got.
Miss and live to tell? I think not.
For the lives of those who think and feel,
for all of us who still try - on the soil of this battlefield, hope is the last to die.
