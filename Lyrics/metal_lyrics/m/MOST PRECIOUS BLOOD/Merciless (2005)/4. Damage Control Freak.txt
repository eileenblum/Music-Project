Do you believe in hell below?
Do you fear a God above?
Soul searching on dead end streets.
You can shove your fucking love.
No actions without consequence.
Nothing said makes any sense.
Fuck what you've done.
Take what you want and fucking run.
Life her is war.
What do you fight for?
Are you alive?
What gives you good reason to survive?
Are we alive or are we all just waiting to die?
On these crowded streets I'm completely alone.
Awake in flames in this disfigured city I call home.
Watch time elapse.
Watch the world collapse.
Life her is war.
What do you fight for?
Are you alive?
What gives you good reason to survive?
Are we alive or all just waiting to die?
Life here is war.
