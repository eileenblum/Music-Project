I was on the ground for years.
The ugly truth carved out of fear.
Always looking for more to steal.
Full-color nightmares becoming real.
This pack of wolves is haunting me.
Unrelenting, unwelcome memory.
Light feet an dsharp teeth are tracking me.
Follow the scent of tragedy.
In packs they gather.
With fake smiles they greet.
They, the hunters.
I, their meat.
