I am my father's son.
A mile-wide mean streak through me runs.
What I deserve, what's lived gets learned.
Connections cut, loyalties turned.
Born to destroy.
My knives are praying in delirious thirst.
In cancer city I am the cursed,
I'm at my best when things are worst.
The sharpest tongues cut their own throats first.
Born to destroy.
