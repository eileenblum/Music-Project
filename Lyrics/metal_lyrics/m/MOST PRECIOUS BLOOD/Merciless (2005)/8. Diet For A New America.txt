No death songs are sung.
No hesitation to devour the young.
Take what isn't needed - leave the rest.
Bleed until there's nothing left.
Bred and caught.
Sold and bought.
No thought to what human hands had wrought.
Every day, a hundred thousand slaves.
Every hour, a thousand graves.
Hear the chorus of the calloused drown the sounds of endless malice.
Now the sane must decide when to answer the call to defend.
A practice of cannibalistic insanity.
Sadistic neanderthalic barbarity.
Bred and caught.
Sold and bought.
No though tto what human hands had wrought.
Every day, a hundred thousand slaves.
Every hour, a thousand graves.
No escape, no relief from suffering beyond belief.
