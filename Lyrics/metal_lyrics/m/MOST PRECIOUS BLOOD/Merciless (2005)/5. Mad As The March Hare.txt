Lock me in a room, throw away the room.
There's nothing left.
Growing fears.
Sleep for years.
Wake in tears.
I'm on the edge.
I'm on the fucking edge.
I swear to you.
Make one move.
Give me one excuse, I dare you.
These words are ammunition.
This voice is a gun.
Not one of you is safe.
Fuck you all.
Turn and run.
I've learned my lesson.
Life is barren and bereft.
Deaccession until there's nothing left.
Putting you away or putting you to rest.
Denial or death, which one is best?
So much for trying.
So what, you're dying.
Better you than me.
Boiling contempt.
Singe and sear.
No escape from here.
I'm on the edge.
I'm on teh fucking edge.
I swear to you.
Make one move.
Give me one excuse.
I dare you.
These words are ammunition.
This voice is a gun.
Not one of you is safe.
Fuck you all.
Turn and run.
