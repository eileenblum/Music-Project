May it rain on you forever.
We are all alone together.
Crippled by selective memory.
Choose which lie to believe.
One man heartstring tug-of-war.
The more I love the more you leave.
I hate you with all my heart.
Counting on the law of threes.
Fool me once, shame on you.
Fool me twice, shame on me.
There's something not right that can't be made right.
Everything in focus now.
Gag and vomit at the sight.
It seems you've forgotten about the gifts I had to give.
If this is the case, perhaps I'll forget to forgive.
I hate you with all my heart.
Counting on the law of threes.
Fool me once, shame on you.
Fool me twice, shame on me.
