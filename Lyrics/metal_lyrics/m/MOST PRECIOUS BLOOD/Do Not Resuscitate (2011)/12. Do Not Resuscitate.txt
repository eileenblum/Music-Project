My eyes deceive me. It seems the only explanation for this. What of the spirit we loved and the heart no one seems to miss? Surrounded by the deluded with no sense of reality, ever singing too loudly of their fucking soundscan fantasy. Tear open the shirt and read it true: we'd rather be underground than surrounded by you. Today is our day to die. Tonight, leave us where we lie. There's a place in the lights for those who ambitiously pimp their name and those who sell facades of themselves for the ephemeral fame. If you're counting on seeing us there, without a doubt you idiots can count on the fact that you can count us out. Tear open the shirt and read it true: we'd rather be underground than surrounded by you. Today is our day to die. Tonight, leave us where we lie. Now let us wish you goodnight and goodbye.
