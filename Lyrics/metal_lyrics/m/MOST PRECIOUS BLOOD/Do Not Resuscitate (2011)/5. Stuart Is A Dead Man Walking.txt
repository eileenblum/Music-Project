Adopt the will of the masochist. To live without, true love un-missed. A selfish heart incurring debt: today's gift, tomorrow's regret. Now you're just a moving target with not much longer to live. Your worst nightmare is coming. Keep your door locked. I know where you live. I'll warm my hands to the fire I set to your house with you still inside. May I be granted this one wish: that you wake in time to feel yourself die. The bot swallowed it all, hook, line and semen. No ties were easier severed. Now I carry a grudge as rats carry disease: silently and forever. Now you're just a moving target with not much longer to live. Your worst nightmare is coming. Keep your door locked. I know where you live. I know where you are and I can guess where you'll be. I'm no fortune teller but in your future I see a closed casket.
