Witness this: a mortal man absorbing all one can take, pointlessly opposing a perfect pipedream's wake perfectly honed to mar the lives of men, immutably bound to its yoke again. Harboring a refusal to learn, the tide sees fit to carry astern. The stubborn sea commits to churn. The motherless aimlessly yearn for instructions without scorn. They sever the tethers which their arms adorn as our fathers commit to learn to lose to life and not to mourn. Conscience germinating pangs of guilt by the score. Grasping at life's fragmented wreckage refusing to wash ashore. Warring with diluted love's attempt to scar the mind. Where is the dream? Gone and left behind.
