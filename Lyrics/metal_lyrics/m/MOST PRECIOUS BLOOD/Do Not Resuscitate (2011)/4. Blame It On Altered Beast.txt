To defend the head - the first lesson I ever learned. The scarring of the mind stretched across hours, like novocaine's taste as it wears to reveal the only thing which tastes better as it sours. A man torn in half and a beast which obsesses on giving out what is deserved. The urge to defend and the lust to destroy - two masters which no man can serve. Those whom fate would destroy it first makes mad. With me forever, the beast which helped me survive, emerging like a parasite to defend its host like a living nightmare walking with death on my side. A man torn in half and a beast which obsesses on giving out what is deserved. The urge to defend and the lust to destroy - two masters which no man can serve. No man can serve two masters.
