Judgment comes when I close one eye. One last chance to kiss your loved ones goodbye. Gather and cull without reason or rhyme. One shot, one kill, every fucking time. A radical method of behavior correction with an intractable refusal to temper aggression. Take it as gospel. I mean every word. Long lives the desire for herding the humans then thinning the fucking herd. For every one of you who judged and abused, there waits thousands like me with the means and the will once and for all to even the score. One shot, one kill. A radical method of behavior correction with an intractable refusal to temper aggression. Take it as gospel. I mean every word. The only thing which remains in my mind: the herding of humans then thinning the fucking herd. Kiss your loved ones goodbye. One finger, one trigger, one scope, one eye. Kiss your loved ones goodbye.
