Breathe with hell in your heart and see with death in your eyes. Should fear exist in you, your scent will draw the hunters to you. If you move, run for your life because in this place anything that moves dies. Here there's no haven. Move like lightning unladen. Keep your head down and run as if pursued by hell itself. Here there's no haven. You've got to move like lightning unladen. Abandon all you've wanted because you've become the hunted. No man is ever so honest as when trailed by a hunter. This is no secret, from one animal to another. If you move, run for your life. Here there's no haven. Move like lightning unladen. Keep your head down and run as if pursued by hell itself. Abandon all you've wanted because you've become the hunted. Breathe with hell in your heart and see with death in your eyes. When you move, run for your life because anything that moves gets thrown to the wolves.
