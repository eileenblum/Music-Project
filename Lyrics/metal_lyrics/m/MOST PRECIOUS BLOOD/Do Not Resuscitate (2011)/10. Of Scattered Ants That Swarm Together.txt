The sky is on fire. I am the fire, and now a jury turned into a choir. Second chances came and went. The distance is growing and won't relent. My eyes overcast in tears and mud. My debt overpaid in bone and blood. Time lies of its age and we're wont to cease since the fires and the floods. Second chances came and went. The distance is growing and won't relent. The echoing death rattle of honor still ringing. The scars of battles old still stinging. Holding shaking hands in the roar of the quake with the choir singing the only sound it can make. Second chances came and went. The distance is growing and won't relent. Familiar, defeat's acrid scent. The passage of distancing time won't relent.
