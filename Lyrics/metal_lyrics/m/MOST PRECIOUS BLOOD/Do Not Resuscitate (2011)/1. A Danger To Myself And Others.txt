This is my most heartfelt spit in the face to every one of you who represent this place. Every word is a knife between the ribs of every single member of the fucking human race. Live day by day because life is cold. It's apathetic and ill-disposed. No one makes the promise that you'll survive. When death sees fit to close your eyes it keeps them closed. This is a place only for those who endure and recognize the simplest law of nature: you die if you don't grow. The law of these times: abandon all hope.
