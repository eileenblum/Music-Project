[Music: Daniel Mongrain]
[Lyrics: Daniel Mongrain]

"Don't waste what little time you have been granted on complaints.
And live your life to the fullest."

The past trespasses
When now settles in
Ephemeral experiences
Fleeting memories
Being elsewhere at the wrong time
Sacrificing a part of your life
Hungry packs of illusions

No one will grieve or shed a tear
For stolen destinies
Forsaken
Regrets are your life's bitter legacy

Carpe Diem
Your life is yours to create
Carpe Diem
So leave the past behind

[Lead: Pier-Luc Lampron]
[Lead: Daniel Mongrain]

Hope for a second chance
Forever haunting you
Time beyond reclaim
Wasted in the past
Living beside your virtual life
Ad Vitam Aeternam
