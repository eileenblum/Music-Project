[Music: Daniel Mongrain]
[Lyrics: Daniel Mongrain]

"Are you aware of your existence?
And of the reason for it?"

Tear me out of this
Forever lost world
Between time and space
Tear me out of these
Realms where life's
Eternal for those
Who seize it

Surrounded by lost souls
Paralyzed existence
For those whose
Life is a failure
Who are a failure to life

Endless vortex
Towards erasing destiny
Endless vortex
Erasing my destiny
The flame died away

Where am I here and now?
Why was I not
And never will?

[Lead: Daniel Mongrain]
