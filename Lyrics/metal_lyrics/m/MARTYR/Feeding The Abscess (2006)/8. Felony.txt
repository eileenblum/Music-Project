[Music - Dan Mongrain, Lyrics - Francois Mongrain &amp; Phillipe Papirakis]

-All who so thirst for power-
-Fail to see how swift it devours...-

Oh faithless arrogance
Thou hast amended the souls
Of all they who be brave...
And so dost thou beseech all
Wearing away the spirit, the flame

Those who would rise
Hide 'neath all the lies
And they who would call
Praise their fatality...
Crawling, they, as larvae.

Insipid, arrogance,
Leaving the valiant
Perfidy, hearsay,
Assailing the ardent

Discrete revolts
Abstract word
Bravery fulminated
Stagnant larvae

Truth drawn from the waters of chance
Lust for power, pointless, ignorant
With all the grandeur of entropy
Questioning faith, place your bets

Waxen feathers, raising stakes
A lament of praise,
The tears of an angel
The illusion of glory never to exist

Imperfect perfection
Perfectly imperfect

Forfeiting desire
Perennial quest
Never to begin

[Lead - Dan Mongrain]

Acerbically stoic
Ineptly lucid
Fanatic felons
Heroic cowardice

Jail of flesh
Nets of woven nerves
Ditches of blood
Time's ball and chain

Those who would rise
Hide 'neath all the lies
And they who would call
Praise their fatality...
Crawling, they, as larvae...
