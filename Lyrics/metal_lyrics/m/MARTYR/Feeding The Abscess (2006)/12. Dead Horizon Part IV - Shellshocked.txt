[Music - Francois Mongrain, Dan Mongrain and Martin Carbonneau, Lyrics : Phillipe Papirakis]

Eyes tightly shut,
Mind open wide
Shell of shocked life.
Truth held concealed.

[Violin lead - Antoine Bareil]

Fear, Regret, Pain, Agony,
Choking, Cold, Void, Emptiness,
Torment, Slave, Trapped,
Paralyzed, Alone, Spent,
Drained, Dead.
