[Music - Dan Mongrain &amp; Martin Carbonneau, Lyrics - Dan Mongrain &amp; Phillipe Papirakis]

-A tormented soul sentenced to die-
-Haunted by the sins of life-

All is sacrificed
For a moment's time
The blink of an eye -
Thousands of lives

Almost dead, but not quite
The shadow of a past
Never left behind

Rising
From the time of torment
When all
All I am is now
Forgotten

[Lead: Martin Carbonneau]

The blink of a star
Thousands of suns
Sentenced to exile
Estranged from all kin
For naught but the semblance
Of indifference
La haine est un amour intense

[Lead: Dan Mongrain]

Alien pulse, entombed in pain
Distorting space, compressing time
Nameless, Faceless, Neverborn
Impaled by the

Rising
From the time of torment
When all
All I am is now
Forfeit
