[Music: Francois Mongrain, Lyrics: Phillipe Papirakis &amp; Francois Mongrain]

-Delusion drowning me in a sea -
-Of self doubt awakening fury   -
-Emptiness nourishes me -
-Cannibalizing my essence for -
-Sustenance -

Becoming the night
Breaking it down
Crawling the recess
Expediting all
Rejecting my substance
Sustaining my wants
Everything and nothing at all
Rattle, rattle, rattle

Pushing deeper into myself
Mourning the passing of intolerance
Serpents caged within their lair
Gorgoneion's stare reflecting vanity

Graven in Medusa's eyes
My ego once in disguise
My deepest fears screaming at me
Rattle, rattle, rattle

Pushing deeper into myself

[Lead - Martin Carbonneau &amp; Dan Mongrain, Violin theme - Antoine Bareil]
