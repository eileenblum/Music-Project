[Music: Daniel Mongrain, Lyric: Daniel Mongrain and Phillippe Papirakis]

Where are they gone,
all your hopes and your dreams?
Cheaply sold to icons of the rot.
A common cesspool of all our ideals
Repent!
In God we Trust
Buy low, sell high!

Cold, Numb, Gone
Nothing can keep me here!
Nothing...

Crack a line in my face,
Look into me.
As light and sound tear me asunder
All you will see... an empty shell
Tyrant!
You're the cattle
You're the butcher

No longer can I see
Perched here within me
I ponder and assemble myself
Like a puzzle, a psychic conundrum
Whilst my mind continues to flee
And I am lost in my retreat

Perpetual Healing...
Infinite Pain!

-Coup de ThÃ©atre-
A miasmal tragedy
I wear the mask of normalcy
Far be it for to upset
Your reality
But I must, and so I become
Perpetual Healing
Infinite Pain

[Lead : Daniel Mongrain]

My soul... Petrified
Revealing myself... Open wide
Judgment will be my pride
For wasting my life

Perpetual Healing...
Infinity, Pain!
