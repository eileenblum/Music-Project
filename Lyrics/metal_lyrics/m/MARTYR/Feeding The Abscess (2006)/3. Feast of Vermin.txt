[Music - Francois Mongrain, Collaboration - Dan Mongrain, Lyrics - Francois Mongrain &amp; Phillipe Papirakis]

-Usurpers, they uprooted the-
-Very foundation of freedom-.
-Now all that remains is a-
-Pointless human race - first  -
-come, first served - the prize -
-is a lifetime as a slave with -
-nothing more to be gained. -

A taste of virtue
The bile threatening to erupt
Cough it up, cough it up
A guest of honor
At the greatest banquet
Now smile and shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck up!

Time is running out
The vermin have arrived
They know, They know, They know...

They know how to tell you to bow
How they tell you to show
What they wanted to see
They know how to tell you to bow
How they tell you to know
What they want you to know

Wine and dine upon
Finest rat anal tract
Gobble down twin servings of brain

They know...
How to tell you to bow
How they tell you to show
What they wanted to see
They know how to tell you to bow
How they tell you to know
What they want you to know

Politics have no place here
Theirs is not a vulgar crown
For after all you'd just tell
Them you're wrong
And they would toast
Your good taste for company

Dessert was served
Before you even arrived
They beg your pardon
Put you in the cauldron
Rat - Poison, Mousetrap
Rodent supreme

The feast of vermin [x4]
