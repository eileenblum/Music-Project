[Music - Dan Mongrain, Collaboration - Francois Mongrain, Lyrics: Francois Mongrain &amp; Phillipe Papirakis]

-Much too easy to learn -
-The rules of the game -
-To rule their domain -

A world deceived by science
Leaving nothing but silence
Devoid of passion and truth
Roaring drunk on the absolute
Frailty from a subconscious mind
Mortality made absurd
Roaring drunk on the absolute

Ignorance personified
My genius is primal fury
...Circus animal

Acerbic truth spawns
Liposcelis corrodens
Worming through to the cerebrum
Growing fat on dormant neurons
And the illusion of reason
Devouring shades of vision
Betraying thought with delusion

Ignorance personified
My genius is primal fury
...Circus animal

Bowing down to false leaders
I'm the consequence
Who is the king and who is the fool?
Bowing low to buffoons
So naive
My splendor is the pallor
Of your failed reality

[Lead: Martin Carbonneau]

Devoid of passion and truth
Leaving nothing but science
Disassembling the absolute
Reveling in violence
A world deceived by silence
In silence
