[Tu t'empÃªches de voir la vÃ©ritÃ©. Tu te noieras dans ta certitude.]

[DM-] EVIL SEIZES
RAIN OF SAND
A TORRENT OF IMAGES
LOST IS THE BLIND
EVIL SEIZES
RAIN OF SAND

EVIDENCES
-INSIGNIFICANT-
IN THE EYES OF
THE BEWITCHED

THE MUTE TURN DEAF
THE DEAF TURN BLIND
THE BLIND TURN TO SAND
THEN THE SAND BEGINS TO RAIN

[FM-] THROUGH MY MURKY INNER MEANDERS
AT THE EDGE OF A DRASTIC TRANSITION
I'M TRYING TO CATCH A GLIMPSE
THROUGH THE FRACTURED MIRROR OF MY REFLECTION

TIRED OF DARK COMPLACENCY
TRYING TO LIVE THE DAY MY NIGHT WILL END
UNTIL A MORROW THAT I DON`T KNOW
UNTIL A DAWN THAT I CAN`T CONCEIVE

[DM-] BLIND FOLDED BEHIND REALITY
BLIND TOWARD WHAT WE DON`T WANT TO SEE
BLIND, WILLING LOSS OF SENSITIVITY
BUT TRUE BLINDS SOMETIMES I ENVY

ONLY THE PURE SOUL
CAN TALK, HEAR AND SEE
FREE OF HIS ANCESTORS
AND OF ITS REASON

SEPARATES TWO WORLDS IN ONE
HE WHO BLAMES ETERNITY

[Lead: Daniel Mongrain]
