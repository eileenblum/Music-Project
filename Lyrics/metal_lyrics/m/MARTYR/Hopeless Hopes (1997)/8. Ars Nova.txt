[Paroles: FranÃ§ois Mongrain]

[Un cadavre repose dans son sang, une vision figÃ©e dans le temps; Profanation de l'Ã¢me d'un mourant, L'utilisation de la mort pour la gloire de l'argent. Et certains osent appeler Ã§a de l'art.]

[DM-] A BLOODY HAND COLLAPSED
ON THE SOILED GROUND
IT`S FLUID OF LIFE STREAMING
THROUGH THE EARTH`S ENTRAILS
A GOOD ANGLE IS NOT A PROBLEM TO CATCH
THOSE EXPRESSIONS THAT WILL LAST

PERFECT MODELS FOR THE EXPOSURE
BUT IN AN ART GALLERY
WHY DON`T THEY LET THOSE CORPSES DISAPPEAR
'CAN'T CALL THIS IMMORTALITY

[DM+FM-] ARS NOVA, DESECRATION
ARS NOVA, NORMALIZATION ATTEMPT

[DM-] THEY WANT TO SEE THEMSELVES AS ARTISTS
WITH THE FINEST AESTHETIC
BUT I SEE THIS AS VANDALISM
WITH NO RESPECT FOR THE DYING
PRIVILEGE OF SOME PHOTOGRAPHIES
SACRILEGE OF WHAT THEY SEE
PRIVILEGE OF SOME ATROCITIES
DESECRATION

[Lead: Daniel Mongrain]

[DM+FM-] ARS NOVA, DESECRATION
ARS NOVA, NECROPHILLIC TEMPTATION

[DM-] PERFECT MODELS FOR THE EXPOSURE
BUT IN AN ART GALLERY
[DM+FM-] WHY DON`T THEY LET THOSE CORPSES DISAPPEAR
'CAN'T CALL THIS IMMORTALITY
