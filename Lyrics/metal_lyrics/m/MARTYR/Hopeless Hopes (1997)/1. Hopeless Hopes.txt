[Paroles: FranÃ§ois Mongrain]

[EspÃ©rer peut faire trÃ¨s mal, surtout face Ã  des illusions. Ãchec aprÃ¨s Ã©chec, l'on se rÃ©fugie dans la rÃ©clusion et le mÃ©pris. Toutefois, la vie sans dÃ©sir ne peut pas valoir la peine d'Ãªtre vÃ©cue.]

[DM-] NOTHING EVER COMPARED TO
THE PAIN DELIVERED BY HOPE
THIS REASSURING DERISION
TO BELIEVE IN ILLUSIONS

ABSTRACTION OF ALL DESIRES
THAT IS THE WAY TO SUICIDE
IN A WORLD NOURISHED BY LIES
NO ONE CAN FULFIL HIS LIFE

FAILURE AFTER FAILURE
MORE THAN THE HEART CAN ENDURE,
LIFE BECOMES A SLOW TORTURE
UNTIL THE GRAND DEPARTURE

AGING FASTER THAN TIME PASSES,
DON'T IMPLORE TO START OVER
WISHES RARELY EVER COME TRUE
WHEN YOUTH GROWS OLD TOO FAST

[Lead: Pier-Luc Lampron]

FAILURE AFTER FAILURE
UNTIL THE GRAND DEPARTURE
FAILURE AFTER FAILURE
UNTIL THE GRAND DEPARTURE

[Lead: Daniel Mongrain]
