you can't see you are my everything
now you're my pouring rain i'll put you down
try to be just what you wanted me to be
walk away i'll put you down
i can't depend upon myself
i wanted you nobody else
nobody here to watch me drown
i'm moving faster now
see me flying faster now
All right
and i don't know
i'm having doubts again
and i don't know
