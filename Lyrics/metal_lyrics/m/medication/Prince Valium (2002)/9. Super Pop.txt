see the people all walk by
watch them turn away
do i ask the question why
i wonder what they'd say
i cannot find
i do not know
no longer mine
no where to go
i cannot be
no longer me
with nothing left
feel the movement in your eyes
hard to speak today
catch yourself within a lie
turn and walk away
i've been here before
