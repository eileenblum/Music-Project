leaves are falling
can't find my wings
i can't find my wings at all
i'd speak but you've already spoken
and you've said nothing at all
the game is already over
i can't find my wings at all
holding on again to nothing left to say
sinking with my friend i carry on
the more i think the less i sleep
i'm getting old the water's deep
holding on again to nothing left to say
halo something to hold me down
i know for me to walk alone
halo something to hold me down
i know today for me to go
