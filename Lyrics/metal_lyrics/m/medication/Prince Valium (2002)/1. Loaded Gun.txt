i stare at me
reflections of the mirror i see
and it is done
i've got amphetamine eyes
and the knowledge of handguns
and all the things i'll try to find
with everything i've left behind
and i've got something you don't know
and you're the one who'd like to know
hold me down
shoot again but you do not want to
show me how
free again but you know they've caught you
i try to hide
i'd rather be alone tonight
i try to run
i got a devil inside
i'm the seed of a bad son
now what is it behind these eyes
and even i don't realize
that there is nothing here for me
and you're the one who'd like to...
