and she was gone too young
and she is underground
does she feel no pain
now does she see me clear
can she hear the sound
we have called her name
she said
i cannot find
born to lose
live to die
go far away
to a place you've been before
if it hurts to stay then go
if you go then don't go far
cuz no matter where you land
it's exactly who you are
i watch the world turn
and leave the tv on
then she disappears
now does she know my name
is she really gone
you know i'm still right here
she said
don't bring me down
stay don't go
if it hurts to stay then go
please don't go
