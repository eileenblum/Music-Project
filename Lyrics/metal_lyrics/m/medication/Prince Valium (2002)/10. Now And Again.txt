i see so clearly
for all it has been
look back you've blackened my memories
how fast the time flies
burning my eyes
i'm blinded by kindlessness
screaming at me
trying and lying
believing deceiving
i listen to you i don't hear anything
crying and dying
and dying i'm dead
look at me now and again
lost in this dream
awaken to see
the lack of light is crippling me
i put my head into the machine
i hold on to something here
breathing in me
walk away my friend
i've fallen down
too much too late
i've been here
