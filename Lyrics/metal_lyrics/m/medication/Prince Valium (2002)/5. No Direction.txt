i know that there is no direction
far from anywhere i've been
too much of anything kills anyone
or so i think i've seen
don't let it fall don't let it in
you needed more of everything
don't let it fall the chance to live
and what is it you're after
what it is to me
what is it you're after now
i need your help i need protection
safe from things i cannot see
my love is anything that's possible
and what you mean to me
and i feel naked i cannot take it
and i feel naked right now
