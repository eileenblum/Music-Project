can you go down
can you stand right here
get your prayers on
swallow it down
cuz you got nothing to fear
can you feel me
did i make you clear
are you near me
don't bother looking
you know there's nobody here
what do i need to make it whole
what do i need to let it go
what do i need to make it mine
what do i need to say goodbye
what have you done
how did you get here
load up your gun
put on the trigger
cuz you got nothing to fear
and it's no fun
when there's no one here
and you're no one
don't bother looking
you know there's nobody here
