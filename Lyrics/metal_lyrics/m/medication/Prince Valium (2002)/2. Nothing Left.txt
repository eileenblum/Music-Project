i can't take it anymore
and everything i had before
has gone so far away
no mistake i wanted more
hesitate to let it go
and i am gone
you will follow me
i'll follow you
and there is nothing left to do now
nothing left to do now
nothing left to do
i can't take it anymore
and what i need i had before
and now i fade away
make me wait what was it for
show me where i started from
and i am gone
walking away
nothing more left to say
oh yeah
feeling alright
no excuse left to fight
oh yeah
and i say
