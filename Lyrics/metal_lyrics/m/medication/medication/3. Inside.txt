is it time for me to say goodbye
seeing everything has made me blind
maybe just one time if i could fly
maybe i could live before i die
knocking only once
i now sell everything for you
understand i'll try
before i die to break on through
what about you
hoping everything will be alright
listening to the things i have inside
why does everybody seem to lie
maybe i could live before i die
i would die for you
i would kill anything for you
i would sell anything for you
anything i would sell anything
what about you
