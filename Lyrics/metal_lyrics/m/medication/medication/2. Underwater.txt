listen when i say to you
be happy if you got it
hold my breath a pass the test
i'm living under water
on and on it seems so long
i wonder should i count the days
i'm waiting
the me that you know is just a fucking scar
the me that you know doesn't live here anymore
wonder if you'll follow through
you really have to want it
don't hesitate to love or hate
be happy if you saw it
in my vague reality
i never thought to ask your name
i'm waiting
the chance to choose we chose
nobody knows nobody knows
falling to pieces
nothing to say
i see my life is slipping away
count all the reasons
i cannot breathe
i see my life is running from me
