and it's been said to me
i'll hold a key i'll never see
and what i used to have was lost but now
i found it
and without sympathy
the bleeding eye could never see
they're lining up to die the people i have counted
all the things i need to never
do the things i want to do
thought that it would change forever
but i never really want it
i used to try to be what i had seen that wasn't me
and what surrounded me was people that were clouded
and though it's hard to see just what i mean it isn't free
and what has grounded me
was something that you doubted
