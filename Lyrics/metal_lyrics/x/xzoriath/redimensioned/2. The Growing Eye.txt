The Sign is given
Through laboratory forces
His left Eye is growing
Prepared to be misused
The cattle and the Shepherd
Counted one by one

An unknown convention
Intervening Him and us
Through the latent
Worldâs perceptions
Always following the Pattern
With someone deriding
By our side

Distorted senses
Possessive ceremony
Their bones have been modified
The dinner is served
Marking their belonging
Flowering in splendour

Take the whole of the Eye
Their voice has been deprived
To serve someone's seeing
Tremendously undoing
Despite their reservations
His invisibility
