Inhale their fear!
Damped by the clusters of limbs,
Grabbing their decendants remnants
Bystanders burying themselves alive dispassioned
Plethoric feet deep in the ground they remain.

Night is finally calm
Drop this child down
Let the pain in!

Sepulchral smells silence
In void they'll be casted
Obstinate is grip holding this misery in arms
As those mutilated children were still their own

Night is calm
Drop this child down
Let the pain in!
Night is finally calm

Blasted wombs lie exhausted there
Giving birth to draughting entrails
Foetus fission reveals its pride
Disconnecting sides of the brains
