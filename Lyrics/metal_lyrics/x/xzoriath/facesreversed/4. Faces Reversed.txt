And now when their faces are gone
When the gods are self-destructive and you
You still think you follow the gun
But the gun now points at you

And now they're deceived to creep after gods
Who are now desperately following them
You still think you are living in pain
But the pain now lives in you

It's time to justify the consciousness
Of those who are still breathing in waste

See their screaming sighs
Hear the blackness bright
In their so called eyes
Crying stories out about their
Memory of life

Recover those once existing cries
See their so-called eyes

And now when their voices are gone
And they are drowning in chorus of sighs
You might think you're digging your grave
But the soil already corrodes you

And still they're deceived to creep after gods
Who are desperately following them
You might think you're living in pain
But the pain now lives in you

Recover those once existing cries
Still there in the stinking blood
Floating up from the ashes and soil
