Brain reset
Determining the reality's illness
Do you still have your wish of facing the past?

Watch and you see
See all those virtual causes
Turned into effects as memories failed

Try to recreate the pain
Disappeared in the eyes grabbing the air

Many minds have been dedicated
To the masters pleasure
The thoughts drop down the walls
As water in caves of decline
And my throat is bleeding for them

But a life in oblivion
Is worse than in god
