Establishing rules for the last recipient
Of emergency-calling
For Third latent Agreement
Counting the vicious members
In the Court of
Preapocalyptic Warriors
Reawaken

Let the superfluous heartbeats die
Before the Last Dawn
Will show its toothless mouth
Dead-line for your final dream
In the bed of
The Static Dimension
Suspended

The howl of every decent prayer
They paste to the walls
Instead of the names
Of those killed in the War
Abridged like
The indolents Bible

Disposition to change direction
Unpossessed of the freaks
Finally downwritten
In for long vanished Dark Book
Of The only Legislator
Who bought the Veil of ignorance
Mutilated

You soon will be ordered
To dig up the ground
In front of the feet of
The Innocent who
Watches all that
Stops moving
In Amphyspace
