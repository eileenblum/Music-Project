The process invisibly begins
Hearing that melting sound anew
Experience that the Ices
Are letting you see
In your fragrant grace
You walk
Xzoriath

Terraining a fresh uncertainty
The biological manuscript interrupted
Garnish the misery with salve
From your very Soul
You act
Xzoriath

Lavish the parts of the figures
Created of fermenting limbs
In forgotten consciousness
The Inapplicable Face is born
In your fragrant grace
You walk
Xzoriath

Create me a link
To the gate of your death
To the range of unborn
Oh Xzoriath
Create me a link
To the range of unborn
To the gate of your death
Oh Xzoriath
