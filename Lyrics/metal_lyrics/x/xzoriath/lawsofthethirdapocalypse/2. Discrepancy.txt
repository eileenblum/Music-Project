World's in discrepancy
Sucking the blood out of my throat
In wasteful enquiry
Distorting a neutral evil
I've been taught by clergymen
I have learned from Hedony
No questions constitute the Realm
Hearing perverted voice of the Deaf

Come, oh Goddess,
Approximate the distance
Placed between two Eyes
One blind and one Omnividerent
Come, oh Goddess, show me

The first one dedicated
As Victim at the gate of Xzoriath
The second one as a gift
Of beneficence through torture

Convenient abbreviation
Constantly asked for by Losers
Constantly letting someone
To help to remove
The skin from their face
Conglomeration of the misfitted
Has spoken its speech
Two horrors of Imperative mood
Has been heard

Come, oh Goddess
In virtue of seldom
Experienced matters
The loved ones are burned
Or laid underground
Come, oh Goddess, show me

The first one to the honour
Of Victim at the gate of Xzoriath
The second one as a gift
Of beneficence through torture
