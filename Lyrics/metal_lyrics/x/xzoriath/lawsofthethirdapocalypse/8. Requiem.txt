Deliver the purple roses
To inspire the rotting nations
Finally calm in the sacred ground
Deliver the irresistible hunger
To the worms of a new Creation
At least for a while

Embalm all those bloodshot eyes
Gently with soil
From the Unburned
Teach me the new song
Through curtains of steel
Giving Xzoriath power
To cover the visions
Of those who sleep
After unbiased battle

Calm is the Newborns Breast
Eroded the old mans
Let them see your grief,
Oh God
Lapsed in the virtue they
Fell from your arms
Let the chorus of Angels blind
Echo in Fourth Dimension
To silence their burdened cry
Who once have dropped
A petrified tear

Teach them to find
The Memory
Of a forlorn society
Teach them to write
A brand new song
Into the Sacred Book
Of the Third Apocalypse
Your eyes
Are plastered
Forever...
