Making impossible to catch
The horizon of vanished diseases
Don't look behind
Remembering
Into the picture of the Grate Cause
You drowned the convention
Of Nature

Complex ideas of clear exposition
We've buried alive in the Dark
Stereotyping the bodies of humans
Volunteers gaining the rest
Like an artist in action
Of Bleeding

Feeble is rhythm of execution
Of your ancestors memory
By craftsmen restored
In twisted shape
Only the Maledicted Ears
Can ever hear the illusions
Of Breathing

Kill the violins metal screams
Coming from rendering minds
Regretted edition of life in the exile
Is offered for sewing the scars
Come lend them a piece
Of living

Two Animals hearts
You gave me, oh Goddess
To teach me
The Logic of Yours

Sink Him who fights for
Recovering means
Deep down into
The Last Battle
