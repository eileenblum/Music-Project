[Music &amp; Lyrics by Rory Kennedy]

The halls reverberate with the howls of the mad
Shivering the spine as it makes him glad

Invading the realm of the truly insane
The planetary hopefulness of those too plain
Living in fear of those other deranged
One's own descent can be arranged

Falling against the walls for support
Searching feverishly, his breath short

Waiting for the wailing of the cursed to subside
They plead in a million voices for god to come inside
A horrible abscence of the deity they treasure
As he stumbles on, at their plight he finds pleasure

Remembering a laugh he falls to the floor
His mind's gone as he sees his name upon a door
Clinging desperately to a piece of his mind
As the visions increase, he becomes blind
Heading deeper into the land of the godless
Hands together hoping that they will hear him confess
Begging for release from this self-induced hell
From the hatred that put him in the cell

Losing his sense of surroundings as it fades
Hoping for an end to this horrific daze
In a rush of understanding he knows who's to blame
The father above, may he be consumed in flame
Lunatic ramblings, he cannot escape himself
Distancing from reality, his mind on a shelf
Vehement abhorrence, alone in time of need
Conspiracy created, a wish to spread the seed

Left alone, and forced to deal with his faith
Brings him to the conclusion that it may be too late
Abandoned by his Lord and left here to rot
Look at what his years of devotion brought
