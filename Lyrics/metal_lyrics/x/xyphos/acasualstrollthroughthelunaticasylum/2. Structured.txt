[Music by Rory Kennedy &amp; Andrew Power]
[Lyrics by Rory Kennedy]

Facing at an awkward angle
The universe is built up from the smallest molecule
Twitching hesitantly at the construction
Creation, horrific in its beauty

Delving deeper, it watches with detatchment
Curious nature, yet distant sensations
Rising from a fog holding hatred close
Without movement it becomes the watcher, going deeper

Residual tremors of uncertainty
Inability to grasp the spontaneity
Distancing yet watching with deeper intensity
One can believe they watch the work of their deity

A horrific beauty emerges
With eyes intent on domination
Stifling with regret, the urges
Which will carry over into adoration

Examining the construct of humanity
Deconstructing a smothering reality
Expose the horrors that cause hope to rupture
Analyze the molecules that become structured

Wait to find the eternal
No instant gratification
Denying the urge of the maternal
Where existence becomes an abbreviation

To exist as though structured
