Look at what your throwing away
What it all could have been
Squandered hopes and broken dreams
Expectations abandoned and burned away
But your not burning away
Your not burning away
Donât walk away from me

If you could only see, who you truly are
Just stand with me through another day
I promise one thing, that you can have it again
Feel it again
Weâll walk away from the edge of apathy
And I'll walk away with you

We'll walk away with the strength of sobriety
