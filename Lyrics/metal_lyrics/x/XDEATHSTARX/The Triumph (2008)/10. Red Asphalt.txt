Open up my wrists
And drain my life's blood
For my friends, I fail to believe
You can look me in the eyes
You've lost your faith
A life of digress
Your standards are wrong
Your standards are low
My hands are tied, your the one that set them
God help me, my anger grows
Should friendship stand through this?
My patience ends
Now will you bleed for me
Hollow words
But the saw is family

Process of elimination
Actions show weakness
Occasionally
Try to think of the suffering
That you spare your self the sight
And wont see

I've looked you in the eye
Confrontation, I'm not blind or afraid
Hard pressed to shine me off
You tried to say
You never pushed away

Hardcore, true friendship, loyalty
Tolerance is acceptance
For my friends I'll bleed

Severed ties
Show true, my stance
For those I care for
To those who fake loyalty
Actions show character
And characters the proof of your believes
Friendship is lost
Friendship is failed
And I wont
Stand by careless
Misery loves company
So take your friends and walk
Don't look to me
