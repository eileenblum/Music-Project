As we stand here
Lost and bloodied
I'm reminded
Of a promise that's made

Not content
To simply feel
This passion
Cause commitments shown
By conviction
Displayed to the world

So witness the triumph
Death to the sins
So witness the triumph

Been alone
And
Left in darkness
And there's
One truth
One life
One wrong and right
Words
And deeds
And actions
Meaningless
There's something
Tearing us apart
Yet you wont join the fight

So witness the triumph
Death to all sin
So witness the triumph

I'm not the pillar
Of Strength
That you think I am
Broken and beaten
And been
Left behind
Stand with you
Side by side
Back to back
Til the end
You need to know
That there's
More to this life

So witness the triumph
The death to all sins
So witness the triumph

Testify
The triumph
Wreck
