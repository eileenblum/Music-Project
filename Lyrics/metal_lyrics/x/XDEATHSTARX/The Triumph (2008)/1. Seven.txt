Your blood runs cold
Colder then the fear
In your eyes
And mine wont look away this time
The life you led
Has cut through your souls depth
Now it's your hour
It's time to reap what you've sewn
Cower
The lives you rape are not your own
It's our eyes that blind
Cut out the ones that look away
My weakness ends
So does the reign of your destruction
Power
Cut through the weakness
Break the bones
In hands that hold me back
Hour
It's time to reap what you've sewn
Cower
The lives you rape
Your blood runs cold
Your blood runs cold
Break the bones
In hands that hold me back
Break the bones
That hold me back
