United we stand
Divided we fall
Together my friend
To the bitter end

First step in a lifetime commitment
The good life within my grasp
Ruins of man beneath my heels
I'll Strive forward, I'll march on

Clear mind
Body and spirit
Sets us free
To make a change

The honor we hold
To be the men we are
Lasting convictions
Marked within our souls

An oath solely made
To set us free
And change this world
Through conviction with dignity

INTEGRITY

REPRESENT
