So much potential lost
You were given every chance in this world
But you watched them all pass you by
Look with in your heart not through your eyes

Iâve reached out to you for some time
But youâve never taken hold
It's still not too late to make a change
Every step leads to your grave

We were making a difference
We were side by side
Standing tall above this world
Held together against the tests of time

This commitment is my deliverance
From the thoughts that say I'm weak
From the place inside of me
That forgets my strength and beliefs

So much potential you've lost
It's still not too late to make this change
One chance to turn it around
I can't stand seeing you this way

There's no wasted choices here
Your life is the one you lead
Think of your heart and the strength you need
Because there are still things that last forever

This battle is fought day to day
The enemy tempts us we must abstain
Friend, family and the ones I love
Stand with me and make the change

SO NOW'S THE TIME
TO MAKE A CHANGE
A CHOICE FOR LIFE
NO TURNING BACK
