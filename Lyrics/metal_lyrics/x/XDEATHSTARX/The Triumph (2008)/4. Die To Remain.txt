Stand for what I feel inside it's not a game to me
I cant back down, I cant stand seeing what this does to you
You've given up, you've sold it out, but I'm still standing watching
I cant back down, I cant stand seeing what this does to you
You've given up, you've sold it out, but I'm still standing watching

So tired of mangled and broken convictions
Your will stands as weak as your addictions
The meaning is lost for you and this world
But this bond of brotherhood has kept me strong

It's time to live for something to die for
It's time to fill it with integrity
No time to second guess what you said
No time to second guess me

Now's the time to make a promise sealed with honor and back by true
Friendship eternal

No more lies of eternal convictions
No more convenient talks of change
Because I've made a single oath I stand for
It stands to say this is no longer a game to me

No more pathetic lies of conviction
No more hollow words of change
Because I made a single oath id die for
This is no longer a game to me

The friendship I've made
Have given me more when there was nothing to stand for
So now I'll give back to those who are still the same
For those who would die to remain

For those who would die to remain,
STRAIGHT EDGE

Straight edge was never a game to me
