This place
This time
This race
This floor
This fight

This world is ours

No pain
Regret
No loss
No shame
Disgrace
We take this by storm

Who stands with us
Hands in the air
Who stands alone
We laugh last
The battle looms
I'll stand with you
We fight a world
That's dwells in the past

In a world
Ripped apart at the seams
This is all I live for
It's everything to me

Our choice is made
My eyes are wide
This is my only time
I take this chance
No moments lost
I'm laying down my pride

My life for yours
No looking back
I spill my blood with you
Your heart is mine
Your world is changed
Were here no solitude

In a world
Ripped apart at the seams
This is all I live for
It's everything to me
Left behind

Stand
Fight
Take it by storm
