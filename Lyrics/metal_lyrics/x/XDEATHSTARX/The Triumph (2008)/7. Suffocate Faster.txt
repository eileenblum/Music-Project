Another losing battle
Another wasted friends
Another life mistread
These days will never end
But I know I'll stay committed
To a promise I made before
My life ran headlong Into the fray
Never know what lay in store for me

As these days unfold
I feel the same
My will is strong
My oath remains
Unchanged

You've heard this promise before
This world will never beat me down
I've drawn a line in my life
I'll fight to hold my ground

This world wont suck me under
This pit this place of deceit

My life's at a burning crossroads
I stand where truth and conviction meet

Integrity keeps me standing
With my friends who have fallen in the past
I'll be there to hold them up
And I'll show this oath can always last

You've heard this promise before
This world will never beat me down
I've drawn a line in my life
I'll fight to hold my ground

I'LL STAND STRONG MY OATH REMAINS UNCHANGED
Unchanged

Suffocate faster
Hold strong
Straight edge
I'll stand
Committed
