One chance
This is forever
The life
To be changed
You believe
Or lose heart
And
Sever
All that's good
From inside you

I still believe
I still believe
And I will believe
Believe in change

Times
Of loss
And times
Of pain
As time
Goes on
We fight
To regain
All we've
Lost
We can
Get back
Cause were not
Beaten
Were just
Under attack
No one is ever gone
Some will choose to fade
Hold fast, in the face of loss
A pure heart believes in change
I believe in change
I still believe
Believe
In change
