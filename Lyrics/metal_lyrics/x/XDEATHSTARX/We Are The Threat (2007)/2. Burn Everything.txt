Burn everything that surrounds you
It will profit you nothing but help to
Tear down the walls that blind you because anything would fail in compare to what the soul will find
You say that life is incomplete yet you do nothing
You say you're searching but I thought that would involve yourself
You better believe you can't afford the price you wager
I never knew the stagnance was a means of active help
What are we hoping we will find what is it that we seek
And was the knowledge held but cast aside for self philosophy
Reform is feared by empty means
Wishing this to last
But then the moments gone, we look away
But not to the sky
Burn everything that encompassed you in this life
Its time to search with ultra militance
Tear down the walls that are blinding you
Hell is not our destiny
All that we have is summed up in one choice
This is the apex of our whole existence
The purpose of all life
Its time to search with ultra militance
Because any thing would fail in compare to what He has
