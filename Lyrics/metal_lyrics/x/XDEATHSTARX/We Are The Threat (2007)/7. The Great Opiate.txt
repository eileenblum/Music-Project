Feed on society
The world as an object whole
The souls of the living
Mass communicate drugged
Rebuild the fear again with hopeless dreams
To manipulate the hope
The sense of reality has succumb to emotion
So we urge toward the glass
Turn to this media like a moth to the flame
Power to control
Control the masses
Marching toward the shores
And they lead the way
Pierce the heart
Pierce to the seed of it with a string of addiction
Bought in cold led to these false ideals with the thoughts of greed
This is not what you feel
The truth is reality
Over extend the senses
Numb the mind
Numb for the feeding its our lives they bleed
Fear our souls
Fear the reverse of the great opiate
Glory we hold to the creator
Beyond partitions, beyond common tongue, to depth of our being, who will fight the wake
Power to control
Control the masses
Marching to the shores and they lead the way
Feed on the world a whole the souls of the living
Not what
This is not what you feel the truth's reality
In the thoughts in the lives that have failed we hide ourselves
Try to find our way
Search for purpose without any end
In the thoughts in the lives that have failed
We hide ourselves
Try to find our way
Know for certain your eternity
In the fear in the pain that is felt
We hide ourselves
Who will fight the wake
Fear the reverse of the great opiate
