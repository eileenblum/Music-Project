Arise and wake
A call out to you Christian
Soften your calloused heart
Hardness shatters with resistance
This sin can cease to pattern your existence
If you'll take hold of it
This is the day of your salvation
Don't squander those gifts of your destiny
There is so little time to make a stand
This is the dawn of all eternity
Awakening
Don't ever settle for it's all within our reach
Slumber arose the start of decay in your faith
We step back to the bonds that used to chain us there is nothing now to
stop us
So we are the ones in the way
Fix your eyes to the end and keep your focus
What have we done with our lives
We were meant for so much more than this
A cry out for the new dawn
Arise from fear and loathe
The dawn of our awakening
Arise.... Steadfast
