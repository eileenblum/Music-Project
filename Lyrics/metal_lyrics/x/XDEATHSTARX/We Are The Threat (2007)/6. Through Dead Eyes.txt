Dead to the world so now the real life begins
The dismemberment of two selves
Divide what can not co-exist
We gave in to flesh
Just to spit in our face in the end
And the abandonment it left you in
Will break what left of your last will to..
Nothing is how it appears
Deny face value
The hiding of truth to control
You'll see the worlds true state through dead eyes
Only through dead eyes can you see
You're not alone when the realization hits
You don't fit in amongst the living
There is one absolute
You will never survive this life
So the resurrected saves
The resurrected cannot die
We were abandoned by the flesh
Dismember, dismember the two selves
Dead to the world, your life is ending
Possessions what you have become
Drown in life or refine in fire
Call to the living
Call out to all who will be dead
