Fallen sons don't believe the glow is lost
Slipped away into outer darkness
Shadow fell while the sleep had you close your eyes
To the will of this adversary
Live this life for your self, turn it over to sin
Never weigh the cost
It will only help to refrain
Reject the thoughts of a peace
Of a compromise
Torn between so don't mourn for this life
Own all that is free to accept the cost the will made is the bind that seals us
Self destruct when the poisoned mind can not think soon to realize who was the cause of all our pain
Strength wont hold out for long
Every ten out of ten that grips to his life loses it in the end
Strength wont hold out for long
Every town out of ten
Break the crutch that cripples, not the edge
Crush the lies and deceit, turn from he who maims
To deny rebirth suffocate the flame, broken promises made to revel ones trust
Abused freedoms the slaves of our own lust
Hard way down is the path when the pride we appease doom is on the rise
Doom will smash the pride to regain self destruction at hand, poisoned minds can not Think don't believe for one moment you won't fail
Destroy yourself
Fallen sons don't believe that the glow is lost
Destroy your self
Don't believe don't believe that the glow is lost
As we destroy ourselves...
