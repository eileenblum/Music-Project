Another modern life
Just a crash course to oblivion
Preview a battered soul's fall
Drowning in the struggle to the surface fades away from
Sight shifts to accord with
Morals won't suspend the dead weight of the sinking
Salvation wrench the soul
Step back into the haze
Or let new life unfold
Eternity, every
The gravity of the unknown
Darkness takes move again
So comes the power to oppose
All will prevail who are under
Another modern life
A wretched life sad and unworthy
A doubting soul
Who can stand in my way
I can not fall one life for all
Steal and destroy
You know I've come for this
I'll rip his soul from him
And I'll take pride in it
Observe the end it's just begun
I'll bruise my heel but crush your face
Alpha Omega
If this is real let me cease to be
If this is real then let me decrease
Holy, so who am I to trample Him
When every moment is a lifetime
And only death is sure to come
Holy, so who am I to trample him
A beauty beyond our highest sight
And only death is sure to come
Death that's sure to come
