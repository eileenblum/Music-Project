[feat. Vincent Bennett]To know the truth and yet to struggle so
To walk the straight line
We place the stones on which we stumble
This is not destiny nor is it trial
Free will is yours to make
So unmask your wrong
Slipping away, a compromise and fall
You stand for nothing
I will stand for you
So keep the edge
Let your convictions never dull
Because the flesh is weak
One life drug free
Search the graves for hope
What did you think you'd find
Not a short fuse that was lit
One for the road
Its your last goodbye
Unforeseen fate of the backslid
