Proved the case and still wrong
Now the lines that are drawn in our lives
Have been made as a front they war from
They lose
Never back down to ignorance
Never back down because of our youth
Live whatâs true
Put on strength, leave dead weight
And carry on
They covet but can not obtain
So in the face of opposition
For pleasures their fighting in vain
A war in members
We are the threat! We are the threat!
In a world of mass confusion
We are the threat! We are the threat!
TRUTH
Standing against the seas
Stand against the rising of the tide
You cant fight the wake when your faith
Has been placed in what will capsize
So lay your head on the block
For your truth, for your God
What are they afraid of
Our conviction, their conviction
I know what and why I believe
If my convictions stand a threat to your life
Then itâs a pipe dream
Poisoned minds hide the fact with deceit
You can not change the past by closing your eyes
So what is sewn you will reap
No truth, indecision, lost conviction
Turning from wrong and right
Exploitation is what they fear
So they take up arms and we are in their sights
Your not standing alone at the front line of war
So be not afraid
For your fear is in vain
The outcome was set before us
Though the opposition comes, we are one
So be not afraid
Persevere to the end
The courage that flows through our blood
