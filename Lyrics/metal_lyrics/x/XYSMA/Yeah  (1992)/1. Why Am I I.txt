So many religions making me ponder
About heaven &amp; hell or if I'll be born again
Is nature the creator or is there a heavenly father god
Are we born and do we die? That's all

Have you thought about the nearness of death to us all?
World's greatest secret
And you can unveil it
If you want

What's the meaning?
Why am I I?
When it comes to an end we're all small children

I was floating in warm darkness
And that knowledge, as if somebody was holding my birth in his hands
Do I stand at the gates of hell?

To be born into this world
Truth is so near
But then I'm born
I lose it again
Why am I I?
