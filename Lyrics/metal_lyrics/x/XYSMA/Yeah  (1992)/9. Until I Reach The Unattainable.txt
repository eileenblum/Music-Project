Sounds from the distant past, a ghost of my mind 
Raging currents which I created in my head 
Imprisoned me as I went too close 
To its final aim - within this moment 
In the gentle breeze I see it 
Through boundless corners of the mind 
On verity I ride 

Until I reach the unattainable 
Will I reach the unattainable 

Anger of the imaginary gods 
An enormous outburst is hidden 
Inside me - there it is 
Anger - I can see it 

The world is a green flash - mixed with purple 
Fading away, fading away 
It appears again, it appears again
