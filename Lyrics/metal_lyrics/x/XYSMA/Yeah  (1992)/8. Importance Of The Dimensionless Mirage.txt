My patience hampers the evil that hallucinates the light 
The eye of the ephemera is warning me watch out the life 
I see into the spike, this isn't the usual way to die 
I've always thought that you're a unique person 

But my comprehension ends, when I saw you flying between the air 
Do you understand the importance of a dimensionless mirage?? 

The web of time 
Has enmeshed me 
On endless arms 
I fall asleep 

Can you forgive me 
Forget all those carnages 
Which I realized in your life 

My cross is dead and the ephemera's eye is blind 
The web has melted - my dream is reality 
Do you understand the importance of a dimensionless mirage
