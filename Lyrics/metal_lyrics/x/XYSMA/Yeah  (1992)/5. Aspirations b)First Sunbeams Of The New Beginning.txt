Mountains rise above the sky 
Everything is green around me 
The wind whispers gently 

The grass, the trees and all 
Flowers of joy grow again 
Nature hold me 

The first morning of the new beginning 
The day dawns for hope 
Our minds are rinsed 
This is a new experiment 
Maybe nature makes it 
And we can live in paradise 

Now we have peace, everybody knows what's right 
The world is alive again, the playing starts again 
Everything seems to be alright 
This love between animals and man 
Is it momentary?
