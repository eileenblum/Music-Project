Towards the horizon 
From under the sea 
Firmament 
Is laughing at me 

Greenish visions 
From the past 
Millions of coffins 
Of the future 

The waves sing death 
I'm listening to their message 
The sky melts and the star fries 
I'm a cell in your veins 

Ears turn into birds 
Flesh starts to shrink 
My tearduct evacuates shapes and rain 
Slugs are crawling on the sun 
Your mental health is weakening 
The planet surrounds you 
You're only a reflection 

Look at me - I'm your scenery 
Paint me and you'll see 
Close your eyes and you'll be free
