you are so fucking weak your hour ends with me, reality strikes inflicting death by my hands of hate time grows long, but this death you cannot cheat your life ends here, when I'm in your backseat time grows long, but this death you cannot cheat your life ends here, when I'm in your backseat I arrive with night, you won't even see it coming ear to ear, I'll make your throat smile drain you flow of life, you get no trial hallowed ground breaks, it holds a sweet scent on your knees, now you repent sellout bitch, I'll bury you alive I'll bury you alive straightedge, we see it so clearly the crime you commit, the punishment I give straightedge, we see it so clearly
