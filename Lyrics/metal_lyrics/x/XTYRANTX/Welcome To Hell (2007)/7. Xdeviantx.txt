the song never stops so loud in my head sickness gives birth to my new instinct your voice what a sweet tone my ears now I find happiness dark but so clear gaze your eyes upon me destroying the life haunting your depths haunting your dreams horrors breath and come from me I creep within the black dealing out death born of the macabre, dance in the night with you I kill, what I delight tonight comes, with it I show all to you I offer, my hand, come and fall I kill for straightedge
