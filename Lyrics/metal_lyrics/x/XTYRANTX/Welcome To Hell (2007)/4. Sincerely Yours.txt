today marks the end of it all today the cycle breaks your depths are revealed to me it is you I've grown to hate fuck you fuck fate this book has yet to close shattered hope, birth in hate no I don't believe in love hate, emotion that's true fuck you, fuck fate I stand with a line drawn in the sand you've stopped dead in your tracks inch by inch, closer to my world I can't just look away
