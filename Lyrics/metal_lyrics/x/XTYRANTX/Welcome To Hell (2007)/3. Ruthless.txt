escaped your clutches through this darkened time my strong convictions your weak addictions pulling everyone into your drama there is no victory without sacrifice the hate I feel for you you fucking bitch I'll pull the trigger it all stops here what I have what I've worked for what I know is lessons learned my family has stood by me my friends drawn blood for me your sky turns black your demons come no turning back your rise will be your fall thorugh thick and thin we struggle but we will win my friends are by my side and we will fight til the end live and die for my beliefs straight fucking edge there is no victory without sacrifice
