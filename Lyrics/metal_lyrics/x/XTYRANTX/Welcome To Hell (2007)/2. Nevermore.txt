cut out my love cut out my love when dusk dies walking this path lonely but content how else could I survive listen to my laughter grow nightmares are my reality wrong is swallowed it's so ugly here I cry please don't tempt me they changed my insides now it's lovely it all starts here motherfucker I can feel a change for tonight we spill blood forced to now smile now it gives me strength I love this hate that hates love
