stolen like a pulse our love lives with dust shadowed from light in the cries you can trust will you complain will you run from my pain when it's so alone and so cold razors through my skin it's cutting my flesh with it life seeps from me razors through my skin it's cutting my flesh with it life seeps from me outrunning death, day to day covered in blood and for you, I'm still waiting a shadow of hope carried lonely, left only to be dreaming bloodsplattered, we sit together on your lips now I whisper, I love you and ask, am I still beautiful
