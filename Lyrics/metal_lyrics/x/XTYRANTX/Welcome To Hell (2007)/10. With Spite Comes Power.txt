in the death of your ways the seasons change a new hate is born inside of me speaks into my ears offers all that I want it says my name and gives me all that I have lost fire takes hold of me no longer the same now I'm above you I once was left behind with help from noone until you came cutting through your fears not letting go reaching up to heights I never thought I could I take this name with you or by myself we can live forever stong I stand, with no shame
