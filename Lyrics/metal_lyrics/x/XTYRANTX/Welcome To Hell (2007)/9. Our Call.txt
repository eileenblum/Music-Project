close my eyes tonight enter and open my dream dry my eyes kill my despair the light is still growing dim now in the dark can you hear my whisper listen, I will show a new strength will you take me forever for this leap of faith we have gone great lengths left here with only ourselves without a light, to lead the way growing through pain inflicted on you the path now lit by our hate we've defined the new right from wrong since when have we wanted regret we've defined the new right from wrong since when have we wanted regret
