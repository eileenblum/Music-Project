Red hopelessness impaled on rocks and trees.
Fallen from cliff's edges, a cursed exit from weakened mortality.
Servants sacrificing their flesh (for soon the soul will be gone).
In the name of nothingness, abduction of your will to live.
Rat-like minions seal the trapped circle and vacant spaces (of a living hell) filled with hate.
Saviour of ruin, obsessed with your decay.
Dying eyes like blood flooded tombs.
A vampiric Christ's hateful reflection.
By a red spell is cast into the deadest of all eyes, release the chains and slash your tr oath.
Eternal black winter left only hate in its never-ending grasp.
The killing shadows of all it was I never lived for.
Injecting hate into despondent minds possessing your decay.
Asphyxiate upon ghastly hidden fear.
