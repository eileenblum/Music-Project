Web made of sinister plots, lobotomized, tortured thoughts
Your words and what is sacred gives me the right to rape you
I want to find, I want to inflict all the pains you forgot to feel
Shadows branded on souls, in minds, subconscious revealed, has nowhere to hide
(Most destructive of shadows made in a graven image of the self)
So be it known, you haven't any belonging.
