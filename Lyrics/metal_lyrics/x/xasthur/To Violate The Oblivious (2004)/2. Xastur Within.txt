Use them, abuse them, bleed them dry, to leave them fiending (weakened and manipulated)
In a lust for sin and a devourment for the living, our dreams connected (and wishes crossed paths)
For she is inside of me, and I in her. Death comes by sleep, be the shadow
to tint the corpses (in which we walk). We'll never be alone in the death
that surrounds us (all felt and seenthough the same eye). Let me parallel
your ancient ways. I will kill for you, if only you for me. Their poison,
our abyss had risen. Veins strengthen and hate is the will to live, shadows
of human suffering have found a home, watered with blackened blood for
extinction to grow. Poison my human heart, for you were created to rid me of
this human shell, to feel your murderess touch and lack of emotion.
