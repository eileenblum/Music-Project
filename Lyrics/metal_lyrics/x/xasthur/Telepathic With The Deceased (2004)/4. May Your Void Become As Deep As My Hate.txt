Let your granted wishes torture you
As paradise is nowhere to hide
Tormenting black shadows are the remains
Even after you find the "light"
The key to my energy is to kill you with your will to live
For your screams awaken my dying soul
Drawing spells and gates in blood
Opening to a horror unseen
Our reality dwells in your nightmares
A new religion of suicide to enter the exit
