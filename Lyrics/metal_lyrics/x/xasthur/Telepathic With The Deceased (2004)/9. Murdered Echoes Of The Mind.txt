Kill the human nature inside
Internal force says goodbye
Let your soul die
Using death to silence my thoughts
Cannot live in the human way
Remaining alive to feel regret
Murder the minds voice that doesn't listen
Cause it to hear the bleeding of your brain, the bleeding of your soul
(Killing the other screaming being within)
May the darkest side of time find you in all the wrong moments
The eye (shines like a blade) watches above your sleep

Saw an opening and raped you of the mind
In places darkest at the dawn is where they hide
And darkness travels fast
Let it poison your weak grip on life
Loss of all need
Hate for love
End of life
Will break the chain and cause you to be free.
