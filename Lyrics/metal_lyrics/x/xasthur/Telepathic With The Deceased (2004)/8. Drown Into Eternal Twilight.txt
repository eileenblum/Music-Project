Who they are, who they once were is what they fear
(Murdered by those they hold near)
In a new age without a planet to rebuild
The end of the earth served as my rebirth
It will fall to pieces
Yet some await that dawn
Falling of a weak empire that stood too long
So be the voice of death to haunt me
They'll open their window and they won't see their world anymore.
