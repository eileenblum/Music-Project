Through malevolent Scylla, Charybdis graves
Our conquesting spirits pour forth, unassuaged
Occultnesses watch us and Seraph, afraid
Like fireflies olunge to Her maw, midst crashing black waves

"Remember with pride what thou art
Lest we forget in awe of our terrible past"

When Dark royalties drank of despair
Idols hewed down 'neath a desert god's stare
In thrall to revenges sworn there
What dreams could we father, when farther we fell
To nightmare?
