Take a look into my eyes and witness a blackish emptiness you've never seen before
A unique horror to anyone who hasn't seen what's beyond infinity

Trapped in a labyrinth of madness, a gallery of hate
Beyond the edge of sanity, a wonderland insane

Welcome to my world
Where feelings disappear
No sorrows and no pleasures
Just a dreadful paradise of emptiness

Take a look into my soul and lose yourself - no way to escape
Now you're trapped as me and myself, a one way ticket to insanity

Trapped in a labyrinth of madness, a gallery of hate
Beyond the edge of sanity, a wonderland insane

Welcome to my world
Where feelings disappear
No sorrows and no pleasures
Just a dreadful paradise of emptiness
