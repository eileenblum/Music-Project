More than a thousand times I played it in my mind
The game of hunter and deer
I followed your track, my senses were sharp
To satisfy my desire to kill

But when I trapped you and you couldn't run away
Somehow I felt pity for you

I turn away and question myself
A conflict of instinct and mind
Which is the right way to choose?
Does reason protect or harm myself?

I wipe my doubts away, the hunt starts over again
I follow your track, my senses are sharp
To satisfy my desire to kill

Once more I trap you and you can't run away
Now there's no pity I could feel

I tear your flesh and you scream in fear and knowledge of death
There's no escape for you as your blood falls on the ground
I made my way through my doubts, the dominance of reason is gone
I follow my instinct, it's the rule of nature I can't ignore
