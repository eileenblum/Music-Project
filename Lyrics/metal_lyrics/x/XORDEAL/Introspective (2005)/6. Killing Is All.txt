Here I stand, a broken man
Betrayed by the people that I called my friends
Now they're gone - I've sent them to hell
I'm not the jester of a system to fail

I trusted them all - they broke my neck
Now they're gone and they won't come back
You'll suffer the pain - I'll give it to you
You'll suffer eternally for my rage is cruel

Splattered corpses lie on the floor
Is there anyone left? - I'm hungry for more
My vengeance was bitter, bloody and hard
They should have known better - killing is art

I twist my knife into their hearts
I hear their screams - they make ma laugh
Their fear is my pleasure, my nectar divine
I am the priest of death - this is my sacrifice

Blood stains my hands, my clothes and my face
Drips from my fingers and pours from their veins
Runs down my throat as I devour their hearts
Slaughter is beautiful and killing is art
