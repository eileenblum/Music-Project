Did you ever think of what lurks inside of me?
A mighty roaring demon waiting to be unleashed
Embodiment of human fears, hatred and disgust
Finally your worst nightmares 'came true in me

Burning acid runs my veins
My spit will singe your skin
A creature from the pits of hell
Raping burning death infame

Torture - all life on earth
You'll get what you have gained
Invoke - your final days
Purgatory's on the way

Taste the pain and feel the grind
Driving you insane
There's no mercy in my mind
I'll make you feel the pain

My hands will crush your backbone and they will turn your face
Into a haze of blood and scatter your remains
They will squish your guts and pulverize your brain
There's no death to release you, you'll suffer endless pain

Taste the pain and feel the grind
Driving you insane
There's no mercy in my mind
I'll make you feel the pain

Torture - all life on earth
You'll get what you have gained
Invoke - your final days
Purgatory's on the way
