We forge our lives in the fire of lies
With the hammer of falseness on the anvil of disguise
Cruelty is our blade, irony our shield
We cover ourselves in an armor of cynism

This state already lasts too long
The armies of falseness still grow
I'm not the only one to know
There's no saviour to come

We have arrived in an epoch of unlight
Where saints are made of sin
Decay of moral, the old ideal's perversion
The age of mental darkness is to be here

One day I was to find out
You already were one of them
A victim of you own illusion
Without a trait of your own

I lost myself in a hole of depression
Asked myself how I could be so wrong
But there was no answer
And nobody would ever know

What is it that makes mankind walk this way
Say "truth is not my confession"
"there's no right and there's no wrong"
We're consuming our own decay

This state already lasts too long
The armies of falseness still grow
I'm not the only one to know
There's no saviour to come

We have arrived in an epoch of unlight
Where saints are made of sin
Decay of moral, the old ideal's perversion
The age of mental darkness is to be here
