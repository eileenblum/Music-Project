This life took the best of me
No joy, no smiles
This world destroyed a part of me
I feel empty inside

No joy, no smiles
I feel dead inside

Trapped,
Trapped in this system
No way out

Define humanity to me
Pain and lies is all I see
Define humanity to me
Pain and lies is all I see

Society's progress,
Mankind's decline
Science keeps the weak alive

There's no way to be positive
When we open our eyes
So on keep on our blindfold
Afraid of the lies

Use your head and see the truth
There's no future for me nor you
Too late for us to repent
Too late for us as men

Too late for us as men
Too late
