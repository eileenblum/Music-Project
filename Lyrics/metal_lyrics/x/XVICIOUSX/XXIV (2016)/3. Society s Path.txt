Society is the product of humanity's view
The youth is suffering.
Egotistic minds are nothing new

A race to the top,
They think they're the best
Laughing with the struggle
And pain of the rest
Money in hands, no troublesome life
While others suffer to survive

They don't care about the weak,
The masses, the poor
Who search for a future,
Before a closed door?
They don't care about the weak,
The masses, the poor
Found a desperate solution,
Found crime as a cure

The world is fucking doomed.
The youth is lost
Innocent people are paying the cost
We cannot deny that this life is a fight
But how do we survive
If we're blind to what's right?

You are what you are? Well, look at me
I'm not the machine they want me to be
With a society as the devil,
Humanity is damned
But I fucking dare to take a stand

You are what you are?
Well, look at me
I'm not the machine
They want me to be

Because I rather be dead
Than to walk society's path
Because I rather be fucking dead
Than to walk society's path
