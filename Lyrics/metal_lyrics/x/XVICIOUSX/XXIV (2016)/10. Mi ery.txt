Give them life, not misery

Remember those things you told
About living a life so cold
You were fed with a silver spoon
A life of wealth is what you hold

You are swimming in money (money money)
Each day of yours is so damn sunny
You never stood in the rain
While others are sleeping in the drain

Each day they dig for gold,
In the pockets of others.
Their soul so cold.
Promised a better world,
Do you still believe the lies they told?

Give them life, not misery.
Caring for others? Are you kidding me?

Be realistic, make your own way
Some people are living from day to day
Try to makes this life on your own
Reality is hard when you're all alone

You are swimming in money
(money money)
Each day of yours is so damn sunny
