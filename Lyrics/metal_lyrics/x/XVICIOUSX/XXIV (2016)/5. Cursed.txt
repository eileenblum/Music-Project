No love for yourself, only a heart full of hate,
For your salvation it is way too late

Swallowed by the darkness,
Good friends with solitude and emptiness.
Betrayed everyone that ever cared,
Forgot all those times that we shared

No pity, no feelings, no shame
I will forever curse your name!

You are just an empty shell
Of what you once were before that day
When did you choose to walk
The darkest way? The darkest way!

I despise you, can't look you in the face.
You're just another disgrace.

Fuck you and your blackened heart
You will never tear me apart
I will forever curse your name
You are the only one to blame

Curse your name
Cursed
