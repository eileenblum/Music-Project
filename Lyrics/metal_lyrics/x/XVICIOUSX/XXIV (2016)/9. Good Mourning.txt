[feat. Gerardo Bodybag]Working every single second
Just to please others
Allowing them to live the dream
While I'm the one who bothers

Don't they feel any shame?
Just taking and taking
Filled with false promises
I'm breaking, aching, immolating

I am burning
Slowly my body turns into ash
My hands have become the tinder
That lights to flesh

There isn't any hope left inside of me
The world, is smouldering in front of my eyes
Burning on their godforsaken lies

I am finished, I am done
I won't be missed
I am the forgotten son
I am fire, I am death
You won't have my last breath
Burn my coffin when I'm gone
No memories survive
I'm the non important one

A good mourning to you all
Without my shoulders
You all shall fall

I am fire, I am death
You won't have my last breath
