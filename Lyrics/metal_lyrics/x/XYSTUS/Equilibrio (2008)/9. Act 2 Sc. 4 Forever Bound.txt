[Diegu:]
I stand at the edge
A heightened state of consciousness
Yes, I've come to believe
new found clarity in me

This fate - surely befits me
I'll be here - as long as I should be
No longer in doubt
I've squandered my time
To find out who am I

Forever bound to this life
Be it blessed, cursed for all time

I no longer try to find myself,
in search for meaning
I found calm within the storm inside

Be it blessed, cursed for all time
I no longer try

I stand at the edge
Gaze upon the broken shreds
of a whole that once was
Try to join two worlds apart

Forever bound to this life
Be it blessed, cursed for all time

I no longer try to find myself
In search for meaning
I found calm within the storm inside

Be it blessed, cursed for all time
I no longer try

Be it blessed, cursed for all time
