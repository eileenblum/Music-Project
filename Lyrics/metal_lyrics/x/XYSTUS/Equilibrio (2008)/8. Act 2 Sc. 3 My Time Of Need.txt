[Aveline:]
I still remember -
when I put my faith in you
Every prayer I made would help me
follow through...

I have been robbed of my saviour and my guide
And now I am left alone, in solitude I hide...

Once upon a time,
I thought we shared a dream
Now only echoes remain

I turned to you in my time of need
And where were you
Was it all in vain?

I still believe -
a new dawn may arrive
Every step I take, brings me closer to
what I strive

And now I stand alone... Forsaken but
still with pride
Please give me a sign, I need you by
my side

Once upon a time,
I thought we shared a dream
Now only echoes remain
I turned to you in my time of need
And where were you
Was it all in vain?

[Diegu:]
I hear your silent cries
Yes, I've failed to be all I can
I'll be there to guide you through,
I swear!
Now I see...

[Diegu, Aveline:]
I see there's more that meets the eye
More than just a fragile soul
I know now who to be
Now we are free

[Aveline:]
You'll be here... in my time of need

[Diegu:]
I'll be here... in your time of need

[Diegu, Aveline:]
Once upon a time we shared a dream
A dream that'll never die...
