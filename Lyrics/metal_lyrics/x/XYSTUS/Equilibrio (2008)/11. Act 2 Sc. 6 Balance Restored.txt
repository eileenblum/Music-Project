[Diegu:]
I see two souls
One is sorry, both are hurt
But I see much more
than meets the eye
I look far beyond;
and see two as one...

Aveline, just look at him
He's a changed man, born anew
Can you find it in your heart
to forgive?

[Aveline:]
Don't know what to think of this
So much has been said and done
Don't know what to make of this
It's bound to turn out wrong

Primos:
I can't blame you
Expecting you to trust, is just too
much...

[Aveline:]
How can I believe you?
When I still don't understand...
The path you choose in life has led
you bargaining with Death

[Primos:]
I can't blame you
Expecting you to trust, just might be...

[Aveline:]
Too much to ask, hard to admit

[Primos:]
I hope she is true to

Aveline, Primos:
These feelings we try to resist

[Aveline:]
Too much to hide, I can't keep inside

[Primos:]
I hope she can see

[Aveline, Primos:]
We're feeling the same

[Aveline:]
Somehow connected,
somehow our fates seem

[Primos:]
Two hearts beat as one, we're

[Aveline, Primos:]
Entwined 'till the end of all time

Two souls revealing what has been foretold:
The balance's restored
