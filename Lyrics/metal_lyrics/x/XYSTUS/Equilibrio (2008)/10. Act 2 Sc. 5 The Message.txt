[Emperor Primos:]
No matter what I do
This craving never seems to fade
Death made me envy him
The aching wore my patience thin
I thrive on my rage
The hours seemed days as I thought:
"Yes... Death is a Godsend,
for power sooths my pain..."

[Diegu:]
You can't say you're healing
It's ought to feel nice... pretty good
To see all those beneath you
Blaming their God - instead of you

Primos you've been fooled
You're Dreath's recruit - merely a tool
He promised you a cure
To fix the void inside your soul...

Alas... this isn't so
Your mind has been tricked by the
Serpent's tongue
You've merely become what he'd
seen in you:
A pawn of Death

[Emperor Primos:]
You think I'm so naive?
No - Death won't trick me!
But why do I feel strange?
I seem to hesitate

A voice inside my head
Why won't it leave me be?
I feel... I know...

[Diegu:]
Primos you've been fooled
You're Death's recruit - merely a tool
He promised you a cure
To fix the void inside your soul

A heart corrupted by evil

[Emperor Primos:]
I can't let go... It's like I'm not in
control

[Diegu:]
Believe... you have the strength to break free...

[Emperor Primos:]
I'm ashamed of what I became
throughout the years

[Diegu:]
Know this:
there is no fate
but what we make for ourselves
all can change
when the mind is the heart
be one in body and soul
Go back - to the moment you chose
your dark ways
Go back and relive all those moments
of fear
Relinquish yourself from the chains of
the past
And you'll be freed from Death

[Death:]
Primos - don't you dare betray me
Diegu tells you nothing lies

Think of the man
I have let you become
I gave you life - through me you've
survived
I gave you all - when nothing was left
but dust

I was the one who offered you
A chance to see it all anew
I gave you might beyond compare
I will avenge myself - I swear

[Diegu:]
Oh, it has been a burden to carry

[Emperor Primos:]
I will learn...
to med the future I shattered

[Diegu:]
What lies ahead...
where do you wish to begin?

Emperor Primos:
Lead the way,
I wish to speak to Aveline
