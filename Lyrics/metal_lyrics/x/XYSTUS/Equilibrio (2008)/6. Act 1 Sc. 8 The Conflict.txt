[Diegu:]
Aveline, I'm glad you wish to end this status quo

[Aveline, Diegu:]
On our way to find a way

[Aveline:]
To set away our differences
My heart is true, I hope my adversary
feels just like I do

[Diegu:]

No one knows what lies ahead
[Ensemble:]
Primos and Aveline joining hands?

[Diegu:]
Peace at last, that is unless he pretends

[Lord Primos:]
Aveline, so glad you're here - now
where do I begin
In a way, we both want change
I too am tired of this fight
Yes, in the end I'm sure you'll come to
terms with all that serves you right

[Diegu:]
No one knows what lies ahead

[Ensemble:]
Primos and Aveline joining hands?

[Diegu:]
Peace at last, that is unless he pretends

[Aveline:]
You might pretend to be someone I can
rely on - it's so hard
You might pretend to be someone I can
rely on

[Lord Primos:]
Trust in me
Yes, my heart is true
And believe the things I reveal to you
Please, trust in me
Yes, my heart is true
And believe the things I reveal to you

[Diegu:]
May fortune smile upon us all

[Death:]
The time has come - you know what
must be done

[Lord Primos:]
Yes - I know, no reason to be hasty

[Death:]
Don't be a fool - you have to follow through

[Lord Primos:]
I am aware - just sharpening my senses

[Death:]
His eyes turn red, his hatred grows...
grows
To quench his thirst he will spill blood...
Blood

[Lord Primos:]
Aveline, it's all so clear
The future begins here
It's a time for new ideas
We'll set away our differences
The heart is true, I am sincere - just tell
me what you want to hear

[Diegu:]
No one knows what lies ahead

[Ensemble:]
Primos and Aveline joining hands?

[Diegu:]
Peace at last, that is unless he pretends

[Aveline:]
You might pretend to be someone I can
rely on - it's so hard
You might pretend to be someone I can
rely on

[Lord Primos:]
Trust in me
Yes, my heart is true
And believe the things I reveal to you
Please, trust in me
Yes, my heart is true
And believe the things I reveal to you

[Diegu:]
May fortune smile upon us all

Aveline, [Diegu:]
A new dawn arrives
When we turn the page
And truly change our ways

[Lord Primos:]
Could it be really all I need,
is to feed my hunger for power?
Could it be really all I need - is to feed?

[Aveline, Lord Primos:]
We share a common fate: our lives
are intertwined
For all time...

[Lord Primos:]
Unless... I intervene... and take control...
Yes... that's it: I will fill the void inside
my soul... with power... I must!
My heart: an empty shell... goodbye
Aveline... I have chosen my path
Now grand me strength!

[Death:]
Yes...

[Diegu:]
This will be your last mistake Primos!

[Death:]
No!

[Diegu:]
Hurry Aveline, we must leave at once!

[Lord Primos:]
Intertwined... for all time...

[Death:]
Rise!
