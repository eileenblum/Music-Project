[Aveline:]
All my life, I've put my trust in my believe
A miracle: with faith, you can achieve...
For years now, we're suppressed
by the evil that lives behind these walls...

[Aveline's followers:]
Lord Primos, we promise you:
your empire shall fall

[Aveline:]
If only he would see, he would have a
change of heart!
We have followed you throughout our lives
Fighting for the cause that we claim right
Why won't they understand
It's not much we demand
It's just a point of view that makes us
stand, divide

[Lord Primos::]
All my life, I've put my trust in my blade
You disagree? I dare you to differentiate!
These rebels, these traitors!
We shall crush them one by one!

Aveline, I'm disappointed in what you have become...
Why won't you see, why won't you have a
change of heart?

[Lord Primos' followers:]
We have followed you throughout our lives

[Lord Primos:]
Why won't she see just what I am doing here
I've put my faith aside to make this
world a stronger place

[Aveline:]
Why won't he see just what I am doing here
His mind is corrupted with might...

[Lord Primos:]
I've stood for my believes throughout my life
Fighting for what I thought would be right

[Aveline's followers:]
We have followed you throughout our lives
Fighting for the cause that we claim right

[Aveline, Aveline's followers:]
Why won't they understand
It's not much we demand
It's just a point of view that makes us
stand, divide
