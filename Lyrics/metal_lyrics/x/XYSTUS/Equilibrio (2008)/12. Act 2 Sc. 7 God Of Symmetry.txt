[Diegu:]
Try to think of something,
she must have overlooked
Apparently my life has turned out
just the way it should
I wish that I could prove,
I'm in control of my life
But I just can't be sure of this:
Sophia you were right
I am glad, looking back
No, I don't hold a grudge
You proved to be a friend indeed:
Someone I could trust

[Lady Sophia:]
Diegu I've always known
Together we're so much more
Will you take your place with me?
Diegu I offer you
A purpose, your life renewed:
A place next to me, eternally -
as God of Symmetry

[Diegu:]
I'd never thought she'd offer me
A place among the Gods:
"Protector of the Balance" -
an inconceivable reward
To rise above all life,
Above all things I've ever known
I really to think this through
Before I make my choice

[Lady Sophia:]
Diegu I've always known
Together we're so much more
Will you take your place with me?
Diegu I offer you
A purpose, your life renewed:
A place next to me, eternally -
as God of Symmetry

[Diegu:]
The more I try to picture it,
the more it seems
to drift away from me...
The more I try to picture it...

[Lady Sophia:]
Place yourself next to me...

[Diegu:]
"Protector of Balance",
to rule right next to you
To live beside my Goddess -
is this what I must do?

[Lady Sophia:]
Your choices led you here
The path has come to end
Whatever lies ahead
Is yours to decide
Diegu I've always known
Together we're so much more
Will you take your place with me?
Diegu I offer you
A purpose, your life renewed:
A place next to me, eternally -
as God of Symmetry
Next to me...

[Diegu:]
I ask you Sophia... honour my choice
I wasn't made a God and do not
choose to become one
I wish to roam among the living,
it is who I am and choose to be

[Lady Sophia:]
Very well, Diegu... now -
return my brave traveller, dear friend

[Diegu:]
I wasn't sure
Of where I stood, who I was
Those days are gone
And I am sure to tell the tale
For all time, for all time...
