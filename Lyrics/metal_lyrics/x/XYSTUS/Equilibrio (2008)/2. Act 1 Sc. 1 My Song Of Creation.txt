[Lady Sophia:]
I am all of that which is not shaped by it's past
The beginning, the end, everything in between
My mind creates, divides, separates...
A burden for all time
I've found peace within myself
which truly isn't mine
Look into my eyes
Infernal passion pends
Let my song of creation commence

[Part II Creation]

[Lady Sophia:]
A scorching earth a blinding sky,
I close my eyes and visualise
In a vigilante storm the shape seems to appear
I breathe the wind, my tears fill the lakes
a part of me starts to be
In this vast symphony the melody is clear

Ancient spells I whisper
Moulding clay to live
Creating skies and seas

All the beauty in my world
All that is honest and is true
I will pour into you, my Sister
The guardian of all that is good
This task I appoint to you
Cherish it, remember it

For every right is wrong
For every light is darkness
For every day is night
For every song is silence

[Ensemble:]
For every right is wrong
For every day is night
Ancient spells I whisper
Moulding clay to live
Forging light and darkness
Fasten their emotions
to live forever free
