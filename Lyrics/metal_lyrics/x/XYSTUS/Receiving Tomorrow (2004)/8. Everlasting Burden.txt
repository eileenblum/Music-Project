We seize the day
Safely guided on our way
Clambering up before we sink to drown

Our beings disposable
We were meant for a bigger cause
This burden is carried by us
Hesitation and weakness we know not

We seize the day
Because tomorrow might be taken away
Forever and evermore
Lifting the everlasting burden

Who will be there for for us
When the burden weighs too much
In years we'll be sinking away
Sinking away to drown

We seize the day
Because tomorrow might be taken away
Forever and evermore
Lifting the everlasting burden
