Lightning has struck again
The time is here
I can't deny this secret no more
Long gone and forgotten years

They've led to downfall
And will be our ruin in the end

Our fortune's told to me
I reveal the future
Expect the inevitable
Long gone and forgotten years

They've led to downfall
And will be our ruin in the end
