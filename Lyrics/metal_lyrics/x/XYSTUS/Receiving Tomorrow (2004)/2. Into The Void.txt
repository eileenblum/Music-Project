Awakened by this light
I heard the cry divide
Sealed my lies with might
As I hurried back in time
To save the light to shine
The sign!

Fall with me into infinity
Come with me to change reality

Now I feel no longer alone
I live through every soul
Into the void
And I known I'm destined to be
I can't neglect the things I've seen

Offended by my kind 
In shame I live again
Travelling through the void
Diving into the unknown
Inside I'll see...
