Silently I cried a thousand tears
I tried but failed relentlessly
Yes I tried, but lacked the power to disagree
Why did you turn your back on me?

Stunned... Dazed...
I loathe the choice you've made
Stone cold you gaze back at me
How I tried to persuade you of my reality
All in vain, deafened by all my pain

Even the blind could see
Despair is written in your eyes
In time the wounds will heal
Stepping out won't serve you right

I'll have to face the truth now
Despair is all that serves me right
In time I only fade away
Become a shadow of today
