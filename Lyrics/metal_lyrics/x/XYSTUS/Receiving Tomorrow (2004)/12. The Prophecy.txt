The chosen have spoken
Tomorrow we'll reign again 
The tide is closing in
Now we're lost into disbelief

It's slipping through my hands
Heading towards the abyss

It's cast upon ourselves
We're liars in disguise
It's cast upon ourselves
Now look into my eyes...

Do you live by the prophecy
As foretold so long ago?

The chosen have spoken
Tomorrow we'll turn the page
Together we'll break this chain
And all our faith shall be obtained

But it's slipping, through our hands
Heading towards the abyss

It's cast upon ourselves
We're liars in disguise
It's cast upon ourselves
Now look into my eyes

Do you live by the prophecy
As foretold so long ago?
The ever-burning questions
They keep on knocking at my door
