Make the pain go away
I kiss the tears from your face

Damn these tears
Burning in my soul
Curse this pain
I don't want to live alone

All the anger, pain and tears
Refusal, denial and wasted years
It's not yet right don't leave me now

A tale of the heart
Broken with a promise
Three empty words
I miss you can't your see?

All the anger, pain and tears
Refusal, denial and wasted years
It's not yet right don't leave me now

I'll let you go
Cold as it may seem
I watch your face
Slowly fade away

A tale of the heart

Reach out for me in time
You better hear my cries
Why won't your rescue me
From all the lies withing I see?

All the anger, pain and tears
Refusal, denial and wasted years
It's not yet right don't leave me now

Don't leave me

So many things unsaid
But now it's all over
Ash to ash, dust to dust
Not even burried, but already lost
Will I see you again?
The silence hears the unbroken
