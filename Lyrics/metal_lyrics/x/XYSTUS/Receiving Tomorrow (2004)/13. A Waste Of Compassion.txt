Wait... Prey...
Patience is the answer
Praise your conscience
For I was left alone

Again brutish necessity
Wipes its hands upon the napkin
Of a dirty cause again
A waste of compassion

But just you wait 
Just you wait
Now I am hurting too

You act divine when taking the pain alone
I run away, but I'm taking the fall

Grief... Hate...
And I've got you to blame
Praise your conscience
For I was left alone

Again brutish necessity
Wipes its hands upon the napkin
Of a dirty cause again
A waste of compassion

You act divine when taking the pain alone
I run away, but I'm taking the fall

You act divine when taking the pain alone
I run away, but I'm taking the fall and I take you down with me
