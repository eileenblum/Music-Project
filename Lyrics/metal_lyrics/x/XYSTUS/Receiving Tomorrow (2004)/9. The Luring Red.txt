Say farewell before you greet me
Every encounter may be your last
As I crawl up from behind
You say your prayer, better say them fast

Come into my dominion
Where you know you don't belong
The eerie silence's has been broken
By the opening of a door

Red eyes stare back at me
Tongues point from behind
Rats crawl from out of nowhere
They may be your only guide

The choice is yours to make
My friend I leave it up to you
The path is yours to take
Either way, you're my destiny

The shape of my contour appears
I desire the youth you'll bring
Quivering you behold the me
I will prolong your destiny

Red eyes stare back at me
Tongues point from behind
Rats crawl from out of nowhere
They may be your only guide

The choice is yours to make
My friend I leave it up to you
The path is yours to take
Either way, you're my destiny

craving the youth
The red lures
The blood divine
Swallow the life

The choice is yours to make
My friend I leave it up to you
The path is yours to take
Either way, you're my destiny
