I admit to cry and scream
Can't this merely be a dream
Didn't believe what they say
But now we're seperated by death 
Our characters the same
One's fault the other's blame
Now that you're gone and I'm alone
It's pale where the sun once shone

All the things that we have been through
Sorrow and joy I gave you
Living by each other's strength
I knew you, you knew the me
It all happened way too fast
I can't accept this ain't no end
You must be hiding somewhere 
No please God this ain't fair

Why me?
I'm being swallowed by these questions
Why me?
Shivers down my spine
Why me?
I'm being punished for no reason
Why me?
Lost in misery

There are things you can't control
Before you know it claims you whole
Letting go might seem the worst part
Think again when grief's tearing you apart
Try remembering the good things
Still submit yourself to sadness
Because he who pushes all away
Severely suffers every day

Why me?
I'm being swallowed by these questions
Why me?
Shivers down my spine
Why me?
I'm being punished for no reason
Why me?
Lost in misery

All shaken I awake
The nightmares in my sleep
Dreams of you I cannot rest
Scared of the person I knew best
Cold and left behind
The one I loved ain't here tonight
I'll pay for a visit therefore instead
I feel relieved facing my own death

Why me?
I'm being swallowed by these questions
Why me?
Shivers down my spine
Why me?
I'm being punished for no reason
Why me?
Lost in misery
