Authorization for an exorcism

Condemned, by the spirit that overwhelms you
It taunts your body
Release it now [2x]

Clocks stop making you realize, possession is behind a filthy corner
An act of Hell itself
Tearing away your family

Less than death

I am not the person I was before

This is a punishment

For taking it away
