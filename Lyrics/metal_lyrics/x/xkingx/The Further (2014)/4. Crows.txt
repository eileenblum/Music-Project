Submit yourself to this demon
Relinquish light &amp; give in

Glass shattering with the impact of your death
Murder in the air with sounds of silence

You are nothing now

Taken away from life

Face your fate

Blackened wings &amp; stench of putrid flesh
Surrounding clouds &amp; swirling winds of the end
Take back your morality

Cries of pain &amp; wounds that seem to never heal
Waste of space, a vessel for this thing to fill

Murder them, a mass of haunted shrieks

Tired of something overtaking you?
Making you feel weak inside your own filthy flesh
Mutilating your soul from the inside out

This is what you've become
