She weeps, we weep at the sight of the destruction around us

Twisting minds of ones careless enough to think for themselves
Mutilating thoughts &amp; making them feel like they're weak
You're in Hell

Time has become before we realized that we have reached our fate
Blackened blood, tortured screams
Waste of space you said, a hand laid across his face
Mother of death

With everything I know about the end
Is dead
Make me feel unwilling
Make me feel alive?

I only feel nothing

You are the filth at the edge of my fingertips
Fuck

My fucking life had crumbled
So what will make me believe this now?

End everything
Please
Release me

This is what you have done to my life
This is it
