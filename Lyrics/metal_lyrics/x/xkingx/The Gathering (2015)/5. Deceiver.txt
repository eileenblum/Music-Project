[feat. Anthony Alexander of Rex]The world is ending, yet life has just begun
Forget everything, but use your head for this is done

So tell me now

[Anthony]
You thought you had it all figured out
We will see what you have learned from all of this

The things I see are an illusion to me
Erase everything but let it still sink in
[Anthony]
Hide behind your mask of fear
The truth comes out &amp; you're left with nothing

Wake up or just die
Fess up to your lies

Alone
Afraid
Be gone
Erase

Let loose of everything
C.P.S.E.
Bring the fucking hate

Quit being a sheep
Way to go, just think for yourself
Go ahead &amp; make us think
That you know what you're talking about
Bring it to the streets
Talk's cheap, so come &amp; hit me

[Anthony]
When we're face to face
We'll see if you're as tough as you think
So bring it to the streets
Talk's cheap so come at me

Bring the hate [2x]
Set them straight
Bring the hate
