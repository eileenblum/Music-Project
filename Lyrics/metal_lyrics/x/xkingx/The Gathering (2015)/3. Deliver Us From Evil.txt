[feat. Julian Kersey of Aegaeon]Seeing what cannot be unseen
The gaze of death that is glaring and staring
Blackened eyes with a porcelain face
A hint of darkness so the stench is unleashed

Sounds screeching from inside the walls
The script rattling against your eardrums
Causing a curse to ensure your possession
Welcome to this life

Just think
Think how things used to be
Just breathe
Take a breath of Hell into your being

A collection of ones that have been enslaved
Causing decryption for them to mutilate
Your skin &amp; bones have become erased
Evil enters &amp; takes all that was made

Arise, from the depths of the black
A churning boiling feeling, a sense of emptiness
Losing your fear of dying &amp; fade into your head

Look
Look at what has been dormant here
False guidance
Misdirection
Has released the evil from within

Now I've been released

Black-hearted &amp; full of so much rage
Overwhelming
Once known through time &amp; space

[Julian]
I, infinite
Destroyed everything
Randomizing points of destruction
Time dissolves as reality bends
Infinite chaos
Send me forth into the limitless abyss
Abyss

I, infinite
Destroyed everything
[2x]
