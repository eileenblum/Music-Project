[feat. Nick Arthur of Molotov Solution]Knives in which you slash your skin
Rusted blades torment the flesh from within
Keep cutting now, show yourself what you have learned

Unleash the misery &amp; wait for you shall see

Falter
At the waves of the pouring blood
Extinguish the pain

[Nick]
Close your eyes, &amp; let the darkness swallow you whole
You're dead inside
At the end of a crimson
Let the light flow, through the fire
Now you're all alone
In the pit of non-existence
An empty host
A soulless ghost

For hopeless ones, you are the lowest form

I am the reaper of the dead
I am the voice inside your head
I am the one to end everything
Causing the death of another weakling

[Nick]
For this has now changed everything

Eliminate the veins from inside

[Nick]
Rest easy, knowing the torment that's now done
To let your failure be shown to the world
[2x]
