Your passion to win was false Now you'll fall, like the rest This two-faced shit, gets too old Old enough to want to die You fucked around with misery Its gonna turn on you like the rest of Us when we found out who you really Where, and who you denied to be Open up your eyes and swallow your lies I will have vengeance upon you There will be no mercy on you Taste my blood motherfucker Count your lies Your lies, stole your life Your passion to win was false Now you'll fall, like the rest Reno straight edge Bleed by my side, bleed right by my side
