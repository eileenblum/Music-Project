You're just a cheap date Theres nothing left to say when Your innocence is forever gone plagued our scene with filth and STD's Cheap turns too slut, know that you Did this to yourself Your just a bitch in every way there Is and for the record your make up looks like shit What now? without your scene Your just another face in my crowd Your dead inside, your painted looks Can't hide the filth that eats you away Your just a cheap date The cheapest they get One...Two...Three...Whore! Cheap date, you gave good girls a bad name
