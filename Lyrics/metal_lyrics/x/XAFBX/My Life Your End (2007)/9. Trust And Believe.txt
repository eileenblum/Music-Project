Just let me go down, my own road Till the fucking end my x's go Down with me Deeper then my own grave Further then you could ever see Since you sold out, you proved Your fucking weakness, just a train Wreck to the end, sell out From the beginning Fuck your regrets This one life I live I won't throw Away, all you ever wanted was a Life of misery Straight edge Goes deeper then my grave Straight edge Theres no other fucking way
