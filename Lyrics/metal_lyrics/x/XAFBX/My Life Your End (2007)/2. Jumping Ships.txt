This is where I'm from This is where I belong You will never know Reno straight edge We will never fall Reno straight edge The tragedy of your friends giving up Will be the hardest thing in life to Comprehend, this stops here Start jumping ships, sellouts always sink A thousand fucking time We took your knifes in our backs One too many times we've taken your ass back Your bridge has burned right to my fucking ground
