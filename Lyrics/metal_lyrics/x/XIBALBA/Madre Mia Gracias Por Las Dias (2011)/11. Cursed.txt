Let the day of my birth be cursed
Let the day be forever forgotten
Curse this life and this city
Struggling for a breath
Struggling for answers
I roam the streets
Blind with no fucking purpose
Just let it all come fucking crashing down
Why pray on tainted altars
Dear saints hear no screams
Just let the darkness of the night be permanent
This life
Why didn't I die at birth?
This life
Curse it for it's failures
Let the day of my birth be cursed
Let the day be forever forgotten
If only I had died
I'd be quiet
Asleep and at rest
Let the day be cursed
Let the day be forgotten
Let the day come crashing down
Put me to rest
