Rain blood
May the earth be covered with a blanket of red
Rain blood
May you all die in red
Rain blood
Letting every once of blood drain
Filling the seas and valleys with blood
Avalanches of blood
Crashing down
Leaving the desert hot
Sand soaked in red
Rain blood
Let it all be fucking red
May I only see red
Let it all be red
Dare to see forever
Rain blood
Letting everything bed red
At the end I will stand on the highest mountain
With a grin on my fucking face
