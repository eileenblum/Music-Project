This land has been cursed
Plagued by famine and disease
The gods are punishing our dynasty
Do you hear the calls of the priests?
The divine wish to feast on human sacrifices
Listen to the screams as hearts are dug from bodies
Watch the blood flow down the temple's holy steps
But nothing has changed
Blood has been spilled
Misfortune remains the same
Conquerors have seen our dynasty no longer be
So we wait for death
It could not come soon enough
Our final breath
Never kneel!
To your fucking christ
As he spreads nothing but filth and lies
Hypocrisy rewarded with a crown of thorns
As the legions of people follow
Legions of people look into the eyes of your god as he dies
