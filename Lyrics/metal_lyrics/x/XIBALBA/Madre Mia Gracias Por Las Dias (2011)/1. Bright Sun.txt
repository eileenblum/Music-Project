The sun hasn't got any brighter
And the days haven't got any longer
As the time progresses
My heart seems to get emptier
As the day ends with a sad song
I hang my head low
As I walk the world alone
With my feet dragging and my head hung low
As I walk alone in this cold world
Will there be any hope for me to last?
It always seems like I'm going nowhere fast
So as I look to the sky
Only one thing comes to mind
The sun hasn't got any brighter
