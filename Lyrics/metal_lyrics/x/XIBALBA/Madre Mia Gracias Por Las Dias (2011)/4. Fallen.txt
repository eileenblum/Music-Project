I'm falling hard
Don't worry about me
I'm used to jumping off all the wrong buildings
I always end up face down on the ground
When everything is meant to be broken
Why do we continue with these feelings?
I don't know but I feel so alive
I feel the swelling
Let's just enjoy the moment for it's memories
Let's enjoy the dreams
Cause it's just dreams that I have
I'm falling
Let's enjoy the dream
Cause it's all a fucking dream
I found perfection in imperfections
I found everything I hate
Everything I love
In this
