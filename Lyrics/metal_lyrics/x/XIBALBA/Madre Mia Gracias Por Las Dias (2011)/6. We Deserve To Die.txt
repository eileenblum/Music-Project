I walk the town where we once roamed
Side by side in the once stunning city turned black
And the only thing I found was you underground
Now I drown in this bottle
Knowing it will end and I will be on the prowl
Behind the lies we hide
We die tonight
Behind the lies we hide my friend
For both god and I know we deserve to die
I've been let down and I've been breaking down
It is all done
It is all gone and it's dark here and I'm scared
I've been let down
I've been breaking down
Just let me down the rest of this bottle
And I'll be on my way down
Die tonight
I will be seeing you, my friend
In hell
