My body is eating away
There's nothing that can save me now
The more I try the less I progress
Skin and flesh
That's all that's left
Weakened body and low self-esteem
There's nothing
I keep breathing
I keep me breathing
Keep me alive
I can feel it
My time is almost up
The end is near
Each day is a new struggle
A new way to make it end
Each day is a new struggle
Our day is coming to and end
I'm getting desperate and in too deep
Will I make it to see another day?
To see tomorrow?
To see your face?
My future looks bleak and grim
Death is breathing down my neck
Suffering is the only emotion that fills my body
It is what is keeping me alive and breathing
I can feel it
My time is almost up
The end is near
Suffering is on it's way
Today it is the end
Death is breathing down my neck
Suffering is on it's way
