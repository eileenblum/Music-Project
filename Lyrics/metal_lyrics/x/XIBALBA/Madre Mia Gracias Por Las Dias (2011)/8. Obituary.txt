Finger on the trigger
Barrel to my head
Just seems easier if I were dead
I hate you
Left me here to rot
I'm tired of pretending I'm okay
What do I do when everything continues to fall apart?
Questioning how I've gotten this far
Where do I find happiness?
Searched for far too long
I still sit here
Cold, abandoned by the world
Bottle is done
No hope, no fears, no tears
I'm fucked in the head
But no one will notice
Just pull the trigger
Just do it
Life has given up on me
But I won't let death take me
Left with nothing
No path to follow
I hate you
Fuck the world
It's just me now and I'm after you
Nothing will save you
Eye for an eye
Finger on the trigger
Barrel to your head
It would be better if you were dead
I'm coming for you
