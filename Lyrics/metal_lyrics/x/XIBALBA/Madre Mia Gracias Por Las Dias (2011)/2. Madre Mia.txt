Madre mia gracias por los dias
Aunque sea que los resto de mis diasseran una pesadilla
Quien desea que estos malditos dias seran una pesadilla
Malditos dias
Madre mia gracias por los dias
I've grown sick of this damned world
Chaos surrounds me
All happiness taken from us
Life has raped us
Fear is taking over
How did things get so bad?
Fuck their love
Fuck my trust in them
Fuck everything that seems right
I hate them
I hate everything
Is the world fucked or am I just fucked in the head?
I really don't know
These bones keep shaking
My thoughts keep chasing
My fears keep coming down
I'm sorry but I can't help but feel this way
My hate keeps growing
I'm sorry but I can't keep drowning
My disgust keeps me going
I'm sorry but I can't stop myself
