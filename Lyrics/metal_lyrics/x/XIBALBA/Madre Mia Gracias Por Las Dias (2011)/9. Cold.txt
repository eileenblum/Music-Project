The world is so cold and merciless
I see it as a reminder of myself
The cold lifeless fluid flowing through my body
I see it in me
Numbs my feeling leaves me with no remorse
For what I have done to myself and to others
Looking into bloodstained mirrors with no reflection
Nothing to dwell on but the thought of causing more pain to others
Just like this cold world
Why am I this fucking cold?
Take me out
Burn me now so that I can feel
No hope for me
Burn me now
No hope for me
