Let the arson begin
Bring the flame along with your soul on the stake
Ignite this motherfucker, ignite it all around us
Did you forget who I am, where I stand?
Where I stand, I will die
I am the bastard, I know no love
I am the heathen with no hope
I am the last bastard that will burn the bridge we stand on
So the next time that you let your tongue loose
And threaten the ground I stand on
Think twice who you call friend
Think twice who you stand by
Because I will burn the bridge
Ignite this motherfucker, ignite it all
Did you forget who I am, where I stand?
Where I stand I will die
I am the one who will burn the bridge we stand on
So I can watch you burn
I got a life sentence
Imprisoned in this mind of mine
