Think I'll just fall to pieces
If I don't find something else to do
This sadness never ceases
I'm still in love with you
Darling, darling
Is this the end?

They say time has a way of healing
Dries all the tears from your eyes
But it's this empty feeling
My heart can't disguise

After all that we've been through
I try my best but it's no use
I guess I'll keep loving you
Is this the end?

Think I'll just fall to pieces
If I don't find something else to do
This sadness never ceases
I'm still in love with you
Darling, darling
Is this the end?

Now that it's over
There's something I think you should know
Think it over
One more time before you go
Call on me, call on me
Anything I can do
Help me see it through
