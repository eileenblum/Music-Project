Look into these eyes, tell me what you see
I'm at the brink of insanity
Feed me lies, embrace denial
Who am I?
Who is this that stands before me?
Who am I?
This is what I am, nothing unreal
No soul, no identity
No peace, no serenity
Doomed to walk this earth
Doomed 'til our dying days
Doomed until the end of time
Crush
I am pain, I am sorrow
No path to follow
I am anger, I am faithless
Leading the trails of lies
No soul, no identity
No peace, no serenity
Doomed to walk this earth 'til our dying days
