I wasn't meant to be a saint, as faith has failed me
With my heart on this altar, for the world to fucking see
I let the trail of lies fall down my face
For the sake of days ahead, I'll embrace the end to come
I wasn't meant to be loved, never knew what is was
Words I want to hear just to know how it fucking feels
I never seem to do things right, but it sure feels right
Lay me to rest, for a night
Just you and I
Bring the rain, wash me away
