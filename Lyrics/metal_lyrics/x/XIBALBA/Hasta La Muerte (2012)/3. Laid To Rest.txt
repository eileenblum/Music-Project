It's not what they promised it would be
Childhood dreams, teenage wonders
It's far from what we thought it would be
Hypocritical ties and remorseful lies
I can't deny, death is in sight
I stare at the sun til my eyes catch fire and the sky goes black
Save me from light, drown me in darkness
Rise and rise again til we fall
This isn't the life they framed at all
They failed us
Sadness has burdened our soul
Hate has taken its toll
How much longer can I hold?
Please lay me down to sleep
Place my soul six feet deep
I stare at the sun til my eyes catch fire
I stare at the sun til the sky goes black
Save me from light, drown me in darkness
I'm ready to sleep
Save me from light, drown me in darkness
Please lay me down, take my soul
I'm ready to sleep
I stare at the sun til my eyes catch fire
I stare at the sun til the sky goes black
