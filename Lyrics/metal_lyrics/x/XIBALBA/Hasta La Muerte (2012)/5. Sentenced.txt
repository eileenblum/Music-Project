Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Chained to this head
Caged in these thoughts of mine
Sentenced, imprisoned for life
Sentenced, imprisoned in this mind
Sentenced, no end in sight
Sin after sin, truths arise
Walking these streets I feel their eyes burning
Through the back of my mind
Staying clear from the shadows I get dragged in
No light, no sound, I'm forever trapped
Sentenced, imprisoned in this mind
Sentenced, no end in sight
Angels became demonds, no need to pray
I'm falling from grace, I want to fall from this place
Take my soul, burn my eyes
Demonized, left in the dark
Neglected
Criminalized
I heard screams, I covered my ears
I saw your tears, I looked away
Sentenced, imprisoned in this mind
Sentenced, no end in sight
Place of fear, place of tears
Only the devil dwells here
Consumed by the streets
Consumed by anger
No end in sight
Overwhelmed in this prisoned mind
