This has been paved
Cemented til the end of time
Can't undo what's been done
Foundation has been worn and torn
Broken til the end of time
All the years I lost
Numb til the end of time
This is our home
This home has been broken
Overran in darkness
Ours to haunt us til the end
Laying in anguish night after night
Peace in the darkest of places
Comfort in the loneliest of days
I and I 'til the end of time
Broken til the end of time
All the years I lost
Numb til the end of time
This is our home
I built this home from the ground up
Broken and torn, this is my home
I found peace in darkness, and comfort in solitude
There's no love or feeling in this broken home
I and I until the end of time
I and I til end time
