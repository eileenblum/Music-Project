Deers trail on the ground, gleaming trees
leading forward towards
the echoes of the streams
carved in stone all jaguars sharp teeth
beneath the land into the pyramids dream

Crawls throughout the aeons
Time and space redeem
Four columns hold the sphere
Four colors stain the deeds
Alignment is fulfilled
as the moon rest in the seas
Chac unleash the storms
while the serpent devour the seed

Night comes down all souls descends in time
Sun has won all souls ascent in triumph
dances in the winds red fire breeze
inside deep clouds a red serpent glimpse
