We still the ones who suffer, blood and tears left at the altar, day in and out.
We still the selfless and devoted, at the cost of our hands and knees.

Fall down and drink from me, consume my blood and taste my skin.
Our compassion kissed to your feet.
I've seen you take our life, my love.

Fall down and drink from me, consume my blood and taste my skin.
Our compassion kissed to your feet.
I've seen you take our life, my love.

What is there left for us to give?
I've seen you take the best of me.

What can we do but hope?
Let's hope you see the suffering.
I haven't seen the lowest, but for most of us that's six feet deep.
