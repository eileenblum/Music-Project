alone and lost.
i can't seem to shake this empty feeling.
cold turns to frost.
this void spreads, turning me into nothing.
confined...

i'm reaching for the void.
i'm reaching for the void.
everything i touch gets destroyed. ...
blackness has become my home.
light fades away, but you ...

no reason to leave.
nothing left to live for
nothing left to breathe.
my body starts to decay.
this solid heart starts to break
i don't have much longer now 'til this life fades away.

still i reach out for nothing.
still i long for the warmth that isn't coming.
still waiting for that light to find me.
