I stand with joy over the top of the Itzam Cab Ain
and glimpse
the final halo in sky
the huge sound of the flutes
reigns all over the immense fussiness
flowers get extinguished
my mat is the only throne
The time will come in which be blindfold the eyes of god
Katun for the darken of his throne
The dawn of our matting and the downfall of the races
The glitter of the serpent by far above the wings of time
