As the serpent creeps on the stairs up to her kingdom
As she covers the sun and blind small creatureâs eyes
As her world fulfil the emptiness
As her empire submit these lands
As these oceans of trivial daily-ness get dried
As the black rain purify us and vanish them
As the immense pyramids of knowledge gets restore
As a throng of our shadows hoist his name aloud
As the full moon shines in the sky up high
As all the last tribes sing their songs in joy
As unfathomable aeons embrace our past
As immortality open wide his doors
As all race open the gate of dullness
As all our clouds overcast their prose
As all I glimpse is eternal darkness
And as I bury the fallacy of God
The perennial battle against the actual human tide
Must never give up.
