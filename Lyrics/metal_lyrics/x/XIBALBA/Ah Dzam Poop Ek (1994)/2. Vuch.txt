We shall re-cultivate our vast fields
Eradicate all insolent plague
With the seeds of ethereal wisdom
Numen of pure fecundity
Itzam Na from the empyrean
Fertilize the aridity of all mudane age
And fill of brightness the landscapes of my homeland
Iâll vanish in darkness the valleys of them
As the 13 gods in skies did fall below the underworlds sharp
The dzules Christian way will collapse in the hands of us
The ones with no water over the head
For the wrath of Naxit Xuchit
For the wrath of Canhel
For the wrath of the Plumed serpent
Dzules subdued I deeply inter the spines in Christ
