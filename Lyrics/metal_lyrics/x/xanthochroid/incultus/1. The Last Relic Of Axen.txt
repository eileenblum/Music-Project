"The cosmos is a mindless vortex
A seething ocean of blind forces
In which the greatest joy is unconsciousness
And the greatest pain realisation"

Still, darkness torments me
As I'm engulfed by light
No thing beneath me
But the all-consuming sea

Death smells familiar
And its fumes ignite my eyes
Still, I see nothing
As I fall to my demise

"For what does it matter
Whether we suffer or not?
Our feelings areÂ 
The most trivial of incidentsÂ 
In the unending cycleÂ 
Of existence."

[quoted lyrics from a personal letter by H.P. Lovecraft]
