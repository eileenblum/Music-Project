In this tomb
Wrought by ice
Solidified, my eyes
Stare blankly at night sky
Cold and soulless
As I die

Helpless
Unable to comprehend

Iced, in extremis
A frozen god
Damned, alone
'Til time is gone

Time will end

In this tomb
Wrought by ice
Solidified, my eyes
Stare blankly at night sky
Cold and soulless
As I die

Watching, waiting, slowly dying
Never to decay
A shell preserved for all time
Iced, in extremis
A frozen god
Herald of death lives on
