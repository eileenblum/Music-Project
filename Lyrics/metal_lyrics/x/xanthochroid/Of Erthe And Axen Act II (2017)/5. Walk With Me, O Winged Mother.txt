Warm drops of petrichor
Stream from the trees
To the forest floor

Try to find me
In the morning mist
Neath the canopy
Where once we kissed
Where I am held by evergreens
Silently
With their oaken eaves

I am where
The scent hangs in the air
Where I drank the dew
And met your stare
Where you can sleep amongst the leaves
Peacefully
Dream of simple things

I should have followed you
O, the warm, warm forest floor...
Where I'll dream no more

I felt the outstretched arms of Death
Reaching 'tward my heaving chest
But in the Orchard I was kept
Safe within that thorny crest

Though through the mist the Reaper crept
Row by row, âtil none were left
There I slept amongst (the leaves)
Held silently by evergreens
With giant, arching, oaken eaves

I slept and dreamt of simple things, so trifling
Of wishes whispered silently
Of when I saw her through the trees

O dreams are real until we wake
Beneath this curtainâs heavy weight
The chains of sleep I cannot (shake)
Skies may thunder, Erthe may quake
But never could they from me take
Her tender spirit, the one for whom I ache
