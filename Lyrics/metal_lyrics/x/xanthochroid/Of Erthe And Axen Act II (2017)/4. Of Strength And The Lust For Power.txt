Redeem thy misspent time that is past
And live this day as if thy last

Do you remember the forest before dawn?
When you and I were impetuous and strong
Forming worlds and making legends with our thoughts
Dreaming boldly with a strength that canât be taught

Leave this place
You are not welcome here
In light of what youâve done
Oh, my tainted son

How welcoming
Just like the Father who
Resented me from birth
I am not your son

The strength you seek
Is buried âneath a reeking corpse
The death wrought by your dreams

I beheld the great Stone city
Bastions of marble rose gleaming above the clouds

I only seek to restore what wisdom was lost;
To champion those who must remainâ¦
Erthwile

You think me mad
My mind twisted and cruel
I admit, my sins belie my goals
But the madness is your own

The power is limitless...
Don't you know? We could bring her back!

One day I know you will let me soar
And then you shall watch in excited horror
As you see all of the terrible things that I do
And you realize, it is only you

I, as well,
Longed for that wistful gaze (I was never meant to know)
O, to know
A fatherâs warm embrace

I, as well,
Longed for the fresh sea air (All those years I never thought)
I had thought
Somehow I'd make you care

Within me
A bestial entity
Is in control

Destiny no longer belongs to me
Corruption takes its toll
