Come,
Release your hate.
Revile your pain
Lay down the weight
Crushing your soul

Oh, the well lit halls of my home
Painted by polyphony

May I find some peace;
Solace in this harmony
Built from broken, nameless sound

Hear,
Colors unseen
Cast from their mouths
Halls once well lit
Dampened and dim

Have you grasped the infinite?
Can you feel the weight of eternity?
Mocking, mangling,
Smothering you with hands that never shake

Reveal to me
Those glorious wanton days

At last I feel
The truth is gripping me

I can scarcely draw my breath
My soul is drifting toward
The valley deep within

Melt my heart o music.
Let flow your stream,
Resonant chambers of rage,
contentment, passion or fear.
Life to ever-sleep.

For only you can strike us with your magic.
