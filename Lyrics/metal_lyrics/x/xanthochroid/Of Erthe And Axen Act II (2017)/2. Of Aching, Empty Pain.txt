Twenty years I've wished
To know my place
A hunt for peace
An endless war

Still I ran toward
The throes of death
'Til I felt the warmth
Of her chest

I heave and sigh
And reach and writhe
âTil at last Iâm home
And can see her

Dancing
She looks at me with
Screaming eyes

Twirling
Calming motions
Gentle sighs

(I am lost), lost
Lost in untold pleasures
(In secret worlds)
Where once we dwelt

Flaming
Enveloped in her fire
Scorching
I no longer feel the pain

(Here Iâll stay)
Swaddled in her blazing fire
(I shall remain)
Swinging, swaying
Where she is

Dancing in the darkness
Tempted by her touch
Screams impale the silence

Running carelessly into the fray
Who can make the willful stay?
Can you tell me, what did she say?
That sheâd give her life away?

And though I know
Days are dark and filled of woe
May your countenance never show
What the child inside you knows

O ageless fount of youth
The heavens for you sigh
Reveal thy shape, O formless one

For ages have I wandered
For aeons have I cried:
Walk with me, O Winged Mother

Dancing
She looks at me with
Screaming eyes

Twirling
Calming motions
Gentle sighs

(I am lost), lost
Lost in untold pleasures
(In secret worlds)
Where once we dwelt

Flaming
Enveloped in her fire
Scorching
I no longer feel the pain

(Here Iâll stay)
Swaddled in her blazing fire
(I shall remain)
Swinging, swaying
Where she is

Twenty years I've wished
To know my place
A hunt for peace
Decades of war
Still searching for a soul

I hope you know
I hope youâre there
Where dreams at last prevail
Where fear is met with laughter
Where promise cannot fail

I hope you know
My heart is there
In the damp and misty air
Where still the scent of morning
Hangs softly in your hair
I hope you know
My heart is yours
My angel of repose
My only fleeting solace
Of this aching, empty pain
