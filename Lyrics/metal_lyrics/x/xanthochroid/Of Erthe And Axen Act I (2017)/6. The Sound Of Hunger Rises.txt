Ne aveas Mortem
Non dat is pacem
In enim morte
sciemus morsus
quos reliquimus

*Do not welcome Death
He offers no Peace
For even in Death
We will know the pains
We have left behind*

Just as he came
So he shall go
In woe, in pain, in poverty

Have you ever felt this way before?
Can you feel the power surging through your soul?
And once itâs over, youâll want more
Canât you see itâs what the earth is for-

Can you hear the sound of hunger rise?
We could bring an end to all those mournful, helpless criesâ¦

Take then good heed
Heed To your end
For as I say
So it shall be

We, the paragons of creation
We, the arbiters of change
Was this not the dream we shared
When we were young and unafraid?

But you saw her there,
Gentle eyes, tempting stare;
And still youâre bound by her

No, no, not bound but held
And you neednât think this way

We, were but children you and I
We, thought, as only children think,
This world was ours to conquer,
And its blood was ours to drink

How far you have wandered,
How deep lie your pains.
Bask in this eternal summer
Revel in Morningâs glow
Join me on silted shores once more

How long have I labored
How deep lie the crusted jewels of my innocence
