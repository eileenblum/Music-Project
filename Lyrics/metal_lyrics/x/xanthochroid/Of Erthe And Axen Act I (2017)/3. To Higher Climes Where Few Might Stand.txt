Beyond the feeble reaches
Of conscious memory
A voice long forgotten
Echoes through the chamber of my thoughts

I cannot recall
The speaker or what was spoken
Just a whisper now
Still, itâs crying, screaming, wanting to be known

As dawn greets dew-wet grass
A brother returns at last
Seven years in patience passed
Long since have I laid my dreams to ash

Oh rekindled Flame
Dare not speak His name
Oh unfettered son
What gifts you were given
Why, then, did you run?

As night drapes silted shores
No laughter is heard anymore
Tales of terror and of war
Hang heavy in the dampened midnight air

Oh, recall the dream
Hunger's rising scream
Rays of glinting light
Glancing off dew-wet blades this night

I was there
Where once our fathers rode
Beyond this mortal coil
Toward that precipice of stone
Which stands unchanged, uncaring, and old

Countless wonders I have seen
Endless skies of emerald green
Minds can never idle be
When magic stirs beyond the trees

You know things of which I speak
Secrets buried deep beneath
Still eclipsed in jaded truth
By the nameless wonders of my youth

Oh, recall the dream
(In dreams we cannot die)
Hungerâs rising scream
(It calls us to its side)
Rays of glinting light
Glancing off dew-wet blades this night

Come with me to better days
To higher climes where few might stand
And never shall we tread again
On silted shores, on blackened sand
