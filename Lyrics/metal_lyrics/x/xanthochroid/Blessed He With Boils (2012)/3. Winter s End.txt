Words were writ 
Long ago 
Darkness would claim my throne 

Crushing weight 
Bearing down 
Life traded for a crown 

Light reveals 
Fertile soil 
Stone laid by kings of old 

Winter's end 
Melting snow 
Still I can feel the cold 

Ashes rain from skies 
And smother Erthen fire 
My soul is ever weakened 
By winter's cruel disease
