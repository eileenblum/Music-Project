Do not reject me 

If I should not continue on 
Then let me freeze 
Freeze again to death 
If she will receive me 
Then through these gates 
I must proceed 

Erthe's very womb 
From whence all were born 
I taste the stench of death 

My sight grows sharp 
My breath is steady 

He hides behind 
Monuments to progress 
"Lights that blind" 

Hail! to the Thane of Thule! 
Born of ashes, born to rule! 
"We exalt your glory" 
And bring from afar riches and 
Offerings fit for a king 
(You are no king) 

Hail! To a foolish boy 
Whose Relicry is but a ploy 
"Who is falsely burdened" 
With the charge of an absent god 
You so brutally wronged 
Brother, relinquish your crown 
(Your time has come) 

I have earned the right 
I have sacrificed 

Years of my life 
My dignity and my pride 
To bring man erthly light 

I come to bear witness 
Iron pillars will turn to 
Ashes as you fall 
Not with splendor 
But with a sigh 

You think you have suffered? 
I've endured things far worse than pain, 
I'll make you taste Death 

How easily he fell 
A hollow empty shell: 
Behold your lifeless King!
