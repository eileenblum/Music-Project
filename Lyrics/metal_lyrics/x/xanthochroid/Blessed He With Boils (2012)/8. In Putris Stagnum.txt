At last, I have arrived 
My tired eyes survey this 
Cancerous growth 

A festering pool of worms 
Sickening to behold 
Reminding me of what was, 
And what becomes of buried dreams 

Of reasons, I have but one 
To rid myself of pain 
Shrouded in black fog 
I am beyond death 

âFor those who seek pleasure and power, 
I'll make you beautiful 
Beyond your wildest dreams 
For I am he; 
The one said born of the gods 
But I must ask no less a price 
To dwell in youâ 

I, relinquish body, mind, and soul 
My leprous skin and broken spirit 

I, long to see myself through your eyes 
Not with compassion but disgust 

Welcome, Death. 
I lay my mind to rest 
My faults I do detest 
At last, I fall 

âFor those who seek pleasure and power, 
I'll make you beautiful 
Beyond your wildest dreams 
For I am he; 
The one said born of the gods, 
Long live our kingâ 

Here I'll stay 
I shall remain 
The air is warm, 
The water sweet to drink 

And here I'll stay 
I shall remain 
This wondrous Sound 
Envelops me
