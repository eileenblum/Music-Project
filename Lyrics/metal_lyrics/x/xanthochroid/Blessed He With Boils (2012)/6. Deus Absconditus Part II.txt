And as I watched him writhe in pain 
I felt that familiar horror; 
Struggling to breath and console my fear, 
I realized once again 

The true nature of existence. 
That awful reality I've tried to forget 
Since I was young. 

âDeus Absconditusâ 
The eternal void that awaits us all, 
âGod who is hidden from manâ 
Whether Erthwile bound or a Relic like me; 

The infinite measure of time and space 
Captures each of us for all eternity. 

âDeus Absconditusâ 
No one knows what lies beyond, 
âGod who is hidden from manâ 
But it matters not to me 

Whether it is a neverending paradise, 
A burning pit of fire, 
Or a void of non-existence. 

Whatever horrors or pleasures 
Await us after this life 
Will never eclipse the cold chill 
Of time's endless decay.
