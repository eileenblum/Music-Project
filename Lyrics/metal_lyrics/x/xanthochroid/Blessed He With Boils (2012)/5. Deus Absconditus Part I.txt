Sino me vivere, O, carnifex magnus 
Let me live! O great tormentor! 
For my life is but a passing shadow 
My eyes are unable to see 
What light may lie beyond this life 

Let me make our brief and tortured lives 
Seem beautiful and grand 
For soon we will turn to dust 
You will look upon this Erthe 
And we will be gone 

God of Ashes, King of Erthe 
Given to a strange rebirth 
Every man shall to him sing: 
"Xanthochroid, our rightful King" 

Deus Absconditus 
God who is hidden from man 

We, disciples of the north 
Bring this vile carcass forth 
No one comforts as he weeps 
Simply drifting off to sleep
