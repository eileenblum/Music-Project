As Erthe's beauty fades 
Behind bright, blinding lights 
Will I still recall 
The smell of the woods, 
My home, 
The lone and silent elk, 
The damp, misty air 
The allure of the erthe? 

I must posses a mind 
Not to be changed by place or time 
Not to be poisoned by 
The stench of progress 

I remember when 
I had a brother and a friend 
A friend whose struggles 
I alone have witnessed 

When I saw him there 
Crumbling face, empty stare 
A great, heaving sigh 
I, at last, said good bye 

The sky is black with fog 
Black with the souls of those who've lost 
That fleeting breath which they called life 

I step into the mist 
Recalling the place she and I lived 
Hoping to find some semblance of old joy 

But alas her tender spirit 
Has gone away at last 
For in my most desparate hour 
She did not come 
No empty blessings 
No friendly ghost 
To fill me with false hope 
Or haunt me with happy dreams 
Still I was drunk by the prospect 
That she may sit beside me 
When my trials were through 

I walk along the sand 
By the cold, brackish water 

âIt's hard to remember 
The paths we used to takeâ 

It's hard to walk in this thick mud 
And I begin to sink. 

âVocant me deus 
Numquam ita sentitur 
Humanaâ
