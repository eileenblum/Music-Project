You finally moved to the suburbs, away from crime and filth
You got a house alarm and you feel much safer with no guilt
Every morning you drive Jimmy and Jane to school
You watch them walk inside, pick them up right on time, and everything seems fine
There is no way to protect your family
One day Jimmy was never there; they never even found him!
They did find Jane though, in 34 different pieces, spread across the county
There is no way to protect your family!
