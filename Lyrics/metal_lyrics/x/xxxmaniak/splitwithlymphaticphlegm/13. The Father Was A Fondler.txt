There is a light at the end of the tunnel and it is illuminating a small playground
Every morning Father McKracken gives himself a pep talk
A way to motivate himself to get through another day without boyflesh
The secret to his success, is preparation.
Being ready when the urge strikes, he keeps a jelly filled stress ball within reach
When he feels the need to fondle... something
