I first spotted you on the ride home, the youth size shorts barely contained your soft ass
Every time at 5:30 you walk an almost barren road, an easy fix in my grasp
Young, Stupid and Ready!
What will it take to lure you? Money, drugs or candy?
Anything you want young one, whatever strikes your fancy!
