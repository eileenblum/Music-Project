Stone hearts are hard to break
Pound away, try to break me down
Stone hearts will never change
Cast away, in the rubble I'll remain
Stone heart
Don't you dare look into these eyes, should have been blind
Please don't try to hold my cold hands, 'cause I won't feel
Don't mistake my kindness for affection
Don't mistake my affection for love
I'm far too insane, too far to save
I am a man, but not the man for love
Stone hearts are hard to break
Pound away, try to break me down
Stone hearts will never change
Cast away, in the rubble I'll remain
Stone heart
Stone heart 'til the day I die
Sorry but I can't see eye to eye with the world
Victim since birth, the outcome of mistake
Hate and lust have filled these veins
So I cut that bitch called love
I've been fucked since day one
Stone heart
Sorry Ma, stone hearts know no love
