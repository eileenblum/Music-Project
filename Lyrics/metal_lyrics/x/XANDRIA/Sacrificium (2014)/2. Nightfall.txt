Here it comes, the story of mankindÂ´s final glory
Into the nightfall
The showdown now has come, this will be the last curtain
Before the Night falls

In a desert burning childrenÂ´s faces turning
Into another enemy in war
Icy winds are blowing over bodies piling high
ThereÂ´s no place left for more

Oh save me from sharing this hell
Oh save me from my blame

We are worshipping the gods
That keep twisting our thoughts
Everyday a new sensation
While a million creatures
See their soil turning to dust
Hrimata Eleison

Forever and ever
You hear them crying
Forever and ever
This world is dying
We had so much time to understand

We are rising higher, closer to the fire
Let the final dance begin
