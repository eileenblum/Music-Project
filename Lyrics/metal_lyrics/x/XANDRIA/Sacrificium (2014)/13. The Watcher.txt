[Bonus Track]Hate â Greed â Worlds turn to ashes
War â Creed â No sign from heaven
Burn â Bleed â All just for nothing

For centuries IÂ´ve wandered here
Across the ashes of mankind
The blood been spilled, the hopes deceived
There is no water turned to wine
A golden age, a woven maze
Of stolen strings and fake bliss

Keep on bleeding, self-deceiving
All or nothing, make-believing
That the winner will always be you

See the clouds in the sky still burning
Watch me counting the days in the rain
White eiderdown falls to the ground
Covers all that has been with death

So long ago a flower rose
Revealed its beauty and its thorns
WeÂ´ve covered those once golden roads
With blood of our children

Look and see what it could have been
But this all was just a dream
Just a dream of our foolish minds
Soâ¦

See the clouds in the sky still burning
Watch me counting the days in the rain
The nightfall has come so early
Wiping all of our visions away
White eiderdown falls to the ground
Covers all that has been with death

Wake up
See what youÂ´re becoming
See what weÂ´re becoming
