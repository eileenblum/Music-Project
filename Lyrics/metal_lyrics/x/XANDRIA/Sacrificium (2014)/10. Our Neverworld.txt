I know that you feel like being a stranger
A yearning heart, a soul that has survived this darkness
A soul like mine, endlessly craving for more
Somewhere in a dream

We are one in our Neverworld
We are gone, say farewell to you all

Looking at you I can see beyond this prison
That locks you in, hiding your true incarnation
A radiant shine, a warmth that I have never
Felt Like this before â and want to feel forever

We are one in our Neverworld
We are gone, say farewell to you all
The closer we are coming now the more itÂ´s getting real
Real for you and me

Together we can take a piece of never
Bring it back with us
And make this world our home

ItÂ´s all there in the beauty of your heart
