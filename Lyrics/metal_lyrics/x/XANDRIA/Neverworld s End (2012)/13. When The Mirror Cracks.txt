[Bonus Track]Took sense and madness as they come, this circus life has left me on my own
My expectations were my home, but when the mirror cracks thereâs so much left undone
Who betrayed and who deceived?
Loss of what I once believed

Feel Iâm in a dream, scary scenes rush before my eyes
Wake up in a scream, this is real, whereâs my paradise?
Drowned by circumstance, innocence crushed under this load
Will it ever end, whereâs my life?

Disastrous certainties once felt, my vast collection of a better time to tell
Knowing my worst enemy
Weak and helpless, is this me?

Feel Iâm in a dream, scary scenes rush before my eyes
Wake up in a scream, this is real, whereâs my paradise?
Drowned by circumstance, innocence crushed under this load
Will it ever end, whereâs my life?

Late comprehension, a new dimension, a newborn child and its fragile world

Feel Iâm in a dream, scary scenes rush before my eyes
Wake up in a scream, this is real, whereâs my paradise?
Drowned by circumstance, innocence crushed under this load
Will it ever end, whereâs my life?
