[Bonus Track]Along the seashore, rousing and cold
A withered face in the wind
An old man waiting for the end of his tale
His sight on the soughing waves

The load of memories in his hands
A long way home to innocence

The sailor and the sea

Time has gone like the altering tides
A thousand steps in the sand
An unmistakable proof of his life
Of all what he had once been

He walks away from a young boyÂ´s dream
And all thatÂ´s left is just the sea

The sailor and the sea

And in the end we all are him
The sailor and the sea...
