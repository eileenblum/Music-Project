We have come a long way
Through rain and the dust of time
Times full of wonders
Full of secret signs

We have seen the winters
And the sunlight's brightest shine
But not every single moment
Can stand the test of time

The song now has ended
And the last notes fade away
But a new one begins
The music will stay

Now it's time for the future
We left our past behind
All the battles are over
But the dream is still alive

Smoke has been rising
Now it's blown away by the wind
It's all getting clearer
I wonder where I've been

A past destined to fall down
The final brick in the wall
Was so hard for me to see
But now I see it all

Now it's time for the future
We left our past behind
All the battles are over
But the dream is still alive

No-one can take it away from me
No day will ever let it end

Now it's time for the future
We left our past behind
All the battles are over
But the dream is still alive

Now we see our tomorrow
The night is long ago
All the fighting is over
But the dream is still alive
