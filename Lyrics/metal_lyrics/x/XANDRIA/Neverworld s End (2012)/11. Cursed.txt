Keep yourself from falling into cursed deep waters...

Have you been to the water
Have you gone with the tide
Have you heard of strange creatures
Beware of the moonlight

Down falls the light as they rise from the sea
In comes the night, give your soul, pay your fee
Living a curse, they were born by their sins
Soon life and death will become evil twins

Bound to go where the wind blows
Bound to serve the unreal
Bound to dwell in deep waters
Greed and fear cast their seal

Down falls the light as they rise from the sea
In comes the night, give your soul, pay your fee
Living a curse, they were born by their sins
Soon life and death will become evil twins

Cursing their non-lives
Living a curse is their lot
Life without senses
Seeking escape from this plot

Down falls the light as they rise from the sea
In comes the night, give your soul, pay your fee
Living a curse, they were born by their sins
Soon life and death will become evil twins

Down falls the light as they rise from the sea
In comes the night, give your soul, pay your fee
Living a curse, they were born by their sins
Soon life and death will become evil twins
