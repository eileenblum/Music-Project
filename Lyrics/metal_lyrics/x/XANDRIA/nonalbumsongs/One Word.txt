A thousand times a hundred signs
We fail to see and spoil it all
In thousand ways we fail to say
What is really on our mind

All we are feeling
All we hope for
And all we need to say
Is just one word

A thousand times our lips are closed
A thousand keys we throw away
The voice keeps still the heart keeps on
Longing to be heard

All we are feeling
All we hope for
And all we need to say
Is just one word
Only one word

Do you sometimes wonder
Why we loose each other
Without sense

Why we talk so much
Just by saying nothing
Nothing at all

Do you sometimes wonder
Why you lose yourself?

All we are feeling
All we hope for
And all we need to say
Is just one word

All we are feeling
All we hope for
And all we need to say
Is just one word
Only one word
Only one word
Only one word
