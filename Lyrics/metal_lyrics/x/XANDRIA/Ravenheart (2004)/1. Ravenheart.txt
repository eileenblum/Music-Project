Come to me, Ravenheart
Messenger of evil
Come to me. What's the news?
Here I'm still left lonely

You shadow of forgotten dreams
You come to take away
My hope on your black wings

Of love &amp; hate the singers tell
But I feel more, more of both,
More than heaven &amp; hell.
I take a bow to destiny.
Now I have really learnt my part
Once loving him, now hating love
I've made mistakes, my Ravenheart

Will I get back who I adore?
Thus spoke the raven: nevermore.
