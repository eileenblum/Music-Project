On!
Sailing on!
To our fate!
To India...

Above the seas with the wind we are flying high
Our wings are sails and our trail means no second try
Golden and silver the future will be
When we are at the aim

Forward we sail into the unknown
We have no fear, weÂ´re sacred
WeÂ´re going to where no one has gone before
Keep on 'til we have reached the sunset
There will be no withdrawal
WeÂ´re heading for the treasures of India

Stars show the way through the night, we donÂ´t look behind
Water supplies getting low but weÂ´re strong in mind
Power and glory will come to us all
When weÂ´re at the aim

Forward we sail into the unknown
We have no fear, weÂ´re sacred
WeÂ´re going to where no one has gone before
Keep on 'til we have reached the sunset
There will be no withdrawal
WeÂ´re heading for the treasures of India

Once there was a vision to find a new land behind the horizon
When we chased the sun a whole new world was born

My dearest wishesâthey will be fulfilled
When we have reached our destination

Forward we sail into the unknown
We have no fear, weÂ´re sacred
WeÂ´re going to where no one has gone before
Keep on 'til we have reached the sunset
There will be no withdrawal
WeÂ´re heading for the treasures of India

On!
Sailing on!
To our fate!
Sailing on!
On!
Sailing on!
To our fate!
Sailing on!
