I cannot turn away
From this obscurity
A nameless Force
Is stealing my face

Come and â try to â fight me
You will â never â break me

I know itÂ´s the final breath IÂ´m taking if I let you win
So I cannot be the one forgiving or IÂ´m giving in

Now I can see you
You were just hiding
You wonÂ´t betray me
Cause now I know your name

Come and â try to â fight me
You will â never â break me

I know itÂ´s the final breath IÂ´m taking if I let you win
So I cannot be the one forgiving or IÂ´m giving in
