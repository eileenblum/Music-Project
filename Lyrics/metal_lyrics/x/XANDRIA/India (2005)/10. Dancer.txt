She walks on the moonlit snow
SheÂ´s winterhearted, so you say
But you donÂ´t see

SheÂ´s a dancer on the glass
ThatÂ´s broken like her past
She would never flee

Fascination is her name

She is dancing in the wind
Almost dancing everything
Every moment of her life
She is taking me with her
With the music in her heart
She is breaking every ice

She is talking with the world
A far-traveled bird
Her soulÂ´s her home

See how light are all her moves
Just follows her own rules
But she is not alone

Fascination is her name

She is dancing in the wind
Almost dancing everything
Every moment of her life
She is taking me with her
With the music in her heart
She is breaking every ice
In me
