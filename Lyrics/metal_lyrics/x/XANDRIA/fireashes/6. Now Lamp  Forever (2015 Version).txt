Millions of songs all these years in my soul
And when we met I just knew theyÂ´re for you
Now your voice is singing them all
Your wings at mine we will never fall

On and on
We will fly now &amp; forever
Side by side now &amp; forever my love

Thousands of miles through the cold stormy air
ThereÂ´s really nothing that I wouldnÂ´t dare
I climb the eye of the hurricane
When the winds are whispering your name

On and on
We will fly now &amp; forever
Side by side now &amp; forever my love
