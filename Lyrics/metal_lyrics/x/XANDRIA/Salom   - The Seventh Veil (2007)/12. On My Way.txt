I'm on my way  -  to the places only you have seen
So far away  -  show me places where I've never been
Come touch my soul  -  you're here to fill this life of mine
Take my control  -  this Midas touch is all divine

I am your light, the keeper of the flame
You are the night causing sweetest pain

And I feel it is real  -  nothing I can hide inside
A spirit took me back to life again
And I see it is real  -  forgotten's what I used to be
A new born soul, I'm on my way

To where all dreams whisper your name
I'm yours to take  -  made in heaven, not in vain
In your dark eyes  -  lies the suffering of my pride
Look at my tries  -  to fight this longing I can't hide

You're what I need  -  got me out of mind
You will take the lead  -  forever, I'll be blind

And I feel it is real  -  nothing I can hide inside...

Once I thought this could not happen
Solitary, my soul, now gone astray

And I feel it is real  -  nothing I can hide inside...
