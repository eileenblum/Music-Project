They call for me
Dance Of The Seven Veils
I have no choice
I'm nothing if I fail

Lonely SalomÃ©, Dancing SalomÃ©
Veil for veil away
Villain and prey

The first veil falls  -  illusion
The second one  -  innocence
The third one follows  -  pride
And four was my way back

Losing my dignity
With every move I make
I'm losing it
The veil falls

Freedom was long ago
With every step I take
I walk away
From this veil

Singing SalomÃ©, Naked SalomÃ©
Veil for veil away
Villain and prey

If there's one thing left to see
That's of interest
Then it's in my chest
The seventh veil is me
