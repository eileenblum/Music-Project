Abide with me or redeem me
Fall ends winter is nigh
With a gentle voice I'm guided to the void where loneliness roams

Rename me like a master from upon your bloody throne
I'll go forth here in silence and abandon my home
In the last light of noonday I fell wilted away
Oh mother please come save me from the dark night of the soul

I have come to see you reviled me
Reproved me with a sigh

Now from different shores a made-up story's told
Though my fears of yore

Rename me like a master from upon your bloody throne
I'll go forth here in silence and abandon my home
In the last light of noonday I fell wilted away
Oh mother please come save me from the dark night of the soul

Oh mother please come save me from this emptiness lead me away.
Oh mother please come save me from this emptiness!
Save me now from the dark night of the soul.
