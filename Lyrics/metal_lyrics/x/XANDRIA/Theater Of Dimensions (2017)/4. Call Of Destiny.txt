Destined
This is predetermined, if you follow through
Follow through every byway
Follow fate on your journey
River deep, mountain high
Through daylight and darkest nights

Though my tale starts cold and lonely
The promise that I heard colored my world
To the outline of a greater spectrum
Where chances are revealed, fate will be sealed

Walk the path, ford the stream, 'til I reach my dream

This is the moment, my redemption
This is the day that all the stars align
I gain my momentum
Every endeavor, every measure led the way to overcome and say:
I've answered to thee
Call of destiny

Not a course for the faint-hearted
This journey that I'm on demands my all
I will overthrow my tribulations
And value what they're worth
Let it be heard:

Gain control self-esteem, 'til I reach my dream

This is the moment, my redemption
This is the day that all the stars align
I gain my momentum
Every endeavor, every measure led the way to overcome and say:
I've answered to thee
Call of destiny

Follow through every byway
Follow fate on your journey
River deep, mountain high
Through daylight and darkest nights

I'll walk the path
Every stepping stone
I'll ford the stream
Time to live my dream

This is the moment, my redemption
This is the day that all the stars align
I gain my momentum
Every endeavor, every measure led the way to overcome and say:
I am here today

(This is the moment, my redemption
This is the day that all the stars align
I gain my momentum)
The moment's now here and mine
(Every endeavor, every measure led the way to overcome and say:)
My fate fulfilled and defined
(I've answered to thee)
Oh! Call of destiny
(Call of destiny)
