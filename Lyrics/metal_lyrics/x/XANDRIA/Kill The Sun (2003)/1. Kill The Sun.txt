i am down at the water 
my bare feet are numb 
and for aeons now nothing seems real 

now it's hard to hold sight 
through your soft eiderdown 
but i still got my hands on the wheel 

you have set my mind 
between worlds spinning round 
i'm a stranger in my universe 

but i see my sun 
and i know that it will 
be forever shining on earth 

you can rain down on me 
but you can't darken the sun 
you can cast a spell on the moon 
but you can't kill the sun
