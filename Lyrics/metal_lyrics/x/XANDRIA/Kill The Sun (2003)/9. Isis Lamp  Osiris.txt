"i am birth - i am death 
i'm an elusive symbol 
for eternal come and go 
for come and go 

i have come - i have gone 
i have shown you moira 
and her restless re-creation 
your own re-creation" 

"never, no never the day will go down on me 
within knowing him by my side 
sothis, o sothis, don't pass me again 
before i know how to heal 
who is shattered by the forces of the night"
