Cold, one night in December
It took away what the angels have never faced!

Now I will never see your face again
Like a thousand cuts it hits me,
On that December's Eve
This is the last time
I will kiss you cheeks

Now I can feel the pain is real
I can see I'm breaking
Flowers on your grave
Bring me to my knees

And what is left is but a dream of a kid,
And songs that echo to eternity
Lost! It never felt this way

Colors have turned to gray
Since I've been visiting your grave!
I will never see your face again
Never you will be
Never you will see
Blue eyes forever closed
Our faiths twisted to eternity

Now I can feel the pain is real
I can see I'm breaking
Flowers on your grave
Bring me to my knees
And what is left is but a dream of a kid,
And songs that echo to eternity
Forever you will live in my dreams
