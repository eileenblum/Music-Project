We walk on a path leading to dead end
Sentence ourselves to death
In the time we spent we are trying to perceive
Who is father, who is son?
Whose roots gave new breeds
Who dwells among whom?

Desperately trying to escape
Desperately seeking for the truth

But still living with our fate
Still asking for the truth

Standing in front of epitaphs
On lies built new paths
Seeking for familiar words
With letters,manipulating hordes

We are wrong spelled reality
With kings and dukes names we don't know
Grabbing for a long gone prosperity
Blind and like a river into abyss we follow!
