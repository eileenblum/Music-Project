All life ends waiting for one last breath
My kind now erased
Fill you lungs with hate
One last quick glance
At the world we left
It's a place where no human will exist!

A sorrowed filled eyes,fill the skies
The last born child now left to die
No one to guide us,
No one to save,
For what is left of mine... now dead kind

And when the last breath we take
When flower meets our grave
When dreadful hours make haste
REMEMBER OUR NAME!

And when the last breath we take
When silence makes its way
When dreadful hours make haste
REMEMBER OUR NAME!
