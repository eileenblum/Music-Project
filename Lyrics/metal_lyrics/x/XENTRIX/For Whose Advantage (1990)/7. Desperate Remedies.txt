Seek the perfect race your knowledge you provide
Is this a worthwhile cause or just genocide?
Torment and despair alone and cast aside
No sympathetic ears to hear their cries
No justice in their world
Competence is no excuse for ignorance
Blameless yet their death has no significance
Sorrow and emotion are a consequence
Their eyes forever closed and you ask why
No justice in their world
Taking liberties with other people's lives
Testing theories to their demise
Could this be--desperate remedies
Fundamental thoughts you try to satisfy
The exception proves the rule and that you verify
This work in time of peace you cannot justify
The only words you ever speak are lives
No justice in their world
Taking liberties with other people's lives
Testing theories to their demise
Could this be--desperate remedies
