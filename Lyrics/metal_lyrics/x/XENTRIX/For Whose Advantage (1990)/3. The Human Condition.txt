An age that's in decline
The blind lead the blind
Live from day to day
Nothing here yet you stay
Painful memories you recall
Nothing left for you at all
Your life is your priority
No hope for you alone
Kept out of sight
Unseen, disowned
By society
You know what will be will be
No such thing as destiny
To watch the world as time ticks by
Many truths that you deny
You cannot change the way you feel
Some emotions you can't conceal
No way to end your misery
No hope for you alone
Kept out of sight
Unseen, disowned
By society
Salvage you identity
You cannot life off charity
This is a high price to pay
For being led astray
No feeling here but apathy
Can't risk emotional injury
No time for thought or sentiment
No hope for you alone
Kept out of sight
Unseen, disowned
By society
No hope for you alone
Kept out of sight
Unseen, disowned
By society
