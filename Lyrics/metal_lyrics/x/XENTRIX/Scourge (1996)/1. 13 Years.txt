Reason sutlers, boundaries are none
Needing binds with fear of in one
I am the knowledge that the hateful crave
All things to all men, to all men

Hatred, hate without reason
I am the one that you crave
Broken, rip you to pieces
This love betrayed

I am existence to you, I am world
I am a life disdain
Total resistance leaves me cold
13 years of pain
Count on me for nothing, you shall receive
Countless are the dreams that I've been having
Forcing you to bleed
Take all from the weak and never give
These tears aphrodisiac to me

Halted...

I am existence...
What you felt for me once you'll feel again
On the shame
On the last day
This knowledge I have found because I am shame
This is you pain and this my strength
Fed sick on deception we are one

Hatred...

I am existence...
