Who will bleed for your belief
Who will mourn and who will grieve
Out of sight not out of danger
Never be the same again
Forever thinking where and when
The deepest cut remains the fear

It'll never be the same again
Never be the same
Who will suffer for your cause
Or live in fear behind closed doors
How much blood will equal freedom
Count the cost or count your dead
Colours rule but all bleed red
The terror here will stay forever

It'll never be the same again
Never be the same
Who will bleed for you?
It'll never be the same again
Who will mourn for you?
It'll never be the same
