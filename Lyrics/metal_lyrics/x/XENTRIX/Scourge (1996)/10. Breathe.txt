I feel the currents shifting
Still dragging me down
The light above still fading
No one near to help me, cannot reach the sun
Alone
Through the water cleanses
The stain from in me
The coldness I can hardly stand
Once I knew the answers
Now the questions wound my thoughts

Take this soul and make it your own
Take this mind, this misery's home
Take this body, this body in pain
I will live 1 will breathe again
Now the weight of darkness bows
The doubt inside my mind
That I've never felt before
Once I knew the answers
Now the questions wound my thoughts

Take this soul
Broken, defeated and left for dead, pain still lingers where wounds once bled
Anger, frustration, no sympathy, the ocean that drowns me in apathy
Holding out a hand to help me, determination I will breathe
Never more destroyed and angry, determination, I will breathe
Rotten and spiking the core remains, festers unnoticed but still the same
All that remains is the will to breathe the air I once trusted you took from me
