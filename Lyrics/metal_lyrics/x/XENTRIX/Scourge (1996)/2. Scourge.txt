Where there's life you bring pain
Where there's light the dark stain
Bleed the colour of the shame
Where there's with speak only lies
Where there was laughter hear the cries
I am the truth that you despise
One world, your aim is destruction
The time that tells is your one enemy
Should you, ever see nobility
Truth hurts so you breed dishonesty
You're pulling the strings of the toy humanity
That you have soiled
The killing

You force my mind
To discharge lies
Where there's joy you bring tears
Where they dream implant fear
You are ever near
Into hope inject despair
With remorse you charge the air
Find only blackness in the stare
Cut down, the sane will never rise
You've taken another slice from the dream they sacrifice
And now I stand a better man
Big words but your weakness I despise
You know the tremor betrays a thin disguise
And we will crush and you will crawl

You force my mind
To discharge lies
Broken, torn from security
Deaf, dumb, blind to the profanity
Fathers, sons are the pawns you send
They march to fuel the bitter end
