First your anger then take your mind
I use it all and I leave nothing behind
I am the first last and only son
And your submission is the way to get along
Shout out. You wont be heard
I feed the people and I fill their ears with dirt
Fifteen years and I've been the people's voice
And now you listen cos you haven't got a choice
You fool, I own you

You're not the only one
I've taken another son
And it I caught you living
You'd be better off dead
Fists are raised in protest again
Wont be so long until the fire begin
Because the last time the hate will rise
Will bring an end to this the way I terrorise
Fuck you, I couldn't give a shit
More lives are forced into my fear pit
Vote for me and I'll take away the pain
And you'll feel nothing cos I've smashed your brain
You fool, I own you

You're not the only one
I'll take you where no one goes
I'll blind you and I'm in control
Nobody's gonna save you now
Fuck you I'm in control
Black on white I cause you to fight
I sat and laugh at the riots tonight
Because it's all a part of the master plant
You kill each other then I'm the only man
Left alive to rule and obey
You hear me talk but I've got nothing new to say
Look at me I got where I am by being
Right place, right time now I'm the man
You fool. I'm you

You're not the only one...
