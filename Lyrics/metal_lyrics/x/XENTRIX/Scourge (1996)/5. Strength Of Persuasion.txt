Cry out at another.street protest
Against the power crimes
Is my voice heard?
I have no time for this, I have no-time to waste
I feel he hate surge
Fucked up and cynical, influences criminal
Wearing he colours of respectability

I see them cowered into loyalty
I feel the hate surge
I feel your silver tongue destroying me
I feel he hate surge through
Eighteen in the gutter with a hate sign
In the real world
How could you stand by
Some blame the films we rent
I say the system sent them to their suicide
Run around never look down
At the rags on the underground
I see your lips move but you're saving nothing
I can hear

I see them cowered...
When the time comes where are you gonna be?
Anywhere near me?
Inside us all there-burns a self-destructive urge
On which you prey and feed
Twenty four with a future
You wanna give me a new job
May sound ungrateful but there's some of us don't want to bleed

I see them cowered...
