Forget
All that you love
In the name of modern possessions
Forget
How does it feel?
On the way to soul devastation

So hollow
So desolate
Thereâs no time to smell the flowers
Alienation
The sign of today
Thereâs no time to call your mother

Faceless meat
Faceless world

Inside of me
Inside of you
There is no joy
There is no blue
There is no hate
There is no love
And we become
the faceless ones

Betray
All of your faith
In the name of new messiah
Betray
No reasons to try
To stay yourself and to be loyal

So hollow
So desolate
There is no time to heartache healing
Indifference
Try to be deaf
When you hear someone screaming

Time to generate
Brand New World
Vomit sinsplotation
Sticky mind's control
