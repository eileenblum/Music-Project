Do what you want
Do what you feel
Do everything for dreams to be real

Close your eyes
Can you hear the sounds inside?
Hear it now
Forced engine of your life

Keep the breath and synchronize
Resist the rush of life
New age need new modern meat
To fight and to defy

Feel my heartbeat - Knock knock knock
All my life - my perfect drug
Rising fire in my soul
All my life - my Heartcore

Trust your heart
Your only way is to be right
Tune this vibe
To win the battle - start the fight!

Transform all that you have
To a weapon for survival
No fate but what we make
Not every fall is final
