Total Recall! Letâs go back in time!
The last decade of betrayed Empire
Total Recall! Remember those days
Star Wars for the first time! It's total daze!

Together we watched Predatorâs hunt
Together we followed Forrest Gump
Fighting for life on LV-426
We still respect you Corporal Hicks!

We killed Rebenga for Green Card
We found the Force on Dagoba
We fought against the OCP
And war-machines of series âTâ

Generation VHS
Rewind the tapes
Replay the days
Generation VHS
The past is far behind
Forever blessed

And now the age of Full HD
We said goodbye to DVD
But Casey Ryback crushing enemies
Is still alive in the memories

We ran through the jungle. Yeah! We got it!
We loved the smell of napalm in the morning
We were afraid to sleep at night
As Freddie might come when we turned off the light

We tried to fly on Airplane
With Naked Gun in shaking hands
Weâve found the Ark! Weâve found the Grail!
We killed Nostromoâs Number Eight
