Frontline
Is living Hellfire
Burning blood against cold steel

No pain! No weakness!
You fight until your last breath
No fear! No mercy!
Your death is not the end

Sacrifice
Days of your Destiny
No way to retreat
Your land is behind
Sacrifice
Fight for your Motherland
This day of your last stand
Nothing will crush your Will

Between
The crushing divisions
You know what youâre fighting for
You know what youâre dying for

The snow is turning red
Iron rain falls from the sky
Flame inside your heart -
Mother's voice and name of the Father

Through the flame
Through the storm
You will walk like a fearless one
You will stand where others fall

Ne vedaya straha
O smerti zabyv
V merzluyu zemlyu vgryzayas
Nasmert stoyali
Zhizn otdavaya
Soldaty velikoi strany

Za materi chest
Vo imya ottsa
Stoyali soldaty stenoyu
I zalita krovyu nasha zemlya
Za nashu s vami svobodu
