The Day before the yesterday
We were so young and brave
We believed in our future
We didnât think about the grave

Yesterday we became soldiers
We are thin lines on the maps
Cheap way to solve big problems
Dice in the games of Gods

Iâll never see your eyes again
War is not a fairy tale
Sadness and sorrow are breaking me over
I've lost the meaning of life

And even the angels
Canât bring you to me
Canât bring you to life
My endless waiting
My endless hope
My black hole of time

Last sunrise we saw today
Like an iron wall, we stood in the enemyâs way

War is the production
And now we became waste
Nameless bodies were buried
In the godforsaken place
