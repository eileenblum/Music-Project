Donât wake me up
When Iâm walking down on Brooklyn streets
Donât wake me up
Central Park â Iâm listen here the voices of leaves
Donât wake me up
When I see the light of towers that scratch the sky
Donât wake me up
I donât want to say Â«Goodbye NYÂ»

The only dream of my life
One day to see NY

My City of Light
My City of Life
I wanna feel your cold breath on my face
My City of Light
My City of Life
So easy to fall under the spell of this place
Donât hide away
Donât hide away
When the morning wakes me
Donât hide away
I wanna stay here

Donât wake me up
When Iâm lost myself in your mirror walls
Donât wake me up
I canât find myself in the deep of your malls
Donât wake me up
When I smell your roads after the rain
Donât wake me up
I hate the morning that brings me the pain

The only dream of my life
One day to see NY
