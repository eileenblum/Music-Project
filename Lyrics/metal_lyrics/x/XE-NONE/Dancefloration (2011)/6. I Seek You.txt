Iâm living here
Day by day
Green flower
In my tray

Type my number
My password
I am here
Hello, world!

Hello! How are you?
Iâm fine! Iâm working too!
Drink some tea? The lunch is great
What you think about this band?

I seek you! Oh my happiness
Without you my life is gray
I seek you! I need you so
I need you every fuckinâ day!
All that you keep
All my feelings and my dreams
All that I need
My green flower will never never fade away

Exit light
Enter night
Iâm here again
Always in sight

Type my number
My password
Iâm here again
Good evening, world!

Any news? Are you at home?
I'm still at work. I'm on the phone!
Iâve good idea! Itâs hard to keep!
Please, not now! I want to sleep!
