Party starts
Party hard
Boom till deaf
Boom till dumb
Sweat on skin
Sweat on the wall
I know what I need
Iâm hit the floor!!!

Wind it up!
Lift me up!
Push the beat
Make me hot
Hard to the core
I need more!
One way ticket
To Dance Row

Hey mister DJ
Donât fuck me up
Donât play for yourself
Play for the floor
Hey mister DJ
Donât fuck me up
Donât play for yourself
Play for the floor
I donât wanna freeze
I donât wanna stop
Hey mister DJ
Donât fuck me up
Donât play for yourself
Play for the floor

Start the dance
Watch my hands
Add more dB
To pluck my pants
Make me strong
Make me fine
Make my soul
Is rising high

Shake my ass
Blow my brain
Make it cool
And we'll be back again!
Donât make a mistake
Donât play this fake
Letâs give us all
That we can take!
