Don't go
I know you can do
It  s the last chance for me and for you
It's easier - destroy than built
One step and feelings are killed

I'm sorry
It was my crime
One step over this line
Love tricks have turned to betrayal
No winners at the end of this game

No, baby boy
Tears are not salvation
Know, baby boy
My soul devastation
Just some advice
And try to believe
To forget is better than to forgive

Temptation
Was stronger than me
I'm loser - as you can see
One hour and no years of love
One hour - again I'm alone
