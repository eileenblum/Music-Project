My sons, your life is short.
End of days is near.
Hear my voice, novitiates
And execute my will
A Sacred place for sacrifice
We find the way to God
Take the cure, forget the fear
And save your soul

Pray, my children
Your Father is the only way to the sky
Kneel before the gates of heaven
For the last time

Time will come
Heaven awaits you

This world was created
Not by us and not for us
Leave behind all that you have
I show you the Golden Path
Flesh to ashes, world to dust
In the name of God
I show the holy way for all
Who want to save their souls.

Hey, man!
I see the times
No faith, no gods, no lies
No sinners, no saints
And no religions that fucks your brains
