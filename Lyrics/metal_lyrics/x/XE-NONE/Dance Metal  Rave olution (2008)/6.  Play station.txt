Start the game
I've made my choice
Fast and hard
No brakes, no blocks
I'm using my mind
I'm using my force
I'm getting the weapon
Collecting my skill points
Freedom to play
Freedom to be
To be the one who is always free
But I wanna be the same
As the hero in my game!
Think like PS to get a new gain!

I wanna think like PlayStation
I wanna you to think like me
One life
One direction
One way to victory
I wanna think like PlayStation
I wanna you to think like me
Your life
Your force
Your way to victory

Life is like a mission
Day is like a stage
A new state of mind
In cyber age
RPG or FPS
I choose my model to progress
Life is like a game
The same laws, the same rules
Something i have, something i lose
But if in my life
I want to have more
I should play - I should go
