Don't fuck yourself up
World is not for us
All is divided,
All is sold out.

You can't hide
You can't resist
Step by step
You are in this list
All alone
No defense
You can't stop
This decay dance

Let's dance, my friend
This Decay Dance
No will
No force
To stop this process
Let's dance, my friend
This Decay Dance
No fear
No fate
And no regrets

Shut up! Your voice is
Useless and weak
One man is zero
We all are just meat
