[Music: T. Azad, S. Leask | Lyrics: T. Azad]

Echoes,
drifting through Space.
Free from the malice,
distortion, and everything that is organized thought!

Vast!
Dark energy reigns.
Weaponized and used!
Destruction envelopes as Extinction follows

Existance.
Bound to a strange dimension.
Subservience or termination!
Negligent resistance from those who oppose.

Our kind, one mind!
We pursue the Ultimate Truth!

All sentient worlds are commodious, 
necessary tools for Galactic Control!

As Our grip grows tighter,
devolution takes place and more systems fall!

Through brutal oppression,
conditioned by Eternal War!

The time for harvest nears,
and life shall bear no weight!

The search for equilibrium
shall balance this great plain.

We will take control
and depredate your Mother Star!

One last glimpse of light,
before Everlasting Dark!

Ruled!
By an unseen force.
Bred!
For Galactic Control.
Killed!
In order to serve.

We are the Deadfall,
octal and machine.

We are Legion,
inheritors of this Galaxy!

Keeper of the Fire
Prime Architect!

Destiny of Quadrality
Universal subsistence!

How can you fathom what lays beyond?

Existance in eleven dimensions is an absurdity
to beings that resonate in four dimensional Reality!

The colors and spectra.
Incomprehensible shock and awe!
You cry out in agony as our
mothership descends to cull!

Weak and pathetic!
You tremble and ask us why
We look down and all eight eyes 
vaporize what's left.

Our intent: Harvest souls for Mass Ascension.
Shed ourselves of corporeal form, through Galactic Oppression!
