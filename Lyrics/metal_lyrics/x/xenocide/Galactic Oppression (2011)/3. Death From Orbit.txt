[Music: T. Azad | Lyrics: T. Azad]

Eight limbs fall down from the sky!
We bring with us Armegaddon.

Fires will ignite and burn forever!
Charred remains of a gutted corpse.

No mercy, no remorse!
Killing and burning is all We know.

Melting flesh into the ground!
We will crush your puny world!

Killing!
Purging!
Burning!

Bones mishapen with bludgeoning tools!
Mass eradication takes its toll!

Filthy bipeds are no more,
the Arachnids will have total control!

Some of your kind, We shall keep!
To be our slaves, the shoes on our feet.

Once we've gathered what we need,
Your Star will collapse to ready our Fleet!

Killing!
Purging!
Burning!
Converting!
Souls, into meaning!

Death from Orbit [x4]

Foolish humans!
Freedom from tyranny is a myth.

The very same weapons, 
that promise you salvation
has left you adrift!

Scorched is the surface,
Your planet lays in ruin and dissonance!

And those who seek Ascension
must suppress those who inherit Intelligence!

Eternal beings never sleep,
They keep the fires burning!

The Matriarch of Sorrow,
the flagship of our fleet is returning!

From the void that stretches from our home
to the endless Sea of Stars!

Bringing with them brand new souls,
the end result:
Death from Orbit!
