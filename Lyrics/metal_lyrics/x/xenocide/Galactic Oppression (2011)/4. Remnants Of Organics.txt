[Music: T. Azad | Lyrics: T. Azad]

Pathetic beings believing in life after Death.
Eclipse!
There are no thoughts in the abyss!

Biological process convert and redistribute
Seeds of life!
viciously renewed.

A scorched world
that once harboured Life!
Nothing remains....
Remnants of Organics!

Your quest for a God has led you astray
Manipulation of a few is all that it takes!

To set in motion your path to blissful decay
Law of Life dictates your inevitable demise!

Catastrophic effect,
leaves your planet in burning war.

Oblivious to the true intent of your existance!

A scorched world
that once harboured Life!
Nothing remains....
Remnants of Organics!

Your quest for a God has led you astray
The Time has come!
Initiate Doomsday!

Sleep!
Your world is ours to keep!
Dream!
Your lucid thoughts feed our Ascension Machine!

Your soul forever trapped in the gravity swell!
Your Star holds you tight for eternity! 
Our harvester will encompass your ravaged system,
Stellar core will collapse and you shall all be free!

To be culled!
Your thoughts molested beyond reason!
Barred!
Enslaved to be a means to our Ascension!
Raped!
Mental degradation leads to chaos!

Comprehension no longer a tangible thought....

Physical bodies,
are necessary!
Organics and machines embrace to form a new entity!

To wage this War!
This Xenocide!

To conquer this Galaxy and exist outside of Time!

Probing your feeble minds.
No reaction!  Instill new stimuli!

Your souls hold the key,
to free us from this wretched Reality!

Minds ripped from mutilated
bodies rotting in the 
boiling surface temperatures.
You are begging for life!

We forsee the outcome of
every species that can
become a sentience to
challenge our divine goal must die!

Satisfied, We now move on.
Activate the Time Shatter!
Man more systems to exploit
before our goal is met.

And We are Ascended!
When We are Infinite!

Dissemination of knowledge,
the copying of a clone.
Entropy!
These shards will never reform!

Align!
Through the mastery of Life!
Matter reassembles into intricate design!
