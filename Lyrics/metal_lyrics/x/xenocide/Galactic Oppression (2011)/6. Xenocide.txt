[Music: T. Azad | Lyrics: T. Azad]

Through dirt, metal, warmth and light.
Hatred cold! Killing All! Those who live: Euthanize!

Severed! Waging Xenocide!
Amassing ships! Knowlege gained! The Stars Our supreme domain!

Pebbles, in the sky like flies.
The Queen demands, purging all sentience! Uniform!

Any and all opposition.
Crushed under Our Infinite might!

Amalgamation of a trillion souls.
Burning holes through space and time, the divine!

Dispersing from the Galactic Core!
Innovate the machines that will cause your defeat!

Eons likes sand for life to unfurl.
Swept away! Melting fast, rapid burn. Millions of worlds!

Eight swords wielded for every Star!
Obsolete flesh and blood, bringer of the cleansing fires!

Polar energy gathered for War
Triple redundancy ensures maximum effect!

Gravity and Temperature always win!
Reducing entire species to charred remains!

Xenocide: What a beautiful sight!
Upon your worlds We rain!

Entire Legions, invade your nations
with weapons that put you to your graves.

Your bodies are useless containers for the meek,
Your souls are what we seek!

Your fight us in three
dimensions so weak.

We rull all eleven plains!

Souls gathered, we power the machine.
Infinite Our soul reserves, finite Our energy!

No more viable Stars are left to harvest from this Galaxy!

Our Warships enter the dark matter void
We reach out to the fires that lay beyond!

Billions of spirals to subdue our greed,
trillions of points of energy!

Xenocide: What a beautiful sight!
Upon your worlds We rain!

Entire Legions, invade your nations
with weapons that put you to your graves.

Millions of years lie ahead,
massive migration to the heavens above.

Novae glow with such intensity,
never witnessed before!
