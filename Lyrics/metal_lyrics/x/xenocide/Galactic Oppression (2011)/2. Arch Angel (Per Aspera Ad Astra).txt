[Music: T. Azad | Lyrics: T. Azad]

Endless cycles, sleep gently.
Nothing but dark.

Sensors bring me back to life,
a discovery worth my time.

Humans? Organic life?
A breach of Galactic Law!

My creators sleep in eternal strife
their knowledge must be passed on!

Look to the fourth cluster of the Great Arm!
This is where Life first began!
From their homeworld they began to spread,
the disease known as Death!

This is a warning from those before,
told of the Deadfall's ways!
Now all but a few young races survive,
doomed to meet their fate!

My fathers fought in the Great Wars of Time!
Three million years of knowledge, purged!
I am a remnant, a relic, a weapon!
Use my databanks with utmost haste!

Outnumbered by a type three race.
Light years nor parsecs, no distance is safe!
The day fast approaches when you all will join,
Your Makers in the space that exists beyond Time!

Countless holes open up the fabric of Time!
Space becomes distorted as you watch in shock!
They Deadfall ships disperse then converge to herd the flock...
Nothing can stop this Death Machine!

No diversions necessary for their cause,
Heartless Force!
From the skies they fall!

Star after star collapse to meet their needs,
Your region of Space goes dark 
for all Time!
