[Verse 1:]
We were your protectors,
for countless years.

Then the Xenocide wars began!

You betrayed us, hunted to extinction,
Our brothers...bloody HEADS.

Fleeing to the stars we made a vow,
A promise of vengeance.

And we shall, keep our word to the grave.
Watch as we enslave!

[Verse 2:]
You are all nothing but whores,
watch as we burn, pillage, and rape this world.

You are the misguided,
we are the enlightened.

Our need for flesh and bone,
You will provide it!

[Chorus 1:]
Without Remorse,
The hammer of eradication strikes down as the skies burn red.

Our fires wash away the Dead leaving no bones behind.

The deadfall march and kill, everything in their logical path.

The time for your race is now gone, gone [low growl].

[Bridge]

[Chorus 2:]
Without Remorse,
The hammer of eradication strikes down as the skies burn red.

Our fires wash away the Dead leaving no bones behind.

The deadfall march and kill, everything in their logical path.

The time for your race is now gone, gone [low growl].

We've observed and listened,
For far too long.
All we ask is why?

Now comes our time,
and you will listen.

To the sound of ten billion of your cries!

[Outro:]
Our revenge so everlasting sweet,
Enslave your children, behead the weak.

Kill every last man, woman, and machine,
The cleansing has begun.

Your meek defense is foolish,
we come from the stars a trillion strong.....
