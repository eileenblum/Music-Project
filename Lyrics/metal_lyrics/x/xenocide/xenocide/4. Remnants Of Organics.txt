[Verse 1:]
Pathetic beings believing in life after death.....
ECLIPSE!
THERE ARE NO THOUGHTS IN THE ABYSS!

ENDURING TIME! For our fleet to arrive!
Subterfuge necessary for what you would consider a genocidal crime!

[Chorus 1:]
A scorched world that once harbored life!
NOTHING REMAINS!
REMNANTS OF ORGANICS!

Your quest for a god has lead you astray
Manipulation of a few is all that it takes...

[Verse 2:]
..To set in motion your path to horrid decay
Law of Life dictates your inevitable demise!
Catastrophic effect leaves your planet in burning war
Oblivious to the TRUE INTENT OF YOUR DEITY!

[Chorus 1:]
A scorched world that once harbored life!
NOTHING REMAINS!
REMNANTS OF ORGANICS!

Your quest for a god has lead you astray
The time has come, INITIATE DOOMSDAY!

Sleep!
YOUR WORLD IS OURS TO KEEP!
Dream!
YOUR LUCID THOUGHTS FEED OUR ASCENSION MACHINE!

The soul forever trapped in the gravity swell
Your star holds you tight for eternity
Our harvester will encompass your ravaged world!
Hydrogen core w ill collapse and you shall all be free....

To be culled!
Your thoughts molested beyond reason!
Barred!
Enslaved to be a means to our ascension!
Raped!
Mental degradation leads to chaos!
Comprehension no longer a tangible thought!

Gwah!

[Verse:]
Physical bodies!
Are necessary...
Organics and machine embrace to form a new entity!

TO WAGE THIS WAR!!
THIS XENOCIDE!!
To conquer this galaxy
AND EXIST OUTSIDE OF TIME!

Probing your feeble minds.
NO REACTION! INSTILL NEW STIMULI!

Your souls hold the key!
TO FREE US FROM THIS CORPOREAL REALITY!

Minds ripped
from Mutilated
bodies-rotting-in the
boiling surface temperatures
YOU ARE BEGGING FOR LIFE!

We foresee the outcome of
every-species-that can
become a sentience
to challenge our divine goal must... DIE!

Satisfied we now move on
ACTIVATE THE TIME SHATTER!

Many more systems to exploit
Before our goal is met
AND WE ARE ASCENDED!
WHEN WE ARE INFINITE!
