[Music &amp; lyrics by Xerath]

These perfect colours
Fill the skies
As a monument
An ending told
Escape this dream
In a world of Nocturnum
An exercise in ignorance
Without, fiction, promise, addiction
I see the flaws in its entirety
An understanding
A flame pushing heat against rain
Time against self, and day against night
This silence all too real, a reminder
Without fiction or dream
As it waits in the distance
All of time, all the infinite time
As it haunts its creation

Always follow the vision
Lying through silence
Everlasting time
