[Music &amp; lyrics by Xerath]

Detached at any moment
The great beyond
Ruthless lament
Just a facet of life
Just a facet of time in death's eyes
The one, the end, the only truth
When it sinks,
You realise your story
Beyond reason we turn
The call, the presence
Of illusion
Illusions of mind
Of mind
Of the lucid soul
Memories, of darkness within
Us all
I am the victim of a new world
With false corruption
New world desire for blood shed
Behind the powers that be
Dictates it all
Man
