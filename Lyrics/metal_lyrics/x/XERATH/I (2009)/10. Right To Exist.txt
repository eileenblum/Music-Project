[Music &amp; lyrics by Xerath]

Will you pass on this moment
To experience the world as it is
As corrupt as it may be
Still affords you the chance to exist
Exist
A precious commodity if you focus
On present without presiding times
We have never been the stewards of this life
Merely fleeting
Lie
Perfection cannot be followed
Nor is it an endeavor for this life
see through my eyes
Scale or size matter not to the many
Only shots in the dark
The overseer of nothing
Controlling one at a time
Welcome
Welcome to a level idea of consequence
Ignore your brothers as aggressors
And let your time he play out as it should
Right to exist
