[Music &amp; lyrics by Xerath]

Insane lies
Godless desire
Awaken from indoctrine
A means to an end, again
Now at peace within
Within sober reality
Reliving a single action
Amidst a cold duality
Intrenity can begin

[Chorus:]
Our fragile minds
We've sworn on Intrenity
Our fragile minds
Cast their doubts

Endless crimes
Timeless desire
Irrepressible hate
Irreversible pain
It's too late...
Balanced and capable
Even, just and stable
Balance of instincts
Collective minds tell us nothing,
Nothing
