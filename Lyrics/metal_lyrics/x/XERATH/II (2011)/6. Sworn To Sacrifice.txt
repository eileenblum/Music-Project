Sworn to forever bow to a god of vengeance
Forever in servitude to predestination
Cowards hiding behind rapture scripture promises
Man made fucking policy
Bullshit fucking ideology

These books wont get you shit boy
This life not good enough for you?

Die so slowly
Divine and holy
Confused sense of entitlement
Across the board
Why does all other life turn to dust
But yet somehow you're immortalized

Give me some sign that you can reason
Could you conceive there are no reasons?
Liars to 'yourselves
Stories to me
A law into you
Taking innocence to the grave
Sworn to sacrifice

Incurable mind disease
The prison of contained thought
The point of death for all men
You will never believe
We're not the enemies you want to free
The devils kin
Your model of sin

A figure to which of death prophet
A guard against any and all progress
