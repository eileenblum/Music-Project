Summoned to the call of arms
You've prayed for it to come
For so long it's been your will
To turn your hand to the trigger

Words got to mean so little 
Appeasement to silence the anger 
Now beyond any tolerance for peace
It is our will to destroy the lesser people

Like us, you breath
Under fire
We're almost the same
No more ways
To know your place
To see beyond your days

Bullets can always break the silence 
Where before lies indifference and pain
Silence 
Spirit

It is our will to diminish your spirits and gods
