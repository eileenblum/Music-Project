Mistaken men have chosen to make
An entire race a footnote in history
And these men in the sea of authority
Shadow their guilt in the darkness of collusion

They distance themselves from the cold truth

Preaching necessity like fucking despots
The type of people who see cities as pinpoints
Wash their hands in their own injustice
Armed with the power of gods

They speak carelessly of forthcoming
Casualties of war

Get their people to subscribe to their blueprint of death
Far away people will wake to their final breath
This is the dawn of nuclear self eradication

Far away people will wake to their final breath
Their graves are marked out by black shadows
