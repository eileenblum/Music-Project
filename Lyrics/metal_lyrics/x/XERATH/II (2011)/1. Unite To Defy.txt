A man stands before a peasant nation
Self-proclaimed, in corruption instilled
Through a lineage
He demands war, against all who don't follow.
And confused his people stand and say
Unite to defy

Still he presides over any chance of free thought
Human need seems to create these demigods
Still confused his people stand and say
Unite to defy

Beyond the veil, the first world, blind pursuit only to repeat
Figureheads always call for arms
A fools war
