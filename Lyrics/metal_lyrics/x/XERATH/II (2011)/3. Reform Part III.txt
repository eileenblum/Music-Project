The greater power of the industrial world
Will look at people of barren lands
In condemnation of their injustice
They will seek to reform

Bureaucratic talk lays the foundation
The people are spun for their blessings
No one wise to the crooked smiles
Hearts and minds, fuel for the fire

You're needed to support an ultimatum
for fear protects war doctrine
Your paranoia

Throw around words of pursuasion
Extremist, radical, stewards of death
Stems from children of irrational belief
Ideology breeding fucking parasitical

You're needed to support an ultimatum
for fear protects war doctrine
Your paranoia enables the forward path
Your precious civil liberty
