One day amongst the fires
You're left but staring down at yourself
Your flesh body is lifeless
Now among the glorious dead

So down I fell to meet the fires
Gone, worlds apart
From my shell, life beyond life
Death, too unreal

One day beyond my lifetime
I met no prophets or angels
I saw no deity I owed my sins
Now amongst the glorious dead
