The seed is planted
A change of the horizon
Those you once knew are now the passengers
Still breathing bodies inhabited by the others
Born of a generation not meant for this world

I know now
Amidst the new life I will stay
No more to die
Amidst the born I will stay

We all must one day say goodbue to our fathers
Through silence they come to know themselves
There is no way we shall ever know them
Our lives stripped of meaning and purpose

A child of the infinite
We will all become
