Resurrected, born again to issue death's hand
I hold dominion, I oversee the end of man
Hold dominion

Will life divide my law, cannot bring the fall
I came to cleanse with fire
And I have brought death to all
I hold dominion
Bring down these mortal walls
Burn for dead souls

My dying soul, no longer own
Life turns to stone, we don't belong

Burn for dead souls
Flesh 
Burned
Dead
