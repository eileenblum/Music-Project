These streets are just borrowed scenes
These streets are just walking dreams
This city is autonomy

Life by permanent inquest through me
Trial by constant trailing eyes
This city is autonomy

I own your every breath
I am the purest gonvernment
You are mere commodity
To my eyes you have been seen
You have been seen

Constantly it lies in wait for me
I twist to become the living bait
This city is autonomy

I feel its ever presence
All I fear
Its cold dead stare, its heart of stone
This city is autonomy

You have been seen
