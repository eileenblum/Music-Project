A buried single warning
Danger which does not reflect
The shadow is removed, bathed in light
Forces concealed

A signal is sent, the song of distant earth
Minds evaporate with incomprehension
The sentinel speaks a language unknown
Awakening intelligence

The arrival of thought
Born in pain we suffer and learn
Through perpetual change we consume and divide

The small star bursts in my hand
Tools once used to destroy this world we left behind
We left behind
