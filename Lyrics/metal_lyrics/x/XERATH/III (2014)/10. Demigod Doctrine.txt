How easily it feeds the mind
A bitter string of lies
It force fed the irrational
Where mercy has no remit now
Folklore turns my thought so sour
I started with the principles in full

A ghost of your own choice
A figment of your own voice
A shadow of your former self
How easily it feeds the mind

(Now I have the doctrine
So bleak and simple)
How it feeds the mind
A bitter string of lies

Once principled within mind
To public doctrine of the time
I gave away my soul so cheap
I resign myself to living sleep
We might have want to spread the shame
We force on those who want the same
Sat on a demigods pedestal
