The route of thousands
The exodus of sleep
Suspended DNA
The gifted, the intelligent, the powerful
Fleeing the giver of birth

Our brightest flame grows too bright
The seas evaporate and land is scorched
Red giant brings its fist down
Unwavering, unflinching, eternal, perpetual change

Only a few choose to witness
Only a few are prepared

To witness to cataclysm of worlds

Their backs turn, the pass is erased
Truly there is no constant
The surviving race will have always been
One direction
Only future

There is no way home
We're too far away, far gone
There no, we have no way home
We're but far away light
Can never look back
