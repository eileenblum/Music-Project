Where death but all wholly reigns
They call upon a new found strength
They call on all but mercy
They sever death's unbinding chains

His body brings the air of the gods
His mind is blind to fear
He will defy your natural law
He sees

I see only my human need for your pain
I am death defiant no more

Where death is all that remains
There exists a strength of will
To turn the tides
Of life that abides
By only impossibility

I call a guardian life force
I am a death apparition
I am death defiant
Death has no dominion here
For it has no more fear to give
To forego pain and live
