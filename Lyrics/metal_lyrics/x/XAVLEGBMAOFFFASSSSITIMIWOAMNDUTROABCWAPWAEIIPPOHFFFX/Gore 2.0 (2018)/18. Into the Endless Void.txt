Lost in outer space
Meant to find our way home
"OH NO! The oxygen is running low!"
I begin to lose myself...
Reality of death sets in
I can feel my veins turn to ice in this cold casket

On our search for home we witnessed a glimpse of hope
A dark orb shrouded in mystery!!!

Mesmerised by its magnificent sight
We are sucked into the shadows
Torn apart as our reality warps right before our very eyes
My pain is gone is this the end of it all???
My body is ripped to shreds
Pieced together I reanimate
Born to this world again...

"Is this a dream or is this a sign???
Is this of this world or is this divine???"

Walking through plains I have never seen
I lay my eyes upon an alien being...
Long fingers point at me
I begin to shake
I cannot breathe
Scalpels cut my anus deep
Who knows what happened to me...

Scalpels sliced me open
I have wounds as proof of my torture
My crew has been abducted
Our memory erased...
Our ship headed towards another black hole
To be torn apart
Destination unknown...

Trapped in another realm for eternity!
Lost in outer space
Drifting hopelessly
Reality begins to warp until we make it our alive

My molecules are ripped and flayed
Born unto this world I shall be remade
I'll experience nonexistence
Blackened emotions, feel the resistance!

Star dust and sound waves litter my path
Thousands of light years
You do the math
Pieced together I reanimate
Born to this world again...
