March! Left! Right!
Ants! Marching to the funkiest beat!
March! Left! Right!
Ants! Marching to the funkiest beat!

Marching silently
Comin' to your homes to invade your town!
Right beneath your feet
Searching for something to eat!
Foraging for our queen
We are the insect elite!
Nothing you can do!
There are strength in numbers!

Rendezvous at cupboard A for some tasty treats!
We'll leave this place a barren wasteland!

MARCH! LEFT! RIGHT!
Ants! Marching to the funkiest beat!
Conquer!
Destroy!
Devour!
Overthrow!

You will die!
You are doomed!
From the moment you summoned me (summoned me)
All your food gone to waste!
From the moment you summoned me (summoned me)
Peer into my anatomy and you'll kindly see that my species is not to be messed with!
