Looking over my shoulder
I see that reaper creeping
Death is near
So I keep my finger on the trigger of my nine (of my nine)
Creepin' through the hood
Fellas up to no good
There is death in the air (death in the air)
Rolling deep through your set with my black ski mask and my hood up tight
(Hood up tight)
40 in my hand and blunt lit on my right
Your family won't live to see the light
Through all this death and despair
She is always there
This hoe has me hooked on her vibe
Her essence fills my body
I can feel her everywhere
Mary Jane take me into the light
Grinding it up
Rolling it up
Smoking it
Cutting it up
Stacking a bowl
Smoke a hit
Bloodshot eyes, four Xannies in my veins
Fuck, I'll be lucky if I make it through today
Grinding it up
Rolling it up
Fuck a bitch
Loading it up
Strappin' it up
Bust a nine
Death is near
So I keep my finger on the trigger of my nine (of my nine)
Invoke The Smoke
Yeah
Invoke the smoke
Ouuuuuu
Invoke the smoke
Smoking bong hits every night
'Til the break of dawn
Invoke the smoke
Life is shit and we're all gonna die might as well grab a bong and come get high
And come get high
And come get high
And come get high
