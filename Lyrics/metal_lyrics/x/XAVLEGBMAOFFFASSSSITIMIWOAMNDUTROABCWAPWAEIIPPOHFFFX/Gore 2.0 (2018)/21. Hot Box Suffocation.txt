Light that shit up!
Yeah!
Enclosed panic room. No windows!
No windows or oxygen coming through!
Death is imminent as they devour all
Edibles unable to fathom the treasure
The flavor profile of the terpenes
Genetically modified to...
Have an unimaginable flavor profile
Stack them up!
Ready to ignite!
Sparking up spliffs!
Burning up the pipes
Hot-boxing inside the bunker!
No escape your fate has already been determined!
There is no escape
Smoke replaces air!
You're all doomed to
Hotbox suffocation!
A stoners dream way to die
You're the lucky ones chosen tonight!
This room fills with smoke...
Hotbox suffocation!
Inhaling the thick smoke hold it and keep it in filling up the lungs
Lungs burst exasperated coughing up blood and phlegm
Chocking on carbon dioxide this is the end
Locked away forgotten and preserved with Mary Jane
What remains will be left here
Cement will fill up the cracks
You will soon be forgotten
There is no escape
Smoke replaces air!
You're all doomed to
Hotbox suffocation!
A stoners dream way to die
You're the lucky ones chosen tonight!
This room fills with smoke...
Hotbox suffocation!
The end is near then will gut you and infuse you with my weed
Then fill you up with my seed and start the preparation of cooking your meat
My gastronomy has hit its peak a Michelin chef has nothing on me
Now gag and die so I can eat
