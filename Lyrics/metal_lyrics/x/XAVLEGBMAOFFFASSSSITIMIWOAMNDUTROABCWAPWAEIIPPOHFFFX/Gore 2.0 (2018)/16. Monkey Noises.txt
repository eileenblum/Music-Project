Evolved as a result of multiple experiments!
We shall enslave you all and make this planet ours again!
Stepping through the trees
I couldn't believe this marvelous world right beneath our feet
We'll take it for our own now!
Chaos reigns!
Legion!
Divide and conquer!
Human scum!
[Guttural]
Ah!
Primate brethren! Gather now or die!
Primate brethren! Gather now or die!
Yeah!
Primates shall rule the earth once more
We'll begin experiments on you!
Our previous life was such a bore
We'll take injustice no more!
Beating our chest as we march into war!
Demanding control of the new found world!
[Groovy guttural dance club]
We will dominate once more!
Primates on top of the food chain!
Where our ancestors used to be!
Now!
Chaos reigns!
Legion!
Divide and conquer!
Human scum!
Our mind and consciousness expanding
As we learn the tools of this planet
Artificial intelligence shall be
The gateway to our kingdom!
We will reinforce our place in the universe
And annihilate all hierarchy
Tearing down every establishment
Reigning true! Sign of power no more!
We won't be victim to this human species any more!
