Ripping out the intestines from a lobotomized planet!
Ravaging through the meat trying to remove the pus!
Ravaging through the meat trying to remove the pus!
Carnem Comedenti!
Mutating the bioorganisms into pulsating muscle!
Genetically altering the planet to feed our hunger!
Sinew and fat making up the skin layers!
Now tendon and brawn that used to be plant matter!
Predators of planets they feast on blood and GORE!
Flesh eating cannibals devouring all protoplasm!
With the ability to sense and conduct stimuli!

[Cat Cannibal guest feature:]
'Craving its beating heart!
A species of rapacious scum!'

Peeling away at the layers of skin!
Genetically altering the planet to feed our hunger!
Sinew and fat making up the skin layers!
Now tendon and brawn that used to be plant matter!
Predators of planets they feast on blood and gore!

Treading through soggy flesh my feet are soaking wet with blood!

Flesh eating cannibals devouring all protoplasm!
With the ability to sense and conduct stimuli!

[Cat Cannibal guest feature:]
'Craving its beating heart!
A species of rapacious scum!'

Behold planet Gore!
We feast yet again!
Burning every lesion before septicaemia sets in!
Organs lie upon the ground no justice to be found!
Carving at this meat to the rhythm of the beat!
This is my retreat!

This is a planet made of gore!
This is a planet made of gore!
