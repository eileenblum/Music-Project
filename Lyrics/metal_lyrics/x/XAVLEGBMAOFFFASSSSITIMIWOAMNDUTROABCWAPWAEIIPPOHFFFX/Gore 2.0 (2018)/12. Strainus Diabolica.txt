A sentient strain brought down from the gods
It's said to contain infinite knowledge!
Within its molecular structure lies the answer
To all questions that the universe has locked away!
A hybrid so pure to be designed as pure sin
The consequence means certain death for those who take a toke
From the blackened depths of your soul!
To the deepest crevice of your consciousness!
Its only goal is to erase and replace with eternal knowledge!
Yeah!
Bleh!
Its flowers cloaked in a thick layer of white crystals!
Trichomes
Tetrahydrocannabinol
This strain is beyond all human comprehension
Its DNA adapted to our atmospheric pressure!
Growing in any environment or climate!
The ultimate marijuana plant!
