Exhumed skeletal uprising!
Deep beneath the earth crust lies an army of cursed dead soldiers
Awaiting their chance at redemption!
Their bodies have decayed there's nothing left but bones!
Skeletal frames dried to perfection
Underground furnaces forge them weapons of war!
Clanking bones and skeletal shields forever more!
You may be just flesh and bone but one day you shall atone!
Your flesh will fall away as you decay!
A skeletal soldier was born that day!

C'mon soldiers it's time to ride!
Grab your swords and shields 'cause we're in for a fight!
50 000 Gallons of calcium-rich milk for soldiers on the front line!
March! March!
Reapers of earth!
Marching to the surface
Reality reversed!
Speaking in tongues!
Natural selection!
Kill all above, reality reflected!

Reapers of earth!

Skeletal slamdown!
Skeletal slamdown!

The skeletal army has won this war by force!
The skeletal army has gone and killed us all!
