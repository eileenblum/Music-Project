Turn the pages of evil
Read with ill intent
To spread this deadly gospel
We unholy are sent

Life to us is meaningless
Death is what we need
Don't be kind and generous
Turn to hate and greed

[Chorus:]
Within these evil pages
Death not life is found
Tales of pain and torture
All of these are bound

Read the words within here
Defy the holy lord
Listen to us, cause death
Spread the evil word
Don't be frightened by the church
That's just what they want
Smash their crosses and statues
Destroy the holy front

[Chorus]

Now that you are with us
Help us in our quest
To rid the world of goodness
Wipe out the kindly rest
Brutalize the Bible classes
One by one attack
But leave them be in dark peace
If the Bible is black
