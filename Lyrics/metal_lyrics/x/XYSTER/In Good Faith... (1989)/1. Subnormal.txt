You're no use to man, born with half a brain
A total waste of life, misery making being
Destruction at birth would have been the best
For you and your family, the doctors whose time you waste

[Chorus:]
A wasted human shell
Controlled by half a brain
No use to mankind
A complete and total waste...
Subnormal

Crying in your bed, waking in the night
Mother is distraught, by your uselessness
You will never work, a weight around their neck
She wishes you were dead, for her that would be best

[Chorus]

"With luck you'll die young," he's thinking to himself
Hoping for your death by life consuming disease

Father takes no pride in his useless son
Nothing to be proud, a wasted human shell
"With luck you'll die young," he's thinking to himself
Hoping for your death by life consuming disease
