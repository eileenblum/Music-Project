humans torture humans - for their god 

they break its wills - for their god
they nailed bodies to the cross - for their god
they let pyres burn - for their god

centuries went by full of war, death and sorrow
and the adored god was not able to do anything against it

[Refr:]
but the god to which belongs their belief and their soul
doesnÂ´t exist donÂ´t believe their lies,
liberate the thoughts of your brain and have the courage
to believe in your own power

mothers sacrificed their children - for their god
walled in alive - for their god
they died of their pains - for their god
The fire of their sins burns - for their god

centuries went by full of war, death and sorrow
and the adored god was not able to do anything against it

[Refr:]
but the god to which belongs their belief and their soul doesnÂ´t exist donÂ´t believe their lies,
liberate the thoughts of your brain and have the courage
to believe in your own power

for your god
for your god
for your god
