Wipe your tears falling down
from your eyes and forget me
no need to be hurted anymore

go away from me now
I don't know what is love
no need to be hurted anymore

oh! I'm looking at you
I'll lose control of myself

wipe your tears falling down
from your eyes and forget me
no need to be hurted anymore
all vision's going to vanish...
