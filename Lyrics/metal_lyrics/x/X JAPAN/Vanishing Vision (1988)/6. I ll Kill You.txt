It's all over with me now
And i'll kill you
You changed me
You drove me mad
You robbed me of my loving, that's you

Still i'm sad
That you betrayed me
It's all over with me now
And all over with me now
And i'll kill you

Don't (Let)
Let me go un (Checked)
I've gotta go (Wild)
Don't (Let)
Let me go un (Checked)
I've gotta go (Wild)

Don't call this dream or fantasy
Nobody knows my soul burned as fire
Why my heart was broken so heavy
You might know my love was for you

You know [3 times]
Oh, go to the grave together

[Lead: Hide]

It's all over with me now
And i'll kill you
You changed me
You drove me mad
You robbed me of my loving, that's you

I'll kill you (I'll kill you... you'll go to the grave with me)
I'll kill you
