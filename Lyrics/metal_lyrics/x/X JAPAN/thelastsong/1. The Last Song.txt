Watching the stars till they're gone
Like an actor all alone
Who never knew the story he was in
Who never knew the story ends.
Like the sky reflecting my heart
All the colors become visible
When the morning begins
I'll read last line

Owaranai ame dakishimeta yoru ga asa o mukaeru
Kokoro wa mada nureta mama

In endless rain I've been walking
Like a poet feeling pain
Trying to find the answers
Trying to hide the tears
But it was just a circle
That never ends
When the rain stops, I'll turn the page
The page of the first chapter
Kizutsuku dake kizutsuite wakatta hazu no kotae o
Doutshite mada doui kaketeru
Am I wrong to be hurt
Am I wrong to feel pain
Am I wrong to be in the rain
Am I wrong to wish the night won't end
Am I wrong to cry
But I know, It's not wrong to sing The Last Song
Cause forever fades

Kigatsukeba mata hikari-yoru no sora o mitsumeteru
Sukoshi-zutsu kiete yuku OUR MEMORIES
Kizutsuku dake kizutsuite wakatta hazu no kotae o
Doutshite mada dou ikaketeru

I see red
I see blue
But the silver lining gradually takes over
When the morning begins
I'll be in the next chapter

Owaranai ame dakishimeta yoru ga asa o mukaeru
Kokoro wa mada nureta mama
Kizutsuku dake kizutsuite wakatta hazu no kotae o
Dou shite mada dou ikaketeru
