zawameki dake ga   kokoro wo sashite
kikoenai   mune no toiki
toki wo wasurete   motome samayou
takanaru omoi   nurashite

Run away from reality   I've been crying in the dream
kÃ´ri tsuita toki ni furuete
yugande mienai   kioku kasaneru
kanashimi ga   kieru made

* You say anything   kizutsuke au kotoba demo
Say anything   tachikirenai kokoro ni
You say anything   Just tell me all your sweet lies
Say anything   enji kirenai kokoro ni

If I can go back to where I've been
yume no naka ni dake ikite
owaranai ame ni nureru
nagareru namida wo hakujitsu yume ni somete

You say anything   Whatever you like to say to me
Say anything   You leave me out of my eyes
You say anything   All I can hear is voice from dream
Say anything   You can dry my every tear

akari no kieta   On the stage   hitori mitsumete
tÃ´risugita hibi ni dakareru
kowashite kure nani mo ka mo   kazatta ai mo
toki no suna ni kieru made

*

Close your eyes
and I'll kill you in the rain
kirei ni koroshi aeba
zÃ´ka no bara ni umoreta
shijin no namida wa kioku ni nagasarete

Time may change my life
But my heart remains the same to you
Time may change your heart
My love for you never changes

You say anything   kizutsuke au kotoba demo
Say anything   tachi kirenai kokoro ni

You say anything...   Say anything
Now you've gone away
Where can I go from here?
Say anything...   Say anything...

"I believed
If time passes, everything
turns into beauty
If the rains stop, tears clean
the scars of memory away
Everything starts weaning fresh colors
Every sound begins playing
a heartfelt melody
Jealousy embelishes a page of the epic
Desire is embraced in a dream
But my mind is still in chaos and....."
