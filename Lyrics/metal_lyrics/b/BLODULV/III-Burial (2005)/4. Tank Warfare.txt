Subzero triumphant evil
Freezing racing demonic disorder
Obscured by his shadowland
Savage are the masters own

In the trenches of the gutterwar
Turn to death by the bloodwolf invertion
Minds forever locked into, cold fucking murder

You know you are a killer true
These drugs will never bring you peace
Enveloped by the spirits dark
You are counting your dead
And it smells like tank warfare

Slaveskin banner high
Satan artillery scorching
Native hammer crushing
Addicted to the stench of dying
To the raping of the slain
