Relentless enslaver triumphant
A touch of Midas, the golden hammer
Cruelty by might brought oppression by force
Moonstruck pale, with the bleeding scars of Triton

Childskull totem sacrificial
Slain under this cold imperial daze
Teeth grows black with blood of angel
Praised be the sickness, praise and hail

A higher form of spiritual reign
Tyrannic, barbaric, monumental
Rigor mortis rules this flesh
Total supremacy, the cursed old sanctum

Mercury blooded master breed
Celestial titans unmerciful
Our imperial sanctum burns the land

Cold breath of war upon this seal
Hard hands of murder upon this earth
