Rebel drug abundant
This dark old delicium
By no gods condoned
Worn out skin at daybreak
Bleed this goat
Cold with gravesoil
Rancid and torn
Sick with sulphur
Rusted scraps of Orcus
A scabbed lung prophecy
Dismal traces of sanity
Devilfangs dug in deep
Store the building twilight
Hard in skeletal marrow
This disease have eyes
Satan boils the venom black
Be this drunken dawn a bastard
Or a saint for raping
Be these dogdays a curse
Or a sign that we must murder
