I will scourge as a plague
By the madman's call, by the shreds of skin
Silver moon, silver blade
I will stalk unseen, I will burn the screen

Dark blue mind, undulating, choking
Attainable strength lies in their blood
Cloak of depression, lost within
Cold is the steel, warm is the flesh

A lethal addiction
The nullness source
The numbness I hail
Bodies lie still, turning grey
The affliction eternal
This bastard cunt of goat

Hermitage of flesh in submission
Must maintain the mass of murder
This requiem, my offering
