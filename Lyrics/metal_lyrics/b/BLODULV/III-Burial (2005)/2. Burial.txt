Burial brought by harsh addiction
Death on hard ground dark destructive
Dragging bones over wastelands deaddry
Turning weary, cold and dying

Alcohol will blur these eyes
Witches brew shall turn this skin
Cursing liquid forces this blood
A being cold murder struck

Filthy blood through rotted veins
Yet another grimfoul sickness
Death the sharpest blade to swallow
Life the easiest wings to burn

Triumph of the darkwood moondust craving
A sanctuary black with despair
With bonehard determination
Satans' straydogs pacing hellwards
