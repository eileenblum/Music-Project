Within hostile fire crawls the king snake
Violent assault spearhead to crush
The soil wants blood
And fate craves death

Haubitser hellfire heretic
Scorched earth anti-christian
Serpent slithers front by front
Death lies thick, hate shall engulf

The icy determination
The rusted heavy steel
From the gutters of humanity
We're painted for war

We shall guide the seven plagues of hell
This age lies claimed for us
The deathladen destroyers
The painridden, the rulers
