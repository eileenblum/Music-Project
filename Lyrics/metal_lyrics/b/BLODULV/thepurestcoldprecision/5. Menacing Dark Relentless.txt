Alpha male in skin of wolf
Master cold on throne of bone
This sickness rides with iron fist
Pentagram dopefiend bloodlust

With the purest cold precision
Superior twisted evil
Burn the soul with spiteful scorn
Call on the beast with the razor hoofs

Carve from those gallows a dagger
Crooked wooden Satan black
The flesh of man, the blood of goat
Infernal resistance, curse of war

Menacing dark relentless
Massive winter draws this way
Here burns a colder demos hatred
The scraps of life, turns to dirt

Cosmic lunacy, loss of mercy
Stabs the heart, cuts the mark
