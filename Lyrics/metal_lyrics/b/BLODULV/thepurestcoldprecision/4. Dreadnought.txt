On autumns rancid soil
Coldness seeping from my wounds
Curls my skin with the angst of centuries
This my devils call, my grim obsession

In the eerie gloom of this night
Under the branches of the hanging tree
I, the dreadnought
This time shall not falter
Thunderous crack of demon tails
Ensnares my mind with twisted lore
Words that pierce like tusks of beasts
Calling me down, deeper down

Unto this I must suffer
Under him I must serve
In Octobers reeking earth
I am doomed once more
