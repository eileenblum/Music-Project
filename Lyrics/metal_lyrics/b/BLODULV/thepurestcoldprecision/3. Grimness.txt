Marked by the forces
By the scalding metal burns
Plunged into swamplands unknown
He locks now his chokehold

Deathly pale in forestall seclusion
Cursing the starlight, fearing the day
With Satan willing
This steel shall purge

Trollish waters black
Wooden lungs will rupture
These driving winds
As hear, greyhard

Skull like breathing shadow
Burrowed deep in senses
Tore my flesh asunder
Sharp white light aflame
Forced down these murder depths

By scorn, by might
By the killing hand
By night, by death
Grimness so foul
