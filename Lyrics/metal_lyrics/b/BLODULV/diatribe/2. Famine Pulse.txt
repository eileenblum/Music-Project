Crush this crumbling shell of man
Break the seal of this dog earth
Enrage the dormant monger of war
Scourge and burn, no term of grace

I survey the cursing plague wall
I wear scars of war ignition
I am he who eats the time thrall
I shall doom the gods with famine pulse

Weaving skin of wreckage and decay
Through engulfing duskfall dementia
Passed the gates and to the death
Below the earth and to the heart
Graven be the signs, wicked be the ways

Chronic soulside sickness
Flesh that's born and raised for slaughter
Dead of winter, dead of night
All the world, pray unto me
