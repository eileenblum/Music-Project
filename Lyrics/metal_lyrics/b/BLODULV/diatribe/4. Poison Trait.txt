Overture of rising opposition
Driven forge of afflicted tolerance
Killing god of air and water
Deconstruction true unholy

Poison trait, poisoned fist
Renegade wings of defiance
Strong conviction, blood is hostile
Non conforming demon will

Monarch cast in sulfur
Deviant of trustless cold
Shoulder the grudge of millenniums two
Be the night that ends the days

In hoc signo vinces
Satan sovereignty
War by the will of rebel minds
Diatribe of ashen blood
