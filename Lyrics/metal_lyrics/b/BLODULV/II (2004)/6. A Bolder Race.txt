Of wolfen dynasty and devil wings
Their icy blade draws blood
Drains this dying vessel
Beastly curse awakened

The crack of two fold demon whips
Tears the surface of the soul
Fall into ruthless maiming disorder
Succumb to the murderous drug of war

Relentless pounding in mind so frail
Words of wisdom, poetry ablaze
The black serpents doom, lurking ever near

Satan's firstborn, the bolder race
Burns through this torrent of disgust
Unquenchable this thirst for death
Hunts as one, the minions of dark

A bolder race
Pale as the new snow
Erasing the past
Burning the books
