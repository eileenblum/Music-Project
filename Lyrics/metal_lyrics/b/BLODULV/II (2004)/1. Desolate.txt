Sore cold forest slavery
Under the rigors of winter
Violent shadows killed these lands
Fierce beasts of north raped this child

Charred, desolate
Burning soil, demons soar
Crushed, desolate
Torn wings, foulness in blood
Forever, desolate
Laid to waste

Inherit coldness of the soul
By rulers brought to conquer
Forcing the god hand
The dark Satan vanguard

Call this breed a murderous cancer
In the wretched realm of cruelty
Barbed wire minds in state of decay
Until tepid Christ blood stains his lips again

Draining away
The razor void infernal
Burnt to black
The desolate scape eternal
