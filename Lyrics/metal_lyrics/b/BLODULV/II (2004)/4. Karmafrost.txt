Buried in filth, shocked fury in chaos
Where darkness grows, shadows weep
Mouth drooling blood, no light enters this place

Karmafrost - engineered by Satan
Hatred still going strong
Silencer of the holy
Wasteland mentality - Karmafrost
Pale death destroy me
Karmafrost sharpen thy teeth

Soul numb and angst raped
Forever nourished by evil
Shadow fevered war lust, injected for survival
Life will never wound me, ashes be my grave

Black nails torn
Voice still rotten
Spewing my lungs out
Stillborn northern fury
Fingers clawing dirt
