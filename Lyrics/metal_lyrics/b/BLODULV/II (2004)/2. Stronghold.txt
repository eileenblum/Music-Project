Locked within Luciferian stronghold
A damnation terminal
Makes this flesh the trigger
Predatory action must be taken

Under sweeping wings burnt cold
Doomed hard and forever more
Way down in the dark
Utter death has been lurking

This beast a hard drugged assassin
Bearing fangs and weapons of murder
Acid surging blood flow
Bleed by own hand, defiance ungodly

By withered tongue unspoken
Cries of thorn clad rebellion
Bury morals deep in the ground
Turn this face to stone

Leave veins all wide open
Turn as ice so cold
Leave the forest frozen
Called by the black dust choirs
