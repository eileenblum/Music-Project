This fog is an obsession
Chills a doom filled dusk
Lance this would-be silence
Ravenous deathly hunger

Kills severe dawn intrusion
Dogs' blood filth distorts
Regeneration of ill tempered war lust
Devastate Sion

Bent moon wise, ways all murderous
Crooked, black most utterly evil

Intruding dawn distortion
Once buried by morning, now cold flesh motion
Cries for Satan's choking breath
I cruse all beings

Visions of war and terminal bliss
Forever lost in dried blood vessels
Hexed be the priests, drank the poisoned well dry
Drags now this lingering sickness
