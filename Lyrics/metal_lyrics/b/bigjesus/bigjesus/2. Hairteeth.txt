I've understood things that i don't believe
like maybe god is in your head and it's just looking at me
thru cold blank eyes that always seem to recede
a broken promise leads to hardship defeating me
I fall asleep at the wheel when it seems
maybe nothing turns to something i don't want to conceive

the only way i know how to feel less than low
is to think long and hard
i know when i've been sold or bought

a stone thrown through every window i've seen
through every thought or inclination my mouth tells me to speak
and every way out that i couldn't see
led to highways paved with gold leading me from me

the only way i know how to feel less than low
is to think long and hard
i know when i've been sold or bought

and maybe your life don't move to slow in your eyes, but the lie is what you
deny
and now i'm thinking that the sky is open wide and the sun is what you hide
behind
