I've wasted precious time on worries, tossing and turning
black flies in the sky are swarming
it's only as bad as it seems
if thats what you're choosing to see

i am clinching my jaw in fear of the law

We're on the edge of a cliff
tense nerves and paranoid
release, relax, breathe, and let go
don't forget the ease of existing

the next chapter of the story goes,
we'll lean tired bodies on crutches of hope
that wounds be mended, our souls ascended

i'm deleting my fear as peace draws near

We're on the edge of a cliff
tense nerves and paranoid
release, relax, breathe, and let go
don't forget the ease of existing
