You wear the fucking mask of a man
And you call yourself a friend
Open your mouth and deceive
The lies don't suit you
There are no friends within this guild of thieves

None will share your loyalty
Your possessions are worthless favors from the heart
A promise and a lie
It's all the same

There are no pacts between lions and their prey
Did you think you were special to me?
Wear the mask of a man
Do you call yourself a friend?

There are no pacts between lions and their prey
Did you think you were so special?

A snake is still a fucking snake

You wear the fucking mask of a man
And you call yourself a friend
Open your mouth and deceive
The lies don't suit you
There are no friends within this guild of thieves

You can choose to betray your true nature
You can go ahead and choose to betray yourself
And wallow in your fucking filth
