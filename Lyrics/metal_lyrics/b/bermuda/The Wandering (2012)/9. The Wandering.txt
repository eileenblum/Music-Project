They told me "Son, you can never go home again, everything that you love will have changed, all you know will be new and foreign."
But in my heart I swore I had the strength, for this many nights I have only dreamed of one thing. A warm bead and a warmer embrace old into them, but the flood overtook me like time never happened. Please give me peace from the endlessness of this dark road.
Give me peace, please give me shelter in this, the coldest of hells, please call me back home.
You have turned your back on me! When I saw I'm leaving, I'm leaving for good! This is for me, not anyone else. Now rip your own heart out so you can know how it felt. I'm gone for good.
Now rip your own heart out so you can see how it felt! Please give me a place to rest my head! I can feel it now, we aren't meant to be known! Forever wandering upon trackless seas.
Please give me peace from the endlessness of this dark road! Where do you go? No place is home. I wander.
