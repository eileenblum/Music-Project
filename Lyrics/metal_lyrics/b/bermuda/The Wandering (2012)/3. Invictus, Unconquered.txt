You should have killed me when you laid me low, you, you should have stayed to my last breath.
Cast down to ashes, bones broken and heart removed I was tramped underfoot and barely breathing.
These scars run deep, questioning fate I stared up at the sky waiting for the darkness to pull me in.
"please take me" I whispered, get up, give me your hand, I will remove you from this four walled hell.
If you would only try, give me your hand, I will pull you from within yourself, bandage your scars and give you back your will. Now scream at the sky, so loud at the stars, now prove to them.
You're still alive(I will pull you from within yourself) You're still alive (I will remove you from this fucking hell)
Now scream out the lies(so to force this poison from your bones) "Please take me" I whispered
Get up give me your hand, now scream at the sky. Now scream at the stars. I scream at the sky.
