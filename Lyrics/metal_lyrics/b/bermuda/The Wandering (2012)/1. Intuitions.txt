I saw the end, I felt the world fall down on me.
This life will be the death of us, was this victory gained out of too great a cost?
We've hurt so many, I've hurt too many, in the name of false friendships and loves that never last.
My chest is empty and black, fighting for feeling, my hands are stained with filth and red with guilt.
My heart is lost in the pursuit of success, help me, help us, I've hurt so many on the name of loves lost, help me, help us, I've hurt so many in the name of loves lost.
