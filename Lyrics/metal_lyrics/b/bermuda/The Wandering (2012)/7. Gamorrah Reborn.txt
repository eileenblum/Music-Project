I'd rather spend a lifetime in hell, before I'd suffer one day of filth in this false paradise. Open your eyes! This is no way to live your life! Open your eyes.
This place has no soul, spill your pockets on worthless chance! This is where dreams die! Somewhere among the sand and snakes, someday they may find a piece of you to.
Give to your children, what happens here, never stays here, but you left part of your soul in that desert.
What happens here, never stays here, you left part of your heart on the table.
This is where your dreams will die! This place is evil, every stone and shining light. This is evil. They sell themselves for nothing. What happened here came home. This curse came back with you.
