The surface seems miles away, the faces on the sea floor smile and welcome me as a brother, faintly through the thunder of the waves, a voice I know.
She came to me, calling, assuring me these waves are not my home. "You are meant for more, this is not your time, turn from this shroud."
"These grey faces anchored to the bottom, spoke lies to mislead you! You don't belong here, you never did, anchors at your feet bare no hold on you!"
"You don't belong here, and you never will, this is not your home! Come to my voice!"
I am alive, I am more than mere motion! Made for more, now closer to whole! I am alive, I am more than just motion, closer to whole.
You were meant for more (You were meant for something more) I will pull your heartbeat away from the storm (pull these anchors from my feet)
You were meant for more (you were meant for something more) I can feel the waves break and I return to shore (Now closer to whole)
The tide was harsh and unforgiving. I capsized as black water engulfed me whole with these anchors at my ankles, I said goodbye to the glimmering light!
"You don't belong here, you never will! This is not your home, come to my voice"
You were meant for more! I will pull your heartbeat away from the storm (Pull these anchors from my feet)
You were meant for more (You are meant for something more) I can feel the waves break, as I return to shore (Now closer to whole)
I am alive, I am more than mere motion. Made for more. Now closer to whole.
I am alive, I am more than just motion. Closer to whole.
