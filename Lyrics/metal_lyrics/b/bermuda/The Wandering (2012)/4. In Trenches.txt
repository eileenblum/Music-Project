Like Judas, A true friend will stab you in the chest.
They want to see your eyes widen with disbelief when the blade pierces your foolish trusting heart.
When you fall to the floor, in what moment did I become the victim, left beaten on enemy soil? Is this the thanks I am given?
When did I become the villain that deserves whatever violent end is afforded me? The knife in my backs inscription still reads "I love you, you're like a brother to me."
I watch you smile sickly standing over me.
"You had this coming, now choke on your last breath! You had this coming."
I knelt and said.
Motherfucker.
(For years I've wanted what you had, that warmth and light I could never reach. I wont have to take it from you, It will gladly leave)
I will gladly leave, you were.
"You're like a brother to me, I'll slowly corrupt and use it against you! I don't have to take it from you. It will gladly leave"
The knife in my backs inscription still reads "I love you, you're like a brother to me." I watch you smile sickly, standing over me.
