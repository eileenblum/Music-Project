A legion of demons surrounds you
Oppressing everything
Crushing the weak with ruthless intent.

Obliterate the scum
Only the strong survive
They rape and pillage but not for pleasure. [x2]

Bodies line the street
Soulless shells gutted like pigs. [x2]

A legion of demons surrounds you.

This time hell comes to you
Torturing your mind
Preying on your insecurity.

This time hell comes to you
Torturing your mind
Fucking you from the inside

Close your eyes baby hold them tight
Feel the spirits engage you
Let out a moan of euphoric pleasure
Baby this is the parade before the pain.

Let the purulence begin
I will not save you
At my feet you beg for love
Ill spit in your fucking face.

This is not romance
This is necromance
Pray for the end its only just begun
1000 days of night for you to suffer in
Apocalyptic terror.

Do you feel like a god now?
Paying for your antagonistic treachery
Look to the sky
Lie helpless as they consume you.

Obliterate the Scum

Walk around with the eyes of the dead
And the mark of the beast of your forehead
Lead your kind into eternity
As you fucking rot here. [x2]

As you rot here..
