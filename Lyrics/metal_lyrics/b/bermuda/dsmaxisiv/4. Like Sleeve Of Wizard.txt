Look what you have created for yourself
How did you become so weak
Selling your soul on that stage
Where is your integrity?

You're nothing but a money hungry cunt
Flash a smile to bring the boys up to you
Do a little dance make them throw it at you
If only you could see what the think of you now.

This kingdom will come crashing down
Don't fight now
You're into deep, sinking further into destruction.

You think this is heaven?
This is Babylon
City of sin, where the wicked prosper.

My looks could kill but you're already dead inside
Mankind condemns you as a cancer of this world.

You won't
Make it alive

You won't make it out alive
The smell of death gets stronger now [x2]

This kingdom will come crashing down
Don't fight now
You're into deep sinking further into destruction.

You think that this is heaven?
This is Babylon..
