[feat. iamnotaperson]I brought this to pass
The blame should rest solely on me
I was too late
Or perhaps I didn't care enough
I'm just a bastard
Pardon the man, punish the damned
I'm just a coward
You put the fear of the devil in me

Cast me out to sea and drown me slow

May the axe that falls first sever my tongue
Before doing what a noose could never get done

I'm just a bastard
Punish the man, punish the damned
Take me instead
You out the fear of the devil in me

What use is there for a beggar, with only bitterness in his reign?
Bastard! Coward!
Consumed by the need for revenge
Balancing equations that never resolve

Cast me out to sea and drown me slow

May the axe that falls first sever my tongue
Before doing what a noose could never get done

Let the poison work slowly so I can feel
Every drop coursing through my veins
May the hangman push me over and endure
That my journey ends ...with a sudden stop
