[feat. Karl Schubach Of Misery Signals]Here I am on what seems to be an endless road
I can't help but to feel that I've walked a thousand miles
A tiresome journey that entails a million more
With a persistent pace yet no end in sight
The destination I yearn seems just out of reach

I've made some mistakes
I've lost some friends
I've disappointed
I've disappointed some many loved ones
Though as discouraged I may be at times
I cannot deny my current position just feels right

For it's just a reminder of your perfect grace
I've learned through my trials
I've learned through my trials
What I strive to accomplish is bigger than myself
And through my error
It makes me realize that on my own

I am an imperfect man
But without them I would never see just how much, how much I really need you

But without them I would never see just how much, how much I really need you
We never realize the people we once were
Until we break the mold and become a person worth fighting for

[2x]
What's in the past has washed away and what matters now is where we go from here

The journey I walk is far from over
And with each waking day I'm ready to continue

[3x]
I just pray that I never lose sight of the things that mean the most

What's in the past has washed away and what matters now is where we go from here
