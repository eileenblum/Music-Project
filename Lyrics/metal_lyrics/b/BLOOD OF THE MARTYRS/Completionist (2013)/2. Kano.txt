I'm sick and tired of this dead end
This lack of inspiration and dying desire
What is it that hinders me from reaching my goals
Countless nights of coming up short are enough to convince anyone
That maybe "this just isn't for me"
With doubt encompassing my every thought
My original intention becomes diluted
Hidden away in the haze of my mind
Silently waiting for that spark of inspiration
To unlock the potential I am sure I have
But with each day that passes and no progress to be made
How can I be very sure of anything
My mind is a battlefield of paralleling thoughts
Each polar opposites and contradicting ideas
A conglomerate mess that builds and builds
Until I stop
How can I be so naive?
It's amazing, is this truly me?
We are given a spirit not of fear but one of power and self-control
We are the the only ones
Who can stop ourselves
From walking the path laid before us
We can be our biggest enemy
Holding ourselves back from our true potential
Despite our fear
Despite our doubt
Despite our surroundings
The potential in all of us
All is greater than we can imagine
You have a purpose beyond your comprehension
The inspiration I lacked was with me all along
And though I lost hope in myself
The hope of our creator had never faltered
For he has great things planned
And if you ever doubt yourself
Just remember you were made in his image
