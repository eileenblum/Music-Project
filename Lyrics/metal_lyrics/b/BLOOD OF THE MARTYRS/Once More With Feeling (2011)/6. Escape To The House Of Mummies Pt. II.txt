I know the troubles on your heart
You bury them far away out of sight, but you could never hide this fact from me
I know you better than anyone else could
Through your restless nights you always ask "what will tomorrow bring?"
I wish I could tell you, but you must have faith for I know the plans I have for you
Plans to prosper and not to harm
Plans to give you a hope and a future
Some things you may question, but in the end it will all work out
So do not let your heart be consumed with worry, but place your heart with your Father
Todays worries are enough for today.
