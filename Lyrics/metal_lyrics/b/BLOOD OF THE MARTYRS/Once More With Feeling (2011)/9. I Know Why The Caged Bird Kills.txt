My God my Father
What have I done

This world is withering and falling from your hands
How can you still call us your children
With all the sinful things we've committed

It's by your grace-we live
Your Love-we're blessed
Your Son- Forgiven

You've blessed us time and time again
Yet we ask for more and refuse to give

"Let every thing that has breath praise our Lord"
Let every thing that has breath praise our God

How can we neglect all you've done for us
You have given us EVERYTHING

It's by your grace we still LIVE
It's by your son that we're FORGIVEN
Its by your love we are BLESSED
How can we neglect all you've done for us?

This world is falling
The enemy is here
My God my Father
I shall not fear

I will take this oath
And stand true
And by your name
I will persevere
Amen.
