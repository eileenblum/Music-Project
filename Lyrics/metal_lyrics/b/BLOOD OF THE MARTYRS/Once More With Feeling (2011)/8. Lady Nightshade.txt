This ends now, the lies, these rules set forth creating a double standard among our family and friends
It's time to break this structure that has tainted so many minds
It's time to relinquish the judgement that turned so many away
What was meant to to be a tranquil society contains much tension and created countless wounds
Mankind has taken something so great and created an unstable disguise full of judgement and rules, standards and schedules
A disguise of religion
Spread the word, this ends now
Love does not come with guidelines
And our generation will be different
To show the world the difference between Gods' love and religion
Love is patient
Love is kind
It does not envy
It does not boast
Is not proud
Is not easily angered or keeps record of wrong
Love is the relationship between you our God
Spread the word
This ends now.
