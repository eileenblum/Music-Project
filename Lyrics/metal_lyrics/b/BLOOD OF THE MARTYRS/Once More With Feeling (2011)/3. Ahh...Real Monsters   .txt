The zombie horde is upon us
We'll all be dead by the morning
In the dark they surround us
Left For Dead

This is our final battle
This is our final stand

Against Satans army
We shall not fail

Within this darkness
We are protected by the light

Satans grasp on this world is is strong
His sin is a disease that plagues us all infecting society

These zombies are nothing but puppets who can be saved by only one
Jesus christ alpha omega beginning and the end

It's time for us soldiers in christ to stand up and fight for this world

The war is waging
The end is near
Choose your side.
