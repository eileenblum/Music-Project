If only I could be everything you need me to be
If only I could do great things within your name
but I am held down by my twisted desires

For I am fighting what seems to be a losing battle
Against one of seven titans who seem invincible
This one has beaten me down again and again

Never have I felt so weak
Never has it been so hard to do the right thing

I know what's right in my heart
but the flesh is weak and never falls through

I am so far from perfect and I cannot achieve this on my own
For these titans were created with intentions to hold us down

For the flesh of man is weak, but your spirit is willing
To renew and sustain us in our time of need
To rise and overcome against all odds

Through you I will crush these sinful desires
Through you I will conquer these titans.
