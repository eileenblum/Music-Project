So Here We Are
Another Tragic Situation
Another Stress Filled Problem
To Violently Drag Us To Rock Bottom

We All Know The Feeling
To Helplessly Watch As Our World Flips Upside Down
"Why God?, If you love us so much why put us through this?"
We Begin To Ask
And When We Don't Get The Answers We Wish To Hear
We Lose Our Faith In This So Called "God"

But Have We Ever Thought Of Taking A Second Look?
When We Hit Rock Bottom Did We Actively Seek His Grace?
Or Shrug Him Off And Curse His Name?
Did We Once Look At The Bigger Picture?
Or Were We Too Self Righteous And Too Self Centered?
Is God Only Good When Things Go As We Plan?
Or Is God's Plan Flawed?

These Struggles Have Made Us
Carefully Crafting Us Into What Our Architect Intended Us To Be
Will We Ever Give The True Love Of God The Chance To Purge Us Of Our Selfish Ways?
And If You Truly Know The Feeling
What Do You Have To Lose?
