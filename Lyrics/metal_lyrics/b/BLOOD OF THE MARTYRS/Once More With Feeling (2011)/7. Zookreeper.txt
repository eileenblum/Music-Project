Lets stop acting like everything's okay
With fake smiles and eager faces we keep the truth buried inside
Away and secluded hoping they will vanish we carry on
Our own lives with a sense of false hope

"I am important" we always mumble, but the fact is we're not
In the midst of 7 billion people it's outlandish to think the world even cares
What's right and what's wrong, what's good and what's bad
The world doesn't care about your Worthless needs or want's, desires
We're all meaningless organisms in the eyes of this world
Meant to carry out a pointless existence and wait to die

But then again, who care's what the world believes?
For I know what's real, for in the eyes of God you are priceless
And by his holy spirit and unconditional love you have a purpose
So what are you waiting for?
Are you ready to prove this world wrong?
