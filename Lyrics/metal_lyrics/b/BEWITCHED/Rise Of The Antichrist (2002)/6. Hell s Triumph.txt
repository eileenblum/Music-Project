[Music by Vargher/Dmon, lyrics by Vargher/Wrathyr]

In the Ritualchamber, invocations are read
The cult poisoned by mystical herbs, incantations are said
Recite the spell inside the burning Pentagram
Cups are held up to the sky, filled with blood of the ram

Bring before us the sacrifice, the one to be slain
Daggers held up to the sky, we take a life in Satan's name
Powers of Hell, Infernal beings of Blasphemy
Bring Damnation to earth, misantrophic sorcery

Hell's Triumph

In the Ritualchamber, in the stench of the dead
A Demon rises through the darkest of mist
Called forth by the Blood we shed
Powers of Hell, Supreme Demonic Birth
In the Name of Lord Lucifer, bring Hell upon earth
