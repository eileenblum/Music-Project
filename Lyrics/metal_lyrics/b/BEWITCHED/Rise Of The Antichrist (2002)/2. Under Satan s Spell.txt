[Music and lyrics by Vargher]

Cursed blood in the chalice of death
The dagger is raised to the sky
A sacrifice of a newborn child
Demons gather as the chosen one shall die

On the altar the blood is spilled
The sacrifice is done
Ritualistic cannibalism
Giving strenght to the Devil's sons

There's a fire burning within me
Scorching my soul
Unholy reign of chaos
It's taking control
Soulsinner, soulslayer
Damn me to Hell
Infernal Majesty
I'm Under Satan's Spell

Candles are lit in the ritual chamber
Incence fill the air
The stench of blood growing stronger and stronger
And demons from Hell appear

An infernal orgy of mayhem
A sadistic feast
Ritualistic cannibalism
In honour of the Beast
