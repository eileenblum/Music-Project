[Music by Vargher, lyrics by Vargher/Wrathyr]

The Masters of Darkness and Death
We've seen through your lie
The Demon steals your last breath
We'll teach you to Die

Trapped in Chambers of Hate
You'll pray for your life
As the Cult seals your fate
With Lucifer's knife

Victim of the Cult

Children of the Devil
With Blades of Steel
Legions of Satan
Who bears the Hellcult seal
Sons of Damnation
With lust for Sin
The Underworlds pride
Infernal Evil Within

The Masters of torture and pain
We've risen to reign
Raped, you lie screaming in vain
We're fucking insane
