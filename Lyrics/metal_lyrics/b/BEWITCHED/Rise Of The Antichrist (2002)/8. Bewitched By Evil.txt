[Music by Vargher, lyrics by Vargher/Wrathyr]

Hellfires burning within my chest
Darkforces now takes control
Bringer of Evil, never to rest
To Satan I've given my soul

Burn in Hell

Forcing myself upon those who are pure
Raping their souls with my hate
Hellbent for torture, I'm Lucifers whore
They scream but it's always too late

Victims left dying and writhing in pain
My secret is still left untold
The ground is all covered with bodies I've slain
The prophecy is soon to unfold
Powers of Hell, I'm under the spell
Possessed by the Demons of Night
Father of Hell, I'm under your spell
The children of christ I will fight

The Devil's Son - Bewitched by Evil
Unholy One - I've risen through the gate
The Only One - Bewitched by Evil
The Devil's Son - To earth I've come to desecrate
