[Music by Vargher, lyrics by Vargher/Wrathyr]

Flaming pyre of Evil, in the darkest of night
In the Valley of Hinnom, the pile of corpses burn bright
Lined up for the Fire, awaiting the Offering
Mothers cry in despair, fathers fall in the summoning

Sacrificed in Flames
Souls without Names

Children thrown in the Fire, hear the high-priests roar
Dark Lord Moloch's desire, this Night they'll please Him once more
In the Valley of Hinnom, where the Fires are burning high
To the Valley of Death, bring all your infants here to Die

Sacrificed in Flames
Souls without Names

BURN! In the Fires of Hinnom they burn
Sacrificed to Him they burn
BURN! In the Fires of Hinnom they burn
Sacrificed to Him they burn
