Hellfire's blazing through the unpure night
Churches left in ashes, consumed by Satan's might
Thunder and lightening, flames reaching for the sky
This is the Age of Evil, men of god shall die

Unholy Fuckin' Evil
Cremation of the Cross

Churches and temples are burned to the ground
Demons dancing in the ashes, round 'n round
God's men are fleeing but get trapped in the spell
Triumph of Evil on earth as in Hell

Unholy Fuckin' Evil
Cremation of the Cross
