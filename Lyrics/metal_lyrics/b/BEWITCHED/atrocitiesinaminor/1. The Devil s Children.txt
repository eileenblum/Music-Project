The wisdom of the dark, it all belongs to me
I am the cursed one, can't you see?
The mighty and the proud, united standing tall
Bound to glory, never to fall

We are the chosen ones, forged in the fires of Hell
We swear allegiance to He who fell
Side by side we march to burn the Holy Land
We are the Soldiers under Satan's Command

STANDING STRONG â STANDING STRONG
The Devil's children are standing strong

The wisdom of the dark, it all belongs to me
I am the cursed one, can't you see?
The mighty and the proud, united standing tall
Bound to glory, never to fall

We are the chosen ones, forged in the fires of Hell
We swear allegiance to He who fell
Side by side we march to burn the Holy Land
We are the Soldiers under Satan's Command

STANDING STRONG â STANDING STRONG
The Devil's children are standing strong
