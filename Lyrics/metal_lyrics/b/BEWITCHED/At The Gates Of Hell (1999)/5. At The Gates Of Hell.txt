[Music and lyrics by Vargher]

I have lived a life in sin
For Him each day
Mirrored His image within
So that I may
Sit beside the throne of Satan,
the day I leave
To be His right hand
Lucifer, I'll never deceive

At the Gates of Hell
Forever bound by Satanï¿½s spell
At the Gates of Hell
Proud we stand, in the Devil's land
At the Gates of Hell
Forever bound by Satanï¿½s spell
At the Gates of Hell

I have felt Hell callning
Since the day I was born
Into the flames Iï¿½ll be falling
To serve the Horned
Indulge in endless sin
Scorning the word
Followers of christ, suffer
Your screams are unheard
