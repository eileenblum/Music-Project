[Music and lyrics by Vargher]

I am the one you fear, the shadow in the night
I move without a sound
I am the Reaper, you better grip your soul tight
Your screams send shivers through the ground 

I am the Fallen, an angel dressed in black
The Tormentor, your death 
I am the the Devil's child, Iï¿½m ready to attack
Close your eyes and enjoy your last breath

There is no way out
Iï¿½m coming for you
There's no escape...
...from your fate

I am the Sinner
The Sinner
Reaper of your innocence
I am the Sinner
The Sinner

Your soul is bleeding, I've raped you from within
You are doomed to burn in Hell
Mortal man cannot resist the fruits of sin
You are doomed to burn in Hell

There is no way out
Iï¿½m coming for you
There's no escape...
...from your fate 

I am the Sinner
The Sinner
Reaper of your innocence
I am the Sinner
The Sinner
