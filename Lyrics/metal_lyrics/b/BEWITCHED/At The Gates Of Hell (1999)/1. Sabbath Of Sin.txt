[Music and lyrics by Vargher]

The moon is full in the dead of night
Witches gathered at the hill
The sound of cloven hooves approach
All are here to do Satanï¿½s will
Spit on the cross
The desecration has begun
This is the night
A sacrifice has to be done

Sabbath of Sin
Chant the number six, six, six
Sabbath of Sin
Crush the crucifix

Candles are lit as the wind blows cold
The chalice is filled with blood
Witches kneel before the sign of Hell
They burn the sacraments of god
Spit on the cross
The desecration has begun
This is the night
A sacrifice has to be done

Sabbath of Sin
Chant the number six, six, six
Sabbath of Sin
Crush the crucifix

Sabbath of Sin, Sabbath of Lust
Children of Hell, in the Devil we trust
Sabbath of Sin, Sabbath of Lust
Blessed by the Beast, in Satan we trust
