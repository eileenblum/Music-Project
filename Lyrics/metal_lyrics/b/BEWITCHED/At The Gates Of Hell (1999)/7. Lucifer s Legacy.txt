[Music and lyrics by Vargher]

The chain is broken and demons rule the land
Spiritual evil under command
When Lucifer fell, from the grace of god
Swore to take revenge and spill some christian blood

Rebellion
Hellion
Chariots of Fire, riding out of Hell
Devastation
Desecration
Lucifer's legions, draining the holy well

The Devil's magic has swept upon mankind
Watch the prophecy unwind
Children of god are crying in despair
Blood is spilled, and Satan's time is here

Praise His name or you shall die
Turn your back on the holy lie
Turn your back on god,
And praise the Devil's name out loud

Rebellion
Hellion
Chariots of Fire, riding out of Hell
Devastation
Desecration
Lucifer's legions, draining the holy well
