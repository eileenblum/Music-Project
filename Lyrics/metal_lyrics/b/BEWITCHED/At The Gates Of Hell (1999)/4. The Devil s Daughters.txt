[Music and lyrics by Vargher]

Demonic beauty, they'll steal your light
Rejecting christ, embracing might
Seducing evil
You'll fall from grace
Rise, Demons Rise
Crush the christian race

The Devil's Seven Daughters
Touching your heart with claws of sin
The Devil's Seven Daughters
The serpent's poison is deep within

Gluttony, Sloth, Pride and Greed
They'll come for you, the Devil's seed
Envy, Wrath and precious Lust
Jehovah's morals turned to dust

The Devil's Seven Daughters
Touching your heart with claws of sin
The Devil's Seven Daughters
The serpent's poison is deep within
The Devil's Seven Daughters
Each of them is a deadly sin
The Devil's Seven Daughters
You can't escape the Seven Deadly Sins
