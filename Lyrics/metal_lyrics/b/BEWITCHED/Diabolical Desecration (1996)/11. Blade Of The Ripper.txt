As daylight fades
The night will steal your lives
Feel the tearing blades
Of the Rippers Seven Knives

Shining - in the Moonlight
The Blade of the Ripper
Shining - in the Eyes of Death
The Blade of the Ripper

Feel the Blade of the Ripper
Fel the Blade of Hell and Death

As darkness fades
Even days will steal your lives
Feel the tearing blades
Of the Rippers calling Knives

Shining - in the Sunlight
The Blade of the Ripper
Shining - in the Face of Life
The Blade of the Rippers knife
