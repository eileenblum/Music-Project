The sky is enlightened by flames
Their souls are filles with pain
Summoning Unholy Names
The night, Evil will reign

Deathspell... Deathspell

Come with Me, the way I'll you show
To the regions deep below
In your soul the seed He will sow
The Master of Darkness, the Lord below

He takes your soul and I'll take your life
I'll cut you wide open with my Sacrificial knife
I'll drink your Blood, I'll cast s Spell
Your soul will forever be in Hell

Deathspell... Deathspell
