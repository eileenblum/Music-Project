I was raised by the Infernal Queen
And the Majesty that sat by Her side
They showed Me things I'd never seen
And I've inherited their Kingdom wide

I am the Demon that controls all pain
I kill for one reason, your blood shall rain
Here in My Castle I torment your soul
To make you suffer, that is My goal

I am Born of Flames
To rule in Hell
Born of Flames
Your soul you'll sell

As your Blood stains the wall
And you might think you are Dead
I will awake you in this Torturehall
And just laugh and piss on your head

I'll make you suffer, I'll make you cry
But soon you will like it, do you know why?
Come on Bitch, you sacred whore
When I've stopped penetrating you'll beg for more

Because I am the Demon that controls all pain
I kill for one reason, your blood shall rain
Here in My Castle I torment your soul
To make you suffer, that is My goal

I am Born of Flames
To rule in Hell
Born of Flames
Your soul you'll sell
I am Born in Hell
