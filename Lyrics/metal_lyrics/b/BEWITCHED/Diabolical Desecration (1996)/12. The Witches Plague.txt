Armageddish nights of War and Damnnation
Fires from Hell cast upon earth
Soak my blessing of Evil salvation
Infernal curse forsee the rebirth

In the abscene of the holy spirit
Bow before the Horned Ones arise
No earth for you to inherit
Peace and lights earthly demise

Ghoulish Macabre Blasphemy
Damned Withing Sorcery
Heaves gate you'll never see
Ancient Burning Flame
Your driven fucking insane
lambs of chirst will die kneeling lame

Kill in Thrill in Blood and Hate
The Spell of Hell and Wicked Fate
