Juse one among the nuns yet
She's possessed by Demonic Forces
Before their journey to paradise
She'll change the heavenly courses

In daylight she's what the chirstians adore
After midnight she's a pure holy whore

Seducing their foolish minds
With intentions evil made
Whispering words from Hell
And angels in thousand slayed
With her poision in your Flesh
The virginity you're betrayed
As she suck your lst Blood
Flames of life she'll put to fade

After she's had her way
Ripped to Death they lay
Never to see the light of day
After she's had her way

Sexual Masochistic fucking Torture
The desires she's living for
Always in Hunt for more
She's the Morbid Holy Whore

...Our way to god...
