We haunt in the Night
With fangs sharp as knifes
Nocturnal eyes, shimmering bright
As We steal away your lives

Slashin' - Bashin' - Your soul We'll rip
Trashin' - Dashin' - Your throat We'll slit

Bloodlust
Bloodthirst

As Midnight strikes
And the Moon is on the rise
We hunt for Blood, thatÂ´s what We like
we'll grin as the mortal man Dies
