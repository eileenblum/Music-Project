[Music and lyrics by Vargher]

Prowling the streets, dressed all in black
As he enters your home, no turning back
A soldier of Satan, determined to win
Slashing your throat with an infernal grin

Honouring the Devil with human lives
Possessed by demons, on evil he thrives
"Swear on Satan, swear you wonÂ´t scream"
The last words you'll hear in the knivesÂ´ gleam

A reign of terror, people living in fear
He's walking in shadows, the stalker is near
Corpses are left battered, stabbed, shot and raped
Noone can escape the Night Stalkers fate

A pentagram in blood is left at the scene
The mark of the Beast, showing where heÂ´s been
A servant of Satan, living for sin
Lucifers child, Hellfires burning within

[DEDICATED TO RICHARD RAMIREZ]
