[Music and lyrics by Vargher]

King of all Evil, rise from the Deep
Infernal Majesty, who made all saints weep
I kneel to the altar, come forth through this Night
Oh prideful Lord Satan, grant me your might

Winds of Damnation - Bringin' Desecration
The storms of our Master - Satanic Disaster

It's the Dawn of the Demons
When days turn to night
The Dawn of the Demons
The decay of all light

The Fire burns, in the darkest night
They've gathered here, to fight the light
Clad in black robes, praising the Lord
To the Sign of Hell, raise thy sword
