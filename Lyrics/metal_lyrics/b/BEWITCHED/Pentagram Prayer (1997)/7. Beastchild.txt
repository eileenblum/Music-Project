[Music and lyrics by Vargher]

Fire-fucked, in league with sin
Spawned by flames, He grows within
Gonna bring this world to it's end
To the depths He'll then descend

Beastchild
Born through Fire
Beastchild
Infernal Desire

Eyes of fire scorching the earth
The ground bleeds flames, a satanic birth
This world is swept in infernal veil
Armageddon's here, darkness prevails
