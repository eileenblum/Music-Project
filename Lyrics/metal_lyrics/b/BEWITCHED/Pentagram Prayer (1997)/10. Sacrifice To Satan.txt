[Music and lyrics by Vargher]

Hear the choir of Demons sing
Angels of god ripped wing to wing
The Coven's gathered, incantations read
The virgin cries, let her blood run red

In the light of the Candles she shall die
In the Name of the Devil she will die

Sacrifice...Sacrifice...Sacrifice
Sacrifice to Satan

The altar is soaked with virgin blood
A sacrifice to our Horn-Crowned god
The dagger is wet with her blood so pure
Her soul is lost, the Devil's whore

In the light of the Candles she lies dead
In the Name of Lucifer she bled

Sacrifice...Sacrifice...Sacrifice
Sacrifice to Satan
