[Music and lyrics by Vargher]

The Flames of Hell shall rise
And burn the angels wing
Look into my Demoneyes
Watch the death they bring

Satan - Raise your Fire in me
From christ, this world will be free

We cast the spell of Blasphemy
To summon spirits out of Hell
We chant satanic sorcery
The bells of Hell will knell

Father - Raise the Flame within my soul
Lucifer, you are my Master

* We're the Devil's legions
The Horde of the Blackest Fate
WeÂ´ll slay the twelve disciples
With our hellish, burning Hate
Lords of the Abyss
Bring us all your Might
Open wide the gates of Hell
And burn this world of light
