[Music and lyrics by Vargher]

Fire-winged legions
In shelter of darkness They ride
Possessed by Evil
In the shadow of death They hide
The Devil's Demons
They ride by their Master's side
Troops from Hell
They'll make you wish your children died

Women of Sin - Fall to your knees
Cursed is your womb - Marked by the Beast

Infant child
Into the Realm of Fire born
Satan's slave
The chains will never be torn
Fertilized seeds
Into the Abyss they fell
The Devil smiled
His claw dragged 'em down to Hell

Women in grief - Damned is your spawn
Cursed is the womb - Scarred by the Horned
