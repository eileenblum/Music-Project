[Music and lyrics by Vargher]

Tonight the circle meets again
Listen now my friend
Your time has come to die
As we cast the spell of death 
You'll suck your last breath
Black-Magic in the sky

Blood on the Altar

As the black candles burn
The christian cross weÂ´ll turn
Invert, upside-down
Hailing the Beast, the darkest flame
We'll recite Thy hellish name
And trash this fuckin' town

Blood on the Altar
