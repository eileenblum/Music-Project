[Music by Vargher/Blackheim, lyrics by Vargher]

We attack with spell
The mighty cult from Hell,
We Attack

Destruction, death and pain
The victims blood shall rain,
As we Attack

Attack...Attack...Attack...
In the Name of the Devil
Attack...Attack...Attack...
Of the Hellcult

The Torment rises strong
In a grave you belong,
As we Attack

United with demons we stand
Under Lord Satan's command,
We Attack
