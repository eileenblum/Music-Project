Triumphant destruction
Bloodshed supreme
Soil the creation
Shatter the dream
His kingdom is plunged into darkness
Prosperous death
The light at the end of the tunnel
Is nothing but the final fire

Bringers of death manifested
Slayers of life
Legions obsessed with destruction
Wielding Lucifer's knife
Torture the world with your merciless roar
That blackens the sky
All that is sacred will die

Malevolent force of destruction
Bring the end of all
Malevolent force of death
Now let the curtain fall

Majestic destroyers
End all life
Reverse the creation
Demolish the lies
Punish the heavens and bring forth the night
Kill the light
Malevolent force manifested
Brings death upon all in their sight

Malevolent force of destruction
Bring the end of all
Malevolent force of death
Now let the curtain fall
