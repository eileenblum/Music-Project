Human scum, that's all you'll ever be
Betrayer, a blood-sworn enemy to me
Blackhearted soldiers, fighting side by side
Nowhere to run you fuckers
From us you never can hide

Lambs of god, we'll bring you to your knees
Feeble souls, worth less than dust on fleas
The blades of death, shining in our hands
As the hellcult rages through the holy lands

Humanity â we bid you farwell
Creation of light â we send you to hell

Die! This is goodbye
Die! By the power of the reaper's scythe
Die! This is goodbye
Die! By the power of the devil's might

Human scum, forever dead and gone
Nazarene, your battle shall bever be won
We're born through fire, eternal hate and sin
The mighty sons of Satan, cold and dead within

Humanity â we bid you farwell
Creation of light â we send you to hell

Die! This is goodbye
Die! By the power of the reaper's scythe
Die! This is goodbye
Die! By the power of the devil's might

Die! This is goodbye
Die! By the power of the devil's might
Die!
Die!
