Death strikes at the four corners of the earth
Unmerciful acts
The grand coming of the final time
Hear the winds of damnation whine

Blessed with disease
Blessed with death

Let darkness come

Come, pollute the seven seas
Bring your poison to the land
Salute us with your pestilence
Turn human bond to sand

Let darkness come

In the name of damnation
In the name of death
Erase this abomination
Scorch this world with your flaming breath

Blessed with disease
Blessed with death

Let darkness come
Our will be done
