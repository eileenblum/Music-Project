All is black and torn within
Lust for life is denied
Inner frustration
Solid steel salvation

There is no turning back now
Release the demons inside
Orgasmic mutilation
Flesh desecration

Shut me down, seat my fate
Give me all that I need
Pain is all I can feel
My skin loves the steel

Can't resist the calling
Can't resist the blade
I can hear it clear now
As it's screaming my name
Surrender to the darkness
Surrender to the beast
In this final hour
Embrace eternal sleep

Shut me down, seat my fate
Give me all that I need
Pain is all I can feel
My skin loves the steel
