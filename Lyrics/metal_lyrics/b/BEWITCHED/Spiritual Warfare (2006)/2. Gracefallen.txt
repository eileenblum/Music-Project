Gracefallen angel
Deceiver of man
Venomous serpent
Arise in me and let your poison take command

Infect me with darkness
Erase what's pure within
Come, cleanse me with fire
Possess my soul
Fulfill my burning desire

The wisdom of yours is now mine
Fire, your power enlightens my mind

Rebelangel, fallen from grace
Great god Lucifer, now take your place
Unchained majesty, great bringer of sin
Oh, shining morningstar, grant me wisdom within

Infect me with darkness
Erase what's pure within
Come, cleanse me with fire
Possess my soul
Fulfill my burning desire

The wisdom of yours is now mine
Fire, your power enlightens my mind
