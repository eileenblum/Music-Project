Contamination
Spiritual conspiracy
Override the sacred plan
In utter blasphemy
Can't resist it
Invasion of the mind
Image crushed
Salvation pulverized

Unhuman, unearthly
Ancient dweller of the deep
Reveal thy hellish might
And make the angels weep
Demonic, deceitful
Crush all that's clean inside
Bless me with eternal sleep
Enter and reap

He, who can't named
He possesses me
He, who can't be tamed
He is in me

Break the balance
Challenge the laws of god
Invert the universe
Poison my mortal blood
Arise inside me
Let my words be the words of thine
I invite thee
Possess this temple of mine

Desecration
Molest my body and soul
Devastation
Break me down and make me whole

Unhuman, unearthly
Ancient dweller of the deep
Reveal thy hellish might
And make the angels weep
Demonic, deceitful
Crush all that's clean inside
Bless me with eternal sleep
Enter and reap

He, who can't named
He possesses me
He, who can't be tamed
He is in me
