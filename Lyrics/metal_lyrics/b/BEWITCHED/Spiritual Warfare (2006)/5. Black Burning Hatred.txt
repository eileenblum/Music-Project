Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!
Insane amounts of hatred boils within my chest
You've crossed the line, now I'll pour your soul to rest
I'll knock you down, I'll watch your blood run red
Your throat I'll slit, you fucking piece of shit

Time heals nothing
Time fuels hate
Hate!

I hate you!

You broke our circle and stabbed us in the back
You can't escape from your hatred burning black
We're the hellcult and we will hunt you down
We will put you in the ground

We're the unforgiving
We preach revenge
We are the devil's leagion
United we stand

Insane amount of hatred boils within our chests
You crossed the line and we put your soul to rest
You broke our circle and stabbed us in the back
No forgiveness, pure hatred burning black

Time heals nothing
Time fuels hate
Hate!

I hate you!
I do!
