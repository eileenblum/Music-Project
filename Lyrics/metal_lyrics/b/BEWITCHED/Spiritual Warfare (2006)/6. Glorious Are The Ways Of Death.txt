There's no joy in life
Perfection only comes with death
The truth is found in shining, sharpened steel
Grant my deepest wish and set me free

There's no joy in life
Pleasure only comes with pain
I spit in the face stinking world
No compromise as I subside
Fueled with cyanide

Touched by the hand of death
A caress that bring the cure
To this disease called life
In ecstasy I breathe no more

There's no joy in life
Satisfaction through demise
Glorious are the ways of death
Truly glorious are the ways of death
