[11.56-12.34 min.]

Flesh to flesh
Soul to soul
Deeply bound
Deaf to all the sound
Slowly she goes
To that place
That allows
Allows her to be free
Love so pure it overwhelms me
I will devour her in our
Sacred blood
I will capture her
Flesh to flesh
Soul to soul
Deeply bound
Darkness in our eyes
Love so pure it almost overwhelms me
