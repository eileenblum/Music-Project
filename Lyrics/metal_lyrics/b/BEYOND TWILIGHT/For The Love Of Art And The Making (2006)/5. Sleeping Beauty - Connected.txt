[5.06-6.34 min.]

Through the morning mist
And through the frozen land
I feel your presence
I march to you
My sleeping beauty
You alone
I cut myself on the moonlight beams
So that you can drink from my chest
You alone
The wind gripping my hair
My teeth are grinding
As we meet in the flash of the lightning
It's like a dream
