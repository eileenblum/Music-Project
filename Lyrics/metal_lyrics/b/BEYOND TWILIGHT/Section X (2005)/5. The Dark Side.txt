I think strange things, which I dare not confess to my own soul
As it I'm playing a part in a story, which is not known to me
I have many bad memories
Be warned

Light of the blazing fires fills the darkened sky

Well, you know just as well as I do that
A bitch must drink 10 times her bodyweight in pain each day
Else her own blood cells will die
So why don't you just feeding your demons
I lick the lies from your lips

From a thousand miles I hear your cry

Lend me your ears
Lend me your body
And I'll take your soul

Once again you have awakened
The Dark Side

Light of the blazing fires fills the darkened sky

I have overtaken your memory
Erased your identity
And rewound your heart
I can hear through your ears
I can see through your eyes
Sorry your whole life is just a dream
And all dreams come to an end

From a thousand miles I hear your cry

Lend me your ears
Lend me your body
And I'll take your soul

Know my wrath
Feel my anger
Taste it as it strikes you to the ground
I slowly open the 6th door and watch
As you turn from bitch to whore

Once again you have awakened

The Dark Side
...of me
