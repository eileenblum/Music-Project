The metal worker, Perillos
Constructed a full size bull of bronze
He proposed his brand new invention
To Phalaris, the tyrant of Akragas

Roast the fuckers to death!
Light the fire!

The condemned was forced
Inside the hollow metal beast
The smoke rose like clouds
From its nostrils
The smell of burning flesh mixed
With incense

Roast the fuckers to death!
Light the fire below... 

The Brazen Bull
The Brazen Bull
The Brazen Bull
The Brazen Bull

The screams of the condemned
Was converted into
The bellows of a furious bull
When the roasting was done
The prisoner's scorched bones
Shone like jewels

According to legend
Even Phalaris died in the bull
When he was overthrown by Telemachus
The ancestor of Theron

Ha!

Roast the fucker to death!
Light the fire below... 

The Brazen Bull
The Brazen Bull
The Brazen Bul
