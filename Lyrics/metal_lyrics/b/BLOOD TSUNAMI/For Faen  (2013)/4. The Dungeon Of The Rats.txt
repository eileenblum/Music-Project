Agonizing death awaits you
Beneath the Tower of London
In the realm of the rats
Enter the foul dungeon

Beaten, bloody, ripped and torn
No mercy for you
Locked in chains, left forlorn
Awaiting your doom

Placed with sadistic intent
Just above the high water mark
With the tide, the rats will come
And surround you in the dark

Hungry little devils
With razor sharp incisors
Tiny rapid gnawing teeth
Cutting through flesh like scissors

In The Dungeon of the Rats
In The Dungeon of the Rats

Death comes slow, bite by bite
Gnawed to death, eaten alive

In The Dungeon of the Rats
In The Dungeon of the Rats
