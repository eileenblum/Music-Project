Inject the venom
Feel the rush
The high is intense
Watch your skin
Turn grey and rot
Grotesque sight
Pungent stench

You reek of putrefaction
Breathing corpse
Rotten organic matter
Decomposed

Flesh devoured
By chemicals
Amputation is next
Your bare bones
Are now exposed
But still you crave
One more fix

You reek of putrefaction
Breathing corpse
Rotten organic matter
Decomposed
Festering wounds
Unable to heal
Embrace toxic death
Krokodil

Lighter fluid, Codeine
Phosphorus, Iodene
Cook it up and you've got
Desomorphine
Now add some...
Fucking eyedrops!?!

Slam the shit
Into your vein
And reach for the sky
As you fall backwards
Into darkness
Time's up kid...
Goodbye!

You reek of putrefaction
Stinking corpse
Rotten organic matter
Decomposed
Entombed in Abscess
Your faith is sealed
Embrace toxic death
Krokodil
