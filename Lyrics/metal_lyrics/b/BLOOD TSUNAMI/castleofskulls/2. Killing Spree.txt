Such an irresistible
Bloody sweet temptation
I've gotta spread death
Across the land
I've got this burning urge to kill
Kill and kill again I will
Death upon you now
I'll drown planet earth in blood of man

My hate is blind
Evil lives in me
Collector of human lives
Heading out for Killing Spree

I will leave a trail of dead
Dismembered bodies
Slaughter, mayhem
Death and bloodbath
All hell unleashed around me
All hell unleashed inside me
Death upon you now
Time has come to feel my vicious wrath

My hate is blind
Evil lives in me
Collector of human lives
Heading out for killing spree

Earth is my altar of sacrifice
I'll kill without remorse
I will stab and slay forever
With brutal force
Death you all deserve
Death is all you're worth
Burn now in the flames of hell
And that goes for all planet earth

My hate is blind
Evil lives in me
Collector of human lives
Heading out for killing spree

Killing spree
