An invincible force of evil
Attack with all of Hell's wrath.
Troops of doom unleashing, instant bloodbath
A ravenous all-consuming death
Will leave no trace of life
Show no mercy, kill 'em all, legions of death arise

Rapid worldwide genocide,
Let the red river flow
Apocalyptic prophecies fulfilled
Bring the dead down below

Burn - embraced by fire
Burn - devoured by flames

An unstoppable force of evil,
Impossible for man to tame
From this day on and for all eternity
Death will reign

Rapid worldwide genocide,
Exhale your final breath
Apocalyptic prophecies fulfilled
Triumph of death

Burn - embraced by fire
Burn - devoured by flames

Burn forever
Burn with me
Burn for all eternity
