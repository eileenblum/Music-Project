I lay awake in the darkness
Haunted by ghosts from my past
Feels like I've been here forever
How long will this burning hell last?

It's like an endless battle
And there's no place to hide
It's like an endless battle
Where victory equals suicide

Suicide
Suicide

I've spent too much time on this planet
Stuck in this hell you call earth
Feels like I've been here forever
Living a life that's been cursed

It's like an endless battle
And there's no place to hide
It's like an endless battle
Where victory equals suicide

Suicide
Suicide

Nothing matters anymore
Nothing but this pain is real
There's only one way out of this
Burning hell I feel
My mind is my worst enemy
I can't find one reason to stay
I will release a river of blood
And drain my life away

It's like an endless battle
And there's no place to hide
It's like an endless battle
Where victory equals suicide

Suicide
Suicide
