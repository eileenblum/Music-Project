INFERNAL FINAL CARNAGE
Darkness will embrace the planet
Blackened the world will become
The sentence of death has been given
The massacre has begun
Arise warriors of darkness
Bring death upon human existence
Like a plague, epidemic, infectious disease
Terminate all resistance

Kill - Kill - Kill - March on and...
Kill - Kill - Kill - March on and...

Slaughter and slay the enemy
Like frightened cattle they run
Crushed by the forces of evil
Kill 'em all, one by one
Bloodthirsty legions of hell
With a massive killing capacity
Strike with tremendous power
Annihilate humanity

Kill - Kill - Kill - March on and...
Kill - Kill - Kill - March on and...

Kill without emotions. Leave the world destroyed
No one will survive. No one left alive. Infernal Final Carnage
Kill without emotions. Leave the world destroyed
No one will survive. No one left alive. Infernal Final Carnage

Evil will devour the planet
Every living thing now dies
Bestial, sadistic, wicked soldiers
Killing with wide open eyes
Endless slaughter of humans
Foul stench of death is in the air
Infernal final ruin of life
Armageddon is here
