Descend into the raging fire,
it's time for you to die
Join the screaming hordes of Hell with an everlasting cry
Behold this feast for demons,
all your fears unleashed
Eternally enslaved in Hell,
forever serve the beast

The King of this Inferno,
the Lord of Death and Pain
Spread his wings of leather
Let fire rise and let blood rain
From a crimson sky It's time to die

There is no tomorrow,
there won't be another dawn
Nothing but darkness will remain
when Satan's work is done

The King of this Inferno,
the Lord of Death and Pain
Spread his wings of leather
Let fire rise and let blood rain
From a crimson sky It's time to die

Immense decay, perpetual destruction,
humanity will fall Voracious death,
total devastation, evil will conquer all
Rapid fulfillment of annihilation,
now there is no return
Submit to the lord of all abomination,
forever you will burn

Suffer in endless pain

The King of this Inferno,
the Lord of Death and Pain
Spread his wings of leather
Let fire rise and let blood rain
