I've been thinking about you,
compulsive morbid thoughts
Your death will be beautiful
I'm blinded by an urgent need to kill- KILL
Shred stab and slay without control

And now your body lay before me
Wounded, bloody, shattered, ripped to shreds

I've been dreaming about you,
murder, blood, sex and death
And now I get to do all of this
I'm blinded by an urgent need to kill - KILL
And violate your every orifice

And now your body lay before me Wounded,
bloody, shattered, ripped to shreds

Torn Apart - Impossible to identify
Torn Apart - Your death makes me feel alive

I've been longing for you,
I want you by my side
In pieces, shattered, lifeless
I'm blinded by an urgent need to kill- KILL
In pieces you will forever rest

And now your body lay before me
Wounded, bloody, shattered, ripped to shreds

Torn Apart - Impossible to identify
Torn Apart - Your death makes me feel alive

Decapitated - more beautiful than ever before
Mutilated - wish I could end your life a thousand times more

And now your body lay before me Wounded, bloody, raped and fucked

Torn Apart - Impossible to identify
Torn Apart - Your death makes me feel alive
