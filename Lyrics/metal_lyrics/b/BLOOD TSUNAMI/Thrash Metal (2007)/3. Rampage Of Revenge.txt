I will fill your life with darkness, pain and chaos.
I will lead you straight into the grave
Enter now a world of despair, grief, and sorrow.
Everything once colorful will now turn grey

Like a drug you can't resist, I'm in charge, I'm in control.
Grinding teeth, clenching fist,
the time has come to let my wrath unfold

I've got vengeance on my mind
Revenge will soon be mine

Obliterate, Annihilate - kill crush, destroy

Everything you care for,
Everyone you love,
Everything you cherish I will destroy
Everything you care for,
everyone you love,
everything will perish, I Will Destroy

I will turn your life into a wide awake nightmare,
throw you into a void of insanity
I will crush all your future hopes, dreams, and wishes.
Happiness will forever be replaced with misery

Like a drug you can't resist, I'm in charge, I'm in control.
Grinding teeth, clenching fist,
the time has come to let my wrath unfold

I've got vengeance on my mind
Revenge will soon be mine

Obliterate, Annihilate - kill crush, destroy

Everything you care for,
Everyone you love,
Everything you cherish I will destroy
Everything you care for,
everyone you love,
everything will perish, I Will Destroy

Your misery is my mission in life
