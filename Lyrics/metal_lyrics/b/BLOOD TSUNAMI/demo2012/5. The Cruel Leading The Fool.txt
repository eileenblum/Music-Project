Swallow the body of your Lord, drink his sacred blood
You're a helpless lamb among wolves, offered to God
Horrendous interpretations, makes sense after 2000 years?
This is the true face of evil, the face of all of your fears

Nailed to a cross, on public display, hangs a skinny hippie
Crowned with thorns and crucified in the holy city
Humiliated, in torment, sliced up under the sun
An extraordinary man indeed, but not God, nor God's son

The holy script, the bloodstained bible, the hell manifest
Bow and obey, worship the lord, this is the final test
Deceived by the greatest lie of all. You're mislead, mentally defeated
You fool! You sheep! Ever had the feeling you've been cheated?
