I feel my fingers tremble
As it grows closer
I wait for a chance to escape
It prowls this tomb waiting for new prey

Once human, hope has all gone
Humanity has withered from behind its sunken eyes

As I wander through this nightmare
No thoughts cloud my mind
Kill or be killed
I must be the predator tonight
