[feat. Mattheau Brewer]These Cowards Awaken
To guard their dominion
Enslaved to the King
A living sacrifice
Raised to see no light
Known to no other face

He edges near with unsteady hands
Struggling to wield his blade
Advancing forth with reckless force
I witness his dismay

Sword and skin, my blade will know his blood tonight
Nearly scythed by his sword flashing forward
Mine finds its way beneath his flesh

He strikes, the worst has come
Fallen to my knees, he looks on in triumph
He did not see my sword go through his back

No longer will the bell toll
The King will surely know
I watch his eyes go blank
His body falls from my blade
