[feat. Connor Arbiter]This hero begs for incision
He wanders aimlessly
His vision is no longer blinded by his majesty
I've taken everything and yet he still persists
Reduced him to nothing but he still fights for this

I see her face, I can feel her in my arms
I've never felt so close yet so far from her before
I've come such a long way
To lose my love before my eyes
To find a reason is to burden the sake of my life

A phantom follows him wherever he may go
The guilt eats him alive and scars start to show
Revenge won't bring him back
Although red is all he sees
One of us will die tonight
On that we can agree

On that we can agree

I see her face, I can feel her in my arms
I've never felt so close yet so far from her before
I've come such a long way
To lose my love before my eyes
But I know my face will be the last thing he sees this time

He looks to the sky in anguish
I can almost taste his hatred
A fire burns where only I can see
And he will spare no blood to get to me

[Guitar Solo: Sutherland]

Our eyes meet, there is no turning back
Not now, nor ever again
We made the choices that brought us here
We will pay in anger and fear
Forced to do this fucking dance of death
We cut away until there's nothing left
And with his last shred of dignity
He falls down and looks up at me

[Guitar Solo: Sutherland]
