Wasting our lives for this
Fighting a war for nothing
Are we all so mindless?
How can we cope with such catastrophe?

I will take the world by this hand
I can show you what it means to live
I will deliver you from blackness
If you look into the rapturous light

Blood is shed and bodies strewn
Across the battlefield
Sons and fathers die in vain
Now I will rise to be their shield

Lay waste to their towering castles
Set fire to these gates
Those who are innocent will escape the storm
And those who have sinned shall pay

With their lives

Fuck their meagre existence
They will be purged

[Guitar Solo: Sutherland]

I will take the world by this hand
I can show you what it means to live
I will deliver you from blackness
If you look into the rapturous light

[Guitar Solo: Gareth Baird]
