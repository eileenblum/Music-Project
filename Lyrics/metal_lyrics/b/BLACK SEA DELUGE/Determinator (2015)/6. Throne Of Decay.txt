He invokes the collision of nations
To abuse the crown with false intention
Those who stand above him
Live beneath his reign of terror

He is not royalty, he rots beneath the sky
he sits upon a throne he earned from spewing lies
He may be King but he will surely die a simple death
And I will be there till he dies with every gasping breath

The king is calling me to play his game of misery
Inside my mind I find that there's a place that he won't see
Show your fucking face, I don't really think you will defy your fate

You won't look me in the eyes when you call my name
I will see you sit upon the throne of decay!

You couldn't run this kingdom
If you felt further than yourself
The might of the world is against you
I'll have your head if it's the last thing I do

You won't look me in the eyes when you call my name
I will see you sit upon the throne of decay

She sits where the king once did, I have seen the worst
My love once here with me, she does not speak a word!

You didn't have to take her from me, you will know my pain
it didn't have to end this way, now you will share the same fate
