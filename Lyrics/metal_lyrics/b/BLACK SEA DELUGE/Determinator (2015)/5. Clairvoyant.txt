I've had enough of begging
For everything that I want
I'm sick of fighting
For what I've already earned
Dragged through the dirt
Silenced and hurt
When will this come to an end?

I shall reclaim what is mine
Just give her back to me, don't waste my time
I will reclaim her she's mine
No mercy for you fools who stand in line

Then I see her pale figure standing there before me
This can't be real
My eyes are bloodshot, my hands are shaking
What am I supposed to feel?

Take my hand or be forgotten, or wait
For the storm to take everything you loved
Come now rest in the chaos or wait
For the storm to take everything you love

You will be forgotten, you will be lost in the storm
The chaos was begotten, now dwell with your demons alone

I shall seek you dead or alive
I swear this will be the last time
Cannot forget you, you're trapped in my mind
I'm done with trying, I'm bringing you home

Take my hand or be forgotten, or wait
For the storm to take everything you loved
Come now rest in the chaos or wait
For the storm to take everything you love

You will be forgotten, you will be lost in the storm
The chaos was begotten, now dwell with your demons alone

She's not real
The flaw in her facade, you coward!
You drained the very spirit from her eyes
She lies
She calls my name with the voice of a wretched King
