Run!
As much as you can
There's nowhere to go
You're losing your mind
It's finally shown
In front of your face
The truth is revealed

Hide!
You can no longer hide
No shelter to go
Smothering lies
You're losing control
Do not close your eyes
You're bending within...

Can you prove otherwise?
When you live in disguise
Every time you pretend
Life is just like a game
Nothing as it may seem
More than daydreams and scenes
This conceiving deceit
Giving birth to this grief

There is no dark place
No even shadow
Where light can't be seen

Every line you dare to step out
Be aware you must be ready
To respond all accusations
Screaming voices won't forsake you

Every sign you take for granted
Never think twice the world is burning
Time to cry out you're surrounded
Screaming voices won't forsake you

Screaming voices won't forsake
You must be ready

Screaming voices won't forsake
If you don't cry out

Screaming voices won't forsake you
Make up your mind

Screaming voices will forsake
When you pray out loud
