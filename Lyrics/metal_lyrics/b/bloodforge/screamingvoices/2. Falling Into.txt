Lost,
In your eyes
In your mind
Lies my way

Though I try,
To stay far
My soul's cry
Is to be with you

Craving for this burning passion
I go, all the wayâ¦.

Crown my heart
Let me be your own
Breathe, I breathe
This life, I breathe you
In your eyes I saw my soul
Falling into
Into me (you)

Lies,
Haunt my life
They still try
Steal my peace

What if I
Hide myself (Hide myself)
Under your
Mighty wings

Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy loving kindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me.
