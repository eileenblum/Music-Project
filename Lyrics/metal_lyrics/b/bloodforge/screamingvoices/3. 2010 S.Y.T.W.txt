[2010 version for the song "Show you the Way"]

Do you love the truth?
So why you lie to yourself,
Immersed in pain and in sorrow?

Everyone you loved
They've gone away
Nowhere to run to
'Cause the walls you're climbing
Are falling down

So, come along with me
You don't have to fear
There's a love that's real
The light that shines from above
Will show you the way

How do you feel inside?
You're spinning 'round
No one can catch you
You lift your head and blameâ¦

â¦every single thought
Like bright lights
They blind your eyes
I hear you screaming...
Insanity will bring you down

So, come along with me (I will show you the way)
You don't have to fear (I will show you the way)
There's a love that's real
The light that shines from above

Set 'em free dear Lord
Rescue and heal every heart
Set 'em free dear Lord
Rescue and heal every heart

So, come along with me (I will show you the way)
You don't have to fear (I will show you the way)
There's a love that's real
The light that shines from above

So, come along with me (I will show you the way)
You don't have to fear (I will show you the way)
There's a love that's real

The light that shines from above
The light that shines from up above
The light that shines from above
Will show you the way!
