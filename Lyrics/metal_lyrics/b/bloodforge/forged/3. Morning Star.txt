The day will come...
I wanna see you morning star
Please show me your love, let me feel joy
You came for us
But I'm very far away
Without you it hurts so hard

The dark inside my soul
(Let there be light)
Drowned in my evil
(No one shall snatch them out of my hand)
The point of no return
(I've not come for the righteous)
Almost reaching, almost done

Butâ¦
All dark was taken down
(Let light shine out of darkness)
Since everything was over
(Into thy hands I commit my spirit)
And raised from the dead
(Resurrection!)
And rescued human souls

Wonder morning star
Shining morning star
Shower down your light
Justice, love and hope

Mighty morning star
Bright morning star
Son of the lord's love
Mighty shedding blood

The day has comeâ¦
And I saw the morning star
That gave me true love
There's no more cryâ¦
