Do you love the truth?
So why, you lie to yourself
Immersed in pain and in sorrow

Everyone you loved
They've gone away
Nowhere to run to
'Cause the walls you're climbing are falling down

So, come along with me
You don't have to fear
There's a love that's real
The light that shines from above
Will show you the way

How do you feel inside?
You're spinning 'round
No one can catch you
You lift you head and blame

Every single thought
Like bright lights
They blind your eyes
I hear you screaming...
Insanity will bring you down

So, come along with me (I will show you the way)
You don't have to fear (I will show you the way)
There's a love that's real
The light that shines from above

Set 'em free dear Lord
Rescue and heal every heart
Set 'em free dear Lord
Rescue and heal every heart
