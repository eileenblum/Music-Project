I'm lost in illusions in my mind, lost in illusions in my...

I open my eyes
And see a deep, deep darkness
Thoughts inside my mind
Feelings in my heart
Doubtâ¦ Is it that worth?
You've dropped your tears on my empty pages
Is today the day?
There's no future, just decisions

My pain, my sorrow
My cry, my silence

I have a doubt
Which is the right way to follow?
Past is a load, a heavy load on my shoulders
I wish all your pain, if I could take all your sorrow
The story was written again!

I'd like to tell ya
The story's end
But it's impossible
'Cause when the future had come
It will be turned into past!

My pain, my sorrow
My cry, my silence

Don't cry, don't die, forgive me
I love you
Don't cry, don't die, forgive me
God loves you
