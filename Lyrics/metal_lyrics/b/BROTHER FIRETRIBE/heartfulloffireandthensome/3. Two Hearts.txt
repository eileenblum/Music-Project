I hear your voice it's in my head
I see your smile
your laughter brings a tear in my eye
I miss you every day when we're apart
you're always in my soul, in my heart.

Without you I can't face another day
I'd slowly go insane Baby.

When two hearts beat as one
all worries seem long gone
The stars above shine
brighter than ever before.

Oh baby can't you see
that you mean the world to me
it's plain to see
that this was meant to be.

When I loose my path,
you show me the way through the darkness to the light of day
I'll catch when you fall,
I'll dry the tears that you cry
I'll stand beside you until the day I die.

Without you I can't face another day
I'd slowly go insane Baby.

When two hearts beat as one
all worries seem long gone
The stars above shine
brighter than ever before.

[2x]
Oh baby can't you see
that you mean the world to me
it's plain to see
that this was meant to be.
