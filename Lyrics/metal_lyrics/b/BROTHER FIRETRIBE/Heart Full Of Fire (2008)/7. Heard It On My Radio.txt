I heard the sound
I heard the sound in the air that night
The same sound gets me through tonight
I heard it on my radio

I remember back in '84
Still hadn't learned the wicked ways of the world
We needed something to fill our hearts
Kids on the run, we had to take the charge

Well, it could've been anything
We could've gone the other way around
But some things were just meant to be
We had the time, yeah we had the place

A mind-blowing revelation
We were ready, standing on the station
Waiting for the ride that lasts forever

[Chorus:]
I heard the sound in the air that night
I heard it on my radio
The same sound gets me through tonight
I heard it on my radio

We didn't want to compromise
We had to make the sound come alive
Bought ourselves our first guitars
Those were the things that made the stars shine in our eyes

Start a revolution
Armed and ready to rock the nation
Hitching for the ride that lasts forever

[Chorus x2]

It's in the air tonight
It makes me feel alright
Tonight I heard if on my radio

[Chorus x2]
