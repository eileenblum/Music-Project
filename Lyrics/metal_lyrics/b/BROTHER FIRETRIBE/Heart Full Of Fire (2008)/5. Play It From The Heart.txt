Looking at the faded photographs
Feels like it's been thousand years
Or more
Those were the innocent days
I recall
Life was much simpler than today

Going through the motions
Connecting to the past
Deep down in this heart of mine
I'm still the same I used to be

[Chorus]:
I should know where I've been
Still stand up for things I'm believing in
No matter if I lose
I'll win
I'll always play it from the heart
I remember the things I've seen
Learn how to fall
How to take a hit
Until the final round's bell rings
I'm gonna play it from the heart

I've seen all the ups and downs
Down the line
Learn from mistakes that I've made
I had my share of hard times
More than once
But good times were too hard to find

Born to live day by day
Is that a curse or a bless
I don't know for sure
But one thing stands
Can't change the way I am

[Chorus]:
I should know where I've been
Still stand up for things I'm believing in
No matter if I lose
I'll win
I'll always play it from the heart
I remember the things I've seen
Learn how to fall
How to take a hit
Until the final round's bell rings
I'm gonna play it from the heart

I know that I've been wrong
I guess that I've been blind
But I think I've been right every now and then too
It's all just a game with rules made by me
And I try my best to play to win

[Chorus]:
I should know where I've been
Still stand up for things I'm believing in
No matter if I lose
I'll win
I'll always play it from the heart
I remember the things I've seen
Learn how to fall
How to take a hit
Until the final round's bell rings
I'm gonna play it from the heart
