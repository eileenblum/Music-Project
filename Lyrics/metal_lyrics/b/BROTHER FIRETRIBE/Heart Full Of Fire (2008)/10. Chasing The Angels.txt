Running where the boys run free
Burning up the sky
Chasing the angels

Another restless night
That's when I hear those voices
Calling me to push the edge
I wanna feel my blood rise
I feel it in my hands
I make the ultimate escape
Searching for the phantom eyes
Under cover of darkness

I'm gonna make something happen
I'm gonna take my chances and ride

[chorus]:
Running where the boys run free
Burning up the sky
Chasing the angels
Be my fantasy tonight
Someone out there waits for me
Got you in my sights
Chasing the angels
Going straight through heaven tonight

I see you in my dreams
We're going up where we belong
Never coming back to Earth
As we go racing for the sun
Beyond space and time
Up where the twilight turns to black
Other than it has to be
We come to get it as one

I think I'm heading for the break point
I gotta make this vision alive

[chorus]:
Running where the boys run free
Burning up the sky
Chasing the angels
Be my fantasy tonight
Someone out there waits for me
Got you in my sights
Chasing the angels
Going straight through heaven tonight

[chorus]:
Running where the boys run free
Burning up the sky
Chasing the angels
Be my fantasy tonight
Someone out there waits for me
Got you in my sights
Chasing the angels
Be my fantasy tonight

[chorus]:
Running with the boys
Run free
Burning up the sky
Chasing the angels
Be my fantasy tonight
Someone out there waits for me
Got you in my sights
Chasing the angels
Going straight through heaven tonight
Going straight through heaven tonight
Going straight through heaven tonight
