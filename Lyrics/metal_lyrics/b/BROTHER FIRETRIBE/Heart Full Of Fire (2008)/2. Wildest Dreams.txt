I want you to know
Been thinkin' about you since the day that we met
You really put on a show
There was something about the look in your eyes
You said that I'm the one
The one to make the best of this night
It was a hit and run
Showed no mercy, just took my head

It's so strange how time flies by
when someone comes and steals your heart
Watching the night turn into day
Wish I could turn the hands of time

[chorus]
Girl, you make me feel so right
Got me running to the other side
You make me wanna wish this night would go on
Like only in my wildest dreams
The way you do me I just can't take
Don't you let my poor heart break
Shake me 'til I'm on my knees
Make me pray like only in
my wildest dreams

And now that we're here
we both know the right thing to do
I'm pulling you near
just to feel every breath that you take

Now it's so strange how time flies by
when someone comes and steals your heart
Watching the night turn into day
Wish I could turn the hands of time

[chorus]
Girl, you make me feel so right
Got me running to the other side
You make me wanna wish this night would go on
Like only in my wildest dreams
The way you do me I just can't take
Don't you let my poor heart break
Shake me 'til I'm on my knees
Make me pray like only in
my wildest dreams

I don't wanna know
how I'll ever survive tomorrow
Now it's all systems go
Give me all that you've got
Just let it flow

[chorus]
Girl, you make me feel so right
Got me running to the other side
You make me wanna wish this night would go on
Like only in my wildest dreams
The way you do me I just can't take
Don't you let my poor heart break
Shake me 'til I'm on my knees
Make me pray like only in
my wildest dreams

Like only in my wildest dreams
