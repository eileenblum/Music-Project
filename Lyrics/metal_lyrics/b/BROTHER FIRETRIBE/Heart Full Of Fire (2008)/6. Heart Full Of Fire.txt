[Feat. Anette Olzon From Nightwish]

I surrender to your love
And though I'm torn apart
Fresh before my eyes
I got a heart full of fire

I called the bluff
Watching you is not enough
Sparks fly in the dead of night tonight
Your call, I'm game
Don't even wanna know your name
Just gimme what I need tonight

I feel your fever rising
This time there ain't no denying
It's just too much for me to take

[Chorus]:
I
I surrender to your love
And though I'm torn apart
Fresh before my eyes
I got a heart full of fire
Right now
It's tearing at my heart
Tearing me apart
How can this be so hard
I got a heart full of fire
Right now

All lies turn green
You'd make it on the silver screen
Play out your deepest hidden fantasy
Go down in my flame
I know you want it just the same
The way you're sexin' me is frightening

We've got this thing together
Something holds my body forever
The time is right so take me now
Take me now

[Chorus]:
I
I surrender to your love
And though I'm torn apart
Fresh before my eyes
I got a heart full of fire
Right now
It's tearing at my heart
Tearing me apart
How can this be so hard
I got a heart full of fire

I'm burning up inside
Prince did come alive
Just lay it on the line
Heart full of fire

[Chorus]:
I
I surrender to your love
And though I'm torn apart
Fresh before my eyes
I got a heart full of fire
Right now
It's tearing at my heart
Tearing me apart
How can this be so hard
I got a heart full of fire

I surrender to your love
And though I'm torn apart
Fresh before my eyes
I got a heart full of fire
It's tearing at my heart
Tearing me apart
How can this be so hard
I got a heart full of fire
