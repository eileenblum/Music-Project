So much been said about falling in love
So many things I've been dreaming of
And when it comes down to you and I
It proves every word'll be true
And when you lay down in my arms
I know there's Heaven on Earth
And I want you to know
I'll fight Hell to hold you no matter what
I'll be standing right by your side

That feeling
It's getting stronger
Every day
Taking me over
It's easy to see
You make me believe
I'm with you 'til the end of time

[chorus]
I can't deny
I'm out of control
I've seen the light that shines from your eyes
It makes me laugh, It makes me cry
I'm out of my head over you
I can't decide
If it's Heaven or Hell
To feel this way
My heart's in flames
I'm telling you, my baby blue
I'm out of my head over you

If it's just a dream
I don't wanna wake up
It doesn't really matter if you're ready or not
You shot an arrow through my heart
It's any way you want it to be

Teasing
Lifting me higher
Pulling me
Close to the fire
It's easy to see
You make me believe
I'm with you 'til the end of time

[chorus]
I can't deny
I'm out of control
I've seen the light that shines from your eyes
It makes me laugh, It makes me cry
I'm out of my head over you
I can't decide
If it's Heaven or Hell
To feel this way
My heart's in flames
I'm telling you, my baby blue
I'm out of my head over you

Out of my head over you

[chorus]
I can't deny
I'm out of control
I've seen the light that shines from your eyes
It makes me laugh, It makes me cry
I'm out of my head over you

No, I can't deny
I'm out of control
I've seen the light that shines from your eyes
It makes me laugh, It makes me cry
I'm out of my head over you

No, I can't decide
If it's Heaven or Hell
To feel this way
My heart's in flames
I'm telling you, my baby blue
I'm out of my head over you
