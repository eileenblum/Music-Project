Shadows
Tensing on the ceiling
I'm hearing
My heart that's beating
This heavy rhythm
That's driving me insane
Message tells me something's wrong

Tonight I can see the signs
Oh, tonight's the night when the angels cry
Telling me
This time it's forever

Running far away from me
I'm staring into the darkness
So tell me
Who will you run to now
Firing
Your lights are gone
You're pushing me to the distance
So tell me
Who will you run to now

Who's the one who stole your fire
Who will you run to now
Who's the one who stole the light

Too late
To turn back the hands of time
It's too late
For me to wonder why
I should've known better
Than to let you slip away
I should've seen it coming
The writings on the wall

Tonight I can see the signs
Yeah, tonight's the night when the angels cry
Telling me
This time it's forever

Running far away from me
I'm staring into the darkness
So tell me
Who will you run to now
Firing
Your lights are gone
You're pushing me to the distance
So tell me
Who will you run to now

Who's the one who stole your fire
Who's the one who stole the light
Who's the one who stole your fire
Who's the one who stole the light

Running far away from me
I'm staring into the darkness
So tell me
Who will you run to now
Firing
Your lights are gone
You're pushing me to the distance
So tell me
Who will you run to now

Who's the one who stole your fire
Who will you run to now
Who's the one who stole the light
