Boots on the breeze
As I drive through the night
Radio's on
Blasting out my favorite song
Rolling down the highway
And I watch the lights go by

So now I'm on my own
And now I'm on the run

I never had a problem
To get used to being alone
I was born with headstrong and
That's why I was on the road

When you walked out on me
A part of me died
Now I'm trying to clear my head
Behind this traffic wheel

It's hard to understand
How can I keep it together

[Chorus]
Finally buried alive
I'm losing this game they call love
I'm always one step behind
I'm losing this game they call love
I'm losing this game they call love

Sun's coming up
I pull outside this roadside bar
Smoke the night's last cigarette
And watch the new sun rise
I think about the days gone by
And try to read between the lines
I never knew what to pull
And now I've paid the price

So hard to understand
How can I keep it together

[Chorus]
Finally buried alive
I'm losing this game they call love
I'm always one step behind
I'm losing this game they call love

And now I find myself
Just wandering aimlessly
It's hard to understand
How losing you can hurt so bad
You made my heart turn into stone
How could I have been so blind
This is how I made my bed
I swear to God
I lie in it

[Chorus]
And I'm finally buried alive
I'm losing this game they call love
I'm always one step behind
I'm losing this game they call love
I'm losing this game they call love
