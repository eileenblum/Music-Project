There's too much confusion
Everything seems out of place
Mental pollution
It's harder and harder these days
It's make it or break it
Won't let it take it's toll on me
I'm not gonna fake it
I'll fight against the powers that be

You don't believe in something
I believe in me
You hide your love and your hatred
I jump the gun, you'll see

[chorus]
I ain't coming back
I ain't gonna crawl
Kicking and screaming
I'm having a ball
You take it or leave it
This is the real thing
Believe it or not
I'm going out with a bang

Fight fire with fire
That's what I'm aiming for
I'm your gun for hire
Call me
I come 'round your door
You think you can't go on
I think I'm pulling this through
You say it's not worth fighting for
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do

Cause a chain reaction
Finally breaking through
Keep my end of the bargain
Be someone not like you

[chorus]
I ain't coming back
I ain't gonna crawl
Kicking and screaming
I'm having a ball
You take it or leave it
This is the real thing
Believe it or not
I'm going out with a bang

You don't believe in something
I believe in me
You hide your love and your hatred
I jump the gun, you'll see

[chorus]
I ain't coming back
I ain't gonna crawl
Kicking and screaming
I'm having a ball
You take it or leave it
This is the real thing
Believe it or not
I'm going out with a bang
