As I look into your eyes
And I see what's on your mind
I know you're afraid
And you don't have to say
I know that you can't stay
It's the price we have to pay
Will we just live from day to day
I don't know how long
This can go on
'Cause we just don't belong

Any fool can see
That we were just meant to be
Now baby
All we have to do is hold on
Holding on

[Chorus]
We're the last of the runaways
Always on the run to another place
They just can't see
They just can't see inside our hearts
Baby, when the world gets in our face
Even if it means to fall from grace
We're gonna take it
One by one
And leave it all behind

I see the tears you cry
I know it makes you wonder why
Why life gets so rough
Why enough ain't enough
You just got to hang tough
Oh, they say you don't understand
Yeah, it's like going against the wind
It's gonna be alright
We'll stand up and fight
And we'll do it with all our might

Baby
Just be strong
'Cause they don't know
Right from wrong
And baby
All we have to do is hold on
Holding on

[Chorus]
We're the last of the runaways
Always on the run to another place
They just can't see
They just can't see inside our hearts
Baby, when the world gets in our face
Even if it means to fall from grace
We're gonna take it
One by one
And leave it all behind

[Chorus]
We're the last of the runaways
Always on the run to another place
They just can't see
They just can't see inside our hearts
Baby, when the world gets in our face
Even if it means to fall from grace
We're gonna take it
One by one
And leave it all behind
