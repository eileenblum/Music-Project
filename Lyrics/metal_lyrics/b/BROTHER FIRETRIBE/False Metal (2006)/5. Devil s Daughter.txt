She's red hot with the looks that kill
A dangerous woman who can break your will
She's a mystery and wonder
And she will hurt you
I was a fool to let her get in my case
I didn't know about her wicked ways
I was caught up just like a magnet
I couldn't help myself

I tried to break away from her spell
That was too much
This one way love affair
Turns heart into stone

[refrain:]
She's a devil's daughter
Stay for one night
You'll stay forever
Witchy women
Cries for no one
Steals your soul and tears your heart out

She played her game I was bound to loose
Blinded by passion I was one of the fools
Who she tangled up in her madness
I couldn't stay away
Firewoman burned a hole in my soul
Left me with nothing, don't know which way to go
I heard my destiny calling
As she was laughing

I tried to break away from her spell
That was too much
This one way love affair
Turns heart into stone

[refrain 2:]
She's a devil's daughter
Stay for one night
You'll stay forever
Witchy women
Cries for no one
Steals your soul

[refrain]

I was just a link in her chain
She messed with my body and brain
I don't know how I...
I don't know how I ever survived

[refrain 2]

[refrain]
