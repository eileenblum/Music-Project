Midnight queen, you're caught in between...

When the lights go down
In the middle of the night
And this city turns to jungle
And neon lights light up the night
That's when her blood begins to boil

Playing the game of touch and go
It's all in the name of rock 'n roll
Hot wired, looking for love
She takes you by surprise
And don't you know she is...

[refrain:]
Midnight queen, she's so obscene
She puts your heart on a string, then she leaves
Midnight queen, you're caught in between
Caught between Heaven and Hell
Midnight queen, she's so obscene
She puts your heart on a string, yes she does
Midnight queen, you're caught between Heaven and Hell

Heaven and Hell, Heaven and Hell...

Now the deuces are wild and stakes are high
Don't let her into your game
She'll eat you alive, no way to survive
She's on fire tonight

Playing the game of touch and go
It's all in the name of rock and roll
Hot wired, looking for love
She takes you by surprise
Surprise...

[refrain]

...Hell, there's no way to survive, she's on fire tonight...

Midnight queen, she's so obscene
She puts your heart on a string and she leaves
Midnight queen, she's so obscene
She puts your heart on a string and she leaves
Midnight queen, you're caught between Heaven and Hell
Midnight queen, she's so obscene
She puts your heart on a string and she leaves
Midnight queen, you're caught between Heaven and Hell
Midnight queen, you're caught in between...
