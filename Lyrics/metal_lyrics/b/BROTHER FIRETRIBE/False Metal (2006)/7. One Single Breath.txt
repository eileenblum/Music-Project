As I stand alone
Another night is over
My body shakes and I feel alive
This is who I am
Firmly on the ground
But I'm reaching for the sky

This is where I thought I had a point of view
Caught up in the moment
I finally made up my mind

[refrain:]
Running against the wind
I'm burning like a fallen star
But there's only one single breath between life and death
Beating the odds I never give up
I'll live for another day
Now there's only one single breath between life and death

Trying to catch my breath
And rush my eyes to see
Shivers down my spine as I fall
I couldn't catch the time
I was left behind
Even betrayed, old and amused

You'll never know that in only one single blow
It all could be over
All over for now

[refrain 3x]
