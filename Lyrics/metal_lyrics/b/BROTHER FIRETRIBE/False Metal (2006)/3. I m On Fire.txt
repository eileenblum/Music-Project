When we said goodnight it was, oh, so right
With only one kiss on your lips
I could swear it was only a dream
'Cause that kiss was too good to be true
You smiled and you turned around when you closed the door
I could hardly move
Your kiss was a spark in the dark
And now baby, I'm on fire

3am and I can't get no sleep
And I know it's you to blame
Been hard seven days since I held you so tight
There's no way to put out the flames
I get up and switch on the light
Get dressed and walk straight out the door
There's no use in staying inside
When my heart is crying for more

Been hoping and dreaming
Seeing and believing
My heart will always be there in your hands
So believe me

[refrain:]
Tonight I'm on fire
Flames getting higher and higher
They burn 'til the morning light
But tonight I'm on fire
It's alright this live wire
Rides me beyond horizon
I'll come back with the first rays of light
But tonight I'm on fire

Walking out to a hot summer night
All I do is think of you babe
Crossing the streets while my soul's on the run
What kind a fool have I become
Morning breaks and I'm still on the street
Sitting down and staring the sun
First rays of light they brought me back down
But I know my heart's not done

Been hoping and dreaming
Seeing and believing
My heart will always be there in your hands
So believe me

[refrain]

All I can do is think about you
You're all I can see and all I can hear
Everything here reminds me of you
You light up my day, light up my night
I'm on fire tonight

[refrain]
