You tell me how you've been hurting
You tell me you've stopped believing
Well let me tell you that I've been hurting - too
But let me tell you I still believe in me and you

And now you say - we're trapped in a one way love affair
And so you say - the only one way is going down

When love goes down in flames
There ain't nothing you can do about it
When love's shot down in flames
When love goes down in flames
There ain't nothing you can do about it
When love's shot down in flames

Well let me tell you
That I've been hurting - too
But let me tell you
I still believe in me and you
It's alright - the way you see it
Think I deserve it,
I had it coming

And now you say - we're trapped in a one way love affair
And so you say - the only one way is going down

When love goes down in flames
There ain't nothing you can do about it
When love's shot down in flames
There ain't nothing
When love goes down in flames
There ain't nothing you can do about it
When love's shot down in flames
There ain't nothing

But just remember, I'm not the only one to blame
It always takes too, after all is said and done

When love goes down in flames
There ain't nothing you can do about it
When love's shot down in flames
There ain't nothing, there ain't nothing...
When love goes down in flames
There ain't nothing you can do about it
When love's shot down in flames
There ain't nothing, there ain't nothing...
