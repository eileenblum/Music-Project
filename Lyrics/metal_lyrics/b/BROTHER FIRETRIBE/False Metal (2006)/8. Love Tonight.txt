Cry tough in the night
I'm high as a kite
Feeling my switchblade on my skin

Checking every thing's right
I'm ready to fight
Ready to rumble through tonight

Taking no prisoners baby
I got my eye on you
Like a storm front rising
I'm burning [3x]

[refrain:]
Full moon is high and wolves are howling
The night is falling
I'm on the prowl the fever's burning
'Cause I'm on my way
Stalking the pray, I've got my calling
You can hear it
See that my aim's on you, ain't no hiding
You'll be my lover tonight

You'll be my lover tonight!

I'm splitting the air
With heavy machine
Bound to explode up in the heat

I'm Copping the feel
With fire and steel
Making the wounds
That never heal

Taking no prisoners baby
I got my eye on you
Like a storm front rising
I'm burning [3x]

[refrain]

Like a storm front rising
I'm burning [3x]
Full moon is high and wolves are howling

[refrain]
