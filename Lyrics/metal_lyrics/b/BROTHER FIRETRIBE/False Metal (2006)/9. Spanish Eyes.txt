Darkness fades away and the first rays hit the floor
Sleep's been out of question, this road goes on and on
It's been month now since the last time I heard you close the door
It was right there in that sound
That said you and me no more

Getting straight down to the point with nothing left to say
I coulda done things differently
But my world got in the way

[refrain:]
All I just wanted was to make it somehow right
Forever in these arms and hold on so tight
So now you're gone and I've given up the fight
But I still swear that I'd die for you
And your Spanish eyes
Baby your Spanish eyes mean the world to me

Wheels just keep on rolling
It's getting better all the time
Thank God I keep on moving
Always another city sign
Strangers buzz around me
Feels like sometimes I've lost the ball
Soldiers of show business march alone after all

But it gives me time now to forget
What I thought was killing me
My world is somewhere too far gone
For your Spanish eyes to see

[refrain]

I'll try to live my life
And try to stay alive
This is how I say goodbye
To your Spanish eyes

I had to say goodbye
For I believe was right
This is how I say goodbye

[refrain]
