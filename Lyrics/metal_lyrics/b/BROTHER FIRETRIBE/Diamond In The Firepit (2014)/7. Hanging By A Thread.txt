So I'm picking up my clothes and I can't see straight
Don't know where I am, not sure I wanna know
History repeats itself,I've seen this before
Classic case of broken hearted,beaten man

Hold on
You see I'm hanging by a thread now
Hold on
Can't stop myself from falling down
I can feel I'm slowly just fading away

You're gone
That's what it's always coming down to
You're gone
My mind just keeps coming back to you
And it drives me insane 'cause I couldn't make you stay

As I step into the light I burst into tears
I'm not like this , glad that you don't see me now
Maybe I could get some sleep and just let it go
But you're not there and I'm too afraid to close my eyes

Now the one in the glass won't leave me alone
It keeps haunting me,it's bad company.
