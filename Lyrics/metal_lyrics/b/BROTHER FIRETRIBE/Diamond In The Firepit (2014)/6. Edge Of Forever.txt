I have walked a million miles
To see the turning of the tides
I have crossed the wild and stormy seven seas
Just to find some peace of mind
To take away this heavy load
Up ahead there's always been
Rolling Thunder, puoring rain

Now I'm turning the page
Calming down from the rage
And boldly stepping over the border

I'm the edge of forever
Going wherever
Balancing on the ledge, I'm ready
God on my right and devil on the left
(And I don't really care)
Edge of forever
Closer than ever
Out of the darkness ,now I'm ready
God on my right and devil on the left
(No I don't really care)

Now I can see inside my heart
It's in many pieces and badly scarred
But it's alive,the beat's still strong
Just couldn't see it for so long.
