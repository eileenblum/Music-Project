It's so hard to keep away, it's not easy
to think about you every day, every night
Like a fool I am, driving by your house again
You'll never know what it's like
You'd never understand

Like in my dreams before, I'll be knocking at your door,
trying to survive the emotional storm
Counting all the days, I can't wait to see you face to face

Crazy, tragic accident, my cross to bear, you're heaven sent
For better or for worse, for better or for worse, I'll be there
You're my magic accident, you took me to the other side
For better or for worse, for better or for worse, I'll be there

I don't know what's right or wrong and frankly I don't care
All I know is I can't take this anymore
In my mind I promised not to cross the line
After all the grief and pain and the mess I made
There's just no other way

Like in my dreams before, I'll be knocking at your door,
trying to survive the emotional storm
Counting all the days, I can't wait to see you face to face

Crazy, tragic accident, my cross to bear, you're heaven sent
For better or for worse, for better or for worse, I'll be there
You're my magic accident, you took me to the other side
For better or for worse, for better or for worse

...I'll be crying for you
Dying for you
How my heart's still yearning for you
You're in my life for better or for worse...

Crazy, tragic accident, my cross to bear, you're heaven sent
For better or for worse, for better or for worse, I'll be there
You're my magic accident, you took me to the other side
For better or for worse, for better or for worse, I'll be there
