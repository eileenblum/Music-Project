I Watch with open eyes
'Till it's time
To take it all the way
Every day
The game is ours to play
Oh tell me why
There are no alibis

Winner takes it all
Loser takes a fall
Fight to the beginning of the end
Winner takes it all
'Til he breaks the fall
In time he'll make it over the top

Hey
You listen when I say
There's a dream
Oh that's comin' true today yeah

Never turn away
When the challenge is alive
The choice is yours to make
In every chance you take

'Cause the winner takes it all
Loser takes a fall
Fight to the beginning of the end
Winner takes it all
'Till he breaks the fall
In time he'll make it over the top

First the mind then the soul
And when the heart
Gets pumped up for the goal
There's no defeat ohh you'd sooner die
It's man to man
As we stand eye to eye

Winner takes it all
Loser takes a fall
Fight to the beginning of the end
Winner takes it all
'Til he breaks the fall
In time he'll make it over the top [x2]
