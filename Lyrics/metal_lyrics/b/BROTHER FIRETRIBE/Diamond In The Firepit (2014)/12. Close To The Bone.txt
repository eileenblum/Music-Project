Sunset, burgundy sky
I know the reason, yeah I sure know why
I'm leaving again, my road never ends,
can't you see what you've done.

I gave all I could give
Became a stranger, someone else's life to live
You demanded a change,
Felt like chained up in a cage,
Can't you see what you've done

I'm a man of the world, got places to go,
I wanna see what it's all about

I can feel the beat it's so close to the bone
Have another shot under midnight sky
I can feel the heat it's so close to the bone, so close to
the bone, so close to the bone

Passed the point of no return
Packed my belongings
And watched the bridges burn
There's no flame without spark
Shades of gray in the dark
Now you see what you've done

There's no need to explain
I'm just speeding away
After all that's been said and done.
