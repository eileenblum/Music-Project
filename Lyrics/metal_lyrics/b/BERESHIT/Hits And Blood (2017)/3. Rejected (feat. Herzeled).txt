Show me your face
Proves to your anger
Punishes this body
Punishes my mind

Your love is a lie
Your anger, mind control
I fall to my knees,
To spit and scream

You live in me mind
Are just a dream
My hell is your life
Dies with my death

Dies, dies with my death!

Show me your face
Show me your anger
Punishes this body
Punishes my mind

Your love is a lie
His anger, mind control
I fall to my knees,
Spit and shout

You live in my mind
You just a dream
My hell is your life
Dies with my death
