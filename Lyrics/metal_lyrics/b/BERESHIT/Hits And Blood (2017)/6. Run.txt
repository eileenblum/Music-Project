Had everything in my hands
Only once
Than I ever thought
And my mediocrity
My dirt
My lies
Ruined everything
And from that morning
My clock ... not run ...
My memories ... blame me .. over and over again
Reminding me it can not be

I force you to kill me
I force you to kill me
And all ... now is nothing
And my mediocrity
My dirt
My lies
Ruined everything
And from that morning
My clock ... not run ...

He screams ... Now what!? Who now!? For what!? Why?!
