Nothing remains
Rotten or withered
Because you took it all
I took away all your
You forgot this world
Nothing remains
Rotten or withered
Because you took it all
You took everything to me
You forgot this world

And I want that shit!?
You are not here
Empty you left me
You left me dead
You left me dead
And I want that shit!?
Everything in my world crumbles
You are not here!
Your, shit not here
Your shit not here

And you broke promises
And you cried in vain
And you ignored my tears
And I cried to death
