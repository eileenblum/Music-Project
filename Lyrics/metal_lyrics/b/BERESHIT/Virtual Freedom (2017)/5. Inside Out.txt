All I desire, your dreams own it
All I want to savor, your skin has
You are my twisted reflection
You're my muse, the destruction

I can not control myself
I will not take it anymore
I'll do it myself
And start right here

Lick it, suck it, beat it, spit it
Lay down
Give me your flesh, your mind, your soul
Give me your flesh, your mind, your soul
Give me your flesh, your mind, your soul
Give me your flesh, why are not you dead yet?
