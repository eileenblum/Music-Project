Hate
Feel contempt
Remembering the unnecessary, again and again
Hate
I want sex
Maul my flaws, my decisions, again and again

Hate
Spit and scream
There are thorns on my back
Breaking me again tonight
Hate
Spit and scream
Maul my flaws, my decisions, again and again

You can hear me scream for you,?
I want you dancing with death
Yells, bitch, scream, bitch screams for me
I want you dancing with death

My cunt feels like heavy as
A star-eye in a universe
In a sky darker than dark
Dance bitch, scream bitch scream for me
