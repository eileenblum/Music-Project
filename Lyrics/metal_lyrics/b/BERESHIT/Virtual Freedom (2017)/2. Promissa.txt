Instincts, dementia
You live in my veins
You devour my mind
You reign my sins
Conflicts, bleeding
Devours on my altar
Swallow, not spit
Chain me to your being

Devours my sins
Clean, my corpse

Devours my sins, seek them in my depth
Clean my corpse, caress my soul
Hurt me, I need it
I do not want your pity
Kiss me, save me
Promise me you will so
