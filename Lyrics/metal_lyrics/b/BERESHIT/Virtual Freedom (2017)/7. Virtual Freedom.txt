Log out. Your reality is not real
Log out. You're living in automatic mode
Wake up. Insert your shit in my fucking god
Wake up. You can disconnect and restart all

Kill your hopes,
Kills your memories
No system to stop you, or kill you
Hacks the god machine and cast it all away
Because we are cyborg after all
