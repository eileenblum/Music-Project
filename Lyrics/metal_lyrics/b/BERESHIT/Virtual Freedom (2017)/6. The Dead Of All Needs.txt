Death
Of your lies
Of their desires
Of their forbidden dreams

Death
Of your kisses
Of your hands
From your body in my

You can hear me?
Can you feel my empty chest?
I want to possess you tonight
Kill my dreams
Kill my fears

Can you see that my life bleeds at your feet?
If you're not here I can not breathe
Heal my reality, this world bleeds
Kill my dreams
Kill my fears
