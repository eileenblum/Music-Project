Far from god's hands
The lights disappear slowly
Tonight, I leave my home
I shut the doors of my past
I'll let God's hands, to reign in my own hell

I wait for you
You'll be queen

Give me light with your torch
Be my guide, you would be my king?
Burn me, with sulfur,
Exorcises my pain
Guide my steps
For your sweet lust

I shut the doors of my past
I'll let God's hands, to reign in my own hell

I
I turn out the lights ......
Wait
Leave my home
For
I turn out the lights ......
You

Leave my home

Give me light with your torch
Be my guide, you would be my king?
Burn me, sulfur,
Exorcises my pain
Guide my steps
For your sweet lust...
