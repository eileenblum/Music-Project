Slit cut left gaping open 
The wounds inflicted are so deep 
The blade once removed must be cleansed of the flesh and blood 
Now staining the steel 
The thrill of the kill and pain I cause knowingly really drives me wild 
I see you face and laugh and like it I want you to writhe 

Trapped in the moment 
Trapped in the instance 
Trapped in what I believe to be reality 
Trapped in the moment 
Trapped in the instance 
Trapped in what I believe to be my life 

Rise running as hard as I can 
Despair now rushes over me 
My legs pound to the ground as I sprint away 
Being chased by the sirens 
The comfort which I have found in this cell really drives me wild 
I like to reminisce about your death the thought makes me smile 

I have lost all control
