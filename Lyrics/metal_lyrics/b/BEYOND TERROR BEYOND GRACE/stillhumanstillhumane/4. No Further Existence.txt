Balance is certain 
The Yin Yang set 
Perfect Symmetry 
Life and Death 

Belief - your life is important 
Belief - you life has a point 
I cannot accept this 
I will not accept this 
I cannot and will not believe what you believe 
Because to me it's pointless 
I make choices and I take responsibility 

If it begins 
It comes to an end 
This world is ruined 
This world is corrupt 
And I despise what I am 
And what we collectively have become 
I fear nothing, eternity is a myth 
It seems so clear to me, but humans refuse 
To accept reality 
After death 
No Further Existence 

More often than not in nature there is this idea of balance 
I can accept this 
To me it's a truth 
This world can be beautiful if you're motivated and have a purpose 
I refuse to live 
By your rules 
I have given my life a meaning 
But to me there is no meaning of life.
