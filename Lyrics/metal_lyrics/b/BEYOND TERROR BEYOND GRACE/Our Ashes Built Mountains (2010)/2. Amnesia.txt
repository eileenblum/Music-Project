Pirouetting through articles, like the sailing leaves of autumn
Cataloguing 'reality's imprint' into a library, to be exiled and forgiven

The vault is quicksand
Entrenching the cradled nightmares
Enshrining the captive dreams

A soft melody aids this dance of loss;
But the notes on this scale are out of tune
