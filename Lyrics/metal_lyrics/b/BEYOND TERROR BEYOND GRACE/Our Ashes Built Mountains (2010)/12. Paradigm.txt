Urban landscapes
Enveloping all in its paths
Strewn across
Ground transformed into a factory of dog eat dog

(Subservience)

Buildings adorned with
The tattered rags
Of success we wear
So proudly

With this level of consumption constantly increasing
It's hard to see how this era will be sustainable
Consume
Sustain
Consume
