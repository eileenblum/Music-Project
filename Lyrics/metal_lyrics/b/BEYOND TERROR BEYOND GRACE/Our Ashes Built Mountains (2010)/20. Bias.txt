Acidic lip-synced propaganda
Ingested through the dry cracked desert of flesh
Constricting our infantile minds

As misinformation cascades through a televised vortex of mass manipulation

A fractured pupil puzzle
Shoved into abstract aggression

Perpetuating a cycle of ignorance
No choice from the context of chaos
