Scorch the tumour from the body
purging connective
Flames ember and smoke
We witness both birth and death harmonising a vaccination

Damned in a cleansed state
Discarded into degradation

Scattered with sludge
It cycles forward
To lead humanity to solace
To lead humanity to doom
