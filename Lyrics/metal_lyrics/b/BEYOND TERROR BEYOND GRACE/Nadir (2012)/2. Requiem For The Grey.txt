Long forlorn grey emperor grieving for creation.
Releasing true remnants of light benign.

Archaic lines hung within this blood red sky.

Long forlorn fey emperor willing for a new life.
Aching for the flesh of its binders.
Sacred wisdom in vacuums of fade and dust.
An apostate ward survives.
Long forlorn grey emperor grieving for creation.
With you there is nothing here.


A consecrated arcane prison.
This spirit will never be free again.
Destined not to be one of this earth.

Splinters of consciousness outlining peripheries.
The will to die I keep my own.

Awaiting mouths are screaming hunger down below.
