Sleep eternal

Arching white light ineffectual
Eyes healed by night's mind

Null has given to us a deliverance
from the endless days of a mind less vague
may they pray for us in our deliverance
and embrace the null
relinquished from the night

Eerie watchers unto the skies
and the keepers of ancient caustic lies
sleeping eternal turning our eyes unto the fading gloom
