Fractured mountains loom.
Monuments within a prophetic tomb.

Drifting forsaken upon the blood of time.
Adding their sorrow to the endless brine.

Behold this baneful spectral fleet.
Forcing vessels into the deep.
Unto the ancient murky depths.
Where conduits to ruin silently weep on.

As they stalk these turbid depths.
A hollow gaze is forming.
Wandering through sunken crypts.
A grand emptiness is dawning.

Wonder will they ever more.
Unfurl their new wings and then come to shore.

Did they with a final song sink into the waves.
Or was there silence from among the graves.
