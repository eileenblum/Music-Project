Night has come for the sun

Grand orb failing
like embers fading in a fathomless river
the blankness of the underworld gathering around the star
presents itself as anathema to the light of the day
what the dawn of day began with dusk and night was done
the majesty of earth and sun

At the horizon the land and the sky
are indistinguished where their endings lie
and after this darkness has conquered the sky
the new mystery is the reason why

Night has come for the sun
