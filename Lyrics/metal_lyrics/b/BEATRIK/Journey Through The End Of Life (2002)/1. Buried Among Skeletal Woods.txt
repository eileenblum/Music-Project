The autumn is arrived
All the forest's trees
Seem as burned skeleton on the night
The rain fall from the moon
Full of desperation
On this time of deep melancholy
I have to wander
To seek my body
That's falled on the heretical's chasm
I am my soul
This sad autumnal wood will be my grave

I'm near the place of death
I feel my body
That suffer its eternal pain
With dismal light of moon
All seems without life
Burned trees embrace my soul
The rain fall here
And wash all blood
But you can hear
My bloody mouth
That screams and crys its tormented pain

What a horrible vision
Must to see my eyes
Looking at my corpse
I understand what I felt
Picking up my body
I want to be buried
Far away from the consecrated earth
The sky's turning black
Nature shows its power
To honour my unholy death
Shouting to the sky
Cursing the god of weak
I fill my soul of hate
My dust will remain here
Among this skeletal wood
Where mourning and sadness reign

[F.G. Smara - Spring / Summer 2002]
