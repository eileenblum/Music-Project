A cryptic nightfall
Has now seized your eyes
In the gloomy grimness
The light of death awaits your soul

See the arch of the deads
That everyone is destined to across
For to reach the riverside
And to see the ferryman

You'll be accompaigned
From the sepulchral silence
And from the tortured screams
That arrive from the deepest hereafter

Ah ah ah,
You thought to be immortal
But you too are arrived
Into the arms of Charon

This is the true fate,
After death you will find
Only pain and suffering,
Only blood and torment

[F.G. Smara - Winter / Summer 2002]
