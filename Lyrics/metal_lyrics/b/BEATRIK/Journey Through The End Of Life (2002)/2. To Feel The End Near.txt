I can feel angels and demons yet
Contending my dying soul
I can feel the cold northern wind yet
Arriving to blow on my dust

Do you know what I feel in this moment?
Nothing other dreams, nothing other hopeness
The black frost has invaded my eyes
Can you understand what I feel?

Smile has left my mouth forever
Replaced to infernal screams full of hate
Death is going to welcome me in its reign
I know now this life of pain is about to end

Yes, make me die now
And throw my corpse among the thorns
When it will be dark and cold
Let the sad snow of winter
To cover my pain forever
And calm my eternal cry

[F.G. Smara - Winter / Spring 2002]
