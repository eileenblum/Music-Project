I'm standing here
Looking at my sword
Which reflects my troubled eyes,
Eyes that have seen more than a man can see.

So many battles I've fought
So many enemies I've killed
The face of every single I can remember
Desperate and full of agony

At dawn another battle awaits me
Will this be the last dawn for me?
I'm the mightiest of warriors
I'm the mightiest of warriors!

But am I only human?
Will I die as those I've killed?
At the end only death will win
At the end only death will win!
...death will win
