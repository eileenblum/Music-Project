When the moon is full
And the sky is dark,
All seems dead
But in the deepest forest
Where no beat of human heart
Ever was heard
Something evil reigns supreme

Only prayers are left for humans
Prayers to a god who won't hear
Because tonight is the night of BeatrÃ¬k

Never step into the forest
Fear the night
The children cries
Tonight the witches will dance
The wolf from hell is on the ride
Tonight he will hunt
Tonight he will kill
Nature darkest forces will prevail

Only prayers are left for humans
Prayers to a god who won't hear
Because tonight is the night of BeatrÃ¬k

Ancient Tales are never wrong
Pagan fears still alive today
Cause when the moon is full
And the sky is dark
The infernal wolf is still-hunting
