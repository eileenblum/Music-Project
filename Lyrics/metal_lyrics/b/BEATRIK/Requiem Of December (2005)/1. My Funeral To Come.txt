Kiss my pale face and leave me for the last time
Nobody will remember me, after your deat
Ah, after your death

They are tolling for me, this sad bells full of agony
I know now it isn't worth to have lived this life
On this tombstone you can see the end of my life
In my death you can see your own death
Nobody will remember you, when your sons will be dead

Remember me when the sky will be violet and clear
Ah, will be violet and clear
