Now maybe her sadness is showered on this place
Like the shroud is spread out on her face white by now

She was so young and beautiful but so blue
But her memory made me smile no more

My tears are soaking all these thorns
That covered everything was once ours
With their sad aura of decay
That will not leave me never

That walls so pale, covered by ivy
That windows so empty, like eyes of a skull
They are like a plague in my flesh
