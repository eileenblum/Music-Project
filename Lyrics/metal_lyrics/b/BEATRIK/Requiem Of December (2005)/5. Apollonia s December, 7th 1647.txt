For many years dead children only were born
Funerals and desperation, fear and hate
An occult evil blinded their minds
And drove them to exterminate themselves

She was cursed by the mankind
Cause her deal with the devil
And the place were she lived, recognize her no more
Apollonia, scapegoat of sick beliefs
They gave you her sentence of torture and death
Among the tears of her sons

The stake of Apollonia shone in that December's night
On the Gallow's Field, her body was dissolved in ash

An occult evil suffocated their minds
And drove them to their own extinction
