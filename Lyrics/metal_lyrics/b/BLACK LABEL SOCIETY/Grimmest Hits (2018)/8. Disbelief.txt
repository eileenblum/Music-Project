From beyond all that I see
Awaits a new reality
Seek you truth forevermore
The past is gone, it is no more

All this time you thought that you belonged
In this world that could do no wrong
As belief begins to sway and faith begins to fade
I watch it all just waste away

Away
Disbelief
Away

Broken mind, lifeless soul
And everything you need to know
All I thought and I believed
The bleeding heart that could not see

All this time you thought that you belonged
In this world that could do no wrong
As belief begins to sway and faith begins to fade
I watch it all just waste away

Away
Disbelief
Away

I took your hand without regret
In time the lies would all be met
The carried stones that shall remind
What you think is real you may not find

All this time you thought that you belonged
In this world that could do no wrong
As belief begins to sway and faith begins to fade
I watch it all just waste away

Away
Disbelief
Away

Disbelief
Away
Disbelief
Away
