Sinking once again
Got no worries, I've found my chosen friends
Drifting from all I've known
Within this solace, now I call my home

Bury your sorrow
I'm feeling fine
No more tomorrow
I've found my peace of mind

To wander without a care
Where nothing's ever judged, for I've had my share
Cut off from all I know
Silence are the seeds I care to sow

Bury your sorrow
I'm feeling fine
No more tomorrow
I found my peace of mind

Aimless and down
With no concern
Shed my own skin
To perish and burn

Bury your sorrow
I'm feeling fine
No more tomorrow
I found my peace of mind
