For I could not think
Within this silence that grows cold
Weighted down within this grief
For I wish I could have sold

No matter how far I had fled
For I could not get away
Nothing left to mend
Nothing left to say

Fly away
Nothing left to say
Fly away
My wings, they may be bent
But I could not stay

Empty words without remorse
Burdened with regret
Salvation had been lost
With no need to be found or met

No matter how far I have fled
For I could not get away
Nothing left to mend
Nothing left to say

Fly away
Nothing left to say
Fly away
My wings, they may be bent
But I could not stay

No matter how far I have fled
For I could not get away
Nothing left to say
For my wings, they may be bent
For I could not stay
