This road without end
So far away
Unfaithful skies
Above a faithless day
This handful of gold
I shall bury alongside my fears
All the sounds I once heard
All I wished to hear

There'll be no long goodbyes
There'll be no more tears to cry

The day that heaven had gone away
The day that heaven had gone away
Gone away

This hole that has been left
Never to be filled
Gather what's left
As time stands still
Pictures may tarnish
For the warmth shall never fade
Beyond all time
To carry and save

There'll be no long goodbyes
There'll be no more tears to cry

The day that heaven had gone away
The day that heaven had gone away
Gone away

There'll be no more long goodbyes
There'll be no more tears to cry

The day that heaven had gone away
The day that heaven had gone away
The day that heaven had gone away
The day that heaven had gone away
Gone away
