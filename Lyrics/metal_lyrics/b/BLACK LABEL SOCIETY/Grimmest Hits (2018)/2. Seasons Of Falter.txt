Within this cold you reside
The gathering snow
To have traveled so far
With nothing to show

So far from the warmth of the sun
So far back where I've begun

I can no longer run
I no longer wish to hide
Seasons of falter
And the tears that shall be cried

The perils that rise
That carries you name
The people gather and mourn
In the cold winter's rain

So far from the warmth of the sun
So far back where I've begun

I can no longer run
I no longer wish to hide
Seasons of falter
And the tears that shall be cried

So far from the warmth of the sun
So far back where I've begun

I can no longer run
I no longer wish to hide
Seasons of falter
And the tears that shall be cried
