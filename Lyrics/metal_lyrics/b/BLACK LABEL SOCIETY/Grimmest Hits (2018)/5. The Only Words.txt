So you say you've got your plans
Well life's got its plans too
Changes that come and go
Come tomorrow one never knows, oh

Mountains may fall
The stars may all disappear
Just to hear you say you're mine
The only words I need to hear

The waters shall crash
The light shall fade
Helpless and overrun
Can't see tomorrow, will it ever come, oh yeah

Mountains may fall
The stars may all disappear
Just to hear you say you're mine
The only words I need to hear

Oh yeah

Mountains may fall
The stars may all disappear
Just to hear you say you're mine
The only words I need to hear

The only words I need to hear
