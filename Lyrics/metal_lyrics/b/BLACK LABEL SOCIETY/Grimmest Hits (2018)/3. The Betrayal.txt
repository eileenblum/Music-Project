Gathered for this mess
Abandon all that you know
You say that you're not blind
Yet you can't see which way the river flows

The engines start to seize
The walls begin to close
The betrayal that you see
Yet you can't see which way the river flows

The end, it has begun
So blind that you can't see
Visions that don't exist
Of despair and misery
As you sink forever further
The quicksand in your mind
As the day turns into mind
You choose what you shall find

As the waters pull you under
With nowhere left to go
You say you see tomorrow
Yet you can't see which way the river flows
