The birds of prey gather and smile
Zero horizons, one's chosen mile

Upon these wings
This flight of greed
Walk with me, your new beginning
Religion and creed
The eternal void
Beyond this door
Illusions of peace
Now and forevermore

Your wounds of loss, I shall heal and mend
Where nothing matters and nothing ends

Upon these wings
This flight of greed
Walk with me, your new beginning
Religion and creed
The eternal void
Beyond this door
Illusions of peace
Now and forevermore

Upon these wings
This flight of greed
Walk with me, your new beginning
Religion and creed
The eternal void
Beyond this door
Illusions of peace
Now and forevermore
