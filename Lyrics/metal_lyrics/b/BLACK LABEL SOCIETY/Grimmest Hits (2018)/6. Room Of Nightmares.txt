Step inside where your
True self awaits
Find your will
And then youâll find your fate
This room of nightmares
So much to see
This room of nightmares
Shall set you free

Set you free
Close your eyes
And you will see

Kill your suffering
And drown your fears
Happiness beyond all thatâs real
This room of nightmares
So much to see
This room of nightmares
Shall set you free
