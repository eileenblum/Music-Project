[Simon &amp; Garfunkel cover]When you're weary, feeling small
When tears are in your eyes
I will dry them all

I'm on your side when times get rough
And friends just can't be found

[Chorus:]
Like a bridge over troubled waters
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled waters
I will lay me down

When you're down and out
You're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you

I'll take your part when darkness comes
And pain is all around

[Chorus]

Sail on, silver girl, sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way

See how they shine if you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind

[Chorus]
