There is a town in North, Ontario
With dream comfort memory spare
And in my mind i still need a place to go
All my changes were there

[Chorus:]
Blue, blue windows behind the stars
Yellow moon on the rise
Big birds flying across the sky
Throwing shadows on our eyes
Leaves us helpless, helpless, helpless
Leaves us helpless, helpless, helpless

Baby, can you hear me now?
The chains are locked and tied
Across the door
Baby, sing with me somehow
Helpless, helpless, helpless
Leaves us helpless, helpless, helpless
Helpless, helpless, helpless
Leaves us helpless, helpless, helpless

[Chorus]

Helpless, helpless, helpless
Leaves us helpless, helpless, helpless

There is a town in North, Ontario
With dream comfort memory spare
And in my mind i still need a place to go
All my changes were there
