Exterminate the laws of all
The sacred past
Begins to fall

[Chorus:]
The undying gods of death
The disease it must be fed
Parade of the dead

The asylum marches on
The madmen kill
What's left is gone

[Chorus]

Revenge and retaliation
The shadow of man's war
Has been cast

The masses and the grave
A fate that can't be saved

[Chorus]
