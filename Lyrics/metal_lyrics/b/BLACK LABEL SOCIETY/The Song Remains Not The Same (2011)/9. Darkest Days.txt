[Featuring John Rich]Divided soul of a troubled man
The final fight
The final need to understand
These tangled roots
Ripped from the ground
Abandonment and worry
Forever to be found

[Chorus]
Rain, Rain, Rain, Rain, Rain
Take this hand of sorrow
Take away my darkest days
Rain, Rain, Rain, Rain, Rain
Take away my darkest days
Return me for i feel they here to say

For just one moment of peace i long to know
I can see the storm clouds calling me back home
The blood of the hurricane where the water is never still
Life is a loaded gun
Love is a bullet that sometimes kills

[Chorus x2]
