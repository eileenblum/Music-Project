Come down on your throne, leave your body alone
Somebody must change
You are the reason I've been waiting here so long
Somebody holds the key

[Chorus:]
But I'm near the end and I just ain't got the time
And I'm wasted and I can't find my way home

Come down on your own, leave your body alone
Somebody must change
You are the reason I've been waiting here so long
Somebody holds the key

[Chorus]
