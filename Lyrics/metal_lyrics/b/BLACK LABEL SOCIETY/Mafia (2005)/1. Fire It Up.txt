Fire It Up
Let the engines roll
It's time to burn it down
Keep bleeding on 'til the day you die
Forever, love it loud,
Hellfire, doom
Watch the hatred spin
Beyond the speed of sound
Fire it up
Let the engines roll
It's time to burn it down

Keep moving on

Face your fear
Accept your war
It is what it is
