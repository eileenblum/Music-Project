Destroy this world and all it is
This rain that falls just kill it dead

Bring your pain and bring all your hate
Lord, I'll kill it all again

Oh yeah, spread your wings now child
Never return hell before heaven
Fore we all get burned

This poison that bleeds our souls
Drown in yourself
Can't you see what's going on
