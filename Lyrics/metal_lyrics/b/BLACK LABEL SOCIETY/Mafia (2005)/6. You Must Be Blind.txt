Take a look for you'll never see
Inside my realm of mass insanity
I feed off fear inside a world that's wrong
Take my hand now
Won't you come along

Pure Psychosis in this madhouse
Which I call my home
Degradation in its purist form
You're not alone

You must be blind

Another trip inside the acid bath
No salvation and the grave is coming fast
Synthetic dreams are my drug of choice
Embrace confusion all is gone and lost
