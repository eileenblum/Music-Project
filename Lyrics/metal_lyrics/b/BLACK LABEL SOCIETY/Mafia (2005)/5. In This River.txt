I've been around this world
Yet I see no end
All shall fade to black again and again
This storm that's broken me
My only friend

[Chorus:]
In this river all shall fade to black
In this river ain't no coming back
In this river all shall fade to black
Ain't no coming back

Withdrawn I step away
Just to find myself
The door is closed again
The only one left
This storm that's broken me
My only friend

[Chorus x2]
[Solo]
[Chorus x2]
