Ashes fly ashes burn
The sun is black ain't no return
Ashes fly ashes burn
Over and over ain't no need to learn

It's all dust on dust
It's all you and me
Out done completely out played
Just shovel some more dirt on the grave

The choices you make and the choices that are
When hell is so close and heavens so far
Ashes fly ashes burn
Over and over ain't no need to learn
