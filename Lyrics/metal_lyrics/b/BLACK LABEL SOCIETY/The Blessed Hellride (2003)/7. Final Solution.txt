Hell's rolling with you
Riding on your back
Harvest of terror
we all shall fade to black
Fields of depression
the wounds that never mend
the final solution
bring it to an end
to an end
to an end

inside this world of pain
your beliefs of suicide
denial and repression
psychopathic pride
iron determination
a will that cannot bend
a final solution
bring it to an end
to an end
to an end

suffering and sorrow
the casualties of war
spirit has broke me
broke forevermore
pure assination
the machine, it rolls again
final solution
bring it to an end
to an end
to an end
