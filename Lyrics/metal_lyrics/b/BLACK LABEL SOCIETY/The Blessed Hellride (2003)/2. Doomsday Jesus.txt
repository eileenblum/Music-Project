kill your past and all you thought you knew 
blacked out, hatred running through &amp; through
horsemen rolls, tomorrow's fading fast
make damn sure, aint nothings gonna last 
ohhh
ohhh
doomsday jesus we need you now
oooh
oooh
doomsday jesus we need you now

Souls that bleed have nowhere left to run
blind the crucifix and shoot the gun
generals speak, we leave a trail of dead
keep on killing 'til theres nothing left

ohhh
ohhh
doomsday jesus we need you now
oooh
oooh
doomsday jesus we need you now
