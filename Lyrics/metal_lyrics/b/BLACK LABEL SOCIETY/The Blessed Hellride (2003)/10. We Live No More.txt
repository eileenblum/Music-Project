you say you don't know what its all about
just look around, youll see there is no doubt
the worms and maggots gather for the feast
an endless slave behind your beliefs

ohhhhhhhh
ohhhhhhhh
choose what you wish to beleive
ohhhhhhhh
ohhhhhhhh
choose what you wish to see
ohhhhhhhh
ohhhhhhhh
the hatred one can't ignore
let the gathering begin
for, we live no more

you can't erase the past, that will not die
life's countless suffering, your countless lies
dead and buried, peace let you turn away
hate on hate was born here to stay

ohhhhhhhh
ohhhhhhhh
choose what you wish to beleive
ohhhhhhhh
ohhhhhhhh
choose what you wish to see
ohhhhhhhh
ohhhhhhhh
the hatred one can't ignore
let the gathering begin

ohhhhhhhh
ohhhhhhhh
choose what you wish to beleive
ohhhhhhhh
ohhhhhhhh
choose what you wish to see
ohhhhhhhh
ohhhhhhhh
the hatred one can't ignore
let the gathering begin
