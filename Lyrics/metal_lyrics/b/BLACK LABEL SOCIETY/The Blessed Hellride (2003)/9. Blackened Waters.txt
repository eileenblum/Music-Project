and here i stand
i find myself alone again
the miles ive walked
loss of hope and loss of friends
yet i keep on running
and i wont look back
the waters rise
you never know just where they're at
the waters turn
yeah, yeah
the hardships we endure
yeah, yeah
you ain't the only son
or forgotten daughter
we have drowned in blackened waters

the sun has set
the endless stream where nothing lasts
forever damned
today, tomorrow, and all the past
yet i keep on running
and i wont look back
the waters rise
you never know just where they're at
the waters turn
yeah, yeah
the hardships we endure
yeah, yeah
you ain't the only son
or forgotten daughter
we have drowned in blackened waters

the waters turn
yeah yeah
the hardships we endure
yeah, yeah
you ain't the only son
or forgotten daughter
we are drowned
