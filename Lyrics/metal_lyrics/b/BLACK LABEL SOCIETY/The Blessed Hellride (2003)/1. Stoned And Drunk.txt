Disillusioned, pure confusion, 
where I'm rolling, never never knowing
Walkin' minefields, all is surreal, 
where I'm rolling, never never knowing 
Walked out of my mind, 
don't wanna find, whatevers left
Poppin' pills and drinkin' booze, 
smokin' everyday
Stoned and drunk completely gone, 
my world is here to stay

Ain't no silence, constant violence, 
where I'm rolling, never never knowing
Demolition, crucifixion, 
where I'm rolling, never never knowing

Walked out of my mind, 
don't wanna find, whatevers left
Stoned and drunk completely gone, 
my world is here to stay
Hide my fears and kill my doubts, 
whatevers in my way
Poppin' pills and drinkin' booze, 
smokin' everyday
Stoned and drunk completely gone, 
my world is here to stay

Walked out of my mind, 
don't wanna find, whatevers left
Stoned and drunk completely gone, 
my world is here to stay
Hide my fears and kill my doubts, 
whatevers in my way
Poppin' pills and drinkin' booze, 
smokin' everyday
Stoned and drunk completely gone, 
my world is here to stay
