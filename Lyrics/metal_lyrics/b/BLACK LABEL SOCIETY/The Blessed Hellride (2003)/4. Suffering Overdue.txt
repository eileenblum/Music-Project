theres something sick inside these walls
your loss of mind has come and called
your dissolution, view of why
you'll find no dignity upon the day you die 
when you die
oh, yeah
in the end,
we find what's true,
suffering overdue

you claimed this oath and then you swore
beyond today, beyond forever more
withdrawn inside these sickened walls
Silence is broken, you can break me no more, yeah

no more,
oh yeah,
in the end,
we find what's true
suffering overdue
oh yeah, alright
in the end

i tried to speak my mind but it fell on deaf ears
these scars i held within for so many years
so many years, so many years

so many years
so many years
so many years
yeah

oh yeah
alright
in the end
we find what's true
suffering overdue
oh yeah
alright
in end we find what's true
suffering overdue
