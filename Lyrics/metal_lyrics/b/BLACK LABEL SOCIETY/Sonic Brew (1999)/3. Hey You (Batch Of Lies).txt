Out of touch 
You're out of time 
Left alone 
Yourself to find 
Bound &amp; chained by your silence 
Things to be known 
If it awakens, 
Just Where..
Where Will It Go Now? 

Hey, Hey You 
What ya gonna do? 
When you open your eyes 
And you realize 
Hey, Hey You 
What ya gonna do? 
When you open your eyes 
And you realize 
That batch of lies was really the truth 

The Paranoia 
The fear they're your friends 
Wish to hear nothing 
While seeing all the same 
Bound &amp; chained by your silence 
Things to be known 
If it awakens, 
Just Where...
Where Will It Go Now?
