2...3...4...I Drank All My Fucken Brew and I Ain't Gots No More....

Feeling so damn tired 
Running on desperate fumes 
For the end is
Always near, now 
Empty handed 
It's always soon 
Psychocise me 
Terrify me 
Jeopardizing all that's mine 
Megolamize me 
Certify me 
On my knees until I cry 

Lord only knows where I've gone 
Lord only knows where I've been

In a world of trouble again 
Worries
Streaming 'round the bend

Treat me like a dog, now 
Knowing I won't turn 
Blind me like a slave, now 
Cast Down 
No concern
