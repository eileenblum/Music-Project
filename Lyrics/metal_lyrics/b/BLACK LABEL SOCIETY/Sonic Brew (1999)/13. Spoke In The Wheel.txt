Lord, I Question Whether I've had my fill 
Lord, I Question whether I can take much more 
you may laugh as I lay here bleeding 
no more afters or befores 

Some day you'll know just how I feel 
you left me there twice before 
Some day you'll know just how it feels 
shattered, cast aside, stripped of your pride 
like you were never nothing special 
made you feel like another spoke in the wheel 

so you say im just another dollar 
so you say I'm just another day yeah 
once my blood was strong but now its jaded and its thin 
unlike you I can still tell right from wrong 

some day you'll know just how it feels 
while you left me there twice before 
some day you'll know just how it feels 
shattered, cast aside, stripped of your pride 
like you were never nothing special 
made you feel like another spoke in the wheel 

some day you'll know just how it feels 
while you left me there twice before 
some day you'll know just how it feels 
shattered, cast aside, stripped of your pride 
like you were never nothing special 
made you feel like another spoke in the wheel
