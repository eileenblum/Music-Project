In this garden full of good 
Lies a garden full of evil 
Awaits strange, bizarre, 
Unusual people 
Here is where 
Tripping and nobody cares 
Here is where 
The setting sun is never feared 
It goes on and on and on 
Oh, it never ends 
It goes on and on and on 
Welcome My Friends...

Beneath The Tree of heaven 
Lies The Horror Of The Clay 
Beneath The Tree of heaven 
Come as you please, do as you may

Crooked minds 
Like a crooked tree 
Never caring where one's branches have been 
or where they're gonna be 
People so seedy 
People so greedy 
But in the end, 
Ain't we all a little needy?
