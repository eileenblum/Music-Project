{Anchor my soul no more Low Down} - [backwards]

You leave me hanging high 
Lost my sense to confide 
Blanks, confused and empty 
Yet overcome with a relieving sigh 
Silence, deafening silence 
Wicked world running through your head 
Tired of second guessing 
What I did or what it was I said
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh!

Anchor My Soul No More
Low Down

On the outside running smooth 
Of a gutless cold machine 
Although, I saw it coming 
This soon, I didn't think I'd see 
Just Come Out And Tell Me 
You ain't gonna break my will 
You're water under the bridge now 
Lying dormant, dead &amp; still 
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh!

Anchor My Soul No More
Low Down

My eyes can no longer be blackened 
My smile can no longer break 
As far as I can throw you 
I wouldn't trust you cuz your so damn fake 
Let's get somethin' straight here 
Get the fuck outta my way 
Forever my stone will be rollin'
No matter what ya do or say 
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh!

Anchor My Soul No More
Low Down
