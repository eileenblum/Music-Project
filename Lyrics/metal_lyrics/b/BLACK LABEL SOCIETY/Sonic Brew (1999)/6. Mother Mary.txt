I feel my wheels have come undone
I've fallen off my tracks
Lord, I need your guiding hand
If I'm to make it back
Oh, make it back, back, back.

All my life
Everything's been after me
All my life
I just refused to see
Take me in from the storm
Come and rescue me
Under the wings of mother Mary

Doing wrong is all you know
In the end do you know where you go?
You can't keep doing what you do
Sooner or later it all comes back to you, you, you, you...

Ohhhhhh

All my life
Everything's been after me
All my life
I just refused to see
Take me in from the storm
Come and rescue me
Under the wings of mother Mary
