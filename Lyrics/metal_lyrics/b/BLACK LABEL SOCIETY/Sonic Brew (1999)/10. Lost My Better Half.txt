Lay To Rest 
Bury The Dead 
Tomorrow seems to turn so fast 
Alone in the boiler meltin' me down 
Ain't the first, won't be the last 
So Many People all at once 
Who I once was has died 
Never feel the ills of breakin' down 
Calloused &amp; petrified 

Slipped inside a hole 
Don't know where it's gonna lead 
Lost in a world all alone &amp; I'm 
Lookin' for me 
I gotta get it back 

Lay waste to a friend 
Killing all the past 
Pray that all is forgotten 
Lost my better half

All That Was 
All so fucked &amp; trashed
Pray that all is forgotten 
Lord I Feel I've Lost My Better Half 

Wondering just how I got here 
Shattered to the core 
Lookin' to go back in time 
Moving forward nevermore 
On the verge of a breakdown 
Run down, bludgeoned, and beat 
All the things that you once held 
Lying dead before your feet
