Come, Take My Hand 
Let Us Walk For A While 
Your burden of pain 
Replaced with a smile 

For The Peddlers Of Death 
Come Calling One More Time 
Bearing promises

So called friends running loose 
Draining you whole 
'Til you're of no use 
Letting go of what you need most 
Early Wish 
Early grave 
Early ghost
