Yeah.......

Alone In The Garden
And All That Would Be
Alone In The Garden
You thought would set you free
Nowhere to draw water
And If You Could It Would Be Damned
Go On Turn Your Back Now
On Everything...

Yeah.......

The Dust Distorts The Sound
Last one Left in This God forsaken Town
Tarnished All Your Memories
Your Smile's A Front At Best
As You Stare Out The Tilted Window
Is It One Big Second Guess?

Yeah.......

I'm So Far Away
I'm So Far Away Now
I'm So Far Away
I'm So Damn Far Away

Yeah.......
