Heaven sent/ Hell beneath/ Gone away
Skies of blue/ Nothing lasts/ Couldn't stay
Oh no you couldn't stay
The morning sun has set
On what is and what has been once again

Where can you run
When there's nowhere to hide
On the outside
Living yet dying inside
Your rivers of joy can't be found anymore

The day my world it fell away
Shades of grey
Unspoken words/ Nothing left to say
The day that my world it fell away
Nothings left but shades of grey

Broken doubt, chosen fear, where your at
On the down, sinking low, no coming back
They'll be no coming back
The morning sun has set
On what is and what has been once again

Where can you run
When there's nowhere to hide
On the outside
Living yet dying inside
Your rivers of joy can't be found anymore

The day my world it fell away
Shades of grey
Unspoken words/ Nothing left to say
The day that my world it fell away
Nothings left but shades of grey

[Solo]

The sun no longer shines
My eyes have gone blind
The sun no longer shines

The day my world it fell away
Shades of grey
Unspoken words/ Nothing left to say
The day that my world it fell away
Nothings left but shades of grey

The day my world it fell away
Shades of grey
Unspoken words/ Nothing left to say
The day that my world it fell away
Nothings left but shades of grey
