[Bonus Track]You say that your visions are guided
Or maybe they've just been mislead
On the Dark Side of the Sun
Living just to bury the dead

On the Dark Side of the Sun
On the Dark Side of the Sun

Belief in your words
That you're chosen
The giver and taker are one
The past shall rise from its ashes
On the Dark Side of the Sun

On the Dark Side of the Sun
On the Dark Side of the Sun

A sea of cries as the mass begins
The gathering has begun
Absolution won't be found
On the Dark Side of the Sun

[Solo]

The manifestation of hatred
Deception upon the blind
On the Dark Side of the Sun
Graves of the innocent
You shall find

On the Dark Side of the Sun
On the Dark Side of the Sun

On the Dark Side of the Sun
On the Dark Side of the Sun
