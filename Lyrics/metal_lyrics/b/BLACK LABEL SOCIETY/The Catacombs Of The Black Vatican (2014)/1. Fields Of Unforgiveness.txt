lakes of fire
filled with regrets
Took your chances
your losses won't let you forget

[Chorus:]
so you think that it's over?
so you think that it's done?
the fields of unforgiveness never die
they've just begun

You thought you'd elude life's sorrow
emptiness and grief
the oceans of life's contempt
drown the liars and the thieves

[Chorus:]
so you think that it's over?
so you think that it's done?
the fields of unforgiveness never die
they've just begun

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
so you think that it's over?
so you think that it's done?
the fields of unforgiveness never die
they've just begun
