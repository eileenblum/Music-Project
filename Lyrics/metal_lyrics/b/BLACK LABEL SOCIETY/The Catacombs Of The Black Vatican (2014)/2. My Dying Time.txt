Chosen fate
I have become
Broken slave and overrun.

In my dying time
My wounds shall all be healed

Servant to one's suffering
The poisoned crown
A fallen king

In my dying time
You're all that is real
In my dying time
My wounds shall all be healed

[Solo]

In my dying time
You're all that is real
In my dying time
My wounds shall all be healed
