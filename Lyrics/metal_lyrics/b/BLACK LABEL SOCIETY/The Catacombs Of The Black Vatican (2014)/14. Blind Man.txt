[North America/Digital Bonus Track]Black sand so quick beneath my feet
Time heals my wounds, leave what was to be
Can't get back what was taken
Broken fates are forsaken
I shall not grieve your memory
Blind man 'fore I was to be
As you wither and you fade 'fore I can see
Gather my blood and this won't be the lamb
Cemetery of mistrust is where you've been kept
Can't get back what was taken
Broken fates are forsaken
I shall not grieve your memory
Blind man 'fore I was to be
As you wither and you fade 'fore I can see

I shall not grieve your memory
Blind man 'fore I was to be
As you wither and you fade
As you wither and you fade 'fore I can see
