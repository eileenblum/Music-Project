The angels of hatred
The engine that
Scream through the sky
As visions of crosses and graves
Fuel lifeless eyes

[Chorus:]
Desolation of hope and the death
Of one's prayers
The tarnished cage of goodwill
Is beyond repair

Heart of darkness
Remorse has fallen away
Not of this world
For God is not here today

The coldness that sets in the air
As the ice fills the veins
Disorder and chaos overthrowing
The house of the sane

[Chorus:]
Desolation of hope and the death
Of one's prayers
The tarnished cage of goodwill
Is beyond repair

Heart of darkness
Remorse has fallen away
Not of this world
For God is not here today

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
Desolation of hope and the death
Of one's prayers
The tarnished cage of goodwill
Is beyond repair

Heart of darkness
Remorse has fallen away
Not of this world
For God is not here today
