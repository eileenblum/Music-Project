I woke alone today
For all the birds have flown
Inside this empty house
Which no longer feels like home

[Chorus:]
No angel of mercy
Is gonna hear my call (lord no)
No angel of mercy
To dry the tears that shall not fall

I woke alone today
Admits life's killing fields of war
Door of memories
Closed forevermore

[Chorus:]
No angel of mercy
Is gonna hear my call (lord no)
No angel of mercy
To dry the tears that shall not fall

[Solo ]

[Chorus:]
No angel of mercy
Is gonna hear my call (lord no)
No angel of mercy
To dry the tears that shall not fall
