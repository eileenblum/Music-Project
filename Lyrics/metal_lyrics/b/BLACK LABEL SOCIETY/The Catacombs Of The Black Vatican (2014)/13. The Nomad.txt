[Deluxe Bonus Track]I've left the past behind
So much more to see
Like a feather to the wind
Wherever it may lead
Wherever it may lead
Where I'll never know
For I can't be tied down
I can here it call

[Chorus:]
Take me through this world
Take me through this storm
No matter where I may be
My befallen past it walks with me

The leaves shall turn and then they fall
Like the anguish and the joy
Adrift upon life's sea
Wherever it may lead
Wherever it may lead
Where I'll never know
For I can't be tied down
I can here it call

[Chorus:]
Take me through this world
Take me through this storm
No matter where I may be
My befallen past it walks with me

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
Take me through this world
Take me through this storm
No matter where I may be
My befallen past it walks with me
My befallen past it walks with me

Like a feather to the wind
