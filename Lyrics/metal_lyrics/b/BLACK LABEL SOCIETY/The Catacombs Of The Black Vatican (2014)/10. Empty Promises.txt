Future's uncertain
So far from home
Hopes of tomorrow
Gathered and flown

[Chorus:]
I gave you my word
Swore with my blood
You gave me empty promises
With nothing in return
Worthless words
The funeral pyre burns
You gave me empty promises
With nothing in return

Fear has subsided
Calloused and numb
Death of compassion
There is no return

[Chorus:]
I gave you my word
Swore with my blood
You gave me empty promises
With nothing in return
Worthless words
The funeral pyre burns
You gave me empty promises
With nothing in return

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
I gave you my word
Swore with my blood
You gave me empty promises
With nothing in return
Worthless words
The funeral pyre burns
You gave me empty promises
With nothing in return
