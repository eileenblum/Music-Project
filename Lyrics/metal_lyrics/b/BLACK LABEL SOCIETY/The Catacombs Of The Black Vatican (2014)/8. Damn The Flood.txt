This flood of snakes
The breeding lies
Existence of unjust
Spewing falsehoods as they crawl
Assassins of one's trust

[Chorus:]
First you slither
Then you crawl
Damn the flood
I've come to end it all

Poisoned blood manipulates
The bending of one's will
Assassins of your sacred words
For trust it shall be killed

[Chorus:]
First you slither
Then you crawl
Damn the flood
I've come to end it all

First you slither
Then you crawl
I've come to damn the flood
And end it all

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
First you slither
Then you crawl
Damn the flood
I've come to end it all

First you slither
Then you crawl
I've come to damn the flood
And end it all
