Travel the waste
Seeking the unknown
Come with me
The truth it shall be shown

[Chorus:]
Forget all you know and all that you learned
Bridges of doubt shall all be burned
Who you are it shall be found
Through the darkened light
Beyond the down

Temple of black
Guilt shall not be mourned
Trampled beneath
The sickened mind that has been sworn

[Chorus:]
Forget all you know and all that you learned
Bridges of doubt shall all be burned
Who you are it shall be found
Through the darkened light
Beyond the down

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
Forget all you know and all that you learned
Bridges of doubt shall all be burned
Who you are it shall be found
Through the darkened light
Beyond the down
