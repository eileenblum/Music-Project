[Japanese Bonus Track]Alone in Silence
You held your doubts
That this ride had reached its end
The fear of what tomorrowÂ´d bring
And all that had been

For you, IÂ´d walk through Hell and Fire
Now and Forever more
For you, IÂ´d walk through Hell and Fire
The door is open
But the ride ainÂ´t free
Hell and Fire forevermore

As a shadow cast upon your hopes
And you faith it starts to fade
Looking back on where it all began
CanÂ´t go back to yesterday

Where have we gone?
Where do we go?
You say youÂ´ve had enough
You say that youÂ´re done
For the verse may end a new
Chapter has begun
