Say your peace
For I'll be on my way
One last look, nothing left to say

[Chorus:]
As I turn my back, to walk away
I shall forgive
But I won't forget that day

For every sky that shines
Shall meet the pouring rain
For my will shall never break
Though it may bend
Like the scars that heal
Yet never mend

When lies become the truth
Well, you've got your beliefs
No burdens on your mind
They're buried beneath your feet

[Chorus:]
As I turn my back, to walk away
I shall forgive
But I won't forget that day

For every sky that shines
Shall meet the pouring rain
For my will shall never break
Though it may bend
Like the scars that heal
Yet never mend

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
As I turn my back, to walk away
I shall forgive
But I won't forget that day

For every sky that shines
Shall meet the pouring rain
For my will shall never break
Though it may bend
Like the scars that heal
Yet never mend

For every sky that shines
Shall meet the pouring rain
For my will shall never break
Though it may bend
Like the scars that heal
Yet never mend
