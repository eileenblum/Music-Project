Lightning from above
Followed by hail
Death from above
In the wake of his trail
A vision sent this child
Becomes a man
Blood of the past has chose
His plan

I am
Crazy Horse
I am

The sacrifice of others walk within
The battlefields of death embracing him
The courage from beyond surrounds
One's soul
Walking side by side though
Graves unknown

A vision sent for the heavens
To see
This is a good day to die
Now follow me
