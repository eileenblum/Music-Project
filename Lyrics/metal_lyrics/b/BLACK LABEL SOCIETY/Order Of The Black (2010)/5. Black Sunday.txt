Destroyer of my visions
Come and enter me
Preside over my vengeance
Redemption set me free

God in my hands staring down on fate
No use of mercy with a fistful of hate
The light that once shined has no long given way
Embracing my end becoming black sunday

Fill me with your strength now
Limitless unknown
Destroyer of my visions
Return me to my home

God in my hands staring down on fate
No use of mercy with a fistful of hate
The light that once shined has no long given way
Embracing my end becoming black sunday

No need for remorse
No need to forgive
For all that remains
A day that shall forever live

God in my hands staring down on fate
No use of mercy with a fistful of hate
The light that once shined has no long given way
Embracing my end becoming black sunday
