As the sun sinks
Life closes tired eyes
As hello turns its back and
It greets goodbye

Never wanted to believe
Or have to understand
Time waits for no one
Child, woman or a man

The burdens that gather
The crosses that bare
What's given and taken life the
Ocean to the sand

No final curtain calls
No more storms that rearrange
To hold you in my arms and to
know that nothings ever gonna change
To bend the hands of time
So here we stand and through it all
I love you now and beyond forever
Never wanna believe or have to understand
Time waits for no one
Child, woman or a man
