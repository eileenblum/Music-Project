Exterminate the laws of all
The sacred past
Begins to fall
The undying gods of death
The disease it must be fed

Parade of the dead

The asylum marches on
The madmen kill
What's let is gone

Revenge and retaliation
The shadow of man's war
Has been cast

The masses and the grave
A fate that can't be saved
