The freaks in the streets
The nuns with shotguns
The graves rolling by your side
Survival of the fittest
And there ain't no pity
No one gets out alive
In the Concrete Jungle
It's the well of the damned
Step onside and you'll understand
Misfits, psychos and the twisted slaves
The house of the same
No one can be saved

Rolling six feet under
Rolling six feet under
Roll and keep on rolling

No one gets out
They're ready to die once again
No one gets out
They're ready to die

Another day to bleed
Another day to die
Another day to blackout and then go blind
Maniacal blitzkrieged
Where the maggots play God
Where the souls of the lost come to die
The Concrete Jungle
It's the well of the damned
Step inside and you'll understand
Misfits, psychos and the twisted slaves
The house of the same
No one can be saved

Rolling six feet under
Rolling six feet under
Roll and keep on rolling

No one gets out
They're ready to die once again
No one gets out
They're ready to die
