Take me down this road
I've been down here once before
Take me down this road
Once again, never again, forever more
Take me down this road
Once more

Take this love
Take this life
Take this blood
It'll never die

Take this love
Take this life
Take this blood
It'll never die

This ain't the last goodbye

Take me down this road
Just to see the smile on your face
Take me down this road
All that is and that was can't be replaced
Take me down this road
Once more

Take this love
Take this life
Take this blood
It'll never die

Take this love
Take this life
Take this blood
It'll never die

This ain't the last goodbye
