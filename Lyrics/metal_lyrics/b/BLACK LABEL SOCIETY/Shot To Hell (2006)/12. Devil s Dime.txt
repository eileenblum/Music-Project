Fly so high
Never, ain't never gonna die

Hellbent, blitzkrieged
Take what you want at will
Hellbent, blitzkrieged
Can't live unless you kill

When you're living
On the Devil's Dime
Devil's Dime
Everything's paid and we're feeling fine
On the Devil's Dime
Devil's Dime
The Wheels are rolling and we're running blind

No stop signs
Ain't no slowing down
Broken, confusion all around

Hellbent, blitzkrieged
Take what you want at will
Hellbent, blitzkrieged
Can't live unless you kill

When you're living
On the Devil's Dime
Devil's Dime
Everything Paid and we're feeling fine
On the Devil's Dime
Devil's Dime
The wheels are rolling and we're running blind
