Hell is high
So am I
A junkie's rush, flying across the sky
A million miles an hour
No, it ain't enough
Machine gun mind and a junkie's rush

Life is good
Life is fine
Pull the trigger one more time

Hell is high
And you all know
When the pedal hits the floor it's time to roll
A million miles an hour
No, it ain't enough
Machine gun mind and a junkie's rush

Life is good
Life is fine
Pull the trigger one more time

Hell is high
And so are you
Take a look in the mirror
Yeah, you know its true
A million miles an hour
No, it ain't enough
Machine gunmind and a junkie's rush

Life is good
Life is fine
Pull the trigger one more time
