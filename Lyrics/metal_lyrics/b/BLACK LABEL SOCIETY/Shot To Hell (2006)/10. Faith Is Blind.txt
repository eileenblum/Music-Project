Faith is blind
Carry it to the end
Faith is blind
All I've done and said

Feed them the lies
For that's all that they want to see
Crawl in your grave
I'm your Lord of Reality

Faith is blind
Follow me to the black
Faith is blind
Your demise is where your at

Feed them lies
For that's all that they want to see
Crawl in your grave
I'm your Lord of Reality

Faith is blind
Carry it to the end
Faith is blind
All I've done and said
