Give yourself to me
For only then you will see
For I am the skies up above
Beneath and everything in between
These oceans which harbor your sadness
These rivers which carry your pain
Give yourself to me
For only then you will see
You will see

Give yourself to me

I was here before the beginning
I'll be here after the end
Search yourself, you'll believe
For only then you will see
You will see

Give yourself to me
