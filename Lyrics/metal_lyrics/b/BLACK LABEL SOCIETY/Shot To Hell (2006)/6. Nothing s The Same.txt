Lost again and all alone
Lost again for I should have known
So many scars, so many times I've died
Another good-bye

Crash and burn
Refused to learn
Your only friend inside the scars that never mend
This trips inside the dark
The never ending rain
Kill the past
Nothing's the same
Nothing's the same

All the faces I once knew now are gone
Days turn into years rolling on
So many storms
So many times I have died
Another good-bye
