Undertaking
All forsaking
Where you gonna go
No one told you how it would be
Helter Skelter
Ain't no shelter
Stare into the sun
You can look buy you won't see

Where are you gonna go
The rise before the fall
When you're just sick of it all

Fly so high
You're gonna die
When one's got broken wings
No one told you how it would be
The battle between the highs and low
Drown yourself again
Its where you find that you're free

Where are you gonna go
Nothing left that you know
The rise before the fall
When you're just sick of it all
