There is no rationale, nothing is real
There is no sympathy when one cannot feel
Distorted mirrors, you see yourself
Trapped in your nightmares
Nothing els

Blacked Out in this Blacked Out World

Architect Of hate
Creator of doom
Upon the wings of destruction
Will be there soon
Commit your final suicide
Your final act
Last show of atrocity
Ain't no coming back

Blacked Out in this Blacked Out World
