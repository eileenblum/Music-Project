Once more
Forever 'till the end of time
Forever found
Think what you may, but honey I ain't blind

Lost in the shuffle like a child all alone
Count my days for the end is my home
Once more
Forever 'till the end of time

Oh

Once more
I kill myself again
Once more
I'm a slave to the goddamn end

Lost in the shuffle like a child all alone
Counting my days for the end is my home
Once more
Forever 'till the end of time

Oh
