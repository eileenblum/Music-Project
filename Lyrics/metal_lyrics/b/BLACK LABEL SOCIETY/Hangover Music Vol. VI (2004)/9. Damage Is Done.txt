I paved this road
I broke myself in two
This I know
Up and down, In between
There's nothing I haven't seen 

All these scars which bear my name, yeah
My eyes are wide, ain't nothing's the same, yeah
I tried to run, but the damage is done, yeah
The damage is done
The damage is done

Where I've gone and where I've been
One only knows
One more mountain, one more mile
I'll do as I'm told

All these scars which bear my name, yeah
My eyes are wide, ain't nothing's the same, yeah
I tried to run, but the damage is done, yeah
The damage is done
The damage is done

Oh yeah, oh yeah
The damage is done
Oh yeah, oh yeah
The damage is done
Oh yeah, oh yeah
The damage is done
Oh yeah, oh yeah
The damage is done

All these scars which bear my name, yeah
My eyes are wide, ain't nothing's the same, yeah
I tried to run, but the damage is done, yeah
the damage is done
the damage is done

Oh yeah, oh yeah
The damage is done
Oh yeah, oh yeah
The damage is done
Oh yeah, oh yeah
The damage is done
Oh yeah, oh yeah
The damage is done
Oh yeah, oh yeah
The damage is done
Oh yeah, oh yeah
The damage is done
Oh yeah, oh yeah
The damage is done
