I've tried, I've tried (I've tried)
Oh, I've tried
I've been bought and sold (and sold)
One too many times 

I ain't your puppet, no
And I ain't your steppin' stone
I should have looked before I jumped
I should have known

Out and down (and down)
Lost and never found
Deaf and blind (and blind)
Insane and out of mind

I ain't your puppet, no
And I ain't your steppin' stone
I should have looked before I jumped
I should have known
I ain't your puppet, no
And I ain't your steppin' stone
I should have looked before I jumped
I should have known

I ain't your puppet, no
And I ain't your steppin' stone
I should have looked before I jumped
I should have known
I ain't your puppet, no
And I ain't your steppin' stone
I should have looked before I jumped
I should have known
