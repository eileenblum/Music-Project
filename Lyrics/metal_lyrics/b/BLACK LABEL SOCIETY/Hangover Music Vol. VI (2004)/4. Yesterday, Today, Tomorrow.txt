Something's always going on
Whatever's right is always wrong
But I don't mind, I don't mind
The clouds are here, sun has come
So confused, so numb
But I don't mind, I don't mind 

Burnt and faded out
Faded out, faded out
Burnt and faded out
Faded out

Take all I can in stride
No you ain't the only one in this life
Now I don't mind, I don't mind
Once you find yourself over here
Next you find yourself over there
But I don't mind, I don't mind

Burnt and faded out
Faded out, faded out
Burnt And Faded out
Faded out

Ain't no, ain't no yesterdays
Forget tomorrow, forget it all
We've got today.
Oh there ain't no yesterdays
Forget tomorrow, forget it all
We've got today.
