This fear that clouds my mind
This fear that just won't die
Blacked out this world
Nothing's pure, nothing's real 

Oh, I'm just bidding my time
'Till I wave Goodbye

If I could, you know I'd die
The final rest, just one big lie
This trip that's broke my back
My death is war, it's where I'm at

Oh, I'm just bidding my time
'Till I wave Goodbye
Oh, Goodbye
Oh, Oh, Oh yeah
'Till I wave goodbye
