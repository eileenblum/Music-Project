[Procol Harum cover]

We skipped the light fandango 
And turned cartwheels across the floor 
Yeah, I was feeling kind of seasick 
But the crowd called out for more, yeah, oh yeah
And the room was humming harder 
And as the ceiling flew away 
We called out for another drink, oh yeah
The waiter brought the tray 

And so it was that later, yeah
As the miller told his tale 
That her face at first just ghostly 
Turned a whiter shade of pale 

She said there is no reason 
And the truth is plain to see 
But I wandered through my playing cards 
And I would not let her be, oh, oh yeah
One of sixteen vestal virgins 
Who were leaving for the coast 
And oh, and my eyes were open 
They might just as well have been closed 

And so it was that later, oh
As the miller told his tale 
That her face at first just ghostly 
Turned a whiter shade of pale, oh yeah

Oh, and so it was, yeah, oh later
The miller told his tale
Yeah her face was kinda ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale, oh yeah
