I thought I knew who you were
I thought I did, now I ain't so sure
I can't believe what I see
I take a look and I know what you need 

Out of your mind
Oh, you must be crazy or high
Out of your mind
Oh, you must be crazy or high

Days have changed and rolled by
They are forever 'till the day that I die
You tried to kill me again
I feel no pain although the scars never mend

Out of your mind
Oh, you must be crazy or high
Out of your mind
Oh, you must be crazy or high

Out of your mind
Oh, you must be crazy or high
Out of your mind
Oh, you must be crazy or high
