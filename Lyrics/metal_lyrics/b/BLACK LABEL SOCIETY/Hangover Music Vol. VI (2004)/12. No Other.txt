Stoned once again
How long has it been?
Oh, there can be no other
My ever constant fix
For in the stream which drowns my sin
Oh, there can be no other 

Oh, could I be wrong, could I be wrong, oh no
Oh, it's where I fear I belong
Oh, I've lost myself along the way
Oh, yeah, ain't got nothing left to say
I've burnt my bridge to the past
And I buried my broken bones
How I long for what I once had known

Cinder blocks and chains
Laid by the insane
Oh, there can be no other
Worthless to the core
Diseased forever more
Oh, there can be no other

Oh, could I be wrong, could I be wrong, oh no
Oh, it's where I fear I belong
Oh, I've lost myself along the way
Oh, yeah, ain't got nothing left to say
I've burnt my bridge to the past
And I buried my broken bones
How I long for what I once had known

Oh, could I be wrong, could I be wrong, oh no
Oh, it's where I fear I belong
Oh, I've lost myself along the way
Oh, yeah, ain't got nothing left to say
I've burnt my bridge to the past
And buried my broken bones
How I long for what I once had known
How I long for what I once had known
How I long for what I once had known
