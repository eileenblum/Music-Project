Run, run away
Close your mouth
Don't you say
Scared, and all alone
The door is closed
Ain't no one's home
You speak
But no one hears
Brace yourself
Your darkest fears
The sick and twisted mind
Has sought you out
It's come to find 

She, she deserves a free ride
She, she deserves a free ride
She, she deserves a free ride

Val, don't you cry
You ain't to blame
Don't wonder why
The sick and twisted mind
Search for peace
For you shall find

She, she deserves a free ride
She, she deserves a free ride
She, she deserves a free ride

She, she deserves a free ride
She, she deserves a free ride
She, she deserves a free ride
