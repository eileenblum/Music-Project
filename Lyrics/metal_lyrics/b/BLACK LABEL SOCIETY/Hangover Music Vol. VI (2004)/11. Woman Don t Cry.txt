In the end, all will be fine
I'm losing your mind
Life is short, we all run out of time
This darkness that's set in your room
Close your eyes, we're all leaving soon
But now, I'm going away 

Woman, don't you cry
Woman, don't you cry

This ain't the first or the last
Goodbyes come so fast
The darkness that's here, it never ends
Always so close yet so far
I've seen the blood and the scars
Right now, I'm going away 

Woman, don't you cry
Woman, don't you cry 

Woman, don't you cry
Woman, don't you cry 

Woman, don't you cry
Woman, don't you cry

Woman, don't you cry
Woman, don't you cry
