Hey now,
I've stepped into the black
I say hey now
I wont be coming back
I say hey now
I've left it all behind
I say hey now
Take a look but you won't find, no

Step outside this world where I'll be free, yeah
Step outside this world where I can see, oh
Queen of sorrow and all this hell within
Oh, I close my eyes and sit back as I watch my end begin 

Hey now
Void of sight and sound
I say hey now
The spiral always down
I say hey now
There ain't no coming back
I say hey now
I've stepped into the black now

Step outside this world where I'll be free, yeah
Step outside this world where I can see, oh
Queen of sorrow and all this hell within, oh
Oh, I close my eyes and sit back as I watch my end begin

Step outside this world where I'll be free, yeah
Step outside this world where I can see, oh
Queen of sorrow and all this hell within
Oh, I close my eyes and sit back as I watch my end begin
