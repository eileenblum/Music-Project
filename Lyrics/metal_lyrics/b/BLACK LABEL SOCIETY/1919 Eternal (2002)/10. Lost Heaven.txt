My lost heaven has been turned upside down
Dead and buried is the joy which I once found
My lost heaven has sought refuge down below
Ain't no ocean I wouldn't cross or anywhere I wouldn't go

As I walk this world, tired and alone
Got one foot in the grave, Lord, help me make it home
I'll carry your pain, my words bleed straight and true
If it leads me to you

My lost heaven as long as the rotted day
Strength through blood
Battle the flood which bears my name
Dead and buried, for the end has run its course
Dogs of war return never to be lost

As I walk this world, tired and alone
Got one foot in the grave, Lord, help me make it home
I'll carry your pain, my words bleed straight and true
If it leads me to you

As I walk this world, tired and alone
Got one foot in the grave, Lord, help me make it home
I'll carry your pain, my words bleed straight and true
If it leads me to you
If it leads me to you
If it leads me to you
If it leads me to you
If it leads me to you
