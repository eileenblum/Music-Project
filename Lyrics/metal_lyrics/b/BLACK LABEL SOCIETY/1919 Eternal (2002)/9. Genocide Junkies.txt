Loaded, stormin' out of control
Fired up, hell ridin' we roll
Drinkin' from the well of the damned
Seize the roads, assault the land

Respect through fear
Walkin' tall
Beyond unreal

Always up for the ride
Junkies of the genocide

Risin' always above
Hell ridin' never enough
The rush of the chrome, to reign supreme
Pistons of torture, crucifixion of speed

Respect through fear
Walkin' tall
Beyond unreal

Always up for the ride
Junkies of the genocide
Always up for the ride
Junkies of the genocide

Intimidation, degradation, loomin' large, desecration
Bury the old game, worship the insane
Tomorrow will soon be here
Immune to fear, tomorrow is never here
Hell ridin' the gears of life
Intimidation, degradation, loomin' large, desecration

Always up for the ride
Junkies of the genocide
Always up for the ride
Junkies of the genocide
