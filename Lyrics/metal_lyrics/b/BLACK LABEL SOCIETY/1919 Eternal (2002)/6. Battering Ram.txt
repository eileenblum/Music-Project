Through your fear I am reborn
My hand of grief can't be ignored

You know my name, yeah you know who I am
Frustrated turmoil again and again
I am the spike which drives through your hand
For I am eternal, battering ram

I'd kill myself to see you die
As you suffer, tears of joy come to my eyes

You know my name, yeah you know who I am
Frustrated turmoil again and again
I am the spike which drives through your hand
For I am eternal, battering ram

You know my name, yeah you know who I am
Frustrated turmoil again and again
I am the spike which drives through your hand
For I am eternal, battering ram

You know my name, yeah you know who I am
Frustrated turmoil again and again
I am the spike which drives through your hand
For I am eternal, battering ram

You know my name, yeah you know who I am
Frustrated turmoil again and again
I am the spike which drives through your hand
For I am eternal, battering ram
