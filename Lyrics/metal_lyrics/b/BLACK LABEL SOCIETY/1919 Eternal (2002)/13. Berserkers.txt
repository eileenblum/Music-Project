Smokin', trippin', drinkin', never thinkin' what's to be
Another day, another war has come to set me free
The cage is broke, the tank is full, it's where the violence rules
Drinkin' booze and raisin' rifles, hell straight through and through

A never ending rolling nightmare with no end in sight
I start to drink, get high and smashed, it gets me feeling right
The cage is broke, the tank is full, it's where the violence rules
Drinkin' booze and raisin' rifles, hell straight through and through

Drinkin', pukin', pissin', and fightin'
Startin' all over again
Drinkin', pukin', pissin', and fightin'
Startin' all over again
Drinkin', pukin', pissin', and fightin'
Startin' all over again
Drinkin', pukin', pissin', and fightin'
Startin' all over again

Where I fall and where I rise, I couldn't give a damn
Another shot, another beer, is all that I have planned
The cage is broke, the tank is full, it's where the violence rules
Drinkin' booze and raisin' rifles, hell straight through and through
