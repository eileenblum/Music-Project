Take a good look, I know what ya see
Shrouded in black, and all life's debris
Shot in the back, live through the day
Ain't no remorse, you do as they say

Now that I've seen what's come and past
Forget all that's pure, it never lasts
Inside the mass murder machine

Victims for life, slaves to the end
Rooted in sick, how it's always been
Built to destroy, one can't deny
The hole that becomes, the hand in the sky

Now that I've seen what's come and past
Forget all that's pure, it never lasts
Inside the mass murder machine
Now that I've seen what's come and past
Forget all that's pure, it never lasts
Inside the mass murder machine

I wish I was blind, yeah I wish I was blind
Oh no
I wish I was blind, yeah I wish I was blind
Oh no
I wish I was blind, yeah I wish I was blind
Oh no
I wish I was blind, yeah I wish I was blind
Oh Lord

I've seen all that's come and all that's past
Forget all that's pure, it never lasts
Inside the mass murder machine
I've seen all that's come and all that's past
Forget all that's pure, it never lasts
Inside the mass murder machine
I've seen all that's come and all that's past
Forget all that's pure, it never lasts
Inside the mass murder machine
I've seen all that's come and all that's past
Forget all that's pure, it never lasts
Inside the mass murder machine
