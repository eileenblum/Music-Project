Graveyard disciples march into the fields
Existence through destruction
The bodies beneath the wheels

The trip into the black
Life's dying fall

Born to pull the trigger
Fuel to feed the hate
Innocence is shattered
The blood that cripples the hand of fate

The trip into the black
Life's dying fall

The trip into the black
Life's dying fall
