What have you done, where have you been
Lord of the handout, always once again
Always once again
Always once again
Always once

Refuse to bow down, refuse to bleed
Eternal illusion, ain't no one can see
Refuse to bow down, refuse to bleed
Eternal illusion, ain't no one can see

Ain't no time to rest, got the pedal to the floor
Ain't no end in sight, forever wanting more
Forever wanting more
Forever wanting more
Forever wanting

Refuse to bow down, refuse to bleed
Eternal illusion, ain't no one can see
Refuse to bow down, refuse to bleed
Eternal illusion, ain't no one can see

Refuse to bow down, refuse to bleed
Eternal illusion, ain't no one can see
Refuse to bow down, refuse to bleed
Eternal illusion, ain't no one can see

Refuse to bow down, refuse to bleed
Eternal illusion, ain't no one can see
Refuse to bow down, refuse to bleed
Eternal illusion, ain't no one can see

Refuse to bow down, refuse to bleed
Eternal illusion, ain't no one can see
Refuse to bow down, refuse to bleed
Eternal illusion, ain't no one can see
