Walk in my world of war and mass confusion
Peace is a word that no one cares of knowing
Death is the drug of choice amongst the masses
Engines of hell forever burning faster

The shotgun of life, the spread of all the ashes
The wheels of the tank, the souls in which it smashes
Oceans of blood, the shores of all the fallen
The hole in the ground, forever always callin'

Lords of destruction
Lords of destruction
Lords of destruction
Lords of destruction
Lords of destruction
Lords of destruction
Lords of destruction
Lords of destruction
