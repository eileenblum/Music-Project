You, yeah you, yeah you 
You got a cardboard cutout soul 
Just a powertripping, mindraping, backstabbing junkie 
Thinking your hype is true 
You, yeah you, yeah you 
Respect ain't a word you know 
You're just a fabricated lie that doesn't exist 
Dropping names wherever you go

[CHORUS]
Life's phoney smiles and fake hellos 
The hardcore rush of watching heads roll 
As I dig your grave and kill your lifeless stare 
Fuck yourself for all I fucking care 

You, yeah you, yeah you 
Thinking you know it all 
35 years old with a wife and two kids 
Still living and your mother's home 
You, yeah you, yeah you 
A sellout and a social whore 
You'd sell your mother's soul just to get ahead 
A disease down to the core 

[Chorus]

You, yeah you, yeah you 
Still haven't figured what it is you do 
Just a no talent nothing with a ten ton ego 
Until your 15 minutes are through 
You, yeah you, yeah you 
A conscience deaf and blind 
I'm driving the hearse without remorse 
Killing you and your kind 

[Chorus]
