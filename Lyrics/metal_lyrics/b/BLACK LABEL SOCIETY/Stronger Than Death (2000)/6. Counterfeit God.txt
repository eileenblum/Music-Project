Can't you see I feel your pain? 
I've got Jesus running through my veins 
In this hopeless life that's turned on you 
Give yourself to me, I'll help you through 
I feed off your unanswered fear 
When visions of life's end appear 
Hand over your will and then you'll see 
Now get on your knees and worship me

[CHORUS]
Worship me 
On your knees 
Worship me

In this world when at it's best 
Of never ending hate and death 
Abandon all and trust in me 
Escaping from reality 
My world it has no space or time 
The crippled walk and the sick feel fine 
Hand over your will and then you'll see 
Now get on your knees and worship me

[Chorus]

Beyond this wall of life unknown 
I'll lead you where you need to go 
Void of worry, stress and pain 
Left with nothing but your name 
We've washed your brain and cleansed your soul 
Till' nothing's all you need to know 
Hand over your will and then you'll see 
Now get on your knees and worship me

[Chorus]
