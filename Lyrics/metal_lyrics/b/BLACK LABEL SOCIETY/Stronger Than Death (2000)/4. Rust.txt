Living, fighting, obsessing 
Just as long as I can share it all with you 
Yesterday, today, tomorrow, come rain, come shine 
Hell and back, the beginning in between till' the end of time 

[CHORUS]
All that shines turns to rust 
All that stands in time turns to dust

As above, so below 
But you ain't no fool and honey, I'm damn sure that you know
Yesterday, today, tomorrow, come rain, come shine 
Hell and back, the beginning in between till' the end of time

[Chorus]
