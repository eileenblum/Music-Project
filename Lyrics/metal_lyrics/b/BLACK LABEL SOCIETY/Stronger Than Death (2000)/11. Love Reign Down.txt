All that you want, and all that you need 
Don't bother asking, just come to me 
I know I'll see you, I'll see you again 
Just keep on talking, listen when you can

Love reign down on me 
Love reign down on me 
Love reign down on me 
Love reign down on me 
Oh, Down On Me

It's something you find,yeah, you'll never lose 
A feeling so fine now, just thinking of you 
Take your time son, take it slow 
Sooner or later, you'll get where you gotta go

Love reign down on me 
Love reign down on me 
Love reign down on me 
Love reign down on me 
Oh, Down On Me

Looking back on the times we shared 
Yeah, you and me 
You held me up, you made me high 
You're the way life's meant to be
