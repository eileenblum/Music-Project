Kicked around, smacked about
Gagged &amp; bound
No more on the down &amp; out
Took my pay, cut me off, had a laugh
Tables are now turning around
Thought it was funny
Just spending my money
Thinking I'm a joke
Yeah, oh yeah
No more doors shut on life &amp; me
Now I refuse to see

Ohh!
I will break you, I'm the bullet that's miles inside your head
The final vision, last word that shall be said
I will break you, I'm the bullet that's miles inside your head

We meet again, how have you been?
Meet my friend
I've come to collect what's mine
Immune to fear, with this gun in hand
The future's clear
All that was is to be realigned
Thought it was funny, spending my money
Thinking I'm a joke
Yeah, Oh Yeah
Life's four walls crashing down
Closing in
Let's let your end begin

Yes I am, yes I am
If you ask me, I'd do it again
