[Lyrics byÂ Fadi Sarieddine]

Beware the rage rising from the eastÂ 
A merciless tyrant, a rampaging beastÂ 
Brigade of slayers shielding his chestÂ 
Seven heads ten horns lay on his crestÂ 

Everything means nothingÂ 
All you've ever knownÂ 
All will turn to ashesÂ 
As our destiny unfoldsÂ 
The world as we know itÂ 
Falls into the deepÂ 
Forces of terrorÂ 
Have tainted our creedÂ 

Lies and deception guide his wayÂ 
Tears of joy mark his dayÂ 
Little they know, they're cheering forÂ 
The evil beast will destroy them allÂ 

Holding together all the right keysÂ 
He brings the seventh down to its kneesÂ 
Day by day, reform by reformÂ 
We are all plunged to the unknownÂ 

Fear, pain, sorrowÂ 
Integral to his reignÂ 
Freedom, abandonedÂ 
All in his nameÂ 

His timely murder, all well plannedÂ 
Giving rise to the king of the damnedÂ 
He seeks revenge for his fallen sonÂ 
The end of times has begunÂ 

Everything means nothingÂ 
All you've ever knownÂ 
All will turn to ashesÂ 
As our destiny unfoldsÂ 
The world as we know itÂ 
Falls into the deepÂ 
Forces of terrorÂ 
Have tainted our creed
