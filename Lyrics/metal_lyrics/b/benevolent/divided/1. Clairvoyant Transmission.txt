[Lyrics by Fadi Sarieddine]

I gasp for air, fear in my eyesÂ 
As this city falls to its demiseÂ 
I rush for help, only to findÂ 
I lay in the anguish of my mindÂ 

How could this be, it seemed so realÂ 
The blood of men, those running tearsÂ 
That smoke and fire, rising from the peersÂ 
The burning skin that I could feelÂ 

What did I see?Â 
It felt so realÂ 
Where did I go?Â 
What does it mean?Â 

Escape this worldÂ 
Lay afloatÂ 
Senses comes to lifeÂ 
Body's lostÂ 
Amidst the fallÂ 
Body's paralyzedÂ 
Clairvoyant transmissionÂ 
Living past my lifeÂ 

Running around, from place to placeÂ 
Trying to know what it all meansÂ 
Is this a sign, should I be warnedÂ 
Or should I just let it goÂ 

Those howling screams, that painful siteÂ 
Clouds of ash spreading far and wideÂ 
The cries for help, those tearful eyesÂ 
Cracking earth as bodies layÂ 

What did I just see?Â 
It felt so realÂ 
What did I just go?Â 
What does it all mean?Â 

Escape this worldÂ 
Lay afloatÂ 
Senses comes to lifeÂ 
Body's lostÂ 
Amidst the fallÂ 
Body's paralyzedÂ 
Clairvoyant transmissionÂ 
Living past my lifeÂ 

Weeks go by, for me to findÂ 
The foretold city falls to its demiseÂ 
What felt so real, came to lifeÂ 
Now I know what it all means
