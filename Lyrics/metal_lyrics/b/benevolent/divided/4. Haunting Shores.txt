[Lyrics byÂ Hadi Sarieddine]

Haunting Shores, cracking doorsÂ 
Winds to whisper, terrors and horrorsÂ 
Souls were lost, and never foundÂ 
Stories known, but never toldÂ 

Wings and flames navigate the skyÂ 
No escape, no one can fend off the witch and the swordÂ 

Sky lit in fireÂ 
Rain painted bloodÂ 
This darkest hourÂ 
Is a story never toldÂ 

They rise from the depths of hellÂ 
Spreading fear under her spellÂ 
Tonight, two worlds collideÂ 
Paving way as the lands divideÂ 

One by one, 'till there are noneÂ 
Darkness falls, upon us allÂ 

Wings and flames navigate the skyÂ 
No escape, no one can fend off the witch and the sword.Â 

Sky lit in fireÂ 
Rain painted bloodÂ 
This darkest hourÂ 
Is a story never told
