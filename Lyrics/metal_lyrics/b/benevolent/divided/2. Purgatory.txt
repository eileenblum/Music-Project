[Lyrics byÂ Hadi Sarieddine]

Woke up to, the smell of dustÂ 
Breathing in, in disbelieveÂ 

Fighting to remember, what happened hereÂ 
I won't surrender, I'm past my fearÂ 

I'm searching for youÂ 
Night and dayÂ 
I'm waiting for youÂ 
Here I stayÂ 

Shaking off the dustÂ 
Finding all I've lostÂ 
I know I'll find you hereÂ 
I feel your presence is nearÂ 

No sign, no one aroundÂ 
What was lost may never be foundÂ 
I haven't spoken in yearsÂ 
My eyes have no more tearsÂ 

My heart has no more fearsÂ 
Your voice still echoes in my earsÂ 
Your memories keep me aliveÂ 
Past this tragedy I've survivedÂ 

I feel so weak and aloneÂ 
All my reason may be goneÂ 
No sign of lifeÂ 
No reason for lightÂ 

I'm searching for youÂ 
Night and dayÂ 
I'm waiting for youÂ 
Here I stay
