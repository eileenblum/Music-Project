[Lyrics byÂ Fadi Sarieddine]

A near death experienceÂ 
Relief at this blessed escapeÂ 
In a parallel universeÂ 
Another version met their fateÂ 

While another did surviveÂ 
To recover and prolong their lifeÂ 
The bush like branching prevailsÂ 
As we remain dividedÂ 

How can this be, another world, another meÂ 
What would happen if I returnÂ 
To assassinate my forefathersÂ 
Shattering the family crestÂ 
What will happen to me nextÂ 

Logic in opinion all aroundÂ 
Reasoning this quantum dilemmaÂ 
The truth is no where to be foundÂ 
As they remain dividedÂ 

How can this be, another world, another meÂ 
What would happen if I returnÂ 
To assassinate my forefathersÂ 
Shattering the family crestÂ 
What will happen to me nextÂ 

Space and time, intertwinedÂ 
Our existence, redefinedÂ 
Parallel lives, endless trialsÂ 
Dimensions remain dividedÂ 

The fourth dimension of timeÂ 
Neither uniform or absoluteÂ 
Intersecting the might of spaceÂ 
Possibilities you can't refuteÂ 
Countless incarnations of realityÂ 
They all remain dividedÂ 

Space and time, intertwinedÂ 
Our existence, redefinedÂ 
Parallel lives, endless trialsÂ 
Dimensions remain divided
