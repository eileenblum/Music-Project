[Lyrics from Tuomas RiihimÃ¤ki]

Parasites, the decayed voices
Horror visions and violent whispers
The sweet taste of illusion
The obsessive strength of lies

[Chorus]
The frozen silence crawling in
Mindless dreams
Awakened lust, hopeless path fading
Come to me, come to realize
Lost and forgotten
Truth has no color, true blood is rare.

Pleased by the unwanted figure
With no regrets, just don't forget
The hypnosis strikes me down
But my dreams carry on

There is no way out of this path.
