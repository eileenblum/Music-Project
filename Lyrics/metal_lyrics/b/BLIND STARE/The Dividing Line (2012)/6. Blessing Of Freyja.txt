[Lyrics from Anders ÃstrÃ¶m]

Blessed light take me away from the end
Broken by dreams
We are born from the death of our sinned
To tear it open, the Earth, from her pain

Two thousand years and
Still no sign from Him, this mind is set
Dream by dream I walk back and forth
Led by the shadows of us all
War by war I die more and more
Led by the signs in the empty wall

[Chorus]
All I hear is silence, red like blood
Beautiful destruction, we watch in awe

One hundred thousand soldiers
Religious cults of madness

Blessed light take me away from the end
Failed by life
We are born from the death of our sinned
To tear it open, the Earth, from her pain.
