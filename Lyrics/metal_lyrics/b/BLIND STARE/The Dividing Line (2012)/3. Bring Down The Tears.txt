[Lyrics from Anders ÃstrÃ¶m]

Giving up the endless walk
Through the broken signs
Search for the ending
Where no-one has ever been
Living in a fantasy
Or disguised in the shadows

Shutdown
Shutdown minds from the worldwide
Blindness prevailing our lives

[Chorus]
Where is the glory of our last days
There lies the truth of our blackened hearts
Feels like I've been here before
It's more than just an empty feeling
More than just a dÃ©jÃ  vu

Dead inside I built my wall
Shelter for my heart
Enclosing my tears
Inside my mind in nothingness
Perfect shielding for
The great cold curtains to fall

I just fight to find way out of the sunlight
Veins are freezing inside my soul is dead!

There's no hope for the dreaming ones
There's no cover, no shelter
No escape from the silent guns
Wall of lies, liberty fails
