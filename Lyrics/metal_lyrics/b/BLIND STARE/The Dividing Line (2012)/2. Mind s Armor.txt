[Lyrics from Anders ÃstrÃ¶m and Timo Palokankare]

Now weep for the world
where only gray flowers bloom

[Chorus]
Like a war ending our life
The white stone shines
Relentless king, He reigns
Take a bow as their maker descends
The vial breaks
One mind is gone
Still in sanity we trust

Forever we trust

Give me back my mind
Bring back my voice to set me free!

Infected, oblivious and willing to consent to a lie
The choice is mine how long I stay blind?
Or will I wake?

This daemon I designed
It stays beside the shadow I cast

Don't trust

Give me back my mind
Possessed and blinded by fear
Bring back my voice to set me free.
