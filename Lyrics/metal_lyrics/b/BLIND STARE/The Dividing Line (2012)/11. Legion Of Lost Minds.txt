[Lyrics from Anders ÃstrÃ¶m]

[Chorus]
Stay away from the sadness and pain
Stay away forever again

White crown and the ruined future awaiting
The Messiah, The Lord of the worms

Scorched ground burning before you
You're paralyzed, have no choice
But to pledge allegiance to me

Curtains of the shadows, they are wast
King of everything, a distant dream
Failing to see reality
Take the divine infection
Take the divine injection
And it's yours

Rise before me my newborn son

There is no-one to bow before you
Your throne is thin as the air

Do you see it finally my son?
You doublecrossed, you betrayed being

We are the choirs of the madness
Legion of Lost Minds
Crying out the list of your sins

This is the revered hatred
The loneliness, the grieving rage
I am the revered hatred
The end of everything
This is the worshipped one
Dust of the Earth
The pathetic man
The worshipped one
The lifeless wraith
I hear it calling my name.
