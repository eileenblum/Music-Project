[Lyrics from Jaako Lehtinen and Eino Tuominen]

Listen!
At the frail glass halls of his mind
Remove the blindfold!
The statues and the banners began to collapse

So, what options you were given?
Pain was the number one on that list
You, had to to tear down the walls and barriers
To keep your sanity and freedom

[Chorus]
You did not feel hatred anymore
Everything felt good and right
Like you had wiped out an error
That caused this world to rot

But again you realize - Nothing did change
Too much unspoken, statues are falling
You cannot change the mind
Of the sheep flock called humanity
It was all in vein

Her fingers run through my hair
All her lies run through my mind
Razor blades on her finger tips
Rend on my skin

Pain was the number one on that list
9. Suffering
8. Fear
7. Death
6. Hate
5. Insanity
4. Deceit
3. Torment
2. Rage
And Pain!
