[Lyrics from Jaako Lehtinen and Timo Palokankare]

The wither, inconceivable darkness inside
Define the sanity: in the wake of the forgotten
I take the fall

Cry out - for redemption
Downfall - the end has begun

My sweet insanity, a comforting lie
False sense of justice and no one to blame
The world, my crawlspace
Speak to me my soul, I'm lost

[Chorus]
The end has begun
The end has begun
Cry out
Cry out
For Redemption

No one there?
The serpent's alive
I found the way to eternity

Death is kneeling to me
In yearning rapture lost my insanity
The sole survivor from darkness within
feelings of hatred keep me alive

Is this life a remake of yesterday's lies?
All in all - whispers from beyond?
All in all - just whispers from beyond.
