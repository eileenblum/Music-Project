[Lyrics from Jaako Lehtinen and Eino Tuominen]

Loss of Reason for a moment
I thought it was ok
Maybe it could have been
Without all the faces
Sweet taste of disappointment
The ultimate hate experience
Sweet dreams you mother fucker
You were living for the excess.
Living for your dreams.
Did you have to be so high?

[Chorus]
I'm so afraid
Afraid of the otherside
I'm so aware
Aware of all the lies that kill me
And I do hate - and I'll break your soul
'cause I hate all the faces
I'm so afraid. I'm so afraid.

Standing up one more time
I found what I was after
No more the trail of tears
Burning pain is gone
Feeling of heavenly life
Compared only to the death
My life, your death
I am living for the moment
Living on the edge.
I know that I'm alive again.

I don't see you, I don't feel you
No more trail of tears burning pain is gone
I don't know you, I don't need you
My life your death.
