[Lyrics from Anders ÃstrÃ¶m]

The judgement is near
The judgement is here

Daughter of the Sun
Today our minds will be as one
Gathered before you
The judgement is near
The judgement is here

And the flames descend from the heavens
All the horns will play for majestic blood
We cry, crown salutes you

[Chorus]
When all the time has faded
Then will be shown the mark of the sun
Watch as the darkness becomes the bright light
Of this dramatic, chaotic world
Will be under the grace
The will of the silent grace

And it's time to feed the hunger
Within this tempted soul
Burn with the time and feed the flames
With the remembrance of the truth
For the truth

Shine upon my guiding light
For the glory of my hollow pride
For the name of my descended guide
Shining does not forgive the ones
Whose faith didn't last 'till the end of the time
Burning, burning everyone is burning
As she bathes in the lights of the flames so bright.
