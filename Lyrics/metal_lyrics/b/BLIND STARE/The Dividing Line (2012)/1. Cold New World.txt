[Lyrics from Jaako Lehtinen and Timo Palokankare]

Are you the one to save the day?
Confess your sins and walk the way
The call to arms is ranting strong!
Disrupted system, there's no absolution
What's your endgame? Now, break the silence!

[Chorus]
Run, or live to fight forever!
Dark, the path for the fallen ones
Rage against the silent mankind
and stand on the head of this Cold New World

Discovering our evil machine
No cure for chaos, insanity
Become the void, the grief, the nothingness
The time has passed to realize
For that we have to pay the price
When the walls go down
there are so few real heroes!

The silent hollow man arises
Tomorrow holds no greater pride
Pyres destroy before our eyes
And break apart your mind again
Foolish mortals rape your gods
Your souls eternally decay
We cry bloody murder!

From sanctitude they lead us
And in disbelief we must remain
For the final hour is about to unveil
The times of terror fall upon the world of reason
When the walls go down you're done

We're in the end, no time to repent
The paragon of men arise and fall

Run, we had to fight forever!
Dark the path for the fallen ones
Rage against the silent mankind
No new beginning for those who will waste it all.
