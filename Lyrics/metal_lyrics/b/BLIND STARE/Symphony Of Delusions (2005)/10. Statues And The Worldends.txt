From time to time I feel the same again
The sorrow and the hate for this world
Thousands of sleepless nights in the endless rain
Many days just thinking all these lies
And all this hatred in me

Many days just thinking all these lies
And I am nothing but a lie

The only thing that can kill me
Is the exception in this program "life"

Far beyond the light I am
IÂ´m running as fast as I can
But the world slowly fades away
And so do I!
The reason is the blade of mine
The answer is the fear of time
The only thing that can kill me
Is the exception in this program "life"

Is this what we have been searching for?
Is this all what we have been waiting for?

This is only a joke, nothing else this can not be
All the people and the time and the ordinary life is what we see
How can they be so stupid they can not see?
What the fuck have I done so evil that IÂ´m born here, free?

So IÂ´m born here at the feet of this monster statue
The fear of truth is so hard that they refuse from it

And my personal worldend...
It doesnÂ´t mean just death
And my last words for the mankind
Are vanished with the world itself
