Flashbacks from the war
Calm silence before the fight
Snowy road covered in blood
Suicide by my side

You are my ender
Cause for my agony
You are my ender
I can not take it anymore!

Never ending everlasting torture of your soul
Just one look through my eyes should be enough for you

Old man looking out from the window
Tired face watching the sunset
Still holding the quill in his hands
He knows the story must be finished

Hearing echoes from the eternity
Still fighting only the enemy differs
Once a soldier so great now afraid of death
One great enemy of men

Forgotten and buried deep those words will be
Time takes itÂ´s own, guaranty's freedom
The last fight is to take place at the frontiers of human mind!

Never ending everlasting torture of your soul
Just one look through my eyes should be enough for you

Old man looking out from the window
Tired face watching the sunset
Still holding the quill in his hands
He knows the story must be finished

Weak fire burning on
And the last chapter is soon ready
But the quill drops from his hands
And the story remains unwritten forever

You are my ender
Cause for my agony
You are my ender
I can not take it anymore!
