Finally I can see it all so clear
The lies and contorted reality
It took so long to realize it
But now I am free from their chains

I know IÂ´m all alone
But I donÂ´t care
What is the difference
Between a genius and an insane?

I am a reborn genius
One that has waken
The correction in the worldÂ´s balance
Because I see it all now

IÂ´ve lost these many years
The lost one whoÂ´s shed too many tears
Must recall revelation in the dark
For past and future, for all under my mark
IÂ´ve been drowned, IÂ´ve been crowned
IÂ´ve been dead and yet so blind
I have reached the end of my path
The knowledge, the wisdom behind my wrath!

I thought it was all right then
But now IÂ´ll put an end to it
They knew that one day IÂ´ll find out
ThereÂ´s no way to make it undone

I know IÂ´m all alone
But I donÂ´t care
What is the difference
Between a genius and an insane?

I am a reborn genius
One that has waken
The correction in the worldÂ´s balance
Because I see it all now
