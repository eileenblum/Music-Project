Taken my time and gotten only what IÂ´m given
Upon the wall my shadow dim
With my eyes cold as ice in the past I gaze
And sense the rage within

Reflection back burns like hell
I didnÂ´t win, so hear my yell
Last in line in the game of life
Betrayed and hollow, itÂ´s me who to follow

In sight a despair strong thinking itÂ´s all wrong
I shouldnÂ´t have let go, no way! - I know

Her eyes I see as I close my mind
Opening my soul for her to bind
The riddler comes to me to ask:
"Do you have to hide behind your mask?"

I am not the same I used to be
And now I feel painfully free
Have to forget all the rain
Just to recall the infernal pain
People change, I know they do
Yet I canÂ´t change my point of view
No answer to all questions asked
So pack your bags and finish the task...
(...and die)

Many deeds with no meaning at all
Even so I stand tall
And without a fear I shed no tear
And face what is to come

No more back against the wall
No more roaming the empty hall inside my head
Where all is dead, where shines no light ahead

Out in the distance, for back lies
The essence of life and highest dreams
Behind the point of knowledge
Where the sense of truth so pure and fine
Is cast into the endless time

Taken my time and gotten only what IÂ´m given
Upon the wall my shadow dim
With my eyes cold as ice in the past I gaze
And sense the rage within

Reflection back burns like hell
I didnÂ´t win, so hear my yell
Last in line in the game of life
Betrayed and hollow, itÂ´s me who to follow

Yet no pitch black letters shall be written
For the future reveals its curtain
IÂ´ve heard the eager call from down below
But IÂ´ll stand tall not letting go!

No pitch black letters...
IÂ´ll stand tall...
Not letting go...
Will let go!
