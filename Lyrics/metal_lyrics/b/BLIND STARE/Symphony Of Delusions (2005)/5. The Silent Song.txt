Everytime I wake up youÂ´re beside me
Every moment I feel you in my arms
But as soon as I open my eyes
You are gone like a frail dust in the wind
Again!

I walk in the bottomless flood and drown
Drown in the sea of emptiness
Just a word and the last sign of life
Turns into ashes within my hands

This is the silent song of the dead!
Hear the violins play now... And fall!

Everytime I wake up I see you there
Every moment I look out of the window
Your smile I see, behind the mask
But soon the image disappears and
IÂ´m alone again
IÂ´m alone again!

I walk in the bottomless flood and drown
Drown in the sea of emptiness
Just a word and the last sign of life
Turns into ashes within my hands

When the winds are gathered in one place
When the darkness spreads and no one stands
I am the fragment of an illusion in the silent room
And I am the lost page of the book that the old man
Never could complete

I walk in the bottomless flood and drown
Drown in the sea of emptiness
Just a word and the last sign of life
Turns into ashes within my hands
