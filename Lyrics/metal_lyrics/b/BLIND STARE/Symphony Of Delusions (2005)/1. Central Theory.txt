Slowly fading image is projected on the surface of the earth
Resemble of the past falling under the foundations of a new era
What is the achievement of men so great that really makes the difference?
At the scale of the universe we are nothing but bare dust

Nothing more than dust!

Hate is the force that controls human nature
Only the fats that canÂ´t be denied are lost
CanÂ´t you see that nothing really matters?
CanÂ´t you see what you are doing?
The difference between real and what we see
Hope is worth nothing in this pitiful system!
Setting the traps ahead of us wherever we could fall
So every conclusion is built on empty basis!
World is a reflection of contradictions and is just an illusion

The ordinariness of waking up and going to work like programmed inside
Once you look at it all from objective angle you see how it all works
Master the art of channeling your thinking through the unusualchannels
And become the one with understanding, realize it and program them yourself

Hate is the force that controls human nature
Only the fats that canÂ´t be denied are lost
CanÂ´t you see that nothing really matters?
CanÂ´t you see what you are doing?
The difference between real and what we see
Hope is worth nothing in this pitiful system!
Setting the traps ahead of us wherever we could fall
So every conclusion is built on empty basis!
World is a reflection of contradictions and is just an illusion

Slowly fading image is projected on the surface of the earth
Resemble of the past falling under the foundations of a new era
What is the achievement of men so great that really makes the difference?
At the scale of the universe we are nothing but bare dust
