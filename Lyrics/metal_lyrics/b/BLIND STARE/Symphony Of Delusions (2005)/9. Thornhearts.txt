ThereÂ´nothing for you here
Follow your people and leave these lands
The hope has forsaken this place
The ship is waiting for you
Please take my word
Our time here is at its end

I have no light or darkness left in my eyes anymore
To see the future, IÂ´m at the edge of falling
Your glory once so great is now gone forever
And your death is near
Once I was the king of all men
Now my spirit has weakened and will soon fade away
My sire, your name will always be at the hearts of your people

Leave now, thereÂ´s still time for you!
Forget your consort, itÂ´s time to go!

Silence has surrounded me everything that can be seen
And only the forthcoming shadows
Darkness have been fallen upon these lands
And the cold wind blows away
The last leaves from the trees

I have no light or darkness left in my eyes anymore
To see the future, IÂ´m at the edge of falling
Your glory once so great is now gone forever
And your death is near
Once I was the king of all men
Now my spirit has weakened and will soon fade away
My sire, your name will always be at the hearts of your people

You are the only one left anymore
All the others are gone
Abandoned cities and sinister landscape
Is your kingdom now

Silence has surrounded me everything that can be seen
And only the forthcoming shadows
Darkness have been fallen upon these lands
And the cold wind blows away
The last leaves from the trees
