Realize the very truth that compromises all we know, all we care
And though the shadows are everywhere
I have come to greater understanding of all the aspects of life
You see, my friend, the universe is sentient, aware, alive

ItÂ´s all so simple that way
To live again just another day
But we possess something that canÂ´t be found
The one and only truth in which they all will be drowned!

The revolution of our kind is the center of the progression
Infiltrate the core system and poison its heart
Claim the kingdom of a thousand stars just for yourself
Use all the means to make the world yours again!

The revolution of our kind is the center of the progression
Infiltrate the core system and poison its heart
We see into the forthcoming day
Our minds are open wide (Eyes open wide)
And they canÂ´t force us, regardless of pain
To be like them... again!

All these hours were there waiting for you
But the time was running years ahead of you
ThereÂ´s no sign for salvation in the end
There is no gate to let you in
This is the beginning of a new day
So claim the time and lead the way
Heavenly light that now shines ahead
Is the proof of the new beginning and the end
