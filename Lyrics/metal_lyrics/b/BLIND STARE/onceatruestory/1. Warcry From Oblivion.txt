Wake up my friend it's time to go to the battle of our ancestors
your blood will shed but your death it is the price we have to pay.
The glory of our elder ones is the flame that burns in chest of ours
the light is blessed and shines ahead the enemies will die.

Of the knowledge of my (grand)father's side,
the sword is forged and it will be mine.
At the dawn I take my horse and pride
and to the victory I will ride.
