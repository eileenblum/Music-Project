The autumn leaves falling again
Through the eyes of a bird is this scenery seen
How the beauty turns into darkness
And how everything is lost, once again!

Years have passed since someone grew the flowers
Bare hate and madness are left, everything stays still

The place was designed for this
Once it was dwelling for a success
But now is a grave for a story such a sad to tell

She waited for him at the doorway so anxious
She loved him so deeply that she couldn't see
Finally he came and looked right into her eyes
And fired his gun straight into her heart

So crash the dreams of a young one
This life was gone to never return
She started into his eyes at the moment of her death
And that's the sight to haunt him forever

Deepness and darkness are lost in this coldness of hatred
Dream of the loved one has turned into a dream to last for eternity

Cold blooded murder and waste of a life was the only way
The time stood still and the silence covered the fire

Into the sleep of the darkness eternal her eyes are now closed
And she sleeps in a silence so cold!
That is the way for a someone
Who doesn't know the game he is in

Straight through the eyes of a bird is this seen
And soon falls the snow covering the memories!
The justice is just how it is seen
And the concept is good for nothing but to fade away

Into the sleep of the darkness eternal her eyes are now closed
And she sleeps in a silence so cold!
That is the way for a someone
Who doesn't know the game he is in

Straight through the eyes of a bird is this seen
And soon falls the snow covering the memories!
The justice is just how it is seen
And the concept is good for nothing but to fade away
