It all begins from this point and it's the point for all this to end
Every story has got an ending, but his is the one
That keeps going without it

I've been haunted by the impossible
And blinded by my own eyes
This is the end of me!
I pull the trigger to escape

I have followed the path and walked through the door
I have hated you so much, but now I know
It would be pointless forevermore
Countless nights spent on just pacing under the streetlights
This is the part of the play where the hero is sentenced to death

This is called my reality and it is just my dream
The hate so pure is the life of me and it is what I am
Every step towards you takes me towards to my end
The truth is now revealed and I am standing at the edge

I've been haunted by the impossible
And blinded by my own eyes
This is the end of me!
I pull the trigger to escape

Waking up every morning is like entering a dream
Sadness is just the gate to my own realm
Walking forward is no longer an option
I am no longer part of this world

This is called my reality and it is just my dream
The hate so pure is the life of me and it is what I am
Every step towards you takes me towards to my end
The truth is now revealed and I am standing at the edge

No difference has been found!
No difference that I made!
