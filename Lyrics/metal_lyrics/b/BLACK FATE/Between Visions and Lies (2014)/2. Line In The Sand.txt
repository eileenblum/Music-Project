Visions of another place
Iâve washed my sins away
a new day has come

March into the abyss
In my quest for harmony

I search so long for the silence,
For some peace of mind,
Night and day

âIn the shadows of timeâ

I seek a chance for redemption
My path for heaven lies ahead

Lines in the sand
Are guiding me into the land of tomorrow
Lines in the sand
Voices from the other side
Are calling me

So let the wind just carry me away
And guide me to my destination

Iâll spread my wings and fly 
Higher than the mountains, than the sky
Far beyond imagination

Lines in the sand
Guiding me in to the land of tomorrow
Lines in the sand
Echoes from the other side
Would you follow me
