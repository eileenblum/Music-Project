I suppose that youâre laughing
And youâre proud for what youâve done
But I tell you itâs nothing
Cause Iâve got a broken heart

Separate ways are better sometimes
Major reason for surprise
Nobody believe in your cries
And the fortune of your lies

Behind the mask
The hidden pleasure of your sins
Feel lost but safe

Kill me, push the knife inside me
Heal me with your hands
Touch me, let the blood drop stain
The white of winter snow

Cold is the killing hand
Father forgive me
I need you tonight

Iâm describing this condition
Every pain and every fear
I believe that your decision
Made the murder crystal clear

Behind the mask you hide
The pleasure of your sins
Feel lost but safe
In the glance of madness

Kill me, push the knife inside me
Heal me with your hands
Touch me, let the blood drop stain
The white of winter snow

Cold is the killing hand
Father save me from my sins
