Iâve thought that, that I could reach the stars
But now I am trapped between vision and lies

Was there a wrong decision
Or just another question why
Paralyzed before my twisted mind

Starring at my window I see a mirror grey
In the reflection of the glass
My life passes before my eyes, before myâ¦.

Haunted by my own game
The voice is calling
My spirit is falling into the flames
Aching for life

Watch my time fades away
The pain is growing
What if tomorrow will never come
Over and over Iâm losing myself

I claim no forgiveness
I am haunted by my guiltiness
Beneath the shadow of my doubts
No sanctuary through my misty mind

Starring at my window I see a mirror grey
In the reflection all my life passed by before my eyes

A game of illusions
Hear the voice is calling
My spirit is falling into the flames
Aching for life

Watch my time fades away
The pain is growing
What if tomorrow will never come
Over and over Iâm losing this game
