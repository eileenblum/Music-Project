Like a dead recall, Iâm crying out your name
With pain and guilt, ruins of a life

Like a shadow disappear, within a glimpse of light
Like a star that left alone, in the morning sky

Hiding in rooms of depression
Cutting myself into pieces
Gazing the sun but Iâm so afraid of the dawn

Watching myself in the mirror
Feeling so scared by my own reflection
Vivid dreams and nightmares hunting me

Into the night, stars falling like rain
Into the dark, I cry your name

Lost in this fatal deception
Hunted by parasite dreams
I am the shadow of nothing but still so afraid
