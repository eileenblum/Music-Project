Blinded by a vision trapped in ignorance
Walking dead the ruins of this world

Stand up now, feel the pain
Do something for your miserable life
Wake up now, siege the day
Donât waste your life away

In this endless war
There is nothing left to say
Fight for a reason
And live for another day
(In a state of conformity)

Crucify a martyr in the name of truth
Relentlessly devoted to the plan

Stand up now, feel the pain
Do something for your miserable life
Wake up now, siege the day
Donât waste your time away

In this endless war
There is nothing left to say
Fight for a reason
And live for another day

In this endless war
There is nothing we could gain
Fight for a vision
And live for some better days

A pale light, the essence of our faith
Carved in our hearts

A daybreak
A splendor in the dark
This is maybe, this is maybe our hope
