You take away my breath with a touch
Everything changes around me

You can unite my fragmented dreams
And turn my grey into colors

Falling for you

There is something in your eyes
That it makes me feel so right
Do you feel the magic in the air tonight

There is something in your heart
Like a shining star you came and saved me
From the dark tonight

You wipe away the sorrow from me
It feels like I am reborn

Calling your name

There is something in your eyes
That it makes me feel so right
Do you feel the magic in the air tonight

There is something in your heart
Like a shining star you came and saved me
From the dark tonight

Feeling alive
Take me away
Hold my hand
And wipe away my sorrow
