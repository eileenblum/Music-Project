Welcome to the age of a million dreams
Rapidly we're heading for the stars

Feel, feel the anguish in my eyes
As I whisper the last goodbye
The decision is my own
It's my life

I saw the reflection in your eyes
You know that the mirror never lies
No fear is shadowing my mind anymore

The sound of my heart
Has tear down the walls around
Our vision is still alive
There is no time to waste
There is nothing to be afraid
Cause we are the weight of the world
We are the world
We are the future

The fire burns under my skin
There is nothing that can stop this impulse
Don't walk away, don't hesitate
This is your last chance
I crave for the truth inside your eyes
You know that the mirror never lies
No fear is shadowing my mind anymore

The sound of my heart
Has tear down the walls around
Our vision is still alive
There is no time to waste
There is nothing to be afraid
Cause we are the weight of the world
We are the future
And you are the past

the sound of my heart
defies borders or lines,
my voice will arise forgotten beliefs
of another place and another time
so tear down the walls
and take your chance
cause we are the future
we are the weight of the world
