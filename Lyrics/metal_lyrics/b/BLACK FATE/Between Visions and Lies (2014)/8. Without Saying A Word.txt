Iâm sitting in this cage
Laying in my silence
Waiting for the time to pass by

Thinking of my past life
I open wide my eyes
Try to reach the stars
And hold them once again

All I want is just a spring in my life
To destroy the sorrow of my broken heart
Life is never what it seems, it is too short
And brakes your bones without saying a word
Saying a wordâ¦.

Youâve never thought of me
Youâve never try to see
The way I live my life
Without you by my side

You live in pretty dreams
I die in nightmare screams
I cannot sleep tonight
I miss your face light

Help me find my way
Donât walk away
Donât leave tonight
I need your face light
And every time that you are close to me
I want to make you see
That youâre the world for me
