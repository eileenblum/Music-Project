Take me away
I canât handle all this pain
Your absence hounds this game

Break away from this emptiness
Who is the winner or the loser?
I donât careâ¦

When youâre in my arms
Everything seems right
Like a vivid dream
Iâm diving to your stream

Like a rhyme of a false orchestra
Weâre rising again from the ashes
Love is our guide through the haze

Like a rhyme of a false orchestra
Traveling into this daydream
Love is the only way

Hold my hand
Lead me to innocence
Hypocrisy drowns my soul
