Violence all around
With rage they break the silence
Hate and fire, the perfect alibi
No conclusion for the world, thereâs no solution
Political imbalance, disorder and disgrace

The war has just begun
We are the rebellion, the revolution scream

Call of the wild
Reflection of the human instinct
Reason inside
The seed of rage is born inside you

Raise your eyes and stare
These walls theyâve build around us
Silent cover, irreal paradise
There is no future for the world thereâs no solution
No forgiveness, no surrender, no reclaim
