Enjoy every breathing, amusement's your life
And you may be the gambling man around
The people say you are a never-do-well
But you just think that they belong in hell

You've never run for your life
You took the easiest way out
From the role that you play
(Forever you Know!)

[Chorus]
Heaven can wait! - But now it's too late
Heaven can wait! - But now it's too late
Well, Heaven can wait...

But think a bit further, the older you grow
Won't you just your real face show?
You almost hide your mind behind a mask
And you forget your consciousness to ask

You've never run for your life
You took the easiest way out
From the role that you play
(Forever you Know!)

[Chorus]
Heaven can wait! - But now it's too late
Heaven can wait! - But now it's too late
Well, Heaven can wait...

[Chorus]
Heaven can wait! - But now it's too late
Heaven can wait! - But now it's too late
Well, Heaven can wait...
Well, heaven can wait!
