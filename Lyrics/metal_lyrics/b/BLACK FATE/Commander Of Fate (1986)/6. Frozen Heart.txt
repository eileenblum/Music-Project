See a young girl strolling down the dusty road
Looks so pretty but her heart is frozen cold
She has lost her friend - a love affair again
But there was no one who could win

And a lonely boy cries his old girl behind
He can't realize no reason and no rhyme
He doesn't know how he could win his lady back
Because she's a member of the pack

Where is the one who plays his melody
A god-blessed heart but still he cannot see
For looking forward needs a lot of time
And a golden heart for him to shine

This is the story so far without an end
He had no address for his love to send
He made up his mind for him results to find
But every answer in his mind

Hearts as cold as ice to satisfy themselves
Ain't no good things and they bring your heart to hell
They can hurt you twice, so many times again
And I know you cannot win

Where is the one who plays his melody
A god-blessed heart but still he cannot see
For looking forward needs a lot of time
And a golden heart for him to shine

So you must look ahead and you must believe in this
Or you'll be so fooled instead, so much that you miss
And the game goes on it always has its place in time
And the search goes on a golden heart to find
