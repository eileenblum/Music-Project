Golden light shines from the chandeliers
Kills the night that they will be satisfied
In their minds a fire is gleaming
Feels the fright as you can see them fall

And the mighty master who rules over time
Awaits the hour his victims to find

And the gambling fever will rage through the night
The knights of fortune are fighting their light

As a flash tears up the curtain
The gamblers dance and they will sing
Tonight's the one night - come feel the fever
This night, some special it is ill bring

Midnight - And they're on the run
Fight for fortune, the legend has begun
When the ball falls there's no way to run
Far from midnight

Midnight - midnight weakens your brain
Like a cold fire it's driving you insane
When the ball falls there 's no way to run
Far from Midnight

And a voice is coming from the edge of time
Feels their blood now and their faces shine

Gambling man, what do you pray for
Can't see clear, this fever is blinding
Don't know why the answer is hidden
Realize to ask is forbidden

And the mighty master who rules over time
Awaits the hour his victims to find

As the flash tears up the curtain
The gamblers dance and they will sing
Tonight's the one night, come feel the fever
This night some evil it will bring!

Midnight - And they're on the run
Fight for fortune, the legend has begun
When the ball falls there's no way to run
Far from midnight

Midnight - And they're on the run
Fight for fortune, the legend has begun
When the ball falls there's no way to run
Far from midnight

Midnight - midnight weakens your brain
Like a cold fire it's driving you insane
When the ball falls there 's no way to run
Far from Midnight

And a voice is coming from the edge of time
Far from Midnight!
