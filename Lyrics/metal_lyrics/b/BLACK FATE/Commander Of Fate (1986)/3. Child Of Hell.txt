Hunt the shade through the endless night
Cross a black cemetery
Do you remember the ancient spell
A wizard laid on your mind
But beware his view - don't look in his eyes
If you're listening to me I can give a sign to run away

Child of hell

Huge black gates with their wrought iron wings
Open at the horizon
The skies are tumbling as you smell the breeze
Now it's too late for warnings
You will pass one gate to the endless pain
You don't hear my warning, you don't look for the sign to
Run away.

Child of hell

Now you have to face hell's scenery
With its immortal pain
Henceforth till the end of the world.
And you're the servant of prince Lucifer
Everlasting harm is the lot you got
And in hell, you know, it is much too hot for runaways

Child of hell

Thunder lightning rain and hale
But your face did look so pale
The thunder's torturing your ears
Eyes are gleaming in the night
Beaming out unholy light
A sign that means your death is near
With your poisoned mind you cannot tell just right from wrong
Blinded eyes by burning fire that's moving on
All repentance comes too late, you can't stop by
When you take a look in his unholy eye

I can't blame you for your deeds
'Cause I know how strong the need
Is for your mind your heart your soul
But expect no mercy now
Because I can't tell you how
You can escape the devil's hand

Don't you see your fate is sealed there's no return
From hell
That the seed of evil changed your mind with a
Mighty spell
You're his faithful servant in every case an order came
Till I clean your heart by the power of the holy fire
