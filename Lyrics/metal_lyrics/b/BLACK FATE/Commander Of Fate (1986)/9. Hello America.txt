Another rainy day in Europe
Isn't just the thing to calm me down
And I don't want to stay no more

I only want to drive to Frankfurt
Go up the gangway to the metal bird
Which takes me many miles from home

The strangest feeling that I've ever known
Rushing up and down my back
It is just a strange emotion
And the only healing potion
Is a journey to the stars

Stars and stripes - hello America
Glad to see you in seven weeks
I love you all here in America
In Anchorage or in Miami

Now it's time and the jet is pushing
As the thrust will move your back into the seat
While you will leave your home behind

Through the windows you see the clouds fly
And your fears and problems turned so empty now
The ocean is so great and wide

The strongest feeling that I've ever known
Rushing up and down my back
It is just a strange emotion
And the only healing potion
Is a journey to the stars

Stars and stripes - hello America
Glad to see you in seven weeks
I love you all here in America
In Anchorage or in Miami

To the west lies the red horizon
And the skyline appears in outlines now
In the distance you see the runway lights

As you walk downstairs the gangway
As your feet will touch united ground
You're finally be satisfied

The strongest feeling that I've ever known
Rushing up and down my back
It is just a strange emotion
And the only healing potion
Is a journey to the stars

Stars and stripes - hello America
Glad to see you in seven weeks
I love you all here in America
In Anchorage or in Miami
