You rock the city
One perfect release
If you don't know, how about it
I'm anyway your thief

You glorify the weapons
To kill your enemies
But what you cannot know about it
Why can't you trust in me

Expect no easy life
It's not a feast
Expect no answer now
Because you're too blinded to see

You start the game once
The beast is back in town
But if you do not know where hell is
Well hell is here in town

You starve with every footstep
A hunger kills your soul
Some powerful destruction baby
Won't help you anymore

Expect no easy life
It's not a feast
Expect no answer now
Because you're too blinded to see

Warchild - How can you lied your answer now?
Warchild - All this destruction won't give you no crown
Warchild - You must help yourself at last
Warchild - Oh please baby, come on, baby, come on get you

The earth is like a battlefield
The sky is like a flame
And you are giving gas to that fire
That's all in all your shame

You won't stop the murder
But you have got the key
To set an end to all that killing
Oh please look out and see

Expect no easy life
It's not a feast
Expect no answer now
Because you're too blinded to see

Warchild - You must find an answer now
Warchild - 'cause the destruction kills your soul
Warchild - You must help yourself at last
Warchild - 'cause you've been guilty in the past

And the flames came down with fire
And they're calling you a liar
But there's no place where you can hide
And they knock you out with dynamite

Warchild - you must find an answer now
Warchild - because the destruction kills your soul
Warchild - you musts help yourself at last
Warchild - because you've been guilty in the past

And the flame comes down with fire
And they're calling you a liar
But there's no place where you can hide
And they knock you out with dynamite

And the flame comes down with fire
And they're calling you a liar
But there's no place where you can hide
And they knock you out with dynamite

Warchild - You must get the answer now
Warchild - Or the destruction kills your soul
Warchild - You must help yourself at last
Warchild - Please look out and beware

Watching out!
