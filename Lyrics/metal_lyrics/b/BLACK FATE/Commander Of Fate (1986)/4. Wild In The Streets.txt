Fighting just a good fight and you will break the steel
So if you gonna rock me, the altar of rock is where you kneel
the place where you kneel.

Shake at every footstep, the sun will shine on you
You try to catch the sunlight and soon you know the truth
so you know the truth

You've been looking for a free life
The youth is rushing through your veins
As you're taking just a low ride
Now they see you running

Wild in the streets - You ain't no gambler
Wild in the streets - You search no answer
Wild in the streets - You are no gambler

Fighting just a good fight as you had met the gang
Tell me what you fight for, when will it have an end
Will it have an end

Isn't it a story, you listen to every day
And isn't it the same price that everybody pays
That's paid every day

You've been looking for a free life
The youth is rushing through your veins
As you're taking just a low ride
Now they see you running

[Chorus]
Wild in the streets - You ain't no gambler
Wild in the streets - You search no answer
Wild in the streets - You ain't no gambler

Wild in the streets - You ain't no gambler
Wild in the streets - You search no answer
Wild in the streets - You ain't no gambler
Wild in the streets - You ain't no gambler
Wild in the streets.
