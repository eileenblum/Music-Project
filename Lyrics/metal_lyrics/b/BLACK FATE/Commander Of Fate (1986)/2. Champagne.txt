They are like riders in raging storm
Like ancient sailors fighting round at Cape Hoorn
They search the danger that's the sense of their lives
Wake up they're coming just with overdrive.

You must believe in darkness
Or it rapes your life away
Got to trust in darkness
Or it rapes your friends away
It will let you down
Turns your neck around
Shows no mercy to
The one who will reject its old domain

[Chorus]
Champagne! (Believe in darkness)
Champagne! (Believe in darkness)

Now it is morning and you take a deep breath
And you're just feeling as if you're sentenced to death
But what a pity that you're living still
So now it's time for something to kill

You must believe in darkness
Or it rapes your life away
Got to trust in darkness
Or it rapes your mind away
It will let you down
Turns your neck around
Shows no mercy to
The one who will reject its old domain

[Chorus]
Champagne! (Will be your nightmare)
Champagne! (Will be your nightmare)

It will bring you down
turns your neck around

Shows no mercy to
The one who will reject its old domain

[Chorus]
Champagne! (Will be your nightmare)
Champagne! (Will be your nightmare)

We are like riders in a raging storm
like ancient sailors fighting round at Cape Hoorn
We search the danger if we're playing here
We'd like to thank you for your grateful cheers

You must believe in darkness
Or it rapes your life away
Got to trust in darkness
Or it rapes your mind away

It will let you down
Turns your neck around
Shows no mercy to
The one who will reject its old domain.

[Chorus]
Champagne! (Will be your nightmare)
Champagne! (Will be your nightmare)
