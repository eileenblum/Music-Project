Face a shadow
Slices the night
When the legend's begun
Feel the power
Feel the fright
When the damage is done

She said, hey, to me
Babe take me for some action
You are like me
We both can reach our dream

Hot and pretty

And her body
Burns like hell
Like flashing rays of the sun
And her eyes
A magic spell
Enchanted me again

She said, hey, to me
Babe take me for some action
You are like me
We both can reach our dream
