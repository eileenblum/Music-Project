for days ive hiden away from this curse that weakens me
tears down my every dream
withering away i watch as you crawl through my mind
tearing down all thats left
your beauty lies inside buried beneath a mask
that you wear only to hide your true emotions
your self pity that you place upon the mind of the innocent
only digs you deeper down in the ground where you'l lay for this eternity
ill walk the night that leads me forth to my destiny
and you will rot as u watch me burning these gallows
where ill hang your head
And dance around the flames
