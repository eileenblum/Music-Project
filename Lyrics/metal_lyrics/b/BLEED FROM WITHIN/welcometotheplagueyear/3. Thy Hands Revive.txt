Motion in our movement
Circulates the blood round our veins
Our bodies colide as the glass empties
Suddenly you fell as if youve known her for years
You run your ice cold hand around my neck
And you breathe gently in my ear
Would have been easier placing your noose around my neck.

Lips cold as ice breathe's the coldest air in the night
Frozen upon eternal lust ill break the ice tonight
So close your eyes and it all seems so right until
I felt the ground shake beneath me
This is the way out take my hand ill lead you to my domain
Where we shall coress the beauty in these words
