This night is filled with promise
the smell of pleasure fills the air
only the silent side from the corner of the room
I can hear above all the voices

Never did I think my skin would become numb
With the grasp of your frozen hand
This is our legacy

Sipping on this poison
These lights begin to brighten
Spinning round my head as I descend to the floor
Surrounded by one hundred glaring eyes
Screaming at the top of our lungs
We're all fucked

It's getting hard to breathe
and I know this night will never end
Stumbling through the swarm of bodies

This was never meant to end like this
My innocence is gone, my head is in the game
What the fuck is wrong with me?!
Sinking into the sheets, lost in lust
This is what I need, or so I thought

Adrenaline is rushing so fast through my veins
I am lifting off the ground

My vision blurs, my mind goes blank, and then
I wake in a room I have never seen in my life.
