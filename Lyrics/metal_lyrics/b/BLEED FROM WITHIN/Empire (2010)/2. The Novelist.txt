This was just the beginning
It was on till the end
Before you begin to criticize us

All our blood, sweat and tears
Laid out on the table, for your judgment
If you only knew how much this meant to us
You would reconsider

Reconsider
Your choice of words
Reconsider
Your choice of words

This will be a new chapter for us
And I am the novelist, The novelist
My words will bend and break you

I can't do this, night after night after night
I cant remember the last time, this was not on my mind
Inspired by the sound of the voices in the background, or even...
The wind against my skin
Yeah

These lies are filled
With greed and hatred
These lights that guide us are truly damning
Am I left here all alone
Damning
Am I left here all alone

This will be a new chapter for us
And I am the novelist, The novelist
My words will bend and break you

I can't do this, night after night after night
I cant remember the last time, this was not on my mind
Inspired by the sound of the voices in the background, or even,
The wind against my skin
Against my skin

So fixated
Everyone seems so blinded by the light
Everyone needs to wake the fuck up
So fixated
Everyone seems so blinded by the light
Everyone needs to wake the fuck up
And have a mind of your own

And now you're broke
You're wall's invaded
And my words surround you
You, you can know
Begin to criticize
Put aside.... Put aside.
