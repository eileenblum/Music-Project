If this was my last day on earth
Would you even care
would anyone notice
Have I made an impact on your life
What would it matter to you if I was gone

This congress comes together
to say their final farewell
With these words
I have to make a statement
It's not every day you are made to realize
what you have in front of you

My wounds are healing
But this bitter taste will never leave my mouth
The fury, this rage that's built up inside of me

It's all flooding out
I haven't lost everything
But I don't feel anything

The thought of losing it all will haunt me
I am choking on these words
the last words you ever spoke
The hardest part is trying to forget
Although I will never forgive
for the way you were taken from me

I am filled with reason to seek revenge
For I am filled with hatred

For I am filled with hatred
My thoughts are sickening
mindless rage
Flooding out of me

This bitter taste will never leave my mouth
The fury, this rage that's built up inside of me

It's all flooding out
I haven't lost everything
But I don't feel anything
