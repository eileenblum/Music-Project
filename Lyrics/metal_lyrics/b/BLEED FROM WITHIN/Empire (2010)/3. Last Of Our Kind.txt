It's time to make
A sacrifice I walk the earth
With visions of the end

Of the end
Civilization, grows out of hand
As streets become crammed
By day to day (to day, to day) life

If you take the time to read between the lines
There's more to this story than meets the eye
The signs are all around you
You just have (just have) to open your fucking eyes

The end
Civilization, grows out of hand
As streets become crammed
By day to day (to day, to day) life

If you take the time to read between the lines
There's more to this story than meets the eye
The signs are all around you
You just have (just have) to open your fucking eyes

Can you see right through me
I feel like i am never there, like a fucking ghost
Do you feel betrayed
Do you feel like a shadow in the bigger
Picture

Do you feel bigger

We are overcrowded by our disgrace
Indignity, Indignity, Indignity?
Our fellow man will be the death of us
There isn't a light at the end of this tunnel
We have reached the end of the road

And angel's voice won't be there to save you

Wont be there to save you
Betrayal, Betrayal, Betrayal
Will be your last words
Betrayal will be
Betrayal will be
Your last words
