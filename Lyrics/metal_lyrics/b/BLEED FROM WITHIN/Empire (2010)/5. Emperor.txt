I see you losing sleep for days
this isn't worth all this mess
Un proud to see you this way
Pulling yourself down
Down further into this hole
that is surrounding you

This is just a milestone for you
Through your whole life
times change, people grow apart
It's something you have to learn to understand

Like glass we can be fragile
but sharp when we are broken
But these pieces will soon mend with time
Let this go set yourself free

You're throwing everything away
get it together

Suffer for everything you believe in
Don't stop pushing and pushing
Don't stop fighting for this opportunity
As it could be your last

Always remember what's important
As we can break like glass
