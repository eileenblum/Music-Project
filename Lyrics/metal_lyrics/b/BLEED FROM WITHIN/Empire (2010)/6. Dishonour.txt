I stand out in the cold for hours
Waiting to be struck down
I have never cursed someone's name so many times
Even if it is just a myth
All I want is to be brought to you

I feel you watching over me
Inside it kills
The sound of your voice echoes in my head
From time to time I close my eyes
I have to live with this for the rest of my life

Every hour drags out
Every sunrise seems so dull
It's like every walking moment without you here

Didn't you hear me screaming
No from the top of my lungs
Didn't you hear that saddened sigh

That night of my life
You will regret for the rest of yours
I will see this fucking through
You have ruined everything I have ever lived for

I want to see this ground shake
I want to see this earth open up and
Swallow every last one of us
To prove to me there is no fucking god.
