Countless times
I see the figure in my head
The only hope that this cannot be the end

Have I forsaken you
Or have I forsaken myself
What have we got to lose

Someone once told me
if you really believe in something
Then you have to see it through to the very end

I am left to pick up the pieces
of everything we had and now
There's one piece missing
so I am complete
My world has been torn apart
pulling me down to my knees
I am gripping on
pulling myself back
rebuilding the foundations of my life

You will never understand this situation
Until you are on your knees
Praying for a miracle
That will not just fall from the sky

My final affliction
