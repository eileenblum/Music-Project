Bow down before your god
The hand that raised you and turned you into a man
You're monument to bold you up when you are down

The one who told you were the best son
When really she meant
You're a worthless piece of shit
I really don't believe you could ever betray this

All I know is you have this figure to look up to
Can you imagine this could all be taken
From you in the blink of an eye
Stripped from under your nose
And set free into the night
And you're left to make your own choices
No one to turn to
Never to see their face again

How would that make you feel
Would you want to end it all just to be with them again
For nothing else in your sad, pathetic,
Worthless life could ever compare
Would you shy from the entire human race

Welcome to my world
