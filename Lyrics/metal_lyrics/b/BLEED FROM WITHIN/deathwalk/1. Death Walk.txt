Never knew my life was worth this
I wear my skin as a disguise
We will not be the ones living in fear of everything

There's no escape
A coward I promise I'll break
Make no mistake
You fall to your knees, a disgrace

Join us, this is the deathwalk
Raise hell if you're with us
We bow to no one
We suffer no more

Join us, this is the deathwalk
Raise hell if you're with us
We bow to no one
We suffer no more

To succeed is to break away
Betrayed let astray
We will not be the ones living in fear of everything
There's no escape

Deeper and deeper you rot to the bone
We will continue to fight and you'll die alone

Ice cold, hands are shaking
Your world is fucked and it's mine for the taking

Join us, this is the deathwalk
Raise hell if you're with us
We bow to no one
We suffer no more

Join us, this is the deathwalk
Raise hell if you're with us
We bow to no one
We suffer no more

[Solo]

There's no escape
A coward I promise I'll break
There's no escape
Make no mistake
You fall to your knees, a disgrace

I'm the voice you'll hear before your eyes close

Join us, this is the deathwalk
Raise hell if you're with us
We bow to no one
We suffer no more

Join us, this is the deathwalk
Join us, this is the deathwalk
