Let me breathe
Let me pick myself up from my knees
Itâs time to face what I never could
I refuse, I refuse
The voice of contempt lies heavy on my ears
I'm falling further away

I rest my head on broken hands
This figure tells a story that no one can understand (understand)
Let me breathe, let me breathe

Youâre feeding on my misery, argh
Draining every last piece of me
I'm getting the feeling your knife is in my back
And you are twisting and twisting my words you use to attack

Nothing is what you see in me
I'm screaming at the world to believe in me
Silence them all
I wonât be the one to catch you when you fall
Argh

Let me pick myself up from my knees
Itâs time to face what I never could
I refuse, I refuse
Youâre feeding on my misery

Our voices are silent but our words are filled with violence
You continue to choke on the lies you speak
We silence them all

Our voices are silent but our words are filled with violence
You continue to choke on the lies you speak
We silence them all

Nothing is what you see in me
I'm screaming at the world to believe in me
Silence them all
I wonât be the one to catch you when you fucking fall

Silence them all
We silence them
