Digging with my hands till they bleed on the open road
A path to self destruction
Just a passionate degenerate with shattered glass for eyes

Easy to forget the mistakes I made
A weakness of mind that the nectar revives
Giving me the confidence
Bring me to life, to smite my kind
A belligerent fool with a death wish
Running with the chance of a moment past
Forget the sentence, hang me now

No one can save us, we'll find a way
Turn the page, let me hear you say

Repent, it's a revolution
Believe in me
The world I've seen is filled with greed
They say there's nothing in the after life
Repent, it's a revolution
To set me free
The world I've seen is not for me
No, there is glory in the after life

No fucking sympathy
The promise of a new beginning surrounded me
I threw my body in the river
Then the sinner within me watched it drown

This time I've crossed the line
Self destructive, in decline
My words were not my vow
I need actions, I need them now

In hell all saints will sin
Patience is wearing thin
Each day we live in doubt
We need actions, we need them now

This time I've crossed the line
Self destructive, in decline
My words were not my vow
We need actions, we need them now
