Back and forth in the wrong direction
Without any one of you
There would be none of us
We said we won't let you down

That's why we're still here
Because of you we still have a reason
For believing
In ourselves

We said, we said
Nothing would ever change
It was nothing that could break us
But nothing stays the same
We owe our lives to you
'Cause life can be forgiving when you're living for yourself
It feels like I'm on the right path for a change

We owe it all to you
So throw your fists in the air if we're on the same page
(Hey, hey, hey)
Scream as loud as you can if you can't feel a thing
I feel nothing without you

That's why we're still here
Because of you we still have a reason
For believing
In ourselves

We said these were the dark days of our lives
But you shine a light on me
To guide me through the dark
We owe our lives to you
'Cause life can be forgiving when you're living for yourself
It feels like I'm on the right path for a change

How can you say this is not for me
Let me live life the way I want it to be
If only you could see this through my eyes

We owe it all to you
So throw your fists in the air if we're on the same page
(Hey, hey, hey)
Scream as loud as you can if you can't feel a thing

So throw your fists in the air if we're on the same page
(Hey, hey, hey)
Scream as loud as you can if you can't feel a thing
I feel nothing without you

Scream as loud as you can

Scream as loud as you can
But don't turn away
Giving up on everything is easier than you think
I'll never turn my back on you

You have become our legacy
You're the light that guides us through the dark days
(The dark days)
You gave us hope we thought it couldn't be saved
(We thought it couldn't be saved)
You're the light that guides us through the dark days
(The dark days)
You gave us hope we thought it couldn't be saved
(We thought it couldn't be saved)
