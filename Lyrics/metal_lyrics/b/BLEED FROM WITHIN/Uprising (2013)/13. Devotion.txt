I see the young
Lose their way
Lost in a world of ignorance
Led astray
Led astray by the face of the hour

You consume it all
It's forcing you to break
In the light of this fire we started
We slowly fade away

Outlive the heroes
You named and shamed
We outlived the heroes
You named and shamed

Pictures black, a poisoned page
Forgive and replace
Hold your breath
Do you still hold your head high
With our name
Scribed across your chest?

Take your eyes
And watch me from afar
A presence lost
Can never be found

Endless memories of nothing at all
(Endless memories of nothing at all)
Pick myself up off the floor
These are the moments we live for

How did you see?
(How did you see?)
How did you know?
(How did you know?)
The fire burns brighter the deeper you go
Devotion

In the face of a stranger
Scratching at the surface of something much greater
Devotion
