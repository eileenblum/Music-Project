Don't let yourself be silenced
If this means more to you
Then you're letting yourself be left out in the dark
I often wonder, were you too blind to see?
It's what we believe

Just let me say the words I'm not supposed to say
I'd spit in your face if you weren't facing away
(Oh) Don't turn your back stop running way
It's just a lie for you to live another day
To live another day

Open the eyes inside of yourself
Nothing, no one, nowhere
You've lost it all before
And you can lose it again

It's not the same
It's not the same without a sacrifice

What gives you the right
To fight for something you have wounded?
Indulgence is the weakness of others
You can't take what you know nothing about

You're like a leech
Draining the life out of me
You're showing
You're bleeding
How typical of you

Open the eyes inside of yourself
Nothing, no one, nowhere

Nothing, no one, nowhere
You've lost it all before
And you can lose it again

It's not the same
It's not the same without a sacrifice

This is something that you can't take for yourself
You've lied your way through every mess that you've made
You're like a leech
Draining the life out of me
You'll never change
You'll always stay the same
