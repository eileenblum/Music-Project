We build ourselves up to fall
When we think we are close
We have nothing to hold
A disgrace to yourself
Separation can now begin

Your world is dying, you're dying for it
But I'm not done killing for this
Your world is dying and you're dying for it
But I'm not done killing for this

You are the last thing we need
When you lose the grip

We will rise up to our feet
There's nothing holding us back
We made our mistakes
For wanting what you never had

It was all a lie

You deny our right, and you repeat
How can you think this is the right thing to do
Your world is dying and you're dying for it
But I'm not done killing for this

You know what you are (And what it takes)
You have to let go
You have to let go
You can't stop them like you stopped us from finding ourselves

You talk the talk but you can't walk the walk
I wanna believe you're everything you say that you're not
You've sunk your teeth in for too long
(You've sunk your teeth in for too long)
You have to accept it's our time to move on

You've sunk your teeth in for far too fucking long

The world will unfold like it's supposed to
and you'll have nothing, no one to turn to

You are the last thing we need
When you lose the grip

We will rise up to our feet
There's nothing holding us back
We made our mistakes
For wanting what you never had

We build ourselves up to fall
When we think we are close
We have nothing to hold
A disgrace to yourself
Separation has now begun

You've sunk your teeth in for far too long
You have to accept it's our time to move on
