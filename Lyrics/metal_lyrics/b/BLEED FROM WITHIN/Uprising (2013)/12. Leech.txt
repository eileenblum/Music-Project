You beg and you borrow

Sit the fuck down I'm not done with you yet
You give and you take and you swallow regret
Call me a failure when I am the one still standing

It feels like the end of the road
You question the purpose but you'll never know
You let it slip a long time ago

It's what you made
When you made a mess of yourself
It's what you take
When you can't give nothing in return

We are the lost, we are the found
Together we cannot be bound
We have a voice
Let it be heard

Sit the fuck down I'm not through with you yet
I give and I give, I can't do this anymore
Tell me, do you
Feel like the victim?

I need your attention
Don't say a word
Don't open your mouth
Just hear me out
You're searching for something you had all along
Separate
See it in you to let go
Forget and replace what you know
I am not a failure

We are the lost, we are the found
Together we cannot be bound
We have a voice
Let it be heard
(Let it be heard)

We are the ones still standing
Here for a reason, we shall not be moved
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)

[Solo â Nolly]

We are the lost and the found

We are not the same
It's all very different
In the beginning
We are not the same
If it meant nothing to you
It meant nothing to me
