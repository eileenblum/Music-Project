Aah yeah

Let's make this a night to remember
Living like there is no tomorrow
Everyone you touch will fade away
They will never be the same

Do you believe in me?
Do you think you have a future on your knees?
Beg for me
Still we try and we try but little do we know we're wasting time
Get on your knees and beg for mercy
Reckless is the way we'll be tonight
Nothing can stop us now
No, nothing can stop me

Broken
I thought you wanted to change the world
I thought that you meant every word
In this 'til the end
We're in this 'til the end
I pity you for not being here
Do you think I envy you?
Do you think I envy you?
It's so obvious
You're living a fucking lie
You're trembling
You'll never see this through

But you were wrong
You were too quick to point the finger
With my eyes sealed shut
You're giving up
You're giving in to this

You will never get to see this again
If it felt right i'd understand
I'd understand

We're all fucked again
Only to numb the pain
Every night ends up the same
We're all fucked again
Giving up, giving in
It's all or nothing
Are you in this 'til the end?

This must be hell
Another night alone
This must be hell
What does the future hold?
Another night alone
I can't deny you of your place
You chose to walk away
Now I see the sadness in you

I pity you for not being here
Do you think I envy you?
Do you think I envy you?
It's so obvious
You're living a fucking lie
Living a fucking lie

Broken
I thought you wanted to change the world
I thought that you meant every word
In this 'til the end

We're in this 'til the end
