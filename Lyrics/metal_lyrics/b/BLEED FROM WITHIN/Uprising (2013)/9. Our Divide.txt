Some were meant to suffer
Some were meant to live their lives like kings
You seperate society
Dividing our name

We see in each other
What we don't see in ourselves
Define the words you speak
These words are never like they're told
There is no hope
These words are never like they're told

I can't seem to escape
You're everywhere I look (look, look)
There is no hope
You're the future strain of this addictive disease
Sinking in red eyes they gaze
It's what defines you

Some were meant to suffer
Some were meant to live their lives like kings
Live their lives like kings

You'll never know the feeling of achieving
What's in your hands
It's our divide

We watch our nation fall before our eyes
We are blind to everything but the paper that we burn
We watch our nation fall before our eyes

Your hands are tied from the face of the truth
We are blind to everything but the paper that we burn
It's our divide

To have and to hold
Nothing but empty hands
A life to mislead
And now we see in each other
What we don't see in ourselves
To have and to hold

Some were meant to suffer
Some were meant to live their lives like kings
Live their lives like kings

You'll never know the feeling of achieving
What's in your hands
