Escape yourself
Let chaos surround us
Worship is weakness

Open your eyes
This is the price we pay for our mistakes
A sense of desperation
A direction to point the blame

Wait, was it something that I said?
Now I'm seeing red
Do you find it hard to live with yourself?

Bitter to the bone
Made of nothing but stone

Don't take from me
What you did not achieve
These words that you speak
Were never yours to believe
Escape yourself and see
Your words are meaningless to me

Escape yourself
Let chaos surround us
I see worship as weakness

We pay for our mistakes
Look back and find the place in time
Embrace the shame
Only yourself to blame

Desperation, it's taking hold
It was a life led alone

We live
In fear of no one
We live
To see the light from the sun

To sin is to feel alive
Can't you see what we've done
The truth will come to light a path
And show that life has just begun

[Solo â Martyn]

Don't take from me
What you did not achieve
These words that you speak
Were never yours to believe
Escape yourself

You dismiss everything you know nothing about
Your words mean nothing, there's no proof
It's just an easy way out
Escape yourself and see
Your words are meaningless

Escape yourself
Let chaos surround us
I see worship as weakness
