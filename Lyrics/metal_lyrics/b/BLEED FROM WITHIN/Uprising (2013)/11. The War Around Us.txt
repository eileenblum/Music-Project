You've laid this deathbed for yourself
Giving up on everything that never gave in to you
I thought you would be through with this life

You set a bad example for our youth
One day they will carry us
One day they will follow in your footsteps
Don't give them this life

You set a bad example for our youth
I'm not afraid of the war around us
I'm more afraid of the storm inside you
Living every day like it's your last
You'll find these are the days that make you believe

Not in a a god but in yourself
Not in a a god but in yourself
But you've left yourself behind
When will you see (the light in) the light in yourself

We've come too far to give up
And when we're on the right path to change it
Weight of the world on your shoulders
Is in your hands (Fuck)

We've been led to believe that you're a fucking mistake
You're everything we're not supposed to be (I'm not afraid)

I'm not afraid of the war around us
I'm more afraid of the storm inside you
Living every day like it's your last
You'll find these are the days that make you believe

Not in a a god but in yourself
Not in a a god
Not in a a god but in yourself

There once lay innocence behind those crooked eyes
You've laid this deathbed for yourself
Giving up on everything
That never gave in to you
