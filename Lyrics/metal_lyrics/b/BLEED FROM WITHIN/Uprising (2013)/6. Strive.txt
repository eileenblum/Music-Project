You only have yourself to blame
You must be ashamed (ashamed)
Your hands don't hold the future

(This is a new beginning)
It just got personal
We are the ones with the empty hands
Hoping for a chance
We grasp onto every word
A promise of life we never had

Have faith in yourself
We've come too far to let this go
You're not in control
Our future's out of your hands

We strive
To feel alive
And overcome your lies
We stand together as one
To watch you come undone
When your time is up
You'll be left alone

You'll be left alone
With no one to take the fall, with everything to fear
No matter what you say, you'll never be sincere
I long for the day that you disappear

You only have yourself to blame
You must be ashamed (ashamed)
Your hands don't hold the future

Do you know the person you've become?
Did you think
We were gonna give up easily?

Do you think we're gonna live
With the hand we've been dealt?
Do you think we're gonna live
With the hand we've been dealt?

But still we try and we try
But we never succeed
Like every time I see your face
I turn away
Every time I try, every time I fail
Every time we try, every time we...
Strive
To feel alive
And overcome your lies
We stand together as one
To watch you come undone
