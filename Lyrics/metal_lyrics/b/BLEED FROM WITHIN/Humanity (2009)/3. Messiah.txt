A withered messiah, deaf to the prayer.
What have the faithful come to expect?
Redemption expectant
And this pledge of serenity.

What becomes of the father who watched this demise?
Demise!

Who watched this demise

Your house stays tranquil,
Yet this world has been ravaged!

And justify your charity by means of some divine illustration!

I have seen your work,
This sadistic work
That has bent the minds of millions.
Our men with no end to their toil,
Not content with their wealth

We will gather here today
For the falling of a shattered belief.

By the words of your peasants,
I will have my revenge!
I rake and stake on your lies your fails
Want to have no pleasure and fall!

All mans efforts are for his mouth,
Yet his appetite is never satisfied.
All mans efforts are for his mouth,
Yet his appetite is never satisfied

I have seen your work,
This sadistic work
That has bent the minds of millions.
Our men with no end to their toil,
Not content with their wealth

What advantage has a wise man over a fool?
A wind that never blows!
A wind that never blows!

I will have my revenge!
I will have my revenge!

My revenge!
