Where do i begin to explain this mess
Everything i touch everything i see
reminds me of you

and the walls begin to blur as your sweet scent fills my
lungs like your still in the air.
Forced smiles caress my face
sing into my
ear cut out the hollow wailing within these walls.

I am angry at the world For
making me feel so betrayed my heart begins to sink.
Bound to the ground my
dearest shall lay until the end of eternity.
This crushing feeling of
emptyness unleashed upon me

i see this tragedy blinded by bloodshot
eyes.
awaken me from this hell,
a lonely man i see hollow, broken clutching
to the memories

ts only getting worse as he cries himself to sleep
as the
sheets absorb the tears
im counting the days until we meet again.
