These painful screams in the night
Were not a part of my dreams
Behind this mask of lies
Stands a saddened shadow in the figure of a man,
These howls fill these walls as cracks appear
Bleeding despair
Only suffering remains
In this hollow room,
All hope is gone
And i awake to shades of grey
A divine cold breeze
Crawls the air and fills our lungs with anticipation
A failure i feel as i embrace your words.
Behind this mask of lies
Stands a saddened shadow in the figure of a man,
These howls fill these walls as cracks appear
Bleeding despair .
Visions of the fallen i close my eyes
Only to see my own reflection
An unfamiliar form,
From my mind i liberate these thoughts and set them free into the night
A failure i feel as i embrace your words
I feel your presence my only guiding light
Humanity!!!
Humanity!!
Humanity!
