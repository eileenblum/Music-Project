He knows all the secrets
He's flown, all the nooks
He's carried many messages
He's passed, all obstacles.
He knows the sun, also the moon
He knows the seas, the mainlands
He knows the ice, as so water
He knows the fire, as smoke.

The wind so stormy as gentle
The wind, warm and icy
The wind allknowing
The mysterious wind.

I love the wind whispering to meâ¦
I love the wind, whispering to meâ¦
I love the wind, whispering, to meâ¦
