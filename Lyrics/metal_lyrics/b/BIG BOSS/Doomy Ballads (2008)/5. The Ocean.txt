They, hate you and love you...
But in your depths, the life was born...
Tears are briny, as your water
As your water, was it your gift?... was it your gift?

You, create and destroy...
Stroke and drops, you know all legends
You love your children, you sworn your enemies
You have a soul - You are the ocean...
You are the ocean!
