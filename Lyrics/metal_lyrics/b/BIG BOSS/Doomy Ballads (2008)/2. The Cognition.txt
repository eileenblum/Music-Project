One day death, will surprise you
And you discover, you didnât live!
Universe, sooth, soothes your mind
On astral pillow, (of) eternal darkness
Nostalgic, solitude, of your ancestors
And their, traces, in the dust of eons.

Your soul, is empty - is empty cries
Like an open grave, grave in desert
And rocks, turn to dust...

Quo Vadisâ¦?
