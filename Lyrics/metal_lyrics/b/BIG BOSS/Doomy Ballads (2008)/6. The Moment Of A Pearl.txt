Outside the eye, into the nothingness of existence
Flows the moment, of pearl
That it wanted, to dance, dance with me
Upon the bones, (of) scabby dogs
Gush of slime, has startled the birds
Those messengers from oblivion of nothingness.

So I am being pulled about by the demon of orgasm
Not towards life, towards death.

Towards doom, towards the end
Towards rottenness, towards old whore...
...towards needless singings...

When trailing through the, through the wasteland
Dust of futility blind your eye
And you alone, joined with noone and nowhere
Youâre sinking into filth existence of dung, and plague
Gush of slime has startled the birds
Those messengers from oblivion of nothingness...
So I am being pulled about by the demon of orgasm
Not towards life, towards death...

Only waste, and dead, seedâ¦
