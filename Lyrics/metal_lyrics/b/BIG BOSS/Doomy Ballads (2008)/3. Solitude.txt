From deep... source of darkness...
Spring... black sap...

Iâm crying, into the pain
Into the pain, of solitude.

Dark red wheels crush
Every flash of my mind...

Iâm crying into the pain
Into the pain of solitude.

King crimson smiles
To my eternal curse
Iâm crying into the pain
Into the pain of solitude.

Solitudeâ¦

The black cloudâ¦
