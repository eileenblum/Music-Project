Who can boast, about the knowledge of Life
Who can boast, about the knowledge of Truth
Who can boast, about the knowledge of Death
Who can boast, about the knowledge of Lie?

Just tears of ages, running down, the cheek of existence
Can sing a song, of knowledge...
Just tears of the ages, running down...

Who can boast, about the knowledge of Love
Who can boast, about the knowledge of Hate
Who can boast, about the knowledge of Defy
Who can boast, about the knowledge of Fear?

Just tears of the ages, running down, the cheek of existence
Can sing a song of knowledge...
Just tears of the ages, running down...
