That day it happens and cloud fulfiled...
With hate of innocent victims
And mighty windstorm uprised!
Brought message of downfall
People muted with the heart in gorge!

Only, child's voice sounded above, the scenery
Woeful cry, woeful cry, like from nowhere.
And voice, of the deads, above the sea...above the sea
Plateau but nothing else, not a sound.

A forrest, of many deaths, whisper with the bones..
As it were taking, leave of everyone.
Lovers, lovers, in eternal embrace
Remain the symbol, remain the symbol, of a doom.

Suddenly, beyond a deep, beyond a deep thunder
Screams, laughter, tinkle and calmâ¦

That's just death, walking from the underworld
With alive... no mercy, no mercy... it will have.

Lovers... lovers... lovers... in eternal, eternal, embrace.
