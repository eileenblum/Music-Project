You're killing the night with golden
knife getting in to our throuats and souls
I'M ALONE!
With sounds of panic voice
with sounds of evil war
I'M ALONE!
I see the shadow in arms of death
and I heare the storm everything
will be wet
I'M ALONE!
Silent blood run down
swallow up all the town
I'M ALONE!
