Too much confusion had forced me to rest
Burning my eyes and stabbing my chest
Guilt and response is a pain in my neck
Deepest depression had made me a wreck

No more prospects for me to take

Iâm watching you
Through the glass in my hand
My bottle of treatment
I get on demand

For once I could speak to my inner voice
Unmasking your farce of offering me choice
Accepting the way Iâd have to go
The way that deceived me so

In the glance of jealousy I stand
Tryinâ to ease my grief
But I canât

When will you ever see the things Iâve seen
To be left alone
When will you ever feel the pain I feel

To be cast aside,
Aside
