Everywhere is nowhere
Now whereâs the sense in that?
The inner me gets colder
While my skin canât hold more beads of sweat
With every mile Iâm tumbling
My surface molds to fit
Lapsing from faith in you

Forever done
Done with denial
Forever done

Why king, why king, why
Is your kingdom overcome?
Why king, why king, why
Overgrown with moss and mold
His majesty is growing old

I feel my time expiring
From my wanderings I rest
Donât believe in my creator
But my disbelief I detest
I grasp onto the feeling
That Iâm the only one
Questioning my salvation
