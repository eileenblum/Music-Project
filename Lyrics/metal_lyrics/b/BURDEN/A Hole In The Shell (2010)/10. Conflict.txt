I have chosen
Smothering warmth no more
As I crater deep
Into the conflict laden

Blackness below
All hope is gone
While the backdrop of sense
In our conflictâs fading

Blackest ideation
Eats me up alive
I am drowning
In fragile revelations

Twisting and turning
I cannot retain no more
As I crater deep
Into the conflict laden

Blackness below
All hope is gone
While the backdrop of sense
In our conflictâs fading

Blackest ideation
Eats me up alive
I am drowning
In fragile revelations

I am too tired to cover
Sick and tired of giving myself away
You suck the life out of me
I convict myself to you
