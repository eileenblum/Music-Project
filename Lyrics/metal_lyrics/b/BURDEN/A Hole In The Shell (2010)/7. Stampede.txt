Daze me make me numb a doctrine becomes an ideal
I hang onto every word you mouth no doubt, no doubt
Iâm stampeding with the crowd it makes me dull in a way

Relieve me from my reason I am collateral to the collective
To your wisdom I am worthless no doubt, no doubt
Iâm stampeding with the crowd it makes me dull in a way

I will follow
Burn down what Iâve been before
I will follow you

Me fellows, my brothers
Through the illusion of war
Bleeding the soil that we were fighting for
