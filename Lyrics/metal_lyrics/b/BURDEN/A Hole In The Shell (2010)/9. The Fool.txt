The root of my being
My soul Iâve behold
When you crossed my way
The secrets of all my demons unfold

Iâm facing a passionate fool
An enemy worth to fight

This shallow weakness
And my demons to tame
I accept my burden
And from where it came

You canât cope with reality
To the border of insanity
Melancholy obsessinâ me
Setting all the demons free
They multiply infinity
Melancholy obsessing me
