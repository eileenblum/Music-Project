So I have given away my cover
So I bear my wounds to this world
Been carrying this pain around forever
I give in I canât walk no more

Been facing the throes of this world
How it shook me
Oh it shook me goddamn well

In my anger my misgiving
All I need is your distressful delusion
To kneel down to
And all I will be is living proof to the thrust
Of misguided feelings

We bless the broken!
We bless the broken!
We bless the broken!

Take your fucking souls
Pile âem up high
Burn âem down low
Cut deep into the flesh
Let it bleed
Let it heal
And let there be scars!
