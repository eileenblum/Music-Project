As I walk into a black room
I can feel the relieve (sic)
A million rays of light
Have worn out my skin

Oh and as I shut the door
Silence is veiling me
Veiling me finally
A room so dark
Couldnât tell if itâs white
Itâs darker than the deepest shade of black night

Whereâs it to be found
Oh take me into the black
Whereâs it to be found
The black room

The road to ruin is paved
Oh crumbling crooks
I chase my decay

When you walk through minds
And up to the spirits you rise
When there is no sound
And you can feel the pull of time
Your body is a crook that must be
Left behind

Whereâs it to be found
Take me into the black room
