Collapsing
So much pressure
It grinds you
It makes you weak
You are the soil
Every wave drags you out some more
Into the nothing

So much blood
On your hands
Tears in regret wonât wash it away

Where did you go
Where have you been
You have control
Of this process youâre in

You made mistakes
They cannot be solved in flames
Burning deep into your skin
Your skin
Is this your skin
Is this what you are
Does it itch when you try to sleep
When you lie awake

You wanna trade your itch
For pain

Go walk the earth
See the rivers recur
Until the process is over.
