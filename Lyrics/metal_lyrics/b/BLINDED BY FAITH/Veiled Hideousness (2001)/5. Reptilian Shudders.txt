Once again, the sun has sunk in the horizon,
Breaching the Occident with crimson wounds
Come, o Noctambulesque, creep under my shroud
and spread concupiscence in languorous pantomimes ...
your pleasure's the law if you discover mine...

Your scales' caresses
-Reptilian Shudders-
compensates for the bruise
left by fangs and claws
As saliva gives luster
I linger with fever
over your every pore
squirming by the temple
Where scrumptious vices dwell

Seduced thus uxurious,
tantalized by your venomous gaze,
I shine the idol of overshadowed rites,
this noble jewel deserves peculiar cares ...
a tongue alone won't do the trick
to lick the drizzle of strange frolics,
to quaff the monstrous passions that lurk in your leer

Your hospitable hiatus
exhales hedonistic delights,
and I taste it as a beast in a feast

Words seem superfluous,
we use another language,
But alas! Confuse contradictions!
Madrigals are tattooed inside your womb
as the bane of lust rages

An ardent and insidious duet
lay on a soil cleansed of taboos
in a hellcove where the supreme offering is brought,
an interlude amid turmoils

We should never relinquish
our immoderate projects,
may they lead us to our ruin...

A familiar specter shortens our nights,
the ignoble Somnolence
Now that we have blessed our flesh,
our both souls should here coalesce;
We're dislocated in amorous convulsions
-the aftermath of demented clasps -
Shatter my rib-cage and extirpate my heart
that source of trouble stuck in Ut
the burden of Melancholy alters my shoulders

" I cannot love except where Death
Is mingling his with Beauty's breath. "
[Edgar A. Poe]
