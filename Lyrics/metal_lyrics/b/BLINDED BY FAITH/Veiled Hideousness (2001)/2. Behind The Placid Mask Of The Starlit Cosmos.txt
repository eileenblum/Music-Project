Behind the placid mask of the starlit cosmos
or underneath the messy stars
scattered on the canvas of night
Someone is victim of the vision
of suspicious forms skulking in the sky

They came, and will come again
Them, the unknown, the alien,
aboard their huge spaceships
Illuminating infinity

Perhaps are we only a subspecie,
an uncommon subject of scientific
experiences on earth's vast laboratory?
Many humans have ever been kidnapped and examined

Are they the odd gods our ancestors once revered?
The sowers of our primitive civilizations?
Or merely witnesses of our self-destruction?

They have probably paced the earth
from a pole to the other ...
What lecagy remains of them
on this huninged sphere?

Our ridiculous selfishness
made us believe we were
the only life form in the Universe
To me, it's crystal clear we are not...

Cyborgs we already are
alloys of flesh and synthetic matters
Half-robots, half-humans
with our prosthesis and implants
Polluting our environment to sterilize it

Qui sait si nous ne sommes pas des monstres
nous qui distillons nos emotions pour les vendre?

Those interdimensional travellers
May be afraid of our madness.
Only when they'll land to stay
shall we at last realise the truth....
