A sharp blade is disguised by an elegant curtain
Devil's large hand corrupts with false beauty
and all the sheeps stupidly bite the lure of envy
Is a mirror vanity's mask?
They vainly search it deep within the glass...

Can't you hear our muted screams?
We want a key to confront this social sorcery
Disease fills the air...where are the cure streams?
Dead end ... vanity has poisoned the essence of purity
Welcome to the world where friends are hypocrites!

A keen blade is behind an elegant curtain
Vile temptations rise upon the land
and sheeps lick the feet of a thousand attractive lies
Is a mirror vanity's mask?
They vainly search it deep within the glass...

Hellish perfumes - a beast in the mind
Begins a war between mankind and the soul
of a nightly enchantress in a faded, yet nice dress
The wrath from above will end your "perfect crime"

You want to reach the sun, to challenge the winds?
To enter in a race no one can win?
-Harmful instincts, vicious healings -
All control lost in this cruel, cold sin

The enemy lies in this voracious spirit
protected by the sphere of consciousness
I anticipate an hecatomb
Only the strong deals with pain
But beyond death, they may reign
