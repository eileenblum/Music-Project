My soul is a wicked vulture
Who whishes to steal the celestial treasure
To revel in bliss and rapture

I will devour the blood-red skies
And reach the point where the sun never dies
Even if it may scorch both of my eager eyes

The torrid star of Knowledge
Burns my gilded wings to ashes
I fall in the maze of my mind

My corpse is lying in the crass
And there are many rows of rapacious crows
Craving for carrions of my carcass
but as a newborn phenix
I'll rise again from the styx
of my ignorance

As eternity unfurls before me
I make my way through space
When I reach my spiritual palace
I cannot, I can't see...
My lightened gem I have not found
And I'm ungently hitting the dirty ground
Hence my peers gathering around

In the air you will see my silhouette
Falling in a deadened sunset
As bitter as tears of Juliet
In the bleeding heart of a Poet
