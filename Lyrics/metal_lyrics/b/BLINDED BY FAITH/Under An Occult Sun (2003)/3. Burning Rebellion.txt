A crescendo of furious winds
Unleashes apocalypse
As flashing lightning bolts lacerate the skies
The storm rises and roars a funeral orison
All over the world
A merciless devastation is spawned by chaotic voices...

"You've tried to usurp the rights of my own
And failed to master the secrets of elements,
O careless, unconscious Human,
Tiny grain of sand in the desert of life!
Now it's too late to kneel and beg for clemency,
You must pay for your criminal domination.
Prepare for your punishment,
You'll perish in torment..."

Nature has decided to take a rightful revenge,
Awaking lava forces from the underground depths
Volcanoes erupt and spit rivers of fire
The brutal energy of a burning rebellion

The atmosphere is set ablaze
With impetuosity, earth's blood gushes forth
And wreaks incredible havoc
Elements seem possessed, they now reign
Elements seem enraged, the Doomsday has come

Seismic disasters open unknown faults
Our constructions reveal their frailty
Bridges, highways and skyscrapers collapse
Citizens go nuts, struck by a global panic
No safe shelter, no way to escape the cataclysm
The hurricane's mayhem spares no one

Desolation...

A giant wave invades valleys and plains
The flood soon submerge every continent
A single ocean purifies this planet's surface
Erasing the last memories of our civilization
