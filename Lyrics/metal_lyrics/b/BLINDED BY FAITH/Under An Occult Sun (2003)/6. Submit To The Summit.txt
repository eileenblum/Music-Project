Corruption seeps in the city
Under military security
Dictators in planes and limousines
Show their presidential prestige

This reunion is a mere facade
While eating caviar paid with our taxes
They sell our food, our wood, our souls
Bashing Human Rights for a fistful of bucks

A dyslexic Prime Minister spits his speech,
Ceremonial regards to the monetary obese...

"Free trade is a step forward for Democracy,
Let Honest businessmen do their duty,
All we expect from you is blind obedience,
Come on, submit to the summit!"

Mass Medias know a bit about mind control
Playing with truth and serving us carefully selected images
They won't go see what's really up in the back streets
Where cops brutality is not a myth
Dogs of law bark in the electric night
Barricaded doors and ugly decors
Outside the fence, a motley crowd with a thousand claims
Many demands but one negation

Slaves of the state, the police stands in rows
Waiting for the order to charge
Shields helmets bullet-proof jackets
No individual will lies in these numbered uniforms

Explosions...
Grey streaks fill the sky 
And the demonstrators disperse in total confusion
Some vomit most suffocate
Irritated and irate
Eyes burn sweat and tears mix
Flesh bruised by plastic bullets
Gas bombs thrown back from where they came
The struggle is imminent

Cause and effect... violence breeds violence
And the revolt turns to a riot
You better run fast when the cops swoop down on you as hungry vultures
Violence satisfies their primitive needs
As beaten Democracy bleeds
