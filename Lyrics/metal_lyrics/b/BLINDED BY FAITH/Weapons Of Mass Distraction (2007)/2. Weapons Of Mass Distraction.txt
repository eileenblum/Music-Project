Shockwave in the suburbs of the Empire,
The twin towers collapse, a glimpse of apocalypse,
30 seconds and the face of the world has changed

Scorched earth policy applied on US ground
Achillesï¿½ heel touched irremediably
And the giant chokes in the ashes of his dreams

Security increased and paranoia swells
Vengeance sharpened its claws
We need a scapegoat, a scarecrow, a symbol

A symbol of Hate and its horrid sequels
A scarecrow to incarnate our secrete nightmare
A scapegoat to charge and judge without appeal

But, thereï¿½s a but, eye for an eye is a law
that makes the world blind
Thereï¿½s an enemy and a victim,
but the victim soon becomes the enemy

[Chorus:]
Who wages the war, and who pulls the strings?
Hidden murderers, suit and tie criminals
Who wages the war, and who pulls the strings?
Donï¿½t be fooled by their weapons of mass distraction

Donï¿½t misunderstand our critic of the conflict,
We stand for nuance, doubt and judgement
Our point of view: thereï¿½s no Good and Evil in such a war
No one-way terrorism, no heroic excuse for murder

The circumstances were perfect
for the capitalistic untouchables
To instigate a New War Order
To implant monster corporation in hostile lands
To pump the black gold right from the veins of the Middle East

Shockwave at the heart of dissidence
Innocent civilians in the eye of the storm
Western reprisals take aim at the wrong target

The besieged crave to prove their firepower
To an invader of this stature
The jihad seems a suitable response

But, thereï¿½s a but, eye for an eye is a law
that makes the world blind
Thereï¿½s an enemy and a victim,
but the victim soon becomes the enemy

[Chorus x2]
