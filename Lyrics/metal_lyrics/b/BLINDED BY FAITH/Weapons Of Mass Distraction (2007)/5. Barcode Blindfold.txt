Everyday, every minute, everywhere
We are assailed by appeals to consumption
Always the same song with a few variations:
ï¿½You must buyï¿½you must buyï¿½ï¿½
You must buy a cage to trap the beast within
You must buy revolvers to sleep well
You must buy a house with bullet-proof doors
You should even buy a fake wife to wax your floors

You must buy this new car to go far
You must buy that new pool to be cool
(and soon youï¿½ll rent the sky to hang yourself with your tie or maybe slash your wrists with a loaded credit card)
You need more and more shit to be wise
You must buy more stuff to looks nice
(And soon youï¿½ll need a psy ï¿½cause youï¿½ll be wondering why your whole existence is so devoid of sense)

[Chorus:]
What you get ainï¿½t what you see
Publicity deforms reality
Use your fucking brain cells
To get rid of the barcode blindfold
What you get ainï¿½t what you see
Donï¿½t shut your mouth, donï¿½t let it be
Itï¿½s now or never, the brainwash is over
Take off the barcode blindfold

They will turn garbage into gold,
They will sell cosmetics for your soul,
Instant pleasure and plastic love,
They might even solve what canï¿½t be solved
Top-one illusion for a limited time
Packaged paradise and chap peace of mind
Wake up and tear down the screen
Weï¿½re not living in a fucking dream.

[chorus]
