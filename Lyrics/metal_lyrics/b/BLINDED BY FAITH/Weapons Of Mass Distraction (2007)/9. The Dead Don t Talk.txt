Conquerors burn the chronicles, archives are erased in auto-da-fe
The invaded ones lose their past and identity
As the scribbles embellish the legend of the strong
Slaves are doomed to kneel and stay mute
The dead donï¿½t talk.

Elites recreate reality for their own profit
In the dark, cold blooded liars tangle the tracks
Disfigure effigies and pull the strings
Make the puppets dance a grotesque waltz

Some truths still sleep in the shadow
In the gulf of the unknown where no probe can go
We must scratch the varnish to touch the rotten wood
And break the cast to uncover the infected wounds

Those who donï¿½t remember the past are condemned to repeat it

Reality is writing in blood and tears
Learn to perceive whatï¿½s beyond the evidence
Tear the blindfold, lift the veil
Chase out the spies that lurk behind the wall of Shame

We are told what to thing and who we must hate
Force fed with sentences with no sense
Like ï¿½the land of freedom versus the evil axis!ï¿½
Vain rhetoric, shallow speechesï¿½ Weï¿½re sick of this shit
But for sure, weï¿½ll hear it again
As long as the mediaï¿½s diarrheas will be poured in our brains
The question in not ï¿½are you free to speak?ï¿½
But ï¿½can you afford to be listened to?ï¿½
The Star ï¿½ Spangled Banner can be a gag, such a useful toolï¿½

Itï¿½s time to make a stand
We must now understand
That Machiavellian forces rule the world

Itï¿½s time to break the door open
Nor more eavesdropping
The game is over, weï¿½ll wreck the plan.
