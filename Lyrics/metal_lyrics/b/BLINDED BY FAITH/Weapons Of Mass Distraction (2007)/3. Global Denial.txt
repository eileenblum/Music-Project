I was told we once were a monkey
Even more, previously an insect or a fish
Destined to become a part of a great society

Although this may be a seducing story,
I believe that time has come to leave the lapse of memory
Our true origins we will remember
To understand the Beginning

Could the soul be the missing link???

Donï¿½t sit &amp; pray, refuse! Resist!
Refuse the Masonï¿½s treachery!
Resist to TV mental slavery!
Donï¿½t sit &amp; wait. Denounce! Push back! Counteract!

[Chorus:]
Of my despair, hope occurred
Kind of a Global Denial
Torrents of energy which rejected Fear
The sacred shield of the Mind

This is just a fragment of a vast hypnosis epidemic
A preconceived History
Filled with concepts to numb the mind
With an amalgam of bewitching approaches,
A thousand fairytales to feed the new-born
To assure our devotions towards ignorance

Could the soul be the missing link???

Donï¿½t sit &amp; pray, refuse! Resist!
Refuse the global policies!
Resist to the propagation of disease!
Donï¿½t sit &amp; wait. Denounce! Push back! Counteract!

[chorus]

A global denial against a global domination
A global denial
Expose the facts, see how they react
