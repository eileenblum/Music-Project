I was only ten, and even then
I listened to my Maiden at maximum volume
It was so easy to drive the neighbours crazy
I remember them saying "This child is going nowhere"

But I didn't care, "Who are you to judge me?
Go mow your lawn and leave me alone.
I'll crank it up so I won't hear your dumb shit.
And grow my hair just because you hate it"

This music gave me the strength to say fuck 'em

[Chorus:]
I love it when the tubes overheat and crack, about to explode
When distortion roars like thunder in the storm
I wanna pump all the power and burn all the fuses
I'll surely die deaf,'cause my motto is: The louder the better

Twenty years later, things haven't changed, I carry on
Spreading the plague, yielding the horns

I must have sniffed some gun powder
I feel radioactive like a Chernobyl survivor
And when I'll be in the madhouse at 50 years-old
I'll be the only bastard up and screaming: "rock and roll!"

Banging my metal head against the padded wall
Knocking on death's door
This shit'll give me the strength to say fuck you all
Once again, motherfuckers

[Chorus]
