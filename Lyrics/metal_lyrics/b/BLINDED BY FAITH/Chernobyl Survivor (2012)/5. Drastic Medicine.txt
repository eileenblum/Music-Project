Not for the faint of heart
We give it a start
Adrenaline flows like nitro

We come to shake the place
To set the stage ablaze
Weâre a six pack
Of ammoniac
Every ass kicked
No rest for the sick

We sweat acid rain
Sulphur drains in our veins
Exiled on earth
Condemned since birth
To deafen the world

Now you convulse, itâs getting worse
With every verse, itâs more perverse
Carnivorous, pacifist in reverse, weâll drive the verse
But molest your corpse first
Weâre a cannonball, surgical like a cannibal
When we chop your skull the shock is lethal
Then we stick scissors youâre the spine
To cut along the dotted line

We ainât got anything to lose
We attack life a pack of wolves set lose
Weâre here to rock your ass so come with us
If you donât like our stuff we donât give a FUCK
Sonic surgeons we plunge decibels like scalpels into your ears
Molten metal
Poured in the brain
Method to go insane
This is the drastic medicine

[Solo: Pascal CÃ´tÃ©]

This switch is on, countdown to explosion
Total slaughter
No prisoners
Resistance is futile
Youâll join the other bodies in a pile
Building crumbles
Under skies that rumble
Weâll break the wall of sound
And burn cities to the ground

Now you convulse, itâs getting worse
With every verse, itâs more perverse
Carnivorous, pacifist in reverse, weâll drive the verse
But molest your corpse first
Weâre a cannonball, surgical like a cannibal
When we chop your skull the shock is lethal
Then we stick scissors youâre the spine
To cut along the dotted line
