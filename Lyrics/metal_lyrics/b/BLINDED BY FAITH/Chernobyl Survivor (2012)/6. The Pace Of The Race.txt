Get out of the womb, come on
Your mother has better to do than suffer for you
Grow up fast too, there's no time to lose
Short and burning fast, life's like a fuse

Go to school, feel the pressure, it's not a game
You need to know now what you will be doing
For the next fifty years, there's no time to lose
Choose a job, tighten the rope, climb the slope

[Chorus:]
The pace of the race is set
As fast as it gets
You must just devour the highway of modern life
Faster and faster

Tie the knot, the honeymoon ends soon
Fuck fast, cum fast, cheat your wife
Make a child or two, there's no time to lose
Divorce and then, get married again

Big Mac attacks your stomach? Fuck the facts!
Eat fast, eat fast, eat crap, fill the gap
Fuel the machine, there's no time to lose
Gulp and elbow, way to go

And become ill till you become
A walking corpse, completely used
Die fast, there's no time to lose
We ll bury you fast, and forget you even faster

[Chorus]
