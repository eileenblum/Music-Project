Stop! Don't drink and drive, but don't walk drunk in the streets either
Buckle up your seat belt and shut the fuck up, this is for your safety
Stop at traffic lights even when you're alone on the road in the middle of the night
Don't exceed speed limits, and most of all, don't ask why, just don't do it

Stop! Don't offer your body on the streets, don't try to rent your flesh
You can prostitute but keep the secret and be discrete
But if you decide to become a porn star, it's ok, at least you'll pay taxes
Like any good citizen, like any honest worker would

[Chorus:]
And so speaks the voice of law
The voice that sings for a better world
Control and order, obey and don't think
Don't object, be perfect, don't ask why

Stop! Don't kill these poor vegetables who aren't even humans anymore
Who are you to decide who will live and who will die? god only can
Maybe these old men and women nailed to their sickbed all day
Are still happy to live, even if they can't eat or wash themselvesâ¦

Control and order, obey and don't think control and order
Control and order, obey and don't think control and order

In a world without crimes to prevent, institutions would fall
So many people would lose their jobs, isn't it clear?
Policemen, judges, lawyers, warden, watchmen,
Probation officers, legislators and tax auditorsâ¦

[Chorus]

Moreover, human beings are irresponsible, selfish,
Unconscious and even dangerous, irrational animals
Society is like a giant kindergarten, it needs to be kept
Under constant surveillanceâ¦ so speaks the voice of law!
