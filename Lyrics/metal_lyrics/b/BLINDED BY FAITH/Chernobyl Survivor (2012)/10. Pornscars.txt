Never enough, more and more, the nastier the better
Siliconed, botoxed to the bones, hardcore icons
No need for brains, bad deeds drive them insane
On the screen, nameless teen, bitches scream
The love it rough and go straight to the point
Not time to lose, no romance shit

They want dicks now and know how to get them
Man meat for dinner and cream pie for desert
Perfect dolls for dirty games, always opened wide
Sex artists with skills, every manâs secret dream

Orgasm distributors, machines designed to fuck
Doesnât ask respect or caring in return

And they do everything, everything, everything
Doggy style, DP, deep throat, bukkake
Dirty Sanchez, salad tossing, pussy licking
Multiple impalements, deserved punishment

Blindfolded, gagged, strangled, hanged
Bonded, trampled on, whipped, dominated
They never complain and know who commands

My desire is to drill a hundred, a thousand new holes
In your bellies, your breasts, your skulls, your souls
I want to carve my hate into you, tearing you apart
Until you return to your native nothingness

Where the hell is the lustful, insatiable whore
Whoâll swallow it all without saying a word?
Realityâs so unsatisfying, so boring in the end
My wifeâs sick in bed again with a migraine

She doesnât allow me to touch her anymore
The golden days are long gone and far beyond
And Iâm masturbating on the living room couch
With all these naked faceless girls dancing in my head
