Kids grow in this omnipresent violence,
No wonder then some of them get mentally ill
And develop a fascination for assassination
The will to kill
Going into schools with guns, to shoot and run
To kill for fun
An easy trick to get some days of ridiculous recognition
The enraged soldier never has thirty lives
Itâs not Contra here, donât you realize?
When you pull the trigger, one time is enough
Thereâs no reset button when you blow brains off

[Chorus:]
But in the end, I donât give a damn, enough worries for today
Itâs not worth it, the world canât be changed, and itâs too late anyway
Iâm the prophet of nothing, I preach to the wind, my words fall on deaf ears
All I believe in seems to gradually disappear

And then what happens? Medias are there to serve you the disaster
Shooting are gold mines for some subspecies of shit diggers
Death sells and they all want a slice of the pie
Cameras zoom on the traumatized blondeâs tearful eyes

Day after day, the crime is on the screen
Variations on the same fucking thing
Till you wanna throw
Your TV out of the window
Till you get retarded
And strangled yourself with the cord

[Chorus]

Atlas could bear the world on his shoulders
I canât. Itâs too heavy, and Iâm a quitter
All I wanna do is relax a little
Pull the plug on my schizophrenic battle
Stop the train of thoughts before it breaks all my bones
Tell the ghost of the child I was to leave me alone
