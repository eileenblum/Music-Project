We went to see you at the hospital
In your bed, you were already skeletal
It was a matter of time before you died
Cancer was eating you from inside
So we decided to take you with us
So you could at least spend your last minutes
Away from those strangers in the cold
We can't leave a dog on the threshold

When your pain was unbearable
Like molten lead pour in your innards
You took morphine to get some relief
Instantly falling in a coma-like sleep
And I often wondered where you were then
In a no man's land? Not far from heaven?
In a color dream where you could screw
All those women who didn't want you?

[Chorus:]
You were there, Death without poetry
Grotesque and scandalous nudity
I wanted to weep but tears didn't come
My heart stood still like a frozen sun
I could only stare at your open eyes
Your mouth tensed with a silent cry
Your shoulder blades under the skin
Protruding like two shriveled wings

In the night, you knocked on oblivion's door
I found you still on the bathroom floor
In a ring of clotted blood
A fist in the face, my first cadaver
So different than the other corpses I've seen
Liars in black suits, masquerade!
Perfectly prepared for the human parade
A fake prayer in the funeral comedy

[Chorus]
