Dig in you say
But the earth is hard and cold
Hold on you say
But my hands already holding the gold
Listen you say
But there's no song to be heard
Work hard everyday
But what is there to earn
Evil is coming down the road

It's a big flood we've never seen before
We will rise together like the sun
No more darkness, the darkness overcomes

Your words are grey
And scream insecurity
For I swim today
In the seas of possibilities
Save me you pray
But I've thrown my coins in the fountain
Climb high you claim
But I'm standing on the mountain

One day you'll reach the end of the road
And you'll think about the things you were told
If life was just a game all for fun
Will you feel like you have won
