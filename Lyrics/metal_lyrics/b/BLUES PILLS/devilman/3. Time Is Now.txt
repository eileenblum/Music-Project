Not your friend don't ask me why
Won't believe a word of your lies
Got a preacher man knocking down my door
Says I don't look clean in the eyes of the lord

God is light
To the poor souls who dwell in night
Time is now
Live today

Go away don't come no more
Don't need no preacher at my door
When the end comes then you'll see
It all came down 'cause of you and me

God is light
To the poor souls who dwell in night
Time is now
Live today
