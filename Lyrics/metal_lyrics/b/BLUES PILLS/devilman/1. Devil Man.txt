O' devil man, o' devil man
You got money in your pocket
You got blackness in your soul
O' devil man, o' devil man
You think you've got the answer
But you could never know

O' devil man, o' devil man
You take diamonds you've been given
And you turn them into coal
O' devil man, o' devil man
You ain't got no reason
And your heart's a dirty hole

O' devil man, o' devil man
Your feeble mind is wicked
You're never gonna learn
O' devil man, o' devil man
Too late to be forgiven
Your soul is gonna burn

Evil inside of you showing
Evil inside of you glowing
Evil inside of you growing
You're such a devil man
