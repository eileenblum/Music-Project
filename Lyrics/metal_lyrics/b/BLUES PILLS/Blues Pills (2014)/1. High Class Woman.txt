Blue birds flying so far from the ground
Green grass is growing, and the sun is high
Old man sitting on a bench of stone
Far from nothing, far from home
Dreams within him are running wild
Hair grown long, he's the summer's child
Fear sends chills down through his bones
Sits back waiting to die alone

High class woman, high class man
So much power held in your hand
High class woman, high class man
Day is coming and you'll all be damned

Hey, do you understand?
Day is coming and you'll all be damned

Gold sun setting on a silver dawn
Drift away into the great beyond
Truth is waiting for you to find
Take my hand, leave this world behind

High class woman, high class man
So much power held in your hand
High class woman, high class man
Day is coming and you'll all be damned

Walk with me into the morning light
Midnight sun blinds my eyes
Let your soul drift into the sea
Set your mind and your body free
Hey yeah
Yeah-yeah
Set your mind and your body free

High class woman, high class man
So much power held in your hand
High class woman, high class man
Day is coming and you'll all be damned
