I head across the country, looking for Mexico
I got stuck in Kansas with no place to go
Oh I'm a gypsy, that's what I am
Uh, I'm a gypsy, and I don't give a damn
Somebody took my load
And I got no place to go
But I'm  trying to find my mind
Yes I'm  trying to find myself

I'm a gypsy, that's what I am
Uh, I'm a gypsy, and I don't give a damn

And I can see a train coming down the track
I'm gonna jump on it, and I won't look back
Ho-oh, I can see a train now coming down the track
I'm gonna jump on it, and I won't look back

Ain't nobody stop my moving
Coming to your, coming to your town
Time is wasting
Ain't no time for my world renown
'Cause I can see a train coming down the track
I can see a train coming down the track

I'm moving across the highway
Over this great land, hey
Coming to your town to see your face
Time is wasting
Ain't no time to waste
I am a gypsy, that's what I am
