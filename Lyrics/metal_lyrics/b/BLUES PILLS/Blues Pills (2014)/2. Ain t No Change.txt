There's a change in the sea
But I know there ain't no change in me
Don't you hide stay with me big moon
Keep on going what more can you do

'Cause everybody wants to change
You've got to stand up and face your fate
There ain't no way to save it all
Now we're backed against a wall
It doesn't matter, it's too late

Oceans dying, people are crying
Government is spying on you and me
Wake up darling, darling can't you see
I'm begging you to come, come and set me free

'Cause everybody wants to change
You've got to stand up and face your fate
There ain't no way to save it all
Now we're backed against a wall
It doesn't matter, it's too late

There's a change in the sea
But there ain't no change in me
Time has come, soon too late
Don't want to know our fate

The last piece of hope is exiting my mind
We just run around in circles,
Feels like everybody's blind
When will you wake up?
You think you are free?
They're gonna wire tap your telephones
And tax the air you breathe

There's a change in the sea
But there ain't no change in me
Time has come, soon too late
Don't want to know our fate
