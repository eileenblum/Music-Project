Your feeble mind is wicked
You're never gonna learn
Oh devil man, oh devil man
Too late to be forgiven
You got what you deserved
Oh devil man, oh devil man

Where you gonna run my friend?
Truth will haunt you 'til you're dead
All the selfish things you did
No one ever will forgive
Guess you had the losing hand
When you look back in the end
In the end

Oh devil man, oh devil man
You take diamonds you've been given
You turn 'em into coal
Oh devil man, oh devil man
You ain't got no reason
And your heart's a dirty hole
Oh devil man, oh devil man

Where you gonna run my friend?
Truth will haunt you 'til you're dead
All the selfish things you did
No one ever will forgive
Guess you had the losing hand
When you look back in the end
In the end
Evil, evil inside of you growing
There's evil, evil inside of you showing
Evil, evil, evil
You're such a devil man

Oh devil man
You got what you deserved
You're never gonna learn

Oh devil man
