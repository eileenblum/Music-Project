Gallons of water was flowing
And people were floating up to the air
Death came up with his black robe on
And took all the sinners to hell
Is there nothing left to see?
Have we ever been?
Is this all a dream?
Or a haunting in my sleep?

Sixteen demons haunt me in my sleep
Never leaving a moment of peace
Sixteen reasons I'll never know who I am
I just keep wondering and drifting alone in this life
'Til I'm dying

All of the forests were burning
And black smoke was rising up through the air
God came down with his white beard long
And damned all the sinners who dared
Is there nothing left to see?
Have we ever been?
Is this all a dream?
Or a haunting in my sleep?

A thousand thoughts going through my mind
Dreams I once had I left behind
Got an angel knocking at my door
Accept and let go, I wave goodbye to my soul

Sixteen demons haunt me in my sleep
Never leaving a moment of peace
Sixteen reasons I'll never know who I am
I just keep wondering, I just keep wondering
