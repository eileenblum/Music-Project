I go, I go walking south by the river
I'm told, I'm told I'll find gold by the river
So long so long
My dear friends and hello strangers
Oh shine oh shine
My sweet metal please release
Oh my bodies soar, don't hurt no more

It's time it's time
I hope my search will find an answer
It's hard but I keep on wondering how
My life could change for the better
You know I tried to get things right
Thought this would be the answer
So wash so wash
Wash that dirt from my treasure

Oh this precious gold won't make me whole
Please let me go

All I ever wanted was right in front of me
This life made me empty
I've got nothing left to give
How you hurt my pride, you pushed me down to the ground
All you ever wanted was to hold me down

It' hard but I keep on wondering how
My life could change for the better
You know I tried to get things right
Thought this would be the answer
So I wash, I wash
I wash that dirt from my treasure
It's hard, so hard
But I learn and I get better
Oh this precious gold won't make me whole

I go I go but it's a long way to the river

And I can't find any gold by the river
