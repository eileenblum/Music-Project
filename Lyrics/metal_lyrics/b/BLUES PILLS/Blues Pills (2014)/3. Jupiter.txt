When the earth no longer turns and the sun cannot be seen
If your debts are all behind maybe joy you'll finally see
You've got to stay my baby, stay though it's bothering me

Oh I hope, I hope you will see, how this world should have been

Have you listened to the sounds the other planet screams
Soon the ocean's icy water drowns the dreams we see
Stay Jupiter, you are the brother above
Stay Jupiter, I wanna show you my love

Oh I hope, I hope you will see, how this world should have been

Oh child, children the time has come
The mother is crying and it won't be long
'Til she will leave us, leave us behind
And I hope, I hope you will see
Before she leaves, leave us behind
Oh I hope, I hope you will see
How this world should have been... the circle of time
