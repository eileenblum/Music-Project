You been gone so long
And the truth been hanging on
Ruthless lies our bleeding words
You're surprised it's over

Oh tomorrow the shame remains
Tomorrow I'll bear the pain
Only the gods keep the secrets untold
Time flew by, today we're old

Worthless fights, a living hell
Vicious thoughts kept feeding the flame

On this night I'll carry you home
On this night I'll pull you in

Oh when that hollow note
Reach the end of its tone
Pulls me from the deep
Oh it's a heavy load
Walking down this road
You got the worst of me
This time tomorrow
See what tomorrow will bring
Again

You been gone so long
And the truth been hanging on
On this night I'll carry you home
On this night I'll pull you in

Help me I cannot bear how this sorrow sings
Save me from the empty madness my sorrow brings

Oh when that hollow note
Reach the end of its tone
Pulls me from the deep
Oh it's a heavy load
Walking down this road
You got the worst of me
This time tomorrow
See what tomorrow will bring
Oh tomorrow
See what tomorrow will bring
Again
