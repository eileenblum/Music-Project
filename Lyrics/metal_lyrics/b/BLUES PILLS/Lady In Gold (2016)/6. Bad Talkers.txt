Hey little darling
Don't be down people come around
(Hey don't be down, don't be down, people come around)

Everbody wanna find joy in life

But nobody wants it for you
I'm sick and tired of hiding my smile
The world is cruel whatever you do
Hey little darling Don't get down people come around
It won't get to me
It won't set you free
Keep on wasting all your time

You're talking to me
But I don't hear a word you say
I hope you find yourself
Cause you will have to face
The harsh cold reality
Oh, bad talker
You're just a bad talker

People keep on feeding all their evil thoughts
Spinning the wheel of hate
All the sounds I hear come out of your mouth
Make me lose my faith in the human race

Hey little darling
Don't get down people come around
It won't get to me
It won't set you free
Keep on wasting all your time

Haven't you heard about evil
It tells you what to do
What if the world was equal
And no one was judging you
So I say hey little darling
Don't be down people come around, hey hey hey

Hey little darling
Don't be down people come around, hey hey hey
Day is dawning
Don't get down of the people's sound, hey hey hey

(Hey don't be down, don't be down, people come around)
You're talking to me
But I don't hear a word you say
I hope you find yourself
Cause you will have to face
The harsh cold reality
Oh bad talker
You're just a bad talker
