You stood on a darkened
Edge of a dead end street
Stuck inside of a whirlwind
The same way you wished for me

Slave to your needs
Your claws are on my back
I donât know if Iâm gonna last

From this pain
In my heart from your rejection
I got pain
In my heart like an injection

All out of glory
Iâll never be the same
Behind my smile thereâs a twisted mind
If fills my heart with pain

Iâm just looking for something
Something thatâs good and true
But it seems like Iâm always waiting
You love can be so cruel

All my suspicions steering me away
That kind of poison driving me insane
Your loveâs the curse, got me feeling low
All Iâve ever known

Pain and rejection
In my heart like an injection
Pain and rejection
All I need is your affection

So Iâm running
(Iâm running)
I keep on running from your lovingâ
(Iâm running)
Iâm running from what I am becoming
(Iâm running)
From what you are
(Iâm running)

(Running, running, runningâ¦)

You stood on a darkened
Edge of a dead end street
Stuck inside of a whirlwind
The same way you wished for me
Locked to your needs

Pain and rejection
In my heart like an injection
Pain and rejection
All I need is your affection

All my suspicions steering me away
That kind of poison driving me insane
Your loveâs the curse, got me feeling low
All Iâve ever known
Got me feeling low
I gotta let you go
All Iâve ever know
