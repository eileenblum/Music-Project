You spend a dollar
Spend it on something true
He's taller, you're much smaller
Would he care if he was you
And would he bother
Oh, would he bother if you
Had nobody to turn to
There's no honour in the things we do
For that dollar, that dollar or two
There's no honour in the things we do
For that dollar, that dollar or two

Power seeker
(Won't be there for you)
When you need them
(Won't be there for you)
Getting weaker
(Won't be there for you)
Foolish dreamer
(Won't be there for you)
Power seeker
(Won't be there for you)
No no no no no one's there for you
(Won't be there for you)
No no no no no one's there for you
(Won't be there for you)

Pretty graceful, you
But there's no truth in that
There's no cover for one another
Too late to turn around
This mess is inside out

No one gets by there's no easy way
Time slipping by past repeats itself
No one asks why but I think we had enough
Old folks gonna pass it down
Young folks gonna past it around

Power seeker
(Won't be there for you)
When you need them
(Won't be there for you)
Getting weaker
(Won't be there for you)
Foolish dreamer
(Won't be there for you)
Power seeker
(Won't be there for you)
No no no no no one's there for you
(Won't be there for you)
No no no no no one's there for you
(Won't be there for you)

You gotta try to be alive
And find a reason to believe in
You gotta try to be alive
And find a reason to believe in
Got to be my reason
