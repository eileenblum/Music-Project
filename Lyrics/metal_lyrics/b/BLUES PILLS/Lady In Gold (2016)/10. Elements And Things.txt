Reach up to the sky
Reach up to the sky
I would but the sun's in my eyes
Can you see the lightnin'
Can you see the lightnin'
Oh but why are you so frightened why?

Can you hear the thunder?
Can you hear the thunder?
Oh you lay back down and wonder yeah
Step out on the moon
Step out on the moon
There ain't nothin' but gloom
On the dark side

It's dark and forboding
It's dark and forboding
Oh my mind is overloading yeah yeah
Can you hear the thunder?
Can you hear the thunder?
Oh you lay back down and wonder
About things
