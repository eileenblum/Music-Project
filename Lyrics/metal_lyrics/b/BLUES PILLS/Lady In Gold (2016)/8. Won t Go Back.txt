Iâve been falling
Heâs my darling
Feeling less than nothing
I was getting what I deserved

Just like my mother
I lived undercover
If I could have seen it coming
Iâd have left a long time ago

I been down too long
On the bottom of my empty soul
And Iâll never get back
All the years that you stole

You see me bleeding Iâve had enough
Iâm already leaving
You wonât touch me no more
I packed my things I slam the door
Now Iâm the one in control
I wonât go back
(Never ever, oooh)
No I wonât go back to you
(Never ever, oooh)
I wonât go back
(Never ever, oooh)
I will never go never ever go back to you
(Never ever, oooh)

You see me grinning
Itâs because Iâm winning
Leaving the mistakes
I made too many times before

I ainât giving you nothing
I just hope that your suffering
You get what youâve done
Thereâs no place that you can run

You see me bleeding Iâve had enough
Iâm already leaving
You wonât touch me no more
I packed my things I slam the door
Now Iâm the one in control
I wonât go back
(Never ever, oooh)
No I wonât go back to you
(Never ever, oooh)
I wonât go back
(Never ever, oooh)
I will never go never ever go back to you
(Never ever, oooh)

Thereâs no truth in you
No use for to try
All the abuse you do
This is my goodbye

Time time I wonât ever go back
Never go back, never go back
No no no
I wonât ever go back
Never go back, never go back
No no no

You see me bleeding Iâve had enough
Iâm already leaving you lost my trust
Cause this time I wonât ever go
Never go back, never go back
No no no
