An ozone shell burst
Skies are torn in scraps
The existence of millenniums
disappeared in a moment

Fuck!

Fuck this world, fuck
this morbid hole
Fuck human race
these plague rats
Fuck this world, fuck
from god's beginning
Fuck biosphere
There is no bright future

Equilibrium is crashed,
there is only one side
Only chaos is forms
next mighty stage

Birth in fear
Birth in pain
This flash for death
What sense in this?
Where human is,
there always war
Kill yourself,
before be killed

Fuck this world, fuck
this morbid hole
Fuck human race
this plague rats
Fuck this world, fuck
from god's beginning
Fuck biosphere
Here is no bright future
