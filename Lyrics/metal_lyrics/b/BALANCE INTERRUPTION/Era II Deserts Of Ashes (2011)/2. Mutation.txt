Strong from the strongest
You survived after
But in new world
you are hermit

You can't look at this world
as can't look in your reflection
Is it heavy to know mutated face?
Admire yourself! You are human!

Mutation!
Mutation!
Mutation!
Mutation!

Suffering tribe of rotting mutants
Remains of mankind among
deserts of ashes

Fear in tomorrow
No faith and no hope
Around grey endlessness
slowly killing you

It's heavy to breathe
Inflamed entrails pressing
Bleeding ulcers on skin
Drying out of extremities

Death is near
from mutation
or from squad
of apocalypse
