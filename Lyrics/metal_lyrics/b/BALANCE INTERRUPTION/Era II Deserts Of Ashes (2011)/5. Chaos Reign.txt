Time of your senseless coming to the end
Error of universe will be erased

Chaos reign - death to mankind
Chaos in flame - atomic storm
Last generation, pride for yourself!
You are last from parasites
Chaos reign - truth and justice
Sentence "To burn!"- mass command
Total regime in our fist
Liberation of Earth - here and now


Just now you begin to think
Just now you see your damage
Just now you begin to regret
Just now it's too late

Blazing waves are moving from the horizon,
traceless erasing fucken human's life
Falling on knees, you suffer from fear
From your sentence no way to escape

Chaos reign -
Flaming madness
Nuclear war -
bombs for rescue
Interruption
of your life
Liberation
from yourself

Chaos reign - death to mankind
Chaos in flame - atomic storm
Last generation, pride your self!
You was last from parisides
Chaos reign - truth and justice
Sentence "To burn!"- mass command
Total regime in our fist
Liberation of Earth - here and now

And now here is silence and emptiness
And now here is no human's decay
And now here is no soiling of Earth
And now you are not present here
