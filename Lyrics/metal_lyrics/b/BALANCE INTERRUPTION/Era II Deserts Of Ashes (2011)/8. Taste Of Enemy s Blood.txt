Our flag
extends
on bloody ground
Our hymn
sounds
here around
My cup
full
of blood
Our day
of triumph
came. And I fell

Taste of enemy's blood
Taste of enemy's blood
Taste of enemy's blood
Taste of enemy's blood

My throne stands on soil of corpses
Past kings rot in this bloody mass
Every miserable nit is destroyed
Rotting sysem drowned in blood

Unforgiven
long-awaited triumph
Ceremony
"Liberation of Earth"
Bloody cult -
victim is mankind
Introduction
of new power

Your death
our dark purpose
We were born
for this
Destroying
old and decayed
For sowing of
own eternity

I damn you!
I damn you!
I damn you!
my enemy!
