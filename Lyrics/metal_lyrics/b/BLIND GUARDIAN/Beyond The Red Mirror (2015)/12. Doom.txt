[Bonus Track]How did I get here?
What will I find here?
I've come to meet
The evil one

I understand
There is no sense
The curse lives on
My children mourn

Truth is a beast
With a sad face
A demon
The cruelest of all

Forever
Forever

I'm wondering
Who is it for?
There's nothing more

There is no door
No more lies

You won't enter
You will see
They've locked the secret place out

And day won't come again

So there's no relief
When truth shall be revealed
By now you know the answer
So there's no relief
But revenge

Abandoned, forgotten, deceived
Wherever they may roam
So faithful, so loyal
Still no one will come
You're alone

Don't call it destiny

We will remember
Skies may fade
And stars may wane
We won't forget
And your light shines bright
Yes, so much brighter
Shine on
We will remember
Until the skies will fall
We won't forget
We will remember
We all shall follow doom

It's going down
Going down
And there's nothing you can do

Look into my eyes
And see
Your seed
It may grow
This is no vision

It's the curse I set upon your kin
You'll be deceived

Their cries shall come true
It shall be me
You blame
Now watch and see
I'll set doom
Upon you
Your offspring shall bloom
Wherever they may roam
I'll bind them
I'll split them
In solitude
Sorrow shall grow
Unknown

We will remember
Skies may fade
And stars may wane
We won't forget
And your light shines bright
Yes, so much brighter
Shine on
We will remember
Until the skies will fall
We won't forget
We will remember
We all shall follow doom

There is no choice
There's repentance
'Cause nothing will grow here at all
Redeem the oath
And pay the price
If you want

Here on these fields
Where truth shall be revealed
In doom you'll find the answers
Still there's no release
You shall feel

Let's face it
Since everything's shown
You've been through this alone
The deeper the wounds
So much greater the sorrows will grow
There is no sense in it

We will remember
Skies may fade
And stars may wane
We won't forget
And your light shines bright
Yes, so much brighter
Shine on
We will remember
Until the skies will fall
We won't forget
We will remember
We all shall follow doom
