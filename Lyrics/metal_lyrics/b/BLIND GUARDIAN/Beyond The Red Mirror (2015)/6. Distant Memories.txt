[Limited Edition/Vinyl Track]Now Storm come closer
Can feel you're getting near
Just stay invisible till itâs over

But still they donât know
They're just caught in distant memories
Then these fools will fade away
They may not fear the fall

They won't be anymore
I hear their silent singing

We don't fear anymore
We don't fear him

Now don't come closer
Stand still
Don't interfere
Donât move or things go wrong

We're trapped in twilight
Trapped in the mind of a sacrificial king
And the sun won't shine here anymore
I curse the Crow
Dear old friend

And when the time is right for changes
We will salute you
And a new age may begin

But still they don't know
They're just caught in distant memories
Then these fools will fade away
They may not fear the fall

When all the magic is gone
No need to carry it along

Whatever the cost
It will not be redeemed
And whatever may come
It will not bring relief

In the mirror
They may fail to see
What is real behind
There it ends
And there is no return
They will go down
They all will have to drown

Out of the dark
Into the grey
These fools will fade away
No matter what
I've come to say
These fools will fade away

A storm comes closer
Can feel you're getting near?
Just stay invisible, you're no savior

But still they donât know
They're just caught in distant memories
Then these fools will fade away
They may not fear the fall

I know they reach out for someone
Reach out for the great unknown

But still they don't know
They're just caught in distant memories
Then these fools will fade away
They may not fear the fall

They've thought
It is time for changes
We will salute you
Moved on to the promised land
We will salute you
Now let it begin
They've found a new god
