[Joost:]
As I salute you
I recruit you
No more games, my friend
According to your virtues
I may use you
You'll be at my command
And I will send you straight to hell

[The Conjurer:]
Magic spells
Unholy tricks
There's thrice to mine
And thrice to shine
It's threefold six
At river Styx
While you may find
The world goes blind
Then hand in hand
You shall descend
