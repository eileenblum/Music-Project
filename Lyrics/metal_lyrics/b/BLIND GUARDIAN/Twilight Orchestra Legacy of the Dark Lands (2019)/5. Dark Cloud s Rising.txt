I salute you, dawn
It's a new age
Dear friends, welcome
Kings and noble men
They may not come
No one's ever seen
A brighter crowd and feast
But I feel dark clouds
Rising from the fields of misery
This road goes on
Forevermore
This road goes on
Forever on
Still the road goes on
Still the road goes on
And for a last time
I bid farewell
And for a last time
I repent
It is the road
Calling again
No further grief
Beyond that door
I'm on my way
Out of the dark
Let's hold on to the dream
The wind will
Lead us
Over yonder and astray
But I feel dark clouds rising
The road goes on
And on and on and on...
Now it's your turn
Search for the great unknown
You might lose it
Don't forget
For there is truth to find
Beyond the walls of sleep
What I believe
I cannot prove
Yet
Winding roads lead straight ahead

What does it all mean to me?
You need advice
You have to face this
I will take you to places
You would not like to be
Meet a fearsome enemy
Terrible and dark
Behold that foe is near
Beware
Beware
Beware
No time to lose
It lies before and behind
My burden
I will carry it along
This road goes on and on
But you shall not walk alone
For friends
You'll meet on your way
Good spirits follow your ways
Am I trapped in lies?
Who can tell me?
Will things go wrong?
What the future holds
The stars may know
Somewhere out
There must be freedom
There must be
But I feel dark clouds rising
From the crypt of history
This road goes on
Forevermore
This road goes on
Forever on
Still the road goes on
Still the road goes on
Rising
