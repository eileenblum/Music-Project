[Voice:]
Hurry up!

[Nicolas:]
What is this place?
Where is this place?
When is this place?

[Voice:]
It's nowhere safe but here
You're caught between the realms
Nicolas, listen!
There is a strong wall
It consists a magic of old
Still
There are many gates unguarded
She
Seed of an unholy union
Reborn whore of Babylon
Fulfills the ancient prophecy
And her power is increasing

[Nicolas:]
But is there anything I can do?

[Voice:]
You better be swift
