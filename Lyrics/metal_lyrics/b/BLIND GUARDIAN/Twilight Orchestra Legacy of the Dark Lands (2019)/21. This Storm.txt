Beware
Beware
Death is drawing near
You better run
You better hide
But even then
It's just a matter of time

I was not afraid
When it all began
I was picking up the pieces
When a voice in sorrow sang
Thought I heard a madman crying

Oh no
There she comes
Vows to the darkened sun
Armed with weapons
And magic spells
Men you better run
Men you better run

There at the gate I wonder
The final hope
In these barren lands
Too late I fear
Is it long gone by?

The lord
He will come for your souls
For the harvest is rich
Seed has grown
The reaper's surrounded by ghosts
Surrender
And die
You'll die

This storm will change it all
A twisted constellation
Behold the queen
And the prince of the north
Transcending conspiration
When Death and Mars align
Their union seals the fate of men
There at the edge I stand alone

But now
Since there is everything revealed
I know
Yes there is no one else
Like me
And I will break free
When everything's lost
There's nothing to fear

They're invincible creatures
No longer will hunger
Immortalized shadows
Their kingdom will come

Warrior
Warrior

Gather up
I'm the storm
I'll bind you
You'll be the flame
I'm the spark
My wayward friends
You must come and find me
In the dark

I have seen everything
Behind my closed doors
Truth, gloom, and doom
Fools and stars
Enslaved
But still alive

The righteous
The pure
He must wait
Until his time is at hand
Return to the land of the elder
Escape

This storm will change it all
A twisted constellation
Behold the queen
And the prince of the north
Transcending conspiration
When Death and Mars align
Their union seals the fate of men
There at the edge I stand alone

You're roaming through darkness
Protector of man
Warrior
You better
Beware
