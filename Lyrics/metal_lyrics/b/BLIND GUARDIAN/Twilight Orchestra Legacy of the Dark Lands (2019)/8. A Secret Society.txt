[Temple Knight:]
So you return at last
And with nothing in hand
As it seems
But too late
And too little in strength
If you hoped for your friends
Though by now
You surely realized
They're gone
Not of concern, anymore
But what shall we do with you?
You appear different
Than those
We have just sent to hell

[Eve:]
Our friends
They were not

[Nicholas:]
Who?
Who the hell are you?
