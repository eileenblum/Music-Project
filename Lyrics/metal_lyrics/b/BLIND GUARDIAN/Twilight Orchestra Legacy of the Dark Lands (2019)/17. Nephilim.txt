Be aware
There's someone else inside
Nocturnal eyes are on the prey

You should realize
It's not on you
To turn this page
Just do as I say

Something is wrong here
But I don't know what it is
Still sense there's evil on its way

It's the twist of fate again
Nephilim

So walk with me
When the fire comes down
Fallen angel â son of man
Find a way
A glimmer of hope
Sail away
On the river of dreams
Save the age of innocence
Find a way
Redeem our souls

Still the clouds will burst
When fire breaks open the sky

If you all laid cold
Dead in barren lands

Would you understand
This life's been more than anything

Life's a dream
A dream
A dream
But who's the dreamer
One day you'll understand

A lie
Yet, no one knows
This road
One day you'll surely understand

This road's a lie
Yet no-one knows
Release the beast
We're all condemned
This road
This road reveals the great unknown

To speak the truth
We're all condemned
This road
It is your blood on my hands

It all goes down and
There's nothing I can really do

The great divide
No bridge there's no path
I've been there over yonder
There's no ending of the road
Nephilim

So walk with me
When the fire comes down
Fallen angel â son of man
Find a way
A glimmer of hope
Sail away
On the river of dreams
Save the age of innocence
Find a way
Redeem our souls

When the clouds will burst
A new age begins
Then
When the clouds will burst
Shall healing rain come

This road misleads us
You should know

This road
For aeons we have been condemned
This road
Oh, there's blood on my hand
Brother, dear

So walk with me
When hell fire breaks loose
Saving grace, old nephilim
Redeem our souls
Redeemer of souls
Come walk with us
When hellfire breaks loose
Saving grace, old nephilim
Come walk with me
When hellfire breaks loose
Saving grace
Redeem our souls
Redeemer of souls
