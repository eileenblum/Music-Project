[Lucifer:]
Imago dei
The meaning stays hollow and vague
Encrypted are these words of old
It is a play
An incensation for foolish dreamers
This age of not knowing is endless
Its reign is eternal

[Conquest:]
Thus, there is a way
There must be

[Lucifer:]
Disgraceful suffering
That might be to their liking

[Conquest:]
I was promised truth
But our league is broken

[Lucifer:]
Your passion for theseâ¦
These earth creepersâ¦
It is beyond compare
They still insist on blaming me
Though it is him
Who stole the light

[Conquest:]
I believed in the power of the throne
Yes, we once were protectors
Guardians
But that is long gone by
We are myth
Not more than a myth

[Lucifer:]
Go
Curse the world
For what we are
Is what we are
Our true nature is not of matter
Resistance shall be thine
Your wish
It shall be granted
This battle is not over, yet
