[Nicolas:]
My love

[Magdalena:]
Nicolas
How joy us
How long have I been dreaming?

[Nicolas:]
Not long my love
But think of it no longer

[The Queen of the South:]
Did you find it?
That heart of mine?

[Nicolas:]
What is this foul whispering?

[The Queen of the South:]
Still kept a secret eye upon you
It has been safe
Inside the tower's chamber

[Nicolas:]
This is not you speaking
It can't be
I mistook your passion for love

[The Queen of the South:]
I fear you did
However
The conquest is over
For I love thee not

[The Golden King:]
He is a dreamer
Let him be
