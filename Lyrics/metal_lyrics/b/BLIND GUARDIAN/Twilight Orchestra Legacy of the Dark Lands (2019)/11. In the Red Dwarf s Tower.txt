Well, what I've told you
I don't know it's for sure
Don't grieve Ophelia
And try not to breathe

It's not on me to say
For I will sit here
In my tower
I don't really care for
But I fear that
There will be a bitter end

Solomon
Solomon
Solomon

Join the last hour
Man's final hour

Here in my tower
Tower
You will be on your own
Here in my tower
Tower
You will be on your own
Here in my tower

Now move on forwards
You're dead end crawlers
You dead crawlers
You're dead
Crawlers
Now move on forwards
You dead end crawlers

I can sense your lies
'Cause I control your mind
It's such a strange delight
No doubt
You must be blind

Do you not see the dwarf
Dressed in red
Go back
Before the nothingness
Will take you
Be brave
Oh, He'll fool you all

All that matters
It won't matter
Let it shatter

There is calm before the storm
The moment of the gnome
Life
Is a never-ending crime
It's a never-ending lie
Let it shatter
The eyes of Ra gaze blindly
Worlds fade to black then
The faceless lord comes down

Solomon â Solomon â Solomon

The end of light
It's not the end of all time
Not the end of all things
You should know

You wouldn't believe
You surely would
What I've searched
What I've found

No need to know
Who's to blame
Come recognize my power
No longer deny me
Bow down
There's no need to pray

For you surely fall
There is no surrender
Now please the red dwarf
Yes, the red dwarf

First, I was a little insecure
But I don't think
That anyone or anything
Can ever be like me
Like me
Compete

I might be your darkest nightmare
I might carry deepest truth
I might be your deepest nightmare
I may be your doom

All that matters
Let it shatter
Let is shatter
It won't matter
Life
Is a never-ending crime
It's a never-ending lie
Let it shatter

There is science
There are rules
Redemption is for fools
Resolve the spell
Don't break it
World's dressed in black when
The faceless lord comes down

Solomon
Solomon
Solomon

I'd like to put it clear
In saying
You're all to burn
I just make up that pyre
To free you
From this burden
And your guilt
And guilt there is
In everyone
It's too late for her
I have to admit
Others will die
I think
Your choice
Choice there's no choice
In dark lands
And evil and sorrow
Will come out of this

Where do we go from here?
How will it end?
Is there anyone who knows?
How can we survive?

Just be aware
How stillness grows
Empty words
Can't fill this silence
All meaning is hollow
And vague

Sigh in my tower
Die

From the ashes
Still I'm afraid
There's nothing
Sigh
You'll soon be dead
