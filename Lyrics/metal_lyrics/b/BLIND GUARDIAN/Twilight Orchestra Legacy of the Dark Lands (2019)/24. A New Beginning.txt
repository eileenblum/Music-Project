[Storyteller 2:]
Hence home, you fearless warrior, protector of man. Get you home.
Just for a while. Seek in thyself and everywhere. The seal it must be broken. Revenge is sweet as it was before.
Words were grown false as roads have misled us all, but still the sacred heart beats deep within you. Conquest is yours, you are conquest. Go hence, there's time ahead granted, the bond's renewed, extend their suffering, thou cannot avoid it.
