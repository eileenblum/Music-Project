I'm wondering who you are
I've been a blind man
Though I have come too far
To fail again

Yes, I believed
I was more
I could heal her
Here in the dark
All her words turned clearer
Now as my time passes by
What would you do for me?

I'm the last
But soon I won't be
There's nowhere else to roam
I lived so many lives
It's over again

Why am I still here?
It's you
Oh, my fallen friend
Nothing can save me
I'm lost in his tower
A universe
It will die my dear

This stillness reminds me
Oh, it's too late now

Things are moving on
You're close now
So much closer

The leaves are falling
The leaves are falling

Dead leaves
They fall
Below me
The world that we know
It ends
Its end is near

The seeds conceived
Newborn shadows in the dark
Just remember it
Just remember its
The secret bloom
The harvester of souls
Guardian of the netherworld

Will you fulfill this last order?
My dear
The harvester's calling
A voice so severe
It will come down
It will come down

And there's no one left
But me
There's no way
I can bind you
Yes, there is no one
Left on the field
Yet, all the fools
They still believe

We're running away
There's nothing to say
A cosmic revolution

They're driven insane
We're bleeding the same
That's heaven's evolution

They bleed, bleed, bleed
For the order
They follow their leader
They follow their leader
They follow their leader
They follow the final command

A machine
So bizarre
It is lifeless
Unknown

We won't comprehend

This sacred heartbeat
It's the source
Of all evil in man

No need to condemn this
It's how nature has planned it
Will we ever know?
Will we ever know?
Will we ever know?

No one believes
It won't matter anymore
I cannot recall
I cannot recall
The sacred light
Won't shine here anymore
Guardian of the netherworld

If I went back
Ancient warrior
Would I believe
That we've failed the plan
We're all fooled the same

Go, where do you go?
Where do you go?
Where do you go from here now?

Cursed
We've been deceived
The winter king's crowned
War is coming to town
Most wondrous things revealed
Off the window falls
May 23rd â they will shiver
A miracle indeed

We have to feed
Sacred defender â
The angel of war
When the sun betrays
The mystic mind
The empire falls
By the blink of an eye

A lie
And everyone dies
A lie
Everybody must die

Dead eyes,
Oh, dead eyes
They stare
They search for the final frontier
Unified
Beyond the spheres
They lurk and wait

Where do you go?
Where do you go?
Where do you go from here?
Go
Where do you go?
Where do you go?
Where do you go from here?
Now
Where do you go?
Where do you go?
Now

Nothing has changed
Ever since
Man has fallen from grace
They love to be damned
For sure there's no master plan
Do you understand
There will be no second chance
When will you learn?
When will you understand?
When will you know?

Now kill the king
Silver bullet on its way
No, I don't regret
No, I don't regret
Your sacred eyes
They're closed forevermore
Guardian of the netherworld

Just don't look back and don't regret
What a fool you've been
Defenestration
A miracle
Indeed

Go
Where do you go?
Where do you go?
Where do you go from here?
Go
Where do you go?
Where do you go?
Where do you go from here?
Now
Where do you go?
Where do you go?

The golden king
The enemy
The harvester's coming
It all must end
Here and now
