Oh, he's movin' on coming home
Oh, he's movin' on coming home
He's been away too long
(Do I get any nearer)
(Do I get any nearer)

My intention's good, unleash the beast
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up
At least I'm trying
My mind, it tends to slip away
(This might be your last chance)
Search wisdom in a madman's gaze

Faces and places
(Far, far away)
Dark ages and pages
(It's all revealed to me)
Yet everything, it shall go down

Ages will go by,
Time goes by
There's no sound

The storm's gone by, this supernova
Defines a golden age
The dawning of a second sun
Will mark my dying day

Like a rolling stone
Let your senses roam
To another world
While the chains are on

Find this precious stone
Do not wait, my son
Leave this world you know
Find the key to be free

Will it ever be the same
Their bliss is gone away free
It will never be the same
They are a dying race

Oh, I'm marching on, carry on

This world will fade to grey, it's going down
Going down

Come along, come along with me
(We leave the ashes)
Come along, just follow me
We will meet the wizard
Come along, come along with me
He's the bearer of light
Come along, come along with me
He's the one to believe

While I head into the storm
There's no need to walk alone
Nor will I be on my own
'Cause he will be the one I know
Entangled forevermore
These wars we fight
Conceal all light
That's what I'm here for

Oh, I wonder why
I wonder how it all turned wrong
Somehow, I fear all magic's gone
You now conceive

This is the point of no return
Rise or fall of the old gods
This is the point of no return
Rise or fall again

I've come for blood, it's likely
That most of you despise me
The pharaoh's long gone
Now let my kingdom come

Yes, I'm the one who's sown the seven plagues
Now grow

This deed means trouble

Make sure there's no more magic, but black magic
No one else should know
We must obstruct their ways discretely

Take hold of the flame
Take part in my revenge
Now enter the storm
Take hold of the flame
And the bell chimes no more

It's time to kill the spark and
I think it's time to kill them all

Oh, watch the trial of men has begun
It has begun

We make them believe
Our reign lasts forevermore
No guiding light
No sacred life
The secret eye knows

Wake up, my friend now
Wake up, my friend now
The second sun appears
A new breeze, a new dawn, a new day
Tell them all

This is the point of no return
Rise or fall of the old gods
This is the point of no return
Rise or fall again

This is the point of no return
Rise or fall of the old gods
This is the point of no return
Rise or fall again

You think therefore you are
Now lay down your head and drowse
This silence will comfort you
So don't break this silence

We're gods on the run
We're gods on the run

I think therefore I am and
I'll enlighten you
But I fear that it's over now
