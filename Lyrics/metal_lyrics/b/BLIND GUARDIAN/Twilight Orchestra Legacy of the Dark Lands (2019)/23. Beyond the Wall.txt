There was nothing within these walls
A creature
Climbs down
Changes
Beyond the wall
Still
No relief
No relief

Let this story end
Let 'em drown
In endless misery

Where will I go?

Now I know
What I've been

The queen is calling

Come, come along
And break the seventh sign

What am I doing?

Oh, I can read
Between the lines
Where am I going?

Come
Look
Fear
Thee

The enemy
The enemy
Oh I know
Their time is at hand
Obedience
For sure
They will follow the plan
Still, I know
Their time is at hand
We build an asylum
Asylum
Silence everywhere
Time is on my hand
Still their time is at hand
War is the father of man

Rise after the fall
Arise
You will not fail anymore
There is honor within
This is what you shall be
We shape a future
We redeem it from sin

Then your deeds are forgiven
Just heed the call
It is one step to heaven
To rejoin with your kin

First in line now
Don't be a fool
Worlds collide
That's why destiny's calling

Beyond the wall
Transcend
Beyond the wall
Defend
Beyond the wall
They stand
Beyond the wall
They're damned

Now take a look at yourself
Re-unite
With your brothers
Ride
The rules are changing
What is it
You're longing for?
Is it deliverance?
Come speak the truth
Choice, there's no choice
In dark lands

Beyond the wall
Transcend
Beyond the wall
Defend
Beyond the wall
They stand
Beyond the wall
They're damned

So
Move on
And take it further
Worlds are falling apart
Your crusade
The strive for our future
There's still belief
A foul disease
Victorious archer
Triumph is yours
It shall be

Confess
You true deceiver
Just break the spell
Release us
Repeat the words
Redeem us
You faithful non-believer

Can't deny what I am
Still I long to be
The defender of man
I wait for an answer my friend
Can't find it in science
Science
Science
I don't care
Still their time is at hand
Can feel
Their time is at hand

The battle's won
But will there be peace?
Deep in the shadows of history
Sanctified
I carry on
Free will
I will march on
I carry on
From now on
Released from my destiny
Not chance, nor choice
Won't break the spell
There's
A long-forgotten path

Torn into piecesâ¦
Hold it all back
The sacred heart
Hide your secret well

Torn into pieces
And close the gate

You can't pass, no more
There's no key
And there's no door
Bid farewell
Then with the dark force
You have gathered
Burn in hell

Beyond the wall they stand
Beyond the wall they're damned
Beyond the wall they stand
Beyond the wall they're damned
Beyond the wall they stand
Beyond the wall they're damned
Beyond the wall they stand
Beyond the wall they're damned
Beyond the wall they're damned
Beyond the wall they're damned
