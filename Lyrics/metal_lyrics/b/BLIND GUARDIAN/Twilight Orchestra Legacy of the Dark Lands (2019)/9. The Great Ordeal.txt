For the day
We praise thy name
All glory
For the day
We're servants of the one
Now reveal
Unfold the untold story
Now reveal
The banner of the sun

We're children of the damned
True rulers of the land
Lies and shame
We've overcome
Our innocence is proved
It's evidence
We hold in hand
The order's bane must end

The old order
A new way
Yes, the order's clear
Yes, the order clears the way
Yes, the order's clear
We'll keep it alive
The secret's inside
We carry the light

Welcome to the great unknown
Welcome to the great unknown
Become a light in the darkness
All evil's defeat
Be one with the storm
Be one with the war machine
Stand brave
When the walls come down
Be one with destiny

Fools, don't you see
It all leads to misery

Soon we'll be free
Find release
Reclaim our integrity
Yet burnt at the stake
Their ideal's awake
It lives in us all
Sacred heart
No time for regrets
You just have to realize
Our brotherhood of man
Will come to heal these lands

Soon you may roam
Where darkness grows
Every move you make
Will lead you further
To a wondrous world
Of awe and beauty
You will see

Like a drop in the water
Like a drop in the water

All is one
Jerusalem
Solomon
The soldier of creed
The temple of light
In praise of the father
All praise
Transcend

Welcome to the great unknown
Welcome to the great unknown
Become a light in the darkness
All evil's defeat
Welcome to the great ordeal
Welcome to the great unknown
Stand brave
When the walls come down
Be one with the temple's law
The crucible of war

Fools, you're dismissed
You cannot get out of this
The tiding of hope
Has vanished
Like dust in the wind
Oh, we've got to keep faith
Then by the light of the day
And the grail
We will find another way
The order stays alive
It shall shine on
