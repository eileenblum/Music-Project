Call the wind, I hail thee
We sail on through the storm
There's fire in my mind, fire in my mind,
Fire in my mind, fire in my mind

There's no escape
And there's no return
The blood that flows behind us
It's the world outside
Tears you might be crying
But it's over now
For a high cost we come
So just keep your hate alive

The tides of war (the tides of war)
We've come to face it in these lands
We've come to face it in these lands
The Curse of FeÃ¤nor

No sorrow, no loss I count the ones behind
Come follow, don't turn your back and let them whine
The grief is real, the pain I feel
It's not what I've been longing for
They shall be free, they'll be released
They can't get over the sea

They were following in vain
Burning vessels, burning hope
Needless baggage on the road
Let them curse me, let them blame
They may have faced their journey's end

Boats at distant shore they burn
The wind still carries smoke
In Araman we've seen Teleri's work on fire
Across the ice, a flame
To take revenge, ashamed
Betrayed by the insane FeÃ¤nor

You've come too far, you've come to fail
FeÃ¤nor
All done in vain, by the oath
You delivered our doom

The tides of war (the tides of war)
We've come to face it in these lands
We've come to face it in these lands
The Curse of FeÃ¤nor

Boats at distant shore they burn
The wind still carries smoke
In Araman we've seen Teleri's work on fire
Across the ice, a flame
To take revenge, ashamed
Betrayed by the insane FeÃ¤nor

We've come too far, we've come to fail
FeÃ¤nor
Yet we have reached the promised land
Of FeÃ¤nor

The tides of war (the tides of war)
We've come to face it in these lands
We've come to face it in these lands
The Curse of FeÃ¤nor
