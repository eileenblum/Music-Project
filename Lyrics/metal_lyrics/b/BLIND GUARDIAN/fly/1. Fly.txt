Stop, be quiet now
Out with the light and,
Then up and down it goes
Fly out with the light
There at the door,
The Inspiration IÂ´ve looked for,
The Spirit of the youth appears

No one ever dares to speak
It's nothing else but fantasy
It's make believe, make believe

No one ever dares to speak
It's nothing else but fantasy
But One day it all will come to life

Step out of line
And I'll teach you how to fly
The Away weÂ´ll go
Leave your mark, leave your mark in the land of mine

The second one to the right
And then Straight on until morning light

Stop, be quiet now
No irritation
No not the slightest doubt

We go at once
Quick - We better hurry,
There from the road I sense
The end of fun gets near
Wonderful thoughts and imaginations
These dreams will lift you up

What is it like? You ask me, my dear
Will there be fairies, or things to fear
For fairies sake I'd say you better come with me
So soon youÂ´ll see,
Now up and down it goes and round
Round and round and round,

Praise to my cleverness
They all follow me,
All praise to innocence
That's everything it needs,
Fly in,
Fly out,
They leave it all behind

No one ever dares to speak
It's nothing else but fantasy
It's make believe,
Make believe
No one ever dares to speak
It's nothing else but fantasy
But One day it will all come to life

Step out of line
And I'll teach you how to fly
The Away weÂ´ll go
Leave your mark land of mine
Leave your mark in the land of mine

[Solo]

Life is a map and it is quite confusing
The lights are up now let the play begin
She flies, she flies,
Into the light she flies
No words like "ust" in mind
She's finding Neverland
There on the day she dies
Don't stop it now,
She still enjoys the scene
Don't stop it now,
Don't stop it now,
Don't stop it now,
Don't stop it now, now, now

No one ever dares to speak
It's nothing else but fantasy
It's make believe,
Make believe
No one ever dares to speak
It's nothing else but fantasy
But One day it will all come to life

Step out of line
And I'll teach you how to fly
The Away weÂ´ll go
Leave your mark land of mine
Leave your mark in the land of mine
