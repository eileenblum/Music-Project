[Special Edition Track]Believe what I'm saying.
We all await
the shattering mind of our saviour.
We live then we die.
I won't deny.
How can't you see my mind?

Fools to believe.
Now I run to the island.
The innocent in the end.
Now I'm falling.

From far beyond and everyone.
Hear now the lord of twilight.
Awaken them.
We passed, there's no one there.

You're trapped in my mind.
Ask for release.
Don't search for fine lines.
Ask for release.

In after-realms I fall down.
There's no sign of release.
I don't believe our saviour will not tell you.

Descending here and the whole world will cry again.
The fallen angel's time to rise.

Fear the man in the dark.
He is calling.
When shadows they reign on the field
their kingdom will come.
Fear the man in the dark.
He is calling.
When shadows they reign on the field
their kingdom will come.

Would you have to find for me
a song to be sung.
No more hiding, I can't find in it.
Oh, you will be my saviour.

I've conquered fear
and I know it's my inner sleeper.
Hit me, nail me, kill me, fear me.
I know it's my inner sleeper.

Shattering the forest.
Darknest soul to harvest.
Shattering the forest.
Darknest soul call my name.

In after-realms I fall down.
There's no sign of release.
I don't believe our saviour will not tell you.

Descending here and the whole world will cry again.
The fallen angel's time to rise.

Fear the man in the dark.
He is calling.
When shadows they reign on the field
their kingdom will come.
Fear the man in the dark.
He is calling.
When shadows they reign on the field
their kingdom will come.

[Guitar solo.]

I'm you.
You find me on your way.
There's nothing more to say.
You find me in travelling wake of the past.

Tales so wrong, they come from everywhere.
Now call the spirit of the past
and we will find its heart.

Descending here and the whole world will cry again.
The fallen angel's time to rise.

Fear the man in the dark.
He is calling.
When shadows they reign on the field
their kingdom will come.
Fear the man in the dark.
He is calling.
When shadows they reign on the field.
I'm the Dragon reborn.
