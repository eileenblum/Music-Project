When horizons seem dim and the starlight too cold
Echoes don't chime anymore 'cause there's no one left to hear them
Don't let you heart capsize in dismay, don't let your hope fade away
Take at look at yourself and realize there's more coming
From the future!

Day follows day, night follows night
Pick up your pride from wherever it may lay
Night follows night, day follows day!
Your step may falter, but the heart's right
Day follows day, night follows night!

If those whom you've loved once are now gone or dead
And their memory haunts you deep in the night
Embrace them one last time in your dream and smile,
Then turn your back to the past and walk away
Towards the future!
Day follows day, night follows night
Pick up your pride from wherever it may lay
Night follows night, day follows day!
Your step may falter, but the heart's right
Day follows day, night follows night!
Sadly, there is no end to this unfolding story,
The journey will last forever after we've been long gone
But behind are our sons who've looked towards the future
They know steps may falter but the heart's always right
Hail to the future!

Day follows day, night follows night
Pick up your pride from wherever it may lay
Night follows night, day follows day!
Your step may falter, but the heart's right
Day follows day, night follows night!
