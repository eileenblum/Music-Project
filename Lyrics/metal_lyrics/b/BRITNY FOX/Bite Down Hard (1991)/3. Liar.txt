[B. Childs, T. Paris]

Yakkin' like a hurricane, Baby
When no one's around
Give in big to the two time
you wanna get me down

Droolin' out the lies
Get the news out
All but sell your soul
Try to make you look good

Tell me to my face
Liar

Stickin' everybody when you want to
Slash 'em when their back is turned
Stickin' in your nose where it don't go
You're gonna have to learn

Runnin' up the bill
On your lie phone
All but to sell your soul
Try to make you look good
