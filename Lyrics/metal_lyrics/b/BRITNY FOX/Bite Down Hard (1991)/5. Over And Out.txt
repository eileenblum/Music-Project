[B. Childs, T. Paris]

Take an open road
I've come to see you again
Was time to leave it all behind us

Travelin' across the sky
Chasin' one more endless night
To another place in time where we all meet

It's time to say good-bye

When I see your smile
And your laughter fills my heart
Till my travelin' heart finds its way back home

It's time to say good-bye

Over and out

When I lose the time
And I start to slip away from you
A thousand miles away from the answer

Got an aching in my heart
When I dream of you
Reaching back in time to a memory

Over and out - time to say good-bye
Over and out - leaving you behind
Over and out - time to say good-bye
