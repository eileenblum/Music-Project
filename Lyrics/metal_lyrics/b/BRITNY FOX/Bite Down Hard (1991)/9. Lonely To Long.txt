[MK Smith, T. Paris]

Movin' to the sound
When she's only got the natural
Likes the rock music
Momma said, "shut your door"

Come alive in the night when she's tight
And then she's kicking out
I can see everything in my mind
She make me wanna shout

Talkin' about

I been lonely
Lonely too long
Lonely
Lonely too long

Throwin' down got the lights dim
Movin' it
I remember all the nights long ago
Think I'm losin' it

Come alive in the night when it's right
And then she's on my brain
I can see every move in my mind
She's got such a way

I need ya today
