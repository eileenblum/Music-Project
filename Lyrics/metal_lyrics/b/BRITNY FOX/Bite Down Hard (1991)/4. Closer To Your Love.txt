[B. Childs, T. Paris]

Steal a feel of your love
Because you give it to me
Cold heart healed
You spread your wings for me

Open arms wrap around
You now it's dead and gone
Change of weather I feel you now
I finally see the sun

And I'm movin' closer
Closer to your love
Movin' closer
Closer to your love

Nothin' more missin' now
From our love in the past
Feel you all closer to me
We're gonna make it last

Open arms wrap around
Holdin' back is dead and gone
Change of weather I feel you now
I finally see the sun...
