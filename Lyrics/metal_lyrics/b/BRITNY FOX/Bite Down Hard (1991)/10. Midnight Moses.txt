[Alex Harvey]

Hey
Hey, hey, hey

Underneath the green veranda
Singin' love songs for mad maranda

They call me the midnight Moses
Everything I touch is coming up roses

Hey
Hey hey hey

Tell me where I'm going
I got no way of knowin'
I wish I was a forest ranger
Danger danger danger

Hey,
Hey hey hey

I had an afternoon fever
And when I flew out to Geneva
I just took me a notion
To fly right across the ocean
