[B. Childs, T. Paris]

CD's on ten
Ooh you gotta drink a lot
Push you to the edge
If you wanna think a lot

Skirts hiked high

Don't you know the perfect scenery
Tonight make me everything I wanna be
Feel the electricity

Louder - cause you like it
Louder - cause you need it
Louder - only way to feel the same as me
Louder - cause you like it
Louder - cause you need it
Louder - give it up for me

Cutting into you
Take the knife willingly
Volume right through you
Other spaces no one sees

Legs so right
1st prize in my gallery
Tonight make me everything I wanna be
Feel the sexuality

She come a runnin'
She's such a usin' machine
She's got it comin'
She's got it comin' all the way for me
