[T. Paris, MK Smith, B. Childs, J. Dee]

Liplock warrior only got a story
Her laser lies cuttin' you through
Woman don't you waste it only wanna taste it
No-talk session for you

Sex-ya on the red line lookin' lookin' so fine
She's comin' again
Struttin' down a backstreet a walk that makes you wanna eat
Sweet-treat lover to lend for you--

Backbreak tales push you to the rails
Angel flyin' high in the sky
Underground terror taking her share
Get you baby everytime

Stadium sexpot she'll rock your sox off
Then she's runnin' your mouth
Listening to you
No clue - No clout

You tell the truth you tell a lie
Which one is it gonna be tonight?
You tell the truth you tell a lie
With you girl it's never black and white

Dazzle me later cut loose trader
Lashing nuclear tongue
Kickin' out slander losin' your gander
Shuttin' you off you're done

Thine sensation phony aberration drinkin' up all your lies
So cut me like a saw, love me like 2 girls and I let it slide

Never
