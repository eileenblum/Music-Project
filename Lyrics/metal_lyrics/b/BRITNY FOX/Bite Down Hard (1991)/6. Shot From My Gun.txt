[MK Smith, T.Paris]

Say you're gonna take me
Up and down your track it's up and back
Once around the block to show me
Everything you can do

You're promisin' the world to me
Sayin' "Just you wait and see"
Talk is cheap when all the guns
Are pointed down at you

It's true

Watchin' all the action from a ring side seat
My double barrel's gonna knock you off
Your feet

Shot from my gun
Baby take me higher
Shot from my gun
Don't call me a liar

You've got a live one
Runnin' through your open heart
Got your number waiting for the chance
To call you again

Sweating from the moments
Leading up to face the music
I call your bluff
And now it's time for a delivery

You're gonna see
