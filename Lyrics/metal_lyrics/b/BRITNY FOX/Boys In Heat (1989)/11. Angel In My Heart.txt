[D. Davidson]

Friday night I'm with the boys at a local bar
Walks in this girl, so divine, I think I'm gonna stay a while

She walked across the room with her high heels on
she let her hair on down down down
I felt I'd known her before, I think I'll ask her for
before she walks out the door

[Chorus:]
So baby don't go, don't go, an angel in my heart
So baby don't go, don't go you're an angel in my heart, yeah

I said take a seat on next to me, I think I need to see your smile
My heart's keepin' a beat with the record machine
as crazy as it sounds so far

I'd like to walk you home, I'd like to cheer you up
I'll be there to help you through
If you need to know, I'll be happy to show
so baby don't ever go

[Chorus]
