[D. Davidson]

There's a club that I go to, where this girl drives me wild
I fell for her right on sight, with a wink and her smile
I've been searching for a long time honey, for a girl like her
She's got what it takes for me to make my world

[Bridge:]
You're the girl that I need
You make me feel at ease
I'll satisfy all your needs

[Chorus:]
I got plenty, (he's got plenty) plenty of lovin' for you
Don't you know I've got plenty (he's got plenty) plenty of lovin' for you

She gave me her number, I said I'll give her a call
She's not just a hot little number, cause she's the belle, the belle of the ball
I've been thinkin' about you, every day and night
I'm gonna take you far away, to make your love feel right

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Lead]
