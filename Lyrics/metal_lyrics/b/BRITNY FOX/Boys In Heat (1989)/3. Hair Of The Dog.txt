[D. McCafferty, D. Sweet, M. Charlton, P. Agnew]

Heartbreaker soul shaker
I've been told about you
Steamroller midnight stroller
what they've been saying must be true

[Bridge:]
Red hot mama, velvet charmer
Times come to pay your dues

[Chorus:]
Now your messin' with a, a son of a bitch
Now your messin' with a son of a bitch

Talking jivey poison ivy
you ain't gonna cling to me
Man taker born faker
I ain't so blind I can't see

[Bridge]
[Chorus x2]
[Middle Break]
[Chorus]
