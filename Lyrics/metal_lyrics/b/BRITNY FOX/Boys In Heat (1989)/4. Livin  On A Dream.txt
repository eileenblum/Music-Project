[D. Davidson]

You see your face inside a mirror, tell me what you see
Chasing dreams you have to hold on, that's the way you do your thing, yeah

[Chorus:]
You're livin' on a dream, is what you do
Livin' on a dream, you hold on to
You're livin' on a dream, is what you choose

You say you want all the big lights, they said you're dreaming and laughed
Just hold on tight to what you're thinkin',
you're gonna reach it to a star, yeah

[Chorus]
