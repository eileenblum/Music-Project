[D. Davidson]

In the dark, there's a love that hides
Is it true, we are blinded by
Face the words, it's not in your eyes
Tell me now, that I'm the one for you, yeah

I'm alone again, deep inside, cold sets on in
Lurks the shade, on top our lives
Gotta know, if this love is gonna stop or go

[Bridge:]
Don't you know what I want?
Go go go
Don't you know what I want?

[Chorus:]
Cause I'm standin', standing in the shadows of love
Yeah I'm standin', standing in the shadows of love

In love, with a lying heart
Dressed in black, the shadows dark
Trapped inside, a love that cast, of shade
of a love that's gonna stop or go

[Bridge]
[Chorus x2]
[Lead]
[Chorus]
