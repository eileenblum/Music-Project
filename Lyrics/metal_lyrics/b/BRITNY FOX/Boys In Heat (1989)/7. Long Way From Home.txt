[D. Davidson]

Seemed so far away and don't know what I missed
You're my scattered skies and think of home I miss
I see your face in the distance, envision you at night
Miles of tears and pain, sometimes a lonely game

[Bridge:]
Rising sun, brightest star
Round the world, I love her
The end of time, for you girl
I'm comin'

[Chorus:]
My love's with you always, oh yeah
Long way from home

My love's with you even when I'm miles away
I left a kiss in your hand, just hold it tight and pray

[Bridge]
[Chorus x2]
[Lead]
[Chorus]
