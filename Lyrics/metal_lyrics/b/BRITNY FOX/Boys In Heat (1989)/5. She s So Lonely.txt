[D. Davidson]

[1st Verse:]
Baby baby, love for sale you can't buy me
You're so lonely, oh take me on on

[Bridge 1:]
Oh, oh take my hand
You said you want me in command
Oh, oh won't you calm down
Oh, please settle down

[Chorus:]
Cause she's so lonely, so lonely, so lonely
Cause she's so lonely she begged to me
I said she's so lonely, so lonely, so lonely
Cause she's so lonely she begged to me

Baby, baby, oh, switch me on on

[Bridge 2:]
Our love plays like a band
Sometimes you're used by vulture hands
Oh oh we want it now
Woa oh you need somehow

[Chorus]
