[D. Davidson]

Pulled up in the sunrise, your hometown
Gettin' packed and ready, your big city crowd

[Bridge:]
Cause these long and winding roads, roll on through my head
And now this song we sing cries loud for you

[Chorus:]
Cause it's a longroad, headin' your way
It's a longroad, a song will play
And we traveled many miles, just to see you smile
Cause it's a longroad, it's a longroad

See so many faces, time after time
Show me how you're feelin', tonight's your night

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Lead]
