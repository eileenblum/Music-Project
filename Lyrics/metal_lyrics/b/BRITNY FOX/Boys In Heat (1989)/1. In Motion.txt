[D. Davidson]

Downtown Philly went upstate New York
went across United States to L.A.
Back through Dallas, Texas now on the east
coast back in Philly where I was raised

[Chorus:]
Oh oh in motion, oh oh come join the band
Oh oh in motion, oh oh come join the band

Uptown Friday night lookin' for a good time
action, satisfaction tearin' up the night
Travellin' by airways makin' some big waves
wheels are turnin' faster we're on our way

[Chorus]
[Bridge]
[Lead]
[Chorus]
