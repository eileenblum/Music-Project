[D. Davidson]

You locked me out, just shut me down
Lives on a blade, there's no escape
It's cold outside, what did I do
You slipped away and left me stray

[Chorus:]
But where did your love love love run to, you left me stray
But where did your love love love run to, you left me stray

I kick myself, and scream and shout
Just open up, unlock the love yeah

[Chorus x2]
[Lead]
[Chorus]
