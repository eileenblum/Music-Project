[D. Davidson]

There's a place where souls where souls live on forever
There's a time where we all rest together, oh sometime

[Bridge:]
Feeling better, living better, yeah, I see the lights
There's a place where a light shines bright

[Chorus:]
Shine on, shine on, shine on, shine on

Peace on earth, spread love to your brother
Loved ones gone, in your heart they'll live on
live on and on

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Lead]
[Chorus]
