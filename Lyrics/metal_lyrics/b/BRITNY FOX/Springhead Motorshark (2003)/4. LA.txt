[Paris]

I remember a day
So high from all the world
That lay in front of me
And maybe I just don't deserve
To feel that much alive anymore

But I believe in you and I
Watching a million stars go by
I'm infatuated with L A

I remember a day
When lightening struck my heart
A second time
But those days are gone
And maybe I just don't deserve
To sing along anymore

But I believe in you and I
Watching a million stars go by
I'm infatuated with L A
