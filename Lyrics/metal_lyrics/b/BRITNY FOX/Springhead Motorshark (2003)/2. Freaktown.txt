[Smith / Paris]

Look at you
You're a fool and you're over
You're gone
Lost Paradise
Now you're going home

Freaktown
Come along for the ride
Freaktown
Where your dreams have all died

And you're fooling yourself
for the millionth time

Look at you
You're a tool and you're over
You're gone
Lost Paradise
Now you're going home

Freaktown
Come along for the ride
Freaktown
Where your dreams have all died
