[Childs / Paris]

[Luke 1:1]
Forasmuch as many have taken in hand
To set forth in order a declaration
of those things
which are most surely believed among us...

[1 Peter 1:4]
To an inheritance incorruptible,
And undefiled, and that fadeth not away
Reserved in heaven for you...

Blind eyes
Soul dies
It's gone far enough

Dead souls
Unfold
It's gone far enough
