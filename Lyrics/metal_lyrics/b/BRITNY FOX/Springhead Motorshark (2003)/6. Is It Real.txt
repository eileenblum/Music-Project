[Smith]

Tell me what you're doing
Tell me how it feels
Tell me what it seems like
Tell me is it real?

You know the way out
You know the truth
Your own reflections
Are telling you

Live for tomorrow
And for today
And in a little more time
You can hear me say

Tell me what you're doing
Tell me how it feels
Tell me what it seems like
Tell me is it real?

You know the answer
You hold the key
Can't wait for no one
Not even me

Live for tomorrow
And for today
And in a little more time
You can hear me say

Tell me what you're doing
Tell me how it feels
Tell me what it seems like
Tell me is it real?
