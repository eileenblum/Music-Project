[Childs / Paris]

Searching for my paradise
Scale the dolts and take flight
Flood my skull with luminescence
Reinvent my plight

Shine the light divine

Tear drop island magic breathing
Incense sweet - wrecked on wine
Visit the Valley Of The Dolls
Fuck my spirit right

Shine the light divine
Viking in my mind

Valley

Jubilee

Bigamy

Shine the light divine
Viking in my mind
Diazajesus fly

Valley Of The Dolls...
