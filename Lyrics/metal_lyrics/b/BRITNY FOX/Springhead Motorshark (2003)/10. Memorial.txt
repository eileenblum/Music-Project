[Childs / Paris]

Too much forgotten
And for much too long
You stole my song
It's gone

Where did all the time go?
Where did all my friends go?

No day can pass without a thought
Of you inside me
It's as though you're still alive here with me

Where did all the time go?
Where did all my friends go?

I won't forget you...
