[Paris]

Give me a moment to look at you
And freeze our time in this space
There's not a chance
that I'll forget your face

We both know our time was done
Just didn't want to say
But maybe there's nothing left
to throw away

And I see what you have done
There's no time - I carry on
But I'm the lonely one
I'm the lonely one

Lonely ones I feel it too
Lonely ones made a fool out of you
Lonely ones I feel the love of brothers

Lonely ones
Never heal you
Never treat you
I can wait forever

In just a moment I'll walk away
On my way to anywhere
These frozen days are stealing
all the air we breathe

We both know our time was done
Just didn't want to say
But maybe there's nothing left
to throw away
