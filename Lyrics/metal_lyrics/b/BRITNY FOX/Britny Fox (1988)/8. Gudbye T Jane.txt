[J. Lea, N. Holder]

Gudbuy t' Jane, gudbuy t' Jane she's a dark horse if she can
Gudbuy t' Jane, gudbuy t' Jane painted up like a fancy young man

She's a queen, can't you see what I mean
She's a queen, see see she's a queen and I know
She's alright, alright, alright, alright

[Bridge:]
I say she's so young, she's so young [x3]

I said gudbuy t' Jane, gudbuy t' Jane. Get's a kick from her forties trip boots
Gudbuy t' Jane, gudbuy t' Jane has a maid to match up her suits

[Bridge]

Gudbuy t' Jane, gudbuy t' Jane like a dark horse see how she ran
Gudbuy t' Jane, gudbuy t' Jane sneaks on me cause she knows she can

See see see see see she's a queen and I know
