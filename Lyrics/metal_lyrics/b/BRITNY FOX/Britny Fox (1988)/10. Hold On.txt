[D. Davidson]

Hold on, better hold on baby
Hold on, you make me sweaty
Hold on, you drive me crazy
Hold on, you look mean so sexy
Hold on, oh you've got a good grip
Hold on, oh honey don't slip
Hold on, hold on to love
Hold on, hold on to love

[Chorus:]
Hold on, hold on, hold on to love
Hold on, hold on, hold on to love

Hold on, better hold on real tight
Hold on, I'm gonna rock you all night
Hold on, your lips are skin tight
Hold on, you kiss and bite
Hold on, they won't unhitch
Hold on, hold on to love
Hold on, hold on to love

[Chorus]
