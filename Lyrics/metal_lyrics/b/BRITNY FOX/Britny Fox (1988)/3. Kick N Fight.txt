[D. Davidson, T. Destra]

When your down and feeling low
and there ain't no place to go
Just put your mind in second gear
say I'm out of here
When your friends bring you down
and there ain't no one around
You scream out loud
at the top all you want is out

[Chorus:]
Kick 'n' fight tonight
Just kick 'n' fight that's right
Kick 'n' fight

Now you know how to hang tough
say man that wasn't rough
Well in your mind there's nothing to fear
now you're in gear
One bite from the fox
you'll know it's time to rock
Get off your seat and on your feet
and you they won't beat

[Chorus]
[Lead]
[Chorus]
