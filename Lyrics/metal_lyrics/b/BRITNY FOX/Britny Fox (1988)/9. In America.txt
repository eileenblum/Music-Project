[D. Davidson]

A place we could live, you know of it
It's a rocking place you all show it
If you want some fun, well come right over
It's a place to be, we all know that

[Bridge:]
We just want to tell you about it so you don't miss out

[Chorus:]
In America, the home of the free, the strong and the weak
In America, a young child's heart, just give em' a start
...in America

Now that we told you about it you just scream and shout and you're proud of it

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

In America, the home of the free, the strong and the weak
In America, a young child's heart just give 'em a start
In America, the families we love the man up above
In America, a place we'll grow and grow to be old
in America

[Lead]
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
