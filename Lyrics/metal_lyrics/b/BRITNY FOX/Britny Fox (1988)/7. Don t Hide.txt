[D. Davidson]

If you're down in the dumps we'll lend a hand
You can rely on us we'll take command

[Bridge:]
You won with all the glory, you stood right by our side
You don't need a place to hide

[Chorus:]
Don't hide, we're on your side, we'll stand by your side
So don't hide

Just stand right by my side you'll learn to fight
Well alright
Just lift your head up high you have the right

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
