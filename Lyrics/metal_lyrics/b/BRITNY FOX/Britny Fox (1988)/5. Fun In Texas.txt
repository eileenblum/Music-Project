[D. Davidson]

A bit of Texas in my veins, I think I'm goin, goin insane
A cow girl knocking at my door, oh baby just give me a roar
Rocking out the Alamo, San Antonio just give me a yo
I love Texas oh I do, in Texas

[Chorus:]
Where the fun is, out in Texas
Where the fun is, out in Texas

Round up the kids in town, tell em that I'm coming down
All the fun, the mid-day sun no crimes, the sheriff's gun
I love Texas oh I do, in Texas

[Chorus x2]
[Lead]
[Chorus]
