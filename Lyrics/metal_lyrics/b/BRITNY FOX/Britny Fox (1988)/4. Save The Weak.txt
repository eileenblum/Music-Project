[D. Davidson]

Take a look at what you have, and the things you own
And thank God that you've grown
Children starving and lonely, no place to go
I really feel that there's hope

[Bridge:]
Feelin' bad I'm feeling sad, let's lend a helping hand

[Chorus:]
Oh save, oh save, save the weak
With a little love, that's all they need

All the love in your heart and the love inside
A people cruel and cold yeah
Children starving and lonely, no place to go
I really feel that there's hope

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Lead]
[Chorus]
