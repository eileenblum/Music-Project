As the time goes by in days of grey
And the moment's right to leave my life in the end

Wish to escape from the earth
Fly to the stars still high above
Close to loathing this given time
I wish to escape from the earth
Next to the stars, the ones I loved
Finally leaving my world behind

As my life runs by, it's hard to cry
'Cause now my tears run dry, my fading light lost to shine

Wish to escape from the earth
Fly to the stars still high above
Close to loathing this given time
I wish to escape from the earth
Next to the stars, the ones I loved
Find me leaving my world behind

I wish to escape from the earth
Fly to the stars still high above
Close to loathing this given time
I wish to escape from the earth
Next to the stars, the ones I loved
Find me leaving my world behind

As the time goes by in days of grey
And the moment's right to leave my life in the end
