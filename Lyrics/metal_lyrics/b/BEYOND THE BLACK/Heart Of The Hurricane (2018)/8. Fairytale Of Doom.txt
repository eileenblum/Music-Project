Blinded by gold and blinded by diamonds
I let you chain me in silk
You told me lies, I drowned in your eyes
And in all those castles you built

Silver the doors and golden the cages
Nothing was quite as it seemed
And when I realized, you turned the key
And I saw your eyes full of greed
It was too late when I screamed

Once upon a time this love was true
And I tied myself to you
We spoke vows to last forever, oh
Once upon a time I lived a dream
I got blinded by your scheme
Still my vows hold me forever
In a fairy tale of doom

Feeding on nightmares, stealing my terror
You enjoy keeping me here
I feel it slipping, I see it dripping
Like blood and tears you drink fear

Silver the doors and golden the cages
Nothing was quite as it seemed
And when I realized, you turned the key
And I saw your eyes full of greed
It was too late when I screamed

Once upon a time this love was true
And I tied myself to you
We spoke vows to last forever, oh
Once upon a time I lived a dream
I got blinded by your scheme
Still my vows hold me forever
In a fairy tale of doom

Riven my soul and riven my senses
I feel my spirits recede
Dying imprisoned, last of my visions
Your burning eyes full of greed
It was too late when I screamed

Once upon a time this love was true
And I tied myself to you
We spoke vows to last forever, oh
Once upon a time I lived a dream
I got blinded by your scheme
Still my vows hold me forever
In a fairy tale of doom
