Forgotten doesn't mean forgiven
I feel sinister eyes
Embraced with fear I dare to wonder
If love's a lie

A yelling choir breaks the silence
Where peace seemed to prevail
How long am I to stand another bale?

Too much time I locked the truth away
Too much time until my judgement day

Can you hear the echo,
Can you hear the echo from the past?
Can you hear the echo,
Arisen from an ancient vast?
Can you hear the echo?
And I'm letting go, the die is cast
I've got to face a dark arcanum
Am I the one to breathe my last?
Can you hear the echo from the past?

Forgotten doesn't mean forgiven
No more I have a choice
It screams at me all day and night
The omniscient voice

My demons journeyed through the ages
They haunt me in my dreams
May I surrender to my destiny

Too much time I locked the truth away
Too much time until my judgement day

Can you hear the echo,
Can you hear the echo from the past?
Can you hear the echo,
Arisen from an ancient vast?
Can you hear the echo?
And I'm letting go, the die is cast
I've got to face a dark arcanum
Am I the one to breathe my last?
Can you hear the echo from the past?

And when the light of hope surrounds me
I can't escape the undertow
Drawing me back into the dark from long ago
There will be no more sweet tomorrow
No more savior on my way
I invoked the nightmares of my yesterdays

Can you hear the echo,
Can you hear the echo from the past?
Can you hear the echo,
Arisen from an ancient vast?
Can you hear the echo?
And I'm letting go, the die is cast
I've got to face a dark arcanum
Am I the one to breathe my last?

Can you hear the echo?
Can you hear the echo?
Can you hear the echo from the past?
