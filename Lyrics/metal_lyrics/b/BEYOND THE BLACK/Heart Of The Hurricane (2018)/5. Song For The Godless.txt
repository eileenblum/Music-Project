Sing me a song for the voiceless
A song for our daughters and sons
Sing me a song of our heroes
So long since gone

And time after time
And night after night
We're still here in the dark
And day after day
We're not fading away
Till the dawn

Will you join me singing this song
All the godless heroes are gone
Singing, oh-oh-oh
Singing, oh-oh-oh
Will you find me
Give me your heart for this sorrow
Tears me apart
Singing, oh-oh-oh
Singing, oh-oh-oh
And godless we are

Sing me a song of the nameless
Of thieves and of beggars like us
Sing me a song of the last ones
Forgotten sons

And time after time
And night after night
We're still here in the dark
And day after day
We're not fading away
Till the dawn

Will you join me singing this song
All the godless heroes are gone
Singing, oh-oh-oh
Singing, oh-oh-oh
Will you find me
Give me your heart for this sorrow
Tears me apart
Singing, oh-oh-oh
Singing, oh-oh-oh
And godless we are
