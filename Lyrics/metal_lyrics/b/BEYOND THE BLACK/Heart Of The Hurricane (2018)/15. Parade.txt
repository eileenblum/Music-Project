I face it each morning
I see myself and wonder why
The mirror would haunt me
And wants to show the things I hide

I feel like I'm naked
And the world is watching to the bone
Consuming my power
And it sometimes feels - I'm on my own

We hide behind
Facades of light
That leave us blind

Don't wanna walk the parade
Don't wanna be in the race
I don't wanna walk the parade
Don't wanna be someone, be someone else
Don't touch me, don't change me
I wanna be who I am
Don't want to walk the parade

We serve and deliver
And claim to be the justified
Our values are shattered
While we surrender our pride

We hide behind
Facades of light
That leave us blind

Don't wanna walk the parade
Don't wanna be in the race
I don't wanna walk the parade
Don't wanna be someone, be someone else
Don't touch me, don't change me
I wanna be who I am
Don't want to walk the parade

I don't wanna give in
I don't care what they think
If anything is real then love is
There is a world full of joy
And it's easy to share
Just be yourself and feel what I feel

Don't wanna walk the parade
Don't wanna be in the race
I don't wanna walk the parade
Don't wanna be someone, be someone else
Don't touch me, don't change me
I wanna be who I am

Don't wanna walk the parade
Or be in the race
I don't wanna walk the parade
Don't wanna be someone, be someone else

Don't wanna walk the parade
Don't wanna be in the race
I don't wanna walk the parade
Don't wanna be someone, be someone else
Don't wanna walk the parade...
