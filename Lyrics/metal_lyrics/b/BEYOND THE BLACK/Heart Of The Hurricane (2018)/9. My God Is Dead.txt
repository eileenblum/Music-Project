I walked across the desert a thousand miles
And every second cost me a thousand lives
And I close my eyes, and I pay the price
When all of nature's beauties wore off and died
You promised me the heavens would make it right
And I closed my eyes and trusted your lies

(My God is dead!)
I catch you, my soul and my heart
(My God is dead!)
While you left us lost in the dark
(My God is dead!)
You preyed on our faith and I gave you my life
(My God is dead!)
You promised me heaven instead
My God is dead

I watch as all our loved ones return to dust
The world we used to live in it drowns in rust
But I close my eyes and turn to the skies
With all the souls you gave us, with all those tears
You didn't try and stop it in all those years
You heard all those cries but you closed your eyes

(My God is dead!)
I catch you, my soul and my heart
(My God is dead!)
While you left us lost in the dark
(My God is dead!)
You preyed on our faith and I gave you my life
(My God is dead!)
You promised me heaven instead
My God is dead
My God is dead

And soon there will be silence
The last of all to come
But you will still remember
When we will all be gone
You'll hear my voice forever
The light in you reversed
Forsaken, betrayed in our trust

(My God is dead!)
I catch you, my soul and my heart
(My God is dead!)
While you left us lost in the dark
(My God is dead!)
You preyed on our faith and I gave you my life
(My God is dead!)
You promised me heaven instead
My God is dead
My God is dead
My God is dead
