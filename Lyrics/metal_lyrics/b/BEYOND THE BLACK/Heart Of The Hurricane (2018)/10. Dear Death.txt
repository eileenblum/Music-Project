In the minute, when you take my breath away
Forever, I fall into the silence of my fear
I'm pretending, I will be here anyway
Forever, but deep inside I know it isn't real

Let me live inside my memory
To reunite the fate
Just for a little moment
I need a place where we all meet again

You can't take away the meaning of it all
You can't take away the feeling that I keep deep in the core
We are anchored in the center of our souls
You can't take away the love, we won't...
Regret what we have hoped

In the minute, when my day turns into night
Forever, my life is passing quickly once again
I'm descending, while my spirit turns to light
And forever, and my moon is slowly rising in the end

I hope I live inside my memory
Of the ones that I have loved
And sometimes for a moment
We touch when our realities collide

You can't take away the meaning of it all
You can't take away the feeling that I keep deep in the core
We are anchored in the center of our souls
You can't take away the love, we won't...
Regret what we have hoped

You can't take away the meaning of it all
You can't take away the feeling that I keep deep in the core
We are anchored in the center of our souls
You can't take away the love
And we won't regret what we have hoped

You can't take away the meaning of it all
You can't take away the feeling that I keep deep in the core
We are anchored in the center of our souls
You can't take away the love
We won't regret what we have hoped
