I sustained your words to the world
Refused to question your deeds
Recalled your wounded honesty
And your integrity was to be sealed

I lost it all, but not my belief
Practised wealth and poverty
And if one thing in life is certain
In death weâll find equality

Now I will be the light to raise your hope inside
Until you know how it really feels
How can someone believe we cannot make it real
How can we find something that heals
The wound so deep
The wound so deep

When freedom fails and love is banned
How can this hope be wrong
In times of death and suffering
We tumble in the storm

You claim to cure with punishment
And say that god is yours
But in the end weâre all the same
The wealthy and the poor

Now I will be the light to raise your hope inside
Until you know how it really feels
How can someone believe we cannot make it real
How can we find something that heals
The wound so deep
The wound so deep

We know death will come but another age dawns and in silence weâll remain
I go where another stream flows but my faith will be the same
Hope will come and together weâll bear to fight against the odds
And we heal
The wound so deep
The wound so deep

I sustained your words to the world
Refused to question your deeds
Now I will be the light to raise your hope inside
Until you know how it really feels
How can someone believe we cannot make it real
How can we find something that heals
The wound so deep
The wound so deep
