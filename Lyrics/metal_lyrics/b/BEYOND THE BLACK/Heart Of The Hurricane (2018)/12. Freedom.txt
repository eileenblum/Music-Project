My own free will, my way of being
In this twisted heart of mine
We're traveling from far to see it
Reminds me of a cast out youth
That's urging to rebloom
An ocean filled with prosperous souls
Grown in the light of the moon

Can you hear me?
I'll be your voice
Please come to join me tonight

As far as I can see, it happens here tonight
These fields of liberty are melting space and time
Another year goes by, another piece of mine
I'm coming home to see my hopes and dreams
Rebuilt and redefined

Freedom!
Freedom!

A place like this, a soul asylum
For a blackened heart like mine
Now I know that it exists
(Don't let it go)
I'm coming home to walk these fields
And push away my griefs
I'm coming home to energize me
And stand up for my being

Can you hear me?
I'll be your voice
Please come to join me tonight

As far as I can see, it happens here tonight
These fields of liberty are melting space and time
Another year goes by, another piece of mine
I'm coming home to see my hopes and dreams
Rebuilt and redefined

Freedom!
Freedom!

And when the darkness takes the light
It feels like something sets me free
I lose my solitary life
And when my worry disappears
I see the beauty and the beast

As far as I can see, it happens here tonight
These fields of liberty are melting space and time
Another year goes by, another piece of mine
I'm coming home to see my hopes and dreams
Rebuilt and redefined

As far as I can see, it happens here tonight
These fields of liberty are melting space and time
Another year goes by, another piece of mine
I'm coming home to see my hopes and dreams
Rebuilt and redefined

Freedom!
Freedom!
