Did you ever feel like the only one sane in this world
Did you look around in this theater of the absurd
Feeling doomed with the rest of us, watching the powerful prey
On the hopeless and weak every day

Just scream (Just scream) For me (For me)
Come shout at this madness to set yourself free
Just scream (Just scream) For me (For me)
Scream out and destroy what they want you to be

(Oh) Just scream for me
(Oh) Scream for me

Do you hear the sound of guns shooting the innocent down
Do you see the values we honored now smashed to the ground
Feeling doomed with the rest of us, watching the free world go dark
And the terror is piercing your heart

Just scream (Just scream) For me (For me)
Come shout at this madness to set yourself free
Just scream (Just scream) For me (For me)
Scream out and destroy what they want you to be

Did you ever feel like the only one sane in this world
Did you look around in this theater of the absurd

Just scream (Just scream) For me (For me)
Come shout at this madness to set yourself free
Just scream (Just scream) For me (For me)
Scream out and destroy what they want you to be
