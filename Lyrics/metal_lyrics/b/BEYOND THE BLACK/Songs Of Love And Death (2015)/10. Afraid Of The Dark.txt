Every night, I try to run, but in vain
Anytime I stop, it all starts again
In the shadows I cast | Silhouettes of the past
Every day, I lie and say that Iâm cured
Even though I know theyâre just empty words
If thereâs nowhere to turn | Am I destined to burn?

Who is | My salvation
When | No oneâs aware Iâm at war

[Chorus:]
Under this skin | I feel a stranger, her sadness and her rage!
Under this skin | I hear her screaming and rattling her cage!
Fight her! Fight it! | Iâm afraid of the dark!
Fight her! Fight it! | Iâm afraid of the dark!
Fight her! Fight it! | Iâm afraid of the dark inside me!

Every year, I pray that Iâll be released
On my knees, I beg and plead for some peace
And the answerâs the same:
Iâm consumed by her flames

Who is | My salvation
When | No oneâs aware Iâm at war

[Chorus]

Give me the light that I need to defeat the dark!
Give me the light that I need to escape!

If we | Cursed instead of | Blessed,
Help me | Lay us | Both to | Rest

[Chorus]
