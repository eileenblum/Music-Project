Now weâre standing here together
At the crystal borderline
All my memories are shattered
Nothingâs left of what was mine
Iâm tryinâ to hold you
But you slip away
A candle cannot burn forever
To whom am I to pray

[Chorus:]
Up we rise | Into the night
Weâll never die | In the shadows
We can break | Out of these days
Darkness will blaze | In the shadows
Our kingdom will come
When our dreams can grow wild
Up we rise | Into the night
Weâll never die | In the shadows

Itâs so hard to kill the demons
When they live inside your heart
Donât give up to find your fortune
When you donât know where to start
So come here and take me
Iâm already gone
In a second life beside you
Is where I want to belong

[Chorus.]

Up we rise | Up we rise | In the shadows

[Chorus.]
