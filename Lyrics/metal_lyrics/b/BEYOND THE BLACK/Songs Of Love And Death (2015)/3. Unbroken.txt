When the shades grow deeper
And the darkness reaches out
When the night comes crawling
And the silence grows too loud
When the past wonât fade away
Nothing left to win
I have all my soul to give
I will not give in

[Chorus:]
Iâm unbroken
Iâll spread my wings
Fly above the winter winds
Iâm unbroken
I wonât give in
To the realms of
Heavenly Kings
Hear the songs the angel sings
Iâm unbroken
Iâll spread my wings
Fly above the winter winds

Every heartbeat, every breath
Will show my will to fight
Every scar upon my skin
A path into the light
When the past wonât fade away
Nothing left to win
I have all my soul to give
I will not give in

[Chorus 2x]
