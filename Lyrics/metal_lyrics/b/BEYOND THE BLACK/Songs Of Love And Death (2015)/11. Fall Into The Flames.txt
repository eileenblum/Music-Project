The darkest night | Canât close my eyes
Sleep is weak | Iâm hypnotized
Itâs do or die... | I feel your heat

I think itâs time to tear through these chains

[Chorus:]
Weâre gonna fall into the flames
And everglow
Yeah weâre gonna fall into the flames
I feel the smoke
Breathe it in
We canât stop, thereâs no running
Canât stop, almost burning
Fall into the flames
And everglow, youâre my everglow

I see the fire spread
Two silhouettes
Sinking deep, inside my chest is a world below
They say weâre self-destructing
But hell we gotta do something
Nothing oh nothing
Doin' nothing
Is never gonna break through these chains

[Chorus]

Tonight weâre raging inside
All we know, all we know tonight
Is that weâre raging inside
Inside | Inside

The darkest night
Canât close my eyes
Sleep is weak

[Chorus 2x]
