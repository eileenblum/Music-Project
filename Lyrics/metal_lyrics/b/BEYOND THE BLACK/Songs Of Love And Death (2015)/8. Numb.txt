[Chorus 1:]
Incipe memoriam | Incipe abicere
Desiste ab memoria | Let me go numb
Omitte nunc dolores | Quid agis nihil moror
Retineri non possum | Let me go numb

You were so good a liar
And I was so in love | That I invited in the pain
I had to learn with fire | After a flame is snuffed
Only the ashes still remain

[Chorus 2:]
Now that I finally see you
As you are | Must I be forced to see you
In every scar?

[Chorus 1]

Practicing blackest magic
You cast a spell on me
That even today is hard to break
While it was turning tragic
Part of me stayed deceived
Part me clung to my mistake

[Chorus 2]
[Chorus 1]

If Iâm to survive | Make a new life
I need to become | Totally numb

[Chorus 2 2x]
[Chorus 1]
