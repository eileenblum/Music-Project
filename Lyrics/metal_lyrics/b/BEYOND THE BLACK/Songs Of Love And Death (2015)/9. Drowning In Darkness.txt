Like a fallen leaf my life turns light to grey
And the golden rays of daylight fade away
Nothing left I wouldnât give for one more day
For one second I could hope that you might stay
Iâm not getting on | You kept me strong
Every single day I die

[Chorus:]
Iâm drowning in darkness | (Forever)
Forsaken behind these eyes
The demons of nightfall | (Forever)
Awaken behind these eyes
And soon they will harvest
The spark of life behind these eyes

You will break me apart | I am lost in the dark [2x]

In the whisper of the night youâre still with me
In the shades of morning light youâre all I see
And the rage within my tears wonât find a way
I canât help but search for hope that you might stay
Iâm not getting on | You kept me strong
Every single day I die

[Chorus]

Not long ago, you told me to be strong for you | (Strong for you)
But since youâre gone, thereâs nothing to hold on

[Chorus]

Behind these eyes
You will break me apart | I am lost in the dark [2x]

Like a fallen leaf my life turns light to grey
And the golden rays of daylight fade away
