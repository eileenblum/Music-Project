Drown into | These hands of fate
Without a sound | And celebrate
Shininâ like | The brightest skies
Cross your hearts | And keep the faith
Look into the mirrorball
Loose everything | And take it all
Sing hallelujah and encore
Forevermore

We run | Into the unknown
Far from | What they call life
Somewhere | Must be another aim

One day | Weâll come together
Under | A beautiful sign
Every dream | Is one night away

[Chorus:]
Sing! | Hallelujah | "Sing! | Hallelujah | Sing! | Hallelujah
Celebrate the night
Sing! | Hallelujah | Sing! | Hallelujah | Sing! | Hallelujah
Forevermore

Meet me | Beyond in the twilight
Million | Lifetimes ago
Then our | Imprisoned minds unfold

Night flight | across endless meadows
Bonfires | Arrows and bows
We found us and it feels like home

[Chorus 2x]

Look into the mirrorball
Loose everything | And take it all
Sing hallelujah and encore
Forevermore
