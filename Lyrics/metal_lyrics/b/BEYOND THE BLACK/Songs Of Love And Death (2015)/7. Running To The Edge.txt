Winter winds are cold and heartless
A lonely whisper in the darkness
Wait for me beyond the shades
âCause in this world Iâm bound to fade
Leave a trail for me to find
I will leave this world behind

[Chorus:]
I am running, running, running to the edge
Racing off the silver ledge
Running, running, running to the edge
Iâll take you away, Iâm gonna take you away
I am running, running, running to the edge
Find the door and break the catch
Running, running, running to the edge
Straight to the edge, youâre going straight to the edge
Of the world, of the world, of the world
Running to the edge

All I am and all I cared for
All my restless soul was there for
Somewhere far, too far to feel
And nothing more is left to steal
Send a sign for me to find
I will leave this world behind

[Chorus 2x]
