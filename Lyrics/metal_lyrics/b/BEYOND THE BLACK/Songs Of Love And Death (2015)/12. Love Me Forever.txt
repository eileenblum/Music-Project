[originally by MotÃ¶rhead]Love me forever or not at all
End of our tether, backs to the wall
Give me your hand, donât you ever ask why
Promise me nothing, live âtil we die

[Chorus:]
Everything changes, it all stays the same
Everyone guilty, no one to blame
Every way out, brings you back to the start
Everyone dies to break somebodyâs heart

We are the system, we are the law
We are corruption, worm in the core
One of another, laugh âtil you cry
Faith unto death or a knife in your eye

[Chorus]

Love me or leave me, tell me no lies
Ask me no questions, send me no spies
You know loveâs a thief
Steal your heart in the night
Slip through your fingers, you best hold on tight

[Chorus]
