When the night shapes secret dreams
that I cannot change
When the moon weaves tender silk to veil the day
Then I know youâll make the magic feel so alive

When the stars send gentle words I wish I could say
Then I hear your heart a thousand miles away
You are always in my dreams, my reason to live
You are always in all my dreams, my reason to give

[Chorus:]
You are my pearl in a world of dirt
I will be yours forever
You are my flame, my heat, my spark
Like a fire in a world so dark
You are my pearl in a world of dirt
This love cannot be measured
Youâre my escape from a world of hurt
My delight in a world absurd
Youâre my pearl in a world of dirt

When your heart began to sleep I wished I could pray
When your soul went up to start her final way
I woke up to find my world no longer alive

When the stars speak gentle words I wish I could say
Look into my eyes a million miles away
âCause Iâm still here in your dreams, your reason to try
And I know here in my dreams our love will survive

[Chorus]

Youâre my pearl in a world of dirt
