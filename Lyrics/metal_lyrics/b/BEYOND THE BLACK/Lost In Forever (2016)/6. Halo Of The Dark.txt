Dreams of eternity used 
To fill our endless days 
Spent in serenity in a never ending blaze 
Strangers in heaven, a glimpse at the stars 
Lost in insanity, nothing left but our love

The night falls around us 
May your kiss light up my heart 
Under the halo, under the halo of the dark 
The nightmares, they found us 
May your love be our ark 
Out of the halo, out of the halo of the dark 
May love be our ark 
To break out of the dark

Who knows their destiny 
We will meet it side by side 
Reaching for clarity 
Our passion burning bright 
Strangers in hell, all is lost, all is gone 
Nothing but enemies 
You're the spark to keep me strong

The night falls around us 
May your kiss light up my heart 
Under the halo, under the halo of the dark 
The nightmares, they found us 
May your love be our ark 
Out of the halo, out of the halo of the dark 
May love be our ark 
To break out of the dark

Dreams of eternity 
Used to fill our endless days 
We'll meet our destiny 
In the angels? golden haze

The night falls around us 
May your kiss light up my heart 
Under the halo, under the halo of the dark 
The nightmares, they found us 
May your love be our ark 
Out of the halo, out of the halo of the dark 
May love be our ark 
To break out of the dark
