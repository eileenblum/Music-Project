Though I shut the box 
Still I hear it 
One voice through the lock 
In its song, a prophecy 

Why must it haunt me 
Why does it want me 

Every night, I'm drawn to the music 
Drawn into a heaven in hell 
Every day, I try not to choose it 
To refuse a heaven in hell 

Lost and found in its arms 
Lost and found in its arms 
Lost and found in its arms 
Lost and found in its arms 

Each note tells a tale 
Yet unwritten 
I breathe, it exhales 
Warning in its melody 

Why must it haunt me 
Why does it want me 

Every night, I'm drawn to the music 
Drawn into a heaven in hell 
Every day, I try not to choose it 
To refuse a heaven in hell 

Lost and found in its arms 
Lost and found in its arms 
Lost and found in its arms 
Lost and found in its arms 

Why must it haunt me 
Why does it want me 

Every night, I'm drawn to the music 
Drawn into a heaven in hell 
Every day, I try not to choose it 
To refuse a heaven in hell 

Lost and found in its arms 
Lost and found in its arms 
Lost and found in its arms 
Lost and found in its arms
