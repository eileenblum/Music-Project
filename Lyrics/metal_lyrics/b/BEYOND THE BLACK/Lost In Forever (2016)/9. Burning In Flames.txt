How am I to put out 
What is stealing the life from me 
And it isn't even trying 

How am I to shut out 
What I know is a guarantee 
That one of us is dying 

If I'm out of time â in too deep 
I'm giving in to it, I'm 

Burning up, burning down to the ground 
An inferno untamed 
Burning up, breaking free to be bound 
Burning up in a flame 

Burning up, burning down to the ground 
An inferno untamed 
Burning up, breaking free to be bound 
Burning up in a flame 

How am I to keep out 
What's invited into my soul 
Like a too familiar stranger 

How am I to creep out 
From the shadow of its control 
When I enjoy the danger 

If I'm out of time â in too deep 
I'm giving in to it, I'm 

Burning up, burning down to the ground 
An inferno untamed 
Burning up, breaking free to be bound 
Burning up in a flame 

Burning up, burning down to the ground 
An inferno untamed 
Burning up, breaking free to be bound 
Burning up in a flame

If all that I am 
Is ashes, I just 
I don't give a damn 
Leave me ashes and dust 

If I'm out of time â in too deep 
I'm giving in to it, I'm 

Burning up, burning down to the ground 
An inferno untamed 
Burning up, breaking free to be bound 
Burning up in a flame 

Burning up, burning down to the ground 
An inferno untamed 
Burning up, breaking free to be bound
Burning up in a flame
