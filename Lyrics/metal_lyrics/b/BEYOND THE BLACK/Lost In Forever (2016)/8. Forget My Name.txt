The autumn trees have shed their leaves 
A cloudy sky is riddled within your grief 
Don't watch me go out in the rain 
The days we lost will never come again 
I'll disappear, like morning mist 
May our dream be captured in a kiss 
To find us once and wake us then 
Don't ask me now 
The wind alone knows when 

Forget my name 
Forget my name 
And let me die 

All my sins, forgiven 
All my soul is riven 
Nothing left â no tears to cry 
All is lost, forsaken â torn apart 
Forget my name my love and let me die 
Forget my name 

How dark the night, how deep your pain 
The hurt you feel will never be in vain 
You raised me high into the sun 
Live in the past of there's no moving on 
There is no fight, just destiny 
No one to blame, to set your sorrow free 
New hope will come, you'll find a way 
Wish me farewell there's nothing else to say

Forget my name 
Forget my name 
And let me die 

All my sins, forgiven 
All my soul is riven 
Nothing left â no tears to cry 
All is lost, forsaken â torn apart 
Forget my name my love and let me die 
Forget my name 
Forget my name and let me die 

Wash away your sadness 
Break the chains of grief 
Keep your faith together 
IN the past you'll find relief 

Forget my name 
Forget my name 
And let me die 

All my sins, forgiven 
All my soul is riven 
Nothing left â no tears to cry 
All is lost, forsaken â torn apart 
Forget my name my love and let me die 
Forget my name 
Forget my name, my love and let me die 
Forget my name
