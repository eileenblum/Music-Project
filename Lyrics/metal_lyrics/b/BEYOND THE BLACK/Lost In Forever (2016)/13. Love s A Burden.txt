Deep inside me 
There is something that I just can't explain Something ignites me 
And when it's gone it all starts over again 
I live the moment 
I try to hate you 
But I just can't deny my deepest will 
'Cause love is all that I can ever feel 

I trust in sorrow 
That is something that seems to be my friend 'Cause I love tomorrow 
When it's all gonna be the same 
I tried to break out 
Into the unknown 
But I just can't deny my deepest will 
'Cause love is all that I can ever feel 

Love's a burden, but I want more to bear 
I keep crossing the hurdles 
And wipe away the tears 
Love's a burden, but I just can't ignore 
How good it feels 
How good it feels 

You petrify me 
I wanna move, but I just can't make a turn Something restrains me 
I wanna go, but it pulls me back again 
I wanna leave you 
I wanna hurt you 
But I just can't deny my deepest will 
'cause love is all that I can ever feel 

Love's a burden, but I want more to bear 
I keep crossing the hurdles 
And wipe away the tears 
Love's a burden, but I just can't ignore 
How good it feels 
How good it feels 

Sometimes a storm, sometimes it's still 
But the wind keeps blowing 
And takes my shattered soul away 
On a journey to the inside of my melancholy 

Love's a burden, but I want more to bear 
I keep crossing the hurdles 
And wipe away the tears 
Love's a burden, but I just can't ignore 
How good it feels 
How good it feels
