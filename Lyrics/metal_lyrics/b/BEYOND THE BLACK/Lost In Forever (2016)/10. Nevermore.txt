Long time ago, far and gone 
An old man would nap all alone 
Lost in a dream of Lenore, evermore 
A tapping he heard at the door 
Woke him up from the burden he bore
The sound almost seemed like it wereâ¦ 
â¦was it her 

But the light in his eyes showed the ebony 
Wings of the dark 
And the light in his heart, it was gone like the
Wind kills a spark 

Nevermore, nevermore, quoth the raven his Unyielding lore 
Nevermore, nevermore and the old man 
Refused to implore 

Pondering weary and weak 
The old man still lost in his sleep 
Cursed on the bird and his lore, from before Prophet or devil it was 
As he saw it, the old man was lost 
Wouldn't see his beloved Lenore â nevermore 

And the light in his eyes showed the ebony Wings of the dark 
And the light in his heart, it was gone like 
Wind kills a spark

Nevermore, nevermore, quoth the raven his Unyielding lore 
Nevermore, nevermore and the old man 
Refused to implore 

But the dream, it was gone 'cause the echo 
Went on through his core 
And it teared him apart 
As the raven kept still â nevermore

Nevermore, nevermore, quoth the raven his Unyielding lore 
Nevermore, nevermore and the old man 
Refused to implore 

But the dream, it was gone 'cause the echo 
Went on through his core 
And it teared him apart 
As the raven kept still â nevermore 

Nevermore, nevermore, quoth the raven his Unyielding lore 
Nevermore, nevermore and the old man 
Refused to implore

But the dream, it was gone 'cause the echo 
Went on through his core 
And it teared him apart 
As the raven kept still â nevermore
