I remember you crushing my heart 
You were there when my world fell apart 
When I drowned in my solitude 
You walked away 
Every breath at the mercy of you 
What you swore to me, none of it true 
Here you are, my love 
Dressed all in sorrow today 

Tell me lies, lies, beautiful lies 
Till your treason won't hurt anymore 
Tell me lies, lies, beautiful lies 
I'll remember each word that you swore 

I remember you drifting away 
I was there and you begged me to stay 
Couldn't watch, my love 
Now all that's left is to pray 
I will follow whatever the cost 
Couldn't hold you back when you got lost 
Never once did I stop loving you 
Lead the way 

Tell me lies, lies, beautiful lies 
Till your treason won't hurt anymore 
Tell me lies, lies, beautiful lies 
I'll remember each word that you swore 

Lies, lies, you broke your vow 
Lies, lies, you mourn her now 
Lies, lies, until she dies 
Beautiful lies 

I remember you crushing my heart 
You were there, when it all fell apart 
With your sweet little promises 
You brought the dark 

Tell me lies, lies, beautiful lies 
Till your treason won't hurt anymore 
Tell me lies, lies, beautiful lies 
I'll remember each word that you swore 

Tell me lies, lies, beautiful lies 
Till your treason won't hurt anymore 
Tell me lies, lies, beautiful lies 
I'll remember each word that you swore

Lies, lies, until she dies 
Beautiful lies
