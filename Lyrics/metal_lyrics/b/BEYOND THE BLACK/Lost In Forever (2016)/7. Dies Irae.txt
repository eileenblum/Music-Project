Heavenly choirs, the sinners in fear 
Harvest the souls for salvation is near 
Grant me a place and I'll hallow thy name 
The earth it will perish in thunder and rain 
The earth it will perish in ashes and flame 

Dies irae, iudex, salva me 
Dies illa, pie domine 
Dies irae, iudex, salva me 
Dies illa, pie domine 

Days of damnation, the end has begun 
Worthless the prayers as judgement goes on 
Open the book, whom to bless 
Whom to blame 
The earth it will perish in ashes and flame 

Dies irae, iudex, salva me 
Dies illa, pie domine 
Dies irae, iudex, salva me 
Dies illa, pie domine 

We will prevail on the fields of paradise 
Burn out the past, from the ashes we will rise 
Wipe out the dark 
And the children of the dawn 
Live on, live on, live on 

Heavenly choirs, a new day begins one is the nightmare, forgiven the sins 
Grant me a place and I'll hallow thy name 
Remember forever the days of the flame 
Dies irae, iudex, salva me 
Dies illa, pie domine 
Dies irae, iudex, salva me 
Dies illa, pie domine
