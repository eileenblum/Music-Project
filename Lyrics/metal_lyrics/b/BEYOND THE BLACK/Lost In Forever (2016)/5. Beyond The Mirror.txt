You mime the look that you see in my eyes 
You hide your ego behind your disguise 
If I could reach you 
I'd join in your shadow game 
Stay in your frame 
For this world has a price

Just stay beyond the mirror 
Beyond this shallow life 
And watch the mortal wither 
While you alone survive 
An hour a lifetime 
From out across the sideline 
Just stay beyond the mirror 
And watch them through my eyes 

You long to break out and feel what I feel 
You long to see 
What the world might reveal 
If I could reach you 
I'd trade for your shadow game 
The scars you take in this life never heal 

Just stay beyond the mirror 
Beyond this shallow life 
And watch the mortal wither 
While you alone survive 
An hour a lifetime 
From out across the sideline 
Just stay beyond the mirror 
And watch them through my eyes 

I wouldn't open the door 
To your neverland 
I couldn't give you the life 
That you never had

Just stay beyond the mirror 
Beyond this shallow life 
And watch the mortal wither 
While you alone survive 
An hour a lifetime 
From out across the sideline 
Just stay beyond the mirror 
And watch them through my eyes
