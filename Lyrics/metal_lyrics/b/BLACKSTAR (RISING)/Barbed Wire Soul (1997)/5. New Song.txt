I have got no reason
I have got no reason at all
Getting older but not getting any wiser
And I never even heard the last call
I have got no reason
No reason have I got
Seems like I am stuck in my old ways
Bitter jaded and vitriolic
Yeah I have got the lot

Got no reason
I have got no reason at all
Got no reason
At all
At all
At all
No reason at all

I got a new song to sing now
Wishing to Christ that I would never get old
Whilst to the sands of time my mind and body were being sold
Yeah I have got a new song to sing now
Got no time for getting the blues
After all it could be worse
I could be like you

Well I got no reason
Seems like I lost the plot
Well I am putting it all on the line now
Out on a limb on one final shot
