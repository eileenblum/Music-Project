Well you can take that look off your face
Because I just cannot take it no more
Take that look right of your face
Your stupid face that I abhor
That I abhor

Well tell me to what do you amount
Well come hear me shout

Well do not make me laugh
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
Do not make me

Laugh on the other side of my face
With a little smile of scorn
With misery I have been graced
Bursting until my lungs are sore
Come hear me roar

And what have I achieved
Come hear me sing

Do not make me laugh
