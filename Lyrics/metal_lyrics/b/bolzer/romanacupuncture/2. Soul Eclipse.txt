An auger screaming portents
Vomit black signs
Eviscerate the silence
Sear the ritual skin

Casting ancient bone
Death begets birth
Courting mind with iron
Abort the flesh

Hailing the soul eclipse
Flagellate mine eyes
Blessed be the shadow trip
Kiss the abyss

Angel blood is scentless
With his ash in the air
These thrones they cannot hold
What twighlight doth bring
