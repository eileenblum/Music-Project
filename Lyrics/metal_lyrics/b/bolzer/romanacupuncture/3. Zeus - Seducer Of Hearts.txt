Lancer! I wish to give you my heart
Strake! With blessings sent from above
Lightning! Is what the warrior wants
Fucked! By your spearheaded love

Armoured in amour
Like Cupid de Mort
Zeus no mercy
I wish to depart

Ravaged is my mortal skin
By fires of intent and neglect
For I know the certain path to ascension
Is indeed conflagration

Celestial thrust
As bolt-fists erupt
Horrific face
Of conscience awaits
Apathies past
Reap plasmic harvest
Lifeless mass
Fate is a mess
...Amiss!

Penance! Your thrones resideth so deep
Bled! Of my master instinct
Solace! Is the likely sentence
Choked! By excessive repent

HzR: drums;
KzR: guitars, vocals.

Thanks to okoi for correcting track #3 lyrics.
