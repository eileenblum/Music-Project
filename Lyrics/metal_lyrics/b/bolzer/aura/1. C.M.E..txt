Habitue of helios high
Skin abloom in worship
Break your knees on the steep
Caressing the crevasse
Luna celibate
Bedding the abyss
Grant passage the father
In his ardour

Reign! Reign! Reign!
Solar imperator supreme
Forfeit! Forfeit! Forfeit!
Ye acquiescent concubines of his orbit

Dance! Dance! Dance!
The lofty whims of the great client
Feed! Feed! Feed!
Ravenous celestial furnace

Ultraviolet hallucination
Photosynthetic onanation
Ultraviolent stimulation
Coronal mass ejaculation

Heliocrat!
Ream the wreath, the flaming corona
Phallic crown, conflagrant vulva
Godseed, abscond the coil!
Rise! Rise!
Devotee, impregnate the temple
Autoerotic veneration
Cosmic womb awash with semen
Godflesh,
Descend! Descend!

Combust! Combust! Combust!
Stella alpha omega
Release! Release! Release!
Yourself, all and I from this mortal service
