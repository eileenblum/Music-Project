We are the nameless
A bridge to the supreme
We are fragments unshapen
Born posthumously

Crush your ears
And listen with your eyes
Our hearts are the ebb tide

A new end, a new means
A new hope awaits

Weâre crossing the divide
Tear us down
And make us whole again
Weâre crossing the divide
Find your purpose
Purge the ghosts inside

Hunger is a weapon
There is famine in our hearts
Starve these greedy phantoms
That want us torn apart

Now your body's betrayed
Freed the ghost you enslaved
But you built this cage
Your flesh a hostage
And your envy bloodstained

We are a bridge between
The beast and the supreme
Despisers come clean

A new end, a new means
A new hope awaits

Weâre crossing the divide
Tear us down
And make us whole again
Weâre crossing the divide
Find your purpose
Purge the ghosts inside

We will overcome

Crush your ears
And listen with your eyes
Our hearts are the ebb tide

You prey in fear
But show this ghost you hide
Our hearts are the ebb tide

We will overcome

Weâre crossing the divide
Tear us down
And make us whole again
Weâre crossing the divide
Find your purpose
Purge the ghosts inside
