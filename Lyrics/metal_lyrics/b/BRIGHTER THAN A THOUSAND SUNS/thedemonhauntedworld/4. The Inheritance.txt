Take this burning home
Our blood runs hot
But our hearts are cold

These blackened skies and poison seas
Stain our souls
Yet our hands are clean
Is this our legacy?

Money matters most
To buy us demons
To turn us into gods

But if money mattered most
Our bottom line
Should buy us hope

Instead we leave you alone
To take this burden
Off our fragile bones

We hand down this mess
To the heirs of our indifference
We pass this torch with shame
For you to put out the flames

So hold your breath and bite your tongues
Daughters and our sons
We leave our own flesh and blood
Work we left undone

Cast the flame
And lay to waste
The future for today

Mother nature raped
In mankind's wake
This is a disgrace
And makes our children slaves to our mistakes
But we turn the other way
For you to douse these flames

We take to the grave
A world that's up to you to save
