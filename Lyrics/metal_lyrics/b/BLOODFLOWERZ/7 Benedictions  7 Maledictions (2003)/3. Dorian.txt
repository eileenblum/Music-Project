A wish you had lost since years sticks in your hair
Like the smell of dead souls in nightmares
The child of a stranger died in your dead arms
Your cold love couldn't keep it safe and warm
Hearts broke and sorrow is the price
For a life cold as ice
Dorian don't touch me
Please don't
Please let my heart free
Dorian don't hurt me
Your pain gorges inside of me
You hide the truth in picture strongly sealed
Solitude and coldness are your shield
The despair of your longing sadly cries
Maledictions in the nights
No tear will ever run from your heart
With love all pain was set apart

Dorian don't touch me
Please don't
Please let my heart free
Dorian don't hurt me
Your pain gorges inside of me

What you've once been wastes away
Buried alive on a rainy day
Strangers rule your thoughts
What you are feeds on fraud
One day will break your heart of stone
This last way you'll walk aloneâ¦

Dorian don't touch me
Please don't
Please let my heart free
Dorian don't hurt me
Your pain gorges inside of me
