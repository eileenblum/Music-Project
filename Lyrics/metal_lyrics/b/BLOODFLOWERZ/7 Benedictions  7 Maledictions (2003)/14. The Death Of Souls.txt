Tomorrow will make it right, I said
So easy to run away, hide in a holy prayer and repeat the last day

Tomorrow I'll be someone, I said
I walked beside the dying souls, had no dreams and no goals

Someone will show me the world I said
A god to save, a Jesus who dies on the cross
No there's no one to decide my decision
And there's no one create a vision for me

No one can take my pain
No one can stop the rain for me
No one can live my life
No one can hold the dead alive
No one can take my pain
No one can stop the rain for me
Just myself to save my life
Just myself to keep myself alive
