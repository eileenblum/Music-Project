The day you forget how to dream you are dead
The day you forget how to love you are dead
We need to risk the known
Taste the apple on our own
No excuse, no lie can save me

Moments of intensity
Inflame the torch of life in me
When I die I want to know I've lived

Believe in your wild heart
It's not too late to start
Feel the fire burn, the world turn
The day you forget how to dream you are dead
The day you forget how to love you are dead

Stories in the book of time
Of tears and joy, bad and divine
Let your soul write your own story

The night is dark 'cause you can't see
The ocean's dry, the flood comes near
We're wild children of the moon

Believe in your wild heart
It's not too late to start
Feel the fire burn, the world turn

The day you forget how to dream you are dead
The day you forget how to love you are dead

Believe in your wild heart
Never, never too late to start
Feel the fire burn
Feel how the world turns

The day you forget how to dream you are dead
The day you forget how to love you are dead
