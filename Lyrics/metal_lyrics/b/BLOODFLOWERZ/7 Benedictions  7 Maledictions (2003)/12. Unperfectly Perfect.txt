A thrilling voice of pain told me I should better go
The growing thunder announced that the next wave will overflow me
Despite of the storm my heart said no
I had to stay I could not go
The night came I waited for the rain
With hope in my heart, fire in my veins

My heart, my blood, my pain, my joy
My mind, my soul, my love, my tears
My heart, my blood, my pain, my joy
A fight in my breast, a search and an endless quest

My heart don't wanna think
My pain don't wanna laugh
My joy cannot despair
My mind can't stop to weigh my way

A thrilling voice told me that I should better stay
I questioned my heart and felt that it is not the perfect day
Despite of the sun my heart said go
My soul said I know, but my mind no
Who knows what is prudent, who knows what's right
The only to trust is this voice inside

My heart, my blood, my pain, my joy
My mind, my soul, my love, my tears
My heart, my blood, my pain, my joy
A fight in my breast, a search and an endless quest

My heart don't wanna think
My pain don't wanna laugh
My joy cannot despair
My mind can't stop to weigh my way
