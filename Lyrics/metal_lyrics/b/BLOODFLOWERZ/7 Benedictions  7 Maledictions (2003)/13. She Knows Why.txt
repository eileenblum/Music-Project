We live and we die
We love and we cry

Paradise runs from her eyes
A tear of perception

Is there a sense in everything
Is there a place where angels sing

Tell me why we live and why we die
Tell me why we love and why we cry

Her hands caress
Her hands bless
Her hands undress the truth of illusion

Is there a sense in everything
Is there a place where angels sing

Tell me why we live and why we die
Tell me why we love and why we cry

Her heart is bleeding, hands can kill
Her hair is burning, her eyes will thrill us
She knows a sense in everything
She sings the song we cannot sing

Tell me why we live and why we die
Tell me why we love and why we cry
