Do you wanna own me
Do you wanna own me, touch me
Do you wanna have me
Come

Since I saw you the first time I knew that you will be mine
My heart turned blind through your shine

Darling it's true, I would kill for you
Darling it's real, I would lie and steal
That I can touch you, hold you, say you're mine
Do everything to get you and enjoy your shine
You're everything and you are mine

Everything I would do, everything for me and you
No one else will ever touch you
You can't say no, I don't let you go

Darling it's true, I would kill for you
Darling it's real, I would lie and steal
That I can touch you, hold you, say you're mine
Do everything to get you and enjoy your shine
You're everything and you are mine

You'll be mine, my sunshine
I choose you, you are the one
