I can hear your voice
Can you hear my voice
I can feel your touch
Can you feel my touch
Hear the dark twin in my fear
I'm your dark twin, I'm your fear
Taste the sweet salt in my tear
I'm the sweet salt in your tear
You're my lover inside
I'm your lover inside
My priest
Your priest
The doubt in believe
My beast
Your beast

I believe there is more
More than eyes can see and more
Than words can ever tell me
I can feel that there is more
More than we ever asked for
Than someone could ever tell us

Tonight I thought about suicide then the darkness beared the light
So many questions asked in vain, trust the night, she takes your pain

Tonight I see the light
I came to say I go now
I came to say goodbye
To the darkness false gods placed in my heart
Tonight I see the light
I came to say I know now
I came to say I can
Can find the answer deep in my heart

I can feel there is more
We are standing on a shore
The waves are waiting for us
Silver flashes dance in the moonlight
Tell the secrets of the night
Can you see the light shining deep inside

Tonight I searched in every land, searched in hell and paradise
I see the traces in the sand, tears have purified my eyes

Tonight I see the light
I came to say I go now
I came to say goodbye
To the darkness false gods placed in my heart
Tonight I see the light
I came to say I know now
I came to say I can
Can find the answer deep in my heart

Can you hear my voice
Can you feel my touch
I'm your dark twin, I'm your fear
Sweet salt that burns in your tear
I believe there is more
More than eyes can see and more than words tell me
I believe in the light, born by the darkness, it shines inside
Can you hear my voice
Can you feel my touch

Tonight I see the light
I came to say I go now
I came to say goodbye
To the darkness false gods placed in my heart
Tonight I see the light
I came to say I know now
I came to say I can
Can find the answer deep in my heart
