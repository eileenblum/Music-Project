You're like angels, so beautiful, it makes me cry
All my dreams of you rain down from the weeping sky

Like roses you flourish in my heart and hurt with your thorn
Flowers die in the cold, turn to gold, to be reborn

You're deeper than all oceans
Your sighing sounds so sweet, even when you sleep
Silently beats my heart with addictive smart

Fire in paradise mirrors in my eyes
Roses of red flower in my head
Roses smell so sweet till they start to weep

You're passion, you take me high and make me cry
You're protagonist in all love poems

You're sin, chill on my skin
My heartbeat is your voice, I have no choice
When your arrow hits my heart the roses start to burn

Fire in paradise mirrors in my eyes
Roses of red flower in my head
Roses smell so sweet till they start to weep
