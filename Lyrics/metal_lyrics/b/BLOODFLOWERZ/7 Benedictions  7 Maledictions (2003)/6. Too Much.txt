Too sick to eat but hungry, too drunk but you're still thirsty
Buy the perfect lie, the drug that never asks you why
One today and one for tomorrow, one for the joy and one for the sorrow
In all you find no satisfaction, you live today, don't need reflection

If you can't have me buy me, if you can't buy me steal me
Can't you see no end, hear the cry for help you sent
You fear the purgatory
Your life's a lying story
Kill your dying god and take me into your blood

I'm the whore and the drug and your lost dream
I break my promise, I'm not what I seemed to be
I am all that you need to stop insatiable greed
But I'm not what you want, just a trophy of your hunt
I'm the one that you love, 'cause you can't get enough
But I'm not what you need, I satisfy your greed

You took too much of me, you had too much of me
Can't you get enough, want more of my deadly love
Your life is just a freak show, an overdose, a deadly mind blow
All plain joy you can't remember like the first snow in December

Oh you thought you're a god while we first kissed
Now you're a slave of your pain 'cause you miss me
I am all that you need to stop insatiable greed
Now I am what you want, you're a trophy of my hunt
I'm the one that you love, can't get enough
But I'm not what you need, I appease your greed
I am all that you need in a dead end street
I'm all you want, I am all that you hate
I'm the whore and the drug and your lost dream
I break my promise, I'm not what I seemed to be
You're my dying slave, my name adorns your grave
Is this what you wanted when you called me
You're my dying slave, my name adorns your grave
Is this what you wanted when you kissed me
Don't take too much, don't let me touch
You had too much of my deadly touch
