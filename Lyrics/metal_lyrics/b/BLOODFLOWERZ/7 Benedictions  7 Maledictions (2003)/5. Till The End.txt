Don't know what is dream or real, what will be forever
Just a touch of what I feel can be wrote in letters
Hope that you will understand that you feel the same
I will take you by the hand 'cause life is not tame
Can I know I'm not mad?
Can I know I'm not dead?
That all's not just false pride
Just hope keeps me alive

Hope is when we keep the faith, believe in what eyes can't see
Hope's the sun on rainy days, the smile on your face
I'll wait one thousand years, cry a million tears, die in hundred lives,
Just to be by your side

In all joy and in all pain
I'll be there for you 'til the end
When we laugh and when we rain
Deep emotions we cannot pretend

One day we will have to go
Hearts will break but we know
(was) just a short part of our way
(we'll) meet again one day

You burned a sign in my heart I will never set apart
A message shining in the haze, on my way

So much will stay unsaid, mute 'til we are dead
So much stays undone, forgotten when we are gone
I'll wait one thousand years, cry a million tears, die in hundred lives,
Just to be by your side

In all joy and in all pain
I'll be there for you 'til the end
When we laugh and when we rain
Deep emotions we cannot pretend

So much will stay unsaid, mute 'til we are dead
So much stays undone, forgotten when we are gone
