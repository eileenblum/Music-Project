moonspell
i fell
a deadly knife inside my hand
a bloody trace is drying in the sand

too late
it's all fate
a victim of the wounded night
i fade 'cause i am loosing my last fight

all starts and ends in one fateful kiss
when we once touch what we ever miss
our endless quest has just begun

[chorus:]
love me to death and i love you more
take my last breath, it's a touch to the core
love me to death and i love you more
'cause love is the reason we die for

moonspell
a broken shell
stranded by the deep black sea
creeping fear gets deeper inside of me

my blood in the flood
stains the raging ocean red
when the dawn is rising i'll be dead

all starts, all ends in this fateful kiss
when we once touch what we ever miss
our endless quest has just begun

[chorus:]
love me to death and i love you more
take my last breath, it's a touch to the core
love me to death and i love you more
'cause love is the reason we die for

love me to death, love me more

the poison of my pain is running through my veins
the moon drives me insane and i fall again

love me to death, love me more
