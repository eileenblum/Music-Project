they turn up at night, come from inside, avoid the light
just a nightmare you said, this is no dream, no i'm not mad
all i had known like in this song a lonely tone
sing sweet lullabies, to me it sounds like childish cries
cold breath in my neck, shadows creep behind my back

they breathe with our mouth
they speak with our tongue
they smell all my greed and undone need
they hate with our hate
they love with our love
they see with our eyes what we don't see

taste the tears of the night, can't run away and we can't hide
just fragments remain, my face had changed, i'm not the same
a cold hand touched my core, the same hand like the night before

they live on our pain
they feed on our dreams
hell is a sad place in our souls
they need all our fears
they drink all our tears
hell is a dark place in our souls
awake unknown greed, they are evil seed,
they come with the flood, they're creatures of god
they smile in our face with a nasty grimace
the faces of pain

[chorus:]
misery - the flood comes rushing over me
a tragedy - my heart is crushed a weeping sea

through eyes of tears
i face my fears
and i face my pain
through the nightly rain

[chorus:]
misery - the flood comes rushing over me
a tragedy - my heart is crushed a weeping sea

they kiss with my lips, they speak with my tongue, they hate with my hate, 
they love with my love,
they live on my pain, they feed on my dreams, they need all my fears,
they drink all my tears

the voices of the dead are whispering in my head
some cold breath in my neck, shadows creep behind my back
they turn up at night, come from inside, avoid the light
