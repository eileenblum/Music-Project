oh honey i wait for you in the dark
oh honey i feel the beat of your heart
oh honey i'm craving for you
oh honey i'm sure you knew
oh honey don't cry in the shade
oh honey i fade and it's too late

oh honey don't trust me, don't hate
oh honey can't save me - it's too late
oh honey your sweet taste i will miss
oh honey receive my deadly kiss
oh honey can't protect you from me
oh honey my pain - you can't see

[chorus:]
you don't really need to cry
heaven's for the loving ones
i take your life, i take your soul
and love you till your pain is gone

you don't really need to cry
heaven's for the loving ones

no god in heaven, my bloodless angel
i see tears run from your heart
i count the strokes of your fading heartbeat
i lick the flames of your fading heat
in my torture i don't know mercy
i am blessed with insanity

[chorus:]
you don't really need to cry
heaven's for the loving ones
i take your life, i take your soul
and love you till your pain is gone

you don't really need to cry
heaven's for the loving ones

oh honey i kiss you, your dead lips
oh honey i kiss you, just a short bliss
a war is fighting in my breast
not human, no god, i'm fatally blessed
where is the sun, where is the light
i am the bride of the weeping night
the night never ends, my lips drop red
i live forever but i am dead
i am doomed and blessed forever
i feel the pain ever and ever

[chorus:]
you don't really need to cry
heaven's for the loving ones
i take your life, i take your soul
and love you till your pain is gone

you don't really need to cry
heaven's for the loving ones

no one there to save my heart
i am standing in the dark
see the tears run from your heart
i am waiting in the dark
no one there to save me
