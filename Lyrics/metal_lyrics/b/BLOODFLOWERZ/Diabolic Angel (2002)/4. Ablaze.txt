Not just one death to die
always a reason why
the wheel is turning
the wheel is turning

i write the five on the wall
i dance the hills till i fall
the fire is burning

i will pick the sin again
seduce a saint in eden
there is more to understand
the signs bleed in your hand

[chorus:]
keep the fire ablaze
and dance with me
till the end of all days
come with me

the sermons about the divine
smell like bad purple wine
i stay sober
i stay sober

when creed abuses the wise
the truth is fucked by some lies
the world falls over

i will pick the sin again
seduce a saint in eden
there is more to understand
the signs bleed in your hand

[chorus:]
keep the fire ablaze
and dance with me
till the end of all days
come with me

keep the fire ablaze
and dance with me

i seduce you, want to show you the light that burns inside
i refuse to be a slave of your lies

[chorus:]
keep the fire ablaze
and dance with me
till the end of all days
come with me

keep the fire ablaze
and dance with me
