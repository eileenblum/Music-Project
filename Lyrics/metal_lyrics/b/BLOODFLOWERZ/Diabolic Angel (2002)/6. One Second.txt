i close my eyes
listen to a soft song
an ancient melody
of strange mystery

with your deep blue glance
i venture a close dance
come deep inside
not just this night

one second

[chorus:]
in confusion by a flash
in the cycle of life and of death
cannot stop the flood paving the way of my fate
we are the blood, we are of the clay
are you the god saving my day
we cannot stop the flood, the way of our fate

love's rising
brighter than all stars can
higher than dragons fly
but virgins are shy

in one second
all can change
rearrange
wake up the sleeper
and touch me deeper

one second

[chorus:]
in confusion by a flash
in the cycle of life and of death
cannot stop the flood paving the way of my fate
we are the blood, we are of the clay
are you the god saving my day
we cannot stop the flood, the way of our fate
