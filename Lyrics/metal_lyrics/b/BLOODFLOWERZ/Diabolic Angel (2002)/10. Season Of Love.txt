the sun turns dark
like my heart
the earth keeps moving on
starts turning into a new season
i look to the sky for the signs of the day
i'm crawling and waiting to follow my way
old mother earth knows the mystery
infinity in there

[chorus:]
i'm waiting for you
i'm waiting for your love

i'm waiting for you
i'm waiting for your love

the sun turns cold
and we get old
prophecies have told us once
an new dawn is rising above the horizons
enter the unknown leaving borders behind
find all the secrets we cannot remind
we'll join new seasons or we will stay blind
infinity out there

[chorus:]
i'm waiting for you
i'm waiting for your love

i'm waiting for you
i'm waiting for your love

i'm wait for the day...
