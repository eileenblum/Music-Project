i fall, stand up, no i don't never give up
but fear, cold tears, creep like poison to my heart
i run, try to reach the bright sun
i call your name in the falling rain

i hit the ground 'cause gravity keeps me down
a real bad trip when all i try to keep runs through my hands
like dusty sand
till i understand i'll ride this turning circle
show me ways in the haze, show me the place
where the sun always shines

go inside

[chorus:]
cold rain is falling down again
i'm sailing on dark flows

i still believe, but today i need relief
i await the light, a new day follows after every night
so go inside
i feel the flood, my raging blood
'can feel you
sad cold fear is creeping near
but i know i have to go... inside

[chorus:]
cold rain is falling down again
i'm sailing on dark flows
cold rain is falling on me
i'm sailing on dark flows
cold rain is falling down again
i'm sailing on dark flows

and the wind blows colder...
