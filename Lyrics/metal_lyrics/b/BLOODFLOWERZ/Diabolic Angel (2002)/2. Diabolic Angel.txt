everyday I fade away
everyday I'm walking into danger
a magic force drowns myself
all fear is gone
I'm addicted to you, stranger
seems like the quest gains some sense
all i knew changed
i will never go back and close my eyes

[chorus:]
be my angel
burn my eyes with your light
be my fallen angel
kiss my soul with your shade
be my fallen angel

more and more I disappear
and more and more I feel the creeping danger
I wanna taste just a piece of the forbidden
I just wanna be close

[chorus:]
be my angel
burn my eyes with your light
be my fallen angel
kiss my soul with your shade
be my fallen angel

be my angel
burn my eyes with your light
be my fallen angel

oh be my angel...
