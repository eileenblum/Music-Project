You and I
Fear the silence tonight
Can't Stop the end
Violent silence
Silent violence

We're alone
Like weeping children
With no home
I lost your hand
But memories will stay
It won't fade away

Maybe love is the same as hate
Maybe pain gonna be our fate
I have to change my tears
(damaged promises)
For something to believe in

Love is a fight
Seems we're losing it tonight
One touch
One kiss
This could be the last
It went away to fast

Maybe love is the same as hate
Maybe pain gonna be our fate
I have to change my tears
(damaged promises)
For something to believe in

Our difference dug the grave
To bury damaged promises
One day it was too late
You love to hate me and I love to hate you

Maybe love is the same as hate
Maybe pain gonna be our fate
I have to change my tears
(damaged promises)
For something to believe in
