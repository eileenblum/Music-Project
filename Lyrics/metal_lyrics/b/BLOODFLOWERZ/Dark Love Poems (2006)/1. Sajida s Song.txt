My virgin dreams are gone
I try to find someone
Who tells me
What's love
Why there is no wonderland
Why lovers try to pretend
To love you

Tell me what is love

What is love when love means crying
What is love when dreams are dying
What is love when lovers never say I love you

Your kisses taste so dead
Where are the dreams we had
Just silence
Between us
Helplessly I recognize
Love faded last night

Where has our love gone

What is love when love means crying
What is love when dreams are dying
What is love when lovers never say I love you

What is love?
What is love?
Wear the necklace of a dove

What is love when love means crying
What is love when dreams are dying

What is love when love means crying
What is love when dreams are dying
What is love when lovers never say I love you

What is love?
What is love?
Wear the necklace of a dove
