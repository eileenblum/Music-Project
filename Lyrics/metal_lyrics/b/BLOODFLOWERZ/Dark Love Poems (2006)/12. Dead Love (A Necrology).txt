I'm alone with me
And now I see
That darkness is all what you left in me
All just empty words
And the silence hurts
Seems that you don't know
What you've done to me

Dead is all the love we had
Dead are all the words I said
Dead is all the yearning in my head
Real dead love is all I see
Nothing left inside of me
Tell me why this had to end so cruel

It's a real sad love
With a bitter ending
A bitter ending
It's a real sad love
With a bitter ending

Nothing can live in dying worlds
A funeral song of the falling rain
Is the only memory of silent pain
Nothing can live in dying worlds

It's a real sad love
With a bitter ending
A bitter ending
It's a real sad love
With a bitter ending
