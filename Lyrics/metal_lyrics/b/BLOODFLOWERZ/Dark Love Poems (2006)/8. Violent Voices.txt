In dead dreams I saw your face
I am on the run countless days

Eros versus Thanatos
Every night I nail your heart to the cross

In strangers arms I searched for love
But everything I found was not enough

All was not enough, all is
Not enough
For my dying heart
Not enough
When my battle starts again
Not enough
When the voices call
Not enough
'cause I yearn to fall again

I found hell before I die
Pleasure seems to be just a lie
Violent voices call my name
Every night they call me
To do the same

Not enough
For my dying heart
Not enough
When my battle starts again
Not enough
When the voices call
Not enough
'cause I yearn to fall again

In strangers arm I searched for love
But everything I found was not enough
All was not enough, all was

Not enough
For my dying heart
Not enough
When my battle starts again
Not enough
When the voices call
Not enough
'cause I yearn to fall again

Not enough
