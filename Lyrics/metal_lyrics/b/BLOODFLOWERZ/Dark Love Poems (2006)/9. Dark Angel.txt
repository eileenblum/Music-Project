You're all I wanted, all I love
You're my dark light
My angel, all I'm dreaming of
You're my delight
You are the half making me complete
You're all I need

I never thought this night will end
I thought my eyes try to pretend
Now I know dreams come true
I know it's true since I found you

You're all I wanted, all I love
You're my dark light
My angel, all I'm dreaming of
You're my delight
You are the half making me complete
You're all I need

You are desire I once cursed
The dream I yearned for with bad thirst
Before you came my heart was dead
I loved you long before I met you

You're all I wanted, all I love
You're my dark light
My angel, all I'm dreaming of
You're my delight
You are the half making me complete
You're all I need

You're my dark light
You're all I need
You're my delight
You're all I need
