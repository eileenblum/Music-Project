You wanna know why we had to separate
But how can I show I had lost my faith
On this way I can not walk another day
So I turned away
I am not afraid

Deep wounds will heal now
Sorrow will fade away
Deep wounds will cure now
Healed hearts forgive the pain

Too many lies, too many dirty alibis
Today I never mind what's truth or disguise
I stopped a war that we had lost long before
We observed the sores hurting to the core

Love yourself and let me free
The good lives on in memories
Free yourself and you will see
Hate is always misery...

Deep wounds will heal now
Sorrow will fade away
Deep wounds will cure now
Healed hearts forgive the pain
