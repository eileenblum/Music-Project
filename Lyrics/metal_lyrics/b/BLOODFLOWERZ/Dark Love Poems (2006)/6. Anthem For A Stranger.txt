Before I met you every light was dark
That you never saw me still feels so hard

After I have seen you, prayers filled my ears
Nothing but my sorrow stays when all hope leaves

Calling, calling for you
I'm just a face in the crowd you will never see
Falling, falling in your
Glances of love but your love I will never be
Calling, calling for you
I'm just a face in the crowd you will never see

Tried to be so beautiful
Tried to be so wonderful
Tried to speak to you but you could never hear me

Calling, calling for you
I'm just a face in the crowd you will never see
Falling, falling in your
Glances of love but your love I will never be
Calling, calling for you
I'm just a face in the crowd you will never see

For you I'm no one, a lone tear in the rain
For your attention, I call in vain

Calling, calling for you
I'm just a face in the crowd you will never see
Falling, falling in your
Glances of love but your love I will never be

You are too beautiful
And you are too wonderful
