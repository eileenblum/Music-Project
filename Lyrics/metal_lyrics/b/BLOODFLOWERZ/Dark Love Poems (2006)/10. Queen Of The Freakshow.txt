I sit alone in my room waiting
Waiting for the demons to go
And I don't wanna know what I yet know

I am the queen in this freakshow
When love's too low and pain's too high
The only answer is goodbye

My hope's just the dope to bear your last words
Now I see farewell's the key to love
Can't hold you back

Successfully I killed reality
I'm too deaf to be hurt
By the void of your words
But I yet know

I am the queen in this freakshow
You need to go, so I can't keep
Back the traveller on the leap

My hope's just the dope to bear your last words
Now I see farewell's the key to love
Can't hold you back

I must confess, my loneliness gave me the time
I need to learn how to go, how to say goodbye

My hope's just the dope to bear your last words
Now I see farewell's the key to love
Can't hold you back
