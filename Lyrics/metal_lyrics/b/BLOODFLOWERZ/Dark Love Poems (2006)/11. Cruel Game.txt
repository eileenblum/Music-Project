I see the gun in your hand
But still you pretend
To love me endlessly

Forgotten memories
Write tragedies
In the rainy wind

But you're so beautiful
Though you are so cruel
Let me be your fool

Please play this cruel game
And go on pretending
Push your last nail into my
Wounded hands

There is no sense in explain
Why I bear the pain
I'm bound by unseen chains

I close my eyes to forget
That I regret
Love has gone so bad

But you're so beautiful
Let me be your fool

Please play this cruel game
And go on pretending
Push your last nail into my
Wounded hands

You killed my innocence tonight, oh you
You filled me with hope, oh don't go on
You killed my innocence tonight, go on
You thrilled every sense in me, you won

Take my heart and play this game again

Please play this game
And go on pretending
Push your last nail into my
Wounded hands
