I'll break all the chains
Unlock all the doors
Walk all the lands,
to fullfill my destiny
I'll swim all the seas
Walk all the paths,
and over the bridge,
to fullfill my destiny

I smell the jaws of death
around the stricken foes
Now i will meet the dead,
because i did not retreat
In my soul i stuck a knife
With no regrets i'll die
In a bloody grave i'll hide
and kiss this world goodbye

I'll cut through the dark
Jump in the fire
Melt the ice,
to fullfill my destiny
With the wind i will fly
and the reaper will cry
All my enemies DIE
and i'll fullfill my destiny

I smell the jaws of death
around the stricken foes.
Now i will meet the dead,
because i did not retreat.
In my soul i stuck a knife.
With no regrets i'll die.
In a bloody grave i'll hide
and kiss this world goodbye.

I'll cut through the dark.
Jump in the fire.
Melt the ice,
to fullfill my destiny.
With the wind i will fly
and the reaper will cry.
All my enemies DIE
and i'll fullfill my destiny.

I smell the jaws of death
around the stricken foes.
Now i will meet the dead,
because i did not retreat.
In my soul i stuck a knife.
With no regrets i'll die.
In a bloody grave i'll hide
and kiss this world goodbye.
