Are we not the ones
who conceived this war
and lustily yearn
domination
never sorry for
clean-handed men
guiltless burning in fire
We are the ones
who pursued power
and we brought horrid
armageddon
never knowing the
consequences of
our own stupidity

fear - of the comming danger
await - your certain death
suffer - from the pain and anger
while - we silent watch
your sacred world burn

Are we not the ones
who brought warfare
on the earth to seek
hegemony
without worry for
orphaned children and
our desolate land
We are the ones
who started all
and now there is
no turning back
time to suffer
the aftermath
of our impudent lust

fear - of the comming danger
await - your certain death
suffer - from the pain and anger
while - we silent watch
your sacred world burn

Burn

Watch it burn
