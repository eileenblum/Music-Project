Kill with pleasure
slay for relish
quentch the thirst for victim blood
sacrifice it
kill and please
the goddess of destruction
Cherish murder
just for thrill
we have lost the human glimmer
we've turned heartless
and relentless
our inner
beast must die

Crooked beings with
dead emotions
all are sick and sick must die
slay the kin
to prevent
the inner corruption
Cherish murder
just for thrill
we have lost the human glimmer
we've turned heartless
and relentless
our inner
beast must die

It's time to kill the evil
to slay our inner brute

It's time to kill the prowler
the beast within our soul
