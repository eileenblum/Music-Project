Tears falling from your eyes
poison arrows fly through the sky
fever will strike you down
like lightning
deadly infectious
cruel diseas
i am the black plague
and no one will rest

conquest, war, famine, death
join our, solemn, demise, now
conquest, war, famine, death
join our, godless, feast, now

riding on pale horses
living expect only death
smoking piles of corpses
nations collapse
bonds of society fractured
rhythm of medieval life
deadly diseas uncaptured
no more salvation

conquest, war, famine, death
join our, solemn, demise, now
conquest, war, famine, death
join our, godless, feast, now

mortality rate rises
we stride to certain death
silent creeps the shadow
ravaging earth
Hundreds upon hundreds
lifeless lay in the fields
hope brings to despair
no more salvation

conquest, war, famine, death
join our, solemn, demise, now
conquest, war, famine, death
join our, godless, feast, now
