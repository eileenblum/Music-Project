Crushed,furious savage
full of hatred pure
for his mental illness
he can't find no cure
Now he sees no future
now he has no faith
in his broken heart
he feels only hate

the blood from the wounds
the tears from the eyes
the piece from the heart
horrific sound of his desperate cries
the blood, the tears, desperate cries

In the grip of cold
i'll resist the fright
i will never fall
i will stand and fight
In my black veins
the blood starts to boil
if i can't be saved
let it wet the soil

the blood from the wounds
the tears from the eyes
the piece from the heart
horrific sound of his desperate cries
the blood, the tears, desperate cries

His soul breaks, his heart is raptured
sentenced to eternal torture
Forgotten in the bloody pit he dies
but there are no tears from the lifeless eyes
He will hear no voice, there is no exile
time to meet death and his new master
In the stream of pain, another soul lost
all is settled up, he has paid the cost
