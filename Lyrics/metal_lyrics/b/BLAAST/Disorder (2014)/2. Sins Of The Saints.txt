Mortal is led into temptation
none ask how he was brought to sin
you menage to hide your own
close your eyes and throw the stone
because i deserve to die for what i have done
i don't care. I'll burn in the fires of hell

"Sinner" you yell
forgeting the good he's done
he is food for the saints
you, who never have been caught
Spare not the guilt from my misdeeds, but the
judgement of the ones never caught in sin

You can't clense the soul after it being corrupted
do not beg for mercy, when the judgement comes

I'm a sinner i know
my sentence is told
they don't speak of the batles i've won
only the one i've lost

Sinner

You can't clense the soul after it being corrupted
do not beg for mercy, when the judgement comes
