FLYYYYYY!

She starts her new diet, of liquor and dick,
Just like Hollywood but laced in sick.
The sun goes down and so does she.
The sun goes down and so does she.
Sold out the love that she had left with a cut of the throat.
Drinks all round on her before she strolls to the moat.
The sun goes down and so does she.
The sun goes down and so does she.

Count your fucking...
Blessings!
Come on!
Count your blessings,
Because I'm counting every lie.
Count your blessings,
Because I'm counting every lie.
Counting every lie.

Christ, I'm asking you for just one thing
I'm asking you for just one thing
Eradicate, this disease.

Close your eyes.
Pray for plagues.
Oh Lord cleanse this earth
And bring upon our doomsday.
Close your eyes.
Pray for plagues.
Cleanse this earth
And bring doomsday.

She starts her new diet, of liquor and dick,
Just like Hollywood but laced in sick.
The sun goes down and so does she.
The sun goes down and so does she.

So clap your hands to the sound
Of everyone first born dying now.
Watch the rivers flow with blood
Having death stand were life once stood

So clap your hands to the sound
Of everyone first born dying now.
Watch the rivers turn to blood
Having death stand were life once stood
[x2]

Close your eyes.
Pray for plagues.
Cleanse this earth
Bring our doomsday.
