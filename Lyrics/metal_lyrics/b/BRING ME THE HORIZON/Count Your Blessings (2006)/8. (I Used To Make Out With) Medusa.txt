Dead hands clutch my arm
The smell of death fills the air
Her fragrance,
Her carcass reanimates.

Oh, if you need me
I'll be tying a rope to the tree
Where our love used to be.

I've took down every photo of us and buried them at sea.
I've took down every photo of us and buried them at sea.
Don't worry dearest
Beauty is only skin deep.

Psyche!

Your beauty is no more.
So why don't you just fuck yourself you fucking whore.
Your beauty is no more.
So why don't you just fuck yourself you stupid fucking whore.

Well I should of known,
Not to look into her eyes
I'm cast to stone,
Her glare was my demise!

Medusa.
Medusa.

Your beauty is no more.
So why don't you just fuck yourself you fucking whore.

Dead hands clutch my arm
The smell of death fills the air
Her fragrance,
Her carcass reanimates.

Since you left me, things have never been the same.

Hour by hour, day by day.
Your memory will fade away.
Every sunrise, every sunset
Will help me to forget your name,
Your smile, your eyes
Medusa.

Decapitate her and bring her head to athena
Unlike her sisters, She ain't no deathless God.
This is for everytime you stabbed me in the back
For every notch in your bed post
This is for everytime you stabbed me in the back
For every notch in your bed post
