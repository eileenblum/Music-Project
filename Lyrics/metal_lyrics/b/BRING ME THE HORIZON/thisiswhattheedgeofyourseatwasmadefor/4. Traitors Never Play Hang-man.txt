This is what the edge of your seat was made for,
Holding on, nothing to lose,
This is what the edge of your seat was made for,
And this,

This is what the back of your hand was made for,
Stolen apologies,
Stolen apologies, you,

You're a traitor to my heart,
You're a traitor to us all,

Forsaken,

This over indulgence of conciseness,
Has torn a day apart,
And lingered in the splendor,
Of the feeling in my stomach,
Trailing down the shadow of cupped hands,
Covering my face,
I wait for what I have to do,

Forsaken,

We're all movie stars,
We're all movie stars,
We're all movie stars,
We're all movie stars,

(And I'm speaking these words)
(And I'm talking to the mirror)

You're a traitor to my heart,
You're a traitor to us fucking all,

I don't want to kiss anyone,
I don't want to kiss anyone but you,
I fucking love you
