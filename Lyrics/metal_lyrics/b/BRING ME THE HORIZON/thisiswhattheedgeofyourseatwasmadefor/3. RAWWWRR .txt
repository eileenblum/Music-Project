Yeah,
Rawwwwrr,

Take it back, what you suffer me,
Take it back, what you suffer me, baby,
Take it back, what you suffer me,
Take it back, what you suffer me, baby,

Taking back, what you stole from me,
Taking back, what you stole from me, baby.

Taking back, what you stole,
Taking back, what you stole from me.

So...

Wash away these memories, silent and proud,
Wash away these memories, silent and proud.

Blood won't confirm on these curtains.
Your blood, my hands,
Your blood, my fucking hands.

Run for the hills,
Your strength, from the dead afar,
Run for the hills,
Your strength from luck, cut this off,

And if you think you're alive,
Then you're better off fucking dead,

Right!

This will be, another moment where we put
Salt in my eyes, in wake I won't
Salt in my eyes
In hope I won't see your... smile.
I will not see her.

This will be over my dead body,
This will be over my dead body.
This will be over my dead body,
This will be over my dead body.
This will be over my dead body,
This will be over my dead body.
