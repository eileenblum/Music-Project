[feat. Lights]Crucify me, nail my hands to a wooden cross
There is nothing above, there is nothing below
Heaven and hell live in all of us
And I've been cast astray

I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
Lost in the abyss, drowned in the deep
No set of lungs could salvage me

Only a shipwreck, only a ghost
Merely a graveyard of your former self
We just watched the waves crash over
I've been cast astray

There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret
No one needs to know
There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret
No one needs to know

I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
Lost in the abyss, drowned in the deep
No set of lungs could salvage me
Save yourself, save your breath
The tides too strong, you'll catch your death
So breathe for me, just breathe

There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret
There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret

If we make it through the night, if we make it out alive
We'll have mercy and pray for the dead
Are you saying that you can save me
Don't hope to ever find me
And I fear I'm too far gone
Pray for the dead

If we make it through the night, if we make it out alive
We'll have mercy and pray for the dead
Are you saying that you can save me
Don't hope to ever find me
And I fear I'm too far gone
Pray for the dead

Pray for the dead [x3]

Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your full undivided attention?
There is something you all really need to know

There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret
There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret

If we make it through the night, if we make it out alive
You say that you can save me
Don't hope to ever find me
And I'll say that you forgot.
Pray for the dead.

I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me

I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
