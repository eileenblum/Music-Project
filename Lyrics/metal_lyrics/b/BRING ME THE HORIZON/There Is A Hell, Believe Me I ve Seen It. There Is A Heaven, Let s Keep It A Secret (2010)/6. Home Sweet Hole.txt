Cross my heart, I don't want to die.
But heaven knows it seems like I try.
Lost in a labyrinth for weeks on end.
I live and I learn from my mistakes, then I forget them again.

Got a feeling in my stomach that just won't quit.
It's subtle as a shotgun.
Heavy as a brick.
Because I'm staring at the devil and the truth of it is, he's a lot more familiar than I'd care to admit.

If only I could focus, maybe if I could see.
If I didn't know any better, I would say he looks just like me.
The roof is crashing down, the walls are caving in.
We discover all your stories are just works of fiction.
The roof is crashing down.
The truth is spilling out.

[2x]
Oh shit, I've done it again.
I'm in way too far in over my head.
Crossed the line, so many times, that I don't even know what it stands for.

[2x]
Home sweet hole, just be careful what you wish for.
Home sweet hole, just be careful what you say.

Got a feeling in my stomach that just won't quit.
It's subtle as a shotgun.
Heavy as a brick.
Bite your tongue.
Just bite your tongue.
You've already said quite enough.

[Speaking]
The roof is crashing down, the walls are caving in.

The truth is spilling out.

Oh shit, I've done it again.
I'm in way too far in over my head.
Crossed the line, so many times, that I don't even know what it stands for.

[4x]
You wear your lies like a noose around your neck.
So kick the chair and let's be done with it.

[2x]
Home sweet hole, just be careful what you wish for.
Home sweet hole, just be careful what you say.
