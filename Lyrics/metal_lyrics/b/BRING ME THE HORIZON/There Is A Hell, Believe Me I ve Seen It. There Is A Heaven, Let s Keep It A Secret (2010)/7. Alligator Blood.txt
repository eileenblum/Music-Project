Let's play a game of Russian roulette,
I'll load the gun, you place the bets.
Tell me, who will make it out alive.

Over and over and over again, we play the same old game.
Cards kept close to our chest, that's where your secrets kept.
So wear your poker face, hands to the fool, hands to the thief, and you can't see.

[x2]
My alligator blood is starting to show,
I know that you know that, I know that you know.
Can't call a bluff with a dead mans hand.

Cut me up and wear my skin,
show me how to live.
Tear me down, clean me up,
just fill my fucking cup.
Just help me find a way.
Just help me find a way.
Just help me find a way.
Just help me find a way.

[x2]
My alligator blood is starting to show,
I know that you know that, I know that you know.
Can't call a bluff with a dead mans hand.

[x2]
Put a gun to my head and, paint the walls with my brains.
Put a gun to my head and, paint the walls.

Now you know. [x3]

[x2]
Now you know you can go, you can give up trying.
Should of just called it quits,
should of just called it quits,
leave before it's too late.

[x2]
Let's play a game of Russian roulette,
I'll load the gun, you place the bet.
Tell me who will make it out alive.

Yeah!

(So put a gun to my head and paint the walls with my fucking brain.)

Put a gun to my head and paint the walls with my brains.
Put a gun to my head and paint the fucking walls.
