The sun goes down, we come out.
A different party in a different city.
The sun comes up, we come down.
We lived fast &amp; died pretty.

"WE'RE ALL VAMPIRES AND WE OWN THIS FUCKING NIGHT"

I'm not homesick, i am just so sick of going home.
I've been  walking these streets for days.
In search of blood.
Yeah I'd kill for the sun to never rise again.
I'd do anything oh anything.

So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight till it breaks.
You cant kill us , we never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only you could see how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
