Fuck you,
You took what you wanted and left, like locusts.
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You bled me dry and then left, like leeches.
Go, you got what you could now leave, like vultures

Ripped apart in minutes what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back may as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember, you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, you're on your fucking own.
(because)

If I had it my way I'd slit your throat with the knife you left in my back
All the shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you and this is your world
Fucking falling apart mate, from the inside out.
Everything will fall at your feet - you got hell to pay

And you better fucking bow down to me
You better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees and cry me a fucking river

Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever, cunt.
