We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore.
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places.
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too.
For when he died, he took a part of you.

No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes.
No explanations, no fucking reasons why.
I watched it eat you up, pieces falling on the floor.
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore.

If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way.
I would climb my way to heaven, and bring him back home.
Don't give up hope, my friend, this is not the end.

We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore.
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places.
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too.
For when he died, he took a part of you.

Death is only a chapter, so lets rip out the pages of yesterday.
Death is only a horizon. And I'm ready for sun to set.

THIS IS SUICIDE SEASON!

[whispering:]
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way.
we would climb my way to heaven, and bring home again. [x2]

This is Suicide Season. [x2]

If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way.
We would climb my way to heaven, and bring home again. [x2]

If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way.
We would climb my way to heaven, and bring home again. [x3]

We would do anything to get him back to you.
We would do anything to end what your going through.
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way.
I would climb my way to heaven, and bring him back home.
I would do anything to bring him back to you.
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew.
