My heartâs a hieroglyph, it talks in tongues.
Ten thousand voices fill my broken lungs. But through the white
Wave I still hear it call. So take a deep breath, letâs disappear.
No â one will miss us, so why are we still here? And in the black
Hole you will see it all.

'cause this is not enough and I wonât wait for them to cut me up. So
Give me all youâve got, theyâll never stop until they see it fall,
So letâs run.

Your headâs a hurricane, it moves in wave. A perfect storm that
Keeps you wide awake. But through the silence you will feel
It burn. So take my hand and letâs fade away. You know thereâs
Nothing here to make us stay. And in the darkness you will see
The sun.

So letâs run away, 'cause everythingâs broken and weâre so much
More than another brick in the grey. So give it your every, give
Me your everything and letâs get away, 'cause everythingâs broken,
I know that weâre more than another brick in the grey. So give it
Your every. Give me your everything.
