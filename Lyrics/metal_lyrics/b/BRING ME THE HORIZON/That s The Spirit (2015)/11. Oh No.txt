You don't have to lie I know exactly where youâve been. 'cause youâre chewing
Off my ear while youâre chewing on your chin.

No weâre not on the level, youâre just off your face. Itâs not a state of
Mind no, your headâs just in a state. I may be on the outside but youâre
Empty within. Itâs getting kind of old now, I think itâs time to pack it in.

Donât call it a party, 'cause it never stops. Now one is too many but itâs never
Enough. Donât tell me youâre happy, 'cause this isnât love, so be careful what
You wish for.

Who you trying to fool? You know youâre in over your head. 'cause youâre
Holding onto heaven but youâre hanging by a thread.

Oh no.
