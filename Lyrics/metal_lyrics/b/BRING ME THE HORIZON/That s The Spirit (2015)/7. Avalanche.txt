Cut me open and tell me whatâs inside.
Diagnose me 'cause I canât keep wondering why.
And no, itâs not a phase 'cause it happens all the time.
Start over, check again, now tell me what you find.

'Cause Iâm going out of frequency.
Can anyone respond?

Itâs like an avalanche,
I feel myself go under,
'Cause the weight of itâs like hands around my neck.
I never stood a chance,
My heart is frozen over,
And I feel like I am treading on thin ice.

Am I broken? Whatâs the chance I will survive?
Donât sugarcoat me, 'cause I feel like suicide.
Just give it to me straight 'cause Iâm running out of time.
I need an antidote, now what can you prescribe?

It's like an avalanche
I feel myself go under
'Cause the weight of it's like hands around my neck
I never stood a chance
My heart is frozen over
And I feel like I am treading on thin ice

And Iâm going under.

I need a cure for me,
'Cause a square doesnât fit the circle.
Give me a remedy,
'Cause my head wasnât wired for this world.

I need a cure for me
'Cause a square doesn't fit the circle
Give me a remedy
'Cause my head wasn't wired for this world

'Cause I'm going out of frequency
Can anyone respond?
'Cause I'm going out of frequency
Can anyone respond?

It's like an avalanche
I feel myself go under
'Cause the weight of it's like hands around my neck
I never stood a chance
My heart is frozen over
And I feel like I am treading on thin ice

And I'm going under

I need a cure for me
'Cause a square doesn't fit the circle
Give me a remedy
'Cause my head wasn't wired for this world

I need a cure for me
'Cause a square doesn't fit the circle
Give me a remedy
'Cause when it hits, well it hits like an avalanche.
