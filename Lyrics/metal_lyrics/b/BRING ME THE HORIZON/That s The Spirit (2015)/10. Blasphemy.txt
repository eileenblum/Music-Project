Ask no questions and youâll get no lies. Turn the cheek and blind
The eye (let it go). Bend the knee and give away your life. Bite
Your tongue and close your mind (never know).

It makes no sense but it must be right, the blood and sweat you
Sacrificed. Was it all for nothing? 'cause weâve found no sign and
Weâve seen no light, we hear no voice when we pray at night but
We swore and now itâs too late to turn back.

Youâre not blessed, youâre cursed and itâs getting worse now.

Youâve got hell to pay, but you already sold your soul. Itâs
Blasphemy, but the words donât make sense no more. What would
Your mother say? Your has immured. So donât try and
Tell me that you still believe, no donât preach to me.
