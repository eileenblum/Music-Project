Iâve had enough
Thereâs a voice in my head
Says Iâm better off dead
But if I sing along
A little fucking louder to a happy song
Iâll be alright
You want to give up
Gave it all that you got
And it still doesnât cut
But if you sing along
A little fucking louder to a happy song
Youâll be just fine cosâ

Every now and again we get that feeling
And the great big void inside us opens up
And I really wish that you could help
But my head is like a carousel
&amp; Iâm going round in circles
Going round in circles.

We are possessed
Weâre all fucked in the head
Alone &amp; depressed

But if we sing along
A little fucking louder
To a happy song
Maybe weâll forget cos'

Every now and again we get that feeling
And the great big void inside us opens up
And I really wish that you could help
But my head is like a carousel
And I'm going round in circles

Donât wake us up
Weâd rather just keep dreaming
Cos' the nightmares in our heads are bad enough
And I really wish that you could help
But my head is like a carousel
&amp; Iâm going round in circles
Going round in circles

The world has coalesced
Into one giant mess
Of hate &amp; unrest
So letâs all sing along
A little god damn louder
To a happy song
And pretend itâs all ok
Thatâs the spirit.
