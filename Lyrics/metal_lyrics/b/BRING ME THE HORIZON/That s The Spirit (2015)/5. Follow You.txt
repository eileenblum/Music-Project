My head is haunting me and my heart feels like a ghost.
I need to feel something 'cause Iâm still so far from home.

Cross your heart and hope to die,
Promise me youâll never leave my side.

Show me what I canât see when the spark in my eyes is gone.
You got me on my knees, Iâm your one man cult.

Cross my heart and hope to die.
Promise you Iâll never leave your side.

'Cause Iâm telling you, youâre all I need.
I promise you, youâre all I see,
'Cause Iâm telling you, youâre all I need.
Iâll never leave.

So you can drag me through hell,
If it meant I could hold your hand.
I will follow you, 'cause Iâm under your spell
And you can throw me to the flames,
I will follow you.
I will follow you.

Come sink into me and let me breathe you in.
Iâll be your gravity, you be my oxygen,

So dig two graves 'cause when you die,
I swear Iâll be leaving by your side.

So you can drag me through Hell
If it meant I could hold your hand
I will follow you cause I'm under your spell
And you can throw me to the flames

I will follow you so you can drag me through Hell
If it meant I could hold your hand
I will follow you cause I'm under your spell
And you can throw me to the flames
I will follow you, I will follow you
I will follow you, I will follow you

So you can drag me through Hell
If it meant I could hold your hand
I will follow you cause I'm under your spell
And you can throw me to the flames
I will follow you, I will follow you
