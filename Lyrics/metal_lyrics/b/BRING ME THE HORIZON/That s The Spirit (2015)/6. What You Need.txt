Youâre hypnotized, canât see the signs,
Iâd like to help you, but I think itâs too late.
Made up your mind and now youâre blind,
I guess itâs easier than making mistakes.

Donât ask me why to roll your eyes at the answer
You want to fight but I wonât bite on the bait.
And Iâm not trying to change
Your eyes so donât panic 'cause Iâm not selling

So donât tell me what I can't see,
'cause we both know itâs you not me.
You donât want this, but itâs what you need
And youâll see it when you believe.

You'll see it, you'll see it
You'll see it when you believe
You'll see it, you'll see it
And you'll see it when you believe

Give me a break, 'cause I canât take
Another second, youâre a fucking headache.
I ainât got time to change your mind,
How can I move you when youâre stuck in your ways?

Donât ask me why to roll your eyes at the answer
You want to fight but I wonât bite on the bait.
And Iâm not trying to change
Your eyes so donât panic
I'm just saying, no I'm just saying

Don't come crawling back to me when you break down
Cause you dug yourself into this hole all by yourself
Don't come crawling back to me when you break down
You can find somebody else...

So don't tell me what I can't see
Cause we both know it's you, not me
You don't want this but it's what you need
And you'll see it when you believe

So don't tell me what I can't see
Cause we both know it's you, not me
You don't want this but it's what you need
And you'll see it when you believe

You'll see it, you'll see it
You'll see it when you believe
You'll see it, you'll see it
You'll see it when you believe

Yeah, hell yeah. You make me wanna slit my wrists &amp; play in my own blood.
Yeah, hell yeah. You make me wanna kill myself just for the fucking fun.

Yeah, hell yeah
You make me want to slit my wrists and play in my own blood
Yeah, hell yeah
You make me want to kill myself just for the fucking fun

So don't tell me what I can't see
Cause we both know it's you, not me
You don't want this but it's what you need
And you'll see it when you believe
And you'll see it when you believe
