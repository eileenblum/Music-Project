[feat. Orifice Vulgatron]Donât look down.
Letâs go.

Youâll never take me
Youâll never win
If Iâm going down,
Youâre coming with me.
Iâll never shut down,
Iâll never sleep.
If Iâm going down,
Iâll take the world with me.

Yo,
The Devilâs at your door,
You sold your soul,
Now heâs coming back for more
No fighting it, it will only make it worse.
You signed the line,
You said the words.
Get ready for the end of everything.
(Donât look down)
Get ready for the end of everything.

Yo,
The Devilâs at your door,
(The Devilâs at your door)
You sold your soul now heâs coming back for more.
Donât fight it, it will only make it worse.
You signed the line, you said the words.
Get ready for the end of everything.
Get ready for the end of everything.

What have you done?
Youâve opened it now.
And Iâm not sure thereâs anyway round.
Why do you run?
Itâs tripping me out.
And I donât know if I can keep up with you now.

The sky is falling,
The sun is burning,
A hallway to our eyes.
The ground will open
Like an ocean,
And swallow us alive.
You say you swear to god,
Now swear to me!
You say you swear to god,
Now swear to me!
