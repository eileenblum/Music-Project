Show me a sign, show me a reason to give
A solitary fuck about your god damn beliefs
I'm going blind, but one thing's clear
Death is the only salvation you'll feel

Brick by brick by brick...
Brick by brick by brick...

What you call faith, I call a sorry excuse
Cloak and daggers murder the truth
A bitter taste, there's nothing else
I'll bow for your king when he shows himself

Brick by brick by brick
These walls begin to cave in
The house of wolves you built
Is burning a thousand suns

Show me your face, show me a reason to think
My soul can't be saved if I sell you my sins
I'm going blind, but one thing's clear
Death is the only salvation for me

Brick by brick by brick
These walls begin to cave in
The house of wolves you built
Is burning a thousand suns

(The house of wolves you built)
(The nest of wolves you built)

The house of wolves you built
Will burn just like a thousand suns

So when you die, the only kingdom you'll seeâ
Is two-foot wide and six feet deep!

Yeah!

And when you die, the only kingdom you'll seeâ
Is two-foot wide and six feet deep!

And when you die, the only kingdom you'll seeâ
Is two-foot wide and six feet deep!

Brick by brick by brick...
Brick by brick by brick...

Brick by brick by brick
These walls begin to cave in
The house of wolves you built
Is burning a thousand suns

Brick by brick by brick
These walls begin to cave in
The house of wolves you built
Will burn just like a thousand suns

You said you want me?
Now I'm here, now I'm here, now I'm here!
You said you want me?
Now I'm here, now I'm here, now I'm here!
