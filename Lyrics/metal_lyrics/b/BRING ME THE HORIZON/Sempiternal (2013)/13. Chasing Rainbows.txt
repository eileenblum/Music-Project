[Deluxe Edition Bonus Disc (The Deathbeds EP) Track]They drag me underground
The lights are slowly fading
The world I thought I knew
I never knew at all

The dead don't make a sound
Unless you're chasing rainbows
And then they scream your name
Clawing at the gates

So pull me out
And hold me down
Let's find a way
To lose ourselves

Take me to the sun
I feel I'm chasing rainbows
And now I'm lost and all alone
Waiting for a chance to

Sink my teeth into
Another desperation
Now into your lonely
Paradise

Are we just dreaming
In the city that never sleeps?
'Cause I can't be seeing
What my eyes tell me

Am I just dreaming?
This can't be in my veins
Everything I ever knew
Will never be the same

(So chew me up, and spit me out
Let's take a way to save ourselves)

So pull me out
And hold me down
Let's find a way
To lose ourselves

Take me to the sun
I feel I'm chasing rainbows
And now I'm lost and all alone
Waiting for a chance to

Sink my teeth into
Another desperation
Now into your lonely
Paradise

And now i feel it
Yeah, i feel it in my blood

I can't fight this anymore
I've given up
I've given up

Take me to the sun
I feel I'm chasing rainbows
And now I'm lost and all alone
Waiting for a chance to

Sink my teeth into
Another desperation
Now into your lonely
Paradise

Take me to the sun
I feel I'm chasing rainbows
And now I'm lost and all alone
Waiting for a chance to

Sink my teeth into
Another desperation
Now into your lonely
Paradise

YEAAAAAAAH!!
