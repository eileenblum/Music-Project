Middle fingers up, if you don't give a fuck!
I'm sick to death of swallowing, every single thing I'm fed.
Middle fingers up, if you don't give a fuck!
You think you're changing anything?
Quick! Change everything!
The world is a shit tip, your children are fucked
The ones you think guard you, are out for your blood
When minds are battered and washed out with style
But what exactly do you think you're gonna do?

United, we'll fail
Divided, we'll fall
We're fucked, but you're makin' it worse
United, we'll fail
Divided, we'll fall
Give up, 'cause you're makin' it so much worse

Middle fingers up, if you don't give a fuck!
I'm sick to death of swallowing every single thing I'm fed
Middle fingers up, if you don't give a fuck!
You think you're changing anything?
Quick! Change everything!

Oh, give me a break you deluded, ireful, self-serving prick
If you really believe in the words that you preach,
Get off your screens, and onto the streets

There will be no peaceful revolution!
No war without blood!
You can say I'm just a fool, that stands for nothing
Well, to that,
I say you're a cunt!

(Kick it!)

United, we'll fail
Divided, we'll fall
United, we'll fail
We're fucked, but you're makin' it worse!

Middle fingers up, if you don't give a fuck!
I'm sick to death of swallowing every single thing I'm fed.
Middle fingers up, if you don't give a fuck!
You think you're changing anything?
Quick! Change everything!
