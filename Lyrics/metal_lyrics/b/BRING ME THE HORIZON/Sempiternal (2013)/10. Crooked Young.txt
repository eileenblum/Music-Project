Believe in no one!

Hallelujah!
Well, I'm saved!
Just a dozen steps and 28 days...
It's a miracle, I'll be born again!
With the Lord as my shepherd...
I will find a way!

FUCK YOUR FAITH!
No one's gonna save you!

FUCK YOUR FAITH!

There's no hope for us
We speak in tongues
Blacker than the sun
No, death can't touch...
The crooked young

There's no hope for us
We speak in tongues
Blacker than the sun
No, death can't touch...
The crooked young

The crooked young!

We don't sleep, we don't eat
We speak in tongues
We can't die, we're dead inside
No, death can't touch...
The crooked young

Believe in no one
Find yourself
The faceless won't save you
The clouds won't hear your fucking prayers

(There's no hope for us)
(We speak in tongues)
(Blacker than the sun)
(No, death can't touch...)
(The crooked young)

Hallelujah!
I'm saved!
It's a miracle... thank you Jesus!
Halleluja!
I'm saved!

FUCK YOUR FAITH!
FUCK YOUR FAITH!
