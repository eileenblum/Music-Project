Every second's soaked in sadness
Every weekend is a war
And I'm drowning in the dÃ©ja vu
We've seen it all before

I don't wanna do this by myself
I don't wanna live like a broken record
I've heard these lines a thousand times
And I've seen it all before

Are we close enough?
There is something I must confide
I think we've lost our touch
There's no sparkle in those eyes

What an awful mess I've made
There's nothing left to save

Every second's soaked in sadness
Every weekend is a war
And I'm drowning in the dÃ©ja vu
We've seen it all before

I don't wanna do this by myself
I don't wanna live like a broken record
I've heard these lines a thousand times
And I've seen it all before

(There's nothing in the air tonight...)

Every second's soaked in sadness
Every weekend is a war
And I'm drowning in the dÃ©ja vu
We've seen it all before

I don't wanna do this by myself
I don't wanna live like a broken record
I've heard these lines a thousand times
And I've seen it all before

I'm sorry, no... it's not enough
We shouldn't feel a love so painfully
It hurts right to the touch
I know it stings, I know this cuts
And I wish I could agree with you
But fuck this love, it's not enough

It's not enough...
It's not enough...
