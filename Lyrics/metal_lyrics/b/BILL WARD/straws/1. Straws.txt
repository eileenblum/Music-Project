Iâm sorry to wake you from
Your sleep
Now baby open up your eyes

We have to go downstairs
Find some shelter
Get some help
And stay alive

How am I supposed to save you
In this chaos
Clinging, please donât die

Where are the defenses
We were promised, oh I hope that theyâve arrived

M8 Bring it on, the misery, tonight
Come and tell the story here tonight

We never ever have to even look
no no
no no
no no

Turn away, we never have to look
no no
no no
no no
Put your eyes on mine forever
This will be our last endeavor
Baby we wonât ever have to look

Daddyâs in the Army, Daddyâs in the Army
And, Mommyâs joining too
God help all the countries
They do know what they do

We never ever have to even look
no no
no no
no no

Turn away, we never have to look
no no
no no
no no

Hell bound in the senses
Much too late to point and blame
When questioning why

Letâs pretend that weâre dancing
As in yesterday, when it was stars that
filled the sky
Yeah, sky

M8 Bring it on, the misery, tonight
Come and tell the story here tonight

We never ever have to even look
no no
no no
no no

Turn away, we never have to look
no no
no no
no no

Put your eyes on mine forever
This will be our last endeavor
Baby we wonât ever have to look
