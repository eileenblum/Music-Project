Those being very small
Have been heard to say
That being small's OK.

Those getting rather big
May come to find
They've left their space behind.

Hey, yeah, you
Living in the middle
Too afraid to come out
Hanging on to your pride
So uneasy.

All fall down, it makes no difference
God Almighty holds the balance here
Get out, get out, get out of here.

We collide, how formal,
Is that why we're here?

Those going all the way
Have been heard to say
That being here's OK.

[Repeat 3rd Verse]

All fall down, it makes no difference.
God Almighty, hold the balance here
Get out, get out, get out of here.

We collide, how formal.
And gain control,
Then fall of the edge.
