Ups Downs Reds Whites
Continued over using
Everything on lower shelf
Is guaranteed for self abusing

The lights are out,
There's no one home boys.
I know it well,
The magic's gone.
By self design,
The egos fallen.
Look out
I died a thousand years ago.

[Repeat Beginning Chant with:]
It's happened, will happen, what happened.
Might happen, did happen can
Zero at the point of it all
Just happened, did happen, what happened.
Might happen, did happen can
Zero at the point of it all
Who holds the hand of doom these days?

Hangs out with pain,
It's poison.
Forget the dreams
They'll blow away.
Romantic nights,
With friends like I.V.
Look out,
What madness, my we lie so well

It happened, can happen, what happened,
Might happen, it happened,
Zero at the point of it all.
Just happened, it happened, yeah happened.
Did happen, can happen.
Zero at the point of it all,
It happened, can happen, what happened,
Yeah happened, did happen
Zero at the point of it all.
It just happened, might happen, did happen,
Will happen, can happen
Zero at the point of it all,
What happened, just happened, it happened,
Might happen, yeah happened

[And Chant with 2nd Chorus simultaneously:]

When you close your eyes at night,
Are you
Are you
Are you
Are you
Still breathing

When?

Just happened, yeah happened, can happen
Did happen, will happen.
Zero at the point of it all,
It happened, can happen, yeah happened,
Might happen, just happened
Zero at the point of it all.
It happened, will happen, did happen,
Yeah happened, can happen
Zero at the point of it all.
All my knock down tears have washed me
home.
