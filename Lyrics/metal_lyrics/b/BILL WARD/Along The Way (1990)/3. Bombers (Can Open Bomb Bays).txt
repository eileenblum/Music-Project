Listen my son,
One thing I've learned
And I know it.
Bombers can open bomb bays

Love all you can
This precious thing
Called your own life.
Remember, bombers can open bomb bays.

Might you meet somebody
That has your mother's eyes and smile.
Might you meet them,
Don't blow them away.
Don't hurt them, just hold them,
Make someone happy.

The things you do, it's up to you,
Try being happy.
And I say I can believe it,
And I do.
I do believe there's hope for you.

You
There's hope for you.
You
There's hope for you

Listen my son,
I'm in a war
And I know it,
Remember, bombers can open bomb bays.

Complimentary worship
May close your many open doors.
Might you be cool,
Don't get blown away,
Don't hurt you, just hold you
And make you happy.

The things you do, it's up to you
Try being happy.
And I say I can believe it,
And I do.
I do believe there's hope for you.

[Repeat Bridge Twice]
