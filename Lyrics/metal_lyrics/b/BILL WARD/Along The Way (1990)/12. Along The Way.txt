Me,
I'm just a being here.
My heart cries out,
But no one's near.
I'm just a being here,
Down city road.

After the darkest day
I have been heard to say
Nothing feels better than
Being so close to you.
Fish in the trees
And birds swimming in seas
Oh God,
Cover your frozen eyes,
That's when the laughter died out.

All along the way
