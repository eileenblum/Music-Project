There's no excuse any more since the fire,
Since the whole house burned down.
Blow off the lid when my future demand
I make profit from my yesterday,
Biding my time just to work on the moves.
Why, why,

I feel the growing city winds,
Bye, bye, bye, bye
Oh, the survivor's out again,
Bye, bye, bye, bye
Life has arrived, I am amazed,
Bye, bye, bye, bye
Learning how not to rape the day,
Bye, bye, bye, bye
Goodbye, terror, 'til we meet again.

Oh what a fantasy, being alive when I'm dead
Dead dead dead dead dead dead dead dead

Out from the jar called the King of Ballet,
"If you want, I'll call you every day."
Keeping the trinkets from worlds left behind
And the owner didn't see or mind.
Knowing the difference sure hurts, but it helps
Why, why.

I feel the growing city winds.
Bye, bye, bye, bye
Here's where they and I begin,
Bye, bye, bye, bye
Perfect conditions on parade,
Bye, bye, bye, bye
Off with the mask, you're done and paid.
Bye, bye, bye, bye
Goodbye, terror, 'til we meet again
