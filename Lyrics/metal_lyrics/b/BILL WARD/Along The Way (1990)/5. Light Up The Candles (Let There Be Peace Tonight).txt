Light up the candles,
Let there be peace tonight
Throw out the pain that made you cry.

Up to the rafters,
Watch the candlelight glow.
Follow your heart, see where it goes.

Don't forget your prayers
Before your bedtime.
No more talking, too.
No more wars or hurt
Before your bedtime.
Place your head upon whatever
You've been chosen to call bed.
And while you're sleeping,
Bye, bye, di li li li
And while you're sleeping.

Light up the candles,
Leave the rest of the day,
Follow your dreams and float away.

[Repeat Chorus]

Conscience tells
The present story
In a room below.

I know I ask for much tonight.
Too much to ask for peace tonight.
I know I ask for much tonight.
Too much to as for peace tonight.
