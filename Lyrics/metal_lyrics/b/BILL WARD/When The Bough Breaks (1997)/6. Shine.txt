I light my cigarette
Oh no, I ain't quit yet
I ponder for a while
And then begin to smile

I might not get well
I might not seek help
I'm only human after all
Oh what a poor excuse
But one I can always use
When I can't imagine growth at all

At the watershed
Non-wrong watershed
I lie bathing in my itsy bitsy bitsy life
I say thanks and then
Feel indifferent and
Keep on basking in my itsy bitsy bitsy life
My itsy bitsy bitsy life, my itsy bitsy bitsy life, my itsy bitsy bitsy
life

Find
Love
And
Shine
Shine
