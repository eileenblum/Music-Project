Look in my eyes, can you see who I am
Look in my eyes, see if you understand
Troubled and hardened there's safety in rage
So when I was a child I kept building a cage

Look in my eyes, can you see who I am
Look in my eyes, can you see who I am
Look in my eyes, can you see who I am
Look in my eyes, can you see who I am

I felt love fragment heartache
In my body as a child
Oh yeah and I remember
Being taught to not run wild

What about all those promises
And the failures to proceed
And I seem to recall now
My own hunger and your greed

Look in my eyes and you see who I am
Look in my eyes see if you understand
With complex compassion, I've tried to stay near
But when you found wrong I would never appear

Look in my eyes, can you see who I am
Look in my eyes, can you see who I am
Look in my eyes, can you see who I am
Look in my eyes, can you see who I am

When I searched for the father
And the son and the holy ghost
I felt blows from my neighbors
Who were lost and hurt me most

For the millions of children
The Sao Paulos everywhere
I've remembered who I am
I'm a child who wants to share

Look in my eyes, can you see who I am
Look in my eyes, see if you understand
Troubled and hardened there's safety in rage
So when I was a child I kept building a cage

Look in my eyes, can you see who I am

[Repeat to fade]
