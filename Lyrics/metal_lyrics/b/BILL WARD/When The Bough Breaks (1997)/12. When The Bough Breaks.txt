Are you doing alright
Do you feel very well
Are there things in your life you've always wanted
Like respect, prestige and so on
Can you tell

Working so hard
For the things that you want
But lose anyway
Isn't it sad that the things that we have
We lose anyway

Any day now
It's gonna come
Any day now
Hold on
Hold on hold on hold on
Hold on
Hold on hold on hold on

When the bough breaks
When the bough breaks
You really know it
Yeah you really know it
You really know it
Yeah you really know know know know know know know

When the bough breaks
When the bough breaks
You really know it
You really know it know it know it
You really know when you're there
'Cause you're there
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah

Have you ever counted just
How many times you've traveled to tomorrow
Seeing this, discounting that
And thinking how great it will be once in tomorrow

Can you reach out with your waiting arms
And meet a man who loves broken hearts
Hello

What about dreams
Have you had many dreams
Do they float away
Shivering slightly to know how it is
Is there loss hey hey

Any day now
It's gonna come
Any day now
Hold on
Hold on hold on hold on
Hold on
Hold on hold on hold on

When the bough breaks
When the bough breaks
You really know it
You really know it know it
You really know it
Know know know know know know know

When the bough breaks
When the bough breaks
You really know it
You really know it know it know it
You really know when you're there
'Cause you're there
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Have you ever counted just
How many times we travel to tomorrow
Seeing this, discounting that
And thinking how great it will be once in tomorrow

Can you reach out with your waiting arms
And meet a man who loves broken hearts
Hello

And meet a man who loves broken hearts
