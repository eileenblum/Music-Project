Well all that I know
It takes a cold heart, cold heart
To tear things apart
And turn something into nothing, nothing

It's been so hard, hard
To love the cold heart, cold heart
That tore things apart
And turned something into nothing, nothing

Ain't that the way it goes
Ain't that the way it goes
It always seems to go
It always seems to go
Into nothing, nothing

Well all that I know
It may take a while, a while
To let yourself smile
After something, turns to nothing, nothing

All the heartaches, heartaches
Come up with the sun, the sun
So mangled and done, so done
Because something turned to nothing, nothing

Ain't that the way it goes
Ain't that the way it goes
It always seems to go
It always seems to go
Into nothing, nothing
