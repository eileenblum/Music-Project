A light in the eyes, and
A smile on the face, Oh
The innocence blows one away

God bless all the laughter
The children's dear laughter
It's something so special, so gay

When they fall down
I feel sad
They're falling down
Real, real bad

Children killing children
What's this all about
Children killing children
What's this all about

I almost denied it
The fact that they're dying
And seeking approval each day

What absolute chaos
When babies are murdered
By bullets that just went astray

When they fall down
I feel sad
They're falling down
Real, real bad

Children killing children
What's this all about
Children killing children
What's this all about

When they fall down
I feel sad
They're falling down
Real, real bad

Children killing children
What's this all about

[Repeat to fade]
