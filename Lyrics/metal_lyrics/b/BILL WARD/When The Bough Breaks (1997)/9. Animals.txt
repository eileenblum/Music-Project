In a meadow of grass and golden light
A noble is born to fall in flight
While the slaughter to feed just grows and grows
Where's the pity for those who serve our souls

Animal animal run away
Animal animal don't delay

Oh what a shame
Savour the blood and guts of it all
Ball and chain
Over and over again

With the wind at your back on rainy nights
Do you ever give thanks and say alright
For the leather that's warmed the self esteem
While the humble and dumb provide the screams

Animal animal run away
Animal animal don't delay

Oh what a shame
Wearing the cuts and the bruise of it all
Ball and chain
Over and over again
