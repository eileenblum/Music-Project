Sit quietly
After dark
Sit quietly
When it's dark
The air is clean, it heals the lungs
The moon is full, and forest songs
Heard only at this time of night
Just seems to make it all feel right

Step lightly
On the grass
Step lightly
In the grass
In green fields with a breeze that plays
With leaves that seek a resting place
A clay pot holds sweet water clear
There is no thirst or chaos here

I'm not so tired
So very tired

Put down the tow line
The toil and sweat is done today
You get your food
You get your life
You get your food
You get your life

Deep in the furrows
The aching soul has earned it's pay
You get your food
You get your life
You get your food
You get your life

Resting a while it's so nice here
Oh yes it helps to make things clear
So clear

Get easy
When you can
Get easy
If you can
The back is cracked and feels so straight
This is a time to celebrate
With no more debts to pay today
The touch, the smell, the taste can play

I'm not so tired
But more inspired

Put down the tow line
The toil and sweat is done today
You get your food
You get your life
You get your food
You get your life

Deep in the furrows
The aching soul has earned it's pay
You get your food
You get your life
You get your food
You get your life

Resting a while it's so nice here
Oh yes it helps to make things clear
So clear
Resting a while it's so nice here
Oh yes it helps to make things very clear
So clear
