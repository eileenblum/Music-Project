Near a lake
Compelled, I made a start
The kind that comes when feeling torn apart
I daren't believe it
Drained through holes, just like you and me
Past the words of insincerity
I daren't believe it
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
I just didn't want to believe it
But the truths let me in
Yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh

Lift me up
Lift me up
Take me down to where the calm is
Where my lies deny the light is
Lift me up
Lift me up
Past the years and years of feeding

My distortions and my bleeding
'Cause I daren't believe it
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
I just didn't want to believe it
But the truths let me in
Truths let me in
Yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh

I said I daren't believe it
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
I just didn't want to believe it
But the truths let me in
Let me in yeh
Yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh

Growing up, I feared the boy
And who he was, I just ignored him
Weightless eyes, it's come to this
I have to trust what's healthy for him
Oh dear, is that my tear

Growing up, I watched the boy
He turned to freedoms that could numb forever
Then a kiss, a final kiss
Gave closure to what was
In not one minute
Oh my, home from the big lie

An imminent clear passage
Sends a chill into my back
And what's more threatening now
Is that there's no way to turn back
I, friend of mine, friend of mine
Don't know what to say, time out, time out
Don't know where we can go from here, Love
I'm friend of mine, friend of mine
Finally meeting you, time out, time out
Don't know where we go from here, love
OK
OK

When I was a child,
I heard you calling
When I was a child,
I took the heat
I heard you calling
But I couldn't stand up
On my two feet
And I kept watching you
I was watching you
And I'd follow all the things
You'd have to do
Yes all the time
I kept hearing you
I was hearing you
And I really liked an awful lot of you
Most of the time

And now I've learned
That when I'm ready to trust
I'll let you know
I said when I feel like I am ready to trust
I'll let you know
