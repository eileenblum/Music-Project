Agnutpaat, ei bibeker majhe aaj
ekadhik jiboner rupgolpo, tarie berieche amay
manush er kolpo chinta dharay
shorger lobh, ajana kumrarir lalosha
bibeker bishorjon, manushotter atmahuti
adhare nipito jogot
Unmader ei dunia,
amar paap er puron oi nishpaap er rokte
shopner jogote r koto?
rupkothar dohai r noi
ei kalponik bondhur eeti kothay?
angikaar amar shob bondhon chire felar

[English translation:]

Emission of fire from within this conscience
The fairy tale of two lives have been chasing me
Into the imagination of humankinds
Greed for the heaven, lust for the severe virgins
Sacrificing the discretion, self-immolation of humanness
The world into the darkness
This world by the lunatics
Blood of the innocentâs may wash my sins away
How long more to live in to this imaginary world?
No more for the sake of their fairy tales
Where is the end of this imaginary friendship?
This promise of mine to tear all strings attached.
