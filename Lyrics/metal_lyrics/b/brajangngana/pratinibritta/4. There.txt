âBeneath this barren sun, Iâm crawling alone for the glory, for my pride, for tomorrow
Sacred their words were, nothing but all delusional. All for nothing, an eye for an eyeâ

âAm I still dreaming?? Or have I been fooled?â
âThis flame does not burn anymore, those moths can't fly any long
Do you know what I have felt, when I touched those flames??â

âWake up, wake up, itâs time for you to leave. Stand up, stand up, abandon your dreamsâ

âNever, I wonât give up until I know the truth
I wonât leave my demise, I will not disappear.â

âBeneath this barren sun, Iâm crawling alone for the glory, for my pride, for tomorrow
Sacred their words were, nothing but all delusional. All for nothing, an eye for an eyeâ

âOh my dear mother, why was I here? What was my purpose of living?
Why did I chase a mirage? There never was any truth, there never was anything for me.
There never was any kingdom, there never was the 7^th sky, all I had are gone now,
Everyone I loved are gone, are gone, for nothing.
