Silent screams echoed through the roof of my head
broken dreams of a God faltered beyond

Nikunje ami eka tomar ei daar e, shomoy er krantilogne.
Nishthur ei duniar maya charte,
tomar chorone mor tai

Ashampto ei bondi khachar shamapto ta dekte cheye
arji amar tomar kache, dhikkar ei dunia ke.
dhikkar ei durbolotar dhikkar ei artonad er,
adhikar mor chole jabar, tomar shei omriter rajje
jekhane amie shob, chiro niddrar shamudre,
tori bherabo na kono khone
baibo na ar karo jonne, thambo na ar karo daake,
ei shopno mor, bhangar dekhar.

shurjer chaya te rattrir alo te
amar shei jotsna snan
aaj shei shob khoner shesh e,
hasbo ami toder dekhe

[English translation:]

Silent screams echoed through the roof of my head
broken dreams of a God faltered beyond

In this forgotten forest. I am lonely at your doorstep at the edge of my time. To leave these merciless world, on your feet is my home..

On this unending empty shell, trying to end, to see the end is my desire to you. Hell with this world, hell with this weakness, hell with my inner scream. My rite to leave, to your sweet kingdom. Where I am the only one. Will sail in the sea of the forever sleep, will
no drop my anchor for anyone. Will no sail for anyone, will no stop for anyone. This is my dream, to dream, to falter.

That moonlight shower beneath the shadow of the sun, in the light of the night
At the end of all these times, I will laugh thy all.
