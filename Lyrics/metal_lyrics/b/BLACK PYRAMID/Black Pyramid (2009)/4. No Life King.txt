Fast asleep on his throne made from mortal bone
In the crypts lies the No Life King
But his slumber will break and his carnage he'll take
The slayer of man things

When the armies of night with his powers unite
And the moon is as black as his blood
Then the rivers will boil as the undead they toil
Ashes where man once stood

Send a plague on the land with a touch of his hand
Smash the gates of the cities and towns
Steal away with their souls to his castle below
We'll make our last stand

So go hide in the sun when the war is begun
Run away from the No Life King
For his armies are vast and his talons are fast
He'll have your blood to drink
