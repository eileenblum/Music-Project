The Lords of the Demonland
The slayers of the Witch-born kings
The conquerors of the Ghoulish hand
The keepers of the diamond rings
The wielders of the silver spears
Their ships flying silken sails
They search for the Worm Ouroboros
It eats its own tail

The riders of the golden griffins
The gods grant their every whim
They wish that the Witchlords be reborn
To kill them all again
