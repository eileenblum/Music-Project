The wasps have smashed their nests again
Stinging me solemnly for my sins
The winter of my disgrace
A failed god for the failure race
Death rides the cold that bleeds from my eyes

Nothing you can do will make me change my ways
I will hate you all until the stars decay
With darkness all around the ice consumes my speech
Condemning me to dreams that are just beyond my reach

Take me to the one who can make my world complete
Build the bridge across the void beneath my feet
Reaching for the realms that mere mortals may not know
And trampling on the tracks laid softly in the snow
