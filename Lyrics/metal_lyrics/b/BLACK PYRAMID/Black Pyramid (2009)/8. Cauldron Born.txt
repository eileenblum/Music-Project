Raise your spears to the sky
Suffer no pain when it's your turn to die
Fall but to rise once again
To defile your ancestors, murder your kin
The crawling chaos of old
Will course through your blood as it corrupts your soul
Eternal life is our prize
You'll see the Black Cauldron etched in our eyes

Armies of Arawn unite
The slaughter we serve, for The Death Lord we fight
Mute but swords tell our tales
Carved in our enemies' bones and entrails
The Cauldron Born is our name
Fall by her side and you'll become the same
One taste of her cast-iron will
Gives strength to the heart and the hand for the kill
