Made a pact with the twilight demons
Seemed the only way
Drew the circle of salt and semen
Held the daggers raised
In the deluge of smoke and cinder
Burned the shadow's eyes
In the mist hellfires did wither
Held me hypnotized

Going down today
Gonna die today
Into my twilight grave

Mind exploded with thoughts of terror
Glimpsed the final days
In the vision I beheld my error
But it melted away
I ate the flesh of unborn babies
I drank the blood of the dead
The lines were cast when the twilights changed me
And left a price on my head

So they sent the seers to hunt me
With their powers of old
Felt the weight of the hammer of evil
Crushing down on my soul
Never knew what would consume me
I'm condemned to die
The mist conceals what fate it feeds me
What it can never lie

I'm gonna die today
I'm going down today
Into my twilight grave
