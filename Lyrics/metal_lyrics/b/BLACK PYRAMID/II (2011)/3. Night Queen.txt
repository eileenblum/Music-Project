Far beyond the black void, past the solar sea
I gaze into the dark eyes staring back at me
Mistress of my sorrows, awake from cosmic tomb
To birth the thousand nightmares housed within her womb

Nightqueen's legions ride
Lucifer by her side
The things you fear the most
Refusing to see the ghost

Mistress of mistresses why do they call to me?
The spectres of the dead gods we nailed to the tree
You promised me these pleasures, you brought me only pain
And haunted me with visions that drive the world insane


Night Queen's legions ride
Lucifer by her side
The things you fear the most
Refusing to see the ghost
