Eye of the temple we behold
Stares at us with broken soul
The stars are written, we agree
Predating our calamity

Secret systems, ancient distance
Disparate engines, silent pistons
False horizons, black sun rising
Darkness falling, red moons calling

Hidden kingdom calls to me
Eclipsing our reality
Teachers of the broken fate
Spiral truth unfolds too late

Secret systems, ancient distance
Disparate engines, silent pistons
False horizons, black sun rising
Darkness falling, red moons calling
