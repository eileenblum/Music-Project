Live our lives amidst decay
Order's had her dying day
Come embrace our tarnished touch
The iron in your blood will rust

Visions turn to inner lands
Chaos shows her empty hands

Wheels of terror turn at last
Releasing us for final task
Human form we cast away
Avatars of earth's dismay

Visions turn to inner lands
Then chaos shows her empty hands

Lies!  Deceiver's eyes
Carve out the signs
Chaos is here

Bones! Born of the dead
Culled from our chest
Chaos is here

Lies! Deceiver's eyes
Carve out the signs
Chaos is here

Bones! Born of the dead
Culled from our chest
Chaos is here
