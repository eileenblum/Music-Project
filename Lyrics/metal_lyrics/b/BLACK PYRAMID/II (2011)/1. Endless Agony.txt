War tide comes sweeping across the land
Bones snap, blood splatters my hands
Axe swings I'll reap as swordsman strays
Tyrants behold the end of days

Worlds fade, death reigns
In this endless agony

War tide comes sweeping cross the earth
Moons sway, oceans collide in the girth
Earthquakes crush the mountains they make
Weep for the warrior torn in the wake

Worlds fade, death reigns
In this endless agony
