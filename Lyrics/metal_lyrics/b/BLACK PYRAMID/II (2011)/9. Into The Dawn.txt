When peace was over, war had past
I beheld the shades cast from my mind
Could not know what I'd become
Until I'd joined another of my kind

But I knew that I was dying
And I knew that I was gone
But my will, it never wavered
I held my vows until the dawn

Age of sorrow dies with me
Seeds grown from eternal tree I climb
Created branches that I grasp
What becomes me when I pass the sky

And I knew that I was dying
But I knew my straw was drawn
And my will, it never wavered
I burnt my vows into the dawn
