Sunken city calls to me
Burning into black boned tree
Run from death in dreamless state
Loathsome night behind the gate

Dreams of the dead
Dreams of the dead
Lie in broken head
The dreams of the dead

Knowledge cursed my frozen brain
Madness, cult of ancient pain
Blood lust conquer all who live
All the dies cannot forgive

Dreams of the dead
Dreams of the dead
Lie in broken head
The dreams of the dead
