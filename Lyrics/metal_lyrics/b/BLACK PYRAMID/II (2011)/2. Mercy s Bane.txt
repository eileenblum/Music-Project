We're murder madness
We're chaos crazed
We're starlight's sadness
We're darker days

We live for plunder
We'll steal your youth
We'll call down thunder
We'll show you truth

Moloch!  Burn them down
Raze their temples to the ground
Moloch!  Torch and slay
Make their blood your altar's prey


We're sons of fire
We're barren bred
We're death's desire
We're havoc's head

We'll rape your goddess
We'll flay your priest
We'll stand the tallest
We'll tame the beast

Moloch!  Burn them down
Raze their temples to the ground
Moloch!  Torch and slay
Make their blood your altar's prey

We're vicious violence
We're mercy's bane
We're stoic silence
We're panic's pain

We live for plunder
We'll steal your youth
We'll call down thunder
We'll show you truth

Moloch!  Burn them down
Raze their temples to the ground
Moloch!  Torch and slay
Make their blood your altar's prey
