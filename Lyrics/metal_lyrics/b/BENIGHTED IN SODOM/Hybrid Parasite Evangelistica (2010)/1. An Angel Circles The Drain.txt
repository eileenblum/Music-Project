Come find me frozen
I am bleeding away today in empty lights
Revolting and wailing
The godly are abusing needles like halos
You cannot wake me

Their vices oppress my grave from above Heaven

Now I gaze towards the sky
His glory is obscured by winding towers
Exalted are the spires that mock the horns
A continual silent punishment merely echoing in the valley of death

Now the righteous are diseased
Engineering pestilence for orphaned children
His grace devours the sun
His salvation courses through my veins
