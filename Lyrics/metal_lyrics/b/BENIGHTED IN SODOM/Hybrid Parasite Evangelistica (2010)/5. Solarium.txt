Forever, stranded in paradise
I will live to see blood pour from the sky like poetry from the lips of my accuser
He makes for me a table in the presence of mine enemies
To face scorn and derision
In a place above his right hand
Abuse yourselves and the ones you love
For this was all that I had left
Beyond the delusion of an eternity
Something much blacker is ever putrefying in time
And it pulsates through my veins
All I ever wanted was to be truly alive
And now I will truly die
Before your eyes, a thousand times
For the forgiveness of your sins and the perpetuity of chastisement
To what condemnation shall we be chastised beyond the grace of death?
To what shape of misery shall I offer this broken place?
Watch as I bleed behind your walls
I crumble unnoticed, without even a passing glance to validate my existence
