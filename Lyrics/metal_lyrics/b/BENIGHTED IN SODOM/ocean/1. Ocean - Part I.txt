When the dream began, I was in the water 
And I believe I was drowning 
All I could do was swim 
Towards the unforseen beaches 

So deep below me, so far before me 

The tides pull me away 
But still I swam 
Against the currents 
Towards the shore I could not see 
And behold, a tempest 
Harbinger of a tidal fear 

And it rained 
But still I swam against the currents 
Towards the sands of providence 

I grew weary and mortal 
And I drank the salts of fate 
I welcomed this final wave 
The end was beautiful 
100 CCs of utmost deliverance 
Comatose, I began to dream of myself 
I believe I was drowning
