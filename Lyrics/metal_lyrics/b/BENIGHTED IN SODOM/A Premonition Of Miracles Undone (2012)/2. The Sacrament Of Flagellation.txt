My portrait is a mosaic of disfigurement
A wrecked hive for the crawling larvae of terrible past lives
My sins are unforgivable and my faith is weak
Yet I am the beauty of so much pain and I dwell in the house of the lord

I cannot die
I can only relive as darkness within the forbidden corridors of time

Each day, I am the hurt that makes you love again
I am the sorrow of so many unfulfilled dreams
And I live within you
Beneath my ribs you'll prick your fingers
Just so that my heart can be yours...

Your access to the void;
Step inside, never look back
But remember this forever in my terrible sunshine
You returned, and achieved immortality
Be as I am today
Perish in the depths of becoming
That you would fall short of divinity
Because our destiny is reserved for sinners

And you were merely an insect
(Destroying yourself to be)
And you were merely an insect
(Destroying yourself to be)
And you were merely an insect
(Destroying yourself to be)
As a vagrant shadow

And you are merely an insect
(Destroying yourself to be)
And you are merely an insect
(Destroying yourself to be)
And you are merely an insect
(Destroying yourself to be closer now to God...)

I cannot die...
I live within you...
