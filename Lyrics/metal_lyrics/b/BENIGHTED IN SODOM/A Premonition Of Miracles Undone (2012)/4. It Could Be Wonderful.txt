All these things I have are yours
Not even time can destroy
All these things I have that you have lost
It breathes a life, it breeds a lie
All these things I have are yours
Not even time can destroy
All these things I have were once lost
It breathes a lie, it breeds a life

The twilight of life is nearly complete
And we see ourselves no longer as the distance fades away
The soil opens to devour us now
And recycle the essence of our decline
To be the darkness to overcome
And the book, it closes now
All these things are not mine to give away
That we can begin again, again...

If you want them to listen
If you want them to respond
If you want them to go away
Just let them know
It could be wonderful
