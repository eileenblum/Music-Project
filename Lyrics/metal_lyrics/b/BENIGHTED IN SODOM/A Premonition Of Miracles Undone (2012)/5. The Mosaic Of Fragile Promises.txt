In our search for everlasting life
We inherited the disease of centuries
The cancer of perpetual longing
A constant inferno of dissolution,
quenched by the waters of purpose
We have a place in the universe
In the pantheon of suffering
Where the sins of our heritage
Are purged and scattered
A mosaic of ugliness to linger in time
What will satisfy our endless questioning?
from the comforting maw of oblivion,
A divine resounding answer of eternal affirmation,
The fragilest of promises
