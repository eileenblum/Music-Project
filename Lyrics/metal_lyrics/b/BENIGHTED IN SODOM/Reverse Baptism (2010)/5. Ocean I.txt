When the dream began, I was in the water
And I believe I was drowning
All I could do was swim
Towards the unforeseen beaches
So deep below me, so far before me
The tides pull me away
But still I swam
Against the currents
Towards the shore I could not see
And behold, a tempest
Harbinger of a tidal fear
And it rained
But still I swam against the currents
Towards the sands of providence
I grew weary and mortal
And I drank the salts of fate
I welcomed this final wave
The end was beautiful
100 CCs of utmost deliverance
Comatose, I began to dream of myself
I believe I was drowning
