From the shoreI can see the sailsBut they never return to the bayAnd quietly, I wishWhy can't it be me? This island is emptyThe sand is deadNothing can growNothing can surviveWhy have I come hereTo this lost zone of sedimentseroded from time? From the shoreI can see their bodiesSuccumbed to hopeAdrift within plain sightBelow the unsetting dead sunAnd quietly, I wishWhy can't it be me?
