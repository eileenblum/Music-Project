When there is nothing left for us in life, will we fall into what we fear? If for only an instant, just to feel. I can't forgive myself until I know I've suffered and thrown away all that I have, if for only an instant, just to feel. Couldn't it be sweet? In the moments I've lost, someone else could live them as their own, and my soul will be free to sin beautifully as a mortal, and lay down in the stars, as a god.
