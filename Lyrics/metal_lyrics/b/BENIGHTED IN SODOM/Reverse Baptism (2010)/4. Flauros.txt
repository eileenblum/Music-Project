Does a kind god prefer to voyeur? Beneath such pearly splendor the wretched fallen Babylon writhes in agonizing delight, so do you bear witness to his firmament neath the sewers and forgotten graves of mortal utopia? Willing participants, gather and revel!Your chariots are made of sulfur and napalm at the behest of a decadent decree, abysmal terror and dissolution shall be his invitation Holocausts and pathetic fates combined to mime the theater of divinityLovers will cling and bitterness will dredge the confusion of rivals, yet of these things may none glimpse outward past the curtains hung by the sane I saw the greatest act of compassion, and I saw how it perished beneath the hail and acid from the sky, memoirs of hope from our tender savior
