I am the child in your memory. You block me out, but I am still there.Haunting your dreams, you block me out, but I am still there. When you are reminded of your sins, just try forgetWhen you are reminded of the pain, just try to forgetWhen you are reminded of your sins, just try to forgetWhen you are reminded of the pain, just try to forget us I am the holiday you miss, you can make believe, but I am still there, stealing your peace. You can block it out, but you still want me... When you are reminded of your sins, just try forgetWhen you are reminded of the pain, just try to forgetWhen you are reminded of your sins, just try to forgetWhen you are reminded of the pain, just try to forget us I'll find you, eventually... eventually...
