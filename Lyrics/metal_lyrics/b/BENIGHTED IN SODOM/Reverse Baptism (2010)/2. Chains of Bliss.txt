We are born merely to find the tunnel, for all paths lead to this end. There will a place for you rest along the way, defeated and broken, without answers. So let your faith lead you to failureSo let your sorrow comfort the truth, that you are lost, and your secrets will float to the surface.There is a subtle horror in realization, but the faith is unmistakable in the eve of peril, and it's beaming headlights will find you there. Let the dream captivate you, let the necessity consume you. Cling to the light, and welcome enslavement, for in oblivion, liars are saved, only to find the prosperous wealth of aeons, buried beneath the cenotaph and forbidden like a tree, beautiful and burning... We are born merely to find the tunnel as all paths lead to the end. There will be a place for you to rest along the way, for you to defeat and break yourself.
