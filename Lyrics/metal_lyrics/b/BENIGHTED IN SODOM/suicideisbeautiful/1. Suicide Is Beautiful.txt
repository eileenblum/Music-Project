When I die, I want it to be like a dream
I want to see myself ascend a marble staircase
Through the swirling clouds of bliss and hope
A step for each of my worries lost
To the sweet surrender of the ever after
As I draw down the blade and cut my flesh 
I'm reminded of amber fields
Blues and whites in the sky
The porcelain stains red and I exhale
Something better awaits me there....

And then I feel it come over me
Like I would never be sad again
The warm water caresses my open cuts
Serenity now, pouring from every major vein and artery
A silence and a distance like I've never known before
They coalesce and in this moment everything is right
It's so beautiful...
