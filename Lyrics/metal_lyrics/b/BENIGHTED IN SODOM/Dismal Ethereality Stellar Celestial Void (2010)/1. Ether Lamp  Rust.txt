Close your eyes, and pretend that it was all just a dream
For to realize this life would only isolate your existence
Between oceans and falling stars
Unmade and stillborn creatures
Stranded forever inside of my glass world
Behold oceans of nothingness

Consciousness shall forever be your grave
I begged to become aware
And it only destroyed my heart
Love perishes where light betrays the falling
Nothing more than questions now
