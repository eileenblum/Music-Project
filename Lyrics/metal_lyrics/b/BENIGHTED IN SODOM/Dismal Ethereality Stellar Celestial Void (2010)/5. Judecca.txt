Could it really be that I still drift lifeless between the spaces?
This landscape is desolate, but so strangely beautiful
Silence and dead leaves shadow this universe
I can never leave you
I am a prisoner to this consciousness
I walk towards the tide to drown myself
only to revive where this miserable journey began
destined to relive each empty moment
as a mirrored frozen version of me
Lost in repeating moments where not even death can intervene
Just as I watched us die
You will watch as I wander our empty world
In search of something that will not be
