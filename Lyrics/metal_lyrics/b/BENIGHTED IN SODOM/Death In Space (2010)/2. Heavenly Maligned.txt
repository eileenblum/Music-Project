O Merciful emptiness, rain down on me
Ignoring every wound you make, Sweetly forsaking me
In this Eucharist, I pledge autonomy to nurture the apathy in you
In this tabernacle rots the only evidence that you ever existed

I have been to a paradise that burned beautifully from the depths of an endless chasm, spilling smoke and ash into the eyes of God to blind and deprive him of it's glory

Rebellion

All you secrets will die with me
For salvation is wasted on the obedient
Hell is overpopulated with happy people
Now I go down with the setting sun
