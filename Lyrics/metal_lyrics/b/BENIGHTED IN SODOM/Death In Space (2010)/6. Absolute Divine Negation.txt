For unto me, no vision was granted, no catharsis illuminated within the corridors of my most distant dreams.
Rather, there was a vanity so profound, that despite all my struggle for utmost illumination, the dreaded light incinerated my ego and all divinity was eroded from the paths of the righteous.
Marvel at the grandeur of this majestic nothingness, the shallow grave of glorified human subjugation exemplified in absolute void.
Elevate yourself in death and escape the forthcoming floods of silence and mortality, for harsh waves erode even the strongest foundations of faith.

All contradictions perish in the mitigation of differing shades of divinity, yet the role of existence continues to flourish unchallenged and arrogant.
Penitence and desperation die equally, drowning beneath the currents of time and consciousness.
