In my veins, I die adrift inebriate of steel and impulse
Cells and sublime confidence or rain and darkened stormdrains
Pieces of shadows and sunny days
I watch myself flickering

Wreck yourself on the stars and surrender
Struggling to gather the colors and sounds from the back of my mind
Twilight is ending a haze of dissonant silence
Along the pavement drags the corpse of a guardian angel
the same streets where we walked

Summerlands and eternal night
For only the forsaken will return and only the empty will wait
