Two worlds colliding and self-destructing
The sides of a mirror confessing their secret convictions
Veins and pills, blue skies, fountains of poison and seduction
Twins of a parasite, gradually devouring one another
A pair of wings that burn
For once I was not
For once I was between
Complacent but dejected
I mother the wounded creature
I mothered the universe that I might be forgiven
Beneath this earth
Beneath this stone
I plunge my fist into the rock
And then, overwhelming silence
And then, overwhelming nothingness

[unspoken]
"Finite and continual, ascension and simultaneous destruction
Faithless light, it also suffers inside of me
Constantly seeing through the horizon to the nothingness here and thereafter
And gazing toward the eternal constellations of sublime distance and asphixia
The afflicted becomes the valet of suicide
I have bled the stars and their swansong was my ordainment over angels and surpassing gates of mortal lamentations, the precedent for a cosmic shift beyond all that I have seen and felt inside my flesh
My last covenant is forever broken
Release me..."
