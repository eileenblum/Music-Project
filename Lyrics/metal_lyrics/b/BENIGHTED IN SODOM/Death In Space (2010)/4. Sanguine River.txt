Hell is beautiful
Like white flowers and crashing waves
Neither sulphur seas or blazing forests
Just glassy still waters beside me always
The air is empty and cold
A full moon yawns from beyond some distant stars
Trembling with the night
I walked with you here
Far from pearly prisons of somber delusions
Far from meadows of razorblades
They still hurt me
But they'll never hurt you
I shut your eyes as we fled
That I alone would witness the destruction of the Heaven we built
Yet one of us must look back
Lest we lead each other towards oblivion
I fell those last constellations as a pillar of salt
I did it for you
