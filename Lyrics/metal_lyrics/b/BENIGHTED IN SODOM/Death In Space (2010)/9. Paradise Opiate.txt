Guiltless and frozen, I plummet towards the glassy earth below me, my wings rapidly deteriorating in the atmosphere as I approach the last of the Arcadian gardens, concealed from all but the divine... man has squandered his beauty and lowered himself to a desperate echo in the dense vacuum of divine apathy.
It makes no difference, for my judgment is unbiased and remorseless, and the pious walk equally convicted with the irreverent and the insane. I gazed ever so deeply into their hollow eyes, teasing the flickering semblance of humanity with false promises of sunshine in eternity... they know as well as I what awaits them there, they know as well as I that these gates can no longer be trespassed; defilement must be cleansed by the tears of the guilty, but only the blood of the righteous can safe this covenant anew.
I am the fulfillment of antiquity, I am the healing grace of a thousand years' trespasses, and they outstretch their starving necks and wrists towards the firmament of my promised serenity.
It was always meant to be this way, for the stars have aligned favorably above you and I, and now we are granted the salvation of which we always dreamed.

I will alleviate you.
I will alleviate us.
