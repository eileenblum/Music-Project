I am finally here in paradise
Where everything is beautiful and bright
I have left the sickness of the world behind
And I have found serenity in this secret heaven

For to promise me this tomorrow
I would kill you today

Every moment in life has led me to this
All that I am means nothing now that I am free
For my cage is made of alabaster and gold
And my reward is lifeless silence
In exchange for a lifetime of affliction
At rest in the heights of the world
And the world is below

At rest in the heights that overlook the world, 
and the world is below

I say a quiet prayer of gratitude
And like the truly saved, my vacant words fall into the sky
And their echo reminds me that I am truly alone
