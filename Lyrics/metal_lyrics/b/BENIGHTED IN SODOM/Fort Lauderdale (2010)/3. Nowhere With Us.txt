Take my heart
Hold it in your hands
This could be the start of something beautiful
Lie to me
I'll believe everything
Just to believe this is real

Gaze inside
See that I lack a soul
But there is room here for you
Staring back, my abyss becomes your resting place
But at least we are together

Fall into my desperate pain
And I will build you an altar
Built upon the ashes of everything that matters

Lie to me
I'll believe everything
Just to believe this is real

Fall into my desperate pain
And I will build you an altar
Built upon the ashes of everything that matters

Be with me
Be with me
Be with me
Be with me, here, forever
