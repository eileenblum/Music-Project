All that we are, you and I, we have no future, no destiny. I see you and I know I love you, yet you are infinitely dead to me all the same. This garden we've made here is so lush and lovely, but I know when our season will change, winter comes, and our embrace will freeze these blossoms. All that we are, you and I, we have no future, no destiny. I see you and I know I love you, yet you are infinitely dead to me all the same. Hold my hand, and smile. Please don't feel alone, because though we are estranged, I still grip yours all the same. Hold my hand, and smile.
Please take everything I have ever given to you and burn it in front of my face, please take back everything you ever promised me and tell me it was all a lie, please unforgive me for all of my weakness, because I want to be guilty, close the door and lock me outside, let me go and smile, but please don't feel alone, because though I am dead to you, I still hold onto you just the same.
