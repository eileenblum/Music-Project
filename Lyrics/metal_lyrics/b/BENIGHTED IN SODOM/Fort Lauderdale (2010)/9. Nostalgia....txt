A house on this street withers
A child's room is filled with dreamless sleep
There is a mirror there
It leads to the other side
Lead me there, I will follow you
Just don't let them see that I've gone
Just don't let them find me
A child's room is empty, but not forgotten
Just don't let them see that I've gone
Just don't let them find me
Please don't let them find me

It hurts, it hurts no more...
It hurts, it hurts no more...
