If you can give me your flesh, I will let you possess the world
Where they will take you, no cruelty knows your name
The lens will be your window to the world
But the screen is the cradle of hope

Everything you could not have in a former life belongs to you a thousandfold, command misery from the seat of divinity encased forever in plastic, the covenant with your creator

If you can give me your flesh, I will let you fuck the world
Just remember what you were and what you could have been

Bubblegum smile, looking upward toward the light of atonement
On your knees, on your knees...

Let them fall into you
One by one
Let them fall into you
One by one

As lovely as a rainbow, as passive as a black hole
Beneath your tears I can smell your fear, and I know...

I tap the vein and bring you in
Everything will be different now
You belong to a better world, a better world
