All I ever needed were these red walls
All I ever needed was a hand on the other side that wouldn't reject my own
Stay with me tonight

Just until I fall asleep
You can whisper razors to me
In fields of flowers beyond these jagged cliffs
Take me there and push me off
Blood among the lilies, blood along the seashore
The sickening silences of lovers and angels
Concentration
At last, the gates to sweet perdition spread their conviction wide to welcome me
From the deserted peaks, I plummeted into your arms
Keeping us buried in my heart, buried in my grave
Such sweet memories
Carbonized

Slash my throat
Just until I fall asleep

Tell it to me again
