For upon this steel I built a crystal palace
Thus above is the glorification, so shall the flesh reside beneath

Each one, a sacrament of this faith
This unbridled love for the comfort that only chastisement can provide

You, too, are in these veins
Come, and I will make for you a place to exit as well

Promises of tomorrow are fleeting when you're dead
Maybe better to just covet serenity from the emptiness at the heart of my dreams

Sinners never receive closure in Heaven
But I know I can drink the poison from the stars in Hell

No time for apologies
Just something to remember me by

Before I ruin life
Without speaking

Maybe better to just covet serenity from the emptiness at the heart of my dreams
Come, and I promise I will find an exit for you as well
