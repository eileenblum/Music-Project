Here we are again, beside ourselves
That place where not even the universe lends a mindful ear to this darkness
I have seen the monolith, and it crushed the hand that beholds the eye
Here we are again, beside ourselves

Take me to the ocean
One last time
That I might elate my soul
That I might find one of these things I'd lost before
That I might lead us through the silence
That I might
That you might
But I know you won't
I know you will never see what I see
Take me to the ocean
And go away from me
