Can you feel me?
I am shadows behind you
That were never there
Footsteps crackling pale bleached bones
On a vast, white beach

Uncomfortable serenity...
I am thy enemy...

That razor is for you
To justify your sins
Come and find me
In these strange, sick fields where I lay
That were never there

Silence

Uncomfortable serenity...
Unfathomable misery...
