Let us look
Into each other
And see as God sees
The waters of life ran polluted
with the excrement of mankind

I remember this place
I have passed through here once before
The footprints in the sand...
They are my own...
The ones that parallel next to me
They are but mine as well...

I approached a grave
filled with photographs
and complex symbols
so familiar to me...
And at last I am awake
And I am in Hell
My soul is in Hell
To these things
I (They) will burn

The horizon extends to eternity
But strangely I am at peace
The burdens on my soul
Intensify and Crush
Crush
Crush me...

I remember this place
I have passed through here once before
The footprints in the sand
They are my own
The ones that parallel beside me
They are mine as well

So familiar

Let us take a look into each other
And see as 'God' sees
The waters of life run polluted
With excrement of mankind
Crush me...
(Oh I remember this place....)
Crush me....
(Once before... and I will be here again....)
Crushing me...
(The footprints in the sand...)
They are my own

They are unforgiven
They are mine
