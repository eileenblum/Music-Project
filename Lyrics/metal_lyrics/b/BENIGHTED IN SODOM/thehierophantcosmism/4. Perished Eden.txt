Collapse
My fragile existence
I have passed through the threshold

I shed the feathers
In exchange for eyes as black as the rain
To what do we fall, when the surface is shattered
by these throwing stones from on high?
I condemn the truth
I take refuge in delusion
For there are none other
(Except they... covered in blood...)

Collapse

Collapse my fragile existence
Under the weight of questions
Questions to God
Questions to Man

In the garden of Eden
I pondered

Collapse my fragile existence
Under the weight of questions

Question me

Collapse my fragile existence
I have passed through the threshold (one last time)
I shed the feathers
in exchange for eyes
as black as the rain

To what do we fall when the surface is shattered
by these throwing stones?
