Everything to fabricate destiny
Everything to construct memories
Everything to taint the immaculate
Everything to lure the desperate
Everything to silence the rebellious
Everything to breed prejudice
Everything to harvest misery
Everything to bury liberty

Comfort me that I may not see manifest true darkness
Devour the stars

Everything to bless the guilty
Everything to incite mutiny
Everything to manipulate fate
Everything to glorify rape
Everything to question God
Everything to spare the rod
Everything to conquer nations
Everything to lead them to temptation

Comfort me that I may not see manifest true darkness
Devour the stars

Ugliness is (next to) righteousness
