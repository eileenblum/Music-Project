Material darkness lingers in the palace of rust
Ravenous spectre gnaw away at the machine corpses of angels
Alone below the earth, I tremble like a frozen butterfly
Alone below the earth, in the wastelands of tomorrow, awake...

Take me back into the world florescent sunshine

Feral darkness...
