What is the worth of the pain of a stranger?
Who will feel sorry for you when you are left alone?
Can you cry for a slut that sells her life away?
Can you love a worthless whore from the backseat of a car?
Take it off, everything
I'll bury my secrets in you
Take it off
Look into me, only left to hurt you now
Take a bow
See your fans
They applaud for you tonight
Take a bow
Wave goodbye
They applaud for you tonight
What is the worth of the pain of a stranger?
Who will feel sorry for you when you are left
