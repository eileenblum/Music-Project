Is this the mirrored eternity I wished for?
Descension from death in a hollow darkness without even the comfort of the most dimly lit twilight sky
He blessed me with wings, he blessed me with feathers

And now their burning alone is the light that illuminates my forsaken path
Although the flesh has become one with some blasted and distant earth
This misery will abide forever

The eclipse towards my ultimate atonement
Now I will belong to the same constellations
Fiery divine creatures in the blackness of space
All transgression has been justified with this eucharist
Nothingness and pain will manifest me again and again in that forsaken place

Fallen far below the grace of gods and devils, yet still incarnated in the endless iniquity of this sacrifice
I will take it into me
And chastise myself
To die forever as a superior thought form
