Sweeter than love and ecstasyThe penance I pay for empty fleshGasping and clawing at the moonCarving abysses in meCarving singular moments in forever Suspended and frozen screams of agony to monument the reconciliation of desperation and consciousnessMy compass spins around and aroundMocking my desperation for consciousnessOn this beach of fleshSteel strikes the sands I dream of a shore where red tides meet the firmament of the universe
