I descended a God and was spat back into the realm of the misbegotten as a spear bleeding the heavens Ye Lost, follow me and I will lead you into oblivionYe Sick, kiss me and I will give you paralysisYe dying, speak my name and it will deafen youYe faithless, outstretch your hands to meand I will slash your wrists Live through me, and I will unveil every truthTo worship and perish as criminals and carpenters alike
