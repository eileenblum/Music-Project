Spread me across the cosmic seaI am only ashes nowNot even a name to mark the grave left for dust and silence I thought they were angelselevating me through the horrible night Release me the burden of my human essenceI am drawn to a dismal paradise where sonnance and space are one I thought it was an angel in the sunPlaying upon a harp of suffering and plagues Arrogant laughter from space, commanding me to step far beyond the ledge
