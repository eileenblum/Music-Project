Behold this mighty chain
In rapture of all it's connection to the past
In ecstasy here, bleeding...

The fields are bleeding
Can you feel the stars?
When they awake...

These dreams I have had
These lies I have spait
These are fruits I will yield
This is the spirit of life, dying...

These rotten fruit
