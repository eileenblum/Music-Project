[Sargeist Cover]

Hear the chant of my tormented soul
In black devotion I have prayed
Veins re-opened, bleeding for Satan
With pride my flesh is cut

Sanctissime colere chaos
Obscurities unveil to me - a Disciple
Sanctssime colere chaos
Mortuus pontifex

In worship I rape humanity
Idolizing the torment with scars
I burn his sign into my heart
Preces infandus - possess me

I am the sick and devoted fanatic
My appearance is foul
In your fear you will avoid hurting me
Even in my name I carry rotting omens

Sanctissime colere chaos
Obscurities unveil to me - a Disciple
Sanctssime colere chaos
Mortuus pontifex

Thorn - All instruments and vocals
