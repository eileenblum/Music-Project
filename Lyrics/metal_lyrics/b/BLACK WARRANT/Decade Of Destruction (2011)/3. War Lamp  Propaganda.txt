Killer trained, for ruin and pain
I bring an end to what in life remains
Riding through a bloody ground
To slay what moves at sight or sound

Falling down to realize
My life in flashes visualized
One moment on the battle field
I now see through the lies
Breeding through the anarchy
Walk avenues of misery
Darkness selling solace
As I fall to my demise

Waiting here in dark despair
To face what comes to claim
The soul I have, this shell of filth
That caused a world of pain

Rising up to recognize
With all my senses paralyzed
No longer on the battleground
I echo sins in cries
Rights to war by men of peace
And claims that lead us to deceit
Forsaken in eternity
Now burn my paradise
