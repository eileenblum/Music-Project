I do what they ask me to
Hit, kill, arrest I do
No one is safe from me
Imprisoned freedom, a reality

caged freedom, corroded peace
no where to run, corruption disease

Bomb those who want freedom
Kill those who say "no"
Love the silence and solace
After everyone is dead

Locked freedom, corroded peace
no where to run, corruption disease

Peace will never prevail
Diplomacy that always fail
Evil power 's domination
Avarice for Oil, but no satisfaction

caged freedom, corroded peace
no where to run, corruption disease
