I was hanging from a fighter plane
Thinking about who I am
Made by man to kill &amp; destroy
I fall free, and hit the aim

I dont care who do I kill
For a purpose or just for thrill
I burn bodied and shatter places
I bring misery, death is my name

Now I am falling down to earth
To a house full of children
I dont want to land there
I want to hide and run

But I am helpless, and I shall fall
Blowing everything and killing all
I wonder who plays the big game
Is it man that has turned insane?

I wish I was made a dory
But its just one bomb's story
