Burning my soul
For nothing at all
Obsessed with lies
Screaming silent howl

Thinking about your fall
Dreaming you to crawl
Ruining my life
For nothing at all

Ignoring life
Rejecting fate
I am paralyzed
Filled up with hate
Damned by HATE ... HATEE

I want you to die
And to see you cry
Cant seem to cure myself
Feeling seems to amplify

Ignoring life
Rejecting fate
I am paralyzed
Filled up with hate
Damned by HATE ... HATEE
