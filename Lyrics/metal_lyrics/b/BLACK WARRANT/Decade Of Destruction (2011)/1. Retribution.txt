I had a mansion and brand new car
Lived life of a rock star
Money filled bags under my bed
Party every night, girls in red
Everything felt good just the right way
Realized what life is when it flew away

Why am I so alone now?
Was it a dream I just saw
Was it just my imagination?
Maybe its time for retribution

Alone I scream to kill my pain
Wish I could turn back time again
Do what I should have done
I ignored those who loved me
Stranded them when they needed me
Money sucking greed misled me

Why Iâm so alone, I know
It wasnât a dream I saw
My selfishness in every relation
Now its time for retribution
