[Verse 1]
Discretion is forever,
When mystery fuels the soul
As we cling to hopes
And dreams we hold

Using to live what
I learned as a child
A pre arranged reaction
As Iâve been told

[Verse 2]
Paving my way
As part of the whole
Not venturing alone
Discovering purpose

And blindly being led
To an unfamiliar fold
Wasteful indulgence
To fulfill my soul

[Verse 3]
Discretion is forsaken
When life boils down to behold
The dregs of what was once mistaken
For meanings and goals

[Chorus:]
The essence of life,
Violently denied

A screaming war
A battle cry

Within its fire
Innocence despaired
Into my darkened grave
I stare

(Rebel, resist, and
Fight to survive)
