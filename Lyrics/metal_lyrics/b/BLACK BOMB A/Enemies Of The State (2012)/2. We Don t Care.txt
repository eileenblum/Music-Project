We don't care!

We never listen cause you keep dissing
You try to keep us down but we are on a mission
We won't listen cause you be tripping
You try and catch us out like motherfuckers fishing

You're always telling me what to do
But why in this world should I listen to you?
Everything you say means nothing to me
So shut the fuck up we just wanna play
Travelling around from city to city
We're coming atcha with no morse or pity
So listen up you better do what we say
Now back the fuck up and stay out our fucking way

We don't care!

You keep dissin, you be trippin
You keep dissin, you're motherfucking trippin [4x]

We don't care what you say what you say now
we don't care what you say what you say [4x]

I can't hear you there's no point in talking
Get on your bike or keep on walking
I want you away as far as you can get
All you seem to do is disrespect
So take all your bullshit and you can go shove it
You never know you might even love it
You can't fool us cause your lies they suck
So go to hell cause your straight out of you fucking luck

We don't care!

The gang's ready for the war and to die
We search for peace in the lies hey!
Again the fear became so strong
Nothing will change for a song [2x]

We don't care what you say [4x]

We never listen cause you keep dissing
You try to keep us down but we are on a mission
We won't listen cause you be tripping
You try and catch us out like motherfuckers fishing [2x]

Hey! [16x]
