Can't stop this feeling upon me
So real my heart is crushing
I want it and baby you got it
Let's get together in a fixed position
Take my hand into the promised land
This is my proposition in my condition yeah!

Oh come on!

This is an invite to come on down
It's time to go crazy from the BBA sounds
Feel the raw strength and stand your ground
So come on everybody let's go and come on down!

Come on down! [3x]
Your gonna dig this shit so come on down!

Come on let's go for a ride now
Head down town and take it easy
City lights shining and the moon is blinding
All rock your world until the sun is rising
That's the plan baby and I'm your man
Don't want no isolation just concentration yeah!

Oh come on!

This is an invite to come on down
It's time to go crazy from the BBA sounds
Feel the raw strength and stand your ground
So come on everybody let's go and come on down!

Come on down! [3x]
Your gonna dig this shit so come on down!
Come on down! [3x]
Your gonna dig this shit so come on down!

Come on!

So come on baby all take you for a ride
But don't be ashamed it's a matter of pride
There's no excuses i don't care what you say
It's time to buckle up we're going all the way [2x]

Come on down! [3x]
Your gonna dig this shit!
