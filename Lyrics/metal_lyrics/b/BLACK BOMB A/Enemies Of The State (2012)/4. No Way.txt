Nobody touch me I'm an animal, it's the system who made me
The power rejects all but I fight to remain free

Bringing me down with all sorts of shit
Non stop new laws and their not gonna quit
Yet on the horizon there's plenty surprising
2012 (two thousand and twelve) it's a new uprising

There's no way! No way!
Your play! Your play!
Can stay! Can stay!

Open your eyes see through the lies
It's your demise, stop playing with my mind
Won't let you in, you're full of sin
It shall begin, the truth you'll find [2x]

I'm not a hero, I kill the heroes
My war is a new scream for the men of wisdom
I give my tears which mix with your blood
Break the chains for the children of freedom

Fuck the NWO and the masterscam plan
Cause like anthrax yeah I'm the man
You know we won't take it, you know am gonna break it
This shit's for real and we're not gonna fake it

All that I want is for you to fuck off
And I won't stop until this is done
Reach for the skies because this is the end
And I won't stop this war 'til it's won yeah!

So much pressure, never surrender, no way! [4x]
So much pressure, never surrender! [2x]
No way!

Open your eyes see through the lies
It's your demise, stop playing with my mind
Won't let you in, you're full of sin
It shall begin, the truth you'll find [2x]
