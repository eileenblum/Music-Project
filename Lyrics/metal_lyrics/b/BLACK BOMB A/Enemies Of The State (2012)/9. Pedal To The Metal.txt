Full throttle and I'm tearing up the highway
You can't catch me! You can't catch me!
I've got bottle and I'm going my way
You won't see me! You won't see me!
There's no such thing as miles per hour
So just beat it! So just beat it!
A V8 engine I've got the power
I can feel it! I can feel it!

Come on everybody put your pedal to the metal
There's no stopping us cause we won't settle
This ain't a joke or a fucking play
So get out the road way
Come on everybody put your pedal to the metal
The engines hot and boiling like a kettle
There ain't nothing that can cool me down
I'm the king of the road and I'm wearing the crown

Wheels spinning and I'm burning rubber
I can smell it! I can smell it!
My babies a beast and there ain't no other
You can have it! You can have it!
Shining with chrome, looking so presting
It gets to me! It gets to me!
With a mind of its own just like Christine
She listens to me! She listens to me!

Come on everybody put your pedal to the metal
There's no stopping us cause we won't settle
This ain't a joke or a fucking play
So get out the road way
Come on everybody put your pedal to the metal
The engines hot and boiling like a kettle
There ain't nothing that can cool me down
I'm the king of the road and I'm wearing the crown

Motherfuck the speed limit! I'm in it to win it!
Are you our of your mind? We'll leave them all behind! [2x]

So come on everybody put your pedal to the metal
There's no stopping us cause we won't settle
This ain't a joke or a fucking play
So get out the road way
Come on everybody put your pedal to the metal
The engines hot and boiling like a kettle
There ain't nothing that can cool me down
I'm the king of the road and I'm wearing the crown
