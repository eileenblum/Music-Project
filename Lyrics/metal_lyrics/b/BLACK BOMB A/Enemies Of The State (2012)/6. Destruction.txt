Acid rain burns my eyes, in my mouth it take out flies
My skin is cold and dead, all the pain is in my head
Everyday the mothers tears, everybody feels the fears
The solution is in the end, all the pain is in my head

All the pain is in our heads! [2x]

No breath, we're deaf, no brains, we are death

Losing all joy of life,
Falling down we pay the price
Pay the price!

Just wait 'til the end in the world of destruction
We put the gun in our mouths
All the gods are dead, forget the resurrection
Amen!
It's too late for the regrets, the fighters without rest
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Just wait 'til the end in the world of destruction

All the words rape my lips
My body mixes in the mist
Music is my only help
Decieve the death step by step [2x]

No breath, we're deaf, no brains, we are death

Where is my way? I follow the line
My heart beat accelerates, is it a strife?
Who'll be alive?

Just wait 'til the end in the world of destruction
We put the gun in our mouths
All the gods are dead, forget the resurrection
Amen!
It's too late for the regrets, the fighters without rest
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Just wait 'til the end in the world of destruction

Destruction! [15x]

Just wait 'til the end in the world of destruction
We put the gun in our mouths
All the gods are dead, forget the resurrection
Amen!
It's too late for the regrets, the fighters without rest
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Just wait 'til the end in the world of destruction

Destruction...
