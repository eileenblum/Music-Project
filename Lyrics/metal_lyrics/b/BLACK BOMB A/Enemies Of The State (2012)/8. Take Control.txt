It's time to stand up and it's time to man up
Don't get stuck 'cause we couldn't give a fuck
About you and your crew and everything that you do
Just keep it real kids and don't slip it up
Gather together we've got to unite
We're gonna rock this party through 'til day and the night
So grab on some beers and ditch all your fears
Let's get it started with a mixture of blood,
Sweat and tears

Take control!

Feeling it right yeah and we've nothing to lose
You've got the grooving to keep your body moving
Yeah right!
Let's go my friends but take care of yourself
With all the pushing and the shoving and proven
Come on!
Rise up everyone yes we need to break free
So pack your bags and follow me
Right now!
Let's set it right because tonight's the night
And we'll rock so hard 'til you can't see

Come on get through this and don't take the piss
You can abuse it but do not dismiss
'Cause you'll go insane if you think it's a game
Don't over do it 'cause it's yourself to blame
It's time to wake up and do your thing
We've got to reach out but don't be a ding
So pull it together and clear out your head
Otherwise you're fucked and you might end up dead

Take control!

Feeling it right yeah and we've nothing to lose
You've got the grooving to keep your body moving
Yeah right!
Let's go my friends but take care of yourself
With all the pushing and the shoving and proven
Come on!
Rise up everyone yes we need to break free
So pack your bags and follow me
Right now!
Let's set it right because tonight's the night
And we'll rock so hard 'til you can't see

Freedom of your soul, never lose control
Got to re arrange, now it's time for change

Take control, take it back, take it back now
Take control, take it back, take it back [2x]

Take control! [2x]

Freedom of your soul, never lose control
Got to re arrange, now it's time for change [2x]

Take control, take it back, take it back now
Take control, take it back, take it back [4x]
