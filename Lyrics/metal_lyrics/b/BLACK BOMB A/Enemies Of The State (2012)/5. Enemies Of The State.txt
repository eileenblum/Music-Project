Who will want to kill my president?
No mercy for dictator's bastard which sucks the life of people!
Don't be afraid of the last judgment!
One life, one thousand lies, disgusted by the laws!

Hey! [3x]

Hide the beauty and forget the temptation
Punish a scream which resounds for a reason
Love the money and loosing the substance of life
Steal words to be strong without strife

The consciousnesses are in sleep
The love is an indifferent child
Drugs take us for a trip
Blue, red, the sky is wild [2x]

Spit on all religions, world without evolution
Slave of the destiny, dead for eternity
Bodies look for the pain, blood fall like the rain
These fights are without end, why to share the lands
Spit on all religions, world without evolution
Slave of the destiny, dead for eternity

Urge to escape me, urge to escape me
Forget to discover me, discover me
Far from the world, far from the light, believe in me
Dust by the dust and reborn the night

The consciousnesses are in sleep
The love is an indifferent child
Drugs take us for a trip
Blue, red, the sky is wild

To break the walls and build the fucking prisons
A virtual life by pressing on the buttons
Consumations, poison flows into our veins
Follow the voice which destroy your fucking brains

Who will want to kill my president?
No mercy for dictator's bastard which sucks the life of people!
Don't be afraid of the last judgment!
One life, one thousand lies, disgusted by the laws!

The consciousnesses are in sleep
The love is an indifferent child
Drugs take us for a trip
Blue, red, the sky is wild [2x]

Urge to escape me, urge to escape me
Forget to discover me, discover me
Far from the world, far from the light, believe in me
Dust by the dust and reborn the night

Spit on all religions, world without evolution
Slave of the destiny, dead for eternity
Bodies look for the pain, blood fall like the rain
These fights are without end, why to share the lands
Spit on all religions, world without evolution
Slave of the destiny, dead for eternity

My mind is a bomb, I'm afraid my words explode [3x]
My mind is a bomb, explode!
