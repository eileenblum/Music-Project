I can't stand your fear!

So sick of fear coming out televisions
Nothing but war fighting for their religions
You try to scare us but all you do is fail
Motherfucker the propaganda it's time to prevail

Freedom of speech exists so be heard
We need to join together and we'll spread the word
That there's evil forces that fill you with terror
My mind is free so your programs an error

No fear of you! No fear!

Something I want to realize
No fear of you
Can't stand your mind games and your lies
No fear it's true

I can't stand your fear!

Messages of hatred and its subliminal
In my head you're the fucking criminal
It doesn't matter what you say or do
There's no way in this world that all listen to you

Hey! We don't need this bullshit but don't sweat just yet
I ain't fucking listening
Hey! We don't mean to disrespect but you're full of shit
You'll get a good face fisting [2x]

No fear of you! No fear!

Something I want to realize
No fear of you
Losing control and become blind
Our hearts bleed and cry for a thousand times
Cose silence I wait for the day
The world is in riot it's the way
Can't stand your mind games and your lies
No fear it's true

I can't stand your fear!

The world is in riot it's the way
Something I want to realize
No fear of you [4x]
