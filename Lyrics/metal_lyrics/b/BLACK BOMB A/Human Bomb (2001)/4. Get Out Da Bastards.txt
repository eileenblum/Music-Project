[Couplet 1:]
You know da world has many problems,
but you you don't care
You think you're simply da best, but at last you won't share
You smile, yes you smile, and you criticise the others
I know your simply da best, but da best to kill the earth

[Couplet 2:]
Crushing, you're crushing, you're crushing the others and you don't
Care for their rights, for their business, or for their life
Spoiling, you're spoiling, you're spoiling all da place and you don't
Care, you don't respect, your mother, da mother earth

You're ignorant, power's in da unity
I want to get you out, to kill da pain inside of me
You're ignorant, power's in da unity
I want to get you out, to kill da pain inside of me

Get out da bastards [x4]

Human people have to overcome their egocentrism

I wish I will kill da pain
I'll kill da pain
I wish, I wish, I will kill da pain
In me [x2]

[Couplet 1]
[Couplet 2]

I understand, I see, but I cannot forgive [x2]

Get out da bastards [x4]

Human people have to overcome their egocentrism

Get out da bastards
Get out da bastards [x2]
Get get get get... out !
