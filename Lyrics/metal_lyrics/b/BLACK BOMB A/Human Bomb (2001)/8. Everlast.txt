[Refrain:]
Come to this wonderful, wonderful place, where da money is god,
Where kids play with guns,
you, you can use all of da crimes,
in this fucking place, to win use lies
So come to this beautiful, beautiful race,
in a word of a pollution, sorrows and despair,
you, you can use all of da crimes,
in this fucking race to win use lies
Come to this wonderful, wonderful place
Welcome in da fucking race
Do what you want there is no law
' cause money is da law
Use your violence day after day
Use your hate and use your money
Do what you want there is no law
Da race has no more law !

I don't give a fuck to your lies

Wake up mother fuckers, I don't need no power, I don't need a race for my life
I ain't thinking about power, and look into my eyes, I don't need a race for my life
So wake up mother fuckers, I don't need no power, and I don't need a race for my life
I ain't thinking about power, I don't need your power !

You are...
You are... blind
