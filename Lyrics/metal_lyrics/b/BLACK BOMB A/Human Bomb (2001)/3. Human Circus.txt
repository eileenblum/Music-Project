Welcome, welcome to the human circus
Let me show you the reality of these
last few wild and dangerous men

No rest in pain in my mother fucking tomb [x8]

One obsession, one, one, obsession
I've never been free
Never been me
And I want to
Break all the bars of my jail !

But I see you
And I hear You
I just want to
Break all the bars of my jail !

I'll leave, I'll leave, I'm thinking about this
I'll leave, I'll leave, I'm thinking about this

Just realize, that human life, is a cold
strife, our spirit is blind
Chains in our mind, love trapped inside,
chains in our mind
best human crime !

[Refrain:]
I have my freedom in my head

We just fight your rules, we're not criminals
We just fight your rules and you !

Break all the bars of my jail !

[Refrain]

Tell me who's da monkey, can you tell me who's da man
I thought humans were like good
beasts, now I'm thinking I was made !
Can you tell me who's da monkey,
can you tell me who's da man
I thought humans were like good
beasts, now I'm thinking I was mad !

So don't treat me like this, I'll make
you pay for your sins, sins, 666 sins,
I'm going crazier
Let me show you anger that you'll
never forget, my finger's on da trigger
you'll better show some respect, cause
I'm a Bomb ! Human Bomb !

I am a dreamer...
