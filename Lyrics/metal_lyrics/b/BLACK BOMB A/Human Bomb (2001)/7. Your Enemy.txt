I have seen da cost of your lies
I have seen your wars and their crimes
I have seen your sweat genocides
Don't you feel da shame of your kind

I cannot understand all da pain we have done
Do you think that's why we've been done (x 2)

Rise above
Rise above da weight of your ignorance
Don't stay with the fools
Don't stay blind
So work hard on yourself
You'd better listen, you'd better listen
Don't you understand
That you are your enemy

I have seen sorrows in your streets
Da blood on my hands and I'm sick
I'm still seeking da truth in this life
To make a better world for my child

I cannot understand all da pain we have done
Do you think that's why we've been done (x 2)

Rise above
Rise above da weight of your ignorance
Don't stay with the fools
Don't stay blind
So work hard on yourself
You'd better listen, you'd better listen
Don't you understand
That you are your enemy

Wake up, play your life before your life plays you
I say make up and try to be watchful everyday
Stand up, you know we have so many things to do
So do your best, cause your time is flying day by day
Fuck you ! Play your life before your life plays you
You'd better wake up, and do your best anyway
Stand up, you know we have so many things to do
I say wake up, cause your time is flying day by day

We need food for da mind, for da love, for da core
We have no power, but we can use our fucking brains
We need time to try to rise to grow
We have no power, but we can use our fucking brains !

Men if you know that mind is power,
You know that and use it just for your personnal goal
Egocentric suckers...
I'm your enemy !

I don't play your game
Don't you feel da shame
I don't play your game
Don't you feel da shame
Shame ! [x4]
