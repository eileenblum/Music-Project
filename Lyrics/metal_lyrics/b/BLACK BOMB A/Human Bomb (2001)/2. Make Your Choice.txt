You feel the anger
You rise up
You're thinking differently
You're looking like me
You're violence is your enemy
You cannot stand this pressure
You feel the tension now
You feel the tension now
So liberate youre fucking hate

[Refrain:]
Push da flame under the black bomb A
Go ! [x4]

Push it !
You will go high
You push it
You'll see da light
I push it
This is my pride
You push it

Release your mind

You feel the anger
You rise up
You wanna run away
I know you can't run away
So get the cure to fight ' cause
You feel the venom now
You feel the venom now
So liberate your fucking hate

[Refrain]

We are the slaves of corrupted rules
Just say fuck it, just say you're fucking them
Just be united to change da world
' cause you are not alone,
man, you are not alone
Da wars, da drugs, that's what they have made
The sheep are hypocrites,
don't be a hypocrite
' cause we have only one life to grow
So don't let them stop you and grow !

We don't believe the suckers ! [x4]
We don't believe the suckers, no ! [x4]

[Refrain]

Here I go ! I'm pushing da flame
Here I go ! I'm pushing da flame !

And every day, I'm fucking the pressure
I'm pushing the flame
And every day, I'm fucking the pressure
I'm pushing the flame
And every day, I'm fucking the pressure
I'm pushing the flame
Bo, I cannot stand the pressure so
I'm pushing the flame ! [x2]
