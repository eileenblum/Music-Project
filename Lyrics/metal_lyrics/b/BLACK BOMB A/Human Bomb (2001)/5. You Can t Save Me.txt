[Couplet 1:]
I don't care what you think of me
Different I like to be
So don't try to change my way
You can't save me

[Couplet 2:]
I don't tell you how to be
don't try to judge me
I'm getting strange everyday
You can't save me no !

You can't save me no !
You can't save me no !
You can't save me no !
You can't save me no !

No ! No ! No! No !..............

You're afraid for me
That's your principal problem
You're afraid for me
' cause you're living among the dead

So can't you wake up, I cannot be another man now !

I'll stay ! [x8]

I'll stay on my way !

[Couplet 1]
[Couplet 2]

You can't save me no !
You can't save me no !
You can't save me no !
You ! can't ! no!!!

I wish I will kill da pain
I'll kill da pain
I wish, I wish, I will kill da pain
In me [x2]

[Couplet 1]
[Couplet 2]

I understand, I see, but I cannot forgive [x2]

Get out da bastards [x4]

Human people have to overcome their egocentrism

Get out da bastards
Get out da bastards [x2]
Get get get get... out !
