Baby do you believe all what's going around you ?
Baby do you believe in me ?
Baby do you believe all what's going around you ?
Baby do you believe in me ?

I live my life like a fucking madman,
'cause they want to destroy me
So I'm doing my best to make them pay da price

Like a dog, like a fox, like a prey, like a spy
I'm running all da way to save my life

You say you love my life, you say you love my style, you say...
But do you really know what il means to be with me
'cause I'm living like a criminal, I cannot be sentimental, but
I wanna change for you now

Alone
You're down
But da people will
Bring you down [x2]

Down
You know they'll never cease to burn you up inside
Down
You know they'll never cease to burn you, to burn you up inside [x2]

"Hey you, do you think that's a serious world !"
[Verse:]
Alone
You're down
But da people will
Bring you down [x2]

Down
You know they'll never cease to burn you up inside
Down
You know they'll never cease to burn you, to burn you up inside [x2]

"Hey you" "Hey you" "Hey you"...
"Break it down !"

I feel da pain, all that pain, for you and I
There is no more place, there's no more place for you in my life
I don't need your love

I dream of a better world...
