Listen to this sound
Don't leave me alone, Right!
Sing that song, Come on!
Listen to this sound
Don't leave me alone, Yeah right!
Sing that song

My blood is warm
Maybe cold sometimes
When I feel you're around
Waiting for the last moment
Not a move, Not a breath
When I feel you're around

Sing - Scream Baby
Dream of your better world [x2]
One sound bite to react

Wildly myself
Shaking my head
I close my eyes
And I give you the best of me
To get the best of you
When I know you're around
Not quite sure if i will see it throught
But if i see it throught I'll be stronger and stronger
Not quite sure if i will see it throught
But if i see it throught I'll go further and further

Sing - Scream Baby
Dream of your better world [x3]
One sound bite to react

Sing - Scream baby
Dream of your better world

Inspire and expire
First rule of feeling fine
Do not hold your tears
Or do not hold your words
Who believes he can judge you
Different but engage in the same game
One step for solidarity
You fall but always stand up to move forward

Sing - Scream Baby
Dream of your better world [x2]
One sound bite to react

Not quite sure if I will see it throught
(Sing that song - Scream Baby) [x4]

This is my song
This is my song [x3]
Don't leave me alone
(Sing - Scream, Baby, Dream)

This is my song
This is my song
Sing - Scream, Baby, Dream
