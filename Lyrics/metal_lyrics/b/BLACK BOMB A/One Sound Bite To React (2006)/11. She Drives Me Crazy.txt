She drives me crazy

I know she's faithless to me
There's no way to refuse her kiss

Enjoy It, Danger, Danger, Danger
Everything becomes dangereous
Enjoy It, Danger, Danger, Danger
You won't be strong enough to resist
Enjoy It, Danger, Danger, Danger
With the lady dressed in white
Enjoy It, Danger, Danger, Danger
You won't be strong enough to resist

I know she's faithless to me once again and once
Again cannot ignore it
I know she's faithmess to me impossible
To refuse her kiss

Enjoy it, You won't be strong enough to resist

Enjoy it
Each times I meet her she drives me crazy
I'm losing reason
Enjoy it
She's bluring my vision, my mind's totally confused
Enjoy it
Each times I meet her she drives me crazy
I'm losing reason
Enjoy it
She's bluring my vision, my mind's totally confused

She drives me crazy [x7]
Coz I'm weak

She drives me crazy [x7]
Coz I'm weak
