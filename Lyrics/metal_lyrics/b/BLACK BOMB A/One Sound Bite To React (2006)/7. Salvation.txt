Grow, Grow
It's your revenge, You stand up
Slow, Slow
Enjoy it, Don't miss anything
Grow, Grow
It's your revenge, You stand up
Slow, Slow
Enjoy it, Don't miss anything

No
No time to breath
Go
Don't look back
No
Out of breath
Go
Go further

Time's running out
I can't see anything's coming
Believe in you was a mistake
But reality is quite different

I'm becoming stronger
I'm not afraid of yours threats
I'd rather move forward
You can't keep your venom
I made up in mind
I leave and look outside
I make fun of you
I really got no choice

Losing control, Salvation
Bleeding without pain, Not losing face
Can't bear your control, Damnation
Escape, Escape, Escape, Always the same thing

We are share the same regrets, The same fears
It's time to choose, Time to be cured
Wanna be myself

Keep only one wish in mind
My life's under control, My fate is mine, It's mine
When you make a decision, apply it to yourself
Don't share the tears that are not mine

I'm becoming stronger
I'm not afraid of yours threats
I'd rather move forward
You can't keep your venom
I made up in mind
I leave and look outside
I make fun of you
I really got no choice

Losing control, Salvation
Bleeding without pain, Not losing face
Can't bear your control, Damnation
Escape, Escape, Escape, Always the same thing

Keep only one wish in mind
My life's under control, My fate is mine, It's mine
When you make a decision, apply it to yourself
Don't share the tears that are not mine

Grow, Grow
I
