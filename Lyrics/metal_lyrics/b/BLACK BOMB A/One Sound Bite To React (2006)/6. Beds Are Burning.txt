Out where the river broke
The bloodhood and the desert oak
Holden wracks and boiling diesels
Steam in forty five degrees

The time has come
To say fair's fair
To pay the rent
To pay our share
The time has come
A fact's a fact
It belongs to them
Let's give it back

How can we dance when our Earth is turning
How do we sleep while our beds are burning
How can we dance when our Earth is turning
How do we sleep while our beds are burning

Fours wheels scare the cockatoos
From Kintore east to Yuendemu
The western desert lives and breathes
In forty five degrees

The time has come
To say fair's fair
To pay the rent
To pay our share
the time has come
A fact's a fact
It belongs to them
Let's give it back

How can we dance when our Earth is turning
How do we sleep while our beds are burning
How can we dance when our Earth is turning
How do we sleep while our beds are burning

One More Time

How can we dance when our Earth is turning
How do we sleep while our beds are burning
How can we dance when our Earth is turning
How do we sleep while our beds are burning

The time has come
To say fair's fair
To pay the rent
To pay our share
the time has come
A fact's a fact
It belongs to them
Let's give it back

How can we dance when our Earth is turning
How do we sleep while our beds are burning
How can we dance when our Earth is turning
How do we sleep while our beds are burning
