Let's roll

I say no regrets
I know I'm crazy and weak
I feel so strong
Accept and obey
I know I'm crazy and weak
I feel so strong
I say keep the control
I know I'm crazy and weak
i feel so strong
Accept and let's roll
I know I'm crazy and weak
I feel so strong

When people die my fears and
My pain don't wanna fade away
Don't wanna cast away
When Mother Earth die my shame and
My hate don't wanna fade away
Don't wanna cast away
Human being wants to become their own god
No miracle for the weak
No miracle for the weak
They call it charity I want to walk away
I want to cast away

I hate authority
Never scream never
No, Never be a slave
I say: "I want to be free"
All together, Our names engraved in the stones

I predict the holocaust
We cannot forget errors of the past
You pray and believe that you're going to be saved
Hatred feeds the dog that we call god

I say no regrets
I know I'm crazy and weak
I feel so strong
Accept and obey
I know I'm crazy and weak
I feel so strong
I say keep the control
I know I'm crazy and weak
i feel so strong
Accept and let's roll
I know I'm crazy and weak
I feel so strong

When people die my fears and
My pain don't wanna fade away
Don't wanna cast away
When Mother Earth die my shame and
My hate don't wanna fade away
Don't wanna cast away
