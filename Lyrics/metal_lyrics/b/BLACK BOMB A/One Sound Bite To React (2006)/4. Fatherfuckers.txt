No, You're not on the right track
Listen: Always
You're bound by rules

One day, you'll finally understand
That it's impossible to
Accept, Agree, Live with your bullshit

So, Don't forget this rule
If one day, You
Want to get rich

All your bullshit means nothing to me
I freely live my
Thoughts, Convictions, Dreams, and Music

I don't need anybody
Don't wanna hear your bullshit [x4]
I don't need anybody
Don't wanna hear your bullshit

Ladies and Gentleman, Introducing the
Hottest band you've ever heard
Yes, I discovered it, Come on Move to the beat

Keep in mind that you owe me
Your name, Your career, Your life, Your ass

You should know my ass is not for sale
There's no way to trade my ego, My soul, My pride

Go away and Fuck you
(Get away and Fuck you) [x4]

I don't need anybody
Don't wanna hear your bullshit [x3]
I don't need anybody
Don't wanna hear your bullshit
