No I will never change
No I will never change

I want to set all stars on fire
And change my life to become a man
Now I want know who and where I am

Hiding vices can't free the devil. Within
But you got to cope whit it

Hero - No ; Leader - No
Master - No ; Killer - No
Rapist - No ; Liar - No
Cruel - No ; Fucker - No
Hero - No ; Leader - No
Master - No ; Killer - No
Rapist - No ; Liar - No

I'm just sorry to be myself

Hero - No ; Leader - No
Master - No ; Killer - No [x2]
Rapist - No ; Liar - No
No I will never change

Don't need to choose any political way
But cannot bear so called pacifists
Now I want know who and where I am

So many questions in search of answers
I know, They said: "I'm crazy"

I'm just sorry to be myself
So when people around judge and criticize me
I feel sorry
I'm just sorry

Can't listen anymore
I live my own life
Can't stop anymore
I waste everything

I'm not the only one to feel bad
I'm not the only one that's thinking this way [x2]
I'm the one considered as a lunatic
I'm not the only one to feel persucated

I'm just sorry to be myself

No I will never change
No I will never change

Hero - No ; Leader - No
Master - No ; Killer - No
Rapist - No ; Liar - No
No I will never change

Hero - No ; Leader - No
Master - No ; Killer - No
