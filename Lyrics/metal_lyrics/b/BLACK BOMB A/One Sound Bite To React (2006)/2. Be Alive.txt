Be alive
Forever
Within my mind
I'm free
I'm alive

Don't want sects
Don't want lies
Just break the wall between you and me

Color my life
Enjoy my mind
I know mom says: "Don't speak to strangers"

One against one, Always for a fight [x2]
One by one into ignorance

I swear on my honor
And I hold my anger
Live every day as the last one

Alive
[x2]
Be alive

Who do I trust?
I don't care
Speak without distrust or wait
I don't want to be alone

I swear on my honor
And I hold my anger
Live every day as the last one

Alone I'm afraid I become crazy
I don't manage to choose my way
Alone I'm afraid of my enemies
So many fights to exist
Forget who i am by irony
I don't want the peace by throught
All together I know that you can help me
Be alive

Alive
[x2]
Be alive

Who do I trust?
I don't care
Speak without distrust or wait
I don't want to be alone

I swear on my honor
And I hold my anger
Live every day as the last one

Alone I'm afraid I become crazy
I don't manage to choose my way
Alone I'm afraid of my enemies
So many fights to exist
Forget who i am by irony
I don't want the peace by throught
All together I know that you can help me
Be alive

Alive
[x2]
Be alive

Alive
You don't care

Forever
Within my mind
I'm free
I'm alive
