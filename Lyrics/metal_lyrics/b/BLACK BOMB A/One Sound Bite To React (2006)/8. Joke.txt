Your life is a joke [x4]

Look at the world around you and tell me:
Can't you see everything's a joke
Everyone looking for pleasure,
Need of adrenalin, Need of sexual, Action

Open your eyes, It's not a crime
Don't think that it's much dirty or bad
You must think by yourself, Don't hold back
Explode, We're talking about your drives

Distorded modesty, Stuck up
Daytime, Dick Inside at night
Look like nothing appear the opposite
Almighty without confessions

Ectasy's my line of fire, Your life joke
You do not dare
You virtue! Fuck, I don't care
Are you still right? Your life joke
Eat life with relish
You do not dare
Your virtue, fuck! Fuck, I don't care

Your life is a joke

My way of thinking is not the same
But I know that you have it in you, You envy me
You can't stop think of it
Obsession makes you sick
So, What is keeping you from pleasure

Ectasy's my line of fire, Your life joke
You do not dare
You virtue! Fuck, I don't care
Are you still right? Your life joke
Eat life with relish
You do not dare
Your virtue, fuck! Fuck, I don't care

Your life is a joke

Ectasy's my line of fire, Your life joke
You do not care
You virtue! Fuck, I don't care
Are you still right? Your life joke
Eat life with relish
You do not care
Your sweet virtue! Fuck, I don't care

I can't stop, It's like cocaine
I want it more and I will find my target x5

Ectasy's my line of fire, Your life joke
You do not care
You virtue! Fuck, I don't care
Are you still right? Your life joke
Eat life with relish
You do not care
Fuck, I don't care

Open your eyes, It's not a crime
Use everything, It's belongs to you
Open your eyes, It's not a crime
Explode, We're talking about your drives
