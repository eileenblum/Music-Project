Be my guest
Come home and take my place
Be my guest
Be - Be my guest

Trust me, trust me, I'm by your side
I give you my life so that you can save me
I rule the game, I want it see so I can help you
You think you can privide all my needs
Believe me, I want to see you going better
I give you my life and the one of those I love
You keep on surviving, I suggest your life
Be my guest and take place

If you feel the urge, Call me by my name
If you need illusion by my name
If you feel the urge, Call me by my name
You will find the light by my name

Let me be a modern time vampire
Behind the door, You wait like a bird of prey
I'm blessed by God, He commands me to rule this world
You think, You know my death will be slow
Why resist me while I can relieve your sufferings
One day, Your arrogance will prove you wrong
I drink your wealth to calm my thirst of fortune
Be my guest and take place

If you feel the urge, Call me by my name
If you need illusion by my name
So If you feel the urge, Call me by my name
You will find the light by my name

Always the same reasons
Give hapiness and then burn it
Destroy lives coz they're worth nothing
Myselfish being stands before all
Incarnated by the law of divine
Your thirst of blood drives you blind
Feed the hatred who'll kill yourself
Human being persist in making history repeats

I always can find good reasons
To pull covers from my part
Fear my name, You: Weak
Listen and learn from me

If you feel the urge, Call me by my name
If you need illusion by my name
So If you feel the urge, Call me by my name
You will find the light by my name
