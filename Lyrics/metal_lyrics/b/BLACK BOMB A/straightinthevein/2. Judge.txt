Justice's sometimes so wrong, so bad, take it is pussy
Justice's sometimes so wrong, so fucking scheibe
Justice's sometimes so wrong, so bad, take it is pussy
Justice's sometimes so wrong, so bad, fick dichÂ !

Why me you judge you judge and break my life

You break my life
I was just blind
I grew up so wild
Did not want this crime
Walking in this park
Fighting in the park
Couldn't stop myself
Did not want his death

I am in jail I'm alone
Every night I sleep with my regrets
I'm alone
Can't escape
Crying inside

Minutes like days
I don't sleep at night
But my wings are lies
I just cannot fly
Walking in this park
Never meets this man
Live a normal life
A wife and a child 
I was a child 
I was not bad
Do you hear
I swear
He kicked me
I trashed him
You know
I swear

I'm alone
Live with this death 
I am alone
Life in a grave
Crying inside

I pay the price 
Just like a crow
You know
I'm trapped
I dream it
I want it
You laugh
I'm lost 

Because I cannot escape, whyÂ !!!

I can't stand this place of shit
Bloody fists are smashing all around
This place is bad for me I think I'm going mad
I pay a price too strong for my young life
Should be good for justice that you realize
Too much time in jail no good for the guys
Criminals are sometimes created by the laws
Can't be good in a cage where I have to grow
Grow Grow Grow Grow

One more proof that some of the problems
Are created by the ones who judge men
One more proof that some of the problems
Come from the motherfucking judgement
Judge Judge You're like bastards
Judge Judge You're like bastards
Judge Judge Judge Judge

I'm in jail
I'm alone
Every night I sleep with my regrets
I'm alone
Can't escape
Crying inside
I sleep with my regrets
I'm alone
Sleep with my regrets
And every night
I sleep with my regrets
I'm alone
Can't escape
Crying inside
I'm in jail 
I'm alone
Live with this death 
And I dig my grave 
I'm dead 
My soul cries 
Live with his death 
And I dig my grave 
I'm dead 
My soul cries 
Live with this death 
And I dig my grave 
I'm dead 
My soul cries  

Because I cannot escape why
Why must I pay so much for this crimeÂ ???
