Oh my friends l'm leaving this world
Paranoia
Law's phobia
Paranoia

Come to my world with your hate and your anger
I'm crossing the treshold that keeps all the borders
I can't stand this world where so few have the power
I'm so disgusted by men and their valours
I am the man who's fighting all the cries
i am the real anarchist
I want the death of all the system lies
This time will come because of meÂ !

Searching for powers to fight all those liars
Good bye my friends now I'm fighting the bastards
Prepare the cops, I will break all the barrages
I choose the violence to express all my rage
I'm the man the real anarchist
Pigs will be dead, I will be satisfied
This gun is charged and I'm mad

Oh my friendsâ¦.my friends
I'm leaving this worldâ¦. This world of shit

Paranoia
Law's phobia
Paranoia
This place's fucking shit

I'm so different in all my emotions
I want to change the way of my reflexions
I'm OK now to begin the fight
I want to escape I don't care for the price
Oh I'm the man who's fighting all the cries
I'm the real anarchist
I want the death of all the system lies
This time will come because of meÂ !

Breaking the lawsÂ !

My life is a failure, if I can't change this place
So call the justice my fist will break its face
And call the lawyers with their fucking disgrace
And call the police, my gun begins its race

Come and begin the fightÂ !
Can't you read in my mind!
I fightÂ !

Oh my friendsâ¦.my friends
I'm leaving this worldâ¦. This world of shit
Oh my friendsâ¦ my fucking friends
I'm leaving this worldâ¦. This world of shit

I was wrong I can't lie
I'm too weak to fight
Now I'm under their control
And I can't kill them all
They put me into jail
And all my pride is raped
I can't always escape
Cause drugs I learned to take
I love you mary jane
But I'm going insane
I feel too much pain
Poison runs in my veins
Now I can't stand the shame
More poison in my veins
I dieÂ !!!
