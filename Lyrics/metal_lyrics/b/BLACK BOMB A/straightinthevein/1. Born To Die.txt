Come in, you're running, you're fighting,
You're bleeding, you're playing like a crack,
But you stay in the tracks

Living you're hating, you're trying,
You're loving, you're fighting to the core
And you're breaking all the doors

Come on, you're rising, you're trying,
You're growing, you die
Born to die
Come in this game with the hardcore
The most hostile
Born to die

Come on &amp; play, come on &amp; play
You have no choice because if you lose
You will pay
I want to try, I want to try
I make a higher bid if I lose I die

I kick the ball right through the stars
I get the points to hide my scars
I want to destroy all this place
But multiball fall down on my face

After all I'm still alive
And I continue the strife
Here comes the end level monster
I want to win &amp; kill this motherf**ker

I'm the game society dog
Guardian of the keys of all doors
Laws in my mind fascist god
I want to kill you motherf**ker

Burning you fire takatapaw fire
Burning you motherf**ker fire
Takatapaw

Rebel people is rebel people is 
Rebel people is born to dieÂ !
