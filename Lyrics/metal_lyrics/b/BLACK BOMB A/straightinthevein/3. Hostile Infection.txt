You're black or white green or maybe yellow
United for poor bullshit &amp; sorrow
Diguidiguiba just like the fucking cops
You play the king in front of your gang block
You kick the weak, let me laufh little bastard
When you're alone you watch the ground coward
Let me tell you what is your problem
You're corrupt just like the system

War Walking on the fucking system

You're a pig fighting for the dollars
For a god a master, a coward
So come for the devil come for the pain
Come for the devil who's growing insane

Wait a minute you have to kill much more
Burn the girls, burn the child burn the store
Come for the devils, come for the pain
Come for the fight, prepare for the war

War Walking on the fucking system

Walking on the militai 
For the people for our rights
Walking on the militia
For freedom they have to die
Walking on the militia
We hate you then we will fight
Walking on the militia
You're traitors corrupt inside

Hostile infection
Infection

You're a trust plenty of ambitions
Watch for your shares, for your time &amp; for your millions
You feel so good swimming in your dollars
So buy a bitch, a steelworks, a cigar
Get more money so cut salaries down
Spend your life exploiting the poor
You fucking rich bitch, you make me sick
Come for the fight, prepare for the war

War Walking on the fucking system

I am the one who laugh alone, I'm flying upon you
And I get scorn.. scornâ¦.scorn
And I wait to break you down
And I laugh about your laws
And I wait to break you down, down, down, down, down
And I laugh about your laws
I am the one who laugh alone
And I fly and I get scorn
I am the one who laugh alone
And I fly and I get scorn
And I'm waiting to break you down
And I'm hating your heart of stone
And I get scorn and I get scorn
And I getâ¦ I getâ¦. I getâ¦ Iâ¦.
