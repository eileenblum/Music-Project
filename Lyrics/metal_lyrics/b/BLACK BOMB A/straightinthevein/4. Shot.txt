So I live in this city, live with this shame
Live with this hate which is growing insane
So I live in this city, live with this pain
Live with this hate which is growing insane
Shot!!

I can't believe this might when he took me Remember
For always I have lost my pride when he raped me Remember
I'm feeling so dirty inside cause he took me Remember
I think I'm losing my minde cause he raped me Remember
Obey Shot Obey Shot Obey

Now it's time to go for taking your revenge
He really don't care what I'm feeling inside
I don't wanna hear something about rights
Come I'll kill you for my paine for my pride
Fuck the system I will use my power
Working hard To find where live the bastard
Hate forever My soul is full of anger
Fascist cock You'll meet the great avenger

I'll shot you with a gun
Oh my lover, I will kick kick kick your soul in hell
Oh I really lose my mind, I can't commit a crime
Now I feel like shit, I remember your fucking weight
Your stinking breadâ¦.

Take your gun now, push the trigger
Take your gun and shot the fucker
Take a shotgun, push the trigger
Take a shotgun and shot the fucker

Feel disgusted by the seed that he gave to you
Remember fucking dick pushing inside you
Feel the pressure becoming a torture
Feel the pressure, don't care for the future
Obey Shot Obey Shot Obey

Nothing to say, here comes your end
No mercy, I'm taking my revenge
You cannot run, I keep the gun
You can cry I don't believe your lies
Shot down shot down shot down shot down
Subliminal shot Criminal shot
