Maybe one day you

Legalize me - No corruption
Legalize me - No laws
Legalize me - No remorse
Legalize me - I'm the king
Legalize me - And my vices
Legalize me - And Chaos
Legalize me - to survive
Legalize me - I am GOD

I'm the reflect of nobody 
I'm an engraved icon 
I'm stronger by raise me
A leader who speak for you

Why don't you listen to meÂ ?!
Why don't you follow meÂ !
Why don't you react

Follow me - fightÂ !
Trust me - fightÂ !
Help me and I will be grateful
FightÂ !

You're the reflect of nobody 
You're an engraved icon
You're stronger by raise me
Leaders in quest of truthÂ ?

Now you have understood
United, we're stronger
Together we're able to settle up with
This fuckin' system that can't even feed our dreams

You're the kingÂ !
I'm the king too!
Leaders in quest of truthÂ ?
