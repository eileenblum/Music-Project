It's my own way
And you'll come to me 

like a symphony life is written 
with its powerful moments
No desire to control it
Life is the thing that 
makes me forge ahead
I owe it my existence

Can't you see in my eyes
the mistakes I've done
And the desire to put it right
Can't you feel in my silences 
the need to break self-defences

[Ref.]
Let me manage my life
Let me be to become 
what i am
Don't engage new wars
I've being listening to you
so if only you could let me speak

Why don't you listen to your fellowsÂ ?
Are you afraid they could be wrongÂ ?
Out-of-the-way, you can't be strong
Open yourself to the world and rise up

I'm fightin' against myself
And so i'm changing my way of life
when I'm seized with disgust
I'm losin' control
I'm fightin' against myself
And so i'm changing my way of life
when I'm seized with disgust
Losin' control

[Ref.]
Let me manage my life
Let me be to become 
what i am
Don't engage new wars
I've being listening to you
so if only you could let me speak

I need some help
I have no more time
