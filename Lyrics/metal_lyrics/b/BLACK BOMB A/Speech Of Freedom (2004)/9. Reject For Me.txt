Who are you to judge meÂ ?
Who the fuck are youÂ ?

Fuck your line of conduct
All your fuckin' rules
Fuck your puritanism
Your false chastities

Fuck your line of conduct
All your fuckin' rules
Fuck your economy
The one that kills the weak

You know the refusal that I have
of everything that comes from you
The same denial 
You give to me and my freedom

Yeah Yeah Yeah Reject for me

Fight against the war 
All kind of repression
Fight against elitism
Roots of all iniquity

Fuck your puritanism
Your false chastities 
Fight against prejudices 
We don't wanna be a victim 

Fight against the war
Fight against the war 
Fight against the war 
Fight against the war 
All kind of repression

[Ref.]
I can't stand it any longer
I can't stand it any longer
There's no need to give you 
My faith,my confidence and myself

Fuck your line of conduct
All your fuckin' rules 
Fuck your puritanism
Your false chastities

Fight against the war 
All kind of repression
Fight against elitism
Roots of all iniquity

We are the resistance
The deterrent force now
Now we're so different
But together so complete

We're a tribe but so lonely
We're free
And at the same time
Prisoners.
I cry. 

Not tribe just so lonely
