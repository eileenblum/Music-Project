NO STRESS
When people say:" you are a bastard" 
Set on you, you got to keep your 
CONTROL
Do not go into their game, 
ignore the speak of gossip
NO STRESS
When they speak for you, 
thinkin that everything's under 
CONTROL
Don't forget (that) 
you are the master of your fate

Can't hear your gossip
I go ahead without lookin' back
Can't hear your gossip
I go ahead without lookin' back

NO STRESS
When they judge you however 
your actions they were good or bad
da-Self
CONTROL
At first, show respect for yourself and others
NO STRESS
Soon they will eat your brain, 
Like dogs shot up with L.S.D.
CONTROL
Deaf to their bullshit, Keep on making your own way

Can't hear your gossip
I go ahead without lookin' back
Can't hear your gossip
I go ahead without lookin' back

NO STRESS
They listen, talk, judge 
now I'm losin my self
CONTROL
Nothing happens, nothing changes
In their small lives 
NO STRESS
No more finger pointed at me
Now I'm losin 
CONTROL
The right to live my life 
as the freeman

I go, I go, I shoot at the gossip
They are my targets
Coz I'm free
OOOOOOOOOOOO

ONE
Bullet in your head
Today's news speak about you (too)
TWO
Suffocate with your own hate
Or you will test my fist for free
THREE
Don't try to spoil my sky
it's such an important thing
FOUR
Me to live my secrets
I don't wanna live for glory
I don't wanna live for glory
I don't wanna live for glory

A glory for a life
I don't want it
My whole life for glory
Hate or GloryÂ ?
A glory for a life
I don't want it

without lookin' back
I go ahead
With no turning back
I go ahead

Can't hear your gossip
I go ahead without lookin' back
Can't hear your gossip
I can't hear
