I look within yourself
I can see truth,love, 
hate inside of you and me 
can feel inside of you
Feel my flame, your flame 
That burns inside of you and me
And I hope from you
I hope honesty, condolence 
from you and me
And I want from you
I want trust, no more distrust
for you and me
to give to receive, you know that, 
nothing is free. 
Everything has a price
Hard to find a compromise
Roads part easily everyone 
Everyone makes its own way

Brothers tear apart
To feel unique
Friends destroy themselves
Just to end up lonely
Brothers tear apart
To feel unique
Friends destroy themselves
Just to end up lonely

We looked for our common points to find each other
in our opposites, we even laid bare ourselves
to carry masks. 
But there's nothing true anymore 
everything's stopped, 
The story is over
I shall not forget, I've learnt. 

I want to live all your experiences. 
I want to be with you during the bad days. 
And to delight myself in your enjoyments, 
but Love is a self-sacrifice. 

Lovers hate each other
Just to feel free
races kill each other 
not to be outcasts anymore
Lovers hate each other
Just to feel free
Even races kill each other 
not to be outcasts anymore

Like a double I can see yourself in the mirror
I can see truth,love, 
hate inside of you and me 
Close your eyes I know where we're goin'
my flame, your flame 
That burns inside of you and me
Why do you suddenly go away from me
I hope from you
I hope honesty, condolence
Like a double I can see yourself in the mirror
I want trust, no more distrust
for you and me

I could not be the reflect of 
someone else

I could not be the reflect of 
someone else 
I don't wanna love anymore 
if we are separated
I don't wanna give my friendship 
to be betrayed
I can't feed my roots anymore 
my heart has become dry
I could not be the reflect of 
someone else 

Lovers hate each other 
Brothers tear apart
Friends destroy themselves
Races kill each other 

I live and let myself one more chanceâ¦
â¦to love stronger even if I know it can open 
those old but still living sores one more time
â¦to trust my friends again, those who had 
hurtfull words when I wasn't there
â¦to take up blood ties - I need to know 
where I come from
â¦to accept my fellow whoever he is
And wherever he comes from
Coz like a double 
I see myself in you

Lovers hate each other 
Double, Double
Races kill each other 
Double, Double
Brothers tear apart
Double, Double
Friends destroy themselves
Double, Double
Double, Double
