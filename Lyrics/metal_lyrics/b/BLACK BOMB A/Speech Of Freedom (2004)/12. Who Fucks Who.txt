I raise the fist
I stress my dreams
I scream to feel free
I sing anthems
Raise the people
Rely on you, if you don't lie

Who do you believe you mislead
When you say freedom, then sold yourself power

Who fucks who?
When your word is questioned
Who fucks who?
Your speeches take different turning
Who fucks who?
When solutions cannot be solved
Who fucks who?
Everybody, and world collapses

I hate your style
Hostile I am!

Who do you believe you mislead
When you say freedom, then sold yourself power

You don't fight for the good
You don't fight for the bad
One day you'll pay cause we're going mad 
you work hard for yourself

Who fucks who?
When your word is questioned
Who fucks who?
Your speeches take different turning
Who fucks who?
When solutions cannot be solved
Who fucks who?
Everybody, and world collapses

I hate your style
Hostile I am!

I hate your style
Speech of freedom
Hostile I am

I'm looking down 
I am alone
I shut my mouth, 
Speak for myself only

And if you try again
To change my life with words
Remember when you say freedom, then sold yourself power
And I say: "Who fuck who?"

Who fucks who? Who?
Who fucks who? Who?
Who fucks who? Who?

Who fucks who?
When your word is questioned
Who fucks who?
Your speeches take different turning
Who fucks who?
When solutions cannot be solved
Who fucks who?
Everybody, and world collapses

I hate your style
Hostile I am!

Freedom, freedom, freedom 
Speech of freedom
