Look at the pain [x2]

Look at the pain [x2]
Take pleasure, see misery
Look at the pain [x2]
Take pleasure, see misery
Look at the pain [x4]

Don't want to see it anymore
I prefer to fight

Look at the painâ¦
Your images make me sick
Blind people, 
Peace of mindÂ :
Fucked from today

Look at the painâ¦
Men dyin' for a religion
No mercy
Blind horrors
Fucked from today

Look at the painâ¦
Now sacrify in 
the name of profit
No more love
fucked from today

look at the pain..
the planet is poisoned
who will payÂ ?
it's too late
fucked from today

Power
On your screen
Valours
On your screen
sufferings
On your screen
run, devil, run

[Ref:]
Dead by my hand
By my mind
Straight in your head
When fiction becomes reality

[Break]

Steal poor people:
Make money
To finance your clean wars

See the effects of your propaganda
Look: the all world is fooling itself

And I sayÂ :
I'm changed
Broken 
Despoiled
Deceived
Abused
Betrayed
Tornâ¦ 
You suckersÂ !

Every war has its innocents
Turn their life into weapons
Give an excuse to all of your crimes
Now pain feeds meâ¦
