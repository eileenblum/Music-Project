Behind the door what can you hearÂ ?
_ sorrows
Who do you think they belong
_ to a woman
Why does she stop breathing now?
_she's dying
why can't your hands shake anymoreÂ ?
_ i loved her, i desired her and hated her
i felt so bad when her eyes read my secret lines
mercy meÂ ! don't smile anymoreÂ !
_ she's coldâ¦
anger's growing as I look at you
_ come with me

Now it's time for you to taste the distress
you could never have suspected in me 
Now it's time for you to feel my violence
a violence we built, together

I love her body so much
her moist and half opened sex
my hands stained by her blood
and sperm
for life I will bear the scars 
within my flesh 

Hate, violence, Anger
I've learnt through you
I'll never be able to soothe 
the distress burning within me
Just one goal for me 
to take your life
Only for revenge
