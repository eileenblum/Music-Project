TVÂ : Drug of the nation 

I want it more 
I always want it more and more
I need it again 
your screens lobotomize me
I want it more 
I always want it more and more
Coz your screens erase me

No need to learn.
Life through screens.
All is fake, just some conditioning.
There's no reality anymore
No need to learn.
Life through screens.
All is fake, just some conditioning.
There's no reality anymore

Burn, burn TV burn
TV: a virus which divides us
Burn, burn TV burn 
TV takes us high, attracts us
Burn, burn TV burn 
Like a needle driven through my veins
Burn, burn TV burn 
Hypnotic, narcotic, cathodic
Coz your screens erase me

No need to learn.
Life through screens.
All is fake, just some conditioning.
There's no reality anymore
No need to learn.
Life through screens.
All is fake, just some conditioning.
There's no reality anymore

Your world, a remote control
Burn, burn TV burn
Your life is under control
Burn, burn TV burn
Your wife get bored by your side
Burn, burn TV burn
Your hands grip tightly armchairs
Burn, burn TV burn
When your spirit is touched
Burn, burn TV burn
