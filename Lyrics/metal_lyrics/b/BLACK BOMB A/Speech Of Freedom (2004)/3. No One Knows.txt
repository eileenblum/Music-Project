No one, No

No one, No
No one can tell me why, why
People confound pleasure with rape
If the walls of these cellars
Could speak, could tell us the truth now
Now, I want truth

Always the same scenes, 
You dream about it 
Always the same plans, 
Envy is so strong
Unfortunate fate and free hate
obsession is so big

No one, No
No one can tell me why, why
Kids become criminals
Next door, your own daughter
mollested like an animal
An easy prey

You'll deserve the hate you create
You'd played with someonelses fate
The broken lives you carry on
Your worst nightmares, they will become but

No one, No
No one can tell me how
Human being can fall so deep
When man becomes a pig
And that rape becomes a rule

Shame on you, Shame on you
Shame on you, Shame on you

[Ref:]
No one knows
facing powerless lost innocence
My hate grows slow
Your sister's maybe screaming next door

No one, No
No one can tell me why
People confound pleasure with rape
If the walls of these cellars
Could speak, could tell us the truth now
Now, I want truth

A no man's land for human right
Where respect deals only with violence
A sad rule for a non-sense game
Whose victim each time the same

[Ref:]
No one knows
facing powerless lost innocence
My hate grows slow
Your sister's maybe screaming next door

No one, No
No one can tell me how
Human being can fall so deep
When man becomes a pig
And that rape becomes a rule

Shame on you, Shame on you
Shame on you, Shame on you
