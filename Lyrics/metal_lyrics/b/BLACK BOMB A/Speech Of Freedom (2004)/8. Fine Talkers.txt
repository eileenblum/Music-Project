I'm fed up with your lies
I am tired of your promises.
Your words make me sick,
Your words make me sick,
I am tired of your promises.
Your words make me sick,
Impostor of modern times

Fine talkers, fine talkers
You've big mouth, great defenders
Fine talkers, fine talkers
You could betray your mothers

You don't know the doubt.
Your road is sown of swindle.
you think you're with shelter.
Deceiver, fear our anger.

You, policies
You, opportunists
You, careerists
You, fucking liars
You, policies
You, opportunists
You, careerists
You, fucking liars

Fine talkers, fine talkers
You've big mouth, great defenders
Fine talkers, fine talkers
You could betray your mothers

It's over, I hope it's over.
You will not win over 
anybody anymore.
We will stop you
in your insane race
Be afraid, fear me.
take care of your ass.
Your thirst of power
Cannot dried up.
You'll get wasted by your acts
Early or late, your time will come.
