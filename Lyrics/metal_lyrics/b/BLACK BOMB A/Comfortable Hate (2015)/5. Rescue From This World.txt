It's alright oh yeah 
It's alright yeah man 
It's alright you're my friend 
It's alright until the end. 

What sort of a man can I be if I don't help out my friends? 
What sort of a man can I be if I don't act like a man? 
What sort of a man can I be ... 

To give apart of me, a breath, my faith 
Light in the dark, new beat day by day 
I don't know if I'm stronger than my fears 
To fight for your battles, a right of life 
Rage in my eyes, all the stars in me 
Hold me in your arms and come dance with death. 

Rescue from this world! 
Put your hand in mine 
Rescue from this world! 
No one wants this end 
Forget the bite of this suffering 
Old or young, always the same way 
Rescue from this world! 

Seeking the fire of life in your heart 
And burning like a star every day 
I don't want to forget everything we had 
Drinking your tears to dry your pain, your hate 
The fear of death I say I fuck this fate 
Everything is possible, so follow me 

Let me be your antidote 
Is this another stream or last call 
I release your body from this hurt 
Something new arrives in my heart and in my soul 

Someone help! Someone help you 
Rescue from this world !
