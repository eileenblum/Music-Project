Misery, for you all! 
Misery, it's a game! 
Misery, we are in the land of bastards! 

I can't trust nobody the prey to my nightmare 
I can see around me monsters I don't care 
I believe all is done, I know my soul has done 
I believe all is done for this time I feel like a stone 
I can't stand once again and I realize 
Again again again again again once again I am so sickened 

Such pleasure disappears 
Such feelin' with no fear 
Such corruption of mind 
Such! 

I can feel all this pain we want to inflict 
We love to inflict pain a kind of drug addict 
They feel the need to fall as though dragged into this hole 
Maybe the time as come to die like bloody scum 
If I can't be strong enough 
Again again again again again once again I am so sickened 

Pleasure will disappear! 
Leaving this place of darkness! 
We have the same illness! 
The cure has disappeared! 

The prey of my nightmare 
Full of hate! [2x] 
Want you everything must change 
You don't care [2x] 
Land of bastards 
This is my hell [2x] 

The fear takes over me feeding this terror 
I am subject to the storm 
Am I like the shadow? I'm more back than a crow! 
I eat my own fucking brain, my heart endures all this pain 
There is no blood runs in my veins 
Again again again again again once again you're so disgusting 

Why are you boring 
Losing my mind 
Blind people crying 
Forget all signs! 
(you run to your loss)
