They say I'm so alone 
And I sink faster than a stone 
Lost in my trouble... 
I don't care! 

My body bounces like a ball 
The voices speak in my head taking my soul 
I bite I kiss nobody catches me 
Run and run, again and again... 

They say I'm really wild 
And that I reacted like a child 
Losing my way 
I don't care! 

I keep my dreams until I die and more! 
My blood, my tears fall on the floor 
My screams explode from heaven to hell 
And again and again! 

And they play, and I say 
And they rest and I say 

No law oh oh! 

Drug and sex, fuck this life 
In my heart there are a thousand of lies 
I lie I cry I smile not ready to die 
And again and again! 

They say everything I say 
Breathe the air I breathe 
We are the same 
You don't care! 

And I stay 
Fucking insane! 
No law oh oh!
