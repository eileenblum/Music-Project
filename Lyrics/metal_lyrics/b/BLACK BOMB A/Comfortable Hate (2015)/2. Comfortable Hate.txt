Fuck all the rules, all the lies, all regrets 
I spit my blood into your mouth! 

So many bastards, fucking assholes 
One for the bitches who spit on me 
Fuck all the rages! Always the enemy! 

I run everyday, runaway everyday 
I run everyday, my hate losing control 

In this game 
I'm in this fucking game of hate! 

Comfortable! Hate! 
Comfortable! Hate! 

Hidden behind my hate 
I stop giving you love because I'm afraid 
(stop love! Comfortable hate!) 

Love against my fucking hate!
