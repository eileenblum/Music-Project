When I see myself in the mirror
No question for me of surrender
Better as monster than a slave
You've already deg your grave
If you think you see all this shit around me
To be scared and become your pretty doll
You have no idea what I could be come
Painful will be your fall

Your suffering will be such huge pleasure
For the spirit of your victims, this will be a fucking cure

This is what you fucking deserve
Nobody will escape, nobody will do
This is what you fucking deserve
You can't stop the way,
You cannot stop it
This is what you fucking deserve
Nobody will escape, nobody will do

See the devil in my eyes
The rage which comes
I will let you die
I can swear you will cry
See the devil
I will let you die
In front of you,
So face it and realize
I will let you die
You can see,
Your time has come,
So this is it

There's no coming back
Yeah
You, this truth,
Believe me,
It's over
There's no coming back
Yeah
You,
Believe me,
You reached it
There's no coming back
Yeah
You,
Believe me, this truth,
It's over
There's no coming back
Now you can believe me and face it

The point no return
