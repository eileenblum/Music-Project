Stepping into the void 
Yeah I've been there 
Colder my eyes it's more than 
I can't stand to bear 
So many words in my head 
Prisoners in my mouth 
Stepping to the void 
To the other side 

We are legion 
We are heroes 
When life goes on, take a breath and hit the world. 

All my life writing my name on the wall of shame 
When I want to disappear it's not just for the game 
So many words in my head 
Prisoners in my mouth 
Stepping to the void 
To the other side
