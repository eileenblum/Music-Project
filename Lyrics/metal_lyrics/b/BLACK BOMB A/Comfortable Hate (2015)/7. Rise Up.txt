We wanted to set the world on fire 
Erase this world 
But we have just burn our lives 
So many dreams 
There was a revolution to reach the evolution 
The dream of all generations 
We wanted to be free, make a better life 
So many ways 
But searching for a liberty that was already in our hands 
Locked in a box 
Travel across the world 
To find another voice 
To find another fucking way 

Rise up stop fighting your shadows 
Always believe in yourself 
Blinded by the lights you follow 
Want to be a free man 
All rules kill me like a cancer 
Never follow the leader 
Rise up, rise up and go away 

Go away! 
Open your mind 

We wanted to be strong to survive 
So much anger 
But we forgot to live our lives 
The wrong voices 
I don't have satisfaction, losing all the way emotions 
To result my destruction 

I set the world on fire 
Oh erase this world 
I always wanted to be free 
Oh locked in a bow 

I'm still strange 
How to survive? 
Forget your anger 
Yeah I learn every day! 

Choosing the way and accepting my mistakes (my mistakes!) 
Until the end I walk with my regrets (my regrets!)
