Can't wait anymore 
Still ready for the war 
I see you like my prey 
Your own risk if you stay 

We could live day after day 
Don't need to escape and go away 
We must fight to keep our fucking way 
Better to be some kind of fool 
Fuck your rules, I don't wanna be your prey 
Rats which scurry round me 
As a lion I feel free and I want to roar 
No way to rest I have no fear 

After all your refuse 
The world has its law 
I learn you if you chose 
But I know that you're a lost cause 

No way of giving up 
And let you win this desperate struggle 
I believe in my destiny 
I spit on your grave! I spit on your grave! 
I'm stronger than you and I have no limit 

I feel stronger when they're fight with me 
I feel strong when they're in front of me 
Bury me I have nothing to loose 

Can't wait anymore 
Still ready for the war 
I see you like my prey 
Your own risk if you stay 

I would not hesitate to crush your head like a fox 
The only possible option will be to start again 

When we fight as a lion 
Then we are within our rights 
I protected my people!
