Tears of hate 
To fight blinded 
All in my head 
Is erased the dark 

All I need is simply the truth 
So many years that I walk in the desert 
We don't have the right to sacrifice their youth 
But I want to believe in a kind of rebirth 
If one day we could wake up and say no 
It's our duty to resist and not give up 
The time has come to show them who we are 
As warriors we must fucking crush them! 

We're dancing, on the fire 
Always on the razors edge 
Cowards I kill by my hand 
We're dancing in the fire 
Like animals locked in cage 
Anger, suffering like a slave 

Search in me all the truths 
Feel the evolution open your mind 
Accept the temptation 
Pushing the flame 
Become a living dead 
This is your end! 

Tears of hate 
(Always in the pain) 
To fight blinded 
All in my head 
(Die! Die! Die!) 
Is erased the dark 

I don't care what care about 
I don't care you can't figure out 
All our right are not the same 
No matter you feel so shame 

Search... 

Search in me all the truths 
Feel the evolution 
Accept the temptation 
Become a living dead 
This is your end!
