Give me your lips, give me your body 
Let's forget we're alone 
Us and the moon versus the sun 
Our screams resound in the sky 

I see myself in your eyes, I'm a tear that die 
So lost in my way 
I haven't trust, my heart is dust 
I don't need your help 

Why would save me?! 
I'm the poison of your love 

My words build huge walls, a way to protect me 
No suffering if I ignore your loving 
No more scars to heal 

Consequences of betrayals 
Losing my mind, losing my soul 
Deny the love that comes to me 
No more colors, there is just grey 

Show me your pain, show me your feeling 
Try to find another way 
No more questions just want a solution 
Impossible to live a new day 

I can't forget your smile like a knife in my eyes 
Forbidden from loving 
I'm so hurt in my mouth, the taste of blood 
I spit on your face, no forgiveness! 

Poison of your love! 

I'm the poison of your love 
I'm the poison so why would you save me?!
