After all these years 
Still alive! 
We are still hungry 
Still hungry! 
No need to be pushed 
Get away! 
We live to be real 
Fuck yeah! 

Each day I realize 
It's obvious! 
My rage is rising 
More and more! 
We'll never be calmed 
No fucking way! 
Like being addicted! 
Like a drug! 

We're burning up! 
River of lava! 
Can't put us out! 
Fucking white hot! 
We're made for this 
We're not giving up 
Nothing's as good 
Fire! 

We play as if it was our last gig, 
I'm the devil inside you 
We love to share our fast and be with you, 
We'll do it, again and again 
Why should we stop know and quit this shit? 
The devil inside your brain 
We are so proud to live these feelings 
You will always be in our hearts! 

We're burning up, we're not giving up 
We're burning up! On fire! 

Burning up!
