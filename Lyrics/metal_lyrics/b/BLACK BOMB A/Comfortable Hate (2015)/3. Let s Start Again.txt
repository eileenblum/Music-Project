Let's start a... 
Let's start again 

The world as you can see, is falling apart 
You come too far to go back 
Guilty people are exposed when it's too late 
You must know the true reason 
But you continue to make it as bad as possible 
Fuck your world and your vision 
Nothing can make you move and make you change 

Save our life 
Look around you 
Save our house 
Look around you 
Burn your life 
Look around you 
Burn your house 

Your madness leads us to our loss 
Your ignorance leads to pain 
Don't you see that mother earth is dying?
Continue to be insane 
You still run after money, success and fame 
A dead world for you children 
And the only is changing our future! 

Let's start again 
Let's start from the beginning 
Open your mind 
Let's start again 
And don't let the world burn out 
Open your mind 

Save, the world by changing the path 
It's always the same thing 
Save, your son by changing the path 
Never forget our duty 
Save, your son by changing the path 
It's always the same thing 
Save, your son by changing the path 
Never forget our duty
