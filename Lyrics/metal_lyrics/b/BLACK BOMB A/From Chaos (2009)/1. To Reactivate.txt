Check on the sound! Check on the lights!
Invoke the Muses and be on the watch!
Check on the fuel! Check on the pads!
Engage the engine, be ready to start!
Revive the soul! Revive the heart!
Revive the Spirit, put fire in the eyes!
It's time to go! It's time to fight!
Release the Black Bomb and see what arises!

It's time to summon the Council of the brothers, the old brothers of strife!
Cause we're all a part of this great creature, and we share the fire!

It's time to regenerate all the functions
It's time to regenerate all the functions
It's time to regenerate all the functions
Now it's time to restart! [2x]

Check on the sound! Check on the lights!
Invoke the Muses and be on the watch!
Revive the soul! Revive the Heart!
Revive the Spirit, put fire in the eyes!

We're the engine's blood
We're the machine's cries
We're the monster's soul
And we don't wanna die
Give us one more chance
To dance with the stars
To dance with the flames

We're all a part of this great creature, and we share the fire!

It's time to regenerate all the functions
It's time to regenerate all the functions
It's time to regenerate all the functions
Now it's time to restart! [2x]

Check on the sound! Check on the lights!
Invoke the Muses and be on the watch!
Revive the soul! Revive the Heart!
Revive the Spirit, put fire in the eyes!
Check on the fuel! Check on the pads!
Engage the engine, be ready to start!
It's time to go! It's time to fight!
Release the Black Bomb and see what arises!

We're the engine's blood
We're the machine's cries
We're the monster's soul
And we don't wanna die
Give us one more chance
To dance with the stars
To dance with the flames [2x]

Can you tell us where's the border between love and hate
We are devoured by the passion that we created
It feeds our dream but we are scared of life
No pain, no gain, we know and we're wasting our lives
Together in its name we dance with the flames
Together in its name we jump in the fire

Monstrum Ist bereit Vorzundung Vier, drei, zwei, eins!
GOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Das Monstrum, steigt auf, hor doch, den Ton des Bombenalarms!
Das Monstrum, steigt auf, hor doch, den Ton des Bombenalarms!
Now we're dancing with the flames, and now we're dancing with the stars.
And we don't care if we're to blame.
It's a passion, not a shame, it looks like love, it sounds like war!

It's living in me, it's living in me, it's living in me [3x]
One more chance! Let it roll! One more dance! Never fall! Ever dance! Never fall! [2x]
It's living in me and you, it's living in me and you, It's living in me and you [12x]
