Uncivilization

Watch in the eyes of the world the streams of blood flowing on my words.
So real is the fear of its brother, the human race's ready for the war.
Having to die for the strife or lie to be saved. I don't want to believe it.
Being strong for the fight and dreaming of freedom. I'm too tired to believe.

Who'll be dead? Who'll be safe?
You'll be saved
Who'll be safe? Who'll be dead?
You'll be dead [2x]
I'll be saved... you'll be saved
I'll be dead... you'll be dead [2x]

No way! Hey!!!
If you want to tattoo a code on my skin. Hey!
And I shall never be afraid a doomsday. Hey!
Can't call it evolution when I see my way of life. Can I change all that?
No way! Hey!!!
If you want to tattoo a code on my skin. Hey!
And I shall never be afraid a doomsday. Hey!
Can't call it evolution when I see my way of life, my way of life!

Now I come and tell if you want to survive, you have to change if you want to survive, you have to change, if you want to survive you have to change, if you want to survive.

I'll be saved... you'll be saved
I'll be dead... you'll be dead [2x]

No way! Hey!!!
If you want to tattoo a code on my skin. Hey!
And I shall never be afraid a doomsday. Hey!
Can't call it evolution when I see my way of life. Can I change all that?
No way! Hey!!!
If you want to tattoo a code on my skin. Hey!
And I shall never be afraid a doomsday. Hey!
Can't call it evolution when I see my way of life, my way of life!

Yes you can try, you can try, to make me your prisoner
You can play the fool, you can play the boss, anyway I am the joker.
Cause I don't respect your rules and I don't respect your game.
And I spit in your face and I will spit on your grave!

No way! Hey!!!
If you want to tattoo a code on my skin. Hey!
And I shall never be afraid a doomsday. Hey!
Can't call it evolution when I see my way of life, my way of life!

Now I come and tell if you want to survive, you have to change if you want to survive, you have to change, if you want to survive you have to change, if you want to...

I'll be saved... you'll be saved
I'll be dead... you'll be dead [2x]
