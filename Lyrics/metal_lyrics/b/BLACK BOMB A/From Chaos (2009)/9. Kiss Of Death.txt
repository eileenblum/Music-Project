Come on my friends and let's go motherfucking insane!
Right now!
Don't believe in fate.
Hey!
The poison's our veins.
Hey!
For peace it's to late.
Hey!
Our brain is a weapon.
Our brain is a weapon
Who wants to taste the kiss of Death.
My sound is as sharp as a blade.
My words are shields.
Ready to fight, ready to die.

We've got no prayers to protect us from the enemies.
We've got the faith which doesn't come from heaven.
We've got no mission in the name of god but want to live.
We've got the dream to one day be free people. [2x]

Right now!
The scars on our words.
Hey!
Will die for the life.
Hey!
Feel the beast inside us.
Hey!
Our voices in your head, our voices in your head.
Our voices in your head
Who wants to taste the kiss of Death.
Together hold out hands towards the sky to catch scars.
Forever to leave earth! Forever to leave earth!

We've got no prayers to protect us from the enemies.
We've got the faith which doesn't come from heaven.
We've got no mission in the name of god but want to live.
We've got the dream to one day be free people. [2x]

To share the test of friendship.
To share the test makes the friendship stronger. [2x]

Use your brain.
To knock with this words.
Use your brain.
To taste the kiss of Death. [2x]

All right for that! [8x]
Don't be afraid of being yourself
And to take time to enjoy.
Don't be afraid of your senses.
Try to live and accept! [6x]
Don't be afraid of being yourself
And to take time to enjoy.
Don't be afraid of your senses.
Listen your body and your heart.

Use your brain.
To knock with his words.
Use your brain.
To taste the kiss of Death [4x]
To taste the kiss of Death [8x]
