You don't respect anything and never keep your word, you are exactly what I don't like
You are playing a role, you can go back to school because I won't believe you this time
You don't really know what friendship's about, you are a threat, at anytime
I'll have nothing to do with someone like you, don't wanna see you anymore by my side

There's no virtue in your behaviour, there's no sense in your life
I can see your deal, there's nothing real, you could sell your mum and dad
Do you want to fuck me bitch?! Do you want to fuck me bitch?! Do you want to fuck me bitch?! Do not lie!
But you won't screw me, because I can see, the truth between your lies

I can't stand your state of mind
I can't stand you
I can't feel no truth inside
I can't stand you

Hey, get out of my way
Get out of my way
Get out of my way
Get the fuck out of my way! [2x]

Hey, get out of my way
Get out of my way
Get out of my way
Get the fuck out of my way! [2x]

Hey you! Go away! You! Go away! You! Go away! Go! Away! Away! Away!
Hey you! Go away! You! Go away! You! Go away! Go! Away! Away! Away!

What can I say to you, now? What can I say? [2x]
What can I say to you, now? What can I say?
That makes me sad, that makes me sad, that makes me sad, I am sad... [2x]

I feel the pain, I feel the pain
I feel the hate, I feel the hate
And now it's growing insane!
Fuck you!
Motherfucker! Motherfucker!
Just go to hell! Just go to hell!
And then I will feel better

I can't stand your state of mind
I can't stand you
I can't feel no truth inside
I can't stand you

Hey, get out of my way
Get out of my way
Get out of my way
Get the fuck out of my way! [2x]

Hey you! Go away! You! Go away! You! Go away! Go! Away! Away! Away!
Hey you! Go away! You! Go away! You! Go away! Go! Away! Away! Away!
Hey, get out of my way
Get out of my way
Get out of my way
Get the fuck out of my way! [3x]

Hey, get out of my way
Get out of my way
Get out of my way!!!
