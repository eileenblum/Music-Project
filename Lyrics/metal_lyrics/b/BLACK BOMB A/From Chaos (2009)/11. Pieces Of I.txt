I look at the stars to find my way on the ground
I hear the voices and I hear, I hear the sounds
I've learnt thousand times from the wind's stories
I know myself, I know my enemies

I don't believe, don't believe in what it has to be
I'll be my own writer of my tragedy
I am the only disciple of my philosophy
That's my choice, that's my choice!

I'm alone inside my universe
That's the price to build myself by myself
With my own mind and with my own hands
I know it will be my strife until the end

Everything is in my hands, oh I know
Everything is in my head, yeah!
Everything is in my hands, oh I know
Everything is in my head, it's in my head!
I control the Elements! [4x]

I prefer to keep the questions to the answers
I forgot my name and I forgot my number
I wanna always be a passenger
While travelling in my thoughts forever

I don't believe, don't believe in what it has to be
I'll be my own writer of my tragedy
I am the only disciple of my philosophy
That's my choice, that's my choice!

I'm alone inside my universe
That's the price to build myself by myself
With my own mind and with my own hands
I know it will be my strife until the end

I am losing control, I'm losing control
I am losing control, I'm losing control
I am losing control, I'm losing control yeah! [2x]

I thought I could, I could overcome this
I thought I could, I could overcome this
I thought I could, I could overcome this
I thought I could, yeah, I thought I could

No! Not! Now!
The Elements!
Fury!
Of the Elements!
No! Not! Now!
The Elements!
I can feel the fury!
Of the Elements!

I cannot control! The Elements! No!
Fury! Of the Elements! [2x]

Everything is in my hands, oh I know
Everything is in my head, yeah!
Everything is in my hands, oh I know
Everything is in my head, it's in my head!

I am losing control, I'm losing control
I am losing control, I'm losing control
I am losing control, I'm losing control yeah!

I cannot control the reactions! I cannot control the evolution!
For this part of my experiences, I think I have gone too far! [2x]

Everything is in my hands! And everything is in my head!
If I have set it on fire then that's the way I'm gonna die!
Everything's burning in my hands and everything's burning in my head!
I will explode in one moment, hope you'll find some pieces of I!!!
