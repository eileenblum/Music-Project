No!!!
This love is mine!
Day after day I feel I'm going crazy
It's time to break up don't you realize!
But I feel for these painful words I've said
Sorry for the tears in your eyes!

I'm digging, I'm digging the grave for our dying story babe
I'm digging, I'm digging my grave, if you won't fall don't stay! [2x]

I'm going away! I'm going away! It's time for!
Now!
Going away! Just going away! I'll leave this mess
Now!
I'm going away! I'm going away! It's time for!
Now!
Going away! Just going away!

Ever on the road, my road.
Carry off my heart, my home

This love is mine!

By! The! Way! Time to learn a lesson!
By! The! Way! Time to learn a lesson!

Everywhere I go, I can see your face, I cannot forget, time to learn a lesson! [2x]

I can see your face, in every flame!
I cannot forget, and I am to blame!
I can see your face, in every flame!
I cannot forget, and I feel the shame!

I'm going away! I'm going away! It's time for!
Now!
Going away! Just going away! I'll leave this mess
Now!
I'm going away! I'm going away! It's time for!
Now!
Going away! Just going away!

Ever on the road, my road.
Carry off my heart, my home
Take care of yourself, alone.
Can't forget your face my love

My love! [8x]

We were together, that time's gone
Gone forever and things are done
I still remember waking the dawn
When it comes as ever, I feel reborn
We were together, that time's gone
Gone forever and things are done
I still remember waking the dawn
We'll back together when the time will come [2x]

We were together, that time's gone
Gone forever and things are done
I still remember waking the dawn
When it comes as ever, I feel reborn
