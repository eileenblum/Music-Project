I've seen oxygen mask pollution and despair
The forest and the faun are dying everywhere
Endangered species are increasing every year
Now we have to change our minds!
We are killing the Earth, we are killing the future
We don't learn from the past, nor learn from mother nature
But if we are the poison, what will be the cure?
Now we have to change our minds!

We don't have time to breath
We don't have time to break
We don' have time to think
What does it mean? What does it mean!
What's going wrong with the human race?
It's smell like shit and it has the taste
We're dancing on our graves
We call it Earth!

We don't respect life but we respect money
We're screaming "Freedom!" but we're afraid to be free
We are pretentious, we, masters of barbary
Now we have to change our minds!
I've seen exploitation, fanaticism and poverty
I've seen fascism, war, violence and cruelty
And the entire world is in a state of emergency
Now we have to change our minds!
Let's go it's time to change!

Come on what do you say?! I wanna hear you!
Come on what do you say?! I wanna hear you!
Come on what do you say?! I wanna hear you!
Save the Earth! Come on! Save the Earth! Come on! [2x]

Oh
Why don't we change our way
Take time to think about this world
Why don't we change our way

I say Oh
Why don't we change our way
Take time to think about this world
Why don't we change our way [2x]

I say Oh
Why don't we change our way
Take time to think about this world
We consume the others just to feed all our needs
But our needs make no sense they are crazy indeed
And make us pathetic fools of a dying breed
Now we have to change our minds!
We have to change ourselves if we wanna change the world
Politics does nothing, we can do something on our own
And maybe for our children, better days will come
Now we have to change our minds!

We don't have time to breath
We don't have time to break
We don' have time to think
What does it mean? What does it mean!
What's going wrong with the human race?
It's smell like shit and it has the taste
We're dancing on our graves
We call it Earth!

Now we have to change this world! [3x]
If we can change our mind it's possible to change our world!

Change your mind, change your life, change or die, change the world yeah!!!

I say Oh
Why don't we change our way
Take time to think about this world
Why don't we change our way [4x]

We can do things on our own
Why don't we change our way [3x]

Why don't we change our way
Take time to think about this world
Why don't we change our way [2x]

We can do things on our own
Why don't we change our way [4x]

Why don't we change our way
Take time to think about this world
Why don't we change our way [2x]

We can do things on our own
Why don't we change our way [4x]

Why don't we change our way
Take time to think about this world
