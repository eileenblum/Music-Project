We try, we swear to fight before the end comes
When we took what you gave us blindly, never again!
Now we return the blows stronger than the children we were

1994 we were against the system
Spitting one's hate on beat, mainlining my veins
Fucking, getting stoned, playing rock'n'roll
Who can say that? We can say that!
We open our hearts to let the pain out
Changing this pain to embrace the wisdom
When we give ourselves to develop things
Who can say that? We can say that!

We don't have nothing to learn from you
Since the beginning we've fucked your rules
So we don't have nothing to learn from you
We still believe in Anarchy
And we don't obey anymore, just driven by this voice inside of us
And reject laws coming from heaven
No gods no masters
We still believe in Anarchy

A time to search deep inside of me
A war to choose who I have to be
A man who screams "I wanna be free! I wanna be free! I wanna be free!" [2x]

We try, we swear to fight before the end comes
Our faith is intact
We believe and we're free

All the way!!!

War on stage, war inside of us until death
Eyes in eyes, no lies, everything is real
And we keep the respect of those who love us
Who can say that? We can say that!
We fight for the weak and we don't want your money
Always with you when the others grow tired
No regrets because we choose all the way
Who can say that? We can say that!

We don't have nothing to learn from you
Since the beginning we've fucked your rules
So we don't have nothing to learn from you
We still believe in Anarchy

We say, don't want, we say, don't want..... [3x]

A time to search deep inside of me
A war to choose who I have to be
A man who screams "I wanna be free! I wanna be free! I wanna be free!" [2x]

We try, we swear to fight before the end comes
Our faith is intact
We believe and we're free

Awake! Awake! by the hardship of the way
Insane! Insane! don't forget all the way
To fight! To fight! fight before the ends comes, fight before the ends comes, fight before the ends comes [2x]

All the way!!!
