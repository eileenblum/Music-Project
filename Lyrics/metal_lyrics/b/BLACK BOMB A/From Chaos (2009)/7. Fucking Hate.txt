Come on!!!
To want to kill them of different coloured skin or opposing opinions
A loss of control that persist
Come and save us!!!
Yesterday two planes took out the towers
Torture in camps for revenge
The world is about to explode
Come and save us!!!

Walls of anger
Rivers of blood
What do you want?
The pleasure of death
Wind of terror
Tears of suffering
What do you want?
To reign on earth
So free your mind
Lose your fear
Why do you flee?
Nothing is easy
Stop to fight
And see the light
Why do you wait?
Live without hate

Wooooooooooooooo fucking hateeeeeeeeeee!!!! [2x]

Bruised by the knocks of the policemen
The justice in my mind, my fists follow my laws
Bodies made for loving make war
Come and save us!!!
Stop hating and fight for love
Give to receive and don't steal from the poor
Which one of us begins the first
Come and save us!!!

Walls of anger
Rivers of blood
What do you want?
The pleasure of death
Wind of terror
Tears of suffering
What do you want?
To reign on earth
So free your mind
Lose your fear
Why do you flee?
Nothing is easy
Stop to fight
And see the light
Why do you wait?
Live without hate

Wooooooooooooooo fucking hateeeeeeeeeee!!!! [2x]

And I dream about a world without anger and without hate [2x]
And I dream [2x]
On and on I decide to be good for to be free
But I'm a weak man who can never change

One day men will live and will walk hand in hand [3x]
Destroying, killing, hating the world is about to explode! [6x]
On and on, on and on, on and on love against hate [2x]
On and on, Love and Hate...
