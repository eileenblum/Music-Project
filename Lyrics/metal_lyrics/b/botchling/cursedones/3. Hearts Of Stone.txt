Whispering to myself "just continue to breath" as I wander through my mind into anxieties, my insides crafted with razor wires that constricts, I can't be with you I can't be fixed.

I fled your temple and ran through the night even then I was so sure that you possibly might;

Not be faithful and I'll take the risk of being alone, than dwelling forever in your temple of stone.

I fled your temple and ran through the night, even then I was so sure that you possibly might; not be faithful and I have left you far from home but please don't ever leave me alone.

I'll hold onto bitterness and never let you see, a fraction of the man I am and who I choose to be.

I, I've been out of my mind and I fear to face the day in which I'm all that that I despise, what is love without trust, what is love if you take the trust away?

I, I've been out of my mind and I fear to face the day in which I'm all that that I despise, what is love without trust, what is love if you take the trust away?

I'll hold onto bitterness and never let you see, a fraction of the man I am and who I choose to be

My heart can't take this anymore.
This feeling inside my chest; it never fades away.
I know, I cannot be with you as long as this sensation continues to haunt me.
This sense of uncertainty will never set me free.
You're best to just leave me be.

I, I've been out of my mind and I fear to face the day in which I'm all that that I despise, what is love without trust, what is love if you take the trust away.

I, I've been out of my mind and I fear to face the day in which I'm all that that I am all that I despise, what is love without trust, what is love if you take the trust away.

Tell me do you see any way, that the sharpness in my chest fades away.
Tell me what do I say; to let you know that I'm not OK.
