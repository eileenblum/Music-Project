What do people like you exist for
Hives of scum benefiting from the poor.
What is the point of morality when no one believes in common decency.
You celebrate democracy, electing people whose business is your tragedy.
What is the point of being free when no one believes in common decency.
We live in the wake of Orwell's fantasy, electing our own tragedy.

Our taxes go to wars we don't care for,
While we bleached the coral reefs raw,
We live in the age of information,
Regretting to look at our situation.

What do people like you exist for?
Hives of scum benefiting from the poor.

What is the point of morality when no one believes in common decency.
You celebrate democracy,
Electing people whose business is your tragedy, electing people whose business is your tragedy, electing our own tragedy, we live in wake of Orwells fantasy.

Our taxes go to wars we don't care for,
While we bleached the coral reefs raw,
We live in the age of information,
Regretting to look at our situation.

Renowned to all the lands
For those who've come across the seas
We've boundless plains we will not share;
With a lack of courage let us all combine
To advance this land of disrepair

We've entered the time where
War is peace
Freedom is slavery
Ignorance is strength

What do people like you exist for?
Hives of scum benefiting from the poor.

What is the point of morality when no one believes in common decency.
You celebrate democracy,
Electing people whose business is your tragedy,
Electing people whose business is your tragedy,
Electing our own tragedy,
We live in wake of Orwells fantasy.

Our taxes go to wars we don't care for,
While we bleached the coral reefs raw,
We live in the age of information,
Regretting to look at our situation.
