With my heart pounding deep in my chest, I'm holding it together but I feel the unrest, I see your fear tonight and I know it isn't right but I will consume, I need to feel control

I'm biting through my own flesh, the change begins; I am loathing, I am weakness, I am the one, struggling to hold on.

I can feel the world dispute my worth, I can hear them all say that I will fall, a sinister spreading virus that tells the fact that I'm not free, invoking little fear in you but bringing out the beast in me,

My heart has pounded right through my chest, I can't hold it together, where can I get rest, your fear is mine tonight and I know it isn't right but I will consume, I have felt control.

The moon moves through the sky, the change begins; I am loathing, I am fiction, I am the one, struggling to hold on.

I can feel the world dispute my worth, I can hear them say that I will fall, a sinister spreading virus that tells the fact that I'm not free, invoking little fear in you, bringing out the beast in me.

My heart has pounded right through my chest, I can't hold it together, where can I get rest, I see your fear tonight and I know it isn't right

The moon moves through the sky, the search begins, I can't hold it together, I am unrest, I am not here tonight and I know that's it'll never be right, it'll never be the way it was before.
