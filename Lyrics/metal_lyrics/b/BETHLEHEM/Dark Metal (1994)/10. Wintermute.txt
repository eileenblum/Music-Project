[Music: Matton/Bartsch, December '92]
[Lyrics: Bartsch, November '92]

Produced from the maelstrom of neglection
My nocturnal prayer died away in the unreality of a never-ending happiness
"My prayer...?"
"Died away in eternity!"

If there's live before death
It's not for me
Who spreads his dark cold pinion
Over the eternal silence
Of a gnawed frosty winter landscape
"My prayer...?"
"Died away in eternity!"

The answer of the mystery
Which is put into my hands
Is the unholy property of a longest forgotten insufficiency
Which built on rusty pillars
Indulges in sensuality to the morbid repulsiveness of ruin
"And what moves there in the shadow?"
"It's your image!"
"Who calls there in the mirror?"
"It's your comprehension!"

Unrestlessness whispering appearances
Shatter the frail ear
Which escapes with the folly of an unconcerned remonstration
Up through black dirt into the light

"Es ist eine unkonventionelle Mischung kompakter und flÃ¼ssiger Metal-Riffs, schneller, instinktiver Strukturen und apokalyptischer Melodien, zutiefst negativ und deprimierend. All das wird mit herzzerreissenden Schreien und knurrenden Vocals geziert. Ich will aber klarstellen, daÃ uns die Vergleiche mit Doom-Gruppen oder so'm ScheiÃ auf die Eier gehen: Wir spielen Dark Metal und basta!"

"It is a more compact unconventional mixture and flowing metal-riffs, faster, more instinctive structures and apocalyptic Melodies, deeply, negative and depressive. All that is fused together with heart-rendering screams and growling vocals. I will make it clear that our comparisons with Doom Groups or some shit goes like this: We play Dark Metal and that is that!"

Thanks to m_sauron for sending track #5 lyrics.
