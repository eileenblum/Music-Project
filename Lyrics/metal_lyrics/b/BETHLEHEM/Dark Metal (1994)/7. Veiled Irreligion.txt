[Music by Matton November '92]
[Poems by Bartsch October '92]

Desire's my saying
Final's my appearance
Care-worn's my glance
Apathetic's my devotion

through yearning rises
out of deep dark chasm
up to deceased brightness
with the original power of life

a black feathered bird
trips softly in the surge
a last sunbeam illuminates
in a bleeden darkness
