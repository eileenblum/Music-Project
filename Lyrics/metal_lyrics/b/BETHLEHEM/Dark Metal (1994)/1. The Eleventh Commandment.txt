[Music by Bartsch/Matton January '93]
[Poems by Bartsch December '92]

When the dark lord told me to live
I felt the raised lust of possession

afterwards the death yell of an impaled nineye
gotten through my dutiful ears

I had to think of all the lost creatures
which strived of their existence
in the streaming of my black blood

nocturnal shadows, which glorified
the resurrection like trumpets
offered me the right way into hopelessness
enlighten my path into inaccessible license
