[Music: Bartsch/Matton '92]
[Lyrics: Classen, May '92]

Welcome to the slaughter
Bleeding bodies lying on the floor
Destructed corpses on the ground
And death stands behind the doors

Bestial saviour of the undead legions arise
And the unholy resurrection of evil omen
Of the black priest, the seven satanic rituals

Lucifer's vengeance is here
Sons of Satan born in a fire
And your fucking death is clear

The slaughterhouse in evil hell
The Christs are in never ending endless pain
In the land where Satan fell
And the evil demons rang the Sabbath bell.
