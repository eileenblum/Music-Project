[Okay, this isn't really a song, except they put 2:04 of "Wo Adlers Wagen"]
[in  the  background (which sounds really fucking cool) while some talking goes]
[on, here's basically what's going on.]

[I wish they would have put the entire song of "Wo Adlers Wagen" on there,]
[but  due  to  some  controversial  issues,  the song never made it onto the Cd]
[(except this excerpt of course).]

[At  the  beginning  there's two guys smoking a joint and talking, I'm not]
[100%  sure  of what they're talking about because they're speaking too quietly]
[and  Landerfermann's  on vocals in the background. So all of a sudden you hear]
[someone  knocking  on  the  door and eventually he breaks in. Now the two guys]
[turn  out  to  be drug dealers because the guy who broke in is asking for some]
[dope  for  free.  So one of the guys says "Don't you have something?" and then]
[the  guy  who broke in keeps saying "Come on... Come ON, COME ON!" begging for]
[it.  And  the  dealer  says "No money, no drugs." And then they get into a big]
[arguement  and  the  guy who broke in kept yelling "GO AWAY! GO AWAY" and then]
[he kicked them out.]

Released in 1998 on Red Stream records.
