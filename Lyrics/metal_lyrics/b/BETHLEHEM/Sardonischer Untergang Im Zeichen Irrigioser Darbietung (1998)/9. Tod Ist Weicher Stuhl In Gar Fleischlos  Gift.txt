""Sardonischer  Untergang  Im  Zeichen  IrreligiÃ¶ser  Darbietung"  is  an
extremely  positive  and  optimistic  view.  "Untergang"  (ruin) is similar to
decline,  destruction,  etc...  but  unseparable  to  things like newborn, new
establishment,  newness  and stuff. Destruction always is newness. There never
will be a beginning and an end. This means mutation or change which is life in
general. The diaphane mystery: Life and the generally seen universe is change.
Such  a  ruin  definitely  is  "sardonisch" (sardonic), humourous in a special
sense,  like  Death who day by day awaits us round the corner. In Tarot, Death
has the card XIII which means change too. "Im Zeichen IrreligiÃ¶ser Darbietung"
(in  the  sign  of  irreligious performance) is part of the motive power. It's
what  Nihilism  says  about  strength... Nihilism as itself specially develops
as  a  giantic failure and loss of the conception of the world which seemed to
be  true.  Therefore,  the  imagination  develops  that  nothing  is true. The
revolutionary  change  strats.  The  musical  kind  of Performance is the most
suitable  thing  to  offer  ones  own  views, the more it writes upon the path
between  Order  and  Chaos,  because  life  staggers  between Order and Chaos.
Therefore, the end of the title returns back to the starting point."
