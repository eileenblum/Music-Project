[Music: Matton, September '92]
[Lyrics: Bartsch, August '92]

The shriek blockaded machinery
Tears me away in this very moment
Deep dark night embraces me like a casket
Black rain cauterizes the protecting surface

It's not only one which fulfills me with fear
There are lots of like a mask
For each situation another countenance
Like cadaverous fire it overcasts my being

I can't see the course any longer
Death is no expectation
Truth is broken in mediocrity
And in there repeatedly rituals

I got the crushing perception
Of my own insignificance

The marmoraccon angel
Offers me an occult smile
But I only see the mourning
And the dissociation in it's eyes

It's not the religion which delivers me
Like a ship in the deep black sea
It's the animalistic abyss
A really flowing stream perverted desire

I could show my paradise
But you won't understand
I could snatch the blindness away from you
And you would perish with me
