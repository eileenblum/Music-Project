Christus, du blasse KÃ¶nigin des geronnenen
Blutregens
ersticke an der Allmacht meines todbringenden
VermÃ¤chtnisses
welches zu Sensen geformt
der Auferstehung letzter Hand sein wird.

Begraben in der erlauchten AusdÃ¼nstung von
Gier &amp; SÃ¼hne
erliegt mein Schrecken des dritten Kreuzes
der sÃ¼Ãen Verlockung eines unsauber
schmeckenden
Grableinens

Blut
Oh Du, mein unsauber' Fleisch
vergilbe im Jetzt
tÃ¶te das Morgen
VerheiÃung letzter Moloch
dem Grabe zugefÃ¼hrt
vergib mir meine BlÃ¶Ãe

Blut
Heuchler im Ich
geboren aus Zerfall
aus der Anarchie
aus totem Fleisch

ErlÃ¶sung
vergib mir meinen Schrein
vergib mir meine Seele

SchwÃ¤rze
die verbotenen Zeilen
und immer nur der Tod
der ungestillte Durst
der kupferne Geruch
das berstende Inferno
doch wo bleibe ich
bleibt die JungfrÃ¤ulichkeit
bleibt der Glaube
an die sich windende Flamme
meiner animalischen Blasphemie

Blut
du geschwÃ¤rtze Hoffnung
meines jÃ¼ngsten Gerichts
das sterbende Ich
geborgen in blutbeflecktem Tuch
geborgen in gar ewig' Ruh'

Verloren
gar ewiglich verloren
schreite in deinen Tod

denn wisse,
wo die Dunkelheit herrscht
bin ICH.

[English translation: Thorn Of My Omnipotence]

Christ, thou pale queen of the clotted bloodrain
Suffocate in the omnipotence of my
death-bringing
heritage
that, shaped like a scythe,
will be the last hand to the resurrection

Buried in the noble evaporation of greed and
penance
My horror of the third cross yields
to the sweet temptation of an unpure tasting
little grave

Blood
Oh thou, my unpure flesh
turn yellow in the present
kill the tomorrow
promise of the last dwelling
brought to the grave
forgive my nakedness

Blood
Hypocrite in me
born of decay
of anarchy
of dead flesh

Deliverance
forgive me my shrine
forgive me my soul

Blackness
The forbidden lines
and always only death
the unquenched thirst
the copper scent
the bursting inferno
yet where will I be
will be the virginity
will be the faith
of the writhing flame
of my bestial blasphemy

Blood
thou blackened hope
of my final judgement
the dying me
secured in a bloodstained cloth
secured in very eternal peace

Lost
eternally lost
stride into your death

For know,
where darkness reigns,
I am.

"Honestly,  if  all  these things would have never happened in the past I
doubt  a  band  such as Bethlehem would ever exist. Those suicide/death events
base on things that happened in MATTON's and my own past. MATTON's father died
by  hanging  himself  &amp; shortly after his mother died of cancer. Myself I lost
all  my former friends and dudes due to suicide. My pregnant girlfriend hanged
herself  and  the  only thing I could do was cutting the clothes-line she used
for  the  suicide.  Ten of my best friends and dudes followed in two years and
this  made  me  a complete drug-addict and nervous wreck. I spent lotsa energy
getting  back to the light but all these things still engage MATTON and myself
and  the  very best thing about "talking" about this all is Bethlehem and it's
possibility  to  channel  negative  and horrible experiences of a former life.
That's  why  we dedicated "Dictius Te Necare" to all suicide victims, it shall
be nothing but a bulwark against forgetfulness."
