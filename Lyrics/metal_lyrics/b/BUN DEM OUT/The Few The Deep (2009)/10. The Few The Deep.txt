This blood runs deep it numbers few, mi familia is my krutch bless on all BFLBU
I like the pain I like the misery I like this world!!!!!
THE FEW THE DEEP

Cant forget the struggle cos we in it too deep
Wont forget the streets where many souljahs rest in peace
Stand bold with true passion we wont sellout
Music is our weapon for our people we must shout

Bad minds want turn it into battlefield
But we strive to keep the music real
Still fools running there mouth! and end up getting run in the ground!

When will they realise allow corruption and those fucking lies focus on
Building real bonds and ties

To reduce many mums screams and cries more sons and innocents die
Look deep there's more to life

Step back and ask the question
With confusion inside of your mind do you really want die this way?!

FOOLS

BUN DEM OUT IS DOWN FOR LIFE

Este mundo is getting smaller
Los demonios are getting stronger
And there's nowhere left to hide
Bun dem all for dirty bad minds

We burn them.
