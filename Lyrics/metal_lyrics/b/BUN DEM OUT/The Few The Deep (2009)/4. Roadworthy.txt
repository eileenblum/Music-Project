Too much steep roads all forged in deceit
Dirty blood stained history fool only want to repeat
Deceived by those who claim to answer all prayers
When we need and call for them no one ever hears

No way no answer just lies
Clarity clouds deceit I see its me you despise

For all the years and souls lost and wasted
For every falls victory you claim to have tasted
We vowed to stand apart
A strike from my soul and deep from my heart
I want leave you so cold with lacerated marks
The same way you treat us from back in the start

FIRE 'pon the demons
FIRE 'pon all frienemy

Your hollowed feelings and borrowed meanings
Underhanded tactics and sly deceiving
Don't reign round here anymore
New blood souljah's ready for war!

Distract and leave disillusion
Offer connection but never true union
Living lies for far too long
Same played out sad old song
About reaching for a touch of dreams end up crushing them all or so it seems

You cant see through my eyes demon
I can see through your lies frienemy

May not be right it may not be wrong
But these are the words I set too song
Your twisted, and lie to hide the fact
Look everything you despise in the mirror reflects back!
