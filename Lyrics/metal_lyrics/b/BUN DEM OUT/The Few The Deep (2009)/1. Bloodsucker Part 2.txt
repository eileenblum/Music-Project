The price of greed is the world you swallow, engulfed by war famine and sorrow
Its still a bloodstained path you follow sucking the world dry and eating it
Hollow

Can you hear the echo
Hells still calling your name

Hell has not forgotten
The lives that you've claimed

Pain is calling
Hate is calling
Death is calling you

The greed and the fake
Take no time to hesitate
The destruction and corruption
Of innocents through world wars
