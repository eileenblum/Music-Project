I tried to warn you one day this way of life would see you fall
And this world would leave you for dead

And no amount of begging or bleeding come kicking or screaming will find you a
Place in my heard

Death is creeping in the shadows waiting
Weigh me down no more
I'm tearing out all of my pain
To put it back where it belongs

In you.

Your tears could flood this earth and I would drown in them laughing
From this day forward a slave to the curse
Cos my hatred is forever

I'm taking it back no you cant have it
This world is mine
You fucking try to stop me!
