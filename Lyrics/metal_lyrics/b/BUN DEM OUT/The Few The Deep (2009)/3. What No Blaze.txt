Perucho soy
End londres vivo oi
Nunca denemos este problema
Quando la hierba no crese mas

Over here happens once a year
Round carnival time its all the same
No ones got nothing to shot
There's no smell of blaze

Po droughts come and mans get vex
Streets are heated too much stress
Police are busy closing shops
While kids still getting stabbed or shot

Yo te amo peru (viva peru!)
Cos you keep the blaze true
If my ends get too dry
Its too you I will fly!
