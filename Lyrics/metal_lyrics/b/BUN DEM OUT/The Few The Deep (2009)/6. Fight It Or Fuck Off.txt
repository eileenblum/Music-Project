To all the poser's looky-lou's and the fake arse wannabe's
Take your fake smiles tales and sympathy ploys
Lace them taste them fuck it swallow them
Along with the feet in your fat pie hole

What gives you the right to be so thick
True souljahs nah get that privilege
So easy to pretend but in the end
You've gotta learn to be true
Cause we see through you like the bottle that's gonna shatter for true!

Grow up, see reality figure out what your missing
Respect is a two way street truth comes from within

What is your new self proclaimed excuse ?
Nah fuck it who gives a shit
About the childish slurs there's no excuse
For the abuse that you spit
LBU don't give a shit!

If you fight it
If you breathe it
If you live it
It is yours
LBU FOR LIFE STRAIGHT
