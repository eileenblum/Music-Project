A force beyond comprehension
Upon us now
Pure evil unstoppable
Here to decimate

No good you'll find here, none
Burns your eye to see
Your destiny, comes to be
Through me

Are time has come to an
End and you will not repent
For there is no time for
Your god to save you... now

Armageddon they'll call me
Nothing further from the truth
Your pathetic race
Has no word to describe me

An entity above all else
Only impure thought
Your destiny, comes to be
Through me

Are time has come to an
End and you will not repent
For there is no time for
Your god to save you... now

I am the one you should fear
I am the bringer of tears
I crush your world with a thought
I make you bleed till you drop
I...

I am the end...
