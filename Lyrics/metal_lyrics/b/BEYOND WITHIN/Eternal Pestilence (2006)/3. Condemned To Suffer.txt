This feeling overwhelming me
Had taken over my mind
But now it has left
Just as quickly as it came

My will was broken
And all my love had turned to hate
Not onto you but to this world
Which will never be the same

Empty and alone
My soul becomes much stronger
Test my will you cannot break me

Brought to your knees I strike you down
Nothing can change my mind
And through the hate I still feel the loss

My love, Became, My hate
My love, Hidden now, I walk alone

Darkness becomes my home
The only light in my eyes
The fire that burns deep
From within my soul

I did everything I could
But it was never enough
And though I could never betray
We both know what it was

This power that I feel inside
Am I in control?
Or am I just a slave
Just another pawn

I try to forget all of that
And just think of you
Everything cycles back
My endless torture
