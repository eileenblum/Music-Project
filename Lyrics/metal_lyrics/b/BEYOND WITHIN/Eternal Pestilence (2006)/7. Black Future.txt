Trying to contemplate an end
And see a path that leads to it
Question the will to choose

Is that which we do ours to decide?
Or does the past predict the final outcome

Are we ever really free?
The events precedently
Affect the subsequent
There is no change to the infinite

Fate is determined
Free will is an illusion
Nothing you say or do
Has ever been created by you

I see the future and all I see is black

The sands of time have been prescribed
By that which remains unknown
Your future turns to stone

The writing cannot be erased
The past is final no saving grace
Your will be done mechanically

No point to life its all a mistake, continue with no end

Suffering or bliss
Irrelevant is this
Pay the perfect price
Free will for all time

I see the future and all I see is black
Black as the night
Never ending life
Black Future
