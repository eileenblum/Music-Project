In the day I fear the light
Afraid of the dark in the dead of night
No where to hide, no place is safe
Except here where I stand, inside myself

I wound myself again in my search
My blood a path for you to follow
Through the gates of Attrition
Repentance, I feel so hollow

Come with me I need you here
By my side the lonely and sorrow
Through the gate of attrition
Apathy, we may be gone tomorrow

My screams are never loud enough
Not to drown you in my sea of confusion
Despite all the hate and hypocrisy
Your insignificant, your nothing to me
