Go to war
Fight for peace
Politics fail
History repeats

Innocents dies
Underlying greed
Who pulls the strings?
On violence it feeds

The machines destroy freedom
March on battlefields without reason

Mankind's history soaked with bloodshed
Kingdoms rise and fall from the stench of the dead
Human nature is violent at its core
Destined to destroy ourselves we go to war

The noose is
Around your
Fragile neck

Parallel
Comparison
To how our world is a wreck

Fix the scope
On tyrants
And watch them scatter

Evil, greedy
Money, lust
The power chain is shattered

Lives of the poor burned on the pyres
March on battlefields for all the liars

We will fight
Forever
We will fight
Forevermore
We will fight
Destined to destroy
