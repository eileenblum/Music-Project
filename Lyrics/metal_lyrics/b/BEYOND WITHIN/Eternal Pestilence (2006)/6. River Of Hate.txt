When you've lost it all and you
Can see that there's no turning back
All alone curse this life try you might
But you can never have it back

Waiting in line to cross
The five rivers to hell
Caught in the glare of Charon
His lifeless finger points to me

You may not pass
Unless you pay the obol
Wander through life
The underworld one hundred years

Sorrow and dismay
River of woe
Grief and regret
Lamentation

Wander through life without purpose
Like I wander through the underworld
I did not pay the toll
And posses not a golden bough

Alone with the sorrow
Consumed of the flame
Will my journey ever come to an end?
The five rivers behind me

Burns but does not consume
River of fire
Forget your past life
Oblivion

Acheron, Cocytus, Phlegethon, Lethe, Styx

The river of hate
The river Styx
The river of hate
The river Styx

Now at the gates of hell
You alone will find what lies ahead
