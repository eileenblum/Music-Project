No fractures
Not a single scar
No affliction
Nothing to be seen
On the surface
My appearance
Conceals and distorts
If youâd only known
Where I have been
To feel
To be unbroken
To live again
In desolation
Processing abjection
Hurt and despair
State of acceptance
Acknowledged imperfection
Been torn asunder
Misplaced deliverance
To feel
To be unbroken
To live again
To heal
To be unbroken
To live again
