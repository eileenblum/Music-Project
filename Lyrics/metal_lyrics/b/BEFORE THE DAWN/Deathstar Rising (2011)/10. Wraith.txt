The scythe of death
And the hounds of hell were sent
To claim my life
At the gates of hades
No one dares to call my name
Living wraith without a soul
So death canât find me here
From this fate release me
End my days and set me free
The sole survivor of
Encounter with the grim reaper
I am immortal
At the gates of heaven
No one dares to call my name
For them a wretched demon
Amongst divine angels
Eternal rest awaits for the wicked one
And the hordes of hell
Are yet to confront
They worst enemy


Thanks to porgos for correcting track #6 lyrics.
