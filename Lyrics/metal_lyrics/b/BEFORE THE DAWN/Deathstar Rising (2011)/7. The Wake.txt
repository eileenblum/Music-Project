I reject the world around me
I decline this domain
I resign the mankind
With a misanthropic vein
I foresee the flames of the end
Ablazed on fire, ashes of the wake to come
Will soon blacken the sun above
This deathlike silence
Is the faint voice of defiance
Horde of the half-hearted fighters
Warriors feeble and frail
Legions that once stood proud
In front of the enemy
In battlefields of devastation
Now stand in line
For annihilation
Believe in my chosen isolation
My world of solitude is god forsaken
