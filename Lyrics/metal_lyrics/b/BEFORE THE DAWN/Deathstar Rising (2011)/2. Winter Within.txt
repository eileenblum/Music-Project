The last leaf has fallen
And the soil has turned cold
Wind whispers warnings
Death follows the approaching storm
The last pair of wings
Has fled these lands
Guided by the cold white light
Frozen rain falls
Freezing stream in my veins
The sorrow of my heart
Burden unseen
Is this winter within me
The first veil of frost
Thin ice that calms the waters
Tranquility was brought by the passing fall
The first snow has fallen
Dark woods stand silent and tall
Set on fire by the northern lights
