All befell an instant
A blink of an eye and all was gone
Devastation, its most simple form
The recent events
Some sort of destruction
Came without a warning
Revealed, unfolded the downfall
Revelation of descent
To a lower level
That I didnât know to exist
To be real
Canât define
What has caused this chain reaction
Wings of a butterfly brought the storm
To my direction
Faults to recall
Weak moments to remember
What took down my guard
Penetrated, the shields
That were built to last
All ramparts disintegrated
Revelation of descent
To lower levels
That I didnât know to exist
To be real
