Placing the events in a row
That led me to this point
Of no return, no way to go
Crossroad without directions
A dead end street
What led me to this point
Of no return, no retreat
Is this incarceration
An everlasting state
Justice of my own creation
Judgement that sealed my fate
Facing reality in a form
Of denial
I choose not to see what lies in front of me
In motion
No destination, no parole plea
Imprisonment for life
With no redemption to set me free
