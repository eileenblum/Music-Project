Behold
The re-arrangement of the skyline
Dead cold horizon
No flames rising
Witness
The disappearance of the dawn
Like rays of light
Have died
One by one
In pitch black sky
No stars to reflect the sun
After all light became undone
Darkness has come
To blacken fires of the night
Deathstar rising
Before the dusk descent
The sombre winds came with a promise of the end
We saw the solar system shut down sequence
All stars concealed and gone
One by one
