My soul grew cold
When the final fall came with the winter
Now and forevermore I walk apart from the pact
Like wolf in the frozen woodlands

In the land of thousand lakes
Frozen waters carry my weigth
And falling snow cover the traces behind

Sun went down aeons ago
And kaamos came with the wings unfold
Only cold white light from the moon to guide me

I have lost the faith in god
Abandoned belief in the morning star
I am the ruler
I am the might

I wear the crown of frost
Reign from the throne of ice
In the twilight dominion
In the realm of north
As a king I walk
