Corroded has became my sword
And weight has gathered into my shield
Nations conquered and enemies slain
Now standing weary on a blood red battlefield

Longing for a rival
Adversary worth the ichor
To gain relief

I was storming into my demise
Like Icaros towards the sun
Flames of the empyrium set me on fire
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Perpetual circle of life
Behold the golden feathers of phoenix rising

Re-forged has became my blade
And weight was lifted from my shield
Burning kingdoms
Thrones scorched and seared
Tombstones of the fallen that once was feared
