Determination chained to the ground
Like a sledge full of stones
A simple question of self discipline
Will you walk or crawl

Spine breaking load
A burden of our own to shatter the backbone
We all have a cross to bear

Define the strength of the will by endurance of the pain
Resolve and determine the reason and the cause
By forbearance of desolation

Refuse to share or separate, better buried than isolated
Dead weight is not to be divided

Resist and retaliate, defend and secure the sole fragment
Of what is sacred and pure, divine and consecrated

Define the strength of the will by endurance of the pain
Resolve and determine the reason and the cause
By forbearance of desolation
