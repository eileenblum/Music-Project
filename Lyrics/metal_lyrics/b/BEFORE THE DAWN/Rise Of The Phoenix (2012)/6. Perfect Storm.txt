In the sea
The storm has been awaken
Freezing winds cruel and fierce

Unleash the full force of the nature
Into pieces she breaks
Apart she tears

A single heart beat can break the silence
In the eye of the storm
But not even the deepest wrath of the mankind
Is equal to the chaos in a perfect form

At the shore
The waves have been rising
Sea is taking over the land
Mighty wings are summoning the thunder
Sky turns dark and the black rain starts to fall
