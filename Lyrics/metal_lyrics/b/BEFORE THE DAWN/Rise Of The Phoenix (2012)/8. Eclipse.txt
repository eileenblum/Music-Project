First light of the sun
Burning horizon and fiery sky
Is painting a silvery scene
Illuminate the ice and snow
Dead calm landscape flickers and glows
All veiled in white
Concealed by winter

The grandeur of the dark
Is followed by the grace of dawn
Last embrace of the dusk
Before the dawn
Before the sun

It has been told by the elders
Event in a sky lasting a blink of an eye
Moment of the wolf
The first spark of dawn

It has been seen by the ones who went forth
Through ice and snow in the freezing north
All veiled in white
Concealed by winter

The grandeur of the dark
Is followed by the grace of dawn
Last embrace of the dusk
Before the Dawn
Before the Sun

New moon has reached alignment
Celestial bodies in perfect conjunction with the solar system
Behold the blinding light escaping from the shield of the sun

A grand distraction in constellation
As the eclipse becomes total, reaches perfection

And the light expires
When the last flare escapes from the shield of sun
