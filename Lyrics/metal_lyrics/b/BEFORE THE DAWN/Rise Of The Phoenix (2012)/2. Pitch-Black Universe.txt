I dream of a universe
A pitch-black dimension
Oblivion through absence of the light

In my deepest slumber
Reveries profound
Darkness eternal around

Sun was torn asunder
Light has been undone
On starless sky no moon to raise the tide

I have seen a parallel void like dimension
Nothingness beyond compare

In that dead cold
Orbit of a black hole
I am the spark
A birth of star
I am the fire

In my deepest slumber
Reveries profound
Darkness eternal around

Sun was torn asunder
Light has been undone
On starless sky no moon to raise the tide
