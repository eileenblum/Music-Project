The best defense
Needs to be built alone
Gather the stones
And create your own
Like the time has told
Like the past has shown
Despite the fear we must stand alone

Destroy
To break the circle of lies and terminate
Everyone that dares to confront
My defense is strong

Bleed inside
Show no signs of weakness
Regardless of the discomfort
Submit yourself to this fabrication

Crawl inside
And be perfectly still
In solitude by your own will
The great escape
From the world around
Is to bury yourself below the ground
