Bleed from core
Destruction with no cure
To repair as whole
Structures of soul grown wrong
Descent of sun
Reveals the map of stars
Hiding my scars

Be still
Don't even breathe
And death won't find you Here
I hide you in my dream
To keep you with me

Ears distorted
False words from venomous tongues
Tearing my world
In pieces
Try resolve
This puzzle of broken life
Move aside
Not in your hands the sands of ages
