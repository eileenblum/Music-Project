By the powers vested in me
By the entity of choice
I pronounce myself dead
At 4:18 am
I am gathered here
To remember the deceased within me

Last flames of the dying sun
Will burn my world
Creating a starless universe
Awaiting the kingdom come
And for rebirth of angels
I sacrifice this earth

Lowered into the grave
My empty casket
So I can rest in peace
Self created funeral
Will finally purify
By this burial
The stains in me
