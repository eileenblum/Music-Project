First snow is starting to fall
This winter will last forever
In the end
Oblivion waits for us all

As the daylight dies
Last flame lingers in the scorched sky
Voice of death
Carries no broken promises
This is the end of day

The end of our world
And our very existence
What was it worth
Waiting for the rebirth
Of the earth
Once worn will be reborn
