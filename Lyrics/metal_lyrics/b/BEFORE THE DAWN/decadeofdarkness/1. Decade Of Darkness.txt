A decade ago I felt like unbreakable
And I had an angel in my songs
A long time has past, but many things have lasted
I still hear the wings of a seraphim

I am still a sleepless dreamer
Stand behind father and son
Black heart, faithless, unbeliever
Still each night before the dawn I hear the deadsong

I am alone
With monsters in my room
They have come to take me

Before I disappear
Into my darkness
I want you to hide me

I watch the morning sun
Without vengeance or wrath
I'll wait for the black dawn to come
Don't look behind, wish for things to be undone
Things happen for a reason under the dying sun
