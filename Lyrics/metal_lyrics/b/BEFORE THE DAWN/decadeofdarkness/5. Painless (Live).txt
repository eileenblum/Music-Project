Without fear I watch the sun that burns horizon
Black flames from the deathstar above
With strength I'll burn

The reason for me to see
Death in my dreams
A silent reminder
The end of all will kill the pain

Slowly I sear, I bury myself alive
And feel the weight of the world
Crushing all, to the abyss I fall
