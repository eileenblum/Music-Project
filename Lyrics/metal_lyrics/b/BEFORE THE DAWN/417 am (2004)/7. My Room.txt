[music: Tuomas Saukkonen, words: Panu Willman]

step inside in to my room, seems like ages I have waited you
one more time in this room like friends
moments past a thousand times, we stood frozen from the lies
moments past a thousand times

once I made my monsters die I can rest my thoughts tonight
this what seems to be wrong is right once I made my monsters die

this my friend is to be last of times when I meaning you
step aside just to see the reasons
selfish thoughts become the needs, prepair what needed to be like new
and many times I needed you
