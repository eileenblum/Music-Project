[music: Tuomas Saukkonen, words:Tuomas Saukkonen/Panu Willman]

lies, it all comes down on the guilty ones
hides, their faceless looks it has begun
dark, some dangerously oblivious
mark, was in the eyes that grave to crush

was there a reason for this all
a brief moment in the past when all went wrong
a memory to reveal one by one
all the failures we have done

in you in me breeded the seed with all these fears
in you in me breeded the seed behind these tears

was there some poison in the air
disease without a cure infected as we inhale
or was it all along
like a thorn
inside when we were born
