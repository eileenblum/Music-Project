[music: Tuomas Saukkonen, words:Tuomas Saukkonen/Panu Willman]

my thoughts of last years promise were to turn
some kind of harm was on its way I learned
could I replace what was once lost
was I wrong

enter my world
where void has reached perfection
and dark are my days
and deep inside
spreading like an infection
eating me alive
until I die

truth to forget in volume which tears apart
long live the lie or to uphold well it's a start
