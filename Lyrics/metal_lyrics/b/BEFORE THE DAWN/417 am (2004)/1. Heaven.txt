[music: Tuomas Saukkonen, words:Tuomas Saukkonen/Panu Willman]

repeating questions to make some sense, fragile words could offer great 
defence
against myself and the creature inside, it's taking me over again

this evil inside me, the cause of my fall
is giving nothing and taking all
failure in re-creation of heaven

and it was all along right before my eyes

already in hell, no reason to die
by means of violence I sacrifice my own flesh and blood again for them

this evil inside me, the cause of my fall
is giving nothing and taking all
failure in re-creation of heaven
