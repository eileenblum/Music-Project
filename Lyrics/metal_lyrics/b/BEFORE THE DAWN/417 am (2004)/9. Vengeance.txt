[music: Tuomas Saukkonen, words: Tuomas Saukkonen]

her voice is calling again
to me with songs of suffering
she sings to me from beyond
repeats your name and the crime you've done

with broken wings, lying six feet under
her blood in your hands feeds my black burning core
with flames aimed towards you
I come with vengeance and hell is coming with me

the silence almost unbearable
brought by the violence of the one
the wrath of god is unleashed
the beast inside has taken the lead in me

with broken wings, lying six feet under
her blood in your hands feeds my black burning core
with flames aimed towards you
I come with vengeance and hell is coming with me
