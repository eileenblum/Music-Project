[music &amp; words: Tuomas Saukkonen]

I gave my speech, I took my stand
draw my marks into the sand
and waited for the tide to wash away my faults

with violence I purify, with rusty nails I crucify
the other one behind the broken mirror on the wall

I take a step towards death, each time little dreamer dies inside
I take a step towards death, each time little dreamer cries inside

the purgatory burns inside, I perish at the stake for crimes
of other one behind the broken mirror on the wall

disgrace me and break me
burn my wings and re-arrange me
still bleeding and feeding
with blood the angels of decay
