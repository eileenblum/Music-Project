[music &amp; words: Panu Willman]

I crushed my self fairly well today
with no respect needless so say
I feel my worries are to stay
yes and still
you can find some hope in me
I wonder

Today it shows
the more I know

If I can't see myself too clear
if I malfunctioned from this fear
will you repair this broken soul
yes I am tired
take my hand and we rest awhile
