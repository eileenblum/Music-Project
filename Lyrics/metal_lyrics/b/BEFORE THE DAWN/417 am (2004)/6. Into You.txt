[music &amp; words: Tuomas Saukkonen/Panu Willman]

feast my eyes with grief and pain or I will lose my strength to go on
loud is the sound I hear inside and through the walls that hide the cries

with cruel words able to paralyze
tear in pieces the structure of your pride
into you I bring all pain
defenceless, senses unable to testify the damage done
into you I bring all pain

calm before all hell or so I feel, today as I seem weak outside,
it is my truth which you can't find and I enjoy to live a lie

you I cannot save, prevent your destruction
unable to give protection from myself
the antichrist in shape of angel
guiding through the dark

stay a while to show how I can change in seconds
proving you were wrong
