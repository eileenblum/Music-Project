In dream once again
I am sinking
Beneath the surface of the sea
Dark waters surrounding
I fall in reign of waves
In this cold embrace
I disappear without a trace

In dead calm
Ocean deep inside
Longing for the moon to bring the tide
I watch her scent
Standing at the waters end
She calls my name and black rain
Starts to descent

Without grief
Without pain
I let the falling rain
Wash away my fears
Soul that seared
Now purified and free
Clouds above creating circle
Her voice like thunder
Calling for the storm
To raise the flood
