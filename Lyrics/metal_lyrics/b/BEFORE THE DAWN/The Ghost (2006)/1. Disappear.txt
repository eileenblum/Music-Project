Inhale
Breath inside infected air
Airborn cancer spreading everywhere
Starting to tear apart
Apart from flawless shell itÂ´s in our hearts
Disease that has been brought to a fine art

We unleashed
The flames of the end
Empyrium within
Is burning like pyre
We set the heaven on fire

Today I feel
I wish to disappear
Leave without a trace
Wish to become
A transparent one
A ghost under the sun

Betray
Broken trust you canÂ´t repair
WeÂ´re just victims
ThereÂ´s no one to blame
First rule in this game
You play
Hide and seek of predators and preys
Our true nature
Revealed in godless ways
