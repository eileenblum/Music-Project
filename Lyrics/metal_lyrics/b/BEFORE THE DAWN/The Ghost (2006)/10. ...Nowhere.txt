No god above to hear prayers
No guardian angels to lead my way
I carry marks of different race
Amongst you cannot find my place

Where do I belong?

Not by myself but alone
Restless soul without a home
I carry marks of a different race
Amongst you cannot find my place


Thanks to damage.done89 for correcting track #6 lyrics.
