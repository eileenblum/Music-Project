To prove my own existence
Not just breathing but alive
Repentance taking place inside my head
Price of my remission
Shed blood and retaliate
Repression of my rage I have denied

Devoid of emotions
Senseless and dead inside
Final retribution on itÂ´way
No hope of revival
Salvation of a kind
No irresolution
ItÂ´s my will, itÂ´s my way

Mark my words
Every accepted failure and fault
Will turn you weak and hollow
