Fighting against the one I see
Mirror reveals my worst enemy
Zero tolerance for weakness and remorse
Breaking point reached long ago
Some things inside should be left alone
Our intelligence too low to deal

The hell inside
Darkness ate all the light
With sorrow as my guide
I deny you

Soon itÂ´s impossible to deal
Make difference between
And to separate
World of darkness from the light
ItÂ´s dying inside
Black and white before my eyes
No emotions
Touch as cold as ice
Frozen and paralysed inside
