Needles in my nerves
Nails in my spinal cord
Acid burns inside my veins
Blood creating stains
Limbs with broken bones inside
Tearing my flesh
Penetrating through my skin
I cannot feel a thing

Peeling my skin
Revealing tissues underneath
Taste the blood while I breath
Limbs with broken bones inside
Tearing my Flesh
Penetrating through my skin
I cannot feel a thing

CanÂ´t recognise myself
So torn apart
The scars and burning marks
On my skin while the real pain
Hurts deep within
