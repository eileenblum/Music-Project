Dreamworld so dark
Where I follow your trace
Only place where I can see your face
Feel your touch
Fell your skin
So long I have been waiting
To feel you in my arms
And I wish to be
Buried inside the abyss
Where light has withered and died
And my princes walks by my side

Her black wings
Carrying me

The shape of seraphim
Black wings carved in stone
Sleeping down below
Buried under the snow

This icy burial ground
Like snow white skin
Now seals my soul within
Like pair of stars
Burning in sky
Like heaven was set on fire
Cold flame inside
Of two pearls made of ice
Dark light shining in your ice

Your voice enchants
Words seduce
Strongly I refuse
To be awaken
From this dream
Let you be taken (from me)
