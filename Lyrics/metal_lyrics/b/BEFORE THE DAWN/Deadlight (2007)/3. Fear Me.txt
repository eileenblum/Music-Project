The cross I Built to clean myself from the filth and
be purified
Self-created burden to feel alive by suffering

Fear me
These hands breed only suffering

3 nails made of steel
12 inches each
They have to reach
Deep enough to carry the weight
Of the flesh
I mean to break

Fear me
These hands breed only suffering
Feel free to disagree
Like the ones before you too will bleed

Fear me
These hands breed only suffering
Feel free to disagree
Like the ones before you too will bleed
