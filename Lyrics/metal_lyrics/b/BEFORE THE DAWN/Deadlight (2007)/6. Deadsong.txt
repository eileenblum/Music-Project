The container of my soul was severed from my shell
At birth I was stigmatized by fires of hell
This hollow space inside is growing still
It's going for the kill
Beneath the blood red sky the song was born
The sky was bleeding when I sang her the deadsong

By my burning cradle
The lullaby of death was sung by dark angels
The daughters of flame

She slept under my wing
A cold embrace
Death's loyal servant now filled with pain
Forever haunted by her angelic face

By my burning cradle
The lullaby of death was sung by dark angels
The daughters of flame

These chains
Hold me down
Down on this frozen ground
In this world where death walks the earth
The sign of reaper given in birth

By my burning cradle
The lullaby of death was sung by dark angels
The daughters of flame
