World is a distant image with no colours
Each day a step towards the loss
That follows with a silent
Reminder of the grief
It's always there
Constant and severe

Memories of the failures
Will feed others to come
Hollow and numb

Death by choice instead of feeling alive
Life pushed aside

These days without the sun
Dying star of light
Burning darkness has begun
To raise flames of the end to come

These days without the sun
Dying star of light
Burning darkness has begun
To raise flames of the end to come
