What is the price at the end of the world
To get to blame and reform
The grand declaration of the final war
Ignore the thought
Clearly deny it's not a lie
Gods never die
I am eternal

These days of self betrayal
Endless vault of failures within

Birth of a whole new black hole
The dying earth feeds new worlds
Superior race without a name to recognise
We have no name we are as one
With our blood we paint the sun

These days of self betrayal
Endless vault of failures within

What is the price at the end of the world
To get to blame and reform
The grand declaration of the final war
Ignore the thought
Clearly deny it's not a lie
Gods never die
I am eternal
