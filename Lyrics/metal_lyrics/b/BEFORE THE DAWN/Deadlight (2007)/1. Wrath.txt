Restart
Ignite with brand new hate
Inhale the pain
Deny the blame
Beat them sore
This is not a metaphor
Black machinery with tons of steel breaking free
One man genocide
Legion in one heavily armed

My Broken bones grown whole
Wounds turned to scars and bleeding stopped
By Divine wrath I am reborn

Withdraw behind your own lines
Pull back the men
The ones who went and slaved my queen
This is for them to see
They bleed
The same blood that painted my dreams
The blood of my enemies

My Broken bones grown whole
Wounds turned to scars and bleeding stopped
By Divine wrath I am reborn
