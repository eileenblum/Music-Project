You can't carry me
I am too heavy inside
You don't have the strength
To get me untied
Beyond salvation
Don't really care at all
Unleash the tide
And let the waters fall

It broke me into little pieces
With edged razor sharp glass drawing my skin
Sharpened by my sins
Aim to rebuild with self-hatred and guilt

Save me
Form the morning sun
Rewrite my fate and let this life be undone

The ocean swallows me into the depths of ages
Darkness as old as the earth
Demons' hive
This crushing abyss
A bliss called life

At the edge of dawn forthcoming light will burn my
eyes and leave me blind
Solar flares torch my skin and wind blows the ashes away

Save me
Form the morning sun
Rewrite my fate and let this life be undone
