Absence of light where only hollow words left to describe and measure the darkness with crown made of bone and flesh of his own

Behold
Can you see the fractions in me?

Searching for someone to burn my wings
The reign of fire
Preaching of something greater and dark
The reign of fire

Destroy and rule
Dominate hellborn playground of feeble fools
And with blood
I am god

Behold
Can you see the fractions in me?

Searching for someone to burn my wings
The reign of fire
Preaching of something greater and dark
The reign of fire
