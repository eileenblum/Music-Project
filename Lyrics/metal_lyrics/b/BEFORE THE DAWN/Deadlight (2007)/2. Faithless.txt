These ways of self deception
Underneath the living shield
We burn and erase
Our sins to be forgiven
The nature we deny
Now blind leads the blind

Believe in me
And my justified confession
Of the 7 deadly sins
I won't bleed from my palms
Or see the statues bleed
No faith left in me

This law without exception
Is written to the core
Words of violence feed the war
Countdown to the judgement
We have all a cause
And saviour from the fall

Believe in me
And my justified confession
Of the 7 deadly sins
I won't bleed from my palms
Or see the statues bleed
No faith left in me
