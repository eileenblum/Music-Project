[music: T. Saukkonen | words: T. Saukkonen]

This sense of failure haunting still
lack of confidence feeding my fear
descending sun invites the darkness in
the child inside, with silent cry

I don't want to be alone...again...

Starfire above when darkness descends
no angels of empyrium have come to send me
