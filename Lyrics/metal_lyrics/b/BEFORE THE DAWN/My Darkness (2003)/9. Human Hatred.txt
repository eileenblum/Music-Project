[music: T. Saukkonen | words: P. Willman/J. Saajanaho]

Ignorance is bliss
hatred shows the way
things that make a man to act in godly ways

Suffocate he must
the anger down inside
fight against himself but will he win this time

Break the weaker mind
crush the thin white spine
nothing here is not so sacred
too big of a cross to bear
is the beauty that we share
....give into human hatred

The world is crawling in bitterness and human hatred
we live for breeding sin

Victims are deep inside
cloudy is the sky
Getting darker all the time
scary is the deepest secret
the path is lit with lies
blinding you for life
....give into human hatred
