[music:T. Saukkonen |words: T. Saukkonen/P. Willman]

Break up the tide that makes you whole
break up the mind, the heart, the soul
I wish I could take a stronger stand
look up to the one who is more than grand...I bow

For my faith and trail of life
unbarrallelled your sacrifice
like every father and son in bloodline we are as one
When the darkness comes still child inside will chase the sun
I reach the stars above and know you never let me fall

Every failure and fault increases the cross I bear
deep inside the demons feast on me and tear
into pieces everything and in my ear
I hear your words unspoken and they will cease the fear...in me
