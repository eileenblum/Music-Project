[music: T. Saukkonen | words: T. Saukkonen]

Deep within
on my skin
bitterness feeds my grief
I fall inside
and close my eyes
Can't push my heart aside

In my space we watch the sleeping sun
In my dreams
all evil things undone...against you

Crawling still
with broken will
why can't I be forgiven
I fall inside
and close my eyes
Can't push my heart aside
