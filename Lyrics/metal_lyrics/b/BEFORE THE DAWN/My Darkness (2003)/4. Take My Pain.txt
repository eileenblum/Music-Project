[music: T. Saukkonen | words: T. Saukkonen]

Paralysed, I cannot breath
tearstained, unable to inhale
kneeled down, face on the ground
screaming aloud but cannot hear the sound

I would have given my life
why can't I give away my pain

For my mind of child unbearable inside
inner demons feeded by my mind
four walls still closing in
why I still feel when I'm dead within 

I would have given my life
why can't I give away my pain

...take my pain...too much for me to take...
