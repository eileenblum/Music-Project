[music: T. Saukkonen | words: T. Saukkonen/P. Willman]

The sun falls asleep and I rise high
all the things I need are above in the darkest skies
With sorrow and grief all the things I have done can't take away these fears
I am sinking too deep
state of darkness it hides my falling tears

My seraphim, all this darkness I carry deep within you would never understand
