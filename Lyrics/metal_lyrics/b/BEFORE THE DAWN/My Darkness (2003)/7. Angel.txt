[music: T. Saukkonen | Words: P. Willman]

Deep inside me is a world of fear
Deep inside me beyond compare

I seek my saviour
to prevent my failures

Breathing hate with twisted grin
please separate me from that skin

Worth for nothing
do all these tears this world is dying
acts inhuman
Making me change my ways of crying

Reasoned, senseless, that's how I feel
how defenseless and blind can one be
purified shall be my name
after your hand
placing this picture to the frame I alone stand
