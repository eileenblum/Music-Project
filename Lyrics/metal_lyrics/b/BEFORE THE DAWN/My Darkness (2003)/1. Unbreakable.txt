[music: T. Saukkonen | words: T. Saukkonen]

This painted smile stains my face
my spoken words meaningless and false
my eyes won't reflect a thing 
impossible to see me brake

The mirror on the wall
staring face unknown to me
behind this mask I hide from thee
these tears impossible to see

This painted smile stains my face
impossible to see me break
