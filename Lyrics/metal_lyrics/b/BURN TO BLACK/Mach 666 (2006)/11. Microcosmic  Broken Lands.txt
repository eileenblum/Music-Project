All arise as the sun sets in my eyes I roll them back it's time to die
Unleash the universal raging flame the speed of light gash the sky with weapons of might
I am the universe arise microcosmic skies
Constellation insanity a fireball cosmic debris

I am the universe cloaked in black jewelled in red diamond clusters around the head
I am the universe come on and turn with me into infinity

Ride the galaxy as the sun sets in my eyes I roll them back it's time to die unleash the universe
Come on and turn with me into infinity ride insanity let's ride

This solar crown upon my head I rise from the living dead
Leave the sun a blacken star beyond the realms of who you are Godhead universe
