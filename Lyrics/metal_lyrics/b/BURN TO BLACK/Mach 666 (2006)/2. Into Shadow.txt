Casted by light seduced my soul this ancient rite mine to behold
And I will be this radiant abyss of darkness there's no tomorrow I'm so gone
I won't follow no religion step to the vortex and gaze inside
Nowhere to hide from your shadow
Wake up time to die from yourself can't hide wake up time to die you're dead inside

Changing the lead into gold the body a temple in illusion below the abyss I will shine
Darker in time waking shadow
Wake up time to die from yourself can't hide wake up time to die you're dead inside
I am calling into shadow falling there's no tomorrow I'm so gone in illusion
Shadow lost in your eyes shadow
