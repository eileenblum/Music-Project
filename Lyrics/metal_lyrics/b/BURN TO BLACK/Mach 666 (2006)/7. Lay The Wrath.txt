With pestilence we lay our wrath backed by hell we raze the path
All has succumb to its bloodbath through your eyes
We raze it with fire unleashed to plague your mind
Come to scourge and retaliate I unearth this plague of hate
Born to die the fire immortal eternal the cult will rise
Laid to waste the carcass ravaged ignorance embraced
Seeds of mutilation growing in your mind seas of putrefaction flowing through time
Eyes are upon you the wolf appears you are the prey stalked by fear you are the hunted

The cauldron black dark circle power we raise for the attack spiral on decay diesel the sun
Deep winter moon under skies of doom black witch awakes from your coil of sleep
Hunt the gods that dream in the weak minds of men in midnight furies vibrate the world
Plasmic torture with atomic purge cleans of chaos bend reality
Deepest abyss apocalyptic sorcery all is forgotten
Eyes upon you the wolf appears everything now plus death
