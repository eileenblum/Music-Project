[originally by Celtic Frost]Lend me your steel-bearing hand
So I may reign the Jewel Throne
My soul feels the gods' demand
As the lost kings uphold my side

Blood and sand mark their way
The usurper's tears guide my sword

Fantasia slept in my thoughts
As I was a son of infinity
The emperor, forgotten, rests in my dreams
As, back to the wall, I start the conquest

Innocence and wrath now lie far beyond
As we cross the deserts to reach the fortress' gates
Tragical serenades are whispered in the wind
As eyes in fury grant us our strength

They are throning on the dignity of might
But the successor is to enter the hall
False truth saw them climbing the steps
But I remain the Jewel Throne's choice
