Pray for death all be cast into oblivion
We stand alone heed the mast
Winds of war metal battalions raping shores
On iron horizons where steel still bleeds
On iron horizons raging warfare

Ravenous blood lust attack and take the lives of all
Decimate ash to ash dust to dust
We are the priests of fire unchain the wolves
On iron horizons off shores of Osiris
On iron horizons we ride to ruin

Destroyers of all light we ride come speed the night on the blacken tides
Pray for death all be cast into oblivion
We stand alone burning disc rise above
Ashes to dust we take the throne
