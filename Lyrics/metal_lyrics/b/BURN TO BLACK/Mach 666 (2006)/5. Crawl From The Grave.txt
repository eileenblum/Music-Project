I feel the dead gonna bury it deep in the back of my mind alright
I feel the wicked decapitated whores I've left behind alright
This necromancer's domain crawl from the grave inside my brain
You cannot erase the dead I'll bury those bones in your head

I am the rot a mental embrace of this decay alright
I am the guts of the dead crawling from beyond the grave midnight
This death's eternal womb lamentations beyond the tomb
Awake to life immortal catacombs in my skull
Always there haunting me somatic death memories haunting taunting me
You cannot erase the dead I'll bury those bones in your head as I rip it all to shreds no testament for the dead
