Let's rot Nigredo the black work to reduce to ash
To burn it all black all that I am
All I've become I am no more
Reduce to ash burn it all to black
I will take hold no return enter this fold and vanish

Albedo the white work is reborn rise from the ashes
White like the new dawn lead into gold into lead
The blood I have bathed in has now emptied me
I now must die no return I now must die and vanish no more death no more life

Rubedo born nor dead all exhumed there is no I all is as it is
Let's rot come on let's rot the blood I have bathed in has now emptied me
I am no more I come again I am no more I am undead dead undead
The body dies dream awhile in decay death has come to butcher put you in your fucking grave
