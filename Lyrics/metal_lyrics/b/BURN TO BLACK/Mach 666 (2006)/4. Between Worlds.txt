Desecration of flesh execution of the gods
Demon sigil seal setting you free with wind of steel
Black be this blood bathed in moonlight
I am the howling between the worlds

This infernal abode the fallen ones you seek hoard the kings unto me
The summon of legions sets you free rampaging winds exalt in power
This mortal coil servant of time I am the seeing eye of the mind
Blaze incarnations between the worlds

Malice of spirit whirling of winds unenlightened scourged with sin
Eyes they meet we are as one onto me bidding be done
Take to shape I dissolve you rise evocation execution of the will
Rampaging winds storm of the mind I greet the howling between two worlds
