As the battle rages on so shall I
Headless and shackled in silence all shall die
Ride winter rancid skies where the raven flies
Lay the beast before the throne close your eyes
Forever sleeping in darkness of my kind
Ride winter rancid skies where the raven flies

Under the wings of madness lost within
Under the seas of sadness savagely burning
Unsheathe the sword release the hounds of fury from the abyss I am reaching commanding hordes
Under the wings of madness lost within
Under the seas of sadness your heaven's burning

Pain and sorrow pain in my possession
Pain is existence pain in my sorcery
Bornless are the circles of death at the gate awaits Seth
Bornless cries of death Manumit the realms of Seth
Winter rancid skies where the serpent flies
