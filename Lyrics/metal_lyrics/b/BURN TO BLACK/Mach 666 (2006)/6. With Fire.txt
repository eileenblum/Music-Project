Blaze your way to paradise sweep across this broken land
Emancipate yourself in its flame unfold your wings of fire
Oceans boil seas recoil feel the burn of its whip the flames laughing rise higher
Torch the sky a pyre before me now entire world molested with fire

Burning bright with crimson glow claim the valley below
Ravage the earth with golden flame fiery embrace quickens
To the sky the flames laughing rise higher
Torch the sky a pyre before me now entire world molested with fire

Devastation its searing breath its dance of symmetry its dance of death
Illuminate come feed the beast all the ashes under hooves we burn
In fire I raise the blade with fire I make the change
In fire I am slain with fire I rise again
In these eyes the dance of flames sweep across this open land
Bewitched by fire none shall remain as it holds your gaze
World of flame none remain world of flame fire speak fire raze fire come annihilate
