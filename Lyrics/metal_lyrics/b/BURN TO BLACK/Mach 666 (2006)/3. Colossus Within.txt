Brute of the beast master of the shine this morning star come and bleed your light
By decree I shall become Lucifer's child
Solar winds rip through me in silence wings of stellar ecstasy climbing the steps to its mastery
Chalice of lust this walking whore a starless womb come and bleed your night over me sacrifice Lucifer's child

Taste the slaughter on the breeze so violent
Hell bent get off your knees and enter the palace of ecstasy
Mach 666 save them Satan morning-star is rising
Venus now aligning we raise our swords and greet the dawn
I spill the blood over me you become Lucifer's child
