Just wanted to hear you, 
Through dying lips. 
Just wanted to point out, 
You're full of shit. 
Getting back all I wasted, 
On such dishonest hearts. 
Save face on a smile, 
And let the rest fall apart. 
Unsteady, drunk, and crazy, 
From the life I live. 
Sick and dizzy. 
Can't crawl from bed, 
To do it all again. 
I'm cutting wrists cause it's all I got to give. 
I'm cutting throats cause it's all I got to live. 
I'm cutting out cause I'm angry at the sun. 
And it's call come undone. 
Over and over. 
I'm trying to live. 
Again and again. 
It's all I got to give. 
Over and over. 
I'm trying to win. 
Again and again. 
I'm going to cash it in.
