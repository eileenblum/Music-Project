Day by day you serve your time.
Mask your face, get back in line.
Suffer the debt pockets down to the threat.
So hopeless, can't even pay the rent.
Life spent dragging a ball and chain.
Locked in, never able to get away.
Forget everything you've been told.
You're a dog on the leash.
Just getting bought and sold.
Day by day, by day.
How can I be saved?
Trading time for the money you get.
Your life doesn't mean shit to them.
Fuck all the promises, because they're all lies.
Cut your throat, and bleed yourself dry
