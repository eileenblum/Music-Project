Dont sweat the drama.
Tonight I'm going home in a coma.
Feel uptight, looking my worst/
This car still finished first/
Teenage mindfuck, walk this way.
I don't rush,
So far I can see.
You're everything wrong for me.
Say away from me.
Throw me away.
I'm gods lonely man,
Loaded up wasted ends.
Wading through wasted dreams.
Not making amends, making a means.
I'm gods lonely man.
Failing ends, and falling ends.
Stay away from me.
Throw me away.
Everything I love is killing me.
I love everything that is killing me.
This is killing me.
Stay away from me.
Throw me away.
