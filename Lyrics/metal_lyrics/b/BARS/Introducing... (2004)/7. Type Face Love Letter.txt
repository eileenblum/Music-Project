Got holes in my fucking hands,
Cause I can't fucking sleep.
All those holes in my fucking hands,
Lead me to believe.
That I waited, and I waited,
For something that's gone all wrong.
And I waited,
For something thta's come undone.
I got a heart attack theory,
In the pocket of my jeans.
And I know I got something,
And it's not what It seems.
Like a bull without horns.
And a god on the mend.
Limping, bored to avoid.
Something fails in my head.
