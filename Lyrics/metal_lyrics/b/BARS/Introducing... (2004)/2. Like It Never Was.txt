Set fire, shoot out the stars. 
Take this road and you wont go far. 
Fail to breathe, no words to speak. 
If I could breathe, I'd gain some faith. 
We can't get... 
Running, stumbling, falling apart. 
We can't get away. 
Where did you go when the pain set it? 
The result of of dropping out to live. 
The streets are alive with vicious lies. 
Set a crash course, destroy and die. 
Never live it down, this is what I do. 
Sifting through the trash. 
Just to be with you. 
Never live it down, this is what I do. 
Sifting through the gtrash. 
Just to see things through. 
This is my body burning. 
This is my head exploding. 
This is the sky falling down. 
I'll keep running. 
I'll get away.
