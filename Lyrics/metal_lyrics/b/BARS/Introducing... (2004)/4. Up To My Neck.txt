Two packs, and a bottle of jack.
Neurotic, gotta wash it all back.
Stand em up, knock em down.
Feel each cruel, dont make a sound.
March in the angels for a graceless fall.
Cracking foundation of a tortured soul.
Up to my neck, outta my head.
Up to my neck and out of my head from you.
Trouble with the booze means touble with you.
Survive another night, gotta make it through.
