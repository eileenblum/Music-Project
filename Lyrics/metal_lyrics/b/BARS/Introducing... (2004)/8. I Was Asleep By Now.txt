Crash and burn,
Scream but not heard.
Setting sun in a world that wont turn.
I can't sleep with my head like this,
How many times can you break a promise?
So little time for yourself,
No time for anything else.
Each pill beating the last,
Killing the pain.
What the fuck can save us?
Stand up let it be known.
Move to the beat and let yourself go.
