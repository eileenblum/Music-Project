Empty, self taught lies.
Since childhood we crash and we die.
Felt so low this time around.
Don't know how the fuck to get it up.
Get my feet on the tround.
Light can't reach us now.
We're too far down.
They cant reach us now.
We're too far down.
Therapy, medicate, isolate.
Look out below.
This bomb will drop and explode.
Dear love I can't let go, no.
This cross I own,
Light cant reachn us now.
We're too far down.
They can't reach us now.
We're too far down.
Tell me one time.
Just what you know about.
Slipping through the cracks in the floor.
Breaking down, forget yourself, forsake your soul.
This world is killiing me.
This world is shooting me down.
