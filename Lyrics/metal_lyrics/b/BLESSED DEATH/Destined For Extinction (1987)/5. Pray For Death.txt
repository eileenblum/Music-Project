Pray for death
Pray for death
Destruction's eve has slowly passed
Regret the fact that you live
For soom enough you'll find a world
For nothing nothing left to give
So ask yourself and decide
There's living corpses left inside
Drop quickly toyour bloody knees
And pray, pray intensely for death
Snow blind there is no sin
Death and dying slowly spun
Earth is in post mortem
Swallowed slowly, nowhere to run
Pray for death
Pray for death
Pray for death
Pray for death
