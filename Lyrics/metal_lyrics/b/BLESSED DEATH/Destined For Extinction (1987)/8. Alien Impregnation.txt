Down from space, came the dying race
Life beyond our sight
To plant its seed among the stars
Chosen earth for its great site
And picked primate to bare its flight
From animal evolved man
God of man never did exist
You prove my theory wrong
Advanced mutation from another world
Has landed man here today
Allien impregnation
Is the eather of your mind
Alien impregnation
Evoluted ape, to sick mankind
Wonder why there's harted
It is bred within
We carry demented symptons
There is nothing I call sin
We are the sons
Of distant stars
Facing extinction, we searched for earth
And injected our destructive seed
Not knowing, you search for answers
In UFO's we do come back to see!
