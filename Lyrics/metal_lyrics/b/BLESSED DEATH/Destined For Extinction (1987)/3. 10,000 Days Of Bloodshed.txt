No
Wars blood screams out death
Battle cries can't be heard
Viet lies - hear my word
Think it's gone: this war's so young
10000 days of Bloodshed
That' now long it lasts
10000 days of Bloodshed
Taste the blood, showered in the blast
Numbered in remenbrance
For the minds that were not there
Just seems so inhuman not to think
Or just not care
This war destroyed the souls of those who lives
Not those who died
And every bloody fuckin' night
Lives on in those who once survived
10000 days of Bloodshed
Sick reminder of the past
10000 days of Bloodshed
Feel the scars how long they last
Pain Just a sympton of the universe
Burns That's the way of war
Deep pain
10000 days of Bloodshed
Never leaves my fuckin' mind
10000 days of Bloodshed
Got to leave it all behind
