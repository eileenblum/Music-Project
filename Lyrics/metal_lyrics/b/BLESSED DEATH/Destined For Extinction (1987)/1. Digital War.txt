Stockpile weapons of war
Mutual assured destruction
Sensors and readout decide the time to die
Terminals linked for digital war
Decisions non left to computers
Warfare convention is gone
Binary codes to the thinking
War's need for man shall be gone
Digital war - encode the death
Digital war - meet your death
Pushbutton war is upon us
No time to life the guns
Destruction of man comes in minutes
Who will determine who won
First strike has no meaning
Retaliation is too complete
The answer lies in the question
Will man produce his own defeat
Decisions have been made for us
we have no fuckin' say
Don't try and save the future
Cause it doesn't matter anyway
When warnings come over the airwaves
The buttons have now been depressed
Expect your world to end in seconds
For this is not just a test
