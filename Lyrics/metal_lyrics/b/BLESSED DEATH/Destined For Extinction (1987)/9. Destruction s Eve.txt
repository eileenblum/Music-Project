Stripped away of humanity and mind
And given up the right to survive
Man forgot the cause of life
And hatred bred his future life
For centuries man had fooled himself
Thinking that night might never arrive
But as the end of life is inevitable to man
So must the earth have a time to die
And as his future swayed in the balance of extinction
All was lost on that eve of destruction
Time has slipped away
No more sunrise to dawn another day
Brittle human fossils
To tell the ways of man
And his evil human curse
Eve of Destruction
Earth's end is near
The dead will earth will rest
In the frozen gloom
Of space
