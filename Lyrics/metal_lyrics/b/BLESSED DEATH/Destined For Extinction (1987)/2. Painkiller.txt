Sentenced to death
For crimes of hate
Injection of drugs
Pushed by the heads of state
Their orders are clear
Watch him squirm and die
Snuff out his life
For living lies
No - stop the pain,
No - killing my brain
You have killed
Now you die
Slow with pain
Death's hand reigns
Acid - laced chemicals cruise throught my veins
Seizing my heart, lungs and brain
For the lies have crushed
I pay now with mine
Oh what will stop this pain
Death - death will save
Death - death will save
Gasping, thrashing, crying, dying
Gasping, thrashing, crying, dying
Gasping, thrashing, crying, dying
Gasping, thrashing, crying, dying
As I lie across this slab
And repeat for my sins
I feel my insides screaming
Oh, death stop this pain
Acid - olaced chemicals cruise through my veins
Totally seizing my heart, lungs, and brain
Death is your painkiller, Death is your painkiller
Death is your painkiller, Death is your painkiller
Death is your painkiller, Death is your painkiller
Death is your painkiller, Death is your painkiller
No...
