Earth in flames, sky of ash
Total war pray for death
There's no future, there is no past
Run your lives are burning fast

Hell
Fear
Strife
Fire
Death
Pain
Eternal War

Years before and years ahead -
War will rule your lives of dread
Run from Hell or so you try
But there's nowhere to hide

chorus reprise

Life born into a war
This war will not end
Face this life of hell on earth
Join and kill avenge your birth
