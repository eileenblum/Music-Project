Showers of fire sent from hell
Boiling flesh bodies melt
Napalm - fire rain
Napalm - blessed pain
Generals deal the death
Mortals gasp for breath
Napalm - slow and true
Napalm - dropped on you

Warlords planning destruction of life
Killing essential no matter the price
Bleeding and screaming
No where to run
Running 'tis useless
Your bodies will burn

No one wants to take the blame
Blood runs true, dropped on you.
