Rays of death beyond our sight
Escape their metal walls
For life we are forbidden
Painful death will have us all
Nuclear reactor
With its human in control
Push the poison slowly
Keep the earth from hot back hoe

Bolts of red hot lightning
Fill the sky in broad daylight
Earth is slowly melting
Tell not if it's day or night
Millions of degrees
Turn solid rock to molten steel
Glowing red hot rivers
Turn human lives to earth's last meal
Many billions years
But to the sun not time at all
Inside the sun we'll find ourselves
When man's reign hath to fall

Planet earth lies barren
No life no light
Reactors stand like guardians
For bones in nuclear tombs
Play with fire and you get burned
Predestined hand of doom
