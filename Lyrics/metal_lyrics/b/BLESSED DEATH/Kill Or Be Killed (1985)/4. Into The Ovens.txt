Death by life, they march
Into the ovens of Hell
Select and slaughter
the perils of war
Scorned by hatred, six million souls
All are dead, no one leaves alive
Into the ovens!  The Fuerer cries

Burnt flesh -
bones and skulls are turned to ash

Cold blood -
Future burned forgotten pasts

No hope -
No one here will set you free

Don't pray -
Don't you put your trust in thee

March forward meet your death
Your life ripped and sold
Evil power left to rule
Nations helpless abandon like fools

Dead they stand alone!
