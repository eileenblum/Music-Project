Enter my sorrow, breath after breath
Life is a vision, blessed only by death
There is no heaven, not even a hell
It's useless to wonder
Religion's a spell

Minds of greed, men of hate
Set the earth round the sun
Instincts, not morals
of animals on the run
Blessed Death

Rot off my flesh
Frees my mind
from this world
Answers to questions
are only now brought to light in the end
Blessed Death

Forced to the ground
by the weight of my tears
Bless my existence
Put an end to my fears

Blessed Death
to a life on this earth
Blessed Death
unknown to birth
Blessed Death
You fear that it's true
Blessed Death
to all of you
It's not I that is dead
But the flesh and the bone
Bury me deep, My underground throne

Slipping deeper into death
Cold and alone
My last breath

Take me-Blessed Death
Give me-Blessed Death
Free me-Blessed Death
Save me-Blessed Death
