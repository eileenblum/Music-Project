No
Crashing down to head on death
My mind is rapped in fear
Prepared to hold my one last breath
King's voice is all I hear
Evil tried to hell us it was coming
It was near

Our minds controlled by terror
Raging fury mass of fear
Metal ripping, necks are thrashing
Skin is broken, bones just snap
Blood is dripping, skulls are broken
Cannot feel the pain just yet
Taste the blood upon my tongue
How sweet it tastes to live
If not for metal flowing through our veins
We would not live
King saved us from death

Deep inside the moment just before
The crashing blow
Eyes are locked on headlights
Death is calling won't let go

Omen of fate
Omen of fate

Hail the omen of fate
Take heed the omen of fate
