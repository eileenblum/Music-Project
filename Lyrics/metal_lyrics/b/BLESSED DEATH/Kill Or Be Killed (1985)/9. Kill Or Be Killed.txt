The rights of man, to kill or be killed
In fear men live of their kind
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth
Deaths, payment for sin
Life taken for truth

No more will I take
I will kill men who take
What's not theirs - blessed wake
Shoot to kill or be killed
Strike to kill or be killed
By my hate I choose your face
You must die
Hate, lust and greed
Roam the streets in evil meed

Kill or be killed [x4]

Take in your hands
The law, rule the land

Kill or be killed [x4]

Strike
Mothers and daughters
Raped by shadows that lie
Old man and woman
Bashed in skulls left to die
Frozen corpses. mutilations
Unseen murders
When will this end?
