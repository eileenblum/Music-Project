Special breed sick in mind
Slaughter pigs from behind
Patent leather stained with blood
Bloody badge in the mud

Pigs must die [x3]
Pig slaughter

Stalks his prey by night or day
In the end all pigs must pay
Crush his brain with pain and steel
Make the law repent and kneel

Pigs must die [x3]
Kill

Rest in peace you pigs
