Beyond the realms of mortal men
The knights of Old Bridge stand
We'd give our lives
And stand for these
Raw metal rules their land
Kings, Queens, blessed be
For you are why we live

Death to all who cross their path
By death you all shall learn
To band amongst those living gods
Our flesh will always yearn
Knights in armor standing strong
Faces of death banging long
Power strength never wrong
Knights of Old Bridge your song

Metal soldiers we knight thee
Stand long legions of steel
Rule by power and
Torture laden death - die
For metal live for death

As I look toward the sky
And think of days gone past
The kings they enter my mind
Born leaders of the quest
Old Bridge, we live for thee
Old Bridge, we die for thee

Brothers in metal
Brothers in death
Our future unfolds
Predestined we met
Old Bridge, we live for thee
Old Bridge, we die for thee

Give me Old Bridge or give me death
