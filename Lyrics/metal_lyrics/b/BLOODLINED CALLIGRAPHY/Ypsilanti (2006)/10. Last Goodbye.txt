The very concept of leadership implies everything I once was, everything that you hoped I would be.
Masqueraded.
Down on my knees I watched you kill me.
Letâs play the victim, game is murder.
Iâll take out the gun, you take out the witness.
Every time I fought back, every time that you left me behind.
Mutilated.
You killed my soul, you stole my insides.
I played the game called murder.
Iâll take the gun, you take the witness.
Goodbye.
Tonight Iâm leaving you behind.
Behind.
Tonight Iâm saying my goodbye.
Goodbye.
Tonight Iâm leaving this behind.
Behind.
Tonight Iâm saying my goodbye.
Weâll say our last goodbye, weâll say our last goodbye, weâll say our last goodbye, weâll say our last goodbye.
All Iâve ever wanted.
All Iâve ever needed.
All youâve taken from me.
All Iâve given to you.
Iâm takinâ back.
Weâre takinâ it back.
Letâs take it back tonight! Goodbye.
Tonight Iâm leaving you behind.
Behind.
Tonight Iâm saying my goodbye.
Goodbye.
Tonight Iâm leaving this behind.
Behind.
Tonight this is our last goodbye.
This is our last goodbye.
This is our last goodbye.
Weâll leave it all behind.
