This hunger, Iâd sooner fall to death than taste the bitterness of your demands.
You must remember that you canât be cleaned, cleaned by filthy hands.
I am eternal.
I canât be broken down.
I canât be hurdled.
Youâll have to take the crown.
I wonât be silenced by you.
I wonât be silenced by you.
I wonât be silenced by you (this isnât over).
I wonât be silenced by you (oh no itâs just begun).
Now we scream the words as one, our voices will be come the thing.
The thing that makes your end.
As the world turns I know they sit upon their thrones and seek to take what they donât own.
I wonât be silenced by you.
I wonât be silenced by you.
I wonât be silenced by you (this isnât over).
I wonât be silenced by you (oh no itâs just begun).
Weâre here and we wonât be backing down.
Youâd sooner see me in the ground.
Cause there is absolutely nothing NOTHING that will keep us from the crown.
No we wonât be backing down.
Youâll have to put us in the ground cause there is absolutely nothing that will keep us from the crown.
We wonât be silenced by you.
