Sunrise. Iâve watched the sunrise through this.
Itâs broken family ties.
Forgiveness is helpful when the loss sets in.
Dark days are yet to come.
From the grave weâve just begun.
Dark days are yet to come.
From the grave weâve just begun.
From here on out Iâll never doubt.
Iâll never take one minute for granted.
Appreciate what youâve been handed.
Minutes turn to hours.
Days turn to years.
The times on passing by.
These things no one hears.
Dark days are yet to come.
From the grave weâve just begun.
Dark days are yet to come.
From the grave weâve just begun.
Iâm finding it hard to let go of your memory.
Now that youâre gone itâs so hard to believe.
In my dreams, when I sleep.
Now that youâre gone, itâs so hard to believe.
