Gone.
It never will be yours.
Now you share the pain.
This gift severed from your hands.
They live through stories of the past.
All your life they would be there for you.
Or so you thought.
The day has come for you to make it on your own.
Cause they have nothing.
Nothing left to give.
Abandoned, youâre forced to take it or leave it.
This is your life.
Take it or leave it.
Go see how far you make it.
Throughout life there will be hard times.
Things wonât go your way, step up to the plate.
Youâll find yourself that way.
Stop living in the past, take off the cast.
Youâre forced to live.
Abandoned, youâre forced to live.
Youâre forced to live.
Abandoned, youâre forced to take it or leave it.
This is your life.
Take it or leave it.
Go see how far you make it.
Just live with no regrets.
Live like life never ends.
This is what youâre creating.
Go see how far you make it.
No regrets, no regrets, no regrets, no regrets.
