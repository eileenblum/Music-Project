Watching you drift away, I can see the lights are fading.
This night is growing cold, I can see the lights are fading.
Watching you drift away.
Iâm watching you drift away.
Watching you drift away, it didnât have to end this way.
Drowning my intuitions in corruption.
Trading my resolutions for succession.
Pushing this segregation revolution.
Stand up to the oppression, itâs your destruction.
Liberation is so hallowed.
Liberation is so shallow.
Liberation, Liberation, Liberation, Liberation!
Iâm watching you drift away.
