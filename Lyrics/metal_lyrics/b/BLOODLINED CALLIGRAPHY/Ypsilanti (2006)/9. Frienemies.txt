Tonight we burn the bridges of our past regrets.
Iâve learned to forgive but Iâll never learn to forget.
The things youâve done to me.
The things youâve said to me will forever be ingrained in my memory.
All your excuses.
All your lies.
Iâm burning them tonight, along with you.
No more will you defile what I love, destroy what Iâve built, no more will I back your hypocrisy.
No more will you have credibility with me.
Iâll burn it down tonight, along with you.
