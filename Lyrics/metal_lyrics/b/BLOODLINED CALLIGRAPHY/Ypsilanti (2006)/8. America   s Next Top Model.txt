No one would expect this from me.
So strong.
So proud.
No one thinks of me.
Rotting.
Dying.
Iâll purge myself from this, from this living hell.
Just take it all away.
Iâm trying to survive another day in this living hell.
Just take it all away, just take it all away from me.
From me.
Our eyes canât hide such simple fears.
A blood filled cry theyâll never hear.
I try to make it go away but I canât escape myself this time.
Speaking of time, mineâs running thin.
It already ended before it could begin.
I try to escape, but I canât make it go away this time.
Iâll say a prayer, straight from the heart.
Iâll hang my head, this is tearing me apart.
