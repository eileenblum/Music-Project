In this life Iâve lost more than most.
Friends, family, chances Iâve paid the cost.
But for everything Iâve lost thereâs been some gain.
Iâve passed every test.
Endured all the pain.
Iâve learned just who I am.
Just when to take a stand.
Iâm strong in my convictions.
There is no contradiction.
Mind, heart, and soul I am strong.
Because I know just what Iâm living for.
Because I know that itâs worth dying for.
You better know just what youâre living for.
You better know if itâs worth dying for.
You better know.
