Soon you will be gone.
But I, I have to stay.
This will be so hard.
Life wonât be the same.
This flame is getting hotter.
This flame it burns your soul.
This flame is getting hotter.
This flame engulfs us.
All your life you try.
Never did you succeed.
No you wish to bleed.
All your hate on me.
This flame is getting hotter.
This flame it burns your soul.
This flame is getting hotter.
This flame engulfs us.
Donât let it get out of control.
Donât let it go too far.
