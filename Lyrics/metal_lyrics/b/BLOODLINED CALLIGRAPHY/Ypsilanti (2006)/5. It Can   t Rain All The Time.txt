Can you feel them? Those hands around your throat.
Theyâre cold and theyâre trying to kill your soul.
I know, Iâve been there.
At the end of my rope.
No sign of help in sight.
Lost every ounce of hope.
Canât see the Light at the end of the road.
No happy ending, nothing left to live for.
Even though the tears will fall, it canât rain all the time.
Your darkest hour will not last.
Even though the tears will fall, it canât rain all the time.
Your strength will grow as the days pass.
I speak words of experience.
I though my life was done.
I thought I couldnât go on.
I swore I wouldnât go on.
I speak words of experience.
I thought my life was done and that I could not go on.
Canât see the Light at the end of the road.
No happy ending, nothing left to live for.
And I canât remember the last time I cried.
Now I know I have strength inside.
Even though the tears will fall, it canât rain all the time.
