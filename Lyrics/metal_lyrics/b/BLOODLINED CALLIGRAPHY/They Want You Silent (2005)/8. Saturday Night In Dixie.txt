Your life is nothing but a shadow of your lies, come on rip off your disguise and realize.
That you always gotta push forward.
Perfect sinful disease, sickness, it eats us.
Always progress, never reject.
Scars are here to show me what's next.
This is a war, this is a fight that I may sleep when I lay tonight.
Where will it be?
Struggle to see all that is left in store for me.
Let us forget where we were at and all that is holding us back.
Holding us back.
And everytime I turned away from you and everytime your faithfulness proved true.
Evil days keep plaguing my whole life but this time I think I'm ready for this life, I know I'm ready for the fight.
