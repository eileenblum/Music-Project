These times they mean so much it's all about love and family.
No one can ever hold us down.
No one can ever hold us back.
Stuck it out through all the hardships, but troubled times have come our way but in the end we'll prevail.
I accept the challenge to change our destiny, Gouge out your eyes, and judge us blind.
We refuse to take your judgements and your lies.
The lives you've turned away will be your true demise.
But this is something you will not take from me, it's in my heart forever.
FOREVER.
And now the time has come for us to rise again, too bad it came to this... settle the score.
