I didn't think that it would come to this, I never thought what we had would end this way.
I gave and all you did was take from me, this was nothing but a game to you.
But I refuse to live in the past.
I'm moving on to better things than you.
With you I was weak but now my strength, it is renewed.
This game you played is over now.
Never again will I mistake lust for love.
This game you played with my heart is over now.
So as I lay down to sleep tonight, I will pray that you find what you're looking for but my seeking is over, for I have returned to my true First Love.
