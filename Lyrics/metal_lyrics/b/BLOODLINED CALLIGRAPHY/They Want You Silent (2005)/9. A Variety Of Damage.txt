We will set this world ablaze.
Everyone has the chance to make a difference, everyone has a chance to change.
When you retrace the steps of your life, will you have used every opportunity given?
Mediocrity is a choice that you must not make.
Take your chance to make a change, be an example of what's within.
Live what you preach and preach what you live.
Let your words be the spark but let your actions be the flame that will burn the truth into the world.
Don't let your silence be a tool for the enemy.
Always speak the truth.
And with the flame of the truth burning within our hearts we will set this world ablaze.
