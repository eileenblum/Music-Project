This one goes out to my friends, family.
The ones that have been there through thick and thin.
Being true and standing tall, helping me pick myself up whenever I fall.
Family extends farther than blood, having my back when push comes to shove.
A forever bond that can't be broken.
The words I've said couldn't go unspoken.
I make this vow to you my friends, we'll stick this out until the bitter end.
Nothing will ever break our tie, my life for yours... no greater love have I.
Our friendship will stand the test of time.
