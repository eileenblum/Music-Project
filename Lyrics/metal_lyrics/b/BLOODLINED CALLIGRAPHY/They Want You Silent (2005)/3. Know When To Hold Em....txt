And we've worked so hard over the years to get where we are.
Now there's no turning back so we'll keep on keepin' on.
Some said we wouldn't amount to anything but we're here to prove you wrong and good things come to those who wait....
10 years later, still goin' strong.
Never stopping until it's over always fighting this endless battle.
And all the choices that we've made are left behind.
The promise of truth isn't hard to reach in and find.
But we're falling apart can't you see the truth that's always been lying right here in plain sight for you to see.
ONE FIGHT!
Put on your armour, fight for your life.
