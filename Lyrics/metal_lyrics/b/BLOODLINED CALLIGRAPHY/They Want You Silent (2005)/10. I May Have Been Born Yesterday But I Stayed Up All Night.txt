Don't confuse taste for truth our blood still burns like fire.
Don't get caught up in the way we rock, it's just a ruse to get us close to you.
Don't be startled by the way we rock. We tear down walls, New York to Cedar Falls.
Soon you will see the there is no one truth, trust us, this is not a game.
Prepare, end is coming soon, the judgement of the strong and weak, judgement of the strong and weak.
Fade away into another reality, fall asleep, wake up and smell the agony.
Dead where you stand.
