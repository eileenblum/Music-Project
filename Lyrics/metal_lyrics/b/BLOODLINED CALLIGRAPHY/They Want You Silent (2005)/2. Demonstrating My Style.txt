You've only got one life make sure you do it right.
No promises for the future no promise for tonight.
When you're gone there's no coming back, make sure you leave here knowing that His love is the only way.
Not doing anything about it is a choice, being a good person won't do.
But accepting the pain and burden carried for you.
Sin is life and life is sin.
Knowing your forgiven for it comes from within.
Living and dying with the choices you've made.
Save us oh God, from the enemy that strikes on sight.
Save me from myself oh God as I lay down to sleep tonight.
Let me rest in your arms as I take my last breath.
Let me rest in your arms tonight as I take my last breath of life.
Let me rest in your arms.
Let me rest in your arms tonight.
As I take my last breath.
As I take my last breath of life.
