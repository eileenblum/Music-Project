The suns set silently. Focused, consciously.
Lines trace single point. Drawn into the mind. Search interior. End built
into beginning.
Slip through singularity. Slip to singularity.
Gold pillars in the sky reach from the horizon.
Full comprehension, free of perception.
Unfolding symmetry. Enter the beauty.
Now we are one.
