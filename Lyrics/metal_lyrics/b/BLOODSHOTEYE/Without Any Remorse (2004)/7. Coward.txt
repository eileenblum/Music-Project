Your hesitance drives
You to hide away
Forget about what could have been
Your living in solitude
Forsaken all that you have grown to love
Refused it to become someone
No free trips here for cowards
Ignorance is just one of your downfalls
Go ahead now run away
Lie to me
Everytime I see your face reminds me that your lifes been wasted
Lie to me
Turn your back on all your dreams and live your life spit on by me
Fucking Coward
Your kind makes me sick
Lifeless running thin
I pity you and all that you think you are representing
Screw all of this
I'm not wasting my time
You'll never get shit
on your own
See how far you get
I can tell you right now
You wont get very far
Fucking Coward
Lie to me
Every time I see your face reminds me that your lifes been wasted
Lie to me
Turn your back on all your dreams and live your life spit on by me
Fucking Coward
