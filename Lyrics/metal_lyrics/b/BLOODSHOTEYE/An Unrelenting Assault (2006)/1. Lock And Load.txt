Volts of rage and hate strike down
Setting off your last nerve
No patience seconds from detonation
The unleashing of the beast that dwells within you
Corrupting the innocent, everyones provoking
YOu to make your move, locked on the next target
Yet to meet your match, undefeated title

Consumed with anger you lash out like a machine
Bloodied in battle, a sigh of relief

This is the end of minds frustrations
Release the pressure way over heated

Lock and Load

Stand over your competitor
Celebrate this victory another missions complete

Live, Die for this shit
It's not a state of mind, its a fuckin way of life

Fists react like weapons of mass destruction
The master of intimidation
Acts of impulse with no use of discretion
Never on to second judge your explosive reactions

Steer clear or surrendor to this one man army
The unleashing of the beast that dwells deep within you The unleashing of the beast that dwells within you

Volts of rage and hate strike down setting off your last nerve No patience seconds from detonation
Make your fucking move, locked on the next target Yet to meet your match, undefeated title
No patience seconds from detonation Make your fucking move, locked on the next target
Yet to meet your match, undefeated title
Make your fucking move locked on the next target
Yet to meet your match
Undefeated title
