In the midst of normality lurks devious intent
Plotting to deceive the purest of innocence
At the downfall of a bitter obsession
Composure slips its way through the cracks
Screams of desperation go unheard
As your own flesh and blood backs down from its word
The hand that's always led the way has strayed
Far from the straight and narrow

Where the waves crash in
The faultless gasp for that one last breath
Like the burmese as it feeds
Fury locks its grip and constricts

A one sided death deal
Delivering the unjust
Questions left unanswered
Until the evidence surfaces
This is the filth and stains the home of man

Drawing the curtain on
The ones that should have meant the most
Betrayed and bribed to your own demise
Rest now the spells been lifted
Lives no longer filled with confliction
The storm has passed
The way is clear

If I would have known then what I know now
I swear I would have spoken

In the midst of normality lurks devious intent
Plotting to deceive the purest of innocence
