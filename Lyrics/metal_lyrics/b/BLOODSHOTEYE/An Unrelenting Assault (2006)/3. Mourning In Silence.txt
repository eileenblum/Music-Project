Awaken me from this dormant state
I've too much time to sit and contemplate
at a loss I cannot find the strength
somebody please rid me of this grief

your time expired so suddenly
I cannot accept this as the truth
how could we let you slip away
life without you will never be the same

reflections of the way things used to be
the good times and bad
when will light proceed this darkness

one day the tears will not be shed
one day we will come to meet again
until then I will remain

I realize now that you're free
from all this pain and all this suffering
deeply missed but never forgotten
this ones for you Scott
in remembrance

I will remember
always and forever
I will never let go
