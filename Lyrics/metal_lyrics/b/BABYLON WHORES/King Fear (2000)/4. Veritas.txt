All of the battles lost and won / All of the things we've said and done /
Become the dark that wells beneath the floor / Lost in a world that I don't
know

Anymore

Where no truth will set you free

All of the lessons that we learned / All of the bridges that we burnt /
Boons for a cruel, jealous god to trade / Lost in a world that slowly turned

All insane

Where no truth will set you free

All beauty houses the heart of pain / Kissed by the evil / In good contained
/ And all truth's grown sad with ages taint / All of our charmed lives
estranged

Where no truth will set you free
