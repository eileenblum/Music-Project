Under the sea / Dead cities in the dark / Dreaming themselves to be / Alive
once more / And in darkened rooms / As vaulted tombs / We hear them call /
As sea devours land / Towers yield to the sand

Oh shine on Black Sun upon all Carthage / As a disease on all fours risen
from sea / Yea shine on Black Sun upon all Carthage / And that which never
was shall always be

And I would see the world revolve / Around the crosses tips / Fleeing the
sun / The vulture / Swooping down on a carrion / Laughing into the
nothingness / That we flee / In mortal fear

Oh shine on Black Sun upon all Carthage / As a disease on all fours risen
from sea / Yea shine on Black Sun upon all Carthage / And that which never
was shall always be

For what is eternity / But a shoreless sea / One eternal day / That sees us
come and move away
