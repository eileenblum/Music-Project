Oh well hey / What did you learn today / Of all the world and its pain / Of
Archons insane?
Oh there's a hole up in the sky from where the angels fall / To bring us
sword and sire children that grow up too tall

Oh there's a hole down in the ground where all the dead men go / Down
purgatory's highways they gun their souls

Oh say you love Satan

Yeah right

What did you learn today / Crossing your fingers / Applauding the play?

Cough up all sixes that you know all signs of horns that you can show /
Maybe you too are like unto the Beast unto the Fiend and Foe

For certainly the hoof and horn must be whereever hair will grow / To call
upon the spirits foul to dance upon your goddamn soul

Oh say you love

Say you love Satan

Yeah right
