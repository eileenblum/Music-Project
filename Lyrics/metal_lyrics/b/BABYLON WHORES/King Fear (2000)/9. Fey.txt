Oh my old friend / How did we get so far so soon / Chasing dragons in the
white of the map / In the blue of your veins

Maybe we'd played / Our little games / In the dark of the world / For a bit
too long / And lost our souls

And with death's release / The knowledge comes / It was the life all along /
We'd been afraid of / In carriage golden / Drawn by horses blind / I saw you
leave this mortal life

Oh my old friend / We grew up boys with a shadow of a man / And neither one
of us was afraid to die / Had a cyclops asked

For had we not / Buried a graveyard / Of screamings ghosts / With a bitter
pride / And called it life

And all tomorrow's games / Are just a memory / Of all the things you dub too
common / In carriage golden / Drawn by horses blind / I saw you leave this
mortal life

Oh do not want too bad / Or the price will be too dear / And do not want too
much / Or you're not ready to let go of / And do not judge / For what do you
know / Of a life with nothing to gain / And everything left to loose

In carriage golden / Drawn by horses blind / I saw you leave this mortal
life

[For Christopher Krogius 1969-1998 - I.]
