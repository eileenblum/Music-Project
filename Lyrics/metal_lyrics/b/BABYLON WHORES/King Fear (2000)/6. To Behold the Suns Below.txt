Well hail Caesar / Horses in the Senate / Where did the eagles fly / Back in
the German woods ?

Lost by the walking wounded / Fleeing the devils of the forest / Taken to
graven idols / Down in their shrines beneath the ground

Oh to behold the suns below

A heart that used to house your love / I offer you below now / As once above

A mirror for simple souls / That tend to stray away from the day / This
maggot ridden horror /To sing you of summer's decay

Oh to behold the suns below
