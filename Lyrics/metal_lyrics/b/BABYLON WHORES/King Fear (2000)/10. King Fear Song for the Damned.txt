Pray tell me / Wise Trevrizent / Are not the good ones all dead / In shallow
graves / In distant lands / Banished from castles of the Grail

Into the mansions of the Sun / Where Doom is housed in golden rooms / In
amber dreaming / Kept by silent halls / Like all crystal / There is to fall

In girun i mus nocte et consuminur igni ingirunimusnocteetconsuminurigni In
girun i mus nocte et consuminur igni

Pray tell me / Wise Trevrizent / Is not our life like our love / Treasured
and clung to with tooth and nail / Yet uncomplete until let go of

Into the mansions of the Sun / Where Doom is housed in golden rooms / In
amber dreaming / Kept by silent halls / Like all crystal / There is to fall
