Apples and silver bear the trees of paradise / Visions of heaven to unfold
before our eyes / Where cherry orchards bloom eternal summer's night / Upon
a sarcen stone we dreamed / Our sweet old lies

And into the dreams bewitched / We'd hear the haunting song / That beckoned
us to taste / Of the dark of unripe dawn

If pride doth go before the fall / The summer never was / Promises gilded
and hollow / No longer do bind us / All knowing and all wise

We'll exit Eden / By the sunrise

As pestilence falls down as rain upon our heads / Still paved with gold
become the roads that we now tread / Covered with sores and drunk with plain
mortality / We have no thing so dear we couldn't / Part with and leave

And if plague and hail they say / May purge a righteous man / Tears wept in
anger / Shall be wiped away / By the Devil's hand

If pride doth go before the fall / The summer never was / Promises gilded
and hollow / No longer do bind us / All knowing and all wise

We'll exit Eden / By the sunrise

(All sacred secrets and serpents / Grow old and tangled in shadows coiled /
Under bridges over Alpheus stream / Carrying their dust on to the sea)
