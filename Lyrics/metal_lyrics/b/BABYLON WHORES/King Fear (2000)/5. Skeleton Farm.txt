Kissed by a snake / You will give birth to a worm / That eats into the small
black hearts / Pumping poison as it turns / Eyed by a basilisk / You will
get stoned / My love has serpents in her hair / She combs with a rake / And
stares beyond

Oh what is life but an open grave / What is today but tomorrow's yesterday /
Hey / Pluck out the eye that offends thee / Raise hell or lower the heaven
at least

Yeah it's a skeleton farm

Look in the abyss / And it looks up on you / In snake pit balanced are the
scales / All souls damned versed in the truth / Devoured by sulphur / In the
belly of wind / Monsters kill monsters / Who kill monsters / In the small
hearts / That smile within

Oh what is life but an open grave / What is today but tomorrow's yesterday /
Hey / Pluck out the eye that offends thee / Raise hell or lower the heaven
at least

Yeah it's a skeleton farm
