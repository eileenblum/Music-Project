Tune on / Tune in / And drop out / Drenched in ye olde Teufelkunst / Licked
from perdition's mouth / With steel beacons high / Against the blood red sky
/ The pitchforks sing the lullaby

And I'll say / I wanna be alone just go away / And I'll say / I wanna be a
star for just one day

On Radio Werewolf

Tune on / Tune in / And drop out / Come in Tango Omega / King Fear is on the
dow / Up from the roof of the world / He plays our little lives / As LP's on 45

And I'll say / I wanna be alone just go away / And I'll say / I wanna be a
star for just one day

On Radio Werewolf

The sleep of monsters produces reason

And I'll say / There's gonna be the hell to pay / And I'll say / I wanna be
a star for just one day

On Radio Werewolf

On turntables emerald and green / On sieges perilous 13 / Play twinkle
twinkle little star / And I'll wonder what you are / Oh how we wonder / Just
what we are
