[Vil]

How high the Sun
For the Lovers, for the Moon
For the Hanged Man
For the Fool

Tread gently with your dancing feet
Over past men in righteous sleep
The princes pale the life that failed
Poisoned they too once had their day

Dance over the graves
And scream for solace out of day
With grimoire, syringe, a mind unhinged
Oh come what ever may

Wathcing the world
Pass us slowly by
A corpse into quicklime
Black beneath your eyes

Hey
Life fades away

How high the Sun
For the Devil, for the World
For the Temperance
The Death's dance

In garden green the worm and fiend
Weave beautiful each our dream
Eat at the timbers of sanity
And then we wake up into

Dance over the graves
And scream for solace out of day
With grimoire, syringe, a mind unhinged
Oh come what ever may

Watching the world
Pass us slowly by
A corpse into quicklime
Black beneath your eyes

Swords to sever limb
Wands to grind the bone
Cups to drain the blood
Coins to shut the eyes

Life fades away

Dance over the graves
Come what ever may
