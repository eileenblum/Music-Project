[Litmanen / Vil]

One smile for love, one smile for hate
And one for both in ecstacy
One out of, on in our time

One smile for pleasure, one for pain
And one for both in Satori
One above, one against the time

Never on nobody's side

Take two lines and make cross
A snare for light and time
Crucified between two thieves
Sun of the evening lands

And hushed they spoke of a white horse
Upon the horse a rider

A dance for creation, one for destruction
And one for both in ecstacy
One out of, one in our time

One for remembrance, one for oblivion
And one for both in Satori
One above, one against the time

Cauhght between the lines

Out of love for the other world
Iron and sadness our machines
Built the Golden House
For rabbits turtles to chase

They say there is a white horse
Upon the horse a rider
With the rider a sword
By the sword the judgement

"Out of the loss of memory
The loss of understanding
Out of the loss of understanding
All evil"

A Pale Horse against time
