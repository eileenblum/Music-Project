Need me a bar on an alleyway / Death on a pale horse to ride away / A
disease bacteria culture dip plate / Bagged take away / And it's all right / Just 
let it ride 

A fleet of dragon barges at berth / To sail off the edge of the earth / Setting 
sail for some bad luck / Could fuck some mean shit up / And it's all right 

Just let it ride 

And if I should lose my very soul / In some distant port of call / I would still find 
my way home / If I took pride and I should fall / My wings could not be shorn /
My heaven would just be cold 

Saw life as a girl from the avenue / Daddy's sunshine with eyes of blue / Been 
more content with a cross eyed witch / Back in an alley ditch / And it's all right 

Just let it ride 

For all the things I've said and known / I guess some reason could be shown / 
Life can be easy / Life can be kind / Plain sodomy in the behind 

Show me a bar on the alleyway / A cross eyed witch to steal my soul away / 
For I could die on an alleyway / With a smile on my lips / For all the yesterdays

Show me a bar on an alleyway
