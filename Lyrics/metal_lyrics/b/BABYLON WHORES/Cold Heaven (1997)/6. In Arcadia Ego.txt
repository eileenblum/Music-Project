In Arcadia ego / Twisted the rose did grow / Sucked up the sap of this world /
Blood red the petals pearled / With some wisdom absurd 

And outside these walls / The night took the rose / Bound it with moonlight / 
And cut it up with the morning star 

In Arcadia ego / A rose to drown in snow / A sepulchre by the sea / Marble to 
slumber beneath / Lulled by a mountain stream 

And outside these walls / The night knows us all / In dark woods wandering / 
Detached of our soul 

"Pour wine and dance if manhood still have pride / Bring roses if the rose be 
yet in bloom / All wisdom shut into his onyx eyes / Our Father Rosicross sleeps 
in his tomb"

In Arcadia ego / How fast the years did go / And how bitter is the wind /
Blowing from shores of Arcady 

And outside these walls / The night knows us all / In dark woods the roses 
grow / In hardship the soul 

In Arcadia Ego
