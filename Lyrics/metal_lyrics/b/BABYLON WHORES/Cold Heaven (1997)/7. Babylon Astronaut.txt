Two feet have I / Pillars of putrid meat / Standing so tall among my / Icons of 
filth / With gargoyle eyes / I see / The Christ he's smiling at me / His 
phosphorous grin / An absolution for all my sins

And in this room / The walls covered with flies / I'm seen through their / 
Myriad eyes / The alien eyes / I'm seen somewhere else / Seen through the
windows of Hell 

A few million / Light years from home / I am searching for a different kind of / 
Insanity / The Babylon astronaut 

Could you leave it all behind?

(There is no evil) 

I see the stars painted on the window's glass / Seven planets supporting the 
nothingness / And I am happy / Nothing more, nothing less

(There is no evil) 

Something came to my room / As flies on the ceiling / Coming down on me / 
One by one / And their hairy limbs / Crawling on my naked skin / The 
motherfuckers screwing on me / Insect sex

No I won't move / As my ears are laden with eggs / Close my eyes / And 
dream of being back in the womb 

"Under the juniper trees Talking cats and silver boots filled with Blood" 

Could you leave it all behind? 

Under another sun / I'll grow saturnine / Lay siege to heaven / In fever 
dreams / And I smash my head / Into the window's glass / And see the stars 
come down at last
