I took my fire upon a mountain  
To mock all truth that flatters men  
And I damned all hope  
That tomorrow shows  
For I cursed all life there is  
As screaming ghosts  
No heaven knows 

And I want to be high
As the suns that shine 
All the time

I took my fire upon a mountain  
To sift through thoughts of all beasts and men  
And I purged the gold 
Thru which the world shall end  
For I courted the Dragon  
Yeah that old serpent 

And I got to be high 
As the suns that shine  
All the time 

And all of thee 
Shall be drunk of me 
Oh yes you will  
I think I'm Deggael
