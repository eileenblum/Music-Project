Darling 
There is an angel 
To teach you see  
With the eyes of Emerald Green 

For darling  
All love is witchery 
God forsaken deviltry 
To draw our blood  
For all world to drink 

And love will come  
And love will go 
Oh suffer not a wish to live  
For you can't follow 

And darling 
There is an angel  
To teach you wisdom of all Heaven  
The pride of all Hell 

For darling 
All knowledge comes with pain  
And all things are still the same  
No matter what their name 

And if nothing is true 
More or less 
The only truth must be  
Nothingness 

[The call of the 2nd &amp; 3rd Aethyr by Fr. Perdurabo]

And darling 
Be sure of the Devil  
Be wary of knots  
Tied as a ladder  
Under a hill

For darling 
There is an angel  
To teach you see  
With the eyes of Emerald Green
