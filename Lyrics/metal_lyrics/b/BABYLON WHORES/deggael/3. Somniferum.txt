Down on the street 
The night is a whore 
for dreams of fools  
Where things of old  
Still turn to gold  
In hands of ghouls 

Oh I would castrate you  
A choir of the damned  
To sing you songs of love  
Of kisses cursed by the Dog star 
And when the summer turns to fall 
I'd stay with you 
Watching the leaves turn gold and grey 
outside your room 

For here is juice of poppy bruised  
With hemlock black and poisonous infused  
Yeah life is a witch  
And then you fly 

Somniferum 

Down on the street  
The neon spells out my true love  
Oh how I fell for her kisses cold  
On my skin as a tip of steel 

Led by the angels white  
Through gravestones blank and clean  
On thru the pastures of green  
I'd be all things that might have been 

And where the angels fear to tread 
I'd walk with you 
For there is nothing 
that can harm a love that?s true 

For here is juice of poppy bruised  
With hemlock black and poisonous infused 
Yeah life is a witch 
And then you fly 

Somniferum 

And death is not black  
But snow white as charms  
Treasured out of sight  
Untouched by the August sun  
Unto which all life must be undone  
Oh in the end  
Love, dream and death are one again
