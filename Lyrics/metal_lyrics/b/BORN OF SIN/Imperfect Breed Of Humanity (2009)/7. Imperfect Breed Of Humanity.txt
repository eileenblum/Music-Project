He is coming like a murder in black
So peaceful like a face carved in stone
Hands of sand is taking your soul
Like dying in sleep you wont see him attack
My heart is deep dark and cold
From within it the night will soon to be unfold

They came to worship me
Imperfect breed of humanity
They are the perfect sword for me
Imperfect breed of humanity
Hear them calling, naked and dirty in the rain
No matter where they are
They are going to face a world of pain

Cutting fast and deep, last breath, your life we'll reap
Never ever fought so hard not even one shall walk away unscarred
Unstoppable shadow front of hate death is now the only open gate
Feel the heavy stench of war the soil is screaming burned and soar

They came to worship me
Imperfect breed of humanity
They are the perfect sword for me
Imperfect breed of humanity
Hear them calling, naked and dirty in the rain
No matter where they are
They are going to face a world of pain

Let it begin!
