Cross marked bloodstained shields
Crushed staring lifeless heads
Fragments of life's helpless suffering
Vulture torn flesh

Flesh and blood is now the road to Nazareth
Mighty demons are seen on the blood red sky

Hell will walk the earth crucified for darkness
Dwelling in hellfire Death has your soul in dark claws
No resurrection forever Hell will walk the earth

Now and forever Hell has unleashed your feelings
Black diseases and firestorms
The storm winds are blowing cold
There will be no time for peace

Thousands and thousands are slaughtered
But the end isn't here they are fighting back

Hell will walk the earth crucified for darkness
Dwelling in hellfire Death has your soul in dark claws
No resurrection forever Hell will walk the earth

The war isn't over the storm winds are blowing cold
Soldiers are still marching
Winds of Hell spawned warriors
And they are coming for you
Behold

HAIL SATAN!

Hell will walk the earth crucified for darkness
Dwelling in hellfire Death has your soul in dark claws
No resurrection forever Hell will walk the earth
