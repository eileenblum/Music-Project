As the sword met the heart of God in a furious clash
Angels tears was blood to be
The symbol of their father broke down in a thousand pieces
And like a dead puzzle the cross was scattered

Blood embraced the man who was the driving force behind the scenery
His skin became coloured by the vine of the veins
Eyes replaced by stars flesh and bone
Sent to Hell and back made his body stronger than the shadows are vivid

Walk in darkness and see the truth
Walk with the lord and get the curse
See us see us rise

They are born my brothers and my sisters
Angels and demons and them between
Singing praise to them never been seen
Web of strength my brothers and my sisters
Unscarred from birth to death
Free spirits to the last breath

With the blood stolen new rivers could stream
The bones the ground the souls were the sphere
Unlight from Hell covered all past life
The new breed here we are dark and strong

Connected to my furious mind we are together
The victory is ours and will last forever.

They are born my brothers and my sisters
Angels and demons and them between
Singing praise to them never been seen
Web of strength my brothers and my sisters
Unscarred from birth to death
Free spirits to the last breath

Walk with the lord and get hit by our fire
