It's here what the sun has feared
I wait in the light of the moon
I kill shining rising I can deceive

It's the cast the deadly spell
You're dying hear Satan's bell
It chimes higher than clouds
Black night embracing the world

Beyond death we ride
World hypocrisy hits the ground
Beyond death we ride
You are to die falling down
You're not the righteous one
Deceiver

Christian prayers will be heard
Oh yes! When its winter in Hell
Christianity a burning corpse
See the world our world black
Behold the age of fire
Demon riot! It doesn't help to show your
cross

Christian cross tumbling around
Jesus died falling down

Beyond death we ride
World hypocrisy hits the ground
Beyond death we ride
You are to die falling down
You're not the righteous one
Deceiver

Of God born you are gone
You'll be put to sleep forever
Forever unorthodox, silent heaven
Of Satan born you are here
You'll be receiving life forever
Forever commanding the roaring Hell

We ride all of us black
Before it's to late
Beyond death not to the end
We will survive Armageddon
Armageddon

Beyond death we ride
World hypocrisy hits the ground
Beyond death we ride
You are to die falling down
You're not the righteous one
Deceiver
