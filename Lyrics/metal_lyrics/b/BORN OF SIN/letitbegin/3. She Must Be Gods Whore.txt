There was a sudden hush
Came to me in my sleep
Opened my eyes and touched my lips
And gave me an infernal kiss

Soverign whore She must be God's whore
Penetrated by God's light
Fucked by your precious lord
She muste be God's whore

Again she is young with beauty shining
Leading me down into her tomb
The pain disappears
On an altar of thorns I am seduced
We two are one in a lifetime it goes on

My body slowly gives up
It's not with might she has won
Her cold laugh is all I hear
She slips away with me to her god

Soverign whore She must be God's whore
Penetrated by God's light
Fucked by your precious lord
She muste be God's whore

When my powers come back
I dream up to the sky
I take her life with a last kiss
She fades away with a bizarre expression
No more betrayal her life slipped away

I am again what I was
Stronger than the sun
God's whore is rotting
Her life taken by me
Graced by unholy power I am now
And god's whore is dead

Soverign whore She must be God's whore
Penetrated by God's light
Fucked by your precious lord
She muste be God's whore
