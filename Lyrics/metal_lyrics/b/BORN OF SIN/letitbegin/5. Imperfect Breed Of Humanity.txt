He is coming like a murder in black
So peaceful like a face carved in stone
Hands of sand is taking your soul
Like dying in sleep you won't see his attack

My heart is deep, dark and cold
From withing it the night will soon to be unfold

They cam to worship me
Imperfect breed of humanity
The are the perfect sword for me
Imperfect breed of humanity
Hear them calling naked and dirty in the rain
No matter where they are
They're going to face a world of pain

Cutting fast and deep last breath your life we'll reap
Never ever fought so hard not even one shall walk
Away unscarred
Unstoppable shadow front of hate death is now your
only open gate
Feel the heavy stench of war the soil is screaming
burned and soar

They came to worship me
Imperfect breed of humanity
They are the perfect sword for me
Imperfect breed of humanity
Hear them calling naked and dirty in the rain
No matter where they are
They're going to face a world of pain

Let it begin!
