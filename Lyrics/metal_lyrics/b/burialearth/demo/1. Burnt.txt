Suffer, 
Does this life make you suffer?
Open your eyes, you dwell in decay!
You deride the life you've been given
Open your eyes, you're dwelling away!

You praise the weakness of your terminal mind
Down on your knees kissing this blood soaked soil

So close you are
So close we are

So close you are
So close we are

The earth shall no longer be
Confined by the choices we made

Man shall no longer breathe
Confined by the choices we made

RELEASE ME
