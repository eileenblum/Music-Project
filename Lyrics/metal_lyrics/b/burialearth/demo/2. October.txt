Feel the strain.
I need to suppress, but all I do is sustain.

A part is missing
In search of replacement
Failure blocks my path

I feel distressed, my mind is empty.
I miss these memories, I cannot even rememberâ¦

I seek my comfort in things that can not heal.
This is not the answer.

I feel distressed, my mind is empty.
I miss these memories, I cannot even rememberâ¦

I seek my comfort in things that can not heal.
This is not the answer.

[Solo]

I now feel the wind
You always took for me.
Carry these wounds for so long
Till only scars mark the fractures.

I feel distressed, my mind is empty.
I miss these memories, I cannot even rememberâ¦

I seek my comfort in things that can not heal.
This is not the answer.

This one last embrace, I hope it spoke my words.
This one last touch, I hope it made you rest.
