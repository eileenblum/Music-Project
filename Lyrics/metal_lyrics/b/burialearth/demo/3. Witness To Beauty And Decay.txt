Skin becomes a bleeding canvas
Scarlet ink inscribes the entity
Losing life with every second
Reach for a world alone

Live in the blink of an eye
Reach for a world alone
Perish from deep down-
-Inside the hate builds up
Against every breath you take
Every day you awake

Live in the blink of an eye
Reach for a world alone
Away from the one you decry

The mask that cracks with each smile
The words that you twist each time
How many truths can you hide?

The scars (that) you try to hide
The lie that cannot free you
What blindness led you---
To this nightmare?

Give birth to dreams
I see the lustre deep in your eyes
Give birth to dreams
The Rose of Jericho can bloom again

A gallery of memories
That you long for everyday
Of a child's innocence (that)
You threw away
You threw away

[Solo]

The scars (that) you try to hide
The lie that cannot free you
What blindness led you---
To this nightmare?

Give birth to dreams
I see the lustre deep in your eyes
Give birth to dreams (to dreams)
The Rose of Jericho shall bloom again
