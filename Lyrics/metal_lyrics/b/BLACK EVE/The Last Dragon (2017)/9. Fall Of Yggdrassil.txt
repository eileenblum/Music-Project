Stars
Darkness
Infinite
Vastness
Time
Ageless
Moving
Effortless

Its branches link the nine worlds
The realms flourish from its roots
The bringer of life
The all eternal tree
Planted amongst the cosmos
Aged beyond the gods of old
All began and is bound to it
At RagnarÃ¶k it will crumble
The war of gods will bring its end
A new world will merge

At its peak, my home Asgard
To watch over the nine worlds
Sacrificed much for knowledge
Keep the peace is my burden
Valkyries gather the fallen
Proven worthy in battle
Waiting in my golden halls
To fight once more
When the end is nigh
The gates will open
My army will preserve this world

Norns
Foresee
Fates
To be
Gods
Will fall
To save
Us all

Battle rages on
Gods against beast
Endless war
Amongst galaxies
Oceans roar
Mountains crumble
Skies become black
Prophecies unfold
Great warriors perish
Chaos unleashed
Fires of Hel rise
No realm is safe
Will the gods prevail
Yggdrasil is falling
RagnarÃ¶k has arrived
My end is nigh
