Entombed in frost
The loved I lost
My heart exhaust
I'll pay any cost
Iced treachery
Wintered misery
Snowy journey
Must set her free

Her frozen face plagues me
Endless rage in me
Vengeance fuels me
Death falls on whom face me
No wounds will break me
Give her back to me

Odin's ravens as my guide
To the land of giants I must ride
Axe and shield at my side
Storming like the raging tide
The icy gates they fortify
My wrath they can't deny
Thor's lighting cracks the sky
Charging my strength until we unify

Frost beast stands tall
Defending the great wall
Ice shatters from the brawl
By my axe, he will fall

Laufey!

Come out Laufey
You will face me
Suffer your treachery
Give her back to me!

Death is upon thee
For the pain you caused me
Feel my misery
Give her back to me!
