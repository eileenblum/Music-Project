Wandering endlessly
Driven by forces unknown
Emptiness haunts my mind
A vast void in my soul

As I climb the mountains high
Fear and excitement boils
A temple at its summit
Hidden for ages from the world

As I enter
My mind set free
Surge of energy
Flows within me

Voices echo in my head
Familiar and comforting
My past lives speak to me
Revealing my legacy

My world fallen to chaos
Engulfed by the dark
I return to bring back the light
A beacon long forgot

Open your minds
Let me in
I will set you free
Your reality
Shadowed from the truth
Open your eyes
See what really is
The true reality
Open your eyes
Flee the darkness
I have set you free
