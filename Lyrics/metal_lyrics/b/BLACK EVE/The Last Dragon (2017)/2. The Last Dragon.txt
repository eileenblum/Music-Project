The dragon eyes
Searches the great unknown
See through man lies
Never let alone
The last of his king
Vengeance poisoned mind

The dragon flies
Memory of blood and bone
Spirit old and wise
All hope turn to stone
The last of his kind
Now myth to mankind

Rage in his heart
Hear the
Last dragon roar
Flaming storm blazes
Trembling the world with fear

Pain in soul
Hear the
Last dragon roar
Volcanic fury
Erupted upon his prey

Oceans of flame
Burning all in its path
Screams of death
Piercing the wind
Fire breath
Igniting all who resist
Great inferno
His wrath will persist
Settling torch
Buildings turn to ember
Pitch black smoke
Engulfing the moon and stars
Snow of ash
Falling across the land
No regrets
Now his mind can rest

Fire!
