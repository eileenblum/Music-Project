Brothers! Gather your might
To defend our land we must fight
Brothers! Tonight we ride
To defend our honor and our pride

Trust the sword in your hand
Time to make our final stand
We will fight to the last man
In Valhalla we will meet again

Flaming arrows light the sky
Fear spreads from our battle cry
Their quest we will deny
Never forgotten those who die

Strength fueled by bloodlust
They will never break us

We fight as one
This battle is won
