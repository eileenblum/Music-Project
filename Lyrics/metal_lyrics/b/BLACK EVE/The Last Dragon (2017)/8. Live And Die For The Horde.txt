Born and raised for war
Live and die for the horde

Brutal savage force
Live and die for the horde

Our fists will crush skulls
Live and die for the horde

We, the hammer lords
Live and die for the horde

We march to the drums beat
Our foe we will defeat
We charge as the horns roar
Our constant thirst for war

To raid and slaughter
Live and die for the horde

Mettle and vital
Live and die for the horde

Our tusk will crack bones
Live and die for the horde

We, the battle orcs
Live and die for the horde

We march to the drums beat
Our foe we will defeat
We charge as the horns roar
Our constant thirst for war

For the Horde!

No rest, no retreat
Live and die for the horde

Honor and glory
Live and die for the horde

For the horde!
