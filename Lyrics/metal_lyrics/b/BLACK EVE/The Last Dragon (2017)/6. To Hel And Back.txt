I've seen so many fall
Back against the wall
No strength to move at all
Spirits fade away
Longing for death
To relieve their pain
To hell and back

No one else can define us
Drown the voices that defy us
Our will lies within us
A whole world in front of us

It seems the shadows draw near
It seems the past isn't clear
Our minds clouded by fear
The Reaper's call is all we hear

Through pain; much to gain
This suffering; no longer endearing
Through heartache; spirits are lifted
This misfortune; life is appreciated
Through weakness; strength is found
This scar; past remembered
Through trials; limits are tested
This agony must be extinguished

Time to free your soul and clear your mind

To hell and back I return
A stronger form of who I am
To hell and back I survived
Forgetting the demons I had inside

Believe in yourself
And escape your hell

Embrace this life
And you'll find your way

Through heartbreak; love is found
This illness; must be cured
Through anguish; self to discover
This doubt; to tear down
This calamity; bring to its end
Through trouble; relief is earned
This plight; will be over
