Father and son fight side by side
Endless war starts to subside

An enemy rises
Seaming from the dead
Let's an arrow fly
A life brought to an end

Through the gates of time, bathed in light
An instant he must turn wrong to right
Through the shrine of light time stands still
A treacherous quest he must fulfill

Gather the essence of gods
For they are the keys of time

Change a fleeting moment
Travel through the gate
Defy the gods design
Alter his son's fate

Eye for an eye, order of the gate
Claims his life; for death is fate
