I am the one, the one you betray
As the night, night turns to day

Now I close, close my eyes
I see the darkness, darkness inside

Why did you rape, rape your own
I feel so, so alone

Used for days, days now years
I have no more, no more tears

I want to run, run and hide
Will you find, find me alive

Raped me - raped your own blood
Why me - why did no one
Help me

Used me - my mom and dad
Kill me - I want to die
Save me - Why did no one
Help me

Find me - alone and sad
Bleed me - tears no blood red
Love me - why did no one 
Help me

Wading The Blood Pools [6x]

[Repeat verse]
