Peeling back skin
Sick urges rise
Aphrodisiac
Your screams, my wine

Smell the scent of blood
As it fills the air
Cannibal arousal
No longer can I bear

Consume The Flesh [6x]

Apprehension turns to lust
As I must taste
As I bite down
On once your face

My feeding frenzy over
My night now complete
Stomach filled with human flesh
My supply will not deplete

Hacking and slicing your muscle to the bone
Stripping away meals as I dine on you alone
Not an ounce is wasted as I'm lead by ecstasy
Your skull is my souvenir, that you were killed by me

Chewing on limbs and drinking back your blood
Pleasing disgust that was never understood
Epidural gnawing I can't control myself
You're my latest victim, your skull resting on my shelf

Consume!

Consume The Flesh
