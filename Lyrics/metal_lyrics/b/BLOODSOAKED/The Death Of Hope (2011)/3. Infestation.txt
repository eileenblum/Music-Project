Breed
Feed
Die!!!

Infestation [2x]

My body, a rotting shell
Bacterium to consume
Millions of tiny organisms
Are now sealing my doom

Gnawing tearing at my flesh
Slowly digesting away
Til there is nothing left
But a puddle of decay

Infestation [2x]

Virulent deterioration
Mocking through gestation
Stopping the infestation
Needing cremation

Nothing to stop the feeding
Torture, pain and bleeding
Soon there's no more feeling
Death's here, hear me screaming

Cast into this feeding frenzy
I'm one host while they are many
Unable to get away

Body starts secreting fluid
Now the smell becomes putrid
And for me there is no future

Disfigured I have become
As they consume until they're done
Destroying this once person

Erasing my given life
Selfish in their feeding plight
