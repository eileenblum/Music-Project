The pressure I can't take anymore
No more can I cope
Suicide my savior
And the death of hope

Grab the chair, tie the rope
End my misery
Once I slip inside the noose
Then I will be free

Death belief
Escape, relief
Darkness, my light
No struggle, no fight

Purity in this endeavor
My control and my pleasure
Feel the tightening of the rope
And experience the death of hope

Kick the chair from under me
Losing precious air
As I dangle helplessly
With death so ever near

The Death Of Hope [4x]

Eyes collapse and breathing slows
Entering the great unknown
As I die and asphyxiate
I was right to control my fate

Growing black this is the end
Death welcomes me as a friend
Suicide my life now cease
Cancelling this life on lease

Death now claims me and I'm free
From this pain and misery
Vile existence is now gone
From humanity's ultimate con

False promises and deceiving scum
I took my life, you lost I won
Prey upon your worthless lives
By you living your spirit dies

I did not sacrifice my life
I escaped this human plight
Worthless humans I don't relate
Strong enough to control my fate

The Death Of Hope [4x]

Death belief
Escape, relief
Darkness, my light
No struggle, no fight

Purity in this endeavor
My control and my pleasure
Feel the tightening
Of the rope
And experience
The Death Of
Hope
