Blood
Flows free
Rotten - Intestines

Now
Lungs severed
Now you'll never breath again

Collecting
Your chunks
Later - consumption

Shattered
Your throat
Feel the horror as it eats you

Corpse
Lay rotting
Liver - repulsion

Wounds
Full of bile
Disfigured now and laying dead

Grind!!!

Grinding Your Guts

Grinding Your Guts
I am god
I am him

I am the god of life
The taker of it now
There is nothing left
Grind!

Grind!!!

Guts
Now splattered
Spewing - violently

Rot
Mangled organs
Gall bladder now ripped apart

Surgery
Demented lust
Hunger - Increasing

Hacked
Your chest
Ribcage has been smashed to pieces

Drenched
In blood
Organs - dissecting

Loss
Of life
Grinding your guts into mush

Grinding Your Guts [6x]
