Following the damned
For now they lead you to
Awaken this darkness
Superior being
Hallowed from the inside
Vengeance is mine

Bind and tortured
Bleeding and screaming
Suffering alone
Forever damned

Blackness it consumes you
It binds you and kills you
Damned I am forever
Soulless, helpless
Nothing can be done
To help you or save you

BURN!
BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRN!
