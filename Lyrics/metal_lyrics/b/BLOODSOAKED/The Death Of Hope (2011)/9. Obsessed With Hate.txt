I will not
Ever forget what you
Did to me
Hate it bleeds - deep with in
My black heart
Everyday full of hate
Can't escape
All this pain, misery

Hate - feel it - it consumes me
Love - I will - never feel it
Pain - silent - but still so real
Fear - of what - I have become
Life - kills me - the pain so real
Dead - I am - dying inside

Obsessed With Hate
Obsessed With Hate

Bred to serve
Serve you with my body
Abused me
Sexually mentally 
Scared for life
Sinister my torture
Now I hate
What you turned me into

Obsessed With Hate
Obsessed With Hate
