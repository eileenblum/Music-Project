As we feast
Upon her meat
In the dark of night

Taste of flesh
On my breath
I swallow her insides

Pool of Blood
Around her head
From the sledge hammer

Limb from limb
Skin to skin
Excitement fills my eyes

She wonât know
What Iâve done
Helpless as she was

Twisted Bitch
In this ditch
I am Devouring

DEVOURING
DEVOURING

Grasp the head
Cut with saw
Decapitated now

Headless Body
Lying there
Naked on the ground

Again I feast
Upon her meat
Intestines fill my mouth

Drape her flesh
On the grass
Maggots start to form

Smash her skull
Split in two
Brains fall to the floor

What Iâve done
Iâm not sure
I know I want some more

DEVOURING
DEVOURING

Devour â Devouring [Repeat]

Carve my name
In her back
Leaving them a clue

Devouring
What I can
Her body was my food

Need more victims
For my urge
Thoughts run through my mind

Another girl
Another night
More flesh to devour

Flesh I crave
Iâm insane
Hideous acts of torture

She lies dead
With no head
Time to Devour

DEVOURING [Repeat]
