I am Abomination, I am What You See [Repeat]

Succumb
to my will
I prey
on your fears
your sins
are my wine
forgiveness denied

Anoint
by my filth
obey
piety
your corpse
foundation
for my religion

Abomination [Repeat]

Through me
Misery
Anguish
Spread through out
Mercy
None given
Animosity

Penance
Is through pain
Imbibe
Your last tear
Consume
All your sins
Repent and consume

I
Breathe in plague
Disease My Feast

Sins
Are My Wine
Make Me Complete

Pores
Absorb Filth
Mankind Emits

Now
I Unleash
Apocalypse

Death
Spreads Through Out
Epidemic

Urge
To Consume
Carcass and Ash

I
Sit Upon
Pestilence Throne

Rise
This Cursed World
Now My Kingdom

Abomination [Repeat]
