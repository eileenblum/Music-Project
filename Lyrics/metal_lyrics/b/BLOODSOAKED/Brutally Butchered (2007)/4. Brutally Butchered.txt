Enter the underworld
Full of pain and death
No one can help you now
There is nothing left

Feel the pain now as my
Fist smash your face
Eye socket crushed
Your pain has just begun

You begin your worthless fight
Trying to save yourself
Smash you in the face again
I think your gonna puke

Now I take my hammer
Bludgen your fucken face
All your teeth on the floor
Now your death has come

Killing... you... for pleasure (pleasure)
Spewing... septic... vomit (vomit)
Bloody... rotting... flesh (flesh)
Lingering... tissue... rotting (rotting)

Now on the floor, you die
Brutally butchered, you lay
Eaten by maggots, regurgitate
Human condition, is dead

Ripped anal, expossed
Room of death, smells vile
Hacked arteries, oozing
Swollen gut, now rotting

Murdered you lay dead
Is your septic fecal waste
Cunt it now bleeds
Voilently from the inside
Blood it runs red
From your cunt to the floor
Cock now swollen
From watching you die

Look what you've become
Brutally butchered
Now you are dead
Brutally butchered
Corpse now mangled
Brutally butchered

Killing... you... for pleasure (pleasure)
Spewing... septic... vomit (vomit)
Bloody... rotting... flesh (flesh)
Lingering... tissue... rotting (rotting)

Now your life is gone
There is nothing left
Corpse laying rotten
In all your fecal juice

Skull full of magots
Rancid flesh on the floor
Smiling at myself
Looking at you fucken whore

Your rotten corpse
Laying on the floor
Organs turned to mush
Still a filthy whore

Disgorged and festering
Is now how you lay
What you've become
Butchered

Butchered...
Butchered...
Butchered...
