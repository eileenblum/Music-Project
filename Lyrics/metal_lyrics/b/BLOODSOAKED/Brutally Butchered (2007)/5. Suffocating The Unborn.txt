Baby dead, laying in your womb
Life is gone, total darkness
Little corpse, begins to rot

Mommy dying, of infection
From the infant, deep inside
Dying kid, drips with puss

Years of smoking, now infecting
Suffocating, babys lungs
Toxic chemicals, now killing

Decayed in the womb
Infant carcass
Months of torture
Torso twisted
Liquified brain
Removal of life

Blood and flesh
Disease engulfs
Vessels explode
Brutally reality
Created to kill
Now you die

Decomposing remains
Innards decay
Arteries gush
Brain twitching
Disfigured chunck
Rots away

Suffocating the unborn
Suffocating the unborn
Suffocating the unborn

Lungs full of soot
Dead to the world
Dead in the womb
Never to see life
Never to live
Born dead

Suffocating the unborn
Infected lungs suffocate
Conceived to deceive

Inhaled thru your blood
Your womb now a casket
Dead at conception

Suffocating the unborn
Infected lungs suffocate
Conceived to deceive

Inhaled thru your blood
Your womb now a casket
Dead at conception
