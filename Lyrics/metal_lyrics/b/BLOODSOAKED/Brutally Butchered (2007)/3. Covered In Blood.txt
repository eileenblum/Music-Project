Filled with terror
Skin turning red
Torturous death
Perish in blood

Rotting tissue turns to mush
Septic blood starts to weep
Infected tissue starts to bleed

Ligaments stretch around your neck
Blistering flesh, another death
Stiffened bones, morbid groans

Butcher your body bloody red
Pulling off flesh, skinned alive
Now the gore has just begun

Piles of flesh
Dripping with blood
Feed on flesh
Gore I crave

Covered in blood
This is your destiny
Covered in blood

Covered in blood
This is your destiny
Covered in blood

The waves of death suround me
Can you not let it be

Bathing in your blood I rejoice
Your bloodless corpse laying dead
Welcome to your hell

Blood flowing from your wounds
Screams of horror fill the air
Your blood is now everywhere

Violently slashing ripping your organs
Spread eagle bloody mess
Your blood is now mine

Covered in blood
Covered in blood
Covered in blood
Covered in blood
Covered in blood
Covered in blood
Covered in blood
Covered in blood
