Bled to death
Bled to death
Bled to death
Bled to death

Self inflicted wounds of torture
Dulling razor slicing deeper
Spewing pus and bloody matter

Oozing, gaping mutilations
Slashing cuts from throat to stomach
Spurting red now drenches clothing

Sliting open dangling carcass
Headless butchered corpses gutted
Bathing in the bloody puddle

Stabbing genitals with a dagger
Embedding knife within your eyeball
Pull out blade and watch it spatter

Bled to death
Bled to death
Bled to death
Bled to death

Pliers ripping your nail bed
Biting off disfigured stumps
Watch you scream as your veins drain

Broken bones internal bleeding
Coughing up your mangled insides
Turning blue while you lose life

Shove a pick up your nostrils
Rip through the nerves to your brain cells
Watch the blood pour from your eyes

Cut off your feet and watch you crawl
See the trail that lies behind you
Splattered on the bathroom walls

Now you bleed
Bleed for me you will
Now you bleed
Bleed for me now
Bleed for me now

Bled to death
Bled to death
Bled to death
Bled to death
