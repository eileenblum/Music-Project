Blood, flows free
Rotten... intestines

Now, lungs severed
Now you'll never breath again

Collecting, your chunks
Later... consumption

Shattered, your throat
Feel the horror as it eats you

Corpse, lay rotting
Liver... repultion

Wounds, full of bile
Disfigured now and laying dead

Grind!

Grinding your guts
Grinding your guts
Grinding your guts
Grinding your guts
Grinding your guts
Grinding your guts

I am god
I am god
I am god
I am him

I am the god of life
The taker of it now
There is nothing left... grind!

End your life I have
Grind you into pieces
Swed some to eat later... grind!

Guts, now splattered
Spewing... violently

Rot, mangled organs
Glall bladder now ripped apart

Surgery, demented lust
Hunger... increasing

Hacked, your chest

Ribcage has been smashed to peices

Drenched, in blood
Organs... dessecting

Loss, of life
Grinding your guts into mush

Grinding your guts
Grinding your guts
Grinding your guts
Grinding your guts
Grinding your guts
Grinding your guts
Grinding your guts
Grinding your guts
