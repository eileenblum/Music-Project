I Am My God
Live For Your Self
I will Reign Here
Engulfed With Lust
Immersed In Self
Empty Predictions

Fear - of God
Makes - You Weak
Beleive - In Yourself
Not - The False
Your Hopes - For After Life
Are - Dead

I Am My God
My Inner Strength
Will Take Me There
Rewarding Life
My God Is Me
I Am My God

Fear - of God
Makes - You Weak
Beleive - In Yourself
Not - The False
Your Hopes - For After Life
Are - Dead

Fear of God Will Makes You Weak
Weaker Than The Average Man
You Are Stronger Than You Think
We Will Reign Supreme On Earth
Pray to No one But Yourself
No One Else Will Listen
Save yourself
Don't rely on God

My Own God [5x]
