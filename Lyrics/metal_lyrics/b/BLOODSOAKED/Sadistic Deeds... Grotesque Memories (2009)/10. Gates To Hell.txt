[originally by Obituary]I know that in the depths beneath
The guilty are the saved
I know living through pain
You, will obey
You lie... Living out the pain you feel
When youâre exposed to all your crimes
Low down here beneath
Living is dying.
Woken, feed by thoughts
Of the dead? And even if you try to escape
You can't even try
Enter the gates to hell
Is were you with us dwell
Fear... Fear of fate
Then your fate is getting (is getting into grind)
(Even as we've begun you're decomposing as you're dying)
Maim full, painful
Life after life
Thought are incinerated
Life is a crime
Enter the gates to hell
Is were you with us dwell
Burning out...
