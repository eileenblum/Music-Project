Can You Feel The Hatered
Deep Within My Soul
Never To Escape This
Feel The Hatetred

Life it Feels so Worthless
Living it This way
Deep Feeling of Sadness
Helplessness

I Feel Worthless
Depression
I am Hopeless
Depression
A Deep Sadness
Depression
Empty Feelings
Depression
Fills My Soul

The empty feeling
That comes from within
Knowing there is no one
Thinking of you

Tears well in your eyes 
Depression leaks out
I am Getting Desperate
Darkness Looms

I Need Help - Help Me [3x]

Horid Ways of Emotion
Dark and Lonely Place
Vacant are My Eyes
My Mind

I've Been Suffering
For So Fucking Long
No One To Reach Out To
HELP!!!!
