Two eyes now stare upon me
In a realm of Nothingness
Mobilizing through this wasteland
In devastation's misery
I am searching high and low
For salvation from damnation
Last chance for survival
The code is no man left behind

Into the darkness
Where your fear resides
We will not be left behind
Run for your life
They won't hear your cry
We will not be behind

Enter to this realm
Oblivion's gates are open wide
You cannot prepare for
This extermination of time
Locked inside dimension of
Never-ending chaos
The only last thread of hope
Is to fight for your life if you can

Into the darkness
Where your fear resides
We will not be left behind
Run for your life
They won't hear your cry
We will not be behind

All across the wasteland
The smell of rotted fools
Wither away your spirit
Crushing you by the soul
Destroying all your will to live
Won't you meet your doom
Among this gruesome carnage
The sands of time
Have torn you to shreds
