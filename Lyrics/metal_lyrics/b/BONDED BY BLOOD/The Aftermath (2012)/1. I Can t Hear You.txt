Scream for me from the depths of hell
Rising up with hate
The louder the better
Till my ears begin to bleed
Cause this is just what I need!

I can't hear you
From the left to right
The circle keeps turning so
Stand up and fight
I can't hear you
From the front to the back
As you're gasping for life
Slipped away in a panic attack

Get on your feet and raise your fist
As in a state of bliss
Scream as you rage
And break out of your cage
Cause silence is deafening!

I can't hear you
From the left to right
The circle keeps turning so
Stand up and fight
I can't hear you
From the front to the back
As you're gasping for life
Slipped away in a panic attack

Bleed for me as you take a breath
No time to hold your tongue
Let me hear you scream our name
Bonded By Blood we arise

I can't hear you
From the left to right
The circle keeps turning so
Stand up and fight
I can't hear you
From the front to the back
As you're gasping for life
Slipped away in a panic attack

I can't hear you
We can't hear you
I can't hear you
We can't hear you
I can't hear you
We can't hear you
Let me hear you
