Like a full-on savage
He is lurking in the night
Lack of human intellect
Prowling in the shadows
He is waiting for the feast
An uncontrolling hunger to be fed

You can't stop me
You will fear me

Conditioned for the slaughter
Waiting for the kill
Evolution set back howling like a beast

Hiding in the shadows
Crawling in the night
His mind a psychotic wasteland
A conscious will to destroy the light
Hiding in the shadows
When he knows it's time to feed
His mind a psychotic wasteland
Built for devouring all he needs

You can't stop me

Hiding in the shadows
Crawling in the night
His mind a psychotic wasteland
A conscious will to destroy the light
Hiding in the shadows
When he knows it's time to feed
His mind a psychotic wasteland
Built for devouring all he needs

Once a dying imbecile
Now a mutated freak
Spewing out of his vital signs
Rotting yet alive
Animal-like putrid pile
No denial of what you see
A lust for human flesh that will not end

Left here to die in an acid bath
Reanimated by a chemical past
Lay waste to all gone without a trace
No identity left as I remove your face

You will fear me
