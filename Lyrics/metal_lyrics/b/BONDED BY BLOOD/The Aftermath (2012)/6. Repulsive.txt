Obsessive
Is what you have become
Can't you see it
It's to the point your mind is numb
Repulsive
Is what you are to me can't you stop
And see you're bringing me
Disorder

Disorder gives way to chaos
You're sickening me
Your mind is weak
Your pride is dead and gone
I can't believe the things you say

It's not just you it's what's in your head 
And how you've been conditioned
Raised on lies and filled with disgust
Your intelligence is missing
It's hatred that is blind
You'd learn if you would listen
A victim of circumstance
His ignorance has blissed him

You're repulsive
Just stay away and leave me be
World repulsion
I can't believe the things you say
You're repulsive
Think again before you speak
World repulsion
Spreading lies and stupidity
You're repulsive
World repulsion
Spreading lies and stupidity
You're repulsive
World repulsion
You're repulsive
World repulsion

Oozing with hatred for mankind
I feel I have crossed the line
Spreading disgust my anger is a must
There is no reasoning why
I can't explain the repulsion you bring
You are the scum of the earth
Within my frustration I'm alienated
You're taking and not giving back

You're repulsive
Just stay away and leave me be
World repulsion
I can't believe the things you say
You're repulsive
Think again before you speak
World repulsion
Spreading lies and stupidity
