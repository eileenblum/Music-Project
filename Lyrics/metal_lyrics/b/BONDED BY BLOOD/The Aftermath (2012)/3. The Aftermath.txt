I was not informed
I was not made aware
Of what horrors lie above us
In the blacked air
Emerging for the vaults
Of which we have dwelled
The ruin of our nation
Piercing with despair

Emptiness consumes you
The ruins here you can't deny
They're dying in pain
I simply can't explain
Loss of words can't think straight
All life here is gone
I simply can't explain what has become
The aftermath

Tearing from the blindness of the outer light
The rays of sun have robbed me of my sight
Only for a moment I am horrified
Everything is clear now
I must survive

Emptiness consumes you
The ruins here you can't deny
They're dying in pain
I simply can't explain
Loss of words can't think straight
All life here is gone
I simply can't explain what has become
The aftermath

The ruins lie in darkness
The air is blacker than my soul
The stench of rotting corpses
The bones are proof of pure demise

The sun is covered for a moment
Panic is what you see
Ground is breaking where you stand
Nowhere you can be
Tidal waves black out the skies
Frozen by fear before you run
Fires that burn all that lives to the ground
There's no escaping demise
Nowhere to go
Nowhere to hide
The aftermath
A dystopian fear
