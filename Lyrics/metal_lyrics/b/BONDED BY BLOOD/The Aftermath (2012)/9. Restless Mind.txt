We fall victims to a restless mind
Sleep deprived until the end of time
We fall victims to the restless mind
The burning sickness in my mind

We fall victims to a restless mind
Sleep deprived until the end of time
We fall victims to the restless mind
The burning sickness in my mind

The wave of distress
Will rise up from their nest
And begin questioning
Where are the answers and the solutions?
What was I asking again?
Who is to blame for a mind that's in pain
Why must this happen to me?
And should we think
And what should we know?
There's only one way to explain
I toss and turn but I still cannot sleep
My thoughts have poisoned me
Lying in a useless slumber
I keep awakening

We fall victims to a restless mind
Sleep deprived until the end of time
We fall victims to the restless mind
The burning sickness in my mind

No one will answer to us

So much quarrel in my head
It never seems to end
I know I have lost myself
But maybe I'm insane
So many thoughts come into play
I don't know what to say
I just cannot answer to
The voices anymore
