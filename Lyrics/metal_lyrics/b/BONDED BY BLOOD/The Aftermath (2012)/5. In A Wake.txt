The clock is ticking the hours near
Insanity whispers in my ear
It's time to go get on this train
To the fields of torture
To the fields of pain
In my seat and close my eyes
Embrace my fate as I take the ride
From this point there is no return
Into eternal fire
Where my soul will burn
Burn

In a wake of this total destruction
I'm awake but I feel
I'm trapped within a dream
I cannot make up for
All the wrongs I've ever done
It's too late now
There's one way spiraling down
Spiraling down

Into the pits of hell
I'm spinning out of control
Where the time is frozen
In this eternal cell

In a wake of this total destruction
I'm awake but I feel
I'm trapped within a dream
I cannot make up for
All the wrongs I've ever done
It's too late now
There's one way spiraling down
Spiraling down

For my pride I will be punished
In the most degrading way
Anger and lust
My punishment is to decay
Gluttony aecidia
Consuming everything
Through envy and greed
I'll be disfigured

In dark surrounding I gasp in fear
Relocate my destination unclear
Passing life before my eyes
What everything was and
Then memories die
And now the air is fire in the atmosphere
The burning flesh the screams I hear
The cries of hate the cries of pain
Driving me insane

In a wake of this total destruction
I'm awake but I feel
I'm trapped within a dream
I cannot make up for
All the wrongs I've ever done
It's too late now
There's one way spiraling down
