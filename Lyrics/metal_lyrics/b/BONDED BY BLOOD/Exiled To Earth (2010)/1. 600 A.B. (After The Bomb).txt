Aftermath of this carnage
We concede to this primitive world
Underground shelters produced
Concealed society âreducedâ
Trying to decipher codes to escape
Vaults are guarded by venomous threats
If you leave you will perish
The age will tell you when you are free

Genocide
A planned procedure eliminating human life

Suffering
From this torture rooted back to savage times

A past adoration, a skillful creation
Harvesting circles of life
The negative matter concealed in the slaughter

Streets are teeming mutant pools
Feet ever thrumming overhead
Scrabble voraciously for food
Concealed society subdued
World above is recast in fire
Caverns beneath redressed in dread
Watch the shadowed tunnel mouths
Listen for the echoed screams

Genocide
A planned procedure eliminating human life

Suffering
A form of torture rooted back to savage times

A past adoration, a skillful creation
Harvesting circles of life
The negative matter concealed in the slaughter
After the bomb we will wait 600 years

Genocide
A planned procedure eliminating human life

Suffering
From this torture rooted back to savage times

A language not spoken
For millions of years
Emerging from rubble and stone
The courage will resist
Against the Crong who oppose
A culture that once was proclaimed dead
Is rising against its supreme
The image of torture is burned in their mind
Reclaim what was taken from them.

A past adoration, a skillful creation
Harvesting circles of life
The negative matter concealed in the slaughter
After the bomb we will wait 600 years

At brink of extinction we fight to survive
Whatever is left on this dry desert land
You have no choice but to kill or be killed
There is no time when your death comes at will
