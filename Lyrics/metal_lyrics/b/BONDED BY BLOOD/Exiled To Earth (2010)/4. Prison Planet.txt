Millions of people misguided
Achieving their ultimate goal
To strip people blind, of all humankind
Their rules you will learn to extol
Divided their pleasures will conquer
Sponsoring both sides of the war
Exploiting the weak to shape their beliefs
New order will be bestowed

Alienation
The elite will deceive with genetic disease
Condemning all those who oppose
Alienation
Human replacement program
In place, breaking away
Alienation
Prison planet identified
They will demolish us all

Mortals concerned for existence
Emergency signals deployed
No human emotion, a bloodthirst devotion
A wrath that will beckon us all
Anger surpasses the conscience
Infectious to our way of life
Finding a blueprint for global control
We died in this cancerous world

Alienation
The elite will deceive with genetic disease
Condemning all those who oppose
Alienation
Human replacement program
In place, breaking away
Alienation
Prison planet identified
They will demolish us all
Endless wars we are fighting
The Crong have now been enthroned
Notoriously lie, they pledged all our lives
A collateral for debt they owe
Enemies to free humanity
Conspire against us all
A country sedated, the wealth aggregated
At last the elite is destroyed
