Advanced medical technology
Creating species never known to man
Abnormal practice of cross insemination
Among the Crong and Neanderthal

Surgical procedure
Taking place in secret labs
No sign of antiseptic drugs

Lack of awareness
Preventing memory formation
Blocking the conscious sensation of pain

Sustained in containment
No way to leave
Approached with a scalpel
And forced to conceive

My mind still alert/responsive
My body is drained
The process has started
Genetic code is obtained

They've planted the seed
Generating new breed

Modification of conception
Transformation taking place
Termination of the unborn young

Suction-aspiration
Contaminated embryo
Abnormal cell growth keeps it alive
Debilitated figure
Unable to retain
Incubation of a parasite
Human host will be detained

New form of life
Cannot be repressed
Killing its host
As it tried to escape

They've planted the seed
Generating new breed

Modification of conception
Transformation taking place
Termination of unborn young

Suction-aspiration
Contaminated embryo
Abnormal cell growth keeps it alive

Sirens go off
All over the test lab
No one shall let it be free
The creature is savage
Not yet fully grown
Training has yet to begin

Sustained in containment
No way to leave
Approached with a scalpel
And forced to conceive

They've planted the seed
Generating new breed
