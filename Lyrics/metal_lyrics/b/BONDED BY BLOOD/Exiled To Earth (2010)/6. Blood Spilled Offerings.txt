Feat upon the horrid visions
The practice of sacrifice
Among the women a virgin stains
The stone slab on which she lies
Four Crong will stand around her
As the fifth prepares the knife
Slicing through the diaphragm, reaching for her heart
Tears it out, holds it high, taking right of life

"Death"
Sent to death to plead for us
"Death"
An extremely malevolent force
"Death"
I embrace mankind

Followers will then gather
As they stabbed, pierced and bled themselves
Autosacrifice for their father
Being worshiped as a supernatural force
Rib cage will be open let them consume you

"Death"
Sent to death to plead for us
"Death"
An extremely malevolent force
"Death"
I embrace mankind

Primitive barbarians
Confined to a small mind
Believe their kind can survive
We will feed them to our gods

"Death"
Sent to death to plead for us
"Death"
An extremely malevolent force
"Death"

I embrace mankind
