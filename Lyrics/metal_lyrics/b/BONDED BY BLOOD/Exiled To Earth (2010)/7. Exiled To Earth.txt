Enslavement of the human race
An instance of invasion with no disgrace
An inconvenient future, all hope dies
Millions of people are sacrificed
To satisfy the needs of a foreign god
Humiliated, beaten, stripped of their rights
Superior beings try to genetically breed
Negative results point to the insufficience

Exiled to this Earth
An ancient tales has arised
A prophecy left untold
Obscure to the human eyes
Extraction of a mortal mind
Genetic organisms forced to abide
The structure has been redefined
To reanimate the putrid flesh

Sectors what a terrible sight
Symbiotic prototypes made to survive
A disaster has emerged
The human intellect has been undermined
A revolution looms, insurgents strategies
Humiliated, beaten, stripped of their rights
From the depths of this peril humanity has devised
A weapon of destruction points to insufficience

Awaken my mind to more worlds than one
Obstructing mankind of the end
Not one being shall know the intentions of ours
The fallen shall never rise again

Exiled to this Earth
An ancient tales has arised
A prophecy left untold
Obscure to the human eyes
Extraction of a mortal mind
Genetic organisms forced to abide
The structure has been redefined
To reanimate the putrid flesh
