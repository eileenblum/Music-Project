Intruders
Lost inside the nest
Cocoons will soon erupt
Incubator of nucleus
The last of the Crong will not last

Deep in the egg chamber
Covered in muck
The stench of the afterbirth burns
Fog fills this vault
As they search for the queen
Proclaim DEATH TO ALL CRONG

DIE

Incubation
Process altered
As they begin to hatch
Offspring crawling
Out of their shell
Not enough rounds for them all

Deep in the egg chamber
Covered in muck
The stench of the afterbirth burns
Fog fills this vault
As they search for the queen
Proclaim DEATH TO ALL CRONG

DIE

Primitive weapons have no effect
All that's left is his knife
Lacerate features
Amputate legs
Paralyzed body besieged
Sector by sector
He murders the young
87 less Crong
Final door opens at face with the queen
The battle has just begun

Deep in the egg chamber covered in muck
The stench of the afterbirth burns
