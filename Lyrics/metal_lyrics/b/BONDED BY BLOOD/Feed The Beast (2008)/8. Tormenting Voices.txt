Stricken by voices that you dread
Leaving you vile, in a pile of shit
Making me feel like
There's nothing left ahead
Something atrocious
My skin just starts to shed
Spitting at me
Well, I'll spit back at you
This torture is endless
To pain you'll subdue

Take these voices
End these voices

Voices won't leave me alone
No time to think
I'm just not your clone
Blocking annoyance from me
Just shut your mouth
And please let me be

Take these voices
End these voices

Believe me when I say this is real
Voices in my head
Telling me to stop and kneel
Distorted thoughts of what you said
Simple lies
You bit off more than you can take
Taken for granted
Well, that makes us two
Your pity is breathless
To these voices of doom

Take these voices
End these voices

Voices won't leave me alone
No time to think
Well I'm not your clone
Blocking annoyance from me
Just shut your mouth
And please let me be

Take these voices
End these voices

Shut it, you think that you're so real
Idiotic thoughts
From a person that can squeal
Telling me how to live my life
Who died and made you president
Of everything that's right
Barking at me
Well, I bark and bite too
This torture is endless
To pain you'll subdue

Take these voices
End these voices

Voices won't leave me alone
No time to think
I'm just not your clone
Blocking annoyance from me
Just shut your mouth
And please let me be
Voices won't leave me alone
No time to think
I'm just not your clone
Blocking annoyance from me
Just shut your mouth
And please let me be
