Massive depression has
Fractured your ways
Ignited the flames
The world set ablaze
There is no solution
When you're the main problem
Littered their minds
With no way to solve them

Mind pollution
Mind pollution

Contaminated thoughts
This isn't the way
Too delusional to think
If we'll ever pay
Violent frustration
With such devastation
Small simple step
Towards world domination

Poisoning judgement
To agree with deceit
Taken my youth
The end bitter sweet
No quest is this easy
You take all its tension
Taking no break from this
World death convention

Mind pollution
Mind pollution

Contaminated thoughts
This isn't the way
Too delusional to think
If we'll ever pay
Violent frustration
With such devastation
Small simple step
Towards world domination

Parts of the world
Set in a hunger craze
Blabber about problems
I'm simply not amazed
Guns creating violence
You think I don't believe
Politicians in religion
Mind pollution is achieved

Mind pollution
Mind pollution
Mind pollution
Mind pollution

Contaminated thoughts
This isn't the way
Too delusional to think
If we'll ever pay
Violent frustration
With such devastation
Small simple step
Towards world domination

Mind pollution
Mind pollution

Now the country
Has taken its toll
We're rotting from the inside
It's swallows you whole
There is no solution
When you're the main problem
Leaders with no minds
With no way to solve them
Now the country
Has taken its toll
We're rotting from the inside
It's swallows you whole
There is no solution
When you're the main problem
Leaders with no minds
With no way to solve them
