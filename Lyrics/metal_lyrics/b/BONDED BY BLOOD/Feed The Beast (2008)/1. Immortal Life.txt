First gate of hell is where I first fell
Seeking for eternal life
Blood boiling heat what a wonderful treat
Feels like getting fucked with a knife

Immortal life

Running and fighting
There's no turning back
Kicking and screaming
A full on attack
Hunger for power
Is nowhere in sight
Searching, I'm dying for

Immortal life

The second stage and I'm trapped in a cage
Lucifer spits on my face
A moment in fear
My thoughts disappear
Break loose without leaving a trace

Immortal life

Running and fighting
There's no turning back
Kicking and screaming
A full on attack
Hunger for power
Is nowhere in sight
Searching, I'm dying for

Immortal life

As I step into the final stage
My hard work I appreciate
The time has come
The end is near
Soon that beast will disappear
For what I've suffered I will gain
Can't you hear him scream in pain?
Immortal life is what I got
But wait what's this?

Immortal life

Running and fighting
There's no turning back
Kicking and screaming
A full on attack
Hunger for power
Is nowhere in sight
Searching, I'm dying for

Immortal life
