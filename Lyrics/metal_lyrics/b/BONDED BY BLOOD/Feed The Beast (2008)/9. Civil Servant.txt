The beginning of the end
Third world order we befriend
Hatred turns to genocide
It seems to be the trend
Civilians life at stake
And yet we still partake
On the cleansing of the human race
We've made a big mistake

We're at war
We're at war

Captured mortals for the thrill
You don't own me, you never will
Satisfaction on my skill
You don't own me, you never will

Civil servant

The poor, the first to go
The answer all below
Disposed of human bodies
For the tax that we owe
Brainwashing all the weak
To follow the technique
The world survival peaks
Annihilation is what they seek

We're at war
We're at war

Captured mortals for the thrill
You don't own me, you never will
Satisfaction on my skill
You don't own me, you never will

Civil servant

Death becomes our fate
Too little, too late
Sometimes you can't destroy
This madness you create

We're at war
We're at war

Captured mortals for the thrill
You don't own me, you never will
You don't own me

Civil servant
