Hateful thoughts inside my mind
Full of rage, you break the bind
Dispensed the shell into my soul
Without a bite of self control

Extinguish the weak

Have you ever
Fed the beast
Well, now it's time
To feed the beast
Have you ever
Fed the beast
Well, now it's time
To feed the beast

For my fury, you're to blame
Now I'll suffocate the flames
Malicious intent, driving me insane
Something so wicked
I can't explain

Extinguish the weak

Have you ever
Fed the beast
Well, now it's time
To feed the beast
Have you ever
Fed the beast
Well, now it's time
To feed the beast

Come get some

Broken bones
Face torn open
Punctured liver
Pissing blood
Shed some tears
Beg for mercy
Left to die
Eternal flood

Extinguish the weak

Mission accomplished
Now you're done
Hope you had your share of fun
It was a blast to say the least
You should've never fed the beast

Extinguish the weak
