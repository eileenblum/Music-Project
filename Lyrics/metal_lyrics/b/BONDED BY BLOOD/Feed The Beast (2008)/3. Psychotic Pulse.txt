Child had no mother
So he won't be missed
All planned at the age of ten
What a terrible twist
Innocent mind of a child
How did it end up like this
Cut his life a little short
Took his childhood bliss

A rage of death is near
Psychotic pulse I fear

Never stopped for anyone
Always had my way
Brought back to reality
Insanity was displayed
Didn't know how far I got
'Till I was almost done
Now there is no turning back
The urge is way too fun

Fear is always spoken
It creeps without demand
Leaves the door wide open
With domination at its hand
All your dreams are broken
No one ever understands
The smell of fear unspoken
It's destructions first command

Lured into the gutter
Where extortion was the plan
Well too young to realize
The violence of her crime
Murder was the subject
And children were her prey
Left a bloody massacre
Well known to this day

A rage of death is near
Psychotic pulse I fear

Denial was her weapon
Cared for no one but herself
The axe, a form of justice
To this world in which she fell
Anger was not mild
Aggression without delay
Armageddon will then follow
Well that's the price that you just pay

Fear is always spoken
It creeps without demand
Leaves the door wide open
With domination at its hand
All your dreams are broken
No one ever understands
The smell of fear unspoken
It's destructions first command

A rage of death is here
Psychotic pulse I fear
A rage of death is here
Psychotic pulse I fear

Savage torture will hunt in the night
Hungry for blood
She strikes with delight
Anxiously, always waiting for pain
Massacred millions it runs in her veins

A rage of death is near
Psychotic pulse I fear

Tables slightly turning
The hunter becomes the prey
Doesn't feel quite right
When she's the one that they will slay
Tables slightly turning
The hunter becomes the prey
It doesn't feel quite right
When she's the one that they will slay

Fear is always spoken
It creeps without demand
Leaves the door wide open
With domination at its hand
All your dreams are broken
No one ever understands
The smell of fear unspoken
It's destructions first command
