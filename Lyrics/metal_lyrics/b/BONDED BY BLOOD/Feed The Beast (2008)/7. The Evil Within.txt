Consuming him from the inside
Quietly it takes over
Like a silent virus that lets you die
As your body perish your skin left dry
Though I try to fight it, I never win
It never sets me free

Now that this illness has taken over
Misery is all I know
Contemplating suicide in my own mind
Just to let me go

Enlightened this evil

Enlightened this evil within

Welcome to a world beyond pain
This world you won't escape
Where evil reigns now you must suffer
As you're left in pain
