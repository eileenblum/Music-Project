A deadly disease taking over the land
Survival, well, it isn't its plan
To rid all the world of all human kind
Opening eyes that were blind

Victims

A bloody disease
This isn't a tease
A shot won't prevent all its wrath
It feels like a trap
When all your bones snap
A symptom of its deadly attack

Stricken by another disease
This time you will cease to exist
Stricken by another disease
This time you will cease to exist

Your brain starts to freeze
And your veins will all clot
Watching your tendons rot
Outlasting the rest with
A will to pull through
No choice but to drink
The blood you once drew
Seeking a cure but
There's none to be found
Your voice is now fully drowned
Gasping for air
As your bones start to crack
Scabs start to form
A cross on your back

Stricken by another disease
This time you will cease to exist
Stricken by another disease
This time, this time, this time

Abnormal condition impairs your routine
Leeches discharge from your spleen
Your case becomes lethal
They're pulling the plug
Decay in their palms like a slug

Victims

A bloody disease
This isn't a tease
A shot won't prevent all its wrath
It feels like a trap
When all your bones snap
A symptom of its deadly attack

Stricken by another disease
This time you will cease to exist
Stricken by another disease
This time, this time, this time

Well, I think it's too late
