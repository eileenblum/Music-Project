Wait 'till you see what's coming from me
You better prepare for the worst
Off in the darkness and locked in a room
Death is a part of my curse
Pray to your god for he'll never come down
His existence has never occurred
Hang on to life by a small fragile string
Your presences just dangles on
Is this a vision or plain superstition
In darkness the plague shall command
Your purpose in life was to be deprived
Of all the bliss in the land

Denounced
Betrayal was imminent
Death is the only escape
Deceived
Loss of respect
How obscure does this world have to be
Revenge
Hell in a cell
Spitting out your name
Retaliate
You'll pay in the end
The pain is about to begin

Vengeance

Failure to notice that this is the end
Extinction just inches away
Sky will turn black and ashes will fall
A symbol of your forthcoming death
A real ugly twist but
You sure won't be missed
As demons arise from your grave
Drink from the water that was given to you
Nothing but piss in your hands
Your carcass still rots as devoured by dogs
Chewed on decaying remains
As day becomes night
The heavens will fall
And the earth as we know it is gone

Denounced
Betrayal was imminent
Death is the only escape
Deceived
Loss of respect
How obscure does this world have to be
Revenge
Hell in a cell
Spitting out your name
Retaliate
You'll pay in the end
The pain is about to begin

Vengeance

Now it's all done
I took it from you
Revenge is better served cold
Down on your knees
With a thorn in your back
The truth is about to unfold
Nothing is left of this place you call hell
As lightning strikes from the sky
Your mind will decay and no one will know
Your pity is not worth a dime
The end comes for you
And it's bottled in clear
Death is just inches away
A real ugly twist but
You sure won't be missed
As demons arise from your grave

Denounced
Betrayal was imminent
Death is the only escape
Deceived
Loss of respect
How obscure does this world have to be
Revenge
Hell in a cell
Spitting out your name
Retaliate
You'll pay in the end
The pain is about to begin

Vengeance
