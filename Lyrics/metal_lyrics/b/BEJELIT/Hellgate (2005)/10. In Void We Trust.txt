[Music by Fabio Privitera, Giulio Capone, Daniele Genugu; Lyrics by Fabio Privitera]

The price that I've paid for my desires
Was always human blood
Heretics cradle was my enemy, my only reason of life
Then in my family,
I was looking for the peace the warmth
But the cradle was my woman, full of sins and desires

(Desires) For my human love
For my holy war
Sacrifice it's a piece of hell
No, I can't do this crime
She's the gold of life
My mission for my love

If you wanna save yourself
Understand your pain
Spill the blood of innocence
No pray for hell

You holy life is searching pain, terror and despair
"Sacrifice her now!" Your only child

If the end is coming on my story full of fear
The Black warrior is the guilty, he's the bastard destiny's son
Now the God's hand is in front of me
It's laughing for my fate, my only chances are the void or eternal pain

(Pain) in my wounded heart
In my tormented soul
'Cause my child it's a piece of paradise
No, I can't do this crime she's the gold of life
I must die for her love...

Void! Void! or resurrection
There's no pray for my hell

Oh, father I'm so lonely
I can't believe what you've become
The madness is running and I want to die in this day
Oh, father I'm so lonely
I can't believe what you've become
The madness is running and I want to die in this day

All my life is becoming illusion
'Cause in my room there were all the lies
My father was a great hero
But not the reality is in front of me

Oh my lonely child it's all for you

The monster is in me, because I love you

Oh No, there's another way

No other ways...

'Cause you can't leave me here in this hell

I can't kill you now

Kill me now!

I'm leaving this earth for the

VOID!
