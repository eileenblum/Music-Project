[Music &amp; Lyrics by Sandro Capone, Fabio Privitera]

From a mad kingdom I came
Dragonslayer in my hand
Under this bloody sky
I've lost my human life

I'll fight my enemies without fears
See the sun on my hungry blade

While I cry my friends
Swear against the gods
Taking my revenge
Fire burns my soul

The pain is running on this earth
Sunlight never kills the dark

I'll kill you
God's Hand
I'll hate you
'Till the end of time

Hate will guide my path
Love brings me madness
My bleeding bloodsign
I smell death is near

I'll fight my enemies without fears
Feel the song of my hungry blade
The pain is running on this earth
Sunlight never kills the dark

From a mad kingdom I came
Dragonslayer in my hand
Under this bloody sky
I've lost my human life

From a mad kingdom I came
Dragonslayer in my hand
Under this bloody sky
I've lost my human life
