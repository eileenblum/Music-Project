[Music and Lyrics by Giulio Capone]

A grim, shows his dead face
Dark shadows follow him everywhere
"I know you, I know your path"
He told me, and I had to run away

A dead light in his eyes
Another piece of my restless time
Now look at the darkening sky
I hope you will heal my soul tonight

Another life...
Another time...

Now lord take me to the rising moon
Skull knight ride!
Now lord show me my own destiny
Skull knight ride!

Please find my will to fight
Please take me out of this mad despair
Who are you, what's your hell
Can't you understand what I'm saying?

Nowhere to go
Nowhere to hide
