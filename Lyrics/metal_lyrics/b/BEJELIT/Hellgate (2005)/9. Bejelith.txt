[Music by Sandro Capone; Lyrics by Fabio Privitera]

She's walking through the fire and she's walking through the love
He's living a great passion and He wishes in his heart
From the Inferno the trial has just arrived
Here in this world the demons never love

Oh no...it's a curse...

Alone in this world the humans don't want stay
Here they found the love in the Satan's pray
When the demon comes from the ritual, the fire burns the flesh
Now the warmed souls, are binded by the love

A demon and a man in love
But divided by mortality
Why we have to pay this prize
Bejelith is the only way to run

Now the Bejelith is screaming, the blood begins to flow
The God's Hand will arrive, and claim the sacrifice
Reality is bending, the bloodsigns on the skin
Are the keys for another world, the keys for the love
