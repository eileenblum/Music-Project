[Music by Sandro Capone; Lyrics by Giulio Capone]

Closed in that room, You think you'll never go out
Trapped in your jail you see clouds beneath blue sky
Caught in a dream will your master let you free now
Stuck in a nightmare and let you dying forever

When you feel down and you're alone
Fallin' on your knees, your life seems to be just gone
Cry out in vain
There's a life spark in your heart
That is burning warm, just remember that I won't let you here

This golden prison I promise it won't be your grave
I'm here to free you and erase you're father blindness
Hear my warcry, I hope you'll understand my
Will to defeat your father evil spell this night

When you feel down and you're alone
Fallin' on your knees, your life seems to be just gone
Cry out in pain
There's a life spark in your heart
That is burning hot, just remember that I won't let you here

Now you're running in the fields with your mind with your dreams
You are crying and you say "I won't die everyday"
There's no joy in your eyes but a lake full of tears
You're cursing the day when your father changed his way..

Brights the moonlight in your eyes full of darkness
You hear a man who is fighting for his end
He opens the door that bring you to the madness
Came from an hell that's in nearer to the heaven

When you feel down and you're alone
Fallin' on your knees, your life seems to be just gone
Cry out in vain
There's a life spark in your heart
That is burning hot, just remember that I won't let you here

Now you're running in the fields with your mind with your dreams
You are crying and you say "I won't die day by day"
There's no joy in your eyes but a lake full of tears
You're cursing the day when your father changed his way..

When you see a pixie out of here
Understand you're not alone
When you fell the wind on your hair
Understand you're not gone...

When you feel down and you're alone
Fallin' on your knees, your life seems to be just gone
Cry out in pain
There's a life spark in your heart
That is burning hot, just remember that I won't let you here

Now you're running in the fields with your mind with your dreams
You are crying and you say "I won't die everyday"
There's no joy in your eyes but a lake full of tears
You're cursing the day when your father changed his way..

Now you're running in the fields with your mind with your dreams
You are crying and you say "I won't die everyday"
There's no joy in your eyes but a lake full of tears
You're cursing the day when your father changed his way..
