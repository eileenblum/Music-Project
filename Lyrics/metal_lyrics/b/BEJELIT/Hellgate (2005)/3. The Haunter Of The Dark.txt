[based on a novel of H.P. Lovecraft]
[Music by Sandro Capone, Fabio Privitera; Lyrics by Sandro Capone, Fabio Privitera]

In the black church of this dark city
He sees from that window with his red eyes
Came from the emptiness, where the stars are dead

He's the messenger of the other Gods
When I look the talisman
Shining in this night He comes in my mind
and eats my brain!

He's the shadow in the night, he's a black cloud in my mind
He's the terror from the stars He's the haunter of the dark!

I must run away, I'll leave the city today
The creature in the church is awaiting me
The talisman in my hand bring me to a new land...

He's the messenger of the other Gods
When I look the talisman
Shining in this night He comes in my mind
and eats my brain!

He's the shadow in the night, he a black cloud in my mind
He's the terror from the stars He's the haunter of the dark!

He's the shadow in the night, he a black cloud in my mind
He's the terror from the stars He's the haunter of the dark!

He's the shadow in the night, he a black cloud in my mind
He's the terror from the stars He's the haunter of the dark!
