Now turn your eyes on me
Creature of God
Your dark throne is falling here on your blood

Blood is our faith
Slave of God
Your dark throne is falling here on my steel

Look at my grim
Pray for the void
But I want your blood
I'll destroy you!

No, there is no way to escape from revenge
You awake the murder in me
For my only reason of life on this earth
I'll destroy you!

Evil, we must be devils
Because the angels
They're all crying for what God has done
God is our curse
Slave of vengeance
Your time has come, you'll die under my hand

Look at my flesh
Pray for your soul
And take now my blood
God is destroying you

No, there is no way to escape from revenge
You awake the murder in me
For my only reason of life on this earth
I'll destroy you!
