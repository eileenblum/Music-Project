[Music by Sandro Capone, Fabio Privitera, Giulio Capone; Lyrics by Fabio Privitera]

I'm here hearing the howling spirits
In this nightmare I'm feeling grief

No way to run away
I must awake or I'll lose my chance
Something is hunting me
They fly and are shading my mind
No way to run away
I must awake or I'll loose my chance

Something is getting out from that mist
The ancient warriors from the battles of past
The lances are leaking out, they're piercing innocence
The rage is rising in me

My only eye is brighting now
Dragonslayer smashing down
Hear me now, hear me now
I'm screaming loud

FIGHT in this forest don't fall
DOWN, bones are destroyed by your
RAGE, don't stop your frenzy
Let your spirit, let your sword goes on

Something is getting out from that mist
The ancient warriors from the battles of past
The spears are leaking out, they're piercing innocence
The rage is rising in me
