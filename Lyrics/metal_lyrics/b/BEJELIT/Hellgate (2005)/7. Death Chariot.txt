[Music by Sandro Capone, Fabio Privitera; Lyrics by Alessio Bisceglia]

In these days of decay I've lost my way
I've forgotten memories in my hopeless life
Strange places, strange skies I've seen in my lifeless life
Now I'm walking on this path that will bring me to the death

It's too late to realize that you can't defeat your fate
Facing the death, embracing your name
Now you realize, fate can't be defeat...

Now you must know, your moment is coming
A gun is your hand but death at your back
Your end is near, ending with your years
Your doom is unknown, now look how you'll die

Your life is leaving, your soul is dying
A voice from the deep that falls in death sleep
Hell's calling you, you have no hope
Carried by the fire chariot

Your end will come on black wings
The stars unknown are crying for her
Tears of blood and tears of pain
Are falling on you from this death domain

Your life is leaving, your soul is dying
A voice from the deep that falls in death sleep
Hell's calling you, you have no hope
Carried by the fire chariot
Carried by the fire chariot
Carried by the fire chariot
