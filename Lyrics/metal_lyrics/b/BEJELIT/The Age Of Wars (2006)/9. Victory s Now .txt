Starving for a wicked dream ambition was your heart
Many soldier follow you in every battle and war
And now than the fortress's burn, war is over!

See the people on the plains when all the fears are gone
Sunlight is shining down on your golden hair
We are knight mercenaries nevermore, war is over!

Stop the steal, stop the war
One shield shall rust in this world
Stop the steal, stop the world
The kingdom is awaiting you

Have you ever seen our faces
On the battlefields we claimed
All the glory screaming
victory's now! victor's now!

Have you ever seen our eyes
shine of joy no more disgrace
All the people screaming
Victor's now! victory! war is over!

See your past life in the mud ambition took you here
You are the only one to become a king
And now that the crown is yours, war is over

Stop the steal, stop the war
One shield shall rust in this world
Stop the steal, stop the world
The kingdom is awaiting you

Have you ever seen our faces
On the battlefields we claimed
All the glory screaming
victory's now! victor's now!

Have you ever seen our eyes
shine of joy no more disgrace
All the people screaming
Victor's now! victory! war is over!

Have you ever seen our faces
On the battlefields we claimed
All the glory screaming
victory's now! victor's now!

Have you ever seen our eyes
shine of joy no more disgrace
All the people screaming
Victor's now! victory's now!

Have you ever seen our faces
victory's now! victor's now!
Have you ever seen our eyes
Victor's now! victory! war is over!
