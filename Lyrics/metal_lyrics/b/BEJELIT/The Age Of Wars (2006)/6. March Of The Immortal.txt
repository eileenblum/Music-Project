Alone in the dark i search for my battlefriends but i see a one
One hundred men where here. it's strange the war is already won
But the smell of blood everywhere gets to my stomach out, the atmosphere is unreal
A figure in front of me surrounded by the thousand corpse

You're here to die
What kind of creature are you
To die
The silver hawk has just requested

Immortal immortal
The wings of devil on you
I smash bodies for thousand years

Nosferatu will spill their blood on this battleground, till the end of time
Crushing bones and cutting their heads while a silver knight is coming on his way
Suddenly he stopped his rage, something brings fear to his bloody eyes
The shining scarlet talisman is the stone of doom

What do you see?
The scarlet bejelit on his neck
What do you say?
God's hand has chosen him

Immortal immortal
He is the chosen one
He is the fifth angel of god
Predestination on your friends

Immortal immortal
The prophecy I have to say

I found the chosen one
My mission has just begun
The eclipse will surround all of you
Satan's age starts with blood
God's hand will be completed
All dreams will become... nightmares
Massacres will begin to flow
The golden hawk will gain black wings
