A dream needs a spark to arrive
The mine burns so bright, deep in me
A gipsy give me red talisman
She said it makes your dream come true

Flyin'on the sea of men and never fall again
Leave mortality behind your name

Another vision in my head
Some dust I tier in my hand
While the world Is screaming my name

I can't live my life wasting time
Waiting the change on my way
So many men had died for my dream
I'm not a fool, I'm the chosen one

A gipsy said the bejelit is not a stone but a key
It shall bring on heart the hand of god

Another vision in my head
Some dust I tight in my hand
While the world Is screaming my name
There's a will in my heart
A little voice said "carry on"
No one stops my run. it's just a dream

Flyin'on the sea of men and never fall again
Leave mortality behind your name

Another vision in my head
A stone in hanging by my hand
While the world Is fearing my name
There's a will in my heart
The voice says "stop now till you can"
No one change my plan. it's not dream
