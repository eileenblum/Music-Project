Deeper than snow don't let me reach you
It's the ice that surrounds my heart when I see you
I wish to steal your soul close in this cold
dance into flames of the fire that's burning

Don't try so hard, the ice you can break
My devotion is so great, my life kept for his dream
How can fly high, we're wings of rising
I can't leave this body fall into sea of men

You want to hide, my flower of winter
In this eyes garden all you hate of your soul
I want to fight for my flower of winter let me kept
Your beauty no more wet by tears

I'm still far to be the summer for your heart
I couldn't burn you like the dream you fight for
Devoid of this winter of wars
I should be as a sword far from my lord

You want to hide, my flower of winter
In this eyes garden all you hate of your soul
I will fight for his great dream of winning because
I'm his sword, the blade forged so cold
Together dividing we keep high his name
And the brave!
Will bring out the dream become reality
Let me fight with you. my flower of winter
I want to protect the beauty that I see in you
I see in you I see in you
