Something is born and something is dies
In the middle of a life
We don't need a reason why
Only battles

We kill for drink
Kill for meat
But don't forget the price

Not ideals, not disgrace
We're mercenaries

We got your heads
The gold is the reason, war is justification
Now, we got your heads
We're living together the age of wars

Thousands of years and thousand of miles
Of dead corposes'bones in flames
Look the way, the reason why
Your ambition

Your smiling face laughs
For the strength of your dreams
We need you, we'll follow you
Shining hawk of gold

We got your heads
The gold is the reason, war is justification
Now, we got your heads
We're living together the age of wars

We got your heads
The gold is the reason, war is justification
Now, we got your heads
We're living together the age of wars
