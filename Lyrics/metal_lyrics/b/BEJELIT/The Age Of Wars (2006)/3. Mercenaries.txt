And my father was the war
I couldn't live my life without blood and fire
From battle to battle. I'll keep for me every wish and desire
The hawk's creew is the means, to gain one's end for life
The shining castle will be in my hands

I'm so lonely master tonight, the winter is too cold
I'm looking for my dream of mighty
Join my crew my fire brings warmth to you

Prepare yourself, mercenaries
The silver hawk has just commanded
Another war has just begun
We'll earn fame, gold and reward
Prepare yourself, mercenaries
The silver hawk has just commanded
Another war has just begun

And my father I never knew
Living my life fighting for two coins gold
No reason to live, no reason to die on fucking world
I join your crew. i will take place in this age of war
If I help you, your arm will be my sword

I feel desperation and fear cause my life is so empty
Join my crew my fire brings warmth to you
Join my crew my fire brings warmth to you

Prepare yourself, mercenaries
The silver hawk has just commanded
Another war has just begun
We'll earn fame, gold and reward
Prepare yourself, mercenaries
The silver hawk has just commanded
Another war has just begun

Burn the towns, slay the men, crush the shields, break the walls
The tower will fall, under siege, we'll surround you to our win

I'm so lonely master tonight, the winter is too cold
I'm looking for my dream of mighty
I feel desperation and fear cause my life is so empty
Join my crew my fire brings warmth to you
Thanks to you my dream will come true...

Prepare yourself, mercenaries
The silver hawk has just commanded
Another war has just begun
We'll earn fame, gold and reward
Prepare yourself, mercenaries
The silver hawk has just commanded
Another war...
