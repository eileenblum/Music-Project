Out in the dark surrounding silent
All around I seek my prayer
Out in the night, among the shadows
For my friend, tonight I have to kill, I have to kill

in the night, on the roof
The noise of dancing is so far now
Here in the cold towards his room
For his sake, this man shall meet his lord, shall meet his lord

In the deep of my mind now there's something wrong
But I will fulfil his master plane has told
Why do I feel so strange, I killed so many times before
Am I a man or am I a hawk?

Look at the evil inside
Every man hides trough deep in his mind
And the beast shall rule the man
Look at the evil inside
as you stare in death sight trough the eyes of a child
Will the young follow the old

I am justified,'cause I'm a simple mind
I am justified,'cause I'm a simple mind
I am justified,'cause I'm a simple mind
I am justified

Father's blood, shadows run, no one can survive tonight
'cause his life and his eyes are on my way
Charmed mind son's dreams shattered follow once him
I close my heart. I'll stop cry

Look at the evil inside
Every man hides trough deep in his mind
And the beast shall rule the man
Look at the evil inside
as you stare in death sight trough the eyes of a child
Will the young follow the old

Mission is ended, death is back, I'm running for my life
I'm leaving silent halls and swimming in the mud
Why do I feel so strange. i killed so many times before
Am I a man or am I a hawk?

Look at the evil inside
Every man hides trough deep in his mind
And the beast shall rule the man
Look at the evil inside
as you stare in death sight trough the eyes of a child
Will the young follow the old

Look at the evil inside
Look at the evil inside
Look at the evil inside
Look at the evil inside
