Once upon a long time ago,
there was a dreaming land, full of dreamers like me.

In Arcadia I believed, like my native fancy place, but some clouds changed its way.
I'll be fighting for my dreams
Why they're tearing'em down.

I'll battle hard laying a pray away
Don't wanna hide and I don't blame
In this muddled middle time, some foul damned fairies, were raiding old reserves.

Once a gracious fairy lady
was struggling for this mess, to defend all these dreams.

To win
But magically she was asleep
and lost her fairy soul.

Aruna's gateway was destroyed
and the dreamland was set away.

I want to brawl for you again
don't want your gold but your grace.

Why don't you awake and flight
we'll give back all word's dream.

Don't blame survive!
