When we were so young in our dreams
we scoff at to be someone
But we... we never forget
how hard to reach is that way.
If we heat the nail on our head and we
split hairs to be there and never apart
but hard is the way of success
and we won't give it up tonight!

In the long run of Bejelit life
a rolling stone gather no moss.
So close yet so far we will forget all intricacies
we're the quiet ones that you need to watch and pretend.

But we are over the moon
and if we forgive the poisoned words
we live so far not runaway
and now we are back on the stage!

In the long run of Bejelit life
a rolling stone gather no moss.
So close yet so far we will forget all intricacies
we're the quiet ones that you need to watch and pretend.

In the long hard run our life will pretend again
to forget and to forgive all the disease of our time!

So close yet so far we will pretend again
to forget and to forgive all the diseases of our time!
So close yet so far we will forget all intricacies
we're the quiet ones that you need to watch and pretend.

We're close so close and so far our golden age
our wish to be o stage
is to gorget and to forgive.
