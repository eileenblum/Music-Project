I will dance, I will cry, I will dance all night...
I don't believe it is real
am I asking myself if it is so close?
Am I kidding if it the end of the world?
I don't care who'll be sore can't you notice we've been deceived.

We don't fight we're dancing the whole night
this can be the last dance for sure
cheers...drink it up and then take off
we're drinking like fish ...blowing
our coolest own deal.

Tonight we won't burn the midnight oil
I cover my ass but I won't be safe and sound
we'll pay our duties through our nose
see the back of the world checking-out for good.

We're too many spoiling the hot broth
when the world is our golden oyster
I always used to be in front row
now I'll be at this  sharp end
who cares if blood is thicker'n water.

Tonight we won't burn the midnight oil
I cover my ass but I won't be safe and sound
we'll pay our duties through our nose
see the back of the world checking-out for good.

We're foot in the grave on in the door
this final shut is our out of the blue
we can dance and cry, but we bore
now it's time for us to blow off.

We will dance, we will cry, we will dance all night
we will dance, we will cry, we will dance till we die.
