I would give anything, for the love of my mother's kiss and I would
never forget its sensation on me.
When the wind wraps his arms on me...
expands within my lungs
I laugh while I cry just to forget how I was.

My youth was blazed behind to me
I rode the streetcar named Dream to save
but the boogeyman haunts me still
I must stand still, my breath's scared me little child.

"Don't speak! Don't blink!"
Help me, save me
Waiting for a sign, waiting for a sign to believe that this world is real.
Waiting for a sign, waiting for a sign to believe that this world is real.

Don't come too close to me.
If you try to redeem me
I might just drag you down into this cold night.
In mind's eye envisions of child
I see my sister lost
I can't love
I can't love.
