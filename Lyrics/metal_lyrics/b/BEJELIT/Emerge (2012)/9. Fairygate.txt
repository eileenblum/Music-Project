I still hear the voice inside my confused mind
thousands of buzzes echo back
I cannot suffer what is the choice I gotta take
there is no silence in my heart.

What is the sign?
Once in a century this gate unlock the bolt
is this the time for you to take the right choice for me
Once in a century this gate break my heart
is this the time the sign for me my freedom dream is real.

With my willpower I'm obsessed to find that maiden
if all my prays will be heard
I'll bore for you!

Once in a century this gate unlock the bolt
is this the time for you to take the right choice for me
Once in a century this gate break my heart
is this the time the sign for me my freedom dream is real.

I curse in my life I saw her tender eyes
I missed my chance and I will die on my own here.

Once in a century this gate unlock the bolt
that was the time for me to take my right choice.
