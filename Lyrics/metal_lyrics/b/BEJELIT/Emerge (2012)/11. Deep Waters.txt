Like emerging from the deep waters of sin
I was born for fighting and survive to my fate
I'm the conquer who attracts to begin
the dark side of the coin is to chase this date.

By my craved crowded roads have no fear to suppose
when long last the end is so close and yet to come.
By my deepest mused thoughts
grant the fear to my foes
I just stole the excess but leave their lost core.

With my ship of cast damned souls like me
like riding a runaway horse in the race
full of wandering ghosts dancing around me
I'll conquer again to satisfy my eager race.

Now I am on the shores of this freaking out lake
I want it to be here my home and success
hope is the whore of my worst bleeding fake
but I want that Rock to be mine or I'll break it out.

Epic battles are now to start
who's defending this territory
for this lake I bounce my big guns 
don't stop the fight.

Manic fouls are dying so hard and I'm laughing out their glory
this place is right to be mine.
Floating down these peaceful waters
I discover how deep and straight they are
towing swarms of awesome treasures
I let me be lulled.

When I see those beautiful islands
I imagine my all life to be there
I'm surrounded by magnificent mountains
I'll conquering those escaping lands
I want to be there and I want to have more.

If I die far away from home 
I'll be kissed by my sweet deep waters
I won't die before to see
how great is this lake that'll keep my name...my name.

Like emerging from the deep waters of sin
I'm the conquer who attracts to begin
this is my land, my fate and my keen.
