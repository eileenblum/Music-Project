Budge away I cross this way once I was far away
I won't lay my feet to stay can't you feel a three life way?

The taste of the earth is like molten rock
if I breathe the sun life's just begun.
The voice from the cave jammed of red fire
the wind is the empire of this triangular shape.

Move away the Triskelion legs
like a wheel they run  away
in the revenge is fading avenge
as bloomed flowers the whole year.

The taste of the earth is like molten rock
if I breathe the sun life's just begun.
The voice from the cave jammed of red fire
the wind is the empire of this triangular shape.

Now that I believe the things can really change.
Now the wind amend around me...around me.
And how would you believe the dreams can be realized.
Now the outbreaks of the mountain won't surprise
...won't surprise.

Ohh I won't forget the time spent there, how heart breakable.
Now in my dreams to be there again, but I'm so far away.

Now that I believe the things can really change.
Now the wind amend around me...around me.
And how would you believe the dreams can be realized.
Now the outbreaks of the mountain's around me
...around me
