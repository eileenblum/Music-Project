How can you look inside my mind?
What do you know about my life?
My face is the mirror of what I do
Now I'm ready and proud to be despised.

'Cause we got the tragedy
Tell me who am I, than so you'll be wrong
Nobody knows what I do, what I do
Leave me alone and see what I'm able to do
Nobody knows what I do, what I do
It's my shame!
Our show begins, we let them die their useless words frown in our gold and tears
you can only hit the ground and watch my rise
Now I am going to be dangerous
Because we got the tragedy
Tell me who am I, than so you'll be wrong

Nobody knows what I do, what I do
Leave me alone and see what I'm able to do
Nobody knows what I do, what I do
It's my shame!
We are on stage to show our life
there is no way to turn back to
our old time

Stand at the ground and watch me
Stand at the ground and judge me
Stand at the ground and see what I have got!

'Cause we got the tragedy
Tell me who am I, than so you'll be wrong
Nobody knows what I do, what I do
Leave me alone and see what I'm able to do
Nobody knows what I do, what I do...
Tell me, tell me what I do, what I do...
