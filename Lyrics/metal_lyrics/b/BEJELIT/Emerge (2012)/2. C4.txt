I cannot breathe there's something strange in the air
I lay low, tread water beneath the surface I wait pray to God I won't hesitate when the time come to strike
Inhuman sounds coming out ...the end is near.

Will they leave me alone?
I must defend my home
this holy place is my own

Got nothing to lose
no one left to abuse
as a martyr I may suffice

So many buttons on this thing but do not know what they do maybe the right one will save my damned life
I'm gonna give it all I got when the  watch strikes two
those ugly fuckers'll turn to blue!

Without delay, freaking die and decay!
Foreign disease invading my bitter innocence
I can't cry for who mastered their own fate.

The stench of the swamp is turning my stomach inside out
Let's see how they react to my little friend
I will blow their reptilian socks off
I will blow gaping holes in their chests
no one left to abuse
as a martyr I may suffice.

So many buttons on this thing but do not know what they do maybe the right one will save my damned life
I'm gonna give it all I got when the  watch strikes two
those ugly fuckers'll turn to blue!

Without delay, freaking die, taste my C4!
This is for my brothers and sisters whose souls you stolen way
not even your shadow remain you've ready to blow for my show
Damned if I do, fucked if I don't ...oh God don't abandon me.
Open fire, drop like flies this is your demise!
