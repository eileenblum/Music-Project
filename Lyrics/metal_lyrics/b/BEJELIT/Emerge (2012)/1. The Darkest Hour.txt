In a world of chaos and anger I fight hard against all
the pain that rolling out from thousands shaded mouths
Thoughts are disturbed by digging in my feverish and so clouded mind
burning disease sowing the darkness' seeds.

Now I can see, I can feel these seeds that grow inside therer is no way  to stem this tide
of absurd flaming darkness that invades my very deep essence.

I'm losing control I just feel so alone
alone in this War waged by my own world.

No way to turn back pulled down deeper and deeper
chained to this hell is this the death of my soul?
Under attack closed to collapse
with no more energies.

Confused and scared my world moves insane
all seems to be infected and oddly neglected

What can I do, to come back to my roots?
Lost in the darkness, dodging the madness
Welcome to my darkest hour!

Floating adrift in the black sea of madness
how many demons are lurking wishing my dark thoughts, wanting my human soul.

Corrupt reasoning's of a decadent system
inner playhouse of human tragedy
inside the mirror of what I am drifting to find my reason's mind.

"Solve this mystery traveler - tell me the reason why you're here.
Stay with me under wasteful shrouds
follow me down in the dark!

Sundry emotions sinful
temptations easily attracted by vision's words
Clear-headed ghosts are whispering
there are reasons to exist.

I'm losing control I just feel so alone
alone in this War waged by my own world.

I feel so tired have enough of this war
but I have to be strong to raise again my soul!
With no more energies.
