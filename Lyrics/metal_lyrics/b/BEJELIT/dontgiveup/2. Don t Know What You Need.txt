I need to change only regression
it's contained into my heart
this is a sensation that I feel you.
I look inside of you I see the world that
I wish to take with my hands
I only want you, to be here

Where os your voice?
What is your choice?
You must think what is best for you
don't be afraid of loneliness.
Heaven can wait they say so
that is not for us us you follow me and I'll know...
Cause I don't know what you want, cause I don't know what you need
the only thing I can say is that we'll go to the hell
I run through fire and flames full of anger into my pain
cause I don't know what you need.

What you need...what you want...cause I don't know!
Cause I don't know what you want cause I don't know what you need
the only thing I can say is that we'll go to the hell
I run through fire and flames full of anger into my pain
cause I don't know what you need.
