Am gonna to tear down all the built walls of my memory just to clean up my deep soul.
I dreamed that dream with no fear just to roll out all my wraps
I will stay a step beyond.
Am gonna fight to come out
I want emerge till I fray
thatâs only me to survive donât wanna have any doubts.

This change is behind
I have to turn it to my side
donât give up, donât give up
wonât give up!
I fooled all my ghosts and erased my yield marks
donât give up, donât give up
till I die.

And now I see another light
all is different on my face
canât you see my revenging smile?
Let tomorrow be my glory
I jumped yet to a better life
this is the only way I wanna stay.
I really fought to come out
I would emerge till I paid
my duties werenât so out the past is eating me.

This change is behind
I have to turn it to my side
donât give up, donât give up
wonât give up!
I fooled all my ghosts and erased my yield marks
donât give up, donât give up
till I die.

Now I see, I carry out donât wanna be back to my suck
to my past and to my faults theyâre breaking out my soul.
I believe there was an edge who moves all my steps away
the wind has changed and I want to follow it now.
I really fought to come out I would emerge till I paid
my duties werenât so out the past is eating me.

This change is behind
I fooled all my ghosts

This change is behind I have to turn it to my side
donât give up, donât give up
wonât give up!
I fooled all my ghosts and erased my yield marks
donât give up, donât give up
till I die.
Donât give it upâ¦donât give it up
Donât give upâ¦till I die.
