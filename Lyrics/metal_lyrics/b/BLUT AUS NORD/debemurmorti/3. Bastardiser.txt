[originally by Pitchshifter]Stagnant reason faceless pain it's in your desperate vein.
Borted fusion lifeless feelings in your borrowed hands.
Breath, let me - let me breath.

Muted waste within the scar thought kills the feeble mind.
Destroy the fear left short to start commence the breed.
Breath, let me - let me breath.

Leave me now you soul polluter, leave me free.
