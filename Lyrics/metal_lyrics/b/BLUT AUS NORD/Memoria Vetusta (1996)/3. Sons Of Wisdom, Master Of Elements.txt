Months of fighting, months of ancestral wars
Weapon throned on tombstone
Strength throned on oath
Great warriors alive in the breath of an ancient wise
Stell with bastards flesh in our thoughts full of hatred
Ceremonial oath in memory
We praised in front of an eternal fire

Old man in cold wind offered us the pure alloy
...And ravens flew in the sky
...And wolves howled in the night

We called the natural forces of earth
We incoqued the God of Knowledge
The old man was initiated us
He taught us wisdom through the ages

Silently, a dark silouette crept...
A shade came near us and told:
"You possess the power of your fathers
...Fathers beyond the stars"

We called the natural forces of earth
We incoqued the God of Knowledge
We called the soul of the great army
We called the soul of death beyond clouds

In  memory of our deceased brothers
We praised in front of an eternal fire

...And ravens flew in the sky
...And wolves howled in the night
Old man in cold wind offered us a great destiny
