Fathers! From your mighty world
Fathers! We saw your tears of gold
Messengers in the night! We saw your drawing
in the sky 
Wolves! We heard your song beyond the mountains

We eternally danced on the ruins, in a land of wisdom

In the name of forests
In the name of stars
In the name of all the seas
In the name of all storms

We praised the magical knowledge

We were on the wat of blood and fire
With a sea of corpses in the valley

In memory of our tribe we were alive
Proud sons of ancient nation
Proud sons of sacred song in the wind
Proud sons behind a mirror of ice who told
"Fathers of the icy age"
...In remembrance...
