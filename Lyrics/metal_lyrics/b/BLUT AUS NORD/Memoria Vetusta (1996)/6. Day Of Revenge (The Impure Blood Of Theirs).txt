War! Revenge's day has come, let's spill 
the blood of the bastard

In front of us the vast towers of the Maganst's 
castle pierced the
nocturnal beauty of the starry sky
The rays of the fullmoon enlighted the sinister
gargolyes of stones

Power in our eyes, hate and blood in our veins
We were in the last battle
In honour of our pride and gods
We praised the steel of our mighty sword

Excited by the view of this bloody carnage
The wolves howled on the mountain of wisdom
Mistress of the mist, received all the dead

In the land of eternal twilight 
We saw a great gap in the ground
Mother Earth, received all the corpses

War!
Revenge's day has come, let's spill the blood of
the bastard

Human flesh of steel
Ancient nation we heard your song
We had your life in our veins
In memory of your cult, we crushed

War!
The domain beyond the stars
Forest, land and sea beyond hate
Cried from freedom
