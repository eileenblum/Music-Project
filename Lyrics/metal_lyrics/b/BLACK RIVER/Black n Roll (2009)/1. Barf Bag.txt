It's high time we started living
Time to take, stop forbidding
time to steal, time to dance
Nobody knows if we get another chance

How many pills should I take to sleep?
How many drinks should I pour to think?
How many whores should I pay to forget?
How many people will I have to offend?

How many noses will I have to crack?
To make you understand that people don't change
How many souls will I have to hurt?
How many virgins should I deflorate?

I'm a self centered vain egoist
Take me as I am or get the fuck outta way
Blame me for all sick on earth
I create a lot but i was made to take

Cuz every step we all make
Is leading us exactly the same way
Is blindly pushing us straight to the grave!

It's high time we started living
Time to take, stop forbidding
time to steal, time to dance
Nobody knows if we get another chance

How many shots do you wanna drink?
How many grams do you want me to bring?
By the power of no one I am taking to lead
Until we are forced to abandon the ship

It's high time we started living
Time to take, stop forbidding
time to steal, time to dance
Nobody knows if we get another chance

It's high time we started living
Time to take, stop forbidding
time to steal, time to dance
Nobody knows if we get another chance
