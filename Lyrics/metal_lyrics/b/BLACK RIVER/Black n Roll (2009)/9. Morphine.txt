Morphine
Oh, how can you not see?
Morphine
White love from my dream

Faster
I feel better with you
Harder
Wait so long for a dream

When I crawl across the floor,
You're just watching me, my pain

I'm bleeding now. I'm bleeding fast
I want to know

How quick, how fast my love
You will give me my last wish, last chance,
redeem me

I'm running out [x2]
I'm running out of breath,
I'm running out [x2]
I'm running out of life

I'm crawling across the floor
You're just watching me, my pain

I'm bleeding now, I'm bleeding fast
I want to know

How quick, how fast my love
You will give my last wish, last chance,
redeem me

Stop the pain, I don't care about money
Come on, come on! Give me this shot, honey

You should take to me, miss morphine
Cause you are my last chance, miss morphine

And when I'll crawl across the floor
You'll raise my hand, lst chance, no more
And you will not let me die
Better get it right first time

Stop the pain, I don't care about money
Come on, come on! Give me this shot, honey

And when I'll crawl across the floor
You'll raise my hand, lst chance, no more
And you will not let me die
Better get it right first time

And when I'll crawl across the floor
You'll raise my hand, lst chance, no more
And you will not let me die
Better get it right first time
