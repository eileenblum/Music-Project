They call you a problem child
Since you were born to fight
With the sleepless night

A misfit, young and wild
Don't build the wall inside
Or you'll never get out from...

What's in your mind
Did you ever think about truth?
Can you live your life for real?

Don't build the wall
Live your life and think about truth
Get out from the dark and fear

They want to change your way
Teaching you through lies
And what a real, true life should be

A misfit, young and wild
Don't build the wall inside
Or you'll never get out from...

Don't build the wall
Live your life and think about truth
Get out from the dark and fear

Break down the wall
Get out and live

Don't build the wall
Live your life and think about truth
Get out from the dark and fear

Break down the wall
Get out and live
