You don't need to say it
I fire myslef, so don't bother honey
I'm like part time worker
Doing job for your company

Here are the news I can't stand your wisdom
I doubt your power, your beauty and style
You tried so hard but you never made it
I still can find friends on my side

You don't need to say it
I know your words by heart
I'm not involved no more
I'm leaving it all behind
