I'm from nowhere
Deep, dark water

I can leave you
When i want to...

Always young &amp; drunk
Always young &amp; drunk
Always young &amp; drunk
Drifting nowhere

You follow to me
Tears flew down to you

Drinking always
From your Blackness

You know that i'm drunk

Always young &amp; drunk
Want to be me
Always young &amp; drunk
I can be free

You saw the black scenes, from the darkness
You saw the dark minds, from my whispers
And when I close my eyes
I'll be on the black side
And when you are still young
I'll still be drunk

You saw the black scenes, from the darkness
You saw the dark minds, from my whispers

Always young &amp; drunk
Always young &amp; drunk
