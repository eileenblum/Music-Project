When I come alive, and blood is running hot, so hot, that you can feel
When I stand behind, your back, breathing so hard, that you can hear
You don't know, what can happen now, what electric sings, I'll send to you
You never walk alone, feeling me near, so close till you get scared

You're looking around but too far away
I'm so close to you
You're looking around but too far away
I'm so close to you
You're looking around but too far away
Looking around but too far away
Looking around but too far away

When I feel your skin, so close to mine, so near, yet so far
When I see how, you suffer feeling me, I should leave you and go away

You're looking around but too far away
I'm so close to you
You're looking around but too far away
I'm so close to you
You're looking around but too far away
Looking around but too far away
Looking around but too far away

You're looking around but too far away
You're looking around but too far away

You're looking around but too far away
I'm so close to you
You're looking around but too far away
I'm so close to you
You're looking around but too far away
Looking around but too far away
Looking around but too far away

When I come alive and my blood is running hot
When I see how you suffer feeling me
