You love looking in the mirror
You love when they stare at you
You like dealing with the devil
You re lucky in hell

How much you won
And how rich you are
Greed gives you more
Your wish is a spell

You have no soul
You re unpredictable
You burn like a torch
You, you wanna get more
Till the end od days
Be everywhere, be know everywhere

You need another
You will get another
You ve got a message
You will get more, more, more

You hot dreams   now   hot and real
Your hot desires, hot and real

I will keep you dark till the end of time

You come from nowhere
You have no soul
Your home in the mirror
Your life full of visions

You
