Lift your face up from the ground
make fun of everything around
dance like junkies in purple eden
I don't care, I'm there in black heaven

Look on kids walking the streets
the faces older, hands stronger
But where's the smile, where is their play?
Oh fuck, you turned the wrong way

Don't believe in what you saw
You are pissed off with everything
Your life, your work, a soul
I suggest you let it slide

Can't believe in what you saw
You're pissed off with everything
Your life, your work, a soul
I think you need to get a life

Lift your face up from the ground
Just make fun of everything around
Or dance like junkies in dark purple eden
I don't care causc I'm there in black heaven

Look around, there is a pile of shit
Nice people stink so bad, indeed
Nice people think they play the game
Hey girl you turned the wrong way

Can't believe in what you saw
You're pissed off with everything
Your life, your work, a soul
I suggest you let it slide

Can't believe in what you saw
You're pissed off with everything
Your life, your work, a soul
I think you need to get a life

Never you, no more life [x4]

LET IT SLIDE FREE
GET A LIFE
Be free!

Isabel [x6]
