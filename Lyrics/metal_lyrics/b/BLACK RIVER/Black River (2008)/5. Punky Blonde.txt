You are, youve been and you will always be the one 
my dream, my desire the sense of my life 
be mine, be now when i see you i get higher 
one smile one glance- and you light the fire 

It's my life, its my fate my love and pain 
my redemption and hope 
no one can only you the one in the universe 
to make me feel im alive 
go my way 
make me feel 

I know and everybody 
knows you are not for me 
you have only my dream hellish unreal 

Quick quick quick love me 
or never let me feel it 
my heart like dum-dum 
love and hate in fire 

It's my life its my fate my love and pain 
my redemption and hope 
no one can only you the one in the universe 
to make me feel im alive but i know... 
im all right im all right im all right im all right but i feel it [x4]
love and hate
