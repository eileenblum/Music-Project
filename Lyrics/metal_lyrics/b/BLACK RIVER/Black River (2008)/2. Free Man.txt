I cannot breathe 
I cannot flee 
All I see inside you 
Go around, unsafe, with you again 
I feel, I hear your madness 

Expect it 
Im coming 
Be careful 
Im cominig 
Be careful 
Im coming 
Be careful 
My coming 

That life is dead 
Im beginnig new 
m gonna kill my memory 
will destroy all that is yours 
cannot lose my freedom 

cannot breathe 
) cannot flee 
en youre so close behind me

an kill you baby 

ou) never never never know

e of you 
e of us 
ll experience madness

that life is dead 
(Im) beginning new 
Im gonna kill my memory 
I will destroy 
All that is yours 
I cannot lose my freedom
