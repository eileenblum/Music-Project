Another day of fear 
Another faced without you 
Another days so weird 
Coz I'm lost without you 

In the land of overwhelming grief 
My days move slowly on 

I'm a prisoner of never - ending silence 
(The) silence (you) left behind you 
How I grieve 

Whispers in my ear 
Words unsaid surround me 
I still feel you,feel so near 
(And) I'm sa lost without you 

All that is gone 
Will remain forever 
In (the) deepest silence 
Of my heart 

And now I know 
You are gone forever 
You are gone but let me dream 

Oh,silence 
The only gift from you 
In my heart 

Hearts soon die,deprived of hope 
I am dying 
Without you 

Come ano hold me now I'm falling 
Stay and save me now I'm falling 
I'm falling down the empty silence 
Your silence 

Oh,let me dream of the word unspoken 
Of your hands and warm embrance 
Of what I never got from you 
Of our being together 
Let me dream to set me free 

At least just let me dream 
Of those words unspoken 
To dream to set me free 
In never-ending silence 

I dream to set me free 
In never-ending silence 
The world is tumbling down 
without you
