Day after day you try to see more
But here, but now you're a speck of dust, you mean nothing
You should know that everything is gone
Your power, your real is going to... going away

You know how I feel
Loud, louder, speak to me louder
Every moment, my thoughts are real
Loud, louder, speak to me louder
How could you do this, do it to me?
You made a fool out of me all the time
Plaing with me your false game (x2)
Now, confess louder, speak to me louder

Day after day you try to see more
But here, but now you're a speck of dust, you mean nothing
You should know that everything is gone
Your power, your real is going to... going away

Enough of this game, my anger has grown
We have to know what's fucking going on
I'm really mad, I don't regret
Any of my deeds and my thoughts anymore
Back to reality, to understand
A part of me and a part of you
This is the time to speak it all out
We're gonna have a little chat
