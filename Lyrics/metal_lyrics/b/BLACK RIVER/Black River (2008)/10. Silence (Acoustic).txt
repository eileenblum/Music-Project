[Bonus Track]Another day of fear
Another faced without you
Another days so weird
Coz I'm lost without you

In the land of overwhelming grief
My days move slowly on

I'm a prisoner of never - ending silence
(The) silence (you) left behind you
How I grieve

Whispers in my ear
Words unsaid surround me
I still feel you,feel so near
(And) I'm so lost without you

All that is gone
Will remain forever
In (the) deepest silence
Of my heart

And now I know
You are gone forever
You are gone but let me dream

Oh,silence
The only gift from you
In my heart

Hearts soon die,deprived of hope
I am dying
Without you

Come and hold me now I'm falling
Stay and save me now I'm falling
I'm falling down the empty silence
Your silence

Oh,let me dream of the word unspoken
Of your hands and warm embrace
Of what I never got from you
Of our being together
Let me dream to set me free

At least just let me dream
Of those words unspoken
To dream to set me free
In never-ending silence

I dream to set me free
In never-ending silence
The world is tumbling down
without you
