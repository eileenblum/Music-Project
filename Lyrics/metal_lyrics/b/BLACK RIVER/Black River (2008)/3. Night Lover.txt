The woman smiles
We could be together
Keep on holding you
Back in your arms

When you have a broken heart...
And this is my fault...

Can't you reach out for... me?
Do you really want to feel?

One night - I don't know how...
One girl - I don't know the name...
I didn't ask her name (again)
And she didn't know mine
It was only once, without names...
I don't remember cause I was drunk

One night - I don't know how...
One girl - I don't know the name...
I didn't ask her name (again)
And she didn't know mine
It was only once,
I don't remember which night and where...

You see it's all real
Yes, I've cheated on you again
Cause I can't love strong
I can't breathe
Be together
Always, forever

One night - I don't know how...
One girl - I don't know the name...
I didn't ask her name (again)
And she didn't know mine as well
It was only once, one night, without names...
