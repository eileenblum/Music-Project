How far has it gone, I don't care, yeah...
My private hell, do not shout, don't bleat

No need to lie, now you've found yourself
You gonna taste it, bite it

Running away from... not so easy
Honey, I'll be waiting in the fire

Show me your love as I like it
I'm blinded by the street light

Look at me
Do you see the enemy?
I don't buy what you say, there is no other way
You must sit here, face to face with your fate.
One way you're gonna fail
Stay here full and alone for the next time when I come for...

Enemies, you and me, you build a wall inside
You and me, enemies, all the ways you hate me
Some will take, some will see
Every part of you, in other words
You're for sale and I'm buying you

Running away from... not so easy
Honey, I'll be waiting in the fire

Show me your love as I like it
I'm blinded by the street light

You must feel it, it's something we all know
You must feel it, it's something we all know
Know... your enemy now... your enemy
