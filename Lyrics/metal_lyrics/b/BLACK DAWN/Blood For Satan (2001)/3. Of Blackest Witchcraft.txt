Come, infernal, terristial, and heavenly hosts
Goddess of the (broad) high ways, of the crossroads

Thou who goest (to and fro) at night, torch in hand
Enemy of the day, friend and lover of darkness

Thou who art walking amid the phantom and in the place of tombs
Thou whose thirst is blood
Thou who dost strike chill fear into mortal heart

Gorgo, mormo, moon of a thousand forms
Cast a propitious eye upon our sacrifice
