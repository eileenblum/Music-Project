Burn not the woods
Destroy not the stones
The temple can be rebuilt
The stones can be replaced

Burn flesh and skin
Destroy their putrid kin
Flesh can't be rebuilt
Skin can't be replaced

Fire
Burning in our hearts
Engulfs jehovah's kin
Darkly burning flames
Lick the holy skin

Lick the holy skins to black

Burn, all, burn!
Unleash the purifying flames
