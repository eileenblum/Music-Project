Seek thy demon
And (you shall) learn of his foul ways
Feel the worms
As they creep

Evil most foul, most corrupt, most hideous

Dream of the fires
And they will enfold thee
Hear the voices
As they seek in (the great) darkness
Suffer the crush
Of the old as they rise
Lose thy senses
Yet (shall you) know them when they come

Evil most foul, most corrupt, most hideous

Seek thy demon and (you shall) learn of his foul ways

Behold (the terors and the) horrors
In the great pit
Thirst in (the wide) rivers
Of blood of our altars

Evil most foul, most corrupt, most hideous

Know all the torments
Of the pit and the daemons
Which are evil
Most foul (and most abominable)
Than all the others
When ye in thy dreams seek (to devise)
For the pit holds
Them everyone
