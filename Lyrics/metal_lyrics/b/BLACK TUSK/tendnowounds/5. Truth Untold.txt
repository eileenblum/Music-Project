a waning sky a chilling breath embrace the night
fortunes eyes far from here all is blind
to be without you mustn't cry the time is near
for the dark truth untold your cursed soul

unseen evil in the shadows

the arrival of times unworthy behold the future
in days of woe shadows shall rise

to live unseen without a glance i throw my hands
fortunes claws raise your soul the cost is high
to be without you mustn't cry the time is near
for the dark truth untold your cursed soul

piercing eyes shadows arise
