six, six, six
bring me darkness and thunder
my malevolent will
at the root of my evil
upon blood I will spill
at this altar I stand
with this knife in my hand
at my palace of skulls
bringing plague to this land
slaying of virgins
no need to cry
scream if you want to
it's time to die
feeding my sickness
blood now will pour
bring me to darkness
forever more
