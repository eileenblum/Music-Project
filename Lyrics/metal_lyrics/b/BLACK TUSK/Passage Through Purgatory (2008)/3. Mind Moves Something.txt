Tear you down to the way I fell
Till there's nothing left of you
Gave all I had to a worthless cause
Now I'm sick of myself again
Eyes see nothing
Bloodshot
Mind moves something
Emptiness
Under mimed for the very last time
As a sickness spreads over me
Sick and tired of this place and time
You can punch the clock I'm through
Eyes see nothing
Bloodshot
Mind moves something
Emptiness
Mind can't break free
Soul trapped inside
Anger consumes me
Used for the last time
