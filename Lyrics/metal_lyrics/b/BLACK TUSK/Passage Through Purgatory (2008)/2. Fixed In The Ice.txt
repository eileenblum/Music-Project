Abandon all hope
Pass into a world of fire
Trapped by the beast of malice and fraud
The lion of violence
The she-wolf of lust
Face the demons
That bind my soul
Trust to reason
There's nothing divine
Fixed in the ice
I am the way to the city of woe
I am the way to a forsaken people
I am the way into eternal sorrow
Beyond time I stand
