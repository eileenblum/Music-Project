Time is coming
Heed the sound
Rip your face off
Thrash around

No use fighting
You can't run
Bursting through you
Like a gun

Storm is brewing
No control
Embrace the madness
In your soul

Black to black
Tusk to tusk
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust

Make your ears bleed

Crash of thunder
Summon rain
Thrash the stage
Into flames
