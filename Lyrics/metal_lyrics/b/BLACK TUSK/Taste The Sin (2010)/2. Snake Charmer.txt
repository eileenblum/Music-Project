Slithering down
From righteous skies
Look in its eyes
So divine

Nectar of gods
Symbol of lust
Knowledge of all
Just out of grasp

Serpent of hell
Satan
Taste of the flesh
Come down

Ignorant bliss
Taste the sin
Weakness of men
Sacrifice

From my side
In due time
Opened my eyes
Hunger for more

Charmed by the snake
And thou be damned
