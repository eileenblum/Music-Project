Take off
Hammer down, swerve, roaring sound
Steel frame bends, southern bound

I stand lone, this is mine
Kick up dust, on my quest for speed
Breath runs short, adrenaline
See the heat, running red

Lead sled rips through the night
Life or death, on my quest for speed
ON my way, nothing can stop me now
Sacrifice, all that has left me now
