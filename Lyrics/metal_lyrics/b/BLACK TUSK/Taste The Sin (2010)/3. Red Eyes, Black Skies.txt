Running through the mist, knee deep snow drifts
Lungs tight, heart pounds, cannot back down
Hear them stalking, hot breathe, dark night, fear rips inside, no place to hide.

Surrounded, trap down, first light, last dawn, their howls draw near, their hunt, my fear
Teeth shine, blood drips, fangs curl, snarled lips, slain by the beast, all hell unleashed.

Red eyes, black skies
Red paints the land, signs of my last stand
Time to feed once again.
