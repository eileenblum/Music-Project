Too far, journey has come to an end
Times up, no chance to repent for my sins
Lights out, far from heaven so send me to Hell
Fuck you, this is my final farewell
Devil on my shoulder, bold and getting bolder
Devin on my shoulder, cold and getting colder
Wreckage, a mass of twisted steel
Glory, hands are still stuck to the wheel
Ain't goin slow!
