see things different 
no choice now 
band in arms 
choose your side 
blue and grey 
fades today 
doesn't matter 
all runs red 
won't back down 
stand and fight 
stand and fight 
won't back down 
victory 
but at what cost 
turn my back 
fought my own 
pride kills pride 
rift of men 
side by side 
feuding kin 
pride kills pride 
rift of men 
side by side 
not again
