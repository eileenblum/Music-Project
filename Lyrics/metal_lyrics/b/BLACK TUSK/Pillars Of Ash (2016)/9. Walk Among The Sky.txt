You will never know, true believers see
Altars left in time, shadowed in secrecy
Lone in the night, all cloaked in white
Together we pray, the moon will not fade
Hands to the right, beacon of light
Chanting will rise, pledging our lives
Planets align tonight, stars are shining bright
Time is drawing nigh, hold the chalice high
Just a sip away, faith the only way
Weâre prepared to die, walk among the sky
We are prepared to die, we walk among the still sky
We are prepared to die, we walk alone in the sky
