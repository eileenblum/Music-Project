They try to shun the truth, poisoning your mind
Infect a part of you, scared of what you'll find
Kill your point of view, take it all away
Youâre not of yourself, you're of what I say
Give unto me
See through my eyes
Bleed on your knees
Feed me your lies
Giver of life
Giver of lies
Give me your eyes
Bow
All hail the king
And now the stage is set
On with the show
Just another sheep in the pack
Surrender all you know
As my spirit drifts, through the worlds of black
I've pledged my life, no turning back
Taste of fruits I should not taste
And leave my soul in lands of waste
Soon to die, open wide
Swallow down, dead inside
