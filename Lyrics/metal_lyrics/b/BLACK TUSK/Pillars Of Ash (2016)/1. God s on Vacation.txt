Here we go again, a sigh left for the end
Rise to fall back down, Losing what I've found
Good times and mutilation
God took a vacation
Self-worth and frustration
Everything so wasted
God's on vacation
Deceived by what you you've said, stuck inside my head
Some way Iâve been misled, the more I'm living, the more I'm dead
Nothings left, now itâs gone, all thatâs left, a fucking hole
Thought I had it, should've known, this is how, to kill your soul
