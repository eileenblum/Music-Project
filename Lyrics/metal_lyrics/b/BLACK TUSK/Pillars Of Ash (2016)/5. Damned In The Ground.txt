My Time is here, nothing to fear
Actions will speak, louder than words
My shell lies here, stuck in the ground
Short of its breath, for death Iâm bound
The road to the damned is paved with good intentions
Our end is a dark shroud draped and hanging over
In a dead manâs eyes, cannot hear a sound
Cold here and alone, damned in the ground
My shell lies here, stuck in the ground
Short of its breath, for death Iâm bound
