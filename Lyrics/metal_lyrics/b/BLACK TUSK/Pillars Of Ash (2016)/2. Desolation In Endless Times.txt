Alone with empty minds
A scheme a plan unwinds
Blank and vacant stares
Enter the abyss unaware
Unfold the master plan
Control the endless times
Your life, your every word
Nothing left unclaimed
In temples, no solitude
The wretched all consume
This fight, no good will stand
Your soul under command
No one bows and prays
Your shell castaway
Shadows he controls
The desolation of souls
