Whispering words, colour the air
Incarnated harmonies,
The atmosphere appear

Swear forever to secrecy
Under ode, on odyssey
Memories built up through the tears
Germate further into fear

Born out of flesh and blood
Sustain my soul, mentally lost
Neverending obedience
Substance of misery

My dying bleeding heart
Blows away in an emotional dream
Body can't set me free
Thoughts creates misery

In emptiness remains
What can I do, what can I do
I can't deny, I can't deny
The blood I bleed. the blood I bleed
I'm still alive... alive
