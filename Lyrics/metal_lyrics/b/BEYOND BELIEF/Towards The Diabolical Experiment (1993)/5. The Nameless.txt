The mourning process revelates, the sun embraced in black
Misery shows, what the hell can cause the hellish truth

Invocation, come forth God
touch us, the human race
Behold the sufferings
for hell is here, so low
Open wide the gates
to enter the human terror
A domain cursed to be forgotten
memories of a dying shore
Rattering innocent souls
Infernal chaotic mourning
Shattering the entire area
this is the pain and the loss

Crushing, smashing
the threshold of disaster
As they're bleeding and we fear
damnation of creation
Mortality has been proved
but our life goes on

Come forth from the abyss
a blaze in red, the open sky
Travelling on seas of blood
voyage reached the ultimate destination

Crushing, smashing
the threshold of disaster
As they're bleeding and we fear
damnation of creation
Mortality has been proved
but our life goes on
As the skin burns away
nothing but trauma remains, remains

Touching white sands, leaving traces of atrocity behind, testify
Four high walls, begin to speak and look me in the eye with disgust
Moving figures, keep on dancing in the shadow of the walls, surrounded
Growing cold, as I enter outward from... a hellish void
