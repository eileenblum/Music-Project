Isolation. desolation
Salvation, the rotten way
Suicidal solitude, don't slip away
I have come to be, the light of the end
Feeling lost soul controlled

Cursed by god, I walk with fear
Changes beyond, forced into my mind
Bleeding my tears, burning outside
Turn away, deny the whore

I saw sacrifices before my eyes
now I know about the end
Bleeding my tears, burning outside
Turn away, deny the whore

The pain has gone much to far now,
judge me not, make it STOP!

I saw sacrifices before my eyes
now I know about the end... is near
