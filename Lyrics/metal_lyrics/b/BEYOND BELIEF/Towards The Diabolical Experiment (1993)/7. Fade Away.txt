Take away, the fallen one
on God's creation
he torns my soul
He's to blame for our pain
rides in glory, into fame

Sorrow, misery,
is this reality
The earth is fade to die

We struggle on in this faith
the heart is full, full with hate
trying to change our way
turn the night into day

There's things in life that keep on wonder
as the answer lies deep in time
and when one finally short things out
it won't be worth a dime

Don't spend your life doing nothing
the truth is hard to find
and time has come to share
in memories and... pride
