The power of victory has come
to share our fellings and emotions
When all sins have been done
and nothing has remained

Last and lonely, as we dwell
Into chaos, into hell
Moving closer towards the end
while the bastard is waiting for me

Darkened power, for humanity fails
drifting into darkness, as we fell

Ancient wisdom is for real
Prophetic countdown, while I kneel

At the end of time, all is cold and black
In this final void blackened blood remains
Mystic darkness falls, cold and barren rules
never ending tears,
falling out the spine,
spilling holy wine, wine, wine...
