Universe of overthroned happiness
share with me this red blood heaven
Overwhelmed by infidelity
explore your body... to me

Screen your soul
against the realms of God
enter now, the demon's game

The horror, the feast has just begun
Sweet symphonies,
we dance to the blasphemies
Symbolic seance, enlightened in black
In ecstasy, I deflowered... the whore

Away your virginity
feast of the vile
Idolize the thought's no more
demanding fears to kneel
Meeting with the earth
shreds of the shroud
Enjoyment of the flesh
satisfy my lust

Screen your soul
against the realms of God
enter now, the demon's game
