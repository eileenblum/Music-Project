Holy great guillotine, I gave you a part of me. Not my heart, not my chin. Holy great guillotine you ate almost all my dreams. I'm condamned to lose something I cherish. And to let it all go in a mutual contentment, watching the floor get closer to my face. And there has been no trial, something to get what happens to me. nothing but silence, and silence signs my end. Death to the guillotine. We lose and share the emptiness of all passions and cares. In the end, am I just allows to breath? Among no head bodies, other no head bodies. On our necks a better people would sail and they would have fun for sure, and we would endure it without wanting to know more. My end will be where it's supposed to be, I know.
