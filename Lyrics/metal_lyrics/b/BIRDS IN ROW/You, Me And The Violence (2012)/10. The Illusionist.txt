With my hands tied up and my body sinking into the sea. I'll still escape from this. Put me in a box, and then I disappear. I'm the illusionist. Beware of your pockets, I'm not the one who can be trusted. Just a pretender. What you are sure to see, what I give you to believe. A wall of smoke to hide the fact that I don't even believe in magic. But the important thing is to show people way more than you know. With a hand moving and a good piece of plastic I'll make you believe in anything. And I already love the image of myself you reflect every night of my life. I'm fake, and it seems I like it.
