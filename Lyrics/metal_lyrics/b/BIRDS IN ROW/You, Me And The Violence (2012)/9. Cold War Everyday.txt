I want to dance til the dawn of a new day. Just like the rat on the cradle of a new city. And get the appetite of a bulimic bear facing the promise a close famine. Broken wooden horses for only ride and a million of chances to take. My tangible fears sleeping on my knees til this journey does end. Too tired of making war. To realistic for peace. A 'never again, never again!' to the beats leading me to defeat. Some of you would say I'm a coward, sneaking away from down-to-earth matters. Run coward, run. Don't tell me what to do. Run faster, run. If only I could break down the system.
