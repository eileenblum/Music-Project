Underestimated and over-jaded. With a constant feeling of kissing the ground. And a bitter taste of non-personal failures going down. The liars have never told about growing up as being a self-resignation. You can climb the hill or just die trying. So many lost their lives in the boredom of waiting. You have to choose your side. And I'm done with playing cops, I'm done with queueing, I swear I'll try to be free. Give the power to the thieves. Love live the robbery and love live the crime. Those who tarnished their name for the sake of their life. And as there is a side for which we need to choose, I choose the one where you're told to lose.
