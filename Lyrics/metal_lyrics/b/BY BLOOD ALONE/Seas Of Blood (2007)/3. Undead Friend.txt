You are scratching at my door
You want me to let you in
But i just can't pretend
That you aren't my undead friend
Flesh is falling off your bones
While you stand in front of me
Moaning all through the night
Causing a dreadful fright

I know that you just want to be
Right by my side but you can't see
That you can't stay
Now please go away
I know this world you will not miss
You only long for my warm kiss
You will have to go
'Cause i told you so

The gods call to you now
A full life you've had until now
They are calling
Don't ignore them
You have served very well
On this world or maybe your hell?
You should not care
About staying here
You should not care
About staying here

Slowly the night turns to morn
Just so it can be reborn
You lay face on the ground
Body's a boney mound
Finally your souls at rest
No longer my nightly pest
You look down form the sky
And i sing this mournful cry

I know that you just longed to be
Right by my side and now you see
That you can't stay
You are on your way
The memory of your embrace
Will keep a smile upon my face
Even though your dead
Flying high instead

The souls stumble through night
Causing loved ones turn on house-lights
It is widespread
Nightly undead
I know soon i'll be free
To join you and then i will be
And old body
Slowly rotting
