Deep within the earth
In the misty netherworld
Lies a great dragon
He's coiled around the wells
From which the waters flow
To nourish all the lands

He feeds upon the dead
As they journey down
Way down below
He gnaws upon the roots
Of the mighty tree
Only to destroy it

I am the old dragon
Death and resurrection
The light and all the dark
The heavens and the earth

He has no creation
Existing only to
Bring the world to it's end
Chaos gives him aid
In his daily plight
To drive the tree to ashes

The day of reckoning
Is coming to a head
Chaotic and destructive
The hearts of gods and men
Will cause the cosmic end
Laying waste around them

I am the old dragon
Death and resurrection
The light and all the dark
The heavens and the earth

From the mighty depths
Will rise the great nidhogg
The dragon who reigns high and low
He will rise above
The wasteland left behind
Before decending down again

In that greatest void
What's left left of the world
Gives birth to a daughter
The tree will grow again
Bringing life throughout
To feed the hungry monster
