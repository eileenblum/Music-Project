You are so cold and filled with hate
I can help you if you want
I try to tell you this is not your fate
I am your true confidant

The pain consumes your life you cannot see
That i will be there for you through the dark
You only feel the hurt i cannot make
You see that i have it too everyday
What happens when your love
Just pushes you away
Do you question your life
And all of your lonely days

Your fears fill up your skull with it's lies
Candy coating all your pain
You think i won't see or hear your cries
Your thoughts will drive you insane

Will you just take my hand i want to save you from
A life where hearts never mend
Just try to let me in you do not know that i need you
Just as much as you need me
What happens when your love
Just pushes you away
Do you question your life
And all of your lonely days

What happens when the wind stops blowin
Does dust collect around you?
What happens when the water stops flowin
Do your wounds stop their bleeding?
What happens when the cold creeps up on you
Do your limbs lose all feeling?
What happens if she doesn't love you
Will your heart start to seize?

I know what you'd do
Deny yourself love deny yourself joy
Deny yourself happiness
Live your life in pain
