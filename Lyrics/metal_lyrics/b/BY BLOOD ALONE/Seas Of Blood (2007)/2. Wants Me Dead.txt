Life inspires my dread death is a warm bed
I know it will be the end for me soon?
He'll have to wait for it don't like it one bit
He will not be pleased if i don't come to him?.

I feel his breath he wants me dead

My lover calls to me i will ignore his plea
Until it is time for me to leave this life
His screams do torment he is not patient
I am forced to leave before it's my time

I know you were so sad and so lonely
I am glad to see you did long for me
Will you take my hand
Cause that is what you planned
