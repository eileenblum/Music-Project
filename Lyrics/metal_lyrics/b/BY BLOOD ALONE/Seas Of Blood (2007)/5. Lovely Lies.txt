You walk thru my door i can't believe that you
That you stand in my way again
I told you once before that i don't want your love
To hold me back and then

You fall to your knees begging me please
To take you back into my heart
I will not stand for i won't hear more
Lovely lies fall from your mouth

It won't be that easy to forgive your sins
I hate you despise you just leave me alone

You fall to your knees begging me please
To take you back into my heart
I don't want your face to enter my space
Cause i don't love you any more

I won't be the one to save you from yourself
You are no more to me go back to your own hell

I cannot wait to free myself
You have been drowning me
In a black ocean
Dragging me down

I used to dream before we met
Now when i close my eyes
I just see your face
Staring into my soul
