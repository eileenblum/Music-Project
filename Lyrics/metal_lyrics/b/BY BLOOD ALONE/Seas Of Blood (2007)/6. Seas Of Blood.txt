The morning comes as we sit by the rocks
I then, walk with you slowly down to the docks
We then, press our lips and say our goodbyes
You then, stroke my face and dry my eyes

You said that this is the last time you'll go
And i, feel so scared more than you'll ever know
The sky goes dark as your ship pulls away
My fears grow strong they've haunted me for days

The seas swell and rush on the decks
Your ship is tossed around in the depths
Your soul rises up, ship descends
Seas of blood, strikes again
Seas of blood, nasty friend
Seas of blood, brings the end

The days go by and the nights fall away
And there's, no word from you sure and calm i must stay
I try to sleep my thoughts keep me wide awake
I close my eyes to picture your face

I hope i will see you home in my dreams
I know, life flashes by in a moment it seems
I hear your voice you whisper in my ear
"i love you so, and in my heart you'll always be. "

The seas swell and rush on the decks
Your ship is tossed around in the depths
Your soul rises up, ship descends
Seas of blood, strikes again
Seas of blood, nasty friend
Seas of blood, brings the end
