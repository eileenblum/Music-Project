The 12 signs don't align as they scurry cross the sky
70 or more are simply forgotten
What's this 13th sign? Honored only for his plight
Interpreting the dreams of those around him

As we look up to the sky so high
We correlate our lives with the night
As we calmly lie each night
Serpentarius we try

The eagle made his way to strike him down and end his days
Pluto wielding a great bolt of thunder
He chose to raise the dead healing sick with serpent hands
Robbing hell of it's due souls heading under

Answers that we search inside to find
Reveal themselves to us causing fright
As we slowly die each night
Serpentarius we try to find the light

As we live our separate lives no ties
The universe survives spanning time
As we calmly lie this night
Serpentarius we die to find the light
