In my dreams we have to run
They do chase us and thatâs just no fun
We have to fight there is no choice
Stand up to them and fight them one to one
We must not let our fears control us
We will fight fight for our lives
Until the dawn of our great sun

This is when they try to get us

Tear our flesh but we donât let them
Close to us and we do fight them
Every night and we wonât fail Again

In my dreams we walk to slow
Taking paths we should not go
We know itâs not itâs not the way
The way to find our safe homes
Itâs so hard to find the right way
We are led by something else
Far beyond what we know

When I awake you are not here
I am so sad I had a big scare
Iâm all alone with all my fears
Itâs so hard to hold back The tears
I just see you only in my head
That is where I will find
You all alone weâre such a pair

I just see you when I slumber

In my dreams Iâll only see you
When I sleep there is no other
Every night and we wonât fail
