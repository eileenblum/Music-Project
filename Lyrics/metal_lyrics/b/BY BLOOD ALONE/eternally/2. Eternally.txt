Into the darkness
I feel him coming
Towards me slowly inside
My heart skips a beat
I canât fight the urge
To be near him always

Find me and take my soul bleed me
I give my life to you eternally

The night covers me
I donât feel the warmth
In me flowing inside
My thirst controls me
The hunger binds me
To you always

I donât feel the pain
That I had in life
No more hurting Inside
You are all I need your touch
It comforts me
It will always

I choose to be with you my dear
Iâve found peace not held by fear
You are my love I wonât pretend
Iâve found my one true friend
