[Intro:]
I will devour my enemies
I shall turn the waters into blood
And smite the earth with plague
I am from the pit and made to war
And the dead bodies shall be piled in the streets of Sodom
I will cut out the tongues of all nations
If you want me to be the devil, then the devil I will be

What price my soul?
The martyr's weapon
I have toiled so long
And searched the faces
Of the fallen
Maybe there is no god but man

No matter
The traps are set
This is the martyrs brigade

The strong arm of faith
There is no wall high enough
To stop one man and his will
And his calling

And there will follow with me hail and fire mingled with the blood as I was cast upon the earth, I am the mountain burning with fire and the sea of blood

I am the star that fell from heaven, burning like a lamp

I will make the waters bitter and smite the sun, moon and stars

I am the darkening day and the trumpet about to sound

Vengeance

I am torment of scorpion and the shape of locus
With the teeth of lions and breath of brimstone
Repent repent repent for the day is here

I never had another question
That could not be answered by violence
I hear the masters voice
Calling me to war
