I'm not sure if I can explain or explain it properly
But I saw a crucifix, and a star of david, 
and a crescent moon burning in the sky

I've seen the end in my dreams... I'm not scared
I can't really explain it
But I know I've been waiting for this all my life

I am god's executioner
Does it matter which?
When salvation finds you
We give praise to the war giver

Give praise to the war giver and hallelujah
To the blood letter
Hallelujah to the blood letter

Glory be to god
Infidels crushed under heel
Heretics to the fire
And persecution to the race of swine

Like cattle to the cull
Whites of their eyes
Like a shard of glass
To the throat

I am the catalyst
I am the touch paper
Let us write the final chapter
Rebirth... rebirth in flames
