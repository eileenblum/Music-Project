I am in the city
I am losing my fucking mind
It seems like the streets are made of nothing
Nothing but scum

Neon burns my senses
I should have beaten the life out of him
When I had the chance
To make me feel alive

I knew I would regret it
It made me feel alive 
An injection of energy
A vital sign of no life

No fucking life 
No fucking sign of life

I took the morning train to eastpoint
Commuters staring
My head pounds
Blood and dirt under my fingernails

Acrid sweat in my eyes
What do I know about
What do they know about me

Fire

I feel like my blood is on fire
And my veins are boiling
So where is salvation
I am searching for absolution
There is nothing but bitter redemption
And penitent absolution

Incredible and tremendous pain
My brain is on fire
One pill makes the retina blaze
And the other makes dead calm

Vomit on the streets
Human shit
I will capitulate to desire
To bite the hand
And purge the flesh
