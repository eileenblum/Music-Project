There is nothing that brings me closer to him
Then the caustic stench of sweat
And the taste of religious adrenaline

A small chink of daylight at the morning prayer
Breaks my fever and my fervour
In the grip of the darkest night

If I ever doubted his plan for me
Doubted his words or what I must do
To set them free

I am still human a simple form
I am wrath the righteous law

This word is now and forevermore
The eye of every coming storm

If I ever doubted his plan for me
Doubted his words or what I must do
To set them free

I am... SKS 7 Point 72
I am... white phosphorous
I am... semtex C4
I am... atomic fucking power

I am no longer human, another form
More than wrath and more than law
My word is now and forevermore
