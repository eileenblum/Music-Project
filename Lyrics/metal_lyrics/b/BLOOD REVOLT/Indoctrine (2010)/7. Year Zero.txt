And this is my intent
My statement
It is my world address
And my vision

What choice? Like a trapped rat
A social lab test
With no hope
And no way out

So I made a choice
We bow to none
It was all over before you were born

Semtex packed
I grind the prints
Filed edges, metal casing
Welded, stench
Aluminum burns chlorate
Retches the skin
Tetrachloride
Fire
I fix the fuse, set the head
Adrenalin
Grind to powder TNT
The nerves are filed
Electrical detonation
Grip hard
Strapped tight, and sweat burns

And heretic's commandments
Dogma and prayer
Your preacher's sons are gathered in despair

I'll say again, I never had faith to lose
As god is my witness
I will be an instrument of faith
I don't need to be fucking saved

This is year zero and the beginning of the end

The final immolation
And my mark upon the world
And this is the end
