I dreamt of blood and iron
Of a storm of twisted flesh
Of a god that wills my hand
To be his judgement

And do you understand the rage
It will silence and deafen
And curse the slaves of men
For they are the slaves of all

This vision was in black and white
Soundless, dust, weathered hands crack the dial
A man hangs from the boughs and they beat him with sticks

So lock the door and cock the rifle
We are waiting patiently
Looking for a moving target
In no man's purgatory

What fresh hell is this
That we make for ourselves
Cut from the cloth of Judas
And the poisoned apple bite

I never had faith to lose
As god is my witness
And I am an instrument of his truth

And I don't need to be saved
And I saw you on your knees
You were asking what god could do for you

When the demons come for you
Do you fight them?
Or do you become one of them?

And let me tell you about freedom
About liberty
Let me tell you who's in my sights
And Who's on my list

I am an animal with no way out
I will write my name
In blood across the sky
