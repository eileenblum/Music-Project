Climb over rock and ruin
My brow is drenched with sweat
Nails dug through cuticle
I'm not done climbing yet.

Dreaming the dream of dreams
Strenthening A human being
One day to be the king
Shed the skin of bitter things

Time pased for many years,
Minutes, hours seem like days
Bodies lie in the pathway,
My soul they tried to take,
Set gaze onto the target,
Yes, you know my name.
Never wave the white flag,Not detoured by the pain

[Chorus:]
Stepping through the flames
Casting My shadow over you
You would not believe
What these eyes have seen.
Choking from the smoke,
Taking breaths of fresh air
To hell and back,
But now I am home.

Many have come, deceived
Wearing face of family
They tried to steal my dreams
These ones I'm battling

Eyes roll into my head,
God this thrill is so intense,
I'm the one who won the game
I'm the man, I'm still the same.

[Chorus]
