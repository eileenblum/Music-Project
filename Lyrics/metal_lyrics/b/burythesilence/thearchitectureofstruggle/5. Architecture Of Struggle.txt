Evolution at heand,
Evidence is so apparent
All that don't see will have
An expensive price to pay.

Financial downfall for eyes that don't see
The unfolding of this technical development
Human body made such change,
Mind must do the same.
Except needed growth
Don't hold on to past lives

Pain is always part of
Enlargement process
War is inevitable
Agonizing piece of the puzle.

[Chorus:]
This world,
This world is mine for the taking.
Throw down the cleric reigns
And your love for hate
And forget you hate for love

Forget you hate for love.

Practical horizons
Fit in our masterpiece
To reach a higher degree of intelligence (Intelligence)
[Repeat]

Open all doors and gates,
Break through all barriers
Bust through all barricades
This is what stands in our way.

Machines produce,
Legitimate Progress
Process creativity,
Breaking through these ordinary goals.

Sons improve on fathers' inventions
Our world must unite

War is inevitable
War is inevitable

[Chorus]
