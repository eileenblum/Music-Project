Jealousy is an emotion, a vitamin to
Fuel the strength of weakness
Making the weak the weaker
Give in to emotion can only bring you pain

Apprehensive of Rivalry
Suspicious train of thought
Reality is lost
Transparency of all

Engulfed by the want of things that
You can't possess
Grasping onto things that only
Bring Stress
Go seek, be the seeker
shirk the weaker-work plus pride
Trasnsforms to

To Wings that fly, Fly High
So Far Above

You, You Stalk for Prey
Feeding from the Bottom of
From the bottom of hope

No Hope
From the bottom there is no hope

Through the atmosphere (Through the atmosphere)
Flying so high (Flying so high)

Jealousy is an emotion, a vitamin to

So far above, above

Through the atmosphere (Through the atmosphere)
Flying so high (Flying so high)

Show the world that we're unstoppable
