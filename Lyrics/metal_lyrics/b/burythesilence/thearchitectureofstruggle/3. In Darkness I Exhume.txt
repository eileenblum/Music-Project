Black, entrenched over nightmares
Transcending
Bleak, endless visions of your demise

With chosen treachery, our fates
are sealed
nailed(nailed) within the coffin
of one's own construction

These force-fed remedies, made to kill
Brothers, forced to become, enemies
Brothers, forced to become, enemies!

Behind corrupted eyes, there is truth and clarity.
Clarity!

Blackness, entrenched over nightmares
Transcending, you rise
Rise through damnation
Bleakness, endless visions of your demise, we rise
In darkness i exhume

Close your eyes, open up to what's inside.
This is the path to self revelation.
As primal energies - submerged
instilled
Fighting back, to feel what's real
Still Fighting back, to feel what's real
Still Fighting back, to feel what's Fucking real

Blackness, entrenched over nightmares
Transcending, you rise
Rise through damnation
Bleakness, endless visions of your demise, we rise
In darkness i exhume

In darkness i exhume

Blackness, entrenched over nightmares
Transcending, you rise
Rise through damnation
Bleakness, endless visions of your demise

We will rise [3x]
We Rise
