1, 2, million miles around the world,
back to where we started but keep going till we reach the sun.
Levitate to the horizon, love for what it is that made us who we are, but we move along and we gotta kiss it good bye.
And if I had a billion dollars, I'd spend it on myself, but a rocket to the moon,
Yell profusely into outer space, take a trip around the sun, I'd sail along, to mars or even Jupiter.
And if I had a single wish, wish that I could go back home, to a place not so complicated so I could be alone.
Back to when we did this for the hell of it, because now we only do it, to stay on top it.
