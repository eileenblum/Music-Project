Hear the frozen, call of the north
A legend written in blood
A fighter's way, recall the day
its end is well understood

What lies beyond, old age and blades
and bodies under duress
the endless fight, eternal night
that is for others to guess

Hear the rain fall on sodden field
Feel the iron strike through armour and shield
See men thrown down into the void
All must die, all must be destroyed

Eight leagues under the earth!
Eight leagues under the earth!
Eight leagues under the earth!
Eight leagues under the earth!
Eight leagues under the earth!
Eight leagues under the earth!
Eight leagues under the earth!
Eight leagues under the earth!
Eight leagues under the earth!

Beyond horizons, beyond the seas
and eight leagues under the earth
this is where, the hammer lies
long lost and broken under darkening skies
in molten veins, through rock and stone
that fissures up through the crust
a bolt of light, an arc in flight
when bones are smashed into dust.

Hear the rain fall on sodden field
Feel the iron strike through armour and shield
See men thrown down into the void
All must die, all must be destroyed!
