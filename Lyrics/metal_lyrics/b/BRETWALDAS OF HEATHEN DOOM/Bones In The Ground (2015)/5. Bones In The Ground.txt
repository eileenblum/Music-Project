When this frail house of flesh
can no longer hold my spirit
if my enemies take me in war
or if fate leaves me prey
to the ravage of years
I ask this of you
this and no more

Place my bones in the ground
Let me face to the north
give me axe
give me shield
give me sword
As the crow reels in flight
and the teeth of death bite
raise a mound over me and my hoard

When the last drop is drained
when the mead hall runs dry
when the fire burns low on the hearth
as the hammers are crossed
on the midwinter frost
I will walk on the gods' starlit path
