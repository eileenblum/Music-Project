In the forest time stands still
the vapour of metal awaits
the trees watch as
our spears held high
as we draw nearer the gates
with a hail on our horn
for the winter to bite
with the cleanest of steel
a cup for those who passed
like a storms icy blast
for the secrets our fathers left behind....

Grim, battered, frost cracked
battered bloody and dumb
shields cracked lifted in hand
for many cold mornings to come

Steel...whoring...veal....steel etc
