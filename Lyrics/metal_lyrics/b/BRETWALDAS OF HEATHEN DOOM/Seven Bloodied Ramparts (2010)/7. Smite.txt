Beneath forbidding clouds
Where maggots writhe
With ash and dust and blood
Their earthly tithe.
Who takes the nightwatch
While others sleep?
When fear and darkness rule
In torments deep and cruel.

When moonlight's baleful eye
Is at it's height
Foes real and of the mind
Test mean and might.
Who rises 'fore the dawn?
Who sets the snare?
Who bears the iron's weight?
Eyes fixed upon the gate.

On foul winds...let black spirits ride
Fly to my arm power of those underground.
Fires rage, the nine worlds ablaze
Wield the force...that no others can bear
Smite them down where they stand
Smite them down where they stand
Smite them down and grind their bones into dust
Smite them down where they stand
By the hammer and hand
Smte them down and grind their skulls into dust.
