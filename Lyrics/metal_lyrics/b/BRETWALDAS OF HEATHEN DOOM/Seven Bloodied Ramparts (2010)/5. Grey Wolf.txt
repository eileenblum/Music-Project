The grey wolf watches the halls of the Gods
See the black rain hrough the sun's first rays
Rust forms, rot grows and all decay
The greatest strength will wither away.

A vision sent when hoar-frost grips the earth
When fires die and darkness is our curse
No matter the sunlit glories of the ancient past
Of all that come - the wolf will be the last

Now omens of misfortune dull our mirth
The highest walls will sink into the earth
Remorsless time, the blades of true regret
Alone against the tide - I stand here yet
