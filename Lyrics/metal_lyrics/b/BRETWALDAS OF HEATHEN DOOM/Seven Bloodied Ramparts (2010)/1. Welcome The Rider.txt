Welcome the rider,
from the forests of the dead,
where a burning wheel is carved upon a stone.
Watching the seamen,
haul upon the oars,
on their journey to bring the fallen home

Benches are empty,
among the bearded men,
those who met ill fortune on the way.
On sansdstone the Valknot,
a symbol of their oath,
to plant their feet where others would not stay

Welcome the rider,
from the forests of the slain,
he's earned his cup, now let him drink it down.
Hail the rider,
for in the place where mortals dwell,
is left behind a tale of his renown
