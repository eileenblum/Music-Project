I am the stormcrow
I am the black face
The spear-master
Born of the dark race
Upon the axis, beneath the high dome.

The ancient rider
I am the first law
I take the first blood
I am the last war
Upon the axis, beneath the high dome
Corpses that rise up...from under the stone.

Rise, rise, break the chains of your oppression
Rise, rise
Rise, rise, release the frenzy of possession
Rise, rise

Inside the death-mound
Into the unknown
A thousand names carved
Into the black stone
Upon the axis, beneath the high dome.

Astride the pathway
A deathless patron
Within the darkness
That waits for all men
Upon the axis, beneath the high dome
Corpses that rise up...from under the stone.
