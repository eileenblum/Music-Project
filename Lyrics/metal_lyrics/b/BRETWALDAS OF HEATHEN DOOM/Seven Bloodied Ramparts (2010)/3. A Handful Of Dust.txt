In darkest night
What stalks our nightmares?
If flesh will fail us
And mind is slow
My feral children
Will don the wolfskin
Will raise the hammer
And strike the blow

And in your raging thirst, I offer you only this -
A handful of dust, a horn full of piss!

May all your seed fall upon a barren soil
Your issue come to nothing
Ruin in spite of toil

In foulest dreams
What beasts of chaos
Will bring us fever
Will cause us doubt?
My feral children
Will don the wolfskin
Will raise the hammer
To cast them out!
