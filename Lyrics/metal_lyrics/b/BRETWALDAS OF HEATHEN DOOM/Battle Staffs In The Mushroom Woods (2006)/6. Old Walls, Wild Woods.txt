Beneath the spreading boughs of ages
In defence of time
Remnants stand, of battered armies
Sprung from Wodenâs line
For the words of the serpentâs tongue
We paid a bitter price
Now behold the dawnâs first rays
On fields of broken ice

Within old walls, and wild woods
Where the fallen leaves lie deep
The icy grip, of deepest winter
Shakes off a thousand years of sleep
And when it falls, the blood of ancients
To lie in pools upon the soil
Itâs strength will be our victory
Through wisdom
Through war
Through toil.
