As a shard of failing memory sought shadows in the mist
Hooded figures standing silent
Men who no longer exist
Heed the beaconsâ warning,
Murmurs on the winds and waves
As the figures sinking slowly
Back into their ancient graves
A thousand blackened whispers
Creeping from the marsh and mire
In a language now archaic
From a time of blood and fire
Realities of ice and darkness
Moulding every mortal span
As a cold wind stirs the ashes
Ground down from the bones of man.
