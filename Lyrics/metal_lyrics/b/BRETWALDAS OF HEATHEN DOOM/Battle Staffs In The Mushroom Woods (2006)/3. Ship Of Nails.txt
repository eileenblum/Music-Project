They will come on the chaos winds
To raise the fallen when the killing begins
Hear their horns, hear the armour clash
See their eyes in the lightning flash

Know their purpose if they come for you
To swell the ranks of great Odinâs few
When the winter does not end
These are the emissaries he will send

This is the gathering of the Einherjar
Brought together in Valhalla
Led by the wolf and the carrion crow
Torrents of blood will be running below.

There will be fighting in the days before
An age of weapons and an age of war
The skies will echo to spear and sword
Axe and shield before the Battle-Lord

You will be paid in the halls of Asgard
Before the horn of the Watcher is heard
Will you live up to your mead-fuelled boasts?
Or will you flee before the demon hosts?..
