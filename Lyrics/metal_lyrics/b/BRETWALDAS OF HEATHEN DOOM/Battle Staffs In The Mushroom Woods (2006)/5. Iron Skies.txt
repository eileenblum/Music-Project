Beneath the iron skies of war
Before called to the Valgrind door
A world of worms no more no less
Whose numbers increase as times progress
In forest fastness and hollow dale
Gather strength for others to prevail
Within the marshlands and woods forgot
Where many falter but some do not

Wisdom sought from those who read the signs
Interpret omens, by runes divine
Observe the heavens or cast the bones
See dark portents, hear forestsâ moans
As the cold stone absorbs sunâs heat
See the waker withdraw from sleep
The golden promise of the Northern dawn
Foreshadows thunder as our blades are drawn
