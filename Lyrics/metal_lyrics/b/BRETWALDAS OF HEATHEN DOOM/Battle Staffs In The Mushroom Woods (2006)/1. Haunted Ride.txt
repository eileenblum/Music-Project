No time for griefâs lamenting chorus
Bodies of men scythed down like wheat
As javelins slam into the hillside
Black pounding hearts keep up their murderous beat

In winterâs broad dominion
The fetters burst, the haunted ride
A warning for the living
Unending rage of those who died

No faltering, no hesitation
The raven banner leads our force
A restless day among the living
A restless night beneath the gorse
