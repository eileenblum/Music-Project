After the earth is sated
By the blood of gods and men
Demon howls no longer rend the air
When the roar of distant battle
Dies away on gusting winds
Let the wolves and ravens take their share

When the best of Odin' hearth troops
Gathered from the northern lands
Warrior kinsmen those who never yield
All beserks and saga heroes
Once within the golden hall
Now lie in crimson heaps upon the field

Soon the rain will wash the corpses
Bitter winds will scour the field
And the leaves will bleach in summer's rule
Mankind best again have fallen
From the ashes none shall rise
For the final blaze consumes us all

From the ashes none shall rise
From the ashes none shall rise
From the ashes none shall rise
From the ashes none shall rise
