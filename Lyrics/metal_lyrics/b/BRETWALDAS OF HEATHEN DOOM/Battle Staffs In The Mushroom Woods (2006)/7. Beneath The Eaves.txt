I pledge my sword to those now gone
An oath of flame to burn them on
Dark fire to cleanse your mortal wounds
Dark ice to score my blackened runes

Before men stir beneath the eaves
And laughing voices turn to screams
When sun is set and lights grow dim
When sword blows smash on shields rim

I pledge my sword to those unborn
For in this future of this I'm sure
A coming struggle, a future war
The rise of chaos, the fall of law

Before men stir beneath the eaves
And laughing voices turn to screams
When sun is set and lights grow dim
When sword blows smash on shields rim

A thunderbolt will scorch the land
To stand or fall is in your hands
The wolves of Midgard are baying loud
It's time to ride them down
