They come from the north
They travel in darkness
Pure evil eyes
With souls painted black
Like shadows in moonlight
Dark creatures lie

Rapists and killers with blood on their hands
Their souls shall be damned
Murderers and sinners prepair for attack
And heaven shall burn

Together weâre brothers
Into the darkest hours
Forever weâre standing glorious
Whenever at nightfall
I hear the roar of thunder call
Heaven shall burn
When demons collide

The light turn to dark
And silence surrounds me
Fear in the sky
Of fire and flames
The ashes are falling
Where demons fly

Rapists and killers with blood on their hands
Their souls shall be damned
Murderers and sinners prepair for attack
And heaven shall burn

Together weâre brothers
Into the darkest hours
Forever weâre standing glorious
Whenever at nightfall
I hear the roar of thunder call
Heaven shall burn
When demons collide
