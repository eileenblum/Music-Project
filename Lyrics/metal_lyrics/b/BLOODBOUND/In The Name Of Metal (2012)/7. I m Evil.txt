Iâm evil no, Iâm evil no

I reach for the sky
The moment of truth has just begun
A twist of light a burning sun
We settle the score
The day of the reckoning is over
My soul is black forever burned

We canât forgive the unforgiven
Unholy signs of fallen souls

I dance with the beast
In the darkness
Iâm evil
Your blood is a feast
In the fading light tonight
Iâm evil no, Iâm evil oh, Iâm evil no

Iâm riding the wind
The still of the night I left behind
The break of dawn a new frontier
Awaken the fall
A crack in the sky an open doorway
The race is on Iâll show you why

We canât forgive the unforgiven
Unholy signs of fallen souls

I dance with the beast
In the darkness
Iâm evil
Your blood is a feast
In the fading light tonight
Iâm evil no, Iâm evil oh, Iâm evil no
Iâm evil, Iâm evil no
