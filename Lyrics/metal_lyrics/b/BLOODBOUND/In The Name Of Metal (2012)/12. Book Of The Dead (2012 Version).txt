No sound on the burial ground 
Thereâs a stone with your name on the side
Itâs done the awake has begun
You can run but thereâs nowhere to hide

Satan, keeper of souls
Calling from your grave

Take my hand and Iâll guide you to hell
Show you evil youâre under my spell
Make your choice between heaven and hell
Thatâs what the devil said 
In the book of the dead
In the book of the dead

Deep down thereâs a beast with a crown
And heâll rise if the right words are read
Youâll pray at the end of the day
Take my life cause Iâm better of dead

Satan, keeper of souls
Calling from your grave

Take my hand and Iâll guide you to hell
Show you evil youâre under my spell
Make your choice between heaven and hell
Thatâs what the devil said
In the book of the dead
In the book of the dead

Deep down thereâs a beast with a crown
And heâll rise if the right words are read
Itâs done the awake has begun
You can run but thereâs nowhere to hide

Satan, keeper of souls
Calling from your grave

Take my hand and Iâll guide you to hell
Show you evil youâre under my spell
Make your choice between heaven and hell
Thatâs what the devil said
In the book of the dead
In the book of the dead
In the book of the dead
In the book of the dead
In the book of the dead
