All across the land
I see signs of the damned
And broken dreams
In the burning sky
Where the raven will fly
In hollow screams

I'm the master of the universe
Hands of doom
Thunder god
Sacrifice us all
For the glory of my name
Screaming

Metalheads unite,
C'mon join the fight
Metalheads unite,
We bring them down
Metalheads unite,
March into the night
Metalheads unite,
Sing...
M E T A L for metal

Brothers, here we stand
You obey my command
The final call
Sacred ceremony
Where the sinners will pay
With blood and soul

I'm the master of the universe
Hands of doom
Thunder god
Sacrifice us all
For the glory of my name
Screaming

Metalheads unite,
C'mon join the fight
Metalheads unite,
We bring them down
Metalheads unite,
March into the night
Metalheads unite,
Sing...
M E T A L for metal

Metalheads unite,
C'mon join the fight
Metalheads unite,
We bring them down
Metalheads unite,
March into the night
Metalheads unite,
Sing...
M E T A L for metal
