Burning inside my soul turn to pieces
I try to hold on for my life
Iâm staying alive the feeling of dying
Is scaring me out of control

Praying for the night
To give me shelter from the storm
In shadows of my past
Iâm all alone

Iâm the son of Babylon
And Iâm on the run
Hell is calling now my time has come
Sanctified by the holy grail
The screaming sounds of the sirens wail

Falling apart a demon inside of me
Tearing my soul to the core
Itâs breaking my heart a voice deep within
Calling saying Iâm dying again

Praying for the night
To give me shelter from the storm
In shadows of my past
Iâm all alone

Iâm the son of Babylon
And Iâm on the run
Hell is calling now my time has come
Sanctified by the holy grail
The screaming sounds of the sirens wail
