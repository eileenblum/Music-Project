Iâve been stuck in this hell for so long
Living my life in the darkness
Slowly fading, all hope is gone
Feels like Iâm dying inside

Can someone hear me out
And guide me through the dark
So lost in misery...my insanity

The wind and the rain is calling my name
A fallen angelâs dying
Iâm ready to fly, I reach for the sky
Forever lost, the king of fallen grace

All I feel is the rage in my soul 
Growing inside like a fire 
Falling deeper into despair
Jaded and broken inside

Can someone hear me out
And guide me through the dark
So lost in misery...my insanity

The wind and the rain is calling my name
A fallen angelâs dying
Iâm ready to fly, I reach for the sky
Forever lost, the king of fallen grace

The wind and the rain is calling my name
A fallen angelâs dying
Iâm ready to fly, I reach for the sky
Forever lost, the king of fallen grace
