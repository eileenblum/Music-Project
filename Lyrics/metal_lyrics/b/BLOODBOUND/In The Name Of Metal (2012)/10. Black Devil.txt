Iâm the king of the skulls and bones
Over sticks and stones
My return from the living dead
Iâm your fear and dread

I am restless and wild
Getting crazy when Iâm lost inside
Feel the dark taking form
Prepare for the lunar storm

Iâm the black devil
Black devil yeah
Iâm the black devil
Cause the night has a thousand eyes
Iâm the black devil

All I know when I see you cry
From the evil eye
Never seen in the light of day
Like a bird of prey

I am restless and wild
Getting crazy when Iâm lost inside
Feel the dark taking form
Prepare for the lunar storm

Iâm the black devil
Black devil yeah
Iâm the black devil
Cause the night has a thousand eyes
Iâm the black devil

Iâm the black devil
Black devil yeah
Iâm the black devil
Cause the night has a thousand eyes
The night has a thousand eyes
Iâm the black devil
