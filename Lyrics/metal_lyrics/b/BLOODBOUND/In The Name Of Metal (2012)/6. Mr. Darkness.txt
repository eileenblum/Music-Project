Let me tell you about an evil story
Let me tell you my friend
Had a vision of a new tomorrow
With a perfect end

The mind of a crazy madman
Is taking you over
A venomous snake inside your brain

Mr. Darkness
Heâs the voice deep inside of you
Mr. Darkness
Heâs in everything you do tonight
Mr. Darkness

Iâm infected by a hellish fever
I can walk with the dead
In a prison of eternal sorrow
Lost inside my head

The mind of a crazy madman
Is taking you over
A venomous snake inside your brain

Mr. Darkness
Heâs the voice deep inside of you
Mr. Darkness
Heâs in everything you do tonight
Mr. Darkness

Mr. Darkness
Heâs the voice deep inside of you
Mr. Darkness
Heâs in everything you do
Heâs in everything you say tonight
Mr. Darkness
