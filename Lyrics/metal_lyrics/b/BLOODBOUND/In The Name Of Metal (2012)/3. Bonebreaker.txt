Fallen again into the unknown
Lost by the battle of heaven and hell
Back in the burn my life is my own
Stuck in the madness Iâm cursed by the spell

In the mirror reflecting my soul
Catching a glimpse of the fall

In shadows of illusion evilâs on the run
Killing in the name of the chosen one
Darkness getting clearer slaughter has begun
Praying for the game
Iâm the one
Bonebreaker 

Master of pain Iâm prowling the night
Death and destruction the fallen will burn
Screaming in vain Iâm searching the light
Savor the moment before my return

In the mirror reflecting my soul
Catching a glimpse of the fall

In shadows of illusion evilâs on the run
Killing in the name of the chosen one
Darkness getting clearer slaughter has begun
Praying for the game
Iâm the one
Bonebreaker
