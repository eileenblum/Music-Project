I see a face in the wake of night
A dead man walking Iâm in his sight
Itâs getting closer a violent game
Of flesh and bones in a burning flame

Lifeless eyes of an evil spell
Fire, let me take you to hell

Close your eyes get out of his mind
Mesmerized in darkness youâre blind
Save yourself give in to your fear 
Kill him now the dawning is near
All you will find
In the monstermind

My life is made out of broken dreams
A dark road paved with the silent screams
I crash and burn at the speed of light
Iâm paralyzed I canât win this fight

Lifeless eyes of an evil spell
Fire, let me take you to hell

Close your eyes get out of his mind
Mesmerized in darkness youâre blind
Save yourself give in to youâre fear 
Kill him now the dawning is near
All you will find
In the monstermind
Monstermind
Monstermind
Monstermind

Close your eyes get out of his mind
Mesmerized in darkness youâre blind
Save yourself give in to youâre fear 
Kill him now the dawning is near
All you will find
All you will find
In the monstermind
