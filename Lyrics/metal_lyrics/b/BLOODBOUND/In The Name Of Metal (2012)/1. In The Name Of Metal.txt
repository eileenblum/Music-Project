You say Iâm evil you say I suck
My hairâs too long I donât give a fuck
Iâm doing nothing out of control
My musicâs wrong I donât care at all
You say Iâm ditry I smell like shit
All dressed in black and my clothes donât fit
Iâm a sinner excuse me mâam 
You take your moral I donât give a damn

Metalâs getting hyper deadly as a viper
Rise from armageddon
Faster than a feight train stronger than a steel chain
Screaming voices roar

In the name of metal
Raise your fist to the heaven above
In the name of metal
Raise your fist and shout
In the name of metal
Raise your fist to the music we love
In the name of metal

You think iâm ugly looks like a witch
Iâll kick your ass like a pussy, bitch!
You call me loser I raise my glass
Letâs make a toast you can kiss my ass

Metalâs getting hyper deadly as a viper
Rise from armageddon
Faster than a feight train stronger than a steel chain
Screaming voices roar

In the name of metal
Raise your fist to the heaven above
In the name of metal
Raise your fist and shout
In the name of metal
Raise your fist to the music we love
In the name of metal
