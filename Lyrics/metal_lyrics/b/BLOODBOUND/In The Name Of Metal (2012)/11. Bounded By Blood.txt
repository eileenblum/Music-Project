Weâre the sons of satan
Weâre descendents from hell
We break the silence
In shadows we dwell
From the land of evil
Born disciples of sin
The fallen savior
The pain within

In matters of the dark
I hear them calling
The sanctury of hell
Will be my fall

We are the creatures of the night
Ready for the fight
Down the river of blood we gather
We are the children of the night
Come stand by our side
Bounded by blood forever

Iâm the black of holy
Iâm a sinner of saints
The darkest wishes
The blood that he paints
By the lost horizon
At the end of the line
My soul is rising
I see the sign

In matters of the dark
I hear them calling
The sanctury of hell
Will be my fall

We are the creatures of the night
Ready for the fight
Down the river of blood we gather
We are the children of the night
Come stand by our side
Bounded by blood forever
