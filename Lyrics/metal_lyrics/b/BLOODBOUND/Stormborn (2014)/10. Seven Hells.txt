We travel the ocean
With armour and steel
To kill, to fight for the honour
A vicious battalion
A furious beast
The gods of war at command

We heed the call
The march of war
Has only just begun
We rise or fall
Forever bound as one

In quest for the glory
In union we stand
Come fire and rain
Come sorrow and pain
Our darkest desires
Will show you the way
Come holy enlight
Come evil and fight
Seven hells

We conquer the heavens
With powers of hell
To serve, to die for the legion
A lifetime in anger
A life in the dark
The gods of war in your hand

We heed the call
The march of war
Has only just begun
We rise or fall
Forever bound as one

In quest for the glory
In union we stand
Come fire and rain
Come sorrow and pain
Our darkest desires
Will show you the way
Come holy enlight
Come evil and fight
Seven hells

In quest for the glory
In union we stand
Come fire and rain
Come sorrow and pain
Our darkest desires
Will show you the way
Come holy enlight
Come evil and fight
Come evil and fight
Seven hells
