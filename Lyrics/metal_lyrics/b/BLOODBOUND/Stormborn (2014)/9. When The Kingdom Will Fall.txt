In the name of the lord
Say a prayer for my soul
Holy war of the gods
I will fight
In the name of the lord
In the sky never die
Sacrifice pay the price
Holy war of the gods
In the sky

Fate is calling
Voices deep inside my soul
By the grace of god
Silent whisper
Stories told of ancient times
When the darkness falls

You're the chosen one
You're the only son
From the darkest depths of hell
By the blood I swear
Kingdom come is here

In the name of the lord
Say a prayer for my soul
Holy war of the gods
I will fight
In the name of the lord
In the sky never die
Sacrifice pay the price
Holy war of the gods
In the sky
Now my time has come to fight
When the kingdom will fall...

In the shadows
Evil rise among the flames
Fires burning tall
Out of heaven
Angels falling one by one
Like a shooting star

You're the chosen one
You're the only son
From the darkest depths of hell
By the blood I swear
Kingdom come is here

In the name of the lord...

When the battle has come to an end
And the bloodline is broken
When the fires are burning
The walls to the ground
Hear my call

In the name of the lord
Say a prayer for my soul
Holy war of the gods
I will fight
In the name of the lord
In the sky never die
Sacrifice pay the price
Holy war of the gods
In the sky
Now my time has come to fight
Now my time has come to fight
When the kingdom will fall...
