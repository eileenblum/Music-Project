Stronger than steel
We are standing tall
United brothers one and all
Made of metal
Ready for war
Gonna give you some
We'll blow 'em all to kingdom come
Made of metal

Together we stand
We ain't gonna fall
Well break 'em all
Together we fly
We're riding the sky
And all my fears are gone

Cause I am made of metal
Shine in the dark
Forged in fire
Razor sharp
Cause I am made of metal
Into the fight
Castles burning bright
Made of metal
Made of steel

Hotter than hell
Gonna make you burn
The heads are rolling take your turn
Made of metal
Bringer of pain
We're the gods of sin
The night is dark we're marching in
Made of metal

Together we stand
We ain't gonna fall
We'll break 'em all
Together we fly
We're riding the sky
And all my fears are gone

Cause I am made of metal
Shine in the dark
Forget in fire
Razor sharp
Cause I am made of metal
Into the fight
Castles burning bright
Made of metal
Made of steel

We're making you scream forever
In hell tonight
We're making you bleed whenever
Stand up and fight!

Cause I am made of metal
Cause I am made of metal
Shine in the dark
Forged in fire
Razor sharp
Cause I am made of metal
Into the fight
Castles burning bright
March into the night
Made of metal
Made of steel
