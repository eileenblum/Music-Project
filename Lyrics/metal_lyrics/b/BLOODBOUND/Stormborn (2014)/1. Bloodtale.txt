[Instrumental]Bloodbound, a term from the dark ages
When men made an oath
Known as the blood oath
They would cut their hands
Mixing their blood
Each man then carries the others blood
Linking the two as blood brothers
Forever bound to the sacred order
A bloodbound can never be broken
And will follow you into the afterlife
And beyond...
