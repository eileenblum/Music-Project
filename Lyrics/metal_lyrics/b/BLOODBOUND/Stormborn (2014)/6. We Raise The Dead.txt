I am the spawn of Lucifer
A demon on the run
I am the beast the chosen one
My crowning has begun

My path is broken
I'm falling into darkness
No signs of heaven
No sights of hell
Straight from thy grave

We raise the dead out of hell
In this evil masquerade
We paint the sky in black forever
We raise the dead out of hell
And the light begins to fade
We ride 'em high my holy sinners
We raise the dead
Out of hell
We raise the dead
Out of hell

I am the cold and lonely one
A memory from the past
I am a slave an evil son
My bloodline never last

My path is broken
I'm falling into darkness
No signs of heaven
No sights of hell
Straight from thy grave

We raise the dead out of hell
In this evil masquerade
We paint the sky in black forever
We raise the dead out of hell
And the light begins to fade
We ride 'em high my holy sinners
We raise the dead
Out of hell
We raise the dead
Out of hell

We raise the dead out of hell
In this evil masquerade
We paint the sky in black forever
We raise the dead out of hell
And the light begins to fade
We ride 'em high my holy sinners
We raise the dead
Out of hell
We raise the dead
Out of hell
