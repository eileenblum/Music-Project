Master of torture
Son of a slave
A hellion straight from the grave
Hungry for bloodshed
In for a kill
This tormentor slay for a thrill

From a land beyond the light of day
He feeds you with his lies
Voices chanting this unholy lullaby

We die, die
By his hand
Welcome to my wonderland
Six feet deep I lay
We die, die
Never wake
Pray the lord my soul to take
Nightmares from the grave

Lord of the wasteland
Evil within
A wicked redeemer of sin
Lost in the shadows
Craving the pain
The victims are screaming in vain

From a land beyond the light of day
He feeds you with his lies
Voices chanting this unholy lullaby

We die, die
By his hand
Welcome to my wonderland
Six feet deep I lay
We die, die
Never wake
Pray the lord my soul to take
Nightmares from the grave

We die, die
By his hand
Welcome to my wonderland
Six feet deep I lay
We die, die
Never wake
Pray the lord my soul to take
Nightmares from the grave
