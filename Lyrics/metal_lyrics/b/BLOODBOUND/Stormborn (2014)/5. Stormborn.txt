I stand my ground in death or glory
My soul is bound defend the holy
Across the sea the seven kingdoms
A silver queen arise to claim the throne

On the shores of the iron islands
Blood stains get washed in the sand
In the land of the darkened sorrow
Lord of the light here I stand

On my knees I will pray to the holy one
Winter will come to an end
From the wall of the north
I will scream your name and fly

By my blood I will pay my allegiance and slay
Breaker of chains I'm the stormborn
When the night has begun and the reaper has come
Mother of dragons will fight
By my blood

My revenge will be grim and evil
Black water storm I command
When the stars color red in heaven
Wildfire burns in my hand

On my knees I will pray to the holy one
Winter will come to an end
From the wall of the north
I will scream your name and fly

By my blood I will pay my allegiance and slay
Breaker of chains I'm the stormborn
When the night has begun and the reaper has come
Mother of dragons will fight
By my blood
By my blood

I stand my ground in death or glory
My soul is bound defend the holy
Across the sea the seven kingdoms
A silver queen arise to claim the throne

Born out of dragonstone a storm in heaven
By fate I walk alone unite the seven
I'll bring a firestorm my wings of darkness
A silver queen arise to melt the stone

By my blood I will pay my allegiance and slay
Breaker of chains I'm the stormborn
When the night has begun and the reaper has come
Mother of dragons will fight
By my blood
By my blood
My legions will slay
By my blood
