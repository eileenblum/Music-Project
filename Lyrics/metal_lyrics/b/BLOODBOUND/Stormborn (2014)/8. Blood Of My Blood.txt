I seal the night into the black
Serpents turning fire's burning tall
I'll take the fight knife into the back
Master you will fall

Die!
My servant I'll
Kill!
The unborn from
Hell!
I spawned

Sacred believer I'm calling your name
Fight by my side blood of my blood
Holy deceiver I'm lighting the flame
Die by my side blood of my blood

I'm in the dark no holding back
Twisting turning you will burn 'em all
I see the light facing the attack
Master you will crawl

Die!
My servant I'll
Kill!
The unborn from
Hell!
I spawned

Sacred believer I'm calling your name
Fight by my side blood of my blood
Holy deceiver I'm lighting the flame
Die by my side blood of my blood

Die!
My servant I'll
Kill!
The unborn from
Hell!
I spawned

Sacred believer I'm calling your name
Fight by my side blood of my blood
Holy receiver I'm lighting the flame
Die by my side blood of my blood
