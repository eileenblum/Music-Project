When the night of the watch has fallen
I shall send your souls to heaven
When the light of the stars are calling
I'm the king of the iron throne

In the dark of the night
In the wake of the moon I arise
Demon bred, straight from hell
An assassin bound under a spell

I am legion
I'm the maker
Fire blasting death machine
I'm the king of demolition
Master of the mean

When the night of the watch has fallen
I shall send your souls to heaven
When the light of the stars are calling
I'm the king of the iron throne

In the storm of the fight
At the break of the dawn you demise
Left undead on your back
All the sacred is under attack

I am legion
I'm the maker
Fire blasting death machine
I'm the king of demolition
Master of the mean

When the night of the watch has fallen
I shall send your souls to heaven
When the light of the stars are calling
I'm the king of the iron throne

I am legion
I'm the maker
Fire blasting death machine
I'm the king of demolition
Master of the mean

When the night of the watch has fallen
I shall send your souls to heaven
When the light of the stars are calling
I'm the king of the iron
When the night of the watch has fallen
I shall send your souls to heaven
When the light of the stars are calling
I'm the king of the iron throne
