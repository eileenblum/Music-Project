We follow the sign
To blind to remember
The fear is the fuel and key
To all the things we do
No time for reflection
No time to recall
We storm the barricades of hell

I'm falling deeper down
Right into the madman I've become

When all lights fail
I'll be dancing on your grave
And the reign of the dead is over
You gave your soul to save the one
Now your final time has come
When all lights fail

I'm walking the line
The good and the evil
My heart and my soul collide
I feel I'm torn in two
No time for forgiveness
No time to regret
I storm the barricades of hell

I'm falling deeper down
Right into the madman I've become

When all lights fail
I'll be dancing on your grave
And the reign of the dead is over
You gave your soul to save the one
Now your final time has come
When all lights fail

When all lights fail
I'll be dancing on your grave
And the reign of the dead is over
You gave your soul to save the one
Now your final time has come
When all lights fail
