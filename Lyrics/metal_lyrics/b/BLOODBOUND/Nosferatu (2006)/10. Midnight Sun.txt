[T. Olsson / F. Bergh]

Into the dark I've fallen
Too weak to fight it back
I hear the voices call
From the depths of hell

When Lucifer calls
There's no turning back

Fly far away to the land
Of the forest, ice and snow
In the light of the midnight sun
Fly far away and return
All the darkness that was lost
In the midnight sun

Down on my knees I'm crawling
Too scared to walk away
When will I ever learn
Hell is where you burn

When Lucifer calls
Light will turn to dark

Fly far away to the land
Of the forest, ice and snow
In the light of the midnight sun
Fly far away and return
All the darkness that was lost
In the midnight sun

Fly far away to the land
Of the forest, ice and snow
In the light of the midnight sun
Fly far away and return
All the darkness that was lost
In the midnight sun
