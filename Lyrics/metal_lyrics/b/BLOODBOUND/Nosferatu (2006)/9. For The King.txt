[T. Olsson]

He will teach you, master of the sword
Fall in line get down obey the lord

Many men will join us for the glory of the king
And fight until the end

Fight for the king and the crown and the son
To make sure this is where we belong
Fight for the king and the crown and the son
To make sure that our roots carry on

On the battlefield you will arise
Turn and look the maker in the eyes

Many men will join us for the glory of the king
And fight until the end

Fight for the king and the crown and the son
To make sure this is where we belong
Fight for the king and the crown and the son
To make sure that our roots carry on

When the battle is won
And there's blood on the ground
When the reaper is gone
And the smell of the dead is so strong

Fight for the king and the crown and the son
To make sure this is where we belong
Fight for the king and the crown and the son
To make sure that our roots carry on

Fight for the king and the crown and the son
To make sure this is where we belong
Fight for the king and the crown and the son
To make sure that our roots carry on
