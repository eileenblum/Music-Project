[T. Olsson / U. Breed / F. Bergh]

Late at night you've locked the doors
There's the strangest feeling
Was that curtain really drawn before
Was that candle burning
Was that carpet torn
Had you really left those lights turned on

As you gaze into the gloom
And the windows mirror you
But the face reflected isn't yours
When the wind is howling
And the moon looks on
Can you really say your fears all gone

From dusk till dawn
The curse is on

With the light of day comes no sanctuary
As the shadows fade away
With the light of day comes no sanctuary
From behind the moon they come

In the pale blue light tonight
In the shadows in the dark
Where the terrors of your mind take shape
There's no comfort here
When all is said and done
Can you really tell those lights weren't on

From dusk till dawn
The curse is on

With the light of day comes no sanctuary
As the shadows fade away
With the light of day comes no sanctuary
From behind the moon they come

With the light of day comes no sanctuary
As the shadows fade away
With the light of day comes no sanctuary
From behind the moon they come

Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh oh oh
