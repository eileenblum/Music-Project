[T. Olsson / F. Bergh]

You dream of a world without pain
But there's only evil
The prophet predicted your path
And you will deceive her

An Angel of death
Has fallen again
And this time it's your turn

You live to die your soul is blind
By the creature in your mind
See the sign of Lucifer
You live to die what will you find
In the corner of your mind
Once again crucified

You'll dance with the demon tonight
Between good and evil
Betrayed by a spell from her hand
Cause Lucifer leads her

A sinner no saint
From heaven was sent
And this time your soul'll burn

You live to die your soul is blind
By the creature in your mind
See the sign of Lucifer
You live to die what will you find
In the corner of your mind
Once again crucified

You live to die your soul is blind
By the creature in your mind
See the sign of Lucifer
You live to die what will you find
In the corner of your mind
Once again crucified
