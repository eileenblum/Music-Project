[T. Olsson / F. Bergh]

It's the dawn of a new horizon
Where the rainbow is grey and dark
No stars in the sky
Only angels burning

Feel the dark side of human nature
That can light by a single spark
You can't deny what you've become
You are the one to open up the dark

Say goodbye and look the demon in the eyes
It's the last time you'll see the sunrise

There is no hope to find
Deep inside an evil mind
And when the nighttime falls
You'll be falling down into the dark

It's the time of the inquisition
One way ride to eternity
No anger no fear
Will you open up the dark

Say goodbye and look the demon in the eyes
There's no time to repent no glory

There is no hope to find
Deep inside an evil mind
And when the nighttime falls
You'll be falling down into the dark

There is no hope to find
Deep inside an evil mind
And when the nighttime falls
You'll be falling down

There is no hope to find
Deep inside an evil mind
And when the nighttime falls
You'll be falling down into the dark
