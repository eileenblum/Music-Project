[T. Olsson / U. Breed]

You always thought you had this game nailed down
You had things sorted inside out
The times are changing now the money's down
It got you cornered now for sure

And they say you must deliver
Sending shivers down your spine

Oh Desdemonamelia
There's no static on the line
Oh she's the soul retriever
She's both evil and divine

Without a fear return her deadly gaze
It's your vision on the line
So if you can't deplore her and if you kneel before her
You will never be apart

And they say you must deliver
Sail the rivers of her heart

Oh Desdemonamelia
There's no static on the line
Oh she's the soul retriever
She's both evil and divine

Who's evil and divine
In time we'll understand

Oh Desdemonamelia
Got your money on the line
Oh she's the soul retriever
Cut your losses there's still time

Desdemonamelia
Desdemonamelia
No, No, No, No, No
Desdemonamelia
