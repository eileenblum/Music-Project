[T. Olsson]

Our story begins in a horrible place
Where heaven and hell is the end
Reason is gone, killing is done
All in the name of the son
Along came the preacher with promise in vain
Cause everything comes to an end
Reason is gone, killing is done
All in the name of the son

There's no shadow on the wall
When the demon's passing by
There's no shadow on the wall
There's a story to be told
As the moonlight meets the eye
There's a story to be told

The sound of the guns and the
Steel meeting steel has begun
Pray for a life after death on your
Knees and we'll meet in hell

Only the brave on the battlefield wins
Cause heaven and hell is the end
Reason is gone, killing is done
All in the name of the son

On the battlefield we stand
At the very last frontier
On the battlefield we stand
In the sky the arrows fly
Like a cloud instilling fear
In the sky the arrows fly

The sound of the guns and the
Steel meeting steel has begun
Pray for a life after death on your
Knees and we'll meet in hell

Only the brave on the battlefield wins
Cause heaven and hell is the end
Reason is gone, killing is done
All in the name of the son

Our story will end in a horrible place
Where pain and despair is your friend
Reason is gone, killing is done
All in the name of the son
