[T. Olsson / U. Breed / F. Bergh]

One day one night
One set of burning wheels
You better get this right
Once in a lifetime once in a while
Cruel disposition men keep moving down this line

Whoa oh oh oh oh, whoa oh oh oh oh
She's hot as hell and hell you ride

My lady of the night can't romance her no
Charging through the night her engine roars
With screaming tyres spewing flames
Knocking at hells door she's a metal monster

Someday sometime
One scorching hot machine calling down the line
From this position burning fumes inside
Move through the gates so fast you better treat her right

Whoa oh oh oh oh, whoa oh oh oh oh
She's hot as hell and hell you ride

My lady of the night can't romance her no
Charging through the night her engine roars
With screaming tyres spewing flames
Knocking at hells door she's a metal monster

My lady of the night can't romance her no
Charging through the night her engine roars
With screaming tyres spewing flames
Knocking at hells door she's a metal monster

My lady of the night can't romance her no
Charging through the night her engine roars
With screaming tyres spewing flames
Knocking at hells door she's a metal monster

Whoa oh oh oh oh, whoa oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh, whoa oh oh oh...
