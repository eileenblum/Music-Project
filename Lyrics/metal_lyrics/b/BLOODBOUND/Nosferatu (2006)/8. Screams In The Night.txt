[T. Olsson]

He came from nowhere and took all the children
Away in the still of the night
Morning at sunrise they left with their pain
Despair calling ready to fight

Fallen to pieces they searched in the fields, in the
Woods anywhere they could be
Nightfall and still not a sign of the light
In the darkness where black shadows dwell

Morning came still no sign of life
Nighttime falls reflection in his knife

Screams in the night as the last ray of light
Fade away they will never return
Screams in the night as the last ray of light
Fade away only black candles burn

Twisting and turning they're locked in the valley of
Fear they will never return
Blood on his knife and the look in his eyes
As evil as evil can be

Morning came still no sign of life
Nighttime falls reflection in his knife

Screams in the night as the last ray of light
Fade away they will never return
Screams in the night as the last ray of light
Fade away only black candles burn

Screams in the night as the last ray of light
Fade away they will never return
Screams in the night as the last ray of light
Fade away only black candles burn
