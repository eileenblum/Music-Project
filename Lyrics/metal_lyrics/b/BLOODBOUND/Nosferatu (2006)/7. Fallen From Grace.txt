[T. Olsson / F. Bergh]

If you lose your faith in human kind
I'll be the one who's calling
When you've lost all hope and
Everything is dead and gone
If you're still around tomorrow
And the devils verdict's fallen
You will be condemned and suffer for eternity

Save yourself and turn into the light
Close your eyes or they will steal your soul away

How many souls will be lost in the sea
Of the damned for eternity
Fallen from grace and be lost in this place
Without bars or a lock and key

Follow every sign cause they will guide
You through your darkest hour
Even if it means that you will go to hell and back
Never talk to strangers if their shadows
Hide behind the moonlight
Only when the bell strikes midnight
Fallen angels fly

Save yourself and turn into the light
Close your eyes or they will steal your soul away

How many souls will be lost in the sea
Of the damned for eternity
Fallen from grace and be lost in this place
Without bars or a lock and key

How many souls will be lost in the sea
Of the damned for eternity
Fallen from grace and be lost in this place
Without bars or a lock and key
