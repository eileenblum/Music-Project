Skyfall, in midwinter land
Only fire will keep us alive
Nightfall, in shadows we crawl
And the light of the fire is all

We will rise out of ashes
And fly above the sky
We will ride into the battle
With the banners held high

Stand, fight
Heaven shall burn
In a cloud of fire
We stand, fight
Wings of war are you ready to fight
Stand and fight

Darkness, the end of the world
Only ghosts of a dream will survive
Shadows, reflecting my past
And the darkest of angels will fall

We will rise out of ashes
And fly above the sky
We will ride into the battle
With the banners held high

Stand, fight
Heaven shall burn
In a cloud of fire
We stand, fight
Wings of war are you ready to fight

Far and away in the dreamers hide out
All of my dying days
Dark is the journey that I am upon
Leaving the shelter behind
Dark is the story of heaven and hell
Evil in mind I've become

Stand, fight
Heaven shall burn
In a cloud of fire
We stand, fight
Wings of war are you ready to fight
