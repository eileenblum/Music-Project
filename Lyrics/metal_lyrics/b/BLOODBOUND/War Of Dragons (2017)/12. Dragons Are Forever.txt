Flyin' high flyin' low
Over mountains, ice and snow
So astray in clouds of fear I fall
In the blink of an eye
In a lifetime passing by
Far beyond the universe I know

Tears of a dragon
Diamonds in the night
Be my guide in the light

Dragons are forever
They all stand together
Cause dragons are forever
The kingdom of heaven will burn

Give 'em hell give 'em pain
I'm the fire and the rain
Riders on the giant wings of fate
I am lost in a maze
In a dark and lonely place
Far away an everlasting dream

Tears of a dragon
Diamonds in the night
Be my guide in the light

Dragons are forever
They all stand together
Cause dragons are forever
The kingdom of heaven will burn

Seven demons of a world afar
Time has come for true believers
Light the sky set the world on fire

Dragons are forever
They all stand together
Cause dragons are forever
The kingdom of heaven will burn
