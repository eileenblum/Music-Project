Spread your wings in time we fly
To fight the end of all
My angel my demon from hell
Far beyond the clouds so high
We're riders of the sky
My demon my angel of heaven

From the day you were born
Til' the day I will die
We are bound forever side by side
I'm your lifeline and sworn
In the darkest of days
My diving storm

Fire, in heaven
Tell a tale of seven
Silver, moonlight
Frame her silhouette
Magic, my story
Tell a tale of glory
Nightfall, twilight
Fly and lighten up the sky
War of dragons

Find the key to Avalon
The sky is falling down
My angel my demon from hell
Close your eyes and think of home
The light inside your heart
My demon my angel of heaven

From the day you were born
Til' the day I will die
We are bound forever side by side
I'm your lifeline and sworn
In the darkest of days
My diving storm

Fire, in heaven
Tell a tale of seven
Silver, moonlight
Frame her silhouette
Magic, my story
Tell a tale of glory
Nightfall, twilight
Fly and lighten up the sky
War of dragons
