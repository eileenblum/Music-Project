Life's beauties fade to nothing
Cold winds of suffering
Angels in line
To shed their tears for the fallen
This dark world turning darker
Your light will shine our way
Into believe in something great
Something higher

A fallen star has left its mark
Gone to find another purpose
(In a land far away, to infinity)
To seek the light beyond the dark
Hidden truths we always failed to see
(Spread your wings fly away to eternity)

I pray but no one ever seems to hear
Memories never fade
And your deeds were never in vain

For the fallen heroes
We raise our hands to the sky
And seek the sign
To believe in something higher
For the fallen heroes
We go through fire and pain
And seek the sign
To believe in something great
Something higher

A soul sets sail to wander free
No more strives under the surface
(Unrestrained and unchained immortality)
You won't leave us all behind
In our hearts you live forevermore
(Spread your wings fly away to find harmony)

I pray the scars will heal
For just one day
Memories will remain
And your deeds were never in vain

For the fallen heroes
We raise our hands to the sky
And seek the sign
To believe in something higher
For the fallen heroes
We go through fire and pain
And seek the sign
To believe in something great
Something higher

My father in heaven
My savior my king
My shelter protector
In good times and bad
My father in heaven
My savior my king
My hero I greet you farewell
And rest in peace

For the fallen heroes
We raise our hands to the sky
And seek the sign
To believe in something higher
For the fallen heroes
We go through fire and pain
And seek the sign
To believe in something great
To believe in something higher
For the fallen heroes
