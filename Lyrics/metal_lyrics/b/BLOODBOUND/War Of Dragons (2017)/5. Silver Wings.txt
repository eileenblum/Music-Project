She was young she
Was cold and lonely
Never learned to fly
High above
The clouds are passing by
Don't belong
In the world of humans
Even if she try
High above
The clouds are growing darker

In the dead of night
When the time is right
Spread your wings in the moonlight
In her loneliness
Fire's sweet caress
Rider of the sky

Over the trees
Over mountains over seas
I will fly far away in a firestorm
Over the hills
Over valleys and the fields
I will burn everything
Under my silver wings

All alone in the halls of darkness
Hide where eagles dare
Leave the cage it's time to find her wings
For as long as I can remember
She was born a master of the heavens

In the dead of night
When the time is right
Spread your wings in the moonlight
In her loneliness
Fire's sweet caress
Rider of the sky

Over the trees
Over mountains over seas
I will fly far away in a firestorm
Over the hills
Over valleys and the fields
I will burn everything
Under my silver wings

Far away from heaven
I have lost all hope
All light in the dark
On the way to distant shores
I'm led astray
I turn to you and pray

Over the trees
Over mountains over seas
I will fly far away in a firestorm
Over the hills
Over valleys and the fields
I will burn everything
Under my silver wings
