Messenger of light and wisdom
Summoned by a force of evil
In flames we trust
Full of anger fire breathing
Fury carried on the wind blow
In light we fall

Endless battle of the ages
Neverending blood red story
Ancient master show no mercy
Stormbringer fly

For the kingdom we serve and obey
On the ivory towers I pray
And the light of the stars fade away
Guardians at heaven's gate

Holding back my tears of sorrow
Merciful and life will follow
To claim what's mine
Moonlit sky arrive gatekeeper
Stand my guard at heaven's doorway
You shall not pass!

Endless battle of the ages
Neverending blood red story
Ancient master show no mercy
Stormbringer fly

For the kingdom we serve and obey
On the ivory towers I pray
And the light of the stars fade away
Guardians at heaven's gate

For the kingdom we serve and obey
On the ivory towers I pray
And the light of the stars fade away
Guardians at heaven's gate
