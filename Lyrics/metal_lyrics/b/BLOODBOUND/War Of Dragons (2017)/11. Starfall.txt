The rays of the sun will travel a million miles
One journey begins another one ends
Connecting the stars and fill in the lines between
A sign of the gods where everything starts

When a star has fallen we wish upon a dream
And that dream is full of hope, full of fear

Twilight is the ring of fire
Never ending dark desire
Shine on everything and all
Twilight is the ring of fire
Mystery of grand empire
Shine a light starfall

I read in your eyes in search of the untold lies
You wanted a king I gave you a queen
In spite of it all the shadows will fade away
Becoming the light of everything dark

When a star has fallen we wish upon a dream
And that dream is full of hope, full of fear

Twilight is the ring of fire
Never ending dark desire
Shine on everything and all
Twilight is the ring of fire
Mystery of grand empire
Shine a light starfall

Twilight is the ring of fire
Never ending dark desire
Shine on everything and all
Twilight is the ring of fire
Mystery of grand empire
Shine a light starfall
