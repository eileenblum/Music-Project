All for one and one for all
Say my friend misery
In the silence darkness takes control
Come with me to fading stars
A place without a name
Inner demons are creeping in my soul

We fly so far away
Still I hear 'em say
Come set fire to the sky

End of hope the world is darkening
Soaring wings the sky is closing in
Burning flames the day of reckoning
Tears of a dragon
End of days a world of ice again
Soaring wings the screams are all the same
Burning flames will never ease the pain
Tears of a dragonheart

Pray for one and pray for all
Say why this mystery
In the shadows I can see my fall
Fly with me to hell and back
A place inside of me
Inner demons are creeping in my soul

We fly so far away
Still I hear 'em say
Come set fire to the sky

End of hope the world is darkening
Soaring wings the sky is closing in
Burning flames the day of reckoning
Tears of a dragon
End of days a world of ice again
Soaring wings the screams are all the same
Burning flames will never ease the pain
Tears of a dragonheart

Born in the dark one of a kind
Lost in a dream never the same forever fly
Fear of the night in for the kill
War of the gods we'll never die
Tales of a king taking the crown
Into the light blood of a sin the tears I cry

End of hope the world is darkening
Soaring wings the sky is closing in
Burning flames the day of reckoning
Tears of a dragon
End of days a world of ice again
Soaring wings the screams are all the same
Burning flames will never ease the pain
Tears of a dragonheart
