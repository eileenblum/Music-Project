Twisting the blade like a mirror
Turning my anger to gold
Killing the dragon I fear her
My crestfallen story unfolds

Blood of the fallen revealing my path
Burning the bridges to ashes
Dark is the day
When my soul turns to dust
Black is the sorcerer's way

On a cold winters night
When the snow is sparkling white
Over frozen lakes I will carry you home
In the forest of ice
Hear the wind oh whisper lies
I'm the mighty
King of swords

Calling the raven of darkness
Wisdom he holds to be found
Riding the storm of the ages
My quest for the fallen begins

Blood of the fallen revealing my path
Burning the bridges to ashes
Dark is the day
When my soul turns to dust
Black is the sorcerer's way

On a cold winters night
When the snow is sparkling white
Over frozen lakes I will carry you home
In the forest of ice
Hear the wind oh whisper lies
I'm the mighty
King of swords
