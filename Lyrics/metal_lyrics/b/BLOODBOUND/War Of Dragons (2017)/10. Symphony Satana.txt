We light the beacons cross the land
We send a message over mountains
The canyons and plains
In every corner of the realm
In all the castles of the kingdom
The battle is on

We ride and we fly
Under banners so high
Raise your sword
Spread your wings in the starlight
We fight and we die, seal your fate
Set the heavens on fire
(Heed the sign, we are the chosen ones)

Inter arma silent leges
Symphony satana
In hoc draco signo vinces
Aut vincere aut mori

We fill the sky in every form
We fight a tyrant made of sorrow
The beast in the dark
For all the time he held the chains
For all the moments in the darkness
The battle is on

We ride and we fly
Under banners so high
Raise your sword
Spread your wings in the starlight
We fight and we die, seal your fate
Set the heavens on fire
(Heed the sign, we are the chosen ones)

Inter arma silent leges
Symphony satana
In hoc draco signo vinces
Aut vincere aut mori

Fallen angels on the steps
To heaven's gate
Oh saint peter will decide
Upon their fate
Hope and glory only history will tell
Good or evil it is heaven or it's hell
Fallen angels on the steps
To heaven's gate
Oh saint peter will he open up
The gate to heaven?

Inter arma silent leges
Symphony satana
In hoc draco signo vinces
Aut vincere aut mori
