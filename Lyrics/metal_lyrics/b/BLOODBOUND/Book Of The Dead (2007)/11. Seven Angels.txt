Sacred hearts on fire
Gave in to desire
Damned by Satan's hand
From this holy land
Endless fields of fire
Red flames burning higher
Trapped in Satan's hand
In this unholy land

You're lost in darkness, all the light has fade away
In the dark the eyes are watching you
Forever silence in a land of ice and snow
You can feel the presence of him grow

If their wings are lost
They're never to return
In the winter frost
Their statues burn

Seven angels fallen in the shadows crawling
Broken wings of fate
Seven turned to evil balance in upheavel
Broken wings of fate

The unforgiven will be waiting for your call
Find the wings and you will save us all
The face of evil has been called so many names
But the one he lives among the flames

If their wings are lost
They're never to return
In the winter frost
Their statues burn

Seven angels fallen in the shadows crawling
Broken wings of fate
Seven turned to evil balance in upheavel
Broken wings of fate

Seven angels fallen in the shadows crawling
Broken wings of fate
Seven turned to evil balance in upheavel
Broken wings of fate

Sacred hearts on fire
Gave in to desire
Damned by Satan's hand
From this holy land
Endless fields of fire
Red flames burning higher
Trapped in Satan's hand
In this unholy land
