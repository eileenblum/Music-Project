No one knows the way I'm feeling
Torn inside, my heart is weak
Hiding in my own world, feeling incomplete
Down and out, my soul is burning
Stranded in this no man's land
Left in the dark now life is slipping through my hands

Somewhere deep inside my mind
Memories locked away...

All of my life I've been searching my soul
Lost in the darkness and out of control
Nowhere to go, slowly fading away into eternity...

How can I rise from the sorrow
Will I ever feel alive
Will I find a way to kill the pain inside
Falling deeper into darkness
Like a never ending flow
So lost and desperate with no place to call my home

In the corner of my mind
Memories locked away...

All of my life I've been searching my soul
Lost in the darkness and out of control
Nowhere to go, slowly fading away into eternity...

All of my life I've been searching my soul
Lost in the darkness and out of control
Nowhere to go, slowly fading away into eternity...
