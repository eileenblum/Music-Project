You're halfway to nowhere
The memories are deep inside your mind
You're in Purgatory
You're looking for danger
The ashes of doom is what you'll find
You're in Purgatory

Sacrifice the sacred hearts of stone
And send them into Satan's jaws on fire

In the flames of purgatory
On the way to hell
There's a tale only dead men tell
In the flames of purgatory
Burn inside the spell
There's a tale only dead men tell

You're heading for fire
The heart of the flames upon your face
You're in Purgatory
You're meeting the maker
The moment has come to leave this place
You're in Purgatory

Sacrifice the sacred hearts of stone
And send them into Satan's jaws on fire

In the flames of purgatory
On the way to hell
There's a tale only dead men tell
In the flames of purgatory
Burn inside the spell
There's a tale only dead men tell
