The last of immortals
The last of his kind
No roses upon his grave
The Spell has been broken
Has come to an end
There's nobody left to save

Should I live or should I die
End the circle black the sky

Sign of the devil
He's been calling out your name
Sign of the devil
The Deliverer of pain
Sign of the devil
He will make you go insane
Sign of the devil
Say your prayers and I'll see you in hell

The angel of heaven
The monster of hell
You're taking this life I grave
Depraved in denial
The ending is near
Withheld from he blood you crave

Should I live or should I die
End the circle black the sky

Sign of the devil
He's been calling out your name
Sign of the devil
The Deliverer of pain
Sign of the devil
He will make you go insane
Sign of the devil
Say your prayers and I'll see you in hell
