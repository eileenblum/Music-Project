Into the shadows of the night
You're alone no sign of light
The moon is creeping in the sky
The eyes of darkness are watching you
Something evil is coming through
You can't run, there's no escape

The demon of Babylon
Awaits in the dark...

Fear of the devil, the master of pain
From the shadows he's calling you name
There's no escaping the powers of hell
He's the tempter, he'll steal your soul away...

Don't lookinto his evil eyes
He'll intice you with his lies
He'll find a way into your mind
You feel the presence of the beast
And your blood begin to freeze
Say your prayers to stay alive

The demon of Babylon
Is calling your name...

Fear of the devil, the master of pain
From the shadows he's calling you name
There's no escaping the powers of hell
He's the tempter, he'll steal your soul away...

Fear of the devil, the master of pain
From the shadows he's calling you name
There's no escaping the powers of hell
He's the tempter, he'll steal your soul away...
