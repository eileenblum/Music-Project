The devils heldhound scenting you he's on his way
He's gonna hunt you like a prey
You better run before the light will turn to dark
Cause soon you'll hear his evil bark

Before the lightning strikes you
The demon will fall

Bless the unholy
You can feel life is slipping away
Bless the unholy
Close your eyes at the end of the day
Time to pray

The heaven sent cannot protect you from the beast
He's not an exorcist or priest
Condemned in darkness with the sentence on its way
The day of reckoning now pray

Before the lightning strikes you
The demon will call

Bless the unholy
You can feel life is slipping away
Bless the unholy
Close your eyes at the end of the day

Bless the unholy
You can feel life is slipping away
Bless the unholy
Close your eyes at the end of the day
Time to pray
