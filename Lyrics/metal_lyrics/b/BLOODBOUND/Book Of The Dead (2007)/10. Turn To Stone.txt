Standing in the shadows, hiding from the light of day
Paranoid and wasted, life begins to fade
Lost in desolation, demons playing in your mind
Stuck inside a world where the angels cry

Somewhere down the line you gave your soul away
Worn and jaded, feeling so astray...

How can you learn how to live once again
Spread your wings, you can fly like an eagle so high
Time to let go, leave the demons behind
Fly away or you'll turn to stone...

Say goodbye to all your sorrows, leave the pain behind
Chase away the monsters, flight to stay alive
Keep away from Satan's fire, don't burn your wings again
Watch out for the flames, there's another way

Somewhere down the line you gave your soul away
It's time to break out, face a brand new day...

How can you learn how to live once again
Spread your wings, you can fly like an eagle so high
Time to let go, leave the demons behind
Fly away or you'll turn to stone...
