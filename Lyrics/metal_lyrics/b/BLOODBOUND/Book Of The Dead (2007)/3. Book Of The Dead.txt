No sound on the burial ground
There's a stone with your name on the side
It's done the awake has begun
You can run but there's nowhere to hide

Satan, keeper of souls
Calling from your grave

Take my hand and I'll guide you to hell
Show you evil you're under my spell
Make your choice between heaven and hell
That's what the devil said in the book of the dead
In the book of the dead

Deep down there's a beast with a crown
And he'll rise if the right words are read
You'll pray at the end of the day
Take my life cause I'm better of dead

Satan, keeper of souls
Calling from your grave

Take my hand and I'll guide you to hell
Show you evil you're under my spell
Make your choice between heaven and hell
That's what the devil said in the book of the dead
In the book of the dead

Deep down there's a beast with a crown
And he'll rise if the right words are read
It's done the awake has begun
You can run but there's nowhere to hide
