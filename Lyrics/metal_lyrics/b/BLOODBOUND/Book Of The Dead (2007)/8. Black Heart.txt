Forever lost inside memories of the past
Together you and I a dream that never last
Black angels by my side whispering my name
Please follow us to hell and take you from the pain

You'll never be sad again goodbye my friend
Reach your hands up to the sky

Hold your spirit high
Black heart to the grave
Now it's time to die
Black heart fade away

So dark and cold I feel destiny prevail
Into the shadow land my soul has set its sail
Black angels by my side whispering my name
Please follow us to hell before you go insane

You'll never be sad again goodbye my friend
Reach your hands up to the sky

Hold your spirit high
Black heart to the grave
Now it's time to die
Black heart fade away

Hold your spirit high
Black heart to the grave
Now it's time to die
Black heart fade away
