To hell and back they came with stories of a time
When blood of man was running wild
The night was dark the moon was gazing in the sky
Now I can tell you what went by

Forever trapped inside the gates of hell
Where the sin is sacred

Black shadows crawl in the night
Inside your mind they will haunt you
Just a walk in the park or a life in the dark
Black shadows crawl in the night

To live forever with a coffin full of hate
And never see the light of day
You walk the centuries and still remain the same
To be a part of Satan's game

Black shadows crawl in the night
Inside your mind they will haunt you
Just a walk in the the park or a life in the dark
Black shadows crawl in the night

Black shadows crawl in the night
Inside your mind they will haunt you
Just a walk in the the park or a life in the dark
Black shadows crawl in the night
