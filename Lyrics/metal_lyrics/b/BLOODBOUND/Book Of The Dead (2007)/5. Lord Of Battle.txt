You fought your way through a world made of stone
Like a renegade you stood on your own
Through fire and rain
Destined for eternal glory
You learned to fly like an eagle on high
You rode the sky so brave and so wild
Through flames of eternity
Freedom for your holy land

Forever bold and mighty, Immortal hero
You're the chosen one

On your way on wings of glory
Over hills and lands so holy
Ride across the plains forevermore
Born to stand and fight for freedom
Sworn to kill, defend the kingdom
Lord of battle, set the people free...

Stronger than evil, protector of kings
You're the keeper of their crowns and their rings
So brave, not afraid to die
Armed with a heart made of steel

Forever bold and mighty, Immortal hero
You're the chosen one

On your way on wings of glory
Over hills and lands so holy
Ride across the plains forevermore
Born to stand and fight for freedom
Sworn to kill, defend the kingdom
Lord of battle, set the people free...
