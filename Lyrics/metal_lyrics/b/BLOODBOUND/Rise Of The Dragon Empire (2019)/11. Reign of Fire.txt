Stories of magic the minstrel sing
Of dragon lords and of witches and kings
In the hall of heroes where legends were born
A mind awakes to obey the lord

Closing my eyes and I dream of the fight
A warrior rise to unite

Tales of worlds forlorn under reign of fire
Spectres that rose from the flame
We're riders of the storm of the great empire
Sworn to protect and preserve

Cold winds rising with tidings of war
The wrath of darkened submission unfolds
In the hall of legends where heroes are born
A heart set sail to fulfill the oath

Shadows await in the dead of the night
A warrior rise to oblige

Tales of worlds forlorn under reign of fire
Spectres that rose from the flame
We're riders of the storm of the great empire
Sworn to protect and preserve

The battle of far-away kingdoms and queens
The aftermath shining with red
The forces of evil will never forget
The pure-hearted will never die

Tales of worlds forlorn under reign of fire
Spectres that rose from the flame
We're riders of the storm of the great empire
Sworn to protect and preserve
