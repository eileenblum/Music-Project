A feast for crows a song of ice
So far away from paradise
When all is lost embrace the winds of winter
The wyvern sleeps in dragons den
With eyes of flame and force of ten
A seven-headed beast without a name

In perfect dark he brings a firestorm
God rest his soul to wander all alone
Ignite a spark become the Fireborn
When fire falls from heaven
Draco Ignis Mori

Shadows in the sky
The giants of the heavens will rise
To fight our way with breathing fire
Come to bring us glory
Shadows of the night
Giants of the heavens arise
And fight our way with breathing fire
Come to bring us victory

As daylight dies we sacrifice
The shattered souls with evil eyes
A show so vile when season turn to winter
The blood we shed is on our hands
Arise and fall of ancient lands
The seven-headed creature rule the sky

In perfect dark he brings a firestorm
God rest his soul to wander all alone
Ignite a spark become the Fireborn
When fire falls from heaven
Draco Ignis Mori

Shadows in the sky
The giants of the heavens will rise
To fight our way with breathing fire
Come to bring us glory
Shadows of the night
Giants of the heavens arise
And fight our way with breathing fire
Come to bring us victory

When the fire is burning
And the giants of heaven
Into darkness have fallen
And the seven is calling
God rest our souls

Shadows in the sky
The giants of the heavens will rise
To fight our way with breathing fire
Come to bring us glory
Shadows of the night
Giants of the heavens arise
And fight our way with breathing fire
Come to bring us victory
