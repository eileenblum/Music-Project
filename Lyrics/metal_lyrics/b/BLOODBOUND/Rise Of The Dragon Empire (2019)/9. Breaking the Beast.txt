Tonight the bell tolls for all that we know
Behind the canines it's starting to glow
In the darkest hour I can feel the fire starting ignite
Tonight the bell tolls, we're breaking their bones
We hold the power, the melting of stones
Flames are getting higher in the line of fire burning tonight

In Nomine Patris et Filii
Et Spiritus Sancti

Breaking the beast
Serpent of heaven
Breaking the beast
Into the storm we set out to unite
Breaking the beast
Kingdom of seven
The last great war
We're breaking the beast

A darkened wasteland where everything's dead
With blood of heroes we're painting it red
In the darkest hour I can feel the fire burning tonight

In Nomine Patris et Filii
Et Spiritus Sancti

Breaking the beast
Serpent of heaven
Breaking the beast
Into the storm we set out to unite
Breaking the beast
Kingdom of seven
The last great war
We're breaking the beast

In Nomine Patris et Filii
Et Spiritus Sancti

Breaking the beast
Serpent of heaven
Breaking the beast
Into the storm we set out to unite
Breaking the beast
Kingdom of seven
The last great war
We're breaking the beast

Breaking the beast
Serpent of heaven
Breaking the beast
Into the storm we set out to unite
Breaking the beast
Kingdom of seven
The last great war
We're breaking the beast
