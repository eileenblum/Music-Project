[T. Olsson]

They say the world is still the same
I say there is a burning flame
And the tideâs about to turn
Some say itâs only in your brain
I say itâs real, the cause of pain
And their greed, that is all you serve

Donât give up your life
Without a fight
Open up your eyes
Aim, fire

I pledge allegiance
To goblins and heathens
March by my side
Together we fight
Join my battalion
And serve the medallion
Slay by my side
Together we fight

They say thereâs nothing to behold
I say weâre out there in the cold
And the worst is yet to come
Some say you better stand in line
I say there is an evil sign
And a time when we all must die

Donât give up your life
Without a fight
Open up your eyes
Aim, fire

I pledge allegiance
To goblins and heathens
March by my side
Together we fight
Join my battalion
And serve the medallion
Slay by my side
Together we fight
