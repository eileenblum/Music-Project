[T. Olsson]

I have crossed the line
Turned âem upside down
And made âem unholy
Need no sympathy
For the fallen crown
The story is over

The sign of the cross
Upon the wall
Itâs stronger than all

We can stand the test of time
In the twilight
Where the darkness have fallen
We can balance on the line
In the starlight
Dancing shadows of my
Unholy Cross
Unholy Cross
Unholy

Running out of time
Spinning round and round
The orbit of sorrow
In my wicked mind
Nowhere near mankind
There is no tomorrow

The sign of the cross
Upon the wall
Itâs stronger than all

We can stand the test of time
In the twilight
Where the darkness have fallen
We can balance on the line
In the starlight
Dancing shadows of my
Unholy Cross
Unholy Cross
Unholy Cross
