[F. Bergh / T. Olsson]

Never give in to the dark side of life
And never give up on your dreams
Your time will come non believers shall fall
They feed upon your soul
Deep inside your heart is cold
Anger and fear in your mind
Donât let them tear you down
Let them see you fly

Sleep tight cause in my dreams
I will fight
And never ever will I surrender

Say, can you see
From the dark side of life
In my dream thereâs light
From a star shining bright
Can you see
From the dark side of life
Until we rise again

Trust in yourself anything can be done
Believe and your wish shall come true
One day youâre standing on top of the world
And look into their eyes
Welcome to my dream, youâll say
Inside thereâs no room for you
No time to say goodbye
Time for you to fly

Sleep tight cause in my dreams
I will fight
And never ever will I surrender

Say, can you see
From the dark side of life
In my dream thereâs light
From a star shining bright
Can you see
From the dark side of life
Until we rise again
