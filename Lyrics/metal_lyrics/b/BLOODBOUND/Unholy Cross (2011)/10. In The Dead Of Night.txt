[T. Olsson]

I see your shadow crawl
Back to where you belong
You saved my sacred soul
Bald so mighty and strong
Now time will tell the story
Carved by wind and the rain
There is no fame or glory
Now there is only pain

Kill the one
Who betrayed your blood
Save the unholy cross
Waste the son
Who denied your prayers
And I shall burn

In the dead of night
I am sure itâs alright
Set me free
Like smoke into the sky
In the dead of night
I am searching the light
To be me
And let my demons fly far away

I see the blackened sky
Turn to silver and gold
I hear a wind a cry
Do whatever youâre told
No lies no words deceiving
Life will sure find a way
My precious mind believing
Timeâs my only delay

Kill the one
Who betrayed your blood
Save the unholy cross
Waste the son
Who denied your prayers
And I shall burn

[Repeat chorus]
