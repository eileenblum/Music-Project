[T. Olsson]

No more tears
I have cried for yesterday
Silence haunts me now
There is no more to say
Every day
Thereâs a war inside my head
I have had enough
I wish that I was dead

Hear machine guns fire in my dreams
Tortured souls and hallowed screams

Like a soldier unknown
Thereâs a bond that canât be broken
Brothers of war
They stained foreign sand
They were second to none
And so many words unspoken
Brothers of war
They stained foreign land

Raise our flag
Like a candle in the wind
Praise my uniform
For every time I sinned
Helmet on
Loaded gun beside my bed
Donât think less of me
I wish that I was dead

Hear machine guns fire in my dreams
Nothingâs never what it seems

Like a soldier unknown
Thereâs a bond that canât be broken
Brothers of war
They stained foreign sand
They were second to none
And so many words unspoken
Brothers of war
They stained foreign land
