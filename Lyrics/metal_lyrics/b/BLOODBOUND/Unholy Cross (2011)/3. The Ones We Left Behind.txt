[T. Olsson]

United here we stand
We Sacrificed
The ones we left behind
Forgive me for my sin
I canât deny
The ones we have forsaken
The memories fade to grey
An empty shell
Their time will never come
The vision in my mind
Is clear to me
I donât know how to save you

United here we stand
We Sacrificed
The ones we left behind
Forgive me for my sin
I canât deny
The ones we have forsaken

Youâre walking through darkness
With fear in your mind
Through fire and flames
I am calling your name
My life is eternal
And Judas must die
The wind and the rain
I will show you the way

Whenever the curtain will fall
I hear you calling

[Repeat chorus]

My legion is holy
No tears in their eyes
With sorrow and pain
There is no one to blame

Whenever the curtain will fallâ¦

[Repeat chorus]
