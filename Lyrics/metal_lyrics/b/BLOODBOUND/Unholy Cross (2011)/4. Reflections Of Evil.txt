[F. Bergh / T. Olsson / P. Johansson]

Iâm dead or dreaming
Iâm standing on the edge
The light has died away
The dark in all remains
Ferryman is waiting
Has come to take his toll
And itâs killing me

Searching for forgiveness
Iâm praying for my soul
Blood is on my hands
The minds eye scars unfold
The memories of my past
Forever haunts my mind
Forgive me Iâll burn for eternity

Kneel down repent in sorrow
And your soul shall return

First of the fallen
The last of a dream
A sinner is stuck in between
Hear the piper is calling
The rise and the fall
Reflections of evil in all

I hear a warning
Iâll never walk with you
The corners of my mind
Iâm scared of what Iâll do
Feeding the fire
An ever burning flame
My journey to hell leads to pain

Kneel down repent in sorrow
And your soul shall return

[Repeat chorus]
