[T. Olsson]

The time of the killing has come
Prepare for war
Theyâre all around us
A life in the dark has begun
Behind the walls we die to live

Cry the ground
With holy water
Make a sound and hell is here

Drop the bomb
And weâll blow them all away
Dust and smoke
In a cloud filled with fear

Drop the bomb
And weâll send them back to hell
Mud and clay
Like an old catacomb
Drop the bomb

The crime of our time
Has been done
Destruction lives an evil story
A sanctuary under the sun
Behind the walls
We live to die
Cry the ground
With holy water
Make a sound and hell is here

Drop the bomb
And weâll blow them all away
Dust and smoke
In a cloud filled with fear

Drop the bomb
And weâll send them back to hell
Mud and clay
Like an old catacomb
Drop the bomb
