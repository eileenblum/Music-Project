[F. Bergh / T. Olsson]

I am the one
The only son
Destined to walk in the dark
A lifetime of pain
Killing in vain
Never to see you again

I hear the church bells ringing
Father I have sinned
Please save me
From myself
Reconnect my soul

Fallen to pieces
A victim of fate
Iâll take my life today
Before it is too late
Heaven denied me
Locked in this cell
I hear your message from hell

Feeding the fall
Saviour of all
Taking me down to the core
A lifetime in shame
Never the same
Try to forgive or to blame

I hear the church bells ringing
Father I have sinned
Please save me
From myself
Reconnect my soul

Fallen to pieces
A victim of fate
Iâll take my life today
Before it is too late
Heaven denied me
Locked in this cell
I hear your message from hell
