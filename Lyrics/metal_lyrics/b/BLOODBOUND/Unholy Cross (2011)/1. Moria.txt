[T. Olsson]

Bang your head to hell and back
Shaking the ground of Moria
Raise the dead our time has come
Show me the horns
Of Moria

The night has fallen
And the sky is clear
You feel the darkness
Surround you
Iâll pray for mercy
When Iâm 6 feet under ground
Iâll pray for mercy
When edenâs found

Heavenly pictures
Try to rape your mind
Tormented creatures
You will find

Bang your head to hell and back
Shaking the ground of Moria
Raise the dead our time has come
Show me the horns
Of Moria

The light is crawling
And the time is near
A touch of evil
That bind you
Iâll pray for mercy
When my heart has stopped to pound
Iâll pray for mercy
When hell is found

Heavenly picturesâ¦

Bang your head to hell and back
Shaking the ground of Moria
Raise the dead our time has come
Show me the horns
Of Moria
