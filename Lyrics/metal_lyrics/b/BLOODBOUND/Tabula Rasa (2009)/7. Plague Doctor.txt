The case is closed, the picture framed
but it wasn't you
No one seems to listen
And no one ever cares
Your pleas for innocence
do nothing for you now
Nothing ever happens
It's like nothing ever will

Into the play
This farce if you will
A man with a cure
Plague doctor

You owe me
I saved you
You don't know me, but I you
If you fail me
and I see you
There's no telling
What I'd do

Watch him closely, do just what I do
The tenants in this venture
They'll walk all over you
He's a man of stature
got credentials like a God
So tap into the system
Have a look!
He's nowhere to be found

Like the plague
this man of the world
He's all that you've heard
Plague doctor

You owe me
I saved you
You don't know me, but I you
If you fail me
and I see you
There's no telling
What I'd do
