Every day's another day
Another chance to live this game
And every day's like every day
Another chance to play
Another time's the time to fly
Another line for you to try
And when the time is right
it's still a guessing game

What if it's all a lie?
What's this? A waste of time?
What then if suddenly things don't
turn for the worse?

Take one
Save us time
Let it run, let it run, let it run
Take two
It's a minefield I swear
Take three
The comfort zone
Take four
Turn every stone
Take one
Hand it out once more

Start the day picking up the same tray
Wish for but never get a clean slate
Try hard but let it slip away
Protection for the weak of mind
Killing time, now can't you see
Let it slide and it's all on me
Cut in line to stand in line

What if it's all a lie?
All just a waste of time?
All things considered
Would this really turn
and not turn for the worse?
