What makes us escapes us
While under its thrall
What gives and what won't?
To each and to all
Don't get me started
There's always a war
Feeding you fear
All that you fear
We're out there alone

Looking for answers
It's so hard to believe
In nothing at all

Tabula rasa
Take me now
Have mercy on my soul
Don't you know?

Tabula rasa
Take me now
Oh, take me
Don't you know?

Break in and enter
We've been here before
Dig ever deeper
Through dirt covered floors
Do me a favor
Just so we're clear
Don't let me near-don't let me near
Just leave it alone

There's nothing to find
It's so hard to believe
in nothing at all
