Power lines are singing
in the stark cold winter air
Something draws me there
The light is pure and clear
Our lives are muddled here
The night is never there
when you need it
and I need it
To cover up my tears

They fall and break like glass

Night touches you
forever

I listen as they sing
Part the cold grey winter skies
Fill my life with light

Without you here tonight
I fall and break like glass
