Evil is who nothing does
Evil seeks to earn your trust
On your own, alone you must
Meet your twisted fate

Understand
No, nothing lasts forever
Make your stand
Let us take command

Almost standing still
For a second I don't know
Are we stranded here?
Then it's clear to me
I was born to play my part
The hands we're dealt in time all show
Some twisted kind of fate

With every new encounter
and every corner turned
And every time I look outside
I see myself and what I've learned

Understand
No, nothing lasts forever
Promised land
Counterpoint command
