I reach so deep inside the shambles that is me
Lie to myself and sometimes tell me I am free to
connect the dots to make a sine, to make it mine
Connect the dots my friend
Step right out of line

Why chase a dream that's never there?
Why chase a dream that's everywhere?

Tabula Rasa
You gotta let me know
Tabula Rasa
Tell me what and who we're fightin'
Tabula Rasa
You gotta let me know
Tabula Rasa
What I am and who I was before

With every reason, there's two more to withhold
To prove beyond a doubt this lonely heart is cold
Extensive mining of the mind should take it's toll
Corrective surgery to fingerprint your soul

Who wants a second chance to live
if there's a second chance to give?
