I know you won't believe me
but I shall tell you anyway
In my dreams you always leave me
and I can't have it any other way

When I tell you you're an artist
You always say you're just a fake
But in my dreams you want to heal me
My friend I see you much too late

A purge is coming
Honestly
Reconciliation
For you and me

Dream on, dream on
Dominion--wonderland
Dream on
Do you understand?
Dream on, dream on
Dominion 5 at hand
Dream on
Do you understand?
We go in circles

When the Maestro's left the circle
When our lives begin anew
and the map we hold is empty
and the world we dream is true

A purge is coming
Honestly
Reconciliation
For you and me

Dream on, dream on
This is no wonderland
Dream on
Do you understand?
Do you know who you are?
Dream on, dream on
Dominion V at hand
Dream on, dream on, dream on
Do you understand?
We go in circles

When you lose your way
Don't turn around
Things may never be the same
So if you lose your way
Don't turn around
You will never be the same
Dominion five
