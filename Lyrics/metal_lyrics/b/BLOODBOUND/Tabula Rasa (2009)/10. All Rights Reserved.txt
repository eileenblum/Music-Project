Say could you take some time to fill this out my friend
I know your business and I'd like to lend a hand
I make no promises but, hey, it couldn't hurt
I need your name, address and number
and maybe date of birth

All rise!--Be heard!
Wise up!--We serve!
Bleed you 'til you're good 'n' dead
Take your name and number
and all you've done and said

Self-serving--all deserving
and they told me; "all is fine"
All rights reserved
Preserved for all time
Are my memories,
are my memories still mine?

I spend my waking time searching for myself
Dream of the moment when they've nothing left to say
'Cause what they say I've heard a million times before
There are words behind to hide behind
to tie you up once more
