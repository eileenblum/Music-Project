We might feed you lies
But it's all OK
Keeps you all from going places
What's behind the lies?
You don't wanna know
Leaves you out there in the cold

What is out there?
Let me know
Help me out here
Let me go

You might be what someone
needs to fear
You might be what someone
else holds dear

Doesn't mean that much to me
I'm the master of my dreams

You might need commands
You'll feel right at home
In this world where nothing changes
