Ice cold and sanitized
Take hold and realize
Time passes gently
if I am by your side
Doctored intelligence
Sheer luck or providence
Prudence, be silent now

Well I'll be damned
I'm in high demand
Care to be a hero?
Part of high command?

Sweet dreams of madness
Oh-no Cydonia
Letting the inside out
Sweet dreams of madness share
life at the Parthenon
Lady of Athens
letting the inside out

I sense this senselessness
counting the countless
Doctoring restlessness
until I own your heart
Life holds the answer
I can and shall provide
real life experience
come time to play your part

Well I'll be damned
I'm in high demand
Care to be a hero?
Part of high command?

Sweet dreams of madness
Oh-no! Cydonia
letting the inside out
Sweet dreams of madness
Life at the Parthenon
Lady of Athens
letting the inside outside
Inside out

Play this well
See what you're dealt
ain't what you've got
You should know by now

One step out of line with me
gets you a one way ticket on the Ferris wheel
Knowing who you are
Seeing what you were
Not becoming what you wanna be
