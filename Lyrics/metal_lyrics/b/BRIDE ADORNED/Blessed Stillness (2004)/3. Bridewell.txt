[Music: Panu Kiskola &amp; Mikko Mustonen 
Lyrics: Tuomas Nieminen]

What is restraining
Behind those black eyes
They never shed tears 
Or questioned why

Things that prevail in
This twisted disguise
Though they are mortal
They never die

Cry I hear you lie
You fill my endless days with wasted
Time that once was bright like candlelight

Night has songs that tell of sorrow
When tomorrow gives new wings
For those who are alone
Whose story is foretold

Will they remain from the day innocence
Rephrases their faith as in their days gone by

They tantalised me they patronised me
They caught me in their web
Awakening dreams tell of their bad deeds
Behold her crystallising tears

Who shall caress her who shall embrace her
Who will forgive her crimes
Beneath the cold snow like a heart of stone
Will I ever see love again

Victimising blackness parasites
Sucking all the life from your veins
Paralysing madness desperate cries
Freezing your heart with her blackened eyes

Hides in fantasy and lies within her heart
That tangled her blind
Life that once was bright like candlelight

Wolf to the moon
in the darkest hour
She hides in shadows
With things that crawl at night

Once her eyes were bright our guiding light

Piece after piece delusions redeem
the enchantment of grief at the edge of a world long deceased
