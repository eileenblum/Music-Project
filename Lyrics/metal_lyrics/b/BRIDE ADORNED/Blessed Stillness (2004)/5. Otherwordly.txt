[Music: Mikko Mustonen 
Lyrics: Tuomas Nieminen]

On the edge of time
We rise when worlds collide.

Crimson beams of light 
Lead their way
Illuminate the night
Within the prey

Free the holy land
Heathens must die
Raise your voices
Heed all their cries
Realise they shall die

Follow the Blind one when
Marching under a black flag
We are seeking to find our way back,
No more we have seen the light
It is time to stand up and fight
For pride
For life

Silent prayers are whispered
We lust for life
Our king shall reign for all time

We shall remember
This god-forsaken land has lost its way
Last change surrender
From dusk until the dawn
We sing our songs and carry on in the night

Give us our freedom
O' Saviour of our people
So that we may be joyful
To have such a glory
Who will reign in sovereignty.
When all our enemies will be
As free as

We are under your rule
When gone are all the fools
Who are misguided
Like the ones we have guarded
For eternity
