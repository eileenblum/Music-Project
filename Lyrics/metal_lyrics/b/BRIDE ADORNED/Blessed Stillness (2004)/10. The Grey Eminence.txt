[Music: Panu Kiskola &amp; Mikko Mustonen 
Lyrics: Tuomas Nieminen]

Guilt has always tried to prey me down from my bliss
Inside this silent well of sorrow that has burned my eyes
For Aeons
Doomed to hide inside this lie

Life is not for giving my soul needs salvation
Through the haze that steals all my space
Blinded by fire casting from your eyes
Fall from grace without my embrace
Infinite days play all my cards away
Sign the way where I pass at eve of day

I welcome you into my silent maze
This masquerade of lies that fades away
My only chance lies in your hands
You can dry the tears from my eyes

This life has gone by
It's too hard to find
Light from my shadow
That drags me down

There's no tomorrow
There's only sorrow
Holding your heart
in my arms

Rainbow-coloured days
Were filled with rage of devourer
With the hands of time that have gone by
Why I don't know
I used to dress for the kill 
Killed for the thrill
