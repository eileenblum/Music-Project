[Music: Panu Kiskola &amp; Mikko Mustonen 
Lyrics: Tuomas Nieminen]

Look away from ivory towers
Set your heart for me to beckon me

Have I not released the sun
Only for the moon to born again

No reason to dwell inside the past
It will only make first ones come last

Winter breeze begins to blow
Nights are growing cold

I have conquered your garden
Now it seems like I'm subsided
Sympathy has lost its power

Bonfires cross my heart
Days die while we are apart

Brief unloving world
Kills love from dusk to dawn

Help me carry my burden
ease my troubled mind
Will I ever touch the sky be free to fly

My words for requiem
I wrote it long ago
My tale will never end
It is forever
