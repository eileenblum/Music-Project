[Music: Mikko Mustonen 
Lyrics: Tuomas Nieminen]

Heart and eye are in a mortal war of love 
a Love for war
Rose descends to this bed of death 
We near grave sepulchre

I believe in relief
I will know when
I'll be released once and for all
No reasons for this all 
These words will go on

Darksome so ever the nightfall may be
I shall wait at the break of the dawn for you

Scorch my fears it's music to my ears 
The words of clouds above
Moonlight shall be one of the 
Last of things that I shall see so

I don't know where
I belong so
Tell me again my friend
What tender witchcraft importune 
Deceiving in the orb of your tear

No more I've seen all that lies within my soul
Uncried tears regressive fears inside

Take me in to your arms 
Let me feel your gentle touch
Caress me as I depart as 
I shall drink the poison of your heart

Down to the ground
Tied to the ground
