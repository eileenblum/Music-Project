[Music: Panu Kiskola &amp; Mikko Mustonen 
Lyrics: Tuomas Nieminen]

Fountain of love will perish by her assail compounding
Where is her redemption
In solitude this sworn oath obliging her with patience
Scorned by plague divine deprived mortified

Look inside your crystal ball can you see me in there
Wandering seeking remedy
Bleeding will not stop until I find what I'm looking for
Under this crimson sky

Incantation fallen misery

Halo of thorns though filled with pride undefiled ablazing
Precious filthy honour
Trail torn apart infatuated remorse on placid shores
My legacy it's vanity for me

Staring the sea with longing 
Rose withering in twilight
Rapture of vivacious glistening petals glittering with (ice)

Gracious sacred virtue
Numb from the incisions
Tranquil dirges so hollow
Scoured with indignity
