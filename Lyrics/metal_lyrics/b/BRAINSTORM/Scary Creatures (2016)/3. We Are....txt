Will we ever get this dose again?
Will we really ever understand?

The flames are rising from the past
The night will leave my friend

Now wash away the thoughts inside
And say the words you never said
Release no anger,
You're cleansing my soul, my body and head

Oh, it's way too hard to see
What you hide inside
I had to burn your soul complete
To make you stay straight up the line

[2x]
We are the ones to save your tears
We are
We are
We are the ones to hold your fears
We are
We are

Oh, yes, we are

Look now what we've become
I'm making you know that I'm no master
Life ain't really what it seems
When dreams are turning into a disaster

Everything's changing, everything's lost
On the path you take
The picture's clear, we both got to change
As there's no meaning in these words of hate

We'll keep our own integrity
Their smile's nothing but teeth
We don't have to burn our souls
To stay straight up the line

[2x]
We are the ones to save your tears
We are
We are
We are the ones to hold your fears
We are
We are

Oh, it's way too hard to see
What you hide inside
I had to burn your soul complete
To make you stay straight up the line

[3x]
We are the ones to save your tears
We are
We are
We are the ones to hold your fears
We are
We are

Oh, yes, we are
