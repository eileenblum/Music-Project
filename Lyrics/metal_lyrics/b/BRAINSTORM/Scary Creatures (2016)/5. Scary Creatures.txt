Drowned dead and deep
occult splendour revealed
darkly curtained halls
where we retain a custom old
shadows appear and fall
only darkness can filter through
we're staring into the creatures eyes
this feeling can't avoid you

it's the same old story again, a poetry of fear
the host is calling my name, brings me from laughter to tears...

voices appear inside my brain
I hear they try to reach us
voices approve I can't relate
the presence of scary creatures
it's calling me my misery
fading trust evermore
the curtain falls but this time
hell had come to your door
they lied and cheated
and took me for a fool beyond compare
play god, an act full of lies
now bathed in the dark as the embers flare
