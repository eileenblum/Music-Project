you promised me to show me the way
while selling my dreams for better days
burn my thoughts as they can change my mind
it always seems that I've been so blind

what is left for the times that I have
what is forward for looking to
and so I wander into the black
but I'm never coming back

caressed by the edge of time
but my fate has been revealed
in the blackness of my mind
there's no need to heed my appeals

how could I ever be so wrong
my life is gone but I am none
all those times they turned away
but now I know I should have stayed

what is left for the times that I have
is it worth with no regrets
how do I think I will survive
with no angel by my side
