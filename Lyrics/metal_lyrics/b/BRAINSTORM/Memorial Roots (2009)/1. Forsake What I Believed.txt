Behind a velvet curtain, behind the sea of dreams
You hide me underneath your guiding wings
The dark will seep into my life, feels like a vision to the blind
So it will never be the same again
I lose my soul and waste my life to find the truth about
Why I must die, I reached the point of no return
Memories and choices I defend will follow me into the end
Forsake what I believed, deny what I have learned
And my soul will burn
Forsake what I believe, strain from another world
The weakness in me hurts
For this inner reason, for all the wealth I've sold
You'll remove all doubts from my soul
I'm not afflicted anymore, ask myself what I'm dying for
Do you dare to watch my dreams tonight
Life shined so bright once in my eyes, in agony I wish to rise
Until the end I'll stand my ground
Like a memory from a spark my hope's now glowing in the dark
Through all my painful years, on my journey to the end
I'll catch and kiss your tears, so I'll rise again
