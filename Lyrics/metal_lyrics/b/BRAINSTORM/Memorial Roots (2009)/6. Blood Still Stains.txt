In a world not far away, the evil seems to be alive
See people rotting through the streets
You fight to save your life
You've been socialized for many years
Now you have to face the truth
For those who care, a reason to despair
If you can't see, there's nothing left in there
There's no need to fear life
As blood runs through your veins
Where killing is a suicide
And your soul remains
...The bloodstill stains
Like the idols show on our TV
That's something you don't care
Controlled by fear and tragedy
The wealth isn't really there
Life feels so strange, so much to be discovered
It never helps - you realized - to hurt another
