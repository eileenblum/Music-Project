I'm out trippin' the system
I'm lookin' down where you dwell
How many times I count you out and
How many times your world comes crashing down?
Accepting, denying the fear you were lying
Unaware of the plans I had made
Threads are broken, the promises taken
You're losin' your pride and I'll keep you alive
But no one knows or seems to care
I grow strong and breathe the same air
The answers there for all to see
But you're suffering within your false belief
You're in, now you have to face
Now we're together by a fall from grace
Enchanting words, dreams denied
Whatever I find, you appear on my mind
Accepting, denying the fear you were lying
Without words you accept my life
Threads are broken, the promises taken
Times we shared, time to survive
