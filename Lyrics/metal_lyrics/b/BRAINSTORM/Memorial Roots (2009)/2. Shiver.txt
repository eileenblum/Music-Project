This is my getaway from all the things you've done
'cause you let me fall astray
For all the sorrow that I see the purpose is all gone
And you think there's nothing left to say
We should have done things differently
But different worlds always collide in me
I'm running out of nowhere
There's nowhere left to hide
I'm on my way to nowhere, it's me against you all
I shiver down your spine
When you lose your mask tonight
You tried to pull the strings of my memory
And tried to break my walls in two
Keeping you from getting in, no word that I can say
...I can't explain all you put me enough
I'm drowning with you by my side
The pain of mine just tears me down inside
