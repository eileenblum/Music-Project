At the fairly end of time the prophets have one thing in mind
The 'anti-Christ' will ensure their demise
Divination or prophecy through reading signs in history
The portents of the sky our last devise
He rules the earth like god or king, religious worldwide following
And brings down the birth of a new breed
It's the lack of our morality, the loss of love and sanity
The answer to all the fears we seed
At this time there's some belief
That the anti-Christ may has been born in '62 but far away
The perfect time on a perfect day we were torn
There'll be a time coming when we will lose our lives
There'll be no hope or sin
When redemption comes from god within
Each religion, in its own way, has foretold the coming of a great
saviour and pleasures for their souls
With not a single trace of sin, god disappeared
And enslaved the king that's what they have been told
The revelation of the world, prepare yourself for the worst
No need to flee from the lies
We've lost compassion for the poor
The reason what we're living for
A cultured way of suicide
Signs of extinction everywhere, in 2012 a new despair, a mortal fear
Behold and learn the truth about these prophecies
They're preached around the world
