My head is pounding my flesh's getting weak
I'm hiding my pleasures behind
Burnt out like a dead religion
My heart is aching as you crush my pride
I'm torn between love and hate
And victimized my soul
The sky turns grey as blood runs dry
So I did what I had to do
Refused to believe, only a precious lie
The will to survive, we embody the demise
There's no shelter for my sins
There's no way to leave behind
The fear to cross the line
There's no shadow as I pass
There's no mountain I must climb
Only the fear to cross the line
This is where my path leads me
I'm bonded and tied up like a slave
God may forgive or god may save
Devour the soul that's guilty
Sorrow turns to hate, you seal my fate
The thoughts of perfection enslaved
The truth remains to guide the way
These blessings won't take away
The presence of evil, the source of all fears
I swallow the pride that remains throughout the years
