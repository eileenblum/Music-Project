I am the one, I can turn to the sun
Here in my own destiny
I used to bleed, like a suicide I need,
How come, I'm my own enemy

Don't you have the strength,
No desire for shore,
Weakened by the haze
I discovered your weakness
I'm heading to fall
Returning to hit your face

I'm looking over my shoulder
So I see..

Do you hear, I'm the fear of a shadowland
Kiss the dirt, taste the pain,
Your heart in my hand
And it hurts in my brain, and my head would spin,
Let me down, don't give up, don't give in

Never alone, never too far,
Now when I'm here on my own
Cut off my pride, but I'm still alive
Watching the daylight to come.

Thrown to the gallow, forgotten and sore
Nothing's forever and so we ignore
Come see sadness you never saw
I'm something a painter drawn

I like the way that you let me
in your dreams
