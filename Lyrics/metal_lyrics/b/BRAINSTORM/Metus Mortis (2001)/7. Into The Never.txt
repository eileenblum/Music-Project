You know it's much too late,
'cause your destination ends ahead
where the water turns to steam
into a suicide machine

Capture the moment before it's gone
You've got the strength to carry on
Not always knowing, what's wrong or right
Your only choice is to decide

I'm back to take for you the blame
Here to receive for you the shame into the never

Fingers of fire, coal and lead
Fondly love me till you're dead
Now you never will believe
You're dying to leave

Don't you feel my twisted mind
All you got is hate for mankind
Caught in a spiral, into the black
No need to see, cause I'll be back!
