To find myself again,
The walls are closing in
Everything I make seems to take

Buried inside you,
Strangers I once knew,
When no one would take the blame

I put my trust in you,
pushed as far as I go
and for all reasons
there's only one thing you should know

Never mind the unseen, clouds fill my head
Blind without truth in a word
Watching over your steps
Weakness sows its seed
And I still can't sleep

I'm insane underneath your breath,
Who was supposed to feel the shame
It doesn't feel the same
As I feel no pain
there's no choice
better hear my voice

I found escape through dreaming,
have I been this before,
and then came the pouring rain

feeling the reaching over me,
my black sky
wondering what ever could it be

I try to hide away
There's no shelter to find
I've felt this way before,
so insecure
