A bleeding heart, a seal of fate
There is no crime, I'll reinstate

Love is a weakness, Lust conquers all
Cross my soul and hope to die
Where do you draw the line?

Enter my mind, can you stop the rage
No one shall mourn or pity your grave

Believe the lie, the line that you toe,
If you just do, do as you're told

The meaning of lust
The soul of life
When you're screaming from the sky
It's now or never
Inside your brain
It's a hollow hideaway

Out of pride, I'll isolate.my fears
Never turned my back on why you were here

Mapped out in scars, look to the skies
Your only salvation, so close your eyes
