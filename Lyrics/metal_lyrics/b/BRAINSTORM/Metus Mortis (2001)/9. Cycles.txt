Who do you wanna believe
Where do you want me to hide
You just can't escape your past
A vision from your mind

What do you think, and what do you see
What do you read in their eyes
The promise cast, the hopeful lured
Stabbing by the pointed words

Make me
Help me try to understand
Hate me
Just because of who I am

Over the walls
where all your memories are lost forever
Hiding in your soul
I've seen it all before
Into the madness of the unknown now or never
Cycles forevermore

Why do you tell what you feel
Why do trust in the lies
High paid thief, another vote
Sharpened lies cut your throat

Lack of faith and hell awaits
Would be my destiny
For what you feel is right and sane
Instinct stifled be ashamed

Leave me
Believe me, emotions are running low
Break me
My hate that always grows

Save me
Sacrifice me, soon my reign will end
Heal me
Control me as my tears descend
