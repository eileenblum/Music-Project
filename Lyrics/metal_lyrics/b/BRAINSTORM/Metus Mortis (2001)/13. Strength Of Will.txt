You came to see, but you can't believe
Forever creation has conceived
The echoes of fate, a voice from the past
Innocence lost so long ago, until the last

Have your own god to whom you pray
Just let you be your own way
To show what you have done
That shows what you've become

It's like religion without believe
So they're forever in your mind

You loose your pride and face
My wounds are bleeding still
Your mind starts to fry
strength of will

Born to a world, so young and proud
But over your head hangs a cloud
to build up around them a infinite wall
Don't you know just who you are

Within a world of hate
There's no trust and there's no end

All pain sifts through your soul
You feel your back against the wall

You loose your pride and face
Your eyes open wide
Your mind starts to fry
Ripping inside
