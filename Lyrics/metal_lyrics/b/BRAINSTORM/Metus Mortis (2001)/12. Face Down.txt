[Bonus Track]

A little bit of love to grow
Give me a sign, I need to know
I've seen the way you've been stealin' with those eyes
When all is said and done, time marches on

Here in my deepest dream
Running through another scene
Any trip I make
No matter what it takes.

I cannot take the blame
for thoughts you send
But I can't play the game
Around the bend

Do you understand why
Exploring all the fear you hide
head strong I know, that I'll prevail

After you left behind
all the tears that you've cried
face down in my arena you'll fail

I'll get my independence free and clear
When this day comes I'll disappear
Someone take this cold from me
Let my mind run free it used to be

The trust I had has died all my words been proven lies
My senses under siege
Ingest the virtues I feel

A far, hidden place
It makes me feel safe ..
Consuming all you can
Wealth and stature makes a man

So now you know my name
Inside my mind
I am a man insane
my fear, my lust is all you find
