Looking back I smile at the voices in my head,
That always said to keep this place secret
a spell that allows me to see
Because of all the subtle words,
I hear you scream

I've tread and spanned the horizon
To cross the blood red
I strike down the faceless and unknown
Now I'm branded

I fall down into your own despair
Voices within
Show me how and show me where
Blind suffering

Let me in, get me out
Lost my soul without a trace
Found it again in my secret place

The final tear
Will be lost in rain
First comes the light
Then comes the pain

My body trembles in fear
No longer controlled
Watching my dreams disappear
In the palace of gold
