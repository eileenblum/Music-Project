What do we need and where do we go
When we get where we don't know
Tell them what they wanna hear
but what's the meaning

Always knew it was them or me
I always knew what I wanted to be
So many things I just can't explain
Is this the reason.

Too much tension brings me down
Touched and found and turned around

I'm really lost in fear and sin,
thinkin' how it might have been
speaking my mind to those who find
under lights made me blind

Read the rights a prophet's word,
we've learned to deal with the absurd
Scorching the edge of your soul
lust of season

Forgotten heroes, piles of dead
Colors change from green to red
Hurt's so bad, it's been so long.
I'm coming home

Taste the blood that I long for
A beating heart, slow and sure
Bless my soul, time has come
Innocence been long gone

All the wrongs just can't be right
Hear me scream and feel my bite
