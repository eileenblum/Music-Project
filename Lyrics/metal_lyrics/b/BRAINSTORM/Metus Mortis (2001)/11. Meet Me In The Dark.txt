This temple that's built so well
To separate us from ourselves

The shadows of fear, now over the land
In pain will your life surely end
Your addiction has brought you here
The consequences are too clear
Meet me in the dark

Your face is nothing than a transparent fixture,
Perception is nothing but a distorted picture
Now you resent what you became
The reality of only you to blame

Who's in your mind and who will command?
Now you'll face the truth and understand

My heart, my hand, always reaching.
Without you within, I was searching.

Meet me in the dark
Full moon is burning down
Meet me in the dark
My infection is going around
