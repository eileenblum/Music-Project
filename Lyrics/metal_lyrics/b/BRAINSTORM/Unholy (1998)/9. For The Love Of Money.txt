Money makes the world go 'round
I'm sure you know the rules
people say you know the way
to change lead into gold
greed will take you higher than the sky

What you need to feed your greed
is more than credit cards
lookin' back in history
it seems there's nothing new
always wanted more to trap your soul

Everybody knows you're just a busy man
everything you got is not enough for you
never enough

For the love of money
your greed is all in vain
For the love of money
it's driving you insane

The more you get, the less you give
you keep it for yourself
hurry up you got no time
you gotta earn some more
everyday your money seems to grow

And still you're driven by success
you like to have it all
get the thing you always want
no matter what it takes
you would sacrifice your flesh and blood
