I never really meant to hurt you
it was the only way to keep you be my side
the kiss of death is what I gave you
I know you're never coming back to me

This love was meant to last forever
I took your heart and I took your soul away

You told me we were goin' nowhere
but like a fool I was beggin' you to stay
I know you're lookin' for a new thrill
it was the only reason why you had to die

I'm lookin' up into the sky
I've realized love is a lie

Maybe a kiss before I'm leavin'
'cause time is rolling on and steals the night away
I told you once don't say it's over
be sure I really hate myself for this
