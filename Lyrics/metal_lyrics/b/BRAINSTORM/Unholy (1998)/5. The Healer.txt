Stand up you sinners
you have to confess
send me your money
and I will forgive
you'll get the healing touch
as soon you send me cash
gettin' my blessings for a fee

He is the only one to save your souls
just pay the words he preach
and you can be the one

Fake healer
heaven is waitin' if you pay the rate
faith dealer
you made your religion, creatin' your god
dream stealer
never a thought for the souls that you rape
brain twister
preachin' the lessons you claim are from god

Wake up you sinners
kneel down and pray
get rid of all riches
and you will be free
I know it's not too late
to was your sins away
I can release you for a fee
