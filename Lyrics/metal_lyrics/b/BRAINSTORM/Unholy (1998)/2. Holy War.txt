Stir up the nation into war
they will believe the things you preach
just need another thrill indeed
still got to prove you're never weak

[chorus]

Calling for the holy war you always need
in the name of your god you won't fade away
promised all a place in the hall of fame
you know they'll follow you whenever you must go... to fight

Seducer of a nation blind
they're givin' you this sacrifice
just instigate the poison seed
a need to feed the flames of hate
