I'm lookin' back
throughout all time and history
when people raised the flags
to get rid of all tyranny
how many times
how long will they control the fate
everywhere the people fight
oppression all the time

Revolution is what they need
Revolution is the answer they give
they're fighting back for what is right
to get the rights back

Rebellion
to be free again
Rebellion
now it's time again

Always the same
and nothin' ever changed for me
I always try to break the chains
that hold my freedom down
I'm underground
some blame me for the way I look
I've got enough to prove
that I'm as good as other ones

Revolution is what you need
Revolution is the answer I'll give
I'm fighting back for what is right
to get my rights back

We carry on
it's rebellion that they want
we don't take the blame for the misery
that they create
