Time for resurrection
I'm the evil breed
I'm watching every move you make
you better kneel and pray

I'm a friend of Lucifer
I'm here to judge your sins
I'm the one you've got to fear
I'm gonna strap you in

Pain Here comes the pain
I'm burning in your soul
Pain Here comes the pain
I'm like a dog off the chain

Like a chain reaction
exploding in your brain
I'm watching every step you take
until your blood runs cold

I'm a friend of Lucifer
no chance to hideaway
I'm comin' to drag you away
into the lungs of pain
