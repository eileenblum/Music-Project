We sink and drown
we're bound to fail
it seems we are to blame
for this disaster
some not afraid
some don't feel scared
they never feel the shame for what they're doin'

Father forgive us for we know not what we do
nothing would ever change our ways
everyday this planet earth is dyin' more and more
is it too late now?

Into the fire we burn

It's sad to know
It's bad to see
that we have turned to oceans
blue to gray
We broke the rules
we've talked too much
never a thought about the world
we're always raping
DOG DAYS COMING DOWN
Another day messed up again
I'm really bound to fail these days
I've got no place where I can hide
I'm down on my luck again

I've never been a superstitious fool
this life is just a bitch to me
tell me what's wrong

Dog days comin' down
it's the time when you're just loosin'
Dog days comin' down
I can't make this sacrifice

I never thought that I could fall
and I can't come in from the rain
too many things went wrong again
ti takes away my piece of mind

It's like a monkey on my back again
just like a needle in my skin
ain't got it right
