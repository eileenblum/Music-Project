Only heaven knows
what I'm supposed to be
do I pretend to live again
is there anybody out there
will somebody save me
is there anybody out there
before it's gonna break me

Over and over and over again
I hear those voices
over and over and over again
I'm goin' insane

I hear these voices everywhere
they never dissappear
seems like I'm drowning in illusions
deep down in a hole
there's no way out
I keep on prayin' for a saviour

I'm trapped in a land of confusion
emotions turned to stone
I'm searching for a ray of hope
the answer of all answers
I'm twisted forever
I'm twisted by pain
I don't remember anything that was
feels like I'm rotting away day by day
I'm losin' my mind
