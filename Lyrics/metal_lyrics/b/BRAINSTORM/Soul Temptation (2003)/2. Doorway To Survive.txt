[use your head and think before you speak!]
[discover the fear... alter you aggresseions!]

every word that you say, every lie i can hear
every moment of weakness you do
tell me why you are here and what's meant to be
will be discovered by your enemy

my time has almost come to rise
to open up your mind

turn into the fire, the truth will be heard
enlighten the black of your soul
to light up the spirit and keep you alive,
this is the doorway to survive

what ever happens, tell me who's to blame?
no hope but my questions will remain
ignored by the system, no truth comes about
i'm falling in fear again

up from the unknown, i'm here to rise
but there's not much time...
