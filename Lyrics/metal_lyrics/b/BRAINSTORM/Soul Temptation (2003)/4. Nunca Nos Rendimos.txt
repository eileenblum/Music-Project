[ - racial divide... racial reconciliation - ]

Inside a dream where no one can see
shifting the shadwos from my own memories
same quilt behind an imitation
just take your troubles as they come
but can't escape why did we get it wrong
a twist of fate, same black situation

it causes me pain, same blodd in our veins
but they won't hide as parts of me have died

why do we ignore the words
the price to not be heard
a circle, more or less
nunca nos rendimos, aqui estamos otra vez!!

close to the flames, just seems like hell
faicing the truth not the answers they sell
don't let us fall back, you can't bring me down

apathy kills anger its disturbing the peace
try not to be quiet, destroy the disease
it's all in you plight, it's all you should know

get out of the way, the clouds in your mind
just make a change and banish the blind
