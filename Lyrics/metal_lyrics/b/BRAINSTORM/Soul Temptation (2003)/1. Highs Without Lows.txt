[ the experience of life shows different ways...]
[sometimes up... sometimes down]

when you told me that i've been here before
can't remember, can't say much more
can't resist the call and hide my reality
our diefferent thoughts my blurred imagery
don't know why i and what i'm waiting for
i should belive and not ignore
a perfect foil to try and understand,
not to give up, not a helpless end

as long as i'm comin' through
you leave me confused
i've been hurt this way before
you can't bring me down no more

when evreything's out of my mind
out of what was left behind
i would have liked to say i know
cause no one has the hights without lows

now i'm leaving for and passing out the blame
i'm sick of being down, it's time to be the same
the cutting silence thats every thing i hear
all alone but my pain won't disappear
and my trust in all the words to say
will never make a difference anyway
and the time has now come to do me wrong,
may someone else ask you what you've done

here i am to save my soul
not to be just left behind
deranged not lose control
it will ease my mind
