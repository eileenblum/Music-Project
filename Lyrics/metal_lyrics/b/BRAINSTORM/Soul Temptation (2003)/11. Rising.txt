[- to antagonize violence in the neighbourhood active -]

Where no one hears your whisper
and no one knows your name
my eyes to hear, my tongue to see to feel again the same
the cause of life don't trust another outstretched hand
challenged dreams, fear of hope you try to understand

when you're dreaming you're not sleeping,
but never had a choice
pay the price, the fear within, the absence of voice

The sun is rising, estranged but i can crawl
the sun is rising, with my back against the wall
release my soul and mystify to fight my violent lies
betray you to your enemies because of your immoral life
i know you thought i'd turn away,
have nothing left to say
my blessings and the things you hide, it happens anyway

do you regret and think about the point of no return
words not to be ignored
from history we should have learned
