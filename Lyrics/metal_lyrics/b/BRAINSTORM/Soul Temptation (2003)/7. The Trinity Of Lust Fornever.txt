as the white in my eyes turns black today,
whatever it makes me blind
what took me so far away,
there's no one by my side
help me, i'm searching for some qlistering worlds
as darkness rears my head
you think i'm a drifter but i'm chasing my dreams
as satin covers the head

i'm touched by the magic... as she's moving fast
can't miss her laughter behind satin mask

where gold made you learn to treat me like that
my heartbeat feels like a knife in the back
your fingernails are painted red
scratched by a demon from toe to head
now and forever...

as you seemed to care, you stab me in the back,
all i hope is to survive
so how do i feel as i make the worst mistake of my life
i'm touched by your lips, while you hold me down
as we're here for hours
inside the steam, it's not what it seems,
as i lay in between campaka flowers

how can i ever .. get up off the ground
feels like everything comes crashing down
