[don't fall into error, beresy, and atheism]
[and don't allow anyone to abandon to commit]
[murderous wars and massacres]

betray your friends and regret your life
for all the words you said
you pull my string and cut the line
around my head
you fingertips will burn my soul
and reflect my life, i'll raise my hands against you
all my longing to survive

i'll go as far as you want me to now and forever
as the smoke pours down on you

leading on me, when emotions all have left my
.. leading voirces, and why are we here
as i'm leading a dream with all the memories in my mind
.. leading voices, so why are we here?

another faith i'll find me in
after facing all my fears
your pride turns into a deadly sin
as the dream appears

religions i used to know now and forever
things we shared so long ago
now here i am, i won't be found
cause i got no religion
don't turn your face down to the ground
whatever believe, as now we are free
somehow slow revovery
release yourself ... for immortality
