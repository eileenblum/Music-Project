[- Social isolation -]

i always have fantastic plans no matter what to do
i hide my fears and leave you here
as rain falls down on you
do you believe and don't you know
the way it's always been
i realize that you don't care
about the hate i've ever seen

so hard to bear with you not there
but really no one seems to care

something inside is dying outside
flicker on a screen, unsure of what it means
something inside is dying outside
make it to the end and never try to befriend

i wake up in a desert land, i hold my head down deep
with all my inner sufferings i'll never fall asleep
this heart of mine, tortured in dreams,
too much to stay awake
the scars of fate, i lost my faith
its more than i can take

you struggle just to stay alive
but only the strongest will survive
as really no one seems to care
your fate will meet you everywhere
