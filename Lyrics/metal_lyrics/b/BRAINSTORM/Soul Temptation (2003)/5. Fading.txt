[the invaluable pride ... swatted by the shine of their coins! Corruption! Handle the truth!]

the leading to where no one has nothing to say
whenever you'll be gone tommorrow but here today
you've never been the one i always wanted you to be
alive inside your dreams but haunted by a fantasy

wasting so much time with you
your breath it reeks of sin
saving everyone i once knew

you hear a sound of laughter is fading slow
fade in a world, all you see, more than what you know
when all your tears and laughter are coming through
beyond the truth, but still there's nothing left to do

start thinkin'for yourself with dignity and pride
you better try and learn the thoughts you can't hide
in search for what is known but still it feals lik the same
you better quest the answers before you place the blame

echoed dreams of all your fears
leave this world behind, where nothing real appears

like voices from the dead at home
my wolrd of dreams was never meant for anyone
