[- anonym faces behind technical walls... weak identities... too easy, too strange... too faceless! -]

i don't need to state of mind
don't need no provocation
something deep inside of me, i call it liberation
as i know the thing i've done, so scared to be afraid
silent baiting, will you be there when i awake

ashamed is how i feel,
never used some words to steal

my fingers to the head, like i'm nailed on my skin
fingers to the... shattered dreams, escaped within

pus me down and watch me bleed
for your sadistic need, in ervery second you don't care
i will destroy your violent seed

behind the key pad there you hide your weak identity
with every single word you type your strange philosophy

have faith in me, my failures will never be...
not innocent no more, listen now to what i'm fighting for
