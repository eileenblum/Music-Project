In the silence of the night, I'm losing faith for selfish pride
Where all my dreams and hopes have gone
Moving out of sight for everyone.
I'm falling deeper and I can't believe
In everything that's meant to deceive
I'm casting off memories that darken my mind
But there will be nothing more to find

I'm feeling like I'm all alone
I dread to think I'm on my own
The pain I chose, the sacrifice
The love we had now trapped under ice

I can't believe this moment in my life
I can't recall the real behind the lie
I refused to feel the wounds in my heart
When it all fades away I'm falling apart!

After you believed me you see the real behind the lie
After you decieved me, I can see the evil in your eyes

Now as I feel down and low
I'm victim of your damaged, so leave me alone
There goes my reason with no sense of doubt
Take all the grief, let the poison out

Despite what you think, despite what you say
It makes my heart bleed, don't throw it away
I became what you mostly hate
But I'm fighting my way through before it's too late

A lovely embrace we once shared
Replaced by a cold and hateful stare
I took it for granted but you brought me down
Can't you see what you've done, take a look around

I can't believe this moment in my life
I can't recall the real behind the law
I refuse to feel the wounds in my heart
And all the fades away
I'm falling, falling apart!
