Erased by the dark
A confession and place to be
I'm hunting myself
I'm not willing to see

Illusions concealed
Illusions of memories to come
Uplift my emotions
As I come undone

So, so far away of life
The call of the mistress alive
But you, you keep away from life
You see all the memories inside

Eraser or saviour
Erased by the dark
Eraser and saviour
Erase these dreadful dreams in me

No secrets inside
There's nothing in to hide
The more that you take
The frames you break

Now trapped in the dark
When all your walls close in
A sequel in life
Where only you're caught in

And so here it comes to pain
Afraid to pass by
And tears fall like pouring rain
We crossed the line

Eraser or saviour
Erased by the dark
Eraser and saviour
Erase these dreadful dreams in me

Eraser or saviour
Erased by the dark
Eraser and saviour
Erase these dreams

Eraser or saviour
Erased by the dark
Eraser and saviour
Erase these dreams in me
