Breathe in, breathe out,
every rule i break every soul I take,
sweet caress but dead surprise,
the fire sleeps but burns inside,
from the cold, to the flame,
you dare to tell me lies and bury me alive,
what's deep in my soul,
keep you forever mine, until the end of time!

You watch me die another day,
an endless price I had to pay,
I feel the heat on my face,
but it's all right, yes it's all right,
what you see beyond my mind,
the flames fade to the other side,
my scars are burning bright,
it's all right, now it's all right.

Firesoul, I'm coming over it, I'm about to forget,
all those who cheat and lie, will now be crucified,

you fooled my soul's desire,
now a frozen heart and soul on fire,
I feed your flesh but my hands are cold,
while bearing down my firesoul.

My chance to be reborn,
the devil in disguise turned my dreams into lies,
my sudden faith is all in vain
as I taste reality again,
there's no wisdom without end,
the lights seems to shine but all the pain is mine,
I'm down on my knees,
with open arms begging please.

The fire kept my soul awake,
I'm lost but found another way,
all the words that kept me blind,
that's all right, yes it's all right,
Now your sins will prevail
but now you're open to the pain,
for all the secrets that you keep,
that's all right, yes it's all right.
