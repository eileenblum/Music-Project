I don't know where I'm meant to be
Screech streams are following me
Memories of flesh are calling my name
I'm breaking the walls with everything I can

I'm standing on the edge
I'm becoming a ghost
Withholding the final step
But I'll take back the thrust

Voices inside you
Nowhere to escape
We're walking the wire
We are descendants of the fire
Voices behind you
But you've come too late
We never taught fire
We are descendants of the fire

I can't afford the price to pay
For being alone, you stripped my soul away
We're already facing, I can't get a grip
The fear is chasing me on a painful trip

Painful trip, and the way it goes down
Bleeding life from me
Know I'm wielding fire
This is my advice

Voices inside you
Nowhere to escape
We're walking the wire
We are descendants of the fire
Voices behind you
But you've come too late
We never taught fire
We are descendants of the fire
