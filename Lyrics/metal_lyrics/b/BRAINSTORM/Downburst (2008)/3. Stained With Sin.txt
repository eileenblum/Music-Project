I'm weighing out what I've done
I'm beginning to dwell since I'm the only one
So I choose my way for all to see
No time is lost; you seek my trace
I free my soul from all the haze
The voices speak where the hearts will meet
But still I wander through the dark
I have heard and seen these dreams
There's no use to hold 'em back
I only have myself to blame
I'm stained with sin in this world I'm in
When will pleasant dreams arrive?
When do I lose my alibi?
But I have no name, still it's all the same
You forced me to wake at night
To live the dream and hold on tight
My enemies are falling down to the ground
Though everything is black with me
