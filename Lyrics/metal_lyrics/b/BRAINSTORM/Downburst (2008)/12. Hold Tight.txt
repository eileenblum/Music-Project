[European Bonus Track]I feel you with me every day
Wake up and look around
My tears are lost in falling rain
And still I hear your sound
Many things that I've done wrong
I'm longing for your touch
Loosing myself all day long
And still I miss you

Haven't seen your smile
For such a long long time
Your forgiveness keeps us strong
So strong

Hold you tight so close your eyes
Alone inside my heart you'll stay
Forever you and me
And all I ever want is you
Together we won't fall apart
I knew it from the star

Everything went good with you

My lesson I have learned
There's so much love left for you
This broken heart will turn
Should be a million miles away
You're always by my side
No matter where the roads go by
For you I give my life

Haven't seen your smile
For such a long long time
Your forgiveness keeps us strong
So strong

Hold you tight so close your eyes
Alone inside my heart you'll stay
Forever you and me
And all I ever want is you
Together we won't fall apart
I knew it from the star
