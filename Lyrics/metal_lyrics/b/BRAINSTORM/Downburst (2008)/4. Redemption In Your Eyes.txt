The future hides your history
When it comes to the end
Like a dream, it fades away
You're too tired to defend
You stood there waiting for the dawn
Searching inside your haunted soul
The brightest light will shine so strong
You better do what you've been told
I see your soul got torn apart
I seal the pain in your heart
Stay alive and close your eyes
As you fall from the sky
Your soul is lost, the hope has died
Let the stars be your guide
I see redemption in your eyes
Your flesh and soul are only mine
To search for answers I can't find
I had to do it by myself
You gave me love, you gave me hell
These wounds are bleeding my love for you
Damned to the end, it's coming through
Tortured and tangled, I still remain
Heaven's burning once again
Again your soul got torn apart
I'll seal the pain in your heart
