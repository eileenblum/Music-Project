"My words are like a fire", says the Lord
[Jeremiah 23:29]

As fire hits the corner of your mind
Where illusions reflect and dreams collide
You never do anything in between
But the fear you hide burns here within
Your charred and darkened soul, burned by the flame
It's bursting out in rage and all in your own name
Fire in the middle, fire to your soul
You know what it means, you're damned to flames
Fire is (no) salvation, closing on me
Nothing will remain
I'm on fire ... so walk with me
Fire consumes and annihilates
Fire sheds light and warms your hate
You're walking into realms of light
It heats up your fear until you can clear your mind
As you reveal the truth of your inner views
You surely won't regret the self respect you lose
