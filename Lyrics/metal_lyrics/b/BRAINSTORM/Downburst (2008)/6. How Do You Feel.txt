Don't be tricked by what you see
There's nothing left for you and me
I"ve been right but you've been wrong
That's why I'm back
There'll be no hope and no relief
You changed your mind and changed your dreams
Under a dark polluted sky
Nothing is for certain when we die
See the days float through your eyes
Still I don't know what you were waiting for
How do you feel, show me how to breathe
With ice in your veins you scream
And you get what you need and whatever you want
You're lying to yourself again
Why everything is still the same
I don't know what you're getting into
But now you feel me
You should give back, these wounds are deep
For those who paid the price and suffered for your needs
