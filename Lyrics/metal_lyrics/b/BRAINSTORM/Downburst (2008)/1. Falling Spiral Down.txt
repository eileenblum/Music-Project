All the dreams they once were mine
Like shadows they passed me by
I wonder how god can resist
Try to taste the sweat on his lips
If only for better I float in fear
He forgot to remember I can never get out of here
I'm falling spiral down
Falling six feet to the ground
Do anything to hear me scream
Falling spiral down in my dreams
These wounds are bleeding his hate for me
But he leaves his marks all over me
No need to feel so tired and sick
He'll paint me red all over it
I ain't worth a cold thin dime
He's so damned sure that I'm a waste of time
