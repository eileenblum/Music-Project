Where life turns cold, you hold me tight and bury me inside
You never let me see the sun, keep me away from life
My heart stops beating, you close my eyes, I was lost but now I'm dead
I'm scared to death, drink blood like wine and fire burns my head
But everything remains out of reach
Your smile and laughter makes me cry, to dream is what you teach
Now I'm frozen inside my mind
When I'm frozen to ice
Now I'm frozen but I'll arise
'Cause my hope is alive
Now let me wake up in your arms and let my spirit die
The sound of laughter, dead and gone, memories eat me alive
This time I'll burn and taste the pain, feel my destiny
The end is near; I drift away within a thousand rays of light
Remaining thoughts of you don't let me sleep
I'll pass and stride on till the end, but now I'm falling deep
