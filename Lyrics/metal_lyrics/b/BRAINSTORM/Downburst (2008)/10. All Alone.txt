Heaven's no place for me not even hell
You burned all the good things again
I walked the earth and crossed that line to find
A place to go a place to dwell
Where do I run, where will I hide
I'm warning with my fears
You see the blood drop from my eyes
But still you'll return and take back my tears
I would do anything just to hear you scream
Now you will make me fall but only in your dreams
Despair is just my part of life
I'm cryin' all alone
I thought I'd left it all behind
But I feel like my hope is dead and gone
Not looking back again I'll start a new
And cast a shadow of myself
I read between the lines and save it for the cruel
It's my tale I have to tell
I'm on the road to nowhere, I don't know what's true
