I am the key to unlock your door
Ask yourself what's worth living for
Whispering voices will fade to dust
You put an end to all your fears
I'm beggin' in my knees
Can you tell me right from wrong
I think you know which side you're on
Surrounding walls are killing me
My head vibrates and begins to bleed
I'm thinkin' back on my memories
I curse the heaven above me
The loneliest feeling is hiding inside
And either way you changed your mind
You hide youself as making weaves its silent end
I'll suffer on and hold your hand
