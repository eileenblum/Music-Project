Where no one hears your distant cries
Where you end up, there you stand
Your life has passed before my eyes
A crime of passion once again
I curse my fate, but know too late
I will leave by night and leave by day
I pledge my heart to serve the truth and reinvent my life
I am the echo of your past but leave no trace behind
I'll disappear without a trace
Protect my from myself
The truth upon which I agree
I'll open up and breathe
Unable to escape my life
My heart is split in two
I'm left with nothing to survive
My scars remain, the pain comes through
With all the wreckage of the past
Where all my dreams are built to last
Or what it seems to be or what your eyes just cannot see
With these reflections all around you leave here without a sound
