[music: brainstorm / lyrics: franck]

swallow me
as I become a living dream
don't fade on me
don't let me down,
these memories still haunting me
but there's nowhere to run
a tragedy my head spins round
all I try to find out why all
these words leave me in doubt
when the sunlight fades away
I feel like my life's on hold
a storm is moving in on me
now I know what I've been told
another journey through my soul
I've built myself to last
forever here but never passed
I know I'm lost
my soul is gone
I pay for my crimes
a shattered ego in my mind
all I try to find out why all
these dreams leave me in doubt
