[music: brainstorm / lyrics: franck]

Someday you'll see
there is no cause
if there are some
who share your thoughts,
you're afraid of the truth
so I will understand,
If ignorance is bliss
it's the meaning of the end
wisdom voices are guiding me
your meaningless words
not worth the air I breathe,
but this is life
this is dark
this is tearing me apart,
this is what you believe
but I won't surrender!
something went wrong
all along the way,
are we meant to take the pain
you think the time has come
to set it straight
never again
will my life be the same
wisdom voices are haunting me,
no questions to be answered
now I'm free
