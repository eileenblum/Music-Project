[music: brainstorm / lyrics: franck]

this is not what I am looking for
no matter what you do
you have no soul, there is no fear
there's no turning back from here
there's only one way out you'll find
I can see forever
you're walking on a thin line
into the never
everyday is up to you
none will see the world as you do
nothing's ever built to last forever
in these walls you will appear
if it's dragged away from the never
where you spent your soul
and all your fears!
every breath drawn like your last
when you've escaped another past
among the clouds and on through time
these are black clouds that roll on by
if you're up there in the sky
as the minutes have ticked
your life away
in a world without sense
you crashed your own existence!
there's an ending left behind
swallow your pride
in a deficient mind.
