[music: brainstorm / lyrics: franck]

when will it end now I'm falling
falling apart at the seams
I'm running through life
I'm trying to reach my dreams
somehow I can understand
how can I deny
I never meant to cause you pain
remaining cries
get me out of this hole
I just can't help it
living loaded
with my back on the wall
do you understand
I miss the touch of your hand
come over me
in the blink of an eye
don't you understand
I miss the touch of your hand
take all of me
in the blink of an eye
I'll go somewhere where I can breathe
breathing on my own
why do you save all the trouble
and pull yourself down
what's taken away is the price you pay
my heart got lost
tomorrow will be gone before you know
never again will I trust
wish all hatred could disappear
the loss of feeling
enter me, save me
I could see more clear
