[music: brainstorm / lyrics: franck]

where do we go from here,
what in the world
can make you mine?
in my dreams I hold you near
don't let the feelings
pass us by this time!
the feelings that we feel
are black and white
how can we subside
all that we are in life;
all the memories that we share,
all the answers they don't care,
all the memories and every pain,
it's just an illusion
still quite insane!
what have we become,
what is real
is the thing we feel,
we might be breathing still,
as we open our eyes
we watch it heal,
the only thing that makes us
feel anything at all
is what our dreams uphold
