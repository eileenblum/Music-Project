[music: brainstorm / lyrics: franck]

You're feeding my mind
but I won't let you in
my world has changed
from an insight into a dream
itâs a matter of speaking
but my thoughts
become frozen in time
remember my forgotten past
but I'm the last of my kind
here I sit alone
in a temple made of stone
face to face Iâm here to dwell
I take myself out of this hell
I would pay whatever
to make things right
but it's only a few words to say
but I'm driven by the demons inside
chronic depression grabs hold of me
but I won't let these demons win
I will set myself free
