[music: brainstorm / lyrics: franck]

you think you know what lifeâs all about
but there's nowhere to hide
and nowhere to run
this is my life, broken for you
blessed are the blind, my favorite view
but something inside me is still alive
it seems that my soul has survived
no one can escape your web of lies
no one can escape your dreams
no one knows where my future lies
when I'm out of sight!
if you can see please give me a sign
I'11 look in the mirror and see the line
I cannot leave my ways behind
and seek for weakness below the line
you confess my sense of guilt
cause you've been in darker places
wherever I turn there is pain
I know that evil has many faces
what's yours is mine
as I am proceeding into your mind
no one can escape your web of lies
no one can escape your dreams
you were never supposed to be
so get your sickness away from me
