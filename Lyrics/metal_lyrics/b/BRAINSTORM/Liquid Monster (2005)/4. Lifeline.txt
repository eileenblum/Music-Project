We're breaking through and now I'm here
You'd better listen to things and show no tears
On the line, awake to see
Again you've got to capture me to set me free

All the laughter in my brain
All the memories drive me insane
Time to change my thoughts for you
I feel your breath but what can I do?

I stared you right between the eyes
And put your life on the line
I stared you right between the eyes
And lay your body next to mine

Through temptations all around
I make the tears come out of you and let them drop down
You're the victim to stir my pride
I'll try again to find a passage out before I lose my mind

That's all I'll do, that's all you need
Unfinished business, I'll make it complete
You can't take it, it's so unreal
What you deserve and how I feel

I stared you right between the eyes
And put your life on the line
I stared you right between the eyes
And lay your body next to mine

Your desperate tears you cried in vain
Don't fool my friends it's treated all the same
That's what I do, that's what you need
Unfinished business, now made it complete

I stared you right between the eyes
And put your life on the line
I stared you right between the eyes
And lay your body next to mine
