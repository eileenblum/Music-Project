All the words you said to me
Are bleeding me dry
All those colours you've shown me
Are fading away and I ask myself why

Through the looking glass
I'm too blinded to see
You shall not fall, neither shall I despair
In some way you'll remember me

You're blessed by the fate and it runs through my veins
Your mind's gone astray and you don't know my name

Inside the monster I'm alone
The nightmare continues and I'm on my own
Inside the monster I can see the force
I'm haunting my fears, I'm inside a war, inside the steam

The candles are burning out
Nothing ventured nothing gained
You never know where life will take us
But I hope to breathe again

Am I wasting my time
Am I losing my pride
Sift through the darkness, all I hope to find
Are the things that you hide

Escape from those things you put me through
I'll surrender but now I've failed you

Inside the monster I'm alone
The nightmare continues and I'm on my own
Inside the monster I can see the force
I'm haunting my fears, I'm inside a war, inside the steam

You're blessed by the fate and it runs through my veins
But now I'm free of the fear that you obtain

Inside the monster I'm alone
The nightmare continues and I'm on my own
Inside the monster I can see the force
I'm haunting my fears, I'm inside a war, inside the steam
