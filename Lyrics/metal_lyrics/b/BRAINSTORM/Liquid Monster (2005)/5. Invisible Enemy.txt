In the absence of light all my voice I've been giving
It turned me around and got me believing
You're watching my world but I don't mind
My soul begins to scream, it's a matter of pride

Soon my dreams will disappear
Caught somewhere between my fears
A poisoned mind conspiracy
It calls my name, the invisible enemy

I came across all those things I'd never have seen
Long after dark I still try to fall asleep
My tongue betrays my fears and mind
Who I once was has slowly died

Soon my dreams will disappear
Caught somewhere between my fears
A poisoned mind conspiracy
It calls my name, the invisible enemy
