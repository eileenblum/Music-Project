Can you ever release me
Or do you fear the pain
You're the better part of me
And it doesn't matter where you've been
'Cause I'm counting broken pieces
And I'm taking over to the light
I fall asleep to meet you where
All my fears and dreams unite

Wherever you are
I'm hiding myself behind
But the sadness in your eyes
Makes me hold you tight

Never meant to lie
This is the last good bye
There's nothing else to do
When worlds are comin' through
Almost read my mind
Afraid of what I'll find
I'm coming closer to you
When worlds are comin' through

Why couldn't you tell me
About the perfection of pain?
Now you're coming over
From breaking all the boundaries of shame
But every time you think of me
I'm coming through walls
And picking up the pieces
Right before the darkness falls

There's no more laughter
There's nothing left undone
I'm leaving this insanity
And I'm leaving on my own

Never meant to lie
This is the last good bye
There's nothing else to do
When worlds are comin' through
Almost read my mind
Afraid of what I'll find
I'm coming closer to you
When worlds are comin' through
