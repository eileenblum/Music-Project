I'm trying to forgive you
I'm trying to forget you
I'm trying to believe the words you said
I'm trying to regret it's in your head but now...
I hate the way you talk to me
I hate the things you'd like to see
I hate the words that come out of you
It's more the fear to love to hate you

Despair to drown
Every moment that goes by the future disappears
Despair to drown
As I'm running out of time my world dissolves in tears

I can't believe what I've seen
I can't believe it's not a dream
I can't believe it anymore
That my belief is like a whore
They pull the strings and lift you up
To end your life or interrupt
They pull the trigger in the name of god
They pull the plug... so thanks a lot

Despair to drown
Every moment that goes by the future disappears
Despair to drown
As I'm running out of time my world dissolves in tears
