The smile in your face hits the dark light
Another day passes you by
Try to escape fro within to the outside
But something tells me to stay

I'll open my eyes and I'm losing it all
And again the pain slips away
There's nowhere to hide but it seems like
You ask yourself why do you fear the day?

You're in my dreams
I'll focus my attention
As I'm browning in cries
I'm close to the edge, there's so much fear deep inside

So far away, I fear your sorrow
We all go blind if there's no tomorrow
So far away, I call it hollow
The mask of life brings no tomorrow
So far away

I'll face the rage and escape from within
I'm crawling out the walls where you locked me in
Those acts of sin made me your slave
Trapped inside my world, where nothing is save

You hear me whisper when I try to speak
A waste of time cause you make me sick
With no redemption my soul will be burnt
You try to teach me what you've never learned

You'll escape from within
With all your thoughts you make it fade
The darkness is coming in
While I'm breaking up but for you it's too late

So far away, I fear your sorrow
We all go blind if there's no tomorrow
So far away, I call it hollow
The mask of life brings no tomorrow
So far away, I need to breath
The mask of life shows my believe
