I can't believe...
For a moment in time I got rid of myself and acted like a clown
For what crumbles and burns but still I'm around
Now I'm losing my faith...
I'm ready to speak while all the lying is making me weak
As this is not what I seek

But do I deserve to walk away
I've tried to make it through
Seems there's no place to stay
As long as I don't know what went on with you

I should have known, right from the start
And turn my back away from the dark
Now I'm on my knees or walk the wire
Don't hang me high, even higher

Oh, I'm not like you at all...
But your words will keep me awake at night
Still in my ears and all in the mind so I turned on the light
But now I'm on my way...
There are things in life I cannot choose
I was trying to trace your path but there's nothing to lose

Remember these words I've never said
Why I would never let it go
But I didn't really feel the cold at all
As long as there's no one to hold

I should have known, right from the start
And turn my back away from the dark
Now I'm on my knees or walk the wire
Don't hang me high, even higher
