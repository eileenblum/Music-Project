You're trying to take what's in my mind
For all the pain that I shared with you
I'm losing my faith, from one direction into another
No faith, but I know where you're going to

Within your need, you're here alone
These empty rooms you call your home

Someone's around you and someone will care
It burns my soul and you'll be aware
That someone will die for and someone will cry
It burns my soul and clears my mind

Look at the passed time, my reason to live
Your hate inside will get you nowhere
But don't touch my mind, don't try to make me afraid
Now I'll surrender but it seems that no one cares

The stench of my sin is surrounding me
Through your disguise I brought you to your knees

Someone's around you and someone will care
It burns my soul and you'll be aware
That someone will die for and someone will cry
It burns my soul and clears my mind
