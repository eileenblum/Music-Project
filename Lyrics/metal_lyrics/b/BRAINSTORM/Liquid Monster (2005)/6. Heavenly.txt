Here I am, never found the words to ask you why
I've seen you laughing and see you cry as you walk by
You've been to where I'm from but my dreams will take you there
It's all in your hands, don't wake me up and meet me there

And you wonder how I ever could have been so blind
I believe in you, you've never been on my mind
Heavenly home of my dreams
Too close to see, you captured my heart
Heavenly home of my dreams
Colour my tears, where dreams fall apart

So if you're going to save my words all the words I tried to say
And I guess all my fears are just a breath away
Maybe I'll find a way and another chance to be sure
You send a smile to my skin, like you ever did before

Can you really show me how you feel inside?
As for the first time I'm looking in your eyes
Heavenly home of my dreams
Too close to see, you captured my heart
Heavenly home of my dreams
Colour my tears, where dreams fall apart

But it's bending my mind again and all that it's supposed to be
You were always there but you better get your hands off me
Heavenly home of my dreams
Too close to see, you captured my heart
Heavenly home of my dreams
Colour my tears, where dreams fall apart
