Through the eyes of a man to his soul deep inside
Illusions appear as the morning will rise
It makes no sense to me
Oh father can't you see

My desperate need to be together
Now I'm leaving my fears to hold on to never
There's no one beside me
The answer to the mystery

Away from the dark and the night
I'm away from the years
I'll never leave the pain inside
And hide myself in tears

All I hear now, these words you say
All my thoughts drive me hopelessly insane
All I see now as I lie awake
Sell your soul, never to return to life again

I'll take a look at the sky where the night turns to day
My depression descends now it's time to pray
It's no more what it seems
Like in your wasted dreams

Swallow my fears and illusions of lies
The truth always hurts, so you're telling me lies
Your words in mind I lie awake
Wondering how much I can take

Tearing up the place
As I wait for this to pass
When my heart begins to race
All I hear is the sound of falling glass

All I hear now, these words you say
All my thoughts drive me hopelessly insane
All I see now as I lie awake
Sell your soul, never to return to life again
