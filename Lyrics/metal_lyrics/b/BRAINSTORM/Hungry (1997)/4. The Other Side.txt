I'm on the road to nowhere
don't know what is waiting there for me
somewhere I see a white light
I close my eyes, I'm sailing far away
I had enough to fight another day
I feel the urge to leave
No longer life in shadows
now I'm the chosen one
I close my eyes forever more
Take me to the other side
close the door beyond the light
Take me to the other side
where no sin grows
where no sin lives
where unholy power dies
I'm flying to the light now
into the hall where judgement awaits me
I here some distant voices
I know I hear the people pray for me
I'm on my way, my journey has begun
my candles have been burned
