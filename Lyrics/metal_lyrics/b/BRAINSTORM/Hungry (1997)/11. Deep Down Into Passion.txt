I am your one and only friend
I'm your saviour, take my hand
I'm your pleasure, I'm your pain
I'm the demon in your brain
I'm here to drag you far away
believe in me, believe what I say
I am the maker of the way you feel
you never leave the darkness
Deep down into passion
i'm in your blood
Knee deep and getting deeper
i'll numb your pain
Filled up to the limit
you know i'm real
Deep down, deep down
deep down into passion
I'm your shadow, I'm your light
I am the one you never fight
you know I'm all you'll ever need
in your head I'm the demon seed
I am the key into another world
I am your god, you know I'm here
I am more than meets the eye
I'm in your soul forever
