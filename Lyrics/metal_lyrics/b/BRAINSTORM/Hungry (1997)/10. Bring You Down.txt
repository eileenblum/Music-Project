I hate the way you lie to me
you just ignore me
I hate the way you breed the rules
you dominate me
you say we have to give a social sacrifice
I know I'm victimized
you rape the nation
Down, bring you down, bring you down
bring you down
You tell me how to run my life
you crucify me
I've gotta pay for your mistakes
I feel the anger
You say we have to give another sacrifice
you need an alibi
to fool the nation
They are the masters, we are the slaves
we're just like human puppets, dancing on strings
I'll never trust you, I know for sure
I'm sick and tired of all your empty promises
