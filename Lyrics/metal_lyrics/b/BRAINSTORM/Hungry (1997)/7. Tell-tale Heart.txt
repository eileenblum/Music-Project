Nobody knows about your secret
nobody knows what you feel
Under cover of the night
pain and blood on innocent white
Slippin' into dark emotions
heaven turned to hell
your wounded soul won't give you shelter
only time will tell
Tell-tale heart
and you wonder why
you can see the rainbow dying
Tell-tale heart
and you wonder why
you can see the black rain falling
Nobody knows about the shadow
that you've seen on the floor
Under cover of the night
you find yourself forever in shame
Every night you say a prayer
and cry yourself to sleep
every night the same desire
to leave it all behind
