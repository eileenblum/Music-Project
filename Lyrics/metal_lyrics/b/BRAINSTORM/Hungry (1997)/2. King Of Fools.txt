What kind of thrill are you looking for
you say you've got a reason to uncover your soul
you better not tell me you don't feel your shame
too many people now know your name
you sacrifice your secrets to the masses
I guess you're not the only one
Another time, another place
Another fool, another face
Another rat race
Let the show begin, when the puppets dance
King of fools, King for a day
What kind of mind are you living in
moving like a train into a big black hole
I know you think you're born to be a star
but when it's over, you will be the same
still got the problems, still got the pain
don't you know it's a liar's game
