If only I could trace that light
To ignore the blind
But you don't know
so go ahead and find your sight
I'm out of my mind and now it's time,
to count the bodies dead
last thing you know
a place to go you better check your head
You can never justify, no more reasons to excuse,
And you never can deny (all the tricks you try)
I can't understand, what's between you and me
and I feel no shame what I used to be
so I try to hide and deny my thoughts
What I keep inside, I'll never look behind
Hold your head up, bite your tongue
So you dig your own grave
Speak your mind or sell your soul
stand before you fall
I've walked upon the water
without even getting wet
and there's really not a thing
that I regret
everything I used to be has spiraled into insanity
every night I sweat and bleed
