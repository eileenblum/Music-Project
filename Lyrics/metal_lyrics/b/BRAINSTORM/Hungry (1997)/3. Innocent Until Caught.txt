I had everything
it never was enough for me
to be free
I ride the wings of destiny
breaking all the rules
I have to set my spirit free
I'm gonna show you what I need
Seems like it's just another game
escape from nowhere
I'm making other people bleed
just for the thrill
Innocent, innocent,
innocent until caught
I'm like a renegade
I broke the chains of innocence
on the run
I've sacrificed my blood for free
time to free my soul
you won't chain my will again
I'm gonna show you what I mean
Feels like an endless odyssey
out of the shadows
what they gave is what they got
I'm bound to lose
Breaking all the rules
I had to set my spirit free
now I'm free
now time is running out for me
my blood runs cold
I feel no shame for all my sins
and now I'm gone my soul is free
Seemed like it's just another game
I escaped from nowhere
I ride the wind across the sky
no more pain
