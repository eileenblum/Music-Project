You say to me I'm guilty
for things I've never done
I'll try to show resistance
I'm out to prove you wrong
I hate your accusations
your cheap and nasty tricks
I'm not your private target
don't treat me bad again
I'm calling your name
what's your excuse
I'm saying to you...
You'll try to find a black sheep
you'll try to steal my show
you've tried to live in heaven
but all you got was hell
You've tried to find a stranger
just even by yourself
you're eaten up with envy
the answer of your lies
I'm calling your name
what's your excuse
I'm saying to you...
...don't blame me liar's edge
