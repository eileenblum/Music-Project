Drowning in your misery
you've reached the end of nothing
you all think you know the world
just leave it all behind
you say you just got a pain overload
your soul died a long time ago
Feels like tomorrow never comes
you ride on wings of broken dreams
Feels like tomorrow never comes
deprived of all your self esteem
Another day in misery
you take the road to ruin
all your sorrow pulls you under
time to draw the line
You say you ain't got a reason to be
there's no need for pain anymore
