[duet with Ralph Scheepers]

I've got no chances to break the spell
feels like I'm standing next to hell
like a waterfall I hear you rumble
feels like a neverending rain
Everybody knows you know the world
Everybody worships you
Hey, hey, mr. know-it-all
I know i've got no point of view
Hey, hey, mr. know-it-all
tell me what you want
I've got no chance to break your will
I know I'm just here to pay the bill
like a ton of bricks you're on my feet
feels like a neverending pain
you think it is your divine right
you think you got it all
