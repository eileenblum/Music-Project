All those words you hide inside won't last forever but they'll come true
I'm lost in the cold where rain turns to snow
I'm losing my mind there're no highs only lows
And you see my tears freeze on my skin
Confused by the dreams and illusions inside
The memories you fear are the shades of your pride
Whatever remains, it won't be the same
You're screaming out my name when the snow melts around me
But I can't take back those woeds I said, much to my regret
All those words you hide inside won't last forever but they'll come true
I'm on the edge of dark and light and something more than what I knew
Reflections in my mind of something I once knew
Time drifted away but your day came true
One second to leave's like nothing for you
You're nowhere to be found as I've looked around
I'm here to bleed, my world's standing still
The haze inside my brain, I can't get my fill
Whether sorrow or pain, all looks the same
Am i supposed to be the one to set the snow on fire?
It will begin to burn within that's for your desire
