A satanic dimension.
Religious groups promise redemption in a new and different world.
They tear you away from your family and friends and destroy your soul.
There's no reason not to believe in yourself.

So long ago, I think it's so far way,
so many dreams gone by, but still on my way
in different worlds I've been,
searched through different times
another perfect day I know, again I'll try,

this time, I'll have no mercy,
don't care who you are,
I'll praise the lord
I hold my head up to a burning star
in fantasies my life makes it hard to complain
the demon and the holy ghost
teach me how to learn.

If I see you next to never
Day after day
How can we stay together?
If you turn me away

Demons walk over glass from a thousand mirrors
I saw my reflection stare me down
Underground, there you'll find
that your faith is your fear
Dream to fly, reason why
now we know it's why we're here

Welcome to the third demonsion, now here I am,
the innocent are trapped inside
others far away in a land
so litte hope remains alive
I only pray the dreams I leave you will survive

I see you now or never
Day after day
the tears are gone forever,
If you turn me away
