The truth hurts. By destroying the world we destroy ourselves.
We have been silent far too long, hiding in anonymity.

In a world, polluted inside,
corruption and chaos around,
the meaning of life, the principle right,
nothing in the depth of the light

You hear the screamings of the one
who soars upon the wind
He'll take you in his arms into a place of sin

Tear down the walls forever,
come down to break your chains,
it's time to break the silence
never run, you'll never run away

Watch out for, a torturing lust,
in mirrors you're facing the truth,
the hunter is back, the soul of a life,
wings of sadness blazing for you

a speeding slab of concrete hits me in the eye
no time to rest, no time to loose,
it's time to die

Tear down the walls forever,
come down to break your chains,
it's time to break the silence
never run, you'll never run away

Broken memories, salvation denied
Burning ashed they choke,
rip off the skin, from deep down inside,
molten fire flies through the sky
