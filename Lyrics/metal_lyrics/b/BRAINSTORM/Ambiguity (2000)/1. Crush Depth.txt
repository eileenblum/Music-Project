Free your mind and the rest will follow!
Say what you think and think the way you feel.
It takes today's inner strength to make it through tomorrow.

How much time will it take
Till I know I'm stronger now,
how much brightness can I stand
before I see the light and how

Do I have to say the words
or do I have to face the fact
When I'm looking through the glass,
shows me memories to forget

Security success, shines on a pedestal
Swallowed in by your peers
Destructive atmosphere

So you're lost in the mind
and deeper you'll find
Crush depth to the end of light
forever you're here
I shed no tear
Crush depth to the endless might

screams in agony,
I lick my wounds and still
it's hide and seek
secret's found in therapy

I hear you coming faster
I can hear you down the hall
I'm out the door, I'm breaking through
I'm comin' after you

Security success, shines on a pedestal
Swallowed in by your peers
Destructive atmosphere
