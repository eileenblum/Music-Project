Step into the light and join the everlasting battle between good and evil. 
A battle of the minds being fought each and every day.

Coming out of the black, taking over,
it's my way down, when I'm here alone.
Am I supposed to pretend I don't feel the pain,
like it happens again

Destroyed, we watch you bleed
coming through, what you need
My faith makes you cry,
handfull of lies

Out of my sight,
and out of my mind
but the vision is still the same
Arena
You'll never know why,
the skull of the blind
welcome into my arena

And we die, and we breed,
waisted hands that need to feed,
got to fill my empty stare
You're broken by words,
you're whipped by the lies
but they won't bring me down.

Shadows fall from the sky
Summon all to, heed their cry,
tempted in sin, it's no fate,
gather the souls, they hold within

so for the world, who's to blame,
woke up wet from a dream
tempted in sin, it's no fate,
gather the souls, they hold within
