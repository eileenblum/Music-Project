[Bonus Track]

He's back! Painful memories and a restless soul cause him to come back,
back to save the souls which he lives off. But... he wants to save us.

The decimation of all that is pure,
a system that feeds their machine
with the souls of the lost,
destroying all from the known to the arcane

Reminding voices you fear since a long time
Darkness falls upon souls
Be blind to yourself, the evil inside,
manipulation of all your dreams

Crawling memories ment forever
The angels will sing the song for you

Someone save me.........Revenant
Send me a witness
You'll stand or burn

Looking down upon a world
desperate changes it goes through
in the arms of the lost, created by souls
the inner flesh, a deeper control

When you parted the sea
Will you save us from mysteries 
The tears of remorse
Too late for regrets
Another world to forget

You watch'em comin' one by one
You're on the prowl and they're on the run

Someone save me.........Revenant
Send me a witness
You'll stand or burn

Now you parted the sea
And you saved us from mysteries 
emotions are gone, the suffering inside
Is this the truth , that you feel
