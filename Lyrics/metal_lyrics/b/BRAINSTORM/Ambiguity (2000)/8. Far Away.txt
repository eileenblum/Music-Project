To miss someone can be the worst experience you ever made.
Hold on to your dreams, you will remember the good times, they're waiting for you.

It's been a long time coming
I'm tired of failing you, face the truth
when you're by my side
Choose to be blind
Change your mind

I loose my way but still you understand
Just hold my hand,
and always be so sure
Can't you ignore
drowning in...in a heartache

Aimlessly rushing leaves you with nothing
you need me,
I know where I'm going to,
Gonna take me there to you
nothing more to do

So far away from me
Something's comin' over me
So far away from me
Be forever the man I should be

Another dawn is yet to come
Carry on
The night has just begun
Troubled days have come and gone

How can I prove,
that I've done nothing wrong
all that I want
And it's plain to see
Don't blame me
When the moon gives it's light,

what takes me down to hell
I'll fly into a church of dreams,
they ring the bell

Hopeless souls, let you down
blame on myself,
Throw my heart in the wishing well
