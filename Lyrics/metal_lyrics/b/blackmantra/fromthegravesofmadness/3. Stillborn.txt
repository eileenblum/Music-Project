Crushing visions 
Of a mortal man 
Soul collisions 
In death's hand 
Brain incisions 
Of the laws of man 
Crawling in venom 
The stillborn remains 

Through the sins of time 
No more lies 
Your soul sighs 

Tears of blood 
In desert sand 
Flooded emotions 
A putrid drainage 
Womb's rape 
A beast masquerade 
Crawling in venom 
The stillborn remains 

Through the sins of time 
No more lies 
Your soul sighs
