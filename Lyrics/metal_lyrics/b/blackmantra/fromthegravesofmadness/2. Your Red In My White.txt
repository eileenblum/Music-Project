Looking at you 
I don't know what to do 
Beauty fills my eyes 
While I see you cry 
I do not distinguish 
Your pain from my love 
Razors cut your body 
Now we are one 
Your dead eyes 
Makes me fill you inside 
And I like to see 
Your red in my white 

In your skin 
Purple shades of love 
In your face 
Pleasure like a drug 
Your red sweat 
Dropping in my ground 
Bathing sins 
Of our souls 
And your dead eyes 
Makes me fill you inside, baby 
And I like to see 
Your red in my white 

Behind the leather and spikes 
Only a bitch inside 
Why you're afraid? 
I thought you might like 
Liquid love 
Through your wounds and scars 
Good night, angel! 
Dead girls don't tell lies
