The rooster crows at the cemetery 
Lighting your old memories 
Your blade is could like a gravestone 
Cutting the flash until the bone 

The blood boiling in the offering 
A curse spreads across the wind 
Diabolic shapes in your crawl 
The serpent comes at the last call 

A left-handed holds the clock 
The death point is the elder knock 
His fire flows like a bloody wine 
Reaping the ignorance of time 

"Stand up and raise your left hand! 
Repeat after me, sentence by sentence the words I'm about to say:
I deny Jesus Christ - The deceiver, and I abjure the Christian faith, holding in contempt all of it's works (hail Satan!). 
Ave Satanas! (hail Satan!) 
Hail Satan!"
