From the graves of madness 
Your lies come true so well 
To destroy all the falsies 
Make more one spell 

Open the gates of vicious witchcraft 
From the dark side of my head 
Lost in my cosmic illusion 
Searching the path 

Woman, well... You lie so well 
Making your christian soul hide under the cross 
No more wait to destroy my last faith 
Smash my eyes, show the truth again 

To end my humanity 
A kingdom born into the flames 
I see you spreading the fire 
Bleeding the hate 

From the graves of madness 
Your lies come true so well 
To destroy all the falsies 
Make more one spell 

Open the gates of vicious witchcraft 
From the dark side of my head 
Lost in my cosmic illusion 
Searching the path
