[Music by N. VeljoviÄ / P. PavloviÄ, Lyrics by A. StojkoviÄ]

So proud and so alive,
a new horizon spreads in sight,
Stay strong don't lose your mind,
no place for sad song tonight. 

Each day - a wonder unseen
the pleasant breeze and fields of green,
Embraced by love, the air we breathe
and we are free, free to live,

Free to roam this world forever,
to create and give,
To be a part of the circle of fire,
for lifetime's burning desire, 

Stay here, right by my side,
and then we won't be so blind,
Here comes the path so wide,
don't have a sad song in mind.

Just one spark can light up the flames,
but lack of vision can keep you in dark,
Life seems to be a child's game,
only when nothing can do you harm

The new day gives birth to a time,
when everything's alright,
We watch the dawn and smile,
and the sad song is far behind.

Free to roam this world forever,
to create and give,
To be a part of the circle of fire,
for lifetime's burning desire, 

Stay here, right by my side,
and then we won't be so blind,
Here comes the path so wide,
don't sing a sad song tonight.

Right here -- the passion alive,
Immortal man -- but only for a while,
It's just a blink of an eye,
still, it is worthwhile.

It's worthwhile - every single day,
each and every second of your own way,

Free to roam this world forever,
to create and give,
To be a part of the circle of fire,
for lifetime's burning desire,

Stay here, right by my side,
and then we won't be so blind,
Here comes the path so wide,
and a sad song is left far behind.
Right here -- the passion alive,
Immortal man -- but only for a while,
It seems to be a blink of an eye,
Still, it is worthwhile.
