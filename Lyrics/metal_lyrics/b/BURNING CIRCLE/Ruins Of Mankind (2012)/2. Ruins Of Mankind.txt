[Music by P. PavloviÄ / R. NikoliÄ, Lyrics by A. StojkoviÄ]

Wake up! Don't step aside for another rule!
Welcome - to this godforsaken world!
Everything was born to grow.
And rising just to fall
What happened to billions of people?
No trace of them at all!

People pretended they don't remember
The past decades,
The downfall of honest man,
The corrupted government,
The war crimes, genocide,
Blood and soil, then the air raids
The fields of corn are now the war zone
For an outdated armament.

We're our worst enemy,
Bailout - save us from the jail
We trade our gold for whiskey
And everyone's for sale
They want you to dream
And you should never wake
To prevent you from seeing
The world so wrong and fake!

What happened to honesty
Wisdom and sobriety?
Nothing seems to be a virtue
Unless you get paid
Material and moral crisis
The crumbling of society
Like someone cursed all things
That man has ever made!

Stay calm in this world
Of misery and disgrace
Keep quiet as they
Stamp their trademark on your face,
Pray for a miracle
Soon you'll meet your fate
And keep on dreaming
That it's not too late

No use - all the wealth
And profits that you gained
And all you've ever earned
Now it's all in vain
As your flesh and bones
Turn into the clay
And only ruins
Ruins will remain!
