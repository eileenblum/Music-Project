[Music by P. PavloviÄ, Lyrics by A. StojkoviÄ]

We seemed like brothers,
But now you're gone,
I've got no dreams left,
There's so much left unsaid
I feel deceived, I feel betrayed
You left me alone, to fight against myself,

I hear your endless screams,
In my restless dreams,

Why am I still struggling?
I keep fooling myself that without you
It is still worth trying.
Time can easily erase me,
I've got no spirit left to see,
That today another one is dying.

I hear your whisper -- ''come with me,
Join in with me, we're bound for all eternity''

And every night I see your face,
We drown in tears,
And in my every dream
I can hear you
Calling me,
And all my life I've known,
Kindred spirits - meant to be
Our paths have crossed,
We've mixed our blood
We're sharing the same destiny... no more

But tonight -- I'm the one who's bleeding
Only to show to myself
We may all be kindred...
