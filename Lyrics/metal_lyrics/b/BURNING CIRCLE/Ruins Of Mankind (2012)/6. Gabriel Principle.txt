[Music by P. PavloviÄ, Lyrics by A. StojkoviÄ]

The human nature -- war to end all wars,
The final conflict to settle up the score,
The gun in 'hand of black', aim between the eyes,
Angel of death -- devil in disguise,

The tools are ready, conspiracy's unveiled,
The trenches far and wide,
Balkan's fate is sealed,
The wrong people fighting for right cause,
The first act's smooth -- waiting for applause.

We believe 
in Holy Spirit of war,
Doomed to destroy
'til nothing's left anymore,
We claim your land -- on God's command.
Gabriel principle 

The choice of weapons, plenty of machinery,
The prison camps, extinction marks,
Death squads and Zyklon b,
The wicked creature, shrouded by pathology,
Sacrificing whole mankind
To some sick ideology.
The blood is boiling, vestals into whores,
Rape and murder, plunder and gore,
A little soldier marches and dies,
There is no mercy below the empty skies,

We can't let them do it anymore,
Or is the only chance to pray
For the final war?

We believe
in Holy Spirit of war,
Doomed to destroy
'Til nothing's left anymore,
We claim your land -- until the end,
On God's command.
Gabriel principle.
