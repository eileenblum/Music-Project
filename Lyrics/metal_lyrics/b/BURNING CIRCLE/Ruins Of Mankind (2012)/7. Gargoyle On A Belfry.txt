Lyrics by A. StojkoviÄ]

Even when the lights are gone,
He sits there cold and quiet,
Imprisoned for eternity,
Carved in marble white,

His face is pale, he guards alone,
The ghastly grin of granite stone,
The roar of thunder is his cross,
Leaden skies - his crown of thorns.

The square spreads before his eyes
As the temple defies the skies,
Cripples and beggars - the holy mass,
From baptism to the final rest.

The church bells ring, the choirs sing
The second coming of the king of kings,
Just noise that echoes in his ears,
Praying for the centuries.

All in vain, in vain, in vain...

Oh - will you ever lay your eyes onto my soul,
Oh Lord - rid me of my burden,
All of my life I've been guarding with my body
These cold walls - still my heart is burning.

Now lead me - into temptation!

So easy to fall from grace,
The church is crumbling down,
They spit in your face,

Where are the ones who you called the meek,
Those who'd turn the other cheek?

Only the vultures will survive,
They feast upon your bread and wine,

They'll scavenge and devour,
There will be no trace,
Of decent human race.

Oh - will you ever lay your eyes onto my soul,
Oh Lord - rid me of my burden,
All of my life I've been guarding with my body
These cold walls - still my heart is burning.
