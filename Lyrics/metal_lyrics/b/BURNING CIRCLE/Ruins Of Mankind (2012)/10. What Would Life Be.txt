[Music by A. StojkoviÄ / M. VeljkoviÄ / P. PavloviÄ, Lyrics by A. StojkoviÄ]

If i could find the word, no one has heard,
I couldn't be more wrong, still the same old song

Fear me not, cause all i've got,
Is here and now - the one and only shot

So how about some old fashioned love?
Steal the part of forever
And frame it in each others heart

Hold me close tonight, I feel i'm drowning
All i needs your smile to cure this frowning

Take my hand and hush my cries
I'll live with you fairtale tonight!

What would life be without love?
Lonesome forever,
Only sorrow and eternal dark!

I don't know about friends
World without friends
And friends helping hand
World without help,
I don't know about passion
Between woman and man
World without man
I cry tears of forever
I linger forever
I Envy the infidel
Me and myself
Alone in my heaven
Or is it hell?
Alone in my hell!

Steal the part of forever,
And frame it in each others heart!

What would life be without love?
When it's raining in heaven
And skies are falling apart!

What would life be without love?
Lonesome forever,
Only sorrow and eternal...

What would life be without love?
When it's raining in heaven
And skies are falling apart!
