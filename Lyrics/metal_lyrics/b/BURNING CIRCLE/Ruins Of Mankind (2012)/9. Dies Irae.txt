[Music by P. PavloviÄ, Lyrics by A. StojkoviÄ]

Who will be alive to witness the splendor -
To watch the brilliant dawn?
When everything will perish away,
All futile beings, all we've ever known,
When the day of wrath is near,
As we look towards the blackened sky,
And for sure on that day some may live,
But many more will die!

There will be no sorrow, Dies Irae!
There will be no tomorrow, Dies Irae!

Standing in line, one by one,
Mortals marching on,
Sinful every living creature,
Only because it was once born,
And the dead resurrected,
Rise up from the ashes, up from their graves,
On their own, and so alone,
Now washed away by eternal waves!

There will be no more crying, Dies Irae!
There will be no more dying, Dies Irae!

There will be no filthy hell, Dies Irae!
There will be no calls for help, Dies Irae!

There comes the judgment soon, Dies Irae!
There will be no ending too, Dies Illa!

What Would Life Be?

If i could find the word, no one has heard,
I couldn't be more wrong, still the same old song

Fear me not, cause all I've got,
Is here and now - the one and only shot

So how about some old fashioned love?
Steal the part of forever
And frame it in each others heart

Hold me close tonight, I feel I'm drowning
All i needs your smile to cure this frowning

Take my hand and hush my cries
I'll live with you fairytale tonight!

What would life be without love?
Lonesome forever,
Only sorrow and eternal dark!

I don't know about friends
World without friends
And friends helping hand
World without help,
I don't know about passion
Between woman and man
World without man
I cry tears of forever
I linger forever
I Envy the infidel
Me and myself
Alone in my heaven
Or is it hell?
Alone in my hell!

Steal the part of forever,
And frame it in each others heart!

What would life be without love?
When it's raining in heaven
And skies are falling apart!

What would life be without love?
Lonesome forever,
Only sorrow and eternal...

What would life be without love?
When it's raining in heaven
And skies are falling apart!
