I'm puzzled everyday to see the world is upside down
Punished honesty, while crooks rejoice in wealth
Meeting ends has become a living nightmare
Stripped of dignity, survival's all that matters

In silence the system will devour you
Your stillness is destined to desert you
We're losing our minds but not our souls
On the brink of desperation
I cry out for hope

Awaken now
Join me brothers and resist
I promise you tonight we'll make a difference

Relieve us all from the injustice borne within
Together we are strong
This can't go on, we must resist

Bred like rats by shepherds
Scourging underground
Living off the scraps which they provide

Sentenced to oblivion
Shouting at the walls
Seeking out the knowledge they deny

In silence the system will corrupt you
Your stillness will certainly allow you
We're losing our minds but not our souls
On the brink of desperation
We hold on to hope

Awaken now
Join me brothers and resist
I promise you tonight we'll make a difference

Relieve us all from the injustice borne within
Together we are strong
We can't go on living like this

Come with me
Don't let me down
We've come too far to turn around
We fight for something beautiful, you see
The pain that binds us will set us free
