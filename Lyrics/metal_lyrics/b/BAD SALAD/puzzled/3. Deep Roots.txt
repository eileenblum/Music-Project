You think the world owes you just because you were born
Think again, nobody owes you anything
You always give them war

It's always someone else's fault
Everyone's against you
Show your face and accept it
The problem lies in you

You never let go
You won't change a thing
You deserve nothing and your hands aren't clean
Remember there is life beside your own

Don't you feel?
You're bleeding hate
A rotten tree with the roots too deep
I don't think you have any soul

Take a look and see what you have built
Walls so high guarding nothing inside
Poor of soul and weak of mind
A blindfolded ego makes you live a misleading life

You went too deep to raise your throne
You're all alone and your hope is gone
There's no way back from where you are
Face your destiny
Redemption is far

Poison words are all you got
And cheating others is your game
A devil in disguise
Trying to live in the sky

Selling others dirty lies
Making your believers slaves
Then leave them behind

Take a look and see what you have built
Walls so high but they break upon sight
Frail as your soul, ruined as your mind
That blindfolded ego will be your demise

What did you learn and what have you gained
Treating others like shit, you have just yourself to blame
The world is spinning but you remain the same
You know, revolution isn't your name

What did you learn and what have you gained
Treating others like shit, you have just yourself to blame
The world is spinning but you remain the same
You know, revolution

Stuck to the ground
Feeding from fear
Your time has come
Your time has come

I'll be here when your kingdom falls
I'll be standing here to see it all
Your poison words won't convince anymore
I will watch you lose your own war
