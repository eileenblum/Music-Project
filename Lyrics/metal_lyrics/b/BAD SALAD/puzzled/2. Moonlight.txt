Pale as moonlight
Kindly smiling down
While remembrance fades away
Hard to feel it closing in

She's been there my whole life
Watched me rise and fall
With no sorrow on her face
Hard to feel it rushing in
Touching thoughts I long to keep

There used to be a time our hopes and dreams were realized
Caught in the beginning
Plans to live forever
As if we'd never change, I overlooked what really matters

But those days are gone now
And all that's left is an old man

Lost inside a blank mind
The lights dim down
And leave me out in darkness
But maybe once
I'll get the chance
To reach out to golden years
Through memories that revive me
And only then I'll be set free

Reel me out
Bring me in
Don't let go

Hold me tight
Keep me close
Forever

Pale, the moonlight
Brightly pouring down

Lost inside a blank mind
The lights dim down
And leave me out in darkness
But maybe once
I'll get the chance
To reach out to golden years
Through memories that revive me
And only then I'll be set free

Lost inside a blank mind
The lights dim down
And leave me out in darkness

Reel me out
Bring me in
Don't let go

Hold me tight
Keep me close
Take my hand
Stay by me
Forever
