[Lyrics: Caco GonÃ§alves]

What would you do
If you had one more day
To make things fine
To make them okay

A second chance to fix your life
To not throw the dice
For thinking twice
Not enter that car
Your home wasn't far
You had someone there
But you filled your emptiness in a bar

So would you have said you loved her that night
Held on to your children
Spoken your last goodbyes
Just one more day
To say what's inside
For mending the mess that you left behind

I've been so wrong and all the while I felt so right
The many things you learn when your beloved ones cry
No room for lies if you're to live your life in time

I was too selfish to see that I dug my own grave
Shunning the ones who loved me
My choices led me to my end
And the words I spoke couldn't be unsaid
The ones I hurt couldn't heal through my fame

Conquer everyone, anywhere
Such a pleasant man pretending to care
I denied my beliefs to believe in only myself

I've been so wrong and all the while I felt so right
The many things you learn when your beloved ones cry
No room for lies if you're to live your life in time

I used to have beautiful dreams on my darkest days
And look her in the eyes and smile
We all have to pay our debts somehow
Better late than now

I've been so wrong and all the while I felt so right
The many things you learn when your beloved ones cry
No room for lies if you're to live your life in time

How many chances does a man have to redeem himself
So many I let get away I blew them all too well
But I'm still here to face my demons or to suffer for my sins
When the sun is on your back
To turn around and face the light isn't an easy task

Inside it feels like something's urging
Time to come back or keep moving on
Suddenly the answers seem to be gone
No need for answers when the questions are wrong

If I open my eyes and get back to me
For this one last time all I want is to see
My beautiful wife smiling down at me
Saying "you're here today, make it count, live your stay"
Oh if I had one more day
