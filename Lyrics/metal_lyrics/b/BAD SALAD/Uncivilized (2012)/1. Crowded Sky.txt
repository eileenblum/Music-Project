Born beneath a crowded sky
Overwhelmed and clueless on your way
Torn between the vast almighties
Uninvited the tell you how to play

Hail, Fight, Fear, Pray
Commandments to abide by

Cries, Shame, Guilt, Pain
Minor casualties at stake

Kill, Lie, Bleed, Die
Don't look back, this is your guidebook

Drown, Hang, Burn, Rise
Never forget your place

Sitting back self-righteous leaders
Endorsing every slaughter
Why adore these faceless leaders
To learn this love is single-sided?

Wasted! Expended your life for a myth
What then? You've only so much to give
(Give me back my) freedom, my reason, my right to forgive
Take me! Better to die than submit

How can our options be this vain?
(Endless powers, yet interested in fame)
Time's shown their egos are full blown

Relentless hate
By heaven rewarded with
Lands, crowns, treasures and chicks

Corporate thieves, branded in holiness
Leeching on ignorance to feed their greed

Hail, Fight, Fear, Pray
Commandments to abide by

Cries, Shame, Guilt, Pain
Minor casualties at stake

Kill, Lie, Bleed, Die
Don't look back, this is your guidebook

Drown, Hang, Burn, Rise

Wasted! Expended your life for a myth
What then? You've only so much to give
(Give me back my) freedom, my reason, my right to forgive
Take me! Better to die than submit

Preying on those who pray
A setback to science
A threat to the human kind, don't you see?

Brainwashing followers
Sustaining the illness
A plague, as their books define
Let us be

Wasted! Expended your life for a myth
What now? You've simply no more to give
(Give me back my) freedom, my reason, my right to forgive
Take me! Better to die
