[Lyrics: Caco GonÃ§alves]

Breathing is so difficult right now
Nobody can hear me
Rest and peace are gone among the silent screams
In between the lines I've been
Searching for those memories I wish I could relive

Unconscious movements take me to places I've never been before
Friendly faces never looked as scary as now
Disconnected mind and soul, aimless wandering, nowhere to go
Vivid projections or memories resurrected from deep inside?
My own nature in protest

(Find)
I need to find a way to get my life back
Controlling a massive hate
Obsessive to stay sober from this reality
Shifting strategies to try to defraud me
All in vain

Everything feels like it's so numb now
And all the colors look the same to me
I can't hear my heart beating today
I only feel the cold blood passing through my veins

I chain myself and then release again
One hand holds me down, while the other`s reaching around
I'm on a bridge to nowhere
And I am desperate to get there

Amputated feelings, undeniable truth
Burning quietly and growing stronger
Can't face myself without blaming someone else
I'm hiding way longer than I thought
What to do when no prayer's been answered?
Where to go when I'm not lost?

Blurry vision, and my hands are shaking
Red paradise
I hope I am mistaken

Could it be this, my nemesis?
Could this be it my nemesis?
And I don't have the will anymore to bow before God
No will anymore

Try, and realize that it's better just to let it control than to put up a fight
Willing to renounce everything you believe in
When you see there's no more humanity
Close your eyes to see
You have already lost the game

Everything feels like it's so numb now
And all the colors look the same to me
I can't hear my heart beating today
I only feel the cold blood passing through my veins

Everything feels like it's so numb
And all the colors look the same
I can't hear my heart beating
I only feel the cold blood passing
