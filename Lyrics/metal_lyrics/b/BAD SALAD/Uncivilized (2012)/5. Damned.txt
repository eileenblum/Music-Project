[Lyrics: Denis Oliveira]

Feels like a long time since I've been awake
I slowly come to senses
And notice that I lie in the sand

Grey oppressing atmosphere surrounds me
Twisted shadows mark the ground
Crooked figures in the distance

How did this come to be
I don't remember many things
Can't explain, this place is so unreal

I get the feeling I'm alone
Yet the pulse begins to grow
Wandering through these wastelands

Confused, bewildered
Stranded in nothingness
So strange, deceptive
The bitter taste of truth

I had it all
A dream come true
Now there's nothing left to lose
A faithful love, a life in place
But I was guided into my disgrace
I threw it all away

I recall the day
When I heard the line
Old man came to me, and said
"You don't have to live in misery"

As he walked away
And I weighed his words
Thoughts of wealth and fame got the best of me
It struck me like lightning

Where am I? "You are here"
Rang the voice through my mind
"Dwelling down in the desert of the torn"

No escape from the pain that awaits you my child
What you've sewn you shall reap forevermore

Consumed by terror
Dreading the merciless
Damned off existence
A price too high to pay

I had it all
A dream come true
Now there's nothing left to lose
A faithful love, a life in place
But I was guided into my disgrace
I threw it all away
