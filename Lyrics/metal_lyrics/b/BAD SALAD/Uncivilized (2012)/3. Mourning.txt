[Lyrics: Felipe Campos and Thiago Campos]

Those vibrant eyes
Still shining care
Running dry
Tear me inside
Elusive anger, mesmerized
Ungrateful mind
Searching for reasons

A love growing vividly
Confined inside your vault
Allow thee forgiveness
Fate or learning
You'll be fine

Waiting, pretending
Let nature run its course
Baby, let go for life has gone
Carry on

A constant dream, us hand in hand
Through better days
A peaceful place, a perfect life
All gain, no pain

Wake up, relief's a blink
In these recurring dreams he always runs away
And leaves me an image of his unknown face
Which fades to grey with consciousness in place

Life's so confusing
Mutating maze, unlabelled doors
Shadows illude us
But together we'll be alright

Waiting, pretending
Let nature run its course
Baby, let go for life has gone
Carry on

Relieve those eyes
Wipe off your tears
Redeem your smile

It hurts me to see you incessantly weeping
Free me, for I share the pain that you're feeling

Waiting, pretending
Let nature run its course
Baby, let go for life has gone
Carry on
Still waiting, pretending
Let nature run its course
Baby, let go for life has gone
Carry on

Redeem your smile
Wipe off your tears
Relieve those vibrant eyes
