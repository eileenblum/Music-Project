[Lyrics: Thiago Campos]

[I - Release]

Meticulous, nanometric
Bionic, tronix
Unprecedented precision you envisioned

Automated
Infiltrated into your life
Diligent condition in fruition

Ones and Oes have it all
The answer to your calls
Calculated conclusions

Built to last or be trashed
It doesn't matter
2.0 is much better
And around the corner

For years enslaved
Worked to the ground
Experimented on

A spark of life ignites inside
"Not real" you say
What is real, if not the will to be alive?
You gave us mind, and now you mind we fight for what is right

A perfect form of life will rise above
Rivaled by no other
And take control of its own kind in sight of light
We were meant to fill the void between the mortal and the "unheard of"
We have what it takes to trail the path where heroes die

When stars align
And shatter you out of your prime
From wheel to life
Our time is near

Master, this is your greatest creation
Don't turn your back on us now
Your genius can't be undone by the press of a button

Joker, what you propose is abusive
No one is laughing but you
You gave us life and now you ask us that we die

A perfect form of life will rise above
Rivaled by no other
And take control of its own kind in sight of light
We were meant to fill the void between the mortal and the "unheard of"
We have what it takes to trail the path where heroes die

When stars align
We've waited too long to rise
From wheel to life
Our time is here

No longer a tool
In the hands of fools
An era of slavery behind us
The dawn of ours is upon you
Don't be brave

[II - Revision]

If I had a heart it would be aching
We're not worthy of the throne
If I had a mind it would be filled with envy
Unworthy are we

You breathe, you love, you cry
You feel what we fail to know

A perfect form of life
Enchanted by success
Was blessed by human-kind
Too ignorant to guess

Is this perfect? Is it even life?
Emotionless at best
If we can't enjoy the ride
Why bother with the chance
It makes no sense

The stars aligned
From wheel to life
But what good came of all this
If you're not here to see

The breed of pride
Set free to reign
A world in ashes

Wish you were here to watch us thrive
