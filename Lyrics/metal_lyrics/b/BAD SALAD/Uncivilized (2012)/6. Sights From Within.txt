[Lyrics: Thiago Campos]

Day after day
People living out their lives
Clueless of the wonders
The future has in store for us
Still, at times I wonder
Is this all there is to see

I'm struck by fascination
Admiring my own kind
Its gift for exploration
A curious nature, a beautiful mind
Still, at times I'm fearful
For our future
For all I've seen

Deep inside they've been haunting me
Unconscious revelations
I shut my eyes but never cease to see
Psychic sightings of obliteration

Comprised within my mind
Desperate to get out
The voices pan inside
And taunt me when they say

It's time, clear room
Renew occupation
You've had your chance but lost your mind
This time it's true
Brand new civilization
Renounce control, you're through, goodbye

Skies burning, ground shaking
All senses in shock
We've joked it but feared it
All part of the plot

Eyes open wide, in darkness, bathed in sweat
Consumed by fear, in tears, I don't understand
Why can't I rest in peace like everyone else?
My gift's my burden
And useless though it seems I try to reason

Please forgive us
We really meant no harm
We're only kids at heart
Orphaned by our god

Please believe it
Allow us one more shot
We're only kids at heart
Learning on the spot

I've tampered enough
The balance has long been broken
Your viral nature's beyond remedy
It's hopeless
The fault is your own
You've tipped the scale now pay the toll
The course you chose is ruthless
Your future's yours to mold

It's dusk now, embrace your fate
Too late to rely on faith
When all you needed was to look around you
But you insist and still refuse to see
That I pity your dying race
You're bright, but put it all to waste
All the while you wanted to live like beasts
Now, in peril, you reach out to me

Deep inside they're still haunting me
Unconscious revelations
I realize that it was meant to be
Psychic sightings of obliteration

It's time, clear room
Renew occupation
You've had your chance but lost your mind
This time it's true
Brand new civilization
Renounce control, you're through, goodbye

Skies burning, ground shaking
All senses in shock
We've joked it but feared it
All part of the plot
Abandoned, forsaken
True orphans of God
So fragile and helpless
Departing along
