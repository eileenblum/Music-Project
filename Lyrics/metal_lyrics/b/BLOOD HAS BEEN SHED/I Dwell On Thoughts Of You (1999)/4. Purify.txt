A malignant blackness invades the light you seek sanctuary but nothing's 
changed in the midst of conflict you are paralyzed opposition face to face 
don't beg for mercy it is to no avail led to the slaughter like a 
sacrificial lamb I dwell on thoughts of you where did I go wrong every 
consideration made swept away like the tide dig into the mud if you must 
find a foothold truth is a cancer to the heretic crush his rhetoric death to 
the ways of the degenerate lost soul confiscate purify look at yourself and 
expel the waste view obstruction unattainable goal strength alone is hollow 
wisdom's invitation destroy the carnal hostility becomes a trademark to any 
obstacle in your path.
