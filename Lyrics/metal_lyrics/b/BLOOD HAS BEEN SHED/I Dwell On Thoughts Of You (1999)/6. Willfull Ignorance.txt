Tearing flesh searing wounds of despair open for a lifetime a scarred 
existence never truly finding a peace a lost world breeding predators who 
hunt out of insecurity the pain of countless souls goes unanswered our 
response is void where were we then? we should stop this cycle but we 
nurture its growth tears flow and flow our reactions fall incredibly short 
from the needed action at some point we will have gone too far we do not own 
one another we must begin to nurture respect at some point we must accept 
responsibility I did not forget you in your pain I still love you I was 
there when you cried for help I did not close my eyes love at the cost of 
hate is what we have paid the fear of desolation bringing the chance for new 
life we should weep for you but where are the tears? we should punish the 
iniquity forced upon you but we close our eyes and our hearts we are 
responsible for your blood we are responsible for your tears we are 
responsible for your pain we must accept it we must accept this generation 
will pay for the blood that has been shed judgment.
