For the birth shallow and inferior thoughts and actions descendants of 
Adam's curse destiny plays its hand sowing the seeds of baal incubus ever 
deaf to the judgment seventy years of self indulgence the soul mourns the 
lust of the flesh consumes the eyes gateway of the beast the pride of life 
ascension of the body the beloved has fallen to the wayside brush aside 
sacrifice of life gorge on the blackness slacking the thirst on the innocent 
swallow and laugh it hastens the apocalypse moments pass considering the 
torn veil the heart lies the tongue deceives man brandishes the weapon thorn 
in the side of salvation with aggression desecration fills the air there 
will be a reckoning all is well the soul of man is at ease peace for a day a 
thousand years running to the water time stands still burn a chill follows 
the blood runs cold wrath fall and confess murderer deceiver you will die 
whoremonger you will die man of perdition you will die for all these things 
you will die.
