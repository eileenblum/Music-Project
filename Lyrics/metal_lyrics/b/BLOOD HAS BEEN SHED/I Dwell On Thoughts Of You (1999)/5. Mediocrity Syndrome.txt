A steady flow of bane runs through my blood and infection boiling seething 
causing a stench to my thoughts those around me mindless spineless weak fear 
ridden worthy of a fir of anger never seen before their thoughts should be 
destroyed fire consuming burning the flesh cleansing this world of its 
inequality the sense and value lost trodden upon tear tear tear I will no 
hold back anymore I will not fall victim to a system that holds down the 
truth a fine oiled machine which deserves to rust and die all to often I 
wake and realize my efforts are in vain nothing changes people follow the 
followers to the grave I want to tear my heart out and shove it down their 
backbiting throats and let them taste honor let it run through their veins 
like acid burning a mark of who I really am someday they will wake someday 
they will see and someday they will understand.
