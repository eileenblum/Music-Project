After all this time after all this time knowledge I've gained can be put to 
use my consumption of truth beckons me to the everlasting I now speak and 
accept responsibility for my actions a lifetime of this struggle results in 
the immortal your words will live forever in me you will never die rip 
through the fabric of birth my existence has always been known and I intend 
to benefit from the words written in stone I must not be silenced when I am 
vocal you are immortal I must not be silenced you words will live forever 
you will never die.
