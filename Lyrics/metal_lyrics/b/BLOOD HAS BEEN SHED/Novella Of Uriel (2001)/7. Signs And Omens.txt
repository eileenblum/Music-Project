you were always my everything
but sometimes ou were all I had
don't be surprised at the contempt in my voice
why should you be?
you have used your every word against me

you are deception personified
your illusions no longer hold me
I lost faith in what my eyes beheld
sightless my every turn
has been met with futility

what little I could perceive
ensnared my progress

lost lost in darkness i only fell faster
I followed you faithfully it was to no avail
I held you in the highest of places
and you let me down you failed me
I want my blood to ignite you hands
and you let me down you failed me
