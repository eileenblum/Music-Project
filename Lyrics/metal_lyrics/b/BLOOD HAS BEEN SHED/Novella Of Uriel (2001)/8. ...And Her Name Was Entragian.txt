I always thought I knew the right thing to say
but something died in you long ago
your words echo inside
like screams in an empty well
always wondering what I could have done

but I couldn't save you
you have always been my secret regret
your nails dug furrows in my wrist
as you slipped away
a reminder of my failed nobility

you were all I ever wanted

reincarnation - resurrection
call it what you will
if everything I've done could reverse these days what
would you say?
will you forgive me?
am I your sacrifice?

I stand before you like a fallen angel
