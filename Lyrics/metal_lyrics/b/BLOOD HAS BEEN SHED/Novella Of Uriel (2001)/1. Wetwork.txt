I am alive I am alive
let all doubts fall let all doubts fall
into the grave which I once called home
the breath of life expels the blackness
renew the passion embrace the sun
I am alive I am alive

I search for a grain of truth
In this endless sea of false hope
my quest begins on this day

drowning slowly drowning dare I breathe?

What can I say that has not been said?
what can I do, that has not been done?

in my hour of desperation
who else could I turn to
I guess I only have myself to blame
