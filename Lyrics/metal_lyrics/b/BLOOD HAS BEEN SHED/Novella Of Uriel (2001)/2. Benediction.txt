neglected Forgotten You were cast aside
casting stones at an open target
what did you think
that I would just smile and then walk away

no that was never in my nature
and it won't change now

I didn't leave to teach you a lesson
I left because you never even looked my way
strange that pain brings my name to your lips
but I am not complaining
maybe this is the rebirth
we always whispered about
the one thing that would bind us together
start over start over start over start over

those foreign days will cease to exist to me
I dare you to look past the scope of your vision
in spite of the empty promises
I will not be denied
