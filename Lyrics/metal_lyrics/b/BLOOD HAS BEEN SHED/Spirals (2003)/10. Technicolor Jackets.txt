Do you have no patience for ignorance especially your own? Death to the lies, death to all manipulation Do you ever feel that you've won this day, But question arise? Is there a day that's not endless? Seen thru these eyes And I am stifled by your silence Infinity drags its feet each moments a years And each day a lifetime of moments Choking on points and shards When will we ever learn how does it feel when everything you touch Feels so brittle and turns to dust But you've always had the answer, you always knew Embrace and learn.
