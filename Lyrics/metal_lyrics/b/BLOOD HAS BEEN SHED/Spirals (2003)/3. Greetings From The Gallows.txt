You should have seen this coming from miles and miles away God knows you had your best face forward Soothing the soul with words of solace Spoken like a true devil Change your colors chameleon But I still smell your stench in the morning air the hawk always flies alone over an empty filed For the deceiver dual blades to slit the throat Give up the ghost that's all she wrote 35,ooo ways to hate you I'll see your forked tongue as my trophy Compromise compromise I'll be your scapegoat you'll be my sacrificial lamb All lies are truth until your lies are revealed Well look who's bleeding now who's bleeding Now how does it feel when you are inside the scope How does it feel to be the game so look who's bleeding now Who's bleeding how could you foretell your own demise Fall Babylon fall Death to the obsession.
