The air is heavy with the acrid taste of deception For all our strength we can barely hold our heads up Were you thinking of me as everything fall from grace And I can't breathe again because the scent still lingers I guess this isn't the time for self loathing Loosen this noose I'll never speak your name I swear Loosen this noose I'll never speak your name And ill carve a testament of this day in my chest For all the world to see But I won't say a word, and I won't speak your name I won't say a word I won't speak your name.
