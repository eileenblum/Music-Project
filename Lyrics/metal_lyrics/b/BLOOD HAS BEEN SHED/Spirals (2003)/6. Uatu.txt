I'm wanting waiting Needing aching holding breathing Watching stealing Thirsting Gazing I've always been there at a distance Waiting for the day you would notice me And I lied, Lied to myself Knowing that I've always hoped for more if you could only see you're stealing my breath away Broad strokes and fine lies Painting a picture never wanted to see it's all too clear we've only been lying, lying How many times did it all fall down how many times when there was nothing left Only then you would see me, how many times Your heart-your heart of gold is broken I wish I could be the name on your lips For only one moment of bliss I wish you could see the paper-thin scars I bear for the heart of the golden Your heart is broken Your heart-your heart of gold is broken Wishing I can be the name of on your lips For only one moment of bliss i wish you could see the paper-thin scars.
