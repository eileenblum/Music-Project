Tragedy seems to come in a pair of expensive shows Never notice the disguise until it walks up and slaps you in the mouth Can't say that is very subtle at all But who knows, maybe just maybe just....I might shut you up Think you can listen for a second Hope you aren't too bothered or busy Better do something about that wound lt's festering your reek of decay and its coming from the inside out Have I got your attention now? I've got your attention now Well it sure took long enough I can spit in those wounds That might help Really I'll bet you thought the world owed you a whole lot more Sorry to push your not buttons it's what I do Pretty much perfected this after thousands of years You should savor these moments.
