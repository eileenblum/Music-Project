From the moment of birth you were ill-fated Nothing has changed Living the lie of led followers breeders And you are to blame You bear the mark of the beast Wearing benevolence Proud of the blood on your hands Return to the dirt claim it as your own Buried in deepest seas of regret bravado burns the time In your hands open eyes weep for your ignorance has now become the author of your downfall You will always suffer Ignorance will always be the author of your downfall You will always suffer Why do you suffer.
