Yeah lets start all over Lets live a lifetime In the span of moments Closer drawing close but your face only slips further away Forgive my selfishness I only want what is rightfully yours Bite my tongue I'll silent and hope your words will sound like mine Does my perfection make you weary Are my mistake just a waste of time Am I just a waste of time The path I follow has the tell-tale smell of ashes Before it all bursts into flame again I want this life to be worth the the sacrifice I've grown so weary why won't you speak to me? In the midst of all of all the heartache look for the roses When destruction tears the world in two Can you find the roses There must be more than a tear while I'm falling A memory doesn't always cut away No Strength to pray for the end-the-weeds turn to roses.
