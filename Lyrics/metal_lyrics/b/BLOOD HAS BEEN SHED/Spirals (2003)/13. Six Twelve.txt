Each time you break my heart I fall in love again I yearn for the way you prove me wrong Fingers buried in dead skin brings the living back to life once more Carve out the scales and open my eyes I cannot regret that I freakly placed my life in your hands Obligatory words have been stripped I lived only for your whispers Yet I never strayed far from the confines of my shallow it's always been that way All my dreams are shattered because all my wishes have now come true Your voice is all I have slay me teach gaze love me Take me breath swallow breathe For you (this love affair will never end) I live this life for you (this love affair will never end) I give this life it was never in vain I have not one regret it was a simple choice.
