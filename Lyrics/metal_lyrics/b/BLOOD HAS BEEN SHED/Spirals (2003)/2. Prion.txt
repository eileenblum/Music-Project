I can see it I can see it in your eyes That special something When the gods have smiled your way You've so beautiful you're a living pheromone Reflective glory-you are the glory Wishes and lust are the air you breathe it all in Born from the vegabonds By your hands calloused hands of those who adored you How would you really have it any other way? Twenty years is your eternity The masses so far away We all fall like tears we all call your name We all fall like tears.
