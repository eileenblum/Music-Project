The wind whispers your name your eyes your face visible thru these black days I was never the only one to think of you And remember every look every word everything Digging my nails into my palms feeling nothing but heat With a heavy heart and a trace of guilt I accept this deceit I can't forgive myself and I won't start with you These are the words I live by I will not attempt to to swallow betrayed These are the words I live by These are the words I wish my hands of all the past Theres are the words I live by I am buried alive your gift at deception He's left me hoping Reacting choking gasping for unbreathable air The essence of death Permeates my senses.
