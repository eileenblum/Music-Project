I'm dormant in the Starry darkness
Without end, without spring
I'm the one that breathes in thee,
Preposterous God's sting

I am All that moves in dark
Star Hell of your hardship
I'm the One who spawned the Beast
In the mind of your jati

I, the infinite light,
In the shards of Dark Stars
Iâ¦ fasten my sight 
From my spider heart

I made your dreams 
From Circle of Four,
In lucid golden hues.
Take it and know, oh soul
In Infinite life's incarnations.

Where fear is the last confine
Below which your freedom
Where pain's the last tribute
That you shall pay, gained the new Eden

Come soul, in light of living Stars
They point the way, where everything's alive,
Come soul, where vortices in chant,

Of stories about what was, is and will be shrived.
Come soul, I'm your tune and light
From very end and new beginning.

Nothing will stop, nothing will win
Spiders, weaving their webs,
Carrying lives from other planets
I hear, I seeâ¦ the plebs,

Listen to me! â I summonâ¦
Come into my world
I'm willing to answer so sullen â
I'm fully now unfurled.
