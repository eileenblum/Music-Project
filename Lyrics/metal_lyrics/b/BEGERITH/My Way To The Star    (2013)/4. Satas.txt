Follow the path, granting the aeon 
Where Satas â the way to infinity
And the Maelstroms and Typhoons of Golden Wagon
Rushing to Earth, crushing divinity,
Scattering ashes to choirs!

Accepted the Sign for the soul and the heart,
Standing therefore circle of Death and Life, 
Will cut by the whirl incarnations inside, 
Dividing the essence from phasm and qualm 

Bugle in Horns of Heaven, and tell
Of Angels of Death that reaching the Earth
Only Satas inside as flame â burning hell
Shall protect his Filii, the Stars calling forth

And only those who burned the word on body by the anguish
And only those whose eyes reflection of His Will
And only one who knows the new Word of the knowledge, banished â
There is and Will be Light of His Celestial Een

Satas, descending to Earth,
Thou art God that is dormant in dark
Now is the moment of wakening
See the fruits of thy creationsâ spark!

You open the Path for your chosen
And present them the Sword of Insight
And force them to see once again
By the eyes of a God â death and life...

Satas, the old God of the universe
Constructive and destructive
Thou art my incarnation!

Satas, the vortex in the Shadows
Waking and somniferous
SATAS!!!
