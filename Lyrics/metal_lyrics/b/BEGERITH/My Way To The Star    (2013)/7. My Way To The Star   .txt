Roaming on Star Way,
Passing through the light of glowing starsâ¦
Wandering soul, knows no rest,
In a whirlwind of deaths and rebirthsâ¦

Thou art the one who once woke up
From a long deep sleep;
Thou art the one who has found
The strength and loyaltyâ¦

What can be stronger and brighter
Than every step on that Way? 
Where there are no more memories,
No more sorrowâ¦

Thy reverie is burning as the Brightest Star,
Igniting hearts and giving light to the infinityâ¦
This is your Way to the Star!
