I saw a lot of signs on My Way
They like the dark shadows were following me,
Leaving a horror â immoral blood trailâ¦
There are Fallen Angels who're blinded by weed
And their own fool parasites,
They're looking for their lost paradiseâ¦

O mighty Lord of the Pass,
Free me from the stretching destinies' bonds
Deliver me from fallen and unworthy,
Those who were calling out your name but left Thee, fucking earthy

You lead me in the desert, for I am not be breached
And harden me on fire as steel on your Truth's Sword
A myriad of stars has canceled off Thy Wings,
There's moment in a cosmic oblivion, o Lordâ¦

Entrust to me thy legions that nurtured on the ashes,
With banners and the horns I'll lead them into fight
Promethean pyr-fire shall enter to the lifeless
And it will be the battle for New World and the Lightâ¦

Almighty Seventh angel!
Thou Wanderer in battles, in battles were not peers,
Beside each other's weapons I'm murdering and sizzling
What was birthed in a lie!

We go through the Way, the Star Way of aeonsâ¦
Only the ashes lie of traitors and the false
They are as myrrh and chrisom indulge very paeans
For you, my Angel, lift thyself above the worlds
As Brightest Star, inscribed
The bright-eyed light
Forever!
