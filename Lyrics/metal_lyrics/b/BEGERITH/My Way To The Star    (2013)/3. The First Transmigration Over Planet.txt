Demon, I summon thee
To open the Circle of Five Aspects,
And fill me with a thoughtâ¦

Demon, I summon thee
To baptize my soul with the water,
And fill me with the Willâ¦

Demon, I summon thee
To dignify my lightless body,
And fill me with fortitude

Demon, I summon thee
To come into my consciousness
And fill it with the power of the Word

Spit the fire of suffering souls,
In the grip of the Faceless Somethingâ¦

I'm going after, reaching the goals
Toward the darkness, craving the laughing
Of Infinitudeâ¦

All smolders in hearts,
A senseless emerges the arm
I had arrived for a New Star
That would eclipse the Old Sun

INNES FATAS DOMINUS FEROS
IMMES SATAS LNOME ZELLU

Oh God! Hearken to me!
Awakened from a cup with bloodâ¦
Oh God! Behold and favor me,
Dressed in new skinâ¦

I'm coming to you, at the signs incised in the body,
I'm coming to you, finding Infinity's ray!

O God, contemplator of heavens
You are dissolved in my blood
O God, the destroyer of tethers

O God, You gave me the freedom
You are dissolved in my blood
O God, the destroyer of the fall of man.
