Skelter!
The idea of demonic confession,
I'll open for You the door to the essence
Skelter!
Through dreams and the falchion
I'll carry your soul to the very crescents
Skelter!
I'm on the verge of fortune,
Mutated into the matrix spheresâ¦
Skelter!
And breathe a dead matter of infinite yearsâ¦

The Afflicted!
Remember your name, Came-in-the-Circle,
I'll tell you the secrets of invisible Darkness â
He is your shadow and the soul, unimmortal
She is the truth and your sparkness!

Everything in it is born and disappears,
By flashes of light in the palms of God,
Playing with forms of crystalline spheres
Everything's changing, transforming in might â thoughts of the planetsâ¦

On the horizon, where the world froze in horror
Will be a ghost, the Light of four asters
And in groans of millions, of million souls
For whom fear of God is ruthless disaster
Your mind shall hear the names:

Astaroth! Beherit! Belial! Ashkheth!

And the eye of golden pyramids,
Leading to throne the igneous tribe,
Explored the nature and God's Wrath â
They shall proclaim our Might!

The time is now! Come and manifest!
