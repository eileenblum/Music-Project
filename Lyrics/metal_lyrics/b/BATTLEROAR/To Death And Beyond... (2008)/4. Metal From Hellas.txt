Flying with the eagles, soaring way up high
Aiming at the red sun, warriors of the sky
Lightning strikes above us, storms are raging on

Look upon the mountains where the gods did reign
Sword of Ares shines on, ruling once again
Father in Olympus, guide our burning blades

Steeds of black with wings of leather
Diving on their prey
Souls of hell obey the master's call
Pegasus reborn in magic
Entering the fight
Sworn to seek his victory, or to die!

All hail, here we rise again!
Metal from Hellas!
Gods sing, in the land of pride!
Metal from Hellas!

Dreamers of the nightside, lost in crumbling halls
Stalking sacred ruins, where your demons crawl
Witness of the ancients, draw the secret signs

Riding mighty chariots in the arenas of the world
Launching into battle, to conquest and beyond
Mystic winds of Aeolus, fill our black-eyed sails

Crushing down the devil's minions
Through the underworld
Cries of battle fill the burning air
Here anew we swear the promise
We made long ago
Keepers of the flame that will not fade
