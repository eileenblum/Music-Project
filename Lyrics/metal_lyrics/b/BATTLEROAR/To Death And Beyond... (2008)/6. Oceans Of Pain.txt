There is a sea in the soul of all men
Who dare to choose
The winds of their destiny
Those who sail, know they could never return
Back to the shores of their land
Follow the dream, soar with the tide
Glory and gold, shine through the magic rain
Free as the wind, will you be legend
or drown in the oceans of pain

There was a boy, born and raised in a cruel time
He lived in a town by the coast
All of his life, he daydreamed of fame and adventures
Far from the dust of his land
Follow the dream, soar on the tide
Glory and gold, shine like a magic rain
Free as the wind, will you be legend
or drown in the oceans of pain

That boy is a man, his eyes as grey as the cold wind
That carved all the scars in his heart
So many years, he struggled at sea
For his own life, slave to the wheel of despair
Nothing is real, nothing but pain
Floating adrift, tied to the bloodstained helm
Watching the flames, as they devour
Born of the oceans of pain
