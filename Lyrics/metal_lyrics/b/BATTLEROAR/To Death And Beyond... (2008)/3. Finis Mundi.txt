It's the end of the year nine hundred ninety nineFor nobles and countrymen, peasants and lordsThe edge of oblivion draws near Medieval darkness, cradle of magicOn through the night, the fears are growingNo more tomorrow, a merciless endingNowhere to run, the time is comingThe time is coming! In the name of the LordThe Pope and the Bishops preachThe beast of damnation will rise from the seaThe serpent of hell devours Sinners are chanting, pay for salvationYou'd better prepare when judgement calls youIs it too late now? Omens are clearEnd of the world, the Finis MundiThe Finis Mundi! God, hear the call of the sons of the EarthWe will stand tall in this time of despairProphecies old from the dawn of all daysOnly the pure will survive this dark age This is the end of all times, it's the Finis MundiDamned are the souls left behind, it's the Finis MundiAngels descend from the sky, it's the Finis MundiWatching the world as it dies, it's the Finis Mundi
