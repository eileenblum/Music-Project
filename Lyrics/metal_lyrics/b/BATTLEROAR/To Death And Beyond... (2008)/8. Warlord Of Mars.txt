Out of the darkness, he's riding the sky
Call of the wild, inside his steel heart

Soldier of metal, this won't be your last
God of the battle, will lead you to the stars

The Warlord of Mars!

Soul of a tiger, can never be tamed
Lust and desire, won't chain his steel mind

Soldier of metal, there's nowhere to run
Death in the shadows, but you will save us all

The Warlord of Mars!

People of the Earth, we command you to kneel
The kings who betrayed, are soon to be slain

Out of the darkness, he's riding the sky
Call of the wild, will take your steel heart

You live for metal, the voice of the past
Gods of battle, will lead you to the stars
