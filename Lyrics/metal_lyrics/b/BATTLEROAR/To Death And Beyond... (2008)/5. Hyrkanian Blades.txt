In a time when children singof magic, lords and ringsAs the eagle spreads its wingsWe rise When ancient empires fightSteel gleams across the nightHyborian kings, conquest and might Breed of Atlantean kingsMasters of the swordRulers from the EastHyrkanian Blades With mace and chains we'll grindthe tyrants of mankindCivilization's just a dreamconceived in Erlik's eyes Where thrones are shining brightlike jewels under the skyOn roads with jade and amber pavedWe will ride Rising from lemurian ashesRiding savage steeds of warFlashing Steel's their only answerRulers from the EastHyrkanians The living Tarim knowsWhat Skelos once foresawA mighty flood will sweep anewThe savage plains we roam Black steeds of war will rideAcross the steppes that nightWith flashing axe and deadly swordTo storm the gates of time
