On fields of war, we had to growA bloody rage, a hear of stoneThat's what we have learned When bullets fly, above your headNo time to lose, there's no regretIt's fight or be dead Soldiers marching on, the last commandYoung souls raising hell, rain of fireWarcries fill the air, will this ever end? They kill for greed, not peace to findForget the past, don't look behindDon't stand in the lineA secret plan for mind control, the price of life?Expendable, that's what we all are Soldiers marching, for the final standOn their road to hell, load your gunsWhen sirens scream the end, living in despair When a lonely child prays to the skyDreaming of kingdoms, of ages gone byWhen a million voices join as oneA new star is born, the king claims his crown March, they march, in the rain and mudLords of torment and disorderFlashing lights, in the dead of the nightHeralds of attack and violence Burning in the flame, of unholy forcesLocked in a spell, you'll never be freeGazing at the sun, looking for a vengeanceBlack soul, blood red steel Pouring on the land, like a rain of evilSewers of the storm, leaders in commandMarching in the rage, of a magic winter or a fiery sand
