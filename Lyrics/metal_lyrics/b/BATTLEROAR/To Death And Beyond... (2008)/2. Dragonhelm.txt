Born with eons of sorrowCursed son of HurinCrossed the mountains of shadowExiled from Dor LominOnward the hidden kingdomAway from the eyes of MorgothBearing the helm of his fathersCrafted by gold and grey steel Out of the land of DoriathHe followed the ancestors callAn army of lawless by his sideBecame the fear of the orcsGurthang spread blood and disasterThe time for battle has comeThe serpent will die from the chosenNo one can escape the black sword Dragonhelm, ruler of blacksword and steelLord of fate Pride of the great house of HadorShield me from wound and from deathStrike in the fury of battleAs the dragon that lies on the crestFear in the hearts of beholdersThe powers of Hurin grow strongThe serpent will die from the chosenNo one can escape the black sword Dragonhelm, ruler of blacksword and steelLord of fate
