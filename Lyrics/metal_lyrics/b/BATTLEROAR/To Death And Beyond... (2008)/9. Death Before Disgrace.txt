They rise out of the ashes
In the burning sky
No hope left for the remnants
On this endless night

War is its name and it binds you
with chains of thunder
Only the brave will defy
Seeking death before disgrace

Stormclouds casting dark shadows
On the fields of death
Phantoms ride on the black winds
Soldiers of unrest

War is its name and it binds you
with chains of thunder
Only the brave will defy
Seeking death before disgrace

Remember the heroes, the battles they lost
Alone in the darkness, their spirit rises

Remember the heroes, who died for a cause
Again into darkness, they fight to death and beyond

Daylight, the battle still rages
The combat is high
Warstained soldiers of hell stand
To the final fight
