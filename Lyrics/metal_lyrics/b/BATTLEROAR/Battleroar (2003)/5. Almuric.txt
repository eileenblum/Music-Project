Born in a wrong age
In another dimension
In a planet of weakness
In my own desolation

Damned by my own fate
Hunted by my own race
Hiding from my destiny
An animal is crying inside me

Ironhand of Almuric

One day my destiny calls
To leave it all behind
To travel to a new world
On wings of death I ride

To a world of my powers
A world full of rage
Where life means so little
Where death leads my way

Ironhand of Almuric

Icon of barbaric fury and warlust
An ironhand raised to destroy
Warrior reborn from exile to command
Lead on your legions to conquest and to triumph
