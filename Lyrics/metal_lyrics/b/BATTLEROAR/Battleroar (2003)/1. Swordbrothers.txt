Now, that so many years have passed
As a blank figure I stand, In front of my destiny's tale
And I see a divine impaler, reaching for my soul's vein

"Come my messiah I await thee
for my time has come to finally meet
my Swordbrother"

A past full of pictures and greatness on my back
It's a shame to die without blood on my hands
So I bear my sword to the ground and I prayed

On cold winds of hatred I ride
from the darkest depths of hell I march
the great horns of battle call me again

An ancient oath I swore in the past
A bond of a sacred promise

Souls shine like steel, across the rainbow
In front of the golden hall, I stand still
And before tears drop down from my eyes,
I grab your hand to get you back, my Swordbrother

Bonded by honour and blood we are one,
Brothers in battle and death
Warriors in armours of shining chromed steel
Strong and immortal we soar

Ride on my warriors fight proud victorious
Onwards to battle to slay and kill
