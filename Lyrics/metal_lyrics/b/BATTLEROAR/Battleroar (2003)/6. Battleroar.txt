Just before darkness falls
A beast cries out a battleroar
A roar coming from the past
Warriors live again at last

Metal lives in our hearts
In our blood, in our minds
On fiery chariots from hell we ride
A conquest for eternal life

Now, open your eyes
And see the darkness turning to light
While burning fire rains from the sky
There will be no one left to survive, no

When gates shall fall
And Gods will hold the flames of those souls
Who praise and keep the faith of an oath
Of sacred metal, of Battleroar

Feel the cold steel cutting through your flesh
Into the battle
Brave to the end fight for what you believe
Into battle

Oh, never fall, standing tall
Battleroar
Strong raise your sword, scream and shout
Battleroar
