Hurricane of fire, flame of Megalopolis
Fighting for all mankind,
He's the chosen last Mane king

Black blood tribe is planning conquest
Of the planet Earth
He's the one who wields the power
Master of starforce

Megaloman

Mystical bladefighter, swinger of the firesword
Cybernetic warrior, ruler from a distant star

Captain Dagger's sending monsters
From the evil dome
Towns are crushed and torn in chaos,
Screaming out their call

Megaloman

Mighty mane's the final weapon, deflagrating force
Iron masked champion, rider of the firestorm

Shining bracelets, freedom fighters
Guardians of the world,
Crossed arms unleash the powers
Surging one and all

Megaloman
