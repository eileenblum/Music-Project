Ride with me on the endless sea
Across the waves among the brave
And if we die don't ask me why
Cause this is the way of the strong and the great

Feel your eyes spiting fire and ice
Cry for your life, once you live once you die
You may live a minute you may see the light
You may face the darkness but don't fear the night

"Sail onto the Dragonship
And this could be your last trip
But wisdom and glory lies ahead
As the Ancient Gods of War have said

Hoping to find them before your death
Let the wind take your last breath
And as you leave Midgard behind you
Remember all those who stood beside you"

Sail across oceans of darkness and light
Demons are waiting to face their last time
When seafarers kill with all power and might
The skies become crimson as Valkyries fly

Odin come forth show the way feed the beast
Through red mist raise your steel armored fist
Under the veils of unknown oceans deep
Immortal all those who sail on Dragonships

On bow I stand, the wind blows my hair
As I walk through the halls of Valhalla
Let the flames burn away, like dust in the air
To a place where immortals may live forever
