Burns a magic fire on the shores of river Nile
Guardian of the secrets of the pyramids
Pharaohs and Queens, they rest in ancient crypts
Protected by the spells of evil priests

Spins the wheel of time, towards the Enlightenment
The bright age of discoveries and wars
Conquerors of Egypt, Napoleonic troops
Plundering the land taken by storm
Explorers through the mist of reigns unknown

Gods, men and demons and beasts with powers divine
The final frontiers, are ruled and sealed by Horus hawkeyes
Sandstorms rise from the desert, a kingdom too proud to be tamed
The vengeance will strike, the jackals of night will howl once again

Torches cast their firelight on mystic glyphs of old
Hammer smashes royal chamber's walls
Violators brutalize and profanate with no remorse
Soon they will be stricken by the curse

Winged is the fly that bites when cowards fall asleep
Silent is the cobra, lethal venom on its teeth
Deadly pointed scorpion tails, nail victims to the ground
Legions of the dark are on the prowl
Children of the sand will hunt you down

Gods, men and demons and beasts with powers divine
The final frontiers, are ruled and sealed by Horus hawkeyes
Sandstorms rise from the desert, a kingdom too proud to be tamed
The vengeance will strike, the jackals of night will howl once again

This is not a legend , but a page of history
Still the fire burns, this land to keep
Scavengers of human lust for glory and for gold
Don't cross again the point of no return
Powers of the Nile will steal your soul

Gods, men and demons and beasts with powers divine
The final frontiers, are ruled and sealed by Horus hawkeyes
Sandstorms rise from the desert, a kingdom too proud to be tamed
The vengeance will strike, the jackals of night will howl once again

Rises from the horizon, the majestic fire of the sun
Its challenging light reflects on the Nile, bringing new life
Caravans across the desert, nomads and tribes they all know
Forces of Egypt will serve and protect the secrets of old
