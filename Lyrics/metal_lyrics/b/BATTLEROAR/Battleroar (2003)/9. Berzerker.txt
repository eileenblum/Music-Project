The shaman dances around the fire
The thought of blood becomes desire
All is lost, out of my sight
I start to tremble, from lust for fight

Oh, inside my dreams, the things I've seen, they pull me within

I'm calling Tyr, to come ashore
To turn my voice into a mighty roar
Finally I can see the red mist
And the axe starts to live in my fist

On an endless war, I heard a roar
Through frost and ice, from a distant shore

Now there is no meaning upon the earth
And my salvation will come through death
But my fury will go on
Until Valhalla becomes my home

Oh, warriors stood there, with skins of bear
Letting their screams into the air

I have seen men attack, on certain death
and mutilated warriors keep fight to their last breath
But only now I can understand
The ultimate wrath that makes them stand

Oh, now they let me see, all that they can see
In front of a frozen sea ...
... Beyond the realms of pain I stand
