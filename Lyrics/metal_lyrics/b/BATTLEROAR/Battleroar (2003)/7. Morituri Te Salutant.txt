My glory is passing through victory
My bravery will be rewarded
One day I will pass all this misery
And free I will stand to this world

I spent all my life into slavery
Hoping to see the next dawn
I am here to kill every enemy
And salute the man on the throne

My dream is to travel in foreign lands
I have dreamed that long before
I'll try to forget all this blood on sand
And mournings will sound here no more

But all these dreamed things are so far away
I'm only a gladiator
Perhaps these could be my last fighting days
And the crowd will shout for more

MORITURI TE SALUTANT

Under the stars
I see a vision a chariot of light
Heading towards me
And I realize it's time for me
To fly high in the sky
I hail you now as I die
