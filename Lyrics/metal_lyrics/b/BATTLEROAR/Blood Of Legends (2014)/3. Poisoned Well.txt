[Instrumental, "The Dragonphoenix Chronicles: Indomitable" Soundtrack]Freedom is why I'm gone
I live by the sword
I bow to none
A path of an outcast who lives on the run
No time to regret the things I've done

Crawling on the trail of sorrow
Dreaming of a new tomorrow

Warriors
Who fought your battles
All across this cruel world
The've died - Long before
Your fallen brothers gave their souls
And their lives - Forget them not

My heart's a poisoned well
Enchanted by dark spells
Should kill fire and thirst
Drink from it and you'll be cursed
You'll be cursed

Warriors - Forget them not
