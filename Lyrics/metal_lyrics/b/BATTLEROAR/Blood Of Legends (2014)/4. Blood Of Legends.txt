On nights like this, my heart is sad
I dream and sing
For the deeds of glory, aeons passed.
Beneath the full moon
Cursed - Doomed
Let it be known
Where the blood of legends flows

Swords and rings, thrones of great kings
Eternal Hymns
Tales, come alive here through my strings
Where the blood of legends flows

Man, will you be remembered?
When your life line is severed
Or will you be forgotten?
Just dead and rotten.

Do you have dreams of greatness?
Or are you struck with blindness?
Will you be king or peasant?
Will I sing of your glory, too

You live and then you die,
You'll find the reason why
Just take a look inside,
And find the road to light
