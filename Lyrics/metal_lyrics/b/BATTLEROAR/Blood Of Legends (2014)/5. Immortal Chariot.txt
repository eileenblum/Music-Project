Balius and Xanthus - From the burning wind
A mighty force eternal - Breathing flame on battlefields
On so high in battle overlord Achilles stands
Directs the war commands

Ride the winged harpy - Stear the beast into the fray
Drown the world in slaughter on this sacred bloody day
Trampled under hoof - Now grind him down the enemy
For all the gods to see - Yeah

Immortal chariot - Immortal chariot
Riding high - Across the sky
Riding high - Forever

From above he viewed the blaze of the rising flames
He saw our vessels burn - And he saw the death and pain
Dressed in armor of the Gods - Proud he bears his shield
his mighty spear to wield

Upon his head the helmet - his sword is claiming death
Ruler of the battlefield - On these fields of dread
Here the death of heroes of all legends may await
But victory's his fate - Yeah

Immortal chariot - Immortal chariot
Riding high - Across the sky
Riding high - Forevermore

Immortal chariot - In strength and grace
Immortal breed - Like wind in speed
