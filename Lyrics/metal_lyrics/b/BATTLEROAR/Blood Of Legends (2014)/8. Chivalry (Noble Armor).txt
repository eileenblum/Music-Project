Defend the weak - Fight for the right
Justice we serve - Live like a knight
Honor gives strength - Truth fills with pride
Immortal on our lonely ride

Noble armor of chivalry
Alone you walk - Alone you pass
Through night or bright day

Embraced by the duty
For a better world
United by the code and the creed
Noble armor of chivalry

My heart my armor - Tall and strong
To tell what's right - To tell what's wrong
My words are sharp - They cut like steel
My sword - My principles - My will

Deceivers and traitors
Deceivers crawl under my feet
Disciplined
Oath-sworn to the code
