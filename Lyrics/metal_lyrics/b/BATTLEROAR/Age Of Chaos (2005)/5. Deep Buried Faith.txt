On frozen lands I seek my home
My end I feel is near
My fate was told so crystal clear
Iï¿½ll meet no one to fear
Through all these fights I only felt
My mystic powers unfold
I here now stand so brave and strong
But faithless in my soul

So now the gods will claim my sword
My armour and my shield
For all these years I only longed
My bloodlust to reveal

When the night will flow
Like a stream of blackness, I'll be there
By the northern shores
White ships of Avalon set sail again

Where is my faith, beneath that shadow
that lies floating on the floor
Trying with all my mental powers
Shall be lifted nevermore

Beyond the earthly planes of pleasure and decay
Beneath the abysses where idols rest untamed
My mind's eye gazed in fearful times
the Echoes of a faith once mine

Down secret corridors where sacred bells resound
Pale visions of my olden glory I had found
Behind the doors of death and life
Where no one dares, there I'll ride

When the night will flow
Like a stream of blackness, I'll be there
By the northern shores
White ships of Avalon set sail again

My mind is stormed by thoughts of thunder
My sword tight within my hand
My soul grows stronger starts to uncover
To resurrect my faith
There is my faith, beneath that shadow
Coming down with the rush of storm
Trying with all my mental powers
Faith arose for evermore
