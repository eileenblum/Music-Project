The face of a vampire
That grins in the black
It waits,
In the castle cold
The wings of a demon
That glides in the air
He looks out for blood, so beware

Run, run for your life
Flee from the black pits of hell
Fight, fires alight
Warlocks are casting deadly spells
Strange is the land where spirits dwell

Race against the sands of time
He's got you in his coil
The leather wings and talon's rage
Unfolding to destroy
No mercy for the victim
Who treads upon the blade
And falls apart

Sorcerers and witches
fear the cracking of your whip
Revenants and skeletons
You'll show them all your tricks
Your weapons are a legend
The chain of holy steel
And sacred shield

Hear the voice from the past
You will find out at last
There's a quest that is waiting for you and your soul

A swirl of the chain, the darkness, the rain
The fury, the pain and your power that soars

Vampire Killer

The scream of a virgin
that bleeds in the dark
Resounds
In the dungeons cold

The laugh of a demon
That glides in the air
His life is your blood, so beware

Force, moonlight's the source
Fueling the strength of your foes
Strike, strongest in might
Free now the village from this curse
Hunting the undead overlord

Centuries have passed by
and still the evil reigns
Stealing blood from cursed nights
We all know who's to blame
The hunger of the vampire
The mesmerizing eyes
And killing bite

Sneaking as a night-thief
through the ancient corridors
Your flying whip, a charming snake
It's ready for some more
The vengeance of the hunter
A fighter who was trained
To lift the curse

Hear the voice from the past
You will find out at last
There's a quest that is waiting for you and your soul

A swirl of the chain, the darkness, the rain
The fury, the pain and your power that soars

Vampire Killer
