The day has come
To set history
Brave men will fall
For thy victory
Outside the walls
War machines wait
The Battering Ram
Approaches the gate

Blizzard of stones
Storming the wall
Huge flaming arrows
Wait for the call

The challenge is great
Defenders are strong
Besiegers are might
They'll stay for long

Siegecraft, Siegecraft
Siegecraft, Siegecraft

Heart of the castle
Pounds on blacksmith
The Forging is endless
To withstand the siege

This mighty place
Exists to feed war
Iron and fire
Are ready for more

Tortured slaves
Are feeding the pyre
Craftsmen of great skill
Handle with fire

The anvil is singing
For life and for death
The hammer is giving
To metal, the breath

Siegecraft, Siegecraft
Siegecraft, Siegecraft

Siegecraft, Siegecraft
Siegecraft, Siegecraft
