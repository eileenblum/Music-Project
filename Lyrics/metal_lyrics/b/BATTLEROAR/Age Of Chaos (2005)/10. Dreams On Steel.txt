Dreams on Steel, forged forever
Poems on blades, we will remember

Twilight fades, moon rays whisper
silver tears on a dragon's wing

Gates of night, free thy secrets
spectral shades, glow in silent flight

Skies of grey, misty mountains
long lost days, relive by your rhyme

Fallen stars, rise in glory
when we'll stand by the lords of light

One last hail and we'll be gone
one last song, lies upon the sword
