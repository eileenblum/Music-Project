Dyvim Tvar - Keeper of the Dragon Horde - Lord of Fire
Dyvim Tvar - Unchain the Rage from Above - Flaming Glory
Almighty leader of dragons of Melnibone
At your command, destruction unfolds
For the glory of Chaos, the Fate's horn calls
In the Wake of the legions of Dyvim Tvar

By the sacred caves outside Imrryr
In a place where no mortal should dare
Lives a race as old as time itself
Ancient allies to the powers of chaos

Bringers of fire and venomous death
Eyes cold as a frozen desert
Shades of dark green and bright gold on their scales
gleaming in spirals of flames

Dyvim Tvar - Keeper of the Dragon Horde - Lord of Fire
Dyvim Tvar - Unchain the Rage from Above - Flaming Glory

Almighty leader of dragons of Melnibone
At your command, destruction unfolds
For the glory of Chaos, the Fate's horn calls
In the Wake of the legions of Dyvim Tvar

Remnants of a perpetual war
In a vortex of cinders they soar
Beastly heirs of lost kingdoms, behold
Where they came from, no one can recall

Great wings are beating with thunderous force
Stendors of knighthood unfurl
Riders with shields and spears mounting the horde
Champions of eternal war

Ancient kings of the sea
Heed the call of Dyvim
You who conquered this world
in olden days
Only few of your elder race remain
Sacred kings, hear my voice
Spread your wings on the waves
To defend with your fire
The gates of Melnibone
When the omens are drawn
And the dice is cast for war
