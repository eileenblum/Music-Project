(Against criminal theocracy)

Your laws were not made for people
But to protect your position,
What you believe must be the truth
'cause you despise all that's not yours.

You don't try to explain your faith,
But to impose it as a rule.
What if people find their peace
In another way of belief ?

A saint in your religion
May be a demon in my faith
How can you be sure you're right?
