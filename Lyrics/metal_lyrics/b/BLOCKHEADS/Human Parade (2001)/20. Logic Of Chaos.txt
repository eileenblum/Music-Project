Whales, agonizing on the beach,
Point out to human failures.
Wastes on the sea,
Asphixiating the water dwellers !
You failed, you failed, to prepare future !
You failed, you failed, to protect Nature !

You destroy life everyday,
Crush the weak to feed the fat !

What will you gain, when there's no life on Earth ?
Corporation, short-minded greedy pigs !

Profit in mind, you desecrate our land !
Exploit the earth, jeopardize our lives !

Humanity suicide [x4]
