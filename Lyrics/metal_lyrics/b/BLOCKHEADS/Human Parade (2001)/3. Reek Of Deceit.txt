Listen well / I will tell / what you are / to me
Liar / deceiver / faker / loser

I will shout to the world all the lies that you spoke,
I will destroy your false image

And you thought that you would live with what you did hidden to all...

Dual-faced pig,
Fond of make-believe,
Forked tongue adept,
You reek of deceit !
