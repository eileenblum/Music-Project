Always under stress to be the best at your work,
You never take time to rest it shows on your face.
If that's success you're after you should think again,
Because the only thing you'll gain is your early death.

Look at you, look at us, look out for/ Dead men working

Workoholic [x8]

You feel alive when you come home only to sleep ?
See your son born, teen and father in just a blink.
Stranger to your family if not to the world,
What do you think of your life ? Wake up it's insane !

Throw down your life and start building another one
Where your career will be secondary to life.
You'll find reward in the love that you will receive
From your family and friends you will never regret !

Dead men working !
