Captured, sedated, deported, imprisoned !

I'm a king at home, not an animal.
I long for my tribe,
I will break loose and declare war.
You call it a zoo, it's a prison !
I will not submit.

I will go back to my tribe,
Declare war on your kind
Show my teeth and hit my breast
Demonstrate my power

I am alone in my cell,
No feeling left but despair.
No way to call for my tribe,
No hate, no joy sedated...
