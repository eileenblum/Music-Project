You study, manipulate, you control, you create, you impose...
You study, manipulate, you control, you create, you impose, on the world.

G.M.O. [x8]

Biotechnology and manipulation of the living are a
good way to improve your financial power,
But we don't know the effects of genetically modified
products on the lives oh human beings !

You want us to be depending / on G.M.O.
But we don't want to be living / on G.M.O.
And soon we will see you burning / your G.M.O.
Because the world is refusing / your G.M.O.

Don't try to create monsters of Nature
