I am old, primitive, ancient.
There was a time when I freely roamed this continent
But now I'm slowly dying...

Long before you came to my land
I lived well, but now my spirit arches,
I dwell in smoky cities.

Through my people I look back
Remembering a long lost time
My land, my race, my dreams...
