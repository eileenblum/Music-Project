Business intelligence fuck the rest of the world,
God Dollar needs some preachers,
Business intelligence is their doctrine,
Millions working exploited to the core,
Free market sold for more money,
Plans as toys, poor's slavery,
Obscure hope for a better life.
Fed by TV, show to me dreams they dream.
Like puppets we're controlled,
Golden boys win the party as third world
slowly falls in chaos and violence.
