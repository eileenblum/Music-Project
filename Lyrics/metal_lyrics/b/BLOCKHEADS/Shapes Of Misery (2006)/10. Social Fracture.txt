Social fracture,
hidden behind graphics,
Witnesses of their lies.
Happiness is a given privilege
for those who live
On poor's slavery and exploitation.
Social fracture, juggling with the millions,
A few keep a selfish system locked
People in need as global result
Earnings're not in question, what else apart from exploitation
Beggars, misery, loss, despair, Social fracture
