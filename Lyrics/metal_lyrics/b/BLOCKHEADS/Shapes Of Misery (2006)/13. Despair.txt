Narrow-minded people, you just look at your
own miserable life. You have an opinion on
everything, but no broad view of what's around
you. Thus you feel powerful and mighty because
you think you have none to fear, but those that truly
rule are beyond your understanding and chose to
kill or spare you every day.
Think for a while, and you'll fear the despotic
ruling of corporations and nations, because power is
all to those that despise individuals. The more you
know, the more you hate. Dumb or despaired.
