Dressing = killing.
Two words combined,
They can make sense.
For the diamonds
'Round your neck
Are a noose for Africa.
They'll never see
Jewels they are killed for.
Diamonds business is nothing
But exploitation and murder.
Your beauty feeds itself
on African misery,
And your pleasure is
blood-coloured.
