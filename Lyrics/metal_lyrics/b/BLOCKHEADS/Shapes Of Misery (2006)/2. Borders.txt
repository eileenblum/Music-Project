Do you really believe, you bastards,
That misery is stopped by boundaries
That hunger will never cross the seas,
And that you'll never have to share your wealth ?
Don't you understand, you idiot,
That segregation gives way to hatred,
That poor and rich will always be on opposition,
Draw a line, and decide no trespassing,
Feel secure behind your laws and money,
Responsible for the third world decay,
When you will look up the world will be burning.
