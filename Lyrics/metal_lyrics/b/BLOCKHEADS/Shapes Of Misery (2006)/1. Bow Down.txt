Use Disney masks to hide the grins
Of unseen rulers than never wince,
No need to care for disposable staff,
Human rights once more deep in the ass.
Exploitation, power abuse, alienation
Mind control, deception, illusion,
Money, despair, profit,
Greed, lies, scorn.
Never forget when you go to these places,
That humans behind mask are force-fed with rules,
Just smile all the time otherwise shut up,
They got no right there, bow down to capitalism...
