"Get them out and close the borders"
This is what you say, "To hell with strangers",
I just wish one of them strangers
Will stand up when you look down at him
With scorn on organized private tour
And smash your well-fed face,
Kick you down and slash your throat.
You'll understand what I really think of you,
When I smile and say "One less bastard on earth"
