I am a loser, or so I am told,
Looked down on by all, alone in the crowd.
Slapped in the face everyday, despised,
just ignored, no one cares.
Thrown in the mud, kicked around,
Under pressure, preyed upon,
Clockwork ticking, living bomb,
Give me a gun I'll teach you all.
You believe I will never stand up,
That I'm not strong enough to oppose you,
Schoolyard shooting will be my answer,
Kill you, kill them all that did not speak out.
I am alone, alone in the crowd,
Gun in my hand, and killing in mind,
Shoot all around, madness on display,
Who will you blame ? Social bomb exploded.
