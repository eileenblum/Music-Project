Massive destructions,
Bombs to extend a world leadership...
No matter how many victims will die...
All will perish...
It's not really a war crime...
Peace will arrive...
Kill, destroy, then conquer...

All to rebuild, Peace will arrive

So many killed under the bombs...
Feel no regrets...
Sprawled on your dollars...
Each war brings pain...
Peace will soon arrive...
A Peace that bodies won't refuse will follow the bombs...

Massive destructions,
Bombs to extend a world leadership...
Bombs...
