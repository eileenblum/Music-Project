Nuclear is the way they say
Death goes on its way I say
Unseen unheard we ignore their presence
Nuclear is dissuasion they say
It's a problem of self-esteem I say
Better get rid of it now before
It all explodes in your pretty face
Hiroshima Nagasaki never again they say
Tchernobyl errors will become common I say
These particules burn through your skin to your bones
I don't want my children to be mutated
