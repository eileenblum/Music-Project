At the beginning of times
There were no distinctions between men and animals
A man could become a human being if he wanted
And an animal could become a human being
There were no differences
Creatures were sometimes animals and sometimes men
Everybody spoke the same language
In this time, words were magic
And the spirit owned mysterious powers
