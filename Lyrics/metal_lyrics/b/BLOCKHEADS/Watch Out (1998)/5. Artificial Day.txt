Child I knew how to give
I forgot this virtue
Since I became civilized
As today is artificial
Every beautiful stone was a treasure to my eyes
Every tree that grew was a respected property
Now I corrupt with the White-man
In front of a painted landscape
Whose value is estimated in dollars
