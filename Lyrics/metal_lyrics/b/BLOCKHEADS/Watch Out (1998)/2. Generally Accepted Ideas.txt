Lost in the sea of ideologies
I swim keeping my head outside
Not to fall in the abyss of the system
You are on my land fucking laws
Lack of understanding is the distance which divides us
You impose your ideas
You create fascism
Stage under my reaction
Undergo my anger
The traces that you leave never will be fossilized again
