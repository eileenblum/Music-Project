[verse #1]
I was hoping for a ghost, but there was no ghost, because there are no ghosts
I was waiting for a sign, but there were no signs, because there are no signs
Can't recall how the night started, but I'll tell you for sure how it ended
Jumping out of the truck, screaming, 'you want some, come and get it'

[chorus]
Stand there, trembling, waiting outside the door
This ain't the miracle that I was praying for
No, this is where the story stops

[verse #2]
I was hoping you'd wake up, but you didn't wake up, because there was no hope
I was calm and I was tough, but it wasn't enough, I could've pissed up a rope
One regret, I didn't get to beat your sister to death when she heard me
Dried up whore ain't nothing more than the proof there's no God to desert me
