[verse #1]
A forest of tongues rooted deep in their sockets dry...silence
An army of eyes gazing round for some flaw to spy...violence
Twenty-five grand to reattach a retina...(in a) furnace
Twenty-five and out, and all the good it's getting you...burn this

[chorus]
I'm a pro, I'm a surgeon
Ice-cold veins, keep on working
White-hot pain, feel nothing at all

[verse #2]
The time I burned the armrest in the Mustang with a cigarette...junked it
The test that they gave to see if you were feeling it...flunked it
The latest in a series of biggest disappointments yet...waitress
Finally get it right, and there's no one left to witness it...hate this
