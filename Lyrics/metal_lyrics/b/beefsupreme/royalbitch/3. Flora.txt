[verse #1]
You keep bleeding through the fresher paint
Foggy like the halo on a saint
You can't be in my dreams anymore
You can't walk right in through the front door
[verse #2]
Of course you'd find me, where else would I be?
Thought you'd find your way back eventually
Standing, sipping coffee by the sink
Give yourself confusion, time to think
[verse #3]
You keep bleeding through the fresher paint
Lost, well, I can tell you where you ain't
You can't be in my dreams anymore
You can't walk right in through the front door
