Wary glares from across the room
Icy stares slice through the gloom
Let me whisper in your ear
Lean in close so you can hear

For the smart, and the lucky...

Now they say the sky will fall
End the good days for us all
Lean in close next to your ear
Whisper soft so they can't hear

For the smart, and the lucky
There's always room

Let them point, and let 'em gawk
All they know to do is talk
Let my fingers brush your hand
Somewhere out there's promised land

For the smart, and the lucky
There's always room
