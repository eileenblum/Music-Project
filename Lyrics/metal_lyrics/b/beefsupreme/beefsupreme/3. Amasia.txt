Houses where we used to live
Cities where we must've been
Hundreds of memories, thousands of memories, that I still can't picture myself in

Cities built on coral reef
Calendars carved in bas relief
Hundreds of days, thousands of years
Frozen in single moments

[pre-chorus]
Good news, well, the past can be erased
Given the earth's relentlessly shifting face
What in the world have we been working for
When all we have to do is wait some more?

[chorus]
You'd never have known there was ocean between us once

Strip malls now instead of woods
Bare lots where the school stood
It all looks different, all smells different,
Can't even recognize it

Render all my memories false
Hollower than sheet rock walls
Grind them to dust and blow them away and
No one would ever notice

[pre-chorus]
Good news, well, the past can be erased
Given the earth's relentlessly shifting face
What in the world have we been working for
When all we have to do is wait some more?

[chorus]
You'd never have known there was ocean between us once
