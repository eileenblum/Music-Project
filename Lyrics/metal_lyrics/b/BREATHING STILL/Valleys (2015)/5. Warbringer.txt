War torn
A nation under siege
The horde advance
Their eyes ablaze
With hatred

Send word to any man able to bare arms

To bare arms
This is war!
They have reached the gates
Hold the door
We cannot let them pass

Calling all the able
We must push back our oppressors
United we stand a fighting chance
To reclaim the land that has been lost to us

They thought that they could erase
Our people from the books of history
But they were wrong
They were so wrong
There will be nothing left to fix their head on

Enlisted
Hold tight your sword
Aim for their neck
May they fear us
As we make our advance
May they fearâ¦

You are enlisted
Don't you forget
Heed the call of the king
Hear his voice over the thunder of...

...war
The battle has only begun

War torn
Our nation under siege
But we advance
Our eyes ablaze
With fury
With fury

This time we will have their captain's head
Call forth riders to flank the rest
Move up!
Move up!
Move up and we will take their last...

....stand!
Move up!
Move up!
We will silence their taunting
And leave them in longing
For a death of their choosing
Death will not be their release
Death will not be their release
