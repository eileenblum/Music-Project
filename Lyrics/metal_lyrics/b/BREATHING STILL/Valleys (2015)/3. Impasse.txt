I venture forth into the abyss
A blackened scar in the depths of the earth

Voices surface from the alter
Calling out for the life in my blood
To quench the thirst of their hatred for God
Of their hatred for God

Don't let me fall away, my, sights of hope decay
I wish I could erase the steps that led me to this place
Where all light begins to fade
I can see the smoke arise

I can't see, the truth between your, blasphemies
They hide between the shadows in reality

I await for your words to change my destiny

My blood will not be the taste of your victory I am not alone
This valley is my home
These valleys are my home

Let them come, let them pay for their injustice
We push back, take back the land promised to us

Let the ash fall
Thereâs no escape, thereâs no escape from his judgement.
