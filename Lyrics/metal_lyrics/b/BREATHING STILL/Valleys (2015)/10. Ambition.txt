Seeking to find the path lost within myself
I defy my limitations

All my life
Iâve been prey to the darkness
All my life
Drifting in and out of light

I'm caught in forever
But bound by time
A transparent illusion
Creating from within

My time on this earth will be nothing but a breath

My voice
Resonating through the universe
Frequencies elevating my soul into the light

I can define my position where I stand
Unlocking my thoughts within
We all can control our potential
Taking back our minds
Liberating ourselves into our future
Authors of our own ambition

I wonât be seduced by the images of this age

I'm caught in forever but bound by time
A transparent illusion seeking the truth of our existence
We will find that weâre designed among the stars
We all can control our potential
Taking back our minds
Liberating ourselves into our future
Authors of our own ambition

We are the Authors of our ambition

I am a reflection of my thoughts
Awaken, imagine
Where do you see yourself in the end?
As time slips by
