I break every time I see the death
In the eyes of the defeated people
We all long for this to end
Our strife and our hopelessness
Oh
Taken further below the surface
Into the depths among the dead
Among the ruins of Atlantis

I feel crushed by the weight of the depth of a sea of lies

Corruption
Just let me show you a place
You canât discern the lies
That hide behind the masks
Pre-existing time

Where everything is wrong
With the world that I see
Is this how life is meant to be?

There is no return from these confines of decay
This path I chose
I canât escape from this hell that Iâve made myself
Renew my mind

Renew

I think Iâm falling to the dark
The beacons lit so you can see me
Before the sun descends I pray
These embers will light my way
These embers will light my way

There is no return from these confines of decay
This path I chose
I canât escape from this hell
That Iâve made myself
Renew my mind

We canât hide behind our suffering
We can rise to see justice
Light the beacon
United in adversity, the time has come to rise!
