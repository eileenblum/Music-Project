Disorientation churns my mind warping the patterns of my stable soul
Disconnect the ties that bind me to the weight of my shadow that haunts me
That haunts me to the grave
They wonât rest, it wonât rest till I case to breathe again.

Gone are the days of stability and peace
Iâve been living my life on my knees
But the words Iâve uttered seemed to fall at your feet

Gone are the days when my when my spirit soared and you were my guide
Turn back the time for me to re-discover her by my side.

My spirits weak, treading on the souls of fallen soldiers
I canât seem to stand on my own two feet
Oh God give me release

Is this the end of me?
If youâre love is true
God pull me through

My spirits wasting away
As these prayers are left unanswered
The dungeons become my home
Oh I long to accept defeat

As I lift my head into the night skies
Hand crafted suns alight with the love in your eyes
Under a blanket of lunaâs borrowed light
Iâll rest my head into my hands for the last time
