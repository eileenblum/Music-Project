I canât seem to find my place
In this land twisted by greed and vanity

Thereâs no rest
In this broken dream
Broken Dreams 3
Is there no release?

I cannot
Let my life fall into this sleep
In this dream
Am I just
Nothing more than a consciousness drifting through time

Close my eyes, Iâm falling through the void
Into translucent worlds
Beyond all space and time
We canât see, we canât see beyond the veil

How could I have been so blind?
I know now thereâs so much more
Look through transcendent eyes
To see dynasties wage a war
Itâs time to wake up
Itâs time to wake up
Itâs time to wake up and see

That this world is torn
From an infinite contention
But we sleep in bliss
But we sleep in this dualistic domain
Blinded by selfish gain

I can hear, voices of deities
That wage their war in the skies
Hiding through the mask of the ages
Enslaving the hearts of mankind

Close my eyes, Iâm falling through the void
Into translucent worlds
Beyond all space and time
Weâre all slaves, weâre all slaves to what we canât see

We must grasp that thereâs more to this place
Than vanity
This wonât become my grave

When this life bares down on us all
Rise above and never let go
