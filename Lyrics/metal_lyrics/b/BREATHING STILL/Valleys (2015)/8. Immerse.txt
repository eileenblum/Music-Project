Can you feel the light
Resonate

Echoing within, evoking dispositions
Awakening
Limitless possibilities

Open your eyes and Visualize
Immerse yourself within the vision

Awakening

I stare into a sea of stars, that holds a future out of my reach,
We canât allow the conflicting voices inside of us determine that we are all the same.

I wont just stand by, and watch my life fade, before my eyes.
Never again will I let your words determine my future.

There is a voice inside us all, calling us to look within,
past all the doubt and shame, unlocking the truth of our existence.

Upon the gusts as I ascend
into the skylines above this world,
Where my soul becomes weightless,
I take a breath, and take a hold of my Purpose

I will live my life among the skylines

Can you feel the light
Resonate
Echoing within, evoking dispositions
Awakening
Limitless possibilities

Open your eyes and Visualize
Immerse yourself within the vision

Awakening

Resonating

Separate myself from the past and never look back
