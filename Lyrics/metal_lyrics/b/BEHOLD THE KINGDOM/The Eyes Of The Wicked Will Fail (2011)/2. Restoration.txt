My spirit is broken, my days cut short.
I am marked for the grave.
My Flesh is clothed with worms and dirt
My skin is broken and festering.
I said I will die with my nest
I will live as long as a Phoenix
and My root will spread to the water
I thirst but their water is bitter
I am blessed though my trials are many,
I will see the full glory of my God
My redeemer lives, he will rise on the dust
My flesh is destroyed, but I will see my God
I thirst but their water is bitter
But with yours I will never thirst again
I will see him for myself
My eyes, not someone else
I will behold the living tree
and receive the healing leaves
I spoke without understanding
Of wonders far beyond me
But now my eyes see you
I detest myself
I detest myself
I repent with dust and ashes
He lives within me, I am eternal
Grave where's your victory?
death where is your sting?
I have been restored!
