United
In death
The body that is sown is Perishable
It is raised imperishable
It is sown in dishonor
It is raised in glory
Just as Elijah I am eternal
I will wait for my chariot
My chariot of fire
Oh wretched man that I am
Who wil save me from this body of death?
My allegiance is to righteousness
It comes from the King
My master Elohim
My allegiance is to righteousness
It comes from the King
My master Elohim
I am eternal!!
I have died to sin
It no longer lives within me
The body that is sown is Perishable
It is raised imperishable
It is sown in dishonor
It is raised in glory
