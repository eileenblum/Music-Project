My skin is stained with crimson 
My heart is hardening 
I can not let this go on 
This life of iniquity
my sin is always before me
you came to restore me 
Mashiach come cleanse me 

come cleanse me
I will not bow anymore 
I will not sub-mit to you
I will resist my flesh 
and watch my god destroy you 
i will resist my flesh 

and watch my god destroy you
open my mouth to speak oh yah 
and i will sing your praise
Mashiach speak through me  
speak through me 
speak through me
create in me a clean heart, oh yah 
and renew a steadfast spirit within me 
and i will teach transgressors your ways 
and sinners shall fallow you
My skin is stained with crimson 
My heart is hardening 
I can not let this go on 

This life of iniquity
my sin is always before me
you came to restore me 
Mashiach come cleanse me 
come cleanse me
