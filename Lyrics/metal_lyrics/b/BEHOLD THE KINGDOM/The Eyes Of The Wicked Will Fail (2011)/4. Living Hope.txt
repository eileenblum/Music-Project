This world is a lie, my hands are bound in sin. You'll lie to me no more,
I await for the day, I await for the day,
You saw this fallen world and gave your son to die for us,
Imperfect world we live, full of filth still forgive us. We pray for your grace.
I proclaim freedom. We are the face we are the fire we are the sons of the almighty.
I'll pray for you, Open it up,
In this imperfect world, You still found perfection,
We are the face we are the fire we are the sons of the almighty king.
