Hear the word of the Lord
Babylon will surely fall 
they have spilled the blood of saints 
the reward is blood to drink 

The cup of his wrath
you have taken the mark 
and cursed my fathers name 
refuse to turn away 

from your selfishness
Gnaw your tongue in agony 
as the sun consumes you in flame 
you have taken the mark 

now prepare to deal with the pain
and a voice cries out from the throne 

It is done
gather together on the plains of Armageddon 

Darkness on the kingdom of the beast
Beast
Darkness over the kingdom of the beast
Behold, he comes like a thief 
To expose the naked and shamed 
Blessed are those with the seal on there face
this could be your last chance 
tomorrow may not come
