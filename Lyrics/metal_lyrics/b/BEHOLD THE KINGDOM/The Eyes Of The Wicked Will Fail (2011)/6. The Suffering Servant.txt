He gave his life, I'll give my heart, Through death is life, He fell for you,
You hung on the cross, they periced your wrists mocked your name yet you still loved, and i bow to you,
Searching to find the truth, the truth,
Forgive them for they don't know, 
Brused and beatin for your freedom, periced and broken, your salvation,
For your freedom,
Death for your heart for your life for your freedom,
I wont turn back, forgive them for they do not know, now he walks this way, so look towards him, and touch his robe and you'll be healed, praise his name,
Brused and beatin for your freedom, periced and broken, your salvation, for your freedom
