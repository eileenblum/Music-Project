I'd rather be a slave in the house of my God
than dwell in the palace of the wicked
The lord will hand you over
You shall know there is a god in Israel
I'll feed you to the birds of the air
And wash my feet in your blood
Break out your teeth
Rip out your en-trails
spread them over all the earth
So, demons show me what you've got
I come with the Lamb of God
Demons show me what you've got
I come with the Lamb of God
I will tread upon the Serpent
And smash the lions scull
In the name of Holy one
come from the four winds
oh, breath
and breath into these slain
That the may have life
Dry bones Stand
You have life!
Behold The Kingdom of the dead that rise again
rise again
rise again
Brothers, come and stand your ground
Become what you have been made for
There'll be war
for you
war
for you
war
