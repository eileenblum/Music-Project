And never, forever
I'm going to surrender
I will not give myself tonight,
Never surrender a fight is just lost when you die.

[Chorus:]
Blood flows into the rivers Styx
And time to die has come now

The suffering was in vain
But now we'll end your pain
The things for which you pray
Did perish yesterday

Fighting for your live is desolate
Because now we will end your fate.
Even if you survive
You'll have a miserable Live

[Chorus:]
Blood flows into the rivers Styx
And time to die has come now

The suffering was in vain
But now we'll end your pain
The things for which you pray
Did perish yesterday

And I did not forget
What I just have said
But the pain is to big for only one to bare
I'll die
I'll die in vain
