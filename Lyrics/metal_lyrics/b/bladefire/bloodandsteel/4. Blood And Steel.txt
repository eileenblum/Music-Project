War has come over our lands
Blood and steel is what you will get
Your revenge will take some of us
Doesn't matter these lands are ours

[Chorus:]
Walking the valley down, to get where we belong,
Seeking the holy path far beyond the blood red dawn

In Valhalla theirs souls revised
The gates are open for those who died

Walking the valley down, to get where we belong,
Seeking the holy path far beyond the blood red dawn

In Valhalla theirs souls revised
The gates are open for those who died

Cry out so loud
For the vengeance of gods
The pain dealt will teach you to
Shut your mouth and to fall on your knees
Wisdom of decades won't disappear
Tell me are you blind for the truth
Just because false dogmas stole your youth.

[Chorus:]
Walking the valley down, to get where we belong,
Seeking the holy path far beyond the blood red dawn

In Valhalla theirs souls revised
The gates are open for those who died

Walking the valley down, to get where we belong,
Seeking the holy path far beyond the blood red dawn

In Valhalla theirs souls revised
The gates are open for those who died.

What are you in front of gods?
Scourge upon a bloods red wall
Bleeding filthy scum that's all

The truth differs from your deepest
Desires your holy gods are bleeding till they are finally dead.

Cry out so loud cause your gods they have been replaced
The new order it has rised burned the old one down.
