Truth is not easy to find
In a world that is blind
To regain your sight
You must not get blinded by might
They will tell you lies
About a wrong paradise
Don't listen to what they say
They just want you to obey
Because blinded by words
There is no need to pull the swords

[Chorus:]
Their blood will be shed
It will flow down the river
Feeding the oceans with their sins
Now and forever
Terror is over
They have gotten what they deserved
Become a blood lake that was their fate
This is what they wanted this is what they got,
Their blood will be shed
It will down the river feeding the oceans
With new souls

Find your path aside
Of the once with with the might
They just want to keep you calm
Even if you mourn
But now we have a chance
To build a world
Without corruption
And a hunger on the streets
Our world will be one without
Any needs

[Chorus:]
Their blood will be shed
It will flow down the river
Feeding the oceans with their sins
Then and forever
Terror is over
They have gotten what they deserved
Become a blood lake that was their fate
This is what they wanted this is what they got,
Their blood will be shed
It will flow down the
River feeding the oceans
With new souls

The wounds did not heal
Nobody thought it could be real
But soon after the revolution was done
A new reign of terror had begun

[Chorus2:]
Our blood will be shed
It will flow down the river
Feeding the oceans new souls
Then and forever
Terror is over
We have gotten what they deserved
Become a blood lake that is our fate
This is what we wanted this is what they get,
Our blood will is shed
It flows down the river
Feeding the oceans
With new sins.
