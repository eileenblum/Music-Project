I will wait for you
Till the end of dawn
Nothing left to do
Insanity reigns and
Sorrow
Will build my tomorrow
Will obey will follow

The moon is red tonight bleeding

And don't know
If I'll so the morrow
My live is pained in sorrow

The sky is dark tonight freed from all stars
Pitch black and dark

[Chorus:]
The voices inside of my head
They scream want you dead I want silence
(You must die)
Pain and the suffering to I shall bring to you
No more violence
(You must die)

Falling
My destiny if calling
The world stopped revolving
The days so grey and cold freezing
Dissolving
Laying on the ground crawling
The sky is dark tonight freed from stars
Pitch black and dark

[Chorus:]
The voices inside of my head
They scream want you dead I want silence
(You must die)
Pain and the suffering to I shall bring to you
No more violence
(You must die)

There is a whole in the world
Like a great black pit
And it's filled with people who are filled with shit
And the vermin of the world inhabits it
