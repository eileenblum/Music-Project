though I walk alone I am never on my own
how can I not confuse family with friends
even though that is exactly what somebody told me
this was more than a chapter but the heart of the whole damn book
I had my best friend by my side when I learned my father died
Ive seen strangers become friends and then turn into brothers
in just a few short weeks away from home
it is crazy when they tell me that this is just screams to a beat
when I know it's what shot you into my veins
glue that binds, a weapon that defines us
and I would be so lost without them
ive seen strangers become friends and then turn into brothers
in just a few short weeks on the road
bonds so much stronger than the time they took to form
and will last me the rest of my days
it is crazy when they tell me that this is just screams to a beat
when i know its what shot you into my veins
glue that binds, a weapon that defines us
and I would be so lost without you
though I walk alone I am never on my own
cuz the places we've been become the times we have shared
and they crash like waves and mark these days
and I don't go anywhere without them
I took the whole damn ride
with my best friends by my side
the days turned into nights
and we held on with all our might
cuz nothing stays no way, no how
there's no forever
the only thing that lasts forever
is right fucking now
