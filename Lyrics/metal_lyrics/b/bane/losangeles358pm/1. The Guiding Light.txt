summer came and you left it all behind
Red Sox games and Red Line trains
told yourself that nothing stays all dizzy and bright
traded it all to watch the world glide by
through that back bench-seat window
how could you not go?
everywhere you went your friends were waiting there
held onto nothing so that nothing could break in the end
envied everyone who was not you
and never forgave the rules that were older than time
that made time
and gravity did what gravity does
so you just kept on running
remembering Led Zeppelin songs with you feet on her dash
but her words they chase you still
"those highway lines will never love you back"
