Will not back down now
I've got no place else to run and hide to
Have come too far to buckle now
Can't lay this one down to the likes of you

And I don't say that with some bullshit sense of pride
I need you to know that I'm not done screaming
About whether or not your foot has the right
To be in some kids face

WIll not back down now
I've got no place else to run and hide to
Have come too far to buckle now
Can't lay this one down to the likes of you

And if that's the case
Then I say arm us all
And we'll get this asshole contest
Right under way

But it would be just like you to drag your keyboard to a gunfight
And so long after the smoke had cleared
I stood there all night as if you had so much to say
Instead of running home lion tail between your legs
Crying about the little needle stuck in your paw

I don't give a fuck if my words have grown old
I've never been so willing to see a relationship fray
I don't give a fuck how thin this ice has become
I'm stomping on it anyway
