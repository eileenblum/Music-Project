My brain, it was all blocked up
Feeling out of sorts
The words they would not come
I met a guy on the train
Who had a few kind words
The nicest dude
Showed me his "ante up" tattoo

It's kind of wild the people who we will find
Some that you don't even know
With just the tiniest boost
Will help see you through
This world will jump up to surprise you
Reminds me not to lose hope
On humanity yet
Reminds me that I am as lucky
As lucky can get

So I told him that I was having the hardest time
Felt like everything I wrote
Was something I wrote before
He told me, don't give up
Keep the pen to the page and the word's they'll come
So that is what I'm gonna do

Maybe I was wrong and I will never be alone
All because we wrote these punk rock songs
And god-damn that's pretty crazy
So fucking amazing
