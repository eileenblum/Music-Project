Stopped keeping score
Like you keep score
It finally does not mean shit to me anymore
I crumple it up
Throw it away
It's just a way to keep track of how well my hands are played

What I want I've always found a way to have
Got past "no" a long fucking time ago
The only thing that I can't buy more of is time
How could I believe that the hour glass would ever get this thin?

I never listened
I should have listened
But I will fill what is left of my days
With the the things that I love the most
What I hate gets pushed to the side of my plate
When I ride you know that those trumpets play

I've never known a bliss like this

I'll burn this whole place down
Roll right out of this fucking town
Before I become the things that I despise
