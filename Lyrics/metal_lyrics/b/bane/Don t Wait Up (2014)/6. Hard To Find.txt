Because this is what you'll back on
It will cut right through the laughs and all the fun
When you were kicked back waiting for the days to end
Just hanging out with your friends
But sometimes things aren't so easy
Sometimes you have got to chose between what is simple
And what you know is right
To prove that, "you can count on me"
Was what you meant
When you spoke up to write the chapter
On who you are in your heart
When we were so in love with pretty words
Like loyalty, and unity, this is you legacy
Where will you be?

It is really hardly ever that we are tested
Never mind asked to shine
But is there any time more important
Then when we're called upon to be there for a friend?

Friends - they say it's what makes the best defense

What this really comes down to
Is a war within yourself
Face to face with a thousand places that you would rather be
And what you chose is gonna bind you to this time

Friends - they say it's what makes the best defense

And we are all gonna get fucked up sometimes
No one makes it through this shit unharmed
The key is finding the ones worth fighting for
And standing for
And bleeding for

Where you there or did you run?
