There is a whole universe spinning
In perfect harmony around us

We survived the race to the egg
Every breath the holy grail
Beautiful secrets hiding everywhere
So god-damned much
To do, and feel and say

The colors brighter
The music louder
The stakes higher
The kisses longer

Things that need leaving
Rules there for the breaking
Battles that should be raging
Leave your mark on everyone
Age is death, love is worth it
And hard work, it pays off

And time is running out
