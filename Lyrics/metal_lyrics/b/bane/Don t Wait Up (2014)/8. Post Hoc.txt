Though much has been broken enough still survives
And through all the hardship there is a light that still shines
Gone are the days when bullets bounced from our chest
We have become who we are and fuck all the rest

Our scars they tell the stories
Our eyes still look ahead
Still so much that is burning
Defiant hearts not yet dead

Because nothing, no nothing
Is as important as this:
To seek. To rise. To fight
And to do anything but quit
