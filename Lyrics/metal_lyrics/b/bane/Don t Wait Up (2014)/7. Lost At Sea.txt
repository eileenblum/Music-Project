I look at me and I can't see me
Without this
It scares the fuck out of me
Where will I be?
I can't even guess
The ropes nearly cut clean
Who will reach out for me?

I'm lost at sea

What happens when you take away the thing that I have done the best
And loved the most
For all these years
I knew the rules
Some things you cant outrun
And if it lived then it must die
Deaf, dumb, and so naive
No one left to hear me scream

My decisions were so easy
The view it was so pretty
How can it be?
Oh, foolish me
Did I really believe that this would always be?
