She rolls her eyes and lights another.
"One day I'll quit these things they're killing me"
She blows her brains right out her fucking mouth
"I just don't know how you do it"
Well, there is nothing in me
that you don't have deep within your fucking self.
Yes, the body is week but the mind is strong
and it controls the body,
you are not a slave, and I am not a superhero.
The difference between hard
and impossible is a thousand miles wide,
but that's not what you want to hear.
So you live a lifetime of regret
instead of moments of uncomfort
never knowing how great it feels to be free.
