You go on without me I'll hold right here.
That gleam in your eyes, it still fills me with fear.
The more you see that I'm not like the others
the harder you try to take my hand in yours.
Cold grey and callous, reaching out for me.
Whatever's over that that hill, it scares the fuck out of me.
Still you step closer, so that our eyes can meet.
Tell me no one knows me, like you do.
And then you say that I can't play this game forever.
No, you are the king of killers.
I've seen what you do.
Carving through the hearts
and souls of many with cloven hoofs you stomp the dreams of men,
of men far greater that me.
I'm not going I'll hold here.
