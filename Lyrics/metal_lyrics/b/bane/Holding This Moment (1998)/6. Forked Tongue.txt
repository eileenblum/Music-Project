What have you done
Look at what you have done
Screaming words of venom 
Right in your daughters face 
Take the time to show her 
That all her thoughts were wrong 
Shape her in your image 
Just as somebody did to you 
And if this is how you do it 
When you're right in front of me 
I can not imagine what must go down at home 
Never got a chance 
That kid was doomed right at the gate 
I stand and watch you ruin that poor little girl 
In the middle of the street 
And since I can't put a bullet right in your hateful face 
I turn my back and walk away and hope there is a hell 
And soon she'll know just how to use words that cripple 
That cripple like a gun 
What have you done
