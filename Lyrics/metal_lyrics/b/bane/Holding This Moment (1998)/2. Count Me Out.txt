I can still see the reasons
that I opened my eyes to this scene in the first place.
I can still feel my beleifs growing stronger - stronger everyday.
I can still count the ways but for you its all over.
The feeling is gone and you're moving on
and tearing us down with you.
You've shed your past.
Grown up fast, demanding that we all mature at your pace.
But here I'll remain refusing to change remembering
when we were the same I support your decision,
I believe in change and hope you find just what it is that you are looking for.
But when you sit around and talk shit about everything
that you once based your whole life on,
well that is where you can count me out.
Because I will be here tomorrow, and I will be here next 
year, just like this X on the back of my hand, I'm not going nowhere.
