Again- again left with this lesson that is not mine to learn
Tears regret and painful questions it smashes your spine 
Steals all that time 
And takes the eyes right out of your head 
But we don't point a finger 
Nobody says a word 
But it rips us apart 
That old man I looked up to 
Passed out on the floor 
That stupid crazy motherfucker 
Taking all those lives 
The one the love my mother 
Poisoned from inside 
What it did to me ripped us apart 
And you how did it get to you 
The smartest of us all 
It knocked you down and beat you up 
But neither you or it would ever let it go 
And again I pay the price
