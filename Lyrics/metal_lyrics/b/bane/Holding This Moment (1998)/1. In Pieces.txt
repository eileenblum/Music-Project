No matter how much I say that I've learned life's lessons,
the only way to ever really know life's lessons
is when it smacks you right in the face
(life smacks you in the face)
Rubberband stretched to the limit,
but still I cannot help but pull it just a little bit more.
Once again my whole world crumbles, walls cave in, i fall backwards.
Everything I know taken out at the knee.
Hands stuffed deep into my mouth
to keep from choking on the words that show
how much i know about knowing nothing at all
(I dont know anything at all)
I know that these days will have an end just like i know 
that I'll be back again.
This place is awful, but its familiar.
