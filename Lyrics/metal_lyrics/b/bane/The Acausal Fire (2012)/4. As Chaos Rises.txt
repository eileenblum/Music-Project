Into darkness I fall, so deep, so dark
No mystery shall ever be unveiled...

Thoughts of mine, so observe
Swallowed by the realm of reality...

War - a state of mind, an everlasting battle
And only the strong will survive
To conquer and to reign, my own personal hell!

The end is near - there is no savior!
The path you've walked - I spit and burn it's remains!

As chaos rises! The black flame burns!

Betrayed after centuries of devotion, upon invented figures and false prayers
Now you shall finally see the truth
As chaos rises!

War - a state of mind, an everlasting battle
And only the strong will survive
To conquer and to reign, my own personal hell!

As chaos rises! The black flame burns!
