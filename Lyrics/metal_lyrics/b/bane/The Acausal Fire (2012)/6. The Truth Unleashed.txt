For eternity shall suffer - There is no mercy!
The time has arrived - Open the gates!

Watch the earth burn into ashes, eventually - this world is no more
See them all turn into dust, finally - all souls are possessed

May evil unleash its presence, so the truth can reign among us!
May chaos unleash its fury, so the flames can burn us down!

Destroy the weak, so no prayer can be heard!
There is no hope, as hope is the stigmata of the weak!

Here and now, as blasphemy breathes!
We are gathered in sin, as all hell is unleashed

May evil unleash its presence, so the truth can reign among us!
May chaos unleash its fury, so the flames can burn us down!

Underground!

Where the fire never rests, my soul lays buried beneath!
Where chaos is yet to rise, I shall be the one to reign!

Destroy the weak, so no prayer can be heard!
There is no hope, as hope is the stigmata of the weak!
