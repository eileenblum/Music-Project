Watching the world's grief, hatred and horror
Humanity's eyes scream, beg and starve for more
But all is still kept deep underneath their flesh
Waiting for the perfect moment to scratch the earth's surface...

The hunger to kill, the thirst for blood
Question your existence, why are you here?!

Is your existence in denial? Is your life worth to live?
Where will you find the answers? To whom will you prove your truth?

The hunger to kill, the thirst for blood
Question your existence, why are you here?!

Denial â the weak's only weapon, avoid the truth and follow the blind!
Not realizing what is about to come, what lays buried is what lies beneath

What lies beneath!
