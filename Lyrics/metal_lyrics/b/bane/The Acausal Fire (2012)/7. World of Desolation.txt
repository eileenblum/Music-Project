Within the deepest lifeless shadows
Upon the world of desolation
Everything is so crystal-clear
Yet nothing is really what it seems...

Your freedom is nothing more
Than a controlled prison!

The truth - kept as a secret
Buried deep down, underground...

Your freedom is nothing more
Than a controlled prison!
I for one - I shall never:
Never beg, never follow, never pray!

Never!!!

Never beg, never follow, never pray - never die!

Your freedom is nothing more
Than a controlled prison!
I for one - I shall never beg
Never follow, never pray - never die!
