Born by isolated nothingness, I am formless and yet taken
Abominable shape in flesh, the avatar of formless womb

Eternal chaos - come forth, hoathahe Saitan!

Led by Satan's will, I rejoice in chaos
That I have manifested - I call upon thee zax

Move and appear
Multiply your strength in me
Multiply your isolated evil!

Born by the nameless gods of the pit
I am born as the god in flesh
The satanist, the constant adversary
The human beast of the field!

Eternal chaos - come forth
I have taken thy name as a part of myself
IA-I-NOX
Name received from the unknown hands

In which I sleep and shall rise!
Within the purified chamber
And with the extent Luciferian light
Hear these proclamations of certainty:

Casarem ohorela capa pire - hoathahe Saitan!
