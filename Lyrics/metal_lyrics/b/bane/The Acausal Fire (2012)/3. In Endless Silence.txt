From the eternal night, in endless silence
I watch the world go by...
No hope is left, and all was lost
I watch the human race die...

With no grief nor regret
I feel nothing but pain
Yet I am laughing to the rest
Still, remaining sane

Taken away - knowing I will be...
Forsaken - I shall set my spirit free...
Leaving this world - without a goodbye...
Frozen - my heart's bled dry...

From the eternal night, in endless silence
I watch the world go by...
No hope is left, and all was lost
I watch the human race die...
