Dark times are ahead...
Around me - endless obscurity...
No light, sound or smell...
Nowhere to continue...

Is this reality?
The nightmare of all?
The apocalypse arrives!
Our time has come!

Damned is the eternity and forever it shall remain...
I pray for nothing and scream the night...

Is this reality?
The nightmare of all?
The apocalypse arrives!
Our time has come!

This is the end! Chaos is here!
