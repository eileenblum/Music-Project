You shut your ugly mouth
Raise your hand to offer up a lie
That I would not be dead caught wrapped in
All calm and justified like you're not
So scared that you can barely open your eyes

If there's a Hell I'll get there soon enough
Not trying to lie and wait for it
I didn't find God and he didn't come looking for me
But someone showed me Minor Threat
And that was plenty good enough for me
Flipping coins just to get by
Laying it all on the line
So catch me if you can
You think that you can save me
But I've been on the fade for so long
That I can't even find me
