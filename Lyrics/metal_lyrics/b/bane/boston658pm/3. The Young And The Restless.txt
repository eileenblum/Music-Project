I've held onto old codes of honor
Like the captain to a sinking ship
The world moved and rolled its eyes
But there are some things that are worse than dying
It's always been my way to over romanticize
Cuz when I was young I had a hard time
With what was real and fantasized
The world moved on and did its thing
And I tried and I tried
But could not stop being that boy
And nothing turned out quite like they told me

I will believe in dragons for as long as I run with dragons
While these bodies keep piling up
But there are some things that are worse than dying
