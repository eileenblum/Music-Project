So this is it
Here it is, moment of truth
The one you've always heard about
Everything around you stops to hold its breath
And your heart slows to a thump
There's a lion in your gut (you've got to listen)
Lying still in you for so long (you've got to listen)
Lifts his head so seldom and you have got to listen
Cause when he wakes he roars and its your time to shine
Do not hesitate do not fucking wait
Let all those yesterdays, all those bloody days
Pile up to clutter your way
You're the Rocky movie
You're that Nike add
Balls in your court
And everything before has led you right fucking here
Sum total of every decision that you have ever made
Sum total of every blow you've had to fade
So make you're move
Take that shot
Be the ball
This moment will define you
Live, learn, rise, fall, point, squeeze
We were not awarded bones simply to weigh down our graves
So ring out, baby, ring out
The wind will break your fall
The rush will pick you up
