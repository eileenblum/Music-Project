Would you believe that the last time these skinned knees healed
It no longer amazed me like it used to and I hate to say it but...
Things they suddenly made a simple kind of sense
The horror, the mad ness, the helplessness of it all
That there is indeed beauty as well as blood 
In life's ocean of disasters
These shattered dreams and dead promises 
Will not stand forever like graves
But one day grow legs and slowly walk away
In between the tornadoes and stomped on untrue love letters
There will be those shining gentle moments 
Like the last page in your favorite book or 
How badly I miss my mother
But how much I've come to love my father
And you scream that it's been forever since
You witnessed blue skies
But trust me when I say that yes
This too will pass
It will quiet
Literally nothing stays the same
Just look to the clouds and you shall see
Always changing forever moving on again and again
Life's one worthwhile guarantee
