We just can't go on
No not like this
The center will not hold
So many voices with so much to say
But frozen when it's time to lift a finger
And fix what has been broken for so long
You have not taken one true step towards leaving the
Pettiness that you claim that you left behind
This scene that that you are such a proud part of
Buckles when you're ego strikes
Sinks under the weight of your apathy
Your actions erase the good in your words
And your compassion's as empty as your pride
It's not enough the things that you say
It's how you live your life day by day
Forget what you are
I wanna know who you are
It doesn't matter what you call yourself
It's how you carry yourself
Are you really here to help?
