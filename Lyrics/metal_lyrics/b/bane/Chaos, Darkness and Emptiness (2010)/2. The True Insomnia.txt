In the darkness of consciousness rules the morality
Our nature lurks beyond, deceiving mortality
Teach through generations, buried by force of qualia
Our sluffed with a thought on roots of the only realization

The true insomnia

Deceived from the start
Shocked and destroyed
We exist no more!

The ancient truth is buried
Lies are our monuments
Which differences make us real?
For those whose rights are we here?

"Anything that we are aware of at a given moment forms part of our consciousness making conscious experience at once the most familiar and most mysterious aspect of our lives"

We are prophets - individual oracles
Concerning the human understanding
Our believers crave for miracles

Crimson is all I can see, a bloody story of our extermination
Red is the color of birth, only death brings summary of views
Created by our degradation
