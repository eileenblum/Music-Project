In the deepest darkness of your eyes
Where the beautiful silence lies
Where no light has ever shinned
Where no one has ever looked inside...

Behind the peaceful presence
Covered beneath lays the essence
Of all human-like abhorrence...

The one I shall forever despise
Once shinned in my own eyes
The one that is now my enemy
Was once part of me...

Raped by the screams of your inner voice
Still remaining unconscious of your choice
The torturing methods you deserve to feel
Would be far beyond impossible to heal...

In horrid agony, and constant pain
Still without feeling a second of shame
This time the last one laughing shall be me
Unmercifully extracting your blood until the last drop
