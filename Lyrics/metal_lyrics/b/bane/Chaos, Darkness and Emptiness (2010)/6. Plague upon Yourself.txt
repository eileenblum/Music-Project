Thusly and so beneath, a blood moon shine
Upon the world so crystalline
Until a loud cry crossed the night
Over the iced white shred of light

A universal beginning
A miniature echo of the birth of time
Will tumble upon abominable life giving delusional mind

The rain of limbs and babies
Of which they were a part
And the terror of the destiny rushing them from below

Becoming a cancer
You have become a plague upon yourself

Life's but a walking shadow
A tale told by an idiot
Full of sound and fury signifying nothing!

The more I see, the more am I disgust
Hate and detest that animal called man!
