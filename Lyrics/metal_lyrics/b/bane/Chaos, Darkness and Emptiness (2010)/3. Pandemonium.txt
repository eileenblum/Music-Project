Caused is the sin
And all evil shall win
Bleeding from within
Deeply sinking in

The bottomless depths of pain
Where the hale becomes insane
My path is the one I choose to follow
Which will bring me to my grave

No one shall give - only greed is real
No one shall stand - only falling is real
No one shall love - only hate is real
No one shall live - only death is real

Everything that was ever meant
Is now worthless and forsaken
Helpless and abandoned
Is how you will forever remain

Let thy chaos forever reign upon us!!!

Nothingness is what I feel
And is everything I craved for...
