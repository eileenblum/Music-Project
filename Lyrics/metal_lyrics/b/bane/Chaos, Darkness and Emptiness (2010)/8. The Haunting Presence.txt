Alone in this dark chamber
Watching the fire of burning the candles
Everything always reminds me of you

Underneath the gray skies
In the cold winter breeze
Your presence is always haunting me

In the deepest depths of my mind
Your voice somewhere echoes
And after all is lost and forgotten
We are nowhere to be found or remembered

Underneath the gray skies
In the cold winter breeze
Your presence is always haunting me

And finally
Our souls
Rest in peace
Forever
