we are only brave enough to fight the battles already won for us
and spend more time with our hair than we do our minds
while the girls and the young and the lost
are kicked off to the side
our armies in fractions because our kings are so foolish
we will never know true victory and are happy just to survive
to live to dance another day
still clinging to those golden - olden days
while our mouths sweep the mess to the back of our minds
nothing ever changing as we all grow older
nothing ever changing as our hearts grow colder
that's what holds us down
we flap our wings but we never leave the ground
