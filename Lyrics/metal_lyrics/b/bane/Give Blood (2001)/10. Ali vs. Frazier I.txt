(rumble, young man, rumble)
how many more days will you sit 
and talk about your ambitions
all that you can be
the person you are dying to be
the place you want to get to
but always out of reach
before that fury swells inside of you
grows so big that it forever quiets you
stand up to your demons
make a run at your goliath
find the best, find the worst
waiting in both of you
it's not the who or the what that is lasting
but how you fight 
that is the fight
the only mark that will not leave you
and i will feel my heart drum its final beat
if it meant that i have given this my all
there's nothing left for me to believe in
if not you, if not this...
what else is there but death?
(it's your call...it's all on you)
give more
give everything
give blood
