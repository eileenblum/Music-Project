your garbage it is growing
and your weapons and rebellions 
were charged on daddy's card
to all your baffled looks
we didn't choose to do this the hard way
but we scream our lungs and we raise our glasses
to all the girls, and all the boys
with the first five minutes of a war always at their sides
(and like the man said...)
"i fall asleep with pen in hand there's something 
you should know"
and all your guts and all your goals
came in the shiny promo package
knew how this would end before you bled for the beginning
strike a pose
so when you get off your happy little bus
with your happy little smiles
with your happy little instruments that never go out of tune
we will be fucking up and missing words
following you in a van that we had to beg to start
and of course we're fucking angry
and of course we're tired and ugly
it's not all a sunny Sunday
(and like the man said...)
"you can take a road that takes you to the stars
i can take a road that will see me through"
