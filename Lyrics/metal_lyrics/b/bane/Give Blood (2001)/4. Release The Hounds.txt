all swelled with pride, your chest blown out
face the flag as you declare
"we are the greatest country in the world
richest, smartest, most advanced...
who can keep up with us?"
and where has it gotten us?
take a look around
as miserable as we have ever been
violent, mean, pulling our hair out
as fourteen year olds march through metal detectors
bitter, unhealthy, empty
most dissatisfied of societies
my granddad weeps for the simple days
everything that you could ever dream of
five minutes from our fingertips
prettied, processed, packaged,
shipped right to your door
we need everything in every color
to feel that we're alive
we've got to brag to all the world
about all our toys
just like when we were five
i hear you chant
"everything is alright, it's gonna be alright"
as you rush to your night job
everything is gonna be alright
knuckles white as you grip your purse
you scream that things could not be better
as the flames lick at your face
and i'm as fucked as anybody
the bright lights catch my eyes
i'm as scared as anyone
the blood rains from the sky
we can't tell what we want from what we need
or which one matters more
it's all a spinning mobile
it's all a catchy lullaby
everything is gonna be alright
so suck your thumb
