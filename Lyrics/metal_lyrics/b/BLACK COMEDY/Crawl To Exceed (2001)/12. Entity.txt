What am I, wrapped up in this tissue, in this mortal flesh
A frail creature called human, that gives life only to give death!

An aura of content, caused by recent, lost in a feeling thatâs beyond my body
A life away, seemingly safe, brought on a course thatâs leaving all of me
Extract the mind, what will you find, a soul without any doubt or fear
Calm and clear, yet so afraid, that when I die that I wonât miss it all!
Have I become my own enemy! (Worst enemy)

Blind is a faith, that rules it away, the lust of the body is the soulâs life in practice
First comes the fear, that puts you in gear, so fucking consumed with my own being
Sensational joy, love turned to a toy, itâs a play where we all are actors
And what feelings have you, come to seclude, your one life to emotional penitentiary
Have I become my own enemy! (Worst enemy)

Is this state of me?
Because my thoughts are far too beyond me
Is this state of me?
A lucid flesh bound entity
Is this state of me?
That only cares about one thing: Me!

Who: am I to judge
Who: am I to feel me
Who: am I to bleed
Who: am I to breed
Who: am I to hate
Who: am I to create
Who: am I to die
Who: am I to say goodbye
