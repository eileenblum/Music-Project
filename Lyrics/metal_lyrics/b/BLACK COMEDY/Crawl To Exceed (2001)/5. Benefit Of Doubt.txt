Avoid the consequences
Canât stand by your own actions
Get your savior who has power to free you from these sanctions
A Jesus in disguise
A lawyer who believes heâs Christ
(yeah) This is what itâs all about - manipulate the benefits of doubt!

Freedom at an expenseâ¦ (what!)
American justice, tell me whatâs it meant to be?
Controlled by law to what degree?
An institute with such weak competence

Based on honor with no substance
Ingredients stable with the media focus
Turning courts into goddamn circus
Weâre guided by a greed which makes no exception
Practice prestige!
Who cares if defendant is guilty?

Lying, acting - is this how youâll win?
Fighting for freedom - verdict makes no sense

It wonât be luck or faith that will bring this country together
Nor the touch god or the fund-sucking congressmen (whenâ¦)
Truth is at absence!

â¦And these frivolous needs of our society
Renders every man his due?
These words have no meaning to me
Cause this system stands without a clue
Profit beats the way of clear conscience
Justice in the hands of truly blind goddess
Weâre guided by a greed which makes no exception
Money exceeds as truth limps on

Lying, acting - is this how youâll win?

What an illusion
That we ever could believe
That man would put equality above his own personal greed
Thereâs innocence, thereâs pride
Then tell me why theyâre used to undermine mans greatestâ¦ LIES!

Itâs the right to disagree, itâs the right to say
That the system often fails but whoâll be the one to pay
Not the judges hiding behind their books, not lawyerâs firms
But the everyday citizen in a society that burns!

Truth is at absence!
A truth opposite of meaning
Still accept it through and through
Look again to see whoâs bleeding
You think it doesnât concern you -well do you?
