Breathe you son of a bitch, donât you dare let go!
Too young to die, to vile autonomy
No response and a pulse at an all time low
Please wake up my friend, I canât stand here watching you die
Mouth to mouth, still no sign of life
Come on my friend, you can make through it
Hang on, live on, get through this day
Wake up, stand up, donât fuck me this way, way!

Pinch you hard, but you wonât move an inch
Eyes are closed, reflexes motionless
Skin is moist, stiff, white and cold
Can I accept that thereâs no more I can do? (do!)
The irony of fate

Iâm sitting here crying: too proud to admit that Iâve lost it
The grim grip of reality sweeps me whole with misery
A friend so colourful, his bodyâs left, absent of soul
Freezes my thoughts, my will live, if there are lives to take
Who wants to give?

Eyes are blurring, is this a dream?
Whatâs happening to me?
Itâs dark, cold and I canât see
Canât feel the blood in me
Emptiness, Iâm falling
Illusions flash aside
A struggle to recover, inside I slowly die

Iâm the fucking victim here!
