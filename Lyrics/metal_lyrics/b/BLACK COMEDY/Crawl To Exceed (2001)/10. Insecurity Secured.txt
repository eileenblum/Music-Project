Victimized, paralyzed, by the thoughts you seem moralize and consent
Whose thoughts are we here to prevent?

Oh, I try so hard yet it wonât help me
My lies within me like one ton sunken concrete
Happiness just isnât a part of me
Is flattering myself just cheap activity?

Shallow lies, indiscrete adversitiles Say am I what I am?
Compensate my missing self-respect with flaws Do I hate what I hate?
I will have to swallow my pride I am what I perpetrate?
Redraw my fault! Say am I what I am?
Consistent cries, directly demoralize Do I hate what I hate?
The core emptiness of my heart I am what I perpetrate?

Results in insecurity Just canât erase it away
See my eyes
Itâs myself I despise

Is this a serious case of bad karma?
You think Iâm not that kind (oh you wish)
Am I in control of my sordid little brain?
Determine if Iâm dumb or insane

Shallow lies, indiscrete adversitiles Say am I what I am?
Compensate my missing self-respect with flaws Do I hate what I hate?
I will have to swallow my pride I am what I perpetrate?
Redraw my fault! Say am I what I am?
Consistent cries, directly demoralize Do I hate what I hate?
The core emptiness of my heart I am what I perpetrate?

Results in insecurity Just canât erase it away
See my eyes
Itâs myself I despise
