Big brother is surveyingâ¦
Canât elude his instruments of watch
Tracking every movement
Espionage on those he donât trust
Disinformation
His best weapon or so it seems
Those thoughts he needs to control
Who knows who might just mass against him?

Aside this world thatâs supposed to be free
Living machines that donât need gasoline
First to the mill receives the first bill
Which weâll pay for the rest of our lives!
By choice or birthright?

Pride (our pride)
How often itâs been the one that shames us
Mind (our mind)
Never to smart to be outsmarted
Ever flowing stream
Neurons of a mechanical state
Drones of the new world
Bow down to your newborn fate

Aside this world thatâs supposed to be free
Living machines that donât need gasoline
First to the mill receives the first bill
Which weâll pay for the rest of our lives!
By choice or birthright?
This is the world I despise!

This is the world in my eyes!
By choice or birthright?
Maybe its time we realize
Youâll never see that place again
By choice or birthright?
This is the world in my eyes!

On course, of course!
A system made out to enslave us
A right of the unrighteous
A law for the unknowing self-contagious
Marching to a beat the machines set with no relent
Truth outset
The questions remain

Shame youâve lost your freedom
I canât get rid of this feeling
Why are we lost in hate?
This true life weâre concealing
With all lost whatâs at stake
What am I? A part of the plot to control my own thoughts
I cannot die - my precious life belongs to the conquering robots

Too soulless to feel the itching sting of consciousness
What would stability be without the element of chaos!

This is the world in my eyes!
By choice or birthright?
Maybe its time we realize
Youâll never see that place again
By choice or birthright?
This is the world in my eyes!
