Have I no thoughts nor sympathy?
Am I ready to kill my enemy?
Gun clutched in my fist
Why do I put my life at risk?

Stand tall, and fight with grace
Today, its death youâll face
Neither way youâll climb that wall
For thy country youâll live or fall

Control? What self-esteem?
Today, no one will win
See the light, I just dig down
A shallow grave upon this ground

Fields lie, fields lie cold of menâs souls, freedoms fall
Fields lie, fields lie cold of menâs souls, freedoms fall

Soldier! Hold thy ground
Commanded by the proud
With every life youâre willing to take
Wars are to be won, youâre here to annihilate

Down cold, no time to run
Look up, your time has come
Seal the fate of those who die
Pro patria mori, I live the lie

Fields lie, fields lie cold of menâs souls, freedoms fall
Fields lie, fields lie cold of menâs souls, freedoms fall

So itâs this you call GLORY?
Up until this day Iâll be sorryâ¦

Fields lie, fields lie cold of menâs souls, freedoms fall
Fields lie, fields lie cold of menâs souls, freedoms fall
