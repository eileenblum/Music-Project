Am I lost or am I at the place to be?
Never mind my lacking confidence
Am I still a man?
All I know is that this shipâs going down
In this world what more could you expect
Shrink my dignity then crave respect
Am I though my own enemy?
So frustrated, so misplaced

Faith?
At what cost do you sell youâre soul
Hate?
Iâm not the one crumbling inside
Conceit?
Who says Iâm suddenly so bold?
Save me!
And whoâs free?

A piece of mind, a piece of me and a piece of that
Well Iâve had enough of this show
There is nothing more
I might be stupid but I ainât slow
Should I applaud when I know youâve won
Donât expect something like that âsonâ
Do you need a clue?
So frustrated, so misplaced

Faith?
At what cost do you sell youâre soul
Hate?
Iâm not the one crumbling inside
Conceit?
Who says Iâm suddenly so bold?
Save me!
And whoâs free?

Psychiatric bullshit lasts. Thrash!

Faith?
At what cost do you sell youâre soul
Hate?
Iâm not the one crumbling inside
Conceit?
Who says Iâm suddenly so bold?
Save me!
And whoâs free?
