Iâve been a formidable sinner, a creep of deceit, a false winner
Crossed my love to make myself look better
Donât tell me that ain`t the miserable life of a cheater

Somewhere another place for me
Another place, another way
The pain I gave wouldnât let me rest my soul
Itâs time to stop living in denial
A second chance: like reaching out for sand
Before I knew it had it slipped out of my hands

Is this chain of pain, too thick for you?
Too far in contempt, no need to repent?
A loss of soul, too damaged to be repaired
A strain of lust, I was much too afraid to share
On a whole: did I learn from myâ¦
(On a whole) misfortune
I plead now like no one else has done it
Could you ever see it in your heartâ¦ NO!

Somewhere another place for me
Another place, another way
The pain I gave wouldnât let me rest my soul
Itâs time to stop living in denial
A second chance: like reaching out for sand
Before I knew it had it slipped out of my hands

I could never find out what was wrong
Nothing was making me strong
And my will to live was gone!
Was my rage blinding me all along?
