I would never lie
Defy that Iâve crossed the line
Have you ever felt this way?
Or does it come too late?
Believe me, Iâve been there before
And itâs nothing I want to restore

They (â¦so ungodly) feed on my pain

Freed?
I never felt so deceived deep down inside

So strong, so hard-hitting
Cut the crap, stop bullshitting
Listen to the puncture sound
As all our lives go down

They (â¦so ungodly) feed on my pain
Have I crawled enough for your eyes to see?
Your world and how you critically perceive
The weakness in me I loathe to contain
Tell me should you or I explain?

They (â¦so ungodly) feed on my pain

(wonât bleed for you more)
`Cause Iâve had enough of this
Like life is a wandering bliss
Seen all this before
I hate what I adore (repent?)
Punctured like a freak
Is all this shit for me?
Sow but not to reap
And just a follower of the sheep!
Content?

A struggle for nothing
Never believing
Caught up inside of trying to become:
Free of all cause!
