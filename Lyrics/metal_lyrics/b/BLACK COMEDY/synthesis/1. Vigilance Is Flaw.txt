Iâm so sick of your pathetic ranting
Self-righteous quasi-intellectual chanting
Blaming the world for its unfair treatment
It was never made for youâ¦ period!
You never offered any rewarding sentiments
Playing a victim of societies impediments
Hurt multiplies your search for truth
Claiming the weight of the world is on you

Itâs a shame and you shouldnât be too proud
Your life revolves around hating the crowd
Attacking them for their illicit immoral
To claim youâre better is just hypocritical         
Your shallowness has become clearer
Your infinite sense of feeling inferior
Why classify them as anticipated enemies
Meaningless priorities consume all your energies

Itâs a world of uncertaintyâ¦
But it wonât help if youâre always on the edge of things
Contempt unsurpassed
Synthetic values still unmatched
Growing lash-outs, inflammatory speech
Has left you no integrity!
Seemingly youâve abandoned all trust
The fact that all your friends youâve lost
So bold outside, so scared insideâ¦ you bleedâ¦
Whatâs the point?

I know the things I should have guessed
All the problems you left unaddressed
Life, they say, is piece of plastic
Yours was, is and will always be tragic
You try to erase every trace of weakness
Indulge into nothing that gives stimulus
Rid yourself from the pains of the past
Or else youâll find yourself under attack

This is my incentive, my sole objective
Please end your scrutiny, because youâre definitely better offâ¦without this misery!
Whatâs the point!

Itâs a world of uncertaintyâ¦
But it wonât help if youâre always on the edge of things
Contempt unsurpassed
Synthetic values still unmatched
Growing lash-outs, inflammatory speech
Has left you no integrity!
Seemingly youâve abandoned all trust
The fact that all your friends youâve lost
So bold outside, so scared insideâ¦ you bleedâ¦
Whatâs the point?
The shell is cracking, but in your mind everything is threateningâ¦

A slave of self-wit
The pain is hellish
Ruining real lives
Is truth on your side?
The unforgiving
The warped feelings
Keep on the same
Whose world do you live in?

Itâs a world of uncertaintyâ¦
But it wonât help if youâre always on the edge of things
Contempt unsurpassed
Synthetic values still unmatched
Growing lash-outs, inflammatory speech
Has left you no integrity!
Seemingly youâve abandoned all trust
The fact that all your friends youâve lost
So bold outside, so scared insideâ¦ you bleedâ¦
Whatâs the point!
The shell is cracking, but in your mind everything is threateningâ¦

You can blame me! For what itâs all worth, deep down inside you know you can thank yourselfâ¦
