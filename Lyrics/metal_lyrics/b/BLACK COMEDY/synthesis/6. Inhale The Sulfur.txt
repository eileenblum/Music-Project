Well letâs all celebrate because another war has just begun
A cause so holy that no one would ever dare leave it undone
This isnât just an acute gesture of national self-preservation
Disprove all critics of our proud nation             
To this unwarranted attack we resolutely respond
Prove to the world that no one can piss on our lawn
Hey! Who doesnât know that weâre vulnerable as everybody else?
And we know that security is what truly sells

No need to moralize, we know that everyone will be on our side
Weâll sacrifice a few good men, but theyâll weigh up for what we idealize 
It becomes all the more easy when we paint the world in black and white
Assurance of whoâs with or against â an undeniable right
Itâs self-evident the spirit of unity thatâs the ideal
And to support the leadership with true patriotic zeal
Attention â aggression â concentration â to kill

My name is Uncle Sam and I think I can solve your problems
Model on my own land, home of the free, capital and religion
Never mind the rest of the whole world; weâll do as we fucking please
And those whoâre against us weâll eliminate with the greatest ease
Donâtâ¦ sayâ¦
We are whatâs freedom
Donâtâ¦ sayâ¦
If not against then with them
Donâtâ¦ sayâ¦
Truth is sold
Donâtâ¦ sayâ¦
We are in control

Hear me! What splendor, a consolation for terror
Fear them! This is your shell of hollow pride

My name is Uncle Sam and I think I can solve your problems
Model on my own land, home of the free, capital and religion
Never mind the rest of the whole world; weâll do as we fucking please
And those whoâre against us weâll eliminate with the greatest ease
Donât... say...
Democracy
Donât... say...
Equality
Donât... say...
Land of the free
Donât... say...
Man above cause
Inhale the sulfur!
